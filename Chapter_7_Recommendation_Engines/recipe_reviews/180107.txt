I followed the recipe and it turned out too sweet and weird tasting. I tried to fix it by adding more salt, 1 tsp minced garlic, 1/4 onion and 1/2 tbsp hot chili sauce, which helped by giving it a more "mexican" flavor. Did not try this, but I think adding fresh cilantro should make it even better. Sorry about all the changes, but the original is just not good.

I submitted this recipe and glad to see all the good reviews. Please note that you can use tomato paste instead of ketchup. Also, kick it up a notch with more chili powder and onion powder. Also good with powdered garlic. Make it really fresh by adding fresh chopped onion, freshed chopped garlic and fresh cilantro!

Wow!  So easy & tasty.  I reduced the amount of ketchup to 1 tsp since it's not my favorite & it saved add'l calories.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good. I was just looking for a healthy appetizer and was pleasantly suprised at how good it tasted. I did not have any apple cider vinegar so I used 3 tsps of balasamic vinger.   afraid the dip would be too bland and had planned on adding some green chiles.  I forgot about the chiles and it did not need it.  The ingredients for this recipe(except for the apple cider vinegar) are things I always have on hand.  I will definitely make it again.  It tasted good with chips and but also with carrot and celery stick.

Very Good and Easy!  I cook my own black beans and felt I needed to add a little of the broth to make it more creamy.  It was delicious!

I love this! No apple cider vinegar, so I added more Balsamic, fresh cilantro and red onion. A bit of cayenne pepper also. I will make this all the time. Thank you!

Just made this prior to the superbowl game and it is not good!  The vinegar and ketchup make it sour and sweet, just not the way I personally think black bean dip should taste.

I stumbled across this recipe in a rush for a quick appetizer.  It's so good and easy.  But mostly, it has such an amazing and unusual flavor.  Everyone at the party had to have the recipe!  I put mine in a pie plate with sour cream on top and shredded cheese.

I made this recipe for the first time this weekend for my 6 yr. old daughters birthday party.  She had a frog theme and I wanted to make "fly dip."  Even with this unappatizing name, everyone loved it!  I had many parents ask for the recipe and my husband loved it.  It was so fast and easy to make. I did not change a thing in the recipe and served it with tortilla chips. I will definately be making it again.  Thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe, but was having trouble with the texture. After it was all done I added some finely chopped red onion, coursely chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lime. I found this suited my tastes better.

I eat a lot beans, and I have made many bean dips. As written, I found this dip to be nearly inedible. I made some changes based on other reviews, but in the end, I threw most of it away.

This was sooooo yummy. I used the balsamic vinegar in place of the cider vinegar and I think it made it even better because of the sweetness factor. Will be making this on a regular basis.

I made this to rave review.  I passed it on to a friend of mine who wanted something different for Thanksgiving.  She called me and thanked afterward, great success.  They loved it and couldn't  believe it was made with black beans.  I omitted the added salt.  I think the salt in the cans of beans and the ketchup should suffice.

I just mixed the vinegar, ketchup, etc. together in a mixing bowl, added the rinsed & drained beans and mashed all together with my potato masher.  I did add a bit of lime juice to the dip, also. I tried using some of the black beans in a quesadilla - and while I might make this recipe again as a dip, I won't be using it for another quesadilla. The vinegar/ketchup taste just wasn't quite right.

I used chili sauce instead of ketchup after reading the reviews. I liked the flavor of the dip, but it is very dry, not creamy.

I didn't like the ketchup taste and it was too thick.
Next time I would add low fat plain yogurt and leave out the tomoto, and even bump up the chili.  Or just keep searching....sorry!

I really enjoy this dip.  I've made it several times now and brought it to a Superbowl party and it was enjoyed by all.  I almost think it tastes like there's beer in it.  I feel like I could get away with calling it Beer and Bean Dip or something.  It must be the mix of the balsamic and apple cider vinegar.  Tried to first make it in my Magic Bullet but the mix is too thick so the food processor is definitely the way to go.  Love that this dip is healthy.

Easy recipe- and very good! I skipped the ketchup because of the sugar content but otherwise, followed it exactly as written. Would definitely add fresh cilantro next time.

I thought it was pretty tasty! I used 2 c. of dried beans that I had previously cooked, and added some water for consistency when I was blending. I also used 3 tsp. of basalmic, and 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar.

This was very heavy on vinegar - between balsamic, ketchup and cider vinegar.  Gave it an odd flavor.  No one I served it to found it to be edible, and i followed the recipe exactly.

This was a little too salty with an odd sweet taste. I didn't care for the flavor combinations. I used fresh onion and added bottled garlic and cilantro.   If I made again, I'd cut back on both vinegars, the ketchup, and the salt. I'd pump up the raw onion and the chili powder and add fresh tomatoes.   However, this was super-easy, healthy, and I had every ingredient already in my pantry.

I didn't have a measuring spoon so I winged it with the measurements.  I used a masher instead of a food processor, so it was more chunky.  Per some other reviews I added less balsamic, less ketchup, and no cider vinegar.  Also added some garlic powder.  It's definitely different, and I rather liked it!  Very quick to make.  Next time I will add fresh onion.

I thought it was fantastic. My husband wouldn't eat it because of the color (haha) and because he is a person with texture issues and it was pretty creamy. But the taste was great, if i do it again I won't make it quite so smooth.

This stuff is amazing! I added a little garlic salt (maybe 1/2 tsp) and half a green pepper. My husband loved it. I think next time I'll throw a whole clove of garlic in and add a little heat, but it's delicious without anything added!

I cooked up the dried black beans, then blended everything in the blender, leaving it slightly chunky using tomato paste instead of ketchup.  This is great with veggies!

I had some leftover home cooked black beans to use up.  Another recipe I saw somewhere called for about half a cup of salsa with the blended beans, which I thought was a pretty close approximation to your recipe and it worked out very easy.  Added a squeeze of lime to up the acid and a bit more garlic.  Might not look pretty but sure tastes great.

I read the one review and used fresh garlic and onion instead of the powder. I also reduced the balsamic vingear by 1 T and the ketchup also.  I added a can of garbanza beans and green chiles to the recipes.  I then topped it off with cheese, black olives, onions, salsa and alittle sour cream.  Tasted much better!

Just a little too vinegar-ee for me. I'll make again for sure though and just cut back on the balsamic and increase the chili-powder. I'll update later.

I made the recipe exactly as written and it is excellent. Just the right amount of tang.  You might want to double it - makes a small batch.  The second time I made it I put in 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese and 1/2 cup sour cream.  It took away from the tang a little bit, but made the recipe a little larger.

Followed recipe exactly as I forgot to tell hubby that we should cut back on the ketchup.  It may also be good to cut back on the vinegar and do it to taste.

I probably shouldn't have  even made this, since I'm not a big fan of vinegar. The taste of vinegar in the finished recipe was way too overpowering for me.

Very good!  Based on the other reviews I only used 1 tbsp ketchup, but it still tasted ketchup-y.  I added extra salt.  I think it could be improved by adding more spice with a dash of tabasco.

i have no idea how this is possibly creamy.  i followed it exactly and it was way to sweet and totally chunky and dry.  i added olive oil, chopped onions and garlic, lemon juice and water to try to save it.  it's edible but i will not make this again.

While I appreciate the quick prep time, I found this very bland, but was able to spice it up with a few drops of hot sauce. I had been looking for a quick black bean dip I had made before that was darker and more flavourful.

The first time I made this it was a 4 for my family's taste.  I then made it again with adding 1/2 tsp of chili paowder and 1/3 cup of chopped onions and we loved it.  It is a crowd pleaser at parties and with the summer heat it's a no brainer.

With my changes it was pretty good. Could use more tweaking to bring more moisture to the party.

I immediately jumped on this recipe for a Sunday afternoon snack.  We like balsamic vinegar so I doubled it and next time will eliminate the cider vinegar...Used garlic powder b/c I didn't have onion and will probably add more next time.  Very good!  (p.s.  double this ...it will go fast!)

I made this recipe this morning so the flavors could meld together by lunch time. I skipped the ketchup and used 1/2 diced roma tomato in it's place. I didn't rinse the beans and I only partially drained them. I'm guessing I used about 1 T of the juice in the recipe. I used Bush seasoned black beans and it turned out really~really yummy!

I made the recipe exactly as described. I didn't like the taste very much. I ate in the dip with crackers and rolled up in a tortilla with cheese and sour cream. I had to use tons of sour cream to balance out the taste. Next time, I would probably try it with a little less ketchup and balsamic vinegar.

I didn't care for this one. The vinegar was strong to me, or maybe it was the ketchup. It wasn't my favorite.
