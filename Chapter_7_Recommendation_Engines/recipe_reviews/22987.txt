This cake was GONE at the end of the day.  It's very, light.  I used the golden butter recipe.  Also used the COOL WHIPPED FROSTING on same website.  All you do is add a small package of instant vanilla pudding, 1 cup of milk, and 1 tsp vanilla to the 8 oz cool whip.  You combine the pudding mix with milk and vanilla, and mix until smooth.  Gently fold in cool whip until no streaks.  This topping is also good for a fruit dip.  It's a little more firm than just plain cool whip.  I was concerned about letting the cake sit out all day with a cool whip topping, but that wasn't a problem. Everyone was able to see how festive it was -- then chowed down on it later.  I will fix this every July 4th -- now a tradition in our family.

I make a similar cake every year for the 4th of July. Instead of a plain yellow cake, I use a white one and make it a jello cake, then frost with the cool whip and decorate with berries. Turns an ok cake into a winner!!

A nice cake and very pretty to look at!
I used chocolate cake instead of yellow just because I think that chocolate cake with Cool Whip is one of the best flavors in the world!
Don't try to skimp on the whipped cream like I did. Use the whole container, believe me its well worth it. And make sure the cake is COMPLETELY cooled before you frost it, otherwise you'll end up with a runny, sloppy mess. Although a very good tasting mess.
A very yummy and easy (plus fast) cake to do.

I have used a similar recipe for years.  I use a white cake mix. Poke holes in cake with a wooden skewer and pour 1 package prepared instant red jello, such as rasberry, cherry or strawberry over cake. Prepare only with 1 cup of hot water cooled. Frost with real whipped cream or Cool Whip. Deocorate with Blueberries for the stars and ether strawberries or red rasberries for the stripes. I bake it for the 4th of July and always get raves. Very Moist.

It's good but too much cake and not enough strawberries.  The next time I made it I sliced the cake in half longways to make a layer.  I poured strawberry glaze and put a layer of sliced strawberries and blueberries.  Placed the top layer of cake and finished with whipped cream, blueberries and strawberries to make look like a flag.  My family and friends loved it!

This is a fun and festive dessert that is easy to make.  I ended up only needing about half of the fruit called for.  Because my strawberries were so big, I needed to slice the strawberries thinner (in half and then in thirds) to be able to make 6 red stripes.  If you have to slice the strawberries more than just in half, it helps to slice off some of the inside flesh.  This helps the strawberries to lie flat so that only the outer red skin shows hiding the paler fleshy part.  Nothing terribly unique about the taste, but still yummy enough and very patriotic.  Kids loved it and can help in the decorating process.

This is one of my favorite recipes during this time of the year.  The only thing that I do differently is to use an already made pound cake (we like Sara Lee).  We decorate it the same way...just smaller (since there are only 3 of us.)  Thanks for a reminder and a great recipe.

I'm Canadian, so I did this a little differently. I made my yellow cake mix, as directed. Instead of decorating the entire cake though, I broke it up, and in a large bowl arranged it Trifle style. I used real whipped cream and left out the blueberrys. So, instead it was really like a strawberry and whipped cream trifle. Very tasty. :)

Not a bad cake.  I took someones advice  who reviewed this cake as well an added a packet of instant vanilla pudding to the whipped topping.  Definatley gave it a better taste and a firmer texture. Would make this again with the added pudding!

I give this 4 stars for appearance. It is good, too, but I have a twist on it that I think is a little tastier and still fits the red, white & blue theme. I make an angel food cake and tear it into bite-sized pieces; cut clean the blueberries and clean and slice the strawberries into another bowl. Be generous with the berries!

In a third bowl make creme of whipped topping, instant vanilla pudding and skim milk (cut back on the milk a little to compensate for the whipped topping). Using a large glass bowl to assemble the dessert, layer angelfood cake, pudding mixture, then berries. Repeat. 

Hint: prepare all the ingredients for assembly waiting until last to make the pudding mixture. You want to put the dessert together as soon as you mix the creme so it sets up in the dessert not in the bowl you've mixed it in.

Sorry the recipe isn't more specific, but you really can't go wrong. This is a favorite of all my friends and family... it just tastes like summer. Years ago I was preparing a dessert for a July 4th party. I was aiming for a finished product like the one in the picture. With an ambitious three-year-old helping it didn't look that good, at all, but it got rave reviews for taste. My three-year old even said, "Mom, that sure is ugly pudding but it's really yummy." The name "ugly pudding" stuck but we found the layered presentation was a big improvement in aesthetics. To this day my husband and kids ask for ugly pudding more than any other treat.

Darling festive cake! Got lots of oohs and awwws. Use the vanilla pudding in the cool whip. Makes a great topping. I also used white cake mix cooked and cooled then poked holes every couple of inches and poured strawberry  jello small pack  made with 1 cup of boiling water mixed then added 1/2 cup of ice cold water mixed then poured over cake so it was marbled. Cooled for an hour in fridge. Then frosted and decorated. It was a hit!!!

This cake looks good and we did a homemade cake version for Fourth of July, but why call this a "shortcake" when it's just a yellow cake mix?

Great for July 4th!  We had BBQ at Brother-in-law's house with about 30 people, and everybody could not wait to cut the cake to enjoy.   I used German chocolate cake instead of yellow cake.  I also poked cake and ran 14 oz can of fat free sweeten condensed milk right after come out of the oven.  It is rich and milky chocolate cake with berries.  Everyone loved it!

This is my family's fav summer dessert. I do place a layer of strawberries mixed with a small amount of glaze on top of the cooled cake. Also, have been using Cool whip frosting from this site. It holds up better than just cool whip.

I used a Butter Recipe cake mix. I also beat 3 ozs cream cheese with a couple of tablespoons of sugar and added it to the whipped topping to give it a little more body. Thanks for the decorating idea, made a nice July 4th presentation! I'm sharing my photo.

Made this for a fourth of july party. By the end of the party the cake was all gone. Everyone loved it and thought it was really cute (even though it's not as pretty as some others on here). Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I looked over all of the reviews, and created into my own. First off, in the past when I have made this, it always seems to overflow the dish, so I baked the cake and transfered into a larger dish to decorate. I covered the cake with a can of strawberry and a can of blueberry pie filling. Then covered that with the cool whip blend doubled (16oz cool whip, 2tsp vanilla, 2 cups milk, 2 small boxs instant vanilla pudding). I decorated that with fresh blueberries and strawberries. It was a huge hit and well enjoed by all!

Simple, pretty, nothing particularly unique however.  Do make sure your berries are well-drained after slicing, or you will have a drippy mess on your cake top!  Nice for a party, not too heavy in the summer.

This was super easy and cheap :) the longest part was letting the cake cool. I recommend using a rectangular pan. I didn't think about that til afterwards. It just would've looked better. Don't skimp on the whipped cream.

Great recipe and super cute! I added 1 package vanilla pudding mix, 2 tsp. vanilla extract 1 cup of milk & 2 Tbsp. brown sugar to the icing like some others had suggested which was perfect. Next year, I'll use angel food cake instead of yellow cake...I think that'd be worthy of 5 stars.

Great twist on an old favorite. I made exactly as directed. It was super easy and quite tasty. If you wanted you could make the cake from scratch for an even more home-made flavor. But as-is, it's good!

Used this recipe for my son's cub scout - mother and son bake off with a theme of "Patriotism". We did not win but a cake exactly like mine won :o)) Same as the other suggestions I used the cool whipped frosting recipe on this site too and it turned out nice and tasty. Thank you for the recipe!

I pretty much made this festive cake, except I used angelfood cake.  Although the angelfood made the cake really airy & refreshing, I didn't exactly have the proper sized pans because it won't cook in 1 "standard" 9x13 cake pan.  I improvized by using 2 loaf pans, so my rectangle flag was a little square shaped.  So, just be aware that if you want to go with angelfood, just check your pan sizes ahead of time.  Happy 4th of July!!!

Fun festive treat, got lots of compliments. Super easy, and I even let my 4 year old put the blueberries on. She loved it. I think this will become a 4th of July tradition!

I made this for two 4th of July parties this year.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  The second time, I used chocolate cake and it was even better.  I definitely will make again.

LOVED this!! I did as another poster said and used the COOL WHIP FROSTING, instead of just plain cool whip and it was EXCELLENT and oh, so easy! I didn't make an American flag because my family wanted the blueberries and strawberries mixed on the top. I loaded it down with strawberries and had a ton of the two pints it called for left over. (we did slice thinly) I'm so thankful for you sharing this recipe. So much tastier with fresh baked cake then those stiff yellow pre-made cakes you can buy for strawberry shortcake in your grocer! I will make this again.

Rather than make this cake from a boxed mix, we did it from scratch. My youngest granddaughters, ages 4 and 6, and I had so much fun making it. We used frozen blueberries and fresh strawberries. The girls didn't seem to mind the time it took me to cut the strawberries because they were busy chopping pecans that would go into and on top of the cake before it went into the oven. To make this an extra special occasion, pictures were taken of the girls gathered around their 92-yr old great grandma who held and displayed our pride and joy (the cake). Did we like the cake? You be the judge - pictures of the finished cake were done by 3:00 pm. The girls' Mom arrived at 7:00 and ate the last piece before returning home.

Delicious! I made this for our 4th of July BBQ and it was a big hit! Everyone thought it tasted like twinkies. The young kids had fun helping me decorate it. The only change I made was to use heavy whipping cream and made our own by adding a tsp. of sugar and vanilla! Will definitely make again! Thanks!

For a great way to get a beginner, in the kitchen that wants to do something fun, is this recipe. One of my kids wanted to make something for a gathering and I suggested this because it's quick, fun and easy. And boy did she have fun making it. Now she was requested to make again but with a chocolate cake for someone's birthday. Made the cake even cooler was adding red and blue sprinkles into the cake mix made it sparkle holiday fun. Thanks again, we will totally make again. But sans the homemade whip topping. ;-)

I have made this cake for over 15 years.  I use white cake instead and add some color, flavor and texture by using a berry gelatin mix mixed with one cup hot water.  I poke holes in cooled cake and pour gelatin mix over and refridgerate over night before adding cool-whip and decorations.

I make a cake like this on all holiday pot-lucks. The only change is, I make my own yellow cake. I also bake it in a 13x9 pan. The whipped topping is a perfect icing. It holds up very well to room temperature. It also isn't too sweet like traditional icing. 13x9 pans, now sometimes come with covers. It makes it nice and easy to store before of after a party too.

Great and easy recipe.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used chocolate cake.  EXCELLENT.  The taste of chocolate cake and cool whip with the berries is excellent.  Be sure to cut the strawberries consistently to ensure the rows are even.

This cake tasted great and was fun to make with the kids. Very patriotic! Next time, however, I will use a large cool whip because it was a thin layer when we were done and that left it a little dry! I think I will also split the cake in half and place a layer of strawberries and whipped cream between the layers, then top with the extra cool whip and American flag decorations.

I made this the night before a 4th of July BBQ, and I was worried it might get mushy or the fruit might color the frosting overnight, but it turned out really good.  In fact, I thought I overbaked my cake (used the convection feature for the first time ever), but it was quite moist and tasty when I got it out of the refrigerator the next day.  
I am not a big fan of Cool Whip, so like several other reviewers, I used the Cool Whipped Frosting from this site, and it was wonderful. 
I served it cold at a pool party, and we all thought it was very refreshing!

This was great!  Made it for a party and got raves.  Will make for another party soon.  Different people but I am sure they will like it too.  I used real whipped cream.  I thought this took the cake up a notch.

THIS RECIPE MAKES UP VERY QUICKLY. I USED A WHITE CAKE MIX AND ADDED A BOX OF VANILLA INSTANT PUDDING. T MADE A WHIPPED CREAM, CREAMCHEESE FROSTING AND IT HELD UP FOR THE 4TH AND THE PART I FROZE WAS STILL PERFECT.

I just made this for 4th of July and divided the batter into 2 8" square cake pans. So instead of making a flag for the decoration I made a star. Outlined it with blueberries and filled with sliced strawberries. It was fantastic! Really did taste like shortcake - maybe because when the cake is refrigerated it takes on more of a shortcake texture. Anyway, it was delish! And my whole family enjoyed. Even the little ones from ages 4-9. Thanks for a great, simple and easy recipe! Mema328

My daughter and I made this cake for the 4th of July this year.  She decorated it all by herself and it looked amazing.  She got a lot of compliments on it.  

Taste - it was sooooo moist.  Absolutely delicious!  We used a Betty Crocker box mix and followed the directions exactly on the box.  One 8 oz container of cool whip is just enough to do the job too.  

Definitely, a keeper recipe for us!

This is one of my favorite holiday desserts! I haven't had a piece is years, and I'm really looking forward to making it this year. I think I might substitute angel food cake instead of yellow cake.

My kids (now 11 & 9) love making this cake.  This is our 5th year making it.  We use angel food cake to make it very light and airy.   It's so easy, the only thing I do at this point is take it out of the oven.  He does blueberries, she does strawberries, low and behold they're working together and it's a day without fights!!  They love the compliments they get when we bring it to the party also!

This is a great recipe.  We also use it for Valentine's day for the grandkids.  Just slice strawberries to make it look like hearts, dip in a little lemon juice to stay fresh. Lay on paper towel to catch extra juice & lay them on top the cool whip.  They love it.  You can also let them help decorate.  Even my  kids love it.

This was very easy to make. I make my own whipped cream with heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract. It is very patriotic and perfect for the 4th.

I made this cake as others suggested using instant pudding in the cool whip frosting.  It was a fan favorite for the fourth of July.  Instead of using a white or yellow cake, I used a lemon cake that made this dessert refreshing and off set the sweet from the fruit and sugar.  Overall, a very good cake.

Nom nom nom. We used a yellow cake and followed the recommendation to use the Whip Cream Vanilla frosting....take the 8oz of cool whip, fold a package of instant vanilla pudding, 1c milk and 1 tsp of vanilla and it was so perfect. Not just for the 4th....all sorts of fruits can be used....kiwi, blackberry, raspberry, boysenberry - etc. We kept the left over frosting for a dip. Super moist and delicious cake!

I made this last 4th of July for our family get together, and it was great! I only made one change: I put a layer of fresh sliced strawberries on the cake before frosting it with the whipped cream. I will definitely be making it again this year!

This cake was delicious. I followed some of the other reviews and poked holes in the cake and added strawberry gelatin mixed with 1 cup of hot water. I refrigerated cake overnight and frosted with cool whip the next day plus added strawberries. Not a fan of blueberries so I used blue decorative icing to draw stars.

My daughters ( 11yrs & 9yrs)made this cake all by themselves for the fourth of July. It's an easy cake for kids and beginning chefs to do. It tastes great too :)

I baked the cake as directed, allowed to cool, poked holes with shish kebab skewer, and spread top with strawberry glaze: 2/3 c strawberry jelly & 1 t lemon juice, stirred together in saucepan over low heat till jelly dissolves. Then cover glaze with whipped topping & fruit.

I made this for our annual July 4th party. It went quickly and everyone loved it. I substituted the yellow cake mix and used white which uses egg whites instead of whole eggs. Yummy!

First time making this cake and it was a hit! Everyone loved it. I did take others advise and used the frosting with the pudding in the mix and im glad i did. I also used a vanilla cake box mix and it was yummy.

This was my first cake ever. I decided this year to be daring and do something new for the Fourth. Because I am a newbee to baking I messed up the first layer because of impatience and excitment. My hubby said:"Baby, let it cool in the oven and calm down." :-) Second layer fell right out. The only thing I did different was I thought an orange cake would compliment the blueberries and strawberries and it did! I did use the cool whip and pudding recipe that I found on this site. Next time I'm going to use the white chocolate pudding. Nothing like chocolate and fruit! I love this website.

Really pretty cake!  I used a German Choc box cake, and the COOL WHIPPED FROSTING from this site.  I took other's advice and made a layer cake, using the cool whipped frosting (doubled the recipe) and put strawberries and blueberries in the middle layer.  I used French Vanilla pudding with the frosting - DUH, forgot that pudding was yellow, so we had a yellow, red, and blue cake. :D  Yummy and fun, nothing fancy. Will definitely make again!

Perfect for the holiday. Everyone loved it. I made it with a funfetti angle food cake and it worked perfectly. Nice and light for a hot summer night.

Was a big hit at our picnic.  I made this as a poke cake with strawberry jello and frosted with a recipe I had that is sour cream, powdered sugar and cool whip.

WOW!  This was a definite hit w/the kids.  Followed recipe as written with one exception.  As another had done, I poked holes in cake after it came out of oven and poured 1 can (14 oz) of fat free sweetened condensed milk over the top.  AWESOME DESSERT!!!!!

I was looking to make a quick dessert and I happened to have all these things on hand! All my guests thought the flag was adorable, and devoured it, but I personally thought it was missing just a little something, although I cannot think of what that something is. It tasted good, in the future I will make my own cake batter. I don't like box cake.

Served this to the twins and Charlie, Will, Blake, Manny and Laurel, Em and Mark, plus me, Ray, & Emily Gilpin for the Fourth.  Manny and Mark cooked burgers, brats and hot dogs, we added a few sides, the twins made this cake, staying with Cool Whip instead of real whipped cream, like we usually do - it still was good.

Such an easy and fun cake!  Everyone at my 4th of July party loved it.  I made a yellow cake from scratch, but I'm sure a packaged yellow cake would taste great too.  The decoration on it was adorable, a huge hit, and incredibly easy! I only needed about half the pint of blueberries, and used a little less strawberries than what was called for, but they made cute extras for a side of extra fruit!

This cake couldn't have been easier to make and yet, it couldn't have been a bigger hit!  The only problem I encountered was when the whipped cream topping started to melt because the cake had not fully cooled when I tried to ice it.  I was in a hurry so I didn't take the time to carefully arrange the strawberries and blueberries, but it still ended up looking great.  I think this cake will become a 4th of July tradition.

I made this first on the 4th and it was gone an hour into serving it. I made it again yesterday, and to make it easier to serve. I used a non-stick flour based baking spay to avoid sticking, and I pre-cut before I put the whipped cream on it to make it much easier to serve. So Good.

I make it with white cake mix instead of yellow. I also made this with a strawberry & blueberry "compote"ish like filling on top of the cake. I placed that on after it cooled. I made it like one does any "compote" Then I layered the whipped topping and added the berries for decorative purposes. My family and friends ATE IT UP!!! It's a really good recipe. Like any other it just needs your personal touch. :)

So moist and light! I added orange zest to the cake mix in the form of Doterra's wild orange essential oil. Gave it a nice citrus kick.

I made it with a super moist white cake mix and did homemade whip topping since no one in my house like Cool Whip. Turned out light and very moist. Everyone love3d it. It was gone by the end of the evening.

Excellent presentation!  Just made this for a Memorial Day BBQ. The kids got a huge kick out of a flag cake. I used a double chocolate cake (what I had on hand) instead and the cool whip frosting from this site. Everyone enjoyed it! Thank you for a quick recipe which looks like I spent an hour making!

The 4th is ALWAYS a busy day. People coming and going, to the park and back, fire works and a million dishes on the table! I wanted to make a delicious patriotic desert but also didn't want to be tied up in the kitchen long. This was perfect and I think I'll make it every year! I made the cake the night before (while its cool enough to fire up the oven), frosted it the next morning and put the berries on about a half hour before guests started to arrive. I also made the frosting with the vanilla pudding mix as others suggested. I put rows in strawberries and blueberries instead of making a flag. It still looked very patriotic and every bite had a strawberry and blueberry. I got tons of compliments. I mean...this isn't my Grandpas famous apple pie or my Grandmas famous sugar cookies...but it IS a quick, attractive tasty cake for a 4th of July BBQ!

I added zest of one lemon and used cream cheese frosting instead of cool-whip. Don't rinse the berries, it makes the frosting all goopy. Everyone loved it, though!

I made this last evening ...for 4th of July brunch.  I used 2 pound cake mixes & took the advice of CHICK and poked holes in cooled cake and filled with concentrated strawberry jello.  The jello added a lot more berry flavor. Yummmm...everyone dug right in and ate every morsel.

I basically used the recipe but I added additional strawberries with sugar (so it made a syrup) and put it on the cake before I frosted with the whipped topping.  Then added the flag blueberries & strawberries on top.

This recipe is very plain and simple.  My recipe uses two boxes yellow cake mix baked in jelly roll pan. Whipping cream with powdered sugar and chopped strawberries goes between layers, frost with whipped cream, then use 50 blueberries in upper corner, sliced bananas dipped in lemon juice for one row; alternate rows using strawberry halves to make the stars and stripes.  It is huge and feeds a group on July 4th and tastes like a gourmet strawberry shortcake ala Independence Day. Change to two boxes yellow cake mix, 2 pints heavy whipping cream, use wax paper on jelly roll pan, grease paper.

This was OK...I would probably have liked it better if I had not added the vanilla and pudding to the Cool Whip as other reviewers suggested. That added a real artificial taste to it. Next time I will stick with the recipe...I have made this before as written and the Cool Whip alone is just OK on top, which is why I opted for the moderations this time. Either way it's just a 3 star recipe.

It would have been good, but not fantastic with just the cool-whip topping, but I would give 5-stars with the suggestion from Bette to add pudding, milk, and vanilla to the topping.  It was just the extra touch needed to make it special for the holiday!

Oh, and we're a family of raspberry lovers so I used raspberries instead of sliced strawberries.  The key is to wash them well ahead of time and keep turning them in the collander to make sure the water drains out so they're ready to put on your cake.

I loved making this because it was easy to decorate. Instead of using cool whip for the frosting I used butter cream because I am not fond of cool whip for a frosting on cakes. It's a very festive idea for when your feeling patriotic or for a special occasion like today which is the 4th of July. I made this for a party.

I made this cake a long time ago. I put strawberries into the cake as well as decorate it on top. It was a HUGE hit and gone by the end of the day. Pretty and festive, with fresh fruit, you can't go wrong and its's so easy to make.

Awesome cake! I used yellow cake mix. I used 3/4 cup milk, and 1/4 cup water (instead of 1 cup water) and added a cup of jello vanilla pudding. Amazing
