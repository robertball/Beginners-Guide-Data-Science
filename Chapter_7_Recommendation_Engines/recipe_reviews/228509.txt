I made this for lunch today. Heaven in a bowl. NOTE: Honestly, I ate half as is and half with a small amount of quality balsamic drizzled over the top. Even more delicious.

Lovely!  I made these into little kabobs.  Placed on a plate, drizzled a bit of olive oil & balsamic vinegar & then sprinkled the basil on top.  Everyone loved them.

Love Caprese! I served this salad in a small dessert dish with shredded romaine on the bottom and the Caprese Salad on top. A splash of white balsamic would be great with this.

I make Caprese all the time. I chop the tomatoes and the mozzarella and tear the basil so it's easier to have a forkful with all 3 ingredients. It is also MUCH better with a balsamic vinaigrette instead of just olive oil. I make this with olive oil from Frances Mays' estate and a wonderful quality balsamic from the vinegar store. There isn't anything better.

This salad rocks.  We made it for Christmas dinner, and even people who thought they wouldn't like a "basil" salad, loved it!  Defiantly a five star salad, and I encourage anyone who has never tried a caprese salad to try it.

I love all things Caprese! This is plain, simple and delicious! I usually arrange the items on a plate, but it was great in a bowl! Added a few drops of balsamic vinegar, but I think it's fresher and better without it sometimes. Thanks Summer Rose!

Followed the recipe and added fresh avocado chunks. yum! My kids and hubby liked it. :) Now that I think about it, some black olives would have been good too.

I tried to post a review yesterday with my photo but only the photo went up. So here we go a second time. This is a delicious classic recipe that doesnâ€™t need any changes , but using what I had from my garden I did make a couple. I used yellow sunburst cherry tomatoes and a blend of red/green Italian basil with a good fresh mozzarella. Right before serving I added a drizzle of good balsamic vinegar over each serving. Great as a salad side to a nice steak or chicken, and for a wholesome lunch the next day. It holds up well if you just use the oil.

Real simple and quick.  I would recommend cutting tomatoes in halves.  Using fresh basil is the best.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for.  I love it and make it weekly.  The mozzarella cheese gives it just the right zip.
