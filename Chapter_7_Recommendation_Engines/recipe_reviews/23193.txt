This was quite easy & a very satisfying soup.  Mashing up some of the potatoes makes for a great consistency.  I really appreciate a potato soup recipe with no milk or cream.  And I love lemon, so this is an ideal recipe in my book!  The only thing I may do differently next time is add some scallions. Thanks for a great soup!

I felt that this soup should of had a more lemony flavor to it.  However, mashing the potatoes did make the soup better.  Next time, i would add more lemon and perhaps more spices.

This is a great base soup.  I've made it several times and like to add scallions, bacon, lemon zest, or whatever suits the situation!

Very nice soup. Low fat, Low calorie. Lemon is well balanced with potato so it's not too tart. This recipe is a keeper.

Followed recipe - no changes but it was too much lemon.  Very disappointed because it smelled good cooking.

It needed something else so I added 2/3 cup fresh chopped parsley and that did it

I skipped the chicken bouillon and made it vegetarian with only water. I also sauteed the garlic, potato and celery in a bit of olive oil before adding the liquid. Overal it was a good soup, the turmeric really gives it a nice colour and taste.

This was a miss for us. We made a half recipe, were less than impressed, and the leftovers were thrown away after sitting in the fridge for a couple of days. It was edible but not worth going out of your way to make.

I made this with a vegetable bouillon cube instead of chicken. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe. It was a good soup, but I might add a little cayenne next time to give it some more "zip."
