Anybody can make this chicken pot pie, and it's actually really good! The crescent rolls make a nice, flaky crust. I do think it needs two cans of soup, especially if you are using two cans of vegetables. I used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken because that's what I had on hand...

This is more like chicken PAN pie to me, because when I make it, I use a baking dish since I don't have a pie dish. I used all of the same ingredients listed and it tastes excellent! So simple yet so good. The crescent rolls make it a special dish really, cause they're so light and add flavor. I only ever use one can of cream of chicken, but I'll add a little milk to the empty can, swish it around and pour that over the filling if it needs a tiny bit extra sauciness.

this was pretty good. The only thing I would do differently next time is either make my own crust (since that is my favorite part) or at least buy a frozen crust.  I'm not crazy about the croissant topping.  But like I said a yummy crust is my favorite part of a chicken pot pie.

This is one of my favorite recipes ever! I've made it so many times and my husband loves it. I however like bottom and top crust so I usually  get another pack of croissants for the bottom and cook it for just a little while before I add the ingredients. It's delicious!

I made this, but I made a more complicated version, because I didn’t have canned ingredients on hand. I cut up and cooked the chicken (a couple of chicken breast cutlets and two boneless, skinless thighs) with some salt, pepper, and thyme. I used frozen vegetables and frozen diced hash browns, and cooked them both before baking. I used cream of celery soup and some milk. It came out great, and my husband asked me to add it to my regularly-made dishes.

Very easy and quick.  I added leftover grilled chicken breast and fresh vegetables I sautéed.  I added the broth from the canned chicken.  Very savory and filling.  We really liked it and I would even serve for a potluck or company dinner.

It's not what pot pie is in my mind.
