This recipe is also good prepared with boneless chicken breasts, marinated overnight and then broiled.

This is one of the most delicious chicken recipes I've tasted!  I used curry powder instead of curry paste, and added some rice and a little more salt to make it a main course meal.  Very nice!

Delicious and easy.  I followed recipe to the letter and it turned out great - only one word of advice - cook this on a day that you can keep windows open - I cooked it the day of NYC's blizzard this year - my house smelled of curry for five days since it was too cold to open the windows to air the house out! This recipe is a keeper though.

I was looking for a chicken recipe that didn't have very many ingredients.  This fit the bill!  I marinated chicken thighs and drumsticks cut into quarters and halves respectively.  I was concerned that the chicken might be bland and I marinated for 24 hours.  It was wonderful!  I fried as stated in the directions.  I don't think this would be as moist and good with breast meat.  I am rating it a 4 because I felt the marinate was missing some heat and a fresh zing.  I will try again by adding some lemon juice, some finely chopped jalepeno, and maybe a little cilantro to the marinade.

Absolutely stunning! I was worried that it would turn out to be a dry dish, but the chicken was extremely succulent. I will be recommending this recipe to all my friends. Served with rice, it makes an excellent main course. This has become my new favourite recipe, and it is so, so simple to make!

We loved this tasty and unique fried chicken. The ingredients alone were unusual enough to tempt me to try to it. I and my family are happy I did.

My husband and I loved this chicken! So simple, yet with a very intense flavor.  I used boneless chicken breasts that I cubed, marinated and stir-fried.  Served with rice and steamed broccoli and had a wonderful dinner!  Thank you.

this is one easy and delicious recipe. My sister and I loved it and we will be adding it to our favorites.  The only thing i changed was I used 3 tbsp of soy sauce and 1 1/2 tbsp hoisin sauce.. (the only reason was because i didnt have oyster sauce on hand) It still turned out great! we'll be making this again and again.. next time i'll try to use oyster sauce. Thank you so much for sharing this easy breezy recipe.. :D

So simple, yet so good!  I took another reviews advice and added a few things to the marinade:  a splash of lemon juice (lime would be great also) and a tiny bit of jalapeno (I didnt want it too hot) and some cilantro.  Then, when I was stir-frying the chicken, I decided to throw in some sliced onion, green pepper, and even some zuccini I had sitting in the crisper.  Then for the ultimate in laziness, I didnt even bother making more white rice; I just threw in some leftover I had and it was almost like a fried rice plate.  More cilantro and green onion to top.  It was really delicious!

this is a really nice dish if you're looking for something new to do with chicken. i used breast filets cut into strips, thats just what i had in my freezer, and fried it in a big cast iron skillet since i dont have a wok, and it turned out well, but i think itd be more moist with bone-in chicken. I also didnt add as much curry powder, but only because i had my youngest nephew and he wouldnt have eaten it. Turned out to be a hit sevred with some fried rice and a fresh salad, and his mom is asking me for the recipe now ;). But when i fix it for myself I'll add all the curry, as well as some hot sauce.

The smell of the fried curry oyster sauce is intoxicating. It's best to fry this dish as I tried stir frying, while it smelled good, it didn't have the same impact. Crispiness is where it's at. I have made this recipe a few times already.

Maybe I made this wrong? I followed the directions exactly, even marinaded the chicken a little longer, but it didn't yield a powerful flavor. In fact, my husband and I couldn't taste much of anything.

5 Stars because it tastes great, and is one of the easiest dishes to prepare. It is one of the few dishes that taste better than smells while you are cooking it.

When a friend of mine was moving, she was trying to empty her kitchen cabinets of items she never used.  She ended up giving me all kinds of ingredients that I have never used before.  One of these was oyster sauce.  I did a search on All Recipes for a simle recipe that incorporated oyster sauce, and this is what I found.  This recipe is simple, easy, and tastes fantastic.  I am a huge fan of curry (it's very good for you and increases your metabolism) and I turned my husband into a huge fan as well.  One word of caution:  when you make this, be certain to open all of the windows in your house first.  My house smelled like curry for a week after I made this!  Not a terrible thing, just something you may not want.  :)

This chicken was full of flavor, I loved the combo of the oyster sauce, curry and garlic. I wish I had marinated longer even overnight. I also think that next time I will put my chicken in the oven or on the charcoal grill, it just seems to me that that would be better. Don't get me wrong this was good last night, but with the changes I will make next time I think then I would rate it 5 stars EXCELLENT MARINADE THOUGH!!!.

My chicken pieces were really big, and I was nervous about pan-frying them, so I did them in the oven. The flavor was very good. I agree it would work with boneless chicken breasts or maybe pork. Thanks, Saadiah!

Absolutely fantastic recipe. Easy to make and doesn't make a mess of the kitchen. Just signed up for an account to rate this. Changes I made : Added garlic paste instead of chopped garlic, added a touch of cayenne pepper and people who want little more sweeter chicken can add a tsp of sugar too. I used chicken wings and it was amazingly good. Thanks for this recipe :)

Really liked it although I tweaked it just a bit. I didn't feel like cutting all the garlic, so I used a garlic,ginger, chili paste we had made a few weeks ago to preserve our garden chilis. Turned out really well with a little kick to it. The only thing I didn't like was you had to watch closely as the oyster sauce would caramalize and burn while frying.

So delicious and tender! We marinated the chicken for an hour and a half, baked it at 350 degrees for 1/2 hour in a basted pan (with canola oil), and broiled it for 5 minutes, turning it once so it would brown evening. You gotta watch the broiling -- it really cooks fast! That said, this chicken was everything and more we thought it would be! It was like tandoori and curry together, with crisp skin. It will definitely become a staple in our house. Thanks, Saadiah! It's amazing.

my husband loved it more than I did. It was a catcher I must say. It's a nice variation from the usual fried chicken I make at home. Thanks, Saadiah!

Loved this! I don't ever cook with curry, but I've been looking to experiment. This dish is flavorful, easy and definitely worth making again and again.

This was super easy and delicious! I sauteed broccoli and mushrooms in the same sauce and served with vermicelli. The result was fantastic! I wonder if anybody can recommend me one or two good side dishes that go well with this meal.

EXCEPTIONAL recipe! I cook a lot of ethnic food with a focus on authentic indigenous flavors, and I can testify that this dish is completely irresistible, simple and carefree and so perfectly Malaysian - a blend of multicultural tastes that is unique and amazing. you know that dish on Chinese buffets advertised as "smoked" chicken chunks that have a savory, sweet, slightly-sticky delicious brownness without a glaze or sauce? this is quite reminiscent of that recipe. I cut boneless chicken breasts into large chunks and put it in the marinade (and forgot it) in a bag in the fridge for 2 days, and it *still* came out moist, tender and with an amazing flavor that was smokey, sweet, exotic and aromatic. I agree that you should do this on a day you can open your windows as the smoking curry in the marinade when it cooks in the oil can be strong (although the taste of the chicken does not come out with a strong curry flavor). Tip: you can set out a bowl of white vinegar which will dissipate the odor in a couple hours. I do agree this should be pan-fried for crispness on the outside, but be careful of the oil and heat being too high or the chicken can char easily. served this with jasmine rice, salad and some fresh fruit (mango and pineapple with calamansi/honey/ginger dressing) and it was superb! Terima kasih to you and your mother, Saadiah!

This was a tasty and unusual twist on fried chicken. I loved the fact that the chicken is not breaded. Be sure not to get the oil too hot, or it will darken the chicken to where it almost looks black. I marinated the chicken overnight in the oyster sauce, curry, garlic mixture for more flavor.

Really good! I used boneless chicken thighs and added the juice of one lime and some ginger - was outstanding on the grill! Use a good quality curry powder - it makes all the difference.

I’ve had Malaysian fried chicken in Malaysia. This is not what it taste like. Not much flavor. Chicken tasted good though.

Used soy sauce and sesame oil as I didn't have oyster sauce on hand. Added cayenne, paprika, Chinese five spice, garam masala, ginger and doubled the garlic. Fantastic!

Made this tonight since I hadn't done grocery shopping and it was so simple. MY FAMILY LOVED IT! It's now on of their favorite foods and my husband suggested I put it in the recipe book of family favorites that they would be willing to eat often. I did add some red pepper to give it a bit of a kick but I have a feeling that it would be great without it.

The curry powder, oyster sauce, and garlic combo is a great and quick marinade! I used it on pork and chicken. My family loves this!!
