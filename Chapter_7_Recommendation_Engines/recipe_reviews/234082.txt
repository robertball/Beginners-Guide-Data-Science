Delicious and filling!! I made this soup in the croc pot with a few changes. I used a package of Hillshire Farms roast beef and a package of shredded Parmesan-Reggiano cheese.  

The only step I would change is when adding the flour, which is needed to thicken the soup up. I seasoned the flour first with pepper and garlic powder. My mistake was adding all the flour at once (I had to whisk the soup like crazy to dissolve the flour clumps that formed). I would save a 1/2 cup of milk and whisk the flour into that and then add it to the soup. 

I cooked the soup on high for 5 hours and added the cheese/flour  1  3/4 of an hour before the soup was done.

I'd give the recipe as is 4 stars, however, I doubled the cheese, added the beef with the cheese and simmered for 20 minutes and added extra beef stock, salt, pepper, garlic, and Italian seasoning and it was wonderful. It just needs some doctoring up. Great base recipe and a fantastic idea!

It’s a good hearty soup, maybe a little too thick and cheesy.

The only thing different I did was  I used Evaporated milk instead of regular milk.    Which gave it a little more body and and thickness.  So glad i did  or else the soup would have been to watery (thin).   Husband like it -thought it needed a little extra salt and pepper.   The mushrooms were awesome in this!!!!   Wish there was more.   As is --great base--loved all the stuff that was put it but seemed to lack flavor---did not have a "beef" flavor at all---seemed like all i tasted was  cheese.   If i make it again---i will have to tweek---more beef--another green pepper and another onion and MORE mushrooms.           Evaporated milk for.

Great way to use up leftover roast. I did find that it needed garlic though but once I added that it was awesome.  We left the buns on the side

My husband worked for a company in Utah that had a chef come in to prepare lunch each week.  This chef made this soup at the office one day and my husband liked it so much that brought what was left of the soup home.  I was hooked from the first bite.  I begged my husband to ask the chef for this recipe, told him to do whatever it took as I NEEDED this recipe.  The chef was kind enough to write out the recipe by hand and it’s been a favorite of my family ever since.  The recipe that I was given is exactly the same as this one.   The soup is absolutely mouth watering-ly perfect exactly as written, no changes need to be made.  I crave this soup often.

Loved it! I added the flour after sautéing the vegetables, sort of making a roux, before adding the milk. Had no problem with lumps. Added some seasoning (I use Savory Spice blends). Really tasty lunch.

Great recipe but I made some changes. I doubled up the onion and green pepper to make it heartier. In addition to the roast beef I sautéed some thinly cut steak with steak seasoning on it and added it. I also cut back on the flour because of all the extras I added, I didn’t want it too thick. I ended up adding Montreal steak seasoning to it once everything was added to give it a little kick. It was a huge hit in my house!

While I thought this soup was ok... Overall, I thought it was pretty bland.
