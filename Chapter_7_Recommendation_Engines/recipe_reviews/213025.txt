A great idea for a New Year treat!  I didn't have peppers, so I sauteed the onion and garlic, then added black eyed peas, canned mushrooms and a ton of swiss chard.  A little seasoning topped it off.  Served over a bed of rice, this was superb -- and super easy.  Great for someone who really doesn't care for black eyed peas too much.

Used green peppers instead of red and onion powder instead of an actual onion (Hubby doesn't care for onions).  Also added several more leaves of swiss chard...we like our greens!

Love this recipe! I added diced mushrooms, and sauteed them with the onions, garlic, and olice oil before adding the beans and rice.  I also substituted baby spinach for swiss chard because that's what I had on hand.  Came out great! Two meat eaters gave it rave reviews and said if they didn't know if was a vegetarian recipe, they wouldn't have guessed.

Great vegetarian version of stuffed peppers! I did cook the rice in beef broth, next time I may use mushroom broth to "beef" it up & keep it truly vegetarian. I also added stewed tomatoes to the black eyed pea mixture, as it appeared a bit dry for stuffing and baked the peppers in tomato juice as I like a saucy stuffed pepper. I didn't garnish it with cheese, but my husband thought it needed it...something his Mom did I suppose. Thank you MOTTSBELA for sharing your recipe! I agree with other reviews about a great way to use black eyed peas, but also my overabundance of swiss chard.

recipe is pretty bland and dry. I cooked the rice in vegetable stock, used 1/2 mild salsa and 1/2 water mix rather than all water. rather than baking the peppers I parboiled them, Dropped them into boiling water for 3 or 4 minutes. black beans and kale were my other substitutes because that was what I had on hand. my vegetarian friend gave them 5 stars.

Really liked this recipe. I used vegetable stock to cook the rice and after it had cooked a little I added Rotel tomatoes with green chilies. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Will make again.

An excellent little recipe.  Just minor taste changes made.  Orange pepper, white rice ( was a left over so already cooked heated with a little chicken broth so mixture wasn't quite so dry) after combining rice and bean mixture and putting in the pepper half, sprinkled some Parmesan cheese on top and

Really like this!  So did my family. A whole pepper stuffed was kind of a large serving for some.  Maybe next time I will serve them up sliced in half.  Because of timing and only 1 oven I cook my peppers earlier in the day.  They took about 30 minutes to cook.  I put them back in the oven for about 10 minutes before stuffing. I added the Parmesan cheese as suggested and used green peppers. Will cook this again! for sure!

I was really looking forward to making this recipe, but it was really disappointing. Didn't have much flavor and the stuffing was really dry.

As a side dish the filling is great but I'm not convinced that it pairs well with a cooked red bell pepper. I used pinkeye purple hull peas instead of blackeyed peas which I prefer and substituted kale for the Swiss chard because I had some on hand.  As a filling it seems to need some type of sauce most likely tomato-based or a creamy mushroom. I could also see using different type beans such as black beans and doing a Cuban spin on this with the addition of cumin and cooked green bell pepper. I did say it didn't pair well with the red bell pepper but I think it would be better to have chopped green bell pepper added with the garlic and onion especially if you do the Cuban beans as mentioned before.

Delicious! I cooked my rice in 2 cups of low sodium veggie broth for some extra flavor, used black beans instead of pinto (what I had in the pantry), and used the entire onion and whole bunch of rainbow chard. You can never have too many veggies! I would recommend some hot sauce (cholula, sriracha, etc), or even some cayenne, thrown into the filling. Otherwise, great as-is!

Great recipe! Made a few modifications, I also had to bake the bell peppers for about 40 minutes. I added cumin and cayenne pepper, extra chard, and cilantro just before serving. I also cooked the brown rice with vegetable broth. It was delicious! Will definitely make this again.

I really liked it, but next time I will use twice the garlic. It might  also be good with some sort of sauce...

This was really good. I feel like it just lacked a tiny bit of flavor. I would maybe add some thyme or oregano to it next time, but it was excellent otherwise.
