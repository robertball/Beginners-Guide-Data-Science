My rating is really only based on the cake part. Because based on the previous reviews... I didn't want the lemon in the cheese filling and I am not a fan of nuts. So here is how I made this. I followed the cake instructions step by step except I sifted the dry ingredients and did 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white. For the filling I did 8oz of cream cheese, 1/4 cup of powdered sugar, and 1 tablespoon of melted butter and a half teaspoon of vanilla extract. For the topping I did a streusel. 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 3 tablespoons of room temp butter, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. I sprinkled the crumble mixture on top and baked for 40 minutes. After the cake had completely cooled I put a glaze on top. For the glaze I took 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons of melted butter, 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 2 table spoons of milk. Mix and drop glaze from a spoon on to cake. After making those changes... this is one of the best coffee cakes I have ever had! Next time I will add a little more sugar to the cake and maybe a little almond extract.

My very picky daughter loved this but I thought it had several problems.  The baking time was way off - I really don't know how long I ended up cooking it, and it still was a little underdone. The cake was dense and heavy, just a touch shy of gummy.  The filling was really tart, and, for a second, I thought I forgot to add the confectioners sugar.  The only sweetness to this cake came from the topping.

this recipe was awesome! made it on a cold icky sunday afternoon...it turned out wonderfully. all the ingredients on hand-except for the nuts i could have sworn i had!! instead of the nuts i mixed a couple handfuls of butterscotch chips in with the brown sugar...and that tasted great! i too took some of the reviewer's advice and cut back on the lemon juice&added some vanilla to the cream cheese filling. hubby took the rest of it to work monday to keep it out of my reach (i'd asked him to, lol); it was gone in no time. thanks for this recipe!

I took this to breakfast fellowship at our church. My son said it looked so good and tasted so good that his friends thought I had bought it. There must be a compliment in there some place.

Easy and delicious! Next time I will leave out the lemon juice, too tart for my taste.  Also I had to bake the cake for 50 minutes before it was done.  The cake was moist and light.  I will make this again and again.

It was OK... I thought the batter didn't have much flavor after baking (although, it tasted great beforehand). I liked the filling though. It needs "lots of glaze," according to my husband. 

I don't think I'll make it again - I'll make something with more of a fruit filling next time.

Well, I tried this out today and it was great.  Mine also took longer to bake (50 minutes).  Hubby liked it alot, too because it had just the right sweetness and he even liked the tartness of the filling.  I would have prefered it to be less tart and more sweet =).  I left out the cinamon-pecan topping as hubby doesn't like cinamon.  I might just dust with powdered sugar next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe asked for the "topping" to be added after the cake batter was put in the pan.  But I was using a decorative bundt pan, so that would have put the topping on the bottom of the cake.  Instead, I baked the cake before adding the topping.  After removing it from the pan, I put a glaze on top (recipe from another reviewer) and added this recipe's topping with that.  It was delicious and beautiful!

I brought this to work and it was a hit! I did have to mix the topping with a glaze to get it to stick to the top. I will definitely make this again...soon!

I really enjoy this recipe, however I add 2 tbsp. of Bailey's Irish Cream in stead of lemon juice and 1 8oz pkg of cream cheese. I also found I have to cook it much longer 45 mins is best. My family devours it every time.

It was good but I added some blueberries and some lemon zest to the cake batter. I would have liked more sugar in the filling. It was too tart for my taste.

Very good.  I will increase the amount of filling next time I make this as one of the previous bakers suggested.  Mine also took longer to bake.  45-50 min.

The cake was good.  The filling had a bit too much tartness from the lemon juice so I'd cut back on that some.  I'd let it sit longer in the pan after the recommended cooling time.  It was difficult to transfer to a plate nicely with the filling not completely cooled!  :)  Yummy though.
