I love Kielbasa and Sauerkraut but I wanted something different. I thought I'd try this recipe since it's close but not exactly like a recipe I love.  

I did not like this at all. There was way too much pasta and not nearly enough sauce.

A quick fix with some of the ingredients I normally use saved the dish from being tossed.   I added about a cup of sour cream with a little milk to thin it, poured it into a casserole and topped it with some shredded cheddar cheese.  

Turned a rather dry and bland dish into a pierogie casserole which was promptly polished off.

had no idea what to cook one night, looked in the fridge and all i saw was kielbasa and sauerkraut, wanted to make it a little different, so i did a search and found this recipe. I'm on the south  beach so I skipped the pasta, but was a HUGE hit anyway! The Dijon mustard is a tasty touch! Highly reccomend.

I'm not a big fan of sauerkraut but I decided to make this for the better half. I loved it! The combonation of pasta and kielbasa tone down the kraut which can overwhelm some recipes.  I think next time I'll add more parsley and perhaps more garlic.

I have made this several times now, the recipe is versatile and lends itself well to additional ingredients as well as increasing proportions. I have added shredded carrots, other veggies, hot sauces, mayo, BBQ sauce, substituted potatoes for pasta, and all 4 teenagers love it every time (and they 'hate' saurkraut!)A definite favorite in our house.

Excellent! One of my all-time favorites and I think it appeals more to German tastes, maybe that's why some didn't think it was a good combination. I thought it was perfect!!!

I followed the recipe precisely and honestly, I thought this was barely edible.  The combination of pasta, kielbasa, and sauerkraut just doesn't blend well.  My husband on the other hand thought it was pretty good.  We both agreed that it looked horrible, more like something you'd feed a dog than a person.  On the positive side, it held up well as left overs (if you can stand to eat it again).

I was excited to try this after reading the great reviews.  It is good not great.  I probably won't make it again.  I like kielbasa with sauerkraut and potatoes a LOT better and it is so much easier to make.

We loved this recipe, and super filling! Made with turkey keilbasa and chicken broth instead of the wine.  I did add 1/4 cup of brown sugar to sweeten up the kraut.  I was a bit nervous to use dijon mustard as the main ingredient for the suace, but it worked well with the kraut.

My husband doesn't like the sauerkraut so he picks it out. but he won't let me make this without it cause he knows how much flavor it adds. I did modify this quite a a bit because I didn't have dijon mustard, cayenne pepper, bell pepper or white wine the first time I made it. i followed the instructions otherwise, but added a little vinegar, garlic powder, beef boullion cube, and extra parsley. Some say this didn't have enough flavor that is why I added it, but really it would have probably been fine without the additions. Didn't expect to like this one, but loved it! You may have to experiment with it. I have occasionally added too much vinegar and had to add other spices to fix it (such as sugar, salt, pepper, etc.)

This is a GREAT recipe -- DELICIOUS --and I don't even like kielbasa or sauerkraut all that much! But the flavors meld beautifully and each is enhanced by the other. I used the small ziti and only about 2/3 of the amount suggested. I also cooked the pasta ahead, so it was even easier to prepare at my busy mealtime. I omitted the cayenne and didn't miss it a bit. If you like Italian cheese, you might like to sprinkle a bit on top. YUMMY!

thought I would try this recipe despite the mix of peppers and pasta with sauerkraut which I thought was an odd combo. Made as written but left out parsely. Found it to taste as odd as I thought.  This recipe left the kraut bitter and though edible - would not make again. Kids didn't care for it either - prefer kraut with potatoes & kielbasa with a little apple or brown sugar to balance the bitterness.

My family loves pasta with sauerkraut and kielbasa.  I do use a low-fat version of kielbasa or smoked sausage.  This receipe is great, but I like to use wide egg noodles.  Half a bag per pound of kielbasa and 1 can of sauerkraut.  This recipe is a keeper for us!

This was excellent.  I used bow tie pasta because I wanted to use it up and a little less mustard.  Don't forget the pinch of cayenne.....it adds just a little "zing" to the dish.  Will keep this in my recipe box to make again one day.

My husband really liked this recipe. His only complaint was my choice of sauerkraut. I will definitely make this again and see if I can find a better brand of sauerkraut.

Everyone in my family enjoyed this dish.  I used spicy andouilli sausage instead of kielbasa and omited the cayenne.  I used a sweet onion.  I also browned the sausage and then added the peppers and onions, so they were a little crunchy.  This will become a regular quick dish for us.  Thanks!

I really liked this.  I substituted frozen cheese filled perogies for the pasta and was quite yummy.  I also used turkey kielbasa for a lower fat meal.

Sounded weird but tastes Outstanding!  My alterations as follows: 6 oz. ziti, 2 tblsp. oil, whole red pepper, 1 lb. turkey smoked kielbasa, 8 oz. sauerkraut (changes were based on other reviews and our personal tastes).  All new recipes should be this good.  When my husband likes a pasta dish, you know something is good!

Followed the recipe, but was not impressed with the outcome.  Took another reviewer's suggestion and used less pasta, added a cup of sour cream and a cup of cheddar cheese after cooking.  Fantastic!  Will defintely keep this recipe for a change of pace at dinnertime.

very good! I accidentally used two peppers and twice the wine and olive oil. I also only had thin spaghetti and it was not too saucy at all. edit: I have made three times now. Once as written and the dish was rather dry then I doubled the sauce and it was perfect.

The "Wenzel" side of me was sure proud of this german style dish.  Added extra mustard, wine, and 2 boulion cubes to really add some flavorful sauce.  Started by cooking some bite sized pieces of pork and a small onion with the kielbasa for extra meat.  Then threw in sliced mushrooms towards the end.  I gotta say it was even better the next day and didn't make it any farther than that!  Very good

I did not expect the dish to taste as it did. While the combination of ingredients was quite eclectic, I thought in some ways, the ever changing flavors of this dish was in a fascinating way, quite mild. AT first, I did not think these ingredients would go together in a 'conventional' way. But in hindsight, the combination is quite natural. Very delicious, I would eat this for desert. I wonder if Gail is the devil, the temptation of this is so subtle.

My husband, who is not a big fan of sauerkraut, quickly fell in love with this dish.  It's become a new family favorite at our house.  I do use the bagged sauerkraut instead of canned, and I use a full 16 oz. to 1 lb. of pasta.  Delicious!!!  I even served this one to my parents when they came to visit and they enjoyed it as well.  Thanks for posting this unusual but oh, so scrumptious recipe!

Good starting point! I made only about half that amount of pasta, left out the white wine and added just a bit of mayo at the end to make it more creamy. I also sprinkled some parmesan cheese on  the finished dish to give it just a bit more flavor :) Definitely appeals to German tastes. It's something different to change up your week!

This is one of my "too tired to cook" go-to recipes.  It is super easy and I usually have all of the ingredients on hand.  I usually add some caraway seed and it is perfection.

Very tasty. The only changes I made were that I used turkey kielbasa that was cooked on the grill and egg noodles.

Give Sauerkraut to a kid and watch their face pucker and it get thrown away .  My kids love this meal and family love this meal.  Lots of flavor and very filling, great for a family sit down.

EXCELLENT!! I made this recipe and my husband raved about it all night long and made me promise that I would start making this at least once every two weeks. I used elbow macaroni instead of the ziti noodles because I didn't have ziti. I didn't wind up putting all the noodles in the recipe. I basically used my judgement on how much to put in to keep it from having too many noodles as other people had suggested. It was sooo good!!

I really thought I was going to love this since I love kielbasa, sauerkraut and pasta, but for some reason this was very bland to us. I cooked it as written too. We had to add hot sauce to finish it. I guess you can't love them all.

We liked this very much. I did change a few things. I don't like bell peppers, so I did not use any at all. I cut and cooked the Kielbasa first, browned it in the skillet with the olive oil and then removed to set aside. I then added the onion and garlic, cooked and then added some beer (used instead of wine) to de-glaze the pan. I then added to Sauerkraut, parsley, mustard (used Boarshead Deli Mustard, has a nice kick) and ceyenne. Mixed well and added more beer. I ended using one 12oz bottle. mixed everything and then added the Kielbasa. Instead of pasta I used sliced, red potaotes (pre-cooked until tender). I added them at the end, to heat through. Browning the meat first and de-glazing the pan gave a nice golden color and an added flavor. Very easy, flavorful recipe that will be served again. I am going to try this with pork chops, instead of Kielbasa and bake it covered. I think it will be another hit with my husband. Thank you for this recipe....very good.

After reading a lot of complaints about the amount of sauce, I made some changes.  I added roughly a half of can of chicken broth to the sauce.  To thicken it up, I mixed a few tablespoons of flour in cold water and added that to the sauce too.  I also added a LOT more parsley, doubled the garlic, and added an extra tablespoon of mustard.

The white wine COMPLETELY changes this recipe.  If you do not add it, expect a very vinegary mustard sauce.

Anyway, I was extremely pleased with it after the changes I made.  There was the perfect amount of sauce.

My husband wasn't too sure about this one, but he ended up really liking it!  I added just a little more dijon mustard and a splash of balsamic vinegar for a little kick.  It was quick, easy, and inexpensive, and I will definitely add this to our dinner rotation.

Thanks for sharing!

PERFECT!!!! I didn't change a thing and this recipe WILL be made again and again! Less noodles next time, but that's personal preference. The saurkraut was sooooo wonderful in this recipe. it wasn't over-powering like I thought it would be. Its a MUST MAKE !!!!!

I'm not sure why, but me and my dh didn't like this at ALL! my dd, who is 8, finished hers, but dh and I couldn't even finish it.  I made it EXACTLY by the recipe, didn't alter ANYTHING.  AND, we really like all the ingredients, so not sure why.  It was just not good at all.  And we love keilbasa, pasta, sauerkraut, mustard, anything with a german flair.  Oh well!

So all I did was cut up and cook the kielbasa with the sour kraut and some noodles then added sour cream and milk and cayenne pepper and it was really really good! I dunno if this qualifies as the same recipe even, but that's all I had to work with. My hubby really liked it...

This was delicious.  The city of Linden has some really wonderful Polish stores and they have freshly made Kielbasa which is out of this world.  I was looking for a new way to use it and found this recipe.  It's a keeper - the only addition to this was to add some caraway seeds and thyme.  The thyme was a great addition.  Will make this again.  Thanks submitter.

Living and growing up in Pennsylvania Dutch country this recipe really sparked my interest.  I did make a lot of modifications, first of all I added more white wine, and a lot more seasonings to the kraut and sauce.  I added 1/4 tsp. caraway, 1/4 tsp. fennel, 1/4 tsp. white pepper, and a couple of dashes of thyme.  I wanted the sauce to be a little saucier, so I also threw in a can of cream of mushroom soup...it was really tasty and different, not the same old, same old!

With minor revisions, this recipe is a winner. I doubled the sauce portions - although next time, I may cut back on the mustard. I also served it over mashed potatoes instead of the pasta. It was very yummy!

This was a nice twist to the usual sausage/sauerkraut dinner. I added more wine to it to make a little more sauce. I also didn't use as much parsley, simply because I think fresh parsley can overpower a great meal. WONDERULF!

Very tasty and different. Reminded me of the dogs I'd get at the ballpark with mustard and kraut.. YUM. I left out the red bell pepper but used all the rest of the ingredients but in different proporations. I do agree this needs some sort of a saucy compliment so next time I think I'll whip up a white sauce and add mustard and spices to that, then add the veggies (I forgot I added shredded carrots too) as well as the kielbasa ( I used turkey). Leftovers taste great.

This was surprisingly good....the ingredients are kind of weird, but do go together nicely.  I thought it tasted better the longer it sat.  Was excellent as leftovers.

UNBELIEVABLE!  I've always been loyal to kielbasa and kraut alone, but this recipe is outstanding.  The flavors mix very nicely and the kraut adds the perfect saltiness to the dish.  I would drain it for this recipe, but there's no reason to rinse it at all if you like kraut.  Easy enough recipe, my boyfriend was able to prepare it for us!

I would have given this 2 stars but wifey said to give it 3. I normally love kielbasa & sauerkraut, and I love pasta, but the combo just didn't work for me. The pasta seemed redundant. We had to try it because of the strange mix of reviews. Seems to be a "love it or hate it" kinda dish. Won't be making this again, but glad we tried it. Thanks!!

This is one of my new favorite recipes.  The only thing the needs changing is the pasta to sausage ratio.  If you make it with the suggested pasta amount you need to double the kielbasa.  I also like to fry the noodles until they get a little crispy.  Great dish.  Now if I could only get my kids to like sauerkraut!

I made this meal last night after reading many of the reviews.  My husband - who wasn't too sure about it beforehand - really enjoyed it with the changes I made to the original recipe:  I only used 8 oz (1/2 box) penne pasta 1/2 cup dark German beer to deglaze pan AND 1 cup chicken broth to make enough sauce to coat everything 2 Tbsp creamy onion dip to thicken and make sauce creamy when adding mustard and cayenne pepper  I also browned the turkey kielbasa first, then removed it to a paper towel-lined plate while I cooked the onions and red bell pepper.  I added it back to the pan after I'd made the sauce and cooked up the sauerkraut a bit.  I also sprinkled some Parmesan cheese over the top right before serving, and even my very picky kids liked this dish.

DELICIOUS. Except for reducing pasta to about 8oz., and using 15oz. can of kraut, I followed recipe as is. The flavor is definitely intriguing, but kind of addictive! My husband, who dislikes casseroles and only cares for pasta with spaghetti sauce, thought this was delicious-- even ate 2 huge helpings.  The teenagers tried it & liked the flavor, but not the sauerkraut texture.  Still a BIG hit as far as I'm concerned! Eager to share this recipe  with friends!

Good recipe.  I used 1/2 lb beef kielbasa and 1/2 lb chipotle seasoned kielbasa.  As suggsted by others I added 1 cup of sour cream and 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese before combining with the pasta. Made for a nice creamy sause. I'm not big on sauerkraut but I really liked it in this.  I also cut back a little on the amount of pasta...should have cut it by at least a third.

It is a good kielbasa and sauerkraut recipe,most of  the times I've been served it there was no flavor at all. This recipe has great flavor and good combo of ingredients. I skiped the pasta, since we're trying to watch carbs,it was still good without it.

Wonderful flavor but too much pasta. I used mini bow-tie pasta at 8oz. (new product- Barilla) and Boars Head sauerkraut (or any other premium brand). Also,make sure sauerkraut is thoroughly rinsed and dried. The flavor can overwhelm the dish's flavor.

Used turkey kielbasa.  Very delicious!  Add pasta in last, as you probably won't need all of it as one writer suggested.

What a flavorful dish! I really enjoyed this different take on pasta. I used Penne pasta since I had it on hand, and  regular mustard because that's all I had. And, I'm not a wine drinker, so I had to omit the white wine as well. Regardless, this turned out well, and it tastes great the next day too. Thanks!

We didn't like it at all.  It needed to be more vinegary and more sauerkraut probably would help a bit but it just wasn't our cup of tea, sorry.

This was absolutely delicious and very easy/quick to make.  I read all the reviews and decided not to alter any of the spices, the only thing I did different was to use turkey Kielbasa and pasta shells.  It had so much flavor!  We doubled the recipe and had leftovers and WOW! It's even better the next day. You just can't go wrong with this recipe. I don't think you have to be a sauerkraut lover to enjoy this.

This is the second time I've made this dish.  It has an interesting flavor from the combination of wine, mustard and kraut, and I liked the fact that the pasta wasn't drowning in sauce. I did add slightly more wine than the recipe called for.  My husband and I both like it, so it's a keeper!

I have a similar recipe that calls for cabbage (sauteed in oil first) instead of sauerkraut and it was very tasty.  The combinations sound really odd, but they work for some reason!

I will be one of those people who change things...but the good news is we liked it. Instead of sauerkraut, I used chopped romaine and spinach. Instead of red bell pepper, I used a handful of chopped cherry tomatoes. Aaaaaaand...I used a different kind of sausage. It was delicious! You inspired me!

I thought it was okay but there were way too many noodles. I tried another reviewer's suggestion and added brown sugar to sweeten the sauerkraut. I thought it was okay; My husband and 2 year old HATED it. Won't be making it again.

I didn't think this came together(taste-wise) at all. 1 bite was all I could handle. Hubby liked it more than me so I let him rate it. Keep in mind he eats pretty much anything. I also agree w/another poster....this is NOT an attractive dish.

I made this dish to try something different.  I usually don't like sauerkraut, but it mixes well with all of the other flavors in this dish.  I used turkey kielbasa and used less pasta, and the recipe was a hit!

This is a nice mild flavored dish that I really enjoyed.  I cut out some of the pasta since so many people said there was too much and I also added in some shredded cheddar cheese.  It's certainly not a "pretty" looking dish but the flavors really went well together, I think the white wine is what really made the sauce.  I tried some hot right off the stove and the rest went to a pot luck where it was served room temperature a few hours later (the sauce sort of disappeared once cooled).  It was tasty both ways but I think it was better served fresh and hot.

Surprisingly kid-friendly!  My 3-year old son LOVES this dish.  I have made it twice since discovering it two weeks ago and he cleaned his plate both times!

This was so easy to make and quick! My husband loved it too!! I added leftover Easter ham. Topped it off at end with 3 slices of provolone cheese, once it melted, it was ready to serve. Didn't have the pepper but it's just fine without it!!

I think the recipe was very good. I did change some things. I added more chicken broth which gave a better flavor. Next time I make I am going to add either ham or chicken instead and see how that goes. Thanks for the great recipe

Great idea...I omitted the bell pepper because I dislike them and added a little crushed red pepper.  I loved it but hubby wasn't crazy over it.  Will make again from time to time.

My family loved this recipe.  I used smoked sausage instead of the kielbasa because that's what I had on hand and I left out the peppers because I don't like them and used Penne Rigato Pasta again because that's what I had on hand.  Very easy to make and didnt lack in flavor.  Great dish.

This was delicious!  I didn't have kielbasa but I did have bratwurst sausage.  Since the brats were raw, I cooked them for about 5 minutes before adding the onions and bellpeppers.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe faithfully and it turned out perfectly. I will definitely be making this again.

As strange as the varied ingredients may sound, it was a pretty good tasting dish. The olive oil makes the pasta "just right" and not too dry. We liked it well enough to probably make it again in the future.

My husband and I really like this recipe and will more than likely make it again.  I did use more white wine (3/4 c. instead of 1/4 c.) and I do agree that it could use more sausage.

This is a fantatist recipe.  My family has been eating this for about a year now.  I have a son who can't eat wheat so I divide the recipe to accomodate the allergy.  It is a good alternative to perogies and saurkraught and sausage which is what we had eaten previously.  It also works well with spaghetti squash for the low carb version.

This recipe has potential, but is lacking something, not sure what. Maybe it was because we used turkey kielbaaa, which lacked the oomph of a beef/pork sausage.

yum yum yum! this was a great surprise to our taste buds!! I loved the combo of the sauerkraut and the pasta and used whole wheat pasta and turkey kielbasa instead of regular which made no difference in the taste, just the calories!! my boyfriend suggested using german beer instead at the end instead of the wine which I will try but I liked the nice sauce that the wine helped create...big hit, thank you!

This was a wonderful recipe!  I made it for 3 people which only called for 1/2 lb. kielbasa and next time I am planning on using an entire pound.  Even my 17 month old son liked it!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This dish has become a family favorite.  I'm generally not a fan of sauerkraut but this recipe is an exception. My husband and 2 year old also love it.  It's easy to make and always a hit!

I love sauerkraut and kilebase, but my husband hates them! I promised to make him spaghetti (not my favorite) if we could make this one night. He asked for a small bowl to try, but made himself a PB&J because he thought he wouldn't like it. He ended up really enjoying it because the sauerkraut flavor is really toned down and everything mixes well tgoether. He ended up having 4 small bowls. Just had the leftovers for lunch and they were great too...

This was surprisingly tasty. I needed something quick and the only meat I had that didn't need to be thawed out was kielbasa... I wasn't expecting to like this nearly as much as I did. The dijon mustard and white wine lent very nice flavors to the dish and toned down the sauerkraut just enough. I did use green bell pepper and omitted the onion. Thanks :)

Very good.  I didn't have wine so I used apple juice and used a teaspoon of dried parsley.  I also didn't rinse the kraut and would definitely make this again.  I may actually up the AJ a bit to make it a little sweeter.

I wanted to make something with the sauerkraut and sausage I had on hand that was a little different.  I had half a box of penne in the pantry as well.  I added sour cream, milk,red pepper flakes and horseradish to make a creamy sauce.  I also left out the white wine as I had none on hand.  It was awesome.  My boyfriend loved it also!

I changed this a bit. I left out the red pepper and added bacon. I served over mashed potatoes instead of the pasta. I also added some chedder cheese. I liked this but I think it had to much saurkraut and not enough sauce. Next time I will leave out the saurkraut.

Very good and will make again.  Reduced pasta as recommended and was very pleased with pasta to kraut ratio.  Also, didn't have Dijon mustard and used brown mustard because I had it on hand.  My boyfriend liked it so much, he ate all the left overs in the middle of night.

The second time I made this I rinsed and drained the sauerkraut and I liked it better. The first time it was good, but something about it was just TOO sour. After rinsing the sauerkraut, it stays tangy but it is much more mild.

I am rating this a 3 star because it was just ok to me.  I made it as written, fed my 3 little boys, they ate it, I had a little dish of it and was unsatisfied, so I doctored it up a bit before my husband got home from work.  I followed another reviewer and added a little caraway and a little thyme.  I also added a little more dijon and a spoonful of the pasta water to add some extra moisture/sauce.

This didn't live up to the hype-it just was "missing something"  The whole dish was just bland tasting to us, although the spice of the mustard and pepper was good.  Won't make again-Sorry!

This was OK. The presentation isn't that pleasing but in the end we liked the interesting flavor combination.  It just lacked a "WOW" factor and I probably won't make it again.

VERY DRY! I would try it with potatos instead of pasta. Maybe add some cream of chicken soup.

This is really good, especially if you're a sauerkraut fan. My husband thought it might be better with scalloped or cubed potatoes though.

I liked this.  The flavor was great.  Have never mixed red bell pepper with sauerkraut, but it works wonderfully.  My husband (German) said he would have preferred fried potatoes over the ziti.  If I were to make this again with pasta, I would substitute egg noodles.

I thought this was pretty good.  Everyone ate it up and liked it.  I used skinless beef smoked sausage, doubled the  garlic and added some balsamic vinegar and increased the pepper.  I couldnt find any zita pasta so I used small sea shell pasta.  It makes for a filling and unusual meal.  Good for fans of sauerkraut and sausage. It didnt look that bad when it was all mixed together and on the table either.  It looked like pasta with sausage.

I was looking for something different to do with kielbasa and sauerkraut. This recipe is delicious and I loved it! My boyfriend hasn't asked me to make it again, but I'm hoping it will grow on him. If you think this recipe is lacking in flavor, try increasing the garlic or cayenne.

This was surprisingly good.  I was a little nervous to try it after some of the reviews I read.  Someone said it tastes like puppy chow which couldn't be farther from the truth!!  Instead of noodles you can try it over new potatoes!!  Great!

The recipe was easy to follow. My husband LOVED it.
My daughter and I, on the other hand, didn't really like the pasta/sauerkraut combination. If I make it again, it will be for my husbands lunches. Thanks anyway. :o)

Wonderful recipe and very easy to make! I followed this recipe as written except I omitted the sauerkraut (as we had none) and I used green pepper. Still very tasty and with lots of flavor. The pinch of cayenne pepper and the Dijon mustard were such a surprising addition and really bring the dish together. Served with veggie sides and everyone ate it-even my picky kids! We will definitely be keeping this recipe for use on another busy weekday. Thanks to OP for sharing :)

This was really good. Trying to find dairy free recipes, and this works just fine. I did add more oil and wine to make more sauce. Never would have thought to put these ingredients together.

I followed the recipe exactly except for the pasta, I didn't have any ziti but did have rigatoni and it was fine. The only suggestion is go really easy on the dash of cayenne. This tastes even better the second night.

This turned out surprisingly well. I was referred this recipe a while ago and have been hesitant. The thought of “noodles” and “kraut;” I just wasn’t sold. My substitutions; red wine vinegar, spicy brown mustard, and garlic powder (1/2 tsp). Pretty amazing.

Better than anticipated! I made mine meatless(only because I didn't have the kielbasa), and I used a splash of white wine vinegar instead of white wine. I also doubled the cayenne pepper(I love it spicy!). One of my fav's!

I made this using chicken sausage, since my husband and I are avoiding mammals.  We also LOVE  cilantro, so I substituted cilantro for the parsley.  It made for a very good, very light, dinner.  All of the ingredients are healthy, and it's quite satisfying. 
We'll be making this again.

Meh.   That's best I can do.   Made exactly as written with the exception of peppers - we choked it down & wondered out loud what we're gonna do with what's left.   Not happy about wasting beautiful ingredients but, nope, this won't happen again in our house.

As it is, the recipe is decent - I made it with vegetarian sausages instead of kielbasa (heretical to some, I know, I apologize) and it was quite good as a vegetarian dish.  Once I added some hot pepper flakes and Parmesan, I liked it a fair bit.

This was a nice use of pasta, sauerkraut, and sausage.  We liked it, but it seemed to lack a little flavor.  As kind of surprised by that with all the other ingredients in the recipe.  The flavors did seem to develop more the second day, as leftovers.

I'm giving this a five because while I enjoyed it, I wasn't over enthused..it was my husband and teenage son that questioned my sanity as they devoured it.  So if you have people that love kielbasa AND kraut AND pasta this is a HIT!!!!  That would be my two men.

I made this for my fiancé and I for dinner tonight, and it was delicious! My fiancé is generally a finicky eater, so I was a bit apprehensive about this recipe. After dinner, he told me that he could have eaten six more plates of it, and it was one of his favorite dinners that I've made! :). Needless to say, this recipe will be added to dinner rotation! 
The only changes made were that I used fettuccine, and added a bit more than a pinch of cayenne :). Yum!

This was easy to make, and everyone enjoyed it. I dont think it has staying power in my list of dinners for the family, but it was worth making once maybe twice.

I'm not much on sauerkraut but my husband is, so I decided to give this a try. I think the mustard and wine are a good offset to the sauerkraut flavor. It was very good, and definitely worth making again.

This was ok, we were not crazy about the pasta, but the flavor was good.  Next time i will use sliced fresh potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was okay, just felt like it needed something 'else'.

I love sauerkraut and kielbasa, but was not crazy about the inclusion of pasta.  Seems many did enjoy; so it's a matter of one's preference.  i will try this again, as i enjoyed everything but the pasta, but will either halve the ziti, or elimate completely.

I love kielbasa and kraut and this recipe did not let me down.  I wouldn't change a thing.
