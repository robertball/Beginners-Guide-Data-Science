This is the recipe I submitted but I do not steam my squash.  I slice it and then boil it in water for about 15-20 minutes or until tender.  I drain the water off before adding the squash to the rest of the ingredients.  This is really good.  Hope you like it.

I've made this recipe twice lately, once for a weekend at the lake and again for my in-laws.  I made one addition and that was chopped celery (simply because we put celery in our holiday dressing).  Everyone raved about it.  It is something I will keep on hand in the freezer.

It's like Thanksgiving in the summertime.  So delicious.  As one reviewer suggested, I boiled the squash and I added to onion and boiled that too.  I even used fat free milk and fat free butter spray.  The only change I  would suggest is an increased cooking time.  I prefer my dressing a little drier and this was very moist and mushy (but I still ate three helpings :).

This recipe is absolutely heavenly. The only alteration I make is I add 1 to 2 teaspoons of garlic powder to it and usually bake for about 40 minutes to get a slightly browner appearance. My wife works for a home for the physically and mentally challenged, and the clients demand that I fix this for them once a week to serve as a side with their supper, they enjoy it so much.

I rate this recipe 5 stars in taste however I had to increase the ingredients after my first try because this one makes only makes about 4 servings.  Also, I had to remove it from oven approximately 3 times and stir because it was a bit too mushy, therefore, adding approximately 15 minutes cooking time.  With these adjustments taken into consideration, this was a very tasty recipe that received lots of praise from those I served.

This is the best recipe. My kids don't like to eat veggies, so they actually eat this dressing with out knowing they are eating vegetables. The only difference is that I add poultry seasoning and a can of cream of chicken. This is a favorite with my family and friends.

I tried this recipe and my family loved it. I have made another variety of it by adding shrimp, crawfish and crabmeat. Everytime we have a potluck at work they have asked me to make it.

Family loved this and so did I!! Used corn muffins crumbled, used butter instead of margarine and left onions out for kids-used a little onion powder. I will be making again and thanks for recipe.

I like the idea. I'd made the cornbread as muffins. I added more cornbread (two muffins) and 1-2 eggs and it baked up more firm which I preferred. My daughter HATES yellow squash but ate this. Her only complaint was it was too sweet and although I didn't think it was too sweet, I will make a savory version using this concept next time. Thanks for sharing!

Very, very good. I didn't add as much sage as the recipe called for and it was fine (for my taste buds anyways). Enjoyed it and easy to make!

I don't think this recipe should say that the preparation time is only 10 minutes. I had to make the cornbread part first which took 25 minutes to bake. Also, the only change I made was I used butter instead of margarine. The taste was O.K. but I won't be making it again.

WOW!  This is fantastic!  My squash plant has wet rot and I am desperately trying to save it so I can make this over and over!  I used one box of Jiffy corn muffin mix (baked in a loaf pan) and crumbled it all up.  It was more than the recipe called for but seemed perfect.  And wasn't soggy as some reviewers suggested.  I skipped the sugar as the cornbread is a bit sweet.  Most of the squash I precooked/steamed but I put in an extra handful of raw squash.  I cut it into pretty small cubes.  (Again, added a little more squash than recipe called for) One reviewer suggested not bothering to precook the squash.  While the few extra pieces I threw in not precooked added a nice texture, I wouldn't want it all that way.  Definitely preboil or steam for perfect stuffing texture.  I used butter instead of margarine (because what is that really?!)  and added a bit of garlic powder.  I had fresh sage in the garden.  What a perfect summer dish!  I immediately had requests to make it again.  Now if I can just save that plant....

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  A couple of people who don't like squash didn't even know it was in there.  My fiance initially was sad that I didn't make gravy but he loved it too and said it didn't need gravy. It's a keeper!

I tried this recipe and my family couldn't tell it from our traditional dressing (sans chicken). I do add a chopped boiled egg to mine.

I had the pleasure of tasting this recipe yesterday at my cousin's and it was delicious!  I do not eat squash, but I do NOW.  My cousin told me she would email me the recipe, but I couldn't wait, so here I am googling.  I definately plan on making it for Thanksgiving, my nextt biggest dinner that i am hosting.

What a delicious alternative to regular squash casserole.  I didn't steam mine but rather boiled the squash with the onion until tender then drained off the excess liquid.  I did not find this dressing too dry or too moist and found the flavor perfect.

Phenomenal flavor and great way to incorporate squash into the daily diet.  It was definitely too moist for my liking so I will definitely modify it next time as well as dice instead of chop the onions, but it is a great recipe all in all!

Was a hit at thanksgiving!!!!.  I doubled the recipie.  I used 1 can cream of mushroom soup and one can cream of chicken. I boiled the squash till it was tender, and sauted onion for a few minutes, but only used 1 large one.  I topped it off with crushed butter crackers for a better looking crust on top, which i drizzed with butter, and it briwned up nice.

This dressing recipe just replaced my traditional cornbread dressing recipe.  There is no higher praise. (I was already famous for my cornbread dressing.)  Thank you for sharing!  Every time I make this I am asked for the recipe.  LOVE it!

This was fantastic!  Fixed for a family meal & every bit was eaten.  They even requested I make it again just two nights later.  We used corn muffins made from Jiffy mix & just omitted the sugar.  Worked great.  We also determined that we liked the squash julienned before cooking.  All n' all a great recipe...and an easy one at that.

Loved this recipe!  Used the West Tennessee Cornbread recipe from this site for the cornbread. I did not add the milk and it came out perfect. Also cut the onion in half and we don't like the taste of sage, so substituted 1/4 tsp. poultry seasoning for the sage. Have requests to make again asap!

I have been making this for years. You don't need to add water when cooking squash.  They are mostly water anyway.  Just make thin slices, add a little margarine or butter, cover tightly in a heavy skillet or pot and turn the burner down very low.  It will cook in its own juices.  You can put the onions in there with it if you like.

i sauteed my squash and onions with garlic and seasonings, then added 2 c. 9 grain toast cubes.  couldn't find any cream soup in the cupboard, so added a big chunk of cottage cheese.  skipped the sugar and it didn't need it.  i cooked about 15 min longer than specified, still very moist!  pregnant lady and 15 month old looooved it :)

My boyfriend loved this! After dinner he got a spoon and the pan and ate the rest of it and has asked for it numerous times since then. I also made this for Christmas and it was a big hit with my family.

Delicious! This is going to be my new holiday dressing. However, i would recommend cooking it an hour vs. 30 minutes. After 30 min it was still too moist.

This is a yummy recipe.  My only suggestion is to bake it in a 9x13 pan to make sure it is a thin layer so that it will dry out properly and not be soggy.  I cooked it in a more deep casserole dish and the top was great, but it was soggy under.

I cooked my squash in 1/2 cup water, drained and smashed with potato masher. Sauteed onions in a tablespoon or 2 of the butter (not margarine) while cooking squash. Used cream of chicken soup and threw in chicken meat from a rotisserie chicken purchased at deli. Omitted the egg.I also have made this with a package of seasoned cornbread dressing when I didn't feel like making cornbread. Delicious either way!!!!

Outstanding! I used cream of celery instead of mushroom, doubled the squash, butter, and corn bread, more than doubled the sage (we love sage), and left out the sugar on account of using a sweeter corn bread recipe. We don't like squash, but we love this!

NEW THANKSGIVING FAVORITE! My vegetarian BFF joins my family for Thanksgiving on occasion.  We try to have various dishes that will satisfy her diet choices, while not depriving the rest of us on any satisfaction.  I tried this recipe out for our holiday meal 2014 (after kitchen testing it a few weeks in advance).  It was a HUGE SUCCESS and tasted so much like the southern style cornbread dressing that is a staple of our gatherings.  The only tweak I had to make was with the CREAM OF MUSHROOM soup since many of the grocery brands have chicken stock.  We use an Emeril Porcini Cream of Mushroom version that was a true vegetarian version.  I diced the yellow squash to hide it from my family members who "think" they don't like squash and then steamed it exactly according to the recipe.  The dish was beautiful in appearance and married well with turkey gravy and mashed potatoes, for us meat eaters.  My vegetarian friend LOVED it too.

This is always a hit at our Fourth of July celebration. I always use either Pepperidge Farms cornbread stuffing mix or a box of Stove Top. There is plenty of seasonings in either and this eliminates the addition of sage. I agree with extending the baking time in order to get a crispy brown top. Delicious!

Made this yesterday.  It's awesome.  Both of my teenage boys said no to it because they "don't like squash".  I made them try it and they both changed their minds.  One took a second bowl back to his computer with him.  This morning I noticed one of the leftover containers was missing!  Agree with another reviewer that it comes out a bit mushy.  I might try reducing some of the liquid next time.  Will try using Healthy Request soup next time too.  Doubled fine.  I used Marie Calendar's Mix for the cornbread.

Made slight changes to the recipe based on what I had on hand.  I a little over 3 cups of squash (4 small squash), poultry seasoning vs sage and omitted the sugar and milk altogether.  The taste was better than I expected.  The reason for only three stars is due to an inconsistency with the cooking time.  30 minutes at 350 is DEFINITELY not enough time.  After 30 minutes I still had a  pan of yellow goo.  I raised the temperature to 400 and baked it for an additional 20  minutes to get it done.  Overall a good recipe.

Excellent twist on Southern cornbread dressing. Only. Changes i made were adding a chopped celery stalk and instead of steaming I boiled the onion, squash, celery and sage in 3 cups of chicken stock,then added the remaining  ingredients before baking. :-)

Awesome Recipe. I have tried several others and this one is  by far  our favorite. Add a little poultry seasoning to really make this recipe pop!

This dressing was really good.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and loved the flavor.  I will make this one again but the only thing I would change would just be not using quite as much butter. It did take a long time to cook and I had to stir it and put it back in the oven a couple of times so that the top wouldn't burn before all of the moisture cooked out of the middle.  Other than that I thought this was fantastic.

This is very similar to the recipe I've always used for Squash Dressing. I normally use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom however and i use "plantation" brand sausage seasoning instead of sage. It kicks up the flavor and heat a notch or two.  I'm sure just adding some red pepper flakes would work too for us heat fans.  Delicious side dish for summer veggies in the South!!

This was fantastic - to me, regular dressing can be really bland, and this had a more interesting taste.  Like other reviewers, I steamed the onion with the squash, as I don't like crunchy onion in dressing.  I also added some celery as other reviewers suggested.  It took considerably longer than 30 minutes to cook - mine took more like 50 minutes.

I didn't add as much milk. Other than that I followed the recipe. We also had a bunch of yellow squash from the garden and measured out two cups and put in freezer bags for my next batch of dressing. Also I double my cornbread and put in the other half in the freezer so I will have it next time. It saves some time!
