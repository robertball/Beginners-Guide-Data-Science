This was absolutely delicious!! Since one of the previous reviews stated that the chicken was a little bland i added a packet of taco seasoning! This was perfect! The other thing i did differently was I shredded the chicken after 6-7 hrs and let it simmer for 1 extra hour so that it could absorb more of the flavors. This will be something I will be serving at home more often.

As written this recipe would be bland. I took the advice of others before me and added additional seasoning. Salt onion and garlic powder chili powder and cilantro and added some red hot sauce into the mixture. You would think with all of the added seasoning it would be strong but I still felt like it was missing something. I think I will attempt again but try the taco seasoning packet that another reviewer used. I believe this recipe has potential with the additional add ins.

I wanted to keep the theme of "mexican" so I swapped out pizza sauce for enchilada sauce. I served these sandwiches with shredded lettuce. chopped tomato and the shredded cheese. The boys thought this was a great dinner! Great spin on our usual mexican themed dinner night.

quick and easy "on the way out the door" recipe I think it made more like 8 large servings. I served with sautéed onions and peppers. The guys ate theirs as sandwiches and I just I put mine in a bowl without the bread to cut the calories and carbs. Great recipe for a busy day or when everyone gets home for dinner at a different time.

I tried this recipe and thought it was a little bland. However when I took the cold leftovers and combined with fresh spinach garbanzo beans and shredded cheese it made a great salad. If I made this recipe again I would probably up the amount of pizza and hot sauce and maybe throw in some spices to add more flavor.

This was a good cheap and easy recipe. It was not really good as a sandwich. I made some rice with black beans tomatoes and green onions and piled this on top and that was really good.

These are interesting. I'm not sure it's one I would love without the Cheddar cheese but with the cheese I find it pretty tasty. There is nothing here that screams at you flavor-wise but all the flavors meld together to be quite satisfying together. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I subbed in an equal amount of hot red salsa in place of the verde and it is still great. To serve I put the cheese on the buns and heated up the chicken and made the sandwiches to put in a 350 degree oven to toast and melt the cheese. AMAZING!

Definitely enchilada sauce rather than pizza sauce added a can of chopped green chiles and had to thicken the sauce then it was 5 stars and btw don't bother trying to pull the chicken apart with 2 forks use your potato masher. The original recipe was a good starting point.

I guess I really just prefer sweeter shredded meat sandwiches. These are very savory still tasted okay but found myself halfway through the sandwich getting some BBQ sauce out to dip it in. Served with pepperjack cheese sliced onion and jalapenos.

The whole family liked it -- including the picky kids! I thought it was slightly runny though so the bun was a bit soggy so I might dial back on the sauce next time or do a better job using a slotted spoon to dish it out. Will be making this again!

Wow what a simple recipe for a delicious meal. Pop the frozen meat into the slow cooker add a couple of cans of sauces with a few spices and wait eight hours. A scrumptious outcome. So simple so good - and I didn't even use the cheese.

I really appreciated how easy this was AND that you can use frozen BLSL chicken! Mine was thawed because I hadn't read the recipe closely and only took about 4 hours to cook on low. I used homemade pizza sauce ("Exquisite Pizza Sauce") from this site because it's what I had on hand. I'm not a big chicken fan and I was pleasantly surprised w/how delicious this SMELLED! However the taste doesn't quite live up to the smell; you'll want to adjust accordingly w/your favorite additional seasonings (taco packet Red Hot chili powder etc). This is a great jumping off point just a tad bland but that's easily fixed to make this an easy crock pot meal. THANKS for the recipe FrackFamily5!

Simple and easy to prepare just what I was looking for. And bonus I had all the ingredients on hand. Served this along side 'Oktoberfest Potato Salad' from AR. Thanks FrackFamily5 for creating this recipe.

I made this exactly as recipe stated because I needed something quick to prepare and leave all day. We enjoyed over riced cauliflower one night and leftovers were made into enchiladas later that week. I will be making this again so we can use the shredded chicken for other recipes.

I added taco seasoning as well and really enjoyed the flavor. Only down side is it is VERY juicy and the bun gets real soggy real fast.

I followed the recipe as written and really liked it. I was unsure how pizza sauce and salsa verde would taste together... but the answer is that it tastes good! I liked this best on plain kaiser rolls with cheddar cheese as suggested. However the leftovers work well on nachos and tacos also.

It was good but not worthy of 5 stars. My husband ate it and was surprised to learn it had pizza sauce in it. I was pleased that the pizza sauce took away the spiciness of the green salsa. I didn't use hot sauce because I have wimpy family. That probably would have made it worth 5 stars.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added a packet of taco seasoning mix. I also used flour tortillas instead of the rolls. This recipe was a big hit in my family. I will definitely be making it again.

I added taco seasoning as mentioned by someone else. I felt this would be a great idea. This was just ok. My family hated it. I however added a whole bunch of chicken broth to it and made it into a soup rather than throw it out. Then it was good.

I love these sandwiches! We follow the recipe and always find them delicious! We usually change up the type of rolls we use for the sandwiches. I really like them with the Hawaiian Buns! So good and so easy to make!
