Recipe flavors were good however I would make a couple changes. Omit the first step re: putting on the oil then cooking for 5 mins. Instead, put on the the soy mixture in the beginning and then broil for about 3 mins. Much better. The oil in the beginning prevents the soy mixture from adhering to the peas.

Delicious hot, better at room temp - which was perfect since I brought it to a potluck.  The dish got rave reviews.  I made a few changes for personal taste and lack of listed ingredients:  1 clove of minced garlic added to the olive oil instead of the garlic flavored oil; 10 drops of Tabasco instead of chili oil, but next time I'll add more; and more brown sugar - about two tablespoons - yum!  I used sugar snap peas fresh picked from my garden and they retained their crunch even when I ate the leftovers later.  This one's a keeper!

Fantastic! To keep the calories down even more I broiled the peas with out oil. I don't think they need it!  Then added fresh garlic to the soy sauce, used crushed red pepper flakes instead of the chili and I doubled the sugar, sesame oil is perfect.  Loved it!  Can't wait to make this with green beans too.  Next time I will sprinkle the sesame seeds on right before serving so they don't sink to the bottom with the sauce.

I love sugar snap peas and was so happy to come across this recipe.  Usually we just have them with ranch dip at parties, etc.  I wanted to serve this as a side dish veggie so here's what I did.  I didn't have garlic flavored olive oil so I put the peas in a bowl, drizzled them with some EVOO and mixed in a couple tsp. of minced garlic.  Then I transferred this to a rimmed baking sheet that I had coated with cooking spray.  I baked them at 400 for about 10-12 minutes, just till slightly tender when pierced with a fork.  I used 1/2 tsp. of both the sesame oil and brown sugar and omitted the chili oil (personal preference).  They were great as a side dish for baked salmon.  Thanks!

This recipe is fantastic. Absolutely delicious. Followed anothers lead and simply drizzled olive oil over the peas omitting the 3TBS. Other than that made exactly as written and it was perfection. A new staple for us!

Great recipe! I actually got my husband to eat sugar snap peas!!!  Instead of garlic oil, I used olive oil and minced garlic.  I also upped the brown sugar a bit - YUM!

made it ahead and served it cold and it was a hit. I think next time I will use honey instead of brown sugar though so the sauce sticks better to the sugar snap peas. Nice way to add a healthy appetizer. I was pleasantly surprised.

A little EVOO and sesame oil shaken with s/p and sesame seeds. Baked at 450 in over for 15 minutes. Yummy and easy. Thanks for the suggestions!

Hubby and I both loved these.  We got fresh sugar snap peas from the local farmers market and this was the perfect recipe for them...and quick.  Watch those peas under the broiler.  This will be one of my go-to recipes.

Wow!  Talk about easy - and tasty!  I was looking for a quick recipe to use up some sugar snap peas in my fridge, and I just so happened to have everything I needed to make these!  They made a great accompaniment to the grilled steaks, baked potatoes and salad we served them with.  Even my picky 13-year-old son liked them - the rest of us LOVED them!

good cooking method, but it seemed too salty and overpowering of the subtle sweetness of the pea.

I saut√©ed the peas in a skillet with the olive oil then added heaping Tbls. chopped garlic and a Tbls. red pepper flakes, and the rest of the ingredients.  I did use 1/4 Cup of brown sugar instead of 1/4 teaspoon.  Everyone loved them as finger food.  Great recipe, thanks.

Instead of broiling these sugar snap peas, I sauted them with olive oil, sesame oil, garlic, brown sugar, and sesame seeds.  Delicious!  Sweet and crunchy.

I served this as a side dish with the slow cooker Cashew chicken (excellent and also on this site).  It was super easy, fast, and delicious! Toast the sesame seeds in a non-stick skillet, shaking until they start to turn golden -- much easier than doing it in the oven and less chance of burning them!  Great recipe!

Very good.  I was worried because some of them looked like they had burned, but they didn't taste like it.  I used normal soy sauce and loved the salty flavor. I also didn't have toasted sesame seeds, so I put the seeds in with the sugar snap peas to be broiled.

I steamed my peas without the olive oil for 4 minutes in water in the microwave.  Added a little fresh ginger to the mixture and fresh garlic. Everyone loved it. I will make again and again

Pretty good!  I served these with the Oriental Pork Chops on here.  I tossed everything together before broiling and it was none the worse for wear.  I don't have chili oil but I have sweet chili sauce so I tossed that in instead.  Very quick, extremely easy, and a nice side.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were good and the sauce was delicious, but our broiler was HOT! I only had them in for a minute but that was too long and there was no snap left in the peas!

I make this recipe for my husband and I and I have done it for company.  They loved it.  I add 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and also double the brown sugar.  These are delicous!

Great flavor, although I found that there was a bit of sauce left over. I used frozen snap peas straight from the freezer into the broiler and it turned out great!

WOW!  These were absolutely delicious!  I didn't have garlic infused oil so I faked it by pressing a clove of garlic into some olive oil.  I also didn't have chili oil, but I used about a quarter teaspoon of tabasco and it worked great with on weirdness from the vinegar base in the hot sauce.  I intended to use these as a side dish, but I kept "appetizing" on them and there weren't many left by the time the meal was served!

I loved these. I am always trying to find ways to make green vegetables edible for us...we aren't big green veggie fans...and these were incredible!! Ate them at room temperature and followed the recipe exactly. Delicious. I think this would also be great way to prepare broccoli or snow peas.

It was good! Make sure to use low sodium soy sauce, I did not an it was too salty. It reheats nicely! Here are the changes I made:
-broiled on high for 7 minutes (no oil)
-added 4 small cloves of garlic into the soy sauce mixture
-added about 2tsp of red pepper flakes instead of chili oil
-double sugar
-no sesame seeds

Delicious recipe!  I like my food to have quite a bit of flavor so I did as another reviewer suggested and mixed the sauce and the peas together first and then cooked everything together.  They came out delicious and were devoured in minutes!

I did not have chili oil, but we thought this recipe was fantastic.   It's a little messy, but has great flavor and is a good alternative to edamame.

My husband, 3 year old and one year old loved this and they are very picky when it comes to vegetables.  I took previous review's advise and omitted the olive oil and added one clove of crushed garlic to the sauce.  I also left out the chili oil since I was making this for my kids.  Will definitely make this again.

GREAT RECIPE!  I used only 8 oz peas.  I also did not use the Garlic olive oil....replaced it with 1 clove minced garlic and used EVOO in place and then drizzled.  Also didnt have sesame seeds on hand.  Still turned out perfect!  Im sure the seeds kick it up a notch but was still great.  Going in my recipe box definately!

I didn't want to heat the house, so I cooked these in a stirfry pan on the stove, and they were excellent! You definitely have to be careful not to overcook them though or they will be mushy, but that's standard for any veggie.

Mmmm, loved these!  I had some sugar snap peas to use in the fridge and came across this one and they were so yummy and a snap to make!  I decided to steam mine which completely omits the use of the olive oil , used good quality low sodium tamari and since I didn't have chili oil, used some red pepper flakes per other reviewers.  Added granulated garlic to my mixture since I wasn't using the garlic olive oil.  Fantastic!

I have sugar snap peas in the garden so I thought I'd give this a try. We loved it! The only change I made was to mince a garlic clove and mix it in with the peas before broiling. I think next time I will put just a tiny bit more pepper and brown sugar as well.

Awesome. Served it cold as appetizer. Followed others' suggestions to use fresh garlic with olive oil, used red pepper flakes and used grape seed oil. Very easy to adapt to what you have on hand. Can't wait to try with snap peas out if my garden this summer!

My family and I loved this!  My broiler was hot, and I only baked for three minutes.  Instead of garlic flavored olive oil I added a clove of minced garlic to the oil, and instead of chili oil I followed a previous review and used 10 drops of hot sauce.  Also, I omitted the sesame oil and seeds.

I made this pretty much according to the recipe except I omitted the chili oil (didn't have any and my husband hates spicy food).  It was great!  I served it with the "Sweet, Sticky, Spicy Chicken" from this site and rice.  It was a great meal.

Very nice for Sugar Snap peas, but I had to add a little salt.  It was very blank and, to me, it needed some salt.

The heat and spice and the salty flavors make this side BANGING! I ate almost all of them!

Delicious and Oh so Easy!  As another reviewer suggested, I baked them in the oven for 10 min @400 and then tossed.  Great warm and better cold.

This recipe had mixed reviews. I didn't coat in the oil before cooking but marinated the pea pods for about 15 minutes in the sauce minus the 3 TBLS. garlic flavored oil. I will try again and marinate longer and see if that adds some more flavor.

Our garden gives us way too many peas and this was the perfect way to eat them all up!  They were great cooked and cooled but half of them were eaten raw and dipped into the sauce while waiting for everyone to get home for dinner.  Great both ways.

I prepared this as a stir-fry and ate it over white rice.  But I agree that it would be an excellent finger-food appetizer as some disappeared before they made it in the serving bowl!

Everybody in my house loved this! I would have added a bit more garlic and chili. Loved it and very easy!
