Yet Another "Chef John" Favorite! We tried this recipe for our Sunday Dinner last night and it was a Huge Hit! The meat was fall apart tender and absolutely Delicious! We followed the recipe exactly as stated. On a side note, this could also work for an easy weeknight meal, using some  super thick chops and less cider. This recipe has earned a spot in the regular rotation.

Very flavorful and tender. Perfect ingredients for pork! I used a bone-in shoulder, about 4 ¼ pounds along with high quality organic apple juice. My roast was done in about 6 ½ hours on low. For the sauce, I added an extra tbsp of Dijon and decided to thicken a bit more with 3 tbsp water / 3 tbsp cornstarch. Served with red cabbage and roasted garlic cauliflower.

I was so glad to see one of the Reviewers commented that this could also be made with Thick Cut Pork Chops, because I had 4 of them that I used for this Recipe!  They totaled 3 pounds of Pork Chops so I figured I'd make the recipe otherwise exactly as written (oops I just now realized I forgot to add the herbs and cayenne) and it was GREAT!

See my Pic... I served with Mashed Sweet Potatoes and Kale with Pine Nuts.  It was a beautiful presentation and everyone LOVED it!

This is an excellent recipe and the pan sauce is so delicious you can drink it!  I followed the recipe directions exactly with the exception of using a boneless pork loin roast (4 lbs). I cut the cooking time down to 4-1/2 hours. I also added some Worcestershire sauce to the meat when I put it in the crock pot. I used apple juice. I think a lot of reviewers were expecting the pan sauce to turn out like a thick gravy, but it is really more of a light sauce that you drizzle over the meat. It takes awhile to reduce, I'd say 20-30 minutes but it's worth it. No thickeners needed. I love the subtle sweetness and the mustard flavor is fabulous with the pork. I served it with buttermilk garlic mashed potatoes, green bean casserole and cresent rolls. Everyone's plates were clean!  I can't wait to make this again! 10 stars Chef John!

We overdid the pork a bit as we didn't buy the full 4 lbs -- it was fully our fault for not adjusting the cook time. But EVEN with that we were gobsmacked at how delicious this was. My husband and I were licking our plates. This won't simply be tossed into the recipe rotation; it's getting a place of honor.

I have not tries this recipe but I gave it a 5 star anyways. I made a recipe something like this so I know it's good. I take thick cut boneless pork chops and put them in crock pot. I season with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. (A staple on all my meats) I cover that with sliced onions and minced garlic. Then pour apple juice or cider over it. When done after about 6 hours on low. I drain liquid and make thickening of flour and cold juice or cider in a jar to make gravy. I season more with salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. I have to make a lot of mashed potatoes cause my family can't get enough of this gravy. It's delicious and a family favorite at my house.

Very good and could not be easier!  I'm not a fan of pork shoulder, so I used a center cut pork roast instead and just reduced the cooking time to make sure it wasn't too dry.  Very good!

First recipe that I made from allrecipes.com and it was a winner.  The only reason not 5 stars had more to do with me than Chef John.  I used a piece of pork loin from the butcher that was too lean and resulted in a bit of dryness in the end result.  Added apples with 2 hours to go and this was delicious...could have added more.  Will definitely make again.  -StPaddysPro

Husband loved this. The gravy is the best pork gravy I've ever had. I did thicken it some with cornstarch though.

Awesome!  We couldn't find apple cider, so we opted for apple juice; and it was fantastic!  Will definitely make again.

This dish was outstanding.  The only change I made was adding 2T cornstarch dissolved in a small amount of water to thicken the sauce.  This is worthy of company!  So easy!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong--I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  This sounded really flavorful, so I made it for a dinner party.  All of our guests loved it, so maybe it was just me?? I found that pork shoulder was an extremely 'fatty' cut of meat to use, so I think that next time I would try making this with a leaner cut, such as tenderloin to reduce the enormous 'globs' of fat that were in it--I felt like a lot of the meat was wasted from fat, and the fat made the sauce taste weird and it was difficult to skim it off the top as stated because it didn't seem to float to the surface as expected.  The meat was very tender, but for as much spice and slow cooking that went on, I found that the meat did not seem to absorb the flavor very well (maybe poking holes in it with a fork would help it, or marinating it first before searing??).  It still tasted (to me) like plain roasted pork--like the seasonings and juice didn't penetrate the meat at all.  When I tried reducing the liquid, I boiled it for over 2 1/2 times as long as stated and it still had hardly reduced.  Guests were waiting so I just ended up pouring what I had over the top, but it was like water and not a sauce as expected.  It definitely needed something to thicken it more.  I'm not sure why you need to discard the shallot/celery--afterward, I wished I had kept it for garnish to add flavor and dimension. I should have sliced the pork 1st and then poured more sauce on top to cover.

I always read Chef John's recipes and try those that interest me. This was one such recipe. I have made it twice, the first time following the recipe exactly. Last night I made it "my way." The changes that I made were to cook the dish in a Dutch oven at 225F for 6 hours in the oven. The other change was to omit the 2 TBSP of butter from the reduced sauce at the end. There was enough flavor from the ingredients and plenty of pork fat in the sauce. I used a good apple cider, ie one with alcohol. Non-alcoholic "cider" is apple juice. Thanks Chef John for the inspiration of another way to cook inexpensive pork shoulders and please the people at my table.

Just made this tonight for my husband and I and we could not stop picking at the leftover pork!  I used a smaller roast but kept the other measurements the same.  I didn't have shallots so I subbed a yellow onion, sliced, and I added some chopped carrots to the sautee of onion and celery.  I used an apple-ginger hard cider instead of just plain apple cider and I sliced two garlic cloves for the cooking liquid instead of using four whole cloves.  I also skipped the cayenne in the sauce and I liked it just fine.  I served mine with roasted carrots and creamed kale.  Delicious!

This was quite good. Used a 2 lb pork loin since they were on sale and I like leaner meat so I cut the time down to 4 hrs. Kept the rest of the ingredients the same since I like gravy. The liquid at the end did take quite a while to reduce and I wound up adding some cornstarch to thicken it up since it was still quite liquidy. It was sweet but not overpowering and not vinegary like lots of pork recipies in the slow-cooker. I didn't strain out celery and onion from the gravy and I thought it was nice to have the little chunks. Overall it was very easy. Maybe next time I'll add in some apple wedges.

I really liked this!!! I followed the ingredients with the exception of using a hormel pork tenderloin. However I didn't follow the directions!! I just through the frozen tenderloin in with all the ingredients on top and walked away. It took about 4 hours, but I was very satisfied :)

Excellent recipe!  Halved the roast for just the two of us but kept the same amount of sauce.  Needed about an hour less cooking time.  Used a bit of dried sage and rosemary for flavor, and it was great.  If I made the whole recipe, I'd double the sauce.  I will absolutely make this again.

Fabulous!  I didn't make the mustard sauce and left out the onions and garlic, just because I was in a hurry and didn't read the recipe thoroughly! But this was amazingly tender...apple cider vinegar makes it tender, that's the key!

Superb!!  Just made this for tonight's dinner, & it was delicious!!  The pork roast out of the slow cooker tasted yummy, and then to pour the sauce over it - well...it explodes with flavor!!  I really liked how the whole place smelled while the pork was simmering in the slow cooker.  Delicious & easy!!  Hooray for yet another excellent recipe from "Chef John"!!

This is the best pork we've ever had, no question. We even overcooked it (it did "fall apart when handled) and it could not have been tastier. The only change we made was to omit the shallots and use  bit of dried onion and onion powder in its place (I am not an onion person). Will cook this again and again.

I like to cook it longer so that it’s falling apart almost like a pulled pork. I also add 4-5 Granny Smith apples to the slow cooker.

My husband really like this dish.  My toddler who eats everything and I did not like it so much.  I made it again with plain mustard instead of Dijon and we both liked it much better.

The pork used was 3.5 lbs so it cooked faster and was pulled pork consistency. I did not reduce the sauce enough either but it still tasted great!

This had a very good flavor and cooked up very well.  The only issue I had was with the sauce.  Even once it was reduced and the butter was added, it never thickened up the way I thought it would.  It was too late to try to add cornstarch or flour to thicken it up, but I'd keep an eye on it for next time, and make sure you have thickeners at the ready!

Very good! I used white wine in place of the apple cider vinegar, which made it awesome. I also added a little italian spices to the crock pot while cooking for added flavor. Will make again soon.

This recipe was delicious! The local super market only had 2.5lbs pork shoulder roasts so I made two of them at once. While the end result was a little too tender after cooking for 6 and half hours on a low setting it had the texture of pulled pork. Although it was still very good, I am confident that the next time I make this it will be perfect if cooked between 5 and 5.5 hours. Also reducing the broth to gravy was a little difficult and ended up using cornstarch and seasoned with a little garlic powder, salt and pepper. Thanks for the recipe Chef John, all of your recipes I've tried are always well recieved!

I'm not a huge fan of pork roast because mine always comes out dry and touch, but I just made this and it was awesome!  It was very moist, tender and flavor was so delicious!  I left out the mustard only because I didn't have any.  Also, I don't know if the sauce was supposed to thicken as it cooked.  Mine didn't and I cooked over low-medium heat for about 45 min.  It still has a great flavor and I will definitely make this again.  I also made a side of cooked cinnamon apples to go with it.  I loved it!  Great dish for cooler fall weather!

I love Chef John-- the only cook I follow. Made the recipe exactly as is, but added cooked bacon to the top of the roast, and a bit to the liquid, which included baby Yukon Gold potatoes soaking up the love. Fantastic!

This recipe is a keeper!  The only substitution I made was using a 4.5 lb. pork tenderloin instead of a shoulder.  I think for a loin, a 5 hour cooking time would have left the meat more sliceable, but it was delicious anyway, and so easy.  Even my kids (10, 7, and 4) asked for seconds!

I was skeptical but the hubby and I LOVED it. It stinks b/c you need to be at home to toss/turn this - the hubby said it'd be a good 'football Sunday' meal (since he can get off the couch to turn it once every couple of hours).  The sauce is incredible - could have drank it. Bought a no-sugar added apple juice.

This was amazing! One of the best dishes I've ever made- my boyfriend absolutely loved it. Also, for the first time cooking a pork roast it came out perfectly. The meat itself without the side gravy was tender and the flavor was rich. The gravy was sweet and a little tangy. Perfect fall dish. Will definitely make again.

We really enjoyed the flavors of this. I wonder if some that didn't like it used all cider vinegar and missed that most of the liquid was just apple cider. I didn't change anything and won't the next time. The sauce from the drippings was wonderful!

I cooked a 2 kg piece of pork in a pressure cooker for 1hour 15minutes, fell off the bone, was succulently scrumptious. The gravy - I added too much cayenne was too hot for us so I tamed it with some water and gravox, turned out a treat, a bit of warmth but delicious and a superb addition to the meat. Thanks heaps we all loved it.

Another great recipe from chef john...love his meatballs as well. This turned out so yummy . Made some changes added red chili flakes ( 1/2 tsp ) when frying shallots and celery as well as a few extra cloves of garlic ( smashed ) after sautéing celery and shallots but before adding apple cider vinigar. My meat was so tender it shredded I followed sauce and used meat with corn tortillas and a pico made of papaya onion cilantro  tomato- big hit since pork was sweet from apple cider . I soaked meat in a little sauce and served the family for our tacos. My 3 years old and. 6 year old devoured. Thanks chef john

No disrespect but this was terrible. The meat was tender but tasted too vinegary and the sauce was worse. My family usually doesn't complain much but no one liked this.

Was a Fantastic Flavor!  Followed recipe except I only had a roast with a bone in and it worked fine, just can't slice it as pretty. Plus, I did not have Tablespoon of fresh herbs so omitted them all together, since dry herbs can be stronger flavored.  I am sure that would add to the wonderful flavor but that will need to wait till the summer herb garden is ready. I normally do not like wine in my foods, but used a white Viognier and it was perfect, not an overwhelming wine taste.  My family loved it and it will be used over and over.  My Husband and grown son keep raving on how good that was. (Hint, hint...) Sauce great served with white rice.

Used this as a base recipe for pork loin in a pressure cooker. Apple cider vinegar adds the right level of acid to the dish that you would not normally get with just apple cider, but I reduced the amount to about 3 tbs.

Super easy. Used country style ribs and cold it in the instant pot for 8 minutes. Thickened with cornstarch. Yummy!

This is SO good... I made a couple of small changes, but that's only because I did not have all of the ingredients (and live too far from a store).  I was looking for a sauce other than the usual BBQ for cooking some country-style ribs, so tried this.  I didn't have shallots so used an onion, and didn't have celery so threw some celery salt into the mix.  Otherwise all else was the same.  For those who wrote that there's too much vinegar, perhaps you used 2 1/2 cups apple cider vinegar instead of apple cider?  I also had no problems with it cooking down to a thick glaze; I didn't have to add cornstarch (in fact, I cooked it a minute too long and added a bit of water to thin it out). A bit of a tangy taste - almost a sweet-sour - but very good!

This slow cooker apple (juice or cider) braised pork was excellent.  I used a smaller pork roast and only had to slow cook it for 4 hours.  It was not crumbly but I could cut it with a fork (once I carved up the roast)!  I used apple juice instead of apple cider.  My husband and son really enjoyed it as well.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was delicious! I made it almost as listed except a few changes. I can never find shallots so I used sliced onions. Also, the only cider I could find was spiced so I did as some other reviewers said and used apple juice. As I am doing Whole30 right now, I used olive oil, personal preference over vegetable oil and ghee instead of butter.  The sauce with this was so rich and tasty! Wish we were eating bread, french bread dipped in the sauce...yum! Anyway, next time I probably won't add the fresh herbs to the sauce at the end as I don't feel they added anything to the flavor at that point. Reducing the sauce definitely took much longer than stated, I gave up when it got to around 1/2 volume! I could see thickening it a little in the future but it was good the way we had it! This is for sure added to our rotation and will be a regular, not a simple recipe but the return for effort is well worth it!

This was an amazing meal!  My family is not a huge fan of pork because they find it dry and after I made this, they went back for seconds!  I did not alter the recipe, only cooked it entirely in the Dutch Oven at 350 in the oven after braising.  Only took 3 hours and was so unbelievably tender!  Nice flavour, not sweet, just mild.  I used parsley, sage and thyme at the end.  

Note - I served this with white rice and a side of green beans sautéed with bacon and I noticed how well the bacon tasted with the pork.  Might be a consideration to add some bacon into the recipe next time as well.

Wonderful recipe enjoyed by all! Served with new potatoes in a dill and garlic butter sauce. Definitely prefer a thicker sauce so I added corn starch. Also, instead of discarding all of the extra solids from the slow cooker, I retained the celery. Thinking apples and/or onions might be a good addition next time.

I made this recipe as is except that I did not add the cayenne pepper as I can not eat hot type of spices. With that said, I think this recipe is perfectly fine. I would not change anything. I however put it in the oven as  I made half the recipe which took me about 1.5 hours. I will make it again. Even though I forgot to rectify the salt and pepper on the sauce, overall this came out excellent. I will make it again and even consider it for a festive dinner too!

I only gave it a 4 because the smell stayed with us until the next day. Yes, the apple cider vinegar will stink up your house!!

That being said, OMG is this good! The meat was tender and juicy. My hubby loved the shallots and garlic ( yes, he ate them). I definitely intend to make this again! Just, will be opening the house when I do!

I pretty much skipped step 5.  I did this stove top since the slow cooker was occupied. I used apple juice because I don't really like apple cider and I decreased the amount of juice and added more vinegar (Filipino habit?). 

I separated and while reducing the sauce I skimmed off as much of the surface fat that I could. The reduced braising liquid is great as a sauce without any additions - mine was tangy and a little sweet. I also added more salt and pepper through the cooking. The vinegar is strong, but that's a flavor I like (and I put 3/4 a cup)

4  stars because this took a lot of time and effort for the returns.

Made the recipe with only one change, I had a bone in pork roast that the butcher sent by mistake. I went ahead and made it anyway and then used the bone for bean soup! Delicious and just as tender as it could be. My family loved both meals!

It was ok. Neither great nor bad. I used a pork tenderloin 1.5 lbs and cut the other ingredients in half. Cooked for 4 hrs on high in my slow cooker. Meat was tender and not falling apart or stringy. I felt I could taste the acidic vinegar too strongly from the apple cider vinegar. Perhaps it would be better to leave this out or use a reduced amount like a tablespoon. Finished it off with some fresh sage. Won't make again.

I made this exactly as written.  (I went with the option of Italian dried herbs using just 1 teaspoon, as opposed to thyme or sage. )  My husband loved it.  I also loved it but he couldn't stop talking about it, so I guess he loved it more. 
  I would like to suggest serving this pork with the "Sauteed Apples" which is also on allrecipes.com.  They were amazing and paired so great with this braised pork...and mashed potatoes, of course, to sop up all those great pork juices.

I used 1.75" thick boneless pork chops instead, was good but they were a tad dry in the center, but I think next time I will try thinner bone-in ones.  The sauce was AMAZING, that was the best part of the dish.  I also didn't have shallots or celery, so I used an onion and two apples.  When I removed the port from the slow cooker, I took those with it, then strained the sauce and reduced it per the directions.  The best part was I was able to make the entire dish in one pot thanks to the fact that my slow cooker has an aluminum insert that can go over the gas stove.  Can brown the pork chops before slow cooking and reduce the sauce after.  Really cuts down on the dishes one must do.

Loved this recipe. My husband & in-laws did as well. I couldn't find apple cider where I live but I used a good quality apple juice. I served for Easter dinner (in Oklahoma that's served at noon). Since the recipe required the pork roast to be turned every hour or so, I couldn't make Sunday morning as we would be at church. I cooked in slow cooker on Saturday, reheated in Sunday. To prevent drying out I put about a cup of the juice from slow cooker (before cooking it down) in the pan, sealed with foil & heated at 350 for 1/2 hour. It wasn't dry, it was very tender, juicy and flavorful. It held up really well to reheating process. Loved the flavor, don't skip the step to turn the roast while in the slow cooker. We will for sure make this again!

Absolutely incredible pork roast and everyone who has tasted it agrees!  It is very simple to make, especially because you can leave it in the crock pot for a long time... I would advise, however, that if you are going to be gone more than six hours, to use a crock pot that will switch to a warm setting or will delay starting until closer to when you will get home (to avoid overcooking the perfect roast!).   Not only is it delicious but you can also place whatever chopped fresh herbs you would like to on top.  This is great for someone who grows them, like I do, and really adds a beautiful touch for presentation.  I followed everything to the letter and couldn't be more delighted with this recipe.

I used a pork loin and apple juice because that's what I had around.  It still turned out well.  I think it would have been better with the fuller flavor of the fatty pork shoulder and the cider.  We loved the vinegar kick. I would make it again.

The sauce was delicious and the meat turned out great!  It's a little more work than most slow cooker recipes but it was worth it.

I never really liked pork, but I decided to try this recipe anyway. It was delicious! The sauce was amazing. Turned out very tender. Husband loved it, I got a high five after dinner. Lol

This was very, very good. Followed directions (but used a little less shallot and garlic.). Used a bone in roast so it cooked a little faster.   The aroma was wonderful, pork was super tender and my dining companions raved about the "gravy."  Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I had to cook it on high for less time so the meat was a bit tough, but still very tasty.  To make the gravy I removed some of the liquid to a pan added butter and cornstarch mixed with about 1/2 cup of cider.  The gravy was perfect!

The taste is simply superb! I cooked this for a Christmas Dinner for 23 people. I had three 6 pound roasts. I put them in my 20 quart roaster and cooked them all together. They turned out perfectly. That left my oven open for potato and herb casserole and baked beans. I'll probably make this my Christmas dinner from now on. We take turns hosting Christmas dinner in my family so I do it every 4 years. Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe worked well as is; nice rich flavors without anything overpowering; great results from a relatively inexpensive cut of meat .  We paired it with home style egg noodles and horseradish cream sauce (mayo and horseradish 50/50).  Be sure to use fresh herbs (thyme and sage) and don't skimp on the black pepper.  We'll definitely be having this at our house again; big taste with minimal effort.

The sauce was absolutely delicious. The pork was a little dry, however, and I'm not sure why. Made according to directions.

Pork was moist. Needed A LOT more seasoning. The gravy ... meh. I added a Cab/Merlot blend - about 1/2 cup, salt, pepper, and a little brown sugar --- and cornstarch to thicken. Tasted much better. Good base recipe, needs tweaking tho.

Very easy and flavorful. I have made this as a roast but also with cubed pork (less cooking time), and it is delicious either way. I sometimes add a tablespoon or so of chopped fresh ginger.

Insanely delicious! My boyfriend is a chef and said this was the best meal I made him yet. I didn't change a thing in the recipe other than a little extra shallot and garlic because I like everything better with a little extra shallot and garlic ;)

I am sorry to say but I didn't do too well with this one. As for the recipe it's excellent and the flavor was loved by my whole family. but the meat was way under cooked.  I ended up finishing the meat in the oven. Either my crook pot is dying or the settings called for are too low. I will certainly be trying this again.

Too much vinegar. I had to tone the acidic taste down with brown sugar. I skipped the mustard.  Even though it wasn't for us, I still enjoy trying new recipes.

I made a few changes - I always do. Didn't have apple cider or juice, so I mixed some applesauce with chicken broth. Didn't have celery, used celery salt. Onion instead of shallot. I also had to double everything for a bone in, skin on 7 lb pork shoulder. Cooked in oven at 200 for 7 hours. The meat was tender and had good texture. The flavor was really subtle, and I thought the sauce was decent. I think for having it cook all day I definitely expected something a little more exciting and flavorful, but I'm also no stranger to difficulties of a 7 lb pork roast. I will probably make again, but will definitely cut some more corners re: cooking down the apple cider vinegar, and thickening the sauce.

I used a bone in shoulder roast because that was all that was available at the grocery.  The sauce is lovely, the butter gives it a silky texture. I used a blend of rosemary, thyme, & sage.

I made this recipe just as written.  I did not have any Dijon mustard, so instead of using the yellow mustard, I made a substitute following a recipe on another site.  I worked out fabulously, and I can tell that the yellow stuff would have been a mistake in this recipe.  I will definitely be making this again!

Loved this....had made an error by adding the mustard to the crockpot before cooking. It still turned out to be amazing. Will definitely have this again as well as recommend to family and friends. Thanks Chef John.

I just made today. I altered the recipe a little... I left out the garlic, and completely skipped #4 on. I also added 2 chopped granny smith apples. When the pork was done, I removed it from the crockpot and poured all the juice into a large saucepan, reduced it, and added a roux, salt & pepper. The roast was so tender, it ended up being pulled pork in the delicious apple gravy. Served with mashed potatoes. YUMMMMY!

This was really tender and juicy and the flavour was delicious. Family loved it. I served it over seasoned rice. It was easy to make and we have enough gravy/sauce to float the navy. LOL

Easy and delicious. I actually used thin sliced bone-in pork chops which are a family favorite and it was excellent. No leftovers!

Delicious.  Rather than discarding the solids as the recipe suggests, we got rid of the bay leaf and used the celery and onion to put on top of our slices of meat with the sauce poured over it.  It really added to the flavor.  Yum!

I was excited when I saw this recipe in my email.  I got every ingredient, even a gourmet organic apple cider. It was a big disappointment.  The meat was really tough even after it cooked more than the recommended time in the recipe. I am removing this from my recipe box because I will never make it again.

My husband will give me a ten minute massage because he loved this roast. Added 1 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper for a bit more spice.

I didn't have access to a slow cooker so I used an electric skillet. I had a slightly smaller roast but used the same amounts given so there would be enough sauce. This was fantastic. The sauce is truly addictive. When reducing it, watch for a lovely darkening of the liquid. I will definitely create this to impress guests or to make my family feel special.

I had such high expectations for this recipe. I made it for our Thanksgiving dinner. The vinegar was too overpowering. I even added cream at the end to try to mellow it. It was more of a sweet 'n sour type flavour. I am used to my guests raving about my cooking, but the only raves I got were for the mashed potatoes. I followed the recipe exactly. Sorry :(

I made this recipe exactly as instructed and I think it was a flop. I would like more information about the pork used. My butcher took a whole pork shoulder, took the bone out, and then weighed the meat. It had a very thick fat layer, and I cooked it like that. I wanted to get rid of the fat, and chilled the whole dish overnight in the frig. I then followed the rest of the recipe. There was so little flavor, all that came through was the vinegar. Any suggestions how to make this more appealing flavor-wise would be welcome. In my opinion, it was a lot of work for very little return.

Boy was this delicious.  I made this with a tenderloin so I baked instead of putting into the crockpot.  Cooked the meat with the sauce uncovered 20 min per pound at 375.  I used fresh sage.  Best pork roast recipe I think I've come across.  Perfect for a cool fall night!  Served with honey roasted red potatoes and steamed then sauteed green beans.

I was disappointed when I tasted the roast straight out of the slow cooker because it was rather bland. The addition of the Dijon mustard helped. I was not impressed with the overall results, but I would make it again.

Absolutely delicious!  You can cut the meat with a fork.  Make sure you make hte sauce.  That's what make the meal.  Mmmmm.  BIG hit.
