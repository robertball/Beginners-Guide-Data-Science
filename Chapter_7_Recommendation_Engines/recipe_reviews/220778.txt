I used spelt flour instead of the kind called for. My mashed beans were a bit chunky. The flavor is great and the ease of preparation was easy. Wonderful recipe!

Disappointing - I tried this recipe exactly as directed. My sweet potatos may have not been large enough. It turned out very very bland. Even with more sweet potato this recipe would need a lot more spice than it had and possibly less flour. If you make it definitely don't hesitate to adjust it. The batch I made are inedible without sauce or something to flavour them.

It'd probably be better with less flour or maybe some oil.
