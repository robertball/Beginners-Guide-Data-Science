Family favorite every Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner. Always requested. Use stuffing mix from a box in place of bread crumbs, also just use baby carrots, cuts prep time.

I'VE MADE THIS RECEIPES MANY TIMES IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND IT WAS ALWAYS GREAT. THE FIRST TIME, I MADE IT  AS RECEIPE SUGGESTED, BUT FOR FORTY PEOPLE, IT WAS GONE. I DO ADD EXTRA HORSIE SAUCE, AND MORE BREADCRUMBS. AS ONE READER SUGGESTED, USING CHICKEN STUFFING, GREAT TOO. I HAVE EXPERIMENTED WITH OTHER VEGGIES, WITH GREAT SUCCESS. CORN, PEAS, AND CARROTS WAS A HUGE HIT. TONIGHT WILL TRY A SQUASH, CARROT AND BROCCOLI MIX. AM SURE IT WILL BE DELICIOUS. MUST TRY BUT DON'T LIMIT YOURSELF.

The carrots are fantastic! I prefer a little more horseradish. The cheese crumb coating is also great. My brother, who hates carrots, can't get enough of these.

This was pretty good, but you REALLY have to enjoy horseradish in something besides seafood.

I love trying new things, but there was nothing my hubby and I loved about this dish. Too much sauce 1st of all.

We loved this-the onion and horseradish gave the sweet carrots a nice zing.  Instead of topping the carrots with the sauce, I mixed them together and then topped with the bread crumbs and cheese.  The sauce came nice and creamy and was not overpowering.

Very yummy!!  A nice twist of off traditional carrots at dinner.  Suitable for a family gathering.

Well . . .I really liked the crumb coating and the cheese, but I wasn't in love with the sauce at all.  The horseradish taste didn't bother me, but the curdled mayo part did.  We both ate each of our servings but we don't plan on eating the leftovers.  I was excited to find a recipe for baked carrots that doesn't call for sugar, but this wasn't quite what worked for us, so I'll keep looking.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy and good.  I at least double the  horseradish, if not more.  To cook the carrots, add them to a small amount of boiling water and cook for 15-20 minutes.

The white sauce is almost the same as my European father makes and puts over his baked potatoes.  The sauce is good.  I didn't care for it over the carrots, and the bread crumbs is not a good combination.  Would make the sauce again, but no bread crumbs, and no carrots.
