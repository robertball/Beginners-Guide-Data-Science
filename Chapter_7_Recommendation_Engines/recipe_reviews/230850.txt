good recipe 
I made it according to the recipe except I used cream of mushroom with garlic, diced water chestnuts and less onion(2 TBS). Great for using ingredients that are always on hand. Not so good reheated but great straight from the oven when it's crispy. Had this recipe once at a potluck and have been searching for it. Thanks for posting it.

I made this with a few minor changes ( which I always do) , the water chestnuts I cut up, next time I'll look for diced. I omitted the cornflakes inside the casserole and used Spatzle noodles, I added 2 cans of French fried onions ( omitting the regular onions), 8 ounces of cream cheese and I seasoned it with garlic powder and Goya adobo, I also added some almond milk to thin it out while cooking, I used cornflake crumbs mixed with butter for the top. It was delicious, my husband loved it and he's not usually a fan of casseroles! This is getting put into my regular meal menu!

I will definitely make it again.  This time I made a half recipe for my elderly mother and her sitter.  They enjoyed it very much. I will add water chestnuts next time.

Made as directed, just halved the recipe to make a smaller one. It was delicious! Ate these a lot growing up at potlucks in the Midwest, never liked the water chestnuts as a kid but really enjoyed the crunch this time. Husband and 2yo both loved it, is a keeper for sure.

This was a super easy dish to make. I made a few changes, left out the water chestnuts and used pinko bread crumbs instead of cornflakes. It was a delicious dish.

I had to substitute one can of condensed cheese soup for one cream of chicken soup.  Delicious!  Frozen leftovers make good lunches.

I thought this was very good.   The only changes I made was to add a bag of frozen broccoli.    I will make this again!

This was a good basic chicken casserole.  Easy to make,  I did not make any changes, but would try it in the future with some vegetables, such as broccoli, or asparagus.
