Recipie was too greasy and left nothing to be desired.  I guess I expected more of a cream base. I was not impressed.

This recipe was good, but we found it to be a little bland.

My husband & I live on deer meat & fish, so I thought this would be another way of using deer. I usually don't rate something bad, but am afraid I'm going to have to. It was very watery. The meats were very mealy & overcooked. Very bland & ugly soup. I added some black pepper * dried parsley in hopes of adding some flavor, but no luck. Sorry but I won' be making again. I have posted a picture.
