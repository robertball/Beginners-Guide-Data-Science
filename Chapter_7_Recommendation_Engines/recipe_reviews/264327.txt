This was a great recipe and a big hit with my family and friends. I did not change anything on it except chopping the pineapple smaller. We drove up today to get more peaches while they are still fresh so that I could make some more jam!

I've made a number of jams this year. This was by far one of the best tasting ones! The only thing I'd do differently is to cut the pineapple into smaller chunks (or even give it a few pulses in the food processor).
