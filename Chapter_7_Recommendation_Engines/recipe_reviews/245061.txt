I made this modified for allergies. Used the general measurements but “eye-balled” them. 2 small bananas, handful of ice, cocoa powder, almond milk and almond butter. Didn’t add the vanilla as I don’t like the taste. My smoothie maker emulsified the ice so it was more of a cold drink. Next time I will use frozen bananas and blend a little less so it has more of a frozen consistency! 
Thanks so much for a great recipe! Can’t wait to make again. Love a good protein smoothie that is all natural and affordable!

It is my first time doing it and I really liked it. I don’t like bananas, so instead I added an egg and it gave the milkshake a little more of texture. For next time though, I’m taking out the ice. I think the ice is an unnecessary extra.

I have made this several times, & it is really good. It is not too sweet and tastes almost like dark chocolate. I left out the ice and it still gas great texture & flavor

This was very good, and it wasn't too sweet, which was awesome!! The only thing I added was oatmeal to make it more filling!!

I gave this 2 stars (I didn't like it) because it needs a little sweetener and less banana.
