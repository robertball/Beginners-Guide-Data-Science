This was my first time making stuffed cornish hens.  I made the recipe exactly as called for for the stuffing.  I used the http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Apricot-Glazed-Cornish-Hens/Detail.aspx Apricot-Glazed Cornish Hens for a glaze.  It was phenominal.  They looked, smelled and tasted great!   I doubled the recipe and it was perfect for 8 hens with a little stuffing left over.

The cranberry rice stuffing was wonderfully mouth-watering!! I omitted the water chestnuts and used this stuffing in combination with the "Apricot-Glazed Cornish Hens" recipe on Allrecipes. I can't rave about it enough!! Next time though, I'm doubling the recipe. It's that good.

This was excellent.  The rice stuffing tastes so good that I may just make it "stand alone" for a side dish for my next potluck.  I also used the Apricot glaze as suggested by another reviewer, and it was a nice add.  I did have a problem with the stated cook time for this... It took more like about 1 1/2 hours for me from the time I put it in the oven (I did take them out for about 5 min or so in the middle to glaze, but still ???)  I would allow a full 2 hours (at least) from start to table to be on the safe side if you have guests coming!

This recipe was so good!  I did not have dried cranberries, so I used chopped dried apricots instead which was really good!  I would recommend using one hen per person however because its so delicious!  GREAT stuffing!

This recipe was unbelievably excellent.  I had made a bit too much (only had 4 hens) which was great, as everyone almost fought over the spoon to eat the leftover mix right out of the pot!

Highly recommended!

Followed the recipe as it states and made it for a birthday/Sunday dinner. Doubled the celery,mushrooms and water chestnuts. Used the apricot glaze (doubled) and made 8 hens. Everyone raved about the dinner. My 29 year old son who works in restaurants said it was the best meal he ever had! Love the crunch of the water chestnuts!

This is the first recipe I tried from this website. I made it as is, along with the Apricot Glaze (which, by the way is a terrific add-on), and it was a huge success! The entire family enjoyed it, which sometimes is a real task to please everyone. We will definitely be making this again.

Fabulous.  I ditched the water chestnuts and cranberries, and added a lemon zest butter rub under the skin.  The hens were juicy, and the stuffing was absolutely delicious!  My family raved.

I would give this more than a 5 if I could!!!  I haven't made Cornish game hens since making them with my Mom when I was a kid.  I decided to try something different as my husband & I agreed we didn't want turkey or ham.  
I made 6 of these and added almonds.  I also doubled the stuffing to make sure I had enough for all 6 hens.  After stuffing well, I trussed the hens to make sure all the goodness stayed inside.  ;)
These were an instant hit with the family.  We will be making this a part of our Thanksgiving tradition every year!  Thanks for such an awesome recipe!  :)

These came out beautifully. the bird was juicy and the rice was tasty as well. I left out the Mushrooms, and water chestnuts. I replaced the green onions with a regular onion and I used melted butter & poultry seasoning and salt and pepper on the outside of the hens. I should have used more cranberries I only put in 1/4 cup.

I have to say this THE most tasteful Cornish Hen recipe I've made. I loved it along with my friends and co-workers.  The juiciness of the hens was incomparable to any other recipe, mouth watering.  The only changing I done was doubled the mushrooms and the cranberries.  I made 6 1.5lb hens and almost used every last spoon full of the stuffing.  I also used the apricot glaze as stated in other reviews.  Tented the chicken the last 20 minutes of cooking and remained tented 15-20 minutes after removing from oven.   I will most definitely make this recipe again.  Thank you for this recipe, it is by far my favorite for baked Cornish Hens.

Stellar recipe-- simple and delicious! I modified slightly by making a orange-ginger honey glaze for the hens. The leftover wild rice stuffing makes an excellent side dish for other meals, so save any extras!

Holy yum! The stuffing alone deserves 5 stars. I didn't have water chestnuts or mushrooms on hand, so I increased the celery to 1 cup and added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts. Will definitely make this again!

I have to admit, I have been cooking and baking for a number of years, but this recipe is absolutely to die for.  I followed the recipe as written however I did sprinkle the inside of the hens with poultry seasoning and garlic salt.  I also threw a pinch or two of the seasoning into the rice mixture.  I forgot to add the soy sauce to the rice before stuffing the hens, but poured a little into all the birds before throwing them into the oven.    I had some extra rice as I only had 2 birds so I put the extra rice into a buttered baking dish and put it into the oven about 15 minutes before the end of the baking time.  An hour didn't work for my oven so they actually baked for almost 2 hours.  I used extra chicken broth to baste the hens until the last 30 minutes when I basted the hens with the apricot glaze mentioned in other reviews and located on this website.  It was a perfect dinner for a romantic Friday evening!!!   Don't omit the water chesnuts as the smokey taste of the rice begs for some type of crunch and the water chestnuts hit the spot!!!  Its a do over, and I am even thinking of making the dressing for my Thanksgiving turkey!!!!! Thanks for sharing!!!!

MMMMMMM......DELICOUS! I made these for Easter dinner. The wild rice stuffing was divine!  Loved the texture of the water chestnuts and tartness of the cranberries... A wonderful, pretty holiday( or "impress your guests") meal.

This recipe was completely delicious.  I made it last night and I can't wait to get home to finish off the stuffing tonight.  Thank goodness there were leftovers.  :-)  I also used this recipe along with the "Apricot Glazed Cornish Hen" recipe found on this site.  Thanks to those who provided the tip.  I made this for a friend and he enjoyed it as well.  I didn't change anything in the recipe although he doesn't like water chestnuts so he took them out, but I found it a nice touch.

First time making cornish hens...made 2 for Christmas.  DELISH!  I accidentally bought Uncle Ben's Ready 90 minute Ready Rice so I added it just before step 2.  Chicken came out moist and dressing is delicious.

I found this recipe and my husband made it, so yummy! It was the first time for me to eat Cornish Hens, and I have to say it was delicious. My kids enjoyed it, which is the important part. I (or my husband) will definitely make this again. Also, we followed the recipe exactly, just reducing it to 4 servings, and we made gravy out of the juice! So yummy!

Okay...this was to first time I have ever made (or eaten) a Cornish hen.  If you have never had one, all it is a baby chicken.  The meat is more "moist" then a full grown chicken.  I though the flavor of the meat was not as tastey as regular chicken.  I will admit, for me, that it was a little strange eating such a little chicken.  The reason for my 5* is the rice was REALLY good!  I will make this rice with my everyday meals that I prepare.  I might even try adding some fresh Jalepenos to the mix to give some heat with the sweet.  I have no regrets making this meal and would make it if you have never had hens before.

The wild rice stuffing had amazing flavor.  I cooked this recipe as a trial run before serving it for Christmas.  I will definatley be using this recipe.  Although the stuffing was amazing I only gave this recipe 4 stars because I felt the outside of the hens could use a little bit more seasoning.

Fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly as planned but used it to stuff a turkey. I rubbed the turkey down with a mixture of olive oil, sage, thyme and a clove of crushed garlic. It was a huge hit and everyone wanted the recipe and seconds!

I just made this tonight and, following the other recommendations, the only change I made was that I added the Apricot Glaze from the Apricot Glazed Cornish Hen recipe from this site.  Everything else I followed exactly.  For us, it was good, not great.  We kept thinking something was missing but couldn't decide what that might be.  It could just be the brand of wild rice I used (90" Uncle Bens) but I can't imagine that making a big difference.  The glaze was wonderful so I will use that to top pork chops or chicken breasts for other meals.  Thanks for the recipe.  It is just not for us.

I made Stuffed hen for the first time using this recipe and of course the apricot glazed suggested by others. It was phenomenal. I didnt change a thing, except for omitting the water chestnuts. I had only four hens and that allowed me to over stuff all of the hens. I served with a medley of fried potatoes. All of my children thought it was great, my 13yr old step daughter even stated that the cranberries in the stuffing complemented the whole saltiness of the rice!!! Will Deff make again!

Oh my this recipe is divine!!!! The rice stuffing makes it so! This was so easy to pull off even a beginner could do it. I followed the stuffing part to a T. The only thing I did different was I garlic salted and peppered the hens and basted in real butter. It was mouth watering. Thank you Nancy for giving us such a wonderful recipe. I am going to steal the stuffing recipe and try it with pork. :))

This recipe is delicious.  The stuffing alone is 5 stars plus!  Whole family loved it, even my pickey 10 year old.  Will definitely make again!
