I used yellow corn meal. I think I'd prefer the white finer ground version for a lighter end result. The flavor was good but the texture was a little heavy for my idea of spoon bread.

I have been making this recipe for years- actually got it from a Mexican cookbook and it is exactly the same as this one. I have doubled it and trippled it. Never had problems with it being too greasy, or not sweet enough (never thought it should be sweet as it is a side to something like chili). We love it!!

I really wanted to like this more than I did.  Needs a little sugar and it has an odd texture. EDIT: Topped with sour cream and pico de gallo this is a solid 4 star recipe!

I added 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour and a pinch more baking soda and salt. I also used an 8x11 baking dish instead of a 9x9. The texture turned out just like I'd hoped it would. I will be making this again!

thought it was okay, but not spectacular.  With all the cheese & the green chilies, I thought it would be very flavorful, but it was just kind of average.  Made exactly as directed.

First of all, you should know this is not a sweet cornbread. So if you're used to a sweeter cornbread, this recipe, as written, will not work for you.

This cornbread smelled a little like soufflé while it was baking, and the texture is a cross between an eggy soufflé and a soft and moist cake. It also tasted like something made with masa to me, which is a flavor I really like because I grew up eating tortillas on a daily basis. I didn't taste the cheese or the sweetness of the corn.

Modifications I made:
-I didn't have monterrey jack so I used colby jack. O
-added green onions instead of the peppers 
-as suggested by another reviewer, I added half a cup of all purpose flour.
-brushed on some honey while it was still warm (it turned out well)

The texture and sweetness did not work for me in this recipe. Giving it 4 stars because my husband liked it though!

Actually attempted to make this in a dutch oven while camping. Forgot my cheese at home and had to improvise.  That did not work out.

Still, overall taste was good. I think I would add even more cheese than what it calls for.

Disgustingly greasy. I could actually pour oil off when it came out of the oven. I would appreciate input on how to improve the consistency of this recipe.
