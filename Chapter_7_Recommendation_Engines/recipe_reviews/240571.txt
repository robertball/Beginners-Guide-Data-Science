This is a great base recipe to change-up to your family's tastes / preferences. I cooked my rice with the onion before mixing with the chopped turkey (and I mixed in some thawed frozen veggies) and added a sprinkling of cheesy crackers over the top then baked 20 minutes and it was really good! My family ate it all up for a tasty weekend lunch.

I made this using cream of chicken soup because it's what I had on hand at the time and I used Uncle Bens original recipe wild rice. When it was time to take the lid/foil off, I stirred the casserole then put it back in the oven for 15 minutes. At then end of the 15 minutes I topped it with crushed white cheddar crackers and put it back in for 5 more minutes. It turned out very good and reheats well when taking it for lunch the next day.

This was a good start, but too basic for me. I wanted more than meat and rice, so I added about 4 diced carrots, a cup of diced celery, and doubled the onion. I also subbed thickened milk for the cream soup, and it worked just fine. My turkey had been seasoned with oregano and basil, so after it was baked, I sprinkled some parmesan. altogether, a really great winter casserole. Based on another review, I raised the temperature to 400 and it baked in about an hour and fifteen minutes.

It was good, but you need to cook the rice b/4 or use leftover  cooked wild rice.  I did that because of the reviews.  I added some carrots to the rice while it was cooking to give some color.  It goes in the file to make again according to my husband.

This has become a family favorite.  Substitute chicken breasts if turkey left overs arenâ€™t an option.  I also added carrots, celery and onions to add a little umph.  Most requested meal in our house!
