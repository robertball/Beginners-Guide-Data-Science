okay, I knew making this that there was a chance of it being syrupy (reading the reviews) but, as it's the only pear jelly recipe I thought I would give it a try.  Sure enough, very thin...so, after asking my mothers I have come up with this for future readers.  1.  I used liquid pectic (3oz).  My mother swears that gramma used to use powdered because she thought it also contained geletin.  so, I'm wondering if the other syrupy reviewers used liquid?  Also, the recipe did not state whether I should mash the pears, so basically I have pears in syrup.  Taste pretty good though, which is why I gave it two stars.  Will use on pancakes or something.  *Updated* mashed the pears and recanned.  worked out much better. So, mash your pears or you get syrup.

Great flavor and easy to make...  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  I was looking for a Pear jam recipe, so after the pears cooked I used my handheld mixed and pureed the pears before adding the pectin.  Great recipe.  Yum! Although be prepared... it makes a big batch.

This looked like a really good preserve recipe, but there was way too much syrup for the amount of pears.  Could there be a mistake in the amount of sugar called for?  8 cups seemed like a lot for only 6 cups of pears.  Definitely won't do again unless a recipe correction is received.

This makes wonderful jam. I followed the recipe exactly as written. The jam set quickly and was perfectly spiced. It's great on a bagel with cream cheese, as suggested by another reviewer. It is also great on a peanut butter sandwich or by itself.

Perhaps the other reviewers didn't let the jelly boil long enough after adding the pectin or sugar. That could make a difference.

I just made this recipe; I was originally looking for a pear butter recipe and this seemed pretty close after reading the reviews.  I reduced thecwhite sugar by 1/2-1 cup; reduced the nutmeg by 1/2 tsp, the cloves by 1 tsp, and added 3/4 tsp cinnamon.  I also increased the lemon juice to 2 TBSP and reduced the water by 1/2 cup.  After simmering the pear chunks I used my immersion blender to "puree" the pears (I did leave some fruit chunks).  I added a 1/2 tsp butter when I added the pectin to help reduce foaming.  I think I cooked the final mixture before the brown sugar and spice additions for 10 or more minutes to ensure setting.  I filled 10 8 oz. jars in the end and had a fragrant, tasty "butter."  If I made this again I think I would replace the water with pear nectar for added "pearness."

This recipe is great!!  I had some pears from my Fathers pear tree and froze them.  I thawed them, cut them up and made this recipe.  I did alter it a bit (I always seem to be altering recipes).  I did not have nutmeg so I used cinnamon.  I also doubled the amount of cinnamon and Allspice.  And I added more brown sugar.  Made an amazing batch of Preserves.  Tastes excellent.  I got 7  1/2 pint jars and 2 pint jars.  Two of the half pint jars are more liquid than the rest, does anyone know why this would be?  Anyway I highly recommend this recipe.  It is delicious.

I thought this recipe turned out excellent and is now my favorite recipe for pear preserves.  I have canned a lot of pear preserves but decided to try a new recipe and found this one and I love it.  It has a wonderful rich flavour and very easy to make.  Thanks for sharing this recipe

I was looking for a spicy pear preserve recipe and am glad I found this one!  It is easy and very, very yummy.  I am looking forward to making a pear preserve cake at Christmas with a jar of these!  These are a perfect fall/winter preserve for your breakfast and brunch table.  Would make lovely gifts too.

Very straight forward directions made this recipe easy to follow.  The results are scrumptuous -- and I'm not a pear fan!  I tried the receipe once yesterday (while I was canning various fruit from our yard).  It was so good that I made a second batch!  This is even good enough to include in the jam sampler basket I give to my kids' teachers as Christmas gifts.  Thanks for sharing!  This recipe is a real winner.

I give this 5 stars for flavor, but 1 star for poor directions and a set failure, with an average of 3 stars.  If there is a next time I make this I will follow the directions given on the pectin product with the following changes to give it this recipe's spicyness and nice touch of brown sugar: 4 cups chopped pears, 2 tbs. fresh lemon juice, 1 package pectin (which happens to be only 1.75 oz.), 4 1/2 cups white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar (just substituting 1/2 cup brown sugar for a total of 5 cups sugar), 1 1/4 tsp. allspice and 1 tsp. nutmeg (I can't believe I'm saying this since I adore spices, but there was WAY too much allspice in this recipe).  Notice I would not add water, I believe this is why this recipe fails at setting.  The recipe on the pectin box does not include water since the pears break down and basically melt anyway.  Do step one as listed here, step two would exclude the water and I would simmer uncovered to let any extra liquid evaporate.  I would add both sugars and the spices once the pear, lemon juice and pectin mixture comes to a rolling boil.  Return to a rolling boil for a minute then can as step 4 states. 

I have made numerous jam, preserve, jelly, and canning recipes in general and this one was just poorly written.  Try it with the above recommendations and I'm sure it will set and be as it should.  It is delicious, but syrupy instead of gelled. 

I'm hoping to use what I have to make the pear preserves cake on this site and I would love to try i

Very good and set great! I changed a few things. Used 8 cups pears, 2 TBLS lemon juice, and no water only put 1/4 of spices called for. I put all this in pot first and cooked until pears were soft. Only used 4 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown mixed together and all put in at same time. Make sure you have a full rolling boil before timing 1 min.have made two runs so far and have 22 half pint jars.

I had been looking for an old fashion pear preserve recipe and this was it. I made it today and thought it was perfect. I wanted the taste I remembered as a child and this was it. I grew up in Georgia with home made biscuits and pear preserves and yes they were syrupy and that is just how I like them.

This is another one of those recipes you shouldn't be allowed too rate unless you spent at least 90'% of your life below the Mason Dixon. Like many of the other southern recipes that require a particular skill set to make, made correctly, this is the best peaar preserves I've ever made.

I would like to thank you for sharing, you did not have to but you did! I live in the deep south & the pears are different here. For an experienced cook/canner, this recipe can be adjusted to work out great. I  cooked pears down until tender then mashed them with a potato masher, cut the water to 1/4 cup, cut the sugar to 4 cups, & added 1 box of unflavored geletin. I did not add the spices because I like the simple flavor of the fruit. I think I might add a couple of apples next time. It really congealed well and turned out great! I hope this helps those of you who might need guidance with canning preserves!

I think that the people who are having problems are not familiar with the jam making process. NEVER use less sugar than the recipe calls for.  To add less will most certainly cause there to be a jelling problem.  I mashed up the pears as they cooked.  I followed the recipe and it turned out great.  I was a little worried at first with the spices but they were just right.  Very homey and old timey and just delicious.  I think this would be very good on vanilla ice cream during the winter.  Thank you for a great recipe.  I needed to find a way to preserve an abundance of free pears from my friend's tree.

REDUCED SUGAR BY HALF!!  This was my first time making preserves...I used 5 cups sliced pears, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1/2 cup water, 2oz pectin, 3.5 cups white sugar, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1/4 cup brown sugar.  The only modification in the cooking process was that I used a potato masher to mash the pears before the sugar, leaving some chunks.  It gelled nicely and tastes great!

This was my first attempt at preserves and I found the recipe fairly easy.  I followed other reviews and cut the spices to 1/2 teaspoon each.  I also cooked the pears for about 20 minutes, frequently mashing them with a potato masher until they were more like pear sauce than pear chunks.  I did use 1 and 1/2 boxes of pectin, rather than 1 box, to make up for the difference in the amount in the recipe and the amount in 1 box of pectin.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and a few basic canning tips from other sites.  I had no problem with the preserves setting.  They were fine the next day and seem to have set even more a week later.  This is great on PB&J sandwiches, english muffins and just plain toast.  A keeper at our house and will make yummy holiday gifts for co-workers and neighbors.  I have made two batches and got 9, 8oz. jelly jars from each batch.

I thought this was an excellent recipe. I just finished making it and left some in a bowl. It is setting up beautifully. My kids and I tried it on some toast and love it! I hate when changes are made to recipes on this site before making it the original way first, but after reading all the reviews and noticing a LOT of people had theirs turn out syrupy I felt I had to make adjustments. I also looked at my Mamaw's pear recipe and noticed she said to lessen the sugar if the pears were ripe. So I did this. I used 5 1/2 cups of sugar for 6 cups of pear chunks. Her original recipe said 1 cup of sugar for 1 cup of pears and someone else noted that too. I had a container of powdered pectin. I used about 5 T of pectin. I used Bartlett pears and mine were pretty ripe. I Cooked them for 10 minutes, stirred and chopped them even smaller, cooked for 10 minutes more to make them nice and tender. I then added everything else as stated. I think the spices can be adjusted according to your taste.

Beautiful in jars. Great tasting, and quite gourmet. I just cut back on the water and sugar I also added a touch of blackberries for color to the 2nd batch. Gave it a formal look for holiday. I had no problem with it being syrupy after cutting back on water. I loved it. And the taste was unique thanks to your Grandma!

Like a few other poster, my first attempt turned out runny.  More user error than anything :).  For my second attempt a made a few minor changes.  Decreased the all spice and nutmeg to half a tsp.  And actually used 2 oz of pectin by using 1 and 1/2 boxes.  Pectin boxes now only come in 1.75 oz boxes.  I also cooked the pears for about 30 minutes and mashed them with a potato masher before adding the pectin and sugar.  Turned out great.

Hope this helps anyone,I followed the recipe. and everything was fine, so I thought I would let you know, I feel you must stir all the time after the simmering, and make sure it comes to a boil while stirring before finishing that step.  I did have to let my pears coo more than the 10 minutes, I let them cook 20, because I wanted to be able to use a potato masher to cut then in to chucks. and they did not get soft enough till then, I then followed the recipe. making sure that I contuined to stir and the pears boiled, add the pectin and 1/2 tsp of butter, due to the box said to.(however my box was 1.75 oz of sure jell.) I then stirred until it came to a complete boil while stirring, ( I had my sugar, measured and in 1 bowl, and my brown sugar and spices( which I added 2 tsp cimnnamon because I like it.lol)in another bowl. poured in sugar and when it came back to a boil while still stirring set timer ro 1 minute. took off heat and  poured brown sugar and spices in and contiuned to stir.I did keep my jars in the boiling water so they was hot when I put the pears in. put lids on and put back into the boiling water for 10 minutes. I have not tried them yet, but felt I would go ahead and do my review because taste was not a problem, Mine did not have a lot of juice and set fine, did make the amount stated.

Great Recipe!  I have made 3 batches today and each one was better.  The first was a heavy on the syrup, the second was more fruit but not quite enough, the third was perfect.  BEST ADVICE....use 3 lbs of pears before you peal and dice and then cram the 4 cups of fruit in the measuring cup.  I did this the 3rd time and it was wonderful, lots of fruit with the perfect amount of syrup.  Today was my first attempt at canning.....I think I am hooked!!!

I don't know what happened, I followed the recipe exactly and it was sickening sweet. It also didn't set up and it was mostly thick syrup and not many pears. I used unripe pears not green green but not eating ripe either. Thought maybe would be ok on vanilla ice cream but still WAAAAAAAAAy TO SWEET.
I have made jams/preserves for years and have never had a problem like this.
I dumped all 10 jars out and will make something else. I was really disappointed because this was something different and was going to use in my Christmas Baskets.

I haven't made this, although I have made lots of jelly! There are multiple things that can cause jelly or jam to not set, all a person can do is try to correct it. The first time this happened to me I went online looking for solutions and this is what I found and it worked great for me! This is for powdered pectin ONLY, I didn't get the recipe for liquid as I prefer powdered. ~~Measure 1 Tbsp water and 1 1/2 tsp pectin for each cup of jelly or jam you have. Bring it to al boil in a saucepan. CAREFUL, as this is thick and you have to work the 2 into each other. Remove from heat and stir into jelly that has been heating on the stove. Then, add 2 Tsp of sugar for each cup of jelly and bring to rolling boil for 1 min. Put in sterilized jars.

I used liquid pectin and had to double the dose because if not it comes out very syrupy. Great pear preserves. We bought a farm in SC and it had an orchard with pear trees and this was the first year that we had pears, and lots of them. Thanks.

Did not like this recipe at all.  The sugar:pear ratio too much sugar:  Too runny:  The spices over power the fruit:  Will not be using this recipe again.

This was very easy and good. The only problem i had was that the recipe did not say how long u should wait until u eat. I had a lot of juice left over and i just put in some jars also. I will use for waffles or pancakes.

My biggest mistake?  NOT reading the reviews! I don't know why I skipped that step!!  I have ended up with GREAT tasting syrup with big chunks of pear! Next time I will be cooking the pears longer, using a potato masher, and adding more pectin.

This is awful. It only got one star because that's the least I can do. I've been trying to find a pear preserve recipe like my grandma made, and this is definitely not it. I reduced the sugar by 3 cups and the water by 1/2. I still ended up with soup - WAY to much syrup with a few bits of pears floating in it. It set fine though; try using dry pectin not liquid. Will NOT try this one again.

I'll rate this at 5 stars because of the fantastic taste.  It's a little too liquid, so, I'll add more pectin the next time around.

The orignial 48 servings will yield 10 half-pint containers.

My Mother, Father and I made this yesterday and it smelled and tasted delicious.  Today, it still seems to not want to set.  We had a hard time once we put in the pectin to get the pot back to a boil.  We are hoping it will set and turn out good.

I was trying to remember my mother's pear preserve recipe because I am going to make them tomorrow for the first time. After viewing this and seeing comments about too much syrup, I remembered my mother used 1 cup of sugar per 1 cup of pears. I am going to rate this 5 stars because someone took the time to post a pear preserve recipe. It has been 40 years since I have watched my mother make preserves.

Very good!  The kids love it.  Didn't change a thing and it turned out perfect.  Yes you have to use a hand blender or something to puree the pears, and I always use a powdered pectin.  Not sure why others are having a syrup consistency.  I read somewhere once that in canning jams if you want it thicker, you do something different with the fruit.  Mine was actually very thick.  Read your pectin insert, it has a lot of information.

WOW - this is a keeper! Thanks for sharing;  I "accidently" used 1 Pouch of Certo Liquid pectin and the jam set up very well; I also carefully pureed the pears with a stick blender after simmering to minimize the chunks because we like a little smoother texture; AMAZING!  Next time I will try with a little less sugar to see how that works.

Wonderful! I used half low-sugar pectin, half regular pectin and cut the white sugar to 4 cups. I only used 1/2 a tsp of allspice and nutmeg and added a few dashes of cinnamon. My kids LOVED this. Each batch made 7 half pint jars for me.

Came out very tasty, but it did come out more like the consistency of honey with fruit in it, only a little more runny. I was hoping for more thickness. Still good on toast. :)

I did not read the reviews prior to making this and wish I did. I usually do...anyway, I doubled this recipe and when I started pouring the sugar I thought 16 cups was a lot, so I put in 12 cups. I used everything else exactly and I added another 2 oz of pectin (so 6 altogether). There were definitely not enough pears. I pureed what was in there and added an additional 12 cups (making it 24 cups altogether). The 12 cups I diced and cooked them in another pan with just water. I then aded them to the syrup. It was still too sweet, so to counteract the sweetness I added 3 more tbsp of lemon juice (making it 5 tbsp altogether). I ended up with 30 - 8 oz. jars. The preserves are still very very sweet. I thought about putting it on ice cream or maybe adding it into bread recipes and don't use an additional sugar in your bread recipes. My son LOVED this on toast, and he has a sweet tooth.

The syrup had a good flavor, there was just so much more syrup than pears for the ratio I prefer. I prefer the jars to have pears floating from top to bottom with syrup in between. On the second batch, I put 9 cups of sliced pears to 6 cups sugar. Turned out great.

Taste was ok.  Way too much spice.  Allspice is overpowering.  Mine needed a little extra cooking time or something.  It was too runny.  Cooked the first batch and threw it out.  Did not set and tasted too strong.  Second batch was better.  Used only half the spices and added more pectin.  Will try again maybe with no spices.  I really liked the flavor before adding anything more than brown sugar at the end.  Can be a great recipe to "tweek" to your own personal taste.

This was a wonderful recipe the first time I've ever canned anything. I pureed the pears first cause I'm not fond of anything too chunky and then I fiddled slightly with the spice reducing the allspice and nutmeg by 1/2 a tsp and adding 1/2 a tsp each of ginger and cinnamon. The preserves smell wonderful and taste like christmas! They have a beautiful deep mahogany color. My only problem seems to be that my lids didn't seal. Will wait 24 hours and try to reprocess again if seals fail. I know alot of the reviews complained about it being too syrupy but I did not have the problem at all, cooled it seems to be the consistency of jam.

I followed this recipe to a tee and when my jars cooled off, I was left with a watery top and heavy sugary syrup on top. It sure smelled good though. I'm new to making preserves so I'm sure I did something wrong, but I don't know what.  If anyone has a clue, I would love to hear it.  Thanks

Used this recipe and it turned out great!  So happy to have something to do with the last of the pears.  I made the recipe exactly as written and got a texture between jam and syrup which is exactly what preserves should be.  So versatile!

This recipe is very tasty! I took the advise from one of the others and while my pears were simmering I mashed them. Other than that I followed the recipe step by step and it turne out great and thick! No runny syrup at all!

I love your grandmother's recipe.  In reading reviews, and being new at canning,(but not cooking)I used 8c pears,6c sugar and 2c brown sugar. I love the rich taste. The pectin came in 1.75z pkgs instead of 2z so I weighed out 2.25z.(x-tra pectin added because of reviews). Changed around some spices to my liking (1/4 tsp fresh ginger, 1 tbs cinnamon, 1 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp grated nutmeg)and everything worked. Thank you for sharing this recipe, it is wonderful!

I've made the pear honey also listed on this site. It's good. It's possibly what many are looking for in a pear preserve/jam/jelly kind of way. Hope it helps.

This turned out to be a little runny for me.  And my husband said it had to much all spice in it.  I took a jar that I had left, and made a cobbler out of it.  It cut the allspice down, and my husband said he did not want another peach cobbler as long as I put up pear like this.  It is wonderful.

I thought the spices overpowered  the taste of the pears.  I think I will leae out the spices next time and maybe decrease the water content like another person had suggested.

Ive made this twice now. It has a magnificent taste, but mine also did not set right either time. I added extra pears the second time as I was left with syrup at the end. I am gonna make again and add an extra 1/2 pack at least of sure jell. I dont use liquid, not for any reason than Ive never trid it. I will suggest taking a jar of this and pouring over your ham (especially a sprial cut one)before you bake it pushing it the cracks of the meat. Excellent nice flavor. I will make this again and gave as gifts and everyone loved it. Thanks

I love this recipe! Reminds me a bit of old fashioned apple butter flavors.I ground fresh allspice and was worried it would be to pungent but it tempered after sitting a month Goes great with cream cheese on toasted bagels also on vanilla icecream. Thanx for sharing your Grandma's recipe.

I did this in large part based on the reviews.  I must have done something wrong - the liquid, after 2 weeks, is no where close to set - it's of a light syrup consistency.  I didn't deviate from the recipe, or so I thought.

Sorry to be negative, but I made this recipe today and ended up dumping it.  First problem, I hate recipes that say "Stir in the white sugar, and continue boiling and stirring uncovered for 1 minute, until sugar is dissolved."  When I dumped in the sugar, I stirred it over the highest heat for at least 10 minutes before it boiled.  THEN, I timed 1 more minute.  Instructions like this are vague, because it always takes time to return to a boil, and you have no idea about the timing at that point!  Secondly, I thought the sugar had completely dissolved at that point (shouldn't it have by then?), but found out after jarring it that it had not - very grainy.  Thirdly, and mainly, the preserves are so sweet they are inedible.  The ratio of sugar to pears HAS to be a mistake.  Again, sorry for the bad report.

I agree with the posters who said there was too much spice.    I halved the spice and it's still on the verge of too much.

Followed the recipe exactly adjusting for the amount of pears I had.  I used powdered pectin and this set beautifully.  We felt it tasted like our grandmothers made.  I am looking forward to putting this on vanilla ice cream this winter.  It is now my go to pear recipe.

I was reading the reviews before I made this recipe and for everyone who said it was too runny typical Pear Jam is 3lbs of fruit to 5 cups of sugar so adjust accordingly. I am currently making now so I will rate after I am finished.

Loved the ease of this recipe! Also I have taken into account the "syrupy" comments. It looks like this is a North Carolina Pear recipe... NC pears are a hard dry pear not like what you may see elsewhere. Mine did not turn out like a fully set up jelly but exactly what i would expect from a preserve... with my local NC pears that is...

First time making preserves and was so excited! Did cut the sugar to 6 cups because of reviews. Still way too much syrup! Pears need to be chopped fine, did not break down well. They're still in the cooker, hope they thicken up!! Cut spices to 1 tsp. of each.

This did not turn out right at all. I spent a good bit of my time making this and it turned out liquidy. Now, I have over 15 jelly jars full of liquidy pears that are good for nothing.  Thanks.

After fixing this recipe,I was looking around for a tv film crew to  tell  me you 've been punked  A lot of good ingredients could have been used in something else. To much liquid, and I even got tired of waiting, and put this mixture in my crockpot overnight and it still didn't thickened.  Somebody  must have witheld an ingredient or instruction or two.

THIS WAS HORRIBLE. I AM SO SORRY BUT I COULDN'T EVEN FINISH MY BISCUIT. THE CONSISTENCY WAS FINE BUT THE TASTE IS WAY TO SWEET. YOU COULDN'T EVEN TASTE THE PEARS. I WILL KEEP LOOKING FOR A BETTER RECIPE AND POST ONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

I make many kinds of jam and preserves each year and was eager to try my hand at pear preserves. This was terrible. I thought I had made a mistake the first time, so I made it again paying close attention to the ingredients and cooking time. It smelled delicious while cooking, but it was a complete waste of ingredients. I expected it to be runny from the reviews, but the results were beyond redemption. I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

I made this today and it is good but.....I had to tweak a few things. First I did not no way use 8 cups of sugar!  I only used 2 1/2 to 3 cups sugar. Also, it doesn't state it in the recipe but you definitely need to mash the pears some once they get soft. I like a few small chunks left but not big ones. One last thing, I think I should have used a little less Allspice. It was a tad over powering BUT THAT'S MY OPINION!! All in all though this is a great fall recipe to make with your pears.

I forgot to say what to do with the peels and cores:  Cover with sugar, 1 tbs lemon juice, and refrigerate overnight.  Cook as you would the pear preserves, but strain the syrup into pint jars and process as pears for pear honey.

I made these preserves and they came out delicious. I put it on my turkey, ham and made everything that much better. Great on toast or biscuits and in oatmeal.


Next pear crop, I will jar them up for gifts.

This was my first time making this recipe. It is so good that I used a spatula to scrape the bottom of the sauce pan to eat the leftovers. I did however make sure that after I added the sugar to bring to a full rolling boil and then counted down the 1 minute. They jelled nicely

There is too much syrup and not enough fruit. Next time I make it, I will use 8 cups of fruit and 6 cups of sugar. It tasted really good though and it set just as the receipt said it would.

it's going to come out runny, like everyone else says.  I used an immersion blender to break up about 2/3 of the cooking fruit.  still delicious and reminds me of my Granny's recipe for pear preserves.

I doubled the recipe, used apples instead of pears, halved the sugar, used low sugar pectin, and only a pinch of allspice and nutmeg.  Even with only half the sugar, it still is sickeningly sweet, and I couldn't imagine using 2 whole tsp each of the spices! I used a very chilled plate to test for doneness  like I do my jam. Next batch I will slice the fruit thicker and not add any spices for a pure apple/pear flavor! Glad I found this.

I gave this 2 stars for taste it was good, but very runny,I have added a lot of corn starch(close to full can) and that is still not helping.I did use powder pectin,if it does not thicken I will have to try the  mash the pears trick.I removed 2 cups of liquid and it was still very runny I used potato masher on pears because I do want pears in it.I decided to toss it out and forget it.

Just a note:  if you process for 10 minutes or more, there is no need to sterilize the jars.  Just make sure to heat them before adding the cooked pears.

WAY too much sugar and spices that totally obliterate the taste of the pears.

If I make this again I would cut the sugar, allspice and nutmeg in half.

It tastes EXACTLY how I remember my grandmother's preserves tasting. I followed the recipe exactly. I did not expect it to be a jelly like most people in the reviews. I expected it to be a syrupy sweet goodness that goes over hot biscuits straight out of the oven. And that is exactly what I got!  Spices & sweetness are perfect. No modifications needed. Thank you for this recipe! I have logged it as a fave!

Very good spice flavor in this recipe not just plain pear preserves... Compliments from friends and family who I shared this with also.

This was a good starter recipe. This is a recipe that you kinda have to nip and tuck as you go along and watch it cook. I made 2 batches. The first was all syrup and the amount of sugar was frightening. The second batch was a tiny bit less syrupy: I doubled the pectin, used 10 cups of pears, and halved the sugar. The "runny" preserves I ended up with would be great as pancake topping, on ice cream, in steel cut oatmeal, the pear chunks could be strained out and put on toast, etc.

Have made this many time over the years. (my gram love it) I find if my pears are very ripe I squeeze out the extra juice. Then I add the juice to the water and only add 1 cup. It seems to work.

I agree with a previous post that the spices could be cut some.  A little strong for my taste. Overpowers the pears.

First batch was syrupy so for second batch, I reduced the sugar to 6 1/2 cups. I substituted cinnamon for nutmeg for both batches. (Was out of nutmeg.) Followed recipe instructions but cooked for 9 minutes stirring constantly after I added brown sugar and spices. Think I will reduce water by half next time. These preserves are YUMMY! Think I will use syrupy preserves for topping on cake and ice cream??

I have made pear preserves before but couldn't find my recipe. This one sounded good so I tried it. I am disappointed. Although it has a good taste I ended up with jars with liquid on bottom and a few floating pears on top. It definitely needs some kind of adjustments.
