I made this for my 10 year old son who was asking for a new peanut butter dessert.  I have to admit that I was bit skeptical about this recipe at first, but since it seemed simple and I had all the ingredients on hand, I figured I'd give it a shot...and I'm glad I did.  First off, this recipe is so simple and easy that kids could make it themselves.  The sugar cookie "crust" with the peanut butter makes it taste like a peanut butter cookie with Reese's on top.  This would also be a nice easy dessert (thought a bit messy) for a pot luck, if you're looking to bring something different.

I made this for a 7 yr old's birthday party & it was a hit ( especially with grandpa!). I also made this in a 13 x 9 jelly roll pan as I was transporting this. I let the peanut butter and sugar cookie dough come to room temperature to make sure it would spread. It was easy and quick to put together & looked great. I also used mini peanut butter cups and cut each piece into square bite sized cookies just before serving. I suggest keeping this in the refrigerator until ready to serve as it quickly began to 'melt'. Will do again and maybe try different 'candy' toppings or drizzle chocolate on top.

Everyone loved these and many asked for the recipe.  I made them in a 13x9 pan so they were more like a bar cookie but still excellent.  I did add a little bit of vanilla to the frosting cause I thought it needed it.  Frosting was a bit hard to spread and was very peanut buttery might try something to make it a little smoother next time.  Will make again!

The peanut butter layer was so thick I added an 8 ounce block of cream cheese to it to make it spreadable.  The result was fabulous.

This was just ok for us. I made my own sugar cookie dough, but otherwise followed the recipe. I'm not sure how the peanut butter "frosting" is supposed to spread, mine was super thick and almost impossible to spread. It tasted pretty good, and my kids liked it, but I can't rate a recipe 5 stars that I have to make a bunch of alterations to so it will work. I won't make this again.

We give this recipe a 3 1/2 stars because of the peanut butter was a little too thick. Also, the cookie was a bit crumbly. We recommend to let it chill letting it chilled a bit longer.

Actually think it made the cookie dough worse than the boring stuff it was before I put the peanut butter "frosting" on. It just tasted like a load of peanut butter with a crunchy bottom. Didn't have peanut butter candies to chop and and put on top (thank goodnesss!), but did add the chocolate chips...which were not enough to add another dimension. So, I warmed up some hot fudge sauce and drizzled it over the top. Looked prettier, but only slightly improved the taste. Will not waste the extra ingredients to make this again!

This is a very cute recipe.  It was a great starting point for me. I made my own cookie dough and doctored up the pb topping/spread and added various toppings I had on had. All in all it came out great. Thanks for a fun recipe!

I made this as a present for my dad and it was amazing!! It fell apart a little bit so we just ate it with forks, but I would highly recommend making this.   BUT IT IS VERY UNHEALTHY!!!!:(
