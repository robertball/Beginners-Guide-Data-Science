We made it first for company, then only 4 days later we took the ingredients to the lake and shared with friends. Fabulous, fun, tasty Summer dish! 

Although the purple onions add a splash of color, I believe they're a bit "much" on the palette and I think I'd go for a sweet yellow onion next time. I did NOT use the gluten free taco mix as it was not available to me where I shopped. But it still turned out GREAT.

The whole family loved the meat. For the life of me I couldn't get the corn cut into small pieces but otherwise  followed the recipe.  The taste is amazing!!!! Definitely adding to my favorites!!
