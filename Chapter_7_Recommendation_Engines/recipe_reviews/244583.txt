All our favorite flavors of fall, wrapped up into one delicious side dish.  I cooked the sausage first, added the celery, onion and apples. I also added dried cranberries.   Cooked that for a bit and then added the broth, to heat it. 
I used all cubed stuffing, because that is what we like.  Tossed it all together and re-heated in a 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes.

I added some garlic to the sausage when cooking... sometimes some finely diced carrots as well as craisins.  Whatever strikes my mood at the time.  It ALWAYS comes out great!

Super easy and yummy! I doubled the sausage as we really like sausage. Came out perfect!
