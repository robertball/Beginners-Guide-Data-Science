I have to say my family and I were extremely disappointed in this recipe. The sandwich was very bland.

This sandwich was sensational a new twist on an old favorite! My whole family loved it, even my 4 & 1 year olds. The sprout gave it great texture, these cheeses are a delicous mixture. This is definately a new family favorite!
 * I must say this sandwich is not bland in the least.

I made as written for the first sandwich and I too thought it was a little on the bland side. For the 2nd sandwich I tossed the crab in some zesty Italian salad dressing prior to putting it on the sandwich and this bumped up the flavor quite a bit. I loved all of the different textures and colors going on and this is one I would make again.  Next time I will add some red onion slices and maybe even some bacon.
