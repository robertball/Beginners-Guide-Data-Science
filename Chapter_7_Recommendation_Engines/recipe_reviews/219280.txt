These are quite good, and extremely easy to make. I gave it four stars because I couldn't take away just a half star, and even though they're good, they do taste much like they were made with canned pie filling, which they obviously are. Now, that being said, these are better (and less canned pie filling flavored) the day after they are made - it gives the flavors more time to blend together and they're just better tasting. The brownies also get fudgier at that point as well.

The entire family enjoyed these, and I will definitely make them again at some point. Next time I'll just make them the day before I want to serve them to give the flavors time to meld.

I made these but took them out after 53 minuntes.  They were underbaked.  Everyone loved them but all said I should have baked them longer.  Very good!  I will definitely make again.

I made this recipe exactly as written. Don't be surprised if your "cream cheese batter" almost completely covers the brownie batter when you spoon it on top; just make sure to cut plenty with the knife to swirl the two together. Next time I will spread my cherries out a little better because I kind of had them clumped together, so some pieces didn't get as much cherry on them. I baked them close to an hour before they were done; the cream cheese was just starting to brown.  I made them for the men working in the field, and my cousin exclaimed "these should be illegal.  I could eat these every day".  I loved them as well.

I had all the ingredients on hand except the type of cherry pie filling I had was sweetened with Splenda.  Not a big deal, and nobody noticed either.  This was a great dessert, quick, easy and very tasty!

These were delicious and went over very well at my DH's work. I made the brownie part according to the instructions on the box rather than the instructions here. These come out very pretty and hold their shape nicely for cutting if you refrigerate them (after completely cooling them at room temp) overnight. I think they'd make a very popular, pretty addition to a Christmas tray. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as the recipe called and it was unbelievable! I went to a benefit and they were all gone in about 10 minutes. However I did keep a few for home! I will be making this recipe again and again!

Yummy:)  Added choc chips to brownies.  Probably a bit extra cream cheese, too.  Just made brownies as suggested on pkg (for how many eggs, etc).

These just did not turn out well for me.  I baked them in a 9x13 pan and baked for 50 minutes, but the edges were very dark brown and they tasted overbaked.  The cream cheese layer did not taste creamy enough and did not have a good flavor.  The photo of these brownies look good, but the taste just did not matchup.  Won't be making these again.

I screwed up and automatically put the brownies in the oven while making the cheescake part! Realized suddenly and ran to take them out of oven.. ..the edges were starting to cook...center still uncooked...quickly made topping.. put it on and swirled it  and then added cherries ...popped back in oven. Well they turned out great !! A lil soggy in center and i had cooked them longer than said to. The kids moaned that they were awesome!

I made this for my husband's birthday, and it turned out amazing! I have been known to destroy brownies by putting goodies on top, then accidentally under-baking (my s'mores brownies were like goop!). The brownies I chose were chocolate chunk, and of course, when I read the back of the package, they weren't supposed to make enough for a 9x13 pan. But I spread the batter in the pan anyway - it made a thin layer, and after baking for 50 minutes, they turned out perfectly chewy! The cheesecake baked up nicely, too. My hubby loved them! Thanks for the delicious recipe.

This is one of the most excellent desserts I have tried recently.  It is moist, chewy, fudgey, cheesecakey and fruity.  I made it as directed, but I did use only the ingredients on the brownie package and not the ones in the list.  I also always use Kahlua in any box brownie mix in place of the water.  It was perfectly done in 53 minutes.

I liked this.  I used Oregon Pitted Cherries, thinking it was cherry filling, and you can imagine my shock when I dumped the contents of the can with the juice and all onto the marbled brownie mixture...drained to the best of my ability the juice and proceeded.  It turned out really, really well.  So, well, that this is one I will add to my "Dad's list" of recipes.  I had a piece of the final product and I loved it.  I used a 9 x 9 and the result was more cake like.  Thanks for a great addition to the recipe book!

Very nice dessert! They only thing I changed is I didn't want to use a store bought brownie mix so I made a brownie recipe from scratch and it worked out great!
