My whole family loves these! Though, i do roll the balls in fine cornflake crumbs before baking.  It makes them a beautiful golden color and adds a little crispiness to the outside.

This was a fun one to serve my son. He usually does not like potatoes but he enjoyed this flavorful version. They were easy to make and you can prepare them in advance and store them in the fridge until you are ready to put them in the oven. Instead of processed cheese I used grated cheddar cheese. I also recommend using the precooked bacon as it is easier to crumble. I also sprinkled the final product with parsley to improve the presentation. Great recipe!!

Good Recipe - all favorite ingredients.  Be sure to spray ice cream scoop w/nonstick spray and potatoes slip right out.  Only reason didn't rate 5 is because they cooled off so very fast-but they looked great and were kid-sized!  We'll think about how to keep them warmer next time.

The taste of the mash was very nice. However I didn't feel that rolling the mash into balls and baking them added anything to the overall flavour. It was a lot of extra effort for very little result.

Not really sure what the purpose of this recipe is - it just tastes like mashed potatoes to me. Balling it and baking it just adds more work and no flavor or real change in texture.

This was good, but for some reason I couldn't get them to come off the pan very easy. But the taste was still very good. I didn't change anything in the recipe.

VERY tasty! However, I wish they would've remained round balls after baking, they spread out, but that may have been due to the sour cream I added. I would eliminate that next time. I also let them cook for a minute or two under the broiler to get them crispier on top.

My husband really liked these. They were a bit to time intensive for me on a weeknight but definitely something I will repeat on the weekends.

I've been making a similar recipe for years and there are a couple of things I do to add some zing.  

To 2 lbs. mashed potatoes add 3 oz. cream cheese, 1/4 cup milk, cheese (I use grated parm)  1/2 tbsp. melted butter, 2 1/2 teas. instant onion mix,  1 teas. diced green onion, bacon, 1/2 teas. seasoned salt and pepper and dash of hot sauce.  Make into balls (refrigerating it for an hour makes it easier to handle), roll in 1 large beaten egg and roll in 1 1/2 cups cornflake crumbs.  On greased pan bake at 400 degrees about 10 minutes or until heated through or 30 minutes if make ahead and refrigerated.  

Great company dish!

This recipe is a fun and tasty one! Really loved the combination of potato, bacon and the cheese. But I would have to agree with other reviews that it balling and baking are extra efforts that do not make significant changes to the flavour of the mashed potatoes
