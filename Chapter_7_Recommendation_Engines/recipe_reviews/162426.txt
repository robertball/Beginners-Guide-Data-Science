This was a dense moist cake. My sister doesn't care for cakes that have potatoes, carrots, or even strawberries in them. She couldn't taste the potatoes, and now is constantly asking me to make it. Great cake.

Overall a nice recipe, it came out like a brownie cupcake. Very dense, sweet and chocolaty. I did not use room temperature eggs. I had boiled the sweet potato with some cinnamon sticks on the stove previous to pureeing it.  I also added a sprinkle of allspice and they came out tasting like Abuelita Chocolate. My dad had two which means they were good!

this is now my go-to chocolate cake recipe. I am serious! You cannot believe how moist and very chocolaty this is!!!! update: I had an extra can of coca-cola that needed a purpose and found a coca cola cake from this website and I believe in the mashed potato so much from THIS recipe, that i basically combined the two recipes! you have got to try this recipe to believe it! I didn't even use fresh potatoes! I always have extra boxes of instant potato flakes because they are given to me and I never use them. Now I know they are great to bake with! Try it!!!!! By the way, I want to try this without any chocolate at all, just lots of vanilla and see if it is still great!

This was the best chocolate cake I've made in a long time - everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe! I topped the cake with a traditional ganache - we were in chocolate heaven! Just make sure your mashed potatoes are creamy before adding them. Yummy!!
