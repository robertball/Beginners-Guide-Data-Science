These are alot of fun.  The key to keeping it look like a lava lamp is to break the jello shot up really well with a fork.  I put it in the flute first, mashed it, then added the champagne, beautiful.  Thanks!

Let the jello sit at rom temp for just a little bit.  It will rise to the top better if it is not fresh from the fridge.

Made for New Years and they were a hit.  Definitely something different.  I don't usually like jello shots, but I loved them with the champagne.  Made 2 batches, strawberry and blackberry. Yum!

Made these little treats for New Year's Eve, and watch out!  They are wonderful, but will definitely sneak up on you!  I have made them several times after, and everyone always loves them.

I think you have to be a jello shot fan to like this drink. I don't like jello shots and thought this drink was gross. Sorry. But what I did do for the kids was make regular jello (red or blue) and add it to Sprite. They loved it!!

These were great! I had to use only one table spoon of the gelatine shots per glas (only had one Jell-O package), but I will definitelly make them again. Thanks for the great idea!

I made these for a valentines Day party and everyone loved them.  I made spiked jello and regular jello and set out sprite and champagne.  People could choose virgin (sprite & reg. jello) or any combination.  The favorite was sprite with the spiked jello.  The jello floated better in the sprite than in the champagne, making it possible to get a little jello with each sip.  Thanks for a fun drink idea!!!

very strong!  had some fizzy action, works best if you pour champagne over the jello shots.

also - make sure not to pour vodka in while water is still very hot or you run the risk of cooking out the alcohol.

I thought this would be a fun drink for New Years Eve.  They were difficult to drink and the Jell-O totally ruins the champagne.  Who wants chunky champagne?  Yuk.

These were a cute novelty.  You do have to swirl the glass for the true effect, but that was expected.  I made jello shots with vodka, but you could really do with or without alcohol in the jello with the same visual effect and taste.  I would make again and not bother with the vodka, wouldnt even notice it missing.

Very Festive!!!! I made these for Christmas Eve. I made 2 types of Jello shots....Cherry & Melon Fusion....so I had red & green. and i used an inexpensive Cava Brut. I figured with the sweetness of the Jello, a dryer sparkling wine would be better. I did notice larger goblet type glasses seemed to work better than regular flutes for the lava effect....However both looked very nice!!! Will definitely make these again!!!!

Made this for New Year's toast and everyone loved the lava lamp concept.    Even our son, the bartender was impressed.  Now a tip for novices (like me:0):  I used a Trader Joe recommend that was a Cava Brut and learned the hard way that I don't like Brut - which typically is very dry.  Maybe this is common knowledge but I had no clue. Some liked it but I did not and think that especially for this specific combo a sweet sparkling wine would be much better.   I contemplated dropping in a little cube of sugar to soften the blow but never got around to it.  I also screwed up (trying to do to much prep for dinner party) and did not include the vodka in the jello which turned out to be a good thing.  That way I was able to make the children Lava Lamps with 7-up (worked like a charm) and for the grown ups we just put a 1/2 pour of vodka on top of the jello before topping off with the bubbly.  I would definitely try again with a sweet bubbly.  Lots of fun.  Cheers!

These did not turn out well for me.  I made two batches, one with red-  black cherry jello and the other with blue- blue raspberry.  The blue ones's KIND OF looked like lava lamps, but the red one's did not.  All the jello just rose quickly and floated on the top.  Might be because the red ones were made with sugar-free jello?  However, despite the loss of the visual effect, they tasted good.

Made with Asti Spumante and strawberry lime jello. YUM! The jello came straight out of the freezer and sank- next time I'll try letting it warm up. With the champagne, it's not really a shot, but you have to slurp the jello up a the end unless you shoot it. A lot of guests didn't eat the jello and said it was squishy. But, this was at a bridal shower, and not a very wild crowd. Will definitely make again.

WoW! Blast from the past! I was a "shot girl" in my early days & we used to serve these w/ all sorts of different liquours...Midori,etc (as someone else mentioned). What great fun...I totally forgot about these! Thanks Pamela!
P.S. We used to serve these in test plastic tubes...very cool!

these were a huge hit at my mom's bday party! they only actually look like a lava lamp for the first couple minutes and then the fizz dies down too much to make the chunks of jello go up and down. that is just enough time to enjoy the effect before drinking it though!

This drink was a hit at my party.  I made a batch of Watermelon and a batch of Cherry.  Everyone loved the Watermelon (said it tasted like a jolly rancher).  the Cherry didn't go over so good.  They definately sneak up on you.  Will surely make this again in watermelon only, and get more than 1 bottle of champagne.

We made these for a party and they were a hit! We added a shot of 7-Up to sweeten them up a bit, then they were perfect. Also worked well with 7-up alone for those who don't care for champagne.

fun drink!!! I added some sprite with the champagne simply because I'm not a champagne lover so it was a little too strong without the sprite.

You must keep them warm. But i wasn't crazy about these. The jellow ruins the champaign. It will make it very flat. And the textures of the two dont mix well in my opinion. I should add i put my jello shot in cold; at room temperature it was better... but I still didn't care for these.

Didn't let the jello shots warm up so the jello sank.  But still tasty!

Made for a party we had. They looked great, but didn't taste the best. Maybe it was the champaign. We then tried lemon lime soda, but that was too sweet. Fun, but a waste of good jell-0 shots!

This was a really neat idea that everyone loved this new years.  I will make them every year from now on, as they were such a big hit.  I might not put as much vodka in next time....they did sneak up on me.  :-)

I made kid friendly versions of this and they were great! I replaced the vodka for more water or koolaid and the champagne for ginger ale or 7 up. The kids loved it.

I agree that the jello part pretty much sunk to the bottom, but was amazed at how much it did look like a lava lamp (when stirred) and they certainly do sneak up on you, as others said. Kept waiting for the effect to kick in, then - boom! - it hit! Not sure if I was having "taste bud issues," but I really couldn't taste anything in this. Granted, it could be that we used cheap champagne, but regardless - love the ease and "cool factor" - will definitely use this again!

It worked for the first few seconds and then it all sat at the bottom.  Too much alcohol for the drink - this would be great for a college party with the goal of getting trashed.

Both me and my boyfriend loved this drink... especially the closer we got to the Jello shots that settled at the bottom of our glasses.

I made these for a bachlorette party. They were a huge hit and a great way to kick off the party. Great idea
