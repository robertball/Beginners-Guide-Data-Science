This is my favorite meatloaf recipe.  My mother would always make it when I was home on a college break.  This was my first attempt at making it.  I'm not a big clove fan, so I excluded the ground cloves.  And I used extra-lean ground beef, Egg Beaters and light bread to make the recipe a little healthier.  Delicious!

This was a great recipe-- somewhere between four and five stars, so I rounded up.  Instead of four pieces of bread, I used two pieces of bread and one cup of panko crust mixed in with the meat.  And when I make this recipe next time, I will cut down the amount of lemon juice by 1/4 or so.

This recipe was a big success.  the only thing I did differently was to add 1/4 cup of commercial barbeque sauce, I added half of a chopped green pepper and I put bacon over the top of the loaf.  I didn't have any leftovers.

I decided to try this because the glaze sounded good.  I made meat balls and placed them in a muffin pan so it would be more appealing to my son (whose is picky beyond belief) and them spread the glaze on top of each one and baked accordingly.  They turned out really good and he actually ate about 1/2 of one.  I served these over rice and skipped the lemon slices.  Thanks Tiffany.

I have used this recipe for over 30 years - just renamed it to Individual BBQ Beef Loaves. Someone who did not like meatloaf actually asked me (begged me) to make this. It is my daughter's favorite.

I put it all in a loaf pan instead. But it was very tender and tasty meatloaf.

The meatloaf was good. It could have used some more spice, such as basil or oregano. Didn't like the sauce. The clove and allspice flavor was too strong for me. Bottled BBQ sauce ended up being what I used. Otherwise, the lemon gave the meatloaf a lighter flavorl.

I make it with ground turkey instead of beef since I am not a red meat eater anymore. It still has the exact same taste and texture with turkey. Even the die hard carnivore husband and son don't mind at all. My mother has made this for as long as I can remember and it was always one of my favorites. I am glad I get to share it with my family too.

This recipe sounds terrific!!  I have a type of muffin pan that makes small loaves instead of round muffins.  I'm going to use this.  I print the recipe and then look at the reviews and make notes on the side of the copy of the recipe.  I would like to suggest to the person responsible for this web site that they put high altitude adjustments on it.  We don't all live at sea level.

Thought I would like this more.  Love lemon, but could not taste lemon and texture was mushy. Very bland.  Was ok to eat, but definitely would not make again.

WOW. I made this tonight and I NEVER expected it to be this good! The combination of lemon juice and bbq sauce is so delicious and fresh. I personally used ground turkey to make it healthier and made one big loaf as I was cooking it in my crockpot. mmm mmm good!

I can't believe how good this was!  I'm not a huge meatloaf fan but I have a freezer full of venison that I need to use.  I used 3 pieces of bread instead of 4.  As others suggested, I made balls and cooked them in a greased muffin pan (about 30 minutes total).  I kind of flattened the top and made a bit of a well to keep the sauce from sliding off.  Sprinkled them with a little lemon pepper before putting them in the oven.  I drained some excess liquid from the pan at the 15 minute mark.  I didn't add cloves to the sauce b/c I didn't have any- won't use it next time anyway.  They were so moist and flavorful.  Perfect.  Will definitely make again!!

This was actually very good, but a little different.  I loved the lemon accent, and my husband did too.  I didn't change anything about the recipe, it was quick and easy. I did use fresh lemon juice.  The spices made for a slightly different sort of sauce.  I agree the presentation was very nice, and suitable for guests.

I would give this 3.5 stars. The meatloaf itself is not bad but we did not care for the bbq sauce at all. The cloves and allspice were overpowering and just did not make a good match with the rest of the recipe.

This was actually quite good.  I've never been much of a fan of meatloaf but this sounded interesting so decided to give it a try. It got two thumbs up from everyone - even my 2 year old grandson.  The sauce, especially, is very tasty. I'll be making meatloaf more often now, but I'll be using this recipe.

Finally, I made a good meatball/meatloaf!  I used 1/2 cup lemonade (had used up all of my lemons to make it, hey it worked!) and didn't have allspice or cloves (don't like cloves anyway) so I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the sauce.  It was great!  Didn't bother with lemon on top, had none left from earlier in the day....These were great though!

So good!  The sauce just carmelizes on top and it is delightful.  My husband and I seperate the meat loaf mixture into muffin tins instead of a bread pans or casserole dishes.  It makes the perfect serving size and it is easy to serve.  Just spray your tin with Pam or a nonstick spary.  We can usually fill about a dozen servings to the brim and then add the sauce to the top.  Bake it for the same time and garnish each one with a lemon on top.  Perfect!

It was good but better the next day as a sandwich on pumpernickel bread.  Next time, I would cut way back on the cloves.  The cloves were overpowering.  I made them into "balls" in a muffin pan which made for a nice size for my young daughters.  The lemon slices on top were really worthless..they didn't add any flavor.

Mine didn't come out as good and I'm not sure why.  It was edible and tasty but not great.  It didn't quite pass the child test either.  The oldest ate it but I had to threaten the other two to eat them.  I won't give up though and will try again!

The lemon just does not work in this recipe. Maybe if one used ground turkey, it would be better. Also I think the water is not a good idea. Use catsup or American chili sauce (not Thai or Asian). Even a little tomato sauce would be better than the water. The cloves and the allspice don't work for me either. Those spices are so strong they overtake the sauce. I would use a little mustard (dry or wet) instead. This is an idea that just doesn't come together into a harmonious whole.

I really enjoyed this meatloaf. My hubby said it was too lemony so I might reduce lemon juice in the future.

Very good!!! I did make a few changes/additions though. Here they are in case you would like the option! I am more of a lime person so I opted for lime instead of lemon. I used dry breadcrumbs from the grocery store instead of the slices of bread. Also, 1 lb of lean grd. beef & 1 lb of extra lean grd turkey instead of the 1.5 lbs of grd beef. I added green pepper, 4 slices of browned & crumbled bacon, 3 cloves of garlic, s&p, 2 tsp of mont. steak spice, & 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce. Lastly, I doubled the sauce (it was soooo good I wanted double!!).

Very impressive meatloaf. I am very funny when it comes to meatloaf and I was a bit skeptical about this, but it was exceptionally delicious and something I would serve to company. Following another reviewers advice, adding lemon pepper seasoning to the meat mixture was a great idea. And also, instead of the water, try adding milk, it just does something great to the texture. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Delicious - and that's coming straight from one who rates meatloaf pretty low on the food chain!  I did add 2T minced garlic, Worcestershire sauce, used Montreal Seasoning in place of salt and also subbed salsa for the ketchup.  After taste-testing the topping, I did add some chipotle pepper sauce as well.  Cooked in muffin tins and they were done in 30 minutes flat.  Delish - thanks!

What a GREAT dish!  My husband just loved it and leftovers made a tastie sandwich next day.  The only thing I did different is use fresh bread crumbs instead of day-old broken bread.  Added 1 cup of crumbs - this was perfect!

My normal meatloaf recipe is the Amish meatloaf from this site but I wanted to try something different.  My kids (3,6,&9) ate every last bite of the lemon meatloaf which is uncommon for them.  I guess I'm making the switch to this as my favorite as well.  I did omit the cloves but otherwise made it according to the recipe. I may consider making a little more sauce next time, it was very good!

Used 2% milk instead of water and went very easy when adding the cloves (just a dash).  No other changes and it was very moist and tasty.  The topping sauce is excellent. Definitely high on my list of favorite meatloaf recipes...

This was awesome!  I did as another reviewer suggested and made mini-meatloaves in a muffin tin.  It worked out great because I was short on time and they cooked a lot faster that way (about 30 minutes)!  I did not serve with the lemons on top, but the bbq sauce was really good!

This recipe is sure to please.  It is a dressier way to prepare meatloaf and is our family's favorite.  The topping is very special and spicy.  I first saw this recipe over 30 years ago using 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef and formed into 6 individual loaves.  These brown very nicely and with the sauce on top and lemon garnish the presentation is very nice. If in a hurry the meat mixture can be formed into a single ring and cooked in the microwave for about 10 minutes for 1 1/2 lb. beef, topping with the sauce after about 5 minutes. Garnish with lemon after cooking.

Love this recipe, my grown kids beg me to make this when they come to visit. Didn't change a thing on it. I make a little extra sauce so the grandkids can have some of the "ketchup" as they call it on their plate. Fantastic! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

We liked this recipe a lot! It is easy, and the combination of this particular sauce and meatloaf rocks! (And to think that my fiance is actually a clove hater...) We didn't change anything. Thanks for sharing! We had it with Honey roasted potatoes from this site also.

Quite nice!  We really liked this one.  I took the advise of a few others and cut down on the clove.  I'm going to keep this one and maybe next time mix in some sausage.  Thanks!

So so good! I'd probably use a low-fat meat next time b/c the meat fat collected around the  loaves while cooking.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I can't imagine using it for ground beef, though; we used ground turkey.  I changed the recipe further by adding garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, smoked sea salt (instead of seasoned) and lemon pepper to meat mixture.  I omitted the water.  Used chili sauce instead of ketchup, and cut back on sugar to 1/4 cup.  Then I placed the sauce right on top of the meat (put a well in the top of the loaves) and baked 400 for 30 minutes - perfect!  I would switch the amounts for the spices to 1/4 dash of cloves and 1/4 teaspoon of allspice.  Will double sauce next time.  Aside from the personal tweaks, really, really tasty.

The sauce is excellent!! I cut the brown sugar down to 1/4c, but otherwise made no other changes. I ommitted the water and used 1/3c lemon juice instead. And used a 6 oz box of seasoned stuffing mix instead of the bread to give it a little more flavor. Really great meatloaf!!  The kids ate it up! Thank you!!!

Tasty meatloaf.  I was somewhat hesitant about the allspice and cloves in the glaze, but it is very good.  We preferred the glaze from the recipe to a KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce that we put on two loaves for comparison.

Very good - I really enjoyed this.  I added about 1/4 cup of barbeque sauce (mix of a couple kinds I had) to the sauce and used hot ketchup rather than regular.  I also used about 1/4 tsp allspice rather than a dash.  Husband loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

OH BABY! these were my first words coming out of my mouth when I first tried this meatloaf. I made some mash potato to go along with it and mixed it all together with plain yogurt and the green pepper tabasco sauce. This will seriously open your eyes to quite the experience. AMAZING recipe. love it, love it, love it!!!

My boyfriend loves lemon and when we made this he adored it...we've made it every other week since them. The lemon flavor comes through nicely and is not overpowering. Thanks for sharing this one with us.

My husband said this is the best meatloaf he's ever had.  Even my picky 9 yr old son loved it!  I usually change recipes quite a bit, but not too much on this one.  I did add some granulated garlic and lemon pepper to the meat mix.  I also added some molasses to the sauce to cut the vinegar taste of the ketchup.  I didn't have fresh lemon slices, so I just added some lemon juice to the sauce.  I made individual large balls, flattened them, then put a dent in the top of each one to hold the sauce.  That way I could scoop out the meat from the pan without getting the fat, but yet save all the sauce.  Many people have said they left out the cloves and/or the all spice. DON'T!  As weird as it sounds, it adds a special touch and I promise you won't taste it.  I used freshly ground all spice.

This is the tastiest, and juiciest meatloaf I've ever made!  I love it, hands down. Wouldn't change a thing. I made it for the first time a few weeks ago and it was a big hit!  Very pretty, with the lemon on top and in the individual loaves.  The sauce is to die for, quite different....the only thing I'll do differently next time is to double that sauce, so you can "dip" into it.  AWESOME :)

A little disappointed... Meat lacked any real flavour. If it wasn't for the 'topping', it would be pretty tasteless. Don't know that I'll do this one again.

I thought adding water to meatloaf might be unneccessary, but I found it made the meat very tender.  My family loves barbequed sandwiches so we put the large balls on deli rolls and it was wonderful.
Thanks Tiffany we will add this to our favorites and use it often.

I really liked the idea, but water in a meatloaf?
But i tried it, like i usually try new recipes.
Aadding salt while trying to eat it, did not help it.
Water in meat loaf??!!
I suggest leaving the water out all together and trying tomato sauce instead of ketchup for a richer taste.

This is a delightful and elegant looking dish.  My husband and I thought the meatloaves were delicious, but the kids thought otherwise.  They thought the cloves were a little overpowering.

Delicious, great warmed for leftovers. Individual servings stay moist since covered in your homemade barbecue sauce. I use the sauce recipe for grilling other cuts of meat.

It was good but if you are in a hurry, any barbecue sauce preferably your favorite will do.  Also, if you make the sauce, I would mix the ingredients and bring it to a boil, then put on the meatballs.
I did not have day old bread so I used about a 1/2 cup of bread crumbs

Everyone loved this.  I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup,  used 1/2 BBQ sauce and 1/2 catsup (instead of all catsup) , used sourdough ( a little fewer calories).   made 5 loaves instead of 6 and it was plenty for my three men in the family.

For years I have tried meatloaf recipes looking for the "keeper" recipe.  Found it!  My son called this "gourmet" and he has very discriminating taste.
Added extra lemon and onion but otherwise followed the directions.  Amazing!

This is a new favorite!  I made mine as a traditional loaf in a self-draining loaf pan.  Sauce was a little on the sweet side for our taste, but there were no leftovers!  Next time I would reduce the amount of Brown Sugar from 1/3 Cup to 1/4 Cup

Delicious! Made exactly as listed except I used gluten free sourdough bread. And actually I think I forgot to add the water too. Will definitely make these again. My husband and I loved them, unfortunately the kids didn't, but they're pretty unpredictable in that regard.

I tried this recipe because the idea of adding fresh lemon juice to the meat before roasting sounded intriguing. I made this with turkey and it came out ok,  The onions would have been better in the meat if they were pan fried first to add a carmelized taste and softer texture to the loaf. Per others' comments I reduced the ground cloves (by half) which flavored the sauce nicely without overwhelming it. I'll make this again with a few tweaks.

I made the meatloaf and my husband and I loved it.  I'll definitely make it again.   I didn't make any changes in the ingredients  but  did not place lemon slices on top of meatloaf. 
I'm sharing  the recipe with our son as he is a meatloaf lover.

Followed recipe precisely: lovely. Seasoning not too strong. Remained moist and flavourful when heated up in oven, under aluminum foil, the next day. Incorporated leftovers, minus fat,
into homemade spaghetti sauce for third (!) round. Will definitely make it again and again -- even for company, especially with children.

The 1/4 cup of lemon juice is a surprising ingredient, but everything worked great.  I substituted some barbecue sauce for some of the ketchup.  Overall one of the best meat loaf recipes.

This was pretty good and was made as per the recipe (no changes).  The lean ground beef tasted a little bland so I would use more onion as some suggested or even 1/2 pkg. of onion soup mix to kick it up a notch.  I also think 3/4'cup of bread crumbs would work better than the chunks of day old bread here and I would eliminate the water.  The ground cloves in the allspice would have sufficed.  Maybe I'll try 1/4 tsp. of liquid Hickory  smoke instead of the ground cloves.  The sauce is a little on the sweet side and if you're not a fan of dry mustard to add a little heat I would suggest using Tobasco or maybe a little cayenne pepper instead.  Guessing the lemon juice softens the texture of the meat but didn't add any detectable lemon flavour.  The lemon slice on top makes for a better presentation but I'm not sure I would bother with either next time.

Nice to see the classics stand the test of time. I've been making this dish since I discovered it over 20 yrs ago in my Good Housekeeping Illustrated cookbook. Only difference is cookbook calls for bread crumbs instead of stale bread

No one in my family loves meatloaf, but me, so I wanted to give this recipe a try.  I knew they would not be into the allspice or cloves in the sauce, so I omitted those and, instead, put 1/4 tsp. garlic powder into the sauce topping.  I did not make the individual loaves, but instead, used a traditional  loaf pan, and after the initial 15 minutes and sauce application, I allowed it to cook for a whole hour, like other meatloaf recipes suggest.  They all loved it!

Great tasting meatloaf recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly except for added more seasonings to the meat (there's more out there than salt and pepper, people!). Added garlic powder, onion powder, and seasoned pepper. The lemon juice gave it a nice flavor and the glaze was delicious.  Will definitely be making this one again!

I thought this had a "gourmet" taste to it unlike the basic meatloaf recipe I usually make. It's definitely a keeper. Changes I made- omitted cloves because I didn't have them, subbed one cup of rolled oats for the day old bread. I adjusted seasonings as follows- cut the lemon juice from a quarter cup to a third a cup, because I didn't want to use all my lemons (used 2 1/4 between juice and slices), cut the seasoning salt to one generous teaspoon instead of two, and added about a teaspoon of dried thyme (because I think lemon and meat go well with thyme). Husband loved it! The lemon was prevalent without being overpowering, the sauce tangy & sweet, but a yummy contrast, and was only heavy on the end pieces. The salt was fine for our tastes and I thought two teaspoons would take away from all the other flavors going on, unless you really like salt! Try it!  *By the way, I made this as one loaf in a loaf pan, total cook time  1 hour 10 minutes in my oven.

Made this with turkey. Added A1 to mix and topping because I thought it would add more flavor, I will try it without next time but I still think the meat would need more flavor. I also wouldn't add the water, it made it way too mushy and the little meatloafs were swimming in it so I had to drain several times.

This was good, but I wouldn't recommend it for company or picky eaters. The lemon doesn't come through, but the cloves in the glaze are really strong - I would use much less than the recipe calls for. I used 3 eggs instead of 1, otherwise I didn't change anything.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever made.  I used ground venison instead of beef.  I didn't use the cloves and allspice because I was out of them and don't particularly like them.  I made 6 little meatloafs for me and my husband and froze the other 4.  I saved some of the topping and added it when I got them out of the oven.  This is a keeper.

FIRST OFF let me say this recipe caused quite a stir, My better half almost had a heart attack while I was making this one, when she saw me using a measure cup and refering to recipe while makine it. The only thing I did different was to double onion and add 1/2 cup chopped celery.will do again

This recipe is great,I just do a couple things different, I use Italian bread crumbs instead of bread, and for the sweet topping I use equal amounts of ketchup and Karo syrup

An easy to prepare and tasty meatloaf. I used three pieces of bread, instead of four, but other than that followed the recipe - and it had a good texture. It was a great meatloaf with baked potato and a salad.

Very good recipe.  Next time I'll leave out the cloves because my son wasn't too crazy about them, but I thought it added that extra something you look for in a recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

What a great supper. I  didn't put on the lemon slice because I thought my kids wouldn't like it, but next time, I'll add more lemon juice to enhance the lemon flavor. I'll also cut the sugar to 1/4 cup.

DELICIOUS!! My husband can not stop raving about this dish. He keeps asking for it again. I used ground chicken instead of beef and crushed saltine crackers instead of bread. I am surprised he still loved it with the changes made. I think the "sauce" was the winner...next time I might make more although the amount for recipe was perfect. I didn't have lemon slices for top but I may try next time to see if it makes a difference. All in all...this is a real KEEPER!!

This was pretty good.  I think the barbeque sauce could have had a little more kick to it.

Loved this one.  It was easy and quick to make.  The only thing I would change is the sauce.  The cloves and allspice was just a bit too overpowering for me.  I think next time will just use a pinch of all spice and skip the cloves entirely.

We really liked this meatloaf.  It was very easy to prepare and makes a nice p resentation with the lemon slices on top. I incorporated some of the other reviewer suggestions:  I used 6 oz. of seasoned stuffing instead of the day old bread.  I used tomato sauce instead of ketchup and upped the onion to 1/2 c.  I also doubled the sauce and even then it wasn't overly generous. 
 Next time I will cut down the brown sugar to 1/4 c.  It was a bit sweet for my taste.  Also, whoever questioned putting the water in... I used the full amount (1/2 c.) and I had NO liquid in the bottom of the dish.  So the meatloaf would have been really dry had I omitted it.  Enjoy!

This was fantastic!  I did skip the individual loaves and made on big one.  Be careful not to over do it with the cloves, though!

Very good, moist meatloaf.  I made 1 loaf rather than individual loaves.  I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 stars because there were alot of extra juices when the meatloaf was cooked that took away from the presentation.

Unlike everyone else whose reviews I've read, I only sort of liked the meat loaf - didn't love it.  The sauce was pretty tasty, but I left out the cloves because I don't like the taste.  I have another meatloaf recipe that I like much better. I'll stick to that one.
