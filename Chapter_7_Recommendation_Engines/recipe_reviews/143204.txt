This is SO good! I made it for my bestfriend's 40ieth birthday party & the ladies could not get enough! I did make 2 changes: I addeed a clove of minced garlic & used whipped cream cheese instead of mayo simply bcz I am not a mayo fan. This is best make a day or 2 even in advance. Thanks for this delicious and different recipe!

Oh yeah I love it, using it with crackers. Made just like called for. I'll make it again. UPDATE: it is now Thanksgiving time 2017 (original review was in 2011) and purposely have returned to my favorites to get this recipe, once again. It gets gone folks.  Love it.

Delicious! For some more flavor & color I added a clove of minced garlic and a bundle of sliced green onions. Served with Sea Salt Bagel Chips it was a hit! Thanks!

Wow! Great tastes like pimento spread! I bought my favorite store brand and something is wrong with it - spoiled?I spent $6.99!! I didn't have pimentos but I did have peppers! I thought what the heck? Its great!! I don't think I'm spending $6.99 again I'll make it myself! I used light mayo! And I ate it right away! So good! Much cheaper! Thanks Kathie!

Excellent!!!  This spread is delicious.  Whether you like store bought pimento cheese spread or not (which I really don't) you will love this.  I almost didn't make it because of that.  Reading the reviews & ease of recipe, I decided to try it.  So glad I did.  Of course brand's are different every where, but here are the ones I found & used from my local grocery store.  OK. I made it exactly as written but like others, added 1 tsp. minced refrigerated garlic from the jar.  Also, just to make incorporation easier & even, I put the 3/4 cup (reg. Hellmans) in a meas. cup, added the 1/2 cup diced roasted red peppers (Mezzetta) on top, & stirred in the worcestershire & minced garlic.    I used Sargentino's fancy shredded sharp cheddar since my food processer isn't working, and just used a hand beater to meld the mixture into dip texture. So quick & good.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Very good.  People I served it to told me it tasted just like Pimiento Cheese (which I've never had), so I think this recipe accomplishes its goal.

Great used in mac and cheese bites or as a spread on some good crackers. If you're the creative type, you could even spread this on a burger or another sammich' for added flavor and creamy texture.

Delicious! I made this exactly as written the first time, and used it as a flavorful spread on chicken ciabatta sandwiches. It was a hit!  I think I'll try some garlic next time, just to see.  As a spread, just check the flavor with the crackers. It was great on bread and Triscuts, but tasted weird with Wheat Thins.

Love this recipe, but I did change just slightly. I added 6 oz of cream cheese, 1 tablespoon of minced garlic and 2 tablespoons of minced green onions and processed in my food processor until smooth. Delicious on everything!

OK, I have no idea what I did wrong here, but this was terrible-- weird mixed texture, and an oily, bland mayonnaise-y flavor instead of the creamy cheesy goodness I'd been expecting. Will not make again.

This was very good.  I didn't have any fresh garlic so I added some garlic powder.  Other than that, I stayed true to the recipe. I would make this again.

I grew up on pimento cheese sandwitches and they are still one of my all time favorites, but after making this, I will NEVER buy pimento cheese again.  The substitution of roasted red peppers is ingenious.  Like another reviewer, I added minced garlic, but I kept everything else the same.  This is great not only on sandwitches, but as a dip as well (especially with pretzels).
