WOW!!!  That is a lot of sodium per serving.  I used low sodium chicken broth.

This was excellent! I usually alter a recipe but I would not do anything to this one. The taste of the creole sauce is deceiving until the shrimp is cooked in. I served it over Uncle Ben's long grain wild rice which was a nice addition (my husband doesn't like white rice). Next time I think I am going to try a dirty rice.

This recipe was absolutely amazing! I was skeptical because the spice measurement was minimal;but the flavor was outstanding. The only thing I did different was to add a little chili paste for spice and imitation crab meat.  Also, some starch to thicken sauce a bit.  Don't judge the flavor of the sauce until you add your shrimp.  That's when all the flavors come together.  Can't wait to make it again.

This was wonderful!  My husband is allergic to shrimp so I had to substitute chicken, and it still turned out great.

This is one of THE BEST recipes on this site!  It is so quick and simple.  My kids and I loved it!  So much in fact I prepared it 2 days in a row.  The first day exactly as written.  The second day with both chicken and shrimp.  Thank you for sharing!
