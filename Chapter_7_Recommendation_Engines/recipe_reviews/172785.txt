I can't really give this recipe a fair rating, because I was unable to complete it as written.  After I reduced the balsamic vinegar, I left it to cool as directed.  When I came back 20 minutes later, I was left with a thick, sticky ooze in the bottom of the pan that could barely be scooped out, let alone poured.  I had used all of my balsamic vinegar to make this, and had to serve it in 30 minutes, so I placed the "ooze" in my food processor with 1/4 cup of white wine vinegar.  I blended that while drizzling in 1/4 cup of olive oil, and then strained the whole thing.  The final product was delicious, but not at all what I anticipated.  So watch your vinegar very closely, and don't let it reduce too far.  But if you do, you can try my method to save it.

I only made the balsalmic reduction as a dipping sauce for gorgonzola stuffed, bacon wrapped dates but the reduction was so delicious that I had to rate it. It would be amzing over mushrooms or steak.

I was a little scared by the ingredient list but gave it a whirl anyhow.  I was very pleased!  It would have been nice to include about how long the reduction of the balsamic would take.  I did it for about 15 minutes and that only reduced it to about a 1/2 cup.

My balsamic reduction also turned into goop. I was in a hurry and so please do not make this in a hurry. I mixed some olive oil and 2 Tbsp water and heated at very low heat again, whisking constantly. Got saved somehow but this should not be made in a hurry but with a lot of patience.

I typically do not like tomatoes, but this salad was excellent. I added the olive oil, basil, salt and pepper to the balsamic reduction once it was cooled.

Great and simple.  Use a good vinegar, it compresses the complex flavors and you'll appreciate the difference.  I used calamatta olives instead of black to give it an occasional kick as well.

This was great - we eat salad several nights a week and my husband likes the "really big salad" this was a great change of pace for us. Will make it again for sure!  We used blackberries - very good!

Balsamic reduction is one of my favorites, and this one is good.  Stoves vary, so it is worth watching carefully, but it will probably be about 15 minutes or less.  
I used rolled mozzarella, lined with dried oregano, fresh basil leaved and thin tomato slices, salt and peper.  Refrigerate overnight so flavors marry.  Slice the rolls when ready to serve and drizzle a tiny bit of balsamic reduction over it and served.  You could also add prosciutto if you like.  YUM!

Nice summer dinner when you're looking for something on the light side.  I halved the recipe, put it on spinach instead of red leaf lettuce, and swapped out the black olives for kalamata olives.

My husband gave it an 8 out of 10 stars.

Rating is primarily for the reduction, which is amazing.!  I use a good quality balsamic vinegar which is key.  Usually the grocery store has one good bottle that is on sale.  I simmer for about an hour to get the vinegar to reduce slowly - avoids clumpy gooeyness.  I also throw in a handful of raspberries and simmer those also to give an added sweetness.  


A little goes a long way with this reduction - so use it sparingly.  I double the recipe and store in a glass dressing -bottle in the fridge for 7-10 days or so.

As for serving - I use a spring mix salad with red onion, fresh basil, sliced tomato, mozzarella, and raspberries.  I omit the olives but will add prosciutto if making it into an entre salad.
