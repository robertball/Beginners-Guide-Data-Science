This is one of the cookies my Scandinavian grandfather used to make every Christmas that made memories in my family. Grandpa passed away 4 years ago, and was too frail to make them for at least a few years before that. So, it's been a long time since I have eaten one. I knew the ingredients, but didn't know the ratios. Thank you so much for posting this. I did double the cardamom and cinnamon, and added a dash of ginger and cloves. I am giving this recipe a 4 because it's missing two vital ingredients to traditional Danish Pebber Nodder, which I just played with until I felt the taste was just right. It was roughly 1/2 tsp of mace, and 1/4 tsp of white pepper. I made these for my annual cookie exchange. They were so good to snack on and they made perfect neighbor gifts put into small mason jars with pretty ribbon and a homemade tag. Thank you for giving me back an old family tradition, and giving me a fond way of remembering my grandfather.

I had never heard of cardamom so went to the store to get it.  After bringing it home and smelling it I almost didn't use it.  But......these cookies are fabulous!!!  I rolled mine in about 1/2 inch balls, rolled them in granulated sugar and baked for 10 mins.  These are wonderful with coffee or hot tea.  I also added 1 tsp. vanilla simply because I add vanilla to all cookie and cake recipes I think will benefit from it.  These were awesome!!!!!  My husband smelled the cardamom also and wrinkled his nose up.  He's a real cookie fan and eats cookies and milk every night before bed.  After they finished, he couldn't keep his hands off.  A great benefit from baking these cookies??????  The house smells wonderful!!!!!!!

This makes 100???? They disappeared too fast for me to count!  I tried rolling and cutting as directed, but found that just rolling into little balls made them look more presentable.  Although, judging from their disappearance, presentation had little effect on the family.  For Christmas, I think I'd roll them in raw sugar to make them a bit "prettier" - and maybe try rolling and twisting a few into a "pretzel" shape, then dip into sugar.  Maybe even add a tsp. (or less) of black pepper, for a spicier cookie and roll into powdered sugar after baking. The dough seems like it'd be versatile enough to do that.  The best part of the cookies, *I* think, is the crispy little bottoms that make them so chewy.  I think we'll have to use this recipe more often than for Christmas.  (Since we're at high altitude, I also added a bit extra flour...)

As a true dane I must say that this recipe is incomplete. As the name Peber Nodder indicates the recipe calls for Pepper! To get the real flavor of this traditional cookie you must add white pepper and ginger. As a child I made these every year with my mom and we never went through the trouble of rolling, we simply plugged little pieces of the dough and rolled them into balls in our hands. Much more fun and the whole family can participate.

Delicious and easy!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The narrower I rolled the dough the crunchier the nuggets baked up.  This was my first time using the spice cardamom-what a lovely aroma and taste!  My kids loved these and they were an easy quiet snack for church.

I doubled the cinnamon and cardamom, added a dash of salt and a half-teaspoon of vanilla.  I also rolled them into small balls and coated with granulated sugar before baking.  Not too sweet, aromatic, and scrumptous--definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

quite good.  like the other reviewer, I just made them as drop cookies.  After 10 min they weren't quite done but the bottoms looked like they were getting brown so I dropped the temp to 300 and baked them another 3 minutes.

Oh, wow!  A very simple little cookie, but in the best possible way.  Smelled heavenly baking, too.  I ended up rolling balls in sugar and flattening to about 1/8 inch, and they came out very pretty indeed.

Very edible little bites that are a great filler cookie for holiday plates.  The unique bite of the cardamom makes them almost refreshing and very easy to pop into your mouth one after the other.  I think they are versatile enough to merit the addition of a wide variety of tasty decorations.  The one change I suggest after making the recipe several times is baking them an additional two minutes to make the outside of the cookie just a touch more crispy without betraying the soft shortbread insides.

But being as I live in Denmark I have to say that this recipe is missing white pepper as part of the ingredients. That is one of the essential ingredients to Pebber (Pepper) Nodder. They taste so great with 1/2 tsp. white pepper. Try adding that to the recipe its even better.

These cookies are so yummy!  I was looking for something new for my cardamom, and these are perfect.  I halved the recipe and nearly doubled the cardamom (nearly 1 tsp for half recipe).  They turned out wonderfully.  I ended up cooking them about 12 minutes.
Even my 12 year old son loved them, and he's a hard sell.

These are awesome, but I tweaked the recipe a little to get them that way. I add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and cardamom (not just the one), plus 1/4 tea white pepper and a dash of black pepper (1/8 tea. or less, I just give a couple shakes across the top). 

Then I just roll the dough into 1 inch balls, roll them in a little sugar and cinnamon mixture (amount of cinnamon depends on your tastes, I like a bit), then put them in to bake. So much easier the rolling into the ropes!! 

Rolling in the sugar/cinnamon mix helps battle the lack of sweetness others have mentioned. The spicy sweetness makes this a unique cookie that my whole family can't stop eating!! I'm getting ready to make this for the fourth time right now. I've had rave reviews from all of my extended family members as well! I sent a dozen to all of my extended family members in Christmas goodie baskets. I'm so glad I found this recipe!!!

My son and I made these together after selecting Denmark for his Holidays Around the World school project.  We combined many of the review changes, and will be baking these cookies every Christmas season.  We added a tsp of white pepper, and additional 1/2 tsp of both Cardamom and Cinnamon, 1/4 tsp salt. and 1 tsp vanilla.  We rolled 1/6th of the dough slightly bigger than a finger, squared it, rubbed sugar on the top and Christmas sprinkles, and then cut with a floured paring knife. After 75 cookies, we had perfection!!!

With the addition of a dash of ginger and cloves, double the cinnamon and cardamom, and 1/4tsp white pepper, this is a phenemonal recipe.  Light, spicy and delicious.  Make lots; you can eat these by the handful!  :)

As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the cardamom and cinnamon.  I also added 1/4 tsp of both cloves and ginger and 1/4 cup extra sugar for just a tad more sweetness.  Absolutely wonderful!  It's almost like a chai tea latte in a cookie.

Amazing!  Not a super sweet cookie, which made it so much easier to too many!  The cardamom is a really great flavor, I had never cooked with it before, but will make an effort to in the future.

Delicious & addictive little spiced shortbread cookies! I followed other's advice & doubled the cardamom & cinnamon. I also added about 1/2 tsp vanilla, & 1/4 tsp each of ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves & white pepper (I've made them w/o the white pepper & I enjoy them both ways). It may sound strange, but the flavor reminded me of pumpkin pie. After the dough is made, just grab a small handful of it, roll it out on a floured surface then use a pizza cutter to cut into the size you like. Just know that depending on the thickness & size, they'll cook differently (bigger the size = longer the baking time). My husband loves these w/ his coffee so it's nice making them a little longer, like biscotti, for dunking. Rings would work well too, or even a figure '8' shape, like Kringla. The cookies are done when the very bottom edge of the cookie starts to turn a light brown.**A few notes about the cardamom: One way to tell if you'll enjoy it's flavor is if you enjoy Chai tea. Chai spice almost always has cardamom seeds in it (along with cinnamon, ginger, cloves, pepper & nutmeg). I usually had trouble finding ground cardamom in stores where I lived in the US. But we live in India now & cardamom is used in many local dishes, so if you have trouble finding ground cardamom, try your local Indian grocer & look for "Elaichi Powder".** Lastly, make sure to double the recipe if you've got a full house - these cookies won't last a full 24 hours once people get their hands on them.

I love these cookies!  My husband was talking fondly of this cardamom bread his uncle makes, so when I saw this recipe, I thought it was worth a try.  I had never had cardamom before, and thought it smelled really strong out of the bottle, but these cookies are so delicious.  I like making them small like the recipe says and popping them in my mouth one after another.  These will definitely stay one of my favorite cookies.

I LOVE these cookies, however, the first time i made them i did not have any cardamon and the store was out, I did add 1/2 tsp of Mace, and a 1/2 tsp of white pepper, needlessly to say they were absolutely wonderful. The next time i made them i put the cardamon in them... and for me, i prefer them without it. though my oldest daughter adores them with the cardamon.  Wonderful recipe, thank you for sharing.

These cookies remind me of the holiday treats my grandma always made for my sister and I when we were little. These cookies are simple and very good, but I did put a little orange zest in them. The citrus and cardamom go quite nicely together.

This is my fist review on allrecipes, so forgive the rambling... but I have to say I made these for Christmas, and all the Danish people online who warn you to double/triple the recipe are right!  They disappear fast.  After years of reading recipes/reviews here and screaming about all the people who CHANGE the recipe and then review it, I have hereby joined their ranks:  I used 1/2 c. lard + 1/2 c. butter, 1/2 c. brown sugar + 1/2 c. white sugar, cut down on the cinnamon and added a heavy dose of white pepper ("peber").  Fantastic.  And SO easy, compared to all of the rolling and pressing I did this Christmas.  I will definitely be making these every year from now on.

Very easy to make. I followed recipe as it is but added nutmeg and a little pepper. Lightly rolled some in red sugar and some in green for holiday looks. My kids (very picky eaters) loved them and really loved making them. They are on my Christmas must make list. By the way, the title traslates to 'Pepper Nuts'.

These cookies are great! I could eat them all year round. I rolled the dough out and cut them with tiny cookie cutters and they looked so great. If you choose to roll them out I'd suggest using icing sugar cover the surface, not flour (mine ended up tasting a bit too floury). Also these cookies didn't expand on the pan at all so I was able to put a lot more on the pan to save time.

Easy little cookies.  I did add 1/4 tsp. more cardamom and 1/4 tsp. white pepper and rolled the ropes in cinnamon sugar before cutting and baking them.  Creates a nice flavorful shortbread cookie. One suggestion I would make is to also add more cinnamon in the mix.

I just made this recipe and its wonderful. The dough is easy to work with and it make lots of delightful little nuggets. They smell wonderful when baking. I decorated them for Christmas and they look so cute. The only thing I did differently was to add extra cinnamon. Personal taste. Thank you for an easy, tasty recipe. I will keep this as a regular.

A quick tip for baking these: if they START browning around the edges, they're done. They won't turn golden all over like, say, chocolate chip cookies, and if you try and bake them longer, they'll taste fine fresh but harden up quickly.
I couldn't get my hands on cardamom, but I'm sure it tastes great with it, judging from the other reviews here. I compensated by doubling cinnamon and adding 1 tsp. each of cloves and pepper. If you cream the butter properly, the dough is soooo easy to work with! Just sticky enough, and soft. These cookies come out great if you cut it like the directions say or even if you roll it by hand into one-inch balls.
Thank you for a really simple recipe that has a yummy, subtle taste!

I just made these yesterday. I didn't get 100 cookies out of the recipe, but perhaps I made them bigger than they're supposed to be. (?) They're not very pretty but they sure taste good! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I doubled the cardamom and cinnamon, like other reviewers suggested, and I think they could still use a little more. (but I really like spicy things!) Also, my dough was really sticky and hard to work with, as in it wasn't capable of being rolled into balls. I added at least 5 TBS of flour before it was firm enough to be manipulated. I don't know if it was elevation, humidity, or just the recipe. However, once I got it just right, they turned out perfect! =)

This cookie tastes phenomenal! I really like that it uses a handful of common ingredients. The dough was easy to handle, although a bit wet, but rolling and cutting was a cinch.   My rating is unchanged by this, but my partner mentioned that they were a "little plain".  I feel that they may not be ideal for people expecting full-on, super-sugared up Christmas cookies. I love that they are subtle and would pair well with tea, coffee, or cocoa.

These were pretty good. I followed others' advice & doubled spices and topped w cinnamon sugar bc I didnt have any colored sugar. I did tint the dough green instead. Wouldn't recommend doing cin sugar w tinted dough - not very pretty but tastes good

Being from Danish decent this was the first time that I made these cookies this Christmas and they are wonderful!!! The cardamom really adds a beautiful flavor that stays with you long after the cookie is gone. Everyone loved these cookies and found that you cannot stop popping them in your mouth one after another. Super easy to make and an instant classic treat for the holiday! A new tradition in our cookie spread for sure! I added a little more cinnamon per our family's liking. Bake a little longer if you prefer harder, more crunchy cookies.

These were excellent!! So simple, yet decadent. Very good. Loved the fact that they are so good & easy, plus made so many. They really help to fill out my Christmas cookie trays that I give each year. I'll absolutely be hanging on to this one.

Fabulous little delights.  Even people who never heard of cardamon, loved the taste of these morsels.  They definitely have a great shelf life as well.  I had one tray of baked pebber nodder sitting out uncovered for 2 days, and they tasted as fresh as if they just came out of the oven.  Great cookie.

Definitely add the 1/4tsp. ground ginger and 1/4tsp. white pepper! And you do not need to double the cardamom if you are using freshly ground--and freshly ground is the way to go. It's easy to break the pods open and use a pestle and mortar on them. My 5 year old did it and it just ramps up the flavor so much! I also found they cooked better with a better interior texture when I did the ropes and cut them like the recipe said. I did try them rolled into little balls individually too but they came out chewy in the middle and compared to the little squares, they had less spice flavor probably because the temp required to get it crisped throughout also toasts the spices and brings out their flavor.

I doubled the spices as a few other reviewers mentioned (2 teaspoons each cardamom and cinnamon) and dipped them in a mixture of cinnamon and sugar (four parts granulated sugar to one part cinnamon) to make them a little sweeter.  They still are not as sweet as normal American cookies, but I like them.  The first time I tried making them, I found them to be too gloopy to roll into ropes and made them as drop cookies. The second time, I got the bright idea to wrap the dough in plastic wrap and place it in the fridge for a few hours.  It firms up nicely and then you can roll into ropes and cut it as the instructions state.  I like the appearance of the cookies when made this way--like little pillows.  :)  I forgot to count them before eating a bunch (LOL) but I think it made about 90.  I baked for 4 minutes, rotated the pan, and then for another 4.  Perfect.

This recipe was so easy and the cookies are delicious. I melted the butter before mixing it into the sugar and used raw sugar instead of white. I also doubled the cinnamon and cardamom and added 1 tsp. of ground black pepper. I ended up needing to bake the cookies for 14 minutes to get them good and brown on the bottom, but that might just be my weird propane oven.    All in all this is a new Christmas favorite and I can't wait to make these again next year. Thank you so much!

I tried it initially exactly as written. The dough was sticky, so I chilled it for several hours before rolling it into 'fingers' as directed. I did not add more flour, though it was sticky to work, it was not unmanagable. I did most of the rolling by wrapping the segments of dough in the lg ZipLoc bag i'd chilled the dough inside. I will add a bit more flour next time (perhaps a half cup) My cookies, though I cut them as directed, did 'soften' when baked into small 'coin' shapes. Making them as directed is (IMO) faster than trying to drop them onto sheet. Cookie has a crisp bottom and a softer top (but not at all 'chewey' when sized and baked as directed) Flavor is mild, but nice. The Cardamom tastes ginger=like to me. I will have NO trouble using this spice in other recipes. I will make this cookie again with additional flour, a bit (1/4-1/2 t) more of the spices, and bake them a bit longer (1-2 min) for more 'crisp'. This will be a nice 'light' summer cookie, perhaps with fruit, or crushed as topping or crust.

Easy to make, followed the recipe exactly, I just cut it in half. I forgot when I left it in to bake, so I think I had it in for 5 minutes too long. They're soft & crunchy and still delicious! You can't tell if they're cooked or not just by looking at the top so definitely check the bottom of the cookie at 10 minutes. I powdered with sugar afterwards and it's scrumptious! It seems like it'll go well with tea, coffee or milk. Mmm mm.

I liked these a lot...although I did not use the cardamom because I didn't have it...they aren't overwhelming sweet or strong in any flavor, they are great with powdered sugar on them after they cool a little, also used red sugar and rolled them in it before cutting them to bake them. And! I used this dough to make thumb print cookies....easy to work with and tasty!  A must try!! Thanks for sharing!

These are such a great find. I was looking for something new and different. Who knew these little guys would create such a great compliment to the sweeter cookies that will be going out as Christmas gifts this year. My boyfriend compared them to little spicy pop-tarts. I just think they are YUMMY!  I also added about a half a teaspoon of pepper to the dough to give it a bit of a kick.

These are tasty little nuggets. And really quick and easy! I dipped them in colored sugar before baking and they turned out so yummy! My kids loved helping me make them and of course eat them! I'll be making these over and over!

I added mace,  pepper, and doubled the card & cinn. Red & Green sugar made them festive.  They melt in your mouth...Muahhhhhh...Yummy...More Cardamon..Hmmm Maybe powder sugar with Cardamon added and dust them and then bake :>)

Don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful cookie! Especially if you like Cardamom! However.. this is my first time baking with it and it was a V-E-R-Y prominent flavor in this cookie. Just a tad bit overpowering for me. I will use half a tsp next time I make these!

Really really easy, and great for the non-chocolate & non-nuts crowd...yet even I as a chocaholic still loved these. The only thing was I quadrupled the spices and even added a bit of ginger to the dough. They still turned out very lightly scented & lightly flavoured.

These had almost no flavor. They definately need more cinnamon. Also, I think they would taste much better if they were rolled out on powdered sugar instead of flour. Both would help keep them from sticking, but the sugar would add some much needed sweetness.

I make a batch of cookies weekly for my dad and I am always looking for something different.  I saw this recipe and decided to try it.  After reading the reviews saying it needed more cardamom and cinnamon I decided to roll the "pockets" in granulated sugar with a pinch of the spices in it.  That added a good bit of flavour.  The only other thing I would change is to add 1/2 tsp.of salt and a tsp of vanilla.  I might try it next time with the pepper.

My husband is from Denmark so I like to try recipes that he may have had as a kid.  When he says something tastes just like home, I know it's a keeper.  We couldn't keep these cookies around long enough.  I made them as the recipe suggested and they were perfect.  Thanks!

These cookies are FABULOUS!!!!!! My family loved them! My boyfriend was the only one who would have given them less than a five, but he is sorta picky. They are super simple. As is they are delicious, no changes needed, but I would add maybe a half a tsp more of the cinnamon and cardamon to give it some extra kick. Will definitly make these again.

I followed the recipie exactly and I personally think the cardamom was a little too much.  Maybe 3/4 teaspoon would have been better.  I opened a brand new jar of cardamom for this recipie, so maybe that's why the flavor was so strong.  Next time I'll also roll the cookies into granulated sugar before baking, to make them a little sweeter.

Great recipe.  I was looking for a Danish recipe to make for my mom this Christmas and this was definitely a winner.  I cut the recipe in half and it worked out great.  I also rolled the top of the dough into red sugar sprinkles before baking.  Definitely a keeper!

These are wonderful!  The first time I made them,  I followed the directions exactly.  They came out soft and with just a hint of spice.  To enhance the cardamom and cinnamon flavor in my first batch, I mixed powdered sugar with more cinnamon and cardamom, and dusted the little cookies with the sugar.  Yum!  Next time, I will add more spices to the batter AND add white pepper.  A lovely, tasty cookie.  And Very easy to make!

Saving this to my recipe box! We usually make my great grandmother's Kringler every year (my favorite) but for  church coffee time they can be a bit fragile as there is no egg in those. Seems quite a few end up on the ground! (??) But this recipe would take care of that! They sound delicious & I know the danish & Norwegian grandmothers would get a kick out of them! Thank you for sharing some Scandinavian recipes!

Since my Paternal Grandmother was half Norwegian and half Danish I had to make these. I doubled the Cardamon and added 1/2 tsp white pepper and 1/4 tsp ground ginger as other reviewers suggested to make them more authentic. Very good, you don't really taste the pepper until after you've eaten your last bite of cookie so it's not an overpowering peppery taste. Good to know if you are not a pepper fanatic like my son is!

These are delicious and simple.  I had a1 time getting mine to raise like the picture showed so they looked very square. However, this could have been because I had to use an egg substitute for allergies in our family so I could not downgrade for that.  I loved how small they were and very addicting.

I think the recipe is great.  That said, I did make a few changes that other reviewers suggested... such as additional spice.  I added 1/4 t white pepper, some allspice, ginger and cloves and upped the cardamom to 1 1/2 t.  They were 'too' spicy for my 6 year old... so maybe next time I'll tone that back a bit.  Normally he loves cinnamon and other Christmas spices, but it was a bit much. (not for me, just for him) I think a tab more flour is needed as my cookies flattened out very quickly and got crusty edges on some.  I did roll some of them in sugar, just to see the results and did like the little outer crunch it gave as well as making them look pretty.  So, when I do these for Christmas, I think I'll do them with the sugar.  I imagine some colored sugar on there would work well too and be very pretty.

Like others, I doubled the amount of cardamom and cinnamon. I also rolled the dough into balls by hand and baked them that way. I have to say that my cookies must have been much larger than the recipe calls for because I only ended up with about 30 versus 100. The cookies are delicious, a mouthful though. I may use pepper in the next batch!

Great cookie would suggest doubling the cardamom and cinnamon. Then adding a pinch of ground ginger and cloves.

Very good. Very spice heavy. Take a while to cut into tiny little pieces. This year, I just cut them into 2-3 inch sticks... just as good. Great for Christmas when you role them in red sugar!

These are lovely. I may suggest to put more cardemomma though. I added an extra 1/4 cup flour to the original recipe, because the dough was too sticky to handle. Also I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also rolled the dough in 1 inch diameter balls instead of cutting them and baked for 13 min. After cooling I sifted alittle powdered sugar on top. The result was great. Everybody loved it.

I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion and doubled the cinnamon and cardamom as well as added a dash of both white pepper and mace. While by no means a "pretty" cookie - my, did they taste heavenly. I think the looks turned off a lot of people, because I found myself prodding people to try them. Once they did, they didn't stop at one. Going to need to find a way to make them a little more attractive for next year!

Wasn't very impressed with this recipe.  Cookies were very easy to prepare at least but the it was lacking in taste.  =(

These were suprisingly delicious.  We made for some family friends who are from Finland and they said flavor reminded them of home.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I can see us making these for ourselves next time.

these were incredible! so cute and tasty =) i wish i would have added a little bit more of the spices and a dash of vanilla, but they turned out fabulous anyway! i also coated them with powdered sugar when they were slighty cooled and they looked beautiful on red christmas plates =)

I made these cute little cookies this morning and I had 255 cookies!  I made them as directed but made the rope smaller as I liked the crispy texture of the small little bundles.  The dough was sticky and rather than adding more flour, I chilled them over night.  I liked them just as they were but my husband likes sweeter cookies so I rolled them in sugar and some in cinnamon sugar instead--perfect !  Next time I will double the spices.  
My grand daughters will love these because they just look like a tea party ready to happen!

I made these cookies for the first time and they were a hit! My Mom wanted me to bake some more for the church christmas concert. First I followed the one review that said to double the spices in the recipe and then add mace, cloves, ginger, and pepper. Also rather than cut out nugget pieces I used a cookie press since the dough was the perfect soft, slightly sticky consistancy. Beautiful and delicious - this is a KEEPER recipe.

Wow. These. Cookies. Were. Amazing!
The best part was that the ingredients were so easy to find! I'm living in India so am always pleased to find recipes like this, as some western ingredients aren't available here. I even used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and whole cardomoms instead of the powder. Absolutely amazing!

I loved these cookies!  I made some in ball shape and some as the recipe specifies.  The ones rolled out and cut like the recipe directs were better.  The cardamom in these is so unexpected - they're really delicious!

These are good, but not real sweet.  I had to bake them about 5 minutes longer than it says in the recipe.  I really liked them and so did everyone that tried one.

I halved this recipe because I'd never had them before and was reluctant to have 100 cookies we weren't excited about.  However, they are really good and I love how they are tiny and bite-sized.  Delicious and cute and easy to wrap up for a tiny gift for the neighbors at tea time :)

I was very disappointed by the result.  Fairly boring, dry shortbreads, really.  I found that the cardamom and cinammon did very little to pep them up.  I won't make again, and probably will not add to my cookie trays, despite having about 80 of them!

This is a very tasty, very tender shortbread cookie. It's addictive, in fact! I don't like cardamom, so I subbed 1/2tsp nutmeg for it and they turned out great! Slightly spicy (from the cinnamon), not too sweet, they're perfect with some hot cocoa or coffee. They are a little bit of work to shape, but otherwise, I can't rate them high enough!

A very subtle cookie, not very sweet - which isn't a bad thing... I tend to like my cookies quite sweet :-) I doubled the cardamom & cinnamon, added the white pepper and mace.  I did roll into little balls rather than roll and cut. Next time I'll probably add the vanilla like some other reviewers, and roll in icing or granulated sugar.  I wanted to try it first as originally written before experimenting.  Mine turned out quite cakey in texture - not chewy at all.  I think in the holiday season with all the super sweet things on the cookie platter these are a nice change.

These were the easiest cookies I've ever made, and they're cute and very tasty! I'll definitely make them again.  I might add more cinnamon and cardamom, or try some cloves.  Great, easy cookies that would be fun to make with kids!

I really love these cookies.  They are pretty boring looking, so if you want presentation, these are not it.  They do make up for it in flavor.  Great with coffee or tea.

I made these tonight and boy, does my kitchen smell great!!!  Mine didn't take 10 min--they were so small, they only took 7 or 8, and I didn't want them too brown.  Anyway, thanks for a great recipe.  The only bad thing is I can't stop popping them into my mouth!

Made these into small bite size cookies. After they were cooled a bit I dusted them with icing sugar. They are very tasty and not too sweet. I’ll be making more. A great gift to give to your friends.

I have never had these cookies before so I don’t know what they are supposed to be like.  I used my smallest cookie scoop because the dough was not rollable, and I didn’t have time to refrigerate the dough.  I doubled the spices (per recommendations and just because I pretty much always increase spices when baking) and feel like they still could use more.  The raw dough was fabulous, but the baked cookies just lacked flavor.  BUT I am not a shortbread fan so maybe that’s my real issue.  I think my grandmother would have adored these dipped in her coffee.  I made a cinnamon vanilla glaze for my pumpkin bread this morning so I dipped the tops of my cookies in my leftover glaze and my family likes them better now.

I can tell just from the picture that these are not like the traditional pebbernodder that my family makes. My family's pebbernodder are much darker and include molasses to make them much spicier.

These are gorgeous little balls of yum! I doubled the cardamom and added a couple of shakes of white pepper. Rolled into balls and then white sanding sugar. They will make a great addition to my Christmas cookie trays. Must.stop.eating them. Sigh...

This is an interesting, yummy, fun  little cookie to make and I've added it to my permanent cookbook.   After reading other reviews I did add a dash more of all the spices to it except the kids prefer with less of the cardamom.  Also it's a fun easy cookie for kids to help with, they can roll the log, cut into the pieces, it's fun and easy!

A great recipe but make sure you follow Jayme spice direction to get a true spice cookie flavour! I make them every year for Christmas because that's what my family thinks they taste like.

Wow!  What an amazing cookie.  Addictive, not too sweet and easy to make.  I made these for Christmas Eve and my family (including my daughter) raved over them.  After reading many reviews I simply rolled into balls and baked (cute little cookies) instead of doing the ropes, etc.  Also, I put in 2 tsp of cinnamon and cardamom (I doubled it), dash cloves, 1/4 tsp white pepper and ginger.  Yum!  Next time I think I will try nutmeg instead of cloves and maybe a dash or two of vanilla.

I made these with my two nieces and they were fantastic.  Very easy to make and incredibly delicious.  The recipe is simple, which makes it great to make with kids, and they love to roll out the dough.  The cardamom is the key though, dont leave it out!

Super easy and great texture! I added white pepper and mace. I also rolled into tiny balls and then dipped them in white powdered sugar after taking out of the oven.  The quanitity was not 100 but still very impressive.

I loved the fact that these weren't too sweet and are perfect with a cup of tea, but my husband and daughter both didn't care for them, therefore the 4 star rating. I'd still suggest it, however, for a nice change from the sugar-overload we all experience at the holidays.

These were great, but my mom and dad both hinted that they were slightly bland. I rolled them into 1/2 inch balls and rolled them in sugar before baking them. After realizing that they weren't so sweet, I made a cinnamon glaze to spread on top of them, and both my parents agreed that it made all the difference. The glaze was made with 3 TBSP melted butter, 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 TSP cinnamon, 1/4 TSP vanilla, and 1 TBSP milk.

Clearly a 'keeper'!  This is a wonderful recipe of the traditional Danish cookie.  It's not as sweet as the typical American cookie, where I normally have to reduce some of the sugar called for.  Be warned: ground cardamon is expensive (about $10 for a regular size bottle).  But its flavour is subtle and balances well with the cinnamon.

I halved the recipe. It was too sticky to ball or roll into a rope so I made drop cookies. The cookie was kind of bland. If I were to make it again, I would up the spices 1/4 tsp each.  My hubby went out into the rain to get me the cardamom from the store.  He too was disappointed.

Perfect for the office Christmas party.  Everybody loved the bite sized nibbles.  Many had never tasted cardamom and are now hooked (I add more than called for as it is probably my favourite baking spice.

I followed the recipe exactly. Very good as is, but don't be afraid to double the spice (especially if your cardamom is anything but super fresh.)   Very easy to make, will make again.

i really was able to make 100 little cookies.  like the others suggested, i doubled the cardamom and cinnamon.  then i rolled out the dough and used a little star cookie cutter to make them a little more appealing.  i covered half of the cookies with powdered sugar, then i left the other half plain.  either way, they were really good!  all my students really liked the cookies.

These are great! Totally addictive!! I made these for a cookie swap party and everyone loved them! The only thing I did differently was instead of rolling out the dough, I dropped by rounded teaspoonfuls onto the cookie sheet. they also took about 14 minutes to make not 10. Great recipe!

I added the spices that one of the other reviewers did and rolled the little pillows in cinnamon sugar mixture.  They are perfection.  I can't keep them around for more than a day so I have no idea if they keep well.  A new family favorite!

My older daughter and I made these together.  We were amazed at how simply they came together, and how the rest of the family loved them!  We rolled half the cooling cookies in powdered sugar for variety, but both versions were gobbled up. A winner!

Well these cookies were easy to make I had a problem finding cardamom. The cookies turned out like the picture. I did not make 100 cookies I made like 70. I problay made them to large! The cookie its self was good. It was not that sweet. This also did not taste like a Christmas cookie.

These cookies were OK. My husband didn't care for them and my daughter and I thought they were OK....If I made them again, I would use less cinnamon, I think that would have tasted better and more to our liking. The dough is nice for a cookie press though.

Hmmm, I'm not sure how valuable this recipe is. Here's the thing. They ARE addicting, but they are NOT fabulous tasting (maybe they're only addicting to us carbo-holics???) I WILL make them again, but mostly because the cardamon is so expensive that I don't want it to sit in the pantry and go to waste, since I doubt I'll use it for anything else. They are not "all that", which I was hoping for after reading other reviews. They are, however, a good "fill-in", I guess you could say. They're tiny, kind of plain, nothing to look at, but they will vanish! The dough, however, does seem to be very versatile with lots of potential and possibilities.

These are really simple. My son doesn't like cardamom so I just added 1/2 tsp. each of cinnamon, cloves & black pepper. I just rolled into little balls and baked- they don't come out that pretty so I dipped each tiny cookie into dark chocolate to pretty them up. They are great with tea and to give away as gifts.

This recipe was easy up to the point of rolling the dough into ropes - then it got frustrating.  I finally figured out that the dough was slipping and not rolling because there was too much flour on the counter surface.  I ended up using hardly any flour to roll the dough into ropes, then I placed each rope on a lightly floured surface to cut it into "nuggets".  They cooked perfectly and their shape makes them irresistable!  The only other problem - and it's a major one - is the flavor.  The cardamom was not tasty at all to me.  I actually threw the cookies away. 
:(  Then I made the dough a second time, omitting the cardamom and using 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract instead with the cinnamon.  I do not like the dough and I probably won't even cook it.  Oh well.  I do not recommend this recipe and will never make it again.  It gets a 2-star rating because the dough is easy to mix up, and I think it would be possible to find a flavor that works well.  Maybe just a hint of vanilla and that's it.  I don't know... Good luck.

Om, im not sure what i did wrong because i can definately not roll these into balls...they were too sticky and runny for that. Regardless, i just used a spoon and dropped them on the cookie sheet and they came out sort of like little pancakes...delicious but not how they were supposed to turn out...

mmmmmmmmmm I took some advice by other reviewers and rolled them into balls then in sugar, I also added an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnimon and cardamon...it could have used double actually.  Oh they taste like Chai...They are def a new favorite in our house, I can't wait to try them with a little more spice.

I changed things up a bit.  Instead of the cardamom and cinnamon, I added a tsp of maple flavouring.  It's not traditional, but it is a tasty take on the original cookie.

Very easy to make.  My first batch yielded 220 cookies - I guess I have small fingers.  I used my thumbnail as a guide for 1/2-inch and used kitchen shears to cut the pieces.  Just sweet enough to enjoy many many many times.  I will try some of the variations posted here.  Thank you for sharing this with us.
