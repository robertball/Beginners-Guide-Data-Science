Simple and good. My wings were small so 1 hour was plenty of cook time for me. Next time I will broil them in that last 5 minutes instead of bake so that  they get more of a crunch to them.

A quick and easy wing recipe. I made two batches; one with sweet baby ray buffalo wing sauce and the other with sweet Baby ray BBQ sauce. Definitely broil then the last 5-10 minutes as suggested by souplovingnicole that made a huge difference. The wings came out crispier.

Absolutely delicious!  A lot less greasy than other wings!
