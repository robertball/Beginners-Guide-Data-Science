This recipe was good but I think it could have had a little more flavor, I think I would just increase the amount of garlic, lemon, and orange in it.

I was looking for for new recipe for the instant pot and came across this. I followed the directions exactly and my family did not care for this at all. The chicken was bland and the lemon/orange/wine mixture left an acidic flavor. I would suggest saut√©ing some onions, garlic and the lemon/oranges in the olive oil prior to adding the chicken. Then I would substitute honey (& add more than a teaspoon) sweetness to balance out all of the acid.  Even adding ginger would give this more flavor. I will not be making this again.
