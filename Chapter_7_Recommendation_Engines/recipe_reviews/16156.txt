I think Ginger P. has given us a terrific basic recipe that you can change to suit your own tastes!   My husband and I really like bold flavors, so here are my modifications.  I seasoned the meat heavily by adding garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, basil, and a small pinch of red pepper.  I too, added 1 bag of frozen mixed veggies, thawed in the microwave.  Once I had my meat mixture, onion, spices, and veggies combined, I added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.  Also, I doubled the potatoes.  I mashed them with 1 small can of evaporated milk, and 1/2 stick of butter, 1 egg, salt, pepper, and some garlic powder.  Oh and every chance I get now, I substitute ground CHICKEN for ground beef!  I saw it earlier this year at the grocery and decided to try it.  It is SO good, and not at all like the flavor of ground turkey which can be very stong.  This dish turned out SO good and was very flavorful!   Play around with it and have fun :-)

Considering I enjoy bolder flavors & shepherd's pie can be somewhat bland, I made this for a church potluck & doubled the ingredients - using 1 lb of spicy breakfast sausage & 1 lb of lean ground beef (like my family does meatloaf), browned the meats with the minced garlic & diced onion (instead of sauteed in oil) & drained the fat.  Added a packet of dry beef & onion soup mix with 2 cups of water & brought that to a simmering boil.  Disolved a few tablespoons of corn starch in another cup of cold water adding slowly to mix.  Voila!  Instant beefy/onion gravy!  Spread that out in my baking dish & layered the drained diced tomatoes, green beans, with an added a can of drained corn.  Lightly salted the layerd veggies.  Always running late, I chose to use boxed dehydrated real potatoes (4 cups of water, 1 cup milk, 1/2 stick butter, 1/2 tsp salt, boiled then added 4 cups of dry potatoes.  Instead of the additional cup of water, I used a cup of sour cream & then mixed in the beaten egg)!  Using a disposable force-bag & a wide tip, topped everything with the high peaked potato stars.  (Appearance and presentation is everything at church potlucks!) Nicely filled a 9X13 deep baking dish.  Baked 25 minutes until potato peaks started to become light golden brown, topped with the cheese & baked another 10 minutes until the cheese melted.  Voila!  The ladies were impressed & asked me how I did it ...  ... That's always a wonderful compliment for a guy who enjoys cooking & good eats!

I made this with a few modifications, after reading other reviews, and evaluating my pantry. Firstly, I ommitted the oil, because I didn't think it was necessary, and added more fat. I browned the ground beef with the chopped onion, and about 2-3 teaspoons garlic powder, as I didn't have any garlic on hand. After draining the fat from the beef, I added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, and half a packet of dry onion soup mix. I then added the green beans and tomatoes, and also a can of corn. It was plenty to fill a 9x13 dish,  so I doubled the potatoes. I actually used 6, because they were smaller. I didn't add any water to the potatoes, just a tiny bit of milk for creaminess, and stuck with one egg, even though I had tripled the potatoes. I made a mistake and topped it with cheese before baking, instead of later on, but it turned out just fine. This is a wonderful dish that has been added to my list of staple meals for our family. My husband just loved it, and we didn't even put ketchup on it! (That's saying a lot; I eat ketchup on everything.) So thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent basic recipe to run with.  As a suggestion for a more "dishy" dish, try tweaking the topping by mixing the cheese into the mashed potato topping and also adding a bit of sour cream and chopped green onions.  Lovely and rich!

This could be an excellent base for your own pie.  First - not enough mashed taters!  Double it, plus the cheese (mix in the cheese with the taters and make sure you add milk and butter when you mash.  Heavenly.  Secondly, there is no gravy with this recipe.  I usually add beef broth thickened with a roux to the meat and veggies.  Also, the meat is bland so I added a bit of garlic powder and a couple teaspoons of worcestershire sauce and it really made a difference.  We're Australian, so this pie is daily fare in Oz.  Sometimes I've even added a couple teaspoons of horseradish to the potatoes - a little goes a long way, but it sure adds a lovely taste.  Good basic recipe.

Fancy food it is not, but a downright awesome staple food it is!  Tweaked it a little using corn and peas as it seemed the versions I ate in London and in Boston had these veggies.  I was tempted not to add the egg to the mashed potatoes, but don't...some kind of reaction happens and the taters fluff up tremendously, making them not so heavy and much easier to spread over the beef mixture.  As other reviewers suggested, I added quite a bit of seasoning to my taste.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks, Ginger!

This did not knock our socks off but it's an easy recipe to play around with...adding or taking away what you like.  Instead of adding the canned tomatoes and green beans, I used a can of tomato soup with vegetables and a can of corn.  I also seasoned my ground beef really well, using different spices to prevent that "bland" taste.  I topped this with a handfull of cheddar. You can also prepare this the night before and leave in the fridge.  Just don't add the cheese until your ready to bake.

This recipe turned out awesome!! I agee with some of the others to use more potatoes. I used for small potatoes, which would be equivalent to the two called for in this recipe. Next time I will use four large potatoes. I also added a dash of red wine and seasoning salt to the ground beef before sautee-ing. Very flavorful!! Will definately make this again!!!

Good base recipe though I made some modificiations, hence the 4 stars.  After living in New England for 13 years where Shepherd's Pie is a staple, this dish was as at home with me as my family.  Living near the beach in Florida for the past 10 years, I haven't thought about this dish in ages.  I substituted 1 cup of sweet peas for the green beans (don't care for them) and 1 cup of sweet corn instead of the diced tomatoes (never had or heard of tomatoes in Shepherd's Pie), added 1 prepared cup of brown gravy mix poured over my meat and veggie mixture, mixed in 2 tablespoons of Hidden Valley ranch dry seasoning to my mashed potatoes before topping my casserole, and sprinkled a shredded cheese blend on top of the whole thing during its last 5 minutes of cooking.  And in true New England fashion, I topped each serving with a dollop of butter on before digging in.  Delicious!  We're having it again tonight for leftovers with some homemade crescent rounds sprinkled with garlic and parmesan, and I look forward to enjoying more of it for lunch during the week.  Next time I'll top it with either homemade garlic or cheddar potatoes.  Thanks for reminding me how great this recipe is.  This has to run a best close second to mac & cheese for comfort food  :)

Really good and easy!  I used ground turkey instead of beef, and corn instead of tomatoes.  To make it really quick use those "Simply Potatoes" that are in the refrigerated section of the supermarket.  An entire package was just the perfect amount!

This is a great base recipe for Sheperd's pie.  I would not suggest following exactly because it sounds like it would come out pretty bland.  I browned the ground beef with the onion and about 3 garlic cloves.  After draining, I added the basil, salt and pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, the green beans, frozen corn, carrots, a small can of tomato sauce and a little bit of water.  I let all that simmer together for about 15 minutes.  In the meantime I whipped up the mashed potatoes (I used instant), added sour cream to them and then put everything in the oven.  It was delicious!  I'm looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow ;).

This is a good shepherd's pie and very easy to adjust to personal tastes.  After reading various reviews, I adjusted as follows: omitted basil and tomatoes, added finely chopped celery, carrots, few dashes of Worcestershire to my meat mixture.  Dusted w/ 3 Tbsp flour and added beef broth for a gravy.  To the potatoes I added prepared horseradish to taste and used a cheddar w/ black pepper cheese (cracker barrel), dash of milk and 2 Tbsp butter.  Omitted the water, kept the egg in.  I have noticed in the past that adding an egg to your mashed potatoes helps them not to melt/disappear into the gravy/beef mix - also provides a nice browning.  This gave the potatoes  a little zip.  Enjoy!

I started out by following the directions excactly but when I tasted the meat mixture, it was a little bland.  To fix this I mixed together a 1/2 a can of Cream of Mushroom soup and a 1/2 a pack of Lipton Onion Soup mix with about a 1/2 cup of water.  Then I added it to the meat.  This made the best gravy.   I  also addded sour cream and a little extra butter to the potatoes.  My family loved this dish.  I will be sure to make this again.

My husband brought home a lb of ground beef and I just didn't want another meatloaf or hamburgers.  Then I found this recipe, and it actually was very good.. I kind of used the recipe as a "shell" and it turned out well.  Its the type of recipe you can tweak to your liking.  I cooked the onions a few mins and then browned the beef w/the garlic in it.  The meat MUST be seasoned well.... I added a LOT of garlic, salt, pepper, seasoned salt, garlic powder, and sage.  I added a can of a green bean/corn/carrot medley to the cooked beef mixture as well as some french fried onions which I had left over.  I made instant mashed potatoes (used the "2-3" servings which was perfect) to which I did add the egg and water (about half of what was in the recipe).  It cooked longer than what the recipe said (I think it cooked for about 35 mins before the potatoes got brown, I added some cheese to the top, cooked it another 5 mins, and YUM.  It was quick, easy and versatile.  I'm sure i'll be making it again!!!

So easy, So delicious! Okay, so I added an entire can (14.5) of diced tomatoes (italian style) as opposed to the fresh, same for the green beans and a dash of worchestire, roughly 2 tblsps of ketchup to the meat. I added a dollup of sour creme to the potatoes (instant), brushed the top with the egg and added shredded cheese at the last few minutes.  Yummy! Served with dinner rolls.

I too altered this recipe and it turned out great!!  Most cooks will know to drain the excess fat from the meat however it doesn't say that.  I used corn, fresh sliced mushrooms, and diced  plum tomatoes.  Also used Ukon Gold potatoes (3 medium size) and substituted the water with low fat milk when mashing.  Make sure you use salt or a salt mixture seasoning and pepper in the potatoes and meat mixture.

I needed a fast recipe in a pinch to use some ground beef.  I have two sick kids and wanted to give them a warm in your tummy, comfy meal. I just had a baby and was way too tired to think of what to make.  Thanks for helping us have a yummy dinner :D

Good recipe as is but switched it up a bit.  After browning ground beef, onion and garlic, I added au jus beef base 2 T., green beans and creamed corn, no tomatoes or basil.  Topped with cheese and then potatoes which I crisscrossed with a fork.  Sprinkled with paprika and cayenne.  Yum!!

Good recipe that you can add to. It totally won hubby's approval, so I'm all for it. :)

I added corn in addition to the green beans, and taking another reveiwer's advice I also added half a can of cream of mushroom soup. I made the mashed potatoes to go on top just like I would ordinary mashed potatoes (except I added their steps as well), I think otherwise they would have been too bland for our tastes.

All in all, a keeper. Thanks!

This was a very easy recipe, however I wished I would have read the other comments prior to making this dish. The dish was very bland, and it would have tasted better if the meat was spiced up prior to laying it out in the casserole dish.

Family loved it...as others stated I added a few more spices (black pepper and onion powder) but not too much.  Also added in more potatoes as well.

Never heard of a traditional Shepherd's Pie incorporating tomatoes before but perhaps I am to be corrected.  Added a can of diced tomatoes, fresh green beans were yucky here so diced some carrots and added some frozen peas and corn.  Added a bit of Worcester sauce to the  mixture.  Didn't add an egg to the mashed potatoes;just made my regular mashed and sprinkled paprika on top.

This was a really easy recipe. I never tried shepards pie before and it came out wonderful. I read the other reviews and made extra mashed potatos, also I omitted the tomato. I like tomatoes, but I actually forgot to use them. I did add a little thin gravy to the meat, and used some canned vegetables since that is all I had on hand. It came out wonderful, I had lots of compliments and there was nothing left the next day. Good starter recipe.

This was one of our favorite dishes growing up so it was a serious trip down memory lane last night when I made it.  It's almost the exact recipe that my mom would make, the only difference is that she always added a can of tomato soup to the beef mixture. It was delicious.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Good Shepherds Pie, Ginger. For personal taste I made the following modifications for my family. Omit tomato and use two-14oz can Italian-style stewed tomatoes, use 2t basil, 1t garlic powder, one cup frozen corn, and 3 medium potatoes. Omit water.Everything else stays the same. Be sure to put the egg in the mashed potatoes. Its a good binder for the potatoes, and they fluff when baked. Yummy. Thanks Ginger

This was easy and good, but I would add some more flavoring to it.  We had to use hot sauce.

I had wanted to make Shepherd's Pie from scratch, but did not care for most of the recipes I saw. This is a GREAT basic recipe! I did omit the tomato,seasoned the ground beef with house seasoning and parsely, and added a can of cream of mushroom soup. I also omited the water in the potatoes, using butter and milk instead. I also added the cheese to the potatoes and dabbed butter on the top to help brown. everyone loved it! My teenage son had 3 bowls, and his girlfriend had two. The leftovers did not make it 24 hours in the fridge!

This is NOT shepherd's pie, which is made with lamb mince (shepherds, lamb, geddit?).  It is COTTAGE pie.  Other than that, not a bad recipe (for COTTAGE pie!), though I would have used a tin of cherry tomatoes, plus a dessert spoon Branston pickle, plus some fresh oregano.  Amazed to see how many people revise it by adding cream and other hugely filling substitutes ... It's fine as it is.

I tried this recipe and found it very easy to make.  I did find it a bit bland so the second time around I added some seasoned salts and barbecue sauce to the ground beef.  It really helped the flavour.  I would recommend it for the easiness to prepare but would suggest adding your own special seasoning for added taste.

After reading other comments, I made sure to add seasonings... salt, pepper, and a bit of cayenne pepper along with a splash of red wine. I also used mushrooms, corn and peas, since we like those veggies in casseroles. I doubled the mashed potatoes and sprinkled paprika on top, along with the cheese. My husband gave it a thumbs up and asked if he could take leftovers for lunch to work the next day. Great recipe!

This is a very good recipe, however, I added more garlic, Johnny's seasoning, cream of celery soup, mexican corn to the hamburger mixture.In the mashed potatoes,  I used milk, and about 1/4 c. of margarine and omitted the water.

This is a great base recipe for Shepard's pie. I swapped some of the onion with chives and go with thyme and rosemary instead of basil which I think are all great compliments to the potatoes. Use any veggies you have on hand. -Add a half can of cream of mushroom and a couple tablespoons of sour cream to the beef right before it goes in the casserole dish for extra juicy meat and gravy.

My family simply can't get enough of this all inclusive meal.  I add peas and a can of cream of mushroom to the ground beef mixture.  It sure makes for an awesome gravy.

Very good. Not too dry & not too soupy. I never would have thought to put basil in this kind of dish, but it compliments it well. Would work well with other vegetables too. In fact I added corn, & my husband requested carrots & green peppers next time. NEXT TIME - that means he wants me to make it again. :)

I liked the basic recipe, but lacked proper ingredients.  Made with 10-12 small red potatoes, mashed, w/ 1/4 stick of butter, ~1/4 cup of water.  2-12.5 cans of Chicken Breast (precooked), 1 can of green beans, small onion. Wife loved it. Daughter requested corn and peas in lieu of green beans.

This is an awful recipe for shepherd's pie. My boyfriend makes his with onion, carrots, cream of mushroom, extra sharp cheddar cheese (he loves extra sharp, but for me it's too strong), and ground beef. He tops it with those pre-made biscuits that have layers (he separates the biscuits into thin pieces and lays them on top to cover the pie). I wonder if I can get him to let me post the recipe on here sometime.

You gave me the idea and I created my own. I used 1 lb. of lean ground beef and one large onion and browned in pan. Remove to a bowl and made a roux of 1 teas. flour, 1 teas. butter and 3/4 cup beef broth. Returned beef to pan and added 1 small can mushrooms, salt, pepper and 1/2 teas. cajun seasoning. Layered in 8x8" baking dish along with 3 cut up cooked carrots and 1/2 can drained corn. Top with mashed potatoes (mixed with sour cream, milk and a little grated cheese). and baked for 20 or 30 minutes. My husband and I loved it and ate almost all at one meal. Use whatever veggies you have on hand. I served it with a creamy lettuce. The Cajun seasoning did this recipe wonders.

Good recipe! I've never made shepherds pie before and I was delighted with the results! As far as the other reviews about not enough seasonings: Salt and pepper don't always need to be listed in a recipe, a good cook will sneak a  taste as they go and add seasonings as desired. Each family has different tastes. That's what I did...a little dash of sea salt, ground pepper, onion powder, dried herbs etc... Very versatile recipe, used ground turkey instead, we're not big on beef.... but that didn't really change the recipe at all. I do agree with "more mashed potatoes" that way you'll have enough to spread over the ENTIRE top of the dish. THANKS GINGER!!

This was good but I gave it four stars instead of five because it was bland. I recommend adding salt and pepper to the ground beef and potatoes for additional flavor.

As many have said, I wish I had looked at the reviews prior to making it. It was easy but very very bland. I will remember to drain off the fat next time as there was quite a lot of liquid.

Great recipe that great on it's own terms BUT is great with your personal add-tos.  Thank you-Allrecipes & Ginger!!! Like many of the other reviewers, I also modified the recipe.  My daughter had oral surgery n I needed to do/cook "soft" recipes.  I remembered when she & her sister were children, they loved SP.  I was hoping that my grandchildren would, too.  So, I hit the books looking for a similar recipe to the one, i cooked about 27 years ago.  Ginger's came close & was at hit.  I added frozen corn & used a tub of ready made Bob Evans mashed potatoes.  I only heated it once & spread it over the gr. Beef mixture. It browned well & I added the cheddar cheese.  Oh my, they loved it!  Next time will try the complete recipe.  Thank you, Ginger from my little family, the Yorks!!

The recipe was good, but just was not great.  Overall I was looking for more flavor, it was bland.

Followed recipe exactly except substituted corn for the green beans. It was mushy and bland. I'm a skilled cook, so I was quite surprised at how this turned out. Had to smother it in garlic salt & ceyenne pepper. There was 1/2 C of standing water in the bottom even tho I drained the corn & beef. If u try this, add lots of seasoning, make sure the layer of mashed potatoes is thin. And add some kind of thickener. Mine didn't even stand up & no matter how long i cooked it, wouldn't brown. I'm sure it could be improved upon if you're creative.

The flavor was good after adding a few teaspoons of curry and marjoram. It was extremely runny and oily and should be drained multiple times. They should of listed that in the recipe. I guess they felt it was common sense, but it is practical in a recipe to list all the steps involved in making a dish. Overall this dish was very tasty and good. But it does not "hold" together and is very oily so take that in consideration when deciding with dish to prepare it in!

Since my son won't eat tomatoes, I used a can of French onion soup instead.  Next time I'll try cream of mushroom soup.  I imagine any flavor soup would work.  No potatoes in the house, so I used instant instead, adding only the egg to that.  Also had no green beens in the house, so I used peas.  Out of Cheddar too, so I used Colby Jack.  This recipe allows for substitutes on all ingredients, and I like that in a recipe.  You don't always have everything on hand.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good! I forgot to add the tomatoes, but a splash of ketchup on top when served makes up for it. 

I added carrots, corn, broccoli, and mashed up quite a bit more potatoes. All because I only have a 3 quart casserole dish. I'll be making this again for sure!

I made this recipe for a Tuesday Dinner, my 11 years old daughter loved it, she told me mom this is the best dinner ever. I tell you why... I put green pepper onion tomatoes and cilantro in the blender, so she could't see any of the veggies. LOL I also omit the egg. and I added cilantro and garlic. I put everything in a blender and made salsa and cook the g-beef and I added the salsa.

This dish was really good, but I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because I changed a few things.  I used 2 cups mixed vegetables in place of the tomatoes and green beans.  I spruced it up with a little garlic pepper, and I added a dollop of sour cream and a teaspoon of horseradish mayo to the potatoes.  Very yum!

Found this recipe in "All Recipes Tried & True Slow Cooker & Casserole Top 200 Recipes" and cooked it up tonight. I made it item-by-item and step-by-step in accordance to the recipe and it turned our just great! Not only is it good as written, but I can see all sorts of possibilities for adjustments and additions as well. Whether it's called Shepherd's Pie or Cottage Pie, it equals a hearty and delicious comfort food dish! Thanks so much, Ginger!

I found this recipe because I was looking for something to do with the ground meat I had for dinner and couldn't stand the thought of my usual mainstays.  This was very good.  I know many people do not like when other cooks change the recipe, but I had to make some changes simply because I didn't have all the stated ingredients.  So I substituted boxed mashed potatoes for real (I use extra milk and real butter to help with the fake potatoes) and canned mixed veggies for the tomatoes and I added a little worstechire. Everything else was the same as the recipe. It was really good.  My husband said it was as good as the shephard's pie at Cheesecake Factory. Like one reviewer said, this is a recipe that is basic and you can change up when you want.  Great recipe that I will use again and again!

This is a great base recipe.  You can add as much or as few veggies as you like.  I like a lot of veggies so I added ~ 1/2cups: corn, carrots, celery, zucchini after I cooked the onion and ground beef.  I also make a gravy base for the turkey/veggie combo which includes 1 tsp of chicken base and 1 cup of boiling water (you can use the water from the potatoes for extra flavour; to thicken use 1 heaping tsp of flour mixed with 3 tbsp. cold water and add to the soup stock.  Add this gravy to the veggie combo for a fabulous flavour.

This was good but nothing special.  I added corn instead of tomato.  Maybe it would have been better with tomato, but I actually think it needs some kind of sauce or gravy to hold it all together.  I may try it again with cream of mushroom soup.

I really like this recipe. I make it at least once a week. Instead of the onion, corn & tomatoes, I use a 16 oz bag frozen vegetables (Green Giant Mixed vegetables) that is thawed. Make sure to add salt & pepper to the meat & vegetable mixture & to the mashed potatoes. For the potatoes I don't add the 1/2 C of water. I also don't top with the cheese. With the few moderations this recipe is a winner.

Very good.  Be sure to add salt and pepper to taste....it needs both.  I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the meat mixture.  Instant potatoes worked great.  My hubby loves it, so this one's a keeper!

As a vegetarian, I was looking for a recipe I could use burger crumbles (vegetarian ground beef) in.  This recipe turned out excellent with the substitution.  It is pretty rare that I can make a vegetarian meal that is so quick and hearty.  My husband (big meat eater) even loved it!  I used instand potatoes which turned out fine and, I suspect, much easier.  The burger crumbles cut out half of the fat and calories of the original dish.  I also think canned diced tomatoes, drained, work best.

This was good, but there are a few things I would change the next time I made this. The first thing I would do is season the potatoes. If you make this, whatever you do, make sure you season them well b/c this dish is flavorless without it. A previous reviewer said that it needed alot of salt and pepper, and that's true. Other than this, the dish was easy to prepare and was received well by my family. I had a craving for this dish (which always reminds me of lunch at my elementary school).

One of the very best I have ever tried.  Only tweaks I did was used 3 potatoes and used mixed frozen veggies which I thawed out first.  The fresh tomato was a real nice touch - husband raved about it - definitely a keeper!

I'm usually not a fan of Shepherds pie but my husband loves it so I decided to give it another chance. I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and used corn instead of green beans to give it a bit more flavor. We both ended up loving it! This meal will be a regular at our house.

I gave this 5 stars because I added one package of onion soup mix, a can of cream of mushroom soup, and two teaspoons of of Mrs. Dash seasoning.  I omitted the can of tomatoes and doubled the potatoes.  My college age son loved it.  He even made of point of asking me how I made it!  He never does that!  Will definitely make this again.

This is a good recipe but as others I too made some changes. I omitted the tomato and made a gravy with the pan drippings from the ground beef....added peas instead of green beans....added 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs to the ground beef. It was a great hit.

Excellent base recipe.  Changed in the following way:  Used fresh basil, allspice also tripled the mashed potatoes.  Used combination of corn, carrots and beans - close to two cups for veggies.  Also used romanos marinaRa sauce instead of tomatoes

Good, easy and quick recipe to put together!! I omited the tomatoes (I thought that was weird). Next time I will add a can of cream of mush soup and will double the potatoes, and will probably replace the green beans with corn, just to mix it up! We will make this again....

was so so. not too impressed...would defiantly alter a few things... like the potatoes...maybe use milk instead of water for a creamier mashed potato... or I'm sure to make it simply boxed mashed potatoes would work great.

This is a fabulous base recipe! I needed an easy, fast, weeknight dinner that my 14 mo. old could also eat and this was it. We both enjoyed it so much. I also just realized that I completely forgot the egg. Oops! Oh well it still tasted great! I gave it 5 stars because it was so simple and so good.

This was good, a great combination of meat/vegetables/potatoes. Husband and kids liked it. Did need a bit of salt. And I added more cheese.

Okay- I am not a Sheperd's Pie person.  Never was, probably never will be.  It is a texture thing for me with the mashed potatoes and the meat and veggies all together.  Hate to say it but my kids are the same way (after today's meal).  My husband made this exactly as written and I will tell you the flavor was REALLY good.  If you like this type of casserole- you will not be dissapointed.  I was pleasantly surprised!

Loved this! And it was for once right on with the serving size! I added cooked carrots, but besides that followed the recipe to a T - and I'm glad I did! I will definitely make this again so I can play around with more ingredients!

Yum!! I agree with other reviewers, this recipe is a great starting point to add what you like, and it tastes great! Also it is simple and quick (+ my 14 month old picky eater gobbled up all the veggies! need I say more!) I did make some changes -- added Worchestershire sauce & soy sauce to the ground beef as it was browning (the wort. sauce soaks into the meat, giving it a great flavor). Then I also added cajun seasoning, salt, pepper, garlic powder & Italian seasoning. I added whatever frozen veggies I had (corn, green beans, peas) and fresh chopped tomato. I also made a gravy using a roux and beef bouillion, then poured it over the beef mixture in the casserole. The potatoes I used "pizza" shredded cheese mix (find it at grocery) and some parmesan, with butter, milk, salt, pepper. Popped it in the oven and it camr out "DE~LISH"! I would recommend this one and feel free to experiment, I think almost anything would work great in this recipe.

This recipe was great for hubby and kids. I changed it a bit using corn and peas instead of green beans and tomatoes.  I also used frozen mashed potatoes since I was pressed for time.  They loved it! Thanks!

For the most part, it was a quick easy, enjoyable meal.  The only thing I would do is to jazz up the meat a little, as it was bland.  We needed to salt & pepper up the dish before we ate it.  I have a beef seasoning spice that I'm going to try the next time.

These little changes make this a very delicious, easy dinner: Used 3 cloves garlic, a few dashes worstershire, and mixed dry onion soup mix with 1 cup boiling water.  Added 2 teas. corn starch to make thicker gravy sauce. Added this to meat.   Combined corn to  meat mixture and let simmer.  Used instant idaho potatoes and used evaporated milk to make these instead of plain milk. Added the suggested beaten egg.  Took adive of others and included about 1/2 cup or so of sour cream and garlic powder to mashed potatoes.  Topped with shredded cheddar and broiled for last 2 minutes.  EVERYONE ate their dinner, and I have 3 kids with very different tastebuds!

This is a great basic recipe.  I omitted the basil and tomatoes.  I did add 1/2 teaspoon each of seasoned salt and old bay seasoning as well as 6-7 dashes of worchester sauce for seasoning of the meat.  Instead of tomatoes I sprinkled a heaping Tablespoon of flour over the meat after it was cooked then cooked it for a couple of minutes, then added canned beef broth to desired consistenty.  I omitted the water for the potatoes and used 1/4 cup each of sour cream and milk. Be sure to add some ground black pepper to the potatoes.  This is a great way to get rid of leftovers.  My family loved it.

Made this last week for dinner and it turned out great.  I did use carrots and green beans. I also used left over mashed potatoes for the top. This was great. Served it with beef gravy on the side. I will be making this again for my family.

This recipe was good, even though you may think that it is weird with green beans and tomatoes. It is actually very good and something different compared to the boring old fashion shepherds pie. I did 4 pototoes, instead of 2. You may want to, depending on if you want it to cover it all or not. The cheese on top got all nice and brown. When it was done, put some salt and pepper and bam you got yourself a kicked-up shepherds pie.

Was a lot better when sour cream was added to the mashed taters. Also, sprinkle shredded cheese on the meat mixture as well as on top of the potatoes. Very yummy!

I only gave this recipe 3 stars because mine came out very dull and unflavorful. I think the reason is that I didn't mash the potatoes with milk and butter as I normally do. I just mashed boiled potatoes and smeared them on top of the meat mix. Had I used milk and butter I think the recipe would've been outstanding. I wasn't clear on what to do with the mashed potatoes, but I recommend using butter, for sure.

Bland, bland, bland. Although I took others' suggestions and added salt, pepper, worcestershire sauce, onion powder, etc., I couldn't put any life into this recipe.
I did like the addition of an egg to the mashed potatoes -- it really does puff them up -- and I will make this addition to any other Shepherd's Pie recipe I try in the future.

This a very good and quick recipe - easy to adapt if you don't have the specific ingredients that it calls for. I, like other reviewers, added some extras: salt, pepper, worcesteshire sauce and extra veggies. I didn't have any potatoes on hand, so I used a 4-serving portion of instant mashed potatoes. My kids haven't eaten anything like this before and they loved it.

This was really good.  I used instant potatoes (enough for 6 servings)and didn't add the eggs and water and used mixed vegetables.  Everyone liked this and even my picky teenager ate it after picking out the veggies.

This was a great crowd pleaser (my family!)  They enjoyed it thoroughly.  It was really easy to prepare.  I added a few things in response from the other reviewers (worsch. sauce, spices, etc) But you really can't go wrong with ground beef and veggies!  This is a keeper!  Thanks!

Not much flavor - much better the 2nd night.  Next time I would add more veggies and I agree with the others to add more potatoes.  I probably will also add something to the potatoes such as sour cream and extra butter.

For a more wild flavor, I substituted ground elk and venision, used sweet potatoes for the mashed, and blended goat cheese rather than the listed cheddar.  It was a fantastic and robust country style shepherds pie, and everyone loved it.

I agree this is a good basic recipe.  I read some of the reviews and made my own version.  I left the drippings in the pan after frying my meat and made a roux to make gravy.  The mashed potatoes I did increase the amount and added garlic to them when I blended them.  I poured the gravy over the meat mixture before putting the mashed potatoes on top.  It turned out pretty good and next time I will try some different veggie combinations.

Always a big hit in my house. I'm asked to cook it every few weeks and there are always leftovers for a few days. I did add a good bit of soy sauce to the meat as well as a few spices when browning to add more flavor.

I thought this was ok, but the meat needs more seasoning.  Next time I will probably add some catchup or Worcestershire sauce.

Once upon a time I used to make shephard's pie using a jar of gravy or a can of Manwhich to flavor it.  Once I was diagnosed with high blood pressure, I thought shephard's pie was off the dance floor in my house!  This version fits the bill and is much healthier without losing flavor or taste.

I'd give it 5 stars but I changed a few things. I added a can of mushroom soup. I added 2 tbs of Worcheshire and season the beef with salt, black pepper, garlic and onion powder. I only had corn on hand and that worked just fine. I cooked potatoes just as said but added cream cheese and cream to make it more yummy! I have done this in the past and did not have enough potatoes. I used a packet of instant and a few potatoes that I did have on had. Worked out just as good. My husband LOVES this meal. Its a HUGE hit at our house. He even eats the left overs, and he NEVER eats left overs! Its almost better the next day.

Let's see...1st time making shepherd's pie and liked this base a lot.  Cooked my 4 large potatoes with 1/2 an onion and mashed them with a lil 1/2 and 1/2, a lil milk, lil cheese, some salt and pepper and 2 tbsps butter, plus the egg.  As others did I added a can of cream of mush, green beans but no tomatoes, just wasn't in the mood.  Used ground turkey seasoned with dash of worcheshire, garlic, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Cooked at 350, couldn't get them to brown, turned on broiler, VOILA!  Topped with cheese and really enjoyed!  Thanks.

many ways to cook this dish,I like to add a pack of good hot dogs (nathans or casper) cut up in small pieces and fry and then add with all the other ingredients. I also use a can of mixed vegetables and a can of corn and always mash the potatoes never instant.

I think this is a great inspiration for boring ground beef.  I made quite a few changes to make it healthier.  First, use organic beef and veggies, that will automatically make everything taste better!   This is a good dish to sneak in some bonus health food.  I added 1T kelp powder (for iodine) 1T liquid aminos (for saltiness, you could use tamari too).  Also, instead of cream of mushroom soup, I added about 1 c fresh mushrooms and 1/2 cup cream to the nearly finished mixture.  I also boiled the 6 medium potatoes with a crushed garlic clove, and mashed them with cream and butter (these are good for you in moderation!).  Finally, I added some delicious sage cheese to the seriously sharp cheddar at the end.  It was a huge hit for both my family and the friend's I gave it to.  Make enough to share or to freeze for later.

I own an allrecipes cookbook that I've never really used, so I decided the other day I would try a new recipe every week.  This was our first and it was really yummy.  I took the lazy way out and used instant potatoes, but it was still very good.  I will make this again.

This is a great base recipe. I made a few changes.  I added some herbs to the meat mixture. (basil, thyme, Italian Seasoning). I also substituted the tomatoes for salsa (it gives it a little kick). And I put mixed vegetables such as carrots, peas, and green and yellow beans.  For the potatoes, I added a little bit of milk, some butter and a dash of salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Occasionally I substitute the potatoes for sweet potatoes or squash to put a different spin on it.

I thought this recipe was pretty good! I made some alterations though. Because the end result of meat mixture had nothing to hold it together, I added a can of tomato paste with a can of water. This made a little sauciness that I thought it needed. Then for the mashed potato topping, I omitted the egg, added warmed milk instead of water and added a handful of grated cheese to the mixture. The end result was a dish my whole family loved!

My husband liked it okay, but I wasn't a fan.
I didn't care for the tomatoes in it and it was too oniony.
It also needed salt and pepper.

As others have said, good base recipe. I made it exactly the way the recipe dictated and I found it to be a bit bland and kind of oily... Next time, I'll omit the oil and spice the meat a bit more.

Great recipe.  I put in corn and brocolli instead of green beans.  I added a can of cream of brocolli soup, but that made it a little runny.  I'll leave that out next time.  Instead of basil and garlic, I used Italian Seasoning.  I used instant mashed potatoes and added sour cream.  It made way more than 4 servings, so we'll have lots of leftovers.

Oh my gosh - I can't believe I never reviewed this.   It's a staple in our household.   I use instant mashed potatoes instead of real ones and this works out just fine.     Every recipe I use needs more spice and I'm sure that's our own personal taste.   Give this one a go - it's great.

This dish was a hit at our house.  I made it with ground beef, onions, mushrooms, diced carrots, and peas. No special seasoning but salt, pepper, and a little garlic. Before putting it all in the casserole dish, I mixed in a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I whipped up my potatoes, added the egg, and spread them over the top to bake with lots of cheese. There are no leftovers-the casserole dish has been washed and put away!  My kids raved and hubby requested some for his lunch tomorrow.  Definitely will make this recipe often!

This is SO very much better using cubed beef rather than ground beef!

I took the suggestions of some of the reviews posted here and I'm glad I did!  I added 3 cloves of garlic, a little extra basil, a can of corn, a can of mixed peas and carrots, and a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I also mixed a bit of sour cream with the instant mashed potatoes that I fixed but that didn't work out too well. (my fault, I added too much liquid! otherwise it would have been fine) Also since I'm a vegetarian I added Boca burger veggie crumbles instead of ground beef -- which turned out great!  Even after the extra spices I put in I still needed to put some ketchup on top !  All in all this dish was great thanks to the reviews put on this site.  The only way to improve the dish I made would be to use real mashed potatoes instead of funky instant ones.  Thanks everyone!

This recipe for Shepherd's Pie was sooo great!  I made it (with a couple of variations) for my family, and they all went back for seconds!  I omitted the egg in the taters, that way I wouldn't have to cook it as long, and I used cream of mushroom soup in the meat and put a little seasoned salt in there.  It gave the meat a very good flavor!  I added different veggies and took out the tomato too.  Great recipe!  Thanks!!

We thought this was just o.k.  We didn't care for the green beans and the potatoes were too watery, even though I used 3 potatoes.  I would omit the water, use 3 or 4 potatoes, and just use a little milk while beating them.

I made this recipe a few nights ago only changing a few things.  I added some El Pato sauce to flavor up the meat, I left out the green beans, added a can of corn (drained), added a handful of thinly sliced carrots, used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes.  I made the mashed potatoes as normal, using both butter and milk and then added an egg and cheddar cheese.  I noticed the mashed potatoes didn't even begin to brown in the stated time, so I changed to oven setting to broil and it browned the potatoes and cheese to a light crunchy topping.  This recipe is definitely a winner as we loved it.

As others have said, this is an excellent base for a delicious comfort meal.  I used tomato sauce and a few squirts of ketchup in place of the tomatoes.  Even if you use tomatoes, you'll need some ketchup or sauce--too bland otherwise.  I also added a little extra garlic and a few good doses of Worcestershire sauce to the beef.  Instead of just carrots, I use a can of mixed veggies, but that's just my preference.  Then, just "power up" your 'taters with a dollop of sour cream. Have played with this one quite a bit, and it's now a fave with my boyfriend and I. Thanks!

this recipe is much better if you add taco flavoring to the meat when cooking it and using corn as the vegetable. i made it without taco seasoninf for years and while my brothers loved me for it my husband didnt care for it too much. He loves it now. I love it even more since my son in law told me to use the taco mix.

This is my first recipe from allrecipes.com, and I am very pleased! Thanks to everyone's comments I made a few modifications. For starters I was VERY generous with the spices, used 2tsp + oregano, basil, garlic salt about 6/7 cloves of garlic...I used a bit of each of these things while cooking the meat as well as milk and cheese in addition. Then I sprinkled cheese over the meat before adding the potatos, put fresh garlic, cheeses and spices in the mashed potatos, and then sprinkled the potatos with cheese at 5 minutes left. Also I used frozen mixed veggies instead of the other ones listed. The dish turned out delish! We still needed to salt to taste afterwards (shows how the bland the dish will be without extra spices!!) but then it hit the spot perfectly. Thanks for the recipe! I will make this again.

This is a great way to "clean out the fridge".  I added all the leftover veges I could find as well as extra fresh veges.  I also added a packet of dry onion soup mix.  It was delicious!  Even my 1 and 4 yr olds loved it!

I loved this recipe, but I changed it around to fit what I had at the house. Instead of ground beef I used beef cubes. Instead of the vegetables the recipe asked for, I used half a bag of mixed veggies. (Green beans, peas, corn, etc.) I made some brown gravey and put it in the bottom of the dish before I added the meat. It went well with the mashed potatoes. I also added garlic, slat, and pepper to the mashed potatoes. My family loved it. We are fighting over the left overs!

I agree with the others that say this recipe needs salt and pepper. I wish I had thought of worchester sauce also. I added green onions and sweet chili peppers (mild) and it still needed more flavor. I would also add more potatoes.

Great recipe. I added a tin of creamed corn, salt and pepper, doubled the potato and added 2 eggs. It tasted great but next time I will add a little worcestershire sauce for a bit of kick ! My five year old loved it.

This is a keeper - my children prepared it for the family meal. They left out the onions, used a can of nibblets corn instead of green beans and used "Betty Crocker" flavored instant mashed potatoes.  They loved it (and so did I)!

I liked this recipe, but would strongly suggest adding salt and pepper as listed ingredients.  It was very bland.  I know this because my husband salted it and he never salts his food.  With the added salt it was really good.  I also substituted peas and corn for the green beans (I don't like them) and used about twice the mashed potatoes.  My 17 month old daughter loved it (and I have trouble getting her to eat meat).  She ate a big bowl of it.  I will make this one again making the adjustments I mentioned.

Pre-Mash your potatoes and pre-cook your ground beef. I didn't catch on to this tip until it was almost too late. Other than that, love the recipe! I substituted sweet potato and added more veggies (peas & corn). Tasty!

A very satisfying dish that has now become a tradition after serving for the first time this evening.  I doubled the recipe and it was superb!

Wow! Delicious! I was at first quite skeptical , but like other reviewers mentioned, I added lots more seasonings to my preferred taste (pepper, garlic powder, etc.) This was a great way to use leftover mashed potatoes from the nights before dinner :) I was shocked at the outcome- and I even used canned tomatoes, since I had no fresh tomatoes. Also, I substituted the green beans with 1 can of drained corn. Great recipe- thanks for sharing it!

Used this recipe with sweet mashed potato to include more fibers.  The dish turned out to be very tasty.  I also used diced carrots and green bell pepper since I did not have green beans.

I like this recipe I made a few changes .I added 1/2 cup of red wine 
To the recipe after i stirred in the tomatoes basil and garlic and I let it cook for 10 more minutes till the beef was well done!!!! I also added mushrooms to the mixture.

To the mashed  potatoes I added some salt and pepper when I was mixing it because otherwise it's to bland in my opinion.Than I put in the  oven came out amazing.it gave the recipe some kick! Bon a petit!

We had this the other night and I was very impressed. The basil blended so nicely with all the other ingredients and made you want to go for more. Next time I think I'll leave the water out; I think it made the mashed potatoes to runny and try putting the whole thing under the broiler for a few minutes before serving to put a light crust on the mashed potatoes, other than that I don't think I'd change a thing.

I've never made Shepherd's Pie and have never had it in my life. Frankly the thought of making this was intimidating but the recipe was easy enough to follow and our household loved it. We can't wait to make it again!

General format for the meal is patently plain and to a certain degree is attractive for a quick and uncomplicated meal. After regaling the family with  recipe results, I have deduced that with simple additaments, the meal would be enhanced by slight modifications to the potatoes and the meat. The potatoes need more, perhaps butter to liven up the taste. Next, the meat was in need of more spicing which can be accomplished by adding a more powerful assortment of spices. I am certain that sautéing the brown onions with minced shallots, minced garlic, minced green onions, and very finely minced green jalapeno in olive oil, then combining with parsley, oregano, eggs and Italian bread crumbs, all added to the mixtures above before cooking would yield a tighter and more flavorful dish. I give this recipe a 5 star for the simplicity of cooking and the reality of being able to use spices which are usually on hand. Great meal!

This is a very good recipe with some changes.  I doubled the potatoes and made mashed potatoes with milk instead of water.I added butter,egg seasoned with salt & pepper.I also seasoned meat with salt, pepper and I added veggies and cream of mushroom. My husband loved it. I am sure I will make it again. - Raji

I have made this recipe twice now. The first time I used ground beef with corn, peas, and the cheese on top. Excellent! The second time I was to late into the cooking process before I realized I'd run out of ground beef. The only thing I had left was ground venison. I thought "What the hell" and used that instead. It came out fabulous!! I highly recommend this wonderful little recipe.

This was absolutely wonderful and very easy to make.  I did add a little to the recipe.  I used frozen mixed vegetables in place of green beans, because I didn't have any on hand.  I also added seasoning to the meat mixture while cooking just to ensure that it had a little more flavor.  I will make again and again!  Also, the video was very helpful!  Thanks.

This was great!! I did tweak it a bit. First, I only misted a pan to sauté the onions and used only 8% lean ground beef. That was enough oil/fat to sauté the onions. Then in the beef I added about 2-3 ounces tomato sauce, and seasoned salt in addition to the other seasonings. In the mashed potatoes I used nonfat milk and added about two tbsp light sour cream. My children thought this was the best version yet!!

Pretty solid recipe for a basic shepherd's pie. I used a can of tomato soup with a little water since I didn't have any tomatoes. Still turned out really great.

I added a teaspoon of jalapeno pepper and cumin, a small can of sweet corn and some tomato sauce to the beef. I also mixed part of the cheese with the mashed potatoes (I used the flake kind), and added some powered garlic too. I microwaved it, since I'm too lazy to preheat the oven, and it turned out just fine. Thanks for the recipe!

I omitted the cooking oil and onion, instead cooking my meat with a package of onion soup mix and the basil. I made my mashed potatoes with 3 large white and some garlic and butter. Next time I will add sour cream and cream cheese to the potatoes. I omitted the water, opting for milk. I added crushed red peppers for some heat. This is a yummy dish!

I wanted something quick and easy for dinner and this was it. I made a few changes. I omitted the tomatoes and added cream of celery and used peas and corn. I didn't have any potatoes so I used instant mashed potatoes. We loved this dinner. I didn't have to force the boys to eat.Hubby said this would be a good recipe to use left overs for. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing!!!!

I remember using this recipe when I invited a friend over for dinner a couple of years ago (yes, it's been that long since I made shepherd's pie cos my family doesn't take beef).   I used both canned tomato paste (or puree works too) and fresh chopped tomatoes to add a little more moisture to the beef. I also cooked the beef mixture a while longer than the recipe calls for as it was still pretty raw.   As for the mash potato, try using milk instead of water to give it a creamy texture. It was divine!

This recipe turned out pretty great. My wife and 5 year old loved it and ate every crumb. My wife even wanted the recipe to give to her parents. Of course I couldn't JUST do the recipe...I did add/change a few more things. I sauteed the ground beef with the onion and 2 tbs crushed garlic from the jar. I then added one can of whole kernel corn, diced tomatoes (with the liquid) one can of peas and one can of green beans. I then added about 2 tbs of Worcestershire and browning sauce to the meat. Then a pinch of dried basil and cumin. I added 1 cup of chicken broth instead of water.

To the potatoes, I used instant. I added milk, 1/2 stick of butter, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 egg and 1/2 - 1 cup of Tillamook medium cheddar cheese (grated). Whipped until creamy. I then added more cheese on top during the last 5 minutes of cooking. WOW- it was great!

This was absolutely tasteless.  A lot of trouble for little results.  There was no flavor to the meat at all.  I've had shepherds pie before and this isn't deserving of the name.  Sorry, will not make again!!!

This is a great highly customizable recipe. I made it pretty much as written, I did add a can of whole kernel corn (excellent addition) and some salt and pepper to the meat/onion mix. I did cook the onions with the meat as others had said and I omitted the veg. oil. 

Notes for next time/recommendations. Next time I will try adding a can of cream of mushroom soup and I will pour the egg mixture over the beef/vegetable mixture BEFORE I add the mashed potatoes. A 9"X13" baking dish was perfect and I topped it with 8, 1/2 cup servings of instant mashed potatoes. I also used Colby cheese which tasted great. A little sea salt really wakes up this already flavorful dish. I drained the beef before I added the vegetables and I drained the vegetables as well. 

I really liked this recipe because of its endless customization options. You can add whatever vegetables you want and this will probably taste great with whatever ingredients you can find in the cabinet.

I have not made this recipe and I'm not going to comment on the taste, procedure or quality but, I do want to comment on the picture.
I see carrots, corn and green peas which are not in the recipe, as far as I can see anywhere. What I don't see are any green beans or tomatoes that are listed in the recipe. 
The picture is from the contributing cook so I would expect the picture to honestly represent the product. I suspect it may have been taken from another site somewhere or a cookbook?
Thanks for letting bring this to your attention.

It was a good sheaperd's pie recipe, but I changed a few things on my own.  I cooked the hamburger first then added the onion, basil, etc..  I don't think there was a need for the water to be added either.  I was a bit lost on why it needed to be there in the first place.  However, it is a must with the cheese on top.  I'll make this again, but next time I'm going to add more vegetables in the mix.  I think that'd add much more to the taste.

I agree with the previous review.  This recipe gives basic ideas for a lovely family dish.  I also modified by seasoning the beef with garlic powder, garlic pepper and worchestershire sauce.  I also added mixed veggies and prepared savoury mince sauce to add flavour to the beef.  As in previous reviews I had to double the amount of potatoes used as 2 werent' enough to cover the beef mixture.

This was excellent.  I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef, peas for the greenbeans, and used a chipotle-chedder cheese.  My boyfriend is already asking for it again.

I agree with the others.  A great recipe that can be suited to fit anyones tastebuds.  My husband is a big meat and potatoes kind of guy and he loved it.  I too omitted the oil and added cream of mushroom soup and almost a whole packet of onion soup mix.  I didn't have any cheddar cheese on hand so I used the pre shredded mexican blend I had.  Good meal for a cold day.

This was a good base recipe.  I used a bag of frozen vegetables instead of the ones listed in recipe - but I did saute an onion and a few cloves of garlic. Remember to season your ground meat mixture well - otherwise, it's bland central. I also used instant mashed potates and added the egg in the end. I DID NOT add the 1/2c water.
For extra flavor, I added a small drizzle of EVOO, garlic and onion powder the final 5 minutes of cooking.  I didn't add any cheese to the top.

Excellent! Very easy, very quick, and VERY filling. I will be making this a lot. It is in need of a little more seasoning, and a little less onion...but then again, that is just my specific taste. Excellent recipe!

I love this recipe!  The only thing that I did a little differently is, after the 3rd or 4th time making it, I decided to start adding more veggies.  Now when I make it I add corn, Green beans, peas and cooked potatoes...my husband loves it!

This is a good standby when you don't know what else to cook.  I made the mashed potato part my own way, adding sour cream and some cheddar cheese.  Very simple to make, and not bad at all.

Tasty & easy! I used skim milk instead of water for the potatoes, & added a can of corn. I seasoned the meat as I always do with garlic & spices so there was plenty of flavor. It was more like 6 servings than 4. Delicious. Thanks Ginger!

This was delicious!  My whole family loved it.  This is what I did different: used 4-5 garlic cloves, 2 c. frozen green beans (1 c. doesn't seem enough.  Added 1 tsp. oregano, Adobo seasoning to taste - or you could use 1-2 tsp. garlic salt.  For the potatoes, you need to add milk, butter, Adobo seasoning or garlic salt & pepper - and use only 1/4 c. water since you will be using milk.  They turn out creamy and flavorful this way.  Leftovers are great!

So hearty and filling!  I browned the hamburger as I normally would, which gave it more flavor.  I also made the mashed potatoes with butter, milk and just a dollop of sour cream.  So, so, so good!

Very Yummy! I made this according to the recipe. Only change - added a can of peas (drained) and used a bag of tator tots instead of mashed potatoes. My husband was skeptical at first, but ate almost half the pan!

I didn't have any potatoes to put on top of this recipe, but it still came out great.  Instead I used a cheese topping.  I also added some leftover veggies from the fridge such as corn and peas.  This had all of our proteins and vegetables in one dish!  Very easy to make--simply throw it together!  I suggest making enough for more than one meal, too, because it refrigerates well.  The kids loved this one! :-)

This recipe was a little on the bland side.  I think it could use a little tomato gravy with the ground beef and vegetables.

omit tomatoes, add a can of cream of mushroom soup, add frozen carrots, peas, 1/2 c milk and corn and a cup of cheddar cheese into the mixture

when cooking meat, add garlic and onion powder, dash of basil, oregano, soy sauce...  

cooked for 20 min added more cheese on top- cooked another 5 min, and then broiled for 5 more min- made the crust nice and crispy!  yum!

Good recipe. Instead of green beans I used some carrots and peas. I also used frozen mashed potatoes and didn't add an egg to it, and it worked fine.

I actually modified this recipe a bit.  I picked this version of Shepherd's Pie because it was non-dairy.  I'm lactose intolerant.  I made a 4-serving packet of instant mashed potatoes with soymilk, chives and garlic powder, instead of the egg/potatoe mixture.  I also added worchestershire sauce and a splash of BBQ sauce to the meat mixture, salt and pepper.  I used 1/2 can of stewed tomatoes, instead of fresh tomatoes.  I never had had sheperd's pie so I wasn't sure how the end product would look/taste.  But it was very good, I discovered I could make mashed potaotes w/ soymilk (just heat it slowly).  I think next time I will add a little more veggies and a 1/2-3/4 lb. of meat.  I'm not used to such meaty dishes.  I liked this dish very much though, however my picky husband wouldn't touch it.

It could use some salt and pepper. I would increase the potatoes by 1/3. The cheese on top was a winner. This will be very good as left-overs.

It was okay, but a bit watery and flavorless. At the very least it needs some salt. I would add taco seasoning to the ground beef next time. I used a package of instant mashed potatoes and a lot more cheese. You can't have too much cheese, IMHO.

I did make some changes I brown my hamburger meat with my onion at the same time and I put my carrots in some butter in a skillet to soften those and I put that on top of my hamburger meat in a 13 by 9 dish and then once my potatoes were boiled I added the egg and water as directed and put those on the top baked it for 15 mins then put the cheese on top finish the last 5 minutes just us the recipe calls for and then I melted some butter in a cup in the microwave and put it on top just to give it a little more moisture and flavor and it is amazing!

I cooked the ground beef first & drained it & set aside.  Then I cooked the onions and chopped carrots instead of green beans.  Added sliced mushrooms after about 10 minutes.  After another 10 minutes added the cooked ground beef.  Cooked a bit to warm up the beef then put in the casserole dish and topped with mashed potatoes & cheese.  I used more cheese than recipe called for.  My husband went back for seconds!

I have been looking for a mainstay recipe to make on a rotating basis and this is definitely that type of recipe. I gave it four stars for great dish but needed a bit of flavoring. I added a little salt and pepper this time and may add more next time I make it, doubled the garlic for my own liking, and I used ready made potatoes to make it even more simple to make. It was simply delicious. My husband and son went back for seconds and there was no leftovers.

I would double amount of spices. I substituted black beans instead of green beans, and added 1 stick butter to mashed potatoes. Next time I may add corn and/or carrots.

Very simple and quick recipe! And as other reviews said it is a great base recipe to make your own and add or take away whatever ingredients you decide. I was trying to make something quick since my husband had to go to a meeting so instead of making mashed potatoes from scratch I used a half a bag of frozen mashed potatoes. I also used half a bag of frozen mixed veggies thawed in the microwave instead of fresh green beans. I didn't realize I was out of onions so I used onion powder as a substitute. I also skipped adding the egg to the mashed potatoes but from what I read in the reviews I shouldn't have skipped that. (I will try that the next time I make it!) The last thing I changed was that after I cooked the dish for the 15 minutes I put it under the broiler for a few minutes to get the mashed potatoes a little bit browned. (I skipped the cheddar cheese on top.) My husband and I enjoyed this dish!

My family likes this recipe but I make some changes.  I use two pounds of ground turkey.  I cook the onion with the turkey, then add in diced tomatoes, 2 cups of thawed mixed veggies (peas, corn, green beans, etc), and a small jar of turkey gravy.  Add seasoning as preferred--I often add garlic and Italian seasoning.  Put that in the casserole pan and top with 1 packet of instant mashed potatoes, prepared as usual and with an egg added in.  Top with cheese and bake.

We loved this recipe. It's so simple and delicious. 

I had a little over two pounds of ground beef, so I had to double some seasoning. I also had a stock pile of canned goods, I used over fresh - still delicious.

My changes:
Cook the onion with the beef instead of in oil first. 
Add a can of green beans and a can of sweet corn, forego the tomatoes.
Drain the ground beef mixture.
Added a can of cream of mushroom, a can cream of chicken,  1.5 tsp worcestershire, then salt and pepper to taste.
I also used instant potatoes made to its own recipe instead and topped with colby jack.

It was just OK. The flavors were good but the filling tasted dry. It needed about double the potatoes that it called for. Easy, potentially good recipe if more potatoes were used and some kind of sauce or broth was added to the filling.

I will definitely make this again. Minimal prep work and it was delicious. I had to substitute mixed vegetables for the green beans and it worked out fine. I also doubled the recipe and that worked out great too. This is a keeper.

Excellent base recipe I made some adjustments.    I seasoned ground beef with salt and garlic salt to taste I used canned diced tomatoes. I used quite a few golden potatoes because they are small so I probably used 3 regular sized potatoes. I added ghee and sour cream and salt to the mashed potatoes. I couldn't stop eating it. Very good next time I make it I'll use carrots and peas. Yum.

Delicious.  I used the vegetables I had on hand - green beans and corn,  omitted  the tomato sauce, and made the mash potatoes the way I usually do.  It was easy to make and very tasty. I will definitely make it again.

Super easy to make and customize, and it was a HUGE hit, even with two very picky eaters. I'm not sure if I've ever seen them eat that fast and every last crumb of it to boot. The leftovers even were also devoured in record time. Will add this in for a regular rotation in our dinner lineup.

this is a very easy recipe, I change it up a bit to make it suitable for what I had in the house.  I had a lb of ground meat and had no idea what to do with it.  I didn't have potatos so instead I made a cauliflower mash as a substitute.  l also did not have tomatoes, but did have a pack of mixed veggies in the freezer.

Needed salt and pepper desperately. Pretty good for such a basic recipe, and easy to prepare if you're busy. The lack of flavor was disappointing, but oncertainly you bump up the seasoning, it's perfect.

I don't think I did things the right way for this. I hadn't made anything like this before, but I inherited a Dutch Oven and thought this might be a great dish to try. It turned out to be a gooey, greasy mess. I don't think I should have left the lid on during the entire baking portion, I probably used ground beef with too much fat, and even though I made a ton of mashed potatoes to go on top they didn't create the correct ratio of beef to potato to veggie. Overall, it was a bland-tasting, yucky, gross-colored first effort. My husband was a great sport, saying that it "wasn't too bad". I'm giving this a 3 because it seems many of the recipes I use through this site are bland, but the bulk of the problem was my error in preparation.

Never had shepherd's pie before, but have been wanting to try for a long time. This was a great recipe. Even the kids loved it. As I had no canned or frozen veggies on hand, I used some diced yellow and green squash for the vegetables. I doubled the amount of potatoes as I figured two would not be enough. Glad I did! I blended the potatoes with the egg and water and added some pepper and folded the cheese into them as well. Also, after reading reviews, I added garlic salt and brown gravy (from a packet) to the meat mixture. It made it much more flavorful. The only thing I will change in the future would be to not add the egg, as it made the potatoes more fluffy, but turned the dish into mush. I didn't get the desired crust from them. Also, I had to cook for an additional ten minutes and it still did not brown. When I try again without the egg, maybe it will take less time to crust. Great recipe and very versatile!

I liked this recipe a lot. I added stewed tomatoes, garlic powder, 3 gloves of minced garlic, green beans, and sliced carrots to mine. For the potatoes I added bacon bits, butter, and a little milk. I topped it with colby cheese. Delish! Thanks Ginger.

This is a very good staring point to making the AMERICAN version of Sheppard Pie. It allows for your own personal touches. I gave it 4 stars ONLY because I prefer the traditional style of this dish.

This recipe is quick, easy, kid friendly, inexpensive & tasty as written.  I love that.  We have eaten this many times.  What I also love is that you really can't mess it up.   Just added things we like, and it gets better and better.  I have made this  again tonight, this time using hot Italian sausage with the ground beef, added corn, and using tomatoes with habanero peppers.  I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, some Worcester sauce, extra garlic, and mixed pepper jack cheese with my mashed potatoes this time.  It's really good too.  If you double everything, and put in the stuff your family likes, you can't go wrong.  Thanks for this recipe.  A definite keeper.

This was really great! I did put about 4-5 potatoes worth of mashed potatoes on top since we love mashed potatoes.  I also used ground turkey since it was cheaper.  I added a little beef base (can be found near the boullion cubes) to give it a beefy taste.  It was demolished and people were milling around the stove scraping at the pan (yes, even the kids).  Will make again real soon!  Thanks for sharing!

Based on other reviewers' comments, and my instincts, I doubled the amount of mashed potatoes.  I also wanted to use a crockpot instead of the oven, so I added about a cup of broth with the meat and vegetables.  It turned out well!  Removed lid from crockpot for the last thirty minutes to let condensation evaporate.

My kids that dont eat anything loved this. They didn't pick out the veggies either. I followed the recipe exactly except I seasoned the potatoes with margarine salt and pepper. I also seasoned the meat with season all as it cooked. I added about a 1/2 cup more green beans and tomatoes. I will definitely make this again.

We really enjoyed this recipe!  The only thing I did differently was I substituted Johnsonville bulk Italian sausage for the ground beef.  Let me tell you..it really made a difference!  My husband and I could not stop eating this one!  SO good!  Thanks Johnsonville!

Very bland although I did season both the meat and then the vegetables. Ugh. Had to eat with BBQ sauce. The potato mix only puffed around the edges where I had added more mashed potatoes. Next time I will skip the water and just put on mashies with a bit more milk. I tripled the amount of potato and it still seemed short.

This was a tasty, hearty and easy main dish.  I substituted thinly sliced carrots for the green beans, sauteing them with the onions to soften them up.  Thumbs up from everyone at the table!

Directions were easy to follow, but it is very small. The mashed potatoe mixture on top also was not thick. It's a good way to use up ground beef, and a dinner meal, but I would double or triple the recipe.

This recipe is going to be a staple in our house! Its a simple way to use ground beef and any veggies you have that you are wondering what to do with. I added some shredded carrots and mushrooms as well and sprinkled a bit of the brown gravy mix to give it a gravy feel. My 2 boys had 3rds! Thanks so much!

I love it!!! Great recipe!! It's really quick and easy. I put a can of cream of mushroom soup in it and it made it really creamy. Plus I have a big family so i doubled it. Oh and I didn't put the basil in or use fresh garlic. I just used powdered garlic insted. Thats all and it was really good!!

The recipe is fine, pretty traditional cottage pie. I like throwing in some paprika, sometimes thyme or rosemary as well. Don't like basil with this.

VERY GOOD "BASIC IDEA" RECIPE....I have a bad habit of changing recipes up...but they always turn out great! I cooked my potatoes in chicken stock to add more flavor....I added corn instead of tomatoes (yuck)... I cooked my corn and beans in beef stock. Everything else was as listed, except for heavily seasoning my beef with seasoning i ALWAYS use on hamburger meat for a more bold taste. And of course...i added some Essence of Emril to my cooking veggies and topped off with a butt load of cheddar! YUM! Not bland like previous Shepherds pie recipes! OH...And please people !! Cook your onion in butter...not oil! it will taste O MUCH better!

This is a good recipe, but it could be a lot better.  I agree with those who say you should add more potatoes.  Also, seasoning is key, salt and butter for the taters, pepper throughout, and anything else you think would work most likely will.  Overall this recipe is a great start.

This was definately a disappointment.  I followed the recipe to the letter and found the potatoes on top to be watery and gritty, and the meat mixture was soggy.  This recipe did not do it for us.  I will not be making it again.

This has become a family favorite! I only made 2 changes. First, instead of 1 cup diced tomatoes, I used 1 can of Rotelle with green chilis. Second, I eliminated the cheddar cheese but added 3/4 cup of velveeta cheese in mashed potatoes while mashing.  Awesome!!! Thank you very much!

Awesome. I used roma tomatoes, over leftover ground buffalo!! These two layers were followed by canned sliced carrots. Added a little sour cream to the mashed potatoes and two cloves crushed garlic. Just because I am a a garlic fan.

It's a good basic starter recipe for a delicious dinner. Don't know if you can call this a "Shepherd's Pie" as Shepherd's Pie is usually not made with beef. But nevertheless it is a good recipe.

I thought this recipe was great. I revised it slightly, using corn instead of green beans. And using one of the reviews suggestions with the soy sauce when browning the hamburger. I also put green peppers in it as well along with the onion. I made some gravy and mixed it into the hamburger and the vegetables. It was delicious, everyone loved it. This is the first time I made Shepherd's Pie, and it's one that I will be making alot more of. Thank's for the recipe.

I was craving a great recipe for Shepherd's Pie.  This was perfect...I used ground turkey (which is better if you want to eliminate extra calories) and frozen peas and corn.  I saw on some other reviews the addition of Cream of Mushroom soup, but I used Cream of Chicken (undiluted, heated in the microwave) and it was a nice addition.  Use some Betty Crocker instant mashed potatoes for a quicker cook - it's much faster, and layers the same over the turkey/veggie mixture.  I added some ground red pepper to the mashed potatoes to give it a spicy kick.  This is a great recipe and I recommend it to all!

I made this a few weeks ago and was surprised how well it turned out.  Normally my husband hates Shepherd's Pie but he went back for seconds and thirds!  I will definitely make again, but add more potatoes, since I only used the recommended two, and that wasn't enough.

I liked the taste but it was VERY watery or something at the bottom of the dish and my potatoes never browned. I will try it again though.

The basil gave this recipe a good flavor.  I made it without the cheese and it turned out nice.  What I like is that the cook can easily change veggies in this recipe to keep it interesting and different.

This meal turned out well.  My husband and I enjoyed it, but I felt it was a little blah.  I used Diced Tomatoes with Chiles which gave it a nice kick.  I feel it could have had quite a bit more seasoning of some sort.  Overall though, it was very yummy and easy to prepare.

I followed some of the suggestions of other reviewers, (Corn, onion soup mix)and it didn't turn out like I would have hoped for a shepherds pie.  Too dry and too much potato.   If I made it again, I use less potato and try and make more of a gravy w/ the meat.  But I don't think I will make it again.

Very easy recipe!  I will omit the tomatoes next time as they seemed to make the "pie" a little runny.  I would also follow other suggestions and "liven" up the meat.

This did not go over well with my family. Although I added some oregano and someone else suggested, I still found it to be bland and the potato mixture to be sparse. I added additional potatoes. A seasoned cook can probably liven this up, but I am more of a by the book cook.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  I tried it because of the good reviews and was disapointed.  The dish kind of fell apart and it seemed like something was missing to make the casserole stay together.  I might try this again but maybee with cream of mushroom soup to keep it together more.

For my family's taste, this recipe is so-so. It gets three stars for ease of preparation, but overall it's not one of our favorites....might be good for a family with younger children, as it's on the mild tasting side and you can kind of hide veggies in it.  Thank you anyway.

I'm not a fan of tomatoes so I left them out but it seemed as though the beef was missing something more. Will try it again with some of the modifications mentioned. I must say though my picky 7 year old LOVED it!

Not too bad of a start but it needs some 'oomph' to it.  I would add steak spice, salt, and pepper to the ground beef while cooking.  For the mashpototes, instead of an egg and water, add cream cheese and garlic salt.  To get rid of the access liquid, drain the meat/veggies before you place into the casserole dish.

This recipe was so easy and delicious.  I also added corn like some of the other suggestions.  To save time I bought the ready made mashed potatos by Country Crock in the garlic flavor.  I cooked them as directed and added the egg.  They were perfect.  I also used beef gravy to pour over top when serving.  My husband loved it so much that he took some leftovers to work for lunch the next day.

Instead of using ground beef, we crumbled 4 frozen turkey burgers and it tasted really good. And we used corn instead of green beans. My fiance had almost half the pan for dinner and just finished the rest of it for lunch today. Reheated very well.

My family loved this recipe.  We substituted the tomatoes for a can of cream of mushroom soup and omitted the oil.  We use a touch of dill to make the flavors all come together.  A quick version of this dish is to just put the meat mixture right on top of the mashed potatoes.

This recipe was very tasty and pretty easy to make.  The only gripe that I had about it is the bottom meat layer would not really stick together and it was a bit runny...even though I drained the fat from the meat.  My husband enjoyed it and I will make it again!

This was good but a bit on the bland side.  Next time I will add butter to the potatoes and salt and pepper to the meat and vegetable mixture.

This dish went over very well at my house.  We added lots of spices and also made a vegetarian version with veggie burgers instead of ground beef.  Very good!

This hit the spot!  My picky 4 year old eater liked it-and he even HATES potatoes!  And my 1 year old had FOUR helpings!  
I seasoned the meat with salt and pepper and added a little more garlic-there was nothing bland about this meal.  Yummy!

This was too bland for us. It's not picky toddler friendly, either - my 3-year-old wouldn't go near it. My husband liked it just a little more than I did, but that could be because I'm not much of a shepherd's pie fan.

This was fine, not great.  Just too bland.  I added garlic powder and a can of beef broth.  That seemed to help.

I think it's a little too much basil.  But other than that, it was a great meal.

Very good recipe! Added corn, and peas to the greenbeans, garlic and worsteshire sauce to the ground beef as it was cooking. Placed in a caserole dish, and made fresh mashed potatos with LESS milk than normal. Put that on top, covered with some cheese and it went FAST. Everyone loved it.

I love this simple recipe. It is very easy to make. I added some milk and a little flour to the ground beef so that it is not too dry.

At first i wasnt too sure about this recipe. But i was interested in just trying it. The directions werent as specific as i would've like but i followed them the best i could. I drained half the fat out of the hamburger mixture after cookin it. I didnt have the garlic or the other seasoning so i added a dash of lemon pepper and season all with a little dash of garlic salt. It was very good. My husband loved it and he ate pretty much the whole thing. Next time i think i will make some brown gravy and layer it between the beef mixture and potato's. It needed alot of salt and pepper too. But overall it was great!! Thanks!

Pretty good. I was able to convince a couple of real picky eaters to have some and they asked for seconds! I will make this again.

Excellent recipe!  My kids ate big bowls of it...the only thing I did different was to add more veggies and some Mrs. Dash.
