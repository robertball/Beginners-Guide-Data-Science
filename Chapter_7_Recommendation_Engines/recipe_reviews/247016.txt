I thought I had reviewed this before. This is excellent! I followed the directions and can not think of a change I could or would make. For those who do not like heat,you could cut back on the Jalapeno,but I love spice and heat.

Super easy to make - quick, the only thing I did was adjust the chili paste. Personal preference of not as spicy. DEF making again

Flavour is great, and the Tuna is perfect to pre-prep and have it for lunches.
