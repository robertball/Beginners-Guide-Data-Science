This recipe did not work for me at all.  I made it as written, and the sticky burgers never cooked into anything remotely solid at all.

I thought this was pretty good. However, salt is a no-no for so many of us and 2 teas. salt plus the Soy sauce was incredibly two salty. I had topped mine with sauteed mushrooms and golden fried onioons on good whole grain bun. Good kids ate it without a fuss.

well i didnt bother with salt. not with soy sauce being added. cuz lets face it soy is flavor and with alot of salt. used reduced sodium. added shredded carrots and mushrooms. and used lil less on the oats. turned out great. definitely will make again. oh and for ppl who might hae em not stick together try to let em sit several hour after u make em into patty form. always helps. no matter if its vegan burger or crab cake. lol.
