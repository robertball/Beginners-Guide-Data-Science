This was very nice but a little too bland for me.  I made it on a multi-grain baguette.  Next time I would use fresh ginger to give it the kick it needs.

I tried the recipe out, but found it to be too bland for me. So I added salt, onion powder, garlic powder, chipotle powder, paprika and some red cayenne powder to spice things up a bit. I added the spices in about 1/8 - 1/4 teaspoon amounts and tried the adjustments on four triangles of bread until I got the taste I liked. (It then wasn't an asian dish anymore.)
