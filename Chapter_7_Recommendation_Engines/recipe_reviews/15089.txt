I actually pan-fried my pork chops with the sauce, and the doneness was perfect. Pan-frying, especially for beginners, is the easiest way to ensure that the pork is not overdone (you can poke at the meat to feel when it's cooked). I also marinated the chops with some of the sauce for half-an-hour before frying it - don't leave it marinating for too long, or the vinegar will denature the meat. Changes to sauce: cut back the ketchup a little, double the Worcestershire sauce and halve the vinegar, add more brown sugar (this cuts down on the sourness and helps the sauce to caramelise and become sticky). Make more sauce, you'll find it disappearing as you baste. You may want to fry some garlic before adding the chops. This sauce is reminiscent of a bbq sauce, as others have pointed out, but it's lighter and doesn't smother the meat like bbq sauce can. With the changes, it's superb with pork. I'm definitely noting it down.

Absolutely wonderful!  I have been looking for a new way of cooking pork chops!  I used boneless pork chops.  I did not have any vinegar so I used lemon juice instead and added garlic salt to taste.  I also prefer to do things the easy way so I threw the chops in the crock pot, poured the sauce over them, set the temp to high and let it cook for about 4 1/2 hours.  They came out so tender that we could cut then with a fork and one chop (that was thinner) actually fell apart in the crock pot.  When we finished them up I was sad that we did not have more!
I would give this one more than 5 stars if I could.  Deffinantly a keeper!

I used the thick pork chops from Costco and followed the directions exactly.  We really enjoyed these...especially my extremely picky 9 year old son.  We will definately be making this again.  Thank you for sharing!

This was not that good.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cooked them in a grill pan basting with the sauce.  The sauce is pretty bland and the taste of chili powder is not appetizing in this.  My husband did not care for this either.  I won't make this again.

I was a little disappointed after reading all the great reviews! Unless i did something wrong. I basted every 3 minutes & did this a total of 5 different times (till the juices ran clear) Mine came out burnt, I moved them down & didnt place directly under broiler after the 3rd time.. They were o.k. But NOT fast like ppl said...

I made these for dinner tonight and they came out very well.  My older brother, who is a notoriously picky eater and rarely will try anything I make, ate two pork chops!  I consider that a definite sign of success.  I was a little skeptical about the recipe after reading other reviews, but was very pleased with the way they turned out.  Very simple and easy to prepare.  I didn't have any paprika OR chili powder, so I used cayenne and parsley instead.  I also substituted 1/3 of the ketchup for BBQ sauce after reading other reviewers' complaints.  Thanks for the recipe!!

We thought these were really good. Even my son thought they were good (and that is saying something). I cooked them on the grill instead of broiling.

This is a definite personal taste recipe.  My family and I are not huge fans of barbeque so this recipe is not for us.  However, if you really like barbeque (and more importantly barbeque sauce) then you'll probably really like this recipe.  The pork turned out really tender - a first that I've encountered!  That was really great!  I wanted to avoid the "too ketchupy" taste that others wrote of so I substituted 1/4 c. barbeque sauce for a 1/4 c. ketchup.  It actually turned out well, my family just doesn't like barbeque.  Anyway, thanks for sharing!

Very good!!  I used a little more brown sugar than the recipe suggested and apple cider vinegar.   This is a quick and easy I can wait to try it with chicken!  Thank you!

I really liked this sauce.  I rubbed some minced garlic on the pork chops before adding the sauce.  And I didn't broil- cooked on a George Foreman Grill.  Came out quite tasty!  Husband liked having the extra sauce to put on the pork chops as we ate.  I'll make it again.

I tweaked this recipe a little, but it was a good base!! My husband and I aren't big fans of ketchup, so I used 1/4 cup of ketchup and 1/2 cup of Budweiser brand BBQ sauce. We tasted it while the sauce was simmering, and found it to be too acidic, so I added even more brown sugar, and that helped mellow it out. 
I used thin (maybe 1/4"?) pork chops, and I believe they took a total of 12 minutes to cook. They came out very tender, juicy, and my picky husband told me 3 times how good they were, so that's a winner in my book!! Thanks!  :)

very tasty!  i love sauce so i doubled it & i put the chops in the middle of the oven & rotated a few times (mainly because we have the extra thick ones from costco) - this way they won't burn.

These were delicious! I only had 3 chops and the amount of sauce was good for that as I put them in the slow cooker for 4 hours. I also added a generous amount of Sriracha Hot Sauce for some kick.

Very bland and runny. Maybe less water, honey instead of brown sugar more spices. What ever it lacked...It isn't worth messing with again to get it right. I won't make this again.

Family was not too impressed.  One son liked it pretty well, but I thought it was too acidic and another opinion was too ketchup tasting.  Pork Chops were tender though.

What a wonderful change from just broiling the chops with seasoning salt like I usually do. My hsuband and I both loved these.  I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe because it was so close to another recipe I use a lot, but it wasn't near as good as my other recipe.  I will be going back to my other recipe.  My husband was also very disappointed.

Pretty good. I used smoked salt, smoked paprika and chipoltle chili pepper. Tasted like it was grilled but very moist and tender. I think that is the most impressive thing about broiling vs. other techniques. Reeeeeally most and nice. I think it needs to be thin like this. If you used bbq sauce, that would  burn before the chop is cooked.

This was delicious. I loved it. I just wish my fire alarm sensor wasn't so sensitive because it went off twice when I was broiling it. Half way through it, I ended up making it in a flat pan but it still turned out very yummy.

This was ok.  I had read the reviews saying it was too watery so I left out the water.  It tasted too much like vinegar for my taste.  I will try it again without the vinegar and more brown sugar.  I think it would be better that way.

Although this recipe was tasty, I found the mess to be a real pain. I'm still scrubbing the burnt sauce off my new baking dish! If you're going to make this, be sure to use a disposable foil pan.

We just LOVED this recipe!  I think next time we will probably marinade in the sauce before broiling.  Great sauce!

These were o.k. I do not think that I cooked it correctly. I do not have a broiler pan so I used a 9x13 baking dish with a wire thing on top so it could drip. When we sat down to dinner we found that they weren't cooked all the way. So we  desided to cook they some more. The sauce was not very flavorful. The pork chops were not gross but they were not wonderful.

Very good.  I do not have a brush so I spooned the sauce on and it worked great.  The reserved sauce was needed at the end though or it would have been too dry.

These were a hit in our house.  My husband loves BBQ and thought these were great.  My only complaint is that they took about double the time to cook as the recipe called for.  Not sure why?  Will make again for sure.  Thanks for sharing.

If no chili powder is available you can
substitute it with garlic salt by spreading
it on the pork chop itself and massaging 
the flavour in.  It is important to do this
before you prepare the sauce because there
will be more flavour and it keeps the sauce
from being to sweet.  Everyone will enjoin it.
It is my favorite pork chop recipe.

The sauce not only taste good, I think it keeps the pork chop tender.  I regretted not making more after the 1st bite.  It will be one of my regular dinner recipe.

These were good, the sauce was tangy, but tasty.  Out of white vinegar, so opted for cider vinegar instead, but nevertheless was still good.

We enjoyed this, and the sauce was good, but not sure I will make it again.  I prefer pork recipes which have more tender results... sour cream pork chops and marinated pork tenderloin from this site are both to die for!

I also added BBQ sauce to tone down the ketchupy-ness and felt this needed more brown sugar to carmelize this into a glaze.  It was just ok.

I loved this, but I made a few changes: used 1/4 c.  ketchup, 1/4 c. BBQ sauce, 1 c. water (we like a lot of gravy), 1 TBSP brown sugar, and a bit of honey. I marinated my boneless pork loin chops for 1/2 hour, softened some onion slices with butter on my pan, cooked the chops right on the pan and I added the sauce. When they were cooked (which was pretty fast), I removed them from the pan, and thickened the sauce with 2 TBSP of cornstarch dissolved on a bit of water, for an excellent gravy. Sounds like a lot of work, but it really wasn't! We all loved them!!!

This was an excellent sauce for the pork chops....had just enough zing to it.  Better than using just bbq sauce.  I did double up on the liquid so I could pour more of it on the chops.  I'd definitely make this recipe again.

Nice sauce, I added a little garlic and ginger. The pork also came out very tender. I will definately make this again when I don't have time to leave the meat to marinade for long.

We did not care for this recipe, but it may be because I did not follow the recipe as written.  I followed a few other suggestions and tried the slow cooker.  It was like we were eating boiled pork chops.  The sauce actually had a good flavor and probably would have been good used in the oven with the broiler as written, or on the grill.  We ended up throwing out the leftovers from the slow cooker though.

I can't believe I found something faster than 'pork chop in a bag' this was quick, easy, and delicious. I am a garlic lover so i added a tbsp of garlic and mmmmm this was great; juicy too. thanks alot.

My girlfriend and I used this method with a different sauce. We used 2 Tbsp Cholula hot sauce per half cup of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, brushed onto pork and broiled for 4 minutes/ side. We also flipped and brushed sauce onto chops after each 4 minute interval. Flipped and brushed 5 times for 1" chops. Chops were tender and juicy!

After reading the reviews, I decided I was just going to jump in and try is EXACTLY as it was written up.  So happy that I did.  At first I was kind of bummed that it was so thin in texture but, the taste made up for it in the end.  My advice, don't be discouraged by a taste test.  I almost ditched it because the taste by itself wasn't what I expected.  After they came out of the over (broiled) the taste with the chop was amazing!

Disappointing, but honestly it's pretty much just watered down ketchup with a tiny bit of seasoning so how great could it be?  Definitely won't make again.

Made an excellent meal for our family.  Added extra brown sugar, since our family likes sauce a little sweeter.

I've had this recipe for years.  But for some reason it didn't taste as good as I thought it would.  I will try it again and see if I still feel that way.

When the kids and adults enjoy--it's a winner.  We compared it with a Kraft sauce and prefered this one.  I used very thin pork chops, so didn't need to flip.  Delicious!

My husband said, "Wonderful dinner," and that's good enough for me.  He also recommended we try this sauce on chicken, too.  I made some changes based on others' suggestions (basically just altered according to taste).  I also used thinner pork chops, so had to cut broiling time to 3 minutes per side and really keep and eye on them.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I did what many others suggested and used 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce.  I also accidentally forgot to add the water, and the sauce was actually perfect for basting!  I grilled the chops and basted as suggested, and they were a big hit!  Will do these again.

Followed the recipe, but cooked the chops on the BBQ grill instead and slopped on plenty of sauce. A keeper.

Although my 5 year old and husband loved this, I thought it was just okay.  It wasn't sweet or tangy enough, it just tasted like water and ketchup on pork.  But, since my daughter ate the entire thing, I have to rate it at least a 3.

This is a GREAT  marinade. Not too spicy, but bountiful in flavor.  This also works great on steak and burgers. I have since added it to my permanent recipe collection.  Thank you for sharing!

Well, my kids and I really liked this recipe but my husband did not. He felt it was too dry. I will try this in my crockpot the next time to see if he would love it. I also cut the ketchup to 1/2c. and substituted the chili powder for a 1/2 t. cayenne pepper. Again, I loved it.

This is a great BBQ sauce to use on pork, chicken, or whatever.  The only change I made to the sauce was to add about 1.5 oz of bourbon and 1 beef boullion cube.  I'll be using this sauce again and again.  Thanks so much!

This recipe was very good! Although we did not broil the pork chops. ( my husband put them on the grill) but the were great! The sauce is excellent for grilling if you coat the chops in cornstarch to help the sauce stick.

So, maybe I did something wrong- but I followed the recipe exactly, and these weren't great. They were palatable, but not great. It tasted like pork chops dipped in tomato soup. I tried to thicken the sauce with some cornstarch and water, but it just made thicker tomato soup. I should have just used some BBQ sauce. It would have saved me some disappointment.

Only had 2 chops in the freezer so I scaled the recipe down.  My husband and I both really enjoyed these.  The basting sauce made them really tasty!  This will become a regular in our household.

I don't know what everyone's complaining about with this recipe ~ we LOVED it. The sauce was just the right consistency for basting and I didn't find it too "ketchupy" at all ~ and I HATE ketchup. I will definately be making this one again in the future.

I made this sauce for the first time tonight.  My husband and I both really like it. I don't like alot of overpowering sauces, so this was perfect because it's so mild. Instead of broiling the chops, I put them on the BBQ.  I'll definately make this sauce again.

I served this to my family and sister.  They liked it, but was a little disappointed.  The sauce wasn't anything special.  Next time I'll just put some bbq sauce on it rather than wasting time to make this one.

I made this recipe just as directed.  My husband and children loved it.  The pork chops stayed very moist.  Which is so important with chops.

A quick and easy way to make pork chops.  The whole family really liked this recipe.  I only had 4 boneless chops so I halved the sauce recipe, which was plenty.  Wish now I would have had more chops - they were gone in a jiffy!  The next time, I will take a previous reviewer's recommendation and use the slowcooker.  Sounds even better!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was very quick and easy.  I added 1 tsp each of onion and garlic powder to the sauce.  I didn't have any chile powder so I added some Tabasco and red pepper flakes.  It had just the right amount of spice to it.

I thought it tasted alot like barbequed pork chops.  I don't think I would make them again, it would be easier to buy a bottle of sauce, although they tasted fine, I just wouldn't do it again.

I don't often use the broiler, so this recipe was a change of pace for me.  I was very pleased with the results and will cook it again.  The sauce was a bit spicy for my tastes, but that could be attributed to the type of chili powder I used.

A great new way to cook an old favorite!
We also tried the sauce on pork ribs--they 
take longer to cook, but are very flavorful!

My family is wary of my usually tough, overcooked pork chops, but this recipe was fabulous. The sauce was extra tasty.  For once, I didn't have leftovers!

Wasn’t sure about sauce when I measured the ketchup and my nose started to complain. But, it is actually very good.Making the sauce I had no chili powder, so subbed paprika 1/4c, onion powder 1T, garlic powder 1T (was out too so did garlic salt), and 2tsp. Cumin.

Broiled on high (electric) second rack from the broiler. Used a foil lined baking dish.  8 Minutes on one side, 7 minutes on the other. The pork was brined before cooking.  And I used ah-so sauce rather than the one listed here.

Tasted great! Moist and tender. Prepared as directed with two exceptions with ingredients I had on hand . . . Apple cider instead of white vinegar and then bottled hot sauce instead of chili powder. Chops were about 3/4" thick, bone in. Overall broiled about 22-24 minutes, basting and turning as directed. Will absolutely make again.

I made this using my broiler, it was yummy. I altered the recipe by marinating my pork chops for 3 hours with iltalian dressing (wishbone), dried oregano leaves, small amount of minced garlic. After reading some comments I wanted to make sure my pork chops weren't bland. I also excluded the chili powder

Being short on time I skipped making the sauce and simply slathered the pork in bottled sauces I had on hand. Everyone found a flavor they liked.

I just needed the cooking time, made the chops perfectly.
I used oil/salt/pep on the chops instead of the sauce.

This was a very easy recipe. But I agree it tasted too ketchupy..like spaghetti o's. The sauce is a perfect base for a true BBQ sauce and the next time I make this I will be putting a texas twist on the sauce. This is the first recipe I have tried at this site and I am impressed. Thanks for the recipe.

I felt this recipe was o.k... It tasted a bit too ketchuppy, so i would reduce the amount of ketchup added. Also, I might add a bit more chili powder. I did this in a casserole dish in the oven under aluminum foil and it turned out fine.

Awesome recipe, I hate to admit it but i did make some changes though, i followed others suggestion and cut the ketchup to 1/2 C.  I also switched out the chili powder for cayenne and added some of my own seasonings like garlic salt and italien mix seasonings.  I usually can't stand pork chops, but i couldn't stop picking at my husband's plate :D  Thanks!

Very simple to make. The sauce was light and not overwhelming. We're not fans of spicy bbq pork chops anyway so this worked well for us. We will be making this again.

This recipe was so easy; got to use what I already had in the cupboard.  I did make a little (?) alteration...instead of the paprika, chili powder and salt, I used red thai curry paste (1 tsp), and threw in a little Franks Red Hot sauce for an additional kick...the sauce was delicious, and I'm not into BBQ sauce flavor.  Served it with steamed rice and steamed broccoli...not sure I'd serve it to impress, but it was rib-stickin' tasty!

My DH and I loved these pork chops! This was quick and easy to make. The pork came out so tender and we loved the sauce. We kept dipping the pork in the sauce as we ate. I served with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. I'll be making this often.

This is a fantastic recipe for pork chops.  I used an expensive sirloin chop and they turned out very tender and delicious, prepared exactly as written.  I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed broccili. What a great meal!

The recipe was good, but it wasn't the flavor we normally enjoy with pork chops.  I would even recommend it with a steak-that would be fantastic.  Good recipe, just a little too barbeque-y for me.

Okay.  It reminded me of something my grandmom would make, and that's not exactly a compliment.  If  you like meatloaf and recipes with cream of mushroom soup, you'll probably love this!

My whole family loved this!  It was not too sweet for us.  This recipe has a nice flavor and it is very quick.  I too don't fix pork chops often because they are dry but these are very tender and juicy.  I was also worring about the broiling part of the recipe.  I was afaid they would burn but they didn't.  Even my picky 3 year old loved this.  Thanks for this great recipe.

My family loved this recipe and it was so easy to make.  The turning of the boneless chops made the chops juicey.  I will cut down on the sauce next time because I served my potatoes with gravy.

I am suprised so many people enjoyed this recipe.  Whereas the pork chops did remain moist, the barbeque sauce seemed very sweet.  I will try using garlic suggested by another reviewer.  Easy to make, but with less than remarkable results.

My boyfriend absolutely loves this 'chop recipe! It's pretty easy. Although if you use thicker chops the cook time is longer, but it's well worth the wait!

Excellent - my husband loved them and called them the best chops he's ever had (and he's not normally crazy about pork)!

Very good! But use caution not to over cook.  Will dry out.  Great for a quick dinner after work.
