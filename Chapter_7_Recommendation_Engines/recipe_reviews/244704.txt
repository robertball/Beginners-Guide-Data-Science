I almost never make recipes that don't have a ton of high ratings but made this last night as I had the ingredients. I am very glad that I did. It was VERY tasty! I made extra sauce and used pecas instead of pine nuts. Even the Brussel Sprout haters loved it!

Excellent recipe!  The hardest part was cutting up the squash, might be easier to cook it whole first.  Very good flavors, the cranberries really pull it together!

Oh my. These are amazing! Using what I had on-hand, I substituted green onion for shallot and pecans for pine nuts. I also cut the oil in half. The veggies took closer to 35-40 minutes to roast for me, perhaps because of the double recipe and the reduction in oil, but it was worth it to me to cut back on the fat a bit. We loved it and I will definitely be making this again! I think it may have to go on our Christmas menu this year. Yummy!

This recipe was perfect at our Thanksgiving dinner. The only thing I did differently was to infuse the olive oil with thyme and rosemary. The wine, shallots, butter and broth make a rich sauce that make this dish special. Plus it looks gorgeous on the table.

I made as is, but I added baked chicken breast to the vegetable mixture.   A huge success for my whole family.  Kids and hubby LOVED it!!!

I didn’t follow the exact recipe I tweaked it a bit coz those were the ingredients I had, used pecans instead, and I only had raisins, but still very delicious and easy to make!

Loved this recipe! Made it exactly as listed, except I cut it in half. Used it for our Christmas dinner. It was so colorful and seriously delicious! Will absolutely make this one again for Thanksgiving.

These were excellent. They were a hit at my Thanksgiving feast. The flavor combination was delicious. One helpful hint is to cook the butter not squash in the microwave for 3 minutes so it’s easier to peel.

Love at first bite!  I tossed the veggies with some garlic salt and pepper before roasting and I was halfway through the cooking before I realized I didn't have any wine.  I ended up adding a couple tablespoons of orange cognac with a few dashes of orange bitters which worked out really nicely.  I've done roasted veggies so often with holiday meals I really loved the addition of a light creamy sauce this recipe provided.

Awesome side dish for Thanksgiving table. I added a few spinkles of dried thyme and rosemary before roasting the vegetables. The sauce is not needed.  I made it but did not use it because the veggies, cranberries and pinenuts already tasted great
