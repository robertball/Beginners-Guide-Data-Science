This was a nice rich creamy peanut buttery pudding. I did have to add another couple of tsp of corn starch as it was kinda runny with what was called for as another reviewer suggested.

I can't review this recipe on the amount of cornstarch since I got a little heavy handed with that. I will review on the amount of peanut butter. First, I'm a peanut butter lover, but even making a sandwich I spread my peanut butter on the lighter side. So I will cut the amount by half and try that next time. I do realize that the name makes reference to peanut butter twice, still thought it heavy however. Other reviewers liked the amount so maybe you would too. I do think this would make a great peanut butter frozen pop.

This pudding will definitely satisfy a peanut butter craving. It is rich and tasty. Only thing is I am not sure about the correct amount of cornstarch? I added 2 more tablespoons before it was done. However, I am now thinking 2 1/2 tablespoons, total, would have been good. I tasted it before adding extra, and it had this awesome peanut butter icecream flavor. However, I knew there was no way it would get completely thick. I then reheated it with the additional cornstarch, which completely thickened it but gave it that slightly boxed pudding taste and texture. I would have to work on the perfect amount. I used shelf stable whipping cream Trader Joes brand and Planters creamy natural peanut butter.

Just made it and it is chilling now. 
I did take the advice from other post and added 3 more teaspoons of corn starch.  Good and thick.

Simple, quick and delicious.  I use 1 cup half and half and 1 cup rice milk as it's the only kind of milk we buy. Also whisk in an egg before cooking to ensure thickening because of the rice milk. Probably not necessary. My family loves this. Its delicious!
