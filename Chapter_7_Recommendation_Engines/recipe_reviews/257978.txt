This is a great recipe to use up bits and pieces from the pantry. Todays cake mixes are 16 1/2 ounces so I added 6 tablespoons of flour to make up the difference. I didn't have the toffee chips but I did have toffee bits so I used those. I also didn't have enough white chips so I used a combo of white, semi-sweet and milk chocolate. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
