Made these early this morning for the family to wake up to.  I used a 15x11 pan and made 12 large buns.  They baked up full and with no shrinking gaps between the layers.  I have had that happen on other recipes and was so happy to see it did not happen again with this recipe!  The changes I made were to use brown sugar and omit the corn syrup and honey in the topping opting for water instead.  This made the sugar dissolve into a smooth consistency.  The buns were light and flaky and large in size.  Just like from the bakery.  I will absolutely be making these again!

Sorry cause I wanted to like this recipe. It was confusing because there was no kneading mentioned and wasn't sure if it was unintentional so I did a short, light knead before the first rise. There wasn't nearly enough topping for my liking. Was expecting some ooey-gooey treats but this recipe just didn't do it for me.

Excellent.  Based on prior reviews, I made 1 1/2 times the topping.  I also used a slightly smaller pan arrangement:  one 9x15, one 9x9.  I cut the slices about 1" thick.  They came out a bit higher than the picture shows and I was happy they did. I also let them rest in a warm oven for the 20 minutes suggested. I flipped one pan immediately, but let the other cool off for 5 min first. The cooler pan flipped better and the topping remained glazed, instead of running down into the buns. The taste is excellent.
    I just made this the 3rd time.  I retract the comment about using 1.5 times as much topping.  The buns came out  flatter than I liked, so I suggest going to two 8x8 pans and cutting the rolls 1-1.5 inches thick. Note to self: 1. make sure to cook the topping well, 2. use less butter.

I made these for my 1-3rd grade Sunday School class. They loved them. Could've used more sauce so if you want sticky, sticky buns I would recommend doubling the sauce recipe. They were delicious and disappeared in minutes. They are best straight out of the oven and they are so light and fluffy when hot, it's like eating air. AWESOME RECIPE!! =D

This is a recipe that we try and make on holidays and other family gathers.  They really are best served right out of the oven.  If you want these for breakfast, you can get everything ready the night before, keep them in the refrigerator and bake them the next morning.  They usually don't last very long!

Delicious! I halved the recipe and used my 11x7 baking pan (well sprayed w/ cooking spray), and that worked out perfectly. I did omit the raisins (may try them sometime), and subbed pecans for walnuts b/c that's what I had on hand. These baked up beautifully, and came out of the pan, no problem. I will def be making these again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Love Love Love these!  I'm into these deep... LOL  One of my all time fav's!  I also have made this with a coconut filling when I didn't have quite enough nuts. Used orange marmalade w/ coconut inside and pecans on the top, kin'da tropical and very yummy. Oh, if it sounds like too much work it's worth it... but you can just put the carmel topping ingred. into the pan under the rolls { for one less step } and it will work just fine.

I made these, but used Pillsbury Grand cinnamon
rolls instead of making them. I doubled the topping recipe, but I did use too many raisins. Will remember that for the next time. The Grand rolls were a bit large, also. May use smaller ones next time, but they were VERY gooey, and tasty. Baked them at 350 for about 25 minutes per the Pillsbury times. Came out good.

I loved this recipe!! I'm a young and learning baker, and this recipe was a great challenge! My family loved it…and the buns didn't last on the counter very long! I would totally recommend this to any young baker looking for a little bit of a challenge!
