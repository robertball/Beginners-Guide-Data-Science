Amazing taste! Very easy to make aside from the 8-11 minutes it takes to beat the eggs(with an electric beater). Well worth the wait.

Great for a chocolate fix.  The second time, I substituted Splenda for the sugar and spray butter for regular butter and they came out just as delicious.  I also didn't beat the eggs for 8 minutes either time...don't know what sort of difference that makes.

This cake is great!  I bake it in oven safe mugs.  When you pull it out of the oven, top it with marshmallows.  Yum!

Looks and taste great - and oh so easy - I served this for a holiday meal last year and am fixing it again this year - I think it is going to be a tradition!

These were really spectacular.  My guests were impressed.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips (what I had on hand).  I did have to bake about 3 minutes longer than instructed which is unusual for my gas oven but they turned out perfect with that gorgeous oozing center.  I served with powdered sugar and a scoop of strawberry ice cream.  The cakes aren't overly sweet but they are rich.  I will make these again and again.
