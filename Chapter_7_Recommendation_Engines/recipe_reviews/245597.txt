My son loves baked brie but I had never made one before. I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients. I had a small 200 gram double cream brie so I halved the recipe. I did not trim the puff pastry but folded it over the top nicely instead. I baked mine for 30 minutes because the puff pastry did not seem browned enough after 20 minutes. I served it with red and green grapes, apple and pear slices and crackers. It was a hit at our neighbourhood open house we hosted.

So easy, and so good. This makes an impression! I substituted Seville orange preserves with craisins. It was fabulous with a nice Chardonnay. This will be our go-to recipe for party appetizers!

This was a big hit!  I didn't have apricot jam.  I used peach with chopped pecans and it was a great combination with the brie cheese.  This is going into my party/appetizer favorites.
