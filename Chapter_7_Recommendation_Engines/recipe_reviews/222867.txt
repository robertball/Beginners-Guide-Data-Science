Very good!  I used 3 medium red potatoes and a small green pepper instead of the chile peppers.  This was so easy and a quick meal for dinner.  I have a little leftover to take for lunch tomorrow.  A friend suggested adding  some chopped garden tomatoes, I may try that next time.  Thanks for sharing, redly!!

This stew was very good.  I used Mexican Grey Squash which is very similar to Zucchini.  I didn't peel the squash or potatoes because I like the skins.  Also I didn't have the beef bouillon so instead of that and water I used a box of beef stock.  And I would really recommend the Worcestershire sauce it makes it better in fact next time I will probably add more.

These were okay.  It could use some seasonings and garlic to it and I think I would've like it better with mild italian sausages. I didn't want to make this stew spicy (kid) so I seeded the anaheims.

I've made this recipe and my family loves it! We add a little spicy sausage along with the hamburger. We also add some different colored zucchini with different kinds of  potatoes. Some of the family even use it as a topping over rice. This is one of those recipes that you can play around with and it is still as good, especially on a cold winter night!

Loved this easy recipe.  I did cook mine in the crockpot so it would be ready when I got home from work.  My husband and daughter loved it.  The did spice theirs up more.  My husband asked that next time I add in stewed tomatoes and I think I will also add in diced carrots.  Will let you know how that works out.

Sorry, but I did not like this recipe.  It tasted like peppery-water as far as I was concerned.
