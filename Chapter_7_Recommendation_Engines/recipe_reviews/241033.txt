This was pretty good. As promised, the steak turned out juicy and slightly sweet, but the vinegar gave it a nice counter point. I cut back on the hot sauce because my wife can detect a single peppercorn waved over a vat of food. I wish I hadn't. A teaspoon of Sriracha wasn't even detectable. Go for the full tablespoon. A teaspoon of red pepper flakes might have been good too. I tried reducing the marinade to use it for a finishing sauce, but the vinegar really comes through. I had to be very sparing with it, but it was still tasty.
