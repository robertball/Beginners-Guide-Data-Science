I found this recipe by doing the ingredient search for spinach and cherry tomatoes, since I had both to use up. Very tasty frittata and so easy to make. I made it exactly like the recipe, except there's one oversight in the instructions: It never mentions to add the chorizo back in. Be sure to stir it in with the egg/milk/cheese mixture before putting the frittata in the oven.

It's a miracle... my son will NOT eat tomatoes if it isn't in salsa or ketchup but he ate this!!! Two pieces in fact!!! Everyone else loved it too!
I doubled the recipe because my chorizo was a half a pound package, so I cooked it in a 9x13 dish for 28 minutes. Worked fine.
I have to admit, it tells you to cook the veggies in the dripping but I just can't let that much grease go into my families stomachs ,so I drained as much as I could from the skillet, put the chorizo on a few paper towel so they would soak most of it up and left only, maybe, a teaspoon of the drippings in there to cook the veggies in. It tasted great and I felt much better getting rid of all that fat. I also have to say I didn't use KRAFT cheese, I used the brand that I had.
I will make this again because it resembles a dish my hubby always gets at Mexican restaurants.

Wanted to try beef chorizo and found this nice surprise!  And easy too.  I used Roma tomatoes and sliced in large pieces.  Didn't have the pepper jack cheese so used shredded cheddar.

I needed something new to do other than cooking chorizo and scrambled eggs for MY personal well being.  This recipe does everything I needed.  It looks extremely versatile.  You could do anything with your essentially 1C wilted spinach (I recommend chopping your spinach before cooking for easier slicing!!!) and 2C chopped tomatoes.  Use bell peppers/white onion (rinsed of course!)/serranos/tomatoes.  Someone suggested mushrooms.  You could do other greens besides spinach and you could change cheeses to cheddar or any of the lovely Mexican cheeses (in the round, you know the ones!).  Even more fun, you could use Soyrizo instead of the meat kind.  You could also flip this to use 8 oz of bacon, 8 oz of sage or farmer's sausage, ground and cooked.  Use your imagination.  This is a fantastic recipe.

I would only suggest leaving it in a bit longer than 25 unless you like a softer scramble.  If you like scrambled medium or hard, I suggest ADDING 3-5 cooking time---or just turning off the oven and then setting the table---making sure the edges of the egg do not burn (I used a clear pyrex dish so I could visually check).  Overcooking the edges of this dish would just ruin it.

I have to say my family did not like this recipe as much as they would have liked plain chorizo/eggs/tortillas--oh well.  I consider this a classier, more subtle, more festive dish.  Perfect for parties.  Also I sliced it in 6ths, but you could try 8ths or even 12ths for a potluck.  It is quite filling!

Tasty tasty! I didn't have any tomatoes, so I used some diced red pepper and I added some mushrooms I had lying around. I also halved the cheese, because it didn't seem to need that much. Will definitely make this again!

My family inhaled this & left spinning empty plates in their wake. I didn't change anything the first time I made it, except to cook it on top of the stove. Too hot for the oven to be on! The next time,  when it was just firm, I spread a can of El Pato over the top, crumbled some cotija and shredded pepper jack over that and ran it under the broiler for a few minutes. Amazing! It tastes great at room temperature, too. We often have this for dinner.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did add about a half of a vidalia onion,fresh sliced mushrooms, double the chorizo (because I really like it) and shredded my own pepper jack but other than that I followed the recipe.  Highly recommend.

One addition. I have found I prefer not halving the tomatoes. Some will burst during cooking anyway but leaving them whole seems to give it a better texture cutting out the "soupy" spots it's a little more attractive final product.

What a simple, yet wonderful recipe - turned out great! I happen to have some button mushrooms on hand as well as some cilantro - I added those to it as well. I did use 7 eggs instead and prolly a little more cheese. This one is a keeper!

This is a great and simple recipe. The only thing I changed was I used veggie chorizo and it came out great.

I’ve doubled this and made it in a 13x9 pan for the week several weeks in a row.  It’s so good!!   I use fresh spinach and only a fiesta blend for cheese.  I just put the cheese in the egg mix and bake it all

I modify this a bit, but love the basic recipe.  Instead of green onion and tomatoes, I add chopped onion and bell pepper.  I also double the recipe and cook it in muffin pans - perfect portions to keep in the freezer, easy microwave breakfast!

Taste wise I added so,e spicy garlic powder and used retried beans as a layer over the meat mixture to help my cornbread stay on top. Also added a can of Rico’s premium cheddar to my cornbread mix (I love cheese). Turned out great.

I made this per the recipe and it was great. The flavor was 5 star as was the ease of reheating for breakfast.  Everybody liked it.  I will definitely make this again, A+ for a low carb breakfast.

Made for a large family gathering and every person wanted the recipe! Only change was to use drained, frozen spinach instead of fresh, and turkey sausage instead of chorizo to reduce fat. I did have to bake it about 15 minutes longer than recipe called for.

I added bell pepper and mushrooms just because I love them.  However, you forgot to tell us to add back in the reserved chorizo.  Also, if you don't have chorizo, you can do this with bacon.

I have made this several times and no matter the age range, they all seem to really enjoy this.  For fun, we have been putting this into muffin cups and taking it with us to tailgate events even.  Warm with a nice little spicy kick seems perfect then.

This recipe turned out great and was super easy! It doesn't indicate what to do with the chorizo after taking it out - so I just left it in cook with the spinach.  Yum!

Yay for veggies for breakfast!  Double that because it was yummy and didn't require making pie crust.
This went over very well even with people who aren't really fans of cooked tomatoes.
My only issue was that I had to put it back in for quite a bit longer before it was ready but since I was overly generous on the cheese, used a different type of tomato , used regular spinach instead of baby and eyeballed most of the measurements I'm not going to blame the recipe.

I made this with a couple changes and it was delicious! I didn't have green onions, so I omitted. Used diced fresh tomato instead of cherry tomatoes. Also, I added black beans because, why not. It is sooo delicious and surprisingly filling. WIll definitely be making this again and exploring ways to modify it to fit with what we have in the house.
