Mix was okay, but be careful the time of year you decide to use it.  The chocolate chips melted easily even in fall weather, so I wouldn't use in the summer for sure!

I needed a snack for my child's class.  This did the trick.  I substituted the chocholate morsels with M&M's (less messy.)  I also added pretzels to the mix.  It made enough for 20 children in a plastic sandwich bag.  Good Stuff!

This sounds a lot like Trail-Mix, but with a twist for kids. my best friend and I made it when she came over (were in Middle School) and it was easy, and since it involved no cooking (the power was out) it was great. We changed the recipe up but we made it to sweet.

My girls liked it okay but they eat a lot more variety of food than my son does. It needed to be a lot more colorful for him to want it. I changed the ingredients to apple jacks, teddy grahams, marshmellows, m&m's, & multi-colored goldfish and he ate it right up!

Easy as pie.  The adults ate just as much (if not more) than the kids.  I used M&M's instead of chocolate chips.  It was more colorful.

The kids loved this and were able to make it with minimal help from me.  I love these simple but tasty treats to get them involved in the kitchen.  Lots of variations can be made with this.  It does taste a lot like s'mores.  I would be careful on storing it as our got soggy from the marshmallows, we will make it to eat right away instead.  Thanks!

This was super easy to throw together. I mixed everything together and put it in 2 gallon size bags. The kids love it for an after school snack. I think I will try mixing some and putting it in goodie bags for my sons birthday party next month. It would be so easy to vary the ingredients for another flavor creation.

Excellent flavor and easy to make. The only problem I noticed was that the cereal & teddy bear grahams got soft overnight.

Just made this for my babysitting kids and asked THEM how many stars they'd give this and the said 5! So 5 it is. I did make some changes though... I had very limited resources. I used rice crispies instead of cherrios, popcorn instead of chex mix, and I didn't use the animal cookies. But the kids lived it, therefore, I loved it!!!!
