I had fennel that I didn't know what to do with. This salad was perfect as I also had avocado that needed to be used. It has very simple to make and the nutmeg paired very well with it. I did find it needed some sort of acid to bring out flavours so I ended up adding the juice of half a lemon and found it perfect. I'd make this again mostly because of the simplicity of the dish.

Fresh and tasty combination of flavors.  I liked it as written in the recipe.  But I also made it with adding an orange, a little bit of purple onion, and a splash of red wine vinegar.  I'll put this one into the rotation as it is super tasty and very healthy!

Simple and easy, this salad is perfect for a last minute addition to your table. I didn't think I would like soft avocado and crunchy fennel, but it works.If you don't like the anise flavor of fennel, like me, you will still like this salad. The nutmeg and the flavor of the avocado seem to tame it a bit. Thank you for the recipe.
