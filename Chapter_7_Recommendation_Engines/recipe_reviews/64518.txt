This was OK.  I probably won't make again.  If you do make this, I would add less soy sauce.  It was overpowering.

Very easy and delicious - restaurant quality salad.  I added pecans for a little extra flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe. I added some sliced deli chicken and romain lettuce in addition to the mixed greens. Makes a nice low-carb meal. Thanks!

I thought the flavors went very well together.I love the way the smoked gouda tasted in the salad.
A little to much dressing,the salad was drowning.

Very tasty and juicy. The gouda taste blends nicely with the dressing. I would recommend to put a hint of garlic. Enjoy

This salad made for a nice dinner on a "too hot to cook" night.  My changes were to skip the soy sauce (personal preference), and to heat up some Louis Rich chicken breast strips and serve them on top of the salad to make it more of a meal.  Add your favorite bread and you have a yummy dinner!

I served this salad to guests and it was a big hit.  I arranged the greens with the Gouda and tomatoes on top and drizzled the dressing over top to avoid drowning the salad.

I made this as part of an elegant supper for several friends. It was _raved_ over. Very good. Had I a restaurant, this would probably be the House salad.

What a BEAUTIFUL salad!!  It's a little "bitey"....you will love this if you like balsamic vinegar.  I used cherry tomatoes and cut them in half instead of cutting up a regular tomato (I don't like how mushy and watery chopped up tomato gets).  Other than that, I made no other changes.

Yum!! We made this for dinner last night, ate it all (a meal for two), & all day today I've been dying for more. I began making the dressing with half the soy sauce the recipe called for. I was very happy with the taste didn't add the rest. We added walnuts, which worked very well, & I want to add avocado next time too.

A little too salty.  Had to add extra olive oil.

Great idea, but the recipe calls for WAY too much salad dressing, and I don't see how 2 tomatoes can suffice for six servings. Like others, I would also cut back on the soy sauce - it dominates the other flavors.

this was really good! i love cheese in salads, so i was very grateful for this recipe. i added less soy sauce, just because i don't care for it as much, i probably would have made less dressing overall, as well.

I thought the vinaigrette was very good.  I totally forgot to put in the Gouda cheese before taking the picture - it was delicious with and without.

I made the vinaigrette for my guests to add to their own salad since many said there was too much.   I also added onion, green pepper, mushrooms, carrots, and roast turkey breast to make it a meal. Rave reviews!
