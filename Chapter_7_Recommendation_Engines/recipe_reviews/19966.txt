This recipe looks very inviting & tastes great. I only had 2 issues with it. The first: the cilantro seemed to overpower the salsa. Keep in mind that I am not a cilantro fan but I still think that the hot peppers would have been sufficient. The second, sea scallops tend to be pretty thick & the cooking method overcooked the outside while not cooking the inside well enough for me. Next time, I will skip the cilantro alltogether & bake the scallops for a few minutes before pan frying the outside.  All in all, a good recipe.

I used the little bay scallops because I was topping a salad w/ this recipe. I made the salsa as the recipe states, except for adding just a tbp or so of mango vinegar ( a recipe from foodnetwork) but I made a few changes w/ the scallops. I used olive oil w/ just a bit of butter to saute them in but first I added big slivers of garlic & let them cook for a few minutes to infuse the oil. Then I removed the garlic & added the bay scallops. I hit the scallops w/ Old Bay & chopped basil while cooking  & then sprinkled them w/ lemon juice after I removed them from the pan. I plated a bed of romaine, drizzled it w/ the mango vinegar, added quite a bit of the salsa & topped it w/ the scallops, adding a few sliced cukes for interest. Hubby was very skeptical of this salad but had to concede that the flavor combo was superb. *rubbing my fingers on my chest in an arrogant fashion* LOL But next time he wants me to add a bit of mayo to the mango vinegar to make it more of a substantial dressing....I will for his, I thought mine was just perfect! Served this w/ a glass of white zin & for dessert, cherry limeade sorbet, drizzled w/ homemade cherry vodka & topped w/ a couple of frosted grapes. What a wonderful, light & healthy meal for a hot, summer evening...thansk for your contribution Robin!

Absolutely delicious.  We served this with rice.  I added mandarin oranges, lemon juice, canned pineapple and a bit of the juice from the pineapples to make the salsa.  I also used a green pepper and thinly sliced green onions in the salsa.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow...this was an AMAZING dish!  The only thing that I would maybe do a little different would be to add a little less cilantro. (I personally don't care for the taste of it)  Other than that, the salsa truly was very impressive looking and tasted really great on the scallops.  Very cool if you are looking for a recipe for a dinner party or a romantic dinner for two!  Definitely a keeper!:)

Hubs and I frequent a lot of restaurants in Southwest Florida where dishes like this are routinely served. This is as good or better as we've had in any of them. I dredged the scallops lightly in flour before sauteeing them and backed off on the cilantro to about one  tablespoon, which was plenty.  I served  this on plates garnished with a spicy remoulade sauce and a lemon garlic aioli alongside a basic, parsley rice. It was simply wonderful.  Colorful, fresh and delicious. I'm looking forward to having the leftover salsa with crab cakes tomorrow night!

Family wasn't too sure about this dish when they first saw it but thoroughly enjoyed it.  I served it with rice and doubled the amount of salsa and it was all eaten.  Will make it again.

The salsa was really good.  The scallops  needed to be cooked longer than 2 minutes on each side, but I used an indoor grill set at about 390 degrees. It was more like 6-8 minutes on each side. The scallops were large ones from Sams club. I thought they tasted kinda bland ...could have used a little more seasoning for my taste.

This was excellent. For those that had a problem with the scallops, be sure to dry them well. So pat dry before cooking. Let them rest on a towel for about 10 minutes while you are prepping the salsa.
Large Sea Scallops will take anywhere from 2+1/2 to 4 min. on the first side and 2 to 4 min. on the second side. Scallops should still be very soft in the middle and opaque and firm on the outside. Over-cooking them will make them tough and chewy.

Absolutely amazing!  I would suggest adding mandarin oranges, a bit more jalapenos (to up the kick), chili powder and ginger powder.

Excellent!  It was just what I was looking for.  The salsa is similar to one that I was trying to duplicate from a local restaurant and it was perfect!  My only change was to add a tablespoon of honey because the fresh pineapple I had wasn't very sweet.  Regarding the scallops - I always soak in milk while I prep the rest of my dinner.  It helps remove any fishy taste.  (Make sure they are dry when you put into the pan or they will splatter.)  You need to heat a fry pan on high heat and sear the scallops for about 3-4 min per side depending on how rare you like your seafood.  (2 min isn't enough for me.)  By cooking on high heat, you get a golden almost caramelized exterior with a nice soft interior.    I made jasmine rice and served with the scallops  and a large spoonful of the salsa.  My husband went back for seconds and even my picky kids liked it.  A keeper for sure!  Thank you!

This was good, but not as amazing as I expected.  The salsa would have been better with more fruit and less bell pepper...but maybe I didn't measure well. The cilantro was fine for me--a cilantro lover. I grilled the scallops, but should have marinated them in juice first. Everyone cleaned their plates though!  Good recipe that needs to be altered to individual tastes.

I recently used this salsa recipe to serve at my daughters wedding reception.  It was absolutely excellent.  Several people requested the recipe.  The flavors all blend together so well and it is light, fruity and  spicy.  I actually added an extra jalapeno for more heat.

Really good!  Maybe a little cilantro but it was great the way it was too.  We served it with a Asian Thai Cucumber salad and the combination was very good.

The Mango Salsa was excellent.  I seared the Scallops in a small amount of butter.  It definitely took longer than 2 minutes per side.  I did add extra lime juice and mango to the salsa.

This one will impress!  Great colors - great presentation!  Great taste too!  I like jalapeno's, but that could be left out if your diners are kids or don't like them.  I'm going to make a big batch of the salsa and use it with less expensive fish like tilapia or cod or something and serve it to a big family group.

I have fixed this recipe several times over the past year or so.  We really enjoy it.  I have prepared it exactly as written, and have also changed it up from time to time.  This evening I made a variation that was probably our favorite so far.  

I didn't have scallops, so I used shrimp instead.  I sautéd the shrimp in a little bit of olive oil and finished them off with a few sprinkles of balsamic vinegar.  For the salsa, I replaced the red pepper with diced peppadew peppers.  Holy cow!  The peppadews add so much flavor...it was wonderful.

Living on an island, with access to some fresh, tasty seafood, I am always looking for new ways to prepare fish and shellfish.  This tropical salsa recipe was AMAZING as is.  I especially loved all the cilantro.  It was a big hit with DH as well, and I'll be making this again soon.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is so good I have walked away from the table to review it. WOW~! I added a bit of powdered ginger, reduced the cilantro, and added fresh basil to the salsa. I served it over whole wheat couscous, with a tossed green salad. I better get back before my family eats it all!

This is a great recipe for scallops!! Simple and delicious. Sweet and mildly spicy salsa over succulent scallops!! Yum Yum. Make sure you allow the salsa flavours to blend together for at least 1 hour before serving.

I loved this recipe, and it is perfect for summer.  I did not have cilantro so I made the salsa without it and it still came out delicious.  My husband and baby loved it, my 4 year old did not and I was surprised since he will eat shrimp.

The salsa had a bit too much kick for me. Next time, I'll use just half a jalapeno. Still very tasty, though, and I'm planning to add little more of everything else to the leftovers to have with grilled tilapia.

I read the other reviews so was prepared to cook the scallops longer than suggested or pre-bake. I opted to cook longer on the stove. I discover the prefer to grill scallops and will do that in the future.

This was an excellent recipe. I loved the simplicity of the scallops. They were very flavorful with just simple salt & pepper - I highly recommend preparing them as indicated in the recipe. The searing method works best with the small-sized scallops, as larger scallops will not cook through.  Like most people, I did modify the recipe to utilize ingredients I had on hand. I used 2 red chilies instead of 1 jalepeno and mixed yellow, orange and red bell peppers to make up the necessary 1/2 cup. I also used extra virgin olive oil to sear the scallops. The extra Chili pepper gave it a little bite, which went really well with a nice Gewürztraminer. It was even better after the salsa had sat over night. I will add that the prep time took a little longer, but that's because I chopped everything by hand with a knife.

The salsa was a great compliment to the scallops. I didn't add the cucumber or jalapeno to the salsa and used orange bell pepper instead of red. Turned out great!! Thanks Robin!! :)

This was a great treat!  The salsa is too die for.  I didn't do such a good job on making the scallops but know better next time.  I would definitely recommend this one!

Made this 2 weeks ago and it was a big hit.  Didn't have the cucumber so I added some red onion for extra color/flavor.  Only other change I made was to grill the scallops on my George Foreman grill - no oil or spray - good scallops don't need it!  Came out perfect!  Will try same recipe with some fresh shrimp tonight.  This salsa is the greatest!  Thank you for the recipe.

I don't like Scallops, but I made this for a friend and she loved them. The salsa is very good. I will be using it for other items.

I used this recipe as a party dish. There was plenty to go around. I added some crab meat to the dish and tossed in some red surf clams and everyone loved it. My buddy is allergic to peppers, so we didn't add any, but the recipe is great without it. The salsa taste great and tasted even better on top of homemade crab cakes. I used large sea scallops which I cut in halves, lightly covered in flour (with a lot of old bay) and seared them. I used some white fruity wine to deglaze the pan, mixed in the salsa and red clams to infuse all the flavors and poured it on top of the scallop and crab. Sprinkle some cilantro on top and served it with crackers and toasted breads. This recipe is a great way to impress your friends and to entertain with.  The salsa is great for any seafood.

This was fabulous! I used the smaller scallops, as that was all that was available; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely be making this one again! As other reviewers noted, this salsa would be great on many other meat or fish.

We made this for a company dinner and got rave reviews.  We followed the suggestion to bake the scallops before searing them: a very good suggestion.  I will definitely make this again.

These were absolutely fantastic following the recipe and only substituting fresh peaches for the pineapple as that was what we had on hand. Served it up with some maple glazed roasted brussel sprouts and a light side salad. Definitely will do again.

exceptional! I purchased frozen sea scallops and rinsed them and patted dry on paper towels , covered with paper towels and back in the refrigerator. I used much less butter and a small amount of olive oil to sear the scallops with fresh minced garlic. very nice. BUT, the holy smokes moment was the salsa/salad! I used canned pineapple chunks, diced mango, fresh peach, blackberries, lime ZEST and juice and cilantro with some pineapple juice with a little cilantro, seeded jalapeno and red bell pepper. I served the scallops, salsa/salad with jasmine rice. wow!

Yum!! Such a delicious summer meal. The mango salsa compliments the scallops so well. I only added some avocado as well as red onion. Perfect combo! Will have this again.

OMG this is the best!!! I seared 8 XL scallops on a Himalayan salt block at high heat (no salt needed). Mods to the receipt: backed off the Dijon by a tablespoon (overtook the vinaigrette). Replaced the oranges with a bed of sautéed tomatoes and replaced the rice vinegar with white wine. My dinner party LOVED it.

I didn't have mango so I used extra pineapple. I would not recommend making without this without the mango I think it would have made a big difference. Without the mango component, I found the peppers a little overpowering. I still enjoyed this dish though.

I followed this recipe to a tee and it was absolutely fabulous. I served it over a bed of arugula and baby spinach with a side of roasted asparagus. I highly recommend serving these scallops over some sort of leafy green because it not only adds to the beautiful presentation, but also provides a necessary texture dimension. Also, I cooked my scallops in a cast iron pan with great results - I don't think I would have achieved the caramelized sear (without being overcooked) in a regular nonstick pan.
