YUMMM!! I just took a taste as it is cooking right now... It smells SO good, I think my hubby will come home and be very pleased. I gave this 4 stars since I had to add more seasonings and also added beef base to the gravy. You know us people from the deep south love flavor... lol.. It's a keeper! Thank you for sharing your recipe, Terry.

This is just the way my grandmother and mom make it.  I omit the cayenne pepper because my family doesn't like it spicy.  I don't always remember to put in the cornstarch and it's great either way.  Thanks!

This was my 1st attepmt at trying coutnry fried steak and it was so nervous this is an easy recipe to follow and my husband barely left any for the rest of us.  But the true test was my 3 year old daughter who hates everything I had to bribe her to eat it and after she did she asked for more thats when I knew I had a keeper.  The only change I made was using buttermilk to coat my steaks may sound strange but adds great tenderness.  Good Recipe!!!!!

Holy crapola! My hubby and I absolutely love this!! For us the steaks came out a bit tough but I believe that'd be our fault. Other than that mistake it was so delicious!!! So much flavor in the meat, the gravy is to die for, and I swear there can just never be enough onions!! Thank you for sharing this very yummy recipe!! Will do again and again!

Used left over prime rib...poked with a meat tenderizer used egg milk wash and left out cayenne. I also used a deep fryer. The gravy I used 1% milk and a little whipping cream, OMG Delicious gravy.

Absolutely delicious! Didn't have onion powder though. Also doubled the cayenne but it didn't make it spicy. I love spicy so next time I'll triple or quadruple it. :) Didn't have milk. Used heavy whipping cream. Also, I only cooked the meat on each side for about two minutes instead of four. Came out very tender. Oh and I actually used venison because it's what I had on hand. Would recomend to anyone!

I have always wanted to try to make country fried steak but never got around to it. I decided to try this recipe and I was not disappointed. I don't think I will ever eat country fried steak at a restaurant ever again! I will make this recipe at home again and again!

Made this tonight for my family and we absolutely loved it!  My husband and I were a little skeptical about the amount of onions at first but three onions was perfect.  Easy to make. Thanks.

Amazing and very easy to make. I substituted half of the milk with cream. And, I coated with the flour mixture, then dredged in beaten egg, and coated with the flour mixture again before frying. I will absolutely be making this again.

I am giving this five stars because of the review my husband gave it - I personally would give it four stars only because such a sweet gravy is not for me - Don't doubt the large amount of onions you slice, they will cook down and turn out ok

I cooked recipe like it said and the steaks came out rubbery and a little tough.  The gravy rocks though.  I have never had a recipe with cube steaks where they weren't tough.  I may make the gravy again, but not the cube steaks.  Might be good with chicken breasts.

I made this recipe tonight and it worked out great. Really easy to put together and the gravy was great with the sides I made. Add the cayenne pepper, you cant tell it's in there, it just gives the whole thing more flavor. The gravy was really easy to make, I'll be making this again for sure.

I've been cooking for 3+ years and this is the best country fried steak recipe I've ever come across.  The changes I made were to delete the cayenne, and for the milk I used 1/2 cup whipping cream and 1/2 cup low-fat milk.  The gravy was the best I have ever made.  I will use the gravy recipe for other beef dishes I make as well.  I rarely fry, because I do not like the grease, however this recipe was not greasy in the least.  Thanks for a terriffic recipe Terry!.

Just made this for Sunday dinner....and it was delicious! :) I wanted something different to make, picked this recipe and so glad I did! I thought it would be too "oniony", but definitely was not. Very easy to make as well as the meat and onions were extremely tender. I will be making this the next time the in-laws come over! :)

Excellent recipe! The only thing I did different is I used hamburger patties instead of cube steak. It makes a perfect country fried steak every time and it makes the cooking time a lot shorter. Thanks again for this recipe. This will be how I make my gravy every time!

I made this for my husband and I, and we both loved it!  The sweet onion gravy was delicious!  The only change that I made was to lightly beat 2 eggs, and in breading the cube steaks, dredged in the flour mixture, then the eggs, then the flour mixture again.  My coating did not come off of my cube steaks after simmering in the gravy, as one of the other reviews stated.  Could be because of the change I made in coating my steaks, or just the fact that you really need to dredge the steaks and get the flour into your steaks.  I will definitely use this recipe again as my go-to country fried steak recipe!

This is a good recipe. I made a few changes to it but not much. First of all, I adjusted the recipe for 6 serving and used 6 top blade steaks (that I pounded out). Then I seasoned the meat on both sides with a little garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne and salt before dredging in the flour mixture. I didn't have sweet onions, so I used 3 large yellow onions instead. Because I adjusted the servings I reserved a 1/2 cup of flour mixture instead of 1/3 cup. Followed the recipe as stated from the flouring to the return of the steaks to the gravy. Because the meat was almost done, I only simmered in the gravy for about 20 minutes. The gravy was a little bland so I added a few extra shakes of salt to it. Turned out great! I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipie tasted more like a mixture of salsbury steak and stroganoff. Won't be using again for country fried steak. Great taste though.

I have made this twice with venison cube steak. Really a very good way to cook venison. If this is this good with venison, you who use beef will be really delighted.  As normal, prep time is more than the recipe calls for. It takes me an hour and 45 minutes to do this well.

Easy, but somewhat bland. I seasoned the meat, dredged in plain flour, and added flour & cornstarch to the onions. Maybe only add 1 T of cornstarch, as the gravy was very thick. Also, add a browning agent (Gravy Master).

Next time I make this I will beat out the meat so it won't burn so much. Otherwise it was delicious. Oh and I also added Johnny's Garlic seasoning.

I have been looking for a coating with a lot of flavor - this is a keeper.  The coating leaves a sweet after taste so will cut back on the onion powder next time.  Did put in extra black pepper and the cayenne was not extremely noticeable.  Fried in canola oil on low-medium heat, turned out very tender.  Will try the gravy with it next time.  Thanks Terry!

This was a very tasty recipe!! I changed only a couple of things. I only used one extremely large onion vs. three. I added a jar of mushrooms and a few red pepper flakes.  I also added just a dash of kitchen bouquet for flavor. Otherwise, the meat was as tender as could be and gravy was delicious!! Try it, you will love it!!

My new favorite recipe! Made it twice-once as written and a second time with sliced bell pepper added to it. Wonderful!
Thanks for sharing.

This is a really nice flavored country fried steak.  My husband is a meat and potatoes man and he thought it was tender and nicely seasoned, not too spicy.  I was short on time and only had one large onion and it tasted very good. The four star rating is because I thought it might be a bit more tender but i'm super picky about my steak.  Try it you'll like it!

My fiancé loved this. I thought it was going to taste like the country fried steak from Texas Roadhouse or Perkins but it didn't at all. That's what I was going for. It was still delicious though!

This is a great recipe. I use 1-2 onions and put a beef bouillon cube in the gravy.  Instead of simmering on top of the stove, put meat and gravy in a covered pan in the oven for 45 minutes at 350 degrees. If I don't have beef stock on hand, use a packet of Au Jus Mix.  Keep the flour/spices in a ziplock bag it's handy. I did use cayenne pepper. Thanks for sharing!

The steaks had no flavor, the gravy was good but I had to add some extra spices to it. Just kind of bland.

The gravy was tasty but I don't understand why we browned and fried the steaks in the first place if we are going to submerge them in the gravy later. The coating came off the steaks when it was simmering in the gravy... I think it would be better if the steaks were fried and cooked separately from the gravy.

I would have liked the steaks a little more tender, but otherwise this was delicious!
