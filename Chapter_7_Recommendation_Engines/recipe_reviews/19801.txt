This is really wonderful...I didn't change the ingredients at all.  However, I didn't let the crust cool before topping with the filling mixture (just put it on right after taking crust out of the oven & popped it back in the oven); and, although the recipe doesn't specify, you should always put a meringue on top of the filling when it's hot and spread it til it touches the sides of the pan to prevent it from "shrinking" while cooling.

Excellent dessert!!  I spent the day at my mothers house on Friday helping her bake. (My brothers new girlfriend was flying in and staying for a few days!) Mom has loads of frozen rhubarb in her freezer from last summer that needs to be used up so I thought I'd put a dent in it with this recipe. Wow, was it ever a hit...even with non rhubarb lovers!!  One thing I would suggest though concerns the method of making the "custard".  Instead of mixing the egg yolks with the flour, mix them first with the sugar, than the milk, than beat in the flour. If you mix the ingredients in the order described in the method you will end up with hard little pieces of egg/flour, making your custard mixture grainy.Just thought I'd offer a hint!! To all of you who have a rhubarb patch and are always on the hunt for new rhubarb recipes...you've just gotta try this one!!! Thanks a bunch Patty!

This was very good (I agree with the other reviewer about the order of mixing).  I ground two tablespoons of flax seeds in my coffee grinder and added them to the crust mixture for a wonderful nutty flavour (and a bit of added fiber..sneaky nutrition).  Other than that, I made no other tweaks.  The custard was firm enough to slice but velvety soft in the mouth.  The meringue was a nice touch and looked very pretty (make sure filling is hot when you spread on egg white mixture..helps avoid making custard wet).  And the preparation in a 9x13 dish served a lot of people with little trouble.  Best the day it is made (crust got a bit soggy overnight).  I will definitely make again when I need a dessert for a crowd!

I made this to take to a large dinner. It got rave reviews. The only thing I did different was to subsitute Splenda for the sugar. I used about 1/2 of the recommended amount and it was perfect.

Although this might be a good recipe to some, we didn't care for it.  It was much, much to sweet.  We didn't eat the whole thing.  I like the idea of the tort so I'm going to try again and use less sugar, maybe add strawberries too.  I'm not giving up on it :)

After offering to make a dessert for a dinner party last week, I had tons of rhubarb in the garden so I chose this one.  I can't tell you all the mishaps I had making this. First I didn't realize how much 8 cups of rhubarb was so I had to keep sending my son up and down the garden to get more. Then, I have a fan assisted oven and thought I overbaked it at every stage. I honestly wasn't going to bring it. To top it all off it fell over in the car on the way there.  I begged my sis in law not to serve it until someone brave tasted it, but there it was on the dessert table next to all the fancy tarts and chocolates.  Do you know everyone was bugging me for the recipe?!  I think any dessert that can take that much abuse and still taste so good deserves 5 stars!

I have made this recipe many times and always receive high praise for it.   I have substituted sour cream for the milk, it was wonderful, made it even more interesting and richer.

Excellent recipe.  I wasn't sure about the meringue, but the whole combination of crust, custard and meringue is perfect. I added strawberries and it was delicious.  Will definitely use again and again.

My grandmother made this dish and I always loved it. My favorite way to have rhubarb. I was very easily able to cut this in half and fit it into a pie dish.

this gets a 4 star rating because the quanties are simply too large for a 9x13 pan. next time I make this I will use only 4 eggs and cut down the milk used to 2/3 cup.otherwise it is a very tasty dessert. (or use a larger pan, like a lasagna pan for example.)

This was my first rhubarb recipe, and it was pretty good! However, I didn't like the topping, and instead would suggest using whipped cream. The pie itself was definitely good, though. For a more traditional pie taste for those who may have never had rhubarb before, add a little more sugar to the recipe and vanilla extract.

My sister-in-law has an awesome tort recipe, but she wasn't home for me to get it, so found this one.  It is just as good as my sister-in-laws, if not better.  Shhhh don't tell her.   This was very good. Thanks for sharing.

This was not that great the night that I made it, when it was still warm.  I was worried that I would just end up throwing out a huge pan full of dessert.  Fortunately this morning I pulled it out of the fridge (where I stored it wrapped in plastic wrap_not foil) and it was delicious!  The meringue really held up and the fruit was soft and sweet instead of slightly crunchy.  Even the crust tasted bettter!  I highly recommend making this and leaving PLENTY of time to chill in the fridge and let everything mesh, possibly even the night before.

This was very good, and a bit different. A great way to use up an abundance of rhubarb. Shared w/ in-laws and they loved it. Leftovers were a nice treat the next day, too.

I don't know what I did but it didn't come out cake-like at all. It was like a rhubarb pie and was soft like a fruit pie filling. I even baked it longer because it didn't "set". I'm afraid to cut into it.

I REALLY liked this, and so did everyone else.  My only complaint was that I didn't have quite as much rhubarb as the recipe called for, so it wasn't as rhubarby as I'd have liked.

Loved it, great hit.  Shouldn't have cut back on topping or crust, despite having less rhubarb than called for (still used 9x13 pan).

Made this last evening with the overabundant rhubarb pick from the garden....great because it uses 8 cups of rhubarb. It was rich & superb. I would cut back the sugar next time thoug as it was very sweet...or maybe try some Splenda with the sugar. Definitely a keeper.

The recipe was good, but not exceptional.  I gave it 4 stars probably because I don't care for meringue much.  I'd give it 3 days max for storage as it gets kind of slimey (yes, I refrigerated it).

Quite delicious - however, I didn't have enough rhubarb in my garden so I substituted some strawberries (2 parts rhubarb, 1 part strawberry). I love straw and rhubarb, and I found it was really great!

My mom used to make this all the time.  Everyone would always ask for the recipe!  She also uses Splenda when preparing for some of our diabetic relatives and it turns out great. I'm going to have to plant rhubarb this year, just so I can make this recipe! Delicious!

This recipe was alot of work for a college student but it was worth it!  I substituted skim milk for evaporated milk and it was fine, even though it was probably a bit more moist than the original recipe.  The meringue tasted great even though it was weeping by the time i was able to eat it.  Overall it was a wonderful recipe to use up the rhubarb mom brought from home.

Delicious!  I used Splenda because my diabetic mom was coming for dinner, and did 1/3 strawberries / 2/3 rhubarb.  Will use real sugar next time - I just can't get over that slight Splenda aftertaste.  Can't wait to make this with real sugar!

My brother in law loved this torte.  We printed out the recipe because it called for 8 cups of rhubarb.  It was worth it.

My family are big rhubarb crisp fans but this recipe was a nice alternative. I wasn't sure about the meringue on top but it complimented the rhubarb mixture nicely.    It was my first time making meringue - it took longer to form stiff peeks than I expected.

Very nice alternative to the classic rhubarb custard pie. I did need to cook the torte for an additional 20 minutes. Would make again.

I was looking for a different recipe for rhubarb.  I can't seem to make any kind of "crisp" whatsoever.  I thought I would try this.  My husband, who is VERY picky, said it was "alright" and the next morning half the pan was gone.  I think he liked it.  I didn't have any evaporated milk, so I used regular.  It still turned out great, but I will use the evaporated next time just to see what the difference is.  Thank you so much!!!

We enjoyed this a lot! 4 stars because it would have been too sweet for our taste as written. 5 stars with sugar cut down to 1.5 cups in the rhubarb filling, evaporated milk replaced with sour cream, and we skipped the merengue topping. The crust was perfectly crisp, and the rhubarb filling was luscious!

I made 2 pies, 9 inch, with Immaculate Baking premade pie crusts.  I added 2 Tblsp of arrowroot starch to help thicken the filling.

Despite a slight screw-up on my part, the pies were soft but delicious while still warm, & once thoroughly cool & wrapped in food film, they firmed-up beautifully overnight in the refrigerator.
The meringue did NOT sweat, It is tender, yet firm to slice - I hand-beat the whItes.

My mistake:
I did NOT see that the crust was to be “baked till *firm*”,  blind —- I baked them to light brown, then worried after rereading the recipe & the hour-long bake with filling, that they’d overbrown, or even burn.
So I parbaked the filling without the crust for 40-mins at 350, stirring now & then to move the more cooked part from the edges of my 9 x 15 lasagna dish (Pyrex) toward the center.

Meanwhile I whipped the whites by hand. 
I scooped the semicooked filling into my blind-baked crusts,  COVERED the edges of the pie crust with the soft-peak meringue,  & finally, baked it for another 20 minutes.

The crusts are perfect, the slices I cut while the pie was warm were   a bit soft & slumped, BUT...  after thoroughly cooling I wrapped them carefully with film & refrigerated them overnite.
The pie cuts perfectly, & while the filing doesn’t LOOK pretty & pink, it tastes wonderful.
(The egg yolks make it look a bit muddy.)

The recipe is great up until you reach the meringue section.  It is unclear how much sugar to use and it fails to mention that you must use a glass or metal bowl.  I have never made a meringue before and was mixing and mixing the eggs with a lack luster result.  I ended up using a separate recipes for the meringue.
