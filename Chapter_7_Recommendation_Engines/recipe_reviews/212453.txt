Mmmmmm - this is addictive stuff!  I used plain petite diced tomatoes but upped the jalapenos a bit - also used the pre-chopped stuff that comes in a jar.  I didn't add any additional tomato and thought that worked fine.  My avocado didn't ripen on time, so I only got to have the leftovers with avocado.  Fabulous stuff!  I like it because it's a great appetizer, but you don't just eat it mindlessly because of its kick.

It was good but not great.  A lot of potential though.  I would double the beans and remove the corn.  The dressing was a little much too.  Just some red wine vinegar (maybe 1/4 cup) would have done perfect.  I used a fresh jalapeno instead of the pickled kind.  I think my next iteration will be awesome.
