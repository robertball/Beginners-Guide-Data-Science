Isn't it interesting how so many people can make the same recipe with such different results? Also curious is how a submitted recipe is altered by some cooks and then given a bad review. Having said that, I made this just as written (half recipe) in a mini egg shape pan from Williams Sonoma (eight to the pan). SO good! Fragrant, dark, moist, luscious little dark chocolate cakes. I used "Hard Chocolate Glaze" (also fabulous) to dip them in, then made a bakery style creamy white frosting to decorate them. These were to die for! Tasted like an infinitely better version of Hostess cupcakes! In fact, I could easily see this made in a cupcake tin to duplicate them near exactly. I know I will definitely use this recipe (with the glaze) again--and again--and again. All around, an easy to mix cake that yields perfect results!

I originally gave this 4 stars but after making it again with another modification I am adding another star.  Here's the trick: instead of water, heat up 2 c milk, add 2 heaping teaspoons of instant coffee and use that to dissolve the shortening.  It makes a big difference by bringing out the chocolate flavor, rather than diluting it.  Frosted with Caroline's Fudge Frosting from this site.  Yum! Thanks!

Everyone loves this cake. I used this recipe exactly. I've made a variation of this before, where I substituted 1 cup of boiling water with 1 cup of milk and the 1/2 cup butter for 1/2 cup applesauce. I prefer the recipe with applesauce because the applesauce makes it more moist and it doesn't affect the taste at all. Less guilt too.

This cake was absolutely delectable!  And black just as the name says.  I made a couple of modifications: I used 1/3 a cup of canola oil and 1/3 of a cup of low-fat yogurt to cut back on fat, and it was still incredibly moist.  I also cut back the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  I made a glaze with 1 cup of chocolate chips, 1 cup of whipping cream and 2 tsp of vanilla.  There were raves all around when I served it.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe that I'm planning to use very often!

I highly recommend this recipe.  You can make it ahead and it stays moist.  Freezes extremely well too. Much better result when mixed by hand. Big fav with both big and little kids!

I thought this cake was great!  It was dense yet very moist and black, as the recipe title indicates.  It bakes nicely too - quite level.  I didn't have to level the cake at all.  I used 2-9" round cake pans.  
As per a couple of readers suggestions, I did use 2 cups of boiling water with 2 heaping teaspoons of instant decaf coffee.
One problem I did have is that, despite greasing and flouring the pans, the cakes stuck.  One came out nearly perfect and the other one stuck so badly that I couldn't salvage it.  I halved the recipe (halves perfectly) and made one more cake.  It stuck pretty badly too but I was able to salvage it and use it anyway.  For slightly thicker cake layers I would use this recipe plus 1/2 of it.  
It would be great alone or dusted with cocoa or confectioner's sugar.  I iced it with a fabulous chocolate fudge frusting.  MMMMMMM!!!  I will make this recipe again - definitely.

Thanks for a great recipe, Jeanie! As is my habit, I substituted 2 cups strong coffee for the water, and added 1t more salt and 2T sugar, if you can believe it! I like my cakes a touch sweeter....But even without my modifications, this is a wonderful recipe!

This is undoubtedly the best and easiest chocolate cake ever, after reading reviews, I decided to go with the original recipe and not change a thing! It's perfect and my fiance loves it!  It's not too sweet despite 2 Cups of sugar and is deliciously moist!  Try it, you'll love it!

giving this 4 stars for ease of preparation.  Used butter flavor crisco, had 1 cup of leftover coffee so used that for part of the water, and added some espresso powder to boil with the water.  I didn't even use my beaters, just a wire wisk.  I think the espresso powder added to the flavor of the chocolate and although I just used Hershey's powder, it tasted like it was a more expensive chocolate.  Made this into a bundt cake and baked @55 minutes in my oven.  Made a small review 'muffin' and although it did not puff up on top, this would be a good cake to make into a layer because it does bake even.  Not over the top sweet and drizzled the bundt cake with some leftover cream cheese frosting when it was slightly warm.  Used butter cooking spray for the pan and had no trouble with it sticking. It was gone in 8 hours but I found it did crumble a bit although it was moist.  I would maybe throw in a tablespoon or two of applesauce.  Maybe using oil instead of shortening would help the crumble problem.

Off. The. Charts. Insane. No, really. This totally reminds me of Dad's Chocolate Death Cake with all the chocolate-y goodness. I followed this recipe exactly, frosting it with my own Chocolate Buttermilk Frosting and whoa, dude. I have to watch how much I have with my weight loss journey but my husband has had two pieces already and looks to be in a chocolate coma. This is awesome--nevermind simple as heckfire to assemble. New favorite chocolate cake!

After years (I added it to my box in 2003), this is still my favorite cake ever. It comes out perfect everytime and is almost too rich even for frosting. I often just put some powedered sugar on it or ice it with raspberry preserves instead of frosting. I usually make it as is unless I am out of cocoa powder... it comes out great with four squares of melted unsweetened baking chocolate. I always use shortening -- made it with butter before but it isnt the same melt-in-your-mouth texture -- try butter flavor shortening if that is your thing. Everyone I make it for is in love with it.  Some hints... make sure you acutally boil the shortening in the water and add it to the dry mix -- no cheating! And use a spoon, not a mixer. I also sometimes add cinnamon to it for a spicier taste. Good luck!

I gave this cake one star because it came out looking like a cake.  It was easy to prepare and assemble.  There are a few problems though.  Shortening starts exploding when bringing to a boil.  Grease fire hazard: use caution.  In addition; the cake comes out very dry and crumbly.  Don't let the batter fool you into thinking the cake will be fudgey and gooey.  I followed the recipe to the exact measurements and it turned out an extremely dry cake.  Either is only meant for low altitude or is a bad recipe.

I was craving chocolate cake and decided on this recipe because it looked like it would be very quick and easy to prepare. It was, and it is delicious! We couldn't even wait for it to cool all the way, so we're eating it warm with a homemade cream cheese frosting. I used a white ww flour that I always sub for all-purpose, I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 c., and I used butter because I never use shortening. I also used about 1/2 tsp. salt. I baked it in a 9x13 glass dish and it was done at exactly 30 min, though I did check at 25 just to be sure I didn't overbake. I will try the suggestions for using coffee next time, but I think it is very flavorful and chocolaty just with the water.*UPDATE* I used coffee last time I made this since a lot of reviewers recommended it. I actually think it tastes better not using coffee!

Loved this recipe, the only thing I changed was replace one of the cups of boiling water with milk. Excellent! Frosted with Ermin Icing. Will make again and again. I had no problem with cake sticking to pan as others have had, but I was especially generous with greasing and flouring pan.

I made this cake last week, and I have to tell you, I don't think I will ever make a different chocolate cake recipe again. This recipe is very possibly the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten or made. It really does come out black. The texture inside is perfect--perfectly, evenly sized little air pockets. It is moist, and it rose beautifully. I used butter instead of shortening and I used a cocoa that is a mix of dutch processed cocoa and regular American cocoa. Other than those small changes, I followed the recipe exactly and it is perfect.

I iced it with a chocolate icing/frosting recipe from this site (for chocolate cookies).

I can't wait to make this cake again.

WOW!  What a great cake.  My daughter made this for our county fair last week.  And won 1st place. Then afterwards the cake was sold at the cake auction and sold for $110.00.  She frosted the cake with a recipe from this site also. It was the Seven minute frosting submitted by Carol. Which is a fluffy white marshmellow type frosting.

I made this for my son's 23rd birthday and he LOVED it. The other 3 kids loved it too.  I used the 1 cup water with 1 cup of milk together. I made it in a Bundt pan for 50 minutes and when cooled I frosted it with a buttercream frosting. I mentioned it to someone at work and they said their grandmother made a similar cake using 2 cups of coffee so I may try this next. I think this will be my new chocolate cake recipe from now on :)

Totally loved this recipe-the best, most tasty and moist chocolate cake ever.  Used the coffee and butter, no shortening.

Moist and delicious. Very easy to make with ingredients that are readily available in most kitchens. I reduced the amount of sugar to 1.5 cups and I can still taste the sweetness of the cake.

I made cream filled cupcakes using this recipe for the cake and the Satiny Chocolate Glaze on this site for the tops (canned white frosting for the squiggles).  The cake is SPOT on for these cupcakes.  At first I thought they were a bit dry as I'm used to the cake mix chocolate cakes, but when you hit the cream filling it's a PERFECT combo!  The color is also a deep dark chocolate.  THANKS for such a wonderful recipe!

Great recipe. It came out light and moist. I make some changes though. I used 1 1/2 cups sugar instead of 2, and olive oil instead of shortening. I also used milk instead of water, as suggested by one reviewer. My husband loved the cake. No frosting required. Thanks a lot Jeanie. This is definitely a keeper and I will make this cake again very soon.

Thanks to previous reviewers for the coffee tip, I used half vanilla/half slow roast for a rich taste, and was decadent and topped it with buttercreme frosting.  Absolutely fabulous, five star material.  Thanks Jeanie!

Very good recipe!  I took another user's suggestion and used some hot coffee instead of boiling water.  This is a very rich cake, but not too sweet (a definite plus).  I used a chocolate glaze on the top (8 squares of semisweet chocolate melted over low heat with a cup of whipping cream whisked in), and it's to die for.

This is a really good, intense chocolate cake.  I baked two 9-inch round cakes for 25 minutes.  A real treat for a chocolate lover's birthday!  (I used the water the recipe called for, I did not substitute anything else.  The flavor was fine.)  I agree this cake would be great with just a decorative dusting of powdered sugar instead of frosting.

wasn't crazy about it...felt the boiling water leached alot of flavor...made another version with decaf. coffe instead and turned out fantastic.  So I would recommend changing the water to coffee for some real flavor.

It only took 20 minutes to bake, not 30 like the recipe said (so check on it every so often).

I will never make another chocolate cake after making this! I needed cupcakes for a baby shower and I wanted the cake to look very dark so it would look awesome with the baby blue icing. It was black, and delicious. They were the hit of the shower. 

I did substitute 1 stick of butter in place of the shortening. I have never used shortening. Otherwise, I did the ingredients as listed. The cupcakes were done in 14 minutes.

Loved this cake! I went with the original version and only altered it to cut down on the fat & sugar content. Still tasted amazing and was just like a devil's food cake mix, without all the processing and chemicals. I subbed 1/3 applesauce, 1 cup of Splenda, and 1 cup of milk, for half of the original ingredients (1/3 short + 1/3 applesauce, etc). Worked out well and I used a cream cheese chocolate frosting. Fantastic and I'll make it again. Thanks, Jeanie for sharing!

This is chocolate cake recipe should be in everyone's recipe box! It was as moist as any boxed cake mix I've ever made but I had the satisfaction of telling my family that I made it from scratch.  As some reviewers said, it wasn't as sweet as some other cakes I've made but that was perfect since the butter cream icing I used was very sweet. Nice contrast. Will definitely make this one again!

This cake is fantastic and perfect for any day! I am allergic to dairy and i thought it was heaven! Instead of plain shortening, I used canola oil butter. When you are mixing the flour mixture with the hot water, "stab" the mixture with a fork so you will break any powder balls, or else small bubbles will appear in the cake. The cake had an amazing appearance as i took it out of the oven! If you are not a fan of icing or frosting, you should put powdered sugar on top of the cake. I will use this recipe of cake for every birthday I have!

I've been searching for a home made chocolate cake recipe to use for my B&B and this will be it! I add 2 heaping tablespoons of instant espresso to the boiling water - this is a fabulous cake!  It does tend to stick to pans; I generously greased and floured my pans and then put wax paper in the bottom of the 9" round pans and sprayed the wax paper with Pam then poured in the batter, and they came out just fine.  This amount of batter made three 9" cake layers that were a reasonable thickness for a 3 layer cake (not so tall that it was difficult to transport).  I used the coconut cream cheese frosting recipe from this website and did not frost the sides of the cake, only between the layers and on top.  Then I patted toasted coconut on to the exposed frosting between the layers and on the top - the cake was beautiful, magazine quality to look at, and tasted unbelievably good. I have also added mini-chips to the cake batter and that's a nice addition, but makes it tough to get the layers out of the pans.  In the future, if I add mini-chocolate chips, I will bake the layers for 5-10 mins and then sprinkle the chips on top of the layers of batter and return them to the oven. That should help prevent the chips from immediately sinking down to the bottom of the cake layers.

I made this cake for my mother's Birthday.  This was a very rich, very chocolately, slightly heavy cake. I used milk instead of water and heated it to almost boiling and mixed in a heaping teaspoon of instant coffee and 2 ounces of semisweet chocolate.  I made two 9 inch round cakes and I filled and frosted the cake with a chocolate raspberry fudge frosting, covered the whole thing in chocolate ganache, and then made another batch of ganache that I chilled, whipped, and used to pipe decorations around and on top of the cake.  I decorated the cake with sliced, toasted almonds and edible flowers.  It was sooooo good.  Never before had I completely understood the meaning of 'Death by Chocolate'...

This was a yummy very rich chocolate cake.  I made it for my husband's birthday.  I followed the suggestion of using instant coffee which gave it wonderful flavor.  Also I replaced the shortening with 1/3c of canola oil and 1/3c of plain fat free yogurt.  The result was still a very rich yummy cake!  I frosted it with the "Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting" also from this site.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent moist, dark chocolate cake.  I don't like coffee, so I used 2 packets of hot chocolate in the 2cups of hot water instead.  Made this cake for my father's birthday and used a layer of the chocolate ganache (on this site) sanwiched between  two layers of the peanut butter frosting (also on this site)in the center of the 2 layers of cake.  Then frosted with chocolate/peanutbutter frosting made with 1 lb dark chocolate chopped, 1 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1/3 cup dark corn syrup, 1 cup creamy peanut butter.  Heat cream, syrup, peanut butter just to boiling and then pour over chocolate.  whip and then let cool and beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.  This was the most amazing cake I have ever made!  The cake itself very easy but when you add all I did, it is definetly a special occasion cake, but well worth it.

I can't understand how a cake from scratch can turn out so much like a box mix? It even smelled like a mix. Maybe it's the large quantity of cocoa. I will admit this isn't bad as cakes go, but I really expected better after all the high reviews. As I began making the recipe I realized it is very similar in ingredients and proportions to Texas Sheet Cake with the exception of quadruple the cocoa powder and baking soda/baking powder instead of baking soda/buttermilk for leavening. I prefer Texas Sheet Cake, it's moister and more tender. If I make this again, I think I will use butter instead of shortening, leave out the baking powder and substitute at least 1/2 cup of the water for buttermilk. I give the recipe 3 stars because it isn't bad, but it's not 5 star good either.

My husband is a chocolate fanatic!!  He can't ever get enough chocolate so I am always hesitant to try new recipes, for fear that they won't be chocolatey enough!  I've even tried a flourless chocolate cake and it wasn't chocolatey enough!  Anyway, he absolutely LOVED this cake!  I made it for his birthday and he just couldn't eat enough of it!  He said it's the best chocolate cake he's ever had in his life!  This cake was fabulous!  unlike many other reviewers, I followed the recipe to the T and it was great!  Thanks so much!
I topped it off with "Chocolate Fudge Frosting" from this site too!

I turned to this recipe when my usual go-to recipe was giving me grief.  I was not disappointed.  It was moist, rich, and chocolaty.  I got a lot of compliments on the cake.  I'm thinking this will probably replace my usual recipe!

I wasn't too fond of this recipe, although my husband loved it. I made it this weekend for Valentine's Day. It was too heavy for my liking. The consistency was more like brownies than a cake.

YUMMY chocolate cake!  I love chocolate, but don't always love chocolate cake.  This one is moist and had good flavor.    I substituted butter for the shortening because of some food allergies/sensitivities in my family and the cake still came out wonderful.    The leftover cake also stayed moist and didn't get stale for nearly a week.  I was amazed!  I will definitely be making this again!

This is a very good chocolate cake. I made it as directed and it was very moist. It's not my favorite, but it's close. My favorite is the one bowl recipe on the back of the can of Hershey's Dark Cocoa.

Was looking for a cake recipe to put together in a hurry and this fit the bill. I followed the recipe exactly and made mini cupcakes, adjusting the baking time to suit. They came out wonderful. They weren't the most moist chocolate cake I've ever had but the chocolate flavour came through nicely. I frosted with Quick and Almost-Professional Buttercream Icing (recipe also on this site) and it was great for a evening snack. Thanks for sharing.

I would say this cake was good, but I had a few problems with it. First, It took way longer to bake than 30 minutes. Second It didn't have quite as much taste as I was hoping for, probably not enough salt. Thanks! :D

The taste wasn't as strong as I had been hoping, but the texture was absolutely perfect - as in one of the best cakes I've had. Next time I'll add more cocoa. : )

Marvellous texture! Moist, delicate, and fudgy on top. Try to use really good quality cocoa- it takes the cake from being kind of watered-down tasting to indulgent. Layered it with whipping cream whipped with raspberry jam, and spooned thawed, unsweetened raspberries over the top.  It is a soft cake, so I did have a bit of trouble getting it out of the pan in one piece- make sure the pans are really well greased!

I did this recipe again, but this time I took many suggestions regarding the boiled water to melt the shortening. I used 1 cup milk and one water with 2 T instant coffee, and that made all of the difference. It was delicious and was perfectly level..Also a plus.

I made this last weekend for my husband's birthday.  I followed the recipe pretty closely--I did add the heaping teaspoon of instant coffee and dissolved the cocoa powder in the water as well because I read somewhere it helps bring out the chocolatey taste.

My family enjoyed the cake.  However, I have to agree with the reviewer who said it had a box-mix taste.  I think it is better than a box-mix cake, but it does have that same sort of spongy texture.  If you are looking for a denser cakey cake with a finer crumb, then you should find a recipe that calls for creaming the sugar and fat and then adding the dry ingredients.  I just didn't have the energy, which is why I chose this simple recipe.

It is pretty easy to prepare and there isn't a lot of cleanup afterwards.  The batter was very thin and I was worried too, but it baked up just fine.  I will probably make this again.

I made this cake for my son's birthday. He wanted chocolate cake with vanilla icing. I followed the cake recipe exactly. I baked it for 30 minutes and it was a little too long. The cake wasn't burned, but the edges were overcooked. The cake itself was too dense for my taste and not very cakey. It had a spongey texture. The flavor was, well "thin" is the best way I can describe it. It wasn't very sweet and it wasn't very chocolatey. 
I used the vanilla buttercream recipe from Culinary Institute of America, but it couldn't save the cake. I definitely would not make this again.

This cake is absolutely wonderful. I did take a few other's suggestions on using coffee instead of plain water though.  I have never received more compliments on a cake before. I'm making two this week alone for two celebrations.  I don't think it will be enough!

This was a wonderful cake. Rich, very dark but not heavy on the cocao flavor as some can be. Was relatively easy to make and was a hit plain. I think this would be wonderful with a Ganosh style topping or a nice whipped cream style frosting.

This is very moist cake, chocolatey, easy to make, yum! Thanks for sharing, I WILL make this one again and again. The second time I made this cake I added about 1/2 c ghiardelli semisweet choc chips to the boiling water... mmmmm...it was even richer! No need for icing on this one, maybe a dustng of powdered sugar. I like it better without icing, but my family loves this with Texas chocolate icing (recipe here).

I gave it three stars because it looks fantastic, yet I haven't had a chance to taste it. The full one cup of cocoa instead of the traditional quarter to a half really gives this cake a rich dark color. Valentines day is upon us so I have to make my sweetheart something pink. So, this cake is in the freezer for use another day. Anyone have a good recipe for cherry cake?

This cake tastes great.  I made it in 2-9 in. rounds and it looked like it'd been through an earthquake, so maybe that's why the recipe says to make it in a 9x13 pan, LOL!  I made it as a b-day cake and my whole family loved it (eventhough it looked a bit funny!)  I'd recommend this to anyone!

Made this cake for choco-holic, and very particular step-father who LOVED it!  Hardly any left over.  Used fudge icing recipe from this site.   Also used 2c strong coffee and no water.  Some felt it was too sweet, but for a major sweet tooth, there is no such thing!

very good.  I cut it in half lengthwise and used one half as a base to which I topped with coffee ice cream and a layer of whipped cream.  I also took one user's suggestion and substituted strong coffee for the boiling water.  delicious!  thank you jeanie!

My husband is a chocolate freak.  This cake has been an incredible delight!  I took the liberty of throwing in a cup of chopped walnuts at the very end of mixing, and use chocolate fudge frosting for the top.  This cake is inhaled.  So far I have made it 3 weeks in a row.

First off, this cake tastes wonderful. If I was just eating the cake and not have to MAKE it, it would easily be 5 stars. With that being said, it was almost impossible to frost, because it crumbled and fell apart. I actually made it twice, because I thought that I did something wrong the first time. It was a hit with my family and easy to whip up, but the fun stopped there.

so moist and perfect! These were my substitutions. Instead of 2 cups of boiling water I used 1c water and 1c vanilla rice milk. Instead of 2 tsp vanilla extract I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp chocolate liquer.

The best from scratch chocolate recipe I've found!  I loved that it was dark and it was kinda fudgey.  I used milk instead of water, didn't have shortening so used oil (just a little less), and added about 1/3 cup of melted semisweet chocolate chips just to make it a little more chocolatey.  My in-laws, husband, and I loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

I chose this cake recipe to make for my husband's birthday... his favorite chocolate! I used half cup of coconut flour, and the rest organic white flour. For the shortening, I used coconut oil instead. The flour has a lot of fiber in it, and the oil keeps the fat from storing in the cells. This recipe came out perfect.. very moist! For the frosting, I used the fluffy peanut butter recipe, and the chocolate ganache glaze on this site. To die for! Will definitely make this for future chocolate cake lovers.

This was a pretty good chocolate cake.  After baking, the top looked so glossy and shiney and beautiful that I almost didn't want to frost it.  It was a moist cake but had a texture that was not quite what I was used to... I think because of all the shortening in the recipe.  It grew on me and was especially yummy with the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting from this site.

My spouse made this for my birthday cake, and it was very very moist.Wonderful cake will make again:) Like mentioned from another review, she used 2 cups of milk instead of water, and 2 tbsp of Instant Coffee.

This cake was so disappointing! :(  I made it EXACTLY as described, with the only (minor) change being that I used hot brewed coffee in place of the boiling water.  Others had suggested that this would help bring out the chocolate flavor, but not only didn't this cake taste very chocolate-y, it also didn't taste very SWEET--a big surprise given the amount of sugar!  Finally, the cake stuck to the pan, and it didn't hold together very well.  Overall, the taste was just okay and definitely not worth making again.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  However, I think it needs butter instead of shortening and hot milk instead of boiling water.  Those substitutions give the cake the richness that makes it shine.

This was easy to make and turned out very moist! I made cupcakes instead of a cake and it still took around the same time to bake. Delicious!

Excellent. I used Hershey's special dark cocoa powder. Rich, dark chocolate cake that is perfectly moist. Thank you for sharing.

Wow... Yummy. I made these into cupcakes, and they were perfect! I did replace the 2 cups of water with 3/4 cup milk and 1&1/4 cup coffee. When they said black, they weren't kidding! These are not even dark brown. They are rich and not too sweet on their own, so perfect for a nice big swirl of frosting! Better then any box cake I ever made. (Never need a box cake again!)

Very good cake.  I made a few adjustments to cut the fat (used 1/3 C Golden Crisco and 1/3 C. Applesauce) and substituted 1/2 C. of the water with brewed coffee.  Very light, moist, flavourful cake.  I glazed it with the following while the cake was still warm:  Beat together w/mixer:  2 C. Icing sugar, 2 T. Cocoa, 2 T. butter, 2 T. boiling water & 2 t. vanilla.

A great recipe for dark chocolate lovers because it isn't that sweet, but has the chocolate flavor. I topped my cake with a semi-sweet chocolate Kahlua ganache.

This was very good.  This is a very dense cake and would be excellent to use as a 3 or more layer cake or torte.  I baked this in two 8" cake pans and they had to bake at least 36 min.  I also used strong coffee instead of the water in the recipe.  I read that the cake would sometimes stick to the bottom of the pan, so I lined bottom of pans with wax paper and they came out perfect.  I just used a canned chocolate fudge frosting making this quite decadent.  This cake is so moist that it actually broke apart overnight during storage.

VERY good!  I made this cake for my dad's birthday and it was amasing!  I made a square cake of it, smothered it in cherry pie filling and served it with whipped cream. He ADORED it.  I will make one technical comment on it, and that is do not try to make this in a 2-piece bundt pan...mine started in one but because of all the water it leaked out! So I scraped it into a square pan and it was brilliant.  I was shy on cocoa so 2 tbsp of the cocoa was replaced with hot chocolate mix.

Great recipe. I didn't follow the Recipe mixing Instructions as I decided to use it in my Bread Machine. Substituted Canola Oil for Shortening and threw all the ingredients into the pan just like I would for Bread(liquids first). The Cake setting mixed everything together, then I set it on Bake. After 1.5 hours it was done.

I'm going to try to make a Black Forest Cake with this Recipe next time.

Very good.  Didn't need to bake the full 30 minutes.  Gave a 4 because it needed a little extra something.  Perhaps next time I'll put some chocolate chips in it or poke holes and add some caramel or fudge.

This cake was awesome!!... and extremely easy to make. The only change I made was I used butter instead of shortening as I hate the stuff. The cake was so moist and chocolatey that my kids ate it warm with no frosting. I wanted to make a treat and only had basic ingreients on hand. I'm so glad I found this recipe. Thank you

I am just making this cake for my daughters wedding. It is sooooooooooo gorgeous and moist and scummy I have to keep making another one as it keeps getting eaten ( by me). I am actually doing one inch layers which I will sandwich together before icing. I am doing twelve  layers to make a four tier cake. i will let you know how it turns out but up to now it is the best and easiest chocolate cake I have ever made. I am so glad I found this site. 
Thank Glo 
The wedding was on Sat 4th Oct and as well as looking gorgeous it tasted fantastic, very very moist. I filled it with chocolate fudge icing between each layer and coated it with belgium chocolate roll out icing. Every one loved it and wanted the recipe. I had adapted it slightly by adding a 100gm block of chocolate to the hot water and butter and I did cook the large cakes in 1" thin layers as this made it easier to cook and fill with the fudge icing. I will certainly be making this cake in future. Mine took longer to cook than said but it was so easy to make and I did not have any failures in all the twelve layers. Thank you for a superb recipe.

The ingredients for this cake are assembled in a rather untraditional fashion.  As I was putting the everything together, I was thinking "I'll see how it turns out, this is wierd!"  I didn't need to worry, it was perfect.  I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a 9x9 square.  It rose to a nice height, is very moist and I think it tastes nice and chocolaty.  I did not use coffee instead of the water, but I'm sure it would intensify the flavor.  I used Caroline's Chocolate Fudge Frosting and it was really delicious.

Very reminscent of a box cake mix, but much more dense.  It was missing that big 'chocolate wow' that I was expecting.  If I make it again, next time I will follow others suggestions of replacing the water with coffee and upping the cocoa powder.

This cake is awesome! Instead of the water I use all coffee. You can't taste the coffee. It just brings out the richness of the chocolate. I usually poke holes in the top of this, pour caramel/butterscotch topping over the top, sprinkle with toffee and cover with whipped cream. Divine!!

If I could give this recipe 20 stars I would !!  This was the most delicious, moist, truly black chocolate cake ever !! Since I cannot leave well enough alone I have to tell you two changes I made to this recipe.  I used one cup of brewed coffee and one cup of water instead of two cups of water.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour mixture.  I love the taste of cinnamon and chocolate !!

I frosted with a chocolate butter cream frosting and served to a group of friends and they all loved it.  I used a 9x13 glass pan and it took about 40 mins. at 350.

This is a keeper chocolate cake recipe - thank you so much for posting.

Just whipped this into some delicious cupcakes.  I love the dark color and luscious texture.  I followed some of the suggestions and substituted milk for the water and butter for the shortening and a few dashes of instant coffee.  Devine!

I was looking for something special for my son's first birthday, and this was it! I followed the recipe exactly except used butter instead of shortening. I used 2 9-inch pans and made a layer cake with Caroline's Chocolate Fudge Frosting from this site. Someone noted a problem with the cakes sticking, so I buttered parchment paper and lined the bottom of the pans- they came out perfectly, with no problem. I will make this cake again for birthdays,with the icing it is a standout.

I needed a recipe to replace a favorite I could not find.  Wow, this was the one.  I love dense, moist, rich chocolate cakes and this was all that.  It did not need milk or coffee that others recommended.  I did replace the shortening with butter because I prefer the flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

The only substitution I made was I used applesauce instead of the shortening. The cake has a good consistency, but got very sticky and gummy on the bottom, even though it was baked. I think there's too much baking soda and baking powder in it, because there's a strange extra flavor and I think that's what it is. The texture and consistency are much more moist and dense than a cake mix, which is good in my opinion.

Very rich, and hit that chocolate craving perfectly! Oh, and my husband loved it too! (Much like a lot of other reviewers, I used milk in place of water for a bit of balance to the amount of cocoa, and added 2 tbsp of instant coffee) All in all though, excellent!

Perfect! Used this cake to make Ice Cream Cake and it turned out great. Used 2/3 c. Smart Balance Buttery Spread in place of the shortening and followed reviewers advice and added 2 t. of instant coffee to the boiling water.

FABULOUS!!!!!  I frosted one of these cakes with a peanut butter frosting and the other with chocolate ganache (did I spell that right?)  They were to die for.

I made this cake with ease, and its texture was perfect. It baked beautifully. It wasn't as chocalety as I had hoped, but that was easy to fix with a sweet icening or adding additional chocolate.

This cake is delicious! I don't even like chocolate cake, and I had to have three pieces of this. I put on some Pillsbury Chocolate Fudge frosting, which topped it off great. Definitely a great cake to relax with, along with a tall glass of milk.

Good flavor but not as moist as I would have hoped...and I didn't overcook. I took a reviewer's advice and used coffee instead of water. That bumped the chocolate flavor tremendously. I think I may do that from now on when making chocolate cake. I will keep searching for the perfect chocolate cake recipe.

These were soooo yummy, one of the best chocolate cakes I've made yet, and the deep dark color was really nice. I glazed it with the satiny glaze from this site, and cut down a bit the amount of sugar.I used butter instead of shortening. Oh and I also halved the recipe and baked it in a 8x8 in. square pyrex pan. Came out moist and delicious, very similar to the Betty Crocker cake that you make from a box!

Great recipe and very easy to make! I made a few of changes just because I like to experiment with the recipes I make. First, I used a 12 oz can of evaporated milk and enough water to equal two cups, then I used unsalted butter instead of shortening and I used almost a full teaspoon of kosher flake salt.  The texture is perfect and moisture of this cake is just right.  Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe!

Truly amazing!!! The softest, darkest, richest, moistest cake i've ever tasted! Is at its best when topped and filled with a chocolate fudge frosting or chocolate buttercream. Guaranteed that there will not be any left for tomorrow.!!!

This is my new chocolate cake recipe.  I swear I'm going to use this cake for everything.  My husband is a chocoholic and he went nuts over this.  The only changes I made was to sub coffee for the boiling water and butter for the shortening.  Perfect, perfect, perfect.

This was a terrific tasting and looking cake. Very moist! I followed advice from a another reviewer and substituted milk for the boiling water. I also used 1/2 cup of light mayonnaise and 2 tablespoons of butter instead the of shortening. I threw in 1 cup of crushed hazelnuts and used a caramel glaze with more crushed hazelnuts on top. It was heavenly!

I've made this recipe for several functions and its always a big hit.  I add a 6 oz bag of semi-sweet chips and serve with a simple buttercream vanilla frosting (and milk of course!).  Super simple to make and tasty to eat!

Did 1/2 batch extra - like a thicker cake; used 2 1/2 cups brown sugar (packed), self raising flour and butter instead of shortening. Will try other tips given here too, next time. I like that it is made with ease and speed; and sprinkled mini choc chips on the hot cake fresh from oven and let sit in the cooling oven 5 minutes, then spread the melting choc quickly and evenly ... tada ... instant frosting; which is good for 'I wanna chocolate cake now' mood, but I think it has better possibilities, preferably decorated with ganache (cream and chocolate melted together in mwo), whipped cream and raspberries/strawberries in round layers, or serve warm with vanilla icecream; or cover whole cake with freshly whipped cream and chocolate shavings on top or broken bits of toffee .. or ... layered with jam and chocolate frosting ... ooohhh

This cake was very moist and very rich.  I think it was just excellent. And that is because I don't like chocolate cakes.  I made this one for my husbands birthday and he feel in love with me all over again haha. But really this cake was a really quick and easy cake to make THANKS JEANIE!!

Absolutely perfect!  I decided it was time to get down to business and really learn how to make a great chocolate cake for birthdays and events.  I found Jeanie's, made two cakes for a layer cake,  put raspberries and chocolate glaze (chocolate & whipped cream) in the middle and topped it again with glaze!  TO DIE FOR!  Thank you Jeanie my search is over.

Congratulations Jeanie, this is a wonderful recipe, moist and chocolately, no icing required, I just dusted a little confectioners sugar on top.  I also cooked 15 minutes longer in a gas oven.  No more mixes for this gal.  Thankyou.

This is my best friend's choice for his birthday cake every year since I discovered the recipe. I make it exactly as written, except that I "flour" my pan with cocoa powder so the cake doesn't have white powder on it when cut. It comes out moist and chocolaty and delicious. I make it as a sheet cake and frost it with a buttercream frosting flavored with fresh orange juice. Yummers!!

Excellent cake. Very light and fluffy. Next time I’ll cut it in half because it makes a big cake. I made a triple layer 8” cake with this recipe. Delish! I added espresso as half the boiling water blended with regular water. It makes the chocolate flavor more pronounced/richer but does not hint of espresso.

Moist, rich, yummy chocolate cake. This is a great cake to use with sweet icing as the cake itself is not overly sweet.

I will definitely make this cake again.  If I use less sugar would it change the consistency?  It’s a true dark chocolate cake.  We loved it!

I made this exactly to the recipe with the exception of adding 2 heaping tsp. of instant coffee. I am sure this would have been perfect without any changes.  Yum.  Moist and stays moist to the last crumb.  Thank you for the great recipe.  Simple and delicious.

Super easy and yummy! I also did half water, half whole milk. Used butter, not shortening. Had left over German chocolate coconut frosting, so I made half batch and made 6 large cupcakes. High five!!

So not really sure why this recipe is so loved. I did everything exactly and it came out looking beautiful which was surprising because the batter was so liquidity but nonetheless it looked great. Unfortunately to me this cake had no flavor and was very dry. The best thing about it was the store bought frosting. I'm glad I tried it out but I won't be making it again.

Followed the recipe exactly.  The batter is very thin, but the cake is outstanding, so have faith!  This is without a doubt my favorite chocolate cake, super rich with chocolate and the perfect texture.  For those having problems with melting the shortening, just put the water in a glass bowl, the shortening into the water, and microwave it for a few minutes until the shortening melts.

I love this recipe; I use it all the time and it always comes out moist. As for the boiling water problem... you DO NOT put it on the stove lol you measure out the previously boiled into a bowl and add the shortening until melted, then add to cake mixture. Not a fire hazard just common sense. If you question the recipe ask the person before moving forward. I always read the full recipe and directions before making anything.

I made this cake excepting a beautiful chocolate cake for a friend's going away party, what I got instead was a small dry brownie. I had added milk to even out the dry with the wet but I doubt it did much. I had no time to make a second cake and had to warn party-comers.

This has become our family go-to cake.  I have made ahead and frozen (wrapped in plastic, then foil).  I take it out of the freezer, let it defrost and frosted it....tastes moist and fresh.    I make it just as the recipe is written.  No need to change a thing.

Delish!    I had not one problem with this cake.   
Moist, not overly sweet allowing the chocolate flavor to shine. I used butter flavored shortening as well.  I also used raspberry preserves (filling) as I made a 3 layer cake and an Italian Meringue butter cream frosting (lots of butter)
I think some confusion in one of the lower rated reviews was that the shortening was to be melted on it's own .  Nope,  boiling hot water onto the shortening.   Will definitely make this cake again.

This was hands down the quickest cake I've,  ever made...I followed the recipe to the letter .   The steps couldn't be easier. It was a winner on all levels. It took only minutes to bring together the bake was even ,the texture & crumb was moist , the shine on top was great (& expected with Crisco), the taste was as a "homerun".   I will of course try espresso in the next or a "black forest" version, as others suggest LOL.. . A no mixer easy clean-up as well...a worthy one to keep &  share. ??

This cake is delicious and moist!  I add whipped cream on top.  It's got a rich chocolate taste, but not too rich.  The whipped cream helps to balance it out.  Great recipe when you've run out of milk.  Definitely moist.

I'm sorry to say this didn't turn out well. I didn't taste the chocolate very much. No one wanted to eat it. I didn't make any modifications. One thing it did well is getting out of the pan pretty easy.

Best chocolate cake we have tasted so far. I didn't have shortening so I used oil. Really moist and comes out of pan easily. I used cool whip on top instead of frosting because it is sweet enough. Great recipe!

I tried this recipe for a birthday cake substituting the 3/4 cup shortening for 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup of applesauce. The batter was very thin and watery but got thicker once I added the flour. I used 2 9 inch rounds instead of a 9 x 13. The cake was very moist and delicious. Will definitely make again!

My husband is a chocoholic and was I looking for a birthday cake that he would rave about. Found this and baked it, was a big hit. The cake is moist and delicious. I used sugar free chocolate icing to minimize the caloric impact but will definitely be using this recipe again.

This is the recipe that my mom used to make and long ago lost to me!  Followed directions exactly except substituted butter for shortening. Excellent excellent!  Thank you for returning a wonderful childhood memory to me!

I don't know what we did wrong when following this recipe, but it was so bad that it was inedible. Followed the directions exactly...definitely will not be using this recipe again.

This was a cinch to throw together, and was moist & tasty. Thanks...this is my new go to chocolate cake. My favorite thing about this cake is it is not overly sweet.

Super delicious cake. In place of 2 C boiling water, I did 1C water, 1C milk, really hot in the microwave, so the shortening didn't melt completely, but I mixed it in. Anyway, the cake is incredible.

Really delicious.  I made this for my older son's birthday cake today.  I subbed one cup of boiling coffee for 1 cup of water and used canola oil in place of shortening.  I baked it in a bundt pan....I'd say about 45 minutes, maybe 50 minutes (till it tested done).  Not only  was it delicious it was a perfect texture, moist and tender but not mushy. It came out of the pan quite easily. Earlier in the day we were talking about tailgating at my younger son's college game in a few weeks and deciding what to make.  Halfway through his cake he said "you can make this cake to bring".  There you go...enough said!  Thank you for the recipe.

This is truly the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted or made.  Everyone who tastes it raves about it.  I was even asked by a friend to make this cake for her wedding!  And it's super easy and quick to make.

I hate when I devote my time and ingredients to a recipe that seems to have a perfect rating just to end up disappointed.  After following the recipe TO THE TEE was that the cake was indeed chocolatey but not sweet!  It crumbled very easily and no matter how much I greased and floured my good quality non stick pans, the batter still stuck and the cake made a mess  just getting out of the pan.  I really wanted to like it especially since this recipe didn't call for milk which I was out of but unfortunately, I did not have good results with this recipe.  More power to those of you who reached success, however you did it!  Thank you anyway for generously sharing your recipe with us!

I live at high altitude, and it turned out fine. Not dry and crumbly. What I thought I might do next time though, is add a little more salt and some more cocoa. It was really good though with making it exact. Also, maybe find a good minty frosting recipe to add on top. As far as exploding grease; you bring the water to a boil, take it off the heat and THEN add the shortening, stirring till it melts.

Visually, the end product looks delicious, but I found that it lacks flavor and isn't sweet enough.  I may tweek it a bit and try again.

The cake itself was very good, very moist. Easy to make. I still need to find a good chocolate frosting recipe since the one I made was too sugary with not much chocolate flavor.

This came out beautifully. I subbed coffee for the water and butter for the shortening. I am a beginning baker who is always looking for simple, straightforward, fail-proof recipes and this is one of them. It is fast and has a great chocolate flavor. I made it with a vanilla cream cheese frosting but it could be dressed up in so many ways. Probably makes great cupcakes too! Thanks Jeanie Bean, I will definitely be making this again.

Fantastic! Super moist and wonderfully easy. I did not have the problem of a dry surface as I have had with a lot of cakes :)
UPDATE: this is my go-to cake now. I make it ALL the time, consistently producing good results. In a big round tin, usually looks great. 
I always use only butter, and bake at 170C it takes about 10-12 mins more but it tastes better.
Often use coffee instead of water because that brings out the deep flavour of cocoa.
Also, egg substitutes work well.
Warning: DO NOT use a springform tin - the batter is quite runny (like the consistency of cream) and seeps right through (of course still edible and yum)

Very moist, easy cake. I made it with 2 Tbs. instant coffee in the boiling water and it was divine. I cut each 9" round in half horizontally and filled each layer with the sweetened whipped cream recipe then coated in all in the pro ganache recipe on this site. Next time I will double the whipped cream recipe (wasn't enough) and add more sugar, it's not a very sweet cake with the bitterness of the coffee. Delicious recipe!

Dense and moist, I used this recipe for my brother's wedding cake.  It didn't crumb up when I frosted it and it stacked well.  It also filled circle pans exactly to size, it didn't come away from the sides at all.  My brother said it was the best wedding cake he'd ever had.

What a delicious cake, moist cake this turned out to be.  Great even without icing.  I added two heaping teaspoons of instant coffee to the boiling water and loved the extra flavor zap it gave to the cake.
The second time I made this cake, I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added a cup of mini marshmallows and 1 c of chocolate chips to the batter.  Then sprinkled a few hands full of coconut on top.  I did have to cover the cake with foil for the last half of the baking time so that the coconut would not burn.  But it was worth it.  Hubby just loves it.

This cake was great! however it is not the strongest, richest flavor.  Unfortunatly neither was the rasberry filling I use. So all in all it was kind of a bland cake.  If you use a filling or a topping with a lot of punch and flavor- this would be amazing!!

This cake got mixed reviews in our house; followed the recipe exactly.  I thought it had a strong baking powder aftertaste.  The texture is dense and spongy, my husband thought it was one of my non-fat concoctions. My daughter who usually only eats frosting liked the cake, my other daughter wouldn't eat it. To its credit, this cake is very chocolatey. If I make again, I may try subbing milk or coffee for the water, and might add some chocolate chips too. (I originally gave this 3 stars but added a star - the flavor was better the following day.)

Fabulous recipe! The only changes I made were to add instant coffee and use milk instead of the water as other reviewers suggested. I made cupcakes and iced with marshmallow frosting, YUM.

This cake is perfect. I've made it several times with no modifications to the recipe. Very moist and a great not too sweet taste. Since I've introduced my family to this chocolate cake I have been designated the birthday cake maker.  Thank you!

DELICIOUS!  Great chocolate flavor but not too sweet.  The cake was moist. My husband requested a chocolate cake for his birthday today.  My favorite is not usually chocolate cake, but this is one I would make again.  Easy to make but more important it is a delicious cake.

I've made this cake at least 20 times, and I've never had it turn out badly once.  I melt the butter in the hot water, then throw everything into my kitchenaid mixer and let it go for 10 min.  I dump it into a pan 9 x 13 pan and let it bake for the allotted time.  It comes out great.  I wouldn't change a thing.

My husband loved it. I didn't have a sifter when I made it and it turned out so good. Better than when I use the sifter. I made this cake three times in just a week.

This cake was pretty good. I followed the recipe completely except subsituting milk for water. It wasn't as sweet as I was expecting it to be. I have had sweeter and more moist cakes, it dried out fast on the ends when I was cooling it.

Excellent!  I made half the recipe.  Which worked out perfectly.  Only two of us in the house. I made it in a loaf pan (couldn't find my round) I had too cook it a little longer, about 45 min because of the pan shape but it came out great.  I sprinkled a little powdered sugar on top and it was beautiful!  Very easy to slice and very moist.  I will definately make this again!

The batter is AMAZING!!!! I haven't even tasted this cake yet (it's still in the oven) but using the batter as an indicator i think it's going to be great. I used milk as other reviewers have suggested and added two heaping teaspoons of instant coffee.  THanks for the recipe!!!!

Awesome cake!  Used applesauce in place of the shortening and the cake came out deliciously moist still.  The boyfriend says, "Feel free to make this cake whenever you want."

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but this did not come out.  I sifted together the dry ingredients and boiled 2 cups of milk.  I melted the shortening in the milk, added it to the dry ingredients, beat in the eggs and added vanilla.  The result resembled cookie dough more than cake batter.  I wonder if I should have cooled the milk/shortening mixture before adding it.  I baked my mess like a cake and the result was lumpy and fell apart.  It did taste good though.  I decided to try again and mixed the dry ingredients (I used Splenda instead of sugar this time) and then treated it like a boxed mix.  I added 1 1/3c water and 1/3c oil.  Then I beat in 3 eggs and some vanilla.  It baked beautifully in about 30 minutes and was delicious.  Tasted very similar to a boxed mix.

This cake is FANTASTIC!!  It turned out great each time I made it.  I've turned it into a sheet cake for birthday cakes, and everyone always comments on the great flavor and how moist it is.  Follow the directions EXACTLY and you won't have any problems.

Was OK but not the best I've had. I did what other people suggested and put milk instead of water. The cake had a good overall flavor but just wasnt moist enough. I liked that the cake was a little dense which I can use in the future for tiered cakes. Im going to try some different adjustments to see if I can still get a dense but moist cake.

This cake exceeded my expectations.  It's one of those recipes you only dream you could put your hands on.  I also used milk and instant coffee granules in place of boiling water.  The result is unbelievably moist cake with satisfying chocolate flavour.  It is a very versatile recipe and rises very well.  I filled my pans 3/4 full and they almost overflowed, so be careful with that.  Spectacular!

I just made this and it's fabulous. It's dense and moist. I added 2 packages of Swiss Mix to the boiling water before I poured it over the shortening. Not sure if it made a difference or not, but it was great. I am adding this to my "favorites". It's restaurant worthy and everyone thought I bought the cake from a bakery!

I made this last night and it was very good. I did have a little trouble with it sticking to the pan but it still came out ok. It was also a little too moist so I will try with a little less water next time.

This was alright. Not bad, but it was not nearly as chocolate-y as I had hoped for. Really, it tasted remarkably like a boxed mix... not what I hope for when baking from scratch. I used "Mom's Buttercream Frosting" and THAT was fantastic! I doubt I will make this again... a mix is much easier and tastes the same!

Wow! This cake was delectable. I took a bite after I had frosted it with chocolate frosting, and practically melted into a puddle on the floor. It completely satisfied my insane chocolate craving. 
I added some toasted coconut to the frosting, that's yummy.
ALso, this cake tastes better warm than cold, in my opinion. So, I pop a slice in the microwave for around 10 or 15 seconds. 
Warning: An ice-cold glass of milk is required for the eating of this cake. ;)

it was good :) my college housemates loved it though i found it a little too moist. like other reviews, i replaced the water with strong coffee, and frosted the cake with the chocolate sour cream icing found on the site (reducing the confectioner's sugar to 2 cups). it was great!

This was pretty good, for some reason I thought baking it in a 9x13 pan would be quicker than making 2 layers.But its not, it takes alot longer to cool enough to frost. We liked it, it was best the first night while still slightly warm with chocolate buttercream frosting.

The only thing I changed was adding coffee instead of hot water as one reviewer suggested. I used chocolate ganache to frost it. Very good.

sooooo good.
I made this for someone's birthday with chocolate fudge icing and white chocolate drizzles.
I expected it to be a little too strong in the chocolate departmet but it was perfect, even after I added hot chocolate to the 2 cups of water.
Best chocolate cake ever, rich and moist but not over the top.

Simple but moist and delicious! I replaced the shortening with butter, and the flour and baking powder with self raising, and it still turned out wonderfully!

Mine was a flop,  I didn't know if maybe it was something I did. I followed the recipe to the T except tried to make muffins instead of a cake. and I was going to frost them with my peanut butter frosting recipe on this sight (awesome by the way). But I did not get that far. The muffins top did not rise, they just popped right off the muffins and the inside was so crumbly I couldn't even think about peeling the paper off of one.  Tomorrow is Easter so I had to just use the recipe on the cocoa box at the last minute, I was very dissapointed.

This is the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten.  As suggested by others, I added 2 teaspoons of instant coffee granules to the boiling water and I used half butter and half shortening.  I covered the cooled cake with a ganache  of 4oz. semi-sweet chocolate and 4oz. bittersweet chocolate melted in 1 cup of heavy cream brought to a boil.  It was to die for.

WOW!  This is truly the dark chocolate cake recipe I have been looking for!  It is so rich, I didn't even use a frosting, though I bet it would be fantastic with a dark chocolate ganache and some fresh whipped cream.  The only changes I made were to use butter instead of shortening, and to melt it in hot coffee instead of plain hot water.  The coffee is a decadent little touch that I add to all of my chocolate cakes.

Ok, this cake was AMAZING!!  I made it last night for my MIL b-day.  Everytime I've tried a homeade cake - it has come out crumble. This was moist, chocolatey and totally amazing.  I did use brewed decaf coffes to melt the butter/shortnin
(used half butter instead of all shortning) . I also used the recipe for buttercream frosting II - it was amazing as well ( used combo butter/shortning as well).  Awesome cake!  I also put a thinlayer of strawberries in the middle of the cake with the frosting...........

A very rich dark chocolate cake.  Bakes up very moist.  I used Ghirardelli Sweet Ground Chocolate and Cocoa instead of unsweetened cocoa. Tastes great with a simple powdersugar and butter based frosting. Yum! Thanks!

Really good cake! I made this cake for my birthday. I used  2/3 cup canola oil in place of the shortening. Also I used 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon for a little spice. I took the advise of other reviewers and used 2 cups of brewed coffee instead of water. The coffee was a great touch but perhaps that gave the cake a little to much caffeine and I dont drink decaf so I didnt have any on hand. Will be making this cake again but maybe just use water next time. Very easy!

This was a really good recipe.  I didn't have shortening, so I used margarine, and I only had about 1 tsp vanilla so I added 1 tsp almond flavoring.  The cake was so moist.  I put the leftovers in a tupperware container and they still tasted yummy 2 days later.  Will definately make it again.  This one's a keeper.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. He's a genuine dyed in the wool 'chocoholic'. I iced it with a chocolated fudge icing, and it was delicious. It turned out moist and even the day after the party, (there was a very little piece left) it stayed moist.  This is definitely a keeper that I won't be reserving just for birthdays. Thanks Jeanie

The cake tastes fine, but the texture is a little crumbly. Did this happen for anyone else? Who knows what happened?  I'll definately try it again sometime.
