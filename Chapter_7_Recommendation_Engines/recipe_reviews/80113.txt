Similar to my Grandmother's recipe that I have used for 30 years. Our version does not use Sausage and adds an egg to hold it all together. Ours also, does not use butter, because hamburger is enough fat. :) 
 Can be baked outside of the turkey, just add a bit of broth. Simple, tasty. Add your own variations! Delish!

Boring, this is about as boring as stuffing can get before you can call it "diner" food. My family came here from Tuscany in the 30's to expand their business and thankfully they packed their cooking talents. Our stuffing blows this out of the water, maybe I'll post it. You can somewhat fix this greasy, bland stuffing by using mild Italian sausage, 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper, and French bread and it will jump it two stars.

While I'm sure this recipe is absolutely delicious just as it's written, I just want to say that I did make a couple of changes to lighten it up just a bit and only dirty one pot. I melted 2 sticks of butter in a Dutch oven and added the celery and onion. After about 5 minutes I added 1 pound of ground white chicken and continued cooking until the chicken was done and the celery and onion were clear. I stirred in one 14 ounce bag of herb stuffing and one can of reduced sodium chicken broth. You can add a little hot water if it is still too dry (I personally like really moist dressing). I also added a bit of pepper. You can serve it as is or put it in the oven if you like it browned. This version, too, was delicious. Thanks, Michelle, for sharing this great recipe.

It was delicious. Make sure you have a big enough pot/dutch oven. If yours is too small, I'd STRONGLY suggest cutting back on the butter. BUt other than that, fantastic.

Very good but the Pilgrims must have liked things very bland.  There is no seasoning what so ever in this dish.  I added salt and pepper, sage, parsley and oregano.  Will make it again

I made this for Thanksgiving where I was invited to and it was a hit. I had to use Turkey sausage because some people don't eat pork but it was still delicious. I did add a bit of rosemary and garlic powder for taste to the meat mixture. It was a hit and was asked to bring it again next Thanksgiving.

Hey everyone, I'm going to make this today for Thanksgiving tomorrow. I'm wondering if the bread is supposed to be stale or not? I left my loaf out overnight just to be sure but if not I can always get another loaf. Help, what do I do!?

I am about to make this recipe for the third time. Each time I have made it I've been told by at least one person that it's the best stuffing they've ever had. My husband doesn't like to find the tiniest piece of onion in anything so I chop the onion into a puree before using. Everyone still gets all the flavor and my husband is a very happy man!!! Thanks for the great recipe. I will continue to use it for years to come!

I followed as directed.  Has great flavor but very greasy/buttery.
