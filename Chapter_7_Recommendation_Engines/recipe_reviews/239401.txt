These were very interesting cookies. A combination of meringue, cake and crunch. Not too sweet, very chocolatey, light as air - they have the texture of eating a cloud of chocolate. They really are chocolate air cookies in this sense. And watch out, because with kids around they disappear into thin air! They're addictive.  I melted the chocolate in the microwave to speed things along. I made a half portion and got 12 cookies. I baked them for 10 minutes then left them in the oven with the door cracked for 5 minutes. Once cooled they are quite delicate so be careful.Quick and easy to make; and the kids liked them: what more could make life easier? Thank you Epagoza for your lovely recipe.

Had a lot of trouble getting the egg whites whipped - added a pinch of salt after reading some tips elsewhere, but still didn't manage to get past the soft peak stage (I think my eggs weren't fresh enough). Used lemon juice instead of cream of tartar. They turned out looking a little odd - kind of in two layers, with a crispy merengue-like layer on top and a chewy almost brownie like layer that spread out underneath. However, they were DELICIOUS and I will absolutely be making this recipe again (though I might practice making some plain merengue first)

These cookies all ended up spread out and attached to each other. Suspect the oven temperature is too high. We do our plain meringues at 225 for an hour.
