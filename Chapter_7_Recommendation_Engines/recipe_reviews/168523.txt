Another classic example of a great recipe on this website that more people really ought to try. Adding sour cream to the cookie batter is a interesting twist, but it works well. The cookie comes out from the oven crispy on the edges, soft & chewy in the middle and there is that crunch from the nuts within. My family really likes the play of chocolate & fruit, so this cookie has quickly become a favorite. I made this recipe as instructed the first time. It's certainly good as is, but I've made a few adjustments to suit our tastes. 1) We like cookies with a lotta stuff, so I add a full cup of both cherries & chocolate chips. 2) I think fruit goes better with dark chocolate, so I use chips with a higher coca content (e.g. Ghirardelli)rather than semisweet. 3) I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup instead of the 3/4 listed. 4) Almonds work great, but experiment with other nuts as well. Next time I intend to try hazelnuts. Admittedly, dried cherries aren't cheap (from the grocery chains, Trader Joe's price is the most reasonable), but they really make this recipe and any leftovers make a great snack too.

Hubby was not impressed with these. Said I've made better. Probably just add dried cherries to my next batch of regular chocolate chip cookies. The recipe probably  needs vanilla and more butter rather than sour cream to increase the flavor.
