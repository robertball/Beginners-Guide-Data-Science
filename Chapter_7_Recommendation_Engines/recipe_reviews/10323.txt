we make this recipe every year - and love it! two suggestions - substitute milk chocolate morsels for the semi sweet - and omit the egg as it's not necessary. delicious!

Reminds me of my childhood. If you are concerned about the uncooked egg in the recipe you can get around this by using an egg-beater type product (these are pasturized).

This was so easy! I made this recipe for part of a Christmas gift basket and it looked so pretty with all of the colors! I multiplied it X4 which made rolling it in the coconut a little difficult but other than that EXCELLENT! I got many compliments!!

These were a childhood favourite; however I would not recommend adding an egg as it does not get cooked at any point and semolina is a huge concern these days. Omit the egg for the same results!
