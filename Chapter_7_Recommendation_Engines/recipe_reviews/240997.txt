Good stuff!! Definately drain the salmon and use the liquid as needed.We double the recipe and added 3 tbls of minced onion and one extra tbls of red wine vinegar, left the cappers whole and added some of the brine liquid (loved the "tanginess" of the finished product. My daughters liked it and my 10 yr. old asked me to make it for her school lunch. Canned salmon can be expensive up to 5.99 for a 14.5 oz. can but at wal-mart it only costs 2.74 for the big can, very inexpensive if you have this with a salad/soup for a weeknight meal :)

Loved the flavor! Dicing the cucumbers would make it easier to spread.

I drained the salmon, reserved the juice and would do that in the future.  I would suggest you do the same, and add more of the liquid if needed.  Even without the liquid, the consistency was "very" moist, but with the liquid, would have been soupy.  On the positive side, we enjoyed the sandwich, and although you do get a little kick of heat, it by no means overwhelms.  This was a nice break from traditional tuna salad.

Very good!  Great option for lunch.  I used frozen salmon patty cooked in a little bit of oil on the stove.  I also added chopped onions, and a little bit of onion salt and celery salt.  Will make a bigger batch next time to take for lunch at work.

Maybe use tuna instead?  Just too watery and mooshy even after omitting a lot of the liquid.

This was good, but as the others said, drain the water from the can and reserve it to add as you go IF you like it real soupy/wet. I prefer it not as wet so I didn't even use the water from the can because I found that the mayonnaise and all other ingredients made the consistency just right.
