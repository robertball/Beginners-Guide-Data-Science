If I could I would give this 4 & 1/2 stars. I save 5 stars for super exceptional stuff.  My husband loved this and I have to say it was quite good.  First I used regular linguini pasta instead of whole wheat rotini.  I used 1 (10 oz) container of Buitoni regular alfredo sauce and 1 (10 oz) container of Buitoni light alfredo sauce  from the cold case at the grocery store. I have used the jarred varieties of alfredo sauce before and have never been satisfied with the taste of any of them so I thought I would try the more fresh version. I personally think that it was hands down much better than the jarred. I upped the milk to 3/4 cup intead of 1/2 and used 16 ozs of pasta.   Then I used Kraft 2% Colby Jack Monterey but used 2 cups so it was a little cheesier.  I found the recipe easy to follow and quick to put together. Definetely a keeper. In the future I will make it with shrimp or chicken as well as the ham. Thanks for sharing the recipe mrs. embee.

This recipe was great! I changed it though - I used 16 oz of Garden Rotini; I added 2 cups of Velveta to the Alfredo instead of the shredded cheese; I sauteed the ham in olive oil with half an onion chopped, 2 cloves of garlic and a 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning; I used a 12oz bag of microwave in the bag Broccoli. I also didn't bake it, I just threw all the cooked items in a pot!

I had some leftover ham in the freezer from Easter, so thought this sounded like an easy, comforting dish.  I made my own cheese sauce with half chicken broth, half 2% milk, and some sharp cheese along with the Colby-Jack.  This was surprisingly good, and fast.  I will keep this one and maybe try leftover chicken next time.  Thank you mrsembee!!

Very good recipe!  This was super easy to make. I used fresh broccoli because I had it on hand.  I used 3 cups of ham because I wanted to use it all up. The 15 oz jar of Alfredo was plenty, I filled the jar with the milk and shook it and poured it that way into the pan.  (Alfredo sauce you seem to waste a lot it get's left over in the jar) Very Good we will make again!

good, used less pasta and more milk as there was not quite enough alfredo
just a little salt as the ham was the cola ham from Easter with the grapejuice on it!

Very good and easy. Great way to use leftover ham. I changed sauce choice to more suit our family taste and added basil and mint while browning the ham.

Don't use chicken instead of ham.  I've made this twice; the ham adds salt that is needed.  With chicken this was bland.  With ham, this was great!

This was a great way to get rid of leftover ham from Christmas, as well as some unused monterey jack cheese I had bought for cheese & crackers. My very picky boyfriend even liked it! This will definitely become a repeat dish at our house!

This recipe is awesome!  It is so easy, and always a big hit!  It also freezes very well, so it is great to save for a rainy day, or to take to someone like a new mother or such.  You don't want to miss out on this recipe!

We really enjoyed the taste of this dish, I do think it was a little dry in the end and would probably add more alfredo or less pasta next time.

I just love how people "change" the recipe. I too do it sometimes. Only because I dont have an ingredient. This one I added onions and I already had left over califlower so I added that with the broccoli. WONDERFUL!!!

I usually save the left overs for my husband, but this was so yummy, I had to have them. :) Like someone else said, I also recommend using Bertolli alfredo sauce. I also used paramasean instead of colby-monterey jack, and it was wonderful.

Great tasty casserole that doesn't require a ton of ingredients or effort.  I am not a fan of whole wheat pasta, so I used regular and skim milk to try and offset the fat content in the alfredo sauce.  My kids liked this meal a lot.

I changed the white sauce to red as my hubb don't really fancy white. I added canned tomatoes on top of a can of red sauce, added cherry tomatoes and followed the remaining ingredients with fresh boiled broccoli. Didn't had enough of grated mozzarella so I added additional sliced cheddars, hahah... Turned out great and my 3 yr old girl loved it!

Great recipe..I would also give it 4.5 stars! Had all the ingredients on hand, and it was quick and easy to put together. My alfredo sauce was 4-cheese alfredo, which I would use again, and I had frozen broccoli/cauliflower mix which was also good. Family loved it.

Wow did this turn out better than expected! Much tastier than your average casserole type pasta dishes. I will atribute part of that to the sauce I used, Roasted Red Pepper Alfredo rather than plain alfredo. I think this really make this a hit and added much more flavor than traditional plain alfredo sauce. I also mixed in just a bit of the cheese that was supposed to stay on top. This was super delicious and hubby (who strays from casseroles AND alfredo sauce) gobbled it up fast and had seconds before I was done with my first bowl. I HIGHLY recommend trying different flavored sauces to give it more flavor, and will be trying this with other meats and veggies soon.

Great recipe.   Tasty with Classico Creamy Alfredo and grated pepper jack cheese.  The pepper jack provided bursts of spice.  I wanted it to be creamier; perhaps next time I'll add more milk.  Hubby went back for thirds and said I can make this again anytime.

This was delicious.  I won't use jar Alfredo sauce though so made my own.  Had it called for homemade Alfredo I would have given it 5 stars.  Sadly I live in a country that is not big on cheese and Monterey Jack is not available.  When I'm back home in the U.S. I will make it exactly as written (save the jar sauce) and I know it will be a 5 star recipe!  Thanks!

I am glad I found this recipe. I needed to use up left over ham and every recipe I came across seemed the same... ham/beans, ham/potatoes, ham/eggs. I will make this again because it was inexpensive, easy to make, filling, and yummy. Even better, my family can get 2-3 meals out of this, depending on how hungry everyone is.  I did not measure anything and ended up using 2 jars of Alfredo sauce. Because I did not measure, I don't know if I needed 2 jars because I had excess noodles/meat/broccoli, or because the mixture was proportioned correctly but seemed dry. I also did as other reviewers mentioned and sautéed some chopped onions before adding the ham to my pan. Overall a quick weeknight dinner that everyone liked. Thanks for sharing it.

Good recipe -- but it needs more sauce. 
When I first put it in the oven the sauce was thin, but by the time it baked, it was all absorbed; it could have used more alfredo sauce.  Maybe some parmesan or garlic also???

Very tasty! I skipped the step where you brown the ham and broccoli...just added the cubed ham without browning, and partially cooked the broccoli in the microwave before adding.  Also, I used skim milk, regular rotini rather than whole wheat, (just because that is what I had on hand), and  sprinkled panko breadcrumbs on top of the cheese topping.

I made this tonight and the only change I made was using an oven-save pan so I didn't have to dirty another dish, it also saved about 10 minutes on baking time.  My huband and one-year old twins LOVED this recipe. Next time I'll use a bit more alfredo sauce but it's a hit either way.

This is actually about a 4.5 star...very close to six!  I just felt like it needed more sauce.  Next time, I will up the alfredo sauce to two jars, and I think it will be perfect.  I also added a little bacon and used two cups of cheese instead of one.  It was very good!

Oh, my goodness this recipe was delicious!  I wasn't sure if I had enough ham, so I fried up a few slices of bacon to add to it.  Not one to let tasty bacon drippings go to waste, I sauteed the ham in the drippings rather than in olive oil.  Yum!  Also added a clove of garlic while sauteeing the ham, and used roasted red pepper alfredo sauce instead of the regular.  This recipe is a keeper.

I sautéed onion with the ham and added some dried basil, garlic powder and a pinch of cayenne to the dish. This helped kick it up a bit! I also mixed the cheese in rather than on top and covered with foil to bake to keep from drying out.

Great comfort food dish and another way to get more broccoli in the kids! I would definitely make this again,  and would probably try substituting chicken as I have it on hand more often.

So simple to make. I found all the ingredients at Dollar General. I will definitely be making this again!
Update on July 3, 2018. I have made this several times since my original post trying different pasta shells. Last two times I've used the colored spirals. This will be how I make it from now on. Just so colorful and I've served over 20 people with it and they all love it.

Great basic recipe. Spinach would also be really good in place of the broccoli. I have not made this yet . The reason for only 2 stars is the use of jarred Alfredo sauce. Take a look at the chemical ingredients on the jar and then go home and make your own!! It is easy and you can pronounce all the ingredients. 
***A good rule when choosing a food product is if you would not ever have the ingredients on your pantry shelf don't buy the product. Food companies are beginning to get the message.
PS: Of course, don't include the listed vitamins in the group of taboo ingredients.

I used a little less pasta and a little more broccoli. Delicious!  I would recommend covering with foil to hold in moisture during baking. My nine year old and I both called it a family favorite.
I have to add a bit to my review. We have made this several times but tonight we used some fresh asparagus that I roasted in the oven a few minutes.  Wow!!!

This was very good, but a little dry with this much pasta.  I made a few nights early, so I could just throw it in the oven when I got home from work, which worked well.  I loved the combination of ingredients, but next time will cut down the pasta, so it isn't so dry and it tastes a little cheesier.

I did as suggested and used Buitoni sauce; I sautéed onion with the ham and used more ham and fresh broccoli, and added Colby Jack cheese to the sauce. The sauce was a bit thin so I put some roux in. Very good flavor, would definitely make again.

We really liked this recipe! I needed something to use up leftover ham and some cheese. My kids chowed down and my husband said it is a winner! I subbed muenster cheese since we had some we needed to use. I also used egg noodles instead of rotini. I used less. It was a 12 oz bag and I cooked it all, but I simply added it until the sauce coated all of the pasta and got rid of the little bit that was left. I will definitely make this again in the future. It's a pretty easy and forgiving recipe so just use whatever cheese you have. Pasta could be different too but I don't think I would recommend spaghetti or linguini.

I tried this recipe out for the first time this week.  It was a breeze to make and a big hit with the family.  I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and also added cauliflower because I wanted more veggies.  I will definitely be making this again!

This rates closer to 3 1/2 stars. This was definitely one of the easier and tastier ham casseroles I've tried on this site so far. I used just 12 oz. of gluten-free pasta because that was all my package contained. Based on reviews, I bought 2 jars of Alfredo sauce, but because I had less pasta, I used 1 1/2 jars.  In the skillet, it looked like plenty, but after coming out of the oven, it was a tad dry.  Next time, I would add more broccoli and use 2 whole jars. IMHO it was a little bland IMHO, but that may be my Alfredo sauce choice though. I wanted to get the refrigerated kind, but my store didn't have it. Overall an easy and tasty way to use up ham leftovers that I would use again when I have ham leftovers.

We all liked this and it was easy to make.  I used two jars of alfredo sauce -- one definitely would not have been enough for how we like it -- and thought it was just right.

I would give this recipe 3 stars, my kids and hubby give it 4 or even 5.  I felt the dish was way too salty.  If we make this again, we will probably substitute the ham with chicken.

Super easy and delicious recipe. My oldest (10yr) has seconds and my two little ones ate without argument so that’s a win in my house!! •I do agree it needs 2 jars of sauce instead of 1. I used two based on other reviews and it was perfect. •I used fresh-steam in the bag broccoli because that has less water than the frozen. •I added a little garlic powder and Parmesan to the ham/broccoli/sauce portion and melted it in before adding pasta. •And totally agree covering with foil for the first 25 minutes to keep it from drying out worked great. I then uncovered for the last 5 minutes to get that nice top cheese melty. Will absolutely make again!!!

Excellent recipe! Very cheesy and just what I was looking for - comfort food! The only difference is I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen. I found the broccoli was an added touch, it made the dish that much more flavourful!

Yummy :-). I made my own sauce because I had heavy cream I wanted to use up. I also used a mixture of two different sizes of egg noodles and a listle of whole-wheat noodle it called for. I didn't have enough for the recipe, so I decided to use up the ones that had a little left. It was still good. I used whole slices of Colby jack cheese since that was already open. The family loved it.

It was good overall, but I couldn’t find Alfredo sauce in my pantry so I made my own creamy sauce. For that I melted parmesan cheese and added cream and milk. Honestly, I kind of just winged the sauce. Thank you for the recipe!

The recipe is good, but like others who reviewed it, it needs more sauce and cheese, less pasta. I added two cups of cheese instead of one after reading multiple reviews and my husband made extra homemade alfredo sauce but it wasn't enough to offset all the noodles you are supposed to put in the recipe. I also added extra broccoli and put panco breadcrumbs on top right before putting it in the oven. I addd garlic, onions, espelette ( a type of red pepper ), everyday seasoning without salt, and a few of my own secrets. It tasted great but like I mentioned earlier, it either needed less pasta or more sauce. But I would definitely make it again with the recommended changes. It is a keeper.

Family loved it. I made a few modifications, but all of them would have decreased the flavor not added, so this one's good even made as a healthier version. I used: Lentil noodles, nonfat milk, and only 3/4 cup of cheese because I was too lazy to grate more. I also forgot the salt and pepper and skipped the entirety step 4. So basically, I boiled some noodles, threw that and 5 more ingredients into a baking dish, heated it up and my family loved it. It doesn't get better than that!

Easy & very adaptable. You can use one of the recipes on this site for alfredo sauce which are much better than jar.I added some mushrooms just because we like them. Doesn't take a lot of work & could be made ahead of time & put in oven when ready to use.

This dish was a bigger hit with my family than I thought it would be. My three year old even ate it much to my surprise. Only three stars because the dish did not reheat well.

I liked this dish.  It was quick and easy.  I used the Classico roasted garlic alfredo sauce.  In the future I would add more broccoli.  I plan to make this recipe again.

I love this! Great way to use up your leftover leg of ham at Xmas. A great balance of flavours. I used a carbonara sauce instead of Alfredo.

I made it basically as-is, except used all of some packages (more pasta, more broccoli, more alfredo) and found it to be kinda dry.  My picky toddler seemed to love it though, so that was a big win here.  Not sure what I can do next time so it won't be so dried out... maybe turn heat off when adding all ingredients to the sauce?  Will definitely make this again.

practically all the ingredients were out of balance.  (my fault.) had to make a run to the store which made the noodles way too dry so they absorbed way too much.  made the whole thing pretty dry.  flavor was good; just to dry.  will be much better next time.  8^)

It was very good, I used 3/4 cups of milk. If you want it to be creamier and have more of that cheesy flavor, I definitely recommend using more alfredo sauce

I made this for my family and they all loved it! (Except my hubby, it was a bit heavy for him.) I made this twice. The first time, I accidentally added the shredded cheese to the alfredo sauce, but it turned out creamy, cheesy (obviously), and really good. The second time, I added the cheese on top before putting it in the oven, as directed, and it wasn’t as creamy or cheesy, but still delicious.  So next time, I might add just a bit of the cheese into the sauce for that extra cheesy-ness. ??

I made it with shrimp...fully cooked.  I finished with blended Italian cheese and used fresh broccoli that I blanched.  Came out very nice..will do again and likely add some pepper flake to take it up a notch.

This is a quick, easy recipe.  Only complaint is that it was too dry.  I will have to doctor the left overs with more Alfredo sauce tomorrow.  So, if I make it again, I will used two jars of the sauce.

Needs twice as much sauce as the recipe describes.  This was very dry.  I will buy another jar of sauce just to use up the leftovers.

I liked this recipe. First, it was easy to make. Then, since I'm eliminating Gluten from my diet, I only needed to use a gluten-free pasta.  Finally, I had some smoked ham in the freezer from the last ham I smoked. It is so yummy the ham and broccoli could hardly get any better. 

I made it strictly according to the recipe. Next time I make this, I'll try doubling the sauce. It wasn't dry but I think I'd like it better swimming in the sauce.

Leftover rotisserie chicken and sauted kelbassa and sauted cooking onions works well. Fresh lemon over fresh steamed broccoli ... creamcheese and mild marble cheddar melted into low fat milk sprinkle with garlic powder...Oh and finish off with fresh dill..takes it to a whole new level ??Super yummy??

It was ok. Nothing to rave about. It didn’t look like the picture. It was kind of dry. I read where someone increased the amount of milk, so I did too, and I decreased the pasta by 2ounces and also added 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning. But that didn’t really help. I don’t know if I’ll make it again. I used chicken instead of ham as my husband is on a low sodium diet.

This was very yummy. I changed it a little though. Instead of ham I used turkey kielbasa and I added chopped green and red peppers for more color.

Came out great. My oven runs a little hot so I took it out five minutes early. The top got a little crunchy which was somewhat off putting. Otherwise good.

What an excellent, easy recipe!  I did make a number of small changes but stayed true to the heart of the recipe.  I switched out cavatappi for rotini because I have an undying love for cavatappi.  I sautéed half an onion and a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic along with the ham.  I upped the milk to a full cup and both added all of the Colby-jack to the Alfredo sauce and added a 1/2 cup each of Velveeta and Gouda (what I had on hand).  I didn’t cook the broccoli with the sauce since I didn’t want it to get mushy, I just defrosted it and mixed it in with the sauce and pasta at the last minute.  I made sure not to smooth out the top before baking since I wanted plenty of crispy bits and texture.  After the dish had been in the oven for 15 minutes I sprinkled shaved Parmesan and panko over the top and cooked for another 15 minutes.  I decided that I wanted the crispy hits to be a little crispier so I finished it off under the broiler for a couple of minutes.  Excellent and easy- and honestly my changes, though plentiful, really were just little adjustments that took this dish from an acceptable weeknight meal to an excellent one the family couldn’t get enough of!

This was a hit and will be made again. 
I made the Alfredo sauce from scratch (Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce) instead of using the jar only because I didn’t want to go to the grocery store. That added a bit more time to the preparation. And, I used vegetable flavored egg noodles which added a bit more flavor and definitely more color. We had a bit of garden flavored cream cheese left which I mixed with the regular cream cheese that was called for in then Alfredo sauce.
I cut the recipe in half and it still made a generous amount.

This was a fun dish to make, and a great way to use up leftover ham. Unfortunately, the pasta absorbed all of the Alfredo sauce when it baked in the oven. I did enjoy the crust that formed on top, but I was really looking forward to the sauce. Had I served this dish without the oven step it would have been a solid 4 stars.

I did not rely on jarred alfredo sauce, rather, both a jar and rich homemade.  I made two smaller casseroles and shared one with our daughter/husband. The recipe was OK, as I was trying to use up some ham.  Unless something is really exceptional, it gets a three star rating.  I don't inflate grades.

Made this with chicken to cut down on the sodium. Delicious! Added sun dried tomatoes and Italian seasoning,  and topped it off with french fried onions.

My whole family loved this. Only change I made was doubling the cheese - I mixed a cup into the sauce and then put a cup on top as the recipe called for. So good!

I felt this recipe was a little bland. Not sure what flavors to add to get it to a five rating. I added a bit of bacon hoping that would do the trick. Maybe others are right in saying not enough sauce. It certainly wasn't bad tasting, but not worthy of a five.

For a change, I followed the directions.  For me, it came out rather dry.  It needs more Alfredo Sauce.  The family liked it, it comes will their favorite ingredients, It is quick and easy, I’ll add more sauce and remember a little salt and pepper..

I accidentally made this wrong and it turned out well. Instead of a jar of Alfredo, I had a packet of Knorr Alfredo Fettucini, forgetting there's noodles in it. I'd panned on using whole wheat pasta. It turned out the same since this recipe doesn't have a specific alfredo sauce. My husband liked it quite a bit.

This was delicious! Perfect use of leftover holiday ham. I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and tossed it in the boiling water in the last 3 minutes of the pasta cook time. And I don't use jar alfredo sauce. Not since I discovered the Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce recipe on this app. That's all I ever use for alfredo now. I also added a can of fire roasted tomatoes. I did not have issues that I read in other reviews about the casserole being dry. I think the ingredients proportions turned out perfectly.

This recipe was an excellent, and tasty, use of my leftover Easter ham. Prior to making it I read many of the reviewers suggestions. I cut back on the amount of noodles made to around 10 ounces. I had a scallion left so I thinly sliced it a sautéed it in the olive oil prior to adding fresh broccoli and then the ham. I also used half and half instead of the milk for a slightly creamier taste. As another reviewer suggested, I sprinkled some garlic powder as well as some paprika prior to adding some shredded Swiss cheese (the only cheese I had in the fridge) and then topped it with some panko bread crumbs. All in all fairly fast, tasty meal and the best part was I had basically all the needed ingredients on hand so no need to run to the grocery store..yaa for me!

First - the cookies/popups whatever on this site are driving me insane... I can't even access it on my laptop without it freezing up.  That said, this recipe was great as is, once I opened it on my phone.  I didn't quite follow to the letter based on some other reviews - used more like 20 oz of Alfredo sauce and fresh broccoli (it was cooked enough between being in the saucepan and the oven but kids like the veggies more steamed than cooked) and the family LOVED it.  Super easy, great after work dinner.

This was a real hit and I will definitely make it again. I did make a few changes: I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, alfredo sauce with roasted garlic instead of the plain alfredo; and I used a tex mex mixture of cheese (Monterey Jack, pizza mozzarella and medium cheddar). Perfectly delicious!

Fast and easy dinner for sure. I didn't think it was all that flavorful however but it meets the criteria for comfort food. I would add a lot more spices to kick up the flavor- maybe some rosemary.  For my taste, this was a high sodium ok dinner. I'm not I'll make it again.

Am absolutely going to make this over and over.  The ONLY reason I did not give it 5 stars is that there was either too much pasta or not enough sauce.  Other than that, loved the combination.  I also added onion and mushrooms, but we do that with alot of recipes.

We liked this. My family picked around the broccoli (I tried to sneak it in), and my son didn't like that the noodles on top were a little 'crispy'. Next time, I might substitute another veggie or chop the broccoli smaller, and cover with foil before baking to try and keep the top noodles tender...But I liked this as written!

It's an easy worknight type meal. Granted I have made something similar in the past with from scratch alfredo sauce and a few more ingredients. But this is a down and dirty quick meal to whip up. But I also agree that I would go with at least two 15 oz jars of alfredo sauce. And also add onions.

This was good, but needed more sauce.  I would recommend 2 jars of alfredo sauce instead of one.  I added more milk, but wished I had another jar of sauce.  I also used fresh broccoli which I pre-cooked.  The fresh broccoli really added a nicer flavor than frozen broccoli.  I will make this again, but with 2 jars of sauce.

I used a 10 inch skillet, which is my largest one, and it was not nearly big enough. I couldn't fit all the macaroni in. Also, not enough alfredo sauce, especially if you use a bigger skillet.

Nice change of pace from the usual cream of mushroom soup casserole. I used elbow macaroni and light alfredo sauce then added some leftover parmesan cheese. I did add a little more alfredo sauce than the recipe calls for. Delicious! I served it with a nice green salad and it made a wonderful meal. Well worth trying!

Simple and comforting.  The ham was a unique twist from chicken in this casserole.  I  added a small zucchini to boost the veggies a little.  Very good.

After reading the feedback about coverage amounts, I used only 12 oz noodles, put a half clove in the sauce, and topped with shredded parmesaen cheese in addition to Monterey Jack. It's great for packing for lunch, and my husband loved it.

We just made this recipe, and I followed it exactly.  We all thought it was really good.  The only thing I would change about it would be to add extra Alfredo sauce, probably 1 1/2 jars.  It will be on our "go to" menu list for sure.  Simple to make and tasty!

My husband and I really liked this! Made it exactly as listed except that I couldn't find the cheese it called for so we had Colby Cheddar. Both of us had a 2nd helping and definitely will make again.

Wow, what a wonderful dish.  I made my own alfredo sauce out of butter, cream cheese, parmesan and cream plus spices.  I used fresh broccoli, cooked a little in the boiling water before the pasta.  I also used a little shredded swiss cheese along with parm and Colby jack on top. And, I used really good smoked ham.   This dish was super delicious and we will definitely make it over and over.

This was yummy... I have made Alfredo Sauce using distasi's Quick Alfredo Sauce recipe from this site and I only had Spaghettinis at home so I used them... It turned out awesome. No leftovers... I will definitely make it again, especially when I have leftover ham.

My family (including my 4 year old who wont eat any dish that has everything mixed into one) LOVED this dish! They ALL went back for seconds! The only thing that I would do different the next time is to add more Alfredo sauce as there was not enough.

This was way better than I expected it to be!  I did make a couple small changes/additions.  I didn't have rotini, so used the penne pasta I had on hand.  I also made sure to chop the broccoli up pretty well so the kids wouldn't be able to pick it  out or find a reason no to eat it.  Also added a very generous sprinkling of granulated garlic powder and topped it with an equally generous sprinkling of smoked paprika.  Not sure what made this so good - maybe the sauteeing of the ham and broccoli, the added spices....?  My youngest son liked it so much that he had two servings that night (he never, ever takes seconds) and helped himself to some more in the morning.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Very good with left over ham from Easter. Used 2 jars of Alfredo sauce, a whole 16oz bag of broccoli, added grated Parmesan cheese and more milk and garlic pepper.  Used pepper jack and Italian cheese blend on the top. Whole family loved it!

I thought it was great!! I made the Alfredo sauce, steamed some fresh broccoli because that's what I had on hand and used left over ham I had from Sunday dinner. Even with those changes it was still easy. Will definitely fix this again. Thanks!!

This is delicious and easy!!  The only changes I made were using Shredded Mozzarella instead of Monterey Jack cheese, and using lots more of the Alfredo Sauce.

I thought it was a lot of steps for a casserole though, you're doing twice the amount of cooking since you're cooking everything before you put it together, then bake it even more. I doubled the  ham.  One jar of Alfredo sauce was't enough.  And not all of the noodles fit, so only used about 3/4 of the noodles.  Overall, it's a tasty dish, and I still recommend as my entire family really enjoyed it.

I tweaked this a little, only subbing in small raviolis for the pasta.  My grandsons (and the rest of the family) woofed it down and asked if I could make it again soon (always a good sign :-)

I thought this was fantastic, and my 17-mo old and 3yr old both gobbled it down.  Hubs thought it was "not bad".  I followed the recipe but did saute an onion with the ham, and threw some chopped frozen spinach in with the broccoli.  I used Aldi's regular creamy alfredo sauce, and a box of their tri-colored rotini noodles.  I will definitely make this again and again.  I could have scarfed down the whole pan by myself.  I also made it the night before and stuck it in the fridge until we were ready to bake it.  I bet you could probably freeze it for later too.

Absolutely wonderful!    I followed the recipe as given except I made my own Alfredo Sauce.  Everyone in the family requested that I make it again.  The entire casserole went - no leftovers.  This is a keeper!

I made this tonight but had to make changes per my fridge and pantry.  Had no Alfredo sauce so used Progresso Recipe Makers Cheese sauce and instead of the Colby mix, I used Swiss.  The Swiss cheese really make it for us. Simple and tasty!   I will make it again but I will use the Progresso and swiss.

Very good and easy recipe, I did add in some onion with the ham. Since it was just for the two of us, I used half the amount of pasta, but used the full amount of alfredo sauce and milk, and it was just right.

Instead of jarred sauce, I used an Alfredo package mix. I will cover with foil while baking next time since the top layer of pasta dried/hardened without it.

We really enjoyed this. It was best before it hit the oven, in my opinion. Next time I will be using more Alfredo Sauce, or a bit less of everything else. All in all a GREAT cassarole.

Quick and easy. My family loved this recipe. I added chopped garlic to meat and broccoli. Also added parmesan cheese to water and Alfredo sauce. Delicious!

I used fresh broccoli and cauliflower and leftover ham.  Read through reviews and tried double sauce & (1%) milk.  All 4 of us enjoyed it!

Certainly used more ham than what was listed & worked greatly; Alfredo sauce also used was good, too, since the jar was 16.9 oz.

It was ok. It wasn't as tasty as I thought it would be. It was actually better cold-I had leftovers, which is not usual around my house. It is very light if you serve as a main meal. Next time I will use as a side dish, or serve with a salad.

We loved this! My family is gluten intolerant, so I couldn't use the canned alfredo sauce, but to accomodate, I made a roux out of potato flour, butter and milk then added milk a little at a time to keep it from lumping, until I had enough white sauce to cover the pasta. Then I added shredded mozzarella a little at a time to the white sauce until it was as thick and cheesy as I wanted then seasoned with salt and pepper. I subbed peas for broccoli, as I had no broccoli, and used Hormel Natural Choice sliced deli ham instead of regular ham, as I cannot eat the average ham (bummer). All in all it turned out wonderful, just a little under-spiced because I made too much sauce and under spiced the cheese sauce! Next time I will adjust my spices. So, five stars anyway, and this one goes in my recipe binder permanently!

UPDATE: June 2014-I reduced pasta to 8oz and used one jar of Bertolli Light Garlic Alfredo Sauce. Very successful taste and fewer leftovers.
We had this New Year's Day 2013 and everyone enjoyed it.  The changes I made were to use fresh broccoli and one and one-half jars of alfredo sauce.
