Very good.  I checked the jell-o website for this recipe, and many people commented the difficulty and unruliness of this recipe.  It is really simple though.  Make the first layer, heat the peanut butter in the microwave to easily spread it.  Top with chocolate chips and peanuts and then break up the reserved topping into small pieces instead of taking the time to roll it out.  Very good bars.
