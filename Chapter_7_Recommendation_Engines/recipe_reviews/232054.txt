This recipe definitely needs TWEEKED!!!  The finished product definitely does not look like the picture.  Made this for a bake sale and had to turn up empty handed because of the appearance.

This was delicious. I did make a couple of changes. I didn't have butterfingers, but I remembered they were made with Captain Crunch Cereal, so I added Capt. Crunch instead of the cereal and candy bars. I also bumped up the peanut butter to 1/2 cup and the pretzels up to 2 cups (since I was taking out the Chex) to make it more nutritious, and sent them with my hubby on an eight day bike ride. All his friends thought I was wonderful!
