An excellent recipe. Directions are clear and easy to follow. Easy to make! The scrambled eggs are so fluffy and my family loved them. I would double the jalapeno because we like our eggs a bit more spicy!

Pretty good recipe! Used leftover dinner ham and loved the addition of the jalapeño. Next time I’ll add two because we like heat. Served with seasoned home fries and everyone liked it a lot.

Excellent and the pepper can be reduced or eliminated depending on the heat tolerance of the diners.  

Generally, I take a ham and do a "double smoke" where it is again smoked in a cooker.  I generally use mesquite.  It gives it a little stronger smoke flavor.  Don't over do it or it gets bitter.
