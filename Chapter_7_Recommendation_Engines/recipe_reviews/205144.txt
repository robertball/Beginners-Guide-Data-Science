YUM! It smells delicious & looks amazing! I served it over just plain white rice & my family loved it! I used triple the amount of the asian dressing though! And the oj wasn't very stong so next time I'm going to use oj concentrate. Overall a wonderful dish though!I also added some minced garlic!

I wound up having to add garlic powder, dehydrated orange peel, dehydrated onion, and crushed red pepper to this dish in order to perk up the flavor some, and it loses a star for that. Otherwise, this was tasty if you have the ingredients around, but not really something I'll go buy that dressing for again. The sauce, while tasty, isn't enough to use over rice, and I also doubled it. It looked like it was going to be enough, but after about 20 mins waiting for the hubs to get home the sauce reduced or congealed or something and wasn't enough for the rice. This has the potential to be really tasty however, and the directions were very clear and easy to follow. All in all, glad I gave it a shot :-) Thanks!

The sauce wasn't strong enough....and I doubled it, however, the flavor that was there was very good. I added some minced garlic as well and also marinated the chicken for about an hour in the orange juice & dressing sauce. Very easy to make which I loved! A new kind of stir fry for our house.

I have to agree with most of the reviews but, I will keep the recipe around for another try. I intend to reduce the orange juice by 25%, add garlic, and red pepper flakes, and will add cornstarch. I think all of those suggestions will perk up the flavor a bit.

One thingI did different was this; the store was out of brocolli flourets.... but they had brocolli, carrots, and snow peas. OMG, yum!

Fast easy and delicious.  Even my daughter who wont eat anything ate it.  I used the leftovers the next morning to make breakfast burittos and they were a huge hit.  Just added it to scrambled eggs, with a little salsa and pepperjack cheese in a tortilla!

Decent low-cal dish, but a bit bland.  Pass extra dressing around!

Wow!!! Awesome dish! After reading other reviews I used concentrate instead of juice and I used about a cup, but I doubled the recipe. Also I could not find the asian dressing so used a garlic herb one in its place. I will be looking for the dressing to use next time. My daughter loved it and she is a picky eater. My 4 year old son liked it too and hubby went for seconds. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I made this for my family tonight and all I have to say is OMG!!!! I took the suggestions made and did quadruple the orange juice and I also used Wishbone light Asian sesame & Ginger vinaigrette dressing! I also added some minced garlic (1/2 tsp) and soy sauce (about 1-1/2 tbsp). This helped tremendously as the sauce was a little bland. After adding veggies, in a separate bowl I took another 1/4 c of orange juice, 2tbs of dressing, 1 tbsp of cornstarch, and 1 tbsp of soy sauce and mixed together. I then poured onto the skillet and the sauce thickened just just! Great flavors! Will be making this again!!!

This was fantastic. The flavors were outstanding. I followed other reviewer's suggestion and doubled the asian dressing and orange juice. Also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs as that is what I had already thawed. Even better the next day!

I liked the combination of veggies in this dish. The sauce had little to no flavor though and there is no sauce in there when you are done cooking it. I even used orange juice concentrate instead of juice, but no luck. Next time I make this, I will just use the basic stir fry part of it and make my own sauce.

The picture shows tomato, cucumber and carrots but nowhere do I see them in the ingredients, not to mention there's no rice in this recipe for a rice bowl!!!!!  It seems very common on this site to publish unrelated pictures with recipes and it's very frustrating.

The flavor was okay.  A better sauce would make this recipe tastier.  However, a plus, is that it was very easy to make.

The initial amount of dressing did not give much flavor.
