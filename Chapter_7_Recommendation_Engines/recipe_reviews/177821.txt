Having said that, I used pork/venison sausage instead of the sweet Italian it called for and I wish I hadn't.  I think this dish needs the sweetness to offset the saltyness of the rest of the ingredients. I couldn't find Cream of Brocoli and settled for Cream of Brocoli and Cheese.  I used a package of Wacky Mac instead of the spirals to bring more color to the dish.  I did add a bit more milk (about 1/2 c.) because my broccoli (which was fresh, not frozen) just didn't have enough liquid to cook.  Overall it wasn't that bad but I won't be making it again.  Why? My 3 year old daughter only ate the sausage and the oldest, a 5 yr. old, tried it and wouldn't touch anymore (she's usually a good eater).  My 1 year old ate the macaroni okay but it wasn't the ideal dish for a youngster with few teeth.  It's worth trying if you have nothing else to cook and have the ingredients on hand.  Maybe it was just a personal preference and your family will like it.  But I won't be making it again.  Always like to try new recipes, though, so thanks for the post!

Very good and easy. Just cut sausage up into desired size before browning, then don't have to worry about breaking it up. Used 3 cloves garlic, added some pepper and need a little more milk to achieve a boil after adding broccoli, etc. but no biggie. Followed 99.9% to a "t" and it was a bit hit- asked to makes again.

This recipe was good, but not quite what I had expected. Perhaps it was because I didn't make it quite right. Instead of the straight cream of broccoli, I used broccoli and cheese, and I forgot to add the parmesan. I think that the broccoli and cheese, with its cheddar flavor, was too much contrast from the Italian sausage. Also, I think if I had used a more spicy and less sweet Italian sausage it would have had a better flavor as well.
This recipe is good for an easy meal after a long day at work and isn't bad for being a Campbell's one.

Excellent! It pleased the whole family-big flavor, so easy! I did use fresh broccoli that I steamed in the microwave for 2 minutes before adding to the skillet. I used 4 cloves minced garlic. 4-1/2 cups cooked rotini is 2-1/4 cups  uncooked. 1/2 cup uncooked rotini is equal to 1 cup cooked. I had to look this up, so in case anyone else is wondering-  It ended up being a little more than half a 16 ounce box of rotini. This recipe was rated 5 stars by everyone tonight, will make this again soon!

We really enjoyed this recipe tonight. The only things I changed was that I used a head of fresh broccoli and whole wheat pasta. This was very easy to prepare and tasted great! My three year old ate it really well so I will be making this again sometime. This went great with garlic bread and a green salad.

Made this tonight and the whole family loved it.  A few differences I tried just because it was what I had on hand:  Used half ground beef and half sausage, and also used fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  About 1/4 tsp garlic powder instead of fresh.  It was really yummy, even my sons liked it.

This had a lot of flavor and I would make it again.  I only used 1.5 cups of pasta however, as that was all I had and it turned out to be the perfect amount.  I thik it would be too bland and dry with 4.5 cups pasta.  I also accidentally omitted the milk, but it wasn't needed.

This was really good. I used Italian chicken sausage, penne pasta, and fresh broccoli because it was all I had and it turned out great. Because I used fresh broccoli I simmered the sauce an extra two minutes just to be sure it would be cooked all the way through. Nice hot meal perfect for throwing together after work.

The pasta got really mushy after only a couple of hours in the refrigerator. I had a hard time breaking up the sausage meat too, but I think thats because I defrosted it in the microwave.

This was very quick and easy and the family loved it.  The only change i made was to use fresh brocccoli that I steamed for a few minutes over the boiling pasta. And I used Cream of Mushroom soup because that's what I had on hand.

Not bad. I made a double batch. I used cream of celery and brocolli cheese soup with one cup milk.  Lots of pepper.  Hubby didn't complain as he ate it.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  We used mild italian sausage instead of the sweet sausage the recipe calls for.  Even with that it definitley needed the crushed red pepper for more zip.  We really loved the leftovers the next day as well.  This was very simple.

I doubled the broccoli, and it could've used a little more sausage, but I may have used more pasta than was called for.  Everybody loved it

This was okay. I have to say though that I didn't have cream of broccoli on hand so I used cream of chicken.  I wasn't a big fan of the sweet flavor that the broccoli/onion combo had with the sausage. On my own plate I added a sprinkle of lime juice and really liked the extra zest.

Both my husband and I loved it.  We used Jimmy Dean hot ground sausage instead of the sweet sausage.  Because we used the hot sausage, we didn't use any of the crushed red pepper.  Will definitely make again.

Welllll......I used hot bulk sausage instead of sweet.  Didn't have any cream of brocolli so I used Cream of Onion.  Used Cheddar instead of Parmesan and I don't normally use a measure cup so I used 1/2 soup can of milk.  Oh..and Penne instead of corkscrews....my family loved it. :)
