EXCELLENT! One of the things that I did different: After I removed all of the skin and the meat after the roasting time of the chicken - I roasted the bones and the veggies from the pot (I added more onions, carrot and celery) on an oiled baking sheet and baked them at 400°F for ~ 30 minutes so to extract a richer flavor from the bones and the veggies. I followed the remainder of the recipe except I substituted a large dried bay leaf in place of the thyme, added some fresh celery leafs from a celery bunch and black peppercorns after all of the foam and fat had been skimmed off. I never omit bay leafs, celery leafs or peppercorns when I make a broth/stock. I was leery of using ketchup in a broth but I used the Hunts® brand of ketchup because it doesn’t have any high fructose corn syrup in it. Note: I wash off the dirt but I never pare carrots nor peel the outside skin off of onions for making broth/stock because I strive for all of the natural flavor and color that I can get into a broth/stock. After all, the broth is strained well and the bones seasonings and veggies are discarded at the end. The end result was perfect for my tastes and the ketchup added a surprisingly nice touch of flavor to the broth.

I like this Stock recipe a lot - I do however like to roast the chicken pieces before simmering.  The long slow simmer is essential to a really good Stock.  This can be done in the crock pot or stove top.  This makes canned stock pale in comparision.  Enjoy.

Easy and the smell was amazing as it cooked! I used a full chicken carcass that I froze to be used for stock. The carcass was from Spicy Rapid Roast Chicken from this site. I also added some fresh cracked pepper. After simmering all day and like I said the smell was intoxicating....it lended a very flavorful rich stock that was deep with color. I tasted it and it was delicious. It is now in the freezer for future use. Thanks!

Being a cook who already makes my own stocks, I decided to follow Chef John's recipe to the letter for comparison. His recipe produced a great stock with a fine depth of flavor. I live in an area with many butcher shops, not just supermarkets with pre-packaged meats, so obtaining backs and necks is easy and very inexpensive. The 5th star would have been given if Chef John had done as I do and added 4 chicken feet to the mix for more collagen and nutrition. Thanks John, I always read your recipes.

This makes a high quality low sodium broth.  I have made it many, many times and here are some tips.
1.  Watch the video. 
2. The printed recipe doesn't include the 8 peppercorns that he uses in the video.
3. Don't scrimp too much on the time.  12 hours is good but 10 hours is okay as well.  Don't go too much below that.
4. Don't stir it. You'll make it cloudy.  Leave it alone.  It will be fine.
5. Pour it out slowly and carefully.  Don't ladle it out.  Don't try to drain out that last bit with the chicken crumbs in it.
6.  If you want that beautiful red color use yellow onions.  Use the ones with the rust colored skin.
7.  Don't fret over "backs and necks".  Use what chicken bones that you have. When whole chickens are on sale I get a couple, break them down and use the whole carcass for my broth.  I like to debone the thighs so I throw those bones in as well.  wing tips or whole wings are fine too.
8. Skim the scum, skim the scum, skim the scum.
9. It lasts for months in the freezer.

I could not find a package of chicken necks and backs, I did have a 3-ish pound package of chicken parts that I used instead. I did add a good amount of dried parsley and fresh ground pepper. This was exactly what I needed--it was simple to execute and it cost a fraction of what one quart cost me of the name brand chicken broth.

I make my own chicken stock and can it. I use leftover bits of veggies such as carrots, onions, onion peels, celery ends, tomatoes, cucumbers etc...that I have thrown into a freezer bag and freeze and use when it gets full......no broccoli or cabbage though- it overwhelms the flavor. I also use chicken feet- it makes a wonderful gelatinous golden stock! I use about 8 pounds of feet, some chicken backs and veggies along with fresh thyme, bay leaves, peppercorns, salt and some garlic. Best stock ever- very cheap and much healthier than the stuff you can buy at the grocery. You can also keep the sodium WAY down this way:) I recommend lots of chicken feet for a gelatinous, velvety rich stock. Sometimes I just throw it all into a very large stock pot and cover with water and simmer for a day or 2, sometimes I roast it all first on a baking sheet w/ a drizzle of olive oil over for an hour at 350, then throw it all in the stock pot and cover with water. The unroasted stock is lighter golden and the roasted stock is much darker and richer- either way is delicious! I keep both types on hand that I have canned- about 30 quarts total at any given time. Delicious!

Can I just say that when I make bone broths I add a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar this is to extract all the goodness from the bones including collagen, I like to roast my bones first with the vege, into the crockpot on low and let it doe its' thing for at least 12 to 20 hours. If you don't let the broth 'boil' I find it does not need to be skimmed, just a very gentle simmer. :-)

Very nice with good flavor. When my dried spices like various Italian type get outdated I put them all together in a jar and use them for stock or other sauces. I put the spices in a larger tea ball and put it into the cooking stock. Adds a nice flavor to the stock. Pull the ball out when the stock is ready and discard the spices. When the stock has cooled I use a French Chinois. It is a very fine sieve to strain the stock. I use the same tea ball when I make corned beef. I put the corned beef spices in the ball while it is cooking in the water that way they are not all over the meat and cabbage but still get the flavor easy peasy.

Just threw it all in the slow cooker late last night, on low. This morning, the stock smelled delicious and I was able to skim off the scum. I used chicken thighs and drums. 12 hours total cooking time and the result is a very delicious stock. Next time, I'll try roasting the chicken first.  I was able to fill 4 pint jars, 2 (10 oz) jars and a little under 1 quart sized jar. These bad boys will be stored in the freezer.  Thanks for another great and fail proof recipe!

All I could taste was onion.  Added some salt which just made the onion more pronounced.  Added some chicken base which didn't do much.

I followed the recipe exactly as indicated. The broth tasted really good in the soup, but it was way too much work. I expected the taste to be great, and it was only good. And the ingredients were expensive for the amount of broth it yielded. The broth only made  4 bowls of soup. In the future I will use the soup recipe, but buy store bought broth or stock.  I won't be making this broth recipe again. Four stars for taste, one star for effort and cost equates to a two star overall rating for me.

I like to make it with bones., necks, backs, etc.  A trick I learned from my Grandmother, who grew up in the 1930 (depression) is that they would save their egg shells to throw in too.  Then add 1-2 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar.  The vinegar  will extract more minerals from the shells & bones.  She also taught me that if you take a bone out and you can't easily snap it in half, then it's not done.

Makes a rich stock with complex flavor instead of just plain chicken and salt.  The addition of ketchup is magic!

This was the best chicken broth! I followed the recipe exactly except I used a whole cut up chicken (what I had on hand). Due to a family member having strict dietary restrictions (no gluten, wheat, soy, eggs, or sugar) I had to cook everything from scratch and this was perfect for use when menu items called for water or broth. After I let it cool, I put it in a one gallon jug and froze it until I was ready to use it. What I didn't use for Thanksgiving I threw in a soup pot along with the turkey carcass and made turkey soup. I am making another batch now however this time instead of using thyme, I am going to try 1T. basil.

Nothing beats a homemade stock.  If you are using this for soup, add 1-2 bone in breasts for meat.  Follow the rest the same.  When the stock is finished chunk up the breast meat, add cooked diced celery and carrot, and small pasta like acini di pepi or thin egg noodles.

When I first made the broth I was concerned about the ketchup and I could taste it which put me off.  But I let the broth sit a couple days before actually making the soup. During that time the flavors developed and it was outstanding.  Chef John's chicken soup also watch top notch!

Made with leftover Turkey carcass, so I made a bigger batch. I just put about 10 cups of broth in the freezer but it made the house smell so good I had to use some to make some soup right away! Thanks

I made this exactly as the recipe says. It is a thick, rich stock with a beautiful color. I would probably not make it again although it’s simple, 12 hrs on the stove for one qt of stock is not worth it.

Very basic.  I use the whole chicken carcass after having a roasted chicken.  I didn't have to go for 12 hours though, only about 5 hours.  The flavor is super chickeny.

Made my third batch of stock this week using this delicious recipe!  Thank you Chef John and for the chicken soup recipe!  This has been my go to recipe for cold winter nights and the cold/flu season.

I used the carcass from the turkey that remained after I de-boned it to make the Chef John’s Boneless Whole Turkey recipe.  I simmered it for 10 hours.   I then used some of the stock to make Chef John’s Turkey Tom Kha Gai and I froze the rest.

No changes. Full flavor stock. I've made 4 times. Instead of fresh chicken I've also have used roasted chicken bones. Yummy

Loved this! I'm a novice to making broths and stocks but making this made me feel like a chef. The recipe yields such a flavorful stock which gives any soup or stew another level of depth to the flavor. I love making extra and freezing the rest to have it on-hand anytime. 

Also, watch the video of Chef John making this recipe. He give you some extra tips about the process that isn't in the directions. Also, he's funny.

GOOD  I did this in slow cooker. I used chicken wings.
I wish I had put in some parsley and peppercorns.
Next time. I made for chicken noodle soup tomorrow.

Makes excellent stock and the wife and I usually use one batch for won ton soup and the rest for other dishes.   The only variation is that normally I use dried thyme as I don't have the fresh handy.

I save all onion ends and pieces and celery ends and leaves along with chicken bones, skins, etc.    I cook all of this (with the seasonings suggested) for hours and end up with a very concentrated rich broth.  So much more flavor than the chicken broth in cans and boxes. ETA: I now do this in a pressure cooker in a fraction of the time.  I often see reviews for other recipes that have chicken stock as a primary ingredient where the reviewer complains of lack of taste.  Using that yellow watery stuff that comes in cans will do that.

This is somewhere between OK to kinda good.... but could use a bit more depth and flavor. I would add  2 more celery w/leaves, 2 more carrots,  another clove or 2 Garlic ...another 4 sprigs fresh thyme and some fresh parsley sprigs..  Instead of going out añd buying necks and backs,  I usually use saved (and roasted ) carcasses or saved bones that I keep frozen till I have appx 4 ish pounds.. Then roast them @400  X40 min. If for some reason I did not have any  saved bones or not enough  ( VERY rare)  then I use leg /  thigh chicken  ( skin off)They are sold as 1 connected piece ( chicken quarters) often includes some  back bone  and often the cheapest cut to buy.  Try Chef John's Roasted Chicken Broth and take advice of some reviews to roast the bones. again ...adding more veg and herbs. This recipe is a good place to start....just up the veggies and herbs to give it more flavor.

This is better than Swanson's when you have the time to do it. The only thing I changed was that I roasted 2 whole chickens instead of the one that the recipe calls for. Then I used both carcasses for the stock. I also followed the advice of another reviewer and gave the leftover chicken to my dog. She was happy! This recipe makes two quarts of stock. It's so good that  you can drink this hot as is.
