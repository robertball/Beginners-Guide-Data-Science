Very easy and quick to make! I used white wheat flour and blueberry flavored yogurt instead of sour cream(what I had on hand).  Made half the recipe and got a dozen muffins in my pan.  Will make again, Thanks!

Excellent!  Another Chef John triumph!  I made half a batch and came out with nine muffins.  I followed the recipe's ingredients as written.  After adding the first half of the flour, I dumped the blueberries into the remaining flour mixture and then added that to the batter by hand, just folding it in.  Halfway through I sprinkled on a touch of sprinkling sugar, but next time I'll do that before baking--just to give them a little sparkle on top.  Thanks, Chef John!

These are very good.  I ended up with 24 muffins instead of only 16 and only needed about 23 minutes or so in my oven.  I know that the muffin pan sizes vary so if you end up with more than 16, start checking after 20 minutes to make sure you don't over bake these.

These muffins were wonderful!  I used the zest of one lemon, but didn't want to waste the rest of the lemon.  When the muffins came out of the oven, I mixed up a simple, thin glaze using the lemon juice and some powdered sugar (maybe 3/4 cup?) and drizzled over the warm muffins.  This took them over the top!

These blueberry muffins are EXCELLENT but only bake them for 18-20 minutes  (depending on your oven). I baked them at 375 and they were perfect at 20 minutes. I'd only recommend 30 minutes if you really like the taste of blueberry flavored charcoal. Made these to bring to work and they were a huge hit. Loved this recipe - reduce the cooking time.

Nice crust, good color, great flavor, even using 1 tsp. of lemon zest.  That was enough for me.  These would be beautiful with an egg wash and some sugar sprinkled on the top.  Before I added the second half of dry ingredients, I sprinkled some of the mix over the blueberries, to keep the color from spreading.

I've made many blueberry muffin recipe's and this is my favorite one. When I first made this recipe and did a taste test on the first batch of warm muffins, it was good but not much different than other recipes. It was after putting my muffins in the fridge and having one with my coffee the next morning that I realized these were a better muffin. They were so moist and even more full of flavor the next day. My husband and kids really liked them and said they were my best muffin yet. I think I will stick to this recipe. Thanks Chef John :-)

These were okay but not exceptional - the consistency was less like a muffin and more like a cupcake.  The taste was good and we enjoyed the extra blueberries but I probably won't make this recipe again.

These muffins are not overly sweet and it truly allows the blueberries to shine in this recipe. I really liked the hint of lemon also. Very nice texture and crumb. Thanks Chef John!

I cut this recipe by half. I "soured" the milk with a teaspoon of lemon juice and I did increase the blueberries by another half cup. Even reduced by half, I did get 12 muffins that were a bit on the smaller size. Baked at 350*, they were done at just over 20 minutes.  The muffins were slightly sweet with a nice tang from the sour cream and lemon zest. I'm glad I added more blueberries, 1 1/2 cups was perfect for us.

I just made these muffins for my family and they were a huge hit!  Took a little longer than other recipes I have used but very worth it.  Very moist and delicious on inside and great crust too.  I did sprinkle a little sugar on the top.   Definitely became my #1 blueberry muffin recipe!!

I tried these because of all the positive reviews, but was very disappointed in this recipe.  The muffins were dry, not at all sweet & glaringly bland.  I couldn't even taste the lemon zest.  I definitely won't be making these again.

I enjoy baking and have never made blueberry muffins before until now. WOW! They turned out great!! Fantastic when served warm with some butter on them. I also added some granulated sugar on the tops of the muffin before baking.... yummy!!! I will recommend this recipe to everyone!!

Only changes were to use low fat blueberry yogurt in place of sour cream, as well as frozen Maine blueberries in place of regular fresh blueberries.  This made 24 regular-sized muffins, and I baked for only 20 min, rotating pans half-way through.  The lemon zest is a must.

Perfect, moist, sweet enough, but not too sweet.  Simple, yet tastes like you spent hours.

Great muffins! I used thawed frozen blueberries and I got 21 muffins. The only thing I see missing, that I didn't realize until after I made them is vanilla. It has to go into all my baking.

I really like these muffins and the extra blueberry "kick" to them. But, I thought they were rather dry. I would probably add on a bit more sour cream or milk. They are definitely worth the experiment.

I made these muffins exactly as stated in the recipe and it ended up making 21 muffins. The taste was good but not excellent. They were a little bland and my family said they were lacking something. They said they weren't sweet enough.

I halved this recipe and substituted the sour cream for plain Greek yogurt since it's all I had on hand. I also used whole wheat flour instead of white. I then sprinkled the tops with a cinnamon and sugar mixture prior to placing in the over. Baked for 23 mins, made 8 muffins. Yum!

Fabulous! I used blueberry & blackberry yogurt + lemon juice in place of the sour cream, and cut back on the sugar. I used ½ whole wheat flour and made a lemon glaze for them. Simple, light, fluffy and delicious. Cupcake like in texture. Thank you!!!

I've made these several times and they've always come out good. Today, they were excellent!  I think I measured more closely and used the sour cream instead of sour milk. I watched the video first and it says not to over mix. That's another key to good texture.

I made these the first time for my wife. She absolutely loved them! 
I used lime zest for a more tangy bite. They were wonderful. Now I have to make them at least once a week... I guess I had better get back into my kitchen.

Delicious! I made jumbo sized muffins and got 10 out of the recipe. I sprinkled the tops w/ coarse sugar before baking for crunch and a little extra sweetness. LOVED the addition of the lemon zest...great compliment to the blueberries! Will def make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Excellent! (As usual for Chef John!) These blueberry muffins were stuffed with blueberries. They were slightly less sweet than traditional muffins but tasted excellent. I had to decrease the baking time so make sure you are checking the muffins periodically.

These are pretty good ! I used frozen blueberries because I didn't have fresh. I may try a a couple minutes less next time as they could've been a more moist:)

Very good.  Used lite sour cream.  I split the recipe in 1/2 and recipe made 11 regular sized muffins.  Also, I sprinkled with cinnamon mixed with sanding sugar toward the last 10 mins of baking for a nice topping.

This recipe was amazing! They were incredibly moist and addictive. I used about 1 3/4 blueberries because we ate some ahead of time. Perfect amount! I have to resist making this too often because they will get me into trouble with calories!

Perfect!! My first really good muffins. This video is really helpful and the recipe is easy to follow and the result is great. Delicious muffins! One trick is to put into the fridge the muffins during half an hour more or less, before taking them to the oven.

Probably the best blueberry muffin recipe I've ever tried. I didn't have any lemons to zest, so I added a dash of almond extract and loved it.

These were not what I expected when I saw the name muffins. If you are looking for a sweet muffin, this is not the recipe for you. These were more like shortcakes with the fruit baked in and would be perfect with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.

This recipe was fantastic. My grandparents came over and I made them for the family, and they loved them! Definitely some of the best blueberry muffins I have EVER had. I followed the recipe as it said, and they turned out goooorgeous, especially if you watch the video that accompanies. They are good both hot and cooled, and I am definitely in love with this recipe. I have had four this morning and I'm not sorry. I had enough mix for two dozen muffins, and after two hours there are about seven left!! They are definitely great muffins, and I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

These are great!  I made 18 muffins, and baked for about 22 minutes.  The lemon is perfect and the texture is just slightly cakey--yummy.  I might sprinkle with sugar before baking next time.  Hubby loved them--this is a keeper!  Thanks, Chef John.

The  muffins were good. I added into the recipe 1 tsp. of lemon extract along with the lemon zest to enhance the lemon flavor. It was not very sweet, so I dusted it with powdered sugar. I made 6 muffins because that was the size of my muffin pan and the  rest of the batter  I baked it in an 8" square pan. My husband thought it tasted more like a bread. I have to agree. A little bit of butter and honey would be perfect.

Highly recommend. Ever since I've found this recipe I don't use any other. I've made this one with blueberries, with chocolate chips and cocoa powder and even with rhubarb - always perfect. I also sometimes make it into one big cake, this is the way everyone in my family loves it the most. Watch the video, before you start backing!!!

These were good, but not anything to rave about.  The texture is like cake, but they aren't as sweet as cake.  Actually, if I make them again, I will probably add a little more sugar (surprising for me because I usually have to reduce the amount of sugar in recipes for my tastes).

Delightful muffins, moist, light, not too sweet. My only change and not sure if it is a big deal or not, but I had no milk, so I used buttermilk. Other than that I followed this recipe as directed, they made a batch of 12 generous sized fluffy muffins. Took to a dinner party and everyone said they were fabulous.

I made three substitutions, white whole wheat flour(which I always use), cranberries, and greek yogurt (for the sour cream). The base of this recipe has really nice flavor and I'm sure I will use it again with other mix-ins. Mine didn't brown at all. I halved the recipe and got 10 muffins that baked for 20 min at 350 in my convection oven.

These muffins turned out great, just a bit dry like many other reviews stated, but still warrant a 4-star rating.  Full disclosure, I did substitute fat free plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream, so perhaps that affected it. The second time I made these, I added a half cup of applesauce, and the texture was then perfect.

Made these for my son to share with his friends at homeschool coop.  The kids loved them! Filled the cups to the hilt like chef John said and got 18 muffins out of the batter.  Loved biting into lots of blueberries and the hint of lemon was really nice.  My oldest son said they tasted like blueberry cupcakes, which in kid language is a very good thing.

Eye appealing. Could be sold in a bakery. Taste good and not heavy. Blueberries are a must and add to the beauty.  Batter was larger than anticipated and the consistency was perfect.  31 muffins cooked.  Sprinkle sugar on top to add a little more sweetness.

I gave 4 stars because I didn't have some ingredients in the recipe so I substituted and used raspberry yogurt instead of sour cream and orange zest instead of lemon zest and added a tsp of vanilla.  Everything else the same. Recipe made 18 muffins and turned out quite good and beautiful but a little on the dry side.

This recipe makes lots of batter and could easily be cut in half..... or  just freeze the extras. Easy to make. Prep time was minimal with minimal mess. I used only 1 cup of blueberries (all I had on hand) and they still came out nice. I added 1 tbsp of dried lemon peel in place of the lemon zest and these are just perfect! I used a mini-muffin tin and made a total of 48 bite-size muffins that are perfect for a snack, small dessert, for lunches, etc. We'll keep half out and freeze individually the rest.  I did notice that the batter was quite stiff so I thinned it down just a bit with extra milk to make spooning it easier using the two spoon method to drop into the smaller cupcake tins.

I didn't have any baking powder,  so I used  1 tsp baking soda.
I also used 1,5 cups of brown sugar instead of 1 cup of white sugar.
The muffins came out very fluffy, soft  and light with a  lovely  juicy berry flavour.
YES! I'll make them again!!!
Family loved them!
Thank you!!!

Sprinkled a small amount of cinnamon sugar on top before baking and also used dried blueberries - my fresh had gone south before I could use them up for this recipe. Next time, will use the fresh. Very good - not too sweet which is nice! Thanks, Chef John!

I ended up with 12 huge muffins and used all of the time indicated for baking. I only had half the butter, so I made up the difference with extra oil. I used Concord grapes instead because that’s what I had to use up and I’d read that some folks make muffins with them. I added a smidge of lemon juice to the batter since I didn’t have that much zest. I made the rest of the juice into a kind of simple glaze with sugar, since, like another reviewer, I didn’t want to waste it! I like tart favours, so this worked for me. I have to wait for them to cool to give a non-fresh-from-the-oven review... oven-fresh is always good and I’ve eaten two for dinner to celebrate my baking.

Great recipe.  I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup (I don't like super sweet muffins).  I also used tofutti (non-dairy sour cream) instead of the dairy version.  The dough consistency seemed off and it had a strange smell in the oven.  However, they turned out great and smelled good when done.  Perfect sweetness.

These turned out very pretty but tasting too much like a biscuit. I think there’s just too much baking powder in them. Next time I’ll try 1 teaspoon instead of 1 tablespoon. I did substitute part of the sour cream with a blueberry yogurt I had on hand, and I added pecans. That was a good upgrade.

The muffins are very very good. I used lemon juice in place of lemon extract(1/2 teaspoon).
Did not use paper liners, I prefer firm edges.
Not cupcakes so not very sweet. A good breakfast muffin.

I sprinkled turbinado sugar in each cup of the baking pan before adding batter. Also sprinkled some on top of the muffin batter. Adds to the crust of the muffin.

Hands down the best. I make them with blueberries or raspberries ( these are Raspberries). I trade out sour cream for yogurt and that is yummy too. Have fun these are great ! And it makes 16 good size muffins.

You don't want it to sweet but the sugar to flour ratio is off. Not enough sugar to the 3 cups flour it calls for. I double and triple checked the recipe just to make sure I was following directions and by the time I was done mixing 3 cups  of flour into the mix it was riding the beaters like a bread dough. Will definitely try again but make some adjustments.

I hate to change a recipe before trying it for the first time but I had to use what I had on hand.  I  added 1 tsp vanilla, only had 1/2 tsp lemon zest, used applesauce instead of vegetable oil, used buttermilk instead of regular, and the muffins turned out just great.  Thanks Chef John for a terrific recipe.

I made no changes.  I used regular sized muffin pans and made 16 delicious muffins with enough batter to make 6 more.  Am wondering if jumbo muffins would use all the batter.
Great tasting muffins.  Mine came out a little dark for my liking
So I am going to reduce the heat to 350 from 375 using the same amount of time.
4/11/19  I just love this recipe so I made it again today with two 

changes:  I used buttermilk instead of regular milk and I made this in a loaf pan.  There is enough batter left over to make probably 6 muffins.  The results of these changes are still in the oven so i’ll Let you know how it turned out later.  Not too good.
5/2/19. One more time with this delicious tasting recipe.  It is too dark for my liking.  I was going to change the temp to 350 but forgot to.   Will attempt another time and remember to lower the temperature and watch closely. Pray for me.

Amazing!  Would not have changed a thing, except I didn't have 2 cups of fresh blueberries, so put in 1 cup of fresh & 1 cup of dried.  Used 1/2 bread flour & 1/2 all-purpose.
Also, had about 3/4 cup of buttermilk that I needed to use, so threw that in there. Put some lemon zest in(not enough for a Tbsp). so I added 1 tsp fresh lemon juice.
For those of you with convection ovens, I baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes!

We used lemon extract because we did not have lemons on hand so it made the batter curdle a little bit...they look beautiful and taste amazing!!! Thank you Chef John!

Amazing recipe for sure. I was not even counting and made exactly 16 muffins as the recipe stated. My husband took them into the office and all were eaten. I will keep using this recipe. Not sugary at all and the use of a lot of blueberries really was the star.

Chef John never disappoints! Made these this morning because my daughter and I read "If you give a moose a muffin" book and she really wanted muffins. Did everything according to the recipe except the lemon zest. I dont have a good zester so I just squeezed about a teaspoon or 2 of lemon juice in there. Came out delicious!!! Will definitely make again!

These are very good, not overly sweet, baked up nicely, and didn't stick to the pan. I made half recipe, and it made exactly 12 muffins (using my lower height muffin pan). I sprayed the pan with "bake easy" and had no problem removing them from the pan.  Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!   UPDATE: 8/26/19: Just made these again, and used plain yogurt in place of the sour cream, and they turned out the same as when I made with the sour cream (in case anyone else is wondering).

These muffins baked up super fluffy and delicious. I had to use 1 cup chocolate chips instead of 2 cups blueberries because I was improvising with what I had on hand. Subsequently, I also substituted vanilla extract for the lemon.  They looked beautiful and we're a hit with my kids. I think I would prefer the blueberries personally to the chocolate chips.

Thanks for the recipe! Friends enjoyed the muffins, and mentioned they were not too sweet, liked the hint of lemon as it complemented the blueberry.  I used other reviewer suggestions: I added some vanilla, and sprinkled with tornado sugar before baking.  Used a little less sour cream, since I wanted it a little less moist.  Definitely will repeat!

Having a splash of blueberries in every bite is wonderful, which two cups provide. I will add slightly more sugar next time, maybe another two tablespoons (1/8 cup). To my taste, the muffins could have been just a bit sweeter. But I am quibbling over a small thing. These muffins rocked. I ate two right out of the oven, the best way to enjoy them with a little melted butter.

Delicious! I made it exactly according to the recipe. I only have 1 muffin pan so with the extra batter I made a mini loaf.  The lemon zest really made it. This will be my go to blueberry muffin recipe.

Darn good muffins!  I cut back the sugar by about 1/4 quarter and they're wonderful.  I would add a few more blueberries next time, but this is a fantastic recipe.  Nearly all of Chef John's recipes are easy and delicious.  Search for Chef John in the search bar at AllRecipes and get them all.  It's worth it!

My fiancé LOVES blueberry muffins! We just returned from a weekend trip to Maine and brought back 2 quarts of delicious blueberries so I decided to make this recipe (I had already made it once before and it was well received). Given the amount of blueberries that we now need to use up, I decided to add another half cup of blueberries to the recipe! I may have overcooked them a bit because the toothpick was wet even after 30 minutes (tricky to tell because the blueberries are obviously going to be wet) but I trust they will be just as yummy as the first time I made them. I will definitely be making this one again!!

Great mix of sweet and a bit of sour with the sour cream. Chef John's step by step instructions are also on point to get a smooth, consistant batter. Go ahead and throw in other berries or chocolate chips(like I did) this recipe is very versatile. If you're not crazy about sour cream, I put about half of what was recommended(just because thats all I had at home on a Sunday morning) and it was still delicious!

I continue picking blueberries from our bushes and making muffins for friends-- they love these blueberry muffins!
I cut the flour back to 2 1/2 cups, so the muffins are moister.

The batter was extremely thick even with leaving out a couple tbsp of flour. after the first tray didnt rise as much as I would like I thinned the rest of the batter with some milk and they rose better. I recommend reducing the amount of flour by at least 1/4 cup. It also only took about 22min to bake. They tasted good though.

These muffins are very yummy for sure. I was able to make 24 huge muffins with listed measurements so be mindful of that. Also, i was concerned about the amount of sugar but its not as sweet as i thought and the lemon zest definitely gives it a nice tangy flavor.  In spite of being light and fluffy to taste and touch, each muffins was heavy in weight,  I think due to the large number of blueberries in each one.  Although I enjoyed this recipe, i'll stick with my other one.  Thanks for sharing.

I love most of Chef John's recipes but this one is missing something....First of all it's not sweet enough, not sweet at all. Secondly it's not very light and fluffy like a muffin should be.  It's more dense. Kind of a cross between a muffin and a biscuit. I did add vanilla as others suggested and I'm glad I did.  To make them sweeter I made a glaze of confectioners sugar and lemon juice to drizzle on top...that made them better.  I'll be looking for a different blueberry muffin recipe for next time.

I made these for my Mom. She is on dialysis and has a very limited list of foods that she can eat. She takes a couple to eat during her treatments.  I had to tweak the sugar just a bit and the salt. But they are a hit!!!!!! I made at least 3 more dozen and put them in the freezer for her.

I just tried one, they are good. I did change it up a bit. I used Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream. I didn't have s c on hand. I cut back 1/4 cup of sugar, added vanilla, chopped up candied ginger and added spices. Ginger, cardamom and cinnamon  1/4 tsp of each, will add more next time. I also used frozen blueberries.

Used 1/2 tablespoon baking soda, no baking powder. Made 2 dozen muffins. Only baked for 25 mins not 30. Easy recepie, moist with nice crust on the top. Only fill cups half to 3/4 full pre baking to prevent over flow from rise. Gonna save this recepie.

Easy recipe and the muffins came out very good. The only change I made was I used canned blueberries, a mistake I won’t make again.   I’ll be making these again, but with  fresh blueberries!

This is a lovely blueberry muffin. I followed directions exactly, but made one cup of flour whole wheat pastry flour which worked out nicely.  The recipe made 16 large muffins for me, and they required 25 minutes in the oven.  The length of cooking time is going to be different  according to the size of muffins you make.  So if you halve the recipe but make 12 muffins they will be smaller and require less time I the oven.  This is my new go-to recipe for blueberry muffins--they taste even better after they've been allowed to completly cool.  I couldn't resist one fresh from the oven!

Excellent blueberry muffins. Made it exactly to recipe except I lowered the sugar to a scant 2/3rds cup.  Used 4 custard cups to bake the batter that wouldn’t fit in my 12 muffin pan. That worked great, too.

Delicious.  Loved how light and lemony they were.  Used to make a delicious, but heavier version, this will replace it now.

Delicious- made this recipe twice following the instructions to the letter only I halved it because it is just my hubby and me. The second time I made them I had a little less than 2 cups of blueberries (I still used two cups in half the batter size) so I added some cranberries- wonderful. I wouldn't mess with the recipe it is perfect!

I didn’t love these! But all my Guests did!!!! Also, after I started making them, I realized I didn't have lemons, so I just put a little lemon extract. EVERYONE loved these! I will definitely make again, especially for those who devoured them. On some, I added some Turbinado sugar..for a little crunch and for some sweetness. I put 2 scoopfuls of batter in each cupcake tin and they baked up beautifully! The Batter is VERY THICK! At first I thought I did something wrong and they were going to come out heavy and all wrong...but they didn't :)
UPDATE: I made these again and this time the batter was not THAT thick.....But they came out wonderful! not sure what was different. The only thing was I didn't have enough Sour cream, so I substituted 1/4 cup Greek Yogurt. These are starting to look good! I'm actually starting to like these :)

I halved the recipe and got 8 big muffins. I used a cup of mixed fruit: blueberries, strawberries, black & raspberries. They were great.

We followed the recipe very closely but with a few changes.  First, we lowered the sugar to 1/4 of a cup.  Secondly, we used blueberry yogurt because we didn't have sour cream around.  We also added about a tablespoon of Whole Grain Teff Flour for its higher protein content and texture.  The result was perfect.  The muffins came out with good amount of moisture and not so sweet.  Everyone loved it.

Very good muffins, especially chuck full of blueberries. They are not very sweet, could be a bit sweeter for my taste. I ended up with 18, could have filled the cups more, next time I will. Dough texture is light and fluffy, and I dumped the berries in the other half of flour prior to combining, it kept the berries whole... bakes in 25 minutes. Will make again. Thanks!

Very delightful muffins, not too sweet, packed with blueberries. My husband remarked about them being less sweet than the bakery, but he liked that. 

As always, my variations, which were only a couple, I added a teaspoon of vanilla and used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Delicious!

Very easy and delicious. I read reviews and did sprinkle a bit of sugar over the batter before baking. I also added a 1/2 tsp cinnamon to dry ingredients because blueberries and cinnamon make sense to me. Very good. I also made this is a glass baking dish as well for a coffee cake breakfast dish.

Delicious! 
I made just 2 tweaks: I substituted 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar and used 1/2 c + 2-tbs of Silk Milk. Very moist muffins!!
Recipe made 12 regular size muffins and 4 large muffins.

There is magic in allowing the muffin 8-12 hrs of rest.  The batter is extra thick, similar to a drop biscuit.  Eaten immediately, the muffin is dry, but given 8-12 hrs of rest(over night), the blueberries infuse the muffin with moisture and flavor - it's a marriage of  sweet berries, tangy dairy, and crisp lemon.

I substituted buttermilk for the milk,  adjusting baking powder to half and increasing the soda to replace half the baking.

I used frozen blueberries, and the muffins baked in my oven and muffin tin at 375F for 20 min till browned.

Finally, I removed muffins from the oven when they were browned, gave them an egg white wash and sprinkled about 1/4 C granulated sugar over each dozen ( enough to form a crust) then baked them 2 min more.


If you absolutely have to serve the muffins immediately, I recommend adding enough buttermilk to thin the batter almost to pancake consistency.  HOWEVER, as I'm sure you can  imagine, you will be unable to achieve the same complex flavor. :)

I didn't have vegetable oil or lemon zest, so I used some lemon flavored olive oil that i had on hand instead. Family loved the flavor. Will definitely make these again.

Very  moist and full of flavour.  I used plain yogurt (full fat) instead of sour cream and only having 1 cup of fresh blueberries, I jut took a chance and added some fresh strawberries (sliced and diced) The result was excellent. I will definitely make these muffins again. Thank you Sir CJ...

Outstanding! I was a little worried because the batter was so thick, but they baked up beautifully; not too sweet and with a rich, perfect crumb!  My only changes were to add coconut oil instead of vegetable, a splash of vanilla, and dash of nutmeg to the dry ingredients. Thank you, my search is over the perfect blueberry muffin recipe :)

Perfect! So good! Just like every other Chef John recipe! The only changes I made was to sub plain yogurt for sour cream and add a little cinnamon and vanilla. So light, fluffy, and the lemon zest really brightens the flavor. Will def make again!

I've made this recipe twice and it tastes better everytime. Everyone loves it when I make these muffins. Great recipe! The lemon zest is a must, it adds a nice hint of flavor.

I just made these and although they taste nice (not too sweet), I must have done something wrong, because they are pretty crumbly. Not like a biscuit but a really light cake. The tops come off of the bottoms with a little too much ease ( for me). No idea were I went wrong!? I will make again. These are very light. I put all the batter ( for 16 muffins) in 12 muffin tin and they looked super! I only baked them for 18 minutes.

I got 28 normal size muffins and baked them about 20 minutes. Added 1tsp. vanilla, didn't have fresh lemon in the frig. Cake like and very good.  I also tossed the berries in some of the flour mixture to keep them from seeping into the batter. Sprinkling a little sugar on top before baking makes them shimmer.

Not that Chef John's recipes are not stand alone awesome, but I had to make a few changes because of what I had on hand. I substituted Yoplait peach yogurt for sour cream, Meyer lemon zest for lemon zest, frozen blueberries for fresh and coconut oil for vegetable oil. They came out really, really delicious!

This muffin was pretty good, but I found that the muffins looked remarkably similar to cornbread. They also tasted like cornbread and smelt like it too. The difference was that it had blueberries. I was expecting something more sweet, and softer. But they were OK.

This was a very nice blueberry muffin.  I didn't use as much lemon zest as the recipe called for and I am glad as they might have been more lemon muffins than blueberry if I did use a whole tablespoon.

This recipe as written is o.k. My rating is based on that. That being said, I will make these again because I like the texture they just need some flavor!. I personally, will add about half cup of brown sugar and vanilla 1-2 tsp. (a baking recipe without vanilla??), lemon extract 3/4 tsp., the addition of chopped strawberries would be wonderful too :) 
I used a pampered chef cupcake scoop and ended up with exactly 24 muffins.

Really Really good. I am one of those that has to change a recipe. I added vanilla, coated the berries in part of the flour to prevent bleeding. I don't use much white flour any longer. I used 2C whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup white flour, & 1/4 cup of ground flax meal. Topped with a sprinkle of sugar before baking. Most muffin recipes, I only get 10 or so muffins. I got 12 regular size & 18 mini with this recipe. My husband can't stay away from them. So yummy. I love recipes where they can be a blank slate for different ideas. This is a winner.

I was SO disappointed in this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I expected something wonderful, what with the sour cream and all. I ate two of them. However, I do have to say that I did like the addition of the lemon zest and will remember that trick for future (edible) muffins.

I made the Blueberry Muffins today, and found them to be a little bit bland. However I ate one straight out of the oven without letting them cool first. Based on other reviews, next time I will use less flour (maybe 2 cups?). The recipe actually easily makes 18 muffins, and needs only about 24 minutes to bake. When I make this recipe again, I will try adding vanilla extract, and maybe using my hand mixer for a shorter amount of time.

Love these, they've become a staple on Sundays. I have used cream cheese softened instead of sour cream (only if I don't happen to have sour cream), and sometimes I use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and oh my goodness. So delicious!

Sorry but we did not like the muffins.  I followed the recipe exactly as written; the muffins were dry and not sweet enough.  I felt as I was mixing in the flour that three cups was too much but the texture looked just like in the video so I assumed it to be correct.  Perhaps these muffins would be good with just (2) cups, but I will be looking for another recipe elsewhere.

I liked this recipe better when I added vanilla extract. It definitely needed this. Plus I added a crumbly topping on the top before baking with cold butter, sugar & cinnamon. It now has way more flavor

Really I'd give this 3.5 stars if I could. Overall these are good but not as sweet as I hoped. Also they have less of a 'muffiny' texture and more of a biscuit texture. The recipe made about 30 muffins for me and the baking time was right on. My batter mixture was really, really sticky and I'm not sure if it was supposed to be that way or not.

Perfect!  After reading reviews I contemplated adding vanilla but did not.  Only change was I used 1-1/2 tsp of lemon zest because that was all I had.  They are not very sweet and more like cake.  That is what I like about them.  I wanted something I could warm and slather with butter.  Next time I may sprinkle with sugar just to get a different look but other than that, these were delicious!!  I'm glad I put this recipe in my recipe box.  Definitely make these again!!  Thanks for the recipe Chef John!

very easy and good recipe.  The bake time was only about 18 minutes for a moist muffin. Also needed a little extra sweetness, so I made a powdered sugar, milk and vanilla icing and drizzled it on.  Way yummier...
