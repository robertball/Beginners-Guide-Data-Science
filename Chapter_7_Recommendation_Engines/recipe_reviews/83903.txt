Vicky's Mom's Warm Potato Salad
Delicious salad, best served warm, but cold
good too. My friend's Mom makes this, but improves it in the following way: Eliminate the pickle. Instead, very finely chop two stalks celery & one medium very sweet onion. 
Place the chopped onion in the 2 cups mayo to marinate (it removes the raw onion taste) while u cook the potatoes & eggs. Cook potatoes till done (15 min or so). Cook eggs till done also.  Drain potatoes & eggs. Peel eggs & chop. Put eggs in w/hot potatoes. Take two butter knives & hold them so u cut in a "criss cross" fashion to "cut/slightly smash" the potatoes. Add the mayo/onion mixture & the celery & mix lightly. If dry, add a bit more mayo to taste. Season w/salt/pepper to taste.  This warm mixture sounds odd, but tastes heavenly.  Perfect taste/texture combo.  Excellent w/any type of sandwich, baked ham, brisket, meat loaf, roast/fried chicken, pork roast, hamburgers/hot dogs, etc.

This is one of my favorite ways to make potato salad and really my husband's favorite way to eat potato salad. I like to add a tablespoon or two of dijon mustard, some chopped green or red onion, some garlic powder/onion powder/fresh black pepper and add in the mayo gradually until it gets to the right consistancy. Depending on your potatoes, you might need either less or more than the recipe states. This is really a great base recipe to just play with and make more personal to you and your family's tastes. NOTE: This is a great base for Cold Baked Potato Salad, too!

This is very good. I found that I missed the chopped onion, so I added it, a squirt of yellow mustard and some black pepper. I think next time I would just use relish instead of chopping the pickle. Thanks for the recipe.

I used this recipe and it was a hit.  My grandmother in-law said it was the best potato salad she had ever tasted.  That is a great compliment from her, she doesn't say something unless she means it.  I did use left over mashed potatoes and used bread and butter pickles instead of the dill.  It was great, I will use this recipe over and over.

Sometimes simple is the best. That was definitely the case with this dish. I used Miracle Whip and sweet pickle relish instead of chopping the pickles myself. I couldn't help it and added a tiny dab of yellow mustard and a little onion powder. I cut this in half (except the eggs, I used all 3 because I forgot to scale down) and it was a little dry so maybe next time I will add more Miracle Whip. My husband said this was like deviled eggs salad with potatoes and he loved this. I agreed it is our new favorite recipe and so simple too! Thanks for sharing Grandma Sophie's recipe.

I love this potato salad and have used this recipe for several years. The only change I make is to use India relish instead of the chopped pickles (I have also used regular old pickle relish in this several times). Thanks for the post!

I am normally NOT a potato salad fan but this recipe is surprisingly very good and super simple!  Instead of plain salt, I used Celery Salt since I had it on hand.

Very basic, yet delicious recipe. You can stick to the recipe, but I can't seem to resist adding a little chopped onion and a small squirt of yellow mustard. Either way, this is a winner! Thank you!

I love simple potato salad. I used dill cubes (kind of like relish) and it was much easier than cutting the pickle up. Easy to put together at the last minute with simple ingredients you can keep on hand. This will become my stand-by potato salad recipe.

This is pretty good, different texture than any other potato salad I have ever had. I prefer this slightly warm, just after it's made. It's still very good after it has been chilled though. It is like smashed potatoes, being it's mixed while warm. I added a bit of mustard too, I like the tartness it adds to potato salads. This is perfect when craving potato salad with only having few ingrediants on hand, and you don't have to let it set for hours either. Thanks for the recipe (:

This potato salad is really good and I always have the few ingredients on hand.  I sometimes use bread & butter pickles instead of dill and that is a completely different taste, but very good.  This is the only potato salad I make and everyone loves it

So easy!!!  This is about how my own always turns out.  I love the smashed texture.  I like to add additional spices like seasoned salt, celery seed, dried minced onion.  Sweet relish works good in place of the pickle if you care to try, just drain off most of the liquid before adding it

This recipe is close to the way my mother used to make potato salad
& she was the best cook around.  I add more eggs, a little mustard, 
more pickles and more chopped celery plus McCormicks "perfect pinch 
garlic & herb no salt mixture.  I put in about a teaspoon.  Let it sit in
the refrigerator until all things cool and mix together.

Love this! Over the last couple days I'd been thinking of some sort of potato and egg salad but I never keep yellow or red potatoes around ad was trying to decide if mashed (or nearly mashed) would work. So happy I found this, it's exactly what I was picturing. I did leave out the pickle and added bacon pieces and green onions instead.

I halved this recipe and it was still incredible!!  So easy and yet, the flavors just worked.  I did add some mustard (a couple squeezes), some sliced olives, and about 1/2 C fresh chopped onion.  I had trouble not sampling too much before I served it ;)!

This is my Granny's potato salad! All except the mayonnaise, two cups is a little much.  I would reduce it by at least a half a cup.  Sometimes it seems like people have to have a ton of ingredients to make it seem "special".  Here's to an old fashioned recipe that just can't be beat.  For me myself, I like just a tiny bit of mustard in it, hee hee hee.  Try this recipe, simple and oh so delicious!

We really liked this potato salad. I made it pretty much as is, but I used red skinned baby potatoes, so I didn't need to peel them (thank God). Missed the onion a little, but the dill pickle was a great change. Very easy. I threw the eggs in with the potatoes for the last 10 minutes. Both my husband and picky sons could not stop sticking forks in the bowl. Thanks!!

This is a variation of one my mom has made since I was a kid. We use chopped gherkins and a splash or two of the pickle juice and a squirt of yellow mustard. The best!

This was good, a little bland and a little dry, so I added about a half cup of Miracle Whip and a Tbsp of mustard and 2 or 3 Tbsp of pickle juice.  The DH and the five-yr-old loved it!  Thanks for recipe!

This was great. I had been looking for a recipe my Mother had gotten from a woman from SC. I am not sure this was the same recipe, but if not it is pretty close. Everyone loved this. I will use this a lot in the future.

I found this a little bland - would try it again and add mustard, chopped green onion and a sprinkle of paprika.

Excellent simple recipe.  It was a nice change from the usual crunchy celery & onion variety, and I think I'm hooked on this method now!  I used sweet relish in place of the pickles, and added a few sprinkles of onion powder & garlic powder, and a little salt & black pepper.  Also, I used 6 large russet potatoes and 6 eggs. You can't go wrong with this recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I am not a potato salad person. I really liked this one. I used red potatoes that I left the skin on. The substitutions I made were swapping a jar of dill relish for the chopped pickles, adding mustard, garlic powder, a diced half of a sweet onion and twice as much egg. My preschooler helped me make it and he even licked the spoon!
