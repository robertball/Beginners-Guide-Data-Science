This is really close to something I have made for years. First tip.. USE A FOIL ROASTING PAN this is messy and can take days to soak and clean otherwise. I add a bag of bugles which were hard to find for a few years but are back now. I like to put it in Christmas bags with a ribbon for guests or family and never met a person that didn't love it! It is addicting though.
