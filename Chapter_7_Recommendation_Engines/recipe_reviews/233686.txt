I try to be true to recipes, but I'm often at the mercy of what I have on hand. I used fresh corn tortillas, which I quartered and layered the dish in three layers so mine came out more like a chicken enchilada casserole. The seasonings were spot on. I also substituted  a can of cream of poblano soup with the can of chicken soup. This is a great winter comfort food, but oh so easy any time you have leftover chicken. My leftover chicken was smoked, so it added an additional layer of flavor to the flavor profile. Thanks Sarah! Great recipe!

I thought this recipe was a good baseline recipe. I did however make some modification based on what I had on hand. I used plain tortilla chips in place of the Doritos, added chopped sweet bell peppers to the onion step and substituted taco seasoning for the chili powder and ground cumin. I also used leftover Rotisserie chicken. I layered crushed chips, chicken/soup mixture, shredded cheese twice ending with shredded cheese on top. It tasted even better for leftovers the next day!

This recipe is delicious.  I did not change anything and we really enjoyed it.  My husband is not a big Mexican food lover and he loved it, which is saying a lot.  I did cut the recipe in half and used one can of soup instead of two half cans.

More like the consistency of a dip... not a casserole that kind of holds its shape.  Very soupy.

Loved the filling and the yummy cheese on top.  Could have used a bit less Doritos on the bottom, but loved how they stayed crunchy.  We will make it again.  :)

Easy and excellent!  I used a can of Rotel (already combined  diced tomatoes & green chiles) instead of adding separately.  Otherwise, followed recipe as is.  A keeper.  My (finicky) daughter even took some for lunch the next day!

Loved it. We avoid canned soups (salty) so I used a couple of cups of heavy white sauce (Béchamel) made with broth; I sauteed sliced mushrooms with the onion. For convenience, I used a small rotisserie chicken from my supermarket deli... almost all the meat except for what I nibbled. Sarah's other chicken recipes are all worth a look... Swiss Chicken Casserole... we love everything chicken.

Just barely !!!!! OK   I even added some extra spices to flavor it up more. I would not make it again. Nothing special where the family all said yum make this agin. If you like bland then it will suit your taste
