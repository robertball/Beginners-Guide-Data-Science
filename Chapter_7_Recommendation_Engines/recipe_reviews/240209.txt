I'm not used to hot desserts, so this took a while to adjust!  I don't think I will ever be ready for the sacred experience of doubling the pepper!!! This was easy to make.

This was good except for the amount of cayenne it called for. I don't care how spicy you like your food, this is way over the top. I'd recommend changing the amount to 1/4 of the amount the recipe calls for and then increase from there depending on your taste. Otherwise, wonderful with a smooth, creamy consistency.

I only used 1teaspoon of cayane pepper and it was still to hot for me and I eat jalape√±os. I would make again and just leave out the pepper.

Great recipe with a twist. I only added a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and was plenty of heat.

I made it and substituted the milk for soy milk. I agree with the cayenne pepper it is way too much. I would put half the amount next time or quarter of the amount. I should have read the reviews first.

Excellent.  I used half of the called for cayenne.  Gives you the pepper and makes you search for the cocoa!
