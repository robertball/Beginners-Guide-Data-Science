This is outstanding, and PERFECT for turkey sandwiches. I always loved mayo with cranberry sauce on sandwiches, but combining the two and adding poppy seeds makes such a difference. We ate this for days on our sandwiches, and I could see using this with chicken also. I made a half batch using Hellmann's mayo and a half batch with Miracle Whip, we loved both!  I can't wait to use this for a chicken salad or turkey salad, adding in some diced celery and onion. Thanks for sharing this wonderful, easy spread :)

Ooh, this is good. I made it for a dressing for turkey meatloaf and I used jellied sauce (didn't have whole berry), but I can't wait to try it on day-after-Thanksgiving turkey sandwiches. OH! And I'm going to try it as a base for turkey salad too.

I LOVE this! Perfect for Thanksgiving leftover turkey sandwiches!  So easy but tasty - the poppy seeds are a nice twist.  I made this with plain canned whole berry sauce and "Smart Beat" mayo-type spread.  I also think this would be fabulous with a little spice in it - like if you make homemade cranberries with a little jalapeno kick.  Great idea!  I will make this often!

Yummy!!! I always have my turkey sandwiches with mayo and cranberry sauce, I've never thought to mix the two together.  I was great, I got to mix some for me and the kids still got to eat their cranberry "jello".  I think the poppy seeds could easily be left out, but I added them for extra fun :-), thanks tahoegirl

This was amazing...I put it on "Becky's Chicken Salad". I made no changes to this cranberry sauce ...except used Chia seeds instead of poppy...couldn't find them.

Gosh, who would have thought?  I like mayo on turkey sammies, and I like cranberry while I am eating turkey, and DH loves every bite of turkey to have a bite of cranberry, so this was a hit!  I used lite Miracle Whip, a little more cranberry, and zero poppy seeds.  I also added a few dashes of chili sauce but I couldnt taste it and I didnt want to over do it on the first go.  Love this idea!  Thanks for sharing!
