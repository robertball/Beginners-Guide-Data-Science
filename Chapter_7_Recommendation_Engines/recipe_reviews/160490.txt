We turned these into breakfast cups.  When I pulled the pan out after the initial baking i used a spoon to press the hash browns to the side.  I used eggs (1 egg for 2 hash brown cups) added milk and mixed up.  I substituted and used colby jack cheese, and browned up sausage.  These were gone in no time!

I have made these for 2 seperate events now and they were a huge hit both times.  I made the potato crusts the night before so it was easy to throw them together and bake them in the morning.

I will definitely be making these again.  I didn't have sausage.  I used bacon, peppers and onions.  Wow, were they tasty.  I can see making these for our large family when they all come over. You could even do different ingredients in different muffin pans.

Made these with my girls this morning. We subbed 1/2lb pepper bacon for the sausage, used 6 eggs whisked with some milk instead of egg whites, doubled the shredded cheddar, and left out the Italian seasoning. They were delicious! Will use regular bacon next time (girls thought was too spicy)  and will add in some onions.

Pretty bland. I added S&P and we served with salsa to liven it up a bit. Could use onions, tomatoes, and more cheese to make it a little more flavorful/quiche like.

This was a fun recipe to do with a three-year-old. The whole family enjoyed it! We will do it again.

Made this for breakfast this morning, altering the ingredients to better suit our tastes. I substituted bacon for the sausage, purple onion and sweet pepper for the mushroom and bell pepper, and eggs for the egg whites. Cooked it according to the directions (using slightly more butter than called for) and it was a big hit! I will definitely be making this again.

I substitute vegetables instead of sausage. I make it in silicone muffin cups for easy clean up.

Super easy! I had to cook the cups for almost 25 minutes to get them crunchy.  I don't do peppers or onions so I substituted garlic powder and some chili powder instead. I also want to use more salt next time.
