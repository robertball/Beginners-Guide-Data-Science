This recipe was a hit.  I did change it quite a bit as I am a huge cook so I tend to do that.  I wanted a bit taller cheesecake so I add 8 oz more cream cheese.  Instead of the sugar, eggs and flour, I used a can of sweetened condensed milk.  I cut the lime juice to 1/2 cup as the other reviews said it was a bit tart. I also put a thin layer of whip cream made with heavy whipping cream and sugar just to add a little something.  I decorated it with slices of lime.  I made it for a Christmas party so everyone was glad to not have the traditional stuff they were having at every other party.

GREAT RECIPE !!! BUT, I MUST ASK, WHY do people change about 5 or 6 things in a recipe & then say "This is a 5 STAR recipe" ???? I say, either make the recipe as written or don't rate it !!!!

EXCELLENT... with these revisions! Make crust as described. Use 32 oz cream cheese (4 bricks) 1 1/4 C. sugar, 1 T. cornstarch, 4 eggs, 1 T. lime zest. Here's the key - 1/3 C. lime juice, 1/3 C. lemon juice. Absolutely delicious. Top with a pint of heavy cream whipped with a couple of tablespoons of sugar. Garnish with lime zest and lime slices. It's even better after it's been in the fridge for a day! YUMMY!

I made this cheescake for my brothers birthday party and everyone FLIPPED for it!  I added a few tablespoons of shredded coconut to the crust and it went over big!  I took the suggestions to bake the cake a little longer and that worked well.  After the cake was done baking I left the oven door open a bit, to make sure it was completely cooled before taking it out and I didn't have any cracking.  I will be making this one again.

If you like Key Lime Pie, you'll enjoy this, but you must love limes - this is VERY "limey"!!  I used bottled real key lime juice.  Mine cracked even though I followed the directions and placed a shallow pan of hot water on the lower rack.  Very rich.  I served mine plain (without whipped cream), and myself and a few others noted that it really needs whipped cream on top to help "soften" the strong lime flavor. This is a keeper, esp. for summertime entertaining.

The thing to keep in mind with this cake is that the key lime juice makes it very tart, but does not have a strong 'lime' taste.  The lime flavor comes from the zest.  I followed the directions for the filling, and found that it was very tart, but I could not identify a strong lime flavor.  In the future, I think I would cut down slightly on the juice, but add a little bit more zest.  That way it will be good and limey, but won't make me pucker with each bite!  For the crust, I added 1/4 c. sugar, and I baked it for 6 min. at 375 before adding the filling.  I like a crispier crust.

Delicious and easy.   Also works well in a prepared 9" graham crust if you don't want to bother with the springform.

The recipe was easy to follow. I would use a little less lime juice next time. I put a pan of water in the oven while cooking and my cheesecake did not crack. However, it cracked like the Grand Canyon after I put it in the refrigerator. Any suggestions??

One word for this cheesecake.....AWESOME!!!

My boyfriend bugs me to death to make him cheesecakes so I surprised him by making this one for dessert tonight!  Not only was HE pleased, but I just snuck a second piece and had to come online to write this review.

Made one tiny little alteration however...I used Coconut Bar cookie crumbs and added 3 Tbsp. of shredded coconut for the crust.  Using Key Lime juice is absolutely necessary.  You can buy it by the bottle in most grocery stores so you don't have to crack knuckles juicing key limes.

Took the advice of a previous review also and instead of chilling in the refrigerator, put it in the freezer and it was nice and cool when I served it.

No doubt.....this cheesecake is FAN-TAB-U-LOUS!!  You won't be sorry if you choose to make this one.

Unbelieveable! This is great! I might not be the best cook but I did change this recipe in every way. Try 3 packs of cream cheese, 1 can condensed milk, and however much lime juice you like.I baked mine for about 40 minutes or until set. Then I put it in the frig for over night. I loved it!

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It was delicious. If anyone would like to try a different topping rather than the whipped topping, here is the topping I used:  1 cup sour cream, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 3 tbls, sugar, beat with hand mixer, chill in fridge while cheese cake is cooking.  Spread gently on top of the cheese cake for the last 10 min. of baking time.   It was a big hit! :) (ps: for those who had cracking or over flows, get your eggs room temp. first and soften your cream cheese in micro. first.  Pan of hot water on bottom rack of oven really does help to prevent the cracking, bakes evenly)

ALMOST perfect. It's not that it's too limey or even too tart - it just needs a little more sugar!  This is indeed rich and creamy and just right limey, and even tho' I think it could stand another few tablespoons of sugar it's not going to prevent me from having another (and another) piece. To make slices neat and clean I used unwaxed, unflavored dental floss.

I followed the suggestions of one of the reviewers and increased 3 of the ingredients, namely:  32 oz of cream cheese, 1 1/4 c sugar and 4 eggs.  Then instead of 2/3 c key lime juice, I used 1/3 c key lime and 1/3 c lemon juice.  It was to die for!  I've served it to guests twice and both times, heard lots of "mmmmm's" and exclamations about how creamy and light and fluffy it was.   Outstanding dessert!

Must be for hard-core key lime lovers, which apparently my husband and I are not.  Very tart, not like any cheesecake I've ever had.  But if you do think this is still up your alley, I've got a great "cheat" idea for juicing the key limes as a wrist injury made me get a bit more creative: cut in half as usual, but put in a GARLIC PRESS!!!  Seemed so much easier!

Delicious! I used a Vanilla Wafer crust. I used real key limes-twenty of them! I heeded the recommendation of member Smang in the use of flour instead of cornstarch, and the addition of one egg. I, like her, prefer a more textured than creamy cheesecake. I used member Katiemac's tip for high altitude and cooked it for 75 mins. Other than those changes, I followed the recipe as written. Living in the foothills of Golden, Colorado at 7300 feet alt., and dry climate, it can be a challenge baking almost anything in the cake and bread catagories. The water bath under the cake, instead of setting the cake directly in it, worked wonderfully. I had no cracks, even after the 30 min. rest with the oven door ajar. The flavor was perfect. I like my citrus desserts tangy. I bake a lot of cheesecakes and am fairly picky about the overall outcome of them. For me, this is a BIG winner!

Simply sumptuous, both in flavor and murderously creamy texture.  I included 1 Tb plus 1/2 cup of lime juice, which gave that just-right tartness. I subbed Splenda for the sugar, and found I needed 1-1/4 cup to sweeten it appropriately. Pulled it out of the oven at 55 minutes and topped it with a mixture of 1 cup sour cream blended with 1/4 cup Splenda and 1/4 tsp vanilla, then returned it to the oven for another 5 minutes. I baked it in a water bath and it came out smooth and crack-free. When it cooled, I topped it with glazed strawberries, also made with Splenda. The sweetness of the strawberries provides the perfect foil for the limey tartness. No one could tell it was all sugar-free.  Cannot cheerlead loud or long enough for this spectacular recipe!

Wow. I'll say it again.  Wow.  This one was easier to prepare than the last cheesecake I made, but there wasn't a drop off in quality.  It was excellent.  I imagine a whipped topping would add some flavor, but we were happy with the cheesecake as it was. I did not have a problem with cracking, having followed the cheesecake recommendations from allrecipes and reviewers: 1) wrap the bottom of cheesecake in foil (see my photo), 2) set wrapped cheesecake in an inch of hot water while cooking, and, 3) Leave the cheesecake in the water for four to six hours.  My wife loved this stuff, as did I.  I'm starting to feel like a pro.  Ha.

Lovely flavor and very very creamy. I was hoping for more of a New York cheese cake texture rather than the silky cream cheese dessert that I ended up with. (Almost too cream cheesy) I reduced the key lime to 1/2 c and I used a ginger snap crust which paired elegantly with the tartness. Next time I will try something to create a more cheesecake like texture, perhaps another egg? Any suggestions? **Round 2: In the effort for a more NY cheesecake-like texture, I nixed the cornstarch and replaced it with a 1/4 c of flour and added a fourth egg. I forgot to account for the additional cooking time/temp needed for the extra egg so I ended up cooking it 20 minutes longer. The top browned a little but otherwise the changes cut back on the dominance of the cream cheese flavor and gave it the texture I was looking for. Next time I'll bake at a higher temp for an hour. I'm sooo close!

Soo good!! I've made it several times and it is wonderful every time.  I serve it with whipped cream and raspberry sauce. I also added 1 t of cinnamon to the crust, it really adds a great flavor that works well with the lime.

Oh my, this is sooooo yummy when some of the reviewer suggestions are incorporated into the recipe.  I do add a 4th box of cream cheese (neufschatel, actually, although I once used a small carton of ricotta in place of the 4th cream cheese and that turned out good too -- lighter and with a little more grainy texture but still very nice) and so I add an extra egg and another 1/4 cup of sugar to compensate.  I also do half key lime juice and half lemon juice to reduce the bitterness and freely zest an entire lime for lots of limey flavor.  I get RAVE reviews on this one!  Definitely my new favorite cheesecake recipe -- and I already had some pretty darn good ones!

This was the first cheesecake I had attempted to make.  And, it turned out perfectly!   I added an extra 4 ounces of cream cheese and used bottled key lime juice.  I didn't find this to be overly tart, but I love tart things.  65 minutes was perfect baking time.  Make sure to use a water bath, I think it definitely makes all the difference!   This cheesecake turned out so creamy and just oh so good!  Thanks!

I normally don't rate recipes, but I brought a small piece to work with my lunch, and I'm sitting here wishing I'd brought a bigger piece!  This was sooooo good.  Made a few changes (after reading all the reviews).  I used Nilla Cookies for the crust and added 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I used 4 bricks of cream cheese and 4 eggs.  I used 1 1/2 T of lime zest and 2/3 cup of lime juice.  Also increase the sugar to 1 1/4 cups.  Followed baking directions exactly and had a perfect creamy-coloured cheesecake (no browning) and no cracking.

I took the time to juice the key limes and zest, expecting an awesome cheesecake.  This was not it.  I tasted the batter and it was so tart, it didn't even taste like a dessert.  I added more sugar and used sugar in the crust.  I baked it longer than stated and after sitting in the fridge overnight, it was not set.  We tried it, but it was not all eaten. By far the worst dessert I have ever made.

I made this for a potluck where the theme was Mexican. It was so good and there was none left to take back home. I made some changes. Instead of a graham cracker crust i made "hawaiian" type crust with 1 1/2 cup crushed Key lime flavored cookies (these i found at H-E-B. they had white chocolate chips in them), 1/2 cup finely chopped macadamia nuts and 1/2 cup shredded coconut. I almost bought a bottle of key lime juice but i noticed it said something about being extra concentrated. I wonder if that's why some of the reviews said the lime was too overpowering. I used fresh squeezed Key lime juice instead. I bought a 2 lb bag and, between the juicing and decoration, i used all but 1/4 lb. As for cooking, i usually use a water bath but it always makes my crusts soggy so i tried just putting the pan of water at the bottom of the oven this time and it worked perfectly. the crust was firm and crunch and my cake did not crack!I made real whipped cream to spread on top and i thought it made a light compliment to the bold key lime flavor. Thanks so much for the recipe. this will go in my collection

I added a little sugar and vanilla to the crust and used only a half cup lime juice to cut down on the tartness of the cake.  I was very pleased with the results.

Couldn't find key limes so I used 1/2 cup of regular lime juice and added a very small amount of vanilla. The lime flavor was perfect. I used gluten free animal crackers for the crust (which was my favorite part). I questioned only baking this at 300 degrees... and wish I had cooked it at 325. It wasn't quite done and we called this "key lime custard". So, if you bake it at 300, definitely do the whole 65 minutes. But, even with it's custard texture, it was delicious!!!

This was an excellent cheese cake.  I used key lime juice and cut it back to 1/2 cup.  I also added a couple tablespoons of sugar to the crust.  After baking I turned off the oven and left the cheesecake in with the door cracked for an hour then cooled it completely on the counter before putting it in the fridge.  I did not use a water bath and had no cracks!  IT turned out beautifully!

This is a wonderful cheesecake! It is my mom's absolute favorite! I get many requests for it! I can say that I often use regular limes and bottled lime juice and it always turns out wonderfully!

If you aren't looking for "tart",  Key Lime Cheesecake may not be for you.  This is EXCELLENT just as the recipe is written.  Actual Key Lime juice is a MUST, and a dollop of whipped cream on top is a wonderful compliment.  Thanks for the recipe... I will make this again and again!

Delicious!  Left out the cornstarch, because I've never used that in cheesecake before.  I would not decrease the amount of key lime juice as others have suggested.  If the recipe is too tart for you, increase the sugar.  I used 1 1/4 cups sugar when I made it.  My new favorite cheesecake recipe.  Light, creamy, the whole family loved it!

I made this twice in the last week, one being a trial for a dinner at home before taking it to a luncheon. Both times it was well received and enjoyed by all! Even though it is a cheesecake, it has a nice refreshing "light" flavor. I studied the tips and suggestions and did add an extra egg, 8oz block of creamed cheese and reduced the key lime to 1/2 cup. I cut a circle of parchment for the bottom of the pan and it easily moved to the plate from the pan. I placed a large pan of water on the shelf below the pan, turned the oven off after an hour and left it sitting in the cracked" oven an additional hour. I refrigerated over night, sliced with a clean hot knife. For the luncheon, I sliced, then decorated the cake with fresh lime on each slice so it was easy for people to remove a piece and still have it look nicely presented on their plate. This will be a nice dessert to have in my pocket that can be made a day or 2 ahead of time and it looks like it came from a restaurant!! Thank you!

Added the extra 8oz of cream cheese as some had suggested but otherwise left the recipe as is...loved it.  Also used it as the basis for my own experiment.  I substitued tangerine for lime and vanilla wafers for graham cracker to create a cheesecake with flavors reminiscent of those orange creamsicles I loved so much as a child

This recipe is, as many reviewers have pointed out, a little bitter. To fix that, I drizzled raspberry syrup over it. That's a better fix than covering it in whipped cream, and it adds a nice summer flavor.

Followed this to a T, mostly... and used the cheesecake tips: pan of water in oven, turn off oven when centre still jiggly, leave in closed oven for an hour.  No cracks, most visually beautiful, perfectly textured cheesecake.  I used fresh limes, and it was the perfect balance of sweet and tart.  NOTE: in high altitude (7500 ft)the time was 75 minutes. Thank you for a killer dessert!!

This recipe was excellent, coming from a key lime pie lover.  The only thing I changed was add the coconut to the crust, as noted in some reviews.the cheesecake was a perfect balance of sweet and tart.  I did use the half pan of boiling water under the cheesecake tip and it turned out perfect with no sinking or cracking.  I may add sliced strawberries and glaze next time for a strawberry margarita cheesecake.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really, really delicious.  I used bottled lime juice out of laziness, and it had a nice, mellow lime flavor -- not too tart.  Great texture.

This was the first real cheesecake I attempted.  And it turned out great!  I probably could've baked it a little bit longer, but the flavor was amazing.  I didn't have key limes, so I used regular limes, and it was still wonderful.

WONDERFUL RECIPE!  After reading several reviews I followed the advise of one person & used 32 oz of cream cheese (4 blocks), 1 1/4 c sugar and 4 eggs. Then instead of 2/3 c key lime juice, I used 1/3 c key lime and 1/3 c lemon juice & grated 2 lime zests.  Bake for 1 1/2 hours.  THIS IS DEFINITELY A MUST KEEP RECIPE!

I made this cheesecake last week (first cheesecake I made in 7 years).  I made it with bottled Key Lime juice, and forgot to get a lime for the rind, but followed the directions exactly.  Put a pan of water underneat for the baking.  Had to take it to work, still in the pan, in my bicycle basket (2 miles) and IT DIDN'T CRACK!!!!!!  Got rave reviews from everyone who tried it, including the chef I made it fo-it was his birthday and he loves Key Lime Pie.

I made this for a dinner party and it has a hit. I halved the recipe and made it in two tartlet pans. I followed the suggestions of JAMYEARN and used condensed milk instead of eggs, four, cornstarch, and sugar. I also added coconut flakes to the the curst. I topped both of the mini cheesecakes with whip cream and raspberry sauce. The raspberry sauce went great with the lime flavor.

Wonderful cheesecake and much better than those made with condensed milk (to us there is just no comparison.)   Unfortunately I could not find key limes so had to settle for regular which probably makes a difference to the taste.   Anyway, as soon as key limes show up again on our shelves I will make another.

This is actually an excellant recipe for Key Lime Cheesecake. It is tart, and sweet, and just the right balance of both. To make it a little more hip friendly, I used neufchatel ~ marketed as a 1/3 less fat than cream cheese ~ but still in most dairy cases next to the cream cheese. Since neufchatel has a higher moisture content, I added about a teaspoon more of corn starch, and the results were a creamy, tart and sweet satiny cake. This is definetly a keeper!

Very Good. Have made it twice, first time to use up  a bag of extra Key Limes and the second time because it was delicious and had Lime Juice on hand. Second time was as good (maybe better) and I did not have to squeeze all those tiny Limes. Use commercial lime juice, as good plus a whole lot easier.

I made four different cheesecakes to take to work one day and this was by far everyone's favorite.  Nice and tart.  People commented on how it was getting a cross between the usual key lime pie they love and the cheesecakes they love.  Can't go wrong with that combination.  Would most definitely serve again.  Easy to make and the suggestion of the water in the pan in the oven worked great.  Not the slightest crack.

It IS prone to cracking, but still very good and tasty.  You might not have to juice that many key limes, because it turns out pretty tart, so if you get tired might as well not put all the juice. :&)

Not bad at all.  I took the advise of many an added another 8 ounce of cream cheese and I wished I hadn't.  It took away from the keylime flavor.  However, I did use a can of condensed milk instead of eggs, etc.  Perhaps that altered the taste as well?  Will make again and stick to recipe as written.

This is a good, different cheesecake. I use chocolate cookie crumbs for the crust sometimes and I like to use seedless raspberry jam for the topping. Just warm the jam until you can spread it on the cake. It will stiffen again when you chill the cake.

Followed the recipe exactly but it was WAY too tart...causes the taste buds on your tongue to swell...no kidding. Also, it wasn't sweet enough.

Made this recipe as given except for adding a bit of sugar in the crust.  Thought the lime flavor could have been a bit stronger and the tartness was not overpowering.  I used Nellie and Joe's bottled key lime juice.  It didn't have the normal cheesecake texture though, more creamy like a pie.  My family said it could use more lime flavor and a bit more tartness.

This was a good cheesecake. I added a little extra key lime juice and wish I hadn't. It would have had lots of flavor with the recommended amount. I used the premade graham cracker pie crust which worked out fine.

Although the cheesecake was a huge hit, I'm only giving it four stars.  The cheesecake didn't have the normal "cheesecake texture." I think it was too creamy...more like a pie than a cheesecake.

Very good. I too cut back on the lime juice after reading other reviews. Just an FYI, one major reason for cheesecake to crack is cooling it too quickly. Along with baking it in a water bath, make sure the cheesecake has thoroughly cooled before putting it in the fridge.

This was a good cheesecake.  I put the pan of hot water in the oven with the cheesecake, but it still cracked.  I followed the advice of others and cut down on the lime juice, but wish I wouldn't have.  I think it could have used more lime flavor.  I garnished it with whip cream and strawberries.  I thought it was a tasty cheesecake and will probably make it again.

Delicious and perfect. I made only the few following adjustments: added 1/4 cup of sugar to the crust and baked it at 375 for 8 minutes. I only had minute maid frozen lime aid concentrate and subed that instead of fresh key lime juice and grated rind. Perfect. smooth and creamy, no cracks, could not get enough! Yum Yum.

I try to read the reviews of recipes before I make them and wish I had with this one.  This is a really good cheesecake but it is so tart to the point of being bitter.  Some people recommending using less lime juice and that would have helped immensely.  I may make again but will cut the juice down by nearly 1/2.  I can't comment on the crust as I have a favorite I use for all my cheesecakes and used that.

I made this as written for my boyfriend's birthday, but added a can of cherry pie filling (he loves the fast-food chain's cherry limeade) as a toppping after it baked. It is a little tart, but it's a nice change from overly sweet. I also subbed one block of low-fat cheese and used two regular cheeses - so I could justify having a nice big slice of birthday cheesecake. :-) Also, I'd be interested in trying this with a citrus other than lime. Very good and easy recipe - thanks!

Sorry. None of us liked this cheesecake.  Way too tart for us.  I'm giving this a 3-star only because it's possible I did something wrong, but I followed the recipe exactly.

I had some extra limes in my icebox so I decided to give this a whirl.  I cut all the ingredients down by a third and made two mini-cheescakes (4" diam) that came out perfectly.  They were bite sized pieces of sweet limey cheesy goodness so intense that the two cakes lasted me a week.  Highly recommended.

A really good recipe. Very tart, but if you add a little whipped cream on top, or sprinkle with some powder sugar, it really balances out nicely. Definatly a make again.

Nice and fresh cheesecake recipe, everybody loved it. Pretty difficult to cut without making a mess but I guess it's the price to pay for the extra creamy texture. ETA: the second time I made it I subed 1/3 of the cream cheese for heavy cream and it was even better!

This is my favorite key lime cheesecake recipe.  It's tangy and limey and a perfect New York style cheesecake.  I always make it for Thanksgiving and this year I'm making it for St. Patrick's Day, too!

I made this for my husband's birthday, and he loved it.  I used regular lime juice and the lime taste was perfect.  I think I will bake the crust next time to make it crisp, and add an extra cream cheese, as suggested in other reviews, to make the filling a bit creamier.  All in all, a very good recipe.

This was a pretty good recipe. Next time I will definitely cut the key lime juice from 2/3 to 1/2 cup. Also I used splenda instead of sugar so to compensate for the tartness I added an additional 1/2 cup of splenda. This recipe would be even better with a nice meringue. This time I whipped some heavy cream with splenda and made a topping.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! This was the first time I have ever made a cheesecake and it was so easy and everyone loved it.  I can't even tell you how delicious it was.  I didn't think it was too limey at all! This is definitely a keeper!

I made this for the birthday party for one of my friends.  Everyone loved it, even one who said she didn't like cheesecake.  I cooked mine a little longer than it said.  It had a good consistency and wasn't dry.  It is defintely a keeper.

This is in fact a Key Lime lovers cheesecake.  It was a breeze to bake.  Followed everything as stated in the recipe, but I did let it sit i the oven a bit longer that suggested.  I also closed the door after it cooled a bit.  I do it so the cake doesn't crack as it cools.  I also bake with the water bath.  Better safe than sorry.

My wife's favorite cheese cake recipe. We add more fresh lime juice (1 cup total) and skip the graham cracker crust. Pure lime cheesecake. Why confuse your taste buds?

Loved this recipe! I did read the other reviews, and only put 1/2 cup fresh squeezed lime juice in it. The 2/3's would have been too much even for a citrus lover like myself. I only had regular limes on hand, and they still worked out wonderfully. My two year old and husband devoured their pieces of cheese cake.  I took 1/2 the cheesecake and frozen it individual servings for a quick dessert later. Still fabulous after freezing. Other than the revision on the amount of juice, I don't recommend changing a thing!

This cheesescake certainly is a "10" in my book!. I made it, as one person said with 32.oz creamcheese and 1 1/4 cups sugar, 4 eggs, and half key lime juice and half lemon juice. I serve mine with a red raspberry sauce with Chambourd (put through a food mill to remove seeds)A big hit and if there is any raspberry sauce leftover, it goes great over vanilla ice cream.  YUM

AWESOME!! I used the shortbread crust recipe from this site and I did increase the cream cheese to 32oz and the eggs to 4. I used a springfoam pan and prseed the crust up the sides. This cheesecake was very refeshing. A great ending to a delicious Easter Dinner.

Very good but if you use a standard 9 inch store bought graham crust, cut the recipe down by 1/3 (except the lime juice, which I keep the full amount because I like the stronger lime flavor).  We also use 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda and it works fine.

This was a very tasty cheesecake; creamy with a nice balance of tart and sweet.  It is quite heavy but the lime makes it seem less heavy.  Others had suggested adding an additional egg and more sugar.  Instead I used 4 bricks of cream cheese, the same number of eggs (3), and a can of condensed milk.  Another cheesecake recipe I use calls for that and I know it is often used in Key Lime Pie.  The results were very positive.  I would make this recipe again.

My husband really likes key lime cheesecake and so I decided to make if as a dessert for Christmas family dinner.  I was so happy with how it looked, but my husband said are you sure you want to take it for everyone to try seeing as this was your first time.  I was hesitant but I agreed to not take it and was happy that I didn't.  I was so happy that I did not serve it.  We both tried it when we got home and it seemed great until we got the bite of the very tart aftertaste.  It was way too much Key lime juice which made it almost impossible to eat (unless you like that overwhelming tart taste).  I made it two days later and decreased the amount of key lime juice to a little over 1/4 cup, used 3/4 tablespoon of zest and added 1/4 cup more of sugar.  It came out perfect. A part from the few changes I made, this recipe is a keeper and is officially a family favorite.

I had to substitute lemon peel for the lime zest, but it still tasted great.

It was so good the kids did not wait till I had chilled it a day before eating more than half of it. I doubled the graham crackers to get a thicker crust and mixed in a little lemon juice as suggested by other readers. The taste is just nice and takes away the heaviness of typical cheesecake, so this is the new default recipe for our family!

This is a great recipe and very easy to make.  It is always well received by the adults, but some kids find it to be a bit too tart.  Regardless, because it's so easy to make, I make it often!  I've probably made this 10-12 times over the last couple of years.  

One change that I make, because I rarely have limes in the house when I make it, is that I leave out the zest and add few drops of food coloring to give it a green'ish hue.

Wonderfully delicious cheesecake. Just enough sweetness to balance out the "tang." I have given this cheesecake out as gifts, and have also entered it in a baking competition and won first place! This is a must try!

This was amazing! I made it for a family dinner and everyone pretty much went nuts for it. I did cut the key lime juice down to a 1/3 cup and topped it with whipped cream made from heavy whipping cream. I really want to try and cut the calories down though! Has anyone experimented with using lower calorie cream cheese and splenda?

I didn't have any of this, but everyone who had really liked it.  The only thing I did different was add in an extra 4oz of cream cheese because I had it leftover, and did not put in any zest because I forgot to pick up a lime.  The center didn't seem to set too well, but good enough.  Maybe next time I will let it bake another 5-10 mins before turning the oven off.

This was great.  I went the lazy route and used a store-bought graham cracker crust.  Still turned out delicious.  I used 24 oz (3 bricks) of cream cheese as the recipe calls for rather than 4 like many reviewers suggest.  I thought it was the perfect amount - and actually the filling was even a bit too much for the crust.  I probably should have bought the deep dish graham cracker crust.  The only change I made to the recipe was 1/2 cup of lime juice rather than 2/3 cup.  Either probably would have been fine.  The lime flavor is pretty faint the first day or two but gets stronger after it sits in the fridge for a few days.

If you are truly a lover of key lime, this cheesecake is perfect! I found the ratio of sugar to key lime juice to be just right…it was tart and tangy with just enough sweetness. The only thing I changed was adding two whole eggs and one yolk (instead of the 3 eggs called for) to the batter. I also substituted ½ cup of almonds instead of using all graham crackers for the crust. Finally, I wrapped the spring form pan in aluminum foil and baked the cheesecake in a water bath. It came out perfectly creamy without the slightest indication of a crack!

I LOVED this cheesecake.  I got a hankering to make a "Margarita" cheesecake after having one at a cafe while on Jury Duty.  This was as close to it as possible.  It wasn't as "limey" as I wanted it.  I added more lime juice and some tequila.  But the taste, texture, and moistness was just right.  I will definitely use this as my base cheesecake recipe and experiment with amount of lime, or other flavors.  Yum!

Make this pie the night before so that the favor and texture can "set". For a low-fat diet, I cheated and used a Keebler Low-Fat Graham Cracker Crust and low-Fat cream cheese. The filling was enough to fill 2 crusts. I froze one pie, but the first one was so good, the second one will be thawed and eaten sooner than I thought.

So good. Just the right amount of lime. I couldn't find key lime juice, so I just used the bottled lime juice. I also used 1/3 fat cream cheese. It cracked a little, but oh well. Tasted awesome.

I made this for work and it was a big hit.  A co-worker who was raised in Tampa loved it.  I used flaked coconut in the crust per another reviewer's suggestion and less lime juice and it came out just right.

I've never made a cheesecake before, so I was properly terrified going into this, but willing.  It turned out great!  I feel like now I can call myself a better-than-intermediate cook!  Whole family loved it, very good lime-y taste and soooo creamy!  Well worth the effort.

WONDERFUL!! I have made this several times and everyone that tries it LOVES it, even if they aren't big fans of Lime!! I like using the shortbread pre-made crust (2 of them) makes the perfect amount, nice shortcut and different taste!

Awesome cheesecake! I only used 1/2 cup of key lime juice and added 2 Tbsp. grated sweetened coconut to the graham cracker crumbs. Definitely bake with a water bath, mine didn't crack one bit! I didn't leave it in the oven afterward like the recipe suggests as I have a three year old and an open hot oven isn't the safest thing. Still the cheesecake turned out perfect! Definitely a keeper recipe.

EVERYONE loves this in my family!  The coolwhip topping was perfect, a little too bitter without it.  I also like cooling the cake and making a sweet creamcheese layer to balance the lime.

This was very good. I put about 1/3 cup of shredded coconut in the crust and baked for about 10 min. (be sure to let cool before adding cheesecake mixture). The only change I made was 1/2 cup of key lime juice of 2/3.  In my experience the cake was much better the 2nd day after baking.

The filling is PHENOMENAL - but the crust is less than stellar.  I would highly recommend looking up another crust recipe and using that with this cheesecake.  Otherwise, absolutely delicious!

Very Good! I didn't change a thing in this recipe. The strong lime flavor was tempered nicely by some whip cream and a light dusting of powdered sugar, resulting in a rich, cool, summertime treat. Thank you!

This recipe was okay for me...i didn't love that i had to squeeze the juice out of the key limes...my kids did not like this recipe and it did okay at the party.  I have better cheesecake recipes that i would make for next time.

Excellent!  After reading the reviews, I did decide to decrease the key lime juice to 1/2 cup.  I also added 1 tsp. sugar to the graham cracker crust and baked it for 5 minutes and 1 tsp. vanilla to the cheesecake.  It had the perfect texture and amount of tartness for my taste.  I had TONS of compliments!

I loved this recipe - but is it just me or did the crust call for WAY too much butter? I had butter dripping out of my springform pan during the baking process.

This cheesecake was pretty good, but a little bit too tangy for most of my guests.

I've made quite a few varities of cheesecakes but this one is superb. I followed this one to the "T" with the pan of warm water under the cheesecake but I did have to bake it longer than the 65 min until it set and then turned the oven off and left it in for 30 minutes withe the door open as stated. You also definitely need the Key Lime juice and I thought 2/3 cup was not too tart or sour but the perfect amount of key lime taste. I made this for Easter and it was definitely the rave of the dinner and I will definitely be making this again.

What a big hit this was in our home... not to mention at the restaraunt I work in!  The shallow pan of water was a trick I've never tried with cheesecakes but works without a hitch.  Not a single crack! Thanks Kim for a great recipe. It's one I'll be using for years!

Excellent! I used regular limes, and the full amount. It was perfect, not the slightest bit too tart.  I don't even like lime desserts and this cheesecake is superb. 

I would make it for company. It stores well too.

If you didn't add all the lime juice I'd imagine this would be bland.  It did crack a bit, so plan for whipping cream over the top before serving, with some grated zest for color.  

We loved this, and will make again!

I thought this was a very tasty... I altered a little bit: 1/2 C key lime juice, added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 coconut to the crust.  It turned out beautiful and a man at my husbands work said that I need to quit my job and become a baker... I think that sums it up!

I thought this was horrible.  It was WAY too tart.  I made it for my mom's birthday and I was very dissappointed.  The only person who liked it and ate about half of it(the rest of it we threw out) was my neighbor who loves tart stuff.  It was super extra tart.  It was was like eating some super super tart candy, but it wasn't sweet at all.  My fav part was the crust.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars was because my neighbor liked it, or else I would have given it 1 star.

I really liked this but the flavor was just a tad too sharp at first.  Definately mellowed after a couple of days in the fridge and then I thought it was just right.  Others didn't care for it as much....said it was like key lime pie but not quite as good.

I used crushed coconut cookies for the crust and added 3Tbls of unsweetened grated coconut. Using regular lime juice works just fine. Instead of zest I used lime oil. Trust me this is well
worth the trip and money. Unfortunately I don't remember how much I used but a little goes a long way. I think I used 1/4 tsp but I'm not sure. Trust your instincts. Also I highly recommend reading the tips for making cheesecake on this website. It is very important to give your cheesecake a bath. Read the tips. :)

Good cheesecake, but not much lime flavor if you use regular lime juice - the Key Lime juice is truly necessary for a good lime flavor.  I make this with a crust of crushed pretzels, instead of graham crackers, for a salty complement to the tart/sweet cheesecake and call it a "Margarita Cheesecake".

This is absolutely delicious - just the right amount of "limey-ness".  I left out the zest because my husband has an aversion to anything even remotely resembling "peels".  The texture was very creamy - great.

This recipe was amazing.  Very limey.  This was a huge hit with my family.  I added about 1/2 cup of unsweetened coconut to the crust.  It added a very nice flavour.

Sorry, but we found this to be waaaay to "limey". The key lime overpowered any hint that this was actually cheesecake. On the other hand, the recipe is easy to make and the consistency of the cake was wonderful. I'd try this again but use much less key lime juice.

Simple to make.  Fabulous creamy texture.  Very tart lime flavor that absolutely requires whipped cream to balance it.  Bakes beautifully; I've made it twice without the slightest crack.

If you like lime flavor - this is very good.  It is also very rich - small piece goes far.  If at first you think the the lime is too tart, just let the refrigerated portion come up in temperature slightly, then the lime flavor becomes very mellow and yummy!

I made this for Thankgiving, the pan was cleaned out.  I found that this cheesecake was either liked a lot or not cared for, depending upon how much you like limes.  I personaly thought it excellent, along with the other lime lovers, but the kids thought it too tart.  I will be making this again.

After tasting the key lime cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory restaurant in Atlanta, I had to try this recipe. But I was disappointed. The filling tasted too strongly of cream cheese. Perhaps substituting some sour cream and adding some vanilla would help. Also, not following my own instincts, I used the full amount of butter called for for the shortbread crust. Shortbread is heavily butter based, so the crust was awful, and butter leaked through the springform pan into the oven. The good news is that the instruction to put a pan of water in the oven did keep the cake from cracking--something I've tried to prevent for years.

Made it exactly as the recipe said it came out great!  I make my husband a cheesecake every year for his birthday and this year he asked for a key lime one - This was perfect!  It was insanely creamy and just the right amount of lime.  In the future, I might add just a dollop of whipped cream when serving it to break up the tartness a little, but I don't think it's necessary.

I have made this cheesecake countless times and it's one of my favorites. It's refreshing and summery, the lime cuts through the heaviness of the creamcheese. I get requests from friends to bring this as a dessert, it's so good. I don't find it too tart but you have to love citrus, which I do! This is also one that never cracks on me, I let it cool down completely in the oven with the door slightly cracked open when it's done baking before transferring to the fridge. I've made this with various toppings and it's always delicious! My favorite topping on this is a cranberry-orange salsa that I make around the Christmas period.

Okay, I made the recipe as is the first time, and didn't deviate on it at all. My test audience loved it and said it tasted just like Key Lime Pie. 

Regarding those that claim the cake is too tart, I have this to say: It's lime. It's SUPPOSED to be tart.  Limes are tart. Of course, I live in Florida and we do love our Key Lime Pie.  Maybe the solution is adding more sugar rather than cutting back on the lime.

The recipe itself, while it turned out good, is a bit sloppily written. 

A couple of things I changed in my next version.

1) I baked the crust by itself for ten minutes at 300 degrees. It cooled quickly, then I refrigerated it.

2) I greased the sides of the pan with butter to make it easier to separate.

3) I like more filling in my cheesecake, so I added an extra 8 oz. package of cream cheese (4 in all) and an extra egg (4 eggs total). Increased sugar to 1 1/3 cups and lime juice to just over 3/4 cups and an extra teaspoon of lime zest. Baking and cooling time stayed the same. 

4) Now to make some additions to the instructions themselves. 

Beat the cream cheese (which should be cooled to room temperature, at least 2-3 hours out of the refrigerator) by itself, just until it no longer looks like four separate blocks of cream cheese, before adding ingredients. When making cheesecake, it's very important to use the electric mixer just until the ingredients are combined. Overbeating causes excess air bubbles in the batter, which expand in the heat of the oven, causing

First off, I want to mention I did not make any changes to the recipe. I tend to like to try them as is and then later make changes if appropriate. For a first time around, I think this recipe was very good. I can see how some people thought it was too tangy, but I really like the tang.  I feel the Tang from the  key limes  balances the  richness of the cheesecake . My suggestion would be to make the recipe as is, but have some whipping cream available for those people who have more of a sweet tooth.

If you love Key Lime Pie, which is supposed to be tart, you'll like this. I love it with whipped cream. After letting it sit in the open oven, I let it sit for a while on the counter to cool down some before I put it in the fridge.  It won't crack that way.

Really great cheesecake! You have to like lime and tart flavors to really enjoy this cheesecake, being said I love sour and upped the juice to 3/4 cup. I used regular limes because thats what I had, I added about a half a tablespoon flour to counteract the extra liquid, and I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, but I kept everything else the same. 
edit: I just noticed the directions say to refrigerate the crust after making it, out of habit I baked it at 350 for 10 minutes.

I served this for a birthday dinner last night and several people said it was the best cheesecake they had ever had! I served it with a fresh red raspberry sauce and raspberries. It was perfect. The cake had a wonderful texture and did not crack. It was tangy, but not too tangy. Really quite glorious.
 
I followed the cheesecake recipe exactly, but changed the crust (8 oz crackers--15 crackers, 4 tab butter, 4 tab virgin coconut oil for a coconuty flavor, 1/4 c. sugar). I greased the sides of the pan and brought the crust all the way up the side (this lets the cake release from the pan as it cools) and baked it at 350 for 10 minutes.  

I squeezed ripe (yellowish) key limes in my garlic press to easily get the juice.  All my ingredients were room temperature (cream cheese softened in microwave), broke each of the yolks before adding to the batter, I was very careful to not over-stir the eggs and the final batter, banged pan on counter to bring any air bubbles up. Put a boiler pan of steaming hot water in the bottom rack of the oven well before I put in the cake. I turned off oven at 33 minutes, when the center 2-3 inches jiggled like soft-set jello. I left the cake in the oven with the door cracked until the oven was cool, cooled until room temp on the counter, let it chill uncovered in the fridge for a couple hours, and then loosely covered it with foil for two days.

Excellent recipe.  Adjust the recipe for 8 servings and use a prepared graham cracker crust.  Delicious..

This cheesecake turns out perfectly every time.  I make it, freeze it overnight and then take it out and cut into 12 pieces & then keep in freezer for easy serving for dinner parties.  I always put a layer of parchment paper over the cheesecake in freezer so moisture doesn't spoil the cheesecake.  A dollop of whipping cream , cut up mango and toasted coconut makes this fantastic!  Have also substituted lemon for lime which is equally as good.

I made this recipe but changed it from the original by adding the 4th package of cream cheese, the lemon juice (1/3 key lime juice, 1/3 cup lemon juice). It tastes delicious but, the center was not done after letting it cook for 60 minutes. I will cook for 65-75 minutes next time. I use a cheesecake moat.. no cracking at all. Was difficult to remove from bottom of pan, like all the cheesecakes I make.  It tastes wonderful though and the center is of yogurt consistency. The family loves it. I will be making this again.

Loved this cheesecake!! I used less lime juice than it called for but added a fresh squeezed lemon and also a fresh squeezed orange. It turned out sweet and very summery! Went well with our BBQ rib dinner!

Excellent key-lime cheesecake recipe.  Some things to note/add:

1) The crust could use a little sweetness.  In my case I switched it out for a lemon-flour crust (1.25 c flour, 1/2 cup cold butter, 1 tsp lemon zest, 1 tbsp sugar, pre-baked at 325 for 10-20 minutes).  To me, this goes better with the key-lime flavor.

2) There's a significant difference between fresh-squeezed key-lime juice and the pasteurized, bottled stuff you get in stores--the fresh-squeezed juice has a stronger, sharper flavor (and more "pucker factor").  I do a middle-ground by taking the key limes I use for zest (about 6), squeezing them for fresh juice, and adding enough bottled stuff to get to 2/3 cup.  If you go all-out with fresh juice, I would reduce it to 1/2 cup, or give the cheesecake a couple of days in the fridge to mellow out.

3) A lightly sweetened whipped cream does well for topping the cheesecake, either as a full layer, or just strategically placed dollops.  Some lime zest garnish on top of the cream also works.

Made this for Easter and everyone raved about it! I didn't use coconut in the crust but I think I will next time to give this some extra oomph! I let it sit in the oven and then on the counter for an hour each before taking off the pan and cooling overnight and had no cracks. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I cut down on the lime juice as it seemed excessive. I love tart so wish I had not. It was still delicious but would have been so much better if I had not and had followed the original instructions

Yummy! Heeded other reviewers and increased the sugar to 1.25c, other than that, didnt change anything. Topped with a spoonful of whipped cream shot with dark rum and a candied lime slice on each piece...very good! It wasn't super tall though, so next time I might increase the cream cheese and eggs to have a taller cake.  No cracking at all, I made sure everything was room temp before mixing and stood the cake for maybe half an hour before putting it in the oven to get any air bubbles out. It was limey and not too sweet, but not sour either, and very creamy.

My fiance and I really enjoyed this cheesecake.  I made it pretty much according to the recipe, except that I ended up adding an additional 2-3 tablespoons of butter to the crust because the graham cracker crumbs were just too dry to stick to the sides of the pan.  Other than that, I followed the directions as listed.  I give it 4 stars because it was almost overwhelmingly "lime-y", and I was hoping for a little more balance with the cheesecake flavor.  When I make it again I will reduce the lime juice & zest.  If you enjoy an intense lime flavor though, this really does make a delicious cheesecake, and its a great alternative to key lime pie (which I personally find overly sweet).

I followed the revisions for this recipe and the cheesecake came out amazing.   I followed allicat2u's changes and the cheesecake was a huge hit.  I did not top the cheesecake because my family likes to keep it simple.  I cannot believe I actually made a cheesecake!  I will definitely do this again.

I made the crust out of coconut cookie wafer crumbs instead of graham cacker and added a little shredded coconut.  It turned out fabulous.  I also added about 2 Tbls of lime ZEST and lowered lime juice to 1/3-1/2 cup.  
Made these into minis with a dollup of whip cream and a quarter lime slice- perfect!

I did alter it to be more to the cheesecake I enjoy - one more brick of cream cheese, and 1/2 cup plain yogurt (or sour cream).  I left the amount of lime where it was at since I upped the ingredients, and it was tart - but we loved it that way! I added coconut to the crust like most suggested - would definately NOT do that again...took too much away (IMHO) from the cheese portion.

Couldn't be simpler! This recipe is so easy and has gone over well with several different crowds. I don't have a springform pan, so I just make it in a 9-inch pie pan and it's fine. I also cut the key lime juice down to 1/2 a cup and it's delicious -- still very limey but not too tart. Thank you!

Cake disappeared immediately so there was no way to go back for a second opinion.   It may call for more lime then it should but I think some limes are more tart then others.

I love Key Lime pies so i thought i would love this and i did.So did everyone else at the potluck.They loved it so much there wasn't any left for me to take home.I have another one in the oven as i write this.Since i love limes i used a whole cup of fresh lime juice,1 1/3 cup of sugar and all the zest from the 3 large limes.I also used a gingersnap crust from the ginger spice cheese cake (which is also very yummy) that is on this site.We shall see if i get to take home any leftovers ; )

I can't imagine what  went wrong.  I followed the directions exactly as written.  After 45 minutes the top of the cheesecake was burnt-dark brown, cracked and puffy.  I am famous for making cheesecakes in my family and have made many, but this one was a diasaster.  I let it set overnight and the next day when I cut into it, it was runny  I though that maybe my oven was off so I tried a regular flavored cheesecake and it came out fine.

This was very different. At first I didnt like it but then I wanted more and more. I actually ended up eating the whole chessecake by myself.Then two days later I really wanted more. It was really limey and hand a nice texture, but it did take a really long time get the juice out of a whole bag of limes.

i halved the recipe bc i knew that it wouldnt fit in a pre-baked, 9inch pie pan otherwise. (was slightly below the edge of the pan) also, who knew key limes were so hard to squeeze???? i couldn't believe how little juice i was getting. so even though this was one of the only times i've 'zested' i found that easier so i put a bit more zest after giving up on the juice. cheesecake came out delish! the zest provided pretty little specks, much better than adding green food coloring. i kept it in the oven turned off for 30 mins, then let it cool on the stove for an hour before popping it in the fridge overnight. my past keylime cheesecake experiences have been with easier versions containing sweetened condensed milk. the quality is the same but the other recipe is easier so may just stick with that instead.

This is the best dessert.  Ever.  I made this for a family dinner and it was gone almost instantly.  It was also the first cheesecake I have ever made and I was surprised at how well it turned out!  Months later everyone is raving about it.  This is a must try!!!

I love this recipe! I was nervous about making a cheesecake for the first time for Thanksgiving dinner.  It turned out beautifully.  It looked amazing right out of the oven, and with some whipped cream and lime slices, it looked like it was right out of a magazine.  And the taste!! It was the hit of the dinner.  Very tart and tasty.  Absolutely delicious!!  I couldn't find key lime juice, so used regular lime juice instead, and added some lime zest to the graham crust.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter, and it was perfect.  Definitely a new favorite!

Ok . . so I modified the heck out of it.  I added 1 more pkg of cream cheese (4 total), 1 egg, 1 egg yolk, 1/3 cup sugar and a teaspoon of cornstarch so I would get a higher cheesecake.  (I used Nellie and Joes's key lime juice and didnt change the amount).  Absolutely wonderful!!!!

AMAZING. This was my first EVER cheesecake -- I brought it to a party, where it was gone in a flash! I received numerous compliments, including from a former cheesecake-obsessed chef. I used about 1/2 cup key lime juice and added lemon juice up to almost 2/3 cup. I upped the sugar to 1-1/4 cups. I left it in the oven for about an hour after baking, then refrigerated overnight covered in foil. It didn't crack and looked beautiful. I served it with whipped cream but the whipped cream seemed unnecessary.

This was easy to prepare and very refreshing, it's perfect during the hot summer!  I will make it again for sure.  I used coconut cookies for the crust because that's what I had and significantly less butter, otherwise I stuck to the recipe.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly and it went really well at my July 4th cookout! The host actually dropped the entire cake upside down on a chair and everyone still finished the cake. That's how good this recipe is!

I love cheesecake and key lime pie, so this one sounded right up my alley.  IT WAS!  I followed JAMYEARN and used sweetened condensed milk instead of eggs, cornstarch, and sugar.  EASY! 1/2 cup lime juice was just enough and whip cream makes it perfect.

I made it exactly the way the recipe called and i was disappointed. It did not at all have a cheesecake texture, it was more like a cream pie. and didn't have a cheesecake taste either. I won't make this again.

Made it exactly as the recipe stated, and it turned out excellent. I had eight people visiting for dinner, four who had never tried key lime anything, and four who were afficianados. All agreed that this was as good as it gets!  I will make this one often.

I made this for a coworker's birthday and it was a hit with everyone who loved key lime! This recipe packs quite a lime punch, so I served it with whipped cream so that those who wanted it could have the extra sweetness. This recipe was a total success!

I followed someone else's suggestion to replace eggs and sugar with sweetened condensed milk (I used the lowfat kind).  I also added 1 c. flaked coconut to the crust and topped with flaked coconut.   Amazing!!!  All my friends raved - even ones who normally pass up dessert loved it!

A couple of things- I should have reduced the amt. of butter (as per other reviewers advice) because the paper liners were soaked! Another thing, I baked these as cupcakes and used a silicone muffin "pan" and they turned out SO weird!  They did not bake/set all the way, whereas some bigger ones I made in ramekins were great.  After 2 days, the silicone baked had firmed up.  Either way, they all tasted DELICIOUS and boyfriend has already requested more for his bday in a couple of wks! p.s used regular limes as didn't have time to find key's, so they were not too tart.

I got on this lime kick and made this recipe for some people at work and all I got was wow and it was very refreshing. I use fresh Keylime juice and grated key lime zest(yes hand squeezed and grated). It wasn't to limey and I think using all the fresh ingredients was well worth it. Next time I make this I am gonna use an almond crust from another recipe since I like that crust better than the gragham cracker crust.. Only Tip I would suggest is if your gonna use fresh key limes is to buy them in a bag,it's cheaper that way.

Awesome! I used Ginger Snaps instead of Graham Crackers for the crust.At first I was dissapointed that this was not very tall but after you taste how tart it is you understand. I used Cool Whip to top it and it made the perfect compliment for the tartness of the cheesecake. Great for summer cookouts!

Delicious!  I've never made a cheesecake before, but certainly had a great experience using this recipe.  I followed the directions exactly.  Cheesecake was tastey, perfectly "limey" and was a total hit for my mom's birthday.  I put a pan of hot water on the bottom rack of my oven and let sit with the door open for 30 minutes.  I let it completely cool out of the oven before refridgerating.  Didn't crack in the slightest.  I will make this again for sure.

I've made key lime pie and I've made cheesecake, but never the two at once! It was absolutely amazing. I subbed a ginger snap crust for the traditional graham, but otherwise kept it all the same. Quite delicious.

I found this recipe to be great, I have never done the water method, but had no cracks! I did cheat and used a pre made crust( the keebler w/ two extra servings). Came out great and freezes like a dream for later searving. Will make again, often!

Very creamy and excellent texture, however it was a little tart.  Next time I'll cut the key lime juice to 1/2 cup and add a little sugar to the crust to even out the tartness.

The texture and everything was perfect but it was too tart for our taste – I even put in ½ cup.  I will make this again but put less Key Lime juice in it.  I was disappointed that it cracked but that was more then likely my fault.  I used Cinnamon gram crackers and the curst was really good.

Absolutely wonderful.  Very rich and creamy.  I'll make the slices much smaller next time.  It could serve 16 people rather than 8 with how rich it was.

This is the first Cheesecake I have ever made and it turned out perfect!  No crack at all!  It is tart, but I like it just as is.  I served it with whipped topping from a can with a twist of lime on top.  It was beautiful & everyone enjoyed it!

After 1 1/2 hours, this cheesecake was still liquidy and very wobbly when shaken.  Of course, after 1 1/2 hours, the top was very browned even though I put foil over it.  I followed the recipe completely, and my oven is usually hotter than others, so I have absolutely no idea why this would not set.  Perhaps it is just supposed to be this way, because after I took it out, peeled off the burnt part, then refrigerated it over night, it was firm and cuttable.  If this is the way it is supposed to work, maybe that part should have been included in the recipe.  The flavor was very good, but I would recommend cutting down a to 1/2 c. of key lime juice unless you like your Key Lime Cheesecake very tart.

I was not able to find key lime juice at the two stores that I went to so I substituted regular lime juice. It didn't have quite the amount of "limey-ness" that we would have liked, so I will add more juice next time. It still had AMAZING flavor...this rivaled any cheesecake you get at a restaurant. I also used a store-bought crust. One note with using store-bought crusts is that the batter that goes inside the crust is too much for the store-bought crusts (I think the store bought ones are 8 inches)....so I will probably make the crust myself next time.

This recipe was excellent!  I made it for an office party and everyone loved it.  I decreased the key lime juice to 1/2 C. per the other comments and it was perfect!  I'll do this one again for sure!

This cheesecake is delicious.    I made it exactly as the recipe specifies.  My son said it is the best cake ever.  Very easy to make.  I highly recommend this recipe and will make it a new favorite in our house.

This is the first cheescake I've made at home.  It was great!  Made for family and guests, everyone loved it.  I kept a pan of water in the oven during baking, and the top came out perfectly -- no cracks.  Definitely a "show off" dessert.

I made this for my husband for Father's Day and have to say it is the easiest and tastiest cheesecake I've ever made.  My 4-year old twin boys loved it, too.  Thanks for such a delicious & easy recipe, especially for a cheesecake.

Very nice flavor though mild. Probably because I took the advice of others and reduced the amount of key lime juice. For TRUE key lime pie lovers from south Florida - use the full amount. Mine was quickly devoured anyway.

As a college student w/out much baking experience and no cheesecake experience, I was a little nervous to try this one, but am glad I did! I didn't have a springform pan and ended up just putting the batter into 2 regular pie crusts and it turned out fabulously.  The tops were still cracked, but I think that goes away with experience!  My friends inhaled the pies and are already asking when I'm going to make it again! Great Recipie!

First time I made a cheesecake and this turned out perfect. I did follow others advice and added 8 more ounces of cream cheese. I used regular lime juice instead of Key Lime and it was just right. One other thing though, I did not have a springform pan, so I cheated and bought the premade graham crusts and it actually made two of those pies. YUM!

I was hoping for a Key Lime Cheesecake recipe that would be similar to the WONDERFUL Key Lime Cheesecake I have had the The Cheesecake Factory.  Unfortunately, this is not it.  I chose to buy Key limes and squeeze them by hand to get the juice.  This was very foolish of me because you only get a few drops of juice from each lime because they are so tiny.  I went through 55 limes to get the amount of juice called for in the recipe.  I served this at a dinner party drizzled with raspberry sauce.  It was very tart- but it was still tasty.  It is not a dense cheesecake like the kind I am used to.  It is a lighter texture.  I would not serve this again at a dinner party.  I am giving it 3 stars because it is good- just not great.  If you make it- try a raspberry sauce drizzed over the slices- it really improves the cheesecake and cuts the tartness.

My 15 year old daughter and I made this and it was wonderful.  The flavor reminded us of the great times we had in Florida on vacation.
We added coconut to the crust which just made it even better. I am making it again today for a party. It will be a cheese cake that I will make again and again.

This is pretty good.  Everyone liked it. I've never seen a recipe call for such a strange method of cooking (after turning off oven, leave door open and leave cake in there for another 30 mins), maybe that is standard for cheesecakes or something.  Anyhow, mine turned out perfect. Tasted fine. I prefer a stronger key-lime BITE in the flavor but everyone else liked it.

Wow - this is great if you like tart things (which I do).  If you're looking for a light lime flavor try another recipe or cut back on the lime juice because it does have a very strong taste.  Especially good with a little bit of whipped cream to balance the tart.

This made a great tall cheesecake.  I did not use lime zest because I wanted a really smooth texture and instead of key lime juice I used Rose's Sweetened Lime Juice (in the drink mix section of the grocery store).  It keeps the cheesecake from being lime-y.  If you want a nice minty green color add a few drops of green food coloring too.

Easy to make for a cheesecake recipe!!!  A little too limey for me, but my husband (a key lime fan) raved about it.  Used the tip to put a pan in the bottom of the over half full of water and that seemed to help with the cracking.

This simple cheesecake has a strong key taste, and it is light and refreshing. I used bottled lime juice, and it turned out just perfect. I'll surely make this one again.

This was a really nice and simple cheesecake recipe.  It was very refreshing.  I actually used real key limes.  My husband the chocolate lover even had seconds.  The water in the oven kept the cheesecake from cracking (a usual problem with my "dark" springforms). Definitely a keeper.

This Key Lime Cheesecake is absolutely the best.  It is so refreshing and easy to make.  The taste is wonderful.  It is definately a keeper.

I made 2 of these cheesecakes for a recent baby shower and it was a huge hit! Everyone came back for seconds. I made one with a shortbread cookie crust and one with a graham cracker crust, and I preferred the shortbread crust. It seemed to taste better with the lime. I will definitely make this again.

Several things seemed “off” but I followed anyway. Ingredients separated during baking leaving cheesecake inconsistent. I think it was the huge amount of lemon juice. Reading reviews afterward, definitely should have followed my gut. Cheesecakes aren’t hard.

I don't know if it's just because I might have slightly undercooked it, but this was so creamy rather than dense/cheesecake texture.  I personally LOVED it that way.  It tasted divine.  I used gingersnaps instead of graham crackers for the crust and I'd recommend it.  Ginger pairs well with lime.

I purchased premade crusts. Followed the recipe and had enough batter for a third cheesecake. It was very tart to me, maybe less key lime juice next time(?). I did sprinkle some raw sugar on top to balance the tartness a bit. And I should’ve bake it for the 65 minutes, mine wasn’t quite done at 55 minutes. I did put a pan of water on the bottom rack and the cheesecake looked perfect, not a crack anywhere.  Will try again. Thanks

It was delicious. I wanted a taller cheesecake so I did 32oz cream cheese,  1 1/2 cup sugar, and 4 eggs.  I kept everything else the same. It came out great! I know I altered the recipe, but I’m confident that if I used the exact measurements, it would have tastes just as good. It would only have been a little shorter in height. I’m a professional baker and I am adding this one to my recipe book!!!

Loved it! Only changes I made, was I  added 1 tsp vanilla. And precooked the crust for 10 minutes. Absolutely perfect! Even worked well in a 9x5 pan! (Doubling the recipe perfectly fit in a 9x5)

Delish! Halved it and made it into mini cheesecakes. It was a hit, even with people who don’t consider themselves big into key lime pie. It was refreshing and zesty. Topped it with stabilized whipped cream and more lime zest.

I gave it a 4 because a few of my guests thought it was too tart.  Most of us loved it and would give it 5 stars.  It was my first time making a cheesecake.  I definitely need some practice.

I followed the instructions meticulously and the cake never fully set in the middle. I was afraid to leave it in longer due to the edges beginning to brown. And yes...only for extreme lime lovers as it is very bitter. I would like to try it again with maybe half the lime juice or adding additional cream cheese...

Followed recipe exactly. This came out perfect using the fresh key limes. Served it with whipped cream. Might try making it with bottled key lime juice or just plain limes in the off season.

This is a delicious cheesecake! I add a bit more zest & juice because I love a strong lime flavor. 

I made it again tonight, but I used lemons because I didn’t have limes. I can tell already that it’s going to be wonderful.  Thank you for this recipe.

Great recipe! My only change was precooking the crust a few minutes and cooling prior to filling it. Here is the big thing: DON'T USE BOTTLED LIME JUICE! It will produce a bitter product. Instead of key limes, I used regular limes since they produce far more juice with less work. Plus, they grow in my front yard.  Even if they didn't, I would purchase them. Cheaper and easier than key limes, and they taste great.

This was so delicious! I made it for my boyfriend's dad for his birthday and everyone loved it. I did use 32 oz. cream cheese, 1 1/4 c sugar, and four eggs. I reduced to 1/2 c lime juice as some reviews said 2/3 c made the cake too tart. A note on that - make sure the lime juice is as fresh as possible! I mixed everything else in, then juiced the limes right before adding the juice to the batter. The juice starts oxidizing immediately so this is very important. Now I have to make another cheesecake because it didn't even last one day! :)

Yes, this was a big hit, but a tad sweet. Next time, I will put less sugar.

I added fresh raspberries on top for color and presentation. As it turns out, the flavors were very complimentary. This is now one of my all time favorite desserts. It was a huge hit with everyone!

Oh my this was a hit.  Followed some suggestions and subbed 1/4 C of flour for the cornstarch.  I like the NY texture better.  Added another egg and  1/4 C of sugar and decreased the lime juice to  1/2 C.    I baked my crust and that gave it a nice crunch.

The flavour of the cheese cake was AMAZING, so yummy.  What I was disappointed with was how runny the cheesecake was. I baked it as per instructions, let it sit in an open oven for 30 min and refrigerated over 12 hours. If make this recipe again I will add some flour to help bind the cake together.

Good flavor. Family loved it but cooking time was off in my oven. Plus I can never seems to make a cheesecake that doesn't fall. So disappointing. Not the fault of the recipe author, just my private hell.

First, I tried another key lime cheesecake recipe on this site (Key Lime Cheesecake II), and this recipe is FAR superior. We were fighting for the leftovers. I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and only used 1/2 cup of lime juice. It is quite tart, even cutting back on the original amount, but goes nicely with whipped cream. Another note: definitely make this one a day ahead. Letting it refrigerate overnight improves the texture and flavor. Also, do not over-mix! Over mixing ruins the consistency. I recommend mixing by hand after adding the last ingredients.

For everyone that changed everything about a recipe, give this one a shot as is. I squeezed fresh keylime juice and used keylime zest and followed the recipe. It was a very good balance of tart to sweet. I give this four stars only because it has more of a pie feel than cheesecake which was a little disappointing. But as written, and this being the first cheesecake I have ever made, mine did not crack and looked perfect!

I make a lot of cheesecakes, and this is in the top 3 for sure. People LOVED it. I myself thought it was pretty good, and Im not a huge fan of citrus. I would have given it 5 stars, but it really does need 32, not 24, oz cream cheese. I took the advice from the reviews and added an extra pack, and it made the perfect consistency. Also, I followed the other tip of excluding the lime zest, so it wasn't overbearing. If you follow the rest of the instructions it will turn out beautifully. Rule of thumb, ALWAYS keep a shallow dish of water in the oven when baking cheesecakes. The humidity is crucial. Good luck bakers!

I followed the recipe precisely, using bottled key lime juice. I garnished the top with whipped cream and thinly sliced lime rounds. Yes, it's tart. And so is a proper key lime pie. Upon reflection, I wouldn't change a thing. And I'll certainly make this again.

Very good. Perfect light subtle flavor. Similar to key lime pie.  This goes for any cheesecake, to prevent cracks open the oven and let the hot air out. Immediately close it then let the cheesecake cool in the oven.

Since I was in a rush I only left it in the oven ten minutes then put it in the top shelf of the freezer for 30 minutes.

The only minor differences that happened to me by mistake for this recipe were one of the three cream cheese packs was neufchatel cheese (less cream and all milk but same cream cheese taste) and I only had 2/3 tbsp of lime shavings / zest.

I made a lot of mistakes with this recipe, like adding a whole avocado to make it green (which it didn't, of course), and it still came out good! I used coconut sable cookies for the crust and replaced some of the lime juice the lime juice with mojito! people loved it!

I find the cheese cake to be a little tart so I add about 1/4 more sugar. I also add an extra 1/2 Tbsp of cornstarch and an extra egg yolk. It usually takes a minimum of 2 hours to cook for me.

Very yummy! Instead of a springform I used a pie pan and made 2/3 of the filling. I bought the heavy whipping cream but I think it is so yummy it doesn't need it. Also used regular limes and the light cream cheese. Will definitely make again.

I didn't change anything and it turned out good. I don't know about some of the others who changed all of the ingredients. One said instead of flour, and eggs, she used sweetened condensed milk.  First of all, the recipe didn't call for flour. And, how can milk take the place of eggs and flour?

We absolutely love this recipe, and I chose not to change it.  I did however, add to it once it was already cooked.  I creamed 8 oz of cream cheese with a 1/2 cup of sugar and then stirred in a small tub of whipped topping.  We love the tartness of the limes, but like to balance it with some sweet.  The new layer should only be put on once the cake is cooled completely (cold is best), and then refrigerated for at least an hour, after added.  I also added 1/4 cup of sugar to the crust, but I doubt its necessary.

I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used a can of sweetened condensed milk instead of the eggs, sugar and flour.  I also added shredded coconut to the crust and baked it at 425 degrees F for 10 minutes then 300 for 30 minutes in a water bath.  It was fantastic.  Using key lime juice is a must.

Followed another recommendation to cut key lime juice to 1/2 c. and it was perfect! Or next time might add another brick of cream cheese (so 4 total) and stick with recommended key lime juice.

I love things sour, and after reading the reviews, I decided to reduce the amount of key lime.  I wish I hadn't now.  Even with reducing the amount of lime juice, this was fab!  I made it in a tart pan, instead of a spring form, and since I'm diabetic that's perfect.  This is lower sugar, and lower carb and it's fantastic.  I'm making it again on Friday for my husbands birthday dinner, and will add the original amount of key lime.

Bam. This is such a great treat. I changed it a little to marry it with my moms recipe. I used 32oz of Philadelphia cream cheese and 4 eggs. Tried the 1/2c of key lime juice but felt it needed more. Bumped it up to 2/3c next go around and tasted perfect. I also used a water tray on lower rack of oven to prevent crust burn.

This was fantastic! I started to go down the rabbit hole of reading the reviews and all the changes everyone made but then decided to stick to the recipe and is. I did make two small tweaks. I added some lemon juice and extra lime zest.

I am a hostess for our Ladies Morning next week, and because I love cheesecake, decided to try a new recipe.  I baked this earlier this morning, and could hardly wait for it to cool in the fridge before testing it!  It is fantastic!  Limes are very scarce and expensive locally, and the ones I had did not give enough juice, so I  had to add lemon juice to make up the quantity.  My husband and I both loved it, so I plan to make it again for Saturday.  I am thinking of making a berry topping, just because I think it will look so elegant.  Thanks for a lovely recipe, which I plan to use many more times!

Sooo good. Felt like I was eating at the Cheesecake Factory Restaurant. I used a cinnamon graham cracker crust which was sweet but not cinnamon and it offset the tartness. It was perfect. I did have to bake much longer, about an hour and a half. Couldn't wait for it to totally cool. It was delicious warm and cold. I think I liked it better a little warm.

Incredibly tart. I could eat it, but barely! To whomever may be making this, I would suggest slightly backing off the lime juice!

After much research I decided this was the recipe I wanted to try, it was perfect! I did read some of the reviews and due to that I did make the change of an extra egg and  1/4 cup of flour instead of the cornstarch. it didn't crack and was everything I hoped it would be, will definitely be making this again. Thank you to the reviewer who suggested using the garlic press for the limes it worked great! Served with a berry coulis and whipped cream.

Phenomenal. Cool and refreshing dessert. Followed recipe exactly with the exception of using real key lime juice. Couldn't find so used normal lime juice. Big hit and will make again.

One of my favorite recipes for cheesecake.  This is the second time I have made this recipe, came out perfect again !! Like others I added another pkg of cream cheese and an egg, a little more sugar.  I don't use a warm water to bake my cheesecakes, never have. Enjoy :)

I've made this awesome cheesecake a few times to rave reviews!  To give it a more tropical flare, I use 1/2 butter and 1/2 coconut oil in the crust and I also add toasted coconut flakes into the crust.  As suggested in some of the other reviews, I always top it with fresh whipped cream (great for disguising cracks if need be), sliced lime twists and some toasted coconut flakes.  Tastes just like the famous Key Lime cheesecake from Carolina Roadhouse in Myrtle Beach - my inspiration for finding a Key Lime cheesecake recipe in the first place!  ENJOY a taste of summer!

Tasted great and turned out well, this was also my first time making a bake style cheesecake in a springform pan - no problems. I added a little more graham crackers and sugar for a thicker, sweeter crust. Served with whipped topping and a couple pieces of fresh fruit for garnish - I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was delicious, but I did listen to the other commentators and halved the amount of lime juice to 1/3 of a cup. I also added double the lime zest. With those modifications, it turned out great! The amount of lime was just enough so you could taste it, but it did not overwhelm.

Made it with 1/3 key lime juice and 1/3 lemon. Served with nothing: no whipped cream. Think pie would be better.

I loved this cheesecake! I used the full amount of keylime juice listed in the recipe and it was perfect. Any less and you wouldn't get the full keylime flavor. I used a prepackaged graham crust to save time/energy and it was perfect.

This was my first time making cheese cake and it turned out wonderful! I was going to use my Aunt's recipe for key lime cheesecake but found out I didn't have sweetened condensed milk and not wanting to run to the grocery store, I decided to find one that has ingredients I already had in my kitchen. I did add a bit of sugar to the crust to make it sweeter and I actually spent my time juicing key limes but it was well worth it! but I think next time I won't use quite so much juice as it is quite tart and I'd like it a bit sweeter. that being said, I will make this again!

This has great flavor and was easy to make.  I love to cook and bake but this was the first cheesecake I have ever made but it won't be the last.  I used one of the other reviewers advice and used 1/3 c. key lime juice and 1/3 c. fresh squeezed lemon juice.  I cooked mine for 65 minutes and it wasn't quite done in the center ( I think my oven is off a bit) but that didn't stop us from eating it!  I used a muffin tin half filled with water below my pan and my cheesecake did not crack.

This was very good. My stepdaughter would have given it 5 stars but it was just a tiny bit too "limey" for me. Don't get me wrong I ate my fair share but next time I may cut back on the lime juice a bit.   FYI: Serve with Whipped Cream to help cut the limey factor.

the best cheesecake ever.  I was fortunate to have key limes from a neighbor, the balance was wonderful.  I even forgot to turn the oven off and let it sit, ended up baking it for almost 45 min. longer, but it turned out fabulous nonetheless.  My husband loved the zest in the cake.  You definitely need the whipped cream (get the real stuff, not Cool Whip) to balance out the tartness though.  So easy and delish!

Yummy!  This was absolutely fantastic!  I whipped cream with a few tablespoons of sugar and spread a thin layer on the top to counter the tang of the lime.  I then pipped the cream around the edges to add some decoration to the top with slices of lime. Everyone loved this!

I cheated and used a premade crust and omitted the lime zest.  Despite setting up well in the oven (and not cracking!), after being refrigerated overnight the end product was a little runny in the middle.  Whipped topping is a must to balance the extremely limey taste of the cake!  I will make this again (my husband liked it a lot) using less lime juice.

I made this and used most of the other people's changes.  I think if you are going to add more cream cheese, as others suggested, you should not cut back on the lime juice.  I don't think it was limey enough for my taste.  Also, if you have a convection oven, you can cut back on the baking time quite a bit, even by 15 minutes, so the center is still very jiggly.  It will set up perfectly in the fridge over night.

My 8 year old and I had a lot of fun making this together.  It came out pefect, was delicious and very refreshing.  I'm so glad I did not buy one from the store containing hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated fats which are a health hazard, can't believe the FDA haven't banned them here yet.

This cheesecake is missing something, ... until you add a scoop of 'Cool Whip' to each slice.  The thick, creamy cheesecake is very lime-y - however the light, fluffy cool whip balances the texture and the sweetness moderates the lime flavor.

This gets a 4 because of my changes only!  Yum!!  I made this 2 days ago for my daughter's 18th birthday.  She loved it! I did take some others' advice and added a 4th block [8 oz] of cream cheese.  That was a good idea!  It was still very tart!  Also, I reduced the key lime juice by 1/4 cup.  I didn't have any graham cracker crumbs on hand, so I made the crust myself from flour, sugar, a stick of butter and 1 egg yolk.  Thanks for the great recipe! :-D

If you are expecting a Cheesecake taste this recipe is NOT for you.  It has the texture and look of a cheesecake, but a great lime flavor.  This was so perfect on a hot summer day - I didn't change a thing.  My fiance HATES cheesecake, so I lied and told him this was a type of Key Lime...he loved it.  After devouring his 2nd piece, I confessed to the cheesecake but he told me this was one recipe he wanted on a regular basis!  Thank you for sharing! The only thing I will do differently next time is to double the recipe so that it fills a 9" springform - I prefer a deep dish cheesecake.

I was expecting a cheesecake taste.  This is sour like lemon bars.  It's good, it's just not what I was hungry for.

Everyone loved this--especially my husband who has a HUGE sweet tooth. I didn't use the springform pan on my first attempt because some of the reviewers said that it worked in a 9" crust, but I ended up with too much filling so I filled ramekins with the extra filling and baked them--they were also good, but I missed the crust. : ) I LOVE the version from the Cheesecake Factory Restaurant, which is creamier.
