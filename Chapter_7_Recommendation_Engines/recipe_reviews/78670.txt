This is a very good recipe.  However, I skipped the slow cooker part. Just saute the onion and garlic in a bit of olive oil, season the chicken and then brown it in the skillet.  Mix the dressing and you're ready to eat. Much easier and faster this way.

This was easy to make and a hit with my family, ages 1, 4 and 35.  I liked it too.  I used chic thighs.  I didn't have lemon pepper either so I added salt and pepper to the spice mixture and then added a bit of lemon juice (bottled) to the crock pot before cooking.  after 5 hours on low (instead of 6 on high), it was super tender, not dry and perfect for gyros. yummy.

This was okay, but didn't live up to the idea.  It was very dry and not that flavorful.  It's way too much time in the pot for this amount of chicken with no liquid... the onions were blackened and gave it all a funky taste-- and I took it out an hour early!  I would love to find a good recipe for a Greek Gyro, to get the meat tender and moist like slow roasting does... this is not it.

No good at all.  Sorry.  This really lacked flavor which suprised me.  I really don't know what else to say but other than it tastes really bad.  99.99% of the recipes that I make from this site are awesome.  But just not this one.  Thanks for taking your time to post this recipe though:)

I went by this recipe just about as is, only thing I changed was to turn the crock pot to low for the 6 hours instead of high - as others had suggested.The only thing good about this meal was the cucumber yogurt and the pitas. When I got home from work the edges of the chicken were not only brown, but dry and cracking.. we were hungry so decided to salvage what we could. The remaining chicken had a dry consistency and and an odd texture. On top of the terrible texture of the chicken, the spices used in the mixture did don't fare well with the cucumber sauce. It was like drinking a glass of koolaid and then a glass of milk... didn't work at all. I am very disappointed in this recipe, without making major adjustments I just don't feel I'd ever make this again. :(

The flavors of this recipe are a good base, but the chicken turned out very dry after cooking in the crock pot all day. The next time, I will marinate in the onion and spices all day and cook stove-top.  Also, salt, garlic and fresh ground pepper are a definite must for the cucumber sauce.  We will make again with these adjustments.

Ran out of time to get into the slow cooker, so I made it on the stove top in about 1.5 hours and it came out well.  The "show-stopper" was the yogurt sauce.  Every last bit was gone and sauces don't usually go over very well at my house!

I tried this earlier today and it came out very well.  Reading complaints about the chicken drying out during cooking I brined the chicken first and it came out just fine.

My family likes this recipe very much.  I agree with other reviewers about the chicken's dryness, so I add a little chicken broth to the bottom of the crock as well.  I don't use lemon pepper, but I do add sliced fresh lemon to the bottom of the crock with the onion and mix pepper with the oregano and allspice to season the chicken.  I've done it the same way in the oven when I was in more of a hurry and it was just as good.  We like to add dill to the yogurt sauce, too.  Thanks for sharing!

This was mediocre, will not make again. I don't think cooking the chicken breasts in the Crockpot produces a gyro style meat. I'll stick to grilling my chicken gyros.

I would have to agree that this chicken came out very dry. I followed all of the directions and didn't make any changes. I did like the cucumber sauce.

I followed the directions perfectly and the chicken turned out dry and with very little flavor.  I will never make this again.

Awesome chicken pita. This was soo good that I ate three in one night!! The first two I made, I ate them the way the recipe mentioned, but the last one I ate I add feta cheese to it to enhance flavor. The only thing I did differently was instead of cooking chicken in slow cooker for 6 hours, I did a quicker method by grilling onions and chicken on stovetop. The next time I prepare this I will try it in the slow cooker. Overall great and healthy dish.

To make this authentic Greek. Take chicken shavings, put in a whole piece of pita bread as if it were a tortilla (do not break apart bread). top with raw onions, tomato slice or two. french fries, cayenne, and tsaziki sauce. That's how they make them. For an added amount of unhealthy flavor, deep fry the pita.

We liked the flavor, and we did use the lemon pepper seasoning as in the recipe. It did not come out dry at all, it was very tasty. However, I used a different tzatziki sauce from this site. I will make again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish!  I added extra garlic and used fresh lemon juice rather than lemon pepper and it came out quite tasty.  I used a seasoning called "Garli Garni" in the sauce and sprinkled it over the chicken before cooking it and it really gave it that extra garlic kick that gyros are notorious for.  I highly recommend this!

My family really did not enjoy this recipe at all. I believe it was the lemon pepper seasoning we objected to the most. May have been better using lemon juice and pepper as others have tried.

It was dry in spite of cooking less time and adding some of my own touches. I would not make this in the slow cooker again.

Is it correct that the cooking time/temp should be on high for 6 hours and that no liquid is added to the slow cooker? I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with scorched black garlic and onions and something that resembled a meat jerky. It was completely inedible.

I liked it but what I did was grilled the chicken on the bbq. Its quicker and it stayed moist.
