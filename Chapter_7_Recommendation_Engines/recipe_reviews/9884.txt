OK, I can not believe I am about to type this, but, these are so much better than store bought! And, I love store bought. I am a chocoholic.... these are amazing. I did leave out the cofee and cinomin because I just wanted brownies.(Oh, I also did half brown sugar half white) These are so moist and fudgy, just like I like them. If you like cakey brownies these are not it. If you want a rich creamy fudgy chocolate dream of a brownie, look no further. Oh, and make sure to let them cool in the fridge before you cut them or they will crumble. I also halved the recipe and baked in a 7x11 pan and it worked great.

These turned out rather dry and needed the frosting to redeem them. I've taken the idea and added instant coffee to the "Best Brownies" recipe on this site, and that turns out wonderful, no frosting necessary.

They went together pretty easily and tasted good.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the texture - I like my brownies chewier, these were pretty crumbly.

This is my first attempt at making brownies and it turned out fantastic! On top of that, it was really easy to make. I didn't have unsalted butter at that point of time and used salted butter instead and i used baking chocolate instead of choc chips, really yummy. My family and collegues loved it! Thanks for this fab recipe Mary Beth.

This is a great recipe. I do make a couple of changes though. Instead of baking in 4 8x8 pans,I baked them in two 9x13 pans. Also try topping with pecan pieces and a few mini chocolate chips before baking YUM!

Chocoholics dream! Very easy to make, and made the whole house smell so lovely... The brownies were a little bit on the dry side, though that might be my own fault. Watching brownies in the oven and a house full of son's friends does not go together very well, and I did get the pan out of the oven good 8 minutes after the timer rang. I will be making these again though.

Psst: 2 pounds = 32 ounces of chocolate chips. I usually buy the bags to equal 32 ounces, or close enough to so that I can eye the amount.

I halved this recipe, so maybe that's why I got such bad results. The brownies came out really  dry and cakey, not moist and chewy at all.

I tried these brownies, but changed one thing. I used half chocolate chips and half reeses cups. (I didn't have enough chocolate chips haha) They turned out fantastic! My husband loved them and we finished them much quicker than i thought we would =)

I loved these brownies. Since some of the reviews said they came out dry, I only used 1/3 cup of flour (for 12 servings) which equals half of what the recipe calls for. They turned out very similar to the consistency of flourless cake. I plan on making these again this week!

Very nice, creamy flavor. I think a little oil would help the texture be more fudgy. I found it a little cakey.

These were very good- and simple to make, so a great choice for a last minute potluck or gift. The coffee really enhances the flavor of the chocolate. These are rich and only for chocolate lovers!

Yum! Yum! Yum! If you like chocolate and you like the flavor of coffee, go no further this is the recipe for you. The only change I made was to cut the recipe in half.

Good flavor, but definitely a more cake like texture than a brownie-like texture...could have been my fault though I cut the recipe in half and accidnetly added too much butter.  I'll have to try again and report back.  Howeer, it was good enought that I would still make it again.

AMAZING!  Gave these at Christmas and they were just LOVED.  Easy to make, fun to give ... popped them into 8x8 pans and gave them in the pans with a little label and bow.  Raised brownies to a whole new level.

These were terrific!  I made them to ship to overseas military, for a Sunday Schoo lclass Christmas project, since the original post said they freeze well; they were so good, I had to make another (huge!) batch for our family!

I love cappuccino and coffee but I did not love this recipe.  The texutre of the brownies was good, but I had made them to give to my friends for christmas and the taste didn't seem right and wasn't good, so I kept them at my house.

FANTASTIC! It makes a lot, so I do freeze them and I actually think they may even be better that way.  The cold seems to bring out some of the flavors.  Very tasty brownie.  Thanks Mary Beth!

Three stars because this recipe looks good… but I can’t actually try it, because I have no idea how many cups of chocolate chips equals 2 pounds. I don’t have a kitchen scale. So, all I can do is rate the recipe itself, not the finished product. I’m eager to try it, though, as soon as I translate this quantity into a form I can use!

These were perfectly awful!!  I halved the recipe so maybe that's why it did not turn out.  They were dry and crumbly.  All I could tast was sugar.  I even added an extra tablespoon of instant coffee and still was unable to taste it.  I was very disappointed.

I like this recipe because it makes a bunch.  I used a 9 X 13 and a couple of 8 and 9 inch square pans.  They were moist..almost too moist but after a couple of days (I used them for gift baskets) they were just the way I liked them. Next time I will add more instant espresso powder (which is what I used instead of coffee granules) to give them a really strong coffee flavor.

I am at the end of my "testing new cookies" for our annual Christmas cookie exchange and these are AWESOME! 
I was surprised about the amount of eggs that go into this recipe. When the pan was removed from the oven.....THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL and were very moist. My friends that stopped by tried them and now they are asking for more! At least I am guaranteed a hit for the cookie exchange! 

Thanks,

These got rave reviews!  They're very thick and chocolatey and everyone kept asking for more.  The only drawback is that I couldn't really have one for myself to try; I absolutely detest the taste of coffee and could even taste it in these.  However, everyone else loved them!

These were very good brownies to me! I had to split the recipe to 1/4 because of the lack of pans and ingredients I had, but they still came out pretty well. The only problem that I really had was the baking time, or perhaps the temperature. After chilling in the refrigerator, they came out with the texture of fudge, but it didn't stop me from eating them! Om nom nom...

They were pretty good...a little bitter.
Easy to prepare though.

Everyone seemed to like them okay, but they were a little dense and sweet for my taste.
