I found this to be an ok starter.    First off, using only 2 quarts of water doesn't get you anywhere near close enough to the liquid you need after cooking the soup bone for 4 hours.   It needs minimum of one quart more.   I made up the difference adding in beef broth during the vegetable cook part of the recipe.  I also found it had too much tomato flavor for my tastes and would omit the tomato paste completely in the future.   And the salt is WAY off.   As written, the recipe contains 2358 mg of salt per serving, and I found that it made more than 10 servings as it stated, so it's probably over 3000 mg per serving.   I used 2 teaspoons for the entire recipe instead of 3 Tablespoons.   This seemed about right.    I also feel that the paprika is at least double of what it should be.   I will not make again.

Didnâ€™t use soup bones. I used beef bouillon concentrate and it was excellent, and much faster.

I used ground pork in the soup, as that is what I had on hand.  It wasn't very good that way.  I was hoping to match the flavor of a borscht I used to get at a little restaurant in L.A.  I will keep looking.

Also wanted to mention that I think is use half as much tomato paste next time.
