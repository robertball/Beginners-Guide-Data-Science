This recipe is just a little off.  It should be 3 cups of powdered sugar and 2 egg whites and a pinch of salt.  That works much better.

Almond paste is so expensive to buy - I called the local baking supply stores and got prices from $16 to $20 a pound. The almonds cost $4 and the sugar was probably $2, plus two egg whites and a little almond oil - maybe anyother buck. So it turned out to cost about $7 a pound making it myself, plus the time.

It was pretty easy to make. When the ground almonds, sugar and eggs are combined, the mixture looks quite shaggy and needs a good kneading. 

It's hard to understand what 12 servings means; it would be better to say how many cups or pounds it makes. 

I used it in pignoli cookies, which calls for more sugar and eggs, plus pine nuts to cover the tops. They came out great.

I followed directions completely, and this is easy to mix up-but I think I will continue to buy the stuff from the store as I prefer the taste of the store bought over this recipe.  This paste seemed a little runny and I had oozing of egg white and sugar from the sides of my pastry which took away from the appearance of the finished product.

I made this with good results following the original recipe.  I used this almond paste in an almond shortbread recipe and no one could tell the difference.

I haven't actually made this particular recipe. Honey has always been used in my family.  It makes a thick paste that is easier to handle and tastes better.  Try Almond Paste II.

Smaller version of recipe:  4.5 ounces blanched almonds, 4.5 oz powdered sugar, not quite all of a large egg white, 1/3 tsp almond extract.  Just right in food processor!  Makes 1 lb of almond paste.  Looks just like the stuff I buy in the can.

Excellent recipe although I used only two egg whites after reading reviews it was too sticky. Works beautifully! I even blanched my raw almonds to get started. A pound of almond paste for less then $3!

I made this except I ran my almonds thru the grinder attachment on my kitchen aid stand mixer about 5 times. Came out perfect also I added 1/2 tsp kosher salt, and only used the 3 cups of confectioner sugar and 2 egg whites... Also for people who said it was too loose don't sift the sugar pack it into your measuring cup to get the right consistency. I also felt it needed more extract and added 2x as much as called for. My yield was 3 cups and the recipe I have only calls for 1/2 so to freeze wrap 1/2 cup portions tightly in plastic wrap and tie off like sausage and place inside another freezer bag.

Way too runny.  Added a lot mote icing sugar but it still wasn't as good as when I have made it before.  Ended up making a shortbread base, spreading it on top and when baked, added a chocolate topping.

This almond paste recipe is fabulous.  I blanched and peeled the almonds before making it.  I didn't have confectioner's sugar, so I made my own using a coffee grinder.  I did add 1/2 tsp. more almond extract because I thought it made it taste better, and it really did.  I used my Cuisinart food processor and it was done in just a few minutes.  Clean-up is a breeze, too.  Made a ton of almond paste, which I stored in a large glass bowl with a tight-fitting lid, with a round of waxed paper pressed over the top of the almond paste.  Almond paste in the stores where I live costs upwards of $13/lb.  This cost only about $2.50 to make.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I gave this 4 stars because I had to adjust it. I used less egg whites and a little less sugar. I also added more extract to boost the flavor but that is just a preference issue. One thing I will mention is that if you don't have a really good processor, this is hard to get the right consistency. My processor is small and not great. I couldn't get the almonds ground fine enough so it turned out more like chunky peanut butter rather than a fine paste. I still used it tho.

I am new to this. I had no idea what blanching almonds meant and i thought this recipe would save me time and money looking for almond paste.  once i started the process there was no turning back. HOWEVER the paste tasted superb and i made almond squares (from this site also) with it and they came out super good.  My only issue was blending it.  i put all the ingredients at one time into my blender and it couldnt break down everything, so i got a chunkier consistency like someone else in the reviews got.  I didn't realize you needed to blend the almonds by themselves, so perhaps that contributed, but i dont know if it really would make a difference.  anyways, blanching almonds sucks almost as much as deveining shrimp SO if you must DIY, have loved ones around that will help you peel them :)

It's my first attempt to make almond paste and it's perfect! The paste is way heavier and stickier than I thought, but I suppose that's how it should be.

Well I tried the reciepe  and when it first came together it had such a wonderful almond flavour, but after sitting for a few hours until I was ready to use it and baked it in my pastries,it had no almond flavour what so ever. so my pastries had no flavour, Should I have added more flovour before baking ?????

I used this as the center for my stollen.  It was perfect. My neighbor's daughter-in-law said it was as good as anything from her native Germany.  While it isn't marzipan it works as a reasonable substitute in my stollen recipe. And it is easy!
