This was very good- my family loved it.  Because I used extra meat and because I love the flavor from the wine,  I used a good cup or so of it.  I don't think I'd consider the wine optional in this recipe since it's what makes it special.  Also, another reviewer mentioned that they subbed cream of mushroom for the golden mushroom soup.  That might do in a pinch, but they are very different things- I think the golden mushroom is more like a gravy.  Thanks for this recipe Amber- it was very, very good.

This was yummy! I used fresh, sliced mushrooms, so I added enough beef broth to cover everything. I served it over egg noodles and it was a hit.

Excellent! I added a large carton of sour cream to make it more like stroganoff.

This was fantastic with just a few tweaks.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and used 1/2 cup red wine to make up for the liquid missing from the mushrooms.  The fresh mushrooms really make the difference  and so does the wine...I don't recommend leaving it out.  Also added a cup of reduced sodium broth to cover the meat, but that made it a tad too salty, so I will use water next time or a mix of broth and water.  We don't even like mushrooms that much but this was super easy and delicious and the meat was very tender.  I served it over egg noddles and even my 4-yr old who hates everything ate some.

We really, REALLY loved this! I can't believe that these few ingredients produced such a delicious, comforting meal. The meat literally melted in our mouths~YUM! I served this over mashed potatoes, but think it would be equally as good with rice or egg noodles. This is a definate keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this as it reads and we really enjoyed it.  It had plenty of flavor and was very simple to make.  I will definately make again.

I followed the directions exactly looking for a new way to make beef stew. It was ok. The flavor was a little bland, even with adding wine. It just tasted like cream of golden mushroom and not much else.

Great basic recipe! I also used fresh mushrooms, added 1/2 C diced red onion and 1 C chopped carrots and 1 full C of beef broth (didn't have red wine). It was so yummy for my three boys.

This was very good and easy as heck. As I normally do, I read a bunch of reviews prior to making it. I added fresh mushrooms (you can't add too many if you like mushrooms) about 1/2-2/3 cup red wine, a dash of garlic powder, and a teaspoon of worcestershire. I also served it over egg noodles. Top round london broil was on sale, and looked much less fatty than the other roasts they had at the store, so I used it.. I trimmed the visible fat before cutting into strips and cubes. The roast started at 1.8 lbs prior to the fat-trimming, and was plenty of meat. I greatly varied the size of the cuts of meat to see what happened to them after so many hours of cooking. After about four hours, I thought I'd like to have more gravy at the end, so I added a cup of beef broth (water and a cube). With about an hour to go I added a half cup of flour to thicken it up. It made for a fairly thick gravy if you like it that way, which I do. A quarter cup of flour would have been fine, however. I cooked it on low for 6.5 hours, but it didn't need that long. The large pieces of meat fell apart with a fork. With the tweaks I made, it was absolutely delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

Me and my family absolutely LOVED THIS!! I was trying to find a different way to use beef stew meat and this is it! I am making for the second time in 2 weeks as I type this. I followed the recipe but subsituted fresh mushrooms, and before i added the wine and golden mushroom i added enough beef broth to cover it all and added some garlic powder the second time. but was AMAZING as written as well THANK YOU!!

This was really good. My family and I really enjoyed it. The meat was nice and tender and the gravy was very tasty. We don't normally like mushrooms but didn't mind them in this. Served it over white rice. Will certainly make this again.

Really enjoyed this. However, I found it soupy so I eliminated the extra 1/4 cup fluid. This was very good over noodles instead of rice.

Overall I thought it was decent.  I added more wine than called for and served it over egg noodles.  I liked that the gravy was thick, but it was very salty and I didn't even add salt.  I think next time I will use fresh mushrooms and more veggies.

the meat was tender but it lacked flavor. My husband ended up puting a bunch of spices on it and adding worcestershire sauce to give it some kind of taste.

I love great meals I can throw in the crock pot before leaving for work in the morning.  After a busy day, the last thing I feel like doing when I get home is starting a recipe from scratch.  The house smells great when I walk in, and the thinking part of cooking dinner is already over!  I make the rice in my rice cooker about 30 minutes before we want to sit down.  This was easy and delicious and will be one of my new go-to crock pot meals!  Thanks for sharing!

This was edible but not that good.  While the meat was very tender, the sauce just didn't do it for me (and I love mushrooms).  If I had to make it again, I would definitely use fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Don't skip the red wine if youre going to make this.

Big time family favorite, and so easy! I used fresh Baby Bella mushrooms instead of canned, and made up the liquid difference with more red blend wine. This is the second time I've made it, and everyone has RAVED each time. Too easy to believe and incredibly delicious!

I had to remove the broth and give it a cornstarch slurry to thicken the broth but other than that it was very yummy, would definitely recommend tenderizing the beef beforehand, but definitely a keeper, next time I'm going to add dumplings in lew of rice.

I made this yesterday for dinner. I doubled the ingredients though. I had it set for 8 servings but did more. Very delicious and will be making it again. 

I didn't add red wine. It still turned out great. 

Had leftovers for lunch today yummy.

I didn't have the mushroom soup so I made my own  gravy with beef stock and flour  in a shaker and mixed well before adding. I also added onions and garlic and red pepper flakes for a little spice. Thanks for the dinner idea I was desperate for something to make that I didn't have to go to the store for.

My family loved this and I have made it twice now. First time I make it I followed the recipe exaclty and was happy.  Second time I made a few little adjustments and loved it. Instead of using the golden mushroom soup which has so much extra additives in it I  added tomatoes past, garlic, and beef broth (which is the main ingredients in the canned soup). I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned which is way better. I served this on a bed of egg noodles and put a little fried onions on top to finish it off. I will definitely make this again with my new tweeks.

I followed what others suggested & it was delicious! I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, used 3/4 cup red wine (definitely would not leave it out!) & used a cup of water which was definitely too much (would try 1/2 cup next time). I was able to thicken it so it was still delicious! Will definitely make this again, thanks to all for the suggestions!!

Made with sirloin tip steaks.  Good,but needed to add some chicken bouillon for more flavor. There might be better tasting recipes, but was easy to make and the meat was very tender.  Will make again.

This came out bland and watery for me. I used fresh mushrooms but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I had to add some flour to thicken and then some peri peri marinade sauce to add some flavor after which everyone loved it.

My boyfriend loved this dish! Next time I will double the recipe to have more leftovers. I poured the stew over mash potatoes. I added half an onion and a little more than the quarter cup of wine for a little extra flavor.

My twin 8 year old boys loved it.  My husband and I thought it was pretty salty.  I didnt have red wine, but other than that followed recipe to a T.  Served over white rice.  So easy to make and makes the house smell great.  Its 7 degrees outside now, so this was nice for the kids to come home to.  Thank you!!

This was different.  I had stew meat on hand and wanted to make a stew but sorta forgot that it would take me hours to make.  So, I found this recipe and tried it.  It's pretty much like a beef stroganoff and that isn't really one of our favorite meal.   I followed the directions pretty much exactly. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and I couldn't find "golden" mushroom soup so I used the regular cream of mushroom. I left out the optional red wine. I loved that it came together in the slow cooker so that I could get the rest of my chores done without thinking about dinner. The flavor was really good. IF you like beef stroganoff then you'll really like this... I would've like my mushrooms to have stayed whole...but as mushrooms do, they shrink! =)   I made both white rice and mashed potatoes and have to say that the rice was far better with this dish.  I mixed them and the rice absorbed some of the liquid and it really was quite good. I'm not sure I would make this again.  The kids (4 of them) ate it and said it was fine but not their favorite. They finished their plates but didn't ask for seconds. Overall, pretty good...
