I would have to agree that this cake is much too sweet.  It sounded so good but a little piece went a long way .

I wasn't fond of this recipe - the daiquiri mix made it way too sweet.

This definitely has to be done as cupcakes. The cupcakes baked rather quickly too. I'll have to try it again to see if I can get it right. I tried it as a cake and the middle sunk in and it just crumbled once I put it on the cooling rack.

It is very sweet but works great as cupcakes or mini cupcakes!

I actually used this recipe to make cupcakes rather than a cake. Everyone that tried them raved about how delicious they were, but I just thought they were ok. I am giving them 4 stars, which is between what myself and my guests thought. I used vanilla icing on them, but my sister commented (and I agreed) that cream cheese icing probably would have been better. They also didn't rise as well as a normal cupcake would, but all in all, it was an interesting, different twist on a regular strawberry cake/cupcake, and it's a fun idea for a party.
