The celery just wasn't doing it for me.  I might have liked it better if I had cut back on the whole cranberries, it was just too "heavy" or sweet.

I had this (or something very similar) at a restaurant in New Braunfels TX years ago and I never forgot the taste.  I decided this recipe would be a unique twist on the boring old cranberry sauce at the holidays.  I served it at a Christmas party and everyone loved it.  Don't chicken out on adding the celery.  It sounds weird but it tastes really good!!

This recipe is great. I followed the recipe pretty much as is but I omitted the celery. I didn't feel as though it was necessary for this dish. It is super sweet but I liked that about it. If you don't like super sweet stuff, I suggest cutting back on the cranberry sauce and doing half a can. Fantastic dish. Thanks for sharing.
