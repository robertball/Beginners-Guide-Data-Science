I've made these several times for Jason and myself as a light lunch or dinner.  I've made them by Anita's original recipe, and I've also made the following changes:  I've added shredded swiss cheese and chopped onions and red and yellow peppers as well as green.  I've added a chopped, seeded jalapeno pepper to the mix.  I've substituted cubed cooked ham and also cubes of kielbasa instead of bacon. And I've replaced the Parmesan with Ricotta for a richer filling.  I'm convinced that there is no way to mess this recipe up-it turns out perfect every time.  Thanks Anita-your recipe is great as is, but serves VERY well as a foundation for changes!

Absolutely delicious! I did add my own seasonings (garlic, onion, pepper and italian) and once the tomato was stuffed, I topped with some bread crumbs, parm cheese and a little olive oil. Thanks Anita!

I made lots of changes. We're vegetarian, so no bacon. Used feta instead of parmesan. Diced and sauteed: 1/4 onion, 1/3 red pepper, 1 yellow squash. Added to all of the tomato pulp (diced and lightly drained). Used fresh basil instead of what the recipe called for. Oh, and breadcrumbs instead of croutons. Really good!

This recipe was a great sidedish to my dinner tonight! I cut the tomatoes in half and tried to stuff them that way, but that wasn't a good idea. Not a lot would fit into them, and they kept tipping. Make sure to cut off just the top of the tomato; it will taste much better! The croutons were also a nice touch.

I did make changes to this, before adding the filling I smeared the inside of the tomatoes with sun dried tomato paste. I used a yellow bell pepper and chopped the parsley into the mix if I'd used it as a garnish hubby would have just put it on the side of his plate. I also made the croutons. Served with a rice salad this made a nice light evening meal. Thanks

One of the most succesful recipes I have tried off of allrecipes; my brother and I really enjoyed this

After reading the comments from a few reviewers, I upped the ingredients to avoid running out of stuffing, of course I ended up with too much, but the mixture is so flavorful (the bacon really sets it off) that it can be combined with lettuced for a great salad or mixed in with other vegetables

I used both shredded and canned parmesan cheese; I also mixed together bread crumbs and canned parmesan and sprinkled the mixture on the tops before baking.

Others mentioned that the green pepper didnt work for them; it worked fine for me so I think its a matter of taste.  This is definitely a keeper for me

This were better than I expected - I was trying to use up some leftover garden tomatoes. I used six small to medium tomatoes and only had enough stuffing for five - so I would be more generous when making the filling. I used Romano cheese and some fresh snipped basil too.

Very Delicious- I cored out the entire inside of the tomatoe and used a little of the insides for the stuffing- TRY FETA CHEESE for this recipe as well as spinach and italian bread crumbs- made for a delicious side dish- The feta cheese really makes it!

I overall liked this recipe, although it needs a bit more flavor. Instead of bacon I used turkey sausage, and also added onions. Will make it again!

I have made this recipe so many times. It's so good.  I am a vegetarian so     I don't inlcude the bacon, but I don't think the flavor suffers.  I also use all the tomato pulp and make the walls of the tomato thinner so i have more filling to work with and more room to fill.

I don't always like tomatoes but I really enjoyed this.I used plain croutons, not seasoned.  The kids didn't like soggy croutons, so a bit of cooked rice could be substituted.

Made these tonight & they were wonderful!!  The recipe is perfect as is and is also a great jumping off place if you want to change it up.  We had hollow tomatoes from the garden, so I did have to sacrifice the pulp from a regular tomatoe for the recipe.

Delicious! made it a bit healthier with cut up turkey instead of bacon and added onion and garlic. As for the seasoning which I thought needed, added basil, oregano and a bit of thyme.

I loved the filling. I did find out that I was out of croutons at the last minute so I used bread crumbs and seasoned them. None of us liked the tomato though.

I didn't use the bell pepper or parsley, simply because I forgot about the parsley and dislike bell peppers with a passion, but it turned out pretty good regardless. The croutons mashed up really made an awesome filler with the bacon & leftover tomato. Simple. Fun to make. And very enjoyable to eat.

I thought the inside was really mushy :(  My husband liked it though, but I will probably try to find another recipe for stuffed tomoatoes, or try to do something about it being so mushy.

Ok, so I made this for my Super Bowl party and these were the only thing that didn't get rave reviews. I think there was something missing. I pretty much followed the recipe (except I added some sauteed mushrooms and onions). I think that next time I'll do as others suggested and add serranos (for a kick) and some seasonings to the mix. I think this has the potential to be good, but it does need a little doctoring.

I think this recipe shows a lot of imagination.  It's very good.  I made the croutons myself so they would be small enough.  I will make this recipe again.

Just made these! I didn't have bell pepper so I used diced onion. I made my own croutons out of 1 slice of wheat bread, buttered on both sides - 1 side with a little sprinkle of garlic powder and other side with a sprinkle of Italian seasoning. Added: 1/4 tsp of Olive Oil, 1 tbs Italian seasoning and shredded Colby Jack cheese to top.

I tried it w/o the bell peppers, b/c I hate bell peppers, and they still turned out delicious! Once I ran out of croutons and used bread crumbs instead, and it was really yummy!

I took these to my family's as a vegetable side dish on Easter.  All the adults loved them!  I thought these were very easy to make and very flavorful.  I'll definitely make again.

I added basil and garlic to the mixture, and used bread crumbs instead of croutons, but I'm sure they would have been delicious as written anyway.  Very good, and easy.

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was a great way to use up some of the abundant tomatoes from our garden. To cut down on the time and mess, I microwaved the bacon instead of pan- frying it.

This was delicious, I can't believe my husband actually liked it!  I cut the bacon by half and replaced it with cooked ground hamburger and I also mixed in all of the pulp instead of discarding it to make it jucier!! Terrific recipe!

I made this as a side dish to accompany crab cakes and corn on the cob. I did not make any changes except instead of croutons, I used Italian herb seasoned panko bread crumbs. It was a huge hit with fresh red tomatoes in season. Will make again and many requests for recipe by dinner guests!

I used brown rice because that was all I had, and we try to eat brown rice more than white. The taste was great, but the tomatoes collapsed...maybe they were too ripe. So, they didn't look great, but tasted nice...even my youngest son who is often hesitant to try new things liked it!

This turned out amazing! So flavourful and delicious (and I don't even like tomatoes raw) I used garlic and herb feta cheese, and I added onions with the green peppers which I sauteed in the bacon fat before adding it to the stuffing mixture. Went great with steak and salad. Enjoy!!

Not bad. Quick to throw together, cute presentation. Next time I add this to a meal I'll tailor the spices and cheese to the main dish. The framework in this recipe holds together well for many different tastes.

Even great leftover.  Be sure to reheat in oven.  One of the kids put it in the microwave and it got soupy.  But it was a hit at our house.

I used this recipe as a base for what I had in my fridge. I put carrots and green peppers in also. I added ground beef along with the bacon to make it a bit more substantial. It made more filling than I anticipated.

This was OK, but not great. I think the stuffing needs more flavour - onion, garlic, that kind of taste. I also didn't like the green pepper still being crunchy after the tomatoes were done. I would saute it with the onion and garlic. It was nice, though to have a stuffed tomato without rice for a change.

These were a beautiful side item that I served with grilled chicken. The veggies were a little on the crunchy side so I probably would had sauteed them ahead of time. Overall, great recipe!

The husband followed the directions to a "t" and they were great!  Great diet food too!  If not for the diet, I'd probably drizzle the stuffed tomatoes w/some olive oil.  Ooh, and cook up the peppers a little beforehand in some bacon grease!  Mmm!

Would have given it the fifth star, except the green peppers were too raw and crunchy for my taste. Next time i'll saute them to soften them up a bit. But the flavors are fantastic!

My husband loves these, the pesto makes it interesting. I actually "grilled" them by wrapping them in tin foil and putting them in a frying pan on my gas stove top, because i live in an apartment without access to a grill. Worked great!

I make spinach stuffed tomatoes occasionally, it's a side dish favorite.  I made this for my wife last night.  I left out the bell pepper, she don't care for that.  But the bacon was a hit!  Plus, I mixed in some shredded cheddar, and covered the tomato with a slice of provolone about 3 minutes before taking it out of the oven.   She gave it 5 stars.

Rather tasty!  My husband gave it a strange look at first, but enjoyed the taste.  I used large Caesar-style croutons so they needed to be crumbled in the mixture.  Will definitely use this one again as it was fairly simple to prepare.

Good!  I used yellow peppers too, making it really colorful!  It goes really well with pasta side.
