Oh baby! I've made these twice now. I don't think they can be "overbaked" as (the 2nd time I made them) I forgot to set a timer and after about 22 minutes blasted them out of the oven. They are wonderful! Also, this time around, I used 1 C chocolate chips and 1 C butterscotch chips.  Threw them in the fridge for 20 min since we couldn't wait to cut into them. Yumm-O!

Yup! These are good! Replaced half the chocolate chips with peanut butter chips and I'm glad I did! My father-in-law commented that these taste like the middle of a Reese's.

This was so good! I changed nothing and it was slightly underdone, but it was perfect all around. You can't not give it 5 stars I think!

My family loved this! I added a 1/2c if peanut butter chips and accidentally doubled the marshmallows. We had to cook it longer for about 45 minutes total. It browned nicely. But was still a little gooey in the middle after 2 hours of setting. By day 2 it was set better. Will continue making!!! Thanks!!

Wow! Yum! I didn't have mini marshmallows on hand, but I had large ones, so I cut those into six pieces and wow! This is one delicious cookie bar! I did read the reviews, so I knew to wait to cut them until completely cooled. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! My only advice would be to make sure they're totally cooled before you cut them into bars and serve them.

The first day I made these, I would've rated them 5 stars for flavor, but 4 stars because they were very crumbly and fell apart. However, by day 2, they held together wonderfully! Like a peanut butter s'more cookie! My family couldn't get enough!

Having grown up on Fluffernutters this recipe went in my favorites as soon as I saw it. I attempted to make it gluten free by using Cup for Cup gluten free all purpose flour.  I baked for an additional 10 minutes and I think it could have baked longer as it was still very undone in the middle and it ultimately fell while cooling. My family still ate it and liked the cookie doughiness of it. I agree with Diana and the marshmallows could be cut back. I will be making it again but with minor adjustments.

What a fun recipe! I used natural peanut butter and loved the taste of the butter, brown sugar, peanut butter and sugar mix. So delicious. Once cooled, this was very easy to cut into bars. It was a tiny bit crumbly, but it could be because there were too many marshmallows getting in the way of the batter adhering nicely. Still, so good--took this to the office today for a potluck and all the bars were devoured and the plate picked clean before the main dishes were even dished into.
