Mention "fudge" and I think of scalded pans, grainy shards, and fretting over a cauldron, stirring stirring stirring. Follow the directions and you will have a creamy, delicious batch, suitable for gift-giving.  This recipe goes into my "Tried & True" files.

I absolutely love making this fudge, and my family and friends absolutely love it when I make it too!  With this recipe you can use any kind of chips (chocolate, peanut butter, butter scotch) and it always turns out awesome!  But, mind you, I always omit the nuts and it still turns out fabulous.

This just may be the best chocolate fudge ever!  WOW.  I could eat the entire pan (and probably will).  It's also incredibly easy and no candy-thermometer needed!  I would suggest following the directions and lining the pan; I keep mutilating the fudge when I try to get it out of the pan.

I make this every Christmas. I like to make dark peppermint fudge with this recipe using dark chocolate chips, peppermint extract and chopped candy canes. Chopped marashino cherries and cherry extract make a great Cherry Cordial Fudge and you can even throw in peanuts instead of pecans and make a Rocky Road Fudge! It's a great recipe that you can play with and really make your own.

I am not a baker at all and i can barely make the easiest brownies.  I followed this recipe and i made the best fudge ever.  It was so good and so easy.  Instead of the pecans i used almonds.  If i can make this fudge anyone can.

It was easy to make, and took little time. But when came the time to cut the squares the fudge was not set. It spent more than 2 hours in the fridge, so I don't know what went wrong. They stll taste amazing, but they are too gooey and practicaly melt in my fingers. I would not give this batch as a gift or bring it to a pot luck, but I will make this again in a few weeks and let the mixture boil down a bit longer & do it a day ahead so they can sit in the fridge for a longer time. I hope I can get them to look presentable. =)

This is the best chocolate fudge recipe I have ever made. Anyone who has tried making fudge the "normal" way would probably very much agree! The trick to having the fudge turn out with nice, clean edges is to line your pan with waxed paper, let the fudge cool on the counter, then freeze the fudge for at least an hour. Remove waxed paper/fudge from pan then cut with a very sharp knife. I place mine on a marble cutting board. Wonderful for gift giving! :)

I was looking for a fudge recipe that was creamy and easy - this recipe was what I was looking for.  I would recommend putting in a 9X13 pan as the pieces were very large.  The flavor of the fudge improved over the course of the few days it lasted.

Really good! I only used 1 cup of sugar, and it was plenty. I also used fat-free evaporated milk to make it a bit lighter. For the marshmallows, I ended up using 1 cup regular marshmallows and 1 cup marshmallow creme, since that was all we had. Still turned out great!

I  made the CARNATION® Famous Fudge yesterday and it never hardened.  Also the sugar didn’t dissolve thoroughly and it was grainy.  I  used the microwave method.  I  didn’t notice if anyone else mentioned that when they said how successful theirs came out.  I  have another microwave fudge recipe which always comes out good maybe I  should use some of those directions.  It takes one can of condensed milk, 1 T butter and 1 and  a half packages of chocolate chips.  Stir these together and cook in MW oven for 5 minutes.  Then take out and stir, if chocolate chips are not melted.  (Or you can put back in oven for 1 more minute.)  Add 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Pour into buttered 8x8” glass pan.  

I  used foil in the bottom of the pan in the new recipe but it wasn’t really necessary as I  have to scoop out the fudge with a teaspoon in order to eat it.  Next time I  will cook for 5 minutes and maybe add more chips.  I  put in a cup of chips which should be 8 ozs.  But my package had 11.5 ozs in it.  I  will definitely try this again but with slightly different directions.

My great grandmother used to make fudge for the family every Christmas.  When she passed away, everyone missed her fudge and no one could figure out how she made it.  I made this recipe with a few minor changes and it was pretty darn close.  My grandfather even called me to tell me how much he enjoyed it.  This is a great recipe.

Really great. I used 1 lb of unsweetened chocolate and 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa, instead of chips and it came out wonderfully.

Tasty.  The consistency on mine was not so creamy but it's probably because I used fat-free evaporated milk and light margarine.  It's still good though.  Next time I think I'll add the marshmallows first, while it's still on the heat, then add the rest of the ingredients.  I like that it calls for only 1 1/2c choc-chips.  The last one I made called for 3 cups and made the same amount.

I have made a couple of batches of this so far this week. One I put some Andes peppermint baking chips on top and swirled them in. The other just put pecans in. I plane to make more using different flavor chips. Very easy recipe that doesn't take forever to make.

my go to recipe for fudge! I have made this over a dozen times at least.  And every time I make, I get great compliments and recipe requests.  I change up the morsels and the nuts all the time.  For someone who has never made fudge, with this recipe, I look like a pro! Who needs a thermometer??!?! Not me! =)

We used white chocolate instead of semi sweet and cut back a bit on the sugar. The flavour and texture is awesome, except that the sugar never melted. So when you're chewing, you crunch through each sugar grain... We'll definately try this again and try to figure out how to melt the sugar.

Very easy recipe!  TIP:  If the fudge seems hard after refrigeration, bring it out at room temperature (covered with plastic wrap) to soften and it will be easier to cut.

Tried  over this past holiday season. Melted chocolate first then added marsh mellows. Had to put back on heat to melt the marsh mellows which cause a slight gritty texture with chocolate. Will try and melt marsh mellows first then chocolate. This really was the first easy no fuss fudge i have tried. Will work on perfecting recipe, i am also a diabetic and reduced sugar since already sweetened by the other ingredients.

I make this recipe during the holidays and it always turns out perfect. I've never tried putting marshmallows in it though. Fudge always makes me think of Christmas. I don't think I could go a holiday season without making at least one batch.

pretty good for being such an easy recipe. I will try white chocolate chips next time and maybe macadamia nuts instead of the walnuts. i used colored marshmallows and it didn't make a difference @ all.

This recipe went together easily, but I overcooked it a little, thus the fudge was too dry for my taste.  I'll watch it carefully next time, but will definitely give it another try.

I loved this! I made it for a Christmas Party along with a ton of other teats and this was long gone before anything.

This is a very good, easy recipe.  I've made it twice, and both times I've been quite satisfied with the result.  I will definitely keep making this fudge.

When I made this it seemed to "set" very well in the pan, but when I tried to cut it, it had the consistency of chewing gum! I gave it two stars as it does taste very good but I have to pull off bits here and there. Maybe I did something wrong but I won't be trying it again to find out.

I must have done something wrong because this fudge did not work out for me.
