This was very good and easy.  I didn't add the green peppers, but I am sure they would have been great in the dish.  I did add a can of drained oysters toward the end of the cooking time.  Couldn't help myself, as I needed to move them out, and I love oyster dressing!  The dish would have been fantastic without them.  Thanks for the post.

I followed the basic directions and added some celery, minced garlic and sliced a decent sized jalapeno and it turned out great.

It all started with high heat and humidity and heat indices in the 100s. I had planned a casserole that baked for 1 hour in the oven. I turned to my slow cooker to try to keep the house cooler. I made this recipe exactly as written. I had thawed a bag of frozen broccoli, so that is what i used in the chicken -vegetable -soup mixture. This version was tasty. We thought that dressing in the middle was too gummy. Everything else was perfectly moist.

flavors were ok, a bit bland if I hadn't added seasoning, but the texture of the stuffing was foul. We prefer a firmer stuffing. It didn't work for us.

it is definitely a bland diet recipe. I'm not entirely sure how to bring the flavor up. I used boxed stuffing so maybe that was my issue. I did read the reviews, and changed the water to chicken broth. it didn't make much of a difference. it was still yummy, but I don't recommend this for those that like STRONG flavor.

Very disappointed.  It turned out mushy and muddled.  The bread disintegrated.  I followed the recipe exactally.  The only change I made was to add a couple stalks of celery and some extra seasonings.  This is a recipe I will not try again, not even with alterations. We ended up eating sandwiches.
