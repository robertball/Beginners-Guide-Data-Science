This gets points for easiness. Wasn't as flavorful as I expected, although hubby liked it. I mixed the seasonings in a ziplock for ease as lined the baking sheet with aluminum foil. I only made 3 thin boneless chips and found one packet of the ranch was just enough. I paired with a steam bag of riced cauliflower for a super easy meal.

I have always made this in a crock pot. Avoids the dryness and tough meat aspect. Follow the recipe only I double the ranch, add chicken stock but don’t cover the chops completely. Cool on low for 6-8 hours. The longer you cook the softer they will be. We always add in peppers, onions, and whatever else you would like with it. Quick, Easy and tasty. Nice alternative vs running the oven.

I changed up the baking time and temp for making these chips. Instead of baking chops at 450 for 20 mins, which in my option dries out pork, I broiled on high for 5-8 mins per side (depending on thickness) until done.  I also added a spicy seasoning to the mix. *My personal rule is when cooking any type of pork, I add about a 1/2 inch or so of apple juice to the pan. The juice helps to keep the pork moist while cooking and the flavor pairs wonderfully!!

I made this recipe as written.  It was easy to put together. The chops were moist and had a lot of flavor. I definitely will make this again.

I used two packets of ranch and cooked mine in the slow cooker.  Very tasty.  Would make again.

This was really good! The only reason I am giving it a 4 star is because it is not a must make again. But when in a pinch and little time this was really good! Kids gobbled it up. Thank you for sharing

Super easy to make, which is why I gave it a 4/5. The only reason it's not a 5/5 is because I am not huge on pork chops, period, but that was what my family wanted for dinner. I do think this was taster than how they ate theirs, which was with only salt. I ended up pan-frying them and I think the seasoning helped keep the juices in. I also chopped up some pieces and added it to my caesar salad.

I am not a fan of ranch salad dressing but this was very good.  Thick chops would work best.

I will make this again!  I used about a pound of pork and 4 red potatoes.  I used 1.5 packets of ranch mix.  Next time I would use 1 packet because this was enough with less pork.  I microwaved the chopped potatoes for 4-5 minutes before adding them to the pan to cook to make sure they finished at the same time as the pork.

I overcooked it a bit because I had big chops. However, it tasted pretty good. I ate it, my daughter ate it, and my husband all ate it with ease.

Also made as written.....but I had chops in a brine overnight which always helps make juicy chops, and then I found this recipe...and my chops where very thick so I had to add about 8 minutes into the cooking time....very easy and quite tasty. I love quick, easy meals.  I will definitely make this again.
