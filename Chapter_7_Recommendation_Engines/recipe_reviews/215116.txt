I made this recipe exactly as directed, but, it lacks a lot.  Not sure exactly what,  but I'd suggest some cumin, more onion, tablespoon or so of fish sauce, fewer apricots......  But, as written, not worth the effort.

I thought this had loads of flavour. It was delicious. I will make it again. I did a couple of things differently, I sauteed the onion and garlic first and then added all the other ingredients and added a little salt and pepper.

I made this recipe to get rid of my apricot preserves.  I thought it was delicious and flavourful served it over saffron rice with a side of red lentil Dahl.  That being said, I made a few substitutions:I cut the recipe in half, used 1-1/2 cups of homemade apricot preserves and a 1/2 cup of ED Smith, Apricot - Triple Fruits jam I had in the fridge.  I also ran out of onions and subbed in 1/4 cup of dried minced onion and I skipped the Thai chilli paste since I didn't have any.  I used my Patak's hot curry paste and Red Hot cayenne pepper sauce but felt it could have been hotter
