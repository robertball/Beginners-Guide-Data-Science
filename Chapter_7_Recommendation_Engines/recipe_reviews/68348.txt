I won't worry about whether this is a "brownie" or not because these moist bars are SO delicious! I'm glad to have found this recipe, it's one I've been looking for after tasting them at a potluck a while back. My husband would eat the entire pan! I chopped the apples rather than sliced, they distribute through the batter better in smaller pieces. I don't melt the butter, Ijust cream it with the sugar and beat in the egg. Don't be scared if the batter is stiff and it seems like it is mostly apples, that's how it is supposed to be and it will turn out fine. Also, when you take them out of the oven, sprinkle cinnamon sugar generously over the top...HEAVENLY!

I have made this recipe several times and it is a sure hit! Just had a few suggestions/modifications as follows: add 1 t vanilla, 1/2 t nutmeg, cut the apples (granny smith) into chunks instead of slices. Also top the batter with 3 T. softened butter, 1/3 brown sugar and 1/2 t cinnamon mixed together until crumbly. For me, it seemed to take closer to an hour to bake it Vs the 35 minutes stated in the recipe. Baker Jim, this is a wonderful recipe and thanks for sharing it with us!

This recipe definitely has merit! I found several of the reviews helpful in preparation for trying out the brownies. I creamed the butter with the sugar and eggs, added 1 t. vanilla, cut the apples to 2 (really 1 1/2 because mine were large), diced the apples and added them last to mixture.  I also used the topping of butter, br. sugar and cinnamon (spread the butter then sprinkler with sugar/cinnamon mixture) and baked for 45 minutes.  They turned out pretty moist, but have a delicious flavor; by no means a flop! I think cutting the apples to 1 cup or so(diced) might be key in getting more of a bar/brownie consistency that can be held in hand. I will make these again, I'm sure.

The misleadiing name alone makes this very disappointing because, unlike other reviewers, it DID matter to me whether or not these were brownies. I wanted these for a work function, where dealing with a too moist cake that doesn't stay in one piece wasn't an option. While the flavor is good, there's a fine line between being pleasantly moist and so moist it falls apart and borders on soggy.  I would call this an "excessively moist" apple cake, not an apple brownie.

Found a solution for the more like a brownie version.  I followed this recipe with a few minor adjustments - doubled the batch, 2.5 medium Granny Smith apples, a teaspoon of nutmeg and some dried cherries (about a half cup).  I too as many others had to increase the backing time to 55-60 minutes.  Started check at 45 minutes and the toothpick came out wet even at 60 minutes.  But, after the dish sat over night, it did come out a bit more sturdy but still more like a cobbler than a brownie.  Second try hit the mark.  Creamed the butter with the sugar instead of melting.  Added the eggs, dry ingredients and the apples and cherries last after combining all the others.  This turns out more like a dough than a batter and baked for 35 minutes.  Worked like a charm.  Apple brownies that are sill moist but cut like a brownie.  My test subjects liked both and I can use either depending on how I want to serve them.  Happy baking!

Absolutely delicious!  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9X13 pan.  I also left out the nuts and added a cup of mini chocolate chips.  Because it was doubled I baked it for close to an hour.  Will definitely make again!

these are very good and am sure that they are even more moist with a deeper flavor the next day.  I browned the butter slightly to give it a more caramel flavor, and added 1 tsp. vanilla, upped the salt to 1/2 tsp, and subbed tsp. apple pie spice for cinnamon.  thanks for the super easy recipe that was a great way to get rid of 3 lonely apples.

Good, but I doubled the recipe to make a 9X13 pan and it actually tasted too buttery and not apple-y enough for me. It was even a little greasy. May try again and sub applesauce for 1/2 the butter.

These were absolutely delicious! It is more like a cake than a brownie, but it was SO MOIST because of all the apples. THe texture was great too because of the sliced apples. I definately recommend following the recipe and slicing the apples instead of chopping them. I used 3 different kinds of apples, granny smith, jonagold, and golden delicious. I'm going to double this recipe, put it in a 13x9" pan and take it to some holiday get-togethers. The last one I took it to, it was gone in a flash!

Delicious!!  I doubled this recipe... 

-substituted 1/2 c. applesauce (unsw) for butter.
-cut sugar to 1 1/2 c. (when doubled)
-omitted walnuts (altho they'd be good)
-used half all-purpose, half wheat flour
-used only 1/4 tsp salt (in doubled recipe)
-added a little nutmeg and 1 or 2 tsp of vanilla

-Baked 45 or 50 min

These are great warm; I plan on serving with ice cream perhaps, too

These are so good! I used granny smith apples, and the sweet vs. tart taste was perfect. I thought it was a little strange to add the apples before the dry ingredients but it did all come together with a little stirring. Next time, I think I will try adding the apples at the end though. My family all enjoyed these! 
I will also try these with applesauce in place of the butter, and cut some of the sugar to make these super healthy...

Great flavor, but 35 minute bake time is WAY OFF.  It took mine a little over an hour!

after a few tries and adjustments with this recipe, it is absolutely one of my favorites.  don't get me wrong, it's also great as is :) but this is what i prefer - i double the recipe. i diced the apples and used 3 smaller granny smith and 1 golden delicious (what i had in the fridge). i only used 3/4 c butter rather than the full cup. i substituted oatmeal for the walnuts and then added a little extra (i love baking with oatmeal and it makes it a little healthier). i sprinkled some nutmeg in the batter as well, and then before baking, topped the pan with a little bit of white sugar, then a sprinkling of brown sugar. the pan took about 50-55 minutes to bake and is delicious! i look for reasons to make this recipe as often as possible, especially since most of the ingredients are easy to keep on hand.

These were marvelous, very moist with just the right amount of spice.  I followed the recipe exactly (but I only had two apples) and the brownies came out perfect.  Thank-you BakerJim.

I made a double batch, and made 12 muffins and a 9" x 13" pan, 25 min was enough for the muffins and I cooked the pan for 40 min. I was concerned to see the batter with so many apples, but it was great. I greased the pans well, and ran a knife around them and they came out without too much difficulty. The only substitution I made was use 25% brown sugar. These were a little to sweet for me even though I used granny smith apples. Next time I'll try cutting the sugar by half. This recipe is definately a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly and these were amazing. My husband said he actually like these better than my apple pie (which is his favorite dessert). They were like a brownie consistency, but an apple cake flavor. Will definitely make these again. The only thing missing was some vanilla ice cream.

1 word... AMAZING! These are so moist and delicious! Everyone picked these over the chocolate brownies! The second time I made these i served them with vanilla ice cream and smuckers apple cinnamon sauce and it was out of this world! Im sure you could use a caramel sauce for the same effect, this recipe is being added to my recipe box for sure!

I've made this recipe quite a few times.  Easy recipe and great flavor.  These are fantastic warm with some vanilla ice cream.  I made them a bit healthier by substituting applesauce for the butter.  They still stay very moist and you'd never know the difference.  My kids LOVE them and I made them over the holidays and my dad loved them too...so they are definitely good for young and old alike

Love love loved these!!!  They were a huge hit in my house.  I, too, diced the apples like some said (just preference) and left out the nuts because my dad can't have them.  Made them in a muffin tin for individual servings.  Wow.  I could have eaten the whole batch myself!

Brownies v. cake . . .I don't know what these are, and I just don't care--They are delicious!  Extremely easy, as well.  I didn't have any trouble with these in incorporating the apples or baking in muffin tins.  I had enough for a thin layer on an 8x8 pan and 12 muffins.  The muffins baked in 35 mins and the pan needed 45.  Either way, these are so worth multiple toothpick tests.  A tad too sweet for me, but that means for most pple they'd be fine, and I'll just cut the sugar a bit next time.  I love the apple chunks in every bite and the hint of cinnamon.  A definite winner in my book. They do stick a tad to the pan, so use a warm knife around the edges before pulling it out of the pan.  thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!!  Instead of putting them into one large pan I put them into a muffin pan and they turned out great.  I just modified the baking time to 25 minutes.  If I use small granny smith apples I put 3, if larger ones I use 2.  I also used half whole wheat flour and half white flour, as well as substituted half of the butter with unsweetened apple sauce to make it healthier.  I topped it off with granulated sugar for simplicity, but plan on trying a crumb topping next time

Nice to have a change in brownies and baked apples are good anyway. After reading reviews I did use 1/2 cinn 1/2 nutmeg. . wish i had remembered to substititue butter with applesauce. That is healthy but particularly a good idea for this recipe.

These tasted pretty good and were better after they'd sat around for a day, but they were more like an apple crumble than brownies.

Awesome!  These are easy and delicious. I used gala apples. I lightened the recipe a bit by doing the following:
-used light butter instead of regular.
-used Splenda instead of sugar.
-used 1/4 of Egg Beaters instead of the egg.
These subs were not noticeable in texture or taste. 

I didn't think the walnut flavor was very strong. Next time I will make these a bit more calorie friendly by using fat free margarine and eliminating the walnuts. 

Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!!

These have a good flavor and were easy to throw together. I tried making these in mini muffin shapes. Fail! They don't look very pretty next time I will stick to making them in brownnie form! I will definitely make these again.

Good. Gets compliments. It is really somewhere between a soft brownie and a cobbler rather than a true brownie depending on how much apple you use. Use less apples if you want it to be more brownielike.

I followed the recipe as it is. Only substituted the walnuts with raisins because I didn't have walnuts. It's so moist and nice. A little bit sweet for me, but my friends loved it. Thanks a lot for posting this. I will make it again with less sugar.

The key to a denser, more brownie-like bar is to NOT whip the egg mixture.  The fluffier it is, the more cake-like the finished product will be.  I melted the butter and just stirred in the sugar and egg until well-combined.  Very good!  Could use some extra spices, perhaps.  Thanks!!

Very good, I give it a four because I was concerned that I'd added way too many apples, so I ended up doubling the "batter".  It filled a 8x11 pan.  The blondies did end up with a more cake-like consistency, but when you drizzle them with a little caramel, they're heavenly! If you like walnuts, do not skip them.  They do add a great crunch to the blondie.  Thanks for the recipe BakerJim!

Easy and excellent recipe.  I made it exactly following the recipe. The only change I made was to bake it a little longer than 35 minutes and I sprinkled Cinnamon sugar on the top before I put it in the oven.  It was so easy and soooo easy to make.  Definitely would be crowd pleaser!

These brownies are overly sweet, and more apple than brownie. I thought that there were too many apples so I reduced the number to two, but the I realized that there is too little batter, not apples. Also, the amount of sugar should be reduced to set off the sweetness of the apples. Add half a teaspoonful more cinnamon to strengthen the taste and smell of cinammon.However, the taste of this brownie is very good and I shall make this again with said adjustments.

This is such a tasty and easy recipe! To me is more of a cake than a brownie, very, very moist. I reduced the sugar to ¾ cup and was enough for us, I don’t really like over sweet desserts. I also added ½ tsp vanilla extract and I didn’t add any walnuts because I didn’t have on hand. 
Next time I will use only half of the butter and some applesauce to cut on fat. Thank you BakerJim!

A not too sweet alternative to real brownies. They tasted rather on the healthy side. I guess that is a good thing. I think if I make these again I will add a brown sugar crumb mix to sprinkle on the top.

I also love this recipe and have made it many times. Have been experimenting with it and have great success. Adding chocolate chips complements it very well. Right now I am baking a batch substituting some of the butter with pumpkin and adding pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon. I also use less flour and add oatmeal. They are fantastic.   This recipe is a must try for anyone who loves apple and cinnamon. Plain or experimental it all works.  :) Thanks BakerJim.

Like others, I was a little concerned about how much apple and how little batter there was... but it all turns out beautifully!!  I made one batch in a 9x9 and cooked for extra time (15 mins) and one batch in a small cupcake tin and cooked for 5 extra minutes.

Well, I made these yesterday. First off, I have no idea why this even has a suggestion of "blonde brownie" in it - it is no where close. The only similarity is that they are both in a pan and both cooked!  

Now, the flavor is just fine in these. But I would not bother doing them again - there are plenty of other better recipes to use up apples and walnuts in, in my opinion.  It was very crumbly, would not hold together much.  I was really disappointed that it was not more brownie-like, as in more compact.  

Again, the flavor is fine, but it is hard to totally mess up flavor with the brown sugar/apple/walnut combos.  However, I didn't like the recipe overall, and won't make it again. :-(

These are SOOO good. I ate most of the pan. Be aware though, they're not really brownies. I'd call it more like "apple snack cake" or something like that. As someone else mentioned, I think I would cut the apples into chunks next time, not slices. I want to make them again, next time I'll try putting the vanilla in like someone suggested.

This was quite tasty, but it hardly resembled a "brownie" at all. That is, the texture was very loose and cutting it into squares was a futile effort. I shared it at a meeting, and others said they liked it a lot; I had two small helpings myself. So I can recommend this as a tasty dessert - just expect it to be a bit messy when serving it up.

this came out more like a cake than anything else.

also...granted, i made this in an 8x8 container, but it was completely battery in the middle at the end of the baking time--enough so that i'm certain if i did it in a 9x9 container as asked, it would still be runny in the middle.

that said...this was a delicious recipe and i'm positive i'll make it again with the following modifications:

brown sugar instead of white
add butterscotch chips/vanilla/something to give the apples just a bit more pizazz than just plain cinnamon
bake 50 minutes (with foil on top at the end so it doesn't burn on top) instead of 35 minutes.

My roommates loved this one! They keep trying to find recipes that can compare to it. Very moist - more like apple cake than brownies, and best eaten with a fork and some whipped cream.

I give it 4 stars for flavor. They are delicious!. I don't care at all for them once they have cooled. The flavor is still great but they are hard to eat. Have to put them in a dish and eat with a fork. they don't hold together very well. I think I will continue my search for the perfect apple dessert.

I give this 4 star for the original recipe but 5 with my mini changes. I didnt have walnuts; only had a mixed can of nuts & toasted them alittle before adding them to the batter. I also chopped the apples & beated it alittle so there were only small pieces of apple. Before I baked it I topped it w/ cinnamon strudel topping & had to bake for 45 mins.

Delicious!!  Took closer to 50 minutes for me.  I added 1/2 t nutmeg and a pinch of ground cloves.  Yum yum yum.

I'm also not really sure why they're called 'brownies' as they are far more like a moist apple cake, but I'm not a quibbler, and I didn't rate the recipe lower despite the misleading name.

I'm definitely planning on making these again.

Nice textured cake.  Wouldn't exactly call them a "brownie", but an excellent recipe none-the-less!  Thanks for sharing!

These were...eh. My sister loved them but I found them a little bland. They definitely are more cakey than brownie.  I'd recommend adding more cinnamon and definitely use only two green apples, not red. Also cooking them in muffin tins works a lot better and makes them come out better looking.

I wasnt sure how these would turn out since there was a lot more apple than dough, but it was delicious! Especially when still warm. I wouldnt describe this as a brownie, more like an apple version of banana bread. I added an extra egg and 1 T vanilla. I also made these in a muffin pan instead of a loaf for easier servings.

Delicious and easy recipe.  Took about 40 minutes to bake.  The texture was more like cake rather than brownie.  I was hoping for more of the brownie texture.

these were very tasty and extremely moist!  i also would not call them "brownies" - more of a cake in my opinion, but delicious nonetheless.  i used red delicious apples but would use granny smith next time as i think the tartness would be better to cut the sweet.  i doubled the recipe so i had to bake it for about and hour and 15 minutes (in a glass 9x13 baking dish) and it looked dark on the outside but came out perfect.  also, i didn't have nuts so i subbed in skor toffee bits and also topped it with them.  mmmmm.

SO good!  made this for the first time tonight, the only things i did differently were to add more apples and dice them into large chunks.  i also tossed them with cinnamon, sugar, and flour before mixing them into the batter and that kept them from sinking.  baked for about 50 minutes at 350.  really really good!  i love apple pie, but don't like store bought crust and am not very good at making my own, this is the perfect alternative.  thanks so much for sharing!!

We really liked this recipe!  I made only minor changes to make it a little bit healthier, as I was serving for an after school snack.  I made with whole wheat flour and I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup ( it was still plenty sweet for us).  Also, I used pecans instead of walnuts just because that is what we prefer. These were excellent.  I baked in a 8 X 11.5 glass dish  for about 30 mins and the consistency turned out just like brownies.  Two of my three kiddos loved them and so did my husband and I (my middle son is super picky!!!)  Thank you for the "keeper" :)

I made this recipe twice. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly (except put a little less sugar in) and put it into a cupcake pan. Baked around 35 minutes and was DELICIOUS. The second time, I substituted the butter with 1/2 cup of applesauce while cutting the sugar down. I baked it in a glass cake pan and it baked for around 50 minutes. The end result was not as flavorful, because the butter plays a significant role in the great flavor of this recipe. KEEP the butter and it will taste amazing!

What a tasty treat! I made a few tweaks of my own. I added vanilla like some others have suggested. I also sprinkled cinnamon on top before I stuck it in the oven. I used a 9x13 pan since I didn't have a 9x9 so the mixture was spread out more thinly. I let it bake for about 45-50 minutes. The texture came out more brownie-like in the fact that it didn't crumble in your hands, but the apple still made it moist. Wish I could give it more stars!

I would give this a 5 if it were actually a brownie.  This is definitely more like a cake. I made mine in an 8x8 pan and the cooking time was perfect.  I did make a few adjustments, subbed Strawberry Applesauce for the butter; I didn't use a full cup of sugar and will use even less next time, but I use sweet apples, Gala; I added twice the cinnamon, 2 tsp; no walnuts, a lil extra flour, 2 Tbs(roughly?), and added the apples last.  It turned out amazing and I will make this again for sure ... with my changes!  =D   Thanks for the recipe and the reviews to help me make a great treat!!  I might try a crumble topping next time since it is so close to a coffee cake!  Great warmed up with coffee for breakfast!

This is a fantastic recipe. My 6 year old helps me make them at least once a week. I gave some to a friend, and her teenage son said it was the best dessert he has ever had. The texture is not quite a brownie, but not an actual cake texture either. We do skip the nuts because my family doesn't like them. This is a staple for our family.

All I had was delicious apples and 1 Empire.  So that is what I used.  The flavor was very good though they were a little mushy for me.  Might be because I doubled the recipe and use d a larger pan.  Wish I had not put the cinnamon / sugar mix on the top as suggested by another.

The finished texture of this dessert is more cake-like than brownie.  That being said it was a good solid dessert.  I doubled it to fit a 13 x 9 pan, but I only used 1 1/2 cups sugar when doubled.  I ran out with 1/2 cup left of the all-purpose flour so I used wheat flour for the last 1/2 cup.  I used a variety of apples that we had just picked that afternoon.  I'm not a huge apple fan - but husband, son and parents thought these were wonderful hence the 5-star rating.  Thanks BakerJim for sharing - I'm sure these will be made again during apple season.

Delicious I followed the exact recipe Cut the apples into small pieces with 1/4 tsp vanilla and no walnuts and made it into muffins. The apples add so much flavor and moisture my family loved them. Great way to get the kids to eat apples will definitely make again

Very delicious!  I followed the recipe with the exception that my butter wasn't completely melted, I added a splash of French Apple Brandy that I had on hand from Thanksgiving.  Also added some extra cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves... yummy yummy and mine did seem to have a consistency of brownies, not sure why others didn't experience the same.

I loved the brownies/cake. I added some caramel sprinkle I have from pampered chef to the apples and let them sit before adding to mix and baking. I also made a powdered sugar frosting for the finished product! We absolutly loved them! Bake time was about 40 min. Thanks for the recipe Jim!

These were excellent. Just made a few changes. I made a batch and a half to put in a 9x13 pan. Used only 2 apples. Half of the butter called for (even for the batch and a half). I also did not melt the butter just softened it. Added a half cup of chocolate chips as others suggested. It was a little thick so I added a little bit of vegetable oil. I allowed them to set overnight and they turned out great! Gooey and very yummy. Took them to a potluck and they went over great!

I needed a recipe to use up some of the apples I got at the farm and I'm sooooo glad I decided to use this one. I didn't change anything and it was very easy to make. I especially liked how the ends and corner pieces were somewhat carmelized after baking

VERY good! Mine came out more like muffins but I think it's because I used self rising flour (all I had on hand). My husband who is very picky and not crazy about apples stated that this is probably his favorite dessert/muffin. So this will be going in my recipe box!! Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this recipe turned out delicious!  I loved the flavor of the apples (I chopped them up) and the cake got a crisp crust around the edges!  It did take longer than 35 minutes to bake, though.  I will make this again!

It is a simple and good recipe! I read the reviews while the pan was in the oven and was nervous that it turned out soggy or too sweet. I used an 8x8 round aluminum pan and kept it in the oven for about an hour and a half after inserting a toothpick several times. I crushed the apples because I don't like to feel the pieces of apple and still turned out good. Next time I'll probably use only 2 or 2and a half apples, although I really liked how it turned out! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

These were delicious.  I had to baked them for about 40 to 45 minutes longer.  I did check them after 35 minutes, but felt they needed more time. My family ate 1/2 of the pan after I had let them cool off.  Would be great with a scoop of ice cream.  They used cool whip.  A keeper!!  5 stars

These came out way too buttery! Otherwise the brownies were very moist and crumbly; great texture but the flavor was hardly of apple at all. I used an 8x8 pan and had to increase the bake time by 20 minutes.

I am so disappointed with this recipe.  Not at all what I expected even after reading the trouble other reviewers had. I followed the recipe exactly and mine were in the oven for an hour and were still under done. It turned out like a strange cobbler than anything else.  I won't be making this again.

My 12 year old daughter made these. She says 4 stars because the title led her to believe there would be chocolate involved, and because there isn't, they should be called  APPLE BLONDIES. I'm still chuckling over that one. Boy, was she miffed. But they are very moist and yummy as promised. Easy and quick to mix up. She chose to bake them as individual 'brownies', using a twelve cup muffin pan. Took about the same 35 minutes of bake time. I think these will be making a repeat appearance soon, despite no chocolate :D

Enjoying this so much as we speak!  Oh my gosh the sides are crispy the texture is perfect... One word, YUMMY.  Very easy, I followed one reviewers advice and just creamed the butter and sugar.  Now, I was short one apple, so I had to get creative and replaced that amount with sweet potato!  Perfect.  Also drizzled it with a powdered sugar glaze.  Wow!

Excellent buttery taste even when you substitute half butter and applesauce in place of the 1/2 c butter.  I diced the apples as others suggested.  This needed to bake just a little longer than the recipe states for me.  I also found that the sugar can be cut back to 3/4 c, and it still tastes great.  This has become a family favorite.

Very moist and delicious. Not quite a brownie though. These would be hard to eat with your hands unless the apples were chopped very small. More like a cake....these are screaming for a caramel/pinoche frosting. Will make again.

Great recipe.  I used granny smith apples and added a couple of tablespoons of cinnamon sugar to the apples before I dumped them in. I also sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on the top before baking.  I used room temperature butter instead of melted, and they turned out great.  Not beautiful by any means, but sooooo yummy.

These were loved by everyone at home, although I wasn't such a fan. And I've got to agree, these are more cake like than brownieish. I made a few mild changes - I used a little over 1/4 cup of butter (unmelted) and creamed it with the sugar. I made mini-cupcake-brownies with these and 1 cup sugar seemed a bit much. I cut back the sugar to a max of 1/4 cup. I also added in 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I took the advise of another reviewer and sprinkled some cinnamon butter over the mini-cupcakes before placing them in the oven. These took 35 minutes exactly to bake ... and made about 16 mini-cupcakes. Thanks for the recipe BakerJim!

AWESOME! but...I Frankenstein'd the recipe a little bit:

3 LARGE red/grainy apples
1/2 cup white sugar + 1/2 cup brown sugar
PECANS instead of walnuts

also:

I used small rectangular muffin boxes & lowered the baking time to 30 minutes.

After reading the reviews and following several suggestions made by reviews I would like to make some recommendations regarding this recipe. 

 First, melt the butter when combining with the sugar, as stated in the recipe. This makes for a moist base when adding the flour mixture and easier to combine later on in the recipe and to spread in the pan.  

I added 3 cups of cubed apples rather than the 3 medium sliced apples, this more evenly dispersed the apples and helped in the rising of the cake.  

The addition of 1 teaspoon vanilla extract enhanced the flavor, as did the addition of topping consisting of 3 Tablespoons unsalted butter, 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, combined and dropped over the top of the cake prior to baking.  This also added a crunchy topping and richness. 

 Finally, the recipe's listed time of 35 minutes is not correct, I found a baking time of between 50-55 minutes to be more accurate. Allow to cool to warm before serving.  

This "brownie" was extremely popular and I needed to make it 3 times the first week.

Excellent- I used old apples, not fresh ones.  I believe this helped keep it from being too moist. I also diced them instead of slices. And added 1/2 tsp allspice.  It did take almost an hour, and they are more bread-like than brownies- but great!

I have made these many times, always as muffins. They take ca 25 min to bake. Do not underbake, they remain very gooey even when baked until quite dark golden brown. You must use paper to line the muffin tray as the brownies themselves served this way are not very attractive (hence only 4 stars) - but the taste and texture is phenomenal.

I made the batter and added the apples (which I chopped) at the end, baked in a cupcake tin, and they were incredibly moist and delicious!  Not so much like a brownie (or blondie, which is why I give it a 4*) but still very good, I will def make these again!

These are in NO WAY brownies... more like cake.  They were good, but I already have an Apple Cake recipe at home, so this was a bit disappointing.  I did follow the recipe tho' I was not sure how to make the butter/sugar/egg mixture "fluffy" if the butter was melted.    I also tried to make the mini muffins as shown.  Altho' I greased the pan, they are completely stuck in there.  Maybe because they are more cake-like, I needed to butter & FLOUR the pan

For a 9x13 pan I doubled everything EXCEPT the apples. Used pecans instead of walnuts. Then added 1t nutmeg and 2t Mexican vanilla. As soon as it came out of the oven, I sprinkled about 1/4 Cup cinnamon sugar on the top. FABULOUS and EASY recipe!!

Here's my changes:  soften, rather than melt butter and add 1 t. vanilla.  Dice rather than slice apples.  Add apples and 1/2 c. chocolate chips after mixing in dry ingredients.  Spread mixture into pan.  Press in 1/4 cup walnuts on half so kids can have nut-free version.

Made this last night late and followed recipe but added another reviewers topping of brown sugar, butter and chopped nuts (pecans) before baking. I had lots of apples so chopped them up in smaller cubes and used as many as I could get into the batter. This was left to cool overnight and brought into work today-OUTSTANDING! Do they actually taste or are the consistency of a brownie? no, more like a coffee cake to me,but very moist. Everyone has rated it 5 stars. I will make this again. Thanks.

I read the other reviews and took advice from there regarding chopping the apples and adding some other spices; I also doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan. I added nutmeg and about 1/2-3/4 c raisins as we didn't have any walnuts.  It certainly is more like a cake than a brownie in texture and is super moist; it needs a plate and utensil to eat.  Baking time for me was 40-45 mins, which was perfect. My husband gave it a thumbs up and liked finding plump raisins in it as well. A nice different way to use apples.

Funny, I received this SAME recipe from my college roommate's grandmother! She used to send her down from New Hampshire with boxes of these bars, and we would polish them off in one sitting.  Now that I'm older, I replace half of the flour with whole-wheat pastry flour and half of the sugar with brown sugar.  It still tastes great, but I feel a little less guilty about demolishing them...

Not bad, not wonderful but certainly not horrible. I think using three apples was a little much for my tastes, especially considering mine ranged on the small cider. They were also EXTREMELY moist, almost to the point of being soggy. I'd use a little less butter, and a little more flour next time.

Love this recipe!  I would call it a blondie rather than a brownie but it's so delcious, who cares what it's called!  I toasted the walnuts, decreased the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon and added 1/2 teaspoon each of nutmeg and allspice.  This recipe is easily doubled for a 9x13 baking dish.  Several times I have made this recipe times four.  Cut into squares and wrapped well, this freezes exceptionally well.

I used Fuji apples and the only modification I made was 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar instead of the whole cup of white sugar. The outcome was okay, fell apart when hot but hold together when cold. It as too sweet for me so next time I will only use 1/2 cup brown sugar. My husband liked it alot warm with icecream on top. Will probably bake this every other month.

It had a really good flavor, but it ended up kind of like bread pudding.  I guess it just needs way more time in the oven.  I added some caramel drizzle over top and it was good.

Had some troubles but made some edits: used 1/4 cup Earth Balance and 1/4 cup applesauce; cut the sugar to 1/2 cup; replaced walnuts with oatmeal (great idea!); 1/2 cup AP flour and 1/2 cup WW flour; baked as muffins. I used three apples chopped but I think it was too much apple. As muffins, they were extremely chunky and not very bready - and I even added about another 1/4 cup of flour when I saw how moist the batter was. I liked the flavor and the idea though, so I want to try them again.

These truly are delicious! I made them in muffin tins like CC's photo, they were a bit hard to get out since they didn't want to stay together.  Next time I think I'll try them in a mini-muffin tin.  I wish they were easier to handle, like a pick-up and eat treat- they're a little too soft and fall-apart.  But other than that they re great.  I just warmed one up with some yogurt mixed with honey drizzled over top.  YUM!

I found tese to be delicious as well. Not exactly brownies but along those lines. I messed around with the recipe myself. My changes involved doubling the batch, adding only 3/4 of the total sweetener and I used a combination of white and brown sugars with about 1/2 C of Splenda. I also added 2 more apples which I sliced on the side of a grater. I also added nutmeg and more baking soda and powder than was called for. The result was sensational served warm with ice cream. I had mine as bars sans the ice cream. They were a bit tender but held their shape better than expected. In that way they were like brownies. They are very buttery and I like that!

I first made this for a garage sale with proceeds going to WRT. It went over so well. Now I finally made it for myself & know why everyone was going so crazy over it. I used smart balance instead of butter. I used half brown sugar. I used aluminum-free baking powder & unbleached four w/half w.w.. Then apple-pie spice instead of cinnamon. Both times I made it though it did require longer baking time so I put aluminum foil all over it a & baked it for another 10-30mins. Thank-you for the recipe!

This is a really good apple recipe. I doubled and baked in 9x13 pan. I also creamed the butter and added 1 tsp vanilla. I used 5 Granny smith and chopped them. I was in doubt when the batter turned out very stiff, mostly apples, but boy! it turned out one of the best apple desserts I've had. Even my picky eater husband raved about it.  Don't be alarmed by the amount of apples. You need that amount to make the wonderful apple flavor and texture in the brownies. Wonderful!

Followed the recipe as far as spice and ingredient amounts (I used Fuji apples), but I gave the apples a quick rough chop after slicing.  Wonderful balanced flavor and very tender.  I didn't have  a 9x9 so used an 8x8 and I think the smaller pan made the brownies a little too "moist" but the taste was fab! I will make this again--after I buy the appropriate pan size.

I made this in double with granny smith and red delicious apples. It did take a quite a long time to bake, but it turned out to be a surprise hit at a family party. I also sprinkled heath bits on top. Much more like sponge cake than brownies, but overall tasty and not-too-sweet.

These were just alright.  Nothing more than a really moist apple cake.  Fell apart trying to take out of the pan.  Ended up spooning them on saucers.

This excellent recipe should be renamed to Apple Cake as the texture had no resemblance to that of a brownie.  Outside of that this was a very tasty dessert, my husband sat down with the pan and didn't get up until half of the pan was empty.  I omitted the walnuts and was very happy with the results.

I put in half the amount of recommended sugar, I also used pecans instead of walnuts. Everyone who tried it thought it was amazingly good. Thank you to the poster who advised to not be concerned if the batter seemed think and mostly apples, I found that reassuring.

Not a brownie dessert, but absolutely delicious! Like NLB suggested, I added a tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the recipe, as well as adding a cinnamon sugar topping (1/3 c brown sugar, 3 T butter, 1/2 tsp cinnamon). I'm not a huge fan of nuts in this kind of thing, so I omitted them. Also, since I like it a little more apple-y, I used 4 apples instead of 3. I baked it for about 40-45 min and served it hot with vanilla ice cream. If you love apple desserts, you have to try this!

I used standard size muffin tins and baked for 25 minutes.  They come out soft and moist, almost (but not quite) oily.  Feel free to half the sugar; you won't miss it.

Absolutely delicious!!!  I did substitute to make it WW friendly, using ICBNB - light, splenda, eggbeaters, and 1/8 cup walnuts broken into small pieces.  I also added 1 tsp. vanilla.  Even with all the low-fat subs and making them in a muffin tin, they were a complete hit!  A little whipped cream and you have a very satisfying dessert!

Not a brownie in any way, shape, or form! I was really hoping for the texture of a brownie with the taste of an apple and this recipe let me down. The cooking time is way off as well. They were alright, but I won't be making them again.

I had to give this a 4, only because I find that 1 tsp. of cinnamon is overbearing.  I did use others advice and did not melt the butter.  I made 2 batches, one with 1 tsp. of cinnamon and one with 1/2 tsp.  Everyone enjoyed the one with 1/2 tsp. better.  Other than that, they were a hit.  I also made them in muffin pans and 25 mins. was spot on.

The first time I made these they ended up as a pile of delicious crumbs. Do not use "The Perfect Brownie" pan with this recipe.
So recovering from that mess, I tried again. I used Granny Smith apples - grated in the food processor. Granny Smiths have a lot of moisture in them, so I added an extra 1/2 cup flour to get a good consistency (and some extra cinnamon and baking powder - but the baking powder was a mistake that ended up being fortunate). They are delicious and hold together.
I'm using these as part of the refreshments for a party with 60-70 people, so I used mini muffin tins and baked them for 12-15 minutes. I doubled the recipe and got about 7 dozen little round apple brownies.

I followed one reviewer's advice and creamed sugar and margarine, then added egg, some vanilla. Mixed the dry ingredients separately and added to wet. Then added nuts and apples. In all, it took about 75 minutes to bake through in my oven. Worth it in the end though, as they are very moist and made my too-sour apples taste delicious! Would half the cinnamon next time.

This is very similar to the apple pike recipe but I like this one a lot better. It smelled better while it was baking, looked better when it came out of the over, and I didnt have to make any adjustments to get it right, it followed the recipe exactly. Very happy!

I always make a recipe exactly as it stands the first go 'round, and this one sure didn't turn out like expected. As is, the taste is absolutely excellent. It took me about 45 minutes to bake, and even then I had an overly-moist apple cake that had to be eaten in a bowl - definitely not a "brownie" or "blondie". It seems there are *way* too many apples in this (I used 3 medium Granny Smiths) - next time I'll double everything else or half the apples. There's not enough batter to hold it all together!

The consistency is more along the lines of an incredibly moist cake.  Nonetheless, !  These are awesome!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe except I didn't melt the butter and didn't add any walnuts.  These are amazingly scrumptious and I'm glad they're tucked away in my recipe box for me to use whenever!

This recipe is delicious!  My husband & I loved it!  I think it baked for about 45 min and the toothpick was dry, however as it cooled the apples made the 'brownie' part runny.  It was very good, but we almost had to use a spoon.  I might try adding a bit more flour next time.

This had really good flavor, and was easily modified to be healthier without losing any good taste.  As has been said by many reviewers though, this is much more an apple cake than a brownie.  Still delicious, and I love the fact that you can swap out white flour for whole wheat, sub applesauce for butter, cut the sugar, and make endless healthy changes and still come up with a sweet treat that the kids will gobble down!

I LOVE this recipe, I made a couple changes: I doubled it to use a 9x13 pan, I only used half the sugar and used raw sugar, I used half applesauce and half butter, added a tsp of vanilla, and only used half the apples and I diced them.  It still took 35 min to bake and it is amazing!!

I doubled the recipe based on other reviews but changed it up a little to make these healthier.  I used 1 cup of trans fat free shortening, 1/2 cup sugar & 1 cup granulated Splenda - came out just fine.  Baked for 45 min.  Very good!  Thanks!

These are so good!! I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and I omitted the walnuts. I cut my apples into cubes and left the skin on. Don't bake the apple brownies longer than 35 minutes! These will not taste good if you over bake them. I will be making these again soon. I think next time I might add cranberries.

These were OK. Nothing exceptional. Definitely need to double the recipe or else the "brownies" are very very thin.

These had a great flavor. I think the baking time needs to be a bit longer though. They came out pretty soft and cake like. Definitely nothing like a brownie.

Good. I made a couple small changes. I used half white and half brown sugar and added a little nutmeg and cloves. I also added a topping of oatmeal, butter, and cinnamon. My boyfriend said next time I should add raisins too.

I actually liked this one. I made a 1 1/2 batch to fit my 9x13 pan. I substituted 2/3 of the butter with some homemade apple butter I had on hand & used an extra large egg for my measurement. It tasted great! Mine's pretty sweet but very tasty. I cut my apples into 8 sections and then sliced each section. The pieces were the perfect size and it was done in 35-45 minutes like the recipe. This is a great base recipe!

I used room temperature butter and creamed it with the sugar before proceeding with the rest.  I also added a 2nd egg to help bind it together better.  It is a delicious recipe though, I think it just needs a few tweaks to help it hold it's shape a bit!

I have introduced my son to this old favorite recipe from the 1970's. As an adult with autism, he loves every stage of preparation, from choosing apples to peeling with the crank peeler, coring and chopping with his handy chopper thingie. His friends all love this decadent treat. I agree, it's closer to an hour for the cook time.

OMG!! These are wonderful! So full of apples, but bakes up perfect. I did use the suggested topping of 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 3 tb butter. Baked 45 minutes.

delicious. i doubled recipe to put in 9 x 13 pan, diced 2 granny and 1 fuji (4c apples), and added 1 t vanilla. very apple-filled, hard to cut/serve. might try cutting back on sugar by 25% and subbing half of butter with applesauce.

Very Tasty! Except ... it's not so much a brownie as it is a cake, which is why I rate so low. If it was called something different I think I would have different expectations and that would likely result in a much higher rating because in terms of a cake, it's pretty tasty!

Moist, sweet but not too sweet, and super yummy!  I don't know that I'd call this a brownie/blondie, it was more like a quick bread or cake.  Regardless, it was delish!  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty but for us at altitude I think this recipe needs some modifications. I didn't have a 9x9 pan so I used a muffin tin and the 'brownies' don't hold their shape at all. Next time I'll try less sugar, less butter and more flour. If using a muffin tin you don't need 35 minutes, more like 25.

I followed the recipe to a T - except I doubled it and filled 24 cupcake tins hoping they would be easier to remove without falling apart - But I too had trouble removing them in one piece from the greased tins. The taste was AWESOME! Great Recipe! Thank You!

It was my turn to send a snack,  and I needed something quick and easy.  These were a huge hit with the kids. They are more like a cake than brownie, but they don't crumble all over like another reviewer complained.  Mine took exactly 35 minutes. I used the  food processor to slice the apples. I also recommend sprinkling with cinnamon and sugar when complete. Thanks for a delicious snack recipe.

Baked in an 8x8 pan for 60 minutes.  Letting them cool down now.  Have yet to try them.  I am going to serve it warm with vanilla bean ice cream.   Will let you know what they thought of the flavor and texture.  thanks for sharing.

Excellent.  I left out the nuts, added vanilla and added a crumb topping.  So moist, such flavor, I should have doubled the recipe!

These were delicious!! Don't be afraid if when you are mixing it looks as though you have way too many apples and too little batter. It is supposed to look like this and will turn out great once you let the cake do its thing in the oven!

I make an apple cake that is very similar. The only real difference is this recipe calls for butter instead of oil. The butter makes it way more dense..like a brownie, not a cake (go figure). It was a very tasty recipe and I liked it a lot.

I doubled the recipe, only put in 1 1/2 cups of sliced Gala apples, added 1 cup of Nestle Premiere White Chips, put in a 9x13 pan, and baked for 40 minutes. Do not use apples with alot of juice in them, because during baking it will rise and over flow the pan. That  was my first try. Now I have it perfected. It was great. Everyone asks for the recipe!

I made this for my wife tonight 10/20/09 and she loved it,so did my  daughter and I. Added 1tsp vanilla and doubled the cinnamon,baked 350 for 40 minutes. When I removed it from the oven I dusted the top with cinnamon sugar.I used 3 freshly picked apples from NC 2-golden delicious and 1 red delicious. My wife wants me to add more apples next time. This is a great brownie/cake. It did fall apart.......but who cares!!!!!It is delicious...

I thought this recipe was good. It tastes just like apple cake to me. The only thing I don't like is that it falls apart when you try to take a piece out of the pan. I may have used bigger apples than I should have and ended up with too much. ? But otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it's good.

The flavor was really exceptional, but they just fell apart.  I can't figure out what I did wrong.  I just disguised them under some vanilla ice cream when serrving.  I would love to make again if anyone has any tips on how to make the ingredients gel together better.  I used diced granny smith apples and topped the batter with cinnamon sugar before baking.

Holy apple goodness...I made these at my husbands request as I do not like cooked apples..the only thing I changed was I doubled the recipe and subbed half applesauce and half butter, I just had one and even though I dont care for cooked apples, this had to be the best apple tasting cake ever...next time I will not beat the eggs as another reviewer suggested to make them more brownie like..

These are really moist and tasty. Didn't stay together as I thought they would but, hey, who cares? Good enough to overlook that and it may have been that I added a bit more apple. Will definitely make again (and again).

Great..My little girl loved it. Very moist but i would suggest that to reduce the sugar amount to 3/4 cups. 1 cup is abit too sweet cuz the apples have its own sweetness too. Thanks for sharing this.

These little apple bites were very good.  I modified just a wee bit to suit our tastes by using 1/2 cup all purpose flour plus 1/2 cup minus 2 TBSP of whole grain flour.  I also substituted 3/4 cup of packed brown sugar for the 1 cup white sugar.  It was still plenty sweet, so I am going to cut the sugar to 1/2 cup packed brown sugar next time I bake these.  I used 2 granny smith apples plus 1 cortland, diced, and I omitted the walnuts.  These were modifications to suit our tastes, and we were very happy with the results.  They came out very moist and delicious. One last note, I baked these in an 8x8 pan in a 350F oven for 45 minutes.  They came out perfectly!

Very good. Not exactly sure why it is called a brownie because the texture was like cake. Baked it for 40 minutes, 3/4 cup of sugar, and used a granny smith and a golden delicious apple.

These were sooooo good. I kept eating them and there wasn't any left because my dad loved them too. I saw that there wasn't any extract in there, so I added 1 teaspoon of Maple flavoring and they were amazing. I don't know what they taste like without that, but next time I make them I'm adding the maple again, which was a great combo with the apples!

I made a few changes, and it was a big hit:

I did use applesauce instead of butter.  I diced 2 apples instead of slicing 3 (I think people complained of it being too moist because the extra apple adds a lot of water).  1/4 of the flour I used was whole-grain.  I only used 3/4 cup sugar.  I added some nutmeg (1/2 tbsp is great).

35 minutes in the oven was fine, and I let it cool uncovered so the steam came out.  Everyone loved it, but they insisted on calling it "Apple Cake" because it has no chocolate, despite a lookup in the dictionary. I am glad that the no-fat, lower-sugar version was so tasty, and I'll make this many times.

These were a hit at a gathering with friends.  I also doubled the receipe to make a 9x13 pan.  I also just added the 1/2c of butter.  Did not doulbed the butter and they were just as moist.  It did take them about an hour to bake and were just a little difficult to cut out.  They are so moist that they fall apart some. I will make these again.  Thanks for sharing:)

These were so moist and delicious. I omitted the walnuts and diced the apples. Rather than butter I used Olivio, a little less than 1/2 a cup. Next time I will probably cut back on the sugar a little, these are very sweet. While I was chopping the apples, 3 seemed like way too much but I added it all anyway and I am glad I did.

These were so yummy and really easy to make.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and diced my apples.  Dicing them means you get a bit of apple in every bite.

Super yum!!  I thought it was a bit more cake-like than brownie, but when it tastes this good, who really cares?  Thanks for the recipe.  It is a keeper.

These were very good!  I used white whole wheat flour, brown sugar, and chopped apples.  Mine began to get very brown, and I remembered that my oven cooks hot, and turned it down a bit.

Mine cooked fine in 35 minutes.  I took suggestions from others and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top after cooking.  Easy to make and very yummy!

Taste was pretty good, but they were very soggy.  Too many apples maybe?  It was also more like a cake than a brownie.  Probably won't make it again, but maybe add more flour?

I also would not categorize this as "brownies."  It is definitely more of a cake...very moist.  Tastes great and is easy to make.

I have made 2 changes. I use 1/2 Cup Unsweetened Applesauce instead of the butter and I add 1/2 Cup Oats.
Also, I do very the amount of Sugar I use based on the type of apples I'm using. Awesome completely guilt free treat !

I made this as  per original recipe (except chopped apples w/skin on and 2 eggs) and with whole wheat pastry flour and coconut sugar (also with chopped skin on apples & 2 eggs) to be a bit healthier and both were FANtastic! This is an awesome, quick and easy, and delicious recipe that brought me compliments on both. This one just made my top ten of treats and will be making this one often! Thanks for the recipe!

I always try to follow the ingredients to the letter. However I had to substitute pecans because I ran out of walnuts. Also it could be mistaken for a cake, but the easy of making it and the favor is worth it.

I made this to eat in the mornings.  So I cut the servings to 6 and I used raisins instead of walnuts.  I also used half brown sugar and half Truvia ( a sugar substitute) with a dash of vanilla. It turned out great!  U could smell it all in my house.  And the taste was simply wonderful!

I added a bit of vanilla and a half teaspoon of nutmeg and they were amazing! It is really more of cake/bread than a brownie but it is still very moist and had a great flavor.

I used 4 small kids size snack apples for this but it was still far too much apple not enough batter. Smells great but a little bland on the flavour.

I made this and it was really awesome; especially still warm with some caramel ice cream on top!

With that said, this was more like a bread pudding than a brownie.  This is no problem; I love bread pudding, but if I were looking to bring this as a finger food somewhere, this doesn’t fit that bill.  I omitted the nuts due to an allergy; maybe that has something to do with it.  I did dice the apples; will try this with two next tine and see what happens.

this recipe made 12 reg sized muffins.  I don't know how easy it would be to cut these from a brownie pan because they were light and fluffy and didn't stay together too well once the paper was off the muffin.   That said, they were delicious despite falling apart.   I added vanilla and diced the apples.  very yummy! 
thanks for sharing

There are so many better options for apple cake. These were too soft owing to the large-ish proportion of fat to flour.  Won’t make again.

I really liked this recipe and my family really enjoyed the brownies. But  I didn’t add the walnuts because of the fact that I didn’t have any in my house at that time. The brownies still tasted really good but I’m sure they definitely would have tasted better if there had been walnuts in the brownies.

Delicious. I used oil instead of butter,  brown sugar instead of white because we love the flavour. And I used tinned pie apple, which is softer than sliced.  I mashed the apple and added a little more flour and cooked as individual muffin size for 20 mins. The cooked texture was like a steamed pudding.  Will look great on the plate with a sprinkle of icing sugar and dollop of home made ice cream. Yum.

These brownies are delicious.  One review I read  said that these didn't have a brownie consistency, and that she couldn't bring them to a function because they were too moist.  That's a crock.  These come out just like a brownie and cut like a brownie!  If you follow the directions without all the changes I see, they are amazing!

I loved this and will definitely make it again! I made it for some of the girls in my sorority a few weeks ago and everyone devoured it. Definitely would call it an apple cake instead of apple brownies but I'm not worried about it. Something I'm going to try next time is adding some nutmeg! I also sprinked powdered sugar over the whole thing when it was done and that was a very good move.

I was so wanting to make cookies tonight, w/apples.  Never made 'em like that before but it just sounded so good to me.  I have a cpl of recipes on another site but I was missing too many or the wrong ingred's, so I decided to do some searching. Because of the season, I also added ground clove & allspice.
I just took it out of the oven a lil' bit ago.  But I was so anxious to try it that I didn't even wait for it to cool.  Very moist & a nice little crunchy top.
Unfortunately it wasn't ready to eat 'til after the fam went to bed, can't wait for them to try it!

I creamed the butter with the sugar without melting it first, and added nutmeg. This came out well. Yum!

I followed the recipe to a “T” barring a bit of guess work on the amount of apple, as I had a bunch of small gala apples and I wanted them gone! I did triple the recipe to use up all my apples, but I didn’t change a thing! Every pan was moist and delicious! My husband went back for thirds before I cut him off! Lol

I added some nutmeg to make it taste a bit more ‘apple pie’. It was a hit!! Great and super easy recipe.

I made these wonderful apple brownies today. The only thing I changed was I diced the apples and added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg , everything else I kept the same. Oh, I did make them in a cake pan because I left my other pan at a friends house. All I can say is Please make them as written, you won’t be disappointed.

These are delicious - almost more like an apple crumble dessert. I’m glad I read reviews that suggested less apple. I will make this again for a taste of fall... and serve with some vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce!

Followed a couple of other reviewer's suggestions about creaming the sugar and softened butter (did not melt) together and I think it turned out pretty well. I would definitely make it again.

This came out amazing. I used home made apple sauce to make it instead and left out a 1/4 cup of sugar because the apple sauce had liquid in it. So delicious, soft and gooey.

I made this for a church function and got lots of compliments! It’s was very moist and tasty. The only change I made was I cut the apples into cubes. I will certainly make this again.  Next time I’d like the serve it with vanilla ice cream and a caramel sauce!

This is a favorite in our house.  I toss the walnuts in the chopper so they are extra fine.  Be sure to core and slice the apples thin.  This is a winner!  More like an apple cake than a brownie.  Perfect autumn Saturday morning breakfast!

I am not sure if I would consider these brownies. The flavors were good, however, mine fell apart. They were very very very moist. The kids ate them because they will eat anything sweet but I was embarrassed bringing these to a sick family member. I would make these again but maybe try cutting the amount of apples in half.

Very good.  I had two apples which I chopped small for the recipe. As suggested by others I added some additional spices: tsp. vanilla, 2 tsp. cinnamon, a dash of clove powder, some nutmeg, and 1/4 c. cranberries. I didn't want to do just white sugar so I reduced it to 1/4 c. and added 1/4 c. Brown sugar and 1/4 c maple syrup.  I also, as suggested,made a cinnamon crumble to put on top. I used whole wheat flour instead of regular white flour. The recipe has a great sweet apple /cinnamon flavor and the tart addition of the dried cranberries gives a good balance to the sweet.  Out of the oven it is very crumbly but after a a couple of hours it firms up.  It does have a cake like consistency n didn't feel brownie like. But it tastes great and the recipe is easily adjusted to taste. I'll definitely be making this again.

LOVE IT!! I made this to bring to work and it was a huge hit! Tasted amazing. Only changes I did was i did half a cup of white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar instead of just the white. I kept everything else the same but I baked it in an 8x8 dish and it turned out perfect. Highly recommend.

I used applesauce instead of butter (sweetened, so I cut sugar in half).  Added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Flour was 50/50 white/whole wheat.  It was pretty good.

So easy and quick to make! Second time making it. This time I did it with whole wheat flour and chopped the apples smaller and added chocolate chips. Still came out perfect. Can't go wrong with this recipe.

We found these to be enjoyable, but not memorable.  Somewhere between a bar and a brownie, but not really either.  I was hoping for more chew and less crumble and a lot more flavor.

Will definitely make these again. I doubled the recipe and baked in a 11" X 15" pan. used only 1 1/2 cups of granulated sugar, And upped the walnuts to 1 1/2 cups. Also used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Went with half butter and half applesauce. Added a brown sugar and granulated sugar crumble on top. baked for 30 min and then broiled for 3 min to crisp the top. Best thing  I've ever baked. Delicious!!

Delicious!  I followed the directions as written.  I used Granny Smith apples.  Once the dish is completely cooled, pieces are easily picked-up and handled like brownies.  Of course, the texture is nothing like brownies but we weren't disappointed.  It was fabulous and will definitely make it again.

I recently made this for a party and everyone loved it! It's simple and easy!!! I added a teaspoon of vanilla and after it came out of the oven, I sprinkled some brown sugar and cinnamon over the top. I also left out and kind of it's, due to some people being allergic. I'll definitely be making this again, although next time I may double the recipe cause the bars were a bit tiny. Thanks for sharing this yummy-easy recipe!!!

For starters, I wish I had chopped the apples rather than following the original recipe and slicing them, perhaps creating a more brownie-like consistency.  Mine was more like an apple cake.  Having said that, they tasted really good!!!   I would prefer more chewy!

These taste delicious!  However, I found them a little dry.  Cooked only for 35 min.  Makes me wonder why so many others had to cook it so long.  I added only half the sugar.  Next time I will cut up the apple more.  I had left them in half inch chunks.

This cake was really good. I made the following modifications: chopped apples (Granny Smith) into small squares, added 1 t vanilla, and created a topping of 3 T butter, 1/3 c brown sugar, 1 t cinnamon, and 1/3 c oats. I served it warm with salted caramel ice cream. Will make again but cut down on sugar. It was really sweet.

Delicious. More like a cake than a brownie. Super moist and yummy. I like to shred half the apples and thinly slice the rest with my food processor. Makes nice muffins too if you make it in cupcake liners in a cupcake pan. I've made it with walnuts and without. Both are great, but I think I prefer without.

It was so moist! I had to control myself not to finish it before the potluck... I creamed the butter and sugar as suggested by others. As I was doing it by hand, it only started looking puffy and cream like after I added the egg though. I also mixed cinnamon, brown sugar, and butter and spread it on top of the batter. The finished cake had a crisp top, and it was so delicious!

Too much apple in this recipe made the squares too soft and moist. Difficult to cut and serve, although it tastes good. If I ever make this again, I will use only one apple.

really good flavor, alittle sweet but not overly.  it was super moist to point of soggy - so have to let it set overnight; and bit greasy- so next time, I will use half butter & half applesauce.
I doubled the recipe, but not the apples.

If you've got three apples and this recipe, you are in luck.  Don't change a thing, it's perfect as written.  It's quick, easy, and delicious.

Awesome recipe!  Can't go wrong. All of the variations seem to work out great. I browned the butter (always do) used whole wheat flour, and organic raw sugar. Used a mini muffin pan.  One recipe made 24 mini muffins plus two small heart pans.  My family can't stop eating them. This is a gem of a recipe during apple season!

This recipe (with a couple small adjustments) is so, SO delicious! I took it to a fall party and everyone went nuts over it! Because a common complaint in reviews I read was that they were soggy and not brownie-like,  I cut back on the amount of apple and softened the butter instead of melting. I doubled the recipe, but only used 3 medium sized Granny Smith apples.  I creamed the butter with the sugar before adding the egg, I diced the apples instead of slicing, added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and added the apples and walnuts LAST to the batter. This doubled recipe (in a 9 x 13), took about 50 minutes to cook. The toothpick still came out wet when done, but this is because it's a rather moist brownie/cake. Just make sure the toothpick doesn't come out with batter on it. About 10 min into baking, I pulled the pan out and sprinkled the top with a generous amount of cinnamon and sugar. These came out easy to cut, moist and super flavorful, with a lovely crisp top. One of my favorite fall recipes yet!

Wow!  Yummy stuff!  I took some advice from the other bakers and put a bit of vanilla extract in it and sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar before putting it in the oven for an hour instead of 35 min.  

For my own personal touch, I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and put in a quarter cup of white chocolate chips and it came out delicious!!  

I will make this again.  Although, next time, I will put 2 small apples diced instead of 3 to make room for the white chocolate.  My next batch may have to be tomorrow!

Thank you Baker Jim and mom!

I will make this again. I made as directed, other than subbing pecans instead of walnuts(that's what I had). They were slightly cake like, probably because of the baking powder.  So they were light not chewy.  My preference!!  I minced the apples instead of slicing.

Made these today after our apple picking outing.    We usually cook apples in a crisp so decided to try something different for a change.    I followed this recipe exactly except as suggested by some reviewers, I diced the apples instead of slicing them.    We loved these they came out amazing.   This is a recipe that I will keep and use again.   I have however renamed them "apple cake" rather than brownies as they are more cake like.    Next time I am going to poke holes in it once cooked and drizzle caramel  sundae topping on top.    We did try them with caramel sauce and they were even better that way!

It was good. Tastes like other apple cakes I made. I was expecting a more dense, brownie-like texture and it wasn't there.

It's possible I doubled this recipe when I made it--it just came up on Facebook as a memory.  However, after reading a few reviews, I want to give a shout out for MELTING the butter rather than creaming.  In my experience, the difference that melting does is lend chewiness to a baked product rather than making something fluffy.  I want these to be like brownies and that to me means chewy. I don't think you achieve the best chewiness unless you melt the butter (or use a flavorless oil, like safflower).

Delicious, delicious and super delicious! Great recepies. Although 35 minutes cooking time wasn't enough time so I kept them 15 minutes longer in the oven. I think the apples I used wee a bit soft. The flavor is so great.  I had one with cold milk and another with hot coffee. Great flavor. My husband too them for lunch. He loved them. :)

We loved it!  Very delicious and moist.  The roughly chopped walnuts give a little crunch to it.  Definitely will make it again.  
I doubled the amount and used a 9x13 pan.
Also had some modifications.  For the double amount used 3/4 cups of butter and I creamed the eggs and 1cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar in it.  Next time I will use brown sugar entirely.  I mixed the dry ingredients, used 1 cup all purpose and 1 cup white whole wheat.

I've made these several times and everyone loves them.   I use a 12 muffin pan instead of a 9x9 pan, just for the sole purpose of easier transport because I love grabbing these on the go.  In the muffin pan they get a nice crispy caramelized edge and are soft and moist in the middle. They are great with vanilla ice cream also!

Altered the recipe a bit after reading the reviews. Substituted the white sugar for brown sugar (1cup) and added 1/4 cup of white sugar. Also added 1/2 tsp nutmeg powder and 1 tsp vanilla. Did not melt the butter but beat it with the sugar and egg when at room temperature. Kept the apple slices chunky than thin. After baking for 30min, I added a mix of melted butter with brown sugar and cinnamon on top, then continued to bake for another half hour. Superb recipe, my parents who were visiting were very impressed with it!! Have made it twice already and will definitely make it again!

I soaked the apples in a Alaskan pie spice mix for 4 hours. Then made the rest of he recipe just like this one but didn't add (more) cinnamon. It was the best apple dish I've ever made. I planned on making apple pie but didn't have the right ingredients. Yay for Allrecipes!

I substituted chocolate flakes for the nuts, but otherwise followed the recipe completely. It took a little time to set, but lovely taste and the texture sorted itself out after a night in the fridge.

The recipie is simple and easy to follow. I shredded the apples, used 3 eggs and half a cup of sugar. I also used a cupcake pan, the brownie came out so moist with tangy apple flavor. My family loves it!

This was good. Sweeter than expected. I thought about substituting brown sugar for the the white but am glad I didn't. This is definitely a blondie, not a cake. Made as stated except creamed the sugar and butter together rather than melting the butter and only used two apples since that's all I had. Also cubed the apples and added 1 tsp. vanilla.  My only complaint is that it's a bit moist and doesn't keep the form when cut. I ended up spooning it into a bowl.  Kids enjoyed making and eating this with me though :)

Moist, lovely flavor which reminds me of "Jewish apple cake" but more moist and easier to make. I skipped topping as batter was sweet enough for us. I normally don't add nuts, but was glad I followed recipe. It made a difference in the flavor. A keeper!

I make these whenever I have apples that are too bruised to eat. I double the recipe and bake it instead in a 9x13 dish for 45 minutes. Quick, easy, DELICIOUS!!

These brownies were deliciously moist and full of flavor.  The only change I made was I used 2 apples instead of 3, but I felt that was more than enough apples.  I tried this with my students and they loved them.  Definitely will make this one again!!!

I made this several times now and I love it! I substituted once the cup of sugar with half cup of stevia and it still came out great! It is fast to make and perfect for fall. Thank you!

I like this recipe because it's simple and we had all ingredients on-hand.  I agree with the person that said it is more like a cake because it is but it's still delicious. This would also make a great coffee cake recipe.

These were pretty dang delicious. Made a couple of minor changes-creamed the butter, added a splash of vanilla and some nutmeg. Doubled the recipe to bake in a 13x9. Will definitely make again.

I must confess, I used 1/2 butter 1/2 fat free yogurt and 1/2 sugar 1/2 Splenda with 2 egg whites instead of a whole egg. It was amazing! Light fluffy and full of flavor. I also used 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon since my hubby loves cinnamon. With this version the whole thing was 1800 calories with 1/12th only 150 (healthy) calories. I will tuck this one away to use again!

Delicious! Followed the recipe almost to the letter, just added a little nutmeg and vanilla. I will definitely be taking these to potlucks and other functions as they are easy, tasty, and different from the norm. My husband gobbled them up in a day!

Great recipe. Easy to make and a quick way to make a dessert. Just made this for my hubs and he had two servings. I made the recipe as follows but didn't add walnuts. I used my brownie pan and baked it the exact time suggested. Came out delicious! It's a mix of a apple pie and a Apple crisp. Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe in a Muffin Tin as the picture shows. They came out perfect! Also,  I used a quarter less butter, because other reviewers stated they fell apart.  Loved them so much, made them again right away!

I made this today for a family dessert. I doubled the recipe and added 1 T of vanilla. I cooked it in a 13×9 for about 15 minutes longer. It was absolutely devine! I served it with a little warm caramel topping and a dollop of homemade whipped cream. Everyone raved about it! I will definitely be making this again.

This is definitely more of a cake recipe, but what a recipe!  Very moist and flavorful.  I gave it 5 stars, but the second time I incorporated some suggestions from others and added a tsp of vanilla extract and a 1/4 tsp of ground nutmeg.  Either way I like it, but a bit better with the additions.  I also added a crumb topping by melting 2 Tbsp butter and adding 1/4 cup sugar, a 1/2 tsp cinnamon, then added 1/4 cup of quick oats.  I combined well and sprinkled on top of the cake and baked for 45 min.  It gives it a nice presentation.  Thanks for the recipe, BakerJim!

Fantastic!  So easy and so good.  I didn't have the nuts and it still was great.  I did not melt the butter, but rather creamed the butter, 3/4c sugar, egg and 1t vanilla.  Added the chopped apples (I had frozen unpeeled apple slices and I simply cut them up.)To the dry mixture I added 1t cinnamon, 1/4t nutmeg. When finished I topped with cinnamon sugar mixture.  Next time I will only use 1/2c sugar.  Great warm with cool whip :)

Absolutely delicious!  I left out the nuts because I didn't have any, and added some dried cranberries.  It took about twice as long to bake as the recipe indicated.  Otherwise I made it exactly according to the recipe.  I took it to a gathering with friends, and served it with ice cream.  Everyone loved it!

My family loves it!!!! I was able to use organic ingredients & felt like I gave them a much healthier option for a snack/dessert! I put them in a muffin pan just to make them easier to grab & go & I diced the apples instead of apple slices!  Thank you so much for sharing:0)

Made this today.  Did the 3 apples but chopped them.  Added 2Tbs.  Melted butter with cinnamon and sugar mixture and poured on top.  Cooked  for 48 minutes.  Perfect!  Everyone loved it.  Would have been amazing with ice cream.  Next time I'm going to try peaches instead of apples.

Way, way, way too many apples. No wonder there are so many complaints about this being too soggy. I make this with one apple and even then it's soggy the next day.

Delicious! I had two large Honeycrisps that I needed to use up and so I made these scrumptious apple brownies. I shared some with the neighbor and she asked for the recipe. Try them! (P.S. I used pecans instead of walnuts because we like them better. Super good!)

DeeeLish! I did think I was going to flop it at first, because I made a few lil mistakes but it turned out GREAT!!! I make several alterations though - in small bowl I creamed butter and egg. In large bowl, i combined all dry ingredients - flour, sugars ( half brown, half white) cinnamon, pinch of nutmeg, soda, powder and salt. I also used 1.5 large apples and a red pear I had on hand combined with a handful of dried cranberries. I mixed the creamed mixture into the dry mixture - realized it was a bit dry so i added an extra egg. Then I added the apple mix. At that point it really came together! I baked it in a muffin tin for about 30 mins and WOW!!! Honestly a HUGE keeper! It was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. Served with a bit of coconut iced cream.  Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Awesome! First time I have ever made these and new to cooking. But... I had to use more than 48oz bag of chips and go to Milk choc ones too. I added crunchy peanut butter- I did a taste test and oh.. so good and you can't taste the nuts really 
Thank you!

WOW!  The smell of these baking was enough for 5 stars!  Of course, I can't leave well enough alone, so I added white chocolate chips and drizzled caramel syrup across the top.  SO delicious!  Thanks for the recipe--this will be in the rotation!  I believe I will try coconut with it next time!

This tasted very good, but the bake time was off. At 35 minutes, mine was still raw in the middle.  I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking to give it a nice crusty top.

Very moist, and yummy.  More like a very moist cake then a brownie.  I added the 1 tsp of vanilla to the egg & sugar mixture. I also added brown sugar, butter and sugar to the top as others had suggested. Thanks for sharing!

Tasted like a pretty standard apple cake, really can't call it a brownie though, the texture was light and fluffy. (Good as a cake, but not what I was looking for)

I really liked this recipe but I would use less sugar and possibly more cinnamon next time. I used apples given to me, and I don't know what variety they were, but from the outcome, I doubt it matters. They were pretty gooey, so I, personally, would cook them longer.

Soooooo amazing, I seriously ate almost the whole pan in one sitting. The only thing I did different was I didn't melt the butter I just creamed it with the sugar and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I will be making this again!

I gave this a 3-Star rating on it's misrepresentation of being a "brownie" recipe.  It is a cake, and I might add --- a very moist, tasty cake.  It would never make it as a brownie.  I made it for a children's bake sale where the children would purchase a brownie to eat for $0.50 as a fund-raiser.  They couldn't keep the so-called "apple brownie" together long enough to eat it because of crumbling due to its moistness.  The recipe makes a wonderful cake to be served on a plate and eaten with a fork which the children didn't have at the fund-raiser.  I will be making this recipe again, but only to serve as a cake.

Good flavor but way too moist.  Not a brownie texture at all.  Going to put back in the oven & see if it will dry out some. Won't make again unfortunately.

I made the recipe as directed, and it is a very tasty apple cake, not much of an apple brownie.  Thought it was good though, but definitely a consistency and sponginess of a cake.

I decided to try and make a gluten and dairy free version. I used quinoa flour, dairy free butter (and used less), used slightly less sugar, and it turned out great! I will definitely make it again!

Doubled it, added nutmeg, then served it with warm caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. Not a brownie or a bar; more like apple cake. But really delicious and easy.

Excellent taste and it was hard to stop at just one "test" square.  However, I found it to be a little underbaked, but that is likely my problem.  I used convection, which is 25 degrees lower than conventional, and I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan.  Even though the toothpick came out clean after an hour, I find the "brownie" a little limp and crumbly, although moist at the same time.  I chopped the apples like others suggested, so maybe my chunks were too big.   Again though, it is VERY good.  I will just cut my apples smaller next time and perhaps bake another 10 minutes or so.  Thanks for the recipe BakerJim!!

Very tasty, but I would prefer chopping or grating the apples instead of slicing.  In fact, even a good homemade sugarless chunky applesauce would work nicely - maybe add a little extra flour if it's too thin.  We omitted the walnuts this time, but they would have gone great.  Moist and delicious, and so easy - all I did was peel slice the apples, my seven year-old did the rest! Thanks, BakerJim - we really like these!

SO GOOD! You will love it! I had some apples at home that no one wanted to eat so I made these and yummmm, i've eaten two pieces already. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla as well. And mine is a bit gooey so i don't have nice square slices but it tastes so good I don't think anyone will mind the shape! Thanks BakerJim!

Very good.  I made it exactly how the recipe was written.  However, I thought they were too sweet for our taste (even though I used Granny Smith which are more tart than other sweet apples) so next time, I will cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup or 1/2 cup and see.

These are good.  I doubled the recipe, using 4 apples.  I think Granny Smith would be better.  Put into 9 x 13" pan.  Bake for about 40 minutes.  Next time sprinkle with cinnamon sugar when removing from oven.  I subbed 1/2 the butter with coconut oil, and subbed in a little bit of ground chia.  This made them quite crumbly.

These brownies were so good!  I made a caramel sauce to pour over the top and they paired perfectly with vanilla ice cream.

Very good.  Very moist.  Easy to make and a nice change from chocolate brownies.

Very good. Nice and moist.  More walnuts would have made it even better.

My family loves this recipe! I too recommend chopping the apples but 35 minutes in my oven is perfect every time. I guess my oven is hotter like BakerJim

My husband was a big fan of these and that's saying something for someone who usually always asks for chocolate desserts. I used gala apples and they worked fine. More like a cake than brownies. Actually reminded my of Nana's Apple Cake from Tastefully Simple only cheaper to make!

Very good and easy recipe.  Family loved it.  I used two large granny smith apples and pecans instead of walnuts.  I also reduce the amount of cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. because we do not like a strong cinnamon flavor.  I will make this again.

SOOOOOOOOOOOOO good! I followed a few other reviewers ideas and added 1 t of vanilla and 1/2 t of nutmeg and it was delicious! I topped this with a spice frosting, which was just white frosting mixed with some nutmeg and cinnamon. This is a truly amazing dessert that I will be making again and again!

too buttery for me - Although I didn't use 3 apples, just two, so maybe that effected it? I'm not sure.

These are to die for!! I absolutely love them. They are incredibly moist which is very important to me. I ate them warm right out of the oven and drizzled caramel sauce over the top. Soooo good!

I added 1cup dried cranberries, and omitted the nuts.  It took a full hour to cook, and even then it seemed underdone in the middle, but the top was burning so i took it out anyway.  It tasted delicious, but fell apart.  I probably won't make this again.

These are so moist and delicious! They're so easy to make and the perfect amount of sweet. I will DEFINITELY be making these again. I might think about adding some caramel candies to the batter to make them caramel apple brownies.

This was very simple to make.  Lots of labor chopping apples though.  The flavor was ok, the kids did not like at all.  I had to cook it much longer than listed.  I like the glazed apple cookies from this site much better.

They were awesome.  We just loved them and they were not hard to make either.  My husband didn't want to share them with anyone.
