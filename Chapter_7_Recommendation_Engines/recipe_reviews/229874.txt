My fiance and I really enjoyed this recipe. Used garlic rather than garlic salt.  The olives, zucchini, and mushrooms worked great together.  We'll definitely make this one again.

I didn't have garlic salt in hand, so I just put in garlic powder... I didn't really expect this dish to turn out that great from how it looked from the prep time, honestly.  However, the Cornish hens turned out juicy, and there was enough salt from the olives.  I think I will try it over wild rice, but I just ate it by itself.  It would be nice to skim some of the fat off since the liquid seems a little too fatty from the chicken.  However, definitely a great slow cooker recipe that's a keeper.

As a "newbie" cook, this recipe tasted amazing and was so easy to make (I added peas and used minced garlic)!  When it was cooked, I made a simple chicken bouillion roux from using the sauce from crock pot. Made simple homemade mash potatoes to complete it.  Wow!  Made this as my valentine's dinner for my fiance.  He loved it.

I was very skeptical at first due to the green olive, but everything blended together so perfectly it was great. The meat was practically falling off of the bone! The only thing I did differently was add a second can of the Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup to the pot and was so glad I did!

Doubled the recipe as I always do!!!  I am not a fan of green olives but my husband and children are, so needless to say I was a bit hesitant to try this recipe.  It didn't look appetizing nor did it smell appetizing before, during and after cooking but it tasted GREAT!!  I cooked my hens a bit longer on a lower setting as I doubled the recipe.  Also, I never use garlic salt or powder (just fresh garlic) 3 cloves for this recipe and 2 twists on my sea salt grinder was all I changed.  I did remove the hens from the crock pot and set them in my broiler for approximately 7 minutes to brown the tops (just cause that's the way I like them :)  The end result was delicious as I served it over long grain wild rice (A MUST)!  There really wasn't a need for me to double the stuffing/juice as there was plenty!  My husband who LOVES green olives stated that I should not put as many in next time.....and I, who am NOT A FAN of green olives LOVED it just the way it was!!!!  My boys, 8-13 years old LOVED it just as it was!  Thanks for a different way of preparing my hens in the "Slow Cooker"!  LOVE IT!!!

Only change was using garlic cloves and sea salt instead of garlic salt.  Cooked for 4 hours on high and I found the white meat of the cornish hens to be on the dry side.  The mushrooms, zucchini, olives mixture was good though.  Would not make this one again.

Great Recipe!  I make it all the time, my family loves it!The only thing I change is I use a chicken instead of the cornish hens. I put it on low for 8 hours in the slow cooker but follow the same ingredient amounts. Delicious

It didn't turn out looking quite as picture-perfectly pretty as the photo shown in the recipe, but it tasted amazing!  Would make this many time more.  The meat would just fall off the bones.  For never having prepared a cornish hen before, I was quite thrilled with it.

I made this today and it was a hit with my family. I wasn't sure about the olives and pimentos at first, with their salt content, but it balanced out nicely after cooking.

I loved the combination of muchrooms, zucchini and olives in this stuffing. I plan on trying a baked version of this sometime.

This is so good.  The flavors work very well together.  No substitutions here, I made it exactly as the recipe states.  Super quick and easy, minimal ingredients.  My new favorite crockpot recipe!

Because I love mushrooms and garlic, I added just a hair more than the recipe called for.

Such a simple, yet genius, recipe.

The sauce was delicious. My hubby is not a big fan of Cornish hen just because of the size. ,but  agreed this is the best Cornish hen dish I have made to date. Will make this again and try with chicken breasts.

I can’t believe this has 850 calories per serving!  It tasted very low cal to me.  My hen was a bit dry and overall the dish was bland, even with the wild rice.  I doubt I will be making again.

If I do this recipe again, I would have to watch the slow cooker carefully and manually turn it off at the right time. Cooking too long dries the meat out and the birds fall apart so completely they are hard to separate from the bones and serve.

Made it  according to recipe with minor adjustments- used less butter/margarine. Suggestions from others who made it were very helpful. I did place under broiler to get the skin crispy.  Nice flavor, easy, will make again.

I couldn’t find hens so I used drumsticks. I accidentally forgot the garlic so I added it to my rice along with green onion. It wasn’t too salty (I feared it might be). I also cooked on low because I didn’t want it in 4 hours.  Let me tell you....chicken fell off the bone (SUPER juicy) and it was DELICIOUS. Definitely adding this to my recipes!!!

This was delicious!  I used low sodium green olives and substituted garlic cloves for the garlic salt because I don't like to have overly salty food.  Easy to prepare and clean up!

The first time I made this, I thought the olives made it a little too salty.  The second time I made it, I substituted pesto for the olives.  It had a very nice flavor to it.

I changed all the ingredients... but great idea! I used a little vegetable broth and water in the bottom and added Italian seasoning, parsnips & dry lentils. Also put dry rice, right into the mix! (Just be sure to add the same amt of water to it as if you were cooking rice on the stove.)
