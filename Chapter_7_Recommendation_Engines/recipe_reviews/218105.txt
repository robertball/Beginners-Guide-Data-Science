This stew was very good and had the right amount of each ingredient, except the thyme. I put 5 sprigs of fresh thyme instead of the 1 recommended and still thought it was bland. Next time I will add a lot more and maybe some other spices. Or perhaps an additional Tbsp of dried thyme. The meat came out very tender and delicious. I will make this again, but with more spices and probably in the winter. Thanks Camping Girl!

Really delicious but you have to be 21 to buy all of the ingredients!  The better the browning, the tastier the stew definitely holds true in this recipe and the long slow cooking takes the edge off of the beer and gives the stew a marvelous flavor!

As written this would have been bland for us. I mixed the flour with a lot of my low salt cajun seasoning and pepper. I also used a lot more fresh thyme, taking it out when ready to eat. Added about 4 big cloves of fresh, minced garlic. I also cooked the stew meat and then added the beer (without draining) hoping some of the bitter beer flavor would cook off. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I had no clue what stout beer tasted like. It is kind of strong and slightly bitter. The stew has a bit of a bitter after taste to it and my husband noticed right away. He wasn't too crazy about it. He gives it a 4.  However, the stew is good, hearthy, and very easy to make. I served it over brown rice.

Super easy, lacked flavor.  Just so incredibly bland.  We were all dissapointed because it smelled great from the fresh thyme.

My husband couldn't stop raving about this stew!  Cut up a pot roast into 1 1/2 inch cubes and added steak spice to the flour.  Also put 2 TBS each of dijon and bbq sauce to the liquid, a bottle of amber beer and the same amount of chicken stock, which I used to deglaze the pan before adding it to the slow cooker.  Cooked on high for about 6 to 7 hours and it was A-MA-ZING.  Had it with the Irresistible Irish Soda Bread.... OMG it just put it over the top!!

As a person who loves all things beer, I was really excited to try this recipe.  It smelled so good throughout the day.  What a disappointment when it finally came time to eating it.  I agree with other reviewers that it was bland and didn't have much for flavor.  The only change I made was to use dry thyme as I didn't have any fresh on hand.  I'm not a big stew maker, so maybe there are tricks of the pros that make it better.  Neither my husband nor I thought very highly of this one.  I'll look elsewhere the next time I make stew.

Great recipe.  Next time I'll omit the vegetable oil and add a can of peas and corn.

I enjoyed it. My family thought it was a bit bland, but not bad. I'll play around with some spices and seasoning next time, but I'll definitely make it again. So easy to make.
