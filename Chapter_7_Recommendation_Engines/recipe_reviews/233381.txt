Easy and refreshing! Only had yellow lemonade, added a couple of drops red food coloring to make it more appealing.
Have made similar with lime concentrate and tequila!

We had a bunch of leftover Corona and decided to make this. What a fun way to use the leftover beer. I wouldn't go out of my way to make again but surely enjoyed it.
