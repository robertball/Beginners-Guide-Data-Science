This dish came out very well, much healthier than breaded and fried pork pieces.  The flavor was great but I also recommend putting the onions in sooner if you like really tender onions.

super simple and great tasting...kept the ingredients the same but altered the cooking directions...cut the peppers bigger more like the size of the onion wedges...put all the sauce ingredients together to sit while the pork was browning...cut cooking time down to about 20 min. total and the pork was not dry but juicy and the veggies were crisp tender...by the time the rice was done the pork & veggies were done....this is a keeper!!  Thanks!!

This is so easy and smells and tastes delicious!  It is especially good because while one part is cooking you can prepare the next part.  I would also recommend mixing wet and dry ingredients together separately before adding to the pan.

Tempted to give this 5*s because my 12 year old son said "This is good!"  Easy, easy, easy.  I used boneless pork rib, Knorr's pork gravy mix (because that's all I had on hand) and added a can of water chestnuts and cocktail (aka baby) corn.  Served it with whole grain noodles.  A crowd pleaser.

Quite a few of the other reviews state that the recipe has no flavor.  I don't agree.  I did sub real garlic for the garlic powder but I thought it burst with flavor and the friends at my dinner party raved about the taste.  I've had to email the recipe several times today.

Very easy to put together, and tasted great. If you don't have dry gravy mix (eg. Bisto), use 2 tbsp + 1 tsp cornstarch, since that's the main ingredient in a dry gravy mix.  Next time, I may add some mushrooms. Served with brown rice.

Sauteed vegetables separate: red bell peppers, onion, and broccoli in olive oil. Cooked pork until it was done and most juices were gone, then added other ingredients along with some spicy seasoning. Ended with a delicious slightly sweet and spicy dish served over a bed of brown rice. Keeper!

GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!  I love it.  I used two small Costco pork tender loin roasts.  I was skeptical about the vinegar, but it was not a problem. Next time I will probably omit the peppers. Not because I did not like them, but because they got very mushy.  The left-overs were wonderful too, maybe even better than the first serving.  Thanx Nancy.

I'm with other reviewers.  This was bland and lackluster.  I had to add more soy sauce to "kick it up just a notch," but would not make it again.

I made this several weeks ago and my husband and I both loved it.  It was easy, quick, and delicous.  Wasn't sure how to rate the kid things as I have none and wasn't sure kids would eat bell peppers.  I plan on doing it again and adding some brocoli to it.

This was an extremely easy dinner which my husband and I enjoyed.  I used leftover pork roast for the meat and green pepper only since that was what I had.  Thanks.

After reading some of the reviews I almost didn't try the recipe but decided to try it tonight.  My husband and I both loved it and wouldn't change a thing!  I served it over rice.  Was very easy to prepare and will definately fix it again!

A great recipe that is easy to prepare.  The ingredients combination may sound unusual, but the finished product is wonderful.  The only thing I did differently was salt and pepper the pork lightly before sauteeing.

This was an excellent dish!  I didn't have a packet of regular brown gravy mix, so I substituted it for a packet of  Aus Jus gravy which made the consistency a little thinner.  This made it great to pour on top of rice!  Great flavor.  Yum!!!

OMG made this Saturday night and it was the bomb.  I did change some things.  I used hot chili oil, used green onion instead of regular onion and add peanuts. Of course I had to make this in my wak just makes it more fun to prepare.  My friends loved it.  I didn't get too much because friends went back for more so this week I'm making it just for me. Thank you for sharing.

This is definately a keeper!  We loved it and my husband said to be sure to add this to our recipe book!
The only change I made was that I used a packet of mushroom onion soup/gravy mix instead of the brown gravy mix...and that was due to the supplies on hand.

Easy and tasty! Very nice sweet and sour balance. Did wait to add the peppers until the last 5 minutes as I like them crisp. Other than that followed to a T and it was enjoyed by all.  Leftovers are great for lunch!

I am a beginner and this dish was not only VERY easy for me it was also delicious. I was worried I would screw it up.I followed the recipe with the exception of the onion(sorry onion fans but I hate them) I also used a tad bit less of the ginger because I was afraid it would be too overpowering. I will try it next time with the suggested amount and see how that goes. My only recommendation to people who are going to try this recipe it was flavorful over some rice because the rice soaks up the juices and makes it filling...very yummy and thank you for sharing!!!!

This was a quick and easy recipe that took very little effort to make and tasted wonderful! After reading the other reviews on this recipe I, too, decided to combine all of the wet recipes (after letting the pork brown in oil alone for about 5mins) while the pork sauteed. I didn't have red wine vinegar in the house, so i used the sweet red wine I had laying around and white vinegar (a 1:2 ratio of wine to vinegar since it was a sweet red). If you decide to do this, I'd say use a dry red vice sweet red. Also, if you like crispy veggies, put the onions and peppers in at the very last moment--no more than 5mins. I also served it over steamed white rice. I think I'll try it w/broccoli next time like someone else suggested--that would've made this recipe perfect! Don't be afraid to make extras because this meal makes great leftovers for lunch the next day!!

This has become a staple at my house.  My husband and I both love it.  Easy to make and very tasty.  I like to buy a big pork loin, cut it into sections to make several meals, and one of them is always Honey Pork with Peppers!

I was pleasently suprised by this dish. I was leary about using the gravy mix but it was fine. The flavor of the sauce turned out good. I might add a bit of red pepper paste to it next time. I added water chestnuts and might add some shredded carrot. I cooked my veggies until just tender. I wouldn't want them to be too mushy in this dish. It's nice to have a bit of chrunch in them since they are a highlight of the dish. This was very good and I'll be making it again.

My husband LOVED this.  I liked it, but made some changes.  First of all, I added about 2 teaspoons of Splenda, and 3 dried red chili peppers.  Also, next time I will cut the meat in smaller pieces, because it got a little dry, and did not pick up quite enough flavor.  Also, will add the red bell pepper just a little later, because it got too soft.  I didn't think it was too watery - thought it was just right.

Very good recipe. If it turned out watery for people, then my suggestion is to make sure the pork is fully thawed before cooking, the oil is really hot before adding pork, and use a wok and boil out excess liquid before adding the liquid ingrediants. I added real garlic and sauted the pork with it, would have used real ginger also if I had it on hand at the time.

Easy to prepare, smells wonderful cooking!  Doubled the garlic. (Will use fresh garlic next time). the end result was a little runny, but I think if I had drained the liquid from the pork before adding the other ingredients, it would have been fine. Yummy, Yummy!

My husband enjoyed this much more than I did. I found it rather bland, and did not care much for the sweetness. I would make it again only if requested.

Quick, easy, and completely YUMMY!!!  Hubby loved it and quickly gobbled it up.  Served with home made mashed potatoes.  Think next time I'll try it with rice too.  Thanks for sharing! Jennifer :)

This was really easy and great tasting.  My husband thought I had used sirloin steak to make this, so he was really fooled.  He said it was one of the best recipes he'd ever had!  I've added it to my family recipe book.

I was not impressed with this one. It was very sweet and didn't really have all that much flavor. Also, I don't think pork loin is the best cut of meat for this. It became extremely dry by the end of the cooking process and I followed the directions very carefully. I won't be putting this in my line up.

It was instantly a family favorite. We eat this like once a week. I took others suggestions and combine veggies with the sauce and simmer for 15 mins instead of simmering twice for 30 mins. I also add more veggies. I add Brussels sprouts, broccoli, mushrooms and whatever else I'm feeling for the night.

I cooked this for Sunday dinner and we loved it. I used the mini peppers and green onions. I also used two cups of gravy and ground fresh ginger and it was awesome! The entire family loved it ages 14 to 81.

My 14 year old son was upset because there wasn't more. It definetly wasn't bland.

This was surprisingly easy to prepare and the results were great.  Served over a bed of rice and I will definitely be adding this one to my schedule of meals to have.

I found a ziploc bag of cubed pork in my freezer that was getting old so I hunted for a new recipe calling for pork cubes and found this one.  I'm glad I made it.  It was delicious and easy.  I didn't change any of the ingredients.  One of the reviewers had said that she had mixed the dry gravy mix and water ahead of time and I would suggest that.  I think my dry gravy mix was on the shelf too long and I experience quite a few lumps by adding the water afterwards.  Its just a suggestion to avoid that problem.  Thank you submitter.

I made this tonight and thought it was very good.  My sauce didn't thicken but it was still tasty.  The last 15 min simmer made the veggies a little too soft for me but I'll just shorten that next time.

Fabulous!  Easy to prepare and delicious.  Directions were meticulous.  My guy asked me several times, "You're going to keep this recipe, right?"  :-)  Served with Jasmine rice and colorful mixed veggies to round out the presentation.

I thot this was quite tasty.  I used diet Coke instead of water.  I sauteed my onions with the pork, mixed the dry and liquid ingredients together.  Put the pork/onions in my 1-1/2 qt crock pot.  Poured the soup/coke and seasonings and green pepper over it and cooked it for 4 hours on low.  Served it over white rice.

I can't see why anyone would say it was bland.  The sauce was a little thin, but that worked great over my rice.

I did use fresh garlic too and only a green pepper and chopped my onion up.

I guess you would say I tweaked the heck out of it, but it sure was good.

This tasted like ordinary sweet and sour pork to me.  Yes it was tasty but boring.  The sauce turns out quite runny and doesn't thicken up, even when I made a rough of flour and water.  I would suggest cutting back on the water to at least half.  I will make this again but only if requested, not because I want to.

I didn't care for this dish. It was too bland for my taste. I halved the recipe and didn't measure everything exactly, so it may have been my fault, but I don't think I will try this one again.
