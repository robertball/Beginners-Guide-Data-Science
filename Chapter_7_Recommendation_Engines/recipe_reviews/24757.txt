This is a good recipe.  But honestly, I find all the different steps tedious and unnecessary.  Just make a roux with the butter and flour, then add the milk and let thicken, then add the onion and cheese and lastly the spinach.  Then pour into a casserole.  It just seemed more time consuming than it should have been and it turned out to be just like other creamed spinach recipes I've made before.  The taste is good (whoa is there a lot of cheese!) though.

This was fun to make and all  I added to it was  1/2 cup of cracker crumbs with the cheese.I let it set up for 10 mins out of the oven and it was a big hit with my picky family....

This is a great recipe.  I made it for Easter and it was the hit of the table. I used all the ingredients  listed but I changed the way I prepared it.  I prepared it using only one pan on the top of the stove.  I used the 1 tbls. of butter and sauted the onions until browned then I added the 3 tbls. additional butter to the same pan and after it melted I added the flour and blended until a smooth paste formed.  After that I added cold milk, the dry mustard and garlic salt.  When the mixture thickened I added the cheddar cheese.  I stirred the cheese and mixture until the cheese was melted and then added the spinach. Combined it all and then put in into the casserole dish and topped it with the Montery Jack cheese. Popped it in the oven and it came out perfect.

This is good for a vegetable side, but even better as an appetizer!  I used smoked cheddar and topped with a shredded Mexican blend.  Next time I will add tabasco when I prepare it.  Also, chopped artichoke hearts would be really good in this!  I'll do that next time!

This is so good! I did add my own touch by adding crumbled bacon. I didn't add salt, the bacon had enough in it. Thank you for the nice casserole idea!

I think as the recipe stands, it's not a "perfect" recipe - I altered it a bit by not using quite as much Jack cheese on top and adding chopped garlic with the onions and some extra spice !  It turned out delicious, and I'll probably make it again and alter it to what "feels" good at the time !
The consistency was "spoon out" and not cut and serve as I anticipated !
My husband loved it !!

This was a good recipe. I too did not want to dirty too many pans creating this dish so I followed a couple of other suggestions by doing all the stove-top cooking in one pan.  Instead of onions, I used shallots, browned those in 1 TBS of butter, added flour and remaining butter until thickened, then added milk, let that thicken slightly, then added cheese to melt and finished by adding the spinach until heated through and thoroughly mixed and slightly more thickened. Then I dumped it all in the casserole dish to bake.  It took longer to bake than the 10 minutes stated.  Since most of the heating and cooking is done on the stove-top, the purpose of the oven is to brown the cheese on top. Next time I will use a little higher temp for this purpose.  It definitely needs to set-up when removing from the oven. I thought it was way to runny and that I had ruined it, but about 10 minutes to set - it was perfect.  I will make this one again as it was a big hit even with my father who hates veggies - he even took seconds! I think because there is soooo much cheese in this recipe, I will reduce the amount next time and maybe add some breadcrumbs to the mixture next time for something a little thicker and with slightly less cholesterol content.

This recipe was excellent! It was easy to make. The only change I made was substituting onion powder for the chopped onions. My relatives loved it so much that I only got to eat a few spoonfuls! I will definitely be making this again.

Best spinach recipe ever. That being said, I did make a few substitutes:  sea salt and minced fresh garlic in place of garlic salt; 1 full teaspoon dry mustard instead of 1/2; crumbled feta cheese in place of the Monterey jack; and I topped the casserole with a thin layer of buttered crumbs. Thank you for this great recipe!

Yummy! I usually don't like cooked spinach, but I LOVED this dish. I mean, come on....how can you go wrong with any dish that is this cheesy! My husband and my two daughters (ages 3 and 11 months) also gobbled it up.

I love spinach and this was great. I added 2 small eggs and decreased the milk to 2 cups as well as the butter/margarine to only 3 tablespoons. I also used shredded cheddar instead of the cubed. I deleted the onion, mixed all the ingredients together in a large bowl; heated the milk, butter/margarine, and cheese which made a cheese sauce and poured in over the spinach. Delicious!!!

I make this with fresh spinach rather than frozen and we really enjoy it.  Also, I occasionally use a mozzarella and parmesan blend on top rather than the Monterey Jack to give the dish a hint of the character of pizza.

A very good way to do spinach, but next time I will probably throw in some swiss or feta.  Threw in some bacon as another reviewer suggested & it made for a tasty surprise in each forkful.

This is SOOOO yummy and so good. It'll convert anyone who claims not to like spinach. I made this (halved) for diner with meatloaf and mashed potatoes (which, IMHO, I make better than anyone in the world), and all I wanted to eat was this spinach. I made it just as the recipe called for, but added buttered crumbs on top and let them brown instead of the extra cheese.

Great spinach dish for vegetarians and those on gluten free diets can sub all purpose G.F. flour for wheat flour.  Best yet, it tastes wonderful.  I used full fat evaporated milk for richness.  Thanks Sal....

I love this recipe, they have it on the menu at our favorite B.B.Q. house. I do add cubes toast pieces to the cheese topping. If you try this recipe you will really like it, even if you don't like spinach.

I made this dish for an office pitch-in.  It was solidly good, and I felt good about making it from scratch without any highly processed ingredients.  I like my food a little more interesting, though, so next time, I will add something to give a little more zip - some more garlic salt and some hot sauce, probably - but I did have someone ask for the recipe, so it went over pretty well as is.  I did make it straight from the recipe this time.

This was an excellent dish. I had to cook it a little longer than stated (5 or 10 minutes),  but everyone at my Christmas party last year commented on it.  There was none left.

I'm not into cheese, but my husband really liked it.  Unfortunately, my 2 year old was not fond of it even though the spinach was masked in a lot of cheese.  I still give it 5 stars because I didn't expect her to like it - I was mainly making it for my husband.

Made this for a vegetarian potluck and there was not a bit left in the casserole dish when we left.  Several people asked for this recipe.  Kids and adults both enjoyed it a lot.

I have made this recipe as is before without any tweaking and it was good. I made a few minor tweaks to the recipe. First, I used almond flour instead of regular flour. I was cleaning out my cupboards and found the flour. Wanted start using it up. I used 2 cups of milk instead of 2.5. I wanted a bit less moisture for the dish. I had some sliced cheese on hand that I needed to use up. It was a Colby-jack-habanero sliced cheese. Used a 1/2 and 1/2 of this cheese with shredded cheddar. Overall I think I used about a 1/4 more cheese than the original recipe. Those were the only changes on the prep and the ingredients. Baked it for 25 minutes at 325 in a convection oven. It was delish!  It was almost like a dip. I'll be making this again with the changes I made.

I really really wanted to like this recipe, but it wasn't very good.  I will try it again, but this time double the sauce and triple the spices.

I think I was hoping for more from this recipe.  After all of the preparation it took, ultimately, it tasted like any other creamed spinach to me.

This basic recipe goes by another name in my boyfriend's family, from Louisiana - they call their version Spinach Madeleine. It is really good but rich, and can be very spicy.

This came out watery, and looking curdled.  Being a long-time spinach fan I was quite disappointed.

We made this the other night and we're already talking about when we're going to have it again.  The only problem was that there weren't any leftovers ... everybody loved it!

I followed the recipe exactly as listed.  Unlike others who said theirs was a bit runny, mine came out of the oven with the perfect consistency, like a dip.  Though the texture was great, I thought it was missing something in flavor.  I noticed a few reviewers say to add bacon or even crushed Ritz crackers on top.  I might try that if I make this again.  If  planning to eat as a dip, the bacon would certainly be an asset.  Also, I don't see any need for all-purpose flour vs regular self rising.  If anything, a bit of added salt might be good.  This is a good recipe but, for my family, I just need to add a little something more to add some depth to the flavor.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this as called for in the directions.  As it stands it was very good.  Using this as a base I will make a few changes by adding Bread crumbs and bacon.

I added ham and bacon. Wasn't a fan the night I made it but eating the  leftovers the next night made the flavors mesh so nicely. Soooo much better the next day.

This was very good.  My only experience with Spinach Marie is from Old Country Buffet.  Like everything else at OCB it was tasteless, but this recipe has renewed my faith in this dish, I will make it again.

I increased this recipe to 25 servings for a party and there was hardly any left. It really is good.  I had to copy the recipe for several guests.  It's easy and tastes great!

Not Bad. Not five stars either. Although I was looking for a Spinach sauce and it seemed to do the trick. If I try it again I might add a little more spice or something.
