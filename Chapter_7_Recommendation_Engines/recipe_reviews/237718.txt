These were refreshing and very yummy! I used frozen strawberries because that is all I had and substituted Greek yogurt.

Very good yogurt bars which I really like (and it's my vote that counts :) The grandkids prefer popsicles not made with yogurt.

I loved everything about this. I didn't find any one or another flavor too overwhelming and I really liked the silken texture. My not-quite-2-year old loved it as well!

I've tried this recipe and if u don't like honey I wouldn't make it becouse u can really taste the honey! I think it would taste alot better without the honey. Alot better!

This were a hit but I made some minor alterations to the recipe.I omitted the apple juice because I forgot to pick up some but these did not need it. I also used vanilla greek yogurt because that is what I had on hand. I ended up with 3 popsicles. My younger 2 really liked them and so did I.

I blended strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, 2 whole carrots, a teaspoon of ground ginger, and a splash of lemon juice I used water as my base. Turned out great!

The pops were fruity and creamy.  They were better than those fruit pops you buy on the street carts.

I made this recipe. Maybe it's the different mold I purchased. But I can't get the frozen pops out of the molds. I've tried running hot water to kind of loosen them a little bit but that is not working. Please help! What am I missing?

Made this last week with my two assistants (ages 3 and 8) and they are a huge hit! Easy enough for the kids to feel involved, tasty enough for them to think this was a big deal snack and yet all 'healthy' ingredients! I can see this being very easy to modify as well. Will use this again and again, thanks!
