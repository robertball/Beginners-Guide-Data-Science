This is a tasty recipe, even without the bacon (I'm a vegetarian). I felt that the red wine vinegar was essential to the tanginess of the dressing; I recommend that you do not substitute white vinegar, although an apple cider vinegar might be a good substitute. Consider making this salad a day in advance and refrigerate for the flavors to develop (give it a good stir before serving, as the dressing will settle to the bottom. In place of the golden raisins, I used dried cranberries, which added color and a little zing. You could also add coarsely grated carrot for visual appeal and added vitamins. If you're going to travel with this recipe, just put the sunflower seeds in a ziplock baggie and stir it in when you serve the salad--the seeds will stay crunchy that way. You might also reserve some of the sunflower seeds and raisins/cranberries to sprinkle on the top of the salad for a pretty presentation. It went over very well at a family get-together and I was repeatedly asked for the recipe!

I have used this recipe several times. It's always requested! I did make some changes. 6 tbs's of red wine vinegar seemed like a lot. I reduced the 1/2 c. sugar to 1/3 c. and used Splenda instead of sugar, used 4 tbs's of red wine vinegar and reduced mayo to 3/4 c light mayo. I also use the hormel or oscar meyer precooked crumbled bacon in package (found in bacon bits aisle & less calories then fresh bacon. I wouldnt recommend bacon bits. they have a stale, fake taste)Can easily be doubled or tripled for large get togethers

This was a good broccoli salad. However, I felt that the RED BROCCOLI SALAD on this site was much better. The red grapes, toasted slivered almonds, and purple onion make for an outstanding presentation, and the flavors pique the tastebuds. I make both salads for potlucks, but my most requested recipe is that of the Red Broccoli salad.

Good salad.  Substituted craisins or dried cherries for the raisins and didn't use the sunflower kernels...i think I used slivered almonds.  I made this a while back and am just now writing a reveiw for it.  But I do remember it tasted good.  Will probably make this again.

I use dried cranberries instead of raisins, and leave out the seeds as my family doesn't like them.   Also, add a cup of cubed (~1/2 inch pieces) sharp cheddar cheese for more pizzaz!  It's best to add the dressing right before serving, or the broccoli will be soggy.

Even those who wrinkle their nose at broccoli will have a small sample and enjoy this one. I have subbed crasins (they now come in several varities) when I need a change. Made this for a Christmas party a week ago and I made it again today for lunch (using the crasins).  Both times = great! The combo of raisins and broccoli make this a favorite with my daughter!

This is a great, easy salad for summer parties.  However, I doubled the broccoli in order to make enough for 8 people.  I also left out the sunflower seeds and used pre-cooked bacon bits, and it was great!!

People were scared about the fact that the broccoli was raw, but once they tasted it they realized it didn't matter.  The bacon really makes the salad but 1/2 pound would have been enough.

This was very good.  My only changes were using Broccoli Slaw you buy already shredded, I left out the sunflower seeds (didn't have any), and used @ 1 tbsp. rice wine vinegar.  I was in a hurry and "eyeballed" the measurements.  This salad was Fantastic... my 7 year old grandson said it was AMAZING!  That is quite a compliment coming from him.  It took all of 5 minutes to throw it together, and it was YUMMY!  It's now going into my "side dish" favorites.  Thanks for the recipe, Jennifer.

Delicious recipe! Very high fat with the bacon, though. I've made it several times and made a few adjustments. I've used 2 cups of broccoli florets with 2 cups of broccoli slaw (available in many produce departments). Also, served with store-bought "real" bacon pieces on the side, as many people are health-conscious and opt for no bacon. I've also used pecans or walnuts in place of sunflowers. Use less sugar and "light" mayonnaise. I highly recommend this and people always ask for the recipe. Thanks for a great one!

Great recipe!  It is really easy to throw together - and add pretty much what you want - I added both golden raisins and some dried cranberries, and used some toasted peacns instead on sunflower seeds..yum!!!

We really enjoy this recipe.  We make it a lot in the summer, but it is great anytime.  Everybody is always asking for the recipe.  I do not add rasins.  And I cut back on the sauce (it seems too juicy/runny) and I added about 1 cup of ched. cheese. YUMMY!

Excellent!  The dressing was the perfect measurements for this recipe, as well as the raisins and nuts.  I made it with 3 bags of frozen brocolli flowerettes from Green Giant (14oz. bag).  It was delicious!  Thank You!

I was looking for a broccoli salad recipe similar to the one they serve at the cafeteria where I work.  This one far surpassed my expectations!  I made it for a party and even the meat loving guys ate it up!  Now, I'm sharing the recipe with my colleagues.

This is my husband's favorite salad - he cannot get enough of it when we make it! I have no children and can't rate it as to kid-friendliness though. It would go well with the kids in my extended family though - they all love bacon.

One of my fave recipes. Made tonight for a church potluck with rave reviews. Try reducing the sugar to scant 1/3 cup, use 1/2 red onion, small dice, reduce  the vinegar to 3T, and add 1/2 c (4 oz) pre-shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of bacon. Yum!

This is a great dish for company - I've made it for my in-laws and for a church supper, with rave reviews! I used pre-cooked bacon & Salad type precooked bacon bits with good results. Thanks Jennifer!

This was a hit at my neighborhood potluck.  The texture remained good even after sitting on ice the whole afternoon.  Several people asked for the recipe.  I have had a better broccoli salad that had cranberries in it.

I made this version yesterday- omitting the sunflower seeds. I tried Alyson's Broccoli Salad from this site for Christmas dinner and liked it better. This recipe has too much sugar for my taste and I prefer the milder flavor of the white vinegar over the red. Plus for some reason the green onions were a little overpowering.

Super Delicious and super easy! I'm not a raisin fan so I substitute dried cranberries instead.  Make sure to store in fridge for a couple hours before serving so all the flavors can really marry.

This was delicious!  I will definitely make it again.  I didn't have any sunflower seeds so I used chopped pecans.  I used less than half the mayo sauce and it was still too much.  I think 1/3 of the sauce would have been better.  I used 1/4 lb of bacon and it wasn't quite enough.  Next time I will add a couple more slices.

This salad should really be called "Bacon and Mayonnaise Salad with a Tiny Broccoli Garnish."  I can't believe other reviewers mentioned adding additional meat - there's a POUND of bacon in here, people!  I knew ahead of time that we'd find that overwhelming, so I used less than a half a pound, and it was still too bacon-y.  I ended up adding an extra three cups of broccoli to try and cut the bacon a bit.  If you're a bacon lover, go for it, but it was too much for us.  If I make it again, I won't use any more than three slices.  (I did add twice the raisins and sunflower seeds called for, which I'd do again.  And we both really liked the dressing; I used the full amount of vinegar, but only 3/8 cup of sugar.)

I made it as stated on the first try, but the vinegar was so overwhelming to me.  The second time I tried it I used only 1 1/2 Tbsp. of apple cider vinegar & it was perfect for my taste.  (I was looking for something along the lines of what walmart deli used to sell) and I found it!

When I was making the dressing to this salad, I was thrown off by the amount of red wine vinegar, it seemed too strong. Even after it was all mixed in it was way too much so I was actually going to throw the salad out. But we were going for dinner at a friends and this is what I made...BUT once dinner time came around and the salad flavors had time to merry it was FANTASTIC! All it needed was a little time. So I would suggest to everone DONT be thrown off by the vinegar, and make it at least 1 hour in advance! This was a great salad =)

I made this salad for my sister's bridal shower.  I added cauliflower and used dried cranberries instead of raisins.  It turned out great.  Will definitely make it again.

This was wonderful. A great hit at get togethers. The only thing I will note is that you add the dressing until it is coated thouroughly but not soaked!

I like this version with sunflower seeds instead of nuts, and green onions instead of yellow onion.  The onion can sometimes be overpowering with yellow onion, and the sunflower seeds are much less work!

Everyone loves this, and other than frying the bacon and chopping the broccoli, it's pretty easy to assemble.

This HAS to be the recipe for the broccoli salad at Souplantation, it tastes identical!  It's perfect for holidays, potlucks, and summertime.  The ingredients are all perfect together and the measurements are spot on - this is seriously an awesome salad!!

This is a long time favorite of ours.  It's always a big hit and people are always surprised at how good it is.  We've made changes for our personal preferences:  we use jumbo raisins, red onion, and Marie's Poppy Seed dressing (found in the produce department of our local grocery store).   Enjoy!

I doubled this recipe for a work potluck. This was the first time I had made this recipe, so I followed it exactly except that I used a red onion and Craisins. By the time I got to the bowl, it was down to the last 8-10 bites of broccoli. This is a recipe I will definitely make again! Thanks for sharing!

I've made this several times and it always goes over well. I prefer the brocolli to marry with the mayo and red wine vinegar so I usually mix that and let it sit for a few hours. I add the bacon crumbs and sunflower seeds right before I get ready to serve it. I prefer using dried cranberries as it gives another tart dimension.

Yums!  I substituted raisins for blueberries and I didn't have any sunflower seeds, so I used sesame seeds.  Also didn't have green onions so I used scallops.  Broccoli never tasted so good.

This almost the same salad my aunt makes every thanksgiving.The only things she does differantly is that..She uses 2 cups broccoli and 2 cups cauliflower and  instead of raisins we use dried cranberries,instead of the green onion...1 small red onion(chopped) and cashews instead of the sunflower seeds.Try it this way you will love it! Either way it is a great salad and even kids love it!

This recipe called for way too much bacon and not enough broccoli.  Despite upping the broccoli to double what it called for I found that there was too much dressing.  The dressing was also a weird flavor to my taste buds.  Won't be making again.  It could have potential  though.

This recipe is tasty and versatile!  I wanted a larger salad so I added baby spinach leaves & cucumber slices.  I doubled the sunflower seeds, raisins and dressing to make up for the extra veggies.    I also used turkey bacon and low fat mayonaise.  It's still one of the best broccoli salads I've tasted.

I only gave it a 3 because I ended up modifying this recipe quite a bit. To cut back on fat and calories, I used BACOS instead of bacon. I also used dried pinneapple and red grapes but cutting them in half like other suggestions and I also added shredded sharp cheddar cheese. It came out like a new recipe but it was delish. I guess I didn't know I had it in me to be so creative.

Hands down my favorite broccoli salad recipe!  There's just something about the golden raisins that add the perfect flavor...not quite as sweet as regular reasons but still a nice juxtaposition to the salty of the bacon, the little bit of spice of the onion (I like to use finely chopped red onions in addition to the green), and the creamy base of the mayo/vinegar combo.   Love love love this salad!

This is a wonderful salad!  Every bit of it was gone when I served it to guests last week.  I didn't have any sunflower seeds so substituted slivered almonds and it was well-received.  I'll definitely make this again.  My husband isn't a huge veggie fan, but he had several helpings of this salad!

The picture doesn't match the ingredients. I only notice because I have recently had both versions in local restaurants and came searching for the recipe, as it is was SO tasty. Having said that, I preferred the pictured version to the ingredient list here. For what it's worth the pictured recipe has cashews (not seeds), red onion (not green), broccoli AND cauliflower, and cranberries (not raisins).  Yummy both ways, thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe to the "T" and it seemed very sugary sweet to my family.  I think for my family to enjoy better I would cut the sugar and vinegar amounts by atleast half.  I had a broccoli salad very similar to this at a Woman's Retreat....it was FABULOUS, but NOT nearly so sweet - All other ingredients hold up well!

Our family's favorite side dish.  Tastes even yummier the next day.  I have subbed Splenda and cider vinegar with terrific results.

This salad is Deelicious! I took it to work and everyone was asking for the recipie. I doubled the recipie and used hormel bacon pieces, crasins,chopped red onion and roasted sunflower seeds. Since I made it the night before I mixed the dressing but didn't pour it on the salad until the next morning before I left for work. The dressing looked pink when I made it from the vinegar but when I took it out of the fridge at lunch time it was white. Make the dressing just as it says in the recipie. It's sweet yet tangy at the same time. This dressing would be great to use if your making coleslaw too. It's a keeper!

When I make this salad I use 1/2 mayonnaise and 1/2 vanilla yougert and 1/3 cup of raspberry vinegarette (instead of red wine vinegar) for the dressing. I also use more raisins and sometimes use broken cashews in place of the sunflower seeds. We can't get enough of this salad and leftovers are wonderful! So far everyone has loved it.

I have made this salad for years and everyone that tries it LOVES it!  The recipe I use has different proportions though.  I use 1/2 lb. of bacon, 1 cup raisins & sunflower seeds.  I use 1 cup mayo, with a 1/4 cup sugar and only 3 tablespoons white vinegar.  I think the proportions in this recipe would make this much to tart for my taste and there would be way too much bacon in proportion to the other ingredients.  Try changing the proportions until you get the taste you love.

Loved it!  I skipped the raisins as some are not fans.  Also used Miracle Whip instead of mayo-personal preference.  Going into my keeper file.

This is really good. I make this all the time now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and thought there was too much dressing and bacon. So instead I add 6 cups of broccoli and only  
abut 1/3 pkg bacon. Always use dried cranberries in place of raisins. Depending on the brand of red wine vinegar that I use, I have to watch the amount to add. Sometimes it is very strong. This salad is usually best eaten the first day it's made, as it tends to get soggy as time passes.

This was absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS, and I would advise everyone to try it.  Did do a lot of substituting: used Hormel real bacon bits, defrosted broccoli cuts, slivered almonds, and craisins.  Cut the dressing by about 25%, and then also cut back on the sugar IN the dressing, since I used low-fat mayo.  It needed a healthy sprinkle of salt.  I had one problem, though--it overpowered my egg foo yung.  Any thoughts as to what would go well with this if it were served as a side-dish for a regular dinner??  Or should one add a bunch of meat to it and serve it as a meal by itself??  Any thoughts would be appreciated.  Thank you.  It is DELICIOUS.

Broccoli is one of my all-time favourite foods, so I was happy to stumble on this classic. You see broccoli salad recipes all the time, and this recipe is the most basic and splendid one of all. This recipe has JUST the perfect balance of both sweet and sour. I made it just now, and I love it! Thank you!

I made this recipe for work and got raves over it. I didn't have any red wine vinegar so I used 1/2 Basalmic and 1/2 white vinegar and it was fantastic. I'll definately make this again and again.

Have made this several times.
The dressing is a bit sweet for my taste; you might consider cutting the sugar back slightly. My husband prefers it according to the recipe.
I always use regular raisins, recommend the sunflower seeds when they are available, but aren't essential. We have also substituted shredded carrots or cauliflower for some of the broccoli.
Do give the dressing time to sit and mingle flavors.
Always excellent!

Delicious, just like my mom makes!  Two tips though.  First, unless you really enjoy strong onion flavor, cook them just a little.  And if you make it ahead of time, add the sunflower seeds right before serving so they don't get soggy.

This recipe was pretty good. I only ended up using about half of the dressing, I think if I had used the whole amount it would have been way to goopy.   Otherwise, it was easy and delicious and a big hit.

This is a great recipe. I use regular raisins for more color to the salad. I also use red onions because they're sweeter and again it adds color. I also use Oscar Mayer Recipe Bacon Bits. It comes in pouches at the supermarket. So much more convenient than having to cook bacon. This is a great salad for summer and it goes really well as a side to Christmas Ham.

Everyone loves this salad.  I make it for pot lucks all the time. I chopped the broccoli very small and I used red onion in place of the green and just used regular raisins.  I make it the night before (we like it better this way) and add the bacon and sunflower seeds before serving.

I had some b.salad from the grocery store baking section, which i liked but is kind of expensive.  so i decided to make my own that was close to the store bought ingredients which was my 1st time ever tasting this type of salad and this recipe was very close but better.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is awesome.  I first had this recipe at my families Thanksgiving Dinner some years ago.  I usually can't get enough.  It's in a class by itself.

This was te classic broccoli salad - very good, but slightly too sweet for my liking.  I would cut back on the sugar slightly for my next go - otherwise, very good!!  Thanks for the recipe

This was DELICIOUS!!  My husband hates broccoli & he loved this salad.  He went back for more a few times :)
I took advise from a few of the other reviews.  I blanched the broccoli for better color and consistancy.  Instead of red wine I used balsamic & cut sugar to 1/3 C ... left mayo the same.  
Next time will add carrots - I think that would add great color as well as more nutrition/flavor.

This stuff is awesome!.. I could eat it all day long!  My preference is red onion instead of green though... This salad is sweet, crunchy, chewy and zingy with all the ingredients combined.  You can cut down on fat by decresing the bacon and using a lower fat mayo, but I wouldn't recommend it because you loose some flavor!  the broccoli, rasins and sunflower seeds are good for you too!:)

This is a wonderful recipe. I made it according to the recipe the first time, without onions (personal preference) and 5 T red wine vinegar. It was very good, but a little too tangy for our taste.  So, the next time I used 4T of Balsalmic vinegar instead and it was DELICIOUS!!  I love the golden raisins in it! Great recipe!

This is a great recipe which I especially like during the hot summer months.  I've also made it by adding cauliflower and using toasted walnuts and finely sliced red onion.  Mmmmm Good.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I have been making this salad for years.  A friend of mine brought it to a potluck and I got the recipe from her.  I usually increase the broccoli, I don't really measure it, but I think it's about 6 cups.  I cut the raw bacon into small pieces with kitchen shears, then fry it all at once, stirring occasionally, until pretty crisp.  My cats go nuts, hoping I'll drop some.  I have to move quick if I want some salad, between my husband and the cats, this goes quick.  I made some Monday and it was gone Tuesday morning.  Just bought some more broccoli and bacon to make it again.  Great recipe!

We have a recipe that we use that's very similar to this one. But rather than sunflower seeds we use peanuts, we cut back a lot on the mayo, and use plain vinegar. It's definitely one of my favorite foods to make and to eat. :)

AWESOME RECIPE!! I love the red wine vinegar, rather than regular vinegar. I made this for a family dinner, and it was a huge hit! I didn't have red onion, so I added diced white onion. I also doubled the raisins. I must say, this is the best broccoli salad I have ever eaten!

My family and I LOVED this!!!!  I left out the raisens though.  And I just used bacon bits instead of frying up bacon.  This made it a lot faster.  Even my 10 year old brother, who hates broccoli, kept telling me how much he liked it.

I made this for a recent family birthday dinner.  My 91 year old dad said he didn’t know broccoli could taste so good!  I definitely will make this again.  I did a few minor tweaks to the recipe since I am wanting to reduce calories and sugar in my diet.  I used reduced fat mayo, and for half the sugar I used Splenda (next time I will use less of both) I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins because I had those on hand. I used only used enough of the dressing to coat the broccoli mixture so I had some left over.  Not sure what the final calorie count was but it was really good!

Loved this one!  The red wine vinegar really adds some pop to it.  I did add pine nuts and dried cranberries, just because I had them.  I make broccoli salads all the time in the spring and summer; this one took the cake!

This is a great recipe.  I made it during the holidays for a family get-together and I was asked to bring it to another function a few weeks later.  I followed the recipe as written with only one exception.  I mix together all the dry ingredients and keep them separate from the sauce.  I don't mix everything together until 1/2 hour before serving. 

I only used what sauce I felt was needed and had some leftover both times.

Wasn't sure how this would taste, but was pleasantly surprised.  Everyone loved it, even those that weren't crazy about brocolli.  The combination is excellent.  I did substitute bacon bits for cooked bacon, less work.  This recipe will be a go to for company.

Made it absolutely as the recipe stated- delicious.  Guests asked for the recipe and gobbled up broccoli like it was candy. Does need to marinate for a while- and maybe one fewer TB's of vinegar would be fine, since there's lots of extra liquid. Thanks!

Everyone loved this, I made a double batch for thankgiving and it all went!  The recipe is spot on. I only changed one thing, even though I doubled the batch I did not have enough bacon to double that, but it still had plenty.  So maybe if you want to half the bacon it would be fine, though there'd be nothing against leaving it as is.

The overall taste of this salad is really great, but the first time I made it, I followed the recipe as stated and it was too watery.  I think 6 tbsp. of vinegar is too much.  I reduced to 4, and I also substituted fat free sour cream for some of the mayo and I liked it a lot better.  I used "real" bacon bits from Costco instead of sliced bacon.

This is a very good recipe.  As written, it's definitely 4 stars but I don't care for green onions so I use chopped red onion instead.  I've been looking for a good recipe for this so thanks very much!

Enjoyed the flavor!  I also substituted craisins for the raisins.  The red wine vinegar adds so much flavor!

I lost my old recipe. I was so happy to find it here! Don't let the others fool ya this is it!. If you are a Costco shopper...pick up dried cranberries and sliced almonds, it will save you in the long run when you are making for many people!

This salad is very good. I am not a fan of raisns, so Instead of raisns I use dried cranberries and I also add almonds. Everyone likes this salad I take it to all potlucks.

YUMMY! This is an excellent recipe and very easy to make. I use red onion instead of green onion. I have also substituted "Real Bacon Pieces" (by Hormel) in place of freshly cooked bacon. Less mess and still tasty.

This salad was great!!! I added some culiflowers and they came out really good. I just bought a bag of pre-cut broccoli and culiflowers.  I like to get things done fast!!!  I also bought a deli bag of cooked bacon pieces and put those in the salad.  Pretty fast!!!!

The classic. Always great.  Don't change a thing and you will enjoy this anytime throughout the year.  Especially best in the summer paired with grilled fare.

Very good - I scaled the recipe back to 4 servings, and used 1T less of the red wine vinegar.  I would do the same for a larger batch.  It's perfect.

Mmmm, this is such a nice summer recipe. I had it once before at a potluck with shredded cheese in it, so I added about 2/3 C to it. Overall, I used more broccoli and less bacon and sugar. Using all the sugar called for would have made it much too sweet for my taste. You can also substitute toasted walnuts in the place of sunflower seeds. I love the crunchy texture of this salad! Everyone was gobbling it up!

I used regular purple raisins because I like the color.  It tasted awesome!!  Everyone loves this salad.  Be sure to mix well before serving, as all the dressing wants to settle at the bottom.  Also, add sunflower seeds just before serving to maintain their crunchy texture.

Good recipe!  I replaced the raisins with dried cranberries, blanched the broccoli beforehand to make the color prettier and added more broccoli.  Next time I may try subbing some of the mayo with yogurt to make it healthier.

I made this salad for a potluck for my husband's Christmas party for his division.  It was a hit.  I added more broccoli than suggested because it seemed a little too moist.  The sunflower seeds add a nice crunch!  Costco has a salad like this that you just add ingredients and stir...but mine was even better from scratch!  Will make again and again!

I have had more compliments on this recipe than any other. I always take it to a get together and everyone wants the recipe! I do use only 3.5 tbls of the red wine vinegar and use dried cranberries...so delicious! I made it this week with a variation--broccoli slaw in a package...it was great too!

I am not a broccoli-salad eater, but I love this recipe.  A user below asked what would be good with using this as a side...us gals at work here eat it with rotisserie-style chicken and fresh bread to try to keep it as healthy and lite for spring/summer as possible.  We try to cook/buy chicken that is not heavy flavored, as the mellow chicken compliments all the flavors going on in the salad instead of competing with it.  Excellent potluck and lunch food!

This salad is so good!!! It is one of my absolute favorites.  I can't get enough of it!!  One of the girls here at work adds cauliflower to it too. I have used both the cooked bacon and the ready to use bacon (both good)- bacon bits of any kind change the overall flavor (not good!) Have tried other versions but this is the best!!
