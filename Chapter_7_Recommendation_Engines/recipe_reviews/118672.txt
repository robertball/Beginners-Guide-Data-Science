This was pretty good. Different than my regular quesadillas with the addition of the apple. I also added some crumbled bacon to the mix and it was really tasty. I was a little skeptical about the apples with the corn and salsa and sour cream, but it worked well. When I make it again, I will definitely chop the apples to make the mixture more uniform so that the ingredients get more evenly distributed in the quesadilla. As for baking vs. frying, I didn't notice much of a difference flavorwise because I use cooking spray in the skillet anyway. I did notice that this takes me a lot longer to cook because of the baking time (twice as long as usual was still under 15 minutes, but when you're hungry it seems like forever). Next time I think I will just make it on the stove. Cilantro would probably be a nice addition.

WOW!  To my complete surprise, my whole family loved these.  They had no idea the apple was in it and loved it even more when they found out.  It's a great way to hide a bunch of "good-for-you" things in melted cheese.  
I used shredded 2% Mexican cheese, finely chopped red onion (carmelized for a few minutes) and black beans along with the tomatoes and corn.  Served with guac and chips, this was a filling meal.  YUM!

We enjoyed the recipe. We had leftover filling and we used that the next day to make omelets.  I took others advice and diced the apples and added a lot more cheese.  I used a tortilla on bottom and one on top then cut them into 4 pieces. We had the chicken falling out from everywhere so from now on I will definitely use the folded tortilla method because it holds the filling in a lot better while you eat it.

I was really anxious to try these out on my family they sounded so good but we were all very disappointed.  We'll be sticking to the regular quesadillas.

HHHHMMMMM, they were OK...don't think I'll do em this way again, though.  The apples were just "there" in the mix, didn't really have a purpose...this foreign stuff that you couldn't tell what it was, and a bit bland, at that.  GREAT concept, though!!

This is good but it needs some other seasoning besides salt.  Garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne maybe?  Very fresh tasting though and for those of you having problems with your apple slices just wait till the end and add the slices all over the top of the mix.   Worked great for me.  Nice, tasty recipe ;)

Good, but not great.  The proportions for apple to the rest of the filling was a little off to me. Also, the apples should be diced otherwise they are awkward to eat with everything else being so much smaller.  Eat them all up after you make them because they are terrible the next day.

I first made this for a family potluck and everyone asked for the recipe!  I always peal and dice the apples.  I make it for my family ever few months and it is always great.  When I'm in a hurry, I just use salsa instead of chopping everything up.  But I prefer the flavor and taste when I chop everything up instead of using the salsa.

I thought these were awesome, exactly as written.  The apples really helped to create a unique flavor and they came out nice and brown and crispy.  My husband loved them.  We will definitely be adding this to our recipe collection:)  Thanks

Loved all the flavors!  Used more cheese than it called for and fried it on the stove instead of baking.

Amazing recipe! I made this for my family for a special occassion and they loved it! the only problem I had was getting the tortilla to stay folded when I put it in the oven, and keeping the insides inside when i flipped them over. Otherwise, great recipe!

I made this for my family.  They all liked it.  Even my 5 yr old daughter who I swear is the pickiest eater.  My husband and I agree that it would be better with seasoned chicken, more cheese and next time we will only use 1 apple.

I LOVE the recipe!  I make it every time I have guests and they always rave about it.  Its a huge hit! I never really measure the cheese and I just use whatever is in the fridge, if I have both cheddar and mozzarella then great, but if not it still turns out delicious!

I didn't make these as written so I don't know that I can rate it as such, but I only made two changes and really liked it.  Instead of tortillas I used crescent roll dough to make them into turnovers instead of quesadillas.  I needed 3 cans of dough; unrolled them to make 12 rectangles.  Flattened them out, but a scoop of mixture on half, folded them over and then sealed them with the tines of a fork.  Sprayed the tops of each with olive oil spray and sprinkled with sesame seeds.  They came out perfectlly baked at 350 degrees for about 18 minutes.  Part way through making them I got the idea that they might be even better with bbq sauce, so I put in 1/4-1/3 cup, just enough to incorpate with the other ingredients, not make it saucy.    I ate one of each and like them better with the bbq sauce.  My husband ate two, my five-year old wouldn't touch them, but my three-year old ate half of one.    I rated them a 4 out of 5 simply because they're a little different and might not suit many tastes, but I think I'll make them again myself.

This was a great dish.  Really easy to make.  Another easy dorm meal.  I used a toaster oven to bake them and I think my only issues was that I could only make one at a time.  I used a little more cheese than it called for and substituted half a red onion for the regular onion.  It was wonderful.  I will definatly make these again!

I followed the suggestion of someone else and chopped up the apples. It was so yummy! My husband really liked them and they were really easy to make. The combination was surprisingly delicious! I will definitely make this again! Its a keeper.

I made these last night and my family loved them.  They make a lot so I'm going to use them as an appetizer for my next get together.  I did double the cheese based on other reviews just because I know we love cheese.  I think one apple would be sufficient as well.  I diced them up and the apple really added to the flavor.  This is going into the menu rotation.  Thanks for sharing it!

I only  gave this 4 stars as for me it was too bland.  The apples blend very nicely and were a nice surprise.  I added about 1/8 tsp of cumin and chili powder.  I will make again and increase this to at least 1/4 tsp each.  I was out of salsa and just served with sour cream and that was perfect.

i made two different versions of this with the same batch of filling - 1 batch in the cresent rolls to make them turnover style as suggested by another reviewer and the 2nd batch as normal with the tortillas.  both were delicious but the tortilla version was WAY easier to put together.

Good recipe, thanks! Instead of using raw onion, I cooked some in a little olive oil and then added a dash of apple cider vinegar and a dash of sugar to the onions. Yumm!

I can't cook to save my life, and I made these for my boyfriend's family Christmas gathering last year.  Everyone LOVED them!  And if I can pull it off, anyone can!  People were even excited about using the leftovers the next day!  

This recipe makes a LOT!  I made 2 fully stacked plates of quesadillas, and still had more of the mixture left over to use the next day!  

It's quick, easy, and delicious!

Great quesadillas.  I mixed a golden delicious apple with a granny smith to get a little sweet in.  Next time I will take the suggestion of another rater and add fresh cilantro.  A bit of lime wouldn't hurt either.  I used the left-over filling to make grilled sandwiches the next day for lunch.

Both myself and guest did not like this recipe at all.  Ingredients did not work well together.

These were a great change for dinner.  Used only 1 apple and thought it was plenty - to save time, I simply boiled my chicken breast and then seasoned before adding to the quesadilla.

They came out a little  messy instead of crispy, but oh-so-delicious! I added a little extra garlic and some cilantro. Also, next time I will try chopping the apples so there's more in every bite (instead of slicing).

I make this at least once every other week. My family loves it! I have made this for guests quite a few times and everyone wants seconds. Simple and tasty...I cook exactly as recipe reads.

Like other reviewers, I made this by spreading the filling on a large flour tortilla, then laying another on top. The only other changes I made were to up the cheese a bit, and add some fresh cilantro to the mix. I definitely recommend chopping up the apples so they blend in with everything. Not bad at all. Thanks, Stacia!

This was pretty good.  All the guys in my house liked it.  I did not bake them, just cooked them in the frying pan as I always do.  Really did not see the need to put them in the oven and dirty another pan.  Subbed green onions for white.  Apples were a very good and interesting addition.

These are fantastic - great flavor combinations, and easy to make!  I finely chopped the apples too.  And I used two small tortillas for each quesadilla - one on the bottom, then added filling, and one on the top (instead of folding in half).  This is a keeper!

I was really suprised by this recipe, it sounds kinda strange but came out really good. I had some apples that I needed to use up and didn't want to make a dessert or anything sweet, this was great. I didn't have any fresh tomatos on hand so I just drained some canned diced tomatoes and only had chedder cheese at home. It worked out well

Tasty, but the stuffing didn't like to stay inside the tortillas.  I think the cheese wasn't sticky enough to keep in the chicken.  Maybe I just need more experience with it.

really good. don't try substituting mild apples. granny smith makes a stronger flavor. add a little cilantro and lime juice and they can't be beat.

I would cut the onion amount in half. A little too strong for all those flavors. But overall a great quick meal!!

It was good but...it would make a better appetizer than main course.  We had it as a main course and the apple made it a bit too sweet for dinner.  I would make it again - cut it into 4 wedges and serve before dinner.  I would also serve as an afternoon snack.  We liked the apple/cheese pairing, I think I'll try cilantro as someone else suggested.  We had enough filling for 7 tortillas.

We enjoyed this.  I liked the apples and chicken together.  I did not use the tomato, corn, and onion separately - I just put 1 cup of salsa in there!  Call me lazy!  Next time I'll use a full cup of each kind of cheese, but otherwise it was great.  I like that you bake these instead of fry them.
