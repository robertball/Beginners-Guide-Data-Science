This is good. I doubled the recipe because I had larger steaks. I did not double the peppercorns though, because I felt it would be too much and I was right. If you really love spicy, keep it the same, if you like it the way I do, cut it in half. The sauce could also use some salt. I like my sauce thicker, so I added a tiny bit of cornstarch. Came out nice. Thanks!
