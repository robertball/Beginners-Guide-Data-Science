Pretty tasty stuff. I did my own thing with it though. While browning the  beef I seasoned it with onion powder, garlic powder, freshly ground black pepper, and a smidge of salt. I chopped up one small onion, and after draining the beef I mixed the beef, cream of mushroom soup, and chopped onions together and let them simmer a bit. Then poured the mixture into a 10x10 casserole dish. I added sharp cheddar. Then put the tots on, then added triple cheddar shredded cheese on top of the tots. My family loved it including my 2 year old who typically doesn't eat beef!

This popped up this a.m. and remiinded me of how long it's been since I'd fixed this quick & delicious casserole.  Versatile...turkey, beef, pork, lamb meats, tomato or cream based soups work, add a layer of grean beans, carrots or corn and you have a complete meal.  Vary the spices & it's a new casserole each time you make it.   Thanks barryzimm for bringing back one of our faves.

I love this recipie. My family has used it for years. It is something thay you can even make the day before and put in your fridge. I do add a few things though, after i brown my hamburger I add fresh or canned mushrooms as well as some frozen vegetables. You can add what ever you want. I usually add corn and peas. I also put some cheese under the tatertots and a little on top of the tater tots. This allows them to get crispy.

I run a kitchen in a nursing home. We made this recipe this week for our residents. It was such a hit everyone came back for seconds and thirds!!!! Staff and family members had me print the recipe so they could make it home. I had my cook use Lawry's instead of salt plus we cooked the burger with fresh onions, mushrooms & garlic. I'm making it for my family tonight??

I have used this recipe for years.   It was a favorite of one of the ladies in our church and always appeared at pot-lucks.   
Nick----it may not be the "nuevo cuisine" you are probably use to eating---but as a former home economist, it definitely isn't trash cooking.   Most families and kids love it and it certainly is an economical dish to prepare.  Serve it with a green salad or green veggies if the nutrition level upsets you.

My family loves when I make this simple meal. I add onion and garlic to the beef. When I am assembling it in the casserole dish, I top the beef with a layer of frozen veggies, then a little cheese before adding the tater tots.  Really is yummy.

Made this for "cheat day" on Sunday and barely took 3 bites! I thought it was horrible... I even made a few changes based on the reviews and the changes couldn't even save this dish. Saved a small amount and tried to feed it to my 16 month old, who eats just about anything. Will not make this again!

I was pondering how to twist the flavors so I experimented.  Instead of Beef I used 3 cups of leftover turkey (cubed) and replaced the can of soup with a cup and a half of turkey gravy and a HALF can of soup.  I added a little extra flour to thicken it up a bit.  Because of the flavor in my homemade gravy, I didn't need any onion but add it to taste.  I poured the mixture into a casserole dish as usual and sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese to lightly cover it then added a drained 10 oz can (roughly) of French green beans.  I usually use a few extra Tots to help with texture.  I finished with crumbled Sausage stuffing left over from Thanksgiving as well.  Season Salt and Black pepper and into the oven for 40 minutes exact @ 350.   It is an incredible journey into the holidays any time of year.  

Gravy tips--  Sauté some onions and celery in a stick of butter and cook off 2 cans of veg broth with cut up dark meat and the skin (for flavor and fat content to thicken)  After it simmers and takes on the flavor of the cooked bird, strain solids into a colander and Robot Coupe/Food Processor the mixture and add back to the cooked off broth for more flavor and texture.  Thicken to your liking!!

Really good comfort food.  I browned some onions with the ground beef (used ground chuck) and added garlic powder.  Used low fat mushroom soup.  Forgot to put in the cheese and my husband told me afterward that he never liked this with cheese when I made it before.  Happy accident.  Will make this again with these changes.

I made this and we all liked it, but there was something missing to us Soni made it again. This time I added a chopped up onion and about 2 tbsp of garlic and used sharp cheddar. It was much more our taste.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

the meat mixture had zero flavor so the second time I made this I just made my shepherd's  pie recipe and put the tots on top of that instead of mashed potatoes . ... much much better  than this bland recipe  that my kids just smothered  in ketchup  for some flavour!!

I have made this recipe 3x now and I found a way that I like it. First time, followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding 4 eggs and baking the tater tots 10 minutes before adding them. The result was good but I knew this recipe could be even better. Second time, I wanted to increase the flavor profile so I added a layer of sauteed vegetables: diced onions, peppers, mushrooms and zucchini but goofed by using turkey sausage. What I learned is that this tastes best with more salt and fat. Thus, the third time I made this I used regular pork sausage, a variety of veges (listed above) and more cheese. I built it like a lasagna: first layer sausage, than a little cheese, sauteed veges, a little more cheese, the tater tots, a little more cheese and finally poured in the egg mixture. And yes, of course, topped with a little more cheese. I baked it for 45 minutes and it came out perfect. Sorry, don't know how much cheese I used but my family readily ate it.

So I have eight kids and I suppose my issue with meals are always, is it going to be enough? Will they be full enough? Oh geez and on top of TIME constraints! I mean, it's hectic! This meal definitely did the job! I of course have to make a lot more than what the recipe above gives, but having leftovers for the kids, lunch time is made easy! My kids absolutely LOVE this meal and it's VERY GOOD! And my husband and I are "3 course meals" type of people and LOVE our steak and chicken breast and such, THIS IS A WINNER....ALL DAY LONG!If you're a family who likes less cleanup and easy/quick assembly....this is your meal!!

This was good, if a little bland. If I make it again I'll do so with tomato soup as the other reviewer suggested, or ketchup or something. I also thought it was too shallow, so I'd double the filling or use a smaller dish.

Very good 'on a budget' meal. added some sauteed onion, and used Lawry's seasoning salt and black pepper. Mixed some of the cheese in with the ground beef, put the rest on top and then added tater tots.Was done in 35 minutes, tater tots were crisp. Would definitely make again.

When I make it I will make as directed except I do not put cheese on before going in the oven. I also add a spinkle of salt on top of the tator tots. I put in the oven for 30 minutes pull out and sprinkle cheese on top and bake for another 15 minutes. This will make the tator tots crispy. Adding the cheese at the beginning I found the tots soggy

I loved the ease of this recipe and how fast it came together and cooked. I didn't have cream of mushroom on hand so I just removed my beef (seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and italian seasonings) after browning it, added equal parts butter and flour, added beef stock and made my own little sauce. Once I added the beef back to the pan, the mixture thickened up nicely. I kept the cheese underneath the tator tots and it turned out great.  My kids, whom have been known to be picky eaters, both had seconds. Definitely a new addition to our family menu!

This is a classic! My Mom taught it to me before I went off to college. Sophomore year I lived in a house with 4 other guys, each would cook dinner one day a week. I  cooked this the first week and thereafter my room mates would demand it when it was my turn to cook. We ate it once a week for an entire school year and never tired of it. Crumbled potato chips as a garnish on top before serving is a nice touch.

I made this dish tonight and it was amazing. I am vegetarian and replaced the ground beef with Morningstar Crumblers. The flavor was amazing, my meat-eating boyfriend was very happy and impressed!

I doubled everything but instead of 2 cans of mushroom soup I substituted a can of cheddar cheese soup and added a can of corn (drained). Top servings with Mexican hot sauce.

Very simple & flexible recipe. Many substitutions can be made to use up what you have in the pantry, or leftovers 
I used cubed rotisserie chicken, a bag of frozen potatoes obrian, 2 cans of cream of mushroom, & mozzarella.

I saw this recipe and thought "easy but bland". I added leftover black bean dip, onions, green pepper, and other stuff....easy peasy. Now I know this can be my go-to recipe when I have a bit of leftovers and need to use it up; 'cause everything goes with meat and tater tots!!!!

Love this recipe! I did make a few alterations though. I added one packet of onion soup mix to the ground beef and I also added cheese under the potatoes as well. I served this with a side salad and garlic bread, fabulous meal!

Family Favorite. If you want to make it gluten-free use Progresso cream of mushroom soup. Progresso vegetable based soup is gluten free where Campbell's Soup  is not.

Used cream of chicken in place of mushroom. Added dried onion flakes but will use real onion next time. My baking dish was a little big. Solid 4 stars, a more flavored beef mix would kick it up to a 5.

My family loves this! I always forget how long to cook it so i have to look it up again occassionally and i found this recipe. I ALWAYS  flavor my meat as i cook with garlic, onions, or maybe even steak seasoning depending on my mood. Then i also add green chilis and ive been known to add  little velveeta cubes into the meat mixture a time or two before covering with the tots.  I am definatly going to try some of these variations y'all have mentioned because this is definantly something we have at least twice a month if not more:) thanks y'all!!

This is pretty tasty! I did get a bit liberal with the garlic salt when seasoning the meat, and I wish I'd mixed some sort of veggie in with it, but all in all, this one's a "I'd make it again!" recipe. :)

Very good but using a 9x13 is the wrong size as 1lb of beef did not even cover the full bottom.

It was very tasty, nonetheless when we put it into a smaller dish, however.

Great base recipe. I followed other reviewers advice and seasoned hamburger, added garlic and onion and corn. Mixed cheese with the cream of mushroom soup mix as well as on top. You can do anything to this recipe to personalize.

I don't care for mushroom soup, so I used cream of onion.  I like it in my casseroles, as I usually don't have to do the extra step of chopping onion.  BJ

Added salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, onions and green peppers.  Could have more cream of mushroom soup and next time we will use hash crowns instead of tater tots.  Pretty good overall.

This is a good basic casserole.  It's easy to put together, filling and fairly inexpensive.  It's tasty the way it's written, but even better if you add your own flavor profiles. 

I have made it several times and adapted it to what we had on had.  For example...

Add to the ground beef
1 package taco seasoning (or make your own like I do)
1 package dry ranch mix.

Replace the cheddar with Mexican cheese blend and top with black olives, minced onion and cilantro (I hate cilantro so I leave it off my portion)

Serve with sour cream and salsa.

I have also used chicken, black beans and even made a turkey version on time.

Teaching my daughter how to cook, she loved making it, it was so simple.  The only thing different I do,(and only because my family is Mexican and love spicy food) I add some juice from the canned jalapeño peppers, to the mixture.  My family loves!

I made this tonight in a cast iron skillet I like to do the one pot method when I can with 2 small kids. I added some onion and garlic as well as some herbs and spices per some bland reviews. I also added a bit of mustard and ketchup with worchishire sauce. I put the cheese under the tots and put in oven for 30 mins. My 18 month old is eating it now..I also made a green salad and some raw veggies for a healthy side dish...great kid friendly dish

My family loves this meal. I saute some onions and throw in a small package of frozen green beans or spinach and it's a hit! I have also used what other ground meat is on hand, turkey or chicken, and other "cream of" soups and it is great.

It was very good, not great. I recommend it just because of its simplicity and that it is easy on the budget. I will continue to use this recipe.

It said to add anything I wanted so I did. Added can of pinto beans, green beans, taco seasoning and corn of course, it made a lot. Put cheese over all and topped with the tots. Pretty darn good

This is a great , simple recipe. It is one of my grandchildren favorite. Now whe. They spend the night this is what they want.
I have experimented and made a few changes. I find that if I bake the tator tots  for about 15 in a 425 oven it changes the texture and taste of the final product. (I bake them while I am making the sauce so there is no real change in the cooking time.)
 I also season the beef with onions, bell peppers, garlic and salt and pepper. After the beef is cooked I drain in then add the soup and a can of Rico cheddar cheese, and a bit of milk. I heat it through then pour a layer of this sauce in the bottom of my casserole dish, add the tator tots and top with the rest of the sauce and shredded cheddar cheese.  Delicious!

I cooked this for my family tonight and they loved it!! I put my own swag in it though. I seasoned the ground beef with Tony Chachere’s, cayenne pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and parsley. I used cream of chicken and mushroom soup and added Colby and Monterey Jack cheeses to the mixture before adding the tots and then cooked for 40 min so that the tots were crispy. Then I topped it off with some more of my cheese blend and baked for another 15 min. Delicious!!

Very simple, extremely easy to make. Was quite surprised the family liked it so much! It's good comfort food on a budget when you have little time to prep or plan. I added some lightly cooked broccoli, some Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning for a little extra spice, and some garlic salt for added flavour. Would make again, not all the time, but definitely when in a pinch.

This is a favorite in our household.  One minor tweak: I added about half a tablespoon of dried minced onion, added to the soup, and allowed to simmer a bit to soften up.

This recipe is super easy to follow and my kids love it. It is lacking seasoning with just using salt and pepper. So I always add a packet of Onion soup mix and half a cup of milk. It gives it the perfect seasoning!

Two things: 
1. There is not nearly enough beef mixture to cover the bottom of the pan. You have to spread it as thin as possible just to get the whole pan "coated" with it, basically. I definitely recommend at least doubling the meat or both the meat and soup.
2. This is a good base recipe, but it will be very, very bland if you don't fix it up a little. I added lots of garlic powder and onions to the mix, and then more garlic on top of the tots, along with seasoned pepper. You may also want to crisp up the tots (unless you like them "dry"), by spraying them with cooking spray and baking without the cheese for a while, to get 'em crunchy. Then add the cheese towards the end of the cooking time.

Perfect for picky kids! I grew up with this old stand by, and still love it! It will always be my comfort food! My Mom used condensed chicken soup and a can of peas. I will try the cheese next time.

My whole family loved this! My husband even took leftovers to work for lunch, which is a big thumbs up for him. Next time I will sprinkle cheddar on top. The pictures showed this but the recipe did not. Great recipe!

This was sooo good! I did add cheddar cheese, mozzarella cheese and 1/2 block of cream cheese to the mixture. I also added a can of golden mushroom and cheese to the very top. We ?? cheese! It turned out really well.

I doubled the recipe and used a round casserole dish. It was what I expected cheesy and flavorful. I cut a small onion and sautéed in butter which I added to the meat mixture. Next time I will use the large sheet pan as it looks much better. Maybe try half cream of mushroom and half cream of celery soup.

Definitely make it again! My family loved it, even my 4 yo who is the pickiest ever! I added garlic powder while browning meat, didn’t have cream of mushroom so I used cream of chicken instead (large can). Mixed in a scoop full of shredded cheddar cheese to the meat mixture while hot.  Used more than 1 layer of tater tots and topped it with more cheese! Yummy

This is the 2nd time I’ve made this recipe and it is delicious, easy and quick. I was trying to make it go a little further so I added a 2nd can of soup and a can of drained corn. But the original recipe is just perfect. This is the only Tater Tot Casserole recipe I will ever use.

Something the whole family loves... even the picky eaters. I add a bag of frozen mixed vegetables, milk & double the recipe to make 2 casseroles. A splash of Worcestershire sauce and/ or onion, sour cream, poblano pepper will add flavor and mix it up a bit. Experiment with additions your family likes but keep the seasoning SIMPLE.

This was a huge hit for my family. An entire dish was gone by the end of the night, which never happens. I made a few small changes. I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder. After adding the mushroom soup it tasted slightly salty. To break up the saltiness I added a small bag of frozen corn and mixed it into the beef mixture. Everything else I did per the recipe and it turned out delicious. I will definitely make it again.

This was super easy but pretty bland. My teenage son liked it but my husband and I thought it was just average. We ended up squeezing ketchup on it trying to improve the taste. It was quick and easy...but just ehh.

I made it in my #8 cast iron skillet. Added 1/2 of a sweet onion to the beef after draining. Cooked beef a little longer with soup added. Topped with tots and cheese in same pan. 375 oven for about 45-50 min. Could have left 1 hour. Top would have been crisper.

This was a great quick Sunday meal. 
I added 1 lbs ground beef with 1 lbs pork sausage. (I found it was too much meat so I cut it in half and froze some of the meat for another day).
Instead of cheddar cheese we did pepper jack. 
35 mins in the oven was just perfect. 
And finally topped it off with some Tabasco sauce. 
Definitely making again!

Excellent and very easy.  Have made this several times.  Had a vegetarian come over for dinner and I substituted the ground beef for 2 cans of black beans.  I drained one can.  Followed directions as written and it came out delicious!!

I used ham instead of ground beef, because I had ham.   I also sauteed an onion,  added along with the  ham at the bottom.  Insanely good for a 5 item entree.  Nuked it in the microwave so it was already hot, before adding  cheese and 15-20 minutes in the oven.

We love this but add either green beans or peas to it. I prefer peas. Also we add half a cup of onions with the brown burger, garlic pepper instead of salt. It doesn’t need any extra salt. Especially with a healthy squirt of Lucky fish sauce.

This was just okay. Tater tots weren't very crispy.  Needed more meat and flavor. I think meat should be nearly doubled. Cooked for 45 min at 350 F, but tater tots were still way too soft on the outside. Next time I will either put the cheese on in the final 10 minute stretch or put it add it over the meat and under the tots so that way the they can get crispy.

Both me and my kids loved this recipe,  it was very simple,  quick,  and fulfilling. I’ve made this about 3 times now and it gets better every time.  This time I layered the bottom with tater tots and cooked them for 15 minutes. Then I took them out and poured my hamburger meat on top , I added a few sprinkles of cheese then tater tots on top and let it cook for about 40 minutes. After it was done I layered cheese on top.

Was very delicious and not plain.
I used a lb of ground chicken added some garlic and Italian seasoning  and diced onions and a tiny bit of chicken stock. Then mixed in almost two cans of cream of chicken into it put cheese on top than tator tots then more cheese. I was expecting it to be bland like other reviewers mentioned. No it wasnt at all. Very good, we all loved it!

This was pretty good and so easy to make. My husband is a meat and potatoes guy and this was right up his alley. I did add sautéed onions and garlic and also added some Nature's Seasoning because I think it would have been too bland without it. Will definitely make this again.

It was delicious, but only 4 stars b/c I made changes. I added an onion soup packet to the meat. I layered it meat, shredded celery, shredded potatoes, cream of mushroom soup + 1/2 can milk whisked together, then cheese on top. Flavorful. Delicious.

the family loves this!  I usually sautee up a 1/2 chopped onion.  1 tablespoon of worstershire, and a green veggie like frozen peas or green beans.  Sometimes I crush up 2 or 3 slices of bacon and add to it.  So many ways to go on this one!

I usually mix in 1 cup frozen peas with the ground beef and soup. i put the cheese under the tator tots so the tots can get crispy. i also broil them for a couple miniyes for extra crispness. Lastly, I add jalepenos to the cheese layer. my family loves this recipe.

I give this recipe itself 4 Stars.  once I put in a few additions, it became a 5 Star.  first I added half an onion, chopped, to the ground beef. I also added a pinch of garlic powder.  once I mix everything together, I add a small can of whole kernel corn and a small can of peas and carrots.  once we tried it with a bag of frozen mixed veggies and we didn't like the way the green beans changed the taste.

So yummy and so simple. I make sure I get the extra crispy tater tots, add a half pack of cut up bacon,  2 cups of sharp cheddar, and 2 cups of medium cheddar. Easy, cheap, and delicious!

It was pretty good. I used a smoked bacon cheddar cheese on top of the beef and soup mix. I coved the tots with coarse shredded white cheddar. Used broiler at the end to toast and brown the cheese and tots. YUM

I used this as a base recipe like I do with most. It's very tasty and so easy to make! I added frozen green beans in the cream of mushroom soup mix and used onion flavored tater tots and French fried onions on top of the cheese, I used an 8x8 casserole dish and baked it an extra 10 minutes for extra crispiness! YUM!

I was looking for a fairly quick recipe to use the pound of ground beef I needed to cook up . As I also had some tater tots languishing in my freezer, I thought this seemed a promising basic recipe to try.  To amp up the flavor a bit, I added a chopped clove of garlic,  some dried thyme and Montreal Steak seasoning to the meat as it cooked. Still, it was pretty bland. The layers and flavors all seemed to meld together -- and not in a positive way. The tater tots topping was not crispy, despite me following some reviewers' suggestions about putting down a layer of cheese between the meat and tater tots to help them stay crispier. I'm sure that helped, but not enough.  All in all, this dish was a disappointment.

Pretty good. Cheap and easy to make.  I did  add onion to meat when browning and about 3/4 cup of mixed veg's and I used less cheese.  I prefer to mix cheese in with meat instead of on top.  But that is all preference.  This is a good basic recipe.

I double the ingredients, and add 2 cans of french cut green beans (drained) to 2 cans cream of mushroom soup. Ground beef on the bottom, beans and soup next, tots on top. Add the cheese the last 5 minutes, after the tots are brown and crispy. It a great comfort food on those -80 degree windchill nights.

IT's a good base recipe, but there is room for improvement. I added fresh chopped garlic and julienne basil at the very end of cooking the ground beef. It added a ton of extra flavor.

Needed some major help in the flavor department. I added Montreal steak seasoning and beefy onion soup to the beef. I then used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic. I also used onion flavored tatortots. Sooooo much flavor! Will definitely make again. 3 picky kids all had seconds.

I put in a teaspoon of minced garlic Worcestershire Sauce and Ketchup. Also about 2 cups of frozen mixed peppers and onions. I didn't have any cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of broccoli and it tasted great. Layered the meat mixture and topped with Mexican cheese then tater tots after it was done I topped with more cheese.

The recipe was very good, quick and easy. Instead on mushroom soup I used a can of beef gravy. I baked the tators for 10 minutes prior to adding them to the casserole. The shredded cheese (marble), I placed half the amount under the tators and the remainder over top. The gravy cheese and potatoes made it like a cross between a poutine and a sheppards pie :)

I took the advice of another reviewer and added the packet of Lipton onion soup mix. That added great flavor! I'll make it again with this twist.  I also added green beans.  My two teenage boys, who usually don't like veggies mixed in with things, liked it a lot.

I thought this was very good and my 5 year old loved it. The first time I made it exactly like the recipe. It was good, but felt like the tator tots were a bit dry on top of the casserole. The second time I made it I placed the ground meat, I used turkey, on the bottom and then placed the tater tots on top of the meat. I mixed together cream of mushroom soup with a tblsp of ketchup and a tblsp of worcestershire and poured it on top of the meat and potatoes. I then placed shredded cheese over the entire dish. This was very moist and yummy! Will definitely make again!

My family loves this recipe, but with the added veggies and ground beef spiced up a bit.  Very nice go to for cold busy days.

I made this with Ore-Ida tater tots and really enjoyed it. I added extra seasonings and a can of drained mixed veggies.

I made this last night for supper and we loved it. I added one cup of sliced celery and mixed most of the cheese with the beef mixture. I will be making this again and again.

This dinner has always been a hit in my house. I have made it worth the cream of mushroom but my kids prefer it with tomato soup. Now I usually make half with the cream of mushroom and half tomato. Its gone within minutes
