Terrific!  A little sweeter than my grandma's, but still absolutely great.  If you don't like your potato salad sweet, then I'd say cut down the sugar to 1 Tb., otherwise follow the recipe just as it is.

I've been making this "Taste of Home" recipe for several years, and find it to be the just the right amount of vegetables to salad dressing.  In the past I would throw together my potato salad with approximately the same ingredients as is in this recipe, but sometimes it was better than other times.  Following the proportions in this recipe, I find it to be always exceptionally good.  Thank for this wonderful recipe.

Made this for a birthday dinner and lunch and couldn't stop eating it.  So good.  I didn't add any sugar.

This was my first attempt at making potato salad and it was really good.  I didn't put in the radishes and put in less sugar than the recipe calls for (used about 1 Tbsp.) and it tasted great.  I also used red potatoes and left the skins on.  I love the celery in it.  Excellent recipe.

I've made this recipe 4 times now and am making it again tonight for a party tomorrow. It's definitely a keeper. Still turns out great minus the radishes and celery but looses that tasty crunch.

My daughter said it was the best I ever made and my husband even liked it (he only likes his mother's cooking or his own!).  I used relish instead of pickles and less sugar like others said.  Everthing else was the same and it was good!

This was great! It may seem a bit sweet for some what with the addition of the pickles and the sugar, but you just need to cut the sugar back if you want less sweetness. I loved the pickles in the salad. It made for a great Labor Day picnic!

This was the best potato salad. It wasnt gooey thick but still creamy. I used apple cider vinegar and that gave it a great flavor.

So good!  I didn't use radishes and I used pickle relish as I didn't have any pickle cubes on hand.  The dressing was great and the salad was even better the next day. Next time I may use a little extra dressing. Thanks for sharing.

This Potato Salad is awesome! What a great southern comfort recipe. 20 years ago I tried making potato salad and failed. Then I found this recipe and my faith has been restored. For my taste I reduced the amount of sugar. Great job!

I substituted relish for the sweet pickles and wouldn't recommend doing that...but otherwise everyone enjoyed this potato salad & I plan to make it again, this time following the recipe!

I really enjoyed this potato salad. It's a good switch from my usual one. I loved the crunch and color the radishes gave. I used dill pickles (Im not a fan of sweet) and they added a nice little zing. This recipe is great in the summer, especially when you can use fresh radishes and home made pickles!

This salad has a very refreshing taste!  My family doesn't like celery so I omit it - however I do add a bit of dill to the salad for a kick!!

Awesome!  My family loves this recipe.  The only difference between how we make it is  . . . we leave out the radishes.  Best recipe!

Excellent IF you reduce the sugar to maybe 1tb or 1 1/2 tb. Add scallions and this salad rocks! I made it many times and everyone always loves it.

I've been looking for the ultimate potatoe salad recipe for years.  This is it.  My kids had thirds.  I actually like mine sort of sweet so this was great.  I also like it chunky so I added some cubed dill pickles.  Good stuff!!

I made this receipe for Christmas for some very picky potato salad eaters. I got wonderful compliments and folks going back for seconds. My husband told me that is was even better than his mother's potato salad and not to change a thing.  I followed the advise of others and I only used 2 tbl spoons of sugar. This is an absolutely wonderful recipe!

I did not use the radishes but followed everthing else. The concensus was that it was too sweet and bland.  I ended up adding 1 tablespoon of dry mustard to kick it up a notch. Not to our taste but the previous reviewers loved it.

Great potato salad.  Was just a tad too sweet.  However, I didn't have radishes so perhaps the radishes would have offset the sugar.  I really like this recipe and highly recommend it.

Best potato salad I've ever had.  I've been using this recipe for the last year, and it's a hit at EVERY function.
