This was awesome!!!  I've been cooking asparagus in olive oil and garlic, but it has been a little too oily for me.  I followed the recipe by spraying it with olive oil spray and I sprinkled on Tony Chachere's creole seasoning.  I baked it more than 10 minutes since we like our asparagus a little on the softer side.  After about 13 minutes I put it in a small baking dish and finely grated some white sharp cheddar cheese on top.  The oven was still warm so I popped it in and melted the cheese.  It was GREAT!

Love this-Superfast is right-to make it faster-just line your baking sheet with aluminum foil. When cooked I put them in storage bags to take for lunch-they are great both warmed up or cold.

I rubbed olive oil then the cajun seasonings... Really good flavor and very fast!  Veggies are still firm and full of flavor.  Who would have thought it to be this simple and tasty!

Lovely!! I had no cajun spice so I used garlic powder and seasoning salt. I ate the whole thing myself!

Simply excellent! Who would have thought? I sprayed with a little olive oil spray, sprinkled with sea salt and roasted (along side pork tenderloins and red potatoes) for about 10 minutes.  Perfect.

Excellent, but rather than cooking spray I used olive oil. I like roasted asparagus SO much better than just steaming it - it's more flavorful and also has a real robust look to it.  This could be seasoned with any number of herbs and spices but Hubs and I really liked the Cajun seasoning - it was something I never would have thought to use with asparagus and it worked well. Ten minutes in the oven was perfect, and freed me up to tend to other things while it was roasting. I garnished it with zested lemon which was the perfect complement.  Were it not for the cooking spray called for, I would have easily rated this 5-stars.

I had to write a review for this because neither my eleven year old nor my husband really care for asparagus.  Well, they ate these up.  I did use Caribbean Jerk seasoning instead of Cajun.  Absolutely fantastic.  When an eleven year old requests asparagus again because "they tasted too good to be a vegetable"  the recipe is a keeper!  Thanks for the idea.

Great recipe!  I did add a little galic powder but I think you could probably sprinkle whatever you prefer and it would be grea!  I snapped the ends off of the asparagus and put it a large ziploc bag,poured a little oil in the bag, sprinkled my seasonings in and shook it up.  Just a little easier to get all of the ingredients mixed well.  Pour it onto the pan and you're ready to go.  Will definitely make it again, and again, and again.

We just adore this asparagus recipe, it's perfect. We don't buy Cajun seasoning, so we just use seasoning salt + cayenne pepper. It's always perfect every time - crisp and flavorful but never tough or chewy. 1 minute prep time + 10 minutes in the oven? You can't beat that!

Exactly my kind of recipe.  I used Mrs Dash Herb & Garlic instead of cajun and it was a perfect compliment to the asparagus.  

I cut the asparagus into 1 1/2-2" pieces and tossed it with 1 tsp of olive oil and a sprinkle of the Mrs Dash.  10 min in the oven and perfection!

This was a nice change of pace from regular ol' steamed asparagus.  And the cajun spice was different too.  Easy and fast, thanks!

Have fixed this before, and my husband loves it. I use Zatarain's Creole Seasoning & Olive oil spray(just sprinkle over the top of the Asparagus)then toss to coat. It always turns out perfect! Thanks for such an easy recipe!!

I'm always a fan of good microwave recipes, especially the simpler ones like this one. If you're not an admirer of wine, use some white grape juice, apple juice, or it will work with just water and maybe a splash of lemon juice. Also, don't feel bashful about adding seasonings to your taste -- like a sprinkle of garlic salt, pepper and Parmesan cheese, for instance. Also, keep in mind that the 3 minutes microwave time makes for a crunchy asparagus, so if you and your family like a softer aspargus just zap it a little longer. With the ease of the microwave, some of it can be made crunchy and some softer -- nothing could be more simple.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. It's a great jumping off point. I use a variation of this recipe at least once a week (as long as I can get fresh Asparagus). 

Here's what I do different: I don't use cooking spray, I use olive oil. I also don't use Cajun spices. I use garlic and just the tiniest bit of sea salt. It turns out delicious every time. 

Just a side note, sometimes Asparagus comes in thinner stalks, when that happens, I cut the cooking time down to half. For the thicker stalks, 15 minutes seems to be just about right.

I have never attempted asparagus prior to now, and I and my family found this to be delightful.  I did however follow the advice of other reviewers and use olive oil in place of the non-stick cooking spray.

Love this recipe as a great and quick easy asparagus dish. I do toss with a little EVO to coat the asparagus well before seasoning. Also if asparagus is thin I cook for a bit shorter than stated. My kids and husband love this! Thanks.

This is the very,very best way ever to cook asparagus.  Having said that I must add that I drizzle it with olive oil and what ever seasoning goes with the menu.

This is such a good idea and I loved how fast it was to make!  I used olive oil instead of the spray (though I'll try it that way too) and my Cajun seasoning was Messina's, which is made in New Orleans and has been my favorite seasoning since I was 10.  Unfortunately I couldn't taste the asparagus at all because I have a terrible cold, but my husband said it was really good and I believe him.  Can't wait to try it again next time asparagus is on sale (and when my taste buds are working again).

Another easy step to make something ordinary taste extraordinary!  I used olive oil spray rather than the cooking spray (as it taste much better).  Roasted about 10 minutes - perfection.  Loved it!

Quick, easy and great tasting! We were looking for something different to do with asparagus and this was a good change. Although it's not terribly creative it is tasty. Added garlic powder and cayenne to fit our tastes. Will make again.

This was good, but too oily.  I think I will use half the oil next time, as I like my asparagus a little crispy on the ends.  I also substituted seasoned salt for Cajun seasoning and it had good flavor.

this is so easy to prepare, and the result was delicious. I plan on using the technique in the future with different herbs and spices.

I made this recipe, and it was great! I used Olive Oil and cooked it a little bit longer so the tops were crispy but the rest amazingly tender and sweet!

Very good basic recipe. I like the speed in which it is made. I usually use olive oil but tried the cooking spray and used Emeril's  Cajun seasoning. The asparagrus came out great. I can see many variations of this recipe. Will definitely make again.

I made the pan fried version one night, and this oven version the next.  I much prefered this recipe.  I felt like it wasn't nearly as unhealthy and it had a perfect texture.  You can definitely play with the spices to suit your tastes.  Will keep in my recipes!

my stars are more for the process of cooking than the spices because I didn't have "cajun" seasoning. The asparagus was perfectly tender without being mushy or anything. So easy. I topped with salt and parm. cheese.

This was a big hit.   I layed the asparagus out on parchment paper in a pan, sprinkled with Old Bay and baked for 10 minutes.   I removed and sprinkled with an Italian cheese mixture and baked for an addition 3 minutes.  Excellent.  It don't get any simpler than this.

I was prepared to love this, but this recipe has a lot of heat and not much flavor. My family was quite disappointed that I made this instead of my standard butter/garlic/Parmesan asparagus. Adding grated cheese made it a bit better and saved the dish from being thrown away.

I rubbed the asparagus in coconut oil, sprinkled with minced garlic and salt, baked at 425 for 13min... DELICIOUS!  I could seriously munch on these instead of junk like potato chips.  Only 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe as written, thanks for the basics though!

Thank you for this easy recipe.  I never really liked asparagus until I started fixing it this way.  For my variation, I drizzle the asparagus with extra light tasting olive oil, and then did the cajun seasoning, sea salt, and cracked black pepper, and tossed all of that together, then dumped it onto the baking sheet.  Came out great!!!

So good and like the recipe name, super fast! I usually steam my asparagus but roasting it with cajun seasoning gave it much more flavor. I coated the spears with olive oil spray and turned the spears halfway through. Thanks for the recipe!

This is basically the same way I cook asparagus. I wouldn't use no stick spray though as I do not like the flavor. Toss in a decent Extra Virgin Olive Oil in a bowl. Lightly sprinkle sea salt and fresh ground pepper and toss again. layer on baking sheet on some parchment paper, 10-12 minutes in a 425F oven depending on size of asparagus. Money! Sometimes for added flair I will sprinkle some fresh grated Parm cheese on and put back in oven a minute.

Not bad! My hubs and I liked this a LOT! While I enjoyed the cooking method (I LOVE the simplicity of roasted veggies!), what my hubs enjoyed most was the spicy Cajun flavor. Ironically enough, I could not taste ANY spice whatsoever! I could tell our asparagus were well-seasoned, but that's about it. :) A GENEROUS dose of sea salt AND some fresh cracked pepper would have been just as good, IMHO. NOTE: DO NOT spray your asparagus with cooking spray! Instead, drizzle with EVOO (flavored is even better!) and then add a few cloves of crushed or minced garlic, a sprinkling of grated Parmesan cheese and / or a squeeze of fresh lemon juice - the possibilities are endless! Served alongside Hudson's tilapia with dill sauce, this was GREAT! Thanks for sharing, MSLILLY. :-)

Wonderful.  8 minutes for medium asparagus.  The asparagus were firm, tender and still beautifully green.

Absolutely delicious.  I used olive oil as suggested and only used half of the cajun seasoning because I don't like too strong flavorings...the family loved them.  Thanks for the recipe!

BEST Asparagus recipe ever! I bake them in olive oil (basted on) and sprinkle them with parmesan cheese or cajun or lemon pepper :) depending on my mood. My roomie loves his with sweet chili sauce on top!

I sprayed butter flavored spray and sprinkled creole seasoning and baked for 10 min....then I added 10 minced cloves of garlic and continued baking for another 10 min. I used a 400 degree setting to accommodate the oven setting i was using for a chicken pot pie, thus the longer cooking time....came out PERFECT! I ate the entire batch myself!

This was a very fast, easy way to prepare asparagus.  We were a little too "spiced out" with the cajun, so made it with season salt the next time we prepared it, and it was VERY good!

I rate this recipe as just okay. I didn't think the Cajun seasoning complemented the asparagus

This recipe was sooo simple. We don't ever eat asparagus in my family, so we were skeptic but everyone loved it! I rubbed the asparagus down with a little bit of olive oil first instead of spraying it. I will definitely make this again.

I never really liked asparagus but for some reason made this anyway, and it's really yummy!  I easily ate it all by myself though, so I definitely disagree that this is supposed to serve 3.  I used a sheet of foil so there's basically no clean up.  It's cheap and wildly easy so I'll definitely make again.

Fantastic!!!used 1 1/2 lbs london broil seasoned w/ steak seasoning.used 1 can tomato, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, but only half of the o-soup, added some canned mushrooms, red wine and one small minced onion.it took about 7 hrs in my crockpot---soooo good!!!after i took out meat, i added some cream to the gravy--because i'm german and thats what we do lol. served this with mashed potatoes as well as asparagus roasted in garlic and olive oil---this will be a staple in our house.planning on trying this w/ elk as well.

I didn't have cajun seasoning so I used a lemon pepper seasoning instead, the lemon gave a little zest and the pepper a little spice. Baking with the seasoning turned out great! Wasn't oily like sauteeing and will definately try different styles in the future! Thanks for the idea!

Thank you for a simple, yet delicious way to make asparagus. I drizzled and brushed them with EVOO. I didn't have cajun seasoning, so I used Adobe seasoning with garlic powder and pepper.

4.5 for fast and easy.  I had some premixed Cajun seasoning, garlic pepper, salt and black pepper from another recipe and I sprinkled that on it.  Yum.

Quick and easy, and the Cajun seasoning gives this side dish a special twist. Placed cut asparagus on a baking pan lined w/ parchment paper for a super fast clean-up too. Used Creole Seasoning Blend from this site. After removing from oven, garnished with grated Pecorino Romano cheese.

Great & Superfast: I lined baking sheet with foil. Then tossed cut up asparagus with extra virgin olive oil, seasoned salt and garlic powder. I cannot eat black pepper or spicy seasonings. Placed on foil and roasted. Checked at 8 minutes and was tender and crunchy. Cancer patient without a lot of energy so this recipe is fantastic.. Trying to eat more green vegetables and this will now be a weekly favorite. Kept going back for more !!!

Excellent recipe! I use light olive oil rather than the spray oil. As well, I sometimes prepare the same way only using garlic powder, salt, & sprinkle with shredded parmesan cheese the last 5 min. Delicious!

PERFECT idea!! I, too, left mine in for 15 minutes. I then turned off the oven sprinkled a bit of parmesan cheese on top before popping it back in for long enough for it to melt. Will definitely make this a regular in my kitchen!

pleae, don't prepare in this way!
they must be snap at the tender, it's correct. After you must put them in hot salted water still they are one minute from the perfect cooked time. use a fork to controll. 
In a pan put a spoon of good butter and the asparagus, with a snow of parmigiano reggiano on them.
Now they are perfectly cooked.
Sorry for my english, I'm italian.

So awesome! I never knew roasted asparagus was so easy. I was shocked that in ten minutes they were cooked, and not still crunchy. They were perfect. I used salt, instead of cajun seasoning because i have a 4 year old. A+!

I was looking for a quick and delicious way to cook some asparagus, and this was perfect. I lined a sheet with aluminum foil first and sprayed with canola oil cooking spray. I used salt (sea salt grinder) / black pepper instead of cajun seasoning (not too big on spicy foods over here), and after 10 minutes in the oven, they came out PERFECT. I will be using this idea again and again.

Absolutely delicious -- could not be easier or quicker, and yet the results are top-notch. Served it to three different guests this week, each of whom raved about it. Used Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning Mix.

This is the only way I cook asparagus now. Totally awesome, extremely easy and very fast. Just make sure that you don't overcook.

I make this at least twice a week now... Love it!!! I switch up the spices too and use a garlic spice with garlic powder and olive oil and not one stalk is left over.   Great Recipe :)

Asparagus with almost any seasoning is good, as long as the seasoning is not overdone. try it with a little Five Spice or Hoisin Sauce.

My first attempt at cooking fresh asparagus. I was pleasantly surprised. Just added a little more Cajun seasoning because the family likes it spicy and I   drizzled a little extra virgin olive oil on them before baking. Came out great, tender and very tasty.

I used Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning, and just sprinkled some on, didn't bother measuring out a teaspoon. was a great way to cook up a fast vegetable, and asparagus is popular in our house so will make it that was again.

I didn't care for these at all.  I'm not a huge fan of asparagus, but my husband is.  I used the "simple cajun seasoning" from this site, which I found pretty tasteless actually!

Good but my asparagus came out very stringy.  I'm not sure if that's the asparagus or the preparation or both.

We love asparagus, and I was looking for a quick recipe.  Read the reviews, tried this, added a tiny bit of garlic salt (Cajun seasoning has salt in it, so can't use too much), and we loved it.  I've had asparagus in really expensive restaurants that did not taste as good as this.  My husband raved about it.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I will most definitely use this recipe often!

Love it! I'm a huge fan of asparagus but this was the first time I'd cooked it myself, without it being canned or frozen. It was so super easy-- I will ALWAYS go with fresh asparagus from now on! And I used the "Simple Cajun Seasoning" recipe on this site. I recommend using that rather than buying packaged seasoning. Very glad I discovered this ridiculously easy recipe!

This was AMAZING! I made it with ocean perch, so I cooked my asparagus at 350 instead for 15 min. I also, per the other reviews used a pinch of garlic salt all over, and then lightly lightly sprinkled it with mozarella shredded cheese after it was done cooking. However, it probably didn't need it...even though it was wonderful! The cajun seasoning with the asparagus is SO good, I don't even care for asparagus and it may be a favorite now.

It feels strange to give something with two ingredients five stars, but it was so easy and tasty you wouldn't have known it was only two ingredients. My husband is a little biased against veggies, but he ate this and LIKED IT!!   Great idea.  I think I will try Cajun seasoning on other veggies too!

My husband hates asparagus, but even he admitted that this is the tastiest asparagus he's ever had! I had to cook the asparagus a bit more, took me about about 25 mins in the oven, but I prefer my asparagus a little on the softer side rather than crisp. Will definitely make again!

This is the best asparagus I have ever had, and it is super easy to make -- definitely no way to screw it up.  The only change I made was to drizzle a bit of melted butter over the top.

Tasted great! Soft, but enough substance to make the stalks fresh tasting. Used salt, pepper, Season All salt, a bit of olive oil. Easy and delicious. Pretty!

This was really good and easy! I didn’t have the miso paste, and I left out the the pepper flakes because my 8 yo would not eat them. They turned out tasty, tho, and even the picky 8 yo ate some.

It was so very good!  I made a whole cookie sheet full of asparagus and it got rave reviews for our Easter dinner!  Easy and tender, I only sprinkled some garlic in addition to the other ingredients.  We will be having this over and over again.

I didn't have any Cajun seasoning, so I just drizzled some olive oil and sprinkled some salt on the asparagus before they went in the oven. My boyfriend (who's the chef in our relationship) said the asparagus were cooked longer than they needed to be but they still turned out tasty!

This is my go-to recipe! So easy for a gourmet dish! I omit the cajun seasoning and use a bit of salt and olive oil. Once it is out of the oven I put sliced almonds and shaved parmesan cheese on top! So impressive with so little work!!!

I thought this was quite yummy!  I didn't have any Cajun seasoning so I used some Old Bay and it was delightful.  I put the asparagus in a Tupperware container, drizzled some olive oil on top, added the seasoning, and then shook it all up.  We have now added a new vegetable to our rotation.

Very easy recipe indeed. Though, it came out still chewy for my first try. I used a toaster oven so I might need to tweak the time a bit more next time. thanks for sharing!

this was pretty good.. but it was superfast as the title states.. i used Creole Seasoning Blend from this site and wish i would have gone a little heavier with the shaker.. my asparagus were on the larger side and were still pretty firm when i took them out at ten minutes.. which was fine as i hate mushy veggies.. ty for the recipe

As far as basic asparagus, this is a very easy and delicious recipe. I think next time I might add garlic or lemon or something just to make it a little more flavorful.

New to this healthy cooking stuff...cooking at all for that matter.  Bought asparagus, determined to cook it..and find a way the family likes it.  I didn't have Cajun seasoning so I found a recipe for that in Allrecipes as well.  Made it, everyone liked it...so we will have it again!

So simple and easy. Two ingredients? But don't let the small number of ingredients lead you astray. I was concerned that the Cajun seasoning may be too strong, so I didn't use much on my initial try. Next time, I'll use more seasoning. An excellent side dish, but my son had only the asparagus for supper. He said it was awesome.

I'm 5 star rating my own because this recipe I made was by far the best asparagus I've ever had. Better than Restaraunts! In zip lock bag add a bundle of asparagus and poor olive oil, sprinkle kosher salf(make sure it's kosher salt because it brings out the best flavor), sprinkle black pepper and poor about a tablespoon and a half of aged balsamic vinegar in the bag, close the bag and shake it all around. Let marinate for about 2 hours. Cook for 9 minutes at 475 degrees!

I made this with some chicken cordon bleu. My family devoured it. And it was super easy to throw in after the chicken came out of the oven and just wait 10 minutes.

Really good, super fast. Don't add any salt since the Cajun seasoning already has a bunch. Don't add the Cajun seasoning while the asparagus is sitting in a baking sheet in the hot oven it rises up and gets in your eyes.

This was pretty good...go light on the oil. I used a shake of garlic and onion powder in addition to the Cajun seasoning plus some parmesan cheese. We will make this again.

I drizzle the stalks with olive oil instead of cooking spray and am quite liberal with the cajun seasoning. My husband, who dislikes vegetables, asks for this recipe!

This is almost too easy!  I was a little afraid of the cajun seasoning since I was serving it to guests so I went with a little seasoned salt and a little cajun seasoning.  It was great.  Even my non-cooking friend asked for the recipe because she thought even she could handle it.  Using the foil in the pan and the spray olive oil makes it even easier but it looks like something special.

I used olive oil and lemon pepper and it turned out great.  I think you can use any seasoning.  Will try the cajun seasoning in the future.

Funny that this was the first time making asparagus. I misread Cajun spice for cayenne powder so I used cayenne and it turned out great, especially since I served it with salmon patties with cayenne (I don't know if I'm spelling that right). It's very good with the lemon sauce from this site as well. Great simple recipe. Needs not exceed 10 mins.

I have made this many times, however, all I use is olive oil , salt and pepper. The cajun  takes away some of the asparagus taste. Besides, not everyone likes cajun. IF any is left, I scramble a couple of eggs and make an omelet.  Wow, is that good.

Wonderful idea but the cajun seasoning did overpower the asparagus as another suggested.  The next time i used garlic powder, drizzled with bacon grease from bacon cooked that morning and I also cooked them a little longer.  I will always cook my asparagus this way from now on.  Thanks!

This turned out great!!  I used my own seasonings (garlic blend, salt & pepper), and was SO pleased!  I love asparagus, and have never been able to cook it well, no matter what method I tried.  This turned out PERFECT!!

Superfast and superspicy!  I think I used too much seasoning as I didn't adjust for having less asparagus.  Still like it though, great idea, thanks!
