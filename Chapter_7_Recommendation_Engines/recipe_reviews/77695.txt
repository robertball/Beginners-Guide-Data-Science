Yum… definitely chocolate milk for grown-ups! I took the lazy route and used 1/2 c chocolate milk (versus regular milk plus chocolate syrup.) ‘Dirty Bedtime Story’ is my new favorite! Thanks for the great recipe!

I warmed this up on the stove until it was almost boiling. Very nice. Made me feel warm all over.

I had a party last saturday night and at some point yelled out "who's ready for a dirty bedtime story?" and got everyone excited to try this drink! If you are a fan of white russians you may enjoy this. I had some irish cream i wanted to use up and found this recipe. I made this exactly as written using Hershey's chocolate syrup in the first round and then tried this gourmet chocolate sauce i had. Very good!

I wanted to use some of my amaretto because I had two bottles of it, but didn't feel like baking with it. This nightcap hit the spot. It is a tad too sweet for me, so I would make it again with less amaretto, or more milk, or (yummy) coffee instead of milk.

Wow!  This was delicious!  I did make one small change - I subbed the milk with soy creamer.  We used this in a cup of very strong coffee as a creamer.  We used half of the recipe in each mug and filled the rest with the coffee.  It was awesome!  I am already planning out other flavor combinations. This was really nice on a snowy evening.

I'm glad I only made one serving of this for Hubs and me to share.  It tasted ok I guess, but a little goes a looong way as it really was too sweet for us. Much better poured over ice. If I was to make this again I'd go a lot lighter on both liqueurs.

Yummy! I was out of amaretto, but I mixed about 3/4 cup of milk and 2 TBS Hershey's syrup. I heated it in the microwave for about a minute and then added about 1/3 cup of my Original Irish Cream (from this website). Very decadent! Next time (probably tomorrow after trick-or-treating), I'll try adding some praline liqueur that I have. Thanks for sharing a yummy and boozy treat, Galatea!

Dad & I've made these and variations of for years. Blended w/ ice in summer & warmed in winter, tasty either way. For a real kick add some spiced rum! 2 shots of liqueur per drink is a bit wimpy for us.

Used chocolate milk instead of white milk as another reviewer had suggested.  What a great little drink.  I will be making this and consuming this again! :)

What a great drink! I probably used closer to 3/4 of a cup of milk (enough to fill up the glass) and served with ice. If you like sweet drinks, this is for you.

Made it with chocolate milk instead of milk and syrup.  Next time, would reduce the amount of amaretto.  Too strong for my liking.

After reading some of the reviews, I did not want this to turn out too sweet. To fix that, I used 3/4 cup of milk and only half of the Ameretto. The extra milk filled my mug better, and the sweetness was just right. I did heat this up, and it turned out very soothing and delicious! Thanks!

Just like the chocolate martinin I had at Firebirds. Super easy and good.
