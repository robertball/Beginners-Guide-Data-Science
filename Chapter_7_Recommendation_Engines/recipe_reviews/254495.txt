I really liked this but only because I cut the amount of honey in half.  It was still pretty sweet.  Love the idea for a summer lunch maybe with a tuna or chicken salad croissant.

7.20.16   Thoroughly enjoyed this for lunch today.  I followed the instructions but really didn’t measure anything.  However, I know that I cut back on honey, since we’re not into things too sweet these days.   The mild seasoned rice vinegar was a good choice because it didn’t overpower the other ingredients.  Nice contrast between the salty feta cheese and the sweet honey, accented by the flavor of fresh basil.

This is my new favorite for a pot luck or family party, it was super easy and looked beautiful! I did substitute spinach for the basil and cherry tomatoes, about 1/2 of the honey but otherwise made as directed. Delish! Also it lasted 2 days in the fridge without compromising the integrity of the salad.

I've always loved tomato, cucumber, onion, basil, oregano salad.  The only new ingredients were the feta and honey.  I, too, used a little less than half/cup.

7.4.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/254495/herb-n-honey-cucumber-tomato-salad/ ... As others, I reduced honey by half.  Slight sweetness was an aftertaste.   It isn't too sweet, but I'd rather have less or no honey.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I really really really liked this! Hubs thought it was too sweet! I will probably cut the honey back a bit next time, just to please him. We served this on top of a wedge of iceberg lettuce, and it made for one tasty salad! It will be my lunch tomorrow too. Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely delicious ! I used cherry tomatoes and apple cider vinegar because that's what I had on hand. 
Will definitely make it again.

This is a very tasty and refreshing salad.  If you have fresh cucumbers from the garden, try this.  You won't be disappointed.  I think it's at it's best when allowed to meld for a while.
