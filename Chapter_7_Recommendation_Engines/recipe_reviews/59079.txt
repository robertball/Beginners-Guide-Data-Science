Absolutely delicious and very, very easy.  A nice change from the typical celery/carrot lentil soups.   I used about half of the recommended amount of lentils so that it didn't get too thick, and it came out wonderfully.  The tomato paste gave it a wonderfully rich flavor, so if you prefer your soups "brothier," go with less tomato paste.   We skipped the sherry and just went with a sprinkling of parmesan and it was perfect.  This probably would work well with cannellini if you don't have lentils on hand.  Thanks for an excellent recipe!

This is a balanced, hearty soup which will be especially popular on winter nights.  I only had 4 cups of broth so mine turned out a little more like stew than soup but is quite tasty anyway.  

I wouldn't suggest serving this to anyone who doesn't like lentils as the flavor definitely comes through, but the onion and pepper flavors are less pronounced.  

I might top some of the leftovers with sour cream and a little salt instead of parmesan.  Next time I make this I will probably add more mushrooms.

I substituted celery for the green pepper & only added a dash of basil instaed of 4 teaspoons.  I used a 32 oz. box of chicken broth & a 14 oz. can.  The soup gets pretty thick though so you may want to add more broth, possibly at the end.  I did simmer the soup for longer than the recipe said. It tastes good with & without the added sherry.

I've been trying a lot of lentil recipes lately because my family is trying to eat cheap and healthy meals. This is one of my favorites. I usually don't like soups very much, but I did like this. It doesn't need the sherry though.

Portobello mushrooms are hard to find where we live so when I ran across them I thought I'd try something new!  So.. this soup was what I did.

I have one word... BLECH!  It was not even edible.  My son asked me why the soup tasted like "bathwater!" and he wasn't being rude - he was just asking like any 4 year old.  

Honestly, I'm not a negative reviewer, but I felt I needed to warn others...

This was really good!  I didn't have cooking sherry, so I didn't add it.  I also didn't have a green pepper, so I put in some celery, which was good!   I did take some fresh, washed spinach and shredded it into my bowl of hot soup.  I got the idea from another lentil soup recipe and it tasted really good in here.  Maybe too much basil, next time I won't add so much.  I did keep adding water to the soup as it cooked, but that's my personal preference on how thick I like it.  Will make again!

Very good! Next time I'd use less lentils and more mushrooms. A nice, easy, satisfying soup.

This is a fabulous soup! I was looking for a Lentil soup recipe without carrots and stumbled across this one.  I was somewhat hesitant because I was concerned the mushrooms may be too overwhelming - I am SO glad I made it - it is very very good!  The mushrooms are not overpowering at all.  I used all the ingredients and only substituted yellow onion for red (since that's all I had in my pantry) - plus I omitted the parmesan cheese for a healthier option.  GREAT and TASTY soup!!

This was easy to prepare and very tasty. I added carrots just because I like them and used yellow lentils because that was what I had. I will make this a staple.

I thought this was just OK, nothing wrong with it but nothing special.  We'll definitely eat it all but I probably won't make it again.

This was very good! I added a little cumin and red pepper flakes because I like spice. Like some other reviewers suggested, I used less lentils than called for. Will make this again!

Great lentil soup recipe! Instead of tomato paste, I added a 14.5 oz. can of fire-roasted tomatoes. Forgot to add in the sherry and parm...if you use low-sodium chicken broth, you will need to add quite a bit of salt for flavoring.

I love this recipe as a base idea.  I think if you like the flavour of basil, and/or Italian food, you will love this.  Personally, I needed to add some oregano and fresh parsley to give the soup a more rounded flavour. I also added lots of ground black pepper to give it a bit of a kick (because I like a bit of heat in my food) As per some other reviewers, I would also cut back to maybe one cup lentils and add some more mushrooms.  I also omitted the sherry.  It was wonderful, and the parmesean is the ingredient that ties all these wonderful herbs together to create a very satisfying, healthy, delicious soup.

This was good.  I didn't have a green pepper so I used red.  I wish I had doubled the mushrooms, though!  I normally like sherry, but I didn't care for it in this soup.  I'll just leave it out when I reheat my leftovers.  Next time, I might even add some shredded chicken breast, but it was fine without it.

Very easy and very good.  I substituted half the chicken broth for beef broth to give it a more hearty flavor.

Delicious! I used homemade veggie broth and extra chicken broth I had lying around. I simmered for about 1 hr and had to add about 2 extra cups of broth because it was so thick. I also used rosemary and thyme in addition to the basil (I also added extra basil). I loved it!

I had a similar stew at a friends house. I don't know what recipe she used but I recognized the ingredients in this recipe and gave it a try. This is so good and so healthy. I make it on a chilly day when I want to have a filling meal but not overdo the calories. If you have a big appetite serve it with some bread and trust me you'll be full even if you are used to meat dishes. Sometimes after I make my bowl I sprinkle on some Frank's hot sauce. I love Frank's and take every opportunity to use it!

Excellent recipe.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to create a veggie/healthier version.  The sherry adds a perfect "kick" to the soups.

This is now on my Favorite Lentil Soup Recipes list!  Yum!  I did substitute some ingredients:  red for green bell pepper; 1 can Rotel chopped tomatoes with juice, for tomato paste; vegetable for chicken broth; and red for brown lentils.  The portobellos give the soup weightiness, while the sherry gives it a lovely cold-weather sophistication.  Oh my!
