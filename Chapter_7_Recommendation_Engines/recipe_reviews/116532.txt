If you think butterscotch and caramel are basically the same thing, then you won't have any problems with this recipe. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the #1 comment I received on it was "Oh, that's butterscotch? It tasted like caramel." (#2 comment was "YUM") That said, it was very rich and delicious. The only change I made was to boil it a little longer - about 7 minutes - to thicken it, based on other reviews. It turned out perfectly. I served this along with one dark chocolate, one milk chocolate, and one cheese fondue last night, and this was my favorite. You can't dip just anything in it like you can with chocolate, but it was great on pound cake, rice krispy treats, brownie balls, pretzels, apples, marshmallows, cheesecake, and bananas.

If you are looking for something other than the traditional chocolate fondue this is it! I served it a baby shower that I hosted with vanilla wafers & pound cake and it was a hit! Everyone loved it. I actually doubled the recipe because I didn't think it was going to be enough & I did have some left over. It is amazingly light & yummy. Would also be good just drizzled over a cake or ice cream. YUM!

Everyone loved this fondue, especially on golden pound cake.  Based on other reviews, I boiled it for 7-8 minutes instead of 5 minutes until it thickened up just a little bit.  It will still seem thin in the pot, but once you transfer it to a fondue pot, the mixture cools and thickens even more.

I am not the biggest chocolate fan and a friend made this for a fondue party last night.  It was AMAZING!  So wonderful with apples and bananas.  I plan to make this ASAP.  It was runny, but there's enough flavor that it doesn't need to be loaded on at all.

It was delicious. I would definitely call it caramel and not butterscotch though. It was kind of runny at first but it set up a lot in the fridge and was a perfect consistency. We dipped apples and pretzels in it. I would make it again.

I did find I had to cook this a few minutes over the recommended time, and needed to be cautious of sugaring, BUT this was FABULOUS!  I served it alongside the Chocolate Bar Fondue from this site, on a "girl's weekend away."  The kudos came rolling in!  Pretzels are really good in this, and it's even good the next day stirred into coffee.  This is a keeper.

It really wasn't as fondue like as I was expecting it to be. It turned out really runny...but I experimented a bit and created a new recipe that turned out wonderfully!

It was more like carmel than "butterscotch", but still awesomely delicious!  Tasted a bit like my grandma's homemade carmels, but in a creamy dip!  We did all kinds of dippin'... pound cake, rice crispy treats, blackberries, strawberries, bananas, apples, marshmallows and the kids rolled their dipped creations in cupcake toppings too - such a cute dessert - would be great for a kids party!

super easy and super delicious!  I made it ahead os time so I think that's why it wasn't very runny.  Very good with bananas and pears!

I wanted a little more butter flavor so I melted the butter first and toast it until brown, being careful to not burn it. Browning the butter seems to bring out a stronger butter flavor. That was the only change. The family and neighbors loved it.

This fondue really tasted more like caramel than butterscotch, and it was a bit too thin. However, my family loved the "caramel" fondue.

So good!  Made it again but substituted rum for vanilla for a slightly different variation.  Yum!

Excellent!  However, DO NOT USE LIGHT BROWN SUGAR; use DARK!  The recipe didn't indicate which to use so I bought both and made two different fondues.  The one with the light sugar ended up hardening like carmel and I could have broken a tooth it was so hard! My cornerware dish is destroyed; I can't get the stuff out of it! The dark was really rich a creamy and hardened after a hour of sitting out.  It was very good on fruit and pound cake!  Just needs to be eaten within an hour I'd say or it gets too hard.

This is a tantalizing treat.  I made it for a New Year's Eve party and provided bananas, apples, pretzels, marshmallows, and fresh pineapple to dip.  SO YUMMY!

This recipe is definitely caramel and really does need to be cooked much longer to create a consistency that is good for dipping. I probably cooked my for at least ten minutes if not longer. It was really very good, especially on apples!!
