I made three of these this morning, as I wanted to have a fun breakfast that I could make with my two kids and have them participate. I don't keep green bell pepper on hand, I used red instead. I made no other changes. I made sure that we all sprayed our mugs very well with cooking spray before pouring in our omelette ingredients. This turned out very cool--my kids and I were very impressed. After they finished their mug omelettes, they wanted to make another one! This would be great to expand to have little bowls of different throw in's and really make some fun omelette combinations. Thanks for sharing your recipe--my kids and I made a wonderful memory this morning.

Easy and delicious without a ton of prep or clean up!What more could you ask for from a simple yet filling breakfast? Perfect for when you need something "on the go". I've been making this for my husband to take to work and you can use any type of microwave-safe dish as long as you spray it with Pam. Watch your cooking times as microwave strengths vary - you don't want the eggs to explode. I love the combo of ham, cheese, and veggies. This recipe is a great base: use your favorite cheeses or breakfast meats and add-in whatever veggies you have on hand. You can even lighten it up by using Egg Beaters and fresh herbs! This works great for breakfast sandwiches on biscuits or English muffins or try it in a warm tortilla for a breakfast wrap. Whatever you choose it's bound to be good!

I use two whole eggs, I didn't feel like separating eggs, some left over cooked Italian sausage and some diced peppers.  My microwave is pretty powerful, I cooked for 1 minute and the egg puffed up really high - took it out, couldn't really stir it as it was mostly cooked.  The egg deflated and I just used a knife to move the egg around the mug, add a little cheese and back into the microwave for 30 seconds.  Make sure you spray the mug well and the egg will just slide right out.  BTW - this is great with just one egg in a ramekin for one minute.  Perfect for making egg McMuffins.

I have made these for ages.  The only difference is I add a tablesppon or so of milk when I whisk the eggs to make them fluffier.  Very easy and quick to make!

This is the second time I've made this, the first time following the recipe to the letter...it was very good.  This time I made two Egg McMuffins (used ramekins, the perfect size) and cooked for about 2-1/2 minutes on high in the microwave.  The omelet was in between a slice of American cheese on the bottom and Canadian bacon on the top and sandwiched onto a toasted  English muffin.   This time I used Southwestern Egg Beaters (1/4 cup for each sandwich) which tasted delicious.  With the two ramekins going into the dishwasher and hand washing one small skillet for the Canadian bacon, the cleanup was easy (no more messy egg rings to scrub!).  This is now my go-to method for making Egg McMuffins, love it!

I make this every weekend for our group home consumers.  Only I use a bowl with a tablespoon of butter around the perimeter of the bowl, crack 1 egg in the center, mix with a fork, add 1 tablespoon of water, place in microwave for 1 min, at 30 seconds I place a slice of cheese on top.  Perfect everytime !! AND the feedback is ++++++

I love this recipe for a quick, protein-packed breakfast. I used two whole eggs vs egg whites and added a fresh sliced mushroom and 2 teaspoons milk as others had recommended for a fluffier omelet. It has turned out great every time I've made it and it is easily modified to suit your taste!

This is Hilarious !!! I think Sharlene has been spying on my kitchen, LOL. My wife is VERY calorie conscious ( though she doesn't really need to be) and since I'm the cook I'm always trying to fix something that fits in her plans and is tasty. I've been making her this type of omelet for more than a year and it has been a complete success. She doesn't eat pork, so instead of the ham, I have used turkey ham or a good quality, and also I make the omelet a bit larger, using 2 whole eggs and 2 egg whites. Also keep sauteed mushrooms in fridge at all times, so add those, also use a bit more diced pepper ( sorry, only use red), and a bit of dehydrated onion

Surprise,I thought I created this method.  I have been making omelets in a cup for years also.  I use typically use eggbeaters, one wedge of laughing cow cheese, fresh spinach and sun dried tomato.  It is healthy, quick and quick clean up.  Great for busy week day mornings.

I have been doing this for over 30 years....Started with breakfast at work. Kept a few eggs in fridge at work and slices of cheese and butter.  I have found over the years that different mw take different times.  I first try to stir at 30 sec. then 15 sec and then every 10 sec after that.   If it cooks for too long, it becomes rubbery.  Take it out just BEFORE it is cooked.  It will continue to cook for the next 10 sec. so, if you keep it cooking in the mw until done, it will be overdone...

I like this mostly, because of how easy it is to do and hardly any clean up. No matter how much of a rush I'm in, I can always spare 2 minutes and have a healthy breakfast.

Omelet in a Mug Haiku: "Fool-proof recipe. (But use Tons of cooking spray.) Super-fast and good." I worked at a bagel joint years ago, and this was how we made the eggies for bagel sandwiches. Really can't go wrong w/ the ease of this method when you need a quick breakfast. I used 2 eggs, rather than splitting out the whites, and added a sprinkle of chopped green onion. Guess my microwave's a power-house b/c mine popped and splattered a bit, but thankfully, I'd used a heavy hand on the Pam-squirter, so the mug wasn't difficult to clean. Hard to rate this any less than 5 stars, not just for its ease of prep, but for the countless ways to change around the ingredients to suit one's taste.

This is also good made in a zip lock bag, then just throw the bag away.  You don't even need to spray the inside of the bag, just pour it out!

Not sure why, but this didn't work as well for me as it apparently did for everyone else )-:  I used 2 whole eggs and a couple of teaspoons of milk in addition to some cheese, chopped mushroom and red bell pepper. When I went to stir it after microwaving 1 minute, it was cooked on the bottom and sides without enough uncooked egg to really stir it.  I stirred it anyway, which broke it up, added the cheese and cooked it for 30 seconds more.  It tasted good, but the texture was kind of rubbery.  I might try it again using lower power.  I really wanted it to work because it is so fast and easy.

Clever, SHARLENE J MCKEE. She has such good recipes. And the people who commented really did well too -- good ideas. Plus-plus on this one. Me, I used a bit of salsa (no milk) for a huevos rancheros fling. Next time I'll make it a chili cheese omelet. Use the same mug to preheat the chili and then pour in the eggs. No pan to wash up.

I used Florentine egg beaters, Swiss cheese, bacon and onion.  Tasted like a wonderful little quiche.

This is an excellent idea however I incorporated it to make a pouched egg for Eggs Benedict!  I sprayed the inside of the cup as directed and added one egg and covered with plastic wrap.  Glad I used the plastic wrap and it started popping, loudly and would of left a nasty mess in the microwave!  However 47 seconds later (my microwave was already hot from cooking bacon), I had the perfect soft pouched egg!  Now my mornings will be far easier to manage breakfast.  I do intend on trying out the omelet but wanted to let others know that it works for Eggs Benedict as well!

Loved this!  I used diced cooked sausage instead of bacon and diced cheddar so there were little pockets of cheese in the omelet.  And, no pan to clean when I get home from work!!  But, do use a tall mug - it does rise while cooking!

This was Good. Not great. Certainly works for a quickie breakfast. My son is a Welder who lives on the road in hotels. Must tell him about this. Per other reviewers - I used a splash of milk two 2 whole eggs - whisked them good with a fork. I then added bacon and cilantro. Quick mix again. Cooked in a 2 Cup Glass Measuring Cup sprayed with butter spray, for 1 minute. Stirred with a knife, added the cheese and hot sauce and nuked for 45 more seconds. Good. Not fantastic, but would do it again if I needed a quickie breakfast.

I use a very simplied version of this recipe. I actualy grab an egg and whatever meat, veg and cheese I have on hand and take them to work with me. Once I have a free moment I pop into the breakroom and mix the items in a throwaway coffee cup. This is perfect before there is no clean-up and most offices only have a microwave, no stove. I find one egg to be plenty. I stir after 30 sec. then cook for another 30-40 seconds. I add milk or liquid coffee creamer if on hand. I find water makes it too watery.

Great way to make eggs . Make this frequently for my grandchildren . They like their eggs scrambled and I usually only need to cook them about a minuet. I also add a small amount of milk before scrambling the eggs . The eggs turn out light and fluffy.

This is nothing but microwaved scrambled eggs that was featured in every microwave cookbook from the 80's.  I make them every other day or so.  with a sausage patty or slice of Virginia ham and a slice of cheese you have a great muffin sandwich.  I cook the egg on power level 7 for 2 min. per egg to prevent the egg from rubberizing, stir once after 1 min. and it is the perfect egg disk for a muffin.

I have been making my omelets and scrambled eggs like this for years. Only I don't time them - I watch them. When I see them start to expand, I open the mic and stir them up and put them back in until they start to expand again and keep doing this until they are the desired doneness. I also notice it prevents the rubberiness that some people get. They get rubbery when they get overcooked. My method prevents them from overcooking. I also "fry" eggs in the mic in a dish coated with your favorite whatever. I prefer butter, it gives the egg a nice brown crispy edge. By the way I am a vegan and no longer eat eggs or non-vegan butter but will pass this tidbit along to those of you who haven't seen the error of your ways so to speak :)

These are so delicious and very easy to make. We have made these two weekends in a row and can't get enough of them! I plan on trying out different fillings in the future.

This is a winner! Simple and yummy and very pretty. I need to take a few pics next time I make it.  I don't consider my microwave to by very powerful but after about 45 seconds during round two in the microwave my omlette was billowing over, so you might want to keep an eye on your mug during the second round in the microwave.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe. I've been doing something similar to make a breakfast sandwich on a muffin or toast. For this, I just use one egg in a round or square microwave-safe container (as appropriate for the type of bread you use), lightly coated with Pam cooking spray. I'll scramble the egg in the oiled container then top with pre-cooked crumbled bacon or sausage and shredded cheddar. I also like to add a little seasoned salt or Greek seasoning. Keep in mind that, if you like more generous meat portions on your breakfast sandwich, it's best to cook them separately. The cooking time varies significantly with the ingredients you add. An egg alone is little more than 30 seconds while adding other ingredients can increase the cooking time up to a minute and a half. You'll be amazed how easy this is and how easily the cooked egg falls out of your plastic container! Warning! Be sure to break the yolk or you'll have a mess on your hands. Don't ask me how I know. ;)

We just made these this morning  to see how well they worked.  We will be traveling and only have a microwave to work with for breakfast so these turned out perfect.  I pretty much followed the instructions (I was a tad lazy and used two whole eggs and a splash of milk like I would for regular eggs).  I had no problems with stirring the egg or rubbery eggs. Ours came out perfect! I made ham and cheese for my 4 year old and a spinach and feta combo for myself.  I love that this recipe is simple, quick, and you can customize it to your taste.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe using a microwave.

Have been doing this for years and and years and just switch up the ingredients according to what have on hand. Love it that you can simply eat it out of the mug even on the go! The one thing I do differently is use three eggs yolks and one egg white because am not a fan of whites except using for meringue. Oh, and I slather room temp butter instead of cooking oil to coat the mug ;-)

I love this if I can get enough cooking spray or butter in the dish.  Microwaved eggs really stick.

To Angelwalker, poke the yolk with a toothpick to avoid an explosive yolk.

Holy cow! How am I just now finding out about this?! Thank you, so easy and fun. 1200 watts, 2 eggs (turkey ham and cheese) 2 minutes exactly. Can't wait to experiment further, a little milk and/or egg whites next time...Thanks again!

No complaints.  I was a little concerned about cleaning up the cup, but it was no problem.   It was a whole lot more simple than making one in a skillet.  I have a difficult time trying to flip an egg omelet in the skillet.  It generally comes out scrambled.   I am not certain yet but I might prefer the method of making it on a glass pie plate.  Looks more like an omelet that way.   I have now done it both ways.

Not that great. Suppose it would be good if you're in a hurry. I much prefer my eggs mixed with milk and cooked in a frying pan but I thought Id give this a try. Interesting idea though. I did use button mushrooms instead of bell pepper but don't think that would make any difference. Wont be making this again.

Wow! So I made this recipe with a little bit of milk and mozzarella added and it tasted pretty good. The only bad thing that happened is that the top EXPLODED! (It was sooo cool!) the rest was fine and it tastes great with some ketchup on top!

I have made this a few times now and it is perfect for a quick breakfast! It's easy to change up the add ins to something else you enjoy. Try some cooked sausage or crumbled bacon. Pepper jack cheese gives it a zing. It still works. Thank you!

It's a good recipe for novelty.  I'd rather use a non stick pan or a double pan omelet maker.   Cleaning a nonstick pan especially if it's dishwasher safe along with one fork and a small glass bowl is quite quick and easy, along with whatever dish you serve in.  If you are making just an egg without the ingredients, it would save time.  The adding of ingredients is what takes the time and makes the total time saving and sacrifice of taste a mute point. . . In my opinion.

The eggs turn out good, but had to give the recipe 3 stars  because the clean up is always a pain.  Tried spraying the cups and greasing with butter but the egg is always a pain to clean out of the mug.

Used 3 whole eggs, frozen cauliflower, frozen broccoli, 1/2 can fresh mushrooms and a couple pinchs of grated chees, pinch of crumbled bacon, it is easy and turned out great in a 2:10 breakfast.  Didn't spray the bowl, the fat from the cheese was enough as well as the water from the frozen veggies.  Two thumbs up

Two minutes was too long in my microwave.  The eggs were dry and crumbly.  I'll try it again, though, because despite the awful texture it did taste good.  Next time I'll do 45 seconds, stir, then maybe 30 or 45 more to make sure it doesn't overcook.

(I used chopped Havarti with dill and skipped the green pepper.)

Slight change in the eggs. Didn't use egg white and still turned out great. Did in a microwaveable food safe container so could be implemented as a quick breakfast item for golfers.

Not bad! I used  turkey, two whole eggs, and roasted red peppers.  After it was cooked I added a couple fork fulls of salsa!  Perfect! You can add almost anything to this basic recipe, and you can’t go wrong.

Super easy, worked like a charm.  Instead of spray I melted some butter in the cup and swirled it around.  Omelette plopped right out.  1min. stir then 30 sec. more

I make these, except I use a microwave safe bowl sprayed with cooking spray.  Now, I have to try the mug method.

I would swap the 2 tablespoons of ham for cheese and just do one tablespoon of ham. Otherwise, it was great!

Easy to do, I use one level lower power than high on my 1100 watt microwave. Made with two eggs and butter, melted butter first, added beaten eggs, microwaved for 1 minute, stirred, microwaved about another 30 seconds.

Made it as written. Perfect base to add whatever “throw ins” you have handy in the fridge. Don’t be afraid to make extra, they freeze and reheat beautifully.

Loved this, made a cheddar and green chili omelette.  I did use 2 whole eggs though. Then another day I made "soft boiled eggs" by cooking only 30 seconds, stirring, cooking 15 seconds, stirring and a final 10 seconds in the microwave. Was delicious. Thanks for this technique, it's great!

I've been cooking eggs in the microwave for years. You can add any meats, cheese and veggies you have on hand to these eggs. I do it in a small glass bowl versus a cup though, it seems to even out the cooking. Keep checking on it, don't overcook or you'll end up with a rubbery egg. I cook just under and my eggs are always perfect, I even make them perfectly runny if we want.

I used 2 whole eggs and a couple teaspoons of water. Definitely don't forget the nonstick spray! In my microwave I stopped at 30 seconds and stirred, and it only took another 30 seconds to cook all the way through. These are so easy when just needing a quick breakfast for one or two people.

I added cooked bacon instead of ham and a mixture of yellow, red and orange sweet peppers. Quick, easy and a hit with the family.

Im new to making eggs and this was delicious!
i didnt have and green peppers on hand so i left them out and used canadian bacon.  i added a little milk like someone suggested in another review and it definitely made it flufier.
i used a big mug so it didnt puff out of it but it was really really good.

I used to cook a lot of omelets for myself as I work from home.  This was so easy and quick with very little cleanup.  I put fresh spinach, halved cherry tomatoes, cheddar cheese and green onion.  I will for sure eat this often but next time I will only use two eggs as two egg whites and one whole egg was too much for me to eat.

I have made this recipe many times when I didn't want to dirty any dishes. It was great! I used butter flavored cooking spray in cup for a buttery taste.

This was a lifesaver for us. We lost power during the storm. Had a generator but could not use the stove, only the microwave. So tried this and it worked out great.  My husband likes his eggs so this recipe was wonderful. I used just 2 eggs, ham, a slice of cheese and added a little chopped onion,a tablespoon of water. It was nice and fluffy.

i normaly hate omelets, but i tried this as a test run for my parents' anniversary (I needed something quick to make before school) It tastes amazing!!
i used two whole eggs instead of one and two egg whites, and no ham.
my only question is: how do you make it look good? mine looked kind of like an ugly blog/mess.
thanks!
