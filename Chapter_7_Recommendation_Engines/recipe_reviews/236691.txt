Rather then 1 1/2 hours this took a total time of just over 2 1/2 hours.  I roasted, covered as directed for 1 hour 15 minutes and the internal temp of the stuffing was 115.  I continued to let it roast at 350, uncovered at 2 hours the stuffing was 142.  While the chicken may have been done the stuffing was not.  I never did turn the oven to 425, just let it roast to bring the stuffing up to temp.  Finally at 2 1/2 hours the stuffing was at 164 and I pulled the chicken and let in rest.  The bird was nicely browned but the meat was over cooked.  The wings and legs were falling off when I removed it from the pan.   (This is why I usually don't stuff poultry)  The stuffing in the casserole and in the bird tasted great - next time just skip the stuffing the bird part.  Good thing I wasn't in a hurry for dinner!

4-8-2018 ~Great, basic reference recipe for a traditional roast chicken with bread stuffing.  Using the recipe for the most part as a time and temperature guide, I took a little liberty with the stuffing.  I sweated the celery and onions along with some chopped mushrooms.  (Trying to clear out the fridge before we head out of town again) Rather than all the herbs called for I made it simple and used poultry seasoning to taste.  I did not need a half cup of butter, merely enough to sweat the vegetables and to ensure a rich, moist stuffing.  I also added some chicken broth and a beaten egg.  I rubbed some butter under the skin of the chicken and on the outside as well.  Individual ovens can vary, but the chicken came out of the oven perfectly roasted, tender and juicy after 1-1/2 hours.  It was 160 degrees when I took it out of the oven but after about ten minutes of resting time while making some gray with the drippings it was a perfect 165 degrees.  My bird was exactly 3 pounds and I roasted it at a consistent temperature of 350 degrees, uncovered.  While I did make some modifications to the stuffing to suit my taste, I found the recipe a useful guide in terms of roasting such a small chicken! Four stars rather than five â€“ too much butter called for, and it is best not to cover the chicken while roasting.
