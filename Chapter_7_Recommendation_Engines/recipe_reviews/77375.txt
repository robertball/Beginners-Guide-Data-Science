I gave this 5 stars after taking the advice of others to add three eggs.  I also added 1/2 cup of apple sauce, pumpkin pie spice and cinamon.  When cooled, I topped with cream cheese frosting from this site.  I know this is a variation from the original 2 ingredients but I wanted to let everyone know how fabulous it turned out.  I regularly cook for our extended family - up to 21 people (we take turns making dinner every night) - and EVERYONE thought this was to die for!  I use baking for my mental therapy and this was one of my more rewarding quick fixes.  Hope you'll try my suggestions.

Maybe this should be called "Three Ingredient Pumpkin Cake!"  After reading all of the other reviews, I figured this many people can't be wrong so I added two eggs to the batter.  That's the only ingredient change I made to the recipe and it turned out great.  I didn't have the problem that some other reviewers mentioned about the batter being so difficult to mix.  I used my very powerful stand mixer and it was blended in a snap.  I baked it in a bundt pan for 30 minutes, which was adequate, although next time I might add 5 more minutes.  I took it to a ladies Bible study and there were no leftovers.  I didn't frost it, but I think I will make a cream cheese frosting next time ... and there will be a next time.  It's just too easy and too good.

This recipe is better made as COOKIES!  No eggs needed--mix the cake mix and pumpkin, add some chocolate chips if desired, and scoop onto cookie sheets!!  Cook about 14-16 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean.  Super easy, and SO GOOD!  Better than store bought pumpkin chocolate chips cookies.

After reading reviews,  I added 2 eggs, half a cup of applesauce, and I used pumpkin pie mix instead of just pumpkin - because it's what I had. I wanted to take a moment to thank you for this recipe.  My family and I are living strictly off donations from a food pantry. We often get unusual ingredients and don't know what to do with them.... but no food can go to waste,  everything has to get used.  So many recipes have ingredients that we just don't have,  or have access to. This recipe is two ingredients.   Nothing fancy. If you have more,  you can do more,  but the base recipe will work.  I have a family Christmas party to go to today, and thought I'd have to go empty handed.  This recipe allowed me to make SOMETHING so I could celebrate,  too,  and not hang my head in shame.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe and giving me dignity.

Five stars because of both simplicity and flavor.  Have synthesized the various suggestions here to nail it down spot on.  To the base cake, simply adding two eggs and 1/4 cup of sugar causes the cake to bake into a nice 'dome' shape as most cakes do in a 13 x 9 pan (30 minutes at 350 degrees F).  The cake is enhanced by a super simple glaze:  1/4 cup confectioners sugar, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 2 Tablespoons milk.   Blend and pour over warm cake.  Finally, if you want to take it over the top, put a dollop of whipped cream then a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice to cap it off and you're there.  Incredibly simple and delicious.

I used yellow butter cake mix with a few shakes of pumpkin pie spice mixed in then the canned pumpkin.  So what if the mixture is thick? I know it seems weird but it's supposed to be thick. It's still workable. You are only mixing to the point of combining the mix & pumpkin together so you shouldn't be working yourself into a sweat over it! It's not that difficult. The point of this recipe is to save fat & calories! I used cream cheese frosting with a few shakes of pumpkin pie spice mixed it. Super yummy & super easy to make.

There are a few reasons why I gave this only 3 stars. The taste of the cake was just ordinary, nothing special. The cake batter was very, very difficult to work with. The recipe said to spread evenly in the 9x13 pan but this batter was like spreading thick peanut butter in a pan that has been greased. It stuck to the spatula much more than it did to the dish. When I would move the spatula the batter literally came out of the dish. And however you make it look when you put it in the oven is exactly how it will look when it comes out. So, needless to say, it is not a pretty presentation. The cake does not puff up and even out at all. It is almost impossible to spread this evenly and get a smooth surface and when it is done baking it really shows. It can be covered up with frosting however. So while the ingredients make this cake appear very quick and easy the prep work takes up much more time than anticipated.

I loved this cake.  I didn't change a thing, didn't add a thing and it turned out very moist and tasty - I didn't even add frosting.  Best of all, it's low-fat, low-calorie, vegetarian-friendly and just really really good.  I've heard this works well with chocolate cake mix, too...I'll have to try it.

After reading the reviews I also decided to add 1/4 cup of sugar, 2 eggs and some canned cream till it was a little easier to spread.  It was fanastic!!  I love this recipe. I decided to use a jelly roll pan and make bars, topped it with cream cheese icing, and then poured carmel topping over it, all I can say is YUMMY!!  I took it to work and it was gone within 5 minutes.  I was trying to reproduce a recipe from a place called the Bread Basket.  This was even better than theirs, :)

I've been making this for many years.  It's a perfectly great cake made just the way it is written.  I admit that I usually add about a 1/2 can of water (empty pumpkin can) to make it easier to mix and I believe that it makes it moister, so if you have trouble mixing the two ingredients add some water,  but why add eggs, milk, cream, etc.  It just adds extra calories.  No extra spices are needed either as the spice cake mix has plenty of spice.

Very moist and great flavor!  I added 1/4 sugar for a little extra sweetness, and also two eggs, as suggested by other reviews.  I added 1/4 cup of canned milk, just to make it easier for me to spread it in my "homemade" bundt pan.  I used a glaze found on this site with another recipe (Harvest cake) and everyone thought the cake was delicious still warm with whipped topping!

Yum! I made this tonight after hearing about it from a friend.  It was so easy and tastes great. I added about 1/2 cup of water to thin out the batter. I will make this again and again for the holiday's.

this recipe is best made as pumpkin muffins!  they are rich, delicious and best of all low fat and low cal.  I just mix the cake mix, pumpkin and 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice together until incorporated.  With an ice cream scoop, scoop mixture into a sprayed, paper lined muffin tins.  The mix should make 12 muffins.  Bake @ 350 degrees for 17-19 minutes.

I made this as muffins/cupcakes exactly as written, except used a devil's food cake mix because that's what I had on hand.  I LOVED THEM - and so did my picky daughter who has a major sweet tooth. This makes a great healthier replacement for fatty cake recipes and I will make it over and over.  This weekend I will go get a spice cake mix and see how that one turns out!  UPDATE: I've now made it with spice cake mix and carrot cake mix and both are WONDERFUL!  I do it in muffin tins and send them to school with my kids and to work to share.  Everyone LOVES them.

It's true!  It doesn't get any easier than this.  Perfect when you have no time to shop for multiple ingred's.  It definitely needs frosting, though.  Used cream cheese frosting IV from this site and was perfect.  Also sprinkled mini choc chips on top and balanced the taste well.   Yum!

We've made this many times, EXACTLY, and loved it. I don't understand how people can honestly rate this when they've changed the recipe to the point of it being unrecognizable from the original. It does not need eggs, or sugar, or cream. We've used the recipe to make cookies, cake, and cupcakes/muffins (my daughter's favorite). Lately we've been using yellow cake mix, as it's better received in my house of picky eaters, and we sometimes throw in chocolate chips. Lower fat than other cakes, much higher in fiber, and very, very yummy!

This is an excellent recipe.  I noticed in some reviews that people added eggs.  The whole point in this recipe is that it elminiates the need for eggs which have 5 grams of fat a piece and adds pumpkin which is high in fiber and good for you.  You can use a can of pumpkin with any flavor cake mix and it tastes great!

This was a 2nd attempt at this cake. The 1st time I made this, I totally thought I'm NOT going to try this again. Because it was so heavy and dense in the bundt pan...that when it cooled off, the cake split in half and not all of it came out of the pan and dumped everywhere. I was very disappointed. So nearly a year later, I thought about it again and figured, I'd try again. So, with that in mind...different results, and I now understand what happened. While others have success with making their's in bundt, it was way way to dense and it doesn't rise very much...matter fact very little. I ended up using a 8x10 perfect brownie pan..without the brownie insert, and it worked out very well. The cake was very moist, and still lightly dense, but it cooked through all the way, so I can't complain on that. It sure wasn't the prettiest cake at the ball coming out of the oven. So I just used a biscuit cutter and stacked little mini cakes onto a plate with leftover buttercream frosting and called it a day. I'll make again just as I did the 2nd time. But never put it in a bundt pan. The smaller the baking pan, the better success.

The perfect muffin!  I made this recipe EXACTLY as written, filled 11 lightly pammed standard muffin cups almost to the top, and baked for 17 min, turning my pan 10 minutes in.  The muffins came out PERFECT.  Super moist and tons of flavor.  I feel like a lot of you are wasting eggs - they are not needed for this to be perfect!  The batter will cook just as it lays - so try to smooth out the top a little before baking.  Mine did rise well above where they started, but ended up the perfect size.  Don't waste your eggs!

This recipe couldn't be any easier.  I listened to the others advise and added 3 eggs and threw everything in my Kitchen Aid mixer.  I took half of it to work and the guys all loved it.  Everyone at home thought it was awesome.  Very moist.

Loved it with my changes!  One box of yellow cake mix, 1-15oz can of pumpkin, 2 eggs, 1/4 of water, 1 tablespoon of McCormicks Pumpkin Pie Spice.  Beat eggs, then pumpkin, eggs, water and spice.  Mix well.  Then add cake mix to your wet mixture, mix well.  Spoon evenly and smoothly into a 8x10 greased pan.  Bake on 350 for 25 minutes.  Cake does rise and looks nice.  Let cool to a warm temp and add cream cheese icing.  Cool Whip would also go nice with it!!  I mixed all the ingredients by hand. There was no need to use a mixer which is less work and dishes!  Enjoy!

I have made this cake on a few occasions and have had raves from all who ate it. What I do differently from the original recipe is to add 2 eggs & 1/4 cup applesauce to the batter. I pour half of the batter into my bundt pan, then I sprinkle a mixture of chopped pecans and brown sugar on top. This time I added some white chocolate chips so we will see how it turns out. Then, I pour over the remainder of the batter and spread to cover the pecan ribbon. I bake for 30 min+ until my knife comes clean.

I didn't have any pumpkin but I did have two cans of carrots so I thought, "Why not?"  I first drained the carrots then dumped them in the bowl and beat the heck out of them with my electric mixer.  I then decided since I was already experimenting I added some chopped walnuts.  I was worried I didn't have enough moisture since I had NO idea if the amount of carrots I now had was equal to a can of pumpking and the walnuts would soak some up too, I added 3 medium eggs.  I followed someone else's suggestion of baking it in a bundt pan and did the sour cream glaze.  It came out great!!!  It wasn't as carroty as carrot cake would be but my husband and grown son have been fighting over who gets the biggest pieces.  Next time I will try it as it should be.  I bet it is just as good.  Thanks for the recipe!*** 2nd, 3rd... times around...  I used an electric mixer each time I made this and had NO problems mixing.  I followed the recipe exactly the 2nd time and the texture was not as good.  The 3rd and subsequent times I added an egg or two and it was GREAT!!!  I have used a bundt pan each time and it turns out lovely and rises just fine.

AWESOME!!!! and super easy - made some changes - and that would change the name of the cake - but it worked out so well!!! I made one with butter cake mix and one with devil's food cake mix - both were yummy - but my kids LOVED the devils food cake! I added 2 eggs and 8oz of soy milk (with 1 tbsp of lemon juice in - to make it like a buttermilk but keep the recipe nondairy). I made each type into muffins - They were so moist and delicious! i luv this new "cheat-cheat" recipe to make muffins!

I would not add anything - because I make it this way to keep it low in Fat/Calories for Weightwatchers.  Of course it tastes better with more eggs and sugar!

despite some reviews suggesting additions, I made this exactly as directed. It was fantastic, moist, and magically disappearing. If you are reading this, consider how simple and easy this recipe is--anyone, I do mean anyone, can make this and no additions of any kind are needed. Love this one and plan to stock up on pumpkin so I can have this one all year. Positively the easiest recipe I have tried and a positive keeper.

This recipe is perfect as is. I made these into cupcakes for Thanksgiving and frosted a few with Cream Cheese frosting, but trying them the next day, I like them better without the frosting and they're even more moist. Why add extra calories? This is a great recipe and one I'll definitely make again.

I have been making low fat pumpkin muffins for a while now using just a box of yellow cake mix and one can of pumpkin (stock up on the canned pumpkin now so you can enjoy these year round), and baking for 17 minutes in 400 degree oven.  They are the best!  And totally moist.  Nothing else is needed, and they freeze well.  I make a batch, wrap them individually, and place in freezer.  Just pull one out the day before and enjoy with a cup of coffee in the morning.  I have tried this with Devils Food cake mix, and I don't like that.  Can't wait to try them with Spiced Cake mix, and in a bundt pan.  Thanks for the recipe and suggestions.

Love this recipe! Didn't add anything. First time I used Cream Cheese Frosting, second time Cool Whip. 
For Christmas I substituted a can of Apple Pie filling. You need to cut up the apples to make them smaller. Mix the two ingredients together and bake the same as the Pumpkin cake. I sprayed Pam in the Bunt pan then put halved pecans in the pan, sprinkled cinnamon into pan, spooned in the cake batter, sprinkled on more cinnamon and baked. After it cooled, sifted confectionary sugar on top. Tasted great.

No milk?  No eggs?  No problem!  It is great as is, moist and great tasting, whether I use a spice cake mix or yellow cake mix.  I will sometimes add 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, and 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves so that it tastes like pumpkin pie.  Yeah, it is impossible to spread it perfectly evenly, so it is not pretty, but that will not matter if you top it with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

The idea is already listed on this site as Easy Pumpkin Muffins.  They are very tasty but the texture seems more suited to mufffins.

This is a fantastic recipe to also make muffins with. It will yield 48 mini muffins or 12 regular muffins.  Bake minis at 350 for 15 minutes; bake regular at 350 for 25 to 30 minutes. The simplest muffins ever!

Thank you to everyone that reviewed this recipe. I added two eggs, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2tsp cinnamon, 1/2 cup brown sugar and a few tablespoons water to make mixing easier. I baked muffins at 350 for about 20-25 minutes and then topped with cream cheese icing.  These are the best!  You have to try them jazzed up a little.

Did not have a spice cake mix, so used a yellow cake mix and added 2tsp pumpkin pie spice.  Made as cupcakes, baked at 350 for about 17 minutes.  Delish.   I always add 1cup water, never add eggs  or anything else.  (defeats the purpose of a 2 ingredient low fat cake, doesn't it?????). Any type of cake mix will work- as long as it has pudding in the mix or is labeled "extra moist".  If you decide to frost, any cream cheese frosting works great...but think about the cake mix you used..butter pecan+cream cheese with a drizzle of caramel.  Chocolate cake+ cream cheese frosting with a tsp of cinnamon mixed in.  If you use a carrot cake mix, frost,  and then sprinkle with chopped pecans.  With my vanilla cake, I saved 2T of pumpkin, and stirred it in with 1tsp vanilla, 1tsp cinnamon - frosted, then sprinkled VERY lightly with raw sugar.  Hey...at least the cake is low fat!

If you're watching calories and fat, this recipe is PERFECT as is--VERY moist and dense.  The added bonus is getting a serving of vegetables into picky eaters!
I have made this many times and with different flavors of cake mix and have never been disappointed.

Just eating it now :-)  All my guests loved it and either had seconds or took a piece home.

Took the advice of others and added 2 eggs, 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I put half the batter in a bundt pan, then sprinkled with chopped walnuts and brown sugar.  Topped with remaining batter and cooked at 350o for about 55 min.   Iced with Betty Crocker cream cheese frosting which I watered down with skim milk and whisked to make fluffy and cut down on the sweetness.  I was going to sprinkle walnuts on top and then said to my hubby - should I toast them?  He said, "No, give them to me". He sauteed them in butter, brown sugar and cinnamon.  We let them cool then decorated the top with them. They were too gooey to sprinkle but I spooned them in a ring around the top and they were yummy.)   Maybe I will put those in the middle next time.

I really liked this - and my co-workers did, too. I couldn't find a spice cake mix, nor could I see my pumpkin pie spice (which was right in front of me!) - so I used a yellow cake mix and added 2 tsp cinnamon. I also added some chopped pecans (maybe ~3/4 cup - but I didn't measure, just dumped in what was left in my bag). I frosted it with Cream Cheese Frosting II, from this site. I don't think it needed the frosting. I am going to try it unfrosted next time, or maybe try it with Cool Whipped Frosting - also from this site. It was very a very moist cake (=

Made this for a family get-together weekend and I got rave reviews, they all loved it!  My husband who is not a dessert person came back for seconds, when he thought no one was looking.  I love the idea of it being only two ingredients, thats what caught my attention, but I did add a couple extra ingrediends after reading some comments.  3 eggs, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup sour cream (because I ran out of applesauce) and about 1 teaspoon each of cinnamon and nutmeg.  After cooling I iced it with a cream cheese icing.  Over all this was a GREAT dessert and I'll deffinatly make it again - Thanks for the recipe!!!

I made this for an early Thanksgiving lunch for my family, and it was very easy and quite good.  I baked it in a bundt pan, drizzled melted cream cheese icing, and topped it with pecans I had left over from my sweet potatoes.  It made a lovely presentation.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 it that the texture was a little less than desirable - not bad, just not the best.  4.5 would be the ideal rating.  Very easy, and it really looks and tastes quite impressive!  I'll make it again.

I read reviews for this and saw that the batter was thick and didn't rise. So I combined this idea with others I have read about "Diet Coke cake" and added 1/2 or so can of Caffeine Free Diet Coke to the batter to make it thinner and fluffy. The cake rose nicely and is very light and airy without adding any extra calories via eggs. Worked like a charm!

I made this exactly as the recipe states except for using a bundt pan. I mixed the batter in my Kitchenaid. It was like a thick brownie batter, but I was able to spread it in the pan. I'm not crazy about the finished product. I tasted it the day I made it & also the next morning after a night in the fridge. It's really dense, thick & kind of sticky in your mouth. The actual flavor is ok, but I think I'd just rather add a few calories and have the eggs or oil added. I frosted with a Buttermilk Cream Cheese Spiced frosting.

This recipe is excellent as is!  I put alot of raisins in mine (because I love them) and frosted it with Cool Whip instead of frosting.  Took it to work and it was gone very quickly with alot of people asking for the recipe.  They couldn't believe it was only two ingredients.  Hard to spread out in the pan--but well worth it!!

I made this as directed however my spice cake mix was 15.25 oz.  So I used 1 3/4 cups of canned pumpkin from a 29 oz. can  I don't know what all of the fuss is about.  I mixed the cake mix and pumpkin by hand.  It was thick but not unmanageable.  I used a well-greased Bundt pan.  I smoothed the top with a spoon to make it even.  I baked it for 30 min.  I cooled it in the pan for 10 minutes.  It came right out.  True, it did not rise like a regular cake mix does.  It's more like a pumpkin ring.  The texture is good and it smells and tastes great.  I will top it with the simple glaze that someone else suggested.  I have also made this recipe into jumbo muffins.  Everyone loved them!  I love these easy recipes!

I've made this cake several times and the family loves it!  Like another reviewer, I just used a larger can (29 oz.) of the pumpkin to add moisture (no extra eggs or water needed!), and it worked beautifully...a very rich-tasting dessert.  Oh, try it with a handful of dried cranberries or raisins thrown in as well! Super!

THe only way this recipe works is IF you add eggs.  All those who gave this a high rating -ADDED to the recipe.  I don't get how you can rate it so high when so many of you completely changed it.

So, I did make this recipe, but added three eggs. By making the change, it turned out great.

I loved this!  I didn't add anything to it, just the pumpkin and the cake mix.  It was very moist!  It was a lot denser than regular cake, but it was still cake (not nearly as dense as fruit cake!!)  The only part that I felt was a bit annoying was getting it spread into the pan.  It was pretty thick and didn't want to spread (kept sticking to the spoon).  Once it was in there, it was great though!  My family can't wait until I make it again!

You show the picture of the cake made in a bundt pan so that's what I put in into. It is now 35 minutes and the cake is still raw!! If you show a cupcake pan...it should be for cupcakes...a bundt cake picture should be for a bundt pan. With two ingredients all I had to read was the temp and time cause I never figured you'd show a different photo.

After reading the reviews, I just have to say, try this recipe 'as is.' I did not add anything other than pumpkin and cake mix, and it was delicious!

The cake mix has plenty of sugar, and adding eggs just adds more calories. It's a little tough to mix, and spread in the cake pan yes, but it doesn't need any extras.

I made it in a 9x13 inch pan, and it would probably be easier to make it in a bundt pan.

You can't get any easier than this. I used a devil's food cake mix.  It tastes almost like brownies as it's very dense. I've made these in the past in miniature muffin tins lined with mini cupcake papers. I piped on a dollop of whipped cream and sprinkled lightly with cinnamon.  Makes a very pretty little dessert.

I was looking for a way to use my box of spice cake and can of pumpkin. Thank you for posting this! I did jazz it up by adding 3 eggs, 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce, 1/2 t. pumpkin pie spice & 1/4 t. cinnamon. I also frosted it w/cream cheese frosting. Yummy.  :)

This is one of our favorite quick cake/muffin recipe. This also works with any kind of cooked squash, if you have that instead of pumpkin. There's sugar-free cake mix now so for those watching their sugars/waistlines, that's a great substitution. If I'm feeling particularly nice, I'll frost this with a whipped topping frosting (one tub "free" whipped topping, one small box instant vanilla or cheesecake pudding, 1/2 cup fat free milk) for a quick dessert for last minute get togethers or dessert for my family.

I did add 6 tablespoons of egg whites and 1/3 cup of water as per the instructions on the Libby website.  I made them into 18 muffins baked for 19 minutes.  Healthy but a treat.

This is the best recipe I have found yet that only has 2 ingredients!  I made mine into muffins and sprinkled them with the Pampered Chef Sweet Cinnamon Sprinkle before putting in the oven and they turned out sooooo good!  Between my kids and hubby, they were gone within a day.

I just made this cake for Halloween, and it was the best pumpkin spice cake I have ever had. Everyone LOVED it. I added 1/3 cup of applesauce just because some reviews said it was difficult to mix, I don't even think it was necessary. The two ingredients would have been fine. To me, it was not too thick or hard to mix. It was EXTRA moist. I baked it in a bundt pan for 45 mins. I did not need glaze, whipped topping, icing - nothing. It was perfect plain. I will definitely make this again with only the 2 ingredients in the recipe. Easy peasy and better than delicious! Thank you so much for sharing this!

I tried this today. I only had the large can of pumpkin so I thought what the heck, lets see what happens. For those that thought the mix was too stiff, this worked great. It spread nicely in the pan. I did also add 1 tsp of allspice. I also used the cream cheese frosting. My husband LOVED it. Great cross between pumpkin bread and pumpkin pie. Such an easy recipe.
This is also something that is great to donate local food pantries. One can of pumpkin and one box of cake mix with the recipe printed out. Such a simple treat to make and no need for added ingredients like eggs and oil.

I made this yesterday, and took it to a bonfire get-together.  I added nutmeg, cinnamon, and poppy seeds (didn't measure, just sprinkled each ingredient) when I mixed it up, and baked it in a Bundt pan.  Then I frosted it with cream cheese frosting.  Everyone said it was delicious!  And you can't beat how easy it is...

I am in love with this recipe !!!!  I made muffins instead of a cake.  I first tried it with Spice cake and it was delicious. Next I tried it with Carrot Cake and I liked it even more. With the Carrot Cake mix I added about a teaspoon of Pumpkin Pie Spice, 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  The only other variation that I made was I added 1/3 cup of Almond Breeze Almond Coconut milk.  It help thin the batter a bit and the cupcakes were so moist. The addition of the almond/coconut milk really does not add that many extra calories either. I thought the point of this recipe is to have a lower calorie sweet treat for people that are watching their weight.  I was able to get 24 decent size cupcakes out of the recipe.  We freeze them in baggies with 2 or 4 cupcakes in each bag and it does not take long to thaw them out.  I also tried the recipe with a yellow cake mix but we did not really enjoy them at all and ended up throwing them away.  If you love pumpkin bread and pumpkin cookies like we do then using the spice cake or carrot cake mix is going to get you closest to that taste.  The yellow cake mix with the can of pumpkin had a strong flavor of yellow cake and you could not really taste the pumpkin. I would also like to try it with a chocolate cake mix sometime for those times when you crave something chocolate...

First of all, this is a great recipe. I heard about it at weight watchers last night. Use a can of pumpkin to any cake mix for a much lower fat/calorie treat. I portioned them out and baked them as cookies, which worked great. I added ~1/4 cup applesauce to make the batter more workable. This also helps them rise a bit and and makes the cake less dense overall. If you want a super rich cake this isn't it...misses the point and Allrecipes has some killer rich and fatty cake recipes. The magic in this combo is that it is a really delish way to make a treat that is considerably more healthy than most cakes (compare the nutrition facts to other cake recipes on here). I made it with devils food cake and loved the results!

My family felt these` were a bit too dense and bland, so I added 2 eggs and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I baked them as muffins/cupcakes and they loved them without icing.  Perfect for breakfast or a snack or in a gift basket.

I made this recipe per the instructions. The only thing I did differently was put the batter into a cupcake tray. It was great. These muffins turned out just like a low fat  pumpkin bread recipe I tried recently. It was great to have something that tastes so good without adding the oil or eggs.  I enjoyed this immensely. I don't feel left out this holiday season.

If you're wondering, this recipe makes really good cupcakes! I used this recipe for a neighborhood outing this weekend, but instead of a cake, made cupcakes because I wanted something that didn't have to be cut and could be eaten without utensils. 

I made the recipe AS IS, just the spice cake mix, the ingredients called for on the box of mix and 1 can of pumpkin. Nothing else. There weren't any issues mixing or batter being too thick, it was perfect. This made 24 regular cupcakes + 30 mini cupcakes (I only have 2 pans so decided to put the rest in the minis). I only had butter cream frosting here and they turned out great! One thing to note is this: I wasn't sure about the taste when I taste tested them about 1 hour after cooling, but the cupcakes tasted 10X better that night (about 6 hours later) and even better the next day.

I will make these again without any changes, except maybe making the frosting. Great recipe!

Wow......I LOVE THIS CAKE!!!!!! After reading over some reviews I did what most people did I added ingredients. I used a yellow cake mix and a 15 oz can of pumpkin. I added in two eggs, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 tsp cinammon, and a bag of chocolate chips. The batter turned out like any other cake batter. I baked it in a bunt cake pan on 350 for about 45 minutes. After pumpkin cake was cool I added icing. I made my own icing with 8 oz cream cheese, box of powder sugar, and a little milk. I am taking this cake to a family funcation and I am sure there will be none left. I will make this cake over and over again. A new favorite!!!!! :)

I don't add any eggs or anything-- the cake was hard to mix by hand (easy with a hand mixer!), and it tastes great every time! I add a glaze made of confectioner's sugar and water (or skim milk) and it's the perfect and perfectly SIMPLE dessert!

Easy, Easy, EASY! After reading some of the other reviews I worried that my cake would come out flat without eggs. I really didn't want to add egg because I didn't want the added fat. So, I followed the directions but added one cup of applesauce. It was PERFECT! Light, fluffy and delicious. Thanks!

I know this recipe is a cake, but we made it in a cupcake pan and served them as muffins.  They were fabulous.  It makes 15 muffins.  They are moist and tender.  Not many calories and open to many variations in the future, now that I know that it works well.  Nuts, chocolate chips, raisins etc.  We baked them for about 20 minutes.  Thank you for the recipe!!

I thought this made a great pumpkin bread. My whole family enjoyed it really well. Only thing I did different was that I added a scant 1/4 cup of water to thin out the batter a bit to make it easier to spread in my bundt pan, but other than that it was perfect!

I added 1 egg, to make it moist, but not too cakey & also added cinnamon, ground ginger, raisins & pecans.  It appeared a bit overbaked, so for fear of it being too dry, I made a cream cheese frosting & glazed it while still warm, then sprinkled chopped pecans to make it more attractive, as it was to be served to company.  The texture was a bit crumbly, not what I expected.  We liked the flavor, but I wish I would've tried something else for company.  I will try this one more time before moving on to other pumpkin cake recipes, but next time, I will cut 5-10 minutes off of the baking time & add 1/2 cup oil to see if that helps.

Based on the reviews I modified this a bit.  I used a little more pumpkin..until easy to stir and 2 eggs.  I almost trashed the mixture after I added the eggs.  The mixture became very slimy. After stirring the mixture more, it no longer looked slimy.
Final result was very, very good. Glad I didn't trash it.  Very moist and even better the next day.  Used cream cheese icing.  This is a keeper!

I have made this cake as the recipe is written and considered it OK.  I took some of the other reviewer's comments, added a few additional ingredients of my own and the cake was fantastic!  I kept the addition of 2 eggs and cinnamon.  Since I wanted a very heavy cake, similar to a pound cake, I also added 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt.  I baked it in an 11x14 metal pan, sprayed with cooking spray, for 15-20 min longer.  I put caramel frosting on top (from AllRecipes - ingredients are mostly butter, brown sugar, and flour).  Cake was fabulous...very moist, but lighter texture at the top, then very dense on the bottom, almost like a cheesecake. Tastes like an old fashioned cake my mother used to make from scratch, so I was very happy with it!

Didn't read the reviews before trying this, but found it very thick also and decided to add a 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Delicious and SO easy!  I would love to try these as cookies as recommended by Suz also.

I didn't have spice cake mix, so I used yellow cake mix and added nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger. Also followed the suggestion to add two eggs. Baked in a tube pan for about an hour. Drizzled with a glaze made with confectioners sugar, and a little butter and milk. Turned out tasty and moist, and not too sweet...just the way I like it. I also liked that the thick batter gave the cake a 'rough' surface, which I think makes cakes and breads look more home made. 5 stars for how quick, easy, and tasty this recipe is. Too simple not to make again and again.

I had a larger can of pumpkin on hand (20oz) and a vanilla cake mix so I used them. I added 2t of pumpkin pie spice and 1t of cinnamon since it was a vanilla cake mix. Very easy to hand mix. I used PAM on my jelly roll pan/cookie sheet. Baked it for 30 min. Excellent. It is moist and pudding like in the middle and yes it was done. Tastes like it is full of eggs and butter and ha! it isn't. Can't wait to take it to work!

Absolutely disgusting and inedible.  My cake-loving and pumpkin-loving boyfriend only took one bite.  He said his kids wouldn't eat it, either.  (Luckily, I like honest feedback!)  He said it tasted like what it was:  A box cake mix with a can of pumpkin thrown in.

Yummy and easy! Added a little water but no eggs or oil. That would defeat the purpose of a low fat option. Made this in a muffin tin. Came out perfect.

I did as another reviewer suggested and added chocolate chips to make cookies.  The end product was different than regular cookies... But considering they were super easy and contained no butter, oil, or eggs (other than what was in the mix), they were great!  My kids loved them and asked me to add them to my regular recipes

I made in to cup cakes, and added 2 eggs like others said. Along with a tiny bit of extra spices and a thrown together cream cheese icing they were the best. Moist and amazing.

I used Betty Crocker spice cake mix, the 15oz can of pumpkin, but I added 2 eggs,1/4 cup of oil and 3/4 cup of water. Sprayed the pan with Pam. The cake came out great didn't stick to pans or mini bunt pan,super moist and so light. This was great will continue to make, especially when DD stops serving pumpkin muffins.

I love simple things like this!  Spice cake is very hard to find around her during the holidays (October to December).  The stores can't keep it stocked.  So, I used a yellow cake mix, cinnamon and allspice to taste.

very yummy! I added a 6oz bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the cake mix and pumpkin and cooked as muffins. no eggs ment batter was fair game. I had to fight to keep enough to make a full pan. :) also made as muffin tops. my husband loved being able to grab one on his way out the door at 4AM. not crumbly or messy

Really good cake! I did add 2 eggs because of the reviews and it was perfect, I did not have any trouble spreading it in the 9 x 13 pan. Used a cream cheese frosting. The flavor is perfect for this time of the year (October). Family loved it.

I made this cake a few weeks ago and forgot to rate it. I made the spice version following the recipe as written and thought it was great but my wife said she could taste the pumpkin and didn't care for it. I then made a devil's food version by the recipe and she loved it. I have since made this for a family function and everybody loved it. DON'T ADD EGGS!! This is supposed to be a light recipe.

As soon as I saw this recipe I wanted to make it.  After going to two stores I couldn't find canned pumpkin.  (Apparently there is a pumpkin shortage this year.)  So, I used a can of sweet potato pie filling.  The final result was a delicious, flavorful, and healthy tasting cake!  So yummy and EASY!

I've used this recipe for the past 2 years to make pumpkin muffins. I use the foil cupcake liners placed on a large cookie sheet; this eliminates the need for cupcake tins - and no need to wash a baking pan! We love this recipe!

I also use 2 eggs. I prefer to frost with stiffly whipped cream, sweetened with Splenda. This makes great muffins too. It's been awhile since I was using Weight Watcher's, but it seems like if you are careful to not make them giant muffins and don't frost them, they go for one point each, and they freeze well.
*update*- Since becoming vegan a few years ago, I hadn't tried this, but last night I decided to give it another whirl. I used a vegan cake mix (most duncan heinz are technically vegan), a can of pumpkin, and ONE CUP OF WATER BEAT IN WITH THE ELECTRIC MIXER SOLVED THE DENSITY ISSUE. I had to cook it a little longer, but it rose up in the pan, its a delicious moist cake that doesn't need frosted. I made a vegan cream cheese frosting for it, but even my 11 year old son agreed, the cake doesn't need it so we left it on the side and ate it separately with a spoon. ;-)

This cake is super easy and awesome!! I used a 30 ounce can of pumpkin, because of reviews stating it was too hard to stir and work with. Wanting to keep with the 2 ingredient theme I decided to just ad ore pumpkin instead of adding a third ingredient. I did have to cook it about 10-15 minutes longer though. I topped it with whipped cream and it was delicious!!! It will definitely become one of my holiday staples....so easy!

My family was skeptical when I said what I was doing, but I made it exactly as written, baking for 25 minutes. We all liked it. The pumpkin adds vitamins but has no fat. This is easy and inexpensive as well. Recommend frosting it for presentation (I used cream cheese frosting);sprinkling with Fall colored or themed sprinkles would be a nice touch.

I made this recipe for my coworkers on Halloween and everyone absolutely loved it!  So much so, that I had to make it again three days later.  I did take the advice of the other reviewers and added two eggs.  The batter was pretty thick, but resulted in delicious cupcakes with cream cheese frosting!

I made this for Thanksgiving and was asked to make this again for Christmas.  Both times I was asked for this recipe by many! The only difference I made to this recipe was I added 2 eggs as another reviewer suggested, and I added Crushed Walnuts and Mini Chocolate Chips! Delicious !!!!

Yummy and very healthy compared to most cakes!  I did add one egg, just to make it spread easier.  I made it in a bundt pan, frosted with cream cheese frosting and added a sprinkle of cinnamon and chopped pecans.  Pretty and delicious!

I used a dark 9X13 pan and the original recipe and it took 26 minutes to bake on the middle oven rack. Great warm from the pan, and even better with some whipped topping or scoop of ice cream. Wonderful easy time saver!

I've been curious about the whole "dump cake" concept for a while now, so a beautiful fall day and all the (2!) ingredients available was a perfect excuse. I did add a good shake or two of pumpkin pie spice and a 1/4 of a cup or so of apple sauce for extra moisture, cooked 'em up as muffins/cupcakes, and am loving how quick and easy they were, how GREAT they are making my kitchen smell, and (not!) how loudly they're calling me to eat them all in one sitting!!  ;-)

Perfect.  I added 3 eggs,  Cinnamon and pumpkin spice, and chocolate chips, like others in the comment thread.  Very moist and yummy. For breakfast on the go,  I added protein powder.

I made this for Thanksgiving, but because my husband is diabetic, I used a sugar-free yellow cake mix; added a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon.  I spread it out thin, hoping to make a roll, but it wouldn't roll without breaking, so I made thin layers, and made an icing of cream cheese, sugar-free cool whip; and stevia to taste.  It was so good, my son ate it, and he never eats his dad's sugar-free desserts.

Wow! This was super easy! I made mine into mini muffins for the office and were a hit! I read several of the comments so added a cup of apple sauce but in the end they came out a little too moist, so I will stick with the two ingredients next time.

I always wondered who had time to write reviews but I had to add to the discussion.  I am allergic to eggs and so always pass on cake.  But I heard about this recipe and tried it with a devil's food cake mix.  If you put in a spring-form pan and flip it upside down you have a beautiful cake.  Four teenagers devoured the cake with a little whipcream on it.  I may add a little water next time to spread a bit easier.  I will definitely make it againl

I made this last night. After reading all the suggestions, I decided to use a yellow cake mix. I added 1tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/3 cup sugar , and 2 eggs. I put 2/3 batter in a greased flute pan. Chopped 1/2 cup walnuts, spread over batter, then sprinkled 1/4 cup sugar mixed with additional cinnamon. Pour the remaining batter over sugar and nuts. baked at 350 for 30 minutes. So moist and yummy no frosting needed.

I used spice cake mix, canned pumpkin, added one egg, 1/4 c water (to clean pumpkin can, dumped in 1/3 cup or so of cinnamon applesauce I had in the fridge.  Put them in the Kitchen Aid and mixed them for about 3 minutes.  I think these are the bomb!  Super light and delicious!  I mixed up a little glaze but they don't need it.  Will definitely be trying this with other cake flavors soon.

This is great when made with a chocolate cake mix.  I made them into cupcakes. They turned out moist and perfect, and best of all - each one is only 2 points on the WW point plan!

I didn't know how to rate this because I did not make the recipe as written.  After I added other ingredience, I would give it a 4.5.  I didn't have spice cake, so I used a yellow cake mix.  I added 2 jumbo eggs, about 1 tsp cinnamon, about 1 tsp nutmeg, about a cup of chocolate chips, splash of water and about 1/4 cup of sugar.  I buttered a bundt pan and cooked it at 350 for about 45 minutes.  It came out perfect and was delicious.  This is a great base recipe that can be changed up in so many ways and you don't have to measure anything!

Made this today. I also added 1 egg, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 TBS of apple pie spice, 2 TBS of vegetable oil. It baked in 25 minutes. I topped with cream cheese frosting.  It was delicious and did not taste like a box cake at all!

I did modify a little after reading the reviews.  So, in fact I am someone guilty of reviewing a "different" recipe.  I added three eggs, used a carrot cake mix and added one can of sweetened condensed milk.  OMG this was DELISH!!!!  So, I basically made a completely different cake.

I read through all the reviews and decided to try it with the two eggs- I also added 1/2 bag of Nestle's Chocolate Chunk Chips. I was going to add some drizzled chocolate over the top but decided not to. This recipe is AMAZING!

I followed other readers' advice and added 2 eggs and 1/2 cup of applesauce.  The cake was *so moist* to the point that it almost felt uncooked, even though it was cooked thoroughly.  I'd make this again, but next time I'll skip the applesauce.  I'll only add the 2 eggs.

For how quick and easy it is it's fantastic!  I also added 2 eggs and some spices.  It did have a little trouble cooking (I probably ended up cooking it for closer to 35-40 minutes) but it was easy and yummy!

I've tried the pumpkin with brownie mix and it was so-so.  I was expecting the same for this.  But, to my surprise, this was excellent!  I made as it, stirred it with a fork until mixed.  True that it doesn't level out while baking, but it did rise.  It doesn't need frosting, but a cream cheese frosting or whipped topping would work.  Either of those with some cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice mixed in would be good as well.  Definitely a go-to quick, easy and healthier dessert that I will make again!

This is a wonderful recipe and so easy.  I have made it several times and never the same way twice.  I had a yellow cake mix and added pumpkin pie spices.  I had no pumpkin, so I used sweet potato instead.  I added some leftover apple butter and two eggs.  I zested an orange and mixed it into a can of cream cheese icing.  Yummmmm

I would like to comment on what I learned and did with the recipe. Pumpkin can be added to anything to substitute for other ingredients in cake. Pumpkin itself has no taste. Pumpkin adds no flavor if using pure pumpkin only not pumpkin pie mix! I had only added a little of water to can of pumpkin to help get all of the pumpkin out of can. It is very important to use all pumpkin, if not the batter will be very hard to work with. I had no problem mixing it. I only used a spatula to mix it. I decided to use a silicone bunt pan. I used to spatula to drop it in the pan then, I took the bunt pan and picked it up and hit the pan to counter a few times to even out the batter. The batter looked very even then. I will post pictures after done baking. I plan on using canned chocolate icing. I took out all the the nutritional value though. (lol)

So simple and great reviews?  How can this be?  I added two eggs as other suggested, but other than that followed the recipe.  So moist and tasty.  Baked in a bundt pan and baked 45 minutes.  Topped with a cream cheese glaze from this site.  Excellent!

Very good! I did add a splash of vanilla extract and some coconut, and I used carrot cake mix. Extremely easy. Eat them quick though, they don't keep very well. (not that they last!)

A co-worker brought this cake in for us in weight watchers. She used fat free cool whip instead of frosting. Moist, tasty and low in points.

ABSOLUTELY delicious!!!! Baked this for my son's 1st birthday and it made a perfect moist 2-layer cake . . . here's what I added in addition to the two listed ingredients: 1/2 c. applesauce, 3 eggs, 1 1/2 tsp. pumpkin spice blend and 3/4 tsp. cinnamon.  I added a cream cheese/brown sugar/pumpkin spice filling in between the layers and frosted the entire cake with cream cheese frosting.  Wonderfully easy and so tasty . . . will definitely keep this one at the top of my dessert recipes =)

I made this as muffins and sprinkled with powdered sugar.  My 5 year old granddaughter LOVED them!!

Simple to make!  And I heard this is a weight watcher recipe.

Excellent recipe! So easy. I accidentally used 30 oz. can of pumpkin and only one spice cake mix.  I made one batch this way, and one the correct way. They cooked in the same amount of time. Those cookies came out extra moist and I think would make a great loaf of pumpkin bread. However, both sets of cookies were moist and excellent. My kids can't get enough of them! I am running to the store today to stock up on Spice cake mixes while they have them on sale!

Very good, spicy flavor.  However, I cooked it for 43 minutes and it still wasn't done in the center.

I liked this cake, after I added 2 eggs, 1/8 cup sugar and a little cinnamon. I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for 30 minutes. This cake was delicious with cream cheese frosting!

I made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, but I put the batter into mini muffin pans and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes.  These are very sweet and do not have the consistency of cake because of the lack of eggs, but they still were yummy and my kids thought they were even better chilled the next day!

I checked my cake after 25 mins, and the knife came out with lots of mix on it, I checked it again at 30 mins, and the same thing. I followed the original recipe with the exception that I added a tablespoon of water because it was too thick to even mix. What may have gone wrong I dont know. 350 deg. and oven preheated, but it just wouldnt cook all the way through for me.

I used a chocolate cake mix and pumpkin. I added chopped walnuts and pumpkin pie spice. I would make it again except I would use a glaze, icing after baked or add some sugar to the mix because it is not very sweet. Good with ice cream or dessert topping.

I've made this twice now in a little over a week. We love it!  I did add 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin spice just to give it a little extra zing.
 My grandson actually said while licking his lips after the last bite, "Thank you for making that cake, Wela!" If a three-year-old loves it, you know it's good!

The batter was pretty thick. I made about 18 muffins filling the tins about 1/2 to 2/3 full. I sprayed the tins with Pam first. Cooked in a 350 oven about 15-17 min. They were very moist and the spice cake mix added the perfect amount of flavor. On the con side, they were very sticky and the stickiness in my mouth kind of bugged me. I think next time I will do what others suggested and add 2 eggs and see if that helps.

This is especially great if you're watching calories. I make mini cupcakes and top with Cool Whip or Redi-Whip when serving. Must be refrigerated for the best flavor.

So simple, so irresistible! I didn't have a spice cake mix in my pantry, but I did have a sugar-free yellow cake mix, along with a can of pumpkin I needed to use.  I dumped the dry cake mix in a bowl, added a tablespoon of cinnamon and 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice.  I mixed it up, then stirred in my can of pumpkin.  As a finishing touch, I added 2 tsp. of good Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla.  My loaf needed to bake for about 7 min. longer than the directions called for, but it came out great!  This bread is dense, very moist without being heavy, and so flavorful!  What a perfect recipe to make on a lazy, rainy Sunday afternoon. It was literally 5 minutes to assemble and pop in the oven.  It couldn't be easier.  My family loved it and I'll definitely make it again.

Great recipe!  I admit that I added 2 eggs and 1/2 cup (snack size container) of applesauce, but this is still super quick and easy and makes amazing muffins.  With the additions cook for 25 min., and it makes 16 muffins.

Great base, I agree with everyone else, add 3 eggs but if you want to makr it a great Hoilday cake add: the 3 eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, 2 tsp cinnamon,1 tsp. pumpkin spice, 1/2 cup rasins, 1 cup coconut, and a small can of crushed pineapple slightly drained add to prepared pan. Cook 45 to 55 min. in a tube pan or bundt pan, or until toothpick comes out clean.

I messed up and used a large can of pumpkin, so I added brown sugar and cinnamon.  I also added 3 eggs.  Even though I "messed up"  everyone at my party loved the cake. They all wanted my recipe:)

Would give it 5 stars, but it turns out very dense and "creamy" in the center.  I will add eggs next time as others have done and hope it will rise and be a bit more 'fluffy'  I added 1/2 tsp of cloves, 1 tsp nutmeg as well as 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I also used a yellow cake mix, thus the added spices.  Will definitely make again, with a few tweaks next time.

I made this as written and baked in a bundt pan. It was very thick and didn't even out at all so what you put in is what you get. I frosted it with cream cheese frosting that I added some pumpkin pie spice to. The taste is fine, however next time I will take the advise of others and add 2 eggs.

Great Cake - I didn't have a spice cake mix. So I used a yellow cake mix and add 1½ tsp of pumpkin pie spice along with the 2 eggs! Guests loved it too!

This  works Fatastic as cupcakes! to make the tops pretty with a lack of non dairy frosting in the house, I put sprinkled mix of cinnamon and sugar in the raw on top, looked more like muffins, but saved on frosting.

SO delicious! I added three eggs like others suggested and then i frosted it with cream cheese frosting and put a little pumpkin pie spice on top. It's taking a lot of self control to not eat it all right now!!! I will be making this again!

So good and so easy and so fast.  I added 3 eggs after reading the reviews, and I didn't have any problems with the batter being unworkable.  I wanted to add chocolate chips but I didn't have any, so I chopped up some Heath Bars and threw them in. SO SO SO GOOD!

This cake turned out Fantastic! I used Pecan Cake mix, sifted. Added 1/2 cup sugar 2 eggs, maple extract and pumpkin pie filling. I used the whole can which is more than 15 oz baked as instructed adding 15 minutes. For icing I used the base from Chocolate Cherry Cake III and instead of adding the chocolate chips I left as is and poured on the cake. It doesnt cover up any uglies but the top of the cake looked simple and homey. This would make an excellent substitute for pumpkin pie at thanksgiving.

Very quick and easy. I did add pumpkin pie spice and 2 eggs. I added walnuts too but those ended up being a little overwhelming (my own fault) drizzled with vanilla glaze. I will probably make this again

Yum! Very moist and flavorful. I followed others advice and added water to recipe. It came out perfect. I also made a glaze. I used 4tbs of can't believe its not butter spray, 3tbs of splenda brown sugar, 2tbs of honey and 3/4 teaspoon of orange extract. simmered for about 5mins. cooled and then poured over cake. My family raved over this. I will be using this method from now on.

I figured what the heck I had those ingredients. I did take the advice like many other reviewers have in regards to adding 3 eggs. I followed mostly what member Copetenn stated in his review and used his glaze and my family liked this.  I love it because it is soooooo easy and sooo quick!!! Thanks!!!

So easy and moist!  I loved this cake;  I altered the recipe slightly by adding 1/2 tbsp. of pumpkin pie spice and 1 c. sweetened applesauce.  It spread easily in the pan and mixed up just fine for me.  This is a great recipe to make for the holidays.  I used a cream cheese frosting.  Delicious!

I made this with a package of french vanilla cake mix and 2 cups of fresh pureed pumpkin and some spices, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. I made it in muffin tins and it came out perfect. They were very dense and moist, almost too much so for my taste, but the flavor was wonderful. My fiance loved them so I am giving them 5 stars instead of 4. I might try adding an egg next time just to see how the texture may change.

5 stars for ease and taste.  I didn't change a thing except baked as cupcakes for 17 minutes.  My picky 9 y.o. thought they were awesome and ate 1 when I fixed them and then 2 for breakfast the next day.  I just served them plain.  We've all eaten them including my 2 y.o. who eats like a bird, and she ate almost a whole one.  I put cream cheese frosting on a couple just to see how it would go as a dessert and it was delicious.  However, we ate all the rest without icing and they're gone now.  It's a dense batter but that's the beauty of only a 2 ingredient cake!  I'm thinking this has to be semi-healthy because of no eggs, butter, oil, etc.  I won't be making these every week; however it WILL be in my arsenal!  Maybe every month or 2.  I would like to try it with a devils food mix next.

Thought this was too good to be true but tried it and it was wonderful! I couldn't find boxed Spice Cake so I used Butter Pecan, just as good as spice would have been. I drizzeled it with cream cheese frosting and  chopped pecans. Because some people complained about thickness I added just a bit more pumpkin than 15 oz, the batter was like any cake batter and the resulting cake was amazingly moist!

Fast and easy! There are egg allergies in my family so this is something I can make and take to family function and everybody can enjoy.  It comes out moist and even the kids like it.  I have made this as a cake and also as muffins. I prefer the muffins, they are great even without frosting!

so easy and so delicious. was a hit with my family.  this is a keeper for when ppl come over and i need to make something quick.  i topped it with store bought cream cheese icing, found the icing too sweet so next time i plan to make my own home made cream cheese icing.  but this is very moist, and very yummy! i also added to the spice cake mix, a tsp of pumpkin spice.  :)

I took the advice of others and added the 2 eggs, I also added a dash of vanilla extract.  To frost and decorate I made orange frosting using a store bought cream cheese frosting and orange and green food coloring.  I also baked the cake in a bundt pan using the baking temp and time chart on the back of the box. Everyone enjoyed this cake at our halloween party :)

OMG. This is the best recipe ever! I didn't have spice cake mix so I used vanilla. I added in 1 t cinnamon, 1/3 t cloves, nutmeg, and ginger. I also made a cream cheese frosting and sprinkled cinnamon on top. When I read that this was really moist I had trouble believing it. Please believe it! When you want to make a dessert and really don't feel like making alot of mess this would be so easy.

I have made this cake using angelfood cake mix and prepared pumpkin pie filling.  It was very good but next time I will used reg. pumpkin with pie spices added.  The only coment I need to make, is do not beat with electric beaters as the angelfood cake get too much air and will rise well over the top of a bundt pan.  I love it topped with whipped cream.  Yummy and good for you too  I give it 5 stars

Since joining Weight Watchers over 1 year ago and having wonderful results with better food choices the recipe I use has nothing more than 4 Tbs.(1/4 C.water) added to make 12 muffins WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO SPRAY MUFFIN TIN & DO NOT USE CUPCAKE LINERS. A WW point value of 2 without icing.

Made as directed with one exception.  I took advice of another reader and added some water to make it easy to stir.  It turned out moist and tasty.  For those who added eggs, I think that defeats the purpose of making this a healthy alternative to regular cakes.  I did then frost it with cream cheese frosting. Mmmm.

I made them just as stated, I normally use chocolate cake mix and make them as brownies. In my opinion this recipe does not make a cake but it makes bars or brownies as written. I did add pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon and mini choc chips, it was good but I prefer this recipe as cookies.

For what this is I think it was good. The consistency is a bit strange of course. How could it not be?:) I made them as cupcakes and cooked for 20 minutes. I think if I made them as cupcakes again I would scoop them with an ice cream scooper to make the shape better. The flavor was decent though and with a simple frosting I think would be nice cake. Thanks.

This cake made as directed is delicious, low fat and easy.  It is hard to stir together, but worth the elbow grease.  We like to add about a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter and frost with cream cheese frosting.  You can also make a two ingredient chocolate cake!  Just use a chocolate cake mix with your can of pumpkin.  Trust me, you will never taste the pumpkin!  It is just a moist, delicious chocolate cake without the eggs and oil.  I also like to add chocolate chips to the chocolate version, and frost with vanilla frosting or cream cheese.

The only reason I gave this a 4 is because of the appearance.  It is a very thick batter and it doesn't spread very nicely.  The flavor is awsome and it is very moist!  Will definately make this again.

OMG this cake is AMAZING!!!!  I tried not to change it up too much, but i did add one egg and some splenda as well.  I drizzled on a glaze as suggested by others...1/4 confectioners sugar, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg and 2 tbsp of milk.  This cake is a must during the holidays!!!!

Some may think this is just an ordinary cake.  I added about 2/3 cup of water and it turned out really good.  Some people are missing the POINT.  This is a Fat Free cake and is good for dieters especially Weight Watchers that are counting POINTS. Great for Holidays.

After taking the advice from others I also added 2 eggs, really eggbeaters, and a  1/4 c sugar.  I also added a few shakes of cloves, ground allspice, and nutmeg and a tbs of vanilla.  It was still easy to make and tasted great with cream cheese frosting.

I did as suggested by others, added 2 eggs, also a small splash of oil.  It was super moist & very tasty.  Next time I will add more pumpkin, some applesauce (or maybe just the applesauce -mmm), and no oil; I don't think it needed it afterall.  I used a cream-cheese rum glaze from this website - and it was FANTASTIC as my step-dad's birthday cake!  Thanks much - I'll be having fun with this "starter" idea!

I've made this recipe before adding 3/4 to 1 cup water to thin the batter out. I baked this (after adding the water and about a two tsp. of additional pumpkin pie spice) in a 12 muffin tin for about 25 minutes and they turned out wonderfully.  Moist and delish!  Thanks for reminding me of a great recipe that I've enjoyed in the past.

Love this cake/muffin.  I use the extra eggs when I make it as a cake. But when I use it for muffins I put no eggs in and I add mini choco chips.  I then use an ice cream scoop to place in tin-foil muffin cups (no muffin tin needed that way I can bake them all in one batch on a cookie sheet).  So easy to make and be a bit new when the usual coffee cake is expected.

Tried this today! The store was out of spice cake mix, so I used a box of Trader Joe's truffle brownie mix. I added 2 eggs, can of pumpkin and a little cinnamon to the mix. It made 12 muffins and they are incredibly fudgey and delicious. The original box called for 2 eggs and an entire stick of butter - so happy to have found this healthy option! Thanks!!! I will try it again when I can get my hands on some spice cake mix.

This IS so easy!  I made them in a muffin pan and we ate them for breakfast!  I did add the eggs as others had suggested and also added a streusel topping.  I think next time I make them, I'll add a layer of cream cheese in the middle.  Definitely a keeper for my family!

Awesome for what it is...a super easy emergency type cake. Can also use a carrot cake mix and add 1/2-1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  Has better texture with adding 2-3 eggs but if cholesterol and fat are an issue for you, is ok without.  Best mixed with a high quality food processor or mixer and spread with a plastic spatula to make a smooth surface.

I used a Reduced Sugar Yellow cake mix (Pillsbury) and added cinnamon and Pumpkin pie spice to it. I added dry egg whites (=2eggs) and one whole egg for needed protein also added about 1/2 cup water. Skipped oil...as that's a big no no. Sprinkled the top with Sugar In The Raw. Bake it up in a tube pan. It was very good and DH ate his with ice cream and hot caramel sauce. Great warmed up!

Very good! I did add the sugar and milk that was suggested. It was very good-I put a tub of vanilla frosting on the top and it was a hit with my whole family. I am going to try it with the cream cheese frosting the next time I make it.

I made this with home-cooked pumpkin, which may be moister than canned pumpkin, so didn't need to add anything to the batter.  The cake was lovely with a little glaze.  Tried it again using home-cooked butternut squash, again with excellent results.  Thanks for this recipe!

One of the moistest pumpkin cakes I have ever made.  I went with a bundt pan in making it.  Also I added in 1/4 c flour, 3 eggs and 1/3 c water.  
Will be serving it with a caramel walnut sauce.

This cake blew me away.  I was looking for a pumpkin spice cake that was easy to make and was inspired by all of the great reviews for this one.  I gave it a try using the highly recommended modification of 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, 3 eggs, and a bit of pumpkin pie seasoning.

With the applesauce and canned pumpkin, this cake is just so incredibly moist and delicious.  I brought it to an event and people went nuts... I've never had that kind of genuine reaction to something I've made.  People told me they'd gone back and had two or three squares.  Yes, it's that good.  And since it's make ahead by design, it's the best thing ever for busy holiday meals.

Love that it's only 2 ingredients -- I keep a can of pumpkin and spice cake on hand just in case I need a quick dessert.  Very moist and dense.  Just made this tonight and received compliments....no could believe it was only 2 ingredients!!

As written, this recipe doesn’t deserve one star. With one star it would mean it is edible and didn’t have to be thrown out. 
For this recipe to work, it would take way more ingredients than two. But then the person who came up with this waste of time  couldnt have come up with a gimmicky name.
This isn’t the first time I’ve made recipes that are rated higher than they deserve because they’re rated on the improvements. I’m seriously thinking about deleting this website ...... grrrrrr okay okay, rant done ... sorry!

This is a SUPER easy and yummy recipe. A box of spice cake mix and a can of pumpkin. I followed a few suggestions, and added three eggs, some applesauce and pumpkin pie seasoning. The cream cheese frosting MAKES the cake as well. I will continue to make this recipe through out the fall season. =)

so easy! I didn't add any of the extras, just put the pumpkin and the spice cake mix in a Ziploc bag, kneaded to mix, and then snipped a corner and squeezed it into the pan.  came out moist and just sweet enough. great way to save on calories and fat

Don't  judge me.  I modified the recipe and I'm still giving it 5 stars.  Made it twice--once to test  on my co-workers and again for my family at Thanksgiving.  Both times got rave reviews and an empty cake dish to take home.  
Based on other reviews, I added 2 eggs, 1/4 cup of sugar (which I add to all my box based cakes), 1/4 cup vegetable oil and 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.   I baked it in a 9x13 pan and it was perfect and moist.  It was still hard to spread in the pan but I used the back of a spoon to help. 
Pumpkin is not my favorite but this cake will be added to my rotation.

As is, this recipe is dry and flavorless. I added 2 eggs per others suggestions. It still came out fairly dry and didn't have much flavor in the way of pumpkin. If I make again I will definitely add some more spice and sugar.

This is easy to throw together, though the batter is hard to with with because it's so stiff.  It does not rise - how it looks when you put it in the oven is how it will look when it comes out.  I poked holes in the cake after baking and poured a can of condensed milk all over, and let it settle into the cake. Then I frosted with whipped cream. Definitely a do-again recipe for me.

This was a hit for me this holiday. I followed Jolie's directions by adding: 3 eggs, half cup applesauce, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon and baked in a 9x13 pan. Everyone loved it! This is going to be a new tradition.

I made this cake today. But I actually used a Dunkin Hines Decadent carrot cake mix. I took others advice and added 2 eggs.  It mixed beautifully as well as spread nicely in my pan. I made cream cheese frosting from this site and added a bit of pumpkin pie spice to it.  I got rave reviews on it. It was so moist and the flavor rich. I will be adding this to my cookbook of fabulous desserts so I will be making it again and again!!!
Thanks!

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I added other ingredients.  I used the suggestion of another reviewer and added 3 eggs, and 1/2 cup of applesAuce.  My own addition was 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract.  After the cake cooled I frosted it with whipped cream cheese frosting and refrigerated it for 2 hours before serving.  By refrigert eating the cake i was able to slice it easily.  I took it to a function and ias a huge hit.

OH my gosh! I'm so glad I found this. I made it with a chocolate chocolate chip muffin mix, the can of pumpkin, and about 1/4c of almond milk to thin it out just a bit. Baked it in a 9 X 9 glass pan for about 35 min at 350. It was amazing! 
My husband usually balks when I make anything that's 'better for us', but this disappeared really quick. Can't wait to make it with the spice cake mix. Thanks for sharing!

I was surprised that I could make a cake with just a cake mix and a can of pumpkin! I made homemade chocolate icing, everyone finished the cake by the end of the day! I would rather use my mixer next time to have a fluffier texture.

Turned out great, however, made a few changes. Only had a box of yellow cake mix and fresh roasted butternut squash, so used what I had on hand instead. Added 1/2 cup water and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Family loved it.

I used a white cake mix and added my own spices -- cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and about 1 tablespoon of spiced rum. The batter is a little difficult to spread but it ends up doing fine with some patience.

I made this last Thanksgiving and it was wonderful! I used spice cake mix and topped it with sprinkles. No icing needed. But, for the life of me, I haven't been able to find spice cake this year, so I bought carrot cake and am about to try it with that. What I've read says it is equally good, so I can't wait!

So Easy....So Delish !!  Accented it with only a very thin layer of ready to spread cream cheese frosting to take to an event, because it did, look a bit unlevel... like a brownie --  Once covered-you couldn't see it....bit of vanilla ice cream or Cool Whip would be a nice touch as well. As is-Perfect! As you could see, bit into and tasted before rating. Why add anything? It would spoil the simplicity....lol  Thank You for Sharing!

I made this cake using other recommendations; I added 3 eggs and 1/2 cup applesauce and substituted the cinnamon with pumpkin pice spice. I was the moistest and most delicious pumpkin cake I have ever had! Everyone loved it. Next time I may add chocolate chips for a bit more deliciousness!!

Very good and easy! I made them into cupcakes (made 18) and they were very moist. They came out exactly like I wanted. All I did different was add a teaspoon of vanilla.

LOVE this recipe. My son is allergic to everything and have been making his cakes with soda, but he would always complain that they were crumbly. Not with this recipe! I add some pumpkin spice, nutmeg and cinnamon and I did a 2 egg substitute and it was moist and delicious! So excited to have a solve - will be trying other combinations of maybe chocolate box cake with beets or peaches or something! Thank you tons!

I make this cake when I have little time and need something fast. everyone loves it the only thing I do different is add about a half cup of walnuts....some times just on top if not going to frost or in the cake and frost it with cream cheese frosting...both ways are good.

Tried recipe. Batter very thick. Hard to pour into pan. Cake crumbly, not moist. Did NOT like :-(

I have to concur... the batter was a nightmare as directed, so I felt like I had to add extra eggs to have something resembling a cake batter... even then, it was quite difficult to get into the pan evenly.  The taste was fine, though it neither "popped" with pumpkin flavor or had the kind of homestyle crumb that good pumpkin quick breads do well.  I think next time (if there is a next time) I will add a stick of melted butter and amp up the spices or even use something more creative like a chocolate cake mix. Too late to make something else tonight, so my choir will have to eat this as a treat regardless.

Pretty good! I added 1/4 cup of water and 3 eggs. It was very hard to mix (Make sure you mix it well or you will get bites with the crunch of the cake mix). Baked for 35 minutes and topped with a glaze, although it didn't really need it. Next time, I will add chopped pecans to the cake mix and just dust with cinnamon and powdered sugar.

The only reason why I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because I added some stuff to it to make it better. It is a good variation though so you don't use oil and you feel a little less guilty going in for the 2nd (or 3rd) helping.

I added 3 eggs, 1/4 sugar, and a teaspoon and a half of pumpkin pie spice. When first taking it out of the oven it is very dry like some people said. If you're serving right away I would only add 2 eggs. The next day, however, the consistency was amazing and now on day 3 it is perfect! Plan on making pumpkin spice french toast tomorrow with the rest of it :)

I was looking for something easy and I had no eggs.  The cakemix and pumpkin I had.  Went by the original recipe and it was wonderful.  My guests loved it.  Will make it again and again.  It also freezes well.
Can be made in loaves.  I made several small loaves and gave as gifts to my neighbors.

good recipe - I accidentally added a 30 oz can of pumpkin and it came out more like pumpkin pie consistency with an outer crust.  I used a brown sugar glaze over the top.  Turned out well.

It doesn’t get much easier than 2 ingredients.  I mixed this up and used a Bundt® cake pan rather than a 13 x 9.  It baked nicely and came out of the pan without any sticking.  It had a more dense texture and was very moist.  After the cake had cooled I frosted it with ‘Caramel Frosting VI’ from AR.  A simple cake that I would make again.

like others said what you see in the pan when it goes into the oven is what comes out.  I had hoped-because I didn't read the reviews before making- that the very thick batter would spread out in the pan and even out a bit while baking and it didn't.  The taste is good, nothing fancy.  I topped it with an allspice cream cheese frosting, that made it more presentable.  But it is a very flat cake...more like fluffy bars!  I made it as my contribution to our volunteer fire stations soup supper and it will work for that, I am sure people will eat it.

I agree with adding two eggs. Made mini muffins first for work and had rave reviews. Also use for holiday mini pumpkin loaf cakes that are moist and delicious. I serve with cream cheese frosting on the side so people can eat with or without. This recipe is delicious, easy and quick. Great for office party or other gathering where you need something that is make ahead and travels well.

I made this as cookies for a cookie exchange at work.I used pumpkin pie mix instead of canned pumpkin(bought it by mistake).The batter was not stiff like some of the reviews said. I did have to increase the baking time by about 2-3 minutes.Very easy and tasted good! I will make this again!

I made this recipe and baked the batter in a muffin pan.  Got about 16 regular sized muffins from the recipe.  Baked at 350 for 20-24 minutes.  They taste really great and it's a recipe I can remember at the store when shopping for ingredients.  

The second time I made them, I added cream cheese frosting.  But they are good plain as well!

It's okay.  It comes out dense, but pretty tasty.  It's a good alternative if you want a low cal dessert.  I also make it into muffins, rather than as a cake.

I have to admit I was skeptical about this recipe.  But, I decided to try it anyway.  The only extra ingredient I added was 1/2 cup of water, based on some of the other reviews I read.  I was very impressed with this cake!  It was moist and delicious and will definitely be making this again!

Tried two variations on this recipe yesterday, for a local bake sale today.  Both results were excellent!

Two staples in my pantry are  canned pumpkin PIE filling for quick desserts, and canned solid pumpkin.  The recipe using the PIE filling was wet enough, the eggs weren’t required.  The cake was moist and delicious, a definite keeper recipe.  The other recipe using straight canned pumpkin with the suggested two extra eggs, using yellow cake mix (didn’t have a second box of spiced on hand), adding 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, and made wonderful cupcakes.

I love these quick desserts using pantry staples.  Great recipes; thank you for sharing!

I only had a yellow cake mix, so I used that, and I added about 1/2 tsp. Chinese 5-Spice Powder, which made it really tasty. My pumpkin was from fresh that I had cooked and pureed last year, so I didn't measure it exactly, but I am guessing it was about 2-2 1/2 cups.  It was also thinner than canned pumpkin, so it mixed easily. I also added some ground flaxseed for fiber, and it was really, really good!  Both ingredients were easy to stir in, so it was almost as easy as just two ingredients.

Love this recipe...I did make it again with a few changes that I thought made it exceptional!  I used the Duncan Hines golden yellow cake mix, added pumpkin pie spice to taste, and 2 tablespoons of melted butter (it looked thick and I thought it needed to thin out a bit).  Turns out the butter made it extremely moist and this is now my family's FAVORITE pumpkin dessert of ALL TIME!!!!

This is my new favorite!  Made this last night and it was super yummy.  Added raisins and walnuts and put a simple confectioners sugar glaze on top.  It took longer to bake than noted (70 mins at 375), but baked up nice and high.  My only issue is that it doesn't slice, it just kind of falls apart, so no pumpkin bread toast for breakfast :(  I'm wondering if that is due to the absense of eggs.  BUT, all said, those are not deal breakers and it will definately get a repeat performance!

I debated even adding this to my recipe box since it's just two ingredients (though did add 2 eggs as other reviewers recommend). Topped with the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting from this site. A spectacular combo, especially considering how very, very easy it all was to make!!

Loved it!  I added two eggs, two tablespoons of butter and half bag of Nestle mini chocolate chips.  My first time doing this, I opted for cupcakes.  Impressed and ready to do it again and to experiment.  Like with applesauce instead of pumpkin.  Or with carrot cake mix.  These little muffins remind me of something I used to make (long ago) with a starter that grew in the refrigerator.  That had to be fed and baked every (?) ten days.  This is much easier.

Emergency Situation! No eggs in the house and dd needed a snack for a field trip she failed to tell us about til too late to go to the store. SO I used a vanilla mix and bananas rather than the pumpkin and added some cinnamon. I wasn't overly hopeful but it turned out great! I poked holes and added some powdered sugar glaze while it was still hot. Really yummy and my daughter thinks I am all that! Awesome!

Thanks for this easy recipe. I followed the directions but added 1/2 cup water as someone else suggested and I used what I had in the pantry (Pillsbury Moist Supreme Devil's Food mix). I baked it for 30 minutes in a 13x9 inch pan and  will frost it with Pillsbury sugar free chocolate fudge frosting once it has cooled. Will be making  this again with the spice cake mix.

When I was organizing my pantry I came across a box of spice cake, wasn't sure what to do with it so I came to AR to find something delicious and easy to do with it. This seemed like an interesting recipe and super easy so I went with this. Then I changed it. I had also found a box of pumpkin spice pudding so I added that into the mix, then added 3 eggs, and about a cup of cinnamon chips. Baked this in 2 9 inch pans for 25 minutes, frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting (AR) and dusted with cinnamon. Yummy. Gotta love the cleaning out pantry days! Thanks for the recipe!

Love this! I added 3 eggs and with icing I think this cake tastes like a pumpkin roll (but way less work!) Will try these as cookies with chocolate chips some time as well baking them 15-20 min.

I definitely agree with some other reviewers and I added 2 eggs, about a 1/4 cup of sugar and a little vanilla extract.  It turned out wonderful! I actually made cupcakes and they really were perfect. I will definitely make this recipe again, with my variations.

We made them as cookies following the recipe except cooking it as cookies for about 15 minutes.  We also made mini-cupcakes following the recipe and adding 2 eggs.  We enjoyed both the mini-cupcakes and the cookies.  We frosted some and left some plain and all were delicious.  It was an easy tasty recipe.  My 8 year old son made the cookies and my 9 year old daughter made the mini cupcakes.  They used hand mixers as it was hard to stir the pumpkin into the cake mix without the mixer.  We will be adding this to our kid friendly cooking.

I used a "No Name" Spice Cake Mix and found it to be kinda bitter tasting and not really very good.  I will try it again with a name brand and see how it goes.  Will leave another rating then.    I also added 2 eggs and a cup of chopped pecans.  No doubt I will finish them up but I'm not eager to give them to anyone else.

I made these as cookies before, and they are much better as cookies versus cake.  I followed the recommendations of the folks here who suggested adding three eggs to make it more cake-like.  I also threw in a dash of pumpkin spice and ginger to the mix.  I got alot of compliments for it.

Very good! I only gave it 4 stars because I did make changes that others have recommened. So I can't really rate it on the original recipe. I added 2 eggs, 1/2 cup of applesauce and some cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice. Came out very delicious! I used a Cool Whip frosting also found on the site and it added a very light, fluffy topping. I think this cake definately needs to be frosted.

I enjoyed this but I did add the three eggs and thinned with a bit of fat free milk. Extremely moist cake and it is quite delicious. We added a thin layer of cream cheese frosting, but still delicious even without it. I used fresh pumpkin because I had gotten a small sugar pumpkin in my CSA box. So yummy!!!

The first time I made this, I added the eggs as suggested by other reviewers.  It turned out great!  This time, I followed exactly and it was terrific!  Will just stick with the 2 ingredients next time.

Since there is no canned pumpkin to be found in my area, I switched out winter squash for the pumpkin.  Turned out pretty close to the same!  Definitely needs frosting though.  Yummy way to add veggies to a treat!

Easy to make. But not sold on them. The texture is not the best. But my husband LOVES them. I think they are NOT a very pretty cookie to look at. I like looks and taste. This one works when your in a hurry. (a helpful note. Finding can pumpkin is not easy to find when its NOT thanksgiving. Look in the spice area, and near the canned fruit toppings. You CAN NOT find them in the can food section.)

I used a carrot cake mix instead of a spice cake and it was a little bland, I would definitly add 1/2 c sugar next time like other members have said and I did add 3 large eggs and the texture of the cake was very good.

A good quick thing to have.  I found it doesn't keep well, though, as it gets too wet.  Good taste.  Very dense.

I have made this numerous times, but I usually make as mini loaves or muffins.  Always a hit and I have given the "recipe" to many people.  I do sometimes add walnuts and/or raisins, but plain is also great.  If the batter seems too thick, try adding small amounts of water until it's mixed.  I haven't tried with icing, but that seems to defeat the purpose of a low fat/low cal alternative to cake.  Worth a try either way!!

I've only done this as cookies with a choc cake mix.  You can use any type of cake mix and the flavor will be the cake mix flavor..lemon makes lemon cookies..choc cookies with sugar free pudding and fat free cool whip makes a good low cal desert.

I make this according to the original recipe but sometimes add some plumped raisins or even a few chopped nuts.  No icing needed!  We think this is an ideal dessert for those watching their calories.

A huge hit at the office! This always goes quickly. Even a co-worker who dislikes pumpkin asked for the recipe. I do add 1 egg, use fresh pumpkin when available, then frost using the "Vanilla Glaze" recipe from this site. So far, I've made with spice cake, carrot cake and devil's food cake with a touch of cinnamon. Thank you!

This is a great recipe! I couldn't belive the results were so good from just the three ingredients ( i added two eggs to mine) I drizzled it with just a little bit of icing and delish! This is going to be a great dessert to make for a quick fix in the future!

As written the recipe was not a hit.  I made again adding 2 eggs, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and they were a HUGE hit.  They are my standard "pumpkin pie muffins" and everyone that tries them RAVES about how amazing they are.  Still a super easy recipe.  I bring it to every holiday gathering.  I have also served them as cupcakes frosted with cream cheese frosting and even though they were just as well received and loved, I prefer them unfrosted.

As above, this cake is the BEST.  It is without a doubt a 5 star.  I have used both a spice cake mix and a carrot cake mix.  Both went over well.  I did add two eggs and I used confectioner's sugar rather than icing.  I have made it for potlucks, for picnics, for the family, or just my husband and I.  In Erie, PA, when it gets chilly, damp and cold, it is a great comfort food with coffee after doing those pesky leaves.

Like other reviewers- I used 2 eggs, 1/3 cup water, Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Spice Cake Mix, 1/4tsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice and a dash of cinnamon. I know with these additions it is no longer "2 ingredient pumpkin cake" but it is still really easy and turns out great. I frosted it with store bought cream cheese frosting which I think is needed for just a little more sweetness.

I made this with a chocolate cake and you can't tell this was not made with egg or oil.If you have any trouble working with the batter just spray your spatula with cooking spray! FANTASTIC and so much better for you. My family loves this and leaves nothing left. Its a great way to add a vegetables and get your kids to eat it. Thanks for posting this!! Diet Friendly to the maxxxx!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit!  I used Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe spice cake mix, the can of pumpkin, added 2 eggs and 1/3 cup of water and baked in a bundt pan.  I frosted it with store-bought cream cheese frosting and topped it with sliced almonds.  It was so moist and delicious that there wasn't any left by the end of the evening.  I will definitely make it every year!

Very, very tasty. Falls apart easily - could use an egg. I used fresh pumpkin vs. canned.  But I got my husband to eat (and like) pumpkin!!

These are good. I added about 1/2 cup of chopped pecans & a 1/2 a cup or so of dried cranberries, 2 eggs & about 1/4 cup of splenda. I put the batter in muffin tins instead of a 9x13 pan so that they would be more muffin-like. I topped with powdered sugar but I feel sure they would be fantastic with cream cheese frosting. Thanks for a good basic recipe to build on!

I have made this recipe before that was given to me by a friend. I do not add eggs, I add a half cup of milk! It is wonderful with cool whip on it!

I added two eggs, then thought it wasn't spicy enough so I added  1/4t cinnamon, 1/4t clove, &   1/8t nutmeg. Also added 1 cup raisins and some chopped pecans, then dusted with powdered sugar after baking. Very light and yummy.

I don't like pumpkin and was asked to bring something pumpkin for Thanksgiving.  

Following the recommendations I added three eggs.  I put this in a bundt pan, and drizzled with cream cheese frosting.

I had several people ask for the recipe.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe.  My sister has been making this (along with her diet coke cake) for quite a few years.  After I tried this recipe I made it for a potluck and everyone loved it.  I recommend using cool whip as a frosting, it's Very Tasty!!!

I made this with a carrot cake mix and added the 3 eggs.  It turned out really good.  But now I know why they said to add some sugar, it can be a little bland.  But because I frosted it with a little buttercream frosting, it was perfect.  I think another recipe called "3 ingredient pumpkin cake" would be more appropriate.  Next time, I might add a little salt and not put on the frosting.

Great recipe!!! I set aside approx 1/2 c cake mix and mixed w/ 3T butter and sprinkled on top. Also, did what was suggested, added 2 eggs and 1/2 c sugar and 1/2 applesauce and used a little less pumpkin.  It added a nice and sweet touch. Next time I will try out the jelly roll idea w/o the additions.

I've made this recipie many times before as muffins.  The only thing I do different is to add a bag of cinnamon chips (in the same place as the chocolate chips if you can find them).  They are so good.  It makes 12 good sized muffins.

I love pumpkin but this was disappointing...I'm always looking for a healthier version of foods we love but this just didn't cut it.  Maybe it would have been better with homemade icing to add a little something special...I'm sorry.

Even though the title of this recipe is Two-Ingredients, I couldn't help but add a few things after reading all the reviews. I added 3 eggs, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 cup applesauce, a little skim milk at the end to make a smoother consistency. I also added 1 cup each: raisins, chopped pecans, and mini chocolate chips. It tasted except for there being too much chocolate, it covered up the taste of the cake itself. This dessert didn't go over well and I won't be making it again.

This is awesome and easy. I did add an egg and some extra spices and a little water to thin out. I put it in a greased bundt pan and frosted it with a cream cheese icing off this site. To die for! Just what a fall sweet tooth needs. Thanks a bunch!

I have made this recipe twice.  I did not add anything but I had to cook it about an hour longer.  I put a powdered frosting on it after it completely cooled.  I will give this recipe a 4 star rating.  :)

Made this into a "loaf/bread".  I followed other reviewers suggestions and added 2 eggs and 1 C choc chips, some chopped walnuts and a dash of ginger and cinnamon.  It turned out delicious and was very moist!  It did take about 60 mins to bake at 350.

Sure, it came up fairly moist, and reasonably textured, but it certainly needed some pumpkin pie-ish spices.  I'll try it again with some cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger, at the least...

This is definately a keeper. I did make the changes like other reviewers suggested, by adding sugar milk and eggs. I also baked in a jelly roll pan and topped with cream cheese frosting and drizzled with caramel. It was sooo good and sooo easy.

Super Simple!  I added the eggs as others suggested.  I iced it with store bought cream cheese icing and everyone loved it.  Moist, tasty, and will make you look like you slaved in the kitchen, when you really only opened 1 box, 1 can, blended and baked.

Made it for Holloween, and followed other's advice for adding 2 eggs. I don't know if it's my oven or the altitude, but I had to cook it for 40-45 minutes.

Used the cream cheese frosting and YUMMY! I usually don't like cake that much, but I love this!

This was very good.  I added two eggs and some chocolate chips.  Next time I will add some pumpkin pie spice since I was going for something w/more pumpkin flavor. This was tasty but didn't have a strong pumpkin taste- I will make this again. Thanks for posting.

I've  already planned to make it again because it was great . I didn't  have  a spice cake mix so I used a white mix. I added the can  of pumpkin ,half a cup of sugar, 2 eggs,  and 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice. My mother, my husband, and  I  all loved it .  So moist.

I made this and added chocolate chips. It looks like a huge chocolate chip cookie. It wasn't like normal cake batter. I am horrible at cooking and baking. Either I screwed up somewhere or not being able to spread the batter is normal. I used my points to get a free pie because I feel like I failed.

In High School Home Economics I was taught to “Trust the Recipe”.  Today I did. I added 1/2 cup pecans. I drizzled a creme cheese frosting over it at the end. 
It’s ugly coming out of the oven. Hence the drizzled icing. It’s a weird texture. 
I use my husband as taste tester. He said ok but not his favorite. Will I make it again? No.

I created my own version after reading other reviews. I used the spice cake directions but added 1/4 cup of pumpkin and 1 tablespoon of sour cream and 1/4 teaspoons of cinnamon. Bake in sheet cake. Frosting was 4 ounces of cream cheese, a stick of butter,3 cups of powdered sugar, 1 teaspoons of vanilla, and 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie seasoning. Add a couple Tb milk. Mix until smooth. Came out really good.

I followed the advice of others and added 2 eggs and 1/4 cup of sugar and 2 shakes of pumpkin pie spice. Next time I'll add more spice to it and yes I'll make it again. It was so moist everyone loved it and the cream cheese frosting was perfect with it.

I guess i'm something of a purist. if a recipe is good as written, I don't see a reason to fix it.  guess I'll never know what i'm missing, but this one is great just the way it is. easy to make, and tastes great.  my wife has tried to mimic the recipe with carrot cake and spices when she couldn't get a packaged spice cake.

Super easy and yummy.  I did add 2 eggs as others suggested and baked in a Bundt cake pan.  I sprinkled with powered sugar rather than frosting.  It came out lovely!  I will make this again.  My 8 year old grandson thought it was the best!

I halved the recipe made the other half into regular cake muffins. This was great I used an 8x8 pan instead of the 9x13 since I was only using have the cake mix and have the can of pumpkin. Thank you for such an easy recipe to follow.

Yes I made changes. Instead of making this as a cake I made it as muffins. Added chopped walnuts and white chocolate chips. Lots of compliments. Made this for a cookie exchange at Christmas time. It's really good however it must be refrigerated because I used fresh organic pumpkin made by Farmers Market. Can be purchased at Honest Coop. It's even better when it is chilled. You can enjoy this at any time of the day.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. Iced with a cream cheese icing. Yes, the batter is very thick. Yes, the time it takes to bake is very short. But don’t be tempted to bake any longer. The result was a moist cake that everyone loved. My guests were fighting over the leftovers.  Definitely will make it again. So easy!

After reading some of the reviews, I added egg substitute to equal 2 eggs, 1/4 cup of sugar and a dash of pumpkin pie spice.  I didn't frost it, I mixed powdered sugar with pumpkin pie spice and dusted the top of the cake when it was still warm.  Delicious!!

I am giving 5 stars even though I;m not sure how it would be "if done as written" because I did not use a 9 x 13 pan but a loaf pan and never would get done in the center. It was like eating a roast  well on the ends and rare in the center, but a good taste. I will make again in a 9x13 pan.

What could be simpler???  Terrific recipe made just as written!  I was tempted to additional spices, but didn't.  I found that it didn't need anything extra!  If it seems difficult to spread and sticks to the spatula, just spray your spatula with a bit of cooking spray.  Treat it as though you're making brownies!

I used a chocolate cake mix and added 3 eggs, and a little instant coffee for moisture and additional richness.  My son loves these but noted they have a spongier texture than our usual recipe.  While I usually like to bake from scratch, this is a great short cut and a healthier alternative.  Topped with a chocolate ganache.

Per everyone's suggestions, I added the following,  3 eggs, 1/2 cup of water,  1 tbsp of pumpkin pie spice.
And to add my personal touch, I also added 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup of rum soaked cranberry cranberries.
May need to add more spice and water.
Makes 6 -1 cup mini loaves.
My Godmother always made bread for the holidays, but passed this year. I hope to carry on the tradition, with my own added touch. Get those family recipes before it's too late!

Super easy! I added 3 eggs and chocolate chips. I was a little scared because the batter doesn’t have the same consistency as a normal cake batter, but it comes out perfect. Then I did a simple vanilla glaze to make it pretty!

This was the easiest cake and it was so tasty. I put some cream cheese frosting on it and took it to work for our Halloween luncheon. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. This will a staple recipe in our house.

I made this dessert September 16, 2017 and I added just a little bit of ground cloves, ground ginger and a little brown sugar and it turned out soooooooo delicious ~ 

It is easy and very good.  I frosted it with cream cheese vanilla frosting and it's just a great dessert all the way around. 

From now on, this will be one of my favorite Fall time and Thanksgiving dessert.

Try it, you'll like it..........excuse me, you'll LOVE it!

The point of this recipe is for it to be HEALTHIER, if you didn't realize it reading the ingredients then don't review the recipes and change it to what you want and complain about it.   Its cake box mix and pumpkin puree, of course its not going to mix like when you add the extra ingredients!  
  Yes, it will be a little difficult to mix, spoon drop into pan and spread to the best of your ability. 
   Its just as great with Devils food cake mix and the pumpkin puree alone, my fiance does not like to "eat healthy" and his cakes must be moist, he was shocked when i told him ingredients, and yes, he did like it.

Made this for a fun little weeknight treat for my family, and was surprised at how tasty it was. Topped it with Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting from this site and they were delightful together. I did go ahead and add two eggs when I made this because I wanted more of a "cakey" cake, rather than a dense "gingerbread"-type consistency. Either would have been good though. Did not have a spice cake mix in the pantry, so I subbed a yellow cake mix and added plenty of pumpkin pie spice (probably two teaspoons?). I'll try it again sometime exactly as written, just to see which we prefer.

I see a lot of folks tweaking and adding to this recipe, which is what we do, but the beauty here is in it's simplicity. I admit, first few times--it is TOUGH as a baker not to want to add eggs, think you are missing something, doesn't 'feel' right...you almost have to fight yourself!!  I've been making it as is without problems for years.  Found originally as a 'lighter' cake to save calories eggs/oil, etc.  The only thing I do slightly different is add more that one 15oz of pumpkin to get it a bit more spreadable. (usually either can and half or start with the larger size on hand, adding a bit at a time)    If I want to keep it light, I have whip cream on hand to dab on when serving.  If feeling decadent, I frost with Cream Cheese icing and sprinkle nuts on top.  Always a hit, never leftovers.  Was a family request for fall camping, would make it in aluminum pan and take with us. This recipe is a play on those weight watcher cakes that use a box mix with only a can of soda added...

I made this and we loved it! I did add in 1/2 C of cinnamon applesauce to this recipe(to get rid of leftover applesauce) and it still came out great! And yes it was moist. Next time I make this I will try it as is with just the two ingredients, just to know what that tastes like.

This is one of those rare recipes that are both simple and tasty. I have made this twice now, once by the book and once with the addition of two eggs as many here have recommended. The batter does get very thick and difficult without the eggs, but it is still delicious either way and I am glad the original recipe leaves them out. Personally, I quite like base recipes like this. They allow you to branch out and tailor it to your (and your family's) preferences. I'll be topping this with a glaze made of pumpkin spice and confectioner's sugar this time around. Mm!

4 starts because it is simple to do, minus one because I left it 10 extra min and the fork still didn't come out clean. It tastes really good if made with carrot cake mix. I actually used it as a base for a carrot poke cake so it not being as sweet was perfect because I still added condenced milk and then a cream cheese frosting made out of frosting, cool whip and whipped cream cheese topped with pecans and caramel.

Not something I'd make again. Followed recipe except I added 1/2 can of water since I was worried about texture/density. Still turned out extremely dense and doughy. I also would have liked something a little sweeter.

I did like others suggested and added eggs, a bit of sugar and some pumpkin spice.  I put a glaze on top of warm cake as suggested by one reviewer consisting of 1/4 cup icing sugar, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 2 Tbsp milk.  It was delicious

I had had to add a little water to mix, and extend cooking time by 5 minutes. Just made another batch adding nuts, flaxseed, pumpkin pie spice...just to make it a little healthy. Great for breakfast, or brunch buffet spread. I GLAZED it with a little cream cheese glaze.

I made as per directions and it was very moist.  Taste was subtle but OK .  I used a bundt pan and it will raise in the middle,  so smooth batter toward outside rim after pouring in pan so cake does not break when you flip over.  Next time I will add nuts and some cinnamon and nutmeg.  Frost with cream cheese icing and serve with whip topping.  Has anyone added raisins?  Do they sink to the bottom?

I read the reviews and decided to make this as listed to keep the calories down.  The only thing added was chopped walnuts because I love nuts in my muffins.  I made the batter in my stand mixer and had no trouble mixing it.  I also used my pampered chef brownie pan to make square muffins.  I sprayed the pan with butter spray and floured it with whole wheat flour.  The batter was difficult to spread but I used my fingers dipped in water and was able to spread it nicely.  Baked as directed after sprinkling some finely chopped walnuts on top and they came out beautifully!

I made this exactly as the box cake mix says (mix, 3 eggs 1/2 c veg oil, 1 c water) and added one can of pumpkin.  

The only thing I did was cook it longer at 325 degrees in a 9x13 pan (as the box says), but because the pumpkin adds moisture I cooked it for  45-50 minutes.  It is  firm on top with an almost dense pudding like middle.  Alone it is awesome, but I added cream cheese frosting, but whip topping would be just as good if you prefer lighter.  

A+  It is on the thanksgiving guest week menu.

A go-to pumpkin recipe for me. I've always made this in cookie form and finally made it in a sheet cake form  So good! Topped it with homemade cream cheese frosting and chopped up walnuts. I cooked it for 25-30 minutes.

I've been making this for years as stated in the recipe when I was on Weightwatchers.  It is a great recipe!  Yes, it is hard to spread in the pan.  For this reason I usually add 1/2 a cup of water just for ease of spreading.  No extra calories here!

This recipe is perfect exactly as written. Eliminating the oil and eggs saves around 100 calories per serving!  I made cupcakes.  I topped them with cream cheese glaze, to give it a nice finishing touch.  I was amazed at how good they are.  Everyone loves them, including my husband who poo poos a lighter version of anything!  As suggested by another reviewer, I added a little water to the batter. It was easy to handle and rose nicely.  The cupcakes were moist and delicious.  They are a new favorite dessert, with a little less guilt!!

Liked it a ton as did the guests that consumed it! Got so many compliments. Yay, definite "go-to" for the holidays! I did, like many others, add applesauce, 3 eggs, extra cinnamon/ginger, and made a whipped cream cheese icing. For me, it tasted WAY better chilled. Worth keeping! Would have given it 5 stars if it had listed the additions. Enjoy!

Ridiculously simple. I did add three eggs and 4 oz. of applesauce, plus a cream cheese frosting. Like a carrot cake, but so much easier. If you're pressed for time, this is a great way to go.

I made this exactly as directed.  It was bland and dense, more like nut bread or muffins.  I did not take others' advice to add other ingredients to it because I wanted to see how it was for myself.  I think adding some spices and nuts to the batter would make it a great loaf of bread.

I gave this five stars for its great taste and versatility. I've made it many times, and it's wonderful as written. I've frosted them all with maple frosting which enhances the flavor even more. My personal favorite variation is to add two eggs and lots of raisins and nuts.

The batter was thick so I added 1 cup of water (making water the 3rd ingredient). I did not add any additional sugar as others mentioned. The cake was good.Thanks for the recipe!

This cake is delicious!!! I did make a few changes after reading some other reviews. I used 2 eggs, 1/4 cup sugar, and a splash of water and made it in a bundt cake. Cooked it for 30minutes and it came out perfect!!!!

I LOVE this cake. I am rating it 4 stars because, based on other reviews, I added 3 eggs. I baked it in a sheet cake pan and topped with Cream Cheese frosting. It was DELICIOUS and everyone raved about it.

I whipped up this simple recipe with just a few modifications. I added three eggs and one packet of sugar free butterscotch pudding mix. I scooped into a muffin tin and baked for 24 min. Light and airy. Will cool and top with whipped cream cheese frosting and butterscotch chips or a caramel drizzle tomorrow. I've heard this recipe is better the next day.

I've made this for years and actually just made some for a friend to celebrate a win of his. I just wanted to share my tip: Instead of spreading the batter, fill a piping bag and pipe it into mini bundts pans. I usually fill mine right below the top, flip them upside to finish cooling and then drizzle a caramel sauce on them. Refrigerated, mine keep for at least a week. Hope this helps! Happy Baking!!

I mostly followed the easy recipe. I did add the simple glaze mentioned by Copeteen, but added  1/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice. It was delecious, and I did not use eggs. Maybe I will try that next time.

I decided to make this cake because I love pumpkin pie and anything else made with pumpkin.  I used the spice cake mix, but didn't add anything else other than about a 1/4 cup of water to make it more spreadable.  I even mixed it by hand instead of using a mixer.  After baking for 30 minutes, I let it cool and then frosted it with cream cheese frosting.  It was moist and delicious!  I will definitely make this cake again.

I have made this cake several times using different mixes. I just made it using a Butter Pecan cake mix. I topped it with a mixture of French Vanilla Cool Whip and butterscotch pudding, and sprinkled chopped pecans on the top. So flavorful and light. Can't wait to do more experimenting. Great recipe.

I made this with Betty Crocker GF cake mix.  I looked at all the reviews and saw someone that made it as cookies.  The batter was very very thick and so i went with the cookie option as well and I DID add a 3rd ingredient.  Chocolate chips.  IMHO it was gummy and stretchy.  They didn't flatten at all.  The flavor was fine.  My teenager said they were great.  (Plus we RARELY have sweets so this was a treat.)  Anyway- could TOTALLY have been that I made this with gluten free cake mix but I thought that I would post in case anyone else was wondering about using GF mix.

All of my family loved it! It tasted just like I imagined, like a giant pumpkin donut, which I called it for my grandkids.
I Used only the two ingredients, and thankfully had read the reviews, so expected it to be very thick. Therefore, I used Clean Cusine glove on my mixing hand to squeeze/mix it. That went very well. Also, I sprayed the mixing bowl and gloved hand with cooking spray fore easier release. I picked up small handfuls and dropped around the bundt pan, which was buttered and floured lightly, then gently spread it with the spatula.  
I baked it about 5-10 min longer.
After cooled, I used a donut glaze over it. Yum!
Looking forward to fall to do it again.  I couldn't wait to try it, so, we had it right in the middle of the hot summer!

I made this tonight to see if it would be good enough for company tomorrow.  It was. -as good as any plain cake I've  made.  I followed the recipe adding nothing but a couple tablespoons of water to make the batter more manageable.   I beat it with a spoon and baked about 35 minutes.   It did not seem any less rich than if it had been made with eggs and shortening.  Honest.

Very easy. I did just as the recipe instructed. I did use one reviewer's tip: I added the cake mix a little at a time. I also added mini chocolate chips since my daughter loves pumpkin bread with chocolate chips. My oven is not a great one, so it took the bread about an hour to bake. I let it stay another ten minutes in the hot oven with the temp turned off. It is a very dense bread, very moist. I am glad to have found and baked this recipe, and defintely will bake again.

Awesome flavor.  I used a yellow cake mix, can of pumpkin and 3 eggs per package directions.  I added pumkin pie spice and chocolate chips. And maybe a teaspoon of bourbon.  My friend made me take the cake out of the oven before it was all browned on top, and it was so light and fluffy.  Delish!

I added 1 Tbsp pumpkin pie spice and sprinkled the top with pecans and turbinado raw cane sugar before baking. Delicious. Tastes best after it's been cooled completely.

Rated as easy and only two items made it my bring along item for yesterday. Read remarks to add extras but used only the two ingredients. Didn't have the mixing problems everyone said they had. Added only small amounts of powdered cake mix at a time and mixing together thoroughly before adding more. Did the knife test to make sure it was done as recommended... *skip that and only cook 30 min! Added 5 minutes with the knife showing uncooked cake... don't believe it! Burned the bottom on the corners and not as moist. Used 9"x13" pan and I'd suggest the Bundt pan, easier to fill and serve. Next time, I'll make for myself in cookie form.

I made it, added the eggs as suggested and frosted w/cream cheese frosting.  It was fine but not super moist as expected.  I was up to 3 ingredients, isn't the regular box just 4 (mix, egg, oil, water?).  If the point is to be simple just make the box as directed.  If you are looking for a moist flavorful spice cake then look up another recipe.

I added the tiniest bit of milk to make it a little looser but not enough to really alter the recipe. I made some cream cheese icing to put over it, which made it better but still nothing to write home about.

Three stars for flavor and texture - 5 stars for simplicity and healthier version.  ....equals 4 stars given. 

Made as cake. It was ok.  Second time made them as cookies and added a cup of chocolate chips.  My kids liked them and they are a little healthier.  Thanks.  

** funny people are changing it to what the recipe calls for on the box...duh :)  The recipe was changed for a reason.

I'm sorry. I can't give this a good rating. Perhaps spiced pumpkin cookies, but there's no way this thick and dense batter is for a cake. After modifying the recipe with 2 eggs and 1/4 cup milk later I was able to produce cake batter. But because *I* ended up modifying it, the posted recipe is what's getting the rating. It's a nice base, but honestly, this is a 4 ingredient recipe, not 2.

Simple and delicious. Yes! DENSE BATTER. Feels weird to cook since not like "normal" batters.  Also loved that it doesn't make a huge cake - it was great for 2 people and a few days of snacking instead of the waste of throwing out old cake.

I did have to cook it 40 mins so watch and knife test at 30.

I did not have spice cake so used a yellow box and added in the cinnamon, allspice, etc.  Definite keeper.

Totally rocked it out with toasted coconut over butter cream powdered sugar glaze.

My family loves this recipe. I also add eggs(2) and I bake as a layer cake in two 8 inch pans and frost it with cream cheese frosting. My family's favorite version of this is made with a Cinnamon Supreme cake mix.

Perfect! I had been looking for a recipe where I could just use a simple cake mix and add pumpkin and this turned out great; it was very pumpkiny! Which is just how I like it!

I read many reviews and I ended up adding two eggs, 3 tbl. water and a tablespoon of melted butter and it turned out amazing. Everyone loved it and I would make it again. I frosted with Cream Cheese frosting consisting of cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter and vanilla.

I definitely found this to be easy and delicious but like most others I tweaked it a bit too. I replaced half the spice cake with angel food cake mix to bring down the fat and carbs and then added a bit more pumpkin spice. I also used a little more canned pumpkin. Very tasty!

The BEST pumpkin cake ever!!  My 3 kids and hubby devoured it.  After reading some reviews, I did tweak the recipe just a bit.  I only had a box of Yellow cake mix so I added 1 tsp Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp of All Spice, 2 Tbsp Brown Sugar and 1/2 cup of Hellmans Mayonnaise....yes, you saw it right...MAYONNAISE!! I was out of eggs and thought I'd experiment..well it turned out Perfect!! VERY MOIST...I hope you all enjoy as much as we did.  (no need for icing, it's seriously wonderful all by itself)  hmmm cake balls would be Amazing... Just a thought

I have used this exact recipe to make pumpkin whoopie pies. It makes a tasty, cakey cookie without the eggs that seem to be necessary for a good cake...for those who want to try that. Just add cream filling.

I first heard of this recipe at a Weight Watchers meeting.  You can make this into mini muffins and they only count as 1 point each.  My daughters really love them.  This does work well with other flavors of cake mix, so experiment and see what you like best.  We've added mini chocolate chips before and that is delicious as well.  I will note that these can be a little sticky when leftover for a day or two.

This cake is the best!  I followed the advice of some others and added an egg to the mix with the pumpkin.  I also threw a little pumpkin spice in with the batter.  I don't understand what everyone is saying about it being too thick.  I prepared the cake mix as directed on the box.  Then I added the pumpkin and one egg.  I almost thought the mix was too runny.  It came out perfectly!!  Oh!  I did add about 1/4 cup brown and white sugar to replace the sweetness that the pumpkin took out.  Still, when the cake was done it wasn't too sweet.  Actually, it was more like a pumpkin bread.  I melted some white icing with some pumpkin spice mixed in and drizzled it all over the cake.  It was perfect!  The family loved it!

Overall great recipe. Heres what I did different. I doubled my recipe as I couldn't find anything smaller than a 29 ounce can of pumpkin. I added one egg and about two tablespoons of pumpkin pie spice. The cake doesn't rise very well so make sure you fill your pan pretty full. I used loaf pans. It took mine almost an hour to bake so allow yourself some extra time. I bought a can of cream cheese frosting and put about half the frosting in the microwave for about 20 seconds. When I removed the cake from the oven I put it straight on a serving plate and cut the loaf into partial slices (only about half way down, just a little more than scoring the top) I then poured the melted frosting over the cake, which really helped make it moist. Then after letting it cool about 15-20 minutes I frosted the loaf with the remaining frosting. This cake is good the next day but I thought it was best while it was still a little warm. My sister owns a bakery and I have never been able to wow her with any of my baking but this sure did. She's requested me to make it for our family reunion next week!  Super Yummy dessert!

This was a great "last minute/no time to bake" cake.  It was not *excellent* but definitely works as a good dessert in a pinch.  I added 2 eggs as other suggested.  I also used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site.

Very tasty recipe. I did add a couple of eggs just to be on the safe side, but next time I'll try it without any additions. Also - another poster mentioned adding chocolate chips and making cookies - I'm trying that tonight.

Good recipe, consistency a little crumbly, probably better as muffins than cake.  I also added 1/2 cup water to the mixture...good overall though, will probably make again, because it is SO SIMPLE!
