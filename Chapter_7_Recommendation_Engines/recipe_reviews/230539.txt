I've been making this candy for 19 years. A few things:
1. Don't make on a day with high humidity, this is for North or South.
2. Do NOT use wax paper. Take a bath towel fold in half and cover with powder sugar the WHOLE area where you will  smooth candy out.
3. Use you hands NOT a roller and cut slices with a piece of sewing thread??
4. Cook to 250Â° anything higher will make it hard and crack.
5. After you get this recipe down it is well worth it??

Once I have all the prep done, I don't  pour the candy onto wax paper. I pour an entire bag of powdered sugar on the counter (wax paper or whatever work space you're using). I buildup the powdered sugar like a bowl and pour the candy mixture into the sugar. Then I quickly knead the powdered sugar into the candy. You don't want to over work it or it will be too stiff. Once  kneaded in the powdered sugar, roll it out (kinda thin, less than 1/4 inch). Mix a little butter into the peanut butter before spreading over the candy, not too much though, just enough to spread easier. Spread the peanut butter and roll up the candy.  Cut into pieces and store in an air-tight container.

My major criticism is that it takes an almost sinful amount of butter applied to the wax paper to keep it from sticking and tearing apart.  Also, this recipe does NOT double well at all.   Alsoot won't work when the humidity is over 50%.  The things I did find that worked for it were:  Beat the eggs to very stiff foam, and turn the mixer off while the candy finishes.  Do not use fresh eggs.  They foam too much and will cause a mess.  Let the corn syrup mixture reach 265-270.  At this point turn your eggs back on low and slowly pour in the candy mix.  Turn the speed to medium and just walk away.  It took mine about 30 minutes to properly set up to a ready to pour point.  If you can make it through how finicky this recipe is, you actually do end up with some delicious candy.

It stuck like glue to the wax paper. It did not taste anything like grandma's.  I would not recommend this.

This is the exact recipe for home made peanut butter roll.  The recipe must be followed EXACTLY!  I have been making this for years and it takes a while to get in the groove of how it's suppose to turn out.  I spray my counter top with baking spray to roll out.  This candy takes LOTS of practice.

I make this every year. The #1 tip I can give is - do not even attempt this recipe if the humidity is over 40%.  I  really try for 25% but that's tough in Florida.  Another thing I learned the hard way is not to over beat the egg whites.  I roll it on parchment paper dusted with xxxsugar.  It is an easy fail recipe but when its right it's worth it.   It's a 5 generation tradition in our family!

Do NOT use wax paper, it stuck like glue. I finally got it off the paper with a lot of  confectionery sugar and a lot of work.  Not pretty a mess to clean up.

I also cooked my sugar to 265 degrees. It worked perfect for me. Not sure why others had an issue? It's messy to make but it always has been. I also used silicone instead of waxed paper and plenty of sifted powdered sugar as a non stick method. Careful though, too much powdered sugar causes it to separate from the peanut butter if too much is used.
My mother would approve :)

With few changes to recipe it works.
Allow eggs whites to sit room temperature while cooking sugar mixture, make sure cook mixture to 265 on candy thermometer. 
Then beat sugar mixture with egg whites for almost 20 minutes.

the candy came out too sticky and looked nothing like it was supposed to; I'll look for a different recipe
