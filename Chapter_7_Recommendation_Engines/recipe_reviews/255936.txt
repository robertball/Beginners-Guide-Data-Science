I am not an experienced cook. One of the primary reasons I love Chef John's recipes is that even someone like me  can still do them justice. I attempted to follow the directions exactly as outlined. Having never roasted peppers before, mine came out a little too crispy in the end. I believe this was my error and should have only halved my peppers rather than quartering. I sliced he onions as suggested and they burned to a crisp. I guess this is where my inexperience comes in. The chicken was perfect. Crispy skin but still moist and tender. I used Hot Italian sausage and that also came out beautifully and some of the heat made it's way into the chicken. All in all, loved this dish and will make it again. I will either add the onions later or maybe skip them altogether and have more of the sweet peppers. Thanks Chef John for making me look good :)

This was simple and tasted great. I asked my wife before cooking it if she wanted any, and she declined, telling me to cut the recipe in half so I wouldn't have excessive leftovers. As it was roasting she was drawn to the kitchen and remarked that it smelled good. She returned later asking when it would be ready and did I make enough for her after all. When she saw it, she said it looked beautiful, and after eating it raved about how much she loved it. Oh, and I loved it too. I might add whole heirloom carrots next time and experiment around with red potatoes or something just for fun, but still great just as it is.

Followed the recipe exactly except used 5 sausages instead of 4 because that's how many were in the package. Delicious and everyone loved it. Cooking time of 1 hour was spot on except that I lowered the temp by 25 degrees during the last 15 minutes. It was cooked just right. Thank you Chef John.

This is divine!! My husband, who rarely gives out compliments, adored it. Definitely use a gorgeous Italian sausage. I don't know if Chef John intended using precooked or smoked types. The flavor from the sausage took this dish to decedent. And additional or various other veggies that work well roasted would make it even better. They're supposed to get a bit black (esp. sweet peppers) or brown, and crisp. That's the goal. Then they're sweet and lovely.  This dish is very easy, short on time needed to preprep, and really elegant. Great with crusty bread or a good green salad. Thanks, John.

I rarely leave reviews but with this recipe I had to make an exception. First of all, thank you Chef John. For everyone else. You REALLY need to try this recipe. I made it according to the directions but cut it down to 4 servings. I used two sweet & one hot Italian sausage. The next time (there WILL be a next time), I think I’ll just try three spicy sausages. I used one large red bell pepper but I’m thinkin’ you could use any kind of peppers or a combination of peppers including some spicy ones if you like it that way.

We LOVE this recipe. It is great when you have a crowd to feed. I generally don’t brown the sausage ahead of time as I find it browns up just fine in the pan (and I use mild sausage so I don’t get that oil anyway). Thank you Chef John!

Take my advice... watch chef John's video and make it exactly the way he tells you, I can't stop eating this!! So delicious and simple, and flavorful.  You HAVE to use spicy sausage though, sweet sausage doesn't give it that  kick like the spicy does, just cut them to 1-inch slices instead of two because wow, it's spicy. Be generous with the salt, but two teaspoons is a bit much.  I kinda eyeballed it. I wish my supermarket sold organic chicken thighs skin on and bone in, but I made an exception because I didn't want to sacrifice the flavor.  Bon appetit!!

This recipe is amazing! I followed the recipe almost exactly (and I highly recommend watching the video) and it was EVERTHING I expected.  Next time I'll use more veggies & potatoes because they are just delicious! A new fave that will become a beloved standby for sure!

Yes, I will make this again! Thanks to fantastic Rippin' Rick for the suggestion.  I added a whole garlic head and carrots.  Looking forward to adding other veggies and possibly some wine...yum yum..

Made as written, and then made it several times since then using more onions, carrots, whatever I had on hand. I LOVE this recipe, and always use the leftovers, chopped up and mixed with a can of V8 as a stew the next day. Simple, delicious. Thank you Chef John!

Everyone LOVED this at last night's dinner party. Perfect for entertaining -- no fuss, no last minute rush -- and DELISH. I think the hot Italian sausages made the difference -- even though my husband and I prefer mild, I used hot based on Chef John's suggestion, plus wasn't stingy with the Italian spices and olive oil after watching the video, and the resulting flavours were AMAZING.

This was okay. Followed the recipe except I used mild Italian sausage because my husband doesn't like hot.
In the end the chicken tasted just like chicken, potatoes tasted just like potatoes and so on. Everything was moist but heavy on grease and oil.
I won't make this again.

Oh babee - This is absolutely wonderful. I eyeballed the main ingredients since there are only two of us, added some carrots and white wine (because wine goes in everything!), Tony's for seasoning and used 2 thighs and 2 drumsticks. It baked 
at 400 for an hour. This was so easy and fun to make.

Love this recipe.  I just added some thinly sliced fennel for a little extra wow and this was amazing.  This is definitely a great recipe for a novice because you really can't go wrong.

Chicken very flavorful with the sausage infused in it, as well as the spices. Had oven on 450 for an hour and everything roasted well, potatoes cooked and soft and chicken at the appropriate temp. Thank you, Chef John, will make again!

This is likely my favorite Sunday meal recipe and have also made it to send to friends as a meal train contribution. I  have done with boneless/skinless thighs as well and lowered cooking time by 10-15 minutes. For additional color and in the interest of a complete one dish meal, I have added Brussel sprouts. Will do it next time with sweet potatoes as a healthy alternative.

This is delicious! I used chicken feta sausages as that was what I had and skinless boneless thighs as my market was out of skin on bone in thighs.  I added a touch of cayenne and lots of olive oil to make up for the lack of spicy pork sausage.  I also doubled the amount of peppers and used red, orange, and yellow bell peppers. It was really good and I'll definitely make again!

I found this dish wonderful and hope to make it many times.  I used mild sausage just because I'm a wimp.  I used 1 red & 1 orange bell pepper which weighed 1.5 pounds & they were cut in quarters.  The seasoning I used was Penzeys Tuscan Sunset.  I added NO salt as we try to avoid sodium at our house.  I lined my roasting pan with heavy-duty foil and cooked everything at 450 for half an hour then turned the oven down to 400.  This was caramelized and perfectly cooked.  Yum, Chef John, another home run!

My first attempt at this was not exactly a winner but the flavors were excellent and I know I can correct my errors so I gave five stars.   For my oven, 450F was too hot.  I was busy and didn't check on it and the dish came out a little more crisp than I would like .  Ok, a lot.  It looked as if I had burned it but a quick stir and it was still edible.  The amazing part was that although I had cooked it too long or too hot or something, the flavors were quite delicious.  I'm not a big fan of sausage and peppers and only lukewarm on chicken thighs and I still thought they were great.   What I loved about this recipe is that it was very, very easy and not time consuming.  I also love what I call, "one dish wonders."  One dish and I have a healthy meal to serve to my constantly eating family.   It was also very attractive and just a bit different twist on things I've cooked before.  I will definitely make this again and most likely lower my over to 400F or keep an eye on it and take it out sooner.

Wow! Great flavors and super easy to make!  I added less salt though because I felt recipe was a little excessive.  I also added a bag of whole brussel sprouts and some thick carrots  cut to about 3 inch pieces.  I upped the chicken to 10 thighs and used a larger roasting pan.  I also thought 450F was a bit too high so I cooked at 425F for an hour and it was perfect!  I had a nice roast/bark on potatoes and chicken.  Make sure to keep chicken on top though.   It got rave reviews and will definitely make again!  Thank you chef John!

Delicious as is!  I did follow the instructions and put the potatoes at the top.  I think I should have put the chicken on top so the skins got crispy and potatoes underneath to absorb the schmaltz.  This will be a regular dish now at our house.

This was yummy and super simple.  I roasted mine at 400 for 50 mins and was cooked beautifully.  The only thing I think I'll do differently is maybe add the peppers with 30 mins left.  I would have preferred they have a little more texture to them.  They were very soft.  Also, maybe cut back on the salt.  2 tsp. was a bit much for my taste.

Pretty good. I used skinless, boneless thighs and after 25 minutes, and when I saw the onions and pepper cooking too fast, I cut the heat to 425 and overall cooking time to 45 minutes. Delicious. If you use coarse kosher salt, I recommend cutting the amount in the original recipe.  I only use two sausages as my wife doesn't care for it; more for me. Will do it again with some mods.

My husband and I loved this! I only gave it 4 stars because I DIDN'T make it exactly as written. I couldn't use the peppers and I only used kielbasa sausage with chicken thighs with skin and bone also onion. I pan seared the sausage as said in recipe,but also the chicken thighs until skin was crisp. Added a little broth to deg lazed the pan and poured  over chicken,sausage and potatoes. The rest was the same. SOOOOOOO simple and good. I will try with peppers next time.

Made this last night and it tasted great. I used a little red wine to deglaze the brown bits from the Italian sausage and pour that together with the fat into the roast pan. It was easy  to make and yet tasted really good!

This was an overall delicious and simple meal! I was so glad how little time it took to prep and just stick in the oven. I followed the recipe exactly and the only slightly different thing I did was season the chicken separately  with the salt, pepper and oregon as I'm always paranoid that when I try to season chicken along with other ingredients that it won't get the majority of it and come out plain. Once I seasoned it, I did the rest in a different bowl and then combined them when it was time to add the oil. We will definitely be doing it again!!

So so so so yummy!!! Did I say yummy?! So flavorful and easy to make! I added a little extra spice to it, red pepper flakes and a little Cajun seasoning and it was delicious! Husbands exact words "you knocked it out of the park babe, wait, out of the continent!"

Thank You!  This is a great recipe that is very easy to tweak for your own preferences.  I used Johnsonville smoked beef rope sausage x 2 pkgs and boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I did not pre-cook the sausage, just pierced both ropes all over and cut into chunks.  I placed chicken thighs, then placed potatoes all around, then everything else all over.  I used Zatarains Creole seasoning, lemon pepper, garlic powder, a little seasoning salt and Italian seasoning.  425 degrees for 30 minutes, then 375 degrees another 35-40 minutes.  (My kids don't appreciate a good char like I do).  This came out perfectly w/moist yummy chicken, with only very slightly charred areas.  I made rice on the side, as if there wasn't enough food already.  Plates were filled......tummies were satisfied.  House smells so good!!

The was so easy and delicious! We decided to use Italian chicken sausage instead of pork. I made rice with the dish instead of adding the potatoes ( honestly I forgot lol). This meal gave our taste buds a wild ride and my family loved it!!

Excellent, so delicious! My boyfriend wants me to add this to the rotation, it was that good. The chicken comes out very crispy yet moist and flavorful. I made the recipe as-is, except for the sausage in which case I used turkey as I try to eat healthier, however the main change is that I increased all ingredients except meat by about 25%, to match the amount of sausage & chicken that comes per package. It made about 2 large pans, or 8 servings.

Phenomenal. My meat-and-potatoes guy was practically licking his plate. Love the char on the potatoes, tasted even better the next day. Will definitely be making this again. So easy, and only had to dirty one dish.

This recipe was easy to prepare...slice and chop, toss in a pan and forget it. Only changes: I used a kielbasa 'cause that's what I had, tossed with Oregano, garlic powder and onion powder in addition to S&P. Ate a salad while it cooked (gotta have something green!).

Added some celery to the mixture.  Also rubbed baking powder on the chicken to give a crispy texture.  Everything tasted wonderful although some of the potatoes weren't as tender as others.  I think I needed a bigger roasting pan!

I didn't think this recipe would amount to much , I had some leftover chicken leg quarters and peppers to use and saw this recipe. I didn't have sausage , but thought I would try it anyway. The only thing I did different was when the pain got dry I would pour  white wine over it , did this the last 30 minutes twice and then basted everything with the pan juices and it turned into a golden gravy it was fabulous. I definitely will make this again. This recipe it was so simple you can't go wrong with it.

We used spicy cooked chorizo sausage from the deli section.  Otherwise, followed the recipe which was delicious! Some of the red onions on the top burned, but the chicken skin was crispy and delicious.  Just in case you don't watch the video and weren't sure like me, score the chicken twice  perpendicular to the bone.

Super easy recipe,  I made a couple of modifications, personal preference..added 2 tsp soy sauce over the top at the very end and about 1 cup of water to the roasting pan for additional juices.  Carrots were a great addition for color and earthy flavor. Garlic powder and freshly ground black pepper topped it all off. Will definitely be keeping this as a go-to. Thank You Chef!

My family loved this!  Chef John's recipes have never let me down, and this was no exception.  I doubled the recipe, so that our family of 4 could have leftovers for lunches. This was a HUGE amount of food that barely fit into my biggest pan.  Because of this, I needed to add about 20 minutes to the baking time to make sure the potatoes were cooked.  The chicken was done and browning at 1 hour, so I loosely covered the thighs with aluminum foil to keep them from burning.  I followed the suggestions of a couple of other readers, and added carrots and a whole head of garlic to the pan.  I also added smoked paprika directly to the skin of the chicken thighs, simply because I love smoked paprika and thought it would add some good flavor.  I otherwise followed Chef's John's recipe exactly...I watched the video, too, which was helpful in deciding how much to cook the sausages when rendering the fat.  This was a delicious one-pan meal!  Thank you, Chef John!

I thought it is a good recipe,  especially when you throw in hot Italian sausage. Didn't change anything but I didn't get much juice out from the sausages. A little bit dry but good.
Thank you Chef John

Very good recipe!  I love Chef John's recipes.  They are easy and delicious.  I only had boneless, skinless chicken breasts, but it still came out good . The chicken was just a little dry which I anticipated! The peppers onions, potatoes and sausage were delicious!

The first time I made this dish I had everything I needed except chicken thighs so I substituted boneless chicken breasts.  It was awesome.  I'm making it again tonight with chicken thighs and can't wait.  Chef John has yet to disappoint.

This is my favorite go-to recipe when I'm feeding a crowd and want to impress!  It looks and tastes like a gourmet dinner, and best of all, once it's put together,  it just needs to roast until it's done, leaving you free to entertain your guests.  Bravo, Chef John, for this amazing dinner!

The first two times I made this it kept burning to a crisp. I watched the video and followed the recipe but the temperature was too high and too long for my oven. I had adjusted the cooking time the second time and it still was overcooked. The third time, I heated my oven to 400 degrees and kept an eye on it after 50 mins to make sure it wasn’t too crispy. These turned out better the third time but I had to double check to make sure everything was cooked.

Great simple dinner for a weeknight. I don't like bones in my meat, so I used boneless chicken thighs. Added celery, zucchini, and carrots sine I had them on hand. Do not recommend the zucchini--it got mushy beyond recognition. Added chicken broth for juice. Skipped onions because we don't like them. Used beef kielbasa instead of sausage. Turned out great. A shish kabob without the bobs!

Excellent meal, my entire household loved it. I made it EXACTLY according to the recipe and found it a little too salty, next time I'll just skip the salt as I do with most recipes. Definitely a keeper.

I made this for my husband, bonus son and myself. When reading the ingredients to my husband, he was a little skeptical.
Until I came along, he didn't explore foods much. I normally don't follow receipes entirely, but this time, I even watched the video. The only change I made, as we've cut our sodium intake, was I didn't use any salt. Here's my husbands response, "even in your pain (I have MS), you managed to cook a meal that rates up there in your top ten best." So far the Chef John recipes have all had positive reviews in the household and we will definitely have this one again!

With a piece of crusty Italian Bread to sop up the pan juices this recipe is a winner. I didn't change a thing and it came out of the oven hot and delicious. The vegetables absorbed the spiciness of the sausage, the chicken was cooked perfectly.  I will be making this again

This was amazing!  I used sweet sausage so I added garlic per Chef John video.  I also added carrots because I like cooked carrots and thought it would add nicely to the veggies.  I needed it to be down in 45 top so I baked 475 for 10 min then lowered temp to 450 for remaining time and it was perfect. I also baked it in a 9*13 glass casserole.

This was so good that I had to leave a review!  I would suggest watching Chef John's video too, but the recipe is super easy follow.  Everyone loved it, even my son who can be on the picky side.  Make sure to serve with some crusty bread to soak up the pan drippings.  Great Fall time/Football time comfort food!

Loved this recipe. Easy to do. This is my second time, and I used a larger mixing bowl and it enabled me to use way less oil. It was good the first time, just more oil than you would want. Today it goes to a luncheon at church. The flavors compliment each other!

Absolutely delicious!  I used 1/2 sweet and 1/2 hot sausage.  This time I followed the recipe exactly.  I want to try it with some turkey sausage, maybe add carrots or squash.  Fun to experiment with veggies but I would never mess with seasoning or chicken. I’ll make this often!

So delicious!! This is going to be a regular at our house on the weekends! I used skin on chicken drumsticks because they were on sell,and I used two potatoes ,2 cloves of chopped garlic, and added 2 cups of radishes cut into quarters for versatility that added flavor. I mixed it all up accordingly per Chief John's instructions,and I cannot stress enough that this dish needs to be tried because it is superb!!

Amazing dinner! Added a little garlic and white wine. Backed the heat down to 400 degrees during the last 20 min.

Chef John did not lie! It is delicious and will be made again! I halved the recipe and used a 4 qt Dutch oven, so my potatoes didn’t all get roasted as well as in a flat roasting pan, still had a great flavor.

This recipe is perfection! The first time I make a recipe I follow it exactly , and then inevitably make changes the next time. Not this time. The only change I might make is to make a bigger batch. Oh, and serve it with some crusty bread to soak up all that  delicious juice! 

My daughter and I are watching carbs, so we leave the potatoes  (or most them...) for her dad. She's actually following a Paleo diet and this is easy, delicious and fits her lifestyle. Repeating...perfect!

This was very good! I used Johnsonville hot Italian sausage and do not recommend any substitutions there.  Next time I may add carrots and maybe cabbage wedges too but as is it’s five stars in my book!

My first time making anything like this, but I thought it turned out excellent! Wife loved it, too. Easy to prepare, made it exactly like the recipe instructed. I did need an extra 15 mins in the oven to cook the potatoes and peppers, but we have an old oven.

This an excellent meal.  Easily feeds 4 to 5 people (or 2 with plenty of leftovers for lunch).   Be sure to nestle the sausages into the veggies.  Too much exposure can result in hard, overcooked pieces.

My 10 yr old, husband, and mother all loved this and ate seconds.  They were all dissapointed that there was not more. I used green peppers (husband does not like the others) and butternut squash only because we are trying to avoid potatoes right now.  I mixed the sausages and veggies together in a bowl and then poured those into roasting pan, and laid the chicken thighs on top.  I am making this again tonight and will use twice the onions and peppers.  This is a winner.

I followed the recipe closely. The only thing that was a bit off was the oven temp and time. At 450 degrees F the dish was fully cooked in 40 minutes. Chef John says 1 hour 10 minutes. But it could be my oven temp is off. Otherwise, this was such a delish dinner. My husband raved about it.

Turned out amazing. I used less oil than Chef John and it still turned out very moist and tender. Family ate it quickly and was ready for more.

I pretty much followed the recipe, and watched the video, which did a great job of illustrating the recipe.
My kids loved it, and that is saying a lot! Will make it again and again.

I love this dish.  It was fairly easy to prep and for me, the hot Italian sausage gave the whole dish a nice kick. My wife feels it was a bit spicy for her. I may try going with the mild Italian sausage for her and kick mine up with some crushed red pepper. 
Overall, it's a beautiful dish with the incredible roasted flavors.  Nothing I would change here.  Although, to change up the theme, I'm thinking of trying it with an Italian tomato sauce, cacciatore style.  But that's just a different dish. And this one is perfect the way it is

This is excellent!! It is super simple, versatile, flavorful and filling; all the things I am usually looking for in a meal. Also, it's a fun recipe to play with. I made it with Old Bay seasoning for a different spin and it was delicious. Also, to simplify, I bought pre cooked sausage so that all I had to do was slice them and add them to the roaster. This makes it a single step meal, no cooking prior to throwing it in the oven. However, you have to compensate for the lack of juices from cooking the sausage. I used olive oil and apple cider vinegar to do so and then add a little more seasoning.

This was amazing! The smell of it cooking had the whole family in the kitchen waiting for it to come out of the oven .
I added a few things I had in the fridge. I added a package of whole mushrooms cut in half and 3 cubes of frozen garlic to boost the flavor since I used mild Italian sausage. Everything  else I did was according to the recipe. I may add some carrots  next time.  Everyone loved it and I am happy to have such an easy and delicious dish to add to our dinner menus.

Vegetables were amazing but both meats were way overcooked.  I had doubts about an hour at a high temp but I love Chef John and trusted his recommendation.  The flavor in the peppers and onions was wonderful!  IF I try this again, I will cut the time back to about only 30 min.

I made it almost as the recipe stated and it came out deliciously! The only thing I adjusted was the oven temp. I cooked it at 400 for an hour then checked the chicken by cutting it to the bone. I noticed that there was still a little red close to the bone so I turned the heat down to 350 and let it bake for an additional 30 mins. That did the trick! Chicken was moist and veggies cooked great! Also used hot and mild turkey sausage. Dont overcook sausage at begining or it will dry out when baking. Overall a very good dish!

Super quick, super easy and super tasty....

Couple thoughts (based on 'operator error')....
 - All the contents should fit nicely in the roasting pan (not piled high, but also not too spread out such that the food doesn't 'cook together';
- Don't eat this before you take a blood test or tell your cardiologist!  It is superb because of the fat from the chicken and sausage.

Again, if you're looking for super tasty, super quick and super easy (hard to screw-up), this Chef John recipe is for you.

The taste was terrific. All the right ingredients blended together. As others suggested some of the onions and peppers got a little burnt and another time I would leave them in larger pieces and maybe try to have them in the bottom layer.

Great food! This recipe was so easy. I cut the ingredients in half and there was plenty! Some of the potatoes did not get done enough. just the ones on the edge. Next time I will move them around a little. The aroma in the house was divine!

Very good and pretty fast to throw together.

I added a couple of smashed garlic cloves because anything Italian-flavored has to get that flavor mixed in. I also used a whole yellow onion since we like the flavor. I didn't like the recommended size of quartered potatoes and halved peppers  so I basically made them chunk sized (1 pepper = 8 pieces, potatoes were about 2x2 inches). Next time I'd deglaze the pan with some wine but it wasn't required.  I also used 3 mild Italian and 2 hot Italian links since not everyone in my house like spicier foods. They were medium (Johnsonville) so bumped it from 4 to 5 links.

Definitely move the veggies around 2-3 times while roasting so they don't char.  This makes a LOT so have a big roasting ready so it roasts properly.  I will use boneless thighs next time since I really didn't like picking the bones out of a meal that otherwise is ready to eat.

Adding to the regular meal list since the mix of sausage and chicken is excellent.

Loved it. My husband said, “this one is a keeper”
I read many reviews. Added the carrots. And the head of garlic. I will add more onions, carrots and peppers next time.  We love veggies.  I decreased to 4 thighs so it will make 2 meals for the 2 of us. The spicy sausage was right for us. We love spicy. I got a small ciabatta baguette as suggested. Put in oven for last 7 minutes. Yummy. To enjoy the pan juices.

04/16/19:  Do have that large heavy-duty roasting pan, and a baster handy; you'll make good use of both.  Per directions, this dish has the potential to serve 6 or 8--easily more if you double everything ( have another pan handy if you do ).  Simple straight-forward ingredients with simple straight forward cooking steps.  I was generous with using FRESH seasonings while having FUN mixing them with everything; the aromatic scent hinted I was going to enjoy this dish.  Oven temp set @ 420 for 50 minutes; made good use of BASTING chicken tops with pan juices to achieve that caramelization without drying meat out.  Definitely gonna make this one again.

I made it twice and it was great! Second time I added 1/3 cup of balsamic vinegar and one tablespoon brown sugar. Over linguini. Amazing!

This was a super easy recipe to make and I would make it again.  I used yellow, orange, and green bell peppers and they were yummy.  My sausage didn't give enough oil so I had to use more olive oil, hence less of the cooked sausage flavor  in the sauce.  I added 4 cloves of garlic, minced, as well as 8 oz sliced mushrooms and they added a great earthy flavor. 
 I would add them again next time, adding 6 cloves of garlic and cooking the mushrooms down first to evaporate their liquid.  I would also use 3 tsp Italian herbs instead of  2 tsp.  I added quite a bit of kosher salt, and while I usually I add enough to my cooking, because I couldn't test for seasoning, it was a little under-salted.  Next time I would ensure I add a larger amount.  Kids loved this recipe so I will definitely make it again.  Nice job Chef John!  You've done it again.

Will definitely make again.  I didn't have Yukon Gold potatoes but the substitution of regular Idaho potatoes went very well.  I'm sure using Yukon Gold will bring it up one more notch.  Next time.  

I used a tiny bit extra Italian seasoning (3tsp vs 2) and loved the outcome.

The taste was really good.  This makes a very large amount of food which I did not realize until it was all mixed. I was making this in a Cuisinart AF oven so I needed divide the mixture in half in 2 separate dishes. The veggies had a tendency to crisp up almost to a burnt edge. Next time I would start the chicken and cook for about 10 to 12 minutes and then add all the vegetables.  Even if I half the recipe I would cook the chicken partially before adding the rest of it. The taste was terrific. I wonder if there are frozen veggies that would make this take less time to put together.

I made this for dinner last night and everyone loved it.  I will definitely make this again as it feeds a crowd very easily but will probably season the chicken separately next time.  The skin was crispy and the chicken was cooked well but was a little bland for my tastes.  Perhaps a savory dry rub overnight before assembling the vegetables in the roasting pan.  I am not complaining because as I said, everyone loved it but will experiment next time with more flavor....

I didn't add the potatoes because my pan wasn't big enough. It was very good. The chicken was nice and crispy and it all worked well together. There weren't any leftovers. The kids ate it all.  I will definitely make it again.

I have made this twice now. Generally I have a lot of mouths to feed so I double the recipe. It is always a hit. I think I'm going to buy a large roasting pan. I want to bring more potatoes to the top for roasting and leave the sausage down below.

I used skinless boneless chicken thighs for a healthier choice and also used chicken sasuage for a heart healthy meal. It was delicious! Will be adding this to my dinner menus.

I used garlic sausage, chicken thighs, potatoes, onions, red and green peppers. I didn't use the salt indicated and baked at 425. It could have used a bit longer for the potatoes but everything else was delicious! I didn't have any dried Italian herbs so I made my own mix. Will be a repeat for sure.

SO GOOD. I followed the recipe except used avocado oil and cooked it at 400 for 1/2 time and 425 1/2 time. The chicken was good, crisp on the outside, tender inside. The sausage was the best part. OR maybe the sweet peppers. I followed advice and used foil in the pan to help with sticking. I didn't have a big roasting pan so used both halves of my pampered chef glass top roaster. Very simple and easy to make.

I really enjoyed the compliments from my family after we had this dish.  The only changes I made were to use additional vegetables (orange, yellow, red carrots and cauliflower) with the peppers, potatoes, and onion.  The Italian season really enhanced the flavor of the whole dish!  Easy to prepare.

This looked a little difficult to make but I discovered it’s pretty easy as long as you follow the directions closely. The only variations I made were using the potatoes I had and 5 sausage links (they don’t sell in 4 packs!). Oh, and sweet not hot sausage- just personal preference. Delicious! Will make again...and again!

Made it AGAIN, with a fat reducing variation.  I used boneless & skinless chicken thighs - which I also trimmed all visible fat.  Much less fat, seemed healthier and better.
I’d like to try chicken breasts or chicken tenders, but they would have to be at the bottom of the pot in order to not dry out.  There’s generally some liquid (the peppers and potatoes release liquid) at the bottom so they’d never be “dry”.  The potatoes should ALWAYS go on top of the dish in order to full cook.

I'm only recently getting back into cooking. Mental & physical health issues have made cooking (and most things) take a backseat for a long time. Coming back means finding simple, less intimidating recipes to start with, and this recipe certainly fits the bill! I actually cooked this in our countertop roasting oven, and it came out *beautifully*. I only made one change - I added in some chopped carrots. Now, I definitely have ideas for different combinations - different kinds of sausages, different vegetables to add in. I wanted to take a photo of the finished product but it smelled so good cooking that my roommate and I fell on it like a pack of wolves. Next time, i promise!

I made this for my family of 7!  Everyone LOVED it!  I followed your recipe and directions and it was worth every minute of effort!  I prepped it in the afternoon, refrigerated it and then cooked it for dinner.  Thank you for this wonderful dish.  Simple but very flavorful!  ??

Made this for dinner this evening.  The peppers and onions carmelized very well and tasted great.  The entire family loved it.  Next time I may throw in a little garlic just because I think everything tastes better with garlic.  Will definitely make again.

This is an incredibly flavorful dish all wrapped up in roaster full of deliciousness.  I've used pork Italian sausage and turkey Italian sausage with very little difference.  This is the perfect dish for guests as this is a real crowd pleaser.

This dish was spectacular. My family is a bit larger so it required additional chicken and increased ingredients. However, following the recipe with the increases was not a problem. As soon as it was done, it was gone!! 
It will definitely be a dish I will be making many times.

Fantastic and fairly easy.  I like that the recipe uses the seasoning and fat from cooking the sausage to amplify the flavor of the potatoes, peppers, and chicken.  Next time, I will add some roasted fennel seed to the bowl before mixing.   60 minutes cooking time was spot on!   Well done Chef John!!

Made this last night and found it lacking in something, it was bland. I followed the directions fairly closely. I didn’t want to overlook it, so I roasted in a 400 degree oven for an hour & broiled for the last 5 minutes. It seemed to have a lot of liquid left in the bottom of the pan.  I don’t think this dish will be repeated.

I followed the recipe as stated and was happy with the outcome.  The chicken was incredibly tender and flavorful.  Oddly, I did not have much juice left from frying the sausage but added all that was there as well as extra olive oil.  The outcome was good, but it was a bit dry -- some potatoes stuck to the bottom of the pan and the sausage dried out and was overly crunchy.  Next time, I'll add some broth to ensure enough liquid is in the pan.  Still, a solid recipe that I'll make again.

Easy and delicious! This dish travels well and warms up beautifully as a next-day lunch.  I've made this recipe several times and have shared it with my mom. She adds carrots and celery, which makes this dish even better and easily increases the veggie-quotient. I will happily add this dish to my regular lineup!

It was delish!  I am definitely making this again.  I only made a few small changes.  After browning the sausage, I browned the chicken thighs as well, to make sure they were crispy.  Also, the sausage ended up being pretty dry so next time I plan on just throwing them in at the last minute so they don't overcook.  Other than that, the dish was amazing.  The sweet peppers, onions, seasoning, and parsley made it super flavorful.  My husband loved it and said it tasted like something you would get at a high end Italian restaurant.

The recipe is great just as is. The seasonings were perfect. I did use hot Italian sausage and used 5 links. The only thing I would do differently is to cut the peppers into large pieces.

This is so good. I used kielbasa, boneless thighs, colored little potatoes, 3 peppers, 2 onions and added mixed carrots too. I had a lot, so I sprinkled more Italian seasoning on the top. I line my pan with foil for easy clean up. The boneless thighs make it easy to eat.

Made it.  Got great reviews  last night.  I used mild Italian sausages.  Since I did not want to haul out my roasting pan, I used a 13 x 9 Pyrex lined with aluminum foil. I did reduce the recipe by a third, but I still have leftovers for tonight. 
Great meal!

Wonderful! Followed recipe very closely. Only changes were that I only had mild Italian sausage (instead of hot) and a green bell pepper (instead of a variety). This dish was delish and it was so easy to make. It will become a staple in my rotation!

Pretty good. Easy to make, a complete dinner, and quite tasty.

I found the chicken to be a little lacking on flavour, but just slightly, and the skin was really good. The key to this recipe is by far the hot italian sausages (and poking them!), as all that spice goes everywhere.

I had some difficulty cutting my sausages after cooking them, as the raw meat oozed out in many of the slices, so next time I will cook them a little longer first so they cut better I think.

Great flavor. Made as is, except scaled the servings down and didn’t add the parsley. I hate parsley. I also cooked in a cast iron. My favorite part is the sausage, I may make again omitting the chicken. I will call it Trisha’s Sausage, Potatoes, Onion and Peppers or Sausage, Potatoes, Onion and Peppers Trisha. Not sure which one. Thanks for the great recipe Chef John. Love your videos.

Loved this!  I made it in my iron skillet and it came out delicious. I used mild sausage, tomatoes and two types of peppers from my garden along with sage, basil and parsley that I also grow. I added basil flavored olive oil along with the sausage grease.

I love this recipe - did not work well when I tried to double it though. Also works better with small peppers. Large peppers have too much water contact and then it doesn't roast as well

Used my convection oven at 425 and many of my mini peppers were black and inedible.  I just didn't want to heat up the conventional oven.  However the peppers that survived were delicious and the chicken was outstanding !  Definitely will be in cooking rotation when it's cooler.

Excellent.  I have 2 hints.  Definitely add more olive oil.  My sausage was a little dry.  It is probably related to the fat content in the sausage but more oil doesn't hurt.  Line your pan with foil.  I'll be cleaning my roasting pan for a month.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this exactly as the recipe suggested ( with the exception of the Italian parsley because the market didn't have it that day).  All four of us really enjoyed it!  It was really simple and smelled great cooking.   I did it on a sheet pan and it looked lovely when done.  The juices from everything was yummy. And the chicken was perfect!  It will remain in my cooking repertoire, for sure.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it wasn't "over the top amazing".  Quite a happy little meal, though.

I have made this quite a few times and it has been a hit, both at home and with the ladies at work! Tonight I am making it again, but I’m going to omit the chicken and use 10 sausages. I find that I fill up on the sausages and veggies and eat very little chicken! I guess its like making just sausage and peppers lol

I already had mild sausage, russet potatoes, and orange and yellow bell peppers on hand.   I added big chunks of carrots and 1, 8 oz, whole Baby Bella mushrooms (adding 2, 8 oz's next time)    It turned out wonderful.   A tad greasy for 5 stars.  Made excellent leftovers.  Will definately make this again.

2 changes I made were —chicken legs and 2 yellow onions because I didn’t have purple onion or thighs. This was a nice dish. I tweaked the recipe in that I browned the chicken. I also seasoned the chicken with various spices—lightly..

We made it in a toaster oven with just 2 chicken thighs and proportionally less vegetables. This recipe is definitely on our repeat list.

This version I roasted 10 Cornish Hens and a very spicy Louisiana Sausage, I stuffed the Hens with Lemon, Garlic Gloves, Rosemary, and Thyme. This recipe is incredible, you can use chicken quarters and Italian sausages, which I cooked in olive oil and chipotle pepper ...this was so awesome!  All this marinated together for 6 hours plus then roasted in the oven at 425 for 1.25 hours.

Followed recipe but doubled it for a large family.  Used hot sausage in one pan and mild in the other.  I should have rotated the pans and kept a closer eye on them.  The bottom pan got a little burned on the bottom being closer to the oven element.  Also should have pulled out at around 45 minutes.  I left them in for almost 55 minutes and things were a little overdone but I did get some nice caramelization on the chicken but the potatoes didn't brown up as I had hoped.  Even with poking the sausage and draining most of the grease before adding to the mix the dish still came out pretty greasy.  I most likely will not make this again.  If I do I may cook off the chicken a little to render the some of the fat out before putting everything into the roasting pan.

All Chef John's recopies are exceptional. I made this with bacon grease (instead of pork sausage) and bone-in pork chops (browned stovetop first in the grease). So good, so good.

Even my super picky husband who rarely compliments anything liked it. We both agree that it was greasy though and that draining the grease before serving is a must. I used half hot and half mild sausage. The heat was just right for my family.

I recently made this again and changed it up a little. I used a less fatty bratwurst instead of the Italian sausage, jar of grilled Piquillo peppers instead of the fresh pepper and duck fat instead of olive oil. It was just as fantabulous as the original recipe

This is so easy, followed the recipe as per the video. Make sure the chicken is cooked thru. You can add extras from your  chiller drawer and add spices to suit. Experiment, you wont be disappointed.

Big hit. Made it exactly as described, but had a few grape tomatoes in the fridge which I tossed in for the last 10 minutes. Everybody had 2nds. Also made Colcannon. I know, lots of potatoes, but it made a nice compliment texturally. Dead easy, and very tasty. Crusty bread a good option as well.

Its good. I bought a giant package of chicken thighs, so I only used some. The Lock brothers bought Allrecipes, they own it now. I guess, they want to know what we like to eat. Well, we like this recipe!

This is a wonderful dish; a complete meal in itself. I had to use mild Italian sausage because I could not find the hot ones. After reading other reviews and thinking about how hot my oven cooks; I cooked this dish at 425 degrees for 45 minutes. The potatoes, peppers and onion  were firm and tender, the chicken was nice and juicy. If you are looking for a heavy flavor from the herbs, you may be disappointed. This dish has a nice mild hint of the herbs which I really enjoyed. It did not have a whole lot of juice but the amount produced was really good with a crusty roll. My husband kept asking for the name of the dish and even went back for seconds. I will make this again.

So Good! Followed exactly except I had to use a oversized baking sheet as my roasting pans are all out of reach and not easy to get to.  (Will fix that before I make this again).  I used 4 kinds of  sweet peppers but followed everything else the same. So good! Easy to get in the oven, easy to clean up and easy to eat.  Had leftovers for lunch.  Love this recipe, thanks Chef John. Another great keeper.

Easy. Amazing flavors, especially the veggies.  DO NOT skimp on the veggies. Be sure to warm a crusty bread to soak up those delicious pan juices.

This is my "go-to" comfort meal for the cold weather! The only thing I do differently is seasoning and browning the chicken thighs for about 3 minutes per side before they go in the oven. This cuts down the oven cooking time and I love crispy chicken skin!

I think 450 is too hot, the chicken came out nicely, as did the peppers, but some of the onions and sausage were fairly burnt after 1 hour at 450.

This is a good recipe but it makes a lot and the potatoes don't reheat very well. I will reduce the amount of potatoes I make next time. We will eat the potatoes with it the first time and then have the rest for leftovers.

I'd make this again but I wouldn't cook the sausage as much beforehand, it dried out too much!
Not as large a roasting pan either but we just lived this recipe

Followed to the letter as I do first run on most recipes. Results: delicious, will make again, like likely to change a thing and already recommended to several fellow foodies. 

Now Chef John,  please seek counseling concerning that olive oil fetish.

I find it a little greasy, so beware. I also think the peppers should be added half way through cooking or they get very soggy. I Brown the chicken as well as the sausage and then cook at 360 for an hour and it turns out perfectly. Thanks!

Made it as written (scaled back to four servings) and liked the flavor a lot.  Not a huge fan of thighs, though, especially with the bone in.  I wonder if boneless, skin-on breasts would work    May try that next time.

Was delicious! Used chilli olive oil and added mushrooms because I love them and like it extra spicy. Cozy food for the snowstorm currently happening outside!

This turned out excellent. My kids and my husband loved it. I ran out of olive oil so I had to use vegetable oil. After baking for an hour, I I put the chicken thighs on top and broiled them a few minutes so the skin was crispy.  I will definitely make this again.

Easy peasy and yummy as all get out. A lot of people complain of no flavour or burned onions. You have to use what the recipe calls for, including kosher salt or else you're not making this recipe. Part way through, mix things up and tuck you onions ...and anything else burning....in and under.
