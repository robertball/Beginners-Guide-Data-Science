Oh my god!! These are the best ever! Sooo light and fluffy... no idea what the 'dense' comments were all about. (Try not to add the listed amount of flour... I didn't add the listed amount and mine turned out fine. Just be sure to change the the directions around... Dissolve the sugar into the warm water, then add yeast. Let it sit for 10mins. Then add milk (replace the water with milk), oil, and beaten egg. Then add listed amount of flour, and salt. Add the remaining flour if required. Also, when baking- be really careful of the baking time. Mine baked perfectly in the minimum time-12mins.

My nephew (9) and I recently made this. I followed the recipe exactly and was surprised when it turned out like the school bread that I used to love!!! It was crisp on the outside and soft and doughy inside... so delicious!!! My husband has yet to try it, so I will definately be making this again.

TERRIFIC!  I made these tonight and they were simply terrific.  Recipe is fail proof too apparently - I changed the milk to water as we have lactose issues in the house and I used 2 yolks left over from ones I needed to separate in another bread yesterday in place of the whole egg.  They tasted just like the golden egg bread from the store - ONLY FRESH! Oh - and I did cut the sugar in half too just because i didnt want too sweet of a roll for dinner.  SO *****5 stars for a great recipe i could not mess up!  Rolls were still fresh at breakfast too!......
******************************************Been making these for almost a year now and they remain our favorite diner rolls from this site.  If you are considering them for your holiday meal then please try them!  I have mine made, baked and frozen already for Thanksgiving dinner - just defrost, heat and serve - they are so good and very easy!

My mom couldn't believe I made these.  They were so yummy.  I made them for Thanksgiving.  I cooked them before I put the turkey in the oven in the morning, and then I popped them back in the oven while I was letting my turkey rest.  That way everyone had nice warm rolls.  Excellent recipe! These are my personal notes:  Dissolve the sugar into the warm water, then add yeast. Let it sit for 10mins. Then add milk (replace the water with milk), oil, and beaten egg. Then add listed amount of flour, and salt. Add the remaining flour if required. Also, when baking- be really careful of the baking time

Used my new KA Mixer, and I used the dough hook all the way! Step one needed some scaping down the bowl but once it was all mixed, I let it knead for 8 minutes! Make sure you only add 1/4 cup flour at a time at the end....I did not need all the flour(right at 3 cups total) but it all depends on your flour and the moisture in the air. These are so so SOFT and FLUFFY! Almost like Parkerhouse dinner rolls but tastier! Great recipe!

These where pretty good.  Made two times....the second time, I did follow the ingred. order from the reviewer above me and I think they did turn out better.  24 rolls worked perfect in my 9x13 stone casserole dish.

Using my Kitchen Aid to combine the ingredients, this took physically no more than 20 minutes. I followed this recipe closely, only using regular yeast (I did NOT have rapid rise), melted butter instead of shortening and AP flour instead of bread flour. I let the yeast sit with the warm milk/water and sugar for 10 minutes in the mixer bowl, then added the egg, butter and the dry ingredients. This only needed a couple more tablespoons of flour to get it to form a solid ball so I could knead it with the dough hook. This rose beautifully both times. The first time I let it rise, it took an hour to double on the warm heating pad in a greased, covered bowl--the second time I let it rise, I used my dry 1/4 measuring cup to form uniform rolls, rolled them into a nice ball and set them in a greased muffin tin and covered it with saran wrap and set it to rise on the warm heating pad for a half hour. I got 11 good sized rolls out of one recipe--not 24. 400* for 12 minutes and they were ready to go. The butter brushed over the top was just WONDERFUL. Lightly sweet, very nice yeast dinner roll. VERY easy. I'll make this recipe again. NOTE: BE SURE you double this recipe if you want more than 11-12 rolls. This does not make the full 24 that it states. If you're making this for a large gathering/group, you'll want to adjust the servings.

Made the rolls today and they were great.  My family eat them before we served dinner.  Will have to make again real soon.

These rolls turned out great and very tastey.  I rubbed butter on the tops about 5 minutes before they were done.  Yummy!  They were a heavier roll, but that's the way we like them.  Also It didn't make 24 rolls, it only made about 12 medium sized rolls.

Mine weren't nearly as pretty as the picture.  In fact, they almost had a biscuit-like appearance on top, which I attribute to my lack of experience with yeast doughs.  Fortunately, they tasted MUCH better than they looked.  Soft on the inside, with a nice crust on the edge (topped off with a little melted butter as soon as I removed from the oven)--my family loved these!  Even the picky kiddos loved them, and that's saying a LOT.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!  This will be the one I use when I have the time.

I was in a hurry so I put all the ingredients, wet first, then dry followed by shortening into my bread machine and ran on bread setting, when done continued to step 3 and it worked fantastic.  A Keeper for sure!

It was easier to make than I had expected. The rolls tasted really great and my family loved them too! They kept questioning me if I had made them out of a box, haha. This is a keeper!

i'm giving this four out of five stars only because i found the recipe directions to be unclear regarding the rising phases. it said to cover and rise til doubled in size, then make the individual rolls, brush with butter, cover and rise again, then cover and rise again! and being a newbie in the bread making dept. i got real confused! LOL, but in the end, with a little (okay, a lot) of help from my friends on the exchange...they turned out better than i expected. they were fantastic. i will make these again and again! thanks for sharing puddin pie:)

Great recipe!  Made these this morning & they turned out so yummy!  I started the yeast in the milk, water & sugar and didn't need all the flour - I live at a high altitude & don't know if that's the reason or not, but I never have to add as much flour as a recipe calls for. I determine how much to use by adding in small amounts until dough comes away from the bowl easily then stop regardless of how much I've used or what the recipe calls for.  If I add more, I have heavy bread, so that may be why some people found these heavy??

You would not believe how easy and delicious these are!  I make them every chance I get!  They remind me of the warm yeast rolls from the cafeteria in elementary school.  Make sure to have plenty of butter handy!

This is an excellent recipe for bread making and I used it about 4-5 times when we have large family meals, The rolls dont' even last until dinner is served, I have substituted butter for the shortning, add another 1/4 cup of sugar and let rise for about 2 1/2 hrs, this makes them lighter and fluffier, Thanks puddin pie for a great receipe!

The first time I made these, I did the recipe as is and it was a bit sweet for me.  The second time I cut down and it wasn't sweet enough for the kiddies but perfect for me. I think I found the goldylocks zone on the third batch. 1/8 cup plus 1 tbsp sugar is more than enough. After cutting the dough into chunks I also poked the center and filled them with lightly glazed vidalia onions in all but the ones for the kids. They increase well for sandwiches too provided you leave enough room in between them for expansion and even cooking. Thanks for the recipe. Next time, the onions go in all of them so I get a taste before little hands make off with the goods.

I made these rolls exactly as the recipe says and they were awesome!!!! I have tried a lot of homemade roll recipes and not had a lot of luck.  Most of the time my rolls are extremely heavy. These rolls were light and very tasty! My children thought they were better than store bought! Definitely keeping this recipe at the top of the bread recipes!

WOW! I have always feared the attempt to make a sweet dinner roll --- but NO MORE SO!!! THis was sooo easy to make. if you follow the directions there is NO WAY you can mess it up! They were so light and fluffy, i should have used a bigger pan as they really rise up nice. My husband asked me several times if i REALLY made them - yes sir, yes sir! I always make a recipe exactly the first time - next time i think i will add some herbs, but that's only as i like herbs, but it was a PERFECT dinner roll - thank you Puddin Pie!!!!

Made with Christmas dinner. One of the easiest yeast recipes I've ever used. Dough came together very quickly, not much needing was necessary.  Rose very well. Baked up quick. DELICIOUS, soft, warm and sweet. A new favorite here.

I was slightly disappointed with the texture of these rolls, but maybe it is because I used butter instead of shortening; I won't take off for that since it was my choice!  The flavor was really great, but I found them to be slightly crumbly, instead of fluffy, like I really wanted.  I followed all of the rising times (all three of them).  I would consider trying these again, just because the taste was really lovely.  Thank you for sharing this with us, Puddin Pie!

These rolls were a huge hit at Thanksgiving this year.  I followed the recipe exactly, and they came out chewy and  absolutely delicious.  I have been asked to make a double batch next year!  The only thing I did differently is that the recipe says it will make 24 rolls.  I found, if I had done that, they would have been incredibly small.  I did about 18 rolls (9 per pan) and they were the perfect dinner size.

Great rolls - light and fluffy, tastes like slightly buttery plain bread. I followed mayura's ingredient ordering which worked out very well. I had some problems with the dough being too moist and sticky but that's probably because I'm not too experienced with bread-making. Will likely play around with the recipe to see if I can give it more flavor and solve my stickiness problem, but I will definitely use it again!

Rolls turned out very nice-- despite the obvious typos in the directions. I did not proof the yeast beforehand- just tossed it all in and went to mixing. Ended up only needed about 3 cups of flour. Fit perfectly in my 9x13 pan, and made 24 soft delicious rolls. I will definitely be making these again.

Have made these several times and they are absolutely delicious.  They freeze well and I just heat them in foil in the oven and they are just like freshly made buns.  My family loves them.  Could not be an easier recipe.  I do all by hand, no mixer, and they are just as good.  Good with everything.

I made these rolls today and I was not real happy. I followed the recipe/directions to a T, and still the rolls didn't rise. Once baked I thought they looked OK but they were "heavy" and quite stiff. The flavor was ok. Not sure what went wrong, but I think I will try a different recipe next time.

These rolls are fantastic.   Just a note that the recipe only yields 24 buns (not 48 as suggested by the instructions to divide each half into 48 equal portions).
They are soft, sweet and delicious - thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe for the first time today. I am very pleased with how easy it is to use.
The rolls turned out so light that you have to spread jam and butter on them to keep them from flying off of the plate!

We loved these, I didn't have any regular milk, so I substituted coconut milk and there wasn't a single roll left for the next day. 
I also didn't have rapid rise yeast, so I used the warm water and sugar to proof 3 teaspoons of yeast for about 10 minutes. This will be a staple for our family!

OMG!!! These are the easiest rolls to make and they are the best! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and dissolved the sugar into the warm water and then added the yeast.  These rolls turned out light and fluffy. My family couldn't stop eating them. This recipe is definately a keeper!

I LOVE this recipe! I've made it twice and will continue to make it.  The only suggestion I have is to roll the dough into balls about 1 1/2 inhes thick so that the rolls turn out a good size.

After asking my mother-in-law for her homemade roll recipe and trying it twice this past weekend (both times were a fail), I decided to try this one. I used the dough setting on my breadmaker. Used margarine instead of shortening and for the yeast I used 1.5 teaspoons of regular yeast. Baked at 350° for 15 minutes but they came out a little darker than I like so will try baking for 13 or 14 minutes next time. Thanks so much for this recipe, they turned out PERFECT!!!!

These rolls were very good but take a long time to raise.  I would add a bit more yeast next time, maybe another 1/4 teaspoon.

I have tried it twice and while the flavor of the rolls is good, neither batch has risen as I would have expected and the rolls have ended up a bit dense and heavy. I even used my proofing setting on my oven the second time, and let them rise over an hour on both rises. They’ve been eaten but overall, a disappointment to me. I was expecting those light fluffy rolls we used to get in our school cafeterias years ago and these are a far cry. I don’t think I’ll make them again.

This whole recipe is wrong in my opinion.  First the method is wrong- liquid is always first and dry ingredients added to the liquid.  I tried it the way the recipe suggested and it was a mess and had to throw away.  I didn’t find anything good about this recipe.

I follwed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I used convect bake. I will try Conventional bake next time as after 7 minutes they were turning a dark brown. My DH and son still loved them, however, so am very pleased! I give 5 stars as it is totally my fault that they were slightly overbaked!

Need it egg and dairy free? I've been making these for years and they work just fine with any/all of these alternatives.
I have used bread, all purpose or whole wheat pastry flour.
I always use unsweetened almond milk but I'm sure soy would also work. 
Instead of the egg, I put 2 T. ground flax seed into a glass measuring cup and then add water to come up to the 1/4 c. line. Then mix with a fork. (If your flax seed smells fishy, it's rancid - grind it yourself and always keep the seeds refrigerated or frozen.) 
I have also used Spectrum non-hydrogenated shortening on occasion.
I use Earth Balance Soy-Free Buttery Spread or Smart Balance Original Spread instead of the butter.  Smart Balance tastes closer to real butter.
Best baked in non-shiny pans as they don't brown properly on the bottom in shiny ones. They are very yeasty when they first come out of the oven, but that dissipates as they cool.
These turn out very dense if you are unable to bake them immediately after the rolls rise. I tried punching down the dough and reforming the rolls to let rise again,  like you can do with some other dough, but that did not work with this recipe. My guess is that it is because of the rapid rise yeast.

This is my absolute favorite dinner roll. They are sweet, soft, dense and beautiful. I have made them with all purpose and bread flour with great results. I have also added extra sugar and honey to the dough as well. Very yummy! Thank you for the wonderful recipe. I will be making these til the day I die!!!

Excellent recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter. The texture of the rolls was very light and soft. I added this one to my recipe folder and will be making this again.

First batch I followed previous reviews and started yeast following directions on package using 1/4 cup warm water and added the sugar to water/yeast mixture allowing to sit for 10 mins. While yeast was sitting I took remaining 1/4 cup warm water and added the warm milk, salt and egg. Then beat on low. I then added 2 cups of All Purpose flour and made hole in middle for yeast mixture. After pouring yeast mixture in middle of flour I mixed till formed together. I did not need to add any more flour before turning out onto well floured surface. I did knead dough with bout 1/4 cup of flour on surface. After dough doubled I push dough down once with fingers. I didn't divide and cut instead I  pinched piece with two fingers and thumb with right hand and squeeze/pinch off dough between thumb and first finger of left hand. Then holding pinched piece of dough in left hand between thumb and finger I push dough up from bottom with finger tips of right hand and squeeze with left thumb and first finger to make a smooth ball. If dough sticks to fingers use small amount of shortening on hands. This process is a little hard to explain and was learned by watching grandmother and mother do this as a child.  It becomes easier and faster with practice. I melted butter and brushed on top of dough balls and sprinkled white sugar (like grandma) lightly on top before covering to rise on top of my preheating oven. This yielded 24 nice size rolls for me. I have made this recipe many times now and have

These were a HUGE hit with everyone for our weekly family dinner. The grand kids each ate way more of the rolls than my stew. Easy recipe.  I was too lazy to go get bread flour and Crisco, can't imagine they'd be better, so AP flour, butter worked fine. I also used my dough hook on my mixer as another reviewer had. For Thanksgiving I think I'll spend more time shaping them for looks.

These were my first try at making homemade rolls and they turned out fantastic!! The only change I made was proofing the yeast before hand because I didn't have any rapid rise yeast. I was reading comments before hand and only made 12 buns. I think I should have made more though because they turned out huge - but SO delicious! This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

I've tried several recipes for yeast rolls and this is by far the best! I've most recently used whole wheat flour and it's even better!!????

Too much flour, it didn't pull together. It was so dense that I couldn't knead it. Flour amount should be decreased.

I followed the revised instructions of dissolving the sugar in water then add yeast and let sit for 10 minutes. I accidentally grabbed a 2/3 c for the sugar, as I was doubling the recipe. Everyone LOVED the little sweetness to the bread. I am DEFINITELY keeping this recipe! One of the best I have tried!

Love these.  Thankyou! I made them exactly as instructed and everyone loved them, even my parents who have had their fair share of homemade bread/buns.  Will be my bread/buns recipe from now on. I doubled the recipe, if I am making bread I want lots.  I reserve alittle dough and make a few cinnimon buns with it too!
