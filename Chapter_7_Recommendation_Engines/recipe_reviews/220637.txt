I added  what I had in the fridge but this recipe is a great base.  I also put it in a crockpot to let the vegis soften a bit

Delicious!!! Try using fresh ingredients and making the beans rather than canned, less sodium. Great soup!

Super easy and great! Followed almost exactly as written. I ended up dividing my chicken broth (2 cups low sodium + 2 cups regular) to get the salt level right and threw a diced carrot in there because I do that with pretty much all of my family meals. Served to my wife and daughter after the came home from sledding. They loved it.

Only thing I did differently was add finely chopped red pepper (only half) and 3 more cups of water along with the broth. Otherwise same portions and it was yummy! I also did add spice/hot sauce because I love spicy soups!!

Delicious and very easy.  I didn't use cabbage and added a tsp flour, extra can of beans and a little pasta because I like bean soup thick. Am guessing the cabbage would have accomplished that, but I didn't have any. Ditalini or shells are good choices - just a small amount, because they soak up a lot of broth.

I added 1 extra liter of water and 2 chicken bouillon cubes. I love cabbage and ham so I added a bit more than the recipe called for. If you're a bean lover, definitely add the second can. Came out delish!

This one is a goodie!!! I made a batch of fresh pinto beans, in place of the canned and used the pinto bean broth instead of the chicken broth. I substituted white rice in place of the potatoes and I added a few stalks of carrots. Amazing!!!

I just made this today. Only I did change some things because I am always using the things I have on hand that I can from my products. I used pork broth (2 pints) and pepper ham hocks and 1 pint of home made salsa, and dried beans. I also added 2 tbsp. cornstarch mixed with a little cold water to thicken it. When DH likes it it has stood the ultimate test. Excellent with homemade biscuits (just because I didn't make cornbread.
