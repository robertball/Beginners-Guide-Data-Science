This is quite good but changed a few things.   I halved the recipe and used about 3 cups of frozen broccoli (after running it through the microwave for a few minutes, it was reduced to about 2 1/2 cups).   I also used 1/2 cup of Panko crumbs (instead of stale bread) sauted with the butter until golden.  The sauce was very good and I would recommend this recipe.  Very nice and smooth and tasty.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I will use it again!

While the basics of this recipe were fine, the proportions in the recipe are wrong.  5 Tablespoons of butter is never going to incorporate 1 1/2 CUPS of flour!  Use the same amount of butter with about 1/3 cup of flour. Also the sauce was a bit bland. I used fresh garlic and my own homemade Worcestershire sauce and it turned out good. I'm a Professional Chef but hadn't made Broccoli au gratin in years, so looked it up.

Had difficulty with making the bread crumbs - bread was not dry enough.  Would definitely make again using purchased breadcrumbs!

Original recipe makes a lot (serve 10-12).  I added a rice mix which gave it more color.  With the basic recipe,  other items could be added and or changed. Will use again.

Excellent. Great way for non-brocoli eaters to get a tasty vegetable dish that they will enjoy.

This turned out pretty good. Next time I will add some cayenne or chili flakes for some heat.
