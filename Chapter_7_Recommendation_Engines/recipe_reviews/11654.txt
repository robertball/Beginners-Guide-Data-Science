I made these after making 4 other good kinds of cookies. Once my husband tasted these, the other cookies got barely touched til these were gone. You do have to grease the pan, and may have to adjust baking time just a bit, but these were sooooo good. I made a glaze from powdered sugar, milk and a few drops of anise extract and drizzled it on with a fork. They were delicious!

These are easy and taste great. Be sure to grease the pan. The batter more like a cake than cookie don't let that worry you. Wonderful. I made these also in a lemon version: omit anise; add 1 Tablespoon lemon extract and 1 teaspoon fresh lemon zest.

This cookie definitly beats Stella Doro Anise Cookie!! This cookie is crisp on the outside and very soft on the inside.  A big hit at my family parties.

This is very simular to a recipe I made often as a teen, over 25 years ago.  I loaned the cookbook that wan't returned and have been searching ever since.  I am so excited to have this again.  It's easy to make and everyone loved it.  Have fun and enjoy !

Oh, yum!  These are fantastic.  My kids love them, my husband was curious about where I got them - he didn't think I could make something this good - actually, it looks and tastes elaborate, but is so easy to make. Be sure to grease your pan.  The cutting and transfer to cookie sheet was easy.  To toast them, I put the oven rack on a lower shelf then broiled on low for a few minutes.  Similar to an anisette toast that I buy. Next time I will add a little more extract.

This is definitely a biscotti and not a cookie. It is a good base recipe for a soft sponge biscotti. I made this with brown sugar, cinnamon and lemon extract. I would put 2 tsp of extract next time for a more definite lemon taste. I glazed the top added sprinkles for more sweetness and a festive look in the photo. Make a nice big batch.

These were beyond expectations and were not only easy to make, they were so delicious.  I have been having a hankering for the anisette sponge I used to get many years ago when I lived in New York and these were right on the money, if not even better.  The flavor and texture were perfect.  They look beautiful and I am proud to serve them.  Definite keepers.  And they didn't even fall apart while  slicing like ordinary biscotti.  i plan to try them next with some candied fruit and nuts, which is my favorite.  Thank you so much!

these should just be called biscotti. especially if you follow the recipe exactly and put them back in the oven to brown on both sides. next time, i'll only pop them back in to toast one side. also, would be nice if these had some sort of icing on the top. they're very plain. or rather the anise flavor is very delicate, which is nice for a mature pallet but not that exciting. overall, would prob make this again bc i have a lot of anise extract, and no other recipes that call for it are this easy.

So much easier than a regular biscotti recipe (I always have a devil of a time cutting the slices for the second baking - they always want to crumble).  My only concern is that they tasted quite "eggy" to me (husband and son didn't notice).  Next time I make this, I will use one less egg - in addition to eliminating the "eggy" flavor, it should also make the batter a little more dense, which should make the final product even more like biscotti.  I'll let you know how it turns out.  I also added 2 T. anise seeds, just because I like them!  Thanks for a delightful recipe - I love biscotti!

I have made these several times and they always come out wonderful - crisp on the outside, tender in the middle. My boyfriend would eat it as a cake before the slicing and second baking, if I would let him. Even those who think they don't like anise will like these.

Love this recipe.The texture was out of this world,light and crisp.I use a small amount of anise oil and anise seeds instead of extract and these were exactly like the ones my grandmother made (she died before we could write down her recipes-she never measured anything anyway but everything was always fabulous) This basic recipe will take any combo of flavorings

So tasty, perfect ! Very easy to make, they are tender, and perfect when you are so hungry for the Sicilian Anise , you can mix them up so quickly.

I've made this recipe for Christmas every year since I found it in our local newspaper. I'm happy to find it online so it can go into my pinterest account.  We absolutely love these.  I wish all biscotti  recipes used this method. So easy.
