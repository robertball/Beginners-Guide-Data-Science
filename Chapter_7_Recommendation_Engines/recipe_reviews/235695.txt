This was pretty good. I did switch it up a little though. Right after I put the ham on I added sautéed mushrooms and onions only to half cuz my hubby doesn't like mushrooms. I had some cloverleaf rolls leftover from dinner last night that worked really well. I used only 5 eggs and used half milk and half heavy cream.I also added a little garlic salt and a sprinkle of mustard powder to the eggs. I cooked it ten extra minutes and put tomatoes on top when it was done then salt/peppered them as I don't like hot cooked tomatoes as much. I needed a recipe for an egg bake that didn't need to be refrigerated all night and this fit the bill. I will make again but I'll add a little more spices for more flavor.

Yummy!  I cut the bread in half (not much of a bread eater) and used brown sugar honey ham slices.  Sprinkled some garlic powder over the cheese (used grated cheddar) and replaced the tomatoes with fried onion crumbles.  soooooo good!

This is very good, and simple recipe.  I made no changes to it, and will make it again, exactly the same.

Great! Quick & easy. We usually have the main ingrediants on hand & add or swap  out others as needed.
5 stars, it's so easy even I can make it!

This recipe puts in mind the correct proportions of bread, eggs and milk.  So then adding your own ideas comes easy.

Loved this easy breakfast recipe , after I added the ham I added in sautéed mushrooms and onions and it was delicious. I didn't have any tomatoes on hand so I used a can (not a whole can) of smoked tomatoes and it was perfect ! I only made one serving and used two eggs instead of one. I will definitely make this again .!

Delicious. I wouldn’t change a thing, however, it would be great even if you add peppers, mushrooms, try different cheeses, etc. It will definitely be an easy go-to meal at our house.

This is a very good basic recipe - I had to cook it an extra 5 minutes or more but otherwise it was very good. This could easily be dressed up with veggies, different meats, cheeses and seasoning. Thank you.

I added spinach and onion, used garlic powder in the egg mixture and used half and half instead of milk. I didn’t use the bread. It was flavorful and turned out good. It took 50 minutes to bake.

Excellent modified frittata recipe. I liked the addition of the bread cubes (I used the rest of an old French loaf I had). I also reduced the cheese by almost a cup by having a little lighter hand than the measurements noted. I also increased the baking time by 15 mins due to the center not being cooked, but it baked up nicely. A keeper!

Very good. I used shredded Tex-Mex style cheese for a spicy "bite", and diced some leftover cooked ham. My better half wasn't crazy about the the bread base layer, so next time I'll try a potato base.

Used organic wheat bread with crust still on, warmed in oven till crispyish then cut into one inch cubes. Changed cheese to grated mozzarella and cheddar and used about 1/4 cup canned roasted tomatoes. With ground garlic/sea salt. Baking was tricky to get even, dish was too deep and small... was delicious!!

I have made this twice and both times the recipe turned out very well.  onions and mushrooms were my addition the second time I made it and for me I enjoyed that more.

I made this one with gluten free bread and extra eggs for a larger crowd. It is always a winner!

I would definitely make this again, but I would use more bread. I don't think I used enough. I also would've baked it a little longer. Great recipe.

6 26 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/235695/ham-and-cheese-egg-bake/ ... Eight ounces seemed like a lot of ham so I used less.  'Used less cheese, too & it was still a bit overcheesy for me.  Kinda fluffy/creamy omelette-ish.  A good beginner recipe for sure.  The bread wasn't so obvious - more to absorb the egg mixture.  Easily improved with add-ins.  :)  I added a bit of heavy cream to the eggs, too.
