Great dish! I made it lowfat by omitting the butter and using less oil. I would also recommend either doubling the veggies, or cutting the pasta amount in half. The second time I made this, I added 1/2 cup thinly sliced red onion to the peppers, and it made a difference in the flavor!  Timesaver tip:  add the broccoli to the boiling pasta for 3-4 minutes, then scoop out and add to the red peppers.  Thanks for the recipe!

Read through a lot of the reviews and suggestions and also made a few modifications and it was excellent:  

No butter, only olive oil, for sauteeing.  One red bell pepper, one green bell pepper, three diced fresh tomatoes, ten oil cured black olives (when we couldn't find any anchovies), and three heaping soup spoons of diced fresh garlic from the Sams Club jumbo container.  Also a teaspoon and a half of salt

Strongly considered adding some red pepper flakes or salsa, but were afraid to push the envelope too much...

Instead of linguini, we used penne pasta, and it turned out as good as any Whole Foods pasta salad, delicious warm and room temperature.

I'm sorry but this was BORING! Others have stated to increase the oil/butter to equally spread over the lb of noodles, which is what I did but I would think that 1/2 cup of chicken broth or white wine would have been a much better option.  It wasn't that it tasted bad but basically, this meal was just butter, oil, noodles and broccoli.  I think it put my tatse buds to sleep.  Thanks anyways.

Very tasty! I found that a whole pound of Linguini was too much for the sauce/vegetables. I recommend only cooking half the box (1/2 pound) or else doubling the rest. I used half and it came out very nice.

I've made this dish about 5 times already and just love it! I've discovered though that i like to add more veggies than called for, and extra parmesan cheese.

Simple, uncomplicated, but delicious.  I skipped the garlic salt (seemed redundant considering you've already including fresh garlic) and as for the cooking method, the step of steaming the broccoli is not necessary - I simply sauteed it along with the red peppers.

I really enjoyed this dish. It makes for a very nice light supper with a green salad. It is a little dry, but I just added an extra tablespoon of olive oil. The flavors of the vegetables really come through.

Loved it, my daughter & I ate most of it ourselves.  It figures that on the day I go to get red peppers ...they have none.  I used 1 yellow & 1 orange pepper, it looked wonderful!  I did use double olive oil, YUM!  Some may not consider this a "meal" but worked great as a nice, light side dish, I'll also put it in my lunch rotation.  Thanks Chris!!

Molle888 - Great go to recipe when you want something light and fast!   Agreed there is not enough "sauce" for a pound of pasta.  I also add 1/2 red pepper flakes to kick it up.   I do substitute chicken broth/white wine for the veggie broth.   I've even thrown in grill boneless chicken breast at the end for additional protein.   Try it cold with cubes of mozzerella cheese and grape tomatoes for a side dish!

I made this last night for dinner along with garlic herb marinated chicken and a salad and it went well together.  My family does not like red bell peppers so I took that out and next time I will use twice as much broccoli.  I had to use more olive oil since it was dry.  It turned out good and I will make it again.

I added more olive oil and butter and it still was a little dry.  I also added 4 cloves garlic--next time I will add 5.  My husband, who is a meat and potatoes man, liked this.  Will make again, just adding more oil or maybe some chicken broth.

The flavors in this dish are great together. I blanched the broccoli in the microwave for about half as much time as the recipe suggests so it wouldn't be limp and overdone after sauteeing. One could also simply add it to the pasta pot for the last few minutes of cooking. I used a Romano + parmesan cheese blend for the cheese for more flavor than parmesan alone. Next time I'll change the proportions to more veggies, less pasta, as a good way to get more vegetables into my diet. PS I just noticed that a reviewer didn't like it, but didn't use any red pepper. Well, duh, that's about 1/3 of the dish ingredients, people!

Very good dish!  I have made this many times with whole grain spaghetti (for a little bit of a healthier version).  I have served this with grilled chicken and also with salmon mixed in and it was wonderful!  I have also added other veggies like zucchini....Thank you for sharing!!

I found this dish under the side dish area, and it suprises me that a few people think it's meant to be a main dish.
I did make a few changes to the recipe, I used spaghetti noodles, and added in yellow squash and some fire roasted tomato cabernet marinara sauce.  It was very good and simple to make.

Nothing too special.. I didn't add peppers because my mother is allergic to them; the linguini with the brocolli was too boring. There should have definetly been some sauce in there. Meatball sauce, perhaps. Otherwise, its a filler and VERY QUICK!

I usually just look for recipes to use as a guideline, and this one looked pretty good. I used regular thin spaghetti instead of linguini and used half of a green pepper, half of a red pepper and half of a yellow pepper along with the broccoli to give it more color. I used some italian seasonings while sauteeing the peppers and added a bit of parm cheese to the mix. I didnt see anything about tossing the pasta with oil, so i did that separately and then combined it with the veggies. It was really delicious. My SO and kids (3 years old and 10.5months) all devoured it! I will be making a rendition of this again in the future.

This is a pretty good basic recipe.  I was glad to find it and enjoyed it.  But it is not very flavorful to me.  I was happy to have some left overs, so I am going to add a bit more olive oil and some sun dried tomato pesto to it.  Perhaps I didn't add enough pepper... and maybe I overcooked the broccoli.

We really liked the dish a lot! I would suggest sauteing for a while - until the broccoli starts to break up into smaller pieces (about 25-30min at low -- keep an eye on it and stir). Also, cut the peppers VERY thin (Julie-anne style), this way the sweet flavor is shared throughout the entire dish. We loved the mix of flavors!!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I add some turkey kielbasa and use whole wheat past and make it a pretty healthy meal.  Sometimes I even grade some cheese on top and throw it in the oven to make is a baked casserole.  My husband loves it too!

This was surprisingly delicious.  I added 2 # of baby potobellas, sliced,  and 1 jar of chopped roasted red peppers in oil (drained) to the saute.  Added another tablespoon or two of butter and more than a pinch of garlic salt.  Hubby and I loved it!  Served it with Lemon Butter Chicken.

I added sliced mushrooms to the peppers, plus more garlic.  And I added the broccoli to the boiling water with my pasta.  We sprinkled extra parm on our servings.

I omitted the pasta, since I was already serving a main course with rice. Great broccoli and red bell pepper side dish! I found it needed a little more flavor at the end, and stirred in a lot of garlic salt. Next, I'll do it as a main course, but for hubby, I'll have to toss in some cooked chicken breasts! Thanks for the recipe!

This is similiar to another recipe I have.  I used 2 red peppers and would use more broccoli next time.  Oven- roasted vegetables worked great with this recipe also.

This was good! I have to agree with others to add something-tomatoes, broth, wine-to make it saucier and add flavor. I added about 1/2 a can of petite diced tomatoes to the veggies and it was perfect. If you like spice, add red pepper flakes. It was a great dinner! Plus quick and easy too-will def make it again!

i love that this is a really easy recipe. the brocolli in the microwave saved time & i didn't have to wash up another pot. i used spinach instead of bell peppers though just because i love spinach & it came out really good.

A very nice recipe. My husband has some diet restrictions (low fat and low acid)so we have a hard time having pasta because of the amounts tomato or high fat content. This dish was a nice treat. I used this as a side dish and scaled down to 2 servings. Personally, I think 6 minutes is way too long to cook the broccoli. I put it in for 2 minutes so it stayed mostly crunchy.

This was very good! I didn't give it 5 starts because there just wasn't anything too special about it. I cut up some chicken breast and sauteed it with the peppers and used whole wheat linguine - yum!

Made this for lunch with a few changes: I used yellow pepper and threw in a few mushrooms I had on hand. It has a very good taste but it definitely needs more spices and herbs. However, thanks for posting this : I'm always on the look for quick recipes featuring a lot of veggies!

Excellent! One of my favorite easy meals. I served this on the side with Broiled Tilapia Parmesan (from this site), and it was Delish. This goes great with fish, shrimp, chicken, scallops, or by itself. Don't forget a loaf of crusty Italian bread and a green salad.

OK...I ommitted the red pepper and I'm sure thats part of the reason why I had a bit of a problem with this. The peppers release water while they are cooking so I think there would have been more liquid to coat the pasta with. I used frozen chopped broccoli (was all I had on hand), cooked it in a half cup water with 1 chicken bouillon. Then sauted the garlic in the butter/oil then added the broccoli and all the oil was gone. Also there was too much pasta. Made like this I would use half a pound pasta and an extra tablespoon of both oil and butter. Some fresh herbs would add some nice flavor too!!

The sauce was a little dry, but I liked it that way.  I also cut down on some of the oil and butter, to make it a little healthier.

Excellent!!!  I moved out on my own and I wanted to prove that I could actually cook for my parents--threw this recipie together one night, made some garlic bread and a nice ceasar salad--what better way to impress them; it was even better than me taking them out to the Olive Garden!!!!  I recommend this recipie to anyone who loves Italian food!

First, I have to say that I did change the recipe up quite a bit, but it was a GREAT base recipe to make your own.  I ended up adding fresh mushrooms, an onion sliced up, and vegetarian chicken to it.  I used spaghetti noodles, a little more butter and olive oil (probably because I had more "stuff" in it, and doubled the amount of garlic.

My pan is not big enough to saute all the veggies at once, so I sauteed the garlic, onion, red pepper, and mushrooms together in the 3 Tbsp olive oil and 1 Tbsp butter till they were mostly cooked but still a little crispy, then used a slotted spoon and moved them into the pot of already cooked and drained pasta.  Then to the liquid that was left I added the steamed broccoli and Morning Star chicken and heated through.  Added that to the pasta with a little more olive oil and butter and mixed well.

My hubby didn't even know it was Morning Star Chicken and not the real thing, and it was so quick to make.

This was delicious!  Even my kids ate it!  I did add 1/2 cup of milk, as it seemed a bit dry.  Next time, I'll try adding it to the skillet before I mix with the linguine.

Very good.  It did need alittle more flavor. So I added some salt and basil olive oil.  It was great!   Also I have a spice called slap your mama...that kicked it up a bit too.  It's just a combo of salt, garlic powder and red pepper.

A good combination of veggies and an excellent side with sweet and sour meatballs.  I omitted the parmesan, but if I was eating this as a light entree, I'd certainly use it.

SIX YEAR OLD BOY ATE IT ALL!!!  Changed a few things, so can't give it a 5, as I didn't make it exact.  Added cheddar instead of Parm...  omitted butter & garlic salt.  Added 3 twists of sea salt.  Topped it with crushed seasoned garlic croutons & extra cheddar.  EXCELLENT!!!!!

I used only 8 ounces of pasta, as another reviewer suggested, but it still turned out dry.  I added crushed red peppers to zip up the flavor a little bit, but it really needed more moisture.  If I make this again, I will add some liquid or more olive oil.

I substituted mushrooms for the red peppers in an attempt to make it more palatable to my kids, but it didn't work. (They suddenly decided they didn't like broccoli.) I loved it. My husband added some hot sauce to it and loved it. I must say I ate waaaaaay to much of it by myself.

Nice taste and was quite fast to prepare. I stuck with the recipe, adding shallots and pesto in lieu of the butter. I will try adding a little cayenne pepper or chile pepper the next time around.
I also like my veggies crunchy so I microwaved the brocoli for 90 seconds and that was plenty.

I have made this twice and both times have had to change it up a bit. First I followed others advice, used rice and added mushrooms. Next time I used the pasta but found it bland, so I added soy sauce and made it into chinese style pasta with chicken! this turned out tasty, So all together I used soy sauce, mush. broc. garlic and peppers and slices of chicken breast.

This dish was kind of dry.  I think it would be better with a light cream sauce.

This is a really simple recipe so I thought it would taste pretty bland. I am becoming a vegetarian and that is why I tried this recipe. It was sooooo good, I just used 2 tblsp of canola oil and lemon pepper seasoning to season teh vegetables. I definitely recommend this!

This rocks!  Sometimes I make it into a main dish by adding chicken breast or (my wife's fave) pan fried and sliced chicken sausage.  Amazingly quick and tasty.

I cannot say enough about this recipe. It is flavorful, delicious, and light. I especially enjoy cooking it in the warmer weather as the pasta is not heavy at all. It's a wonderful way to take whatever seasonal veggies you have lying around (peppers, zucchini, broccoli, onions) and cook them in a new way to make a creative new side dish. It's a wonderful compliment to seasoned chicken or barbequed steak.

I gave 4 stars only because my 5 years old ate it. He is very picky and this is a good way to feed him broccoli and whole wheat noodles. Otherwise, I would give it 3 stars. Main problem: it was bland, it needs some spice in it. Next time I'll add some sausage. Took recommendations of other reviewers and used only half pound of linguini. Another problem is that broccoli and pepper come out really cooked if you cook by this recipe. So, if you like different texures in your food make some adjustments for cooking time. I like to try recipes as they presented by they authors, incorporating just a liitle changes suggested by most reviewers. This time I had veggies cooked, next time I'll make them a little crispy. Overall, this one is OK but not gourmet. Try it if you have little children. They might like it.

Delicious as is! This will be a regular dish at our house. 

Also goes very nicely as a veggie side for a main dish that already contains pasta, e.g. tuna noodle casserole, lasagna, etc.  Simply omit the pasta. Easy and yummy!

Quite delicious. I will add a splash of white wine next time. I left out the garlic salt. I simply sautéed the fresh broccoli with the bell peppers instead of steaming it first. Thank you for the recipe.

Very tasty, and very easy to prepare. I read the reviews, some thought it was boring, so I added mushrooms and shrimp- delicious! I also added some hot pimento paste for a little kick, a little bit more butter so the pasta wouldn't be too dry. Definitely will be making it again!

This recipe was good, I am only giving 3 stars because it was indeed a bit boring, but great for a last minute throw together meal.   I will make it again and maybe I will take my boyfriend's advice of "it needs bacon"

I loved this recipe. I made a few tweaks which made it perfect for me. First I used a mix of olive oil and walnut oil (2 tbsp of each) to saute my onions & garlic. I added the broccoli right to my pan rather than microwaving it first. I used red, orange & yellow peppers & served it over brown rice. It was full of flavor & I will definitely make it regularly. Thank you for sharing it!

Very good, light and healthy.  I didn't have broccoli so  I didn't add it, but I did add diced tomatoes, garlic, mixed green and red pepper strips (only 1/4 cup), a sprinkle of crushed red pepper and 1/4 cup of chopped spinach. This was really good. Served with pork kabobs. Nice and easy meal

This was wonderful. I added lots of crimini mushrooms to the saute.
