This is deliciously indulgent.  The brown sugar and coconut just go so well together. I refrigerated the leftovers and loved it cold. I made another version the next day by cooling the coconut milk mixture and adding it to cold brew coffee. Bingo! Another awesome drink. Thank you Yoly for your recipe.
