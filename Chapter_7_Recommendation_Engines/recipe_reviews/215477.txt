Great flavor! I added walnuts, and some chicken stock..also used fresh sage and thyme instead of poultry seasoning. I loved the olive flavor in it!

Great recipe! I loved the addtion of the mushrooms and olives to a standard stuffing recipe. I did add about a cup of chicken stock to up the moistness of the dressing. I will definitely make this again.

I added a 1/2 cup vegetable stock as some others had suggested, but it was still to dry. It didn't hold together at all. I used a french loaf instead of normal sandwich bread so maybe that made a difference. Overall the taste is really good!!

This is a very good stuffing. Needs very little tweaking for my family. Would make again when something different is wanted. Good job!

Added a little chicken broth when reheating.  It was a huge hit! Everyone loved it and ate every bit on their plates ??
