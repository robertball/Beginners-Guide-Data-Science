My wife and I both loved this recipe.  I made quite a few changes: I used fresh string beans instead of canned.  I also cooked the garlic in with the water and wine, making sure not to lose any when draining.  And I used Havarti instead of cheddar and also skipped the microwave.  I think the Havarti was a nice compliment and made for a more 'delicate' recipe.

These were pretty good. I did make a few changes, such as adding the garlic to the wine and bean mixture. I also added some onion salt to the wine/bean/garlic mixture. Finally, I put the cheese on top of the beans without microwaving. It still melted, and eliminated another dish to wash!!!

Pretty tasty with the wine. I would rather have white cheese on top like moz or feta crumbled over it.

Liked the flavor of the wine but I agree the cheese does not melt well on the green beans. Flavor of the cheese with the green beans was not the greatest either. Agreeing with others maybe I will try it with swiss or Feta next time.

This wasn't a hit at our house. They needed something. I used frozen green beans and maybe that was the problem. The color was unappealing. Won't be trying this again.

Husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  I made it per the recipe the first time.  I'd rate it 3.5 stars as the recipe is written.  Cheddar cheese melts gloppy and doesn't spread nicely at all.  The second time I made it, instead of melting the cheese ahead of time, I just sprinkled the shredded cheese on the hot beans.  The cheese melted nice as you please.  We really like the zing of the uncooked garlic, but others might rather have the milder flavor of having their garlic cooked in with the beans and wine.  

This really is a flavor combination we'd have never imagined would work, yet work it did.  Give it a shot, you might find yourself among the converted.  :)

I used frozen beans and Parmesan cheese.  I can't do can beans, sorry.

Cheese doesn't melt well, and the flavor leaves a lot to be desired.  A definite waste of ingredients.

The cheddar cheese was very clumpy and clashed with the garlic flavor.
