I'm surprised that pomegranate juice made this taste just like grenadine, which is mixed berry. :) Loved it, so easy, and thank you! Our favorite thing to make with grenadine. Shirley Temples.

The real deal! I used fresh pomegranate juice. If you read the ingredients list of grenadine, you will shiver. Use this splendid mix of natural ingredients. Youâ€™ll be happy you did.

This has replaced the standard grenadine at my bar.  We have not had a problem and it saves us money.
