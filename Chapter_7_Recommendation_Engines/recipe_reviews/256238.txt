To make things easy, drop the chicken coating ingredients into a gallon ziplock bag, zip and give it a shake. Drop all of the cubed chicken in and do the same. I don't do paleo but thought this recipe looked interesting and wanted to give it a try. On that note, I did not buy coconut amino but used reduced sodium soy sauce instead. These were different from the traditional hot wing flavor and have an Asian flair to them.  I do think they need more Sriracha and ended up doubling the amount. These would be a big hit for a Superbowl party!

We used boneless skinless chicken thighs and this came out fantastic. I don't think my 12 yr old has eaten this much chicken in one sitting, ever.

Delicious and easy. I used chicken tenders instead of cubes, and then wrapped them in lettuce leaves for a wrap.  GREAT DINNER!! I am going to try them again for Super Bowl Sunday.

I really like this recipe!  I wanted to make it exactly as written but did not have tapioca starch or aminos so I  broke from paleo tradition and used flour and soy sauce.  It turned out fantastic! I put too much hot sauce so had to tame it down a bit with extra butter and brown sugar but will definitely add this to my rotation.

Delicious, it was healthier than we would have normally made fried chicken! It was very flavorful, but we have some spicy-haters in this house so we left out the sriracha sauce for anyone to use on the side!

I had to change things up a bit because I didn’t have all the ingredients. I used red pepper flakes instead of ground red pepper, used corn starch instead of tapioca and used palm shortening and coconut oil. Instead of sriracha, I made a buffalo sauce with honey. These turned out perfect!! Just the right amount of crispiness and they were so juicy!! I set out a plate for the family and it was gone in no time!! I will definitely make it again.

Made this for my family of 5 who all love chicken wings.   The sauce was just too thick and felt the flavor was just ok.  I had higher hopes since honey Sriracha is my favorite flavor of sauce for wings.

Delicious. Didn’t add the hot sauce, but this will be in our Super Bowl Menu list.
