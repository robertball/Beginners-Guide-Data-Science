I've been making a similar version of this for years. Instead of cream of potato, I use one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of celery, 2 cans of mixed vegatables, half cup of milk and a half cup of chicken broth/stock. Cut up or shredded chicken and salt and pepper to taste. Mix together and pour into an 11x13 deep pan. I use biscuit mix to top it. Bake for 20-30 minutes until the biscuits are done and the filling is hot. My husband would eat this everyday if I made it! My kids love it too! Very simple but filling meal.

I had a request for "pot pie like the frozen kind", so this was my result. I used cream of celery soup rather than potato, and I'm certain that improved it (for us). The thyme was not really noticeable; I'd probably increase that next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good and tasty.  I used peas, carrots and potatoes for the veggies.  I made it in a casserole dish verses a pie dish.  You will need more biscuits to top which I had.  Also I used skim milk.  You would be better off using 2% for a thicker consistancy.  Overall it was great though.  Super easy and will make it again!

Knowing that we wanted leftovers, I added to this recipe and cooked it in a 9x13 dish. I boiled just over a pound of chicken breasts, and while that was cooking, I mixed the following: 1 can cream potato, 1 can cream broccoli, 1 can sliced potato (drained), 16 oz frozen veggies, 1 cup milk, 3/4 tsp thyme, 1/2 cup cheddar, 1 cup sour cream, a good dash of onion powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika and a generous amount of fresh ground black pepper. Once the chicken was done I chopped it and added to the rest of the ingredients. Cooked until bubbling and topped with biscuits as stated.
I'd write and post this as its own recipe, but the ones I have posted have never been published, so there it is.

Good Recipe.  The cream of potato soup really worked out well.  We have some lactose intolerant people in my household, so I used 1 cup of skimmed pan drippings from a roasted chicken I made earlier in the week in place of the milk.  It didn't turn out as creamy as the picture looks, but the taste was amazing.  Leftovers were gone very quickly!  Just to make things easier, I prepared all the ingredients needed for the filling in a pan on the stove top until thoroughly heated - about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Then, I added the filling to the casserole dish, added the biscuits, and only cooked for 15 minutes in the oven until the biscuits were done.  It cut down on the oven time which is a benefit in warmer climates and got it to the kitchen table a little faster.

Sort of more like chicken and dumplings, but good and fast on a cold night where you don't want to really spend a lot of time cooking and just want some quick, hot comfort food. Made a few changes due to what I had on hand, used cream of mushroom soup, omitted the thyme, but added lots of onion/garlic powder, black pepper and some seasoning salt. Used a frozen bag of mixed veggies. Will make again.

I made a half recipe since I was only cooking for myself, and I baked it in a 6-inch pie plate. The half recipe didn't quite fit so I had to throw some of the mix away, but that's ok. Cooking the chicken beforehand made this recipe take a long time to prepare and I think the cooking time could be modified so that the chicken can cook in the oven with everything else instead. Also cooking the chicken beforehand made it end up pretty dry. Also the biscuits on top turned out really dry too, but that might be because I used the really cheap store-brand biscuits (they came in a smaller 7 oz pack while all the rest were 10-16 oz). I used some Vermont country seasoning in the mix and I'm not sure exactly what spices are in it but that made it taste really good despite the dry chicken. This is a good basic recipe but next time I'll make some modifications to the preparation.

Loved it! I am in college and it was perfect for me, so quick and easy yet delicious and healthy. I used canned green beans, potatoes, and corn for veggies and also halved the recipe. I definitely recommend it, it would also be easy to play with and add things to make it more unique.

This was delicious and easy.  It could use more salt though, and I'm one who rarely salts food when eating.  So quick to make, too.  Be sure to line bottom of oven with tin foil b/c this dish overspills.

Not bad for another pretty quick and easy recipe.  We used potatoes and onions for the veggies.  I didn't have cream of potato so I used cream of celery instead which turned out pretty good.  The only thing I'd really change about it is the spice ratio.  It definately needs some jazzing up.  Otherwise, most of my family enjoyed this and it was highly satisfying.

The flavor is really good, but my biscuits did not cook all the way. I cooked the biscuits for twice the time needed, still doughy. A better idea would be to just make the biscuits and pour this on top!

Delicious!  I have to admit to changes.  No potato soup on hand, so I used a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of chicken with herbs. For veggies, I used 2 cups of frozen homestyle hash brown potatoes (microwaved for a couple minutes to thaw and cook a bit, and 2 cups of frozen mixed veggies (thawed).  I used jumbo biscuits and had no problem with them cooking through, but it definitely changes the biscuit to filling ratio. Used a 9x13 pan.  Will definitely make again.

Very good easy quick recipe. I will use a smaller can of biscuits next time and cut them in half. I used rising big biscuits and the bottoms were not cooked and kind of slimy. I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp onion powder, doubled the black pepper. I also used low sodium cream of broccoli and low sodium cream of mushroom and it turned out great. Veggies: Fresh broccoli, carrots and frozen peas and corn. Boyfriend loved it too.

This is my first  time reviewing a recipe. This was easy and a great comfort food. I read the reviews about the biscuits being doughy. I raised the oven rack higher than usual. I also buttered the tops of the buns and they browned nicely. I also did not have cream of potato soup, substituted one can cream of celery and one can cream of chicken.Will make this again. Husband loved it

This was a really nice recipe; creamy and delicious!  I love the addition of potatoes that the soup provides.  I used a few extra biscuits to fill in the gaps of my casserole, and unfortunately they soaked up a lot of the gravy.  Next time I will try it in a traditional pie crust.
