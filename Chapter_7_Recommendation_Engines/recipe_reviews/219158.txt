I made this in the crockpot yesterday. Because I'm working with a small food budget, I used stew meat instead of sirloin roast. I used red bell pepper instead of green (personal preferance), beef broth instead of water, and I did not add the full amounts of pepper/salt. I just added them to taste. This was a VERY thick and flavorful chili (that really does seem to improve even more the longer it sits--honest!) and this was quick for me to make and portion out for work lunches. NOTE: The recipe did not specify wether to rinse the beans and tomatoes. I did. Also, the mild chili powder I used was california ground chili powder. It's got all the flavor of chili powder with half the heat.

Very Good Chili, I'm not a Bell Pepper fan and I substitute a Serano, but it was enjoyed by the whole family.

I am embarrassed to say that I did not fully read the directions before staring this chili. After a busy soccer weekend, I started this chili around 5pm Saturday. Our chili cook off was the next day. I cooked the chili for a few hours before placing it on low for 8 hours overnight.  The next day, I unplugged the crockpot and brought it to church.  Long story short, I won the Chili cookoff after 10 years of failed attempts.  The judges loved the taste and how the roast shredded.
