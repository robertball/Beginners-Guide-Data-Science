This was an awesome recipe! The only thing I may do differently next time is to dredge the eggplant in a cornmeal batter, to make it a bit crispy.  The eggplant soaked up the oil in the pan and it was a bit mushy.  However, it was still really good.. the yogurt sauce made it.  I served it with brown rice and a salad.

I wanted to hate this recipe since (A) I didn't read through the recipe first and step four really needed to either be step one or two.  My eggplant got cold waiting on the dressing to sit. (B)  I nearly killed myself trying to fry the first batch of wet eggplant that needed to sit and drain--I know that is common sense but I was making several other dishes, got carried away, and was just going by what I read.  I threw the rest in the oven and really couldn't tell the difference between the fried and the roasted.  Despite all of that, my anti-eggplant hubby ate this.  My kids still refused but I still rate this a four just because I wasn't the only one enjoying eggplant this time.  The directions are not very clear but the end result is good.
