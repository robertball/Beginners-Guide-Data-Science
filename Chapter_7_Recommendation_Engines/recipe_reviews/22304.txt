These are AWESOME and extraordinarily versatile. Here's and assortment of tips. TORTILLAS: Sprayed muffin tins with pam. Like another reviewer, I didn't bother taking the time to cut out circles and instead cut the tortillas into 4 triangles to avoid having scrap leftovers. This works perfectly because you can pull them out easily by the hangover corners when they're done, which are left golden and crispy, and it adds texture. If you have trouble getting them to sit right in the tin without popping out, hold them over steaming water for a minute or two allows them to get stretchy and they'll sit fine. (They dry back out in the oven anyway). With one of the batches, I baked the tortillas for 5 minutes, added filling, and then baked again, but I only it found it wasted more time to bake-fill-bake rather than fill-and-bake. There wasn't much difference, both ways were delicious! As for the FILLING: do anything! I've made vegetarian types with refried or whole black beans. I've also used ground taco-flavored beef, using a heaping teaspoon per serving. Topped it with salsa or simply veggies. Olives, onions, tomatoes, bell peppers, celery, jalapenos, corn, salsa: any combination that's available is great. anything that needs to be used I have left over in the fridge- works for me! Often heap some sour cream in there to be baked with it if the filling is very spicy. Use shredded CHEESE sparingly! The more shredded cheese you use on top, the soggier they get. Otherwise Excellent!!

I recently served this dish for a pool party and everyone raved! I used a measuring cup (1 cup) to make the little circles then used regualar scissors (only used for in the kitchen) to cut out the circles and it worked great. I really stuffed the circles into the muffin circles and it worked pretty well.  I'm making this recipe tonight again for a girls-only get together! Good luck!

Very tasty!!  First, we tried the filling without adding the cheese into the mixture, and only on top, but that didn't work well.  The cheese is needed in the mix to bind everything together while baking.  The frustrating part was how to cut the tortillas so they will fit perfectly into the cupcake pan.  I finally just cut them into triangles, and that worked OK.  The first batch, I added the salsa into the mix, but that made it too watery;  so in the second batch, I only added some tobasco sauce to make it a bit spicy, then served the salsa on the side.  And everyone liked that better.  Easy to make, and even with greasing the pan, some of the tortilla cups still stuck to the pan because of the melted cheese, but this is minor compared to the taste.  Will probably make again, and we liked how you can change the filling (more black beans, more veggies, and less cheese), and still it tasted good.

Had these for our superbowl party, they were a big hit.  I used the small muffin trays and made the tortillas smaller.  I took all of the ingredents and combined them together in a bowl and let them set in the refrig overnight, that way when we were ready the next day I just spooned the whole mixture into the tortilla cups and threw them in the oven. Great time saver.

OMG- found this recipe yesterday and made it last night for a party today.  thanks to everyone for all the tips!  Combined tips that helped: use a cup or cookie cutter to cut out mini muffin size circles, warm circles in microwave to make them more pliable, mix all ingrediants into a bowl and spoon into cups.  I did find that I only had to spray the tin once and they fell out fine from then on.  Also, they reheated fine in the oven this morning.  I put these out at 8am, it is now 9am and there are 3 left!  Not one person has said they don't like them!  They are ridiculously good and oh-so-easy to make.  Kudos to they're creator!  Any weightwatchers members out there- the ingrediants that I used were 2 for 1pt, 4 for 2pts, and 6 for 3pts.  And they are SO worth the 3 points!  LOL

I was a little bit suspicious when I started making these but they are incredible -- they made my main course seem very bland.  The recipe doesn't tell you to let them cool when they are out of the oven, but you should add 10 minutes to the cooling so that they stick together when you pull them out (pulling out with a butter knife worked well for me).

These will definitely be on my buffet table during my Christmas open house! For ease in making, I used wonton wrappers and spring rolls wrappers. Great presentation and wonderful flavor!

These are good and easy to make.  Warm the tortillas about 10 seconds in the microwave to soften them and cut out the circles with a round cookie or biscuit cutter.  You will still have to fold one side a little to fit it in the mini muffin tins.  I just added a few of the ingredients, what I had on hand.  Don't add too much salsa or they will be soggy and leak.

Very good recipe.  I followed the suggestions of others and heated the tortillas first.  I then used a glass that was slightly larger than the muffin tin and used is at a guide to cut the tortillas to size.  I layered my cheese then refried beans, seasoned beef, red pepper, tomato and olive.  By making the tortillas slightly larger, they formed cups that held the fillings in.

These were great! I cut the tortillas into 4" circles, which made it so they went up the sides of the muffin cups to make a tartlet shell. I baked the tortillas first to make them crunchy. Then I added the filling. To the filling recipe, I added a couple of links of cooked, chopped Chorizo sausage - delish! I also drained the salsa before adding it, and I had no problems with the filling being soggy. The melted cheese is what holds everything together. I added some extra black beans and omitted the chili powder, as the chorizo gave it an extra kick. These got rave reviews from my guests & I will definitely make them again!

Loved this!  I spooned the mixture into Tostitos Scoops instead of cutting the tortillas into circles to save time.  They were wonderful!

Great recipe! Made some for a potluck and got rave reviews for it. I nuked the tortilla rounds for ten seconds in the microwave as suggested by others. I couldn't place the tortilla rounds  into the muffin tray with my hand so I used an empty Smuckers jelly bottle. Just remove the top of the bottle, invert it and push the tortilla round with it into the muffin tray.

Perfect! I've also used different types of tortilla-- the flavored wraps (green, red, wheat) with excellent results. They freeze beautifully and reheat well, so these are perfect to make up ahead of time for the holidays or for parties. Served with Mexican sour cream (crema) and fresh salsa as toppings... and fresh chopped cilantro on the side, yum!

This appetizer was easy to make and delicious! My only problem was that the tortillas weren't very pliable and didn't fit into the cups very well. Also, how should I cut them out into circles? Please help, because I really want to make this recipe again and again... Thanks! :)

I have been making these for over a year in many different ways and I finally came across a "keeper"!  I mix in a can of Mexicorn (corn, green peppers, and red peppers) in with the black beans.  I mix the beans and the corn together and microwave for about a minute - 5 minutes in the oven didn't get the beans warm enough.  I skip on the salsa and just add tomatoes on top of the bean/corn mix.  I use a taco blend cheese and then sprinkle the chili powder on top.  I have never LOVED anything more to eat in my life - seriously!!

These were fabulous!  A little time consuming to make, but great!  I followed someone elses suggestion - make the circles by using a 1 cup measuring scoop - the tortilla's fit great!  I also left out the tomatoes since there was already salsa.  Everyone at my party loved them and thought they were so cute!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is wonderful! I used the mini muffin cups (as someone else mentioned) and thought they were the perfect size. I also put the tortillas in the microwave for 10 seconds prior to cutting them in circles so that they would be more flexible and easier to fit in the muffin cups.

This recipe was so easy to make and I was able to assemble and refrigerate them ahead of time. I put them in the oven right after the first guests arrived and they were ready in 5 minutes.

These were popular at the party I took them to but they were complicated to make. I made them in mini muffin pans because I thought they would be too big if made in regular muffin pans. After I cut the tortillas into the appropriate sized circles, I microwaved them to soften them. Then I brushed them with a little oil and used my Pampered Chef Mini Tart Shaper to stuff them into the pans. Without that tool it seems like it would be difficult to get them to stay in the pans. After reading other reviews I decided to omit the tomatoes and salsa altogether (so they wouldn't be watery) and added some taco sauce instead. I mixed all the ingredients together in a bowl first. That seemed easier than putting each ingredient into the shells one at a time. If I make these again I would like to experiment with adding other ingredients.

What a wonderful and versatile appetizer.  When making these make sure that your mixture is fairly dry or the appetizer will drip all over you when you bite into it.  I took a round glass that was slightly over 3.5 inches and used it to cut out my tortillas.  I placed the tortilla on a cutting board and used a paring knife to trace around the glass.  I only got 4 pieces to each tortilla but it made a good 3-bite appetizer and was very easy to place into a standard size muffin pan.  I’m looking forward to experimenting with different combinations.  This appetizer impressed my friends.

kind of messy to make and they really don't reheat very well. But, my husband loved them!  I had some trouble fitting the wraps into the muffin tins.  I would not suggest making ahead to bring to somebody else's house, but, fresh from the oven they are really good.

Awesome - so open to versatility.  Next time I will drain my salsa...had the same problem as others with the salsa making the tortillas too wet.  Was so delish though!!!

These were delicious. I made them for a Christmas Party and they were a huge hit. I omitted the salsa. Just mixed together veggies, topped with cheese and baked. Just before serving I topped each one with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce (found in appetizer section - a must try).  Easy and very impressive. Try them at your next party. This is guaranteed not to be a repeat (everyone always shows up at parties with meatballs, spinach dip and little smokies).

These were fantastic!  I used a biscuit cutter to shape the tortillas and about two dashes of Tobasco in place of the salsa - perfection!  A little preparation the night before (cutting the tortillas, chopping the veggies, etc.) made for quick assembly and baking.  I was able to mingle with my guests and still serve food which impressed them...the goal of every hostess!

Delicious!! I took a chance and made these for a party and they were a hit. I loved the taste- just the right amount of spice. I mixed all the ingredients in a large glass bowl the night before the party. I omitted the tomatoes because I don't like them, and I nearly doubled the amount of beans, which was a good thing.  I just cut the tortillas and filled & baked them the day of the party.  Very easy!  I should have made more- they went fast and I myself could have eaten 5!  I will make these again!

Oh my gosh these were excellent! I made the mini's too. I cut them into small circle and then nuked them for about 8 seconds and they were very pliable to put in the cups. I was making these as an adult appetizer for super bowl but the kids (most of who are fairly picky) LOVED them. I too used mild sauce, and I almost doubled the beans. Really delicious. These will be in my party list for a long time.

This was so good.  I made these for a dinner party and someone asked me where I bought them.  I laughed and told him I made it.  I used the mini muffin pans and they were perfect.

I did mini versions, found they were easier to eat. Used mini muffin pan. I also used the Southwest cheese blend, it gave it more bite, if you like it like that. Or the Mexican cheese blend, for milder tastes. Made this for several parties lately and everyone loved them!

I added taco seasoning, and cooked chicken. Like the other reviewers, I quartered the flour torillas instead of cutting out circles. They were pretty big to use as a finger appetizer so next time I'll use mini muffin tins, and cut smaller pieces of tortilla.

Just thinking about these tasty little appetizers makes my mouth water!  

Simple and oh so delicious.  I used a can of black beans (rined and well drained) and when I ran out of black beans I used my homemade pinto beans - which were good but I prefer the texture of the black beans for this appetizer.  I used a regular sized cupcake pan and cut the tortilla circles slightly larger than the cupcake wells.  I filled the pan with the tortillas and prebaked them for about 6 minutes to help them crispen them a bit before filling them.  When filling the shells I put one teaspoon plain black beans (as is, no seasonings), a teaspoon homemade salsa fresca (aka pico de gallo), and topped it with chedder/monterey jack cheese... baked an additional 7-8 minutes.  You can't get any more simple - and my family was so impressed they thought I got the idea from a restaurant.  HA!

Excellent!  I used egg roll wrappers instead of flour tortillas, left out bell pepper and added 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt just because I seem to have to have garlic in most everything.  Thanks for the recipe!  Will make often because my young man and old man insist!

I made these a while ago for a party exactly as recipe was written and they were a huge success. My husband and son had a multitude of ideas for different fillings for the next time. We tried using chopped chicken, pepperoni, ground beef cooked with taco seasoning and the possibities are endless. Really an adaptable little appetizer recipe. Great!

I made these for a New Years Eve party and they were a big hit.  I did a few things a little different.  I cut burrito size tortilas in quarters then fit them in the muffin pan.  Also I took all the ingredents excepts the cheese and mixed them together and put the mixture in and top with cheese.

I have made these a few times for parties & they always get eaten up.  I add or subtract things that I don't have on hand.  I mix all the ingredients together except the cheese, & just sprinkle it on top.

I love how versatile this is!  The combination of ingredients stated in the recipe is delicious, but if you don't have everything on hand you can easily substitute things.  The first time I tried it out I followed the recipe, but second time I didn't have black beans so I used refried beans and they came out beautifully. I mix the cheese right in rather than sprinkling it on top and I increase the chili powder b/c I like it hot.  Thanks for the recipe, this one's a keeper!

This is so easy and so delicious! I used fillo shells (pre-baked) and stuffed them with the beans, chili powder, green onion, rotel instead of tomato, all the cheeses, salsa and served with sour cream and guacamole. I made 50 of these for a party and they were gone in a flash! Several people asked for the recipe and my family requests it all the time. You can vary these to your taste. Super easy to make and a crowd pleaser!! Thanks!

I really liked the idea of these in the muffin tins, as I'm a huge fan of individual nachos vs. piles of chips. I used Chipotle Refried Beans, but wouldn't do that again. Just made up the rest: Mexican Blend Cheese, green onions, tomatoes, then garnish with sour cream, avacado, and salsa once out of oven. Putting the tortilla in the muffin tin can be a little tricky, especially if you are using very authentic corn tortillas (they are kind of springy and don't want to stay in the cup). I really liked the idea of crisping them a bit before loading them up, as one reviewer suggested, but I wasn't able to do that because I couldn't weight down the rounds into the tin. I also took another reviewers advice to use a coffee mug as a cutting guide. It worked really easily -- although next time I'll opt for a bigger mug. My tortillas went right up to the edge of the muffin cups, but would be nice to have a little overhang that would get really crisp. I baked up the scraps of tortillas with some cooking spray and sea salt -- about 10 minutes on 350 -- to have some additional chips on the side. Not pretty, but tasty and avoids waste. Pictures don't really do this justice. If you and your guests like Mexican food, these will make you drool just looking at them. Will try again soon with other combinations. Easy to scale the recipe up or down to fulfill a craving. Might also try some tostada-like antojitos in my muffin-topper pans. More of an entree, but might also be tasty.

These were very good.  However, they get cold fast so I don't think I'd serve them again as an addition to other appetizers. Maybe on their own though.

The most difficult thing with this recipe was grating the cheese... I only was able to steal one of these nuggets before the folks at the party scarfed them all down midst asking for the recipe. A real keeper! Highly recommend.
The extra cooling time in the pan that others have suggested is a very good hint!

These were wonderful! I accidentally purchased white corn tortillas, so they weren't as pliable as flour tortillas. The melted cheese helped to hold them together. The corn tortillas actually added a very good flavor to these appetizers. I look forward to making these again!

This was a spicy and beautiful little appetizer.
I made this recipe with puff pastry shells.  The crowd enjoyed them warm from the oven.  This was  easy, but looked complicated and time comsuming.

These were a big hit at the Super Bowl party.  I had made some earlier with the hot sauce and it was too hot.  You could not eat them.  I made these with medium salsa and it was great.  I also added more beans and green onions than the receipe called for.  These went really fast because they are so yummy and a change from the same old appetizers. Will make again.

These were great.  A little messy to make but use the beans to weight down the tortillas!  With a side of sour cream these were a huge hit as an addition to taco night.

Very good!  I recommend that you prebake your tortillas (in the muffin pan) atleast 4-5 min. prior to adding fillings.  Will give them a crunchier chip.

This was a very pretty presentation.  I changed it according to what I had on hand and what I like.  I used 1 cup of frozen corn, 1 can drained black beans, 1 drained can of rotel ( in place of tomatoes), green onion, cheeses, garlic, salsa.  It was really good.  I will definitely make this again.

This is one of the best recipes I've found on this site. I've made it for a small gathering as well as Thanksgiving appies and they were a hit. A nice little addition is to put a small dollop of your favorite tomato sauce or paste in first then your ingredients on top, as it keeps it nice and moist inside and adds a bit of a kick. Can't wait to make them again this weekend. Thanks for the recipe Sara!

These were very easy to make, and tasted very good. My 2 girls even thought they were good! We ate these with salsa for dipping, but my daughter thinks it would also be good with salad fixings on the side for a mini taco salad... yum!

These "taste" good, but of course, anything with cheese will taste good.  I made these, and because of the tomato and salsa, they were a runny mess.  Too much of a sloppy mess.  Not a good finger food, because the base was too thin and soggy, because of all the goodies heaped on it.  Like I said, they tasted fine, but were too small/soggy/drippy to do it again.

Cutting the tortillas was a little too much, so I decided to just roll tortillas up with the contents filled inside and then stick a toothpick in them. It worked pretty nicely. I cut the big tortillas in half after I rolled them. Also speading a thin layer of cream cheese on the inside of the tortilla before you stuff them, helps things "stick" together.

These are lots of fun and very easy to make.  To cut the tortillas, I preferred using a little, pyrex condiment cup that I have which was somewhat wider than my 1-cup measurement (and the 1-cup measurement cup actually worked just fine).  Anyway, I used a steak knife to cut around the pyrex.  Easy as pie.  

Brought these to a party and it got good reviews.  The recipe itself is a little bland for my taste, but what's so great about this little appetizer is that you can make it with whatever you have on hand, as long as it's not too soupy.

Make these!  You'll be glad you did.

These were a big hit. I used vegetarian refried beans and no tomatoes.  They were gone in seconds. Thanks for the recipe.

I took this appetizer to a party and got many compliments.  I didn't think that it was too hard to prepare.  I used some of the suggestions in the other reviews and the appetizer turned out great.  I left out the tomatoes and warmed the tortillas slightly in the microwave to make them easier to get into the mini muffin tins that I used.

I made an assortment of various appetizers for my lingerie/candle party. This dish was emptied first and guests raved about them (also warned me that I would be asked to prepare this one for any upcoming events). Messy, but excellent and different from the "same old, same old".

These are great and easy. I use mini muffin tins and cut small circles of tortilla so it fits and spray the tin with Pam so they don't stick. I also mix all the ingredients together, usually black beans, salsa, peppers, onions and cheese- it's much easier to then put in the tortillas. Bake about 10 minutes until the tortillas crisp up enough to just pull out. Nice bite size snack. Always asked to bring to parties.

So easy, so versatile! I especially love the tip about pressing the warmed tortilla pieces (I opted for the quartered presentation- they are much easier to remove than the circles) into the muffin cups with a juice glass. I've got long finger nails and made holes in several of them until got out a glass...worked like a charm from then on. I opted to pre-bake the tortilla pieces to ensure a more crispy finish. I also add just about any type of meat/poultry - browned ground, leftover/canned shredded/etc., as my guys really like a more substantial nibble. I do add taco seasoning now as we all like it that way and offer our normal taco toppings for those who desire it. When they are finished baking, I remove them to a cake cooling rack for several minutes so the bottoms don't get soggy.

I made these a long time ago and forgot to review them. The idea is good; but it wasn't extremely memorable. The tortillas are hard to do right (read: crispy rather than soft).

I made this once for a party, and my friends ask me to bring it every single time we have a get together now!  I added taco seasoned beef to half, and chicken to the rest.  I put out containers of salsa, guacamole, and sour cream to top.  It's to die for!

These were excellent.  I servered them to my family for dinner and they were such a hit!  Some of the kids like soft tacos, some of them like crunchy and they met both qualifications.  I sprayed the muffin tins with non-stick spray, warmed the tortillas for 10 seconds in the microwave, and used a juice glass to push them down into the muffin tins.  I browned up 2lbs of chuck with taco seasonings and spooned some of it into each tortilla cup.  For the kids I only sprinkled on some bagged, pre-shredded mexican blend cheese, but for the grown-ups I spooned on some black beans, chopped green onions and salsa.  They looked great on the table, very special without a lot of fuss.  What a great idea.

this recipe is excellent. I also changed it around a bit while having some fun with it when cutting out the pieces with a biscut cutter and stuffing them into a mini cupcake holeder for baking and adding the salsa and chicken, cheese refried beans some with bacon I mean I got creative I had fun. They were delicious the original way and very excellent the creative way. I couldn't keep the tray full. The guest was looking for more...

These were excellent.  You can vary the ingredients depending on your tastes.  I tried them both in the mini muffin adn regular muffin tins. I liked the larger ones better because you can get more filling inside each one.  I liked the suggestion to misx all of the ingredients except the cheese beofre filling the tortillas.

these were great, I'll really happy to that they are vegitarian too.  I mixed all the filling together and scooped it into the cups.  Next time I will use 1/2 the cheese.  I used the small corn tortillas and they were the perfect size.  Next time I'll add 1/2 the cheese to the mixture and leave the other 1/2 for on top (I might also try using a tex-mex cheese).  I used a whole can of black beans and instead of chili powder used about 1 TBSP of taco seasoning.  Next time I'm going to add about 1 1/2 cups of cooked rice at my hubbys request.  I might also add more vegggies.  But this recipe is great on its on but will be awsome with these changes.

I made these tonight for dinner as opposed to an appetizer.  I added taco meat and mixed all ingredients together before filling.  Served with sliced avocado.  Pretty tasty....they disappeared quickly and it was a good way to use up some leftover tortillas.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, sal.

These were good enough that my husband suggested we make them for a party. I cut mine into triangles and added beef with taco seasining and chili powder mixed in. I also added chopped tomatoes and green onion and cheese and then we dipped them in sour cream and taco sauce. Changes for next time would be to add some green chilies and more seasoning to the beef. It didn't have enough kick. Someone mentioend hot sauce so I may try that.

I loved this recipe, my husband thought it was ok. However I made a few changes, but it seems it was the browning of the tortillas and the lack of a lot of cheese that was the problem. I used The Monterey jack,as my first layer, then added refried beans,taco meat,onions,some chopped olives and a little more cheddar cheese on top. For my husbands it was the same excepted there were no olives,but jalapeños instead and some Tabasco sauce. Also on top once cooked I added some sour cream and fresh avocados. I would also suggest to cut the tortillas in triangles as they make perfect cups. I would have these again, maybe try a little more cheese or even Mexican cheese for extra taste.

These were so good, and the funny thing is everyone thought they were potato skins.  Excellent appetizer and so great because you you fill them with whatever suits your preference.  I definitely think you need to make a lot of them for a party, because they go fast!

Very good, they turned out nicely. My husband and 7 yr old like them a lot. Cutting the tortillas into quarter triangles works best; it's easier and isn't wasteful. I didn't think to just mix up all the filling ingredients into a bowl like others said they did. That would save a lot more time.

I used mini-muffin tins and added some Mexican spiced chicken. They were practically inhaled off the plate. If you warm the tortillas in saran after cutting them out with a bisquit cutter and use Pam on the tins, you can put anything in the "crust" that you like.  I agree with another reviewer that the Pampered Chef tool for making mini muffins works great.

These are great!  I make very small circles out of the tortillas and put them in a mini muffin pan.  (Sprinkle with a little water and heat for a few seconds in the microwave to make them more pliable.) Any combination of ingredients works great in these "tarts".  I add refried beans, chopped jalapenos and loads of cheese.  Enjoy!!!

I thought these would turn out like mini-tostadas, but they were not like them at all. The tortillas stay pretty soft even adding beans and chili powder, I thought the taste was pretty bland.

I have to admit that I was a little skeptical of this recipe at first.  It just seemed so simple and I thought there was no way they could be as good as everyone said.  Boy was I wrong!!!  They were wonderful!  Every batch was gone immediately and I kid you not, everyone said it was their favorite appetizer ever.  I did add a little bean dip on the bottom, then I added the mixture, topped that w/ a little diced tomato and them a little more cheese.  I also made Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce to go w/ them and they went together perfectly!!

This is an amazing recipe!  I had a "mexican night" dinner party and they were gone in a flash...I took advise of others and went really light on the salsa.  I also added corn to make it more colorful.  These would also make great veggie burritos.  I put salsa and sour cream on the side.  YUM!

I made these for a "mexican-themed" party and they were a huge hit!  We just used a pizza cutter to cut each tortilla into 6 triangles, steamed them in the microwave for a minute to soften them up and then put them into a mini-muffin pan - made great looking bite-sized appies.

These were good, a little time consuming, but made good appetizers.  The only issue I had was I cut the tortilla circles out early in the day & by the time I got around to putting these together, some of them were dried out.  So, if you cut in advance, then store in a plastic bag!

This recipe is amazing!  I used some chopped cooked chicken and salsa in mine.  I made these for Superbowl Sunday and my husband loved them!  In the future I might bake the tortillas in the muffin tins for a couple minutes before filling them, to make them more crispy...but what a great idea!

These are quite tasty!!  However, they do not come out of the muffin tin too easily.  They started to get soggy and they beans and tomatoes were falling off.  You have to let them sit a bit longer to harden but even still.  While they are a little messy, they definitely are tasty.

We had a large appetizer buffet for the 4th and these little ones went fast.  They were soooo good and really easy to assemble.  The hardest part was making the little tortilla rounds.  You could definitely do a lot of different things with this reicpe.  Thanks a bunch for sharing Sara.

I think this is such a great idea! I tried it last night with my husband and he thought they tasted great. I used corn tortillas and I added a can of diced green chilies. Thanks for this great mexican appetizer. I will make these again.

Lots of real tasty food at the Super Bowl Party but these little nuggets commanded attention.  Very tasty by themselves, for the more adventureous, serve with hot sauce on the side.  Only change was omitting the tomatoes.  I will make these again, and numerous guests requested recipe.

What a great and quick recipe this was! My mom,my brother and sister demanded that I send them the recipe right away! You could make a meal of these.
I had no trouble with sticking. Maybe because I left them in the oven a little longer. DELICIOUS!

This recipe was fast and easy.  I just spread a little butter in the muffin cups and the minis did not stick at all.  Great as an appetizer but also works wonderfully as a fun and fast dinner on a work/school night.

super easy to make and very tastey! As other reviews i take and cut a soft taco  shell into four and use in  the muffin pan.  I just throw whatever have into them they always come out wonderfully. Great use of left over taco meat, and i love corn and diced jalopeanos. top with guac.

Very versitle recipe that can be changed to suit your own tastes.  I cut taco shells into quarters and sprayed them with PAM.  Pressed them into a mini muffin tin and topped with chopped chicken, cheese, pico de gaillo, etc.  Delicious!

Also added some fresh sliced jalapeno to the tops for the adults

These were great.  I added some fresh jalapeño slices to the cups for grown ups.  I used flour tortillas (soft taco size) torn into quarters and put 1 in each muffin cup.  There was about a half inch of each corner popping over the top, making a perfect edge to grab and lift them out of the tins with.  Crunchy, cheesy, and yummy.  Best of all, my 3 and 6 year old did almost all the work and were extremely proud of the meal they had made.  We'll definitely be serving these again.

I baked the shells first for a little more crunch. I filled them with cheese and a combination of taco meat, salsa and chilis, then topped again with cheese. I put sour cream on the table to add when served.

This recipe was delicious and very easy and quick to make!! We have made it for a normal weekday dinner and a get together with family.  We kept the recipe with just a few changes.  Instead of black beans, we used black soy beans (more protein), and no chopped tomato.  Instead, we served them with salsa and sour cream so the shells stayed crispy.  I would only make them in the big muffin cups from now on.  The 1st time I made them I used the mini cups and the tortillas had a hard time shaping up and it was very time consuming to do.  The big muffin cups turn out better looking and are easier to make.  Compliments from all around!

These were excellent.  Better than I thought they would be.  I cut all my veggies the day before and assembled them the next day only a few minutes before serving.  I left out the salsa and served it on the side.  I added olives on the top for some added color.  Make sure to microwave the shells before putting them in the muffin tin or they can crack.

I made these but instead of using tortillas I used wonton wrappers. I baked the wonton wrappers for 8-10 minutes at 350 degrees before putting the filling in to brown them a little. I then put a spoon full or two of the tomato, pepper, onion, bean, chili powder mixture in each shell and sprinkled them with cheese and salsa. Then I put them back in the oven for another 8-10 minutes. Because the wanton wrappers get crispy when they cook they create a little cup to hold everything.

This recipe is great.  I omited the tomato and used mini muffin tin so I would have more to go around.  I sprayed the pan with a lot of canola oil and had no problem with sticking.  Thank you so much for sharing.

Amazing! Recently made for a party and got rave reviews! I held off on the salsa (so it wouldn't be soggy) and put it on the side. I also used orange peppers (because I like them better), and I added ground beef that I cooked and seasoned and kidney beans. Came out great! Make sure to microwave the tortillas so they mold to the muffin pan. Will make again and again!!

Everyone loved these!  I cooked the tortillas first in the muffin pan for about four minutes with no filling.  This made them crunchy.  I then added the fillings and cooked them until bubbly.  I also left out some of the "wetter" ingredients.  I then served them with salsa and sour cream on the side.

Make sure that you warm tortillas in microwave for a few seconds prior to shaping into cups, then they will not tear.  I added some sausage to mine, really worked well.  Topped with guacamole and/or sour cream.

You have to try these !!.. do warm the tortillas before cutting, I used a mex. mix of cheese.. small diced can of green chillies.. not to much sauce or they will be loose. did not bother to layer.....super good with a salad and a bowl of chili !!

I love this recipe!  The little tortilla "cups" make an easily handled appetizer.  My only suggestion is to add a little crumbled cooked sausage to the layered mix.  Excellent!

Want to be a hero at your next party?  Mix up a batch of these.  I made these using 1/2 a red pepper and 2/3 cup black beans.  I mixed everything except the cheese ahead and then added taco cheese right before filling the tortilla cups.  Yum!  Maximum raves for minimum effort.

This antojitos recipe was a hit at a recent poolside get together with friends. One caution is to be careful not to break the soft tortilla shells when placing them in the muffin tins. Simply Scrump-deli-i-cious!

This was an excellent appetizer! It was SIMPLE to prepare and tasted very good! I made them in the muffin pan, but unlike some of the previous reviews I didn't have any problem getting them out of the pan. Make sure you spray the pan with vegetable oil! I made this to accompany Chicken Tortilla Soup - it was excellent!!

These were delicious!  Our company loved them.  I made in a mini-muffin pan, getting 18 out of the recipe.  I used a 3/4 cup measuring cup for my tortilla outline, and they were perfectly sized for the mini-muffin pan.

Normally I don't rate recipes I amend but this is such a great recipe. Would be great for home but is perfect for parties. I Spiced it up with hot sauce and didn't use any salsa. I also quartered my tortillas and prebaked for 5 minutes. These flew off the table at the party I brought them to. Lots of compliments. I like how little cheese is needed so the filling is lighter.

Since I am not a fan of beans, I chose to try the suggestion of using ground beef.  So I cooked the ground beef just like I would to make tacos, adding store bought taco seasoning, I also fried up some chopped onions and green pepper with the meat.  Then as said below, I mixed in some sour cream with the ground beef and reamining ingredients.  I topped it all off after baking it, with lettuce and saour cream.  I tried the won ton wrappers, but I prefered the tortillas cut in triangles.  After spraying the pan, I had no problem getting them out.  So basically I made mini tacos.   Everyone asked for the recipe at the end of the night.

The taste was there on this recipe but the tortillas were soggy. I think the next time I try this I would cook the tortillas first then add in the other ingredients.

Great recipe! To cut the tortillas, I used the inside of a canning lid. There are so many great variations to this recipe. I made some with a colby and monterey mix,tomatoes, black beans, Ortega taco sauce,a little chili powder on the 1st layer of cheese and topped it with chopped olives. Tasted like mini mexican pizzas. Thanks!

I used many of the other reviewers suggestions and just cut my tortillas into quarters - added a little pam to the bottom of the muffin cups and then added my filling (used drained black beans and a can of petite diced tomatoes with chili, then added some green onion).  Put some cheese on top and stuck them in the over at 350 for 15-20 minutes.  The extra edges of the tortillas made them easy to take out and made a good presentation.  I just served them with a cilantro dip - everyone loved them.  I think I will try making these next time with 6 in. tortillas cut in fourths and placed in my mini muffin pan to feed a larger crowd.  A great recipe to use up whatever you have left in the kitchen!

These were just so adorable! They taste yummy, are soo easy to make, and don't take much time at all. I took the advice of other reviewers and simply cut the tortilla in fourths, they still looked just as appealing as the round tortilla bases because they all really look the same from being scrunched into a round cupcake holder, and it was a lot faster and less wasteful that way. They were a hit at a friends party I went to. I wasn't sure what to call them, so I kept telling everyone that they were spanish cupcakes. My boyfriend ate several of these which I took as a sure sign of approval. I served them with sourcream, but I'm sure salsa would also be good.

The only change I made was to use multigrain tortillas instead of flour.  I don't know if this was not a good choice, but I did not enjoy these.  Maybe I will try again sometime with flour tortillas and see if I liked them better.

These were SO easy to make and delicious! I made them for a Mom's Group potluck lunch. The ladies all LOVED them. They thought I was a fabulous cook and said they looked so fancy! lol
Thanks to some other reviews I also cut the tortillas into triangles.(hence the 'fancy' comments) I used leftover taco fixings: seasoned beef, red onions, red pepper, jalapino peppers, salsa, cheddar and mozza cheese on multi grain shells! 
I will be making these a lot!

WOW! I gave this recipe 5 stars for both flavor and versatility. I just made these for lunch today (trying to use up some leftover steak, red peppers, beans...) for myself and my 3 year old, and she said 'MmmMmmMmm' the whole time we were eating them (so did I, actually ;-). These would be perfect to make WITH your little one, and she will be happily helping me next time. I have metal measuring cups - used the 1c,turned upside down, pressed really hard on the warmed tortillas, and popped out the circles (I used 2 tortillas for the two of us). Next time, I will simply prep the ingredients ahead of time to make it easier and let her help me stuff them. After they were cooked, I let them sit for about 5 mins to cool, covered with sour cream, salsa - YUM! I did not precook the cups before filling them (some others suggested to do so), and they were not soggy at all. Really, really perfect for the little hands to pick up and eat. These would be great appetizers, and my family is sure to see them at get-togethers, but I will make them more often as a little meal for my daughter! I can't say 'Yum' enough - thanks for the great post and great idea!

I've now made this recipe three times and it gets better every time!  I've given up on the hassle of the flour tortillas.  I couldn't get them to stay in the muffin tins and they were soggy even when I put them in the oven for a few minutes, so I'm now using the premade filo shells, which cuts preparation time significantly.  They are light, flaky and crispy and make for a small appetizer that you can easily pop in your mouth.  I also used chorizo sausage per an earlier suggestion.  It really is a must to spice up the recipe a bit.  Finally, I top each one with a little sour cream.  They are a huge hit with my famiily -- even my picky 11-year-old.

These are really good.  I used a coffee cup to guide me as I cut the flour tortillas and this worked perfectly.  I baked the tortilla shells for a few minutes prior to filling them with the mixture.  I simplified them by adding only black beans, cheese, and chopped jalapenos to the tortillas as they baked.  After they came out, hubby and I added guacamole, sour cream, and salsa to our liking.  Hubby loved them and has asked for them several times since I first made them.

I didn't really know what to expect when I made these, but they are just great! I used organic black beans from Trader Joes--they are pretty low on sodium for being canned. 
A keeper!

These are one of the best items I have ever made.  They flew of the platter.  The fajita shells taste like pastry shells when baked.  I did not use onions and served with salsa and sour cream on the side.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!

I changed the ingredients a bit. I didn't put the salsa or chili pepper(too hot) But I have made them now 3 times and they were all the rage! People have been calling asking how to make them. Very yummy!

I served these last night for my bunco group.  I followed the advice of others, and omitted the salsa, serving it on the side.  I used the BIG muffin tins and microwaved the tortillas for 10 seconds first. Everyone loved them, though I could tell they wondered whether to use a fork to cut it up, or use their fingers.  Regardless, they were easy & delicious.

We have made these appetizers a few times now and they are a HUGE hit.  We all love them.  One thing I did was add some refried beans as the first layer, which worked great.  A little effort, but definitely worth it!!  Actually, I lost my copy of the recipe so I am leaving feedback because I needed to find it to take on vacation!!  Thanks Sara!

These are really good but to save work and time, instead of tortillas, I used wonton wrappers.  Quick, easy and they fit into the muffin tins.  No fuss no muss.  You can use any filling.

These were just ok. Did not hold long enough to use as party food. Could be better if the tortillas were fried using a couple of graduated strainers as molds.

I made these as a snack for my son. Since he is SO picky I only added a can of shredded chicken (I seasoned it with fajita seasoning), salsa, and monterey/colby shredded cheese (in that order). I used a cookie cutter for the circles, and although I would have prefered the circles to be larger in diameter, they did work for the limited amount of fillings I used today (see my picture). For entertaining a crowd, I would suggest mini muffin pans. They came out of the pan easily and kept their shape. Baking the tortillas in the pan for a few minutes before adding the fillings helped a lot. I can't wait to try them with different fillings.

Very simple and very good.  I am making it again tonight, and will try to get a picture or two to post.

Extremely easy to make and adaptable.  I used zuccinni instead of onion and added jalepeno pepper and cilantro to mine.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe for a Mexican themed party I threw last year. I personally didn't care for it but there wasn't any left when the party was over.

This recipe was a big hit at last year's Cinco de Mayo party.  You can put any of your favorite combinations in the cups and as long as you have something to bind them together a bit you are in good shape.  I am purchasing four (4) more muffin trays before next month's party so I can make more at one time!

Oh so good!  We added some cilantro and different cheeses, but these were so easy and fun to make.  Thanks Sara.

This was a big hit at my holiday party. The only opportunity for improvement is to find a way to prevent the soggy bottom. The mini-muffin pan mentioned in a previous review might do the trick. Solve that problem and here you have an 5 star starter.

These are such a good idea and they are so delicious!  They were even fun to make!  Something a little different to make for an appetizer that is a real hit.

I sauteed in olive oil some onions, the red peppers, and jalapeno peppers, then added diced tomatoes with green chilis, black beans and mexican corn.  Mixed in a little cheese to bind it, filled the cups, and put a little more cheese on top.  Very good, but messy.  Think I'll try the mini-muffin cups to make it a 1-bite snack vs. 3-4.

I made this recipe for our annual cookie exchange in December and it was a huge hit with all the gals.  I didn't make it very spicy but will bump it up next time I make it.  I had lots of requests for the recipe.  Yummy!

A little time consuming with shredding cheese, dicing tomatoes and green onions.  I cut the tortillas into quarters and arranged the quarter slice into the muffing pan.  A good vegetarian recipe overall.
