Very good and easy dish to make.  I did not add any lemon juice (didn't have any) and I also cut back on the mayo per other reviews.  I also felt that steaming the broccoli and onion before was a waste of time so I just added it to the dish when you combined all the ingredients.  Broccoli came out cooked perfectly (not mushy).  Overall, I will definitely make this dish again.

This is a kid pleasing recipe and the taste is very good!  The reason for the 3 stars is because of all the changes I will make when I fix this again.  1 bag of rice will be plenty.  I also used frozen broccoli (I had it on hand).  I don't like my veggies very mushy, so the broccoli was frozen when I put this in the oven...that was just right!  Since next time I will be cutting the rice in half, it might be a good idea to reduce the mayo by 1/2 too.  I did not add the curry powder because my family doesn't really care for it and the taste was still very good!  I would also reduce the browning time for the chicken to 6-8 minutes on each side, then bake everything for 30.  I also did not cut up the chicken.  My hubby is watching his carbs, so I left the chicken whole so he wouldn't have to eat a lot of rice to get chicken.

I ended up having to substitute a couple of the ingredients, but this is the best Cheesy Broccoli Chicken Casserole I have ever had.  It was tangy, cheesy, buttery, and savory.  You have to try it!

A few years ago I decided to never again eat microwave dinners. However one of my favorite ones was a cheesy chicken broccoli casserole by a certain lady named Marie who's last name shall go unmentioned. Anyways I really wanted to recreate that meal so I found this recipe. Just like the other reviews I made a few changes to suite my tastes. First, I grilled my chicken on my famous boxer grill with salt, garlic powder & pepper. Once cooked I cut it up in small pieces. I'm not a fan of boiled meat. Second I also used frozen broccoli as others have done. Third, I used a box of Near East garlic & herb wild rice (one box) prepared per the directions on the box. lastly, I substituted the mayo for sour cream. Maybe its just me but mayo belongs on turkey sandwiches not in casseroles. I also left out the curry powder. Anyhow it turned out great & tasted better than the microwave dinner I was trying to recreate.

This is delicious. My husband raved over it. I used knorrs creole butter rice and instead of mayo I used 2 big spoonfuls of sour cream. Didn't use curry powder. Used Cajun seasoning and red pepper. I didn't want to use all of those pans so I used leftover chicken and didn't cook the broccoli or onions just put them in the mixture of everything raw and it was cooked perfectly. It did make a whole lot. I filled my largest cassarole dish and filled a gallon sized ziplock about 3/4 full. I think I'm just going to freeze the leftovers since its just me and my husband and we still have half a pan left. Great recipe! Update**** I defrosted the leftovers in the fridge then baked as I did before and it tasted the same as it did the first time around. I wrote the instructions on the ziplock and I wouldn't try to eat it after 6 months according to stilltasty.com. I ate it at almost exactly 6 months.

to those of you who give a recipe a lower rating  because of the changes you made:  WHY???? You did not make THIS recipe so how can you make all these changes and rate it low. You made something entirely different, which is fine, but don't blame the writer of the recipe for your taste buds.  The recipe, as written, is exactly what the submitter wanted it to be.  I don't rate at all if I make changes without trying it this way first.  To someone who said they don't like curry and they didn't cut up the chicken and they didn't have lemon juice and all the other changes to fit your taste, you have no business rating a recipe if you tried something else!  I would not make a recipe for cherry pie and make it with apples!  Wow, the self-absorption of some people is beyond me.  

That said, this recipe is very good.   I did find it to be a bit less flavorful than I expected so the next time I made changes to fit my taste, which made it perfect for me, but overall it was good as written!

I didn't follow the recipe to a T,and made so many modifications I probably shouldn't post a review, but I am going to do it anyway, so take this review with a grain of salt. 

I made a double batch and had to use what I had on hand. I used previously cooked and shredded chicken that I had in the freezer. About 4+ cups of it. I used one head of cauliflower and 2 bunches of broccoli. I cooked white rice in water with chicken bouillon and used 5 cups of that once it cooked (the extra rice was just to bulk it up). I did 2 cans condensed chicken soup, 1 cup mayo, and 1 cup fat free sour cream. I subbed 1 tsp dried parsley for the 2 tsp fresh, used just shy of 4 tsp of tony cachere's cajun seasoning in lieu of the salt free seasoning blend, used all the garlic powder, omitted the curry since we don't have/like it, and added a dash of onion powder since I didn't have any sweet onions on hand to cook with my other veggies. 

I probably only mixed 2-3 cups of shredded colby jack (it was all I had on hand) into it. It filled a 9 x 13 as well as 2 deep foil 8" round pans. Topped with more cheese, baked, and fell in love. It was creamy, erred on the side of being more saucy than dry (which is always good in my book) and all in all was a nice comfort food casserole. Even my picky kids ate it and my husband seemed really impressed. Glad I have more in the freezer for an easy week night meal. 

Bottom line - it's a forgiving recipe, great to modify for your needs.

Cheesy Broccoli Chicken Casserole Haiku: "Looked like too much work. Found some steps that could be skipped. End result was great!" Made mine a "make-ahead-meal" w/ canned Kirkland chicken from Costco, leftover basmati rice (and 1 c. cooked), and didn't see any need to steam the broccoli and onion; just mixed everything together, although I did lightly-sautee the onion in butter to avoid raw crunchy bites of that. Other than drastically reducing the mayo, every other ingredient went in the same, and it tasted super; loved the lemon juice and curry powder, and just cheese on top, rather than other recipes that use breadcrumbs.

This was really tasty. I made a few changes. I used 2 cups of plain cooked rice in place of the seasoned rice and there was plenty of flavor with the other seasonings. Used a cajun seasoning for the "salt free seasoning blend. Used fresh lemon juice. It takes some time as there are a lot of ingredients but it was worth it. Very rich so I think for us it was a lot more than 8 servings with a side salad to compliment the meal. Took a little longer to cook than 30 minutes. I think I left it in for almost an hour, but until the cheese was darkening and bubbly.

Made this today and I absolutely loved it!! I changed a few things like many other ppl suggested and I put seasoned salt instead of the salt-free. Didn't have to add salt at all. Turned out very delicious! I added this recipe to my cook book. I definitely recommend everyone to try it even though it's a little time consuming! Very worth every bit of sweat! :)

I used brown rice and the chicken breast cook together to save a step. Also, I used frozen broccoli, cut back on the mayo 1/2 cup.  I mixed all the other ingredients in the pot with the cooked rice and, chicken breast.  I did not use the butter herb packs, I flavored my rice with beef bullion cubes.

This was awesome! Made it for dinner lastnight. Followed the recipe to a T except for adding Frenchs onions on top the last five minutes of baking, which we all felt made it 5 stars. I also cut the chicken up before cooking which I figured would be easier as well, theres alot of steps but totally worth it in the end!!

I made this recipe for my family last night. It was a homerun! Instead of using chicken breast halves I used chicken tenderloins. For the salt free seasoning I used Herbe De Provence and I used Rice a Roni chicken flavor.

I followed the directions exactly as written and this was outstanding. And it got better over time, so it made fantastic leftovers.  It is a lot of work, but it makes a large amount, so it was worth it to me. I would definitely use an herb and butter flavored rice side dish as directed. It adds a lot of seasoning and flavor to the casserole. Using just white rice might be the reason other reviewers felt there was too much mayonnaise flavor.  My family ate it up. But again, I think the key is to make it exactly as written. Delish!

I used jasmine rice and bumped it up to 1 1/2 cups (fam. eats lot). My family eats it better than white rice. I had the chicken breast left over and used frozen broccoli as well  which really cut down prep time. I gave this recipe 2 stars because the mayo must be a typo. I didn't even use a whole cup. The entire dish tasted like mayo. I have made similar dishes before that called for sour cream and if I made this again that is what I would do. Eating mayo in a casserole was just odd.

I made this exactly according to the recipe - didn’t change anything. It was great! I had most of the necessary ingredients on hand, just needed the broccoli and the Knorr rice side. It was very economical to make and it was very filling. I recommend this recipe and I will make it again.

It was ok BUT there's no way this can be prepared in 20 minutes. Just WAY to much work for your average casserole.

This was very good. I switched the mayo for sour cream. Sauteed(low medium heat) the onion (1 medium) with the chicken(cut into bite size pieces) in olive oil. Used two cloves of garlic instead of the powder, also sauteed with the chicken and onion. Everything else was done as the recipe called for. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is nice. I made a few changes like using sour cream instead of mayonnaise, and I added extra cheese then topped it with croutons. I also left out the lemon juice.

Family loved it! I cheated and used a frozen package of fully cooked chicken breasts. Just because of preference..I omitted the Dijon & lemon juice and would've preferred mixing in French's Onions rather than sweet onions. Also used 1/2c mayo & 1/2c sour cream to cut the calories a bit even though it probably didn't even make a difference since this is definitely a calorie packed casserole! Overall, great flavors..not bland & not too salty.

Great recipe!  I have made at least 10 different versions of this dish and I was losing hope in finding a good cheesy broccoli chicken casserole.  Luckily, I stumbled upon this gem of a recipe.  Like other reviewers, I used cream cheese instead of mayo.  I also bought already prepared rosemary grilled chicken from Whole Foods.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  My 2 year old and my husband ate it up and requested seconds.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you frenchy for sharing a casserole recipe that is actually tasty.

I just put this in the oven & I am going to give it full rating because I misread the recipe.  I put only 1/4 tsp garlic powder instead of 2.  We like garlic, too.  I used leftover Greek chicken thighs  without the skin, I used Greek seasoning for the salt free.  I was  using up dibs  and dabs from the fridge, so the cheese was partly cheddar jack and partly cojack.  I also used sour cream instead of mayo because it needed to be used up.  And I forgot the  lemon juice.  So if we don't like it the fault will be mine!

I have been searching for a chicken-broccoli-rice casserole recipe and have tried over a half dozen recipes including several listed here on All Recipes.  This is the most flavorful (not just cheesy) and the most moist, yum!  I did use a roasted chicken from the store to make it more convenient and actually forgot to add the lemon juice.  Otherwise - awesome!! So happy to have this recipe!

We enjoyed this! It filled up a 3 qt dish, so it makes a lot of food. I used frozen broccoli (still frozen when I baked it), and I was able to skip the steaming step. Because I skipped the steaming step, I forgot to add the onion, but it was fine without it. I’ll definitely make this again!

My entire family enjoyed it. I didn't have any season blend so I just tossed a bit of this and that in there that I had in my cupboard, but that's nothing new for me.  ;)   I also used the cheesy broccoli rice mix I had on hand and that worked out well with it.

As a person who likes mayo and rich foods I found the mayonnaise ruined the recipe. THe flavor overpowered it. I also don’t love those canned soups so I made a roux and added chicken broth. I think we would have liked this with substantially less or no mayo. Even without mayonnaise there’s a LOT of fat.

Did anyone actually MAKE this recipe?  I think it's great on it's own.  I'm sick of going into recipes and looking for objective reviews, there are none.  Everyone thinks they are a chef.  I always make the recipe as is first.  If I like it, I leave it.  Don't make people read all the changes you did specific to YOUR family.  I want to make the recipe I clicked on!  Geesh!!

This was an excellent recipe. I made it because I had some brown rice and extra broccoli handy. So, instead of using an instant flavored rice packet, I cooked my brown rice with 2 tbs butter and 1/4 tsp each of thyme, parsley & marjoram. I followed other cooks' suggestions and didn't steam the vegetables before adding to the casserole...they were cooked, but still a had a hint of crunch after 30 minutes in the oven. That was fine with me, but something for you to keep in mind if you're not a fan of that. Used seasoning salt since I didn't have any non-salt options for that, and two heaping spoonfuls of sour cream instead of mayonnaise, because it was what I had on hand. Super yummy! My husband doesn't even like broccoli and he ate two helpings of it! It is a filling casserole, so if you pair with a side salad I think the dish could easily feed 6-8. This one's a keeper!

I also only gave it a three because I made so many changes. I cooked it all in one pan to make it easier, first sautéing the onions and fresh garlic in coconut oil, then browning the Chicken and lastly sautéing the broccoli before stirring in only one bag of pre cooked brown rice, soup and plain yogurt to make it more healthful. I would never use margarine ever because it is so unhealthful. I skipped the curry because my family doesn't like it, Dijon mustard because I forgot, and lemon juice because yogurt is tart enough, but I'm sure it would be good with it. Next time I will use more cheese because, well, cheese.

This was a good, basic casserole. It's not my usual fare but I had leftover rice and leftover chicken so it was a snap to put together. I found it to be tasty and filling.  I would probably make again if I had those same leftovers but I wouldn't go out of my way to make it.

As I was preparing this recipe I realized I did not have the herb & butter rice packs but I had the herb & butter noodles instead.  I went ahead and finished making the recipe and it came out great.  At least that is what "I" thought.  The kids didn't particularly dig the fact everything was mashed together, they would rather have the ingredients separately on their plates.  It took about 45 minutes to prepare and an hour in the oven.

Made this using homemade curry powder and homemade Dijon mustard. It was the best casserole I've had in as long as I remember. My 7 year old son said it was the best he ever had. Huge compliment coming from him!  Will definitely make again.

I've made this recipe a few times now and each time is a hit. The only changes I make is I halve the recipe to 4 servings (which makes plenty in my opinion), I buy the pre-cut strips of chicken and brown them with some Cajun seasoning, and then sauté the onions in there once they're cooked. I leave the broccoli raw and use 3 heads chopped up into small pieces. I also use old cheddar cheese. I've made this with cheese soup instead of chicken and it was just as tasty. This recipe is a keeper and freezes well too!

This was absolutely wonderful!  I used chicken thighs, Knorrs Cheddar Broccoli rice side, Italian seasoning, added some mushrooms, and increased the curry to 1 teaspoon. Didn't use lemon juice.  This recipe rocks, and I will make it again.

I didn't use lemon, or onion, or knots rice, (used long grain + 2 C uncooked, did not have), I used the amount of cheddar cheese, but...added fresh Parmesan in the rice chicken mixture, (added canned corn), I steamed broccoli, but I didn't over do it, still had crunch. For others that say it was mushy, you could cut down steam time)? I used 1/2 mayo & added a 1/4 poppy seed dressin for sweetness, (substitute for no sweet onion).(I will cut back my cook time for chicken, I think I overbooked it, my fault).. I added more Parmesan on top with cheddar, absolutely yummy!

This was delicious and I wouldn't change a thing. Make sure you cut up the broccoli small and don't add any more dijon then what is stated in the recipe. Thanks for the yummy recipe. I will make this again for the fourth time in three weeks!

My husband and toddler son loved it! That makes it a 5 star recipe. The only thing I did differently was the rice. I only had jasmine rice on hand and cooked 1.5 C on the side, and added an extra can of COC soup because I found it a little dry. Other than those slight changes it was a perfect dish!

My family loves this recipes. I've made it several times and have made a few substitutions to suit our tastes. I use a 12.5 ounce can of shredded Kirkland chicken breast (I make for 4 servings)  and substitute cream cheese for the mayo.  Temperature and cook time is spot on. Enjoy!

This casserole was EXCELLENT!! I did make just a few changes: I used canned white meat chicken and frozen broccoli, no curry and sour cream instead of mayo. I served it with pasta salad and crescent rolls and my neighbors and family are asking if I have more!! DEF. saving and making again!

I tried this recipe and it came out great.  I used some mushroom soup so it wouldn't be so dry.  I used co-jack cheese,wild rice, and instead of chicken breast I used chicken nuggets without skin.  Thanks for sharing.

My sister made this tonight for my husband and I. It is the best Cheesey Broccoli Chicken Casserole I have ever had. The flavor was wonderful. My husband and I ate about half of the pan. I had to get this recipe from her and will be making it sometime soon!
