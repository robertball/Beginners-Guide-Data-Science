I loved this...did make changes, some from preference and some from necessity...and some from laziness.  Made on stove top; did not use bacon; added three carrots and three ribs of celery; used two cans diced tomatoes with liquid; added ground sage and fennel seed.  I really can't imagine the canned great northern beans cooking for that long in the newer crockpots which run so hot.  I cooked the onions, celery, and carrots then added the chicken.  After chicken was cooked, added tomatoes, beans, and seasonings and simmered for about thirty minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family (including three boys ages six and under) loved it!  I used turkey kielbasa and turkey bacon to keep this lean and still the taste was delicious.  My only change was to add 1 c. water to keep everything moist.

My husband is French, we live in France, and I just acquired a crockpot, so I was eager to try this recipe.  The whole family loved it!  I was going to say that it needed more beans, but I just realized that I'd read the recipe wrong and thought it called for one can, not three.  I happened to have chicken quarters on hand, so I used them, then removed the skin when it fell off.  Made it a bit fattier, perhaps.  My husband's suggestion was to add the sausage more at the end - he thought it got overcooked in the crockpot.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband tries to eat very healthy and has been wanting to eat more beans for protein so i've been trying to find more "bean friendly" recipes.  I made this recipe using turkey bacon, turkey kielbasa and chicken thighs.  My husband LOVED it! He couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  I reserved the liquid from both the beans (only used 2 cans) and the tomatoes and i ended up adding some of the tomato liquid back in.  I browned the turkey kielbasa after i cooked the turkey bacon and before i sauteed the onions.  I also left out the tomato paste (didn't have any in the pantry) and it still came out great. Next time i think i'll leave out the chicken and just use the turkey bacon and turkey kielbasa.  I cooked it on high as someone else suggested for about and hour and then turned down to low for another hour and a half.  The beans were soft but not mushy and everything was cooked through.  I'm sure the leftovers will be great if they don't get eaten in the middle of the night.  Overall great dish and i will be making again and again.

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  This was the first cassoulete I've ever attempted.  I loved that it was easy, and the house smelled amazing when it was in the slow cooker.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was very good, but I agree with previous reviews that it was a little on the bland side.  I would try it again using a can of seasoned diced tomatoes - fire roasted, or with spices.  I think that would help the flavor.  I used Bush's Great Northern Beans, Del Monte diced tomatoes, and turkey/beef/pork smoked sausage.  Mine was done at 4 hours on low.

This is a very good dish and very authentic tasting and the big plus for me it has an interesting background, historically speaking. My slow cooker has a clay pot (which cooks faster) and I don't know if that helped with the flavors but I'm sure it didn't hurt. Like many recipes, the flavor only gets better as a leftover dish. I serve it with a cheesy sourdough bread. I highly recommend this Cassoulet slow cooker recipe. Thank you, Smart Cookie, for submitting it.

I cooked it in a dutch oven at 325 for an hour instead of using a slow cooker and it came out great!

Everyone in my family loved this. I used turkey bacon and kielbasa. The only other ingredient change I made was to add carrots.  Using a slow cooker for me is about the ease of preparing the meal, so I didn't pre-cook anything but the bacon. I layered the whole chicken breasts, bacon, sausage and onions in the dish then mixed the remaining ingredients, except the bay leaves, in a bowl before spreading over the top. Placed the bay leaves on top and cooked on low for 7 hours. Towards the end I shredded the chicken and mixed. Delicious!

This was absolutely delicious!! I did make a few changes. I added 4 cups of chicken broth so it didn't dry out, as well as fresh rosemary. I also didn't brown the chicken. It came out very tender, and I shredded it at the very end. Perfect! Will make this again and again!

My family, including my finicky 6 year old daughter, loved this dish and I will definitely be making this again.  I see a few reviews mention that the beans turned to mush, but my beans came out perfectly.  Maybe its related to the quality of the canned bean or the fact that I did not stir once everything was mixed in the crock pot?  the changes/substitutions I made, mostly for health reasons: 1) chicken breasts instead of thighs, 2) low fat turkey bacon and sausage instead, 3) I used twice the amount of tomato, specifically Muir Glen diced fire roasted canned tomato.

Easy, and good.  
Next time I will start the cooking on high for at least an hour.  This will soften the beans.  I found that the beans were still a bit crunchy after cooking on low for five hours.  An extra hour on high took care of that, but I think it would be better to start out on high.  Probably doesn't matter.
I drained the beans, did not rinse, but saved the juice just in case thinning was needed.  It wasn't.
I did not drain the tomatoes as there was not much juice there to drain.  No problem.  But be sure to drain the beans or there will be too much liquid.
Next time I'll also use bacon-bacon, not turkey.
And, I just might substitute or add a duck leg or two.
As noted, this was a mighty tasty stew.  I think the thickness (for me, anyway, my spouse prefers a more soupy stew) was just right by draining the beans.

I used 6 thighs and half a pound of smoked beef sausage and regular bacon.  I also used two teaspoons of thyme, I didn't drain the tomatoes.   I then thickened it at the end with 2 tbs. cornstarch.
It was very good, like a comfort food.  It tasted very much like my homemade ham and bean soup.  I will make it again in the future.

I doubled this recipe and the only changes that I made  were using both thighs and breasts and cooking it in a dutch oven on the stove because my crockpots were loaned to a friend . However,  it worked fine and it was delicious. All 10 adults who ate it raved about it and the grandchildren who tried it liked it as well. I had none left over which was a disappointment to me. I will surely be making this again.

I made this according to the recipe (didn't change a thing).  My dinner guests raved about how great it was and 2 of them asked for the recipe.  Definitely great "comfort food" for a winter dinner party and it's the perfect meal if you have to work the day that you're hosting your gathering.  Thanks so much for sharing such a delicious recipe.

This dish exceeded my expectations!  I doubled the recipe, and made it on the stove top.  I added the beans about halfway through (so they didn't overcook and become mushy).  Aside from using chicken breasts and adding a little salt, I stuck to the listed ingredients, and served it with homemade french bread and kale salad.  It was bomb.com :)

This was really easy to make and very tasty.  Used chicken breasts and Italian sausage and it was really good.  Great for a cold winter day after work.

My whole family loved this. I added some chicken broth before cooking to make more sauce to be daubed up with a baguette.

Toute ma famille a aimé ça! J'ai ajouté du bouillon de poule avant la cuisson pour faire plus de sauce à absorber avec de la baguette.

I was afraid to leave this all day in my crock pot for fear of overcooking, so I adapted it to my pressure cooker and it was simply fantastic!  I pressure cooked the chicken, onions, garlic, spices and added carrots for 30 minutes, letting the pressure drop naturally for 15 minutes.  I then added the beans, sausage and cooked bacon, brought it back to pressure for about 3-4 minutes, fast released the pressure and it was all ready.  The flavors melded wonderfully and I was able to get it done in about an hour on a weeknight.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Really good.  I used white kidney beans, it's what I had, and it was yummy.  I'll make it again with the Northern, and I think I'll like it better.  I used one of mom's home-canned jars of tomatoes (undrained), much more tomato and juice than the recipe called for - but I'm glad.  I like it a little soupy, not so thick.

I think I would be fine with leaving out the bacon. I also had to add some salt but other than that it was quite tasty. My child was a little put off by its appearance but loved it when he finally tried it. I would love to make this again. It's a nice hearty comforting meal.

The ingredients in this recipe meld together very well making it a unique and tasty stew. I use andouille sausage to kick it up a bit.  I made this 4 days ago and it was very good. Since it is just me and my wife we had a lot left over. We had part of the left over stew last night and it tasted even better than when it was first made. I did not change anything and see no need to either.

I am giving this 3 stars rather than the 2 stars my version deserved because I had no tomato paste and substituted ketchup. I also used chicken breasts and not thighs. Perhaps those changes spoiled the flavor. My husband and I, both fans of full-flavored dishes, found the taste of this stew too concentrated and overwhelming. I am thinning leftovers with chicken broth but haven't tasted them so can't say whether that made the stew more palatable.

This is very good and I will definitely make it again.  I used 6 chicken thighs and 14oz package of smoked sausage.  This is more than the recipe calls for, but I wanted to use whole packages to make life easier.  I also used reduced sodium great northern beans. It turned out great.

The liquid was adequate.  The beans were cooked fine. The overall flavor was uninteresting. The sausage and bacon tasted like they had lost their flavor. This recipe didn't call for any salt and I didn't add any.  I think it could have used some salt.

I was given a bag of these bean from my mom, and knew a normal southern pinto route wouldn't work. So I simply 'Googled' Great Northern bean recipe and this one came up first (plus I already had most of the ingredients). It is very good,  but it doesn't say to add any water while in the slow cooker. I did add about 4 or 5 cups of water to help soften the beans.  After I cooked them for 5 hours on slow. So add some water to the recipe. My wife said it was very good.....

I didn't find the flavors here particularly exciting, but I did think it was good (and easy, as promised). My husband liked it a lot, and my two-year-old was pretty happy with it, too--especially the turkey bacon.

This wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great. The beans turned into almost pure mush and it was only in the crock pot for just under 4 hours. My whole family ate it, but we were not impressed. Sorry!

Delicious! I modified by skipping the bacon, and adding some carrots and celery. The beans got a little mushy in the crock pot, but overall my grad. student study group gave this dish an A!

Made it pretty much note for note, although I love garlic so I added way more than three cloves. I also added a little chicken broth and white wine to add moisture.  When I make this again I’ll probably use a little more bacon since it tasted a touch under-seasoned after adding the liquids.  Good stuff, very hearty.

Served this to a large group (40). My favorite comment was, "I don't normally like beans, but this was delicious! May I have the recipe?" Definitely a winner. I had to use dried beans- I live in a part of the world where canned beans are not available. I simply  rinsed the dried beans 24 hours in advance, put them in the crock pot with hot water and cooked them on low overnight. Then I drained the water, and followed the rest of the directions as is, accept I did add some of the bean water back into the recipe. Great and easy!

Based on other recommendations, I increased the thyme to 2 tsp., included the juice from the tomatoes, and added 2 chopped carrots and 1 stalk chopped celery. Because I was short on time, I cooked it on high for 1 hour, then on low for 2 hours. The result was a really delicious and satisfying winter meal. My entire family loved it, including my DH, who tends to prefer spicy foods. I will definitely make this again.

This was one of the best dishes I've had in some time! I had to cook it (on low) a while longer than recommended (closer to 10 h), but it still came out great.

This was really good! It's definitely comfort food and delicious! Followed instructions and was amazed with the outcome. Thank you! 
ETA: This has become a staple in our house. I've been putting all ingredients into the crockpot on low in the morning without precooking any of it, and returning home to a completely cooked, delicious meal. Everyone raves about this meal. Thanks again!

This dish was a real hit!  It is very hearty, earthy, textured and subtle undertones of flavor.  Loved using the slower cooker given a busy life and cannot believe something this good can be made this way.  Hurrah.

I make it with some recipe changes: use homemade gluten free chicken soup (3/4 cup organic chicken stock, 3/4 cup almond milk, 3 TBL gluten free cornstarch) and add 1 cup half-and-half cream. I love curry and also add turmeric and 1 tsp cayenne. Cut chicken into smaller chunks so cooking only lasts 45 minutes. This is my favorite chicken recipe with brown rice!

Delicious! Some changes i made...I used our leftover thanksgiving turkey instead of chicken, and i used pre-cooked andiulle sausage instead of turkey bacon. It could have used more white beans, so next time I will use 1.5-2 cans. Great after thanksgiving meal!!

My boys loved this. Easy, one pot meal. The only change I made was cooking it all in one pot and not transferring it to the slow cooker. I covered it and finished it in the oven on 300 for an hour and a half. That's the time limit that suited me. But you could finish it on 350 much quicker. I also added 2 cups of chicken broth so that there was more broth to it otherwise it would've been to dry. Only thing I would change is add more broth.

Turned out great.  Should check for salt as you are depending on the saltiness of the bacon and the smoked sausage to enhance it. I find that regular bacon is saltier than the turkey and gives it the boost it needs. Am vacationing in Mexico and made a bunch of substitutions (Smoked pork chops and a very small amount of chorizo for spice).  AWESOME!

Eh, it was fine. Didn't turn to mush or anything. Outside of the sausage though, everything in this dish had the same flavor, and nearly the same texture. Bacon even seemed wasted. It was fine to try, and actually tasted better than I thought it would, but I probably won't make again. ( Day turned out really hot, so I wasn't looking forward to going home to a heavy meal, but it wasn't too heavy and tasted fine.)

Yum! I made this for my brother who studied in Toulouse for a semester. He told me about the cassoulet that he had while living there. This is missing a crust of cheese on top but it saves a few calories without it! Awesome winter dinner that warms you right up! I think I have to make this again next week!
