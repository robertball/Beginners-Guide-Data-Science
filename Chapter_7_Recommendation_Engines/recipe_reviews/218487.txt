I use all recipes for all my recipes and I have never written a review.  That's how good these are. I shaped these into logs and used a whole wheat low carb wrap along with the sauce and some tomatoes and onions.  Could not find Urfa biber so used a little less than the called for amount of chili powder.  My husband said that he could eat these every night for the rest of the summer.  Awesome!

Very Tastey!  I did make a few changes.  Used sour cream instead of yogurt and did not have the spices of sumac or coriander so did without and they were still great.  Served with tomatoe slices on them.  My Husband ate two because they were so good.  Will make again for sure!

Really great burgers. I used about 1½ cups of Greek yogurt and skipped the straining step. The urfa biber was wonderful; it has a smoky, almost chocolatey flavor. I didn't need a whole red onion; next time I'll just eyeball how much I think I’ll need for four burgers. I will make these again!

i m not shure what is the common between burger and gyro, but anyway,the recipe has its originality.The red bell pepper doesnt enrich significantly the taste of the burger especially after  1 1/4 teaspoons red pepper flakes and stay uncooked inside the patties.Maybe if you grilled it well ,minced and then mixed with the ground beef will be better .About the yogurt sauce ,or the tzatziki,or the milk salad,or the Snowwhite salad as is known in different parts of the world.Better strained it inside the refrigerator,let just hang over a container for like 6 hours. The point is,the cucumber has 92% water, no matter what you do ,cannot be dry,always will release water in the mixture,especially in the fridge.So have the strained yogurt already cold,cool and  mince the cucumber and mixed it immediately.You can add walnuts,they go very well with that salad which  is best tasting in that particular moment,when is really fresh.It doesnt pays to substitute the yogurt with different dairy products,it will be poor imitation , seen it too many times.Also if dont strain the yogurt but watered it ,keep everything else,just pinch of salt,makes great cold soup.Now you can grate the cucumber,otherwise MINCED,please.

These were the bomb! We ate them in pitas with cucumbers, onions, and tzatziki sauce. These made the best burgers I have ever hade in my entire life.

My rating is just for the burger, and not for the sauce. It was very tasy and super easy to make! Thanks!
