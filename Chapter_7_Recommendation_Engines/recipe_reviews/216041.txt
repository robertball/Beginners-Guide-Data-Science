This is seriously the best chili I have made! I did make a couple of changes though. First I added ground pork instead of beef as I dont care for beef. I also added cilantro and my own chili seasonings, homemade. I did omit the green pepper as I dont care for it and I added half of a red onion instead of yellow. Its delicious!

Lots of taste! The sour cream(i used light) really finishes the chili off well.I used half ground chicken and half ground beef for a leaner meal.

This is awesome.  To add more hottness to it, I took out the tomato paste and used El Pato instead. :)
