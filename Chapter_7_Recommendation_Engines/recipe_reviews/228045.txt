Pickles in a roux - who would have thought?  I was doubtful and pleasantly surprised.  If you like tarter sauce you will like this sauce.  The method for the pork is spot on.  Try it, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  :)

Ive made this recipe over a dozen times now. I cant find the words to say how awesome it is! I dont have a meat tenderizer thing so I snagged my my mother-in-laws tiny cast iron skillet and use that. Its heavy and smooth on the bottom so it dosnt tear up the meat while thinning it out.

Delicious! I really didn't want to take a chance by adding pickles, so I left those and the jalapenos out. They might work, but I wasn't brave enough to try it, and we loved the gravy with just the green onions. I served it with mashed potatoes and roasted zucchini. I ended up needing more like 2 cups of bread crumbs. Next time, I would use less and add as needed, so the extra crumbs aren't wasted.

I've already left my review of how amazing this recipe is, I just remembered an important note. The recipe calls for the pork to be covered with plastic when refrigerated, but the video tells you to refrigerate uncovered. I refrigerated "uncovered" as Chef John says in the video. This only makes sense, to help dry and seal the Panko and coatings. Thank you again Chef John!

This was fantastic! The pork was still crispy the next day, and the gravy was delicious. I wish I'd made a double serving! Even my boyfriend, who isn't a huge fan of jalapenos (or spice in general) adored it. I will definitely be making this again.

Sorry Chef John! I usually love your recipes, but this cream gravy was way off the mark for my taste buds. I made it exactly as written but it had an off-putting wallpaper paste taste (I let my flour cook so not sure why it got stuck in the "raw flour" taste state) that couldn't be saved even with all the 'should-be' flavorful additions of dill pickles and jalapenos.

The most interesting part of this recipe is the cream gravy. The dill pickles gave it a very unique taste and crunchy texture which I enjoy. I just don't quite get the jalapeños... It didn't add much heat to the gravy which I kind of expected because of the amount of milk involved, so is it just to add color and texture? Or did it add some taste that I am unaware of? It was a little bland to start and needed the W sauce and some salt to help it out a bit.

Perfectly crispy coating!  I skipped the jalapeno in the sauce since I'm not a fan, and after tasting it I decided to add a squirt of Dijon.  I also cheated and used pickle relish.  Came out really, really good!  Will absolutely make again!

We loved this! I wasn't sure how the pickles were gonna go in the sauce, but it was great. This was a nice change from the usual and one that I will make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

WOW! We are surprised this doesn't have more reviews! This was the most delicious way we've cooked a pork tenderloin, ever! We have saved this as a favorite and will make it again and again. The flavors are wonderful! Don't be afraid of pickles, people! I made the recipe Gluten and Dairy Free using GF bread crumbs, GF all purpose Red Mill flour, and unsweetened almond milk. It still turned out incredible. The only other alteration we made was not to cut and pound the tenderloin, but to instead cut it cross-grain at 1/2" thick, making lots of little cutlets (better portion control too). Try it!!!

Made this tonight and followed the recipe minus the onion. The family said to put into the rotation of meals, I guess that means they give it 5 stars also. It was such a contrast of flavors that don't seem like they should work but they do. I have always passed on Chef John recipes due to a lot of them seem more complicated than I am comfortable or more complex than I want to do on a weeknight after a long day of laboring. Figuring to try and search for Chef John recipes that are within my hour start to finish schedule I try and do at night now. Good one.

This was pretty simple and easy to make. The meat was definitely tender and crispy! I was hoping to taste more jalapenos and pickles. I guess I was imagining the Tartar sauce with jalapeno but it was not, so I ended up putting more pickles and jalapenos. The next time I might just going to make my own usual Tartar sauce and add jalapenos. Now the pork was just like the Japanese pork cutlet, Tonkatsu, and I didn't even have to deep fry it.  I give 10 stars for that.  I've been making just the crispy pork since and enjoying many tonkatsu recipes.  Thank you, Chef!

My family loved this! They demanded I make it again two days later. I can tell you I will be making this every time pork loin goes on sale. I followed the recipe exactly and that sauce was so unique yet fantastic. Do not be afraid! Try this sauce! I'm about to make this again and the only change I'd make is to double the sauce.

I'll eat pork if I'm starving and someone else cooks it, I just don't care for it, but this meal was delish! Even my son ate an entire cutlet which is nothing short of a miracle, he's such a picky eater. The directions did not state where to include the cayenne pepper so I just added it to the sauce. I used a 15 pound dumbbell to flatten the meat, it worked perfectly.

This was SOOO good. Next time I might double the gravy because it was very yummy! The pickle and jalapeno really made this gravy, very different from the normal gravy that I eat and definitely better than most! Thanks for the great meal!!!

Excellent! Nice and crispy and tasty! I doubled the sauce, but there was no need to, for me. I don't need a lot of sauce nor want too much to take away from the goodness of the crispy coating! Even hubby liked these, and he's not a fan of sauces at all! He had seconds, with the sauce! A definite keeper!

The sauce was amazing. Even a pickle hater in my house loved it! The flavor really worked really well with the pork. The sauce was very similar to our favorite tartar sauce plus the kick from the Jalapeno. Thanks for posting this recipe! This one is good enough for company!

Deeelicious! Pretty easy, too.  I made this exactly as stated except had boneless loin chops and no jalapenos (used peperoncini - not the same!I know) Loved the crunch on the chops and the gravy is to die for - I might make it into a soup, I love it so much! Thanks again, CJ! Love you, your videos & your recipes - please don't stop!

This is one of my favorites! I usually have all the ingredients on hand, and the video is so useful as well. Most of the time I end up adding more milk than listed in the ingredients list, at least half a cup more. It thickens up just as well, and there's more delicious gravy. I accidentally used teriyaki-flavored pork tenderloin, and that was surprisingly delicious and very tender. I have even made this with beef and it was good. I always use my canned pickled jalepenos, and that seems to work great.

I made this last night for dinner, I was very nervous but I really wanted something different so I tried it. I loved it!!!! It was amazing. the only thing that I did differently was I used sweet relish instead of the Dill pickle. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Made it several times and the family loves it.  I was at first hesitant on the pickels in the gravy but gave it a good taste with a little crunch. I tried this idea in other gravy used in other recipes.

Very tasty, even my picky 5-year-old granddaughter liked them.   Dill pickles in the gravy is something that I would never have tried, they add flavor and a bit of crunch.  Since I was cooking for tender tastebuds I substituted red bell pepper for the jalapeno, next time I make it I will do it with the extra spice.  I highly recommend, watching the video, there are a few subtle things that have changed the way I handle the flour/egg/breading steps.

This was delicious! The crispy texture was great, and the gravy a surprising combo of ingredients that worked together really well! I was worried that it might be too spicy for my kids, but it wasn't that spicy at all! The only change I made was adding a bit of garlic powder to the pork and to the gravy mixture.

First time I made this, I had never had successful gravy. It came out perfectly! The cutlets are tender, the gravy devine! This has become my family's new favorite meal. Example: Both boys had already had dinner Wednesday night. I made this for my wife and myself but cooked two extra cutlets for the next day's lunches. The boys smelled the cutlets and gravy cooking and asked if they could have some as well. No cutlets for lunch, but won the nickle bet with my wife. Really, the sauce is the maker for this dish and teaches everyone how easy it can be to make a delicious gravy. Panko crumbs are not necessary, regular ones work fine, but the Panko adds extra crunch.

If I change it, I did not really make this recipe. The pickle and jalapeño gravy seemed like a strange combination to me, but gives a subtle, delicious, and different taste. My husband can be picky about pork dishes, but he requested it again. So easy and fast to produce an unique dish.

Delicious! I followed the recipe as written except I breaded using separate dishes, which is what I've been doing for years (old habits are hard to break I guess). The sauce is surprisingly yum. Don't be scared to try the pickles everyone! 
Thanks Chef John.

Pleased I risked the idea of pickles in gravy on pork! 

The only changes I made were, 1. Didn't use Worcestershire, used Liquid Aminos in its place. Also, I added 1/3C+ of parmesan heated through just before serving. This was due to my jalapeno being super hot and needing something to cut the heat.  I was so fearful of the combination, I served gravy on the side.  Served with pilaf and the complement of the gravy made for a good meal w/ a green salad. 

Personally, I don't think people who fail to follow the recipe essentially as given on the site should write reviews and certainly not rate.  

Thank you Chef John for posting this new keeper.

I wanted to love this recipe as it sounded delicious.  Made exactly as described but it came out extremely bland.  Added lots of additional seasoning to sauce after the fact to give it flavor and allow us to eat it.  Tonight for the left over pork cutlets I'll be making regular home made gravy using chicken stock.

I followed the video and instructions except I did not use pork tenderloin but boneless pork loins.  I found the pork to be tender and juicy but I ended up really cooking the crust almost black while part of the pork was still pink inside.  It might have been the cast iron skillet I used...I am new to using cast iron.  I liked the gravy.  It cooked up just like you demonstrated.  However, even with the cayenne and jalapenos..I wished it had more spice....dinner was enjoyed by all when I finally cooked the pork thoroughly.  Good recipe.

What’s not to love about gravy that includes baby dill pickles? This dish is a refreshing change of pace, and will definitely make over and over.

Did not alter a thing and turned out excellent. 

Will try a variation using boneless skinless chicken breasts next. Thanks for the recipe Chef John!

Delicious.  Pork cutlet was crispy and very tender.  I used pork cutlets already pounded (like a cube steak).  Definitely good to prepare ahead of time and put in the fridge.  
Sauce was a surprise.  I wasn’t sure I would like the combination but it was great!

We loved this recipe, especially my husband. I did not have jalapenos so I added a squirt of dijon mustard as suggested by another reviewer. my only complaint is that it required a lot of last minute cooking, the sauce, frying the pork and cooking potatoes and baby broccoli. Next time I will simplify the veg so I don't feel hot and bothered by the time I sit down!

This recipe was fantastic. Hubby really liked it. The sauce was different since it had dill pickles in it, don't be scared. It was delicious. Perfect for the cutlets. Definitely going to be making this again. I also appreciated the instructions on preparing the cutlets. Letting them sit in the frig once breaded was helpful and the breading  stayed on the cutlet.

I made the full recipe of the sauce and only 2 pork cutlets and served it over pasta. The jalapeno I used was huge. I was expecting some zing.  The sauce was just ok.  It was amazingly bland. Not for me.

We thought this was a delicious dinner!  I ran out of panko crumbs and so used saltines and also subbed pepperoncinis instead of the jalapeno.   I would have a little extra milk on hand to get the sauce the consistency you'd like, but this was an easy and tasty dinner!  Thanks once again, Chef!

We dug in before we had a chance to snap a picture. It is an usual combination of sauce ingredients . I’ll add more jalapeño for heat next time since half was not enough. My husband loved this recipe. We will make it again....and again.

my husband hates pork chops!  I made this recipe tonight following directions exactly.  and he went back for a second chop! even my 15 year old ate it.  it was very good! it was not spicey at all..I was worried about the jalapeno.  I think I may add a little something more for a kick next time.  but this was a great change for dinner.

I did not have green onion.  I added a little bacon grease and bacon bit to gravy and was surprised how good it was.  I would prefer no Jalapeno in the future.

I was looking for a different type of pork tenderloin recipe. When I saw it was Chef John's I knew it would be good! It was a little time intensive with all the breading and frying, but it was worth it! The only thing I changed was due to not having the ingredient. I used a half of a dehydrated habanaro pepper in the gravy, (then picked out the pieces after) and also a teaspoon of A1 Steak Sauce since I didn't have Worcestershire sauce.  I really liked the "zing" of the sauce with the pickles in there and the spice. I'd make it again. My mouth is still tingling from the pepper, but at least it wasn't a boring dinner. Served with rice and broccali.

I oh, so loved this recipe! I have to add, I also love the fact that my husband HATES onions, pickles for the most part, and jalapenos. But this is my year, 2018, I'm tired of cooking boring foods for the past two years of marriage. (Who came up with this institution? But that's another discussion.) An entire bunch of green onions, he didn't have a clue to any of the ingredients and LOVED this gravy. He did ask what the green stuff was (lol, everything) and I mumbled nothingness, and I'm pretty sure I heard him say the word "hide" to which I said nothing. I love to laugh. Even if it's on the inside! Will be making this often, and yes, with chicken, etc, and I think it would be great with Cod. Thank you John! What a kick! In more ways than one! Delicious!

These cutlets were divine. I was a little skeptical of the sauce because it sounded a little different but took the plunge and gave it a try. I forgot to buy green onions so I had to substitute red but the sauce was still good.  My family raved about this meal.

My 11 year old grandson is Celiac, so I adjusted the breading accordingly. I was worried he would not like the sauce (I used 1 tablespoon cornstarch) with the dill pickle, jalipeno pepper and onion etc. He devoured it and had seconds!!  It was a hit with the whole family!!

I used coconut oil, which is awesome for browning and crispness!  Better for you than vegetable or canola oil!  The sauce was amazing, didn't omit anything, I did use unsweetened almond milk, instead of dairy milk!  Definitely, will make again!

Made as directed except for the jalapeño. We don't eat those. I almost didn't add pickles but everyone else said it was good so went with their recommendations. Excellent meal. I served it with mashed potatoes and creamed corn. Hubby says give it 5 stars and make it again. He almost didn't try the gravy because of the pickles, but he tried it on a little corner of the cutlet, then on most of the rest. Left a little corner for A1 because that's how he usually eats it. Thank you for a great recipe

I made the pork cutlets without the sauce and they were excellent.  My husband said he liked the pork this.  Very crispy.  Next time I may add seasoning salt or garlic for some extra flavor, but  excellent as is.

I was skeptical as other readers, about pickles in a white sauce,but both my husband and I really enjoyed this. I did not put jalepeno in, because we are not fans - but added the cayenne and it was still delish. Simple, tasty and quick for a weeknight supper.

My only complaint with this recipe is: I followed it exactly, portions, etc., and made it for the three of us.  I only got one serving!  There was nothing left - no sauce, no cutlets! Nuthin'!  ;-)

This will definitely be made again.

If you make just the pork cutlet we gave it 5 stars. The meat was juicy & crispy. We won't make the sauce though cause my hubby couldn't eat it & I had just a little.  Nasty. The instructions weren't complete as it lists cayenne pepper but never says where to add it.

This was A very easy recipe to fix. I would chop the pickles very fine next time.. My husband who does not like spicy stuff thought the sauce was good with the cutlets .

I dislike giving this only three stars as I thought it deserved a four.  Four means that I will make this again, but my husband said it wasn't his cup,of tea - phooey!  So although I gave this a three I think others should try this!

Ok, so this time I made it with chicken instead of pork. The chicken really picks up the flavors of the jalapeño and dill better than the pork.  Still gotta work on the sauce a bit thick.

These are AMAZING, and beyond that, the video is very true to how easy it is to make.  There's not much better than juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside!!  I can't wait to make them again.  PS - we didn't attempt the gravy, but it turns out, they don't even need gravy.

This is the first time I have ever made pork cutlets, the technique Chef John used for the "one plate" method for flour, egg wash and breading made sense. I did not make the sauce this time as I didn't have several of the main ingredients on hand. The cutlets were wonderful naked, can't wait to try them again with the sauce. My husband loved the flavor, crunch and how tender they were. I will definitely make them again.

Loved this style.  I  did not have pickles, so I used capers and the gravy is fantastic.  I also used Prrogresso Italian Style Breadcrumbs, instead of panko.

Everybody liked this though the kids thought the "gravy" was a bit spicy due to the jalapenos.  (I didn't even try with pickles.)  Make sure the frying pan isn't too hot or the crumbs will burn before it fully cooks.  (Obvious... but we all make mistakes. :-)  Will definitely try this one again now that I'll have some idea what I'm doing.

Pork was cooked perfect but the sauce was bland.  I only had three green onions but followed the recipe exactly other than that.  Would not make again.

Very tasty !  I used chicken filet's and also center cut pork chops pounded thin instead of the tenderloin's. The roux or gravy was excellent. Will make again.

I used a can of Progresso creamy mushroom soup instead of the condensed soup. It was very good. The pork chops had a good crust, but at the same time they were very moist.

Instead of a pork tenderloin, I used very thin boneless pork chops, no pounding necessary. Instead of jalapenos, I used a ripe poblano that I had from my garden. This worked out perfectly. I did have to use a little extra milk because the sauce was a bit too thick.

Very good.  My gravy was much better the next day--I recommend making it before cooking the pork, then reheating if necessary. It was very thin when cooked according to recipe directions (in the order indicated).  Also, do add a little salt to pork after frying as directed.  I didn't and it obviously needed it.

Very good. I will be making this again. I only used half of the jaIapeno pepper, should have used the whole thing.  This is not an "easy" recipe to make. A lot of easy steps, maybe. But a lot of steps.  Worth it!  Pickles in a roux,  go figure.

As always when I'm trying a recipe for the 1st time I made it without any changes to give it a fair review even when you see something that sounds a lil "different" , like the pickles, lol. This is one I wouldn't change anything the next time for its perfect how it is. All the kids and adults loved it!

The sauce is what makes this dish.  After it thickened, I put it in the blender.  Besides making the vegetables smaller, it brings out the flavor of the pickles and jalapenos

I would just double the sauce.  It was delicious and we wanted extra to go with the potatoes.  I made it exactly as the recipe was written and that's the only suggestion I have.   I'm making it again tomorrow for guests.

Delicious. the first  time I made it, I thought the coating looked too  fragile, so I repeated the egging and breadcrumbing (is that a word?) - not a good idea! Next time, I trusted the recipe and the result was superb.  Didn't do the sauce, so will not comment - just to say the cutlets are a delight.

This recipe was so good! The ingredients were a little unusual but you have to give this a chance, it's worth the effort.  The pork is crispy and the gravy is perfect without being too spicy.  I will be making this again soon.

Pork was crisp but overall taste of the dinner with the sauce was lacking a great taste. 

Do not think I will cook this again.

It was very good and both my husband and his friend said they would have it again. It was by nice and crunchy, yet moist inside. I made spinach mashed potatoes to go with it and they were a hit as well.

Absolutely delicious!  I used boneless pork chops b/c that is what I had on hand. It will definitely become a part of our regular rotation.  Even my fussy eater enjoyed it and wanted more.

Chef John deserves a medal for this recipe. It's not terribly complicated but very flavorful. Crispy pork, delicious sauce, what's not to love? I have never used pickles in the sauce, but I think it's perfect even without them. This has become one of my favorites!

Also, to the people who thought the sauce was bland or who didn't make it at all because they thought it sounded strange: I think you're 100% wrong, but the beauty of Chef John's recipes is that he is teaching you a *technique.* If you prefer thinner sauce, add more milk. If you prefer thicker sauce, let it reduce more. If you think it's bland, add seasoning, more jalapenos, or whatever. You can always adjust something to better suit your personal tastes.

I made the pork portion to which I loved your method with the flour and egg saving. I mixed pano into my bread crumbs. Great idea.  The meat turned out perfect. I didn't make the sauce, too lazy and I had my homemade applesauce for it. Will definitely keep your method.

This recipe is really all about the gravy and though it's pretty good as is, I made a few changes to suit my personal tastes. I used sliced white onion in place of the green onion and that along with the jalapenos provided enough texture for me so I cut out the pickles and added a little bit of white vinegar to taste instead.  I also cut out the Worcestershire.  I might be weird in this way but when I put solids in a gravy I prefer it much less thick in consistency than this recipe makes it so I obviously used a little more milk too.  It all turned out delicious and I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

As usual I started and discovered no Worcestershire sauce or jalapeño peppers. so skipped the peppers and substituted Soy sauce, and some Spicy Red Sauce from Rio Ranch I got on my last trip to Texas. Put the sauce on the side, so you can dip meat or vegi.  Pork prep made it taste awesome!
Made it for lunch with some cut green beans. Delish! I will make this again.

Loved the crispy pork but the milk gravy was bland and way too heavy for such a rich dish, so I would not make that again. Ended up tossing it out; just didn't have the time to doctor it up to make it palatable. Next time I'll make a piccata sauce for the pork. Served this with braised red cabbage and mashed potatoes. Other than the sauce, it was delicious.

Made  it exactly as directed and it tasted great! Watching the video was a help. Next time I'll try some pickled jalapeño in place of some of the dill pickle, we found the jalapeño not hot at all, tho that may have been the one I  bought as their level of heat can vary greatly.

This was amazing. The only thing I changed was I used a half of a cup of heavy cream instead of milk, and it was perfect. Excellent recipe! I served it with sweet potatoes and Parmesan asparagus and it complemented it perfectly.

I enjoyed this recipe a lot and definitely will make again. I did thicken up the sauce by adding a little more flour at the end. I loved the tang from the pickle and heat from the serrano chile I used. overall great flavor. I used bone in pork chops so mine came out a little more darker next time I'd use boneless or finish off in the oven for complete cooking.

I made it without the sauce, which I am sure is delicious.  I loved the fact that I was able to make the cutlets in the afternoon and then cook them in the evening for dinner.  I will make again and they were a hit with the family.

The pickles make this dish.  And the breading on the pork.  It was just fantastic.  Don't be afraid to try the pickles.  I wouldn't make it again without them.  How awesome would this be with fish, same coating technique and same sauce......Another winner!!

I really enjoyed this.  I made it twice due to having two pork loins.  The first time, I included the pickles and the second they were left out.  I prefer it without the pickle taste.  I also prefer it with the jalapeno seeds/heat left in.

The pork was excellent but the gravy didn't turn out as well as I hoped. It was probably my fault though. I'll definitely be making this again and hopefully I will get the gravy right next time.

Made this recipe several times and it's my family's absolute favorite pork recipe, the roux is crazy good!  Chef John is a genius!

I used turkey cutlets and the dish turned out very nicely. However the gravy sounds extremely unappealing, so I quickly made some regular gravy from a packet instead.
