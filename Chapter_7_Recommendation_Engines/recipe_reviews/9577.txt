I left in the raisins, using 1/2 cup, and changed the walnuts to macadamia nuts. Macadamia nuts, totally make either these or chocolate chip cookies!

These cookies ended up nice and crunchy, without being crumbly. The amount of flour is Critical! I tried it with an 1/8-cup more flour, and the cookies were too hard, and too dry. So make sure you use 3/4 cup, and tap it down.

The recipe doesn't really make 48 cookies...more like 36, but that's okay. Just double it. You'll end up eating them all in 10 minutes anyway. :-)

Excellent recipe, for a novice oatmeal cookie person.  By the way, nowadays, I borrowed from the pros, and make the dough-drops, putting them real close on a cookie tin, then freezing them. Take the frozen dough balls and stick them in a bag, and voila! you have fresh cookies whenever you want. I usually end up adding about 5 minutes to the baking time, if the dough's frozen.

Absolutely wonderful!  A quick, easy delicious recipe.  They were crispy outside and slightly chewy inside.  I placed them in Mason jars for the Christmas holidays.  They were the perfect size and texture.  I cannot say enough good things about this recipe!

These are actually the greatest cookies ever. Super easy to make-one large bowl and a wooden spoon and 15 minutes later you've got cookies. I used raisins the first time I made them and then raisins and mini chocolate chips the second time and needless to say they don't last long. Also if you cut the baking time by a couple of minutes they stay soft and chewy.

These cookies have a very good flavor.  I did use a teaspoon to drop the cookies on the baking sheet, but I didn't get 48 cookies, more like 30.  After cooling, the cookies get rather hard (I did only bake for 12 minutes as the directions recommend).  If you like a softer cookie, just microwave them for 10 seconds before eating.

These were very good cookies. The only changes I made was to omit the walnuts because I didn't have any and I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Even my husband, who says he only really likes chocolate chip cookies, liked these. I used my #50 cookie scoop and got only one dozen 3" (approx.) cookies. I did bake for 12 minutes and we ate them while still a little warm. They were nice and chewy in the middle and lightly crisp on the edges. I couldn't tell you how they tasted the next day because we ate all 12 in one evening :) I can't imagine getting 48 cookies out of this amount of batter - if you do they would be awfully tiny and the baking time would have to be drastically reduced.  This recipe was very similar to the Vanishing Oatmeal Raisin Cookies on my box of oats. There are just very minimal differences, with one of them being the ingredients are doubled what is called for in this recipe and that one says it makes 4 dozen cookies also. I wonder if the yield of 4 dozen stated in the recipe is a misprint? No matter the size they were very good!

Delicious. I added cinnamon to mine and I'll add even more the next time I make these. They've only been out of the oven 15 min and my husband has already eaten 8 cookies. I got 28 cookies out of mine, no where close to 4 dozen but they're so good it doesn't even matter. Thanks for sharing!

These where great I normally don' like oatmeal cookies but, as a surprise to my wife who does I searched for a recipe and found this one, I read the reviews and the one about getting flour just right, it did make me keep second guessing myself but, they where rght on , one recommendation I would make, is break the walnuts up a little if you make the cookies tsp big they will dominate the cookie, but good recipe, a keeper

Not the cookie I was looking for, but these were a very nice surprise. I used butter flavor crisco, and it def added a buttery flavor. these were a bit crumbly coming out of the oven, but held up long enough to get rave reviews! I put walnuts and golden raisins in mine. Have a big glass of milk handy!!! Yum!

Do NOT substitute butter for. the shortening specified.  The cookies flattened out and slid into each other.  I crumbled the mess into a bag for a quick ice cream topping.  Next time I'll try doing it correctly.

I had my doubts, but these are WONDERFUL!  I made these a few different ways, just to give a variety of flavor.  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to original recipe and baked for 11 minutes.    This is definately a keeper!  The kids love these!!

Really loved the ease of this recipe.  I substited 1/2 almond meal for the walnuts.  It probably changed the texture a bit but gave it a great flavor.  I also used almond oil instead of butter or margerine.  I also added a little pumpkin pie spice.  This is a keeper!

I used butter instead of shortening, used 1/2 c white sugar + 1 T molasses instead of the sugars, replaced the egg with 1/4 c unsweetened applesauce, used white whole wheat flour, replaced walnuts with pecans, added a few semisweet chocolate chips, and baked for 10 minutes. The best oatmeal cookies I have ever made (and I'm sure they would have been if I hadn't modified anything as well!).

These are indeed VERY close to being "THE WORLD'S BEST OATMEAL COOKIE"! They're very quick and easy to make and bake, and are especially yummy hot out of the oven. I made mine without the nuts, but added raisins and milk choc chips. I did however find them SLIGHTLY salty though, so will remember to make them with 1/2 the amount next time. ENJOY! These are FAB cookies!

Great. I couldn't find my favorite recipe and my son wanted to take them to scouts. Was excited to find yours - it's the same one. We left out the nuts and cooked at 350. Thanks!!

Certainly not a bad cookie, they don't come close to making 4 dozen (but then they never seem to make as many as the recipe says either), I made mine about a teaspoon size and they came out the size of a half dollar and barely scraped up 3 dozen. As for the taste, they are a chewy kind of cookie, but they would be better with some extra spices (they are somewhat bland). If I make this again I'll be adding some cinnamon and prolly some nutmeg.

These cookies were AWESOME.  I did add 1tsp cinnamon and a few extra raisins.  The first batch that I made the cookies turned out small but the rest I rolled the dough into a small ball and then flattened it on the cookie sheet and they came out perfect.  Don't flatten them too much, but they were a good size and a nice "hearty" cookie.  I also only cooked these for 10 minutes and they were nice and moist.  Thanks so much, I will defiently make these again!!!

I wanted to try something different, I usually use the recipe on the back of the raisin box.  I wasn't very happy with how this recipe turned out.  I don't know why my cookies turned out odd, maybe I will try this again.

Excellent cookies ! I used 3 teaspoons of vanilla and I used coarse sea salt. I also decreased the baking time to 9 mins to ensure a chewy cookie !

The texture on these were great. The flavor came out more after a few hours. I just thought the crisco made them a bit greasy. I  added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg (that was a plus). I would definitely make them again. I originally needed to find an oatmeal cookie without dairy that my lactose intolerant son can enjoy.....and he has been enjoying these.

Pretty good cookie recipe, easy too. I would have cooked them longer to make them crispier. I also added raisons and chocolate chips, which it definitely needed. It would have been too boring with just the walnuts.

These cookies are excellent. I used raisins, walnuts, and since it is Christmas I chopped up some candies cherries. They also became my husbands favorite. (Do not overbake) My hat off to you K. Blackburn

Very good recipe.  My wife doesn’t usually like oatmeal cookies, but she couldn’t put these down.  My changes included about a cup of shredded and dried coconut and a tablespoon of molasses.

I'll make these again. They are not too sweet like some of the other oatmeal cookie recipes I've seen/made. I doubled the recipe, and added a cup of raisins. They turned out quite nicely.

First, I'm low on groceries, & due to this no nuts, & butter instead of shortening. I also added cinnamon. The kids LOVE these cookies. Even though I halved the recipe, I got exactly 4 dozen out of this, dropping teaspoonfuls. Cute little chewy cookies. Also, they did not take 12 minutes to cook. Unless you want them crunchy. This was such an easy, tasty recipe, that I am sure we will be making them often!!!
