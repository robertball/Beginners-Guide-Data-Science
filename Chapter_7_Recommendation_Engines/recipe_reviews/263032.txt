I think this is the third review I've done on this recipe. I was out of butter yesterday so I made it with coconut oil. It came out delicious.
I also add half a teaspoon of truvia sweetener, eighth of a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and stir in 1/4 cup of blueberries.

This recipe has changed my life!! After making the original recipe I tried it different ways.  So far I have made this every day. I have covered the batter with seeds(sunflower, sesame  and poppy seed) and used for an open face sloppy joe.  I really wanted something sweet so I added a non-sugar sweetener (monk fruit) and a little vanilla and it was as good as any regular muffin.  Next I plan  on doing it with lemon and poppy seeds and may try with garlic butter. I have also thought this could be used as croutons on a salad (which I really miss!).  I I am not even doing a keto diet-I just wanted to cut back on grains and I do not miss breads at all.  You have to be careful not to over cook (mine usually is  done in less than 90 sec) and it takes less time than making toast or frying an egg and so much healthier. And don't be afraid to really mix the batter well. ( I use a small whisk).  Unlike grain flours that need to be handled gently so the gluten will form, you can just beat the heck out of almond flour.  I find I get different textures depending on how well I mix.  The longer I mix, the more cake-like texture I get.

I decided to try out the keto diet and was looking for recipes of things I knew I would miss. Quick, keto-bread in under 3 minutes (from start to finish)? Sure why not. It definitely did not taste like regular bread, but the texture was just like it. In terms of taste, to me, it was more like a corn-bread (a bit more dry than regular bread). After making it (and being amazed at how it changed from a runny glob to something spongey), I sliced it up and popped the slices in the toaster. Added butter on one piece (was still kind of dry), but added cream cheese to another one. Not bad at all! Definitely helps if you're wanting "toast"

I'm a carbetarian that is trying to make it on Keto. This might just be what saves me. Is it the best bread I've ever had? No, its not but it was 100 times better than I imagined when I saw I could make a low carb bread in 2 mins. Its actually a pretty decent bread.

This was really good, and super easy too! The texture was almost exactly like regular bread. I added a tiny bit of xanthan gum and it was sturdy enough to make thin slices. Thanks for the recipe!

Ok I made this this morning. I am four days on keto and when I tasted it my first thought was wow I miss bread. Then the second bite wow this is kind of like cornbread. ****idea Keto chicken cornbread dressing **** so I doubled the recipe using only one egg and adding 1/4cup chicken broth zero carbs poultry season and chopped chicken. I didn’t have green onions but used dry chives....... yum! Still improving but thank you Baby Jesus!

Needed to complete my review. It’s a different flavor. More egg taste than bread flavor. I cooked 2 min. In microwave, slipped right out of mug. Texture was moist and held together like a bread. Easy but needs some flavoring added to cover up the egg taste and I love eggs. May try sweetener or even more almond flour or toast it and butter it. Won’t make again as recipe is.

I love love love this bread! I have used it for keto grilled ham & cheese and most recently for a keto pizza. It’s fast, easy and delicious. It’s a great alternative to traditional bread when you want a sandwich (or pizza). I personally prefer it grilled or toasted as it gives it a bit more of a “crust”. Thanks for this awesome recipe! I’ll be sharing the heck out of it !!

It’s very good. Very bread like. Nice texture. Firm enough to make a sandwich. Flavour is nice and mild. Good bread substitute for low carb and wheat free people. Will definitely make again!

Very impressed! Popped right out of mug after microwaving. I added a 1/2 tsp of swerve and a dash of cinnamon for more of a French toast flavor. It tasted delicious. Definitely a go to recipe.

I was a little leary, thought it would taste like eggs.  NOT!   It was really good and added substance to my Keto regiment.  I just put some cream cheese on it right out of mug, and it was delicious and really hit the spot.  I plan to make this again and again for burgers, sandwiches, even French toast.

Very easy, but I agree with other reviews. It works well being toasted. The bread is spongy and gives you that "full" feeling. I may try to add a little coconut flour.

First of all, the nutritional data does not add up.  I'd like to see their math on this.  Secondly, it tasted like an egg sandwich.  I suppose with some mayo and ham it would be good.  I'd try it again, but with Tina Dawn's modifications...But someone from AllRecipes needs to explain those nutritional numbers.  They are higher than they should be (Yes, I did the math ingredient by ingredient. But just ballpark it: butter 102 + egg 70 + Flour +212 = 384. The salt and baking powder can't be 24 calories!  And it doesn't absorb all the butter (but it does absorb most of it!)

I made it with home made almond meal as I didn’t have almond flour. It came out great with nooks and crannies like an English muffin. The texture was breadlike and flavor was good. Next time I’ll try some onion or garlic flavoring. There will definitely be a next time. I’m going to try it in the top of my butter dish as I think it will make a good hot dog roll!

closest thing I've had to. bread since ive started keto. Sometimes I switch it up and add coconut oil instead of butter some agave stevia, vanilla, and coco powder and eat it as a morning muffin w/ cream cheese or after dinner cake with whip cream. Great for breakfast sandwiches or add italian herbs and shredded cheese and eat as a side.

Second time trying this. Made a couple changes. I separated my egg and whipped the white into a stiff foam before adding to the dough mixture. I also added about 3 Tbsp of Shredded Monterrey Jack cheese in an attempt to get some gooey-ness. Came out great. I have so many variations I plan to try! This is so easy and makes JUST enough, so it will be my saving grace on this Keto journey

I made this exactly according to the recipe.  Super easy and fast!  I cut it into 4 slices, about the size of a biscuit.  It has a tender crumb, holds together well enough to toast it. We enjoyed it just as is, with some butter.  YUMMY!

So the texture is more cornbread like. Does have a slight eggy taste. For someone giving up bread due to carbs it is great. I made it then toested in my cast iron skillet with some butter and it was yummy. Also I only ate 1/2 and it is really filling. This was so easy and will be a staple for me

Works well for a quick and easy fix. I use it as a "biscuit" for my keto biscuits and gravy. I cut it in half and toasted it and I was pleased with it. I have even used it as a sandwich bread and it works pretty well for that too. Try to use your largest/widest coffee mug for this recipe.

Love this bread! So quick and easy. I agree, toasting it afterwards gives it a nice English Muffin feel. Can't wait to try this recipe with cheese and herbs.

My wife and I both love this.  We use a bowl for a slightly larger area then slice it in half on edge to make two slices.  I mainly use it for grilled cheese or grilled warm sandwiches.  I've never thought this tasted eggy at all after grilling. I brush on some mayo and throw it on a skillet to grill. Browns a little bit and turns out perfect.

One thing I really miss on keto is grilled cheese sandwiches and this with sharp cheddar really hits the spot!  Once I discovered this I made it 3 nights in a row with different meats and cheeses.

I just started a Keto diet few days ago and was trying to figure out how to get my bread fix. I made stew and used this to dip in the juices. I added a little onion powder to the ingredients. Tasted like dumplings was filling and delicious. Thank you so much, I am so busy and this was quick and simple. Can't wait to experiment with this recipe.

One of the things I’ve missed the most on keto, is a toasted English muffin.. while this bread’s texture is more like that of cornbread (although it doesn’t taste like cornbread), it fit the bill nicely. I sliced it into 4 pieces and fried it with butter; served it with Keto buffalo chicken omelette, also on this site. I will definitely be making this again!  I look forward to trying some of the other reviewers additions also. Thanks for this oh-so-easy and tasty recipe!!

i think this recipe as written is more like a pancake because of the eggy taste. Its not bad anyway because i tossed so many things on top that i couldnt taste the egg anymore. I tried it without the yolk (replaced with 1 tbsp milk) and it tastes a lot better but it didnt rise as much as the original recipe. Im making this recipe pretty much everyday now, i leave the whole egg and add sweetner and berries for breakfast or leave the yolk out and use it as an english muffin with savory toppings. It is a lot better if you toast the rounds first. Very good recipe with a lot of potencial for creativity :) .

I’ve Tried this recipe several times. I can’t say it can replace bread for me because I am Obsessed with bread. The texture just isn’t light and fluffy enough,  but being on the keto diet it gets the job done. If you make this bread and then use it for French toast adding cinnamon and sugar free maple syrup it is amazing ! You won’t even be able to tell the difference.

We love it!!!!!  This is a keeper.  Have tried another 90 second mug bread with chia seeds and it had a nasty eggy taste.  Even putting lots of cinnamon in didn't help

I loved the recipe, however, I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and sugar.  The cinnamon and sugar made it taste like authentic French toast.   The cinnamon and sugar was combined in a shaker.  I apologize for devouring it before photographing it.

I am gluten free and make this all the time. Its great for a sausage biscuit. I usually use only egg whites (helps it taste less egg-y) But, today I added a spoonful of pumpkin puree and some pumpkin pie spice and a dash of sweetener. Sliced and toasted, Yummo!!

I used 1/4 cup of coconut flour.  Coconut flour is known to be dense, so my mug bread was a little dry. Solved the situation by adding plenty of butter. It does taste good. Feels like I am cheating on Keto.

Really? I was SO sceptical.  A burger roll in 90 seconds?  I'm so tired of naked burgers!  My boyfriend, who doesn't keto or need to eat gf likes this recipe!  I use a small bowl with a flat bottom for burger rollz!  Quick and convenient!

This is the best keto bread recipe I've tried. I did it in a small Pyrex dish and sliced it in half and toasted it. Will definitely make again as French toast, breakfast sandwich,  English muffin...

Tasted amazing. I added 1/4 tsp of onion powder and garlic powder to cover up egg taste. Did not taste egg. Very flavorful! Will be making this weekly.

I didn't have any almond flour so we used coconut flour instead. It came out flat (like 1 inch high) and hard as a rock. Not sure what happened but we tried twice and the same thing happened both times. It shouldn't make that much difference using coconut flour instead of almond flour.

This tasted nothing like bread to me. I made the recipe exactly as shown. Maybe will try it another time but put it in the toaster oven after getting it out of the mug since he held together well.

A friend of mine made this for me. She adds about 1/4 cup shredded Cheese, garlic salt, and Italian seasoning. After microwaving, she browns it in the skillet which adds great crunch! Yum!

I made this keto bread today! Followed the recipe, but added 1.5 tbsp of cheddar cheese. Also I used sea salt instead of table salt. It turned out SO delicious. Definitely filled my cravings for bread. I even made a burger and used this bread as the bun! Yummy!

I enjoyed the 90 minute keto bread. It was very much like regular bread, since I was missing regular bread on my keto diet. It was very satisfying.  I will make it again and try adding other ingredients to it.

Disclosure: I made it with regular white flour since I'm not keto, was just craving bread. It had a nice dense texture and minimal to no egg flavor so it hit the craving really nicely. Gonna hang onto this one! It would probably rock with some herbs or shredded cheese mixed in too.

Updated review: When I went to make this again, I realized I had reviewed the wrong recipe - one that I had found on an external site. I made this recipe today to update my review. I don't have "blanched" almond flour, only the almond flour sold in bulk at my local co-op, so that's what I used.  No clue whether it was blanched or not.  Maybe that makes a difference.  Anyway, once I'd combined all ingredients in the mug, it was VERY crumbly.  I couldn't imagine it coming together in the microwave, so I added a couple of tablespoons of water to get it to stick together.  The recipe I'd made yesterday that turned out well used only 1 Tablespoon of almond flour.  1/3 of a cup seems to be WAY too much.  I'll likely play around with this, and might try 2 Tablespoons of almond flour, or alternately 2 eggs with the listed amount of flour.  Anyway, after microwaving for 2:10, it was still a little wet, but had a biscuit like texture.  I cut it in half, threw it into a pan with some butter to brown and cook it further, and the result was similar to a biscuit. Ended up being pretty good with some almond butter on it, but it broke into pieces in the pan and looked like a hot mess.

I think 1/3 of a cup of flour is way too much.  I had to add almost 1/4 cup of liquid to this batter.  I chose almond milk.

For such an insanely simple recipe, this really turned out great.  I made the recipe as is and I didn't think it was eggy tasting, but it was dry and I ended up dunking it in some melted butter to help with that.  Great base for a sandwich and I think it would take variations of different sweet or savory ingredients well.  Definitely going to use this recipe again even after I'm off keto for a low carb bread alternative.  I also like that you don't have to make a whole loaf of it!!!  Very good recipe.

I'm so glad I read all of the comments before trying it.  It was so yummy! I'll probably make this several times a week now that I see how easy it is. I made a few small adaptations. 1) added a tablespoon of ricotta cheese 2) 1/2 packet of stevia sweetener 3) omitted a tablespoon of almond flour and added a tablespoon of coconut flour. Very happy with the results. Once cooked, I split the 'bread' in half and toasted in the pan with butter.  Delish.

This is so yummy and totally satisfied my craving for “bread”. I toasted it after I let it rest and it was perfect for my egg and sausage sandwich.

I've  made it 3 times. EASY!! so delicious.  2nd time I added cheese and chopped jalapenos.   Then toasted in toaster oven. I'm so grateful for this recipe.  Low carb  diets are saved with this bread. I do not feel deprived.

I'm absolutely in love with this bread!  It is super filling and very versatile.  I put a little bit of pesto, some shredded fresh parmesan and leftover sauteed veggies on top and it was delicious.  Definitely recommends to any carb addicts like me out there. It was also great for my husband who is type 2 diabetic because there's no added sugar and less carbs than regular bread.  Made me feel better to feed my kids something that was highly processed.

Holy . I was skeptical. But I was playing around with store bought plain almonds and a coffee grinder to make an Atkins breading. I stumbled across this recipe and decided to try it with the almond meal I had just made. SOOOO GOOD!  I will DEFINITELY be making this a LOT!

Wow! I was surprised! I've been on keto for about 6 months now and I do miss bread. This was perfect size, good texture, and quick! Next time I will add some rosemary, or garlic, or anything else I can dream up. Great recipe!

I’m not on a Keto diet, but someone had told me about this bread and I thought I’d try it. It’s super easy and although it’s rather dry, it has a good bread flavor. Oh and, I didn’t have any baking powder so made it without. I’ll have to try it with the baking powder next time.

I  combined dark chocolate powder with a little stevia in this recipe to make brownies. Using egg whites, 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of Stevia will make a white cake also.

Wow! This is really impressive for a super quick recipe.  I was about to run to the store to get some low carb pita bread because I made a TON of tuna salad only to find it was hard for me to get through due to lack of bread.  I tried this and only added about a teaspoon of everything but the bagel seasoning.  So delish!  I bet it would be good as a "muffin" like I have read in other reviews.  This is going to be a keto staple for me.

Great recipe. Made a french toast  version by adding 1/2 tsp of Swerve granulated sugar, 1/8 tsp vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. Then I made a double recipe and increased the cooking time to 2 minutes. Topped with a sifting of Swerve confectioners sugar, it was so good even my kids liked it.

Made it as written except cooked in a small round pyrex container.  Although it does not taste like bread it is WAY better than any GF bread I have had.  It does not stick to your teeth and does not feel like powder after a few chews (which GF breads do).  You can add additional seasonings to give it more flavor.  I cook in a larger container (pyrex) and cut in half.  I have toasted it and eaten untoasted as well.  Usually 1/2 is plenty for a decent sandwich.  This is my go to recipe for a bread substitute.  Thank you for sharing it.

You know, it's not bad! It was really dry but butter will help with that. As I was taking my first bite, dill popped into my brain. Going to keep making it because I need a sandwich. And toast! LOL And Eggs Benedict! Definitely play with it with your tastes. Next up? Cheese bread!

Used untoasted as a hamburger bun. Held together and was better than the no bun option.
Then toasted w butter and sugar free preserves. Yum! Very filling so I won't binge.

This is a great low carb breakfast recipe.  I love toast for breakfast and really miss it when I don’t have it.   I make the bread in a cup, slice it into 4 sections and lightly toast it in a cast iron skillet.  It keeps me on track.  I upped the almond flour to 1/3 cup and omitted the salt, but the recipe as written is great.

I have tried a number of keto mug bread recipes and find many of them too "almondy". I have found a more savoury  combination that works for me, using this one as a starting point. I combine 3 tbsp of almond flour with 1 tbsp of coconut flour, 1 teasp of psyllium husk, 1 tsp of flaxseed meal, 1/4 teasp baking powder, 1 egg, 1 tbsp water and 1 tbsp oil (I use macadamia at the moment because that's what I have). I add a sprinkle of onion powder or some kind of seasoned salt, depending on the flavour I fancy at the time.

Great substitute for regular bread. Next time I will add flavors to make sweet or savory. This is a good base recipe.

I'm new to Keto (day 5 for me) and was pleasantly surprised at this.  I've made it twice now.  Second time I sliced and toasted it and it was good!   Next time I'll try it with cream cheese or as a sandwich.  A good way to fool your tummy (and brain) thinking you're eating bread.  Will definitely make again.

I love this bread with one change...I used a flax egg (1 T flax seed, 2.5 T water that you let sit 5 minutes) which I think is a better texture for our taste. I have also used it with other non AP flours and mixes I made myself such as grounds oats, quinoa and protein powder with great results. I might be eating low carb but that doesn't mean my 4 year old should but I also don't want to keep a whole lot of bread in the house for him.

This was super easy and tasty with an egg, cheese and sausage for breakfast.  I've made several so far.  It's a little greasy so I used 1/2 the butter and grilled the "bun" after slicing it in half.  It turned out fine.

I didn't make any changes.  I really liked the texture and taste.  I felt like I was cheating,; it was actually BREAD!! I toasted it and put butter and sugar free jelly on it.  It was a little "eggy", but I may not have mixed it well enough.

I used a mug about the circumference of a sausage patty.  It would make a nice sausage biscuit.  I have a larger mug that would make it more English muffin size.  This was my first keto bread, but this will be my go-to bread.....quick, easy and very good!

P.S.  It may have needed a little more salt.

I think it need a good size pinch of salt.
Cut beautifully. Took a piece and toasted it in a skillet with melted butter. Wasn't brave enough to try it in my toaster.
I see lots of possibilities with this.

For Keto bread, I found this very good and easy!  It was perfect for my avocado toast.  I will try this again and use some of the suggestions of others to change it up.

I was looking for a replacement for English muffins.  I think this will do.  Tastes great and slices nicely.  I did add a little xanthan gum.  This will make a great muffin just add a little vanilla, blueberries and some sweetener.

It is my go to morning "muffin".  Sometimes I put either strawberries or blueberries in the mix.  I also tried 1/4 teaspoon of  pysllium and it is a little  more bread like. But it really isn't necessary as it adds extra carbs.

I read some of the reviews and came to the conclusion that it would taste eggy. I made it as the recipe stated but once it was done, added cinnamon to the tops of the slices and added pure Maple syrup. I didn't use a lot of syrup. It was delicious!!!!

It was easy and cooked perfectly. It's more of a flavor thing for me. It didn't taste like I wanted it to. But I'm sure my taste buds will come around. Still pretty cool. I'm going to try some different spices with it.

I love this recipe! But honestly I didn't have baking powder the first time and I tried it without. I toasted it and like it better without the baking powder for an egg sandwich and a few other things. This is a keto life saver for me!

Nice! Very simple and quick to prep and cook. The flavor is a lil nutty and the texture kinda reminds me of corn bread muffins. I love it and will make again and again! Next time I plan on adding some bacon and cheese to create breakfast bread in a mug!

OMG game changer. I have done keto before, but never found a bread I was happy with. I made it exactly as it says. It turned out awesome. It tastes just like corn bread. The second time I made it, I added 2 teaspoons monk sugar. Holy Cow, it was awesome too. I made a breakfast sandwich with it. First time I felt satisfied in three days. It was so easy to make. Try it you won’t be sorry!

Excellent texture. I made this 2 times , 1st with the pinch of salt and the 2nd time without. I liked the neutral flavor of the second time better since the baking powder and egg already give it so much flavor already. Will be using this recipe again, sans the salt.

It actually is pretty good and very simple.  The texture is a little getting use to.  I added some garlic powder which gave it a little hint of flavour.  I will make it again

Delicious and so easy to make.  A slice with a pad of butter is perfect.

Great bread option - quick and easy.   when making garlic bread, I add garlic powder.  when making French toast, I add cinnamon and little maple extract.   I also add a 1/2 -1 tsp of monkfruit sweetener.   some turn out different, depending on the size of the mug.   play around -- you will find your fit.  this is a great recipe!

Easiest ever....... 3 min to prepare 90 seconds to cook. Light and fluffy.
( I also ad 1/2 a banana for desert bread, just break up the banana in into the cup with the butter and cook for 24 seconds then add you egg flour salt and baking soda).

A great recipe when missing out on bread on a Keto diet.  The texture reminds me of an English muffin.  Better if toasted.

my variation on an already fantastic recipe.  I add 1 tsp lemon juice (does not alter the flavor).  I melt the butter, using an immersion blender mix in my egg and then baking powder, then lemon juice.  I add the almond flour last.  Cook 90 seconds and it comes out so light and fluffy.  The lemon juice acid combined with the baking powder really helps the flour rise and it holds that rise well.

I followed the advice not to add the salt but found that it needed it.  Also I can taste a little of the baking powder.  I think  adding salted butter to the slice will fix he salt problem.  I wasn't really into the spongy texture.  Not sure if I will make again.

I love this.  I don't eat much bread anyway but a piece of toast now and again is enjoyable.  And my finicky bird loves it as well so I make it for her and add oats, flax seed, sunflower seed, peppers, and she gobbles it up.  It is easy.  My local store sells almond flour which is really almond meal but it works

Very reminiscent of an English Muffin.  I made it as directed and then sliced, toasted, and buttered it.  I was afraid ti would taste rubbery, but it was crisp and delicious, with no aftertaste.  This will curb my bread cravings nicely!

It is great for those on a low carb diet. Taste great with breakfast for either Eggs Benedict or a breakfast sandwich or even add a few blueberries with some extra butter or keto creme.

The texture is a little spongey but I didn’t think it tasted like eggs as many other reviews stated. I think I may have added too much salt, it was very salty. Next time i’ll use less salt. It toasted nicely. I think it’s definitely a decent sub for bread and will definitely make it again. Next time I may even add a little mink fruit sweetener and cinnamon. I’ll update this review with those results.

This is my go-to when I want a quick tasty low carb bread. I added about a tablespoon of Chia-Flax-Hemp Super Seeds mix and a little extra butter and it came out great. After it came out of the microwave I put it in the toaster for a few minutes and then topped it with some cream cheese and sugar-free strawberry preserves. Serious yummmm going on there!

Made exactly as stated... thought it was pretty good! I haven't had bread in 35 days, so I might be a little biased haha. I didn't think it was eggy tasting, but I did add more butter once I sliced it up. Great jumping off and all the other suggestions in the reviews look great!

Use a traditional tea or coffee cup. Mixing was easy. Texture is good. Will do this again. Will probably stand up for an eggs Benedict recipe.

I really like this recipe. I make it in a ramikin and get 4 slices. The only thing I do different is that I mix the dry ingredients with the butter, then add the egg and mix well before cooking for 90 seconds.  I toast the slices for sandwiches.

LOVE IT!  I'm on Keto and I was dying for some "bread".  I tried the original, then made a few more batches with rosemary, another batch with garlic hemp hearts, one with seeds on top.  I also added  a pinch of xanthan gum.  All were amazing!

I made this for the first time today 6/6/2019 and I do think it was more on the spongy side. For it to be Keto bread I don’t think it was bad because i love carbs and it’s hard to let go for me so this was a hit anyways! It was more like a corn bread to me, however I have a loaf pan and will be making a bigger batch with some Xanthan gum and see how that turns out. I would like this with some pork and turnips w hot sauce.

I mixed the dry ingredients together first, then added them to the beaten egg. As another user suggested, I added a tablespoon of heavy cream and beat it into the egg. Adding up the net carbs, which really only applied to the almond flour, I came up with 10 g net per mug. If you slice it into 5 slices, that's 2 g per slice.

Nice texture, tastes really good! Rating 5 stars because it's really fast and easy.

I actually love this bread... I dont think the sodium and the carbs are correct because you are using only 3 tablespoons of flour... one thing I did do is use coconut oil instead of the butter... overall this is my new favorite recipe for some bread... now I will be looking for a recipe for a quick dessert

I’ve been so missing something to put a runny fried egg on! Thank you! This does the trick perfectly and it’s done in a minute and a half! So great when I’m trying to get to work! Tastes great!

I added Splenda and cinnamon to act as a mug cake, but I find it very dry. I cut mine into rounds and topped them with sugar free Maple syrup and peanut butter. The flavor was great, the peanut butter and cinnamon cover up the "eggs in a microwave" taste. I will definitely make again, but next time with frozen blueberries added into the batter to counteract the dryness. (That was my original plan, but I'm out of blueberries.)

Since finding this recipe, I have made this quite a few times. I find adding a tablespoon of heavy cream to the batter makes the bread fluffier. Have also made it with cheese and real bacon bits.

This recipe is life saver! I was feeling really over keto this morning. Not wanting the usual eggs and bacon. Allrecipes and this recipe to the rescue. Followed recipe exactly except for cooking time and this is super satisfying! Only cooked for 60 seconds vs 90 because my microwave seems more powerful than most. Sliced and toasted and put on lots of butter and I am in heaven. Definitely has a corn bread texture. Love it!

I was having trouble with the bread not cooking evenly, so I tried again using my Pampered Chef Egg Cooker...  It turned out so PERFECT!!  I use it for everything.  Thanks for the recipe!

I’ve been on the Keto diet a couple days now and this mug bread felt like heaven to eat!  I can’t believe how fast and easy it is to make.  Comes out nice and fluffy with a great flavor.  I will absolutely be using this recipe regularly,  even when I’m not on the Keto diet anymore!

It's pretty good. Doesn't taste like bread and I put a little too much salt, but it's good together with cream cheese, cucumber and salmon. Probably will do this again, it's super easy and quick too.

This mug bread was awesome! It was very easy to make quick and it did well for my burgers. It will be a great addition to my keto regime. I wonder if using coconut flour would help it not to break? To be fair I stuffed a burger bacon onions lettuce pickles in between those slices.  it didn't stand a chance!

Adequate at best...  This mug bread fills the role of "fake" bread but it has little taste, lots of calories and uses 1/2 my daily carb. allotment.  For me, it's just not worth the expenditure but for someone who has to have something to fill the bread role, I'm guessing it would be fine.

It's fantastic and ready in a pinch!  If you use a large mug, you can get a hamburger/English muffin type bun.  Kind of the texture of cornbread.  Essential to have this recipe if you're GF.

I've made this several times now, with and without 1 tsp of xantham gum. I'm still not sure if that makes a big difference so it's definitely optional.
I cook the bread for  90 seconds, but then I flip the bread in the mug to cook the bottom, as I find it is a bit moist and I like it firmer. I cook it for an additional 20 seconds.
I can get 3 or 4 slices. I like to top the slices with grated cheddar cheese and some kind of meat like breakfast sausage, then a little more cheese, and microwave about 20 secs until the cheese is gooey.
I recently tried a couple slices of polish sausage with cheddar cheese, and it reminded me strongly of a corndog! So I had to go get the mustard. Yum!
I have also cooked it in a bowl, and left the bread in the bowl as a base for meat  & gravy, a little sour cream.  I enjoyed that also.
Easy to fix and satisfying. Nice one!

I've made this several times now. I've made it as stated, and a sweet version (added cinnamon and sweetener) and a savory version (added Italian seasoning) and it all turned out great. The bread is dense enough to easily slice in half and toast. I really like it toasted with butter.

I added a tiny dash of xanthan gum, used coconut oil, and added some dried rosemary. I used a regular bowl instead of a mug so it would spread out a little more. I split the bread into two slices and followed the suggestions to toast it. I feel like I just conquered the world. I'm trying to follow a strict candida diet and this is the first piece of bread I've had in over a month!! I told myself it was rosemary focaccia bread :) I put a fried egg and a little hot sauce on it voila, keto/candida breakfast sandwich

Followed the recipe except I doubled it and it turned out great!  I used a small Corning French white baking dish ~ 5” diameter, and I microwaved a little longer than 90 sec, I used 120 sec or 2 minutes because I had the extra batter.  I didn’t know if 90 would be enough, 120 definitely wasn’t too much.

This seems too good to be true, but it is not.  This actually bread-like and very tasty.  I toasted and buttered these slices and ate them with eggs.  Delicious.  I plan to experiment with other ways to use this basic easy recipe.

I found this recipe and I was so excited to try it!!! 2 out of 5 of my siblings started a keto diet and they were so jealous whenever we ate somehing they couldn't have. My other siblings actually wanted to snatch this out of their hands! They were amazed at how quickly it rises in the microwave. I actually used a wide-mouthed jar instead of a mug. It takes about 9 minutes overall. Made 4 batches for egg-mcmuffins. Tasted good with other stuff in it. I would have done 5 stars, it just tastes a little, um, eggy. We don't really like the eggy taste. Could probably use flax seed and water to sub it. I also am going to try making different variations. Maybe something sweet. Cinnamon raisin, lemon poppyseed, and, honey. I used half a tablespoon of butter. Thanks for this recipe!

Loved the base recipe so much I adapted it to make lemon “pound cake” by adding vanilla and lemon extract, and 1 T erthyritol for sweetener. So good with fresh berries and whipped cream!

After reading other reviews, I knew not to expect a regular bread look and taste. I needed a base for a pizza bun recipe, so made this recipe,  cooled it, then cut it into several slices and toasted it before putting the filling on and baking it. Thanks for a quick solution for  the situation!

My go to recipe for quick bread fix.  I sub egg whites and it tastes less like egg.  Great to make french toast with and I have also used it in making eggs benedict, making my own hollandaise of course.  Kids favorite is breakfast sandwiches using this bread.

1st time:  made the recipe as printed.  Ingredients were basic, instructions clear, quick and easy.  Not quite like store bought soft bread, but who wants that anyway?  I toasted five rounds and buttered the first one.  Yum.  The remainder were served with chicken salad.  It's a great breadish carrier for chicken salad.  I can't wait to try all the variations.

I was out of almond flour and tried coconut flour. I'm not sure if that's the reason but it came out dry, I mean fall apart crumbly dry. I'll be trying it again with the almond flour.

Grilled. Cheese. Sandwich. 
This "bread" really sops up the butter, grilling it is the best way to eat it.

I have made this several times as written and it was very good. I've made it a few times adding a touch of vanilla and a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. Delicious for breakfast, especially with a little cream cheese.

Super easy. I expected it to taste like eggs but it didn't. It did smell eggy. But I absolutely loved it. Sliced and toasted and put some butter on it. I did add a little shredded cheddar to it prior to cooking and increased time by 15 seconds. So delicious! Thank you!

Did it look like bread - yes. 
Did it have the texture of bread - yes
Was it easy  and quick - yes
Did it smell good - it was ok
Did it taste good - not to me. Very grainy and like over cooked eggs. No flavor even though I put in garlic powder. Even tried to toast it with butter and still couldn't swallow it. Weird consistency and flavor.

actually worked!  I sliced and will use rounds for smaller pieces of small open face bread sandwiches or PERFECT for homemade egg, sausage, & cheese sandwhiches!  

cut lengthwise in half for more like a oblong roll for sandwiches or whatever.  :) 

does have a strong egg taste

I'm not clear if whole thing is 1 serving or not???

I made this exactly as the recipe says as part of my Keto Break fast.  I was pleasantly surprised with the taste and ease of preparation.  I am not a fan of all the eggs...scrambled, deviled, etc. that are prevalent  in the Keto diet.  This recipe makes a nice alternative for me.  It also seems versatile enough to make savory and sweet changes to it.

I’d give this TEN stars if I could!! After I sliced it, I put it in the toaster for a bit and made breakfast sandwiches out of it. As a baby Keto-er (so I still have my non-Keto taste buds ??), I seriously couldn’t tell I wasn’t eating a biscuit! Same flavor and texture - SUPER WIN!!!

Taste = fair to good.  I really shouldn't have expected a bread taste, but I did, and it doesn't taste like break, more like an egg muffin

Texture - as above, I expected bread, but it's not bread.  It was sort of like a souffle in texture.

What would I adjust, maybe a 1/2t of sugar to sweeten it a little (yes, I realize that's not keto, but who says keto needs to be bland)

My grandson has several food restrictions including Gluten and Dairy so I'm always on the lookout for things that don't include them.  Breads have always been a difficult thing as it's hard to find them in stores and I don't always have time to bake something.   THIS has become our go-to when he's visiting.  I use coconut oil to coat the inside of a microwave-safe mug rather than butter.   It's great as is with any spreads or sandwich fixings.

I have made it several times in just a couple of days, and today I taught my teenage son to make it. It was perfect every time and I have already memorized the recipe. This will definitely be a staple in our house! I did not make any changes.

Super easy and great for making little open face egg salad sandwich. Really you could put anything you wanted on top because it doesn’t have much of any flavor on it’s own. Tried the first slice with just butter but was pretty bland. However, the consistency was like regular bread and it was easily sliced. All in all I think it’s a keeper!

This recipe was very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly.  It is more like a corn bread feel with the gritty.   It does taste better toasted then not. Taste wise it wasn’t bad and it was filling. I had half with cream cheese toasted.  I will try it again as a bun.

I like it. It is fast.  easy to make. Very filling, a good substitute to bread. A bit of eggy taste. Texture is like a sponge cake. To me it tasted like an unsweetened sponge cake. But  it was a good option for breakfast for these days that i didn't want to eat eggs.

I made mine exactly as recipe called for. Easy, delicious, might have to retire my Zojirushi. Thank you for sharing this. I think I’ll make a bunch in a jar for ease of time and not have to mix ingredients every time. Just heavenly

Made this with a flax, chia, hemp seed powder instead of almond flour, and while it looked super wierd, tasted ok.  Going  to experiment, maybe add a pinch of salt.  Threw it in the toaster right after the microwave and it went from omelette consistency to a firm-ish bread like substance.  Once I slathered butter on it, it was pretty darn acceptable

It is a good bread substitute and I love all of the recommendations other reviewers have given. It is dry, but we plan to serve with keto chili. A good bread-like option that doesn't taste like eggs or cheese! yay!

Added 1tsp grated Asiago cheese w/ rosemary and topped with sesame seeds. Made a great turkey burger w/cucumber and a little ground mustard. My hubby loved it toasted with cream cheese. Will make it for breakfast tomorrow.

I saw this recipe in a forum that I belong to.  I miss bread, so I welcomed the chance to eat something similar to bread.  It comes out looking like a McMuffin.  The bread is dense, and tastes almost like cornbread.  I lather on the butter and eat it with a scrambled egg and a turkey pattie.  You have to follow the directions to a T.

I thought this was really close to bread will definitely make it again. I plan on add something else to it for more flavor but I'm not sure what that is yet.  This reminds of of cornbread or hoe-cake texture.

Don't like to use the microwave for cooking, but in a pinch, I do it.  Bread has a good texture, but is damp on the outside.  I sliced it and pan fried it, then slathered with butter; like toast.  When you're in a hurry for bread with soup, it works!

Thank you for sharing this recipe! I’m doing low carb diet and have been eating sandwiches with lettuce as the bread. It’s good, but wanted bread! This sure did the trick! I will be using this recipe at least a couple times a week!

I liked the first one so much that I made 2 more, one for a friend at work. Both thought it was great, but she was expecting a sweeter bread.
Needed to adjust the microwave time and level, but it worked out great. 
Making another one this afternoon!!!

Just 8 days into my Keto Journey and absolutely love having so many great resources as I'm transitioning to little to no carbs
(20 or less per day).
This  recipe is awesome because its very easy, very quick & really helps with cravings for bread. I made it exactly as suggested and it was nice to have with my egg scramble after breaking my 16hr fast.
The great thing is I only ate half toasted with butter and it was plenty - so I have the other half to pair with meal 1 tomorrow.
Thank you for this recipe!!

I really like it .  Two toasted slices with a wedge of laughing cow make a really reasonable low carb meal.  Great texture.  It doesn’t exactly rise like bread so if the batter is lopsided in your cup or has big air pockets that’s how it will come out.  Slices store well in the fridge.  I just toast two at a  time.

I liked this keto bread.  It slices nicely, toasts up well, doesn't overpower toppings, is very quick and easy.  I'm thinking that this recipe will easily accept additions to change it up once in awhile...cinnamon bread, herbs, lemon, maybe french toast.  No, it's not like real bread, but a great substitute for keto dieters...you can have the real stuff on your off day.

I am pouring  heated berries with 1 packet of splenda over it to counter the dryness. I think if you added some sweetener and some type of liquid it makes a better dessert.

Quick and easy to make, it works and keeps me full. I have this as my lunch with bullet proof coffee.
