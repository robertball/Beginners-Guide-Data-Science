What I left out is that I take the remaining sauce and heat it up in a sauce pan until full boil. Then, I drizzle the sauce over the meat when I'm done baking it! The sauce is also great over white rice, as a side.    Also, because it's summer, we've been grilling them instead and that has made a huge difference in the glaze, perhaps because of the heat. We've taken them to many tailgating parties and barbeques and they have been very popular!

While these were flavorful, the liquid never turned into a glaze; probably 1/2 cup instead a full cup of soy sauce should have been used.

My boyfriend and I thought this was really great.  I used less brown sugar, about 1.5 cups.  Very very tasty!

To get thicker sauce try Dark karo syrup and touch of honey and you can use potato starch to thicken also.  Corn Starch 2nd best if you don't have potato starch.

Loved the flavor but even using cornstarch, it didn't get as thick as I'd like.  
HOWEVER... I added crushed red pepper flakes and served with rice w/ green and red peppers it was excellent!  I think baking it longer would have been better too...we always get our pork chops cut 1 1/2 " thick but didn't have the time to do that.  Will definitely make this again!

I really enjoyed these - I thought they had incredible flavor, not too salty and not dry at all - I will make these all the time.  I did these in the oven as suggested by the recipe but will also put them on the grill - I think they are amazing.

We loved this recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I put the chops in a ziplock bag and poured enough sauce over them to be able to marinade them for added flavor.  I also found that after mixing the sauce ingredients I found the Soy sauce a bit over whelming.  So I added about 1 1/2 Tbs of white balsamic vinegar which made it excellent!  I padded dry the chops then seared them in a hot skillet until browned then placed in a glass dish and placed in a 305 degree oven (yes, low heat 305 degrees)  I baked approx 45 min. Basting a few times during cooking.  And until temp was correct.  Then turned on the broiler to thicken the sauce onto the chops.  My chops were 1 inch thick.  They were so tender and flavorful!  My husband absolutely loved them. And I have a bit of sauce left over to do a steak or two!

Great flavor but recipe produced way too much glaze.  The pork chops were floating in it as they baked and it never thickened up like I thought it would.  It was very watery and I had expected it to caramelize.  Didn't happen.

4 of the 5 family members liked this. I personally felt it needed a bit more flavoring, but it was still good.

Pretty good dish to me. The only thing I didn't like was it did not glaze like I thought it would. I basted the chops halfway through cooking and again at the end while they rested. Nevertheless I'll probably make this again.

I did skimp a bit on the brown sugar, however if you do, skimp on the soy sauce as well. Otherwise It could be a bit salty.  I also added 2 teaspoons of corn starch and cooked in uncovered for the last 20 min  The sauce came out perfect.  Very good.  I'll  will make this again, maybe with a touch of garlic or ginger with green onion.

It was a tasty dish but the sauce was far far too much. It did not evaporate enough to form a sticky glaze. Try 1/4 the recipe for 4 chops.

Fairly straightforward recipe. As with others I used no more than half of than the recommended amount of soy sauce, and also a little less than the recommended amount of brown sugar. The sauce did not glaze but would be delightful on rice. We will make this again.

The flavor on these was fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly and I love the taste the sauce gives.  I had the same problem as other reviewers with it not thickening or glazing, so I'll play around with that the next time I make these, but there will definitely be a next time!

I can't wait to try these on the grill!

I made these last night. There was WAY too much sauce. I put half in with the pork chops to bake them in, then put the other half in a pan on the stove to reduce it with cornstarch. I ended up with tons leftover, so I'm not happy. That being said, these were pretty good. I reduced the amount of sugar to a cup and a half and added sriracha and garlic and baked for 30 minutes. I recommend halving the sauce ingredients to avoid waste.

followed the recipe to the T. My husband and I didn't care for it. Wasn't horrible but I definitely wont make it again.
