This is an amazing recipe.  I knew that coconut flour was good, but this proved it all over again.  I found that the recipe barely made 10 medium sized cupcakes and I used apricot jam instead of raspberry, but it would be good with any flavor jam or jelly. My rating is on flavor.  Next time I will double the recipe, they were that tasty.

I really liked these but my kids thought they were "okay".  I made again but used pumpkin, instead of applesauce, coconut sugar instead of honey, and added 2 tsps of pumpkin pie spice.  I liked them even more this way, and my kids gave better reviews, too.  I used all-fruit raspberry spread the first time, and apricot jelly the second.  I think the all-fruit spread is better as it is thicker and I like the idea of the jelly center better than swirling it through the muffin.

This is a great recipe! I had agave instead of honey, and had no jam to add, but it still came out great! Thanks for a paleo breakfast.

So so yummy!  I didn't have any applesauce so I used a banana. Put some whipped cream cheese on one for my daughters (6&10) - they loved me!

These are so yummy but I agree with the other comments. It didn't make all 12 but I won't be upset to double it :)

I substituted a banana for the applesauce and honey and added 2 squirts of liquid stevia and they were great!

My family does not like the taste of coconut flour and have not liked anything I've made using coconut flour. I keep trying, though, because I want to use up this bag of coconut flour that I bought! I agree with Arnie that it needs way more flour. I didn't use any of the almond milk because it was already too soft. We didn't think the bites without jam were sweet enough. I used liners and the cupcakes stuck really bad to the liner. I may actually make these again, using 1/2 C of regular flour along with the 1/2 C of coconut, more jam per cupcake, and no liners. I'll update if I do.

Loved! I used a banana instead of egg and they turned out just fine, texture wise and flavor wise. I used a cold pressed organic coconut oil so the coconut flavor really shined. The cherry and raspberry preserve I used really complimented the coconut taste and added a bit more sweetness.

The whole family loved these. I didn't have applesauce so I substituted pumpkin and used homemade seedless blackberry jam. They were Delicious!
