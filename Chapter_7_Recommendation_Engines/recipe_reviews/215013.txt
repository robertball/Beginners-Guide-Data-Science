This was pretty good. With all the lovely fresh veggies around this was a great way getting hubby to eat fish (that isn't fried) because he loves pineapplel and mango.   The fish was pretty plain so I added some smoked paprika before I grilled it.  As for the salsa - I liked the balsamic in the salsa - hubby did not care for it.  I think he thought it would have a terriyaki flavor with the pineapple and mango.  Thanks for an inspiring recipe.

I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder to the fish before pan-frying. None of my family likes the tomatoes in what we called the "fruit salad." So they will be left off the next time.

Variation on a theme — used homemade market fresh pineapple base mango salsa, coated fish in spices and cornmeal prior to frying — super delicious

I loved the flavours in the salsa mix!  I did not use the rice as a bed, only the salsa for the tilapia bed.  It was absolutely delicious with all the different flavours!

Made this following recipe to a tee. No one wanted to eat it. too much vinegar and fish tasted flavorless.
