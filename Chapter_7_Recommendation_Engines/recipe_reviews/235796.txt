What can I say...This was DELICIOUS! So simple to make and waaaaay better tasting than the box stuff. Because I decided to make this on a whim, I didn't have any vermicelli, so I subbed orzo, and that worked out fine. This is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks, SHORECOOK, for sharing another winner! :)

Hey, SHORECOOK, you'll never believe what I did to your wonderful recipe!  I made it as directed using a basmati brown rice mixture.  Then I added a touch of salt and pepper, a can of tuna (yes, I said tuna fish--from Costco), and just a very small amount of mayo.  It was wonderful!  So I made your side dish into a main dish that way, and I've already been told to make it again that very same way.  Who knew?!  I loved the smell of the rice cooking because it took me way back in all those years when we first started using Rice A Roni!  Thanks so much!

I followed the recipe but used a skillet to make it.  The seasoning is perfect.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I will make this again.

I love this recipe and have used it since my kids were very young and I didn't have ricearoni on hand! I think they were addicted! The only change I make is that I use chicken stock or beef stock rather than cubes, too salty for our taste.

This an easy recipe to make.  I did not have the chicken bouillon granules so I replaced with chicken bouillon powder. I also used freshly chopped parsley. It seemed to be a little bland so I sprinkled with tajin clasico seasoning.

Yum! Made this for dinner, and it was really good.  I used orzo, as  I didn't have any vermicelli pasta.  Also, I did not have bouillon granules, only cubes.  So I used two cubes.  Loved this, it was easy to make, and tasted just like Rice-A-Roni.

Excellent rice dish! Shorecook, I never buy the Rice a Roni because it has soy in it. My family loves rice and this was a keeper. My son had two heaping servings and my husband remarked the rice was really good.

Cooked this in our dutch oven last night and it turned out better than I expected. Surprisingly Easy, for a weeknight side...The only thing I might do next time is just up the spices a bit.

I was disappointed in this until I went back and reread the directions.  they call for 1 tablespoon of chicken bullion and I only used a teaspoon.  Rooky mistake and I know better!  I'm going to make it again because it seemed like it would've been really great had I followed the directions properly.

This turned out great. I added some extra of every seasoning and a little turmeric. Easy to make vegan. My husband loved it.

Needs a bit of improvement, I added chicken and green beans but the flavor is still pretty bland. Will make improvements and share when I'm done.

It was pretty bland (my boyfriend & I like food with lots of flavor) but  I think I can work with it and season it up a little more next time.  I ended up adding some broccoli and a little cheddar cheese and it was tasty. 
I like the basic idea of the recipe and it did taste like a watered-down version of rice a roni so I think that extra spices next time will do the trick. Thanks for the recipe! I've been trying to cut down on processed foods.

In the words of my 9 year old: "This isn't as good as Rice A Roni, this is better!" And my kid is SUPER picky. If I want to make it healthier, I use brown rice and I just do an extra 1/4 cup brown rice instead of the pasta. For the chicken bouillon I pop three cubes in and viola... perfection!

My family loved this! I used chicken stock in place of the water since we don't have bouillon cubes on hand. Also finished seasoning it before serving with some garlic salt.

We haven't had this in awhile because the boxed version has soy. I used chicken broth and added a few extra seasonings. It came out amazing!

I made it with half vegetable broth and half water instead of all water. Topped with fresh chopped basil and cilantro. Delicious!

Thanks for the recipe Shorecook! I had to exercise patience waiting 25 minutes for it to finish because it just smelled that good. I made this with ground turkey (cooked separately and mixed in when the rice/pasta was done). The only substitution made was instead of 3 cups water, I used 2 cups chicken broth (needed to use up the rest of a box of broth) and 1 cup water plus 1 bouillon cube. If anyone chooses to use chicken broth in place of the water with bouillon cubes, please make sure to add some salt which would normally be in the bouillon. Also, I used ¼ cup Barilla Gluten Free Spaghetti (broken up as recipe instructs). End result of this recipe is delicious and much healthier than the boxed stuff! It’s easy to make and you could easily substitute the chicken bouillon with beef or vegetable bouillon.

I will definitely make this again. I didn't have chicken bouillon so I used beef instead. Next time I will use at least a cup of vermicelli noodles. 1/4 cup I found wasn't enough. I used other rice as the bed for my Atlantic salmon and my fiancée loved it. Thanks for the recipe

I have done this for method of many, many years.  I doctor up the spices according to what we having for main entree.  My favorite recipe is to make a lemon/kalamata olive/feta chicken dish and when the rice is ready to serve add a bit of lemon zest and a squeeze of lemon--top of each serving with a bit of feta.
