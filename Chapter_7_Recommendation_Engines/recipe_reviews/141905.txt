I was researching the Mediterranean Diet and was looking for some inspiration, this was a very tasty first start. I did feel it was a little bland on it's own  and my husband asked what made it different than mashed potatoes? So after boiling 5 small Yukon potatoes in heavily salted water, I pureed in garlic, lemon juice, Parmesan cheese, dried oregano, and plenty of good olive oil. We enjoyed it spread on a crusty baguette slices with a nice dry red wine. I also spread leftovers on toast this morning - delish!

nice and simple, thx. 
just like mother used to make and serve with battered cod filets.

i was wondering if we could speed things up by using a good quality mash potatoes mix instead.

I tried to recreate skordalia I had at an excellent Greek restaurant in Astoria, NY, but I was sorely disappointed. None of the flavors seem to blend together to make a cohesive, good-tasting skordalia. I followed the recipe to a T.

I added one small, cooked and pureed beetroot to it. The blandness is gone, and it has a lovely color!

Nice, tasty and easy. If you put in less garlic you can also serve it as mashed potatoes :)

Easy too make - I held back on the vinegar and oil, made to taste
