Yep it takes exactly like the black cookie part of an Oreo. Thanks a million. Make sure to spread it out very thin or else the center will be soft and the edges will be hard. Or break the mixture into cookie size drops so it all cooks uniformly. M

Wow these cookie crumbs are delicious! Taste just like the real thing and so easy to make. I will freeze whatever I don't need today. That way whenever I need them I don't have to run to the market and buy Oreo cookies. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great and easy recipe. I wasn't sure how it would workout with my no bake truffles but they are out of this world. After my cakes cooled completely I started to break them up by hand which was working fine but them I just put them in my food processor gave it a couple of pluses and done. Beautiful dark chocolate crumbs. I will always use this recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I made them gluten free for the bottom of a cheesecake and they were a huge hit for the cheesecake - will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks!

My son is allergic to soy which is in Oreo's. I used this recipe to make a chocolate crust for the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. It was totally the bomb! I use this as my go-to substitute for Oreos.
