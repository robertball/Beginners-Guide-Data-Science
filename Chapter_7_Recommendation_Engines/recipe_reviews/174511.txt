Yummmo!  I am making a batch right now and it is tasty.  I did make my own Arrabbiata sauce (recipe on this site), 'cos I didn't want to wait until I went grocery shopping to try this recipe.

Delicious! I made my own Arrabiata sauce, and used dried parsley because I didn't have any fresh. Still delicious!!

This was great, but it makes WAY more than 8 servings!!  Cut in half it might make that much~ I used a less spicy sauce than the Arrabbiata for my group--just a red pepper marinara--and was still yummy!
