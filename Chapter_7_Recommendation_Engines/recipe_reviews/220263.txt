Followed this recipe to the letter and wouldn't change a thing.  Cooked perfectly at 40 minutes, asparagus didn't turn to mush, and the Canadian bacon really shines.  Didn't take the photo with the hollandaise sauce but served it with Quick and Easy Hollandaise Sauce in the Microwave from this site.  Little extra effort involved than with many quiches, but it was time well spent.  Very nice.

This was absolutely delicious! I think the next time I make it, I'll either omit the bisquick or cut it down by 1/2. The bisquick makes it more cake-like than custardy, but still a fantastic, wonderfully flavored quiche! Rave reviews this morning from my friends! The I used Aunt Penny's Hollandaise (with a little added lemon for more tang)...definitely a MUST!

I love this recipe! It's so easy.  I've made it for Mother's Day brunch and Christmas morning, and it would be perfect for any weekend morning.  Each and every time it's delicious. I served Knorr's Hollandaise on the side.

Did not change a thing and it was delicious "as is".  Sauce was not used but probably would not use it in the future.  Shared it with a recuperating friend and it received high marks!

Loved this dish and it pleased seven adults.  We did use asparagus but added some broccoli and a handful of chopped kale.  Also, used hashbrowns as the shell, used a oblong pan and just cooked them in the pan for about 15 minutes before adding the other layers.  Also, used more eggs because we had to use them up.  Glad we did.  We did use Canadian Bacon but really chopped ham or bacon would have worked too.  Definitely will make this again since it was easy and satisfied.

I added mushrooms. This was really good. Not too much of a fan of the Canadian bacon so will probably use a different meat next time. Tasted so good. Thank you

Used this recipe for brunch today using our first asparagus we harvested from the garden this year. It was delicious! Made my own biscuit mix (from this site). Added to my favs list. This recipe is a keeper!

I made this using what I had on hand, which was whole milk and fresh spinach rather than the cream and asparagus, and no meat. It was delicious. I will definitely make it as written also, but this can be used as a base quiche recipe with various changes. I feel like I don't need any other quiche recipe now.
