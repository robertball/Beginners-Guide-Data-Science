Best bread pudding I've ever made!!  I did not use the cheese and also I didn't cook it until a tooth pick came out clean.  I think it settles down once it is cooled.  I probably cooked it too long until I realized the toothpick was never going to come out clean and it doesn't need to.  The 35 minutes is enough time whether the toothpick is still smeared  or not.
