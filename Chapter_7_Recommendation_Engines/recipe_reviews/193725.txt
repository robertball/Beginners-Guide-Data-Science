Moist, tender chicken, but I gave this four stars because it seems to be missing something. I might try marinating the chicken in italian dressing first, or adding some minced garlic to the egg wash.

I've made this a few times and each time it seemed as though it was missing something. So instead of using the egg, I cut the chicken into strips, and dipped it into honey mustard before I dipped it into the french onions...and that was great! Oh yeah I've also tried it with some Sweet and Spicy mustard as well

This recipie was very easy to make and tasted ok. However, I was surprised how greasy the fried onions were after they were baked.  I've never used or eaten them before and there was a LOT of grease in the bottom of the pan. Also, I found the breading didn't stick to the chicken that well. My husband and I like to eat low fat so I doubt I'll be cooking this recipie again.  I suppose if fat isn't an issue then this recipie would be fine.

This was pretty darn good and super easy.  It needed a little salt in my opinion, but it was great overall.

My husband and I tried this for the first time last night. It was good, but make sure to crush up the onions all the way.

we really like this recipe.  BUT, here is what will take it over the top - immediately after removing from the oven, top each breast with a slice of mozzarella cheese and let it melt.  Something about the combination of the crunchy onions and gooey cheese...mmmm!

This is my 3rd time making it. The first time the children loved it but we used chicken thighs (which I dislike) because hubby bought the wrong pack of meat. I found during that trial that although it was good it needed something. 2nd time I made it I used breasts and cooked it according to the recipe, I just salted the chicken before coating in the egg wash. Good, but not great. This final time I decided to be a little more gourmet. I added pan searing flour to the onions instead of plain (has white pepper and salt added in) as well as 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese. I salted, peppered, and added a sprinkle of garlic powder to the chicken, and I added black pepper to the egg wash. I cooked 20 minutes in the oven and held my breath as the family took their first bites. In short? FANTASTIC!!! BEST CHICKEN EVER and I will make again soon... because the family is already demanding an encore!

Perfect combo of flavor and crunch! I add a little worchestershire sauce and garlic to the egg, though to give the chicken a little extra punch of flavor!

I have made this several times & everytime I change it up a little, until now, I finally got it Perfect!--instead of using the egg, cut the chicken into strips, & dip it into honey mustard before I dipped it into the french onions (cutting chicken into strips makes it so much easier to coat them & the honey mustard adds the best flavour!) --after removing from the oven, top each breast w/a slice of mozzarella cheese & let it melt.  -- added pan searing flour to the onions instead of plain (has white pepper and salt added in) as well as 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese. I salted, peppered, & added a sprinkle of garlic powder to the chicken, and I added black pepper to the egg wash. I continue to make this & always double the recipe.

Love this recipe, we've made it quite a few times but then we used BBQ sauce instead of the egg/flour and it was just the zip the chicken needed.

Love this r√©cipe!! I've made it a couple times, the first time for the boyfriend who loves chicken but never had it this way and he loved it as well. I seasoned each side with accent salt, cayenne pepper, onion powder and flakes (very little and only  on one side), garlic powder, fresh ground  pepper medley, Durkees Chicken & Fish seasoning and a little table salt. I also used more frenchs [original, I dont like sharp flavors on my chicken such as cheddar or parm] than called for. I baked in a nonstick with a thin layer of butter, flipping half way through cooking  time so the onions didn't burn. Juicy, moist chicken, even the second day. Onions fall off but no problem scooping up to eat. They also lose a little crunch after being reheated but still delish!!

This was a great recipe! Really good, quick and easy to make. I did sprinkle some garlic powder on the chicken before dunking it in the egg wash. I had eaten something similar to this before and remembered it tasting a little bland. Adding the garlic powder REALLY helped the taste! Very moist too!

Simple and delicious!  I added a little bit of salt into the flour/crunchy onion mix and some tabasco into the egg.  I think I could have added way more tabasco (I like things spicy!) because I could barely taste any spice.  But all in all the chicken turned out juicy and very tender.  A definite keeper!

I love the flavor the onions give the chicken and it's easy to make. I will say that I did have a hard time getting the onions to stay on the chicken.

I could eat this every day of the week! Better with the original onions than the cheddar, but that's just a matter of personal taste. Super quick & easy - make smaller tenderloin portions and they're great to use on salads.

This was really good... and just as good as leftovers.  The only thing I'll change next time is to try to put them on some paper towels when they come out of the oven to soak up a little grease from the onions.  Otherwise, really good and very simple to make in a pinch!

I actually found this in a copy of Parents magazine. I added paprika garlic salt pepper and parsley to the egg mixture. You def have to crush the onions well, but i have a 3 yr old that barely will eat any meat like thing. That being said all three kids devoured it. My husband and I love it too!

It was just okay.  I replaced the "egg" with dijon mustard for kick.  This house doesn't do bland.  My husband enjoyed the crunchiness of the coating but all in all I would say this recipe was just average.  Sorry.

this was a good recipe overall,i did not have enough french's onion for my 4 chicken breast,i did marinate the chicken over night, which is why the chicken seemed to be a bit dry, i would suggest to cut the cooking time by 10 min. if you marinate your chicken and let it rest for 5 or 10 min.

These were pretty good.  Next time I may use more than two cups of the french's crunchy onions...I don't think there was enough on the chicken breasts.  I had to add a lot of salt and pepper since the crunchy onions weren't enough to give it much flavor.  This was still a pretty good recipe, though.  Thank you. :)

We have this quite often. Chicken stays very moist! Try mixing small amount of parmesan cheese with onion mix before coating.

We love this meal. I cut the breasts in half, they cook quicker that way. I also add salt and pepper to the onion and flour mixture.
