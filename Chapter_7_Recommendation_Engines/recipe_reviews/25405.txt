Delicious! We loved this recipe.  I omitted the sage and celery like other reviewers and added a can of creamed corn.  It was to die for!  Everyone in the family enjoyed this very moist main dish.

I have made this recipe many times, as my husband is a huge corn dog fan, however, I have never added the onion or the celery.  It tastes just like a corn dog without the onion and celery, so you may want to try foregoing those two ingredients. Also, this is a great recipe to serve on football Sunday along with some chili!  :)

This was good, but I probably won't make it too often.  After reading the reviews, I made some changes and was pleased with the product.  I did not add the sage, I used 1/2 shredded cheese and 1/2 velveeta, and cut the hot dogs into 1/4 inch rings which made the hot dogs go farther.  I also halved the recipe and it made a 9x9 inch pan.  In a previous post there was a question as to why the celery.  Mystery solved!  After my second bite of this casserole, the light bulb went on and if I had added the sage, this product would have been more of a corn bread dressing with hot dogs.  Glad I left the sage out.  My husband and I like this casserole anyway and had second helpings.

This was wonderful!  The only changes that I made was to use only 2/3 cup milk and add a can of creamed corn.  I think next time I am going to make these into muffins so I can keep them for quick snacks for my kids.

I have made this three times. First time by the recipe. Second time I substituted yellow onions. We preferred them, over the green onions. This time I substituted some american cheese for the cheddar-I use sharp cheddar. This turned out good with both cheeses.

Very easy and fun recipe.  Even if the celery sounds unusual, leave it in for the moisture.  My family likes it very much, and you can even put mustard or ketchup on top.  I have also baked it on top of hot chili, and that turned out very good too. I use chili powder rather than sage for that option.

I like corn dogs, which is odd of me since I'm not a huge fan of hot dogs and I really don't like corn bread.  Still, I'm not a huge fan of frying so I prefer enjoying my corn dogs differently.  I've made some corn dog muffins on here that we enjoy but was looking for something new.  I made some adjustments based on what I had on hand and on the review by G.  I don't have celery or green onions so I just left it out, and I also left out the butter.  I used two packages of little smokies and added onion powder and 1/2 c of plain greek yogurt to the mix along with the milk and eggs.  I also used the recipe for Corn Bread Mix on here for the corn bread.  I wasn't sure how much to use, so I might have used too much (I made 12 servings of the corn bread mix recipe and used all of it).  I used a 9x13 casserole pan.  It turned out wonderfully within 35 minutes.  This does taste like corn dogs to me--there's a bit of a change, maybe more breading that corn breads have, and perhaps not as sweet, but for an easy casserole that eliminates frying the corn dogs, it works just great for me.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made some changes to this recipe, but still feel that it deserves 5 stars.  I omitted the celery and added one can of whole kernel corn, drained.  I also added 1/2 cup lite sour cream, because some people had said the casserole was dry.  I added in two diced jalapeno peppers.  I only used 1 lb of hotdogs, rather than 1 and 1/2 pounds.  I used 1/2 tsp sage, and added onion and garlic powder.  My family really loved this more than I did, but I would have given it a 4.

Very tasty and unique.  May need a little extra time to cook - mine was slightly under cooked in the center even though it was browned on top.

This is terrific!  It tastes like the corn dogs I used to get at the county fair but without all the greasiness.  Great dish for a potluck!  Definitely serve with mustard.  YUM!

Thought this was a good, basic recipe. Tasted Just like corn dogs when eaten with ketchup and mustard, but I also served chili and extra cheese along side in case someone wasn't feeling the corn dog flavor. Thought it tasted great both ways, just depends on what you're feeling more. Like many other reviewers I omitted the celery, green onions, sage and pepper, but I added in 1 can whole kernel corn (drained) and 1/2 cup sour cream per the suggestion of another reviewer. This is a keeper recipe for when I'm looking for something easy and tasty.

This was just o.k. , it is definitely a kids dish. Hubby and I didn't care for it. Didn't really taste like a corn dog.

I wasn't too excited about having this for dinner. It just seemed a little strange. In the end I was amazed. I made this recipe as is (with green onions and celery) and my picky 5 year old daughter ATE IT and LOVES IT. Any recipe that my picky eater likes is a keeper for me!

This wasn't our most favorite casserole. I halved this recipe but made it as written. I was glad to put the celery in as a vegetable and to get some fiber. I'm not sure what it was that we didn't care so much for. Maybe it was just the cornbread since we aren't big cornbread eaters.

This recipe is a KEEPER!  Very good.  I was tempted to make some changes, such as eliminating the sage based on some comments stating it made the dish taste like stuffing, and I also thought there was too much celery.  However I followed the recipe exactly and was glad I did.  I will not adjust anything.  Recipe was perfect as is!

This was delicious.  Everyone loved it.  It tasted like a corndog but better!  The only thing I would change is to substitute chunks of velveeta cheese instead of the other cheese, and add a bit more.  I served it w/ sour cream, ketchup, bbq sauce, an salsa on the side.

Maybe my cornbread mix wasn't any good in this recipe, but no one in the family liked the casserole at all (though my husband dutifully ate a couple mustard/ketchup-smothered bites...).  This is the first time I ever threw away something I have cooked for dinner.

I made this recipe as is and it was fantastic!  Will definately make again and again.  I was not sure about the celery and sage but the finished product was great!  It was just like a corn dog; texture, taste and all.  Serving with ketchup and mustard makes it complete.

I think this is a great idea! My husband and 8 yo daughter were so intrigued and delighted with the casserole. It was pretty simple to make and tasted OK. We held the celery which I would do again. I halved the sage but will next time not add it at all. At first I added very little green onions afraid of my 8 yo would go "Eww what are these green things?" then not eat it. But I didn't get that response after my husband convincing me to add the full amount. Next time I will try adding some creamed corn to the cornbread as well. We will definitely make it again but with a few changes.

Very retro and extremely tasty.  I added a can of corn and left out the sage because I didn't have any on hand.  Serve with tater tots for an old school meal.

Thank you for the idea.  I really didn't follow the recipe too closely.  Used a low fat cornbread recipe and turkey cheddar sausages and jalapeños but left out the onions, celery, and sage.  Still really great and never would have done it without having seen this recipe, so thank you!

when i cooked this casserole, i realized that this was a lot greasier than i expected. I had a lot of leftovers left in the pan. I wouldn't cook this again.

I gave this a 4 because I am not a hot dog fan. I give it a 5 though for flavor.  Like others I left out the celery and added 1/2 tsp. of dry mustard for more of a corn dog flavor.  Next time I may try a tsp. instead.  I noticed from the reviews some people leave out the sage.  Personally my family loves the flavor the sage gives.  It is quite a distinctive spice, and I think it goes well with this recipe.  One thing that's important to mention..don't replace the milk with buttermilk...I tried that and it came out mushy.

I made the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious!  I have 4 teenagers (19 thru 15) and they loved it also.  Besides making the full recipe, I also made another half recipe using tofu hot dogs for my vegetarian son.  They all agreed it's a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

My family like this recipe.  My son wants to add chili and more cheese next time.  I also think I may add some dry mustard to the cornbread mix.  Thanks for the post.

If you don't like corn dogs then definitely don't try this recipe because it tasted just like one!!!!:)I omitted the celery and used one very small onion instead of the green onion because I didn't have any. I also added a couple shakes of garlic salt(because I don't cook without it),a dash of cayenne, a dash of cumin, and a couple dashes of chilli powder. I will make this the exact same way next time because it turned out so well. My two girls and the hubby couldn't eat it fast enough. Thanks so much for a fantastic family recipe!

Delicious!!  My husband & I loved this (we are corn dog fans)  The changes I made were 1) I took another reviewers recommendation & used a can of cream corn and cut the milk in half 2) did not add cheese and 3) used 1 lb. of turkey hot dogs, because I don't eat pork/beef.  The calorie calculator at 8 servings is about 450 cal/serving using these changes, so that decreases the calories significantly.  Also, the can of cream corn adds 300 calories to the whole dish, so if you use the original 1 1/2 cups of skim milk, it'll decrease the recipe by 240 calories.  I will try it without the cream corn next time to see if it's worth the calories :)  Thanks so much for this great recipe!!

I would have given this 5 stars if it hadn't been for the sage. I have made this recipe dozens of times over the past several years, and have never followed it exactly (and I never had sage). Last time I made it, I happened to have sage on hand and thought I'd try it exactly as written. It's a personal preference, I know, but I felt the sage was completely unnecessary, overpowering, and quite frankly, gross. Without the sage, this is a 5 star recipe!

I would say this is called a corn dog casserole not because it tastes like a carnival corn dog but because of the ingredients!  Made pretty much exactly as listed and it was a hit!  Thanks for a recipe that makes for a nice sit-down family dinner.

Really enjoyed this recipe!  My daughter loves corn dogs, so I thought I would give this a try.  I followed other reviewers suggestions to omit the celery and onion, as well as the sage.  I added a couple tablespoons of honey to sweeten the cornbread.  It turned out great!  Thanks for sharing!

My family loved this recipe but I did make some changes after reading some of the reviews.  I left out the sage and added Ancho Chili Powder, this seasoning gives a wonderful taste without the heat.  I used a half of can of cream style corn.  I will make this recipe again.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Maxine

I didn't have corn bread mix, but really like the Homesteader Cornbread recipe on this site...so I just basically made the cornbread recipe and added the sauteed celery, onions, weiners and sage, pepper, and cheese to it.  It was fantastic.  Great easy dinner with a salad.

This was okay. My kids liked it more than I did.  After reading the reviews here I cut the amount of cornbread mix in half (used the Corn Bread Mix recipe from this site), and there was still a LOT of cornbread.  I left the shortening out of the mix recipe and added 1/4 cup of sour cream.  I left out the celery, sage and black pepper, since this seemed like it would taste too much like Thanksgiving dressing and have no resemblance to corn dogs.  I did chop some onion and sauted it with the hot dogs along with a little garlic.  If I make this again, I think I might add a little cayenne pepper or chipotle seasoning to add a little kick.

I made this the other night and was skeptical...but it turned out pretty good. I like a few others added the creamed style corn and omitted the sage, celery, butter and green onions. The kids and hubby loved it...it was ok for me, i picked the dogs out and ate those then dug in on the cornbread. Overall it was pretty good and definately something different :)

Great recipe!  I did leave out the onions and celery and the sage, just my preference.  I may try to add some honey to make the bread taste a bit more like corn dogs.

I didn't care for this dish to much, although my husband and kids liked it. This recipe was to sweet for me, and not a suitable dinner dish.  Would you serve corn dogs for dinner? It took a lot longer to cook than 30 min.  I added 1 whole can of cream corn (per another reviewer) I should of only added half of a can because I cut the recipe in half.  I probably will try this again, but only as an appetizer at a party or if I'm serving kids.

This recipe is WONDERFUL!  I didn't add the celery, onions, or sage.  I did add 1 can of creamed corn and it was delicious.  My husband didn't like it.  But my 5 year old and I did.  I definately will make again.  (When hubby will be working late) :)  Thank you Kathe.

This recipe was a hit with my 6 children.  However, I poured this casserole overtop of chili before I baked it. My son was excited to have his own chili-corn dog casserole.

Blech!  I didn't like this at all.  I love corndogs, but this had the celery and onion and sage in it and it made it too busy.  It was kinda too sweet too even with the dogs and cheese.  I dipped it in ketchup (like I do my corn dogs) and that didn't help.  Gave me heartburn and the amount of sodium made me retain water bigtime.  Won't make again, sorry.

Great for a quick meal and actually a little lighter than I imagined, it makes a lot so it would be great for a family gathering. Its very easy to throw together, my seven year old helped make it. I served a fruit salad along side which helped lighten the meal even more. I will definately make it again.  Thanks for a fun recipe!

I thought it was very good.  I'm the type of person who thinks the cornbread is the best part of the corn dog.  I don't understand the importance of the celery.  But who ever thought of this one did a great job.  I just wished my kids would have liked it.  They are to picky.

I followed the original recipe with the exception of cutting back on the sage because I wasn't sure if we would like it. After trying it I would probably add more. I did cook my celery and onion for a little but then I added the hotdogs with the veggies. I made corn on the side and mixed it in later and I liked the crunch it gave it. Will make again.

Everyone here liked it. I didn't add the sage or celery. Added creamed corn, sour cream, salt, pepper, garlic powder and dried mustard. Made half the recipe and it served 5 of us.

I used lowfat buttermilk instead of the milk, reduced-fat hot dogs (Hebrew National, they seem less 'mystery meat') and used slightly less celery and sage per others' comments. Baked in a wide, shallow dish so and took out a few minutes early. It came out perfect! Not mushy. Kids loved it. I may try some dry mustard next time as someone suggested.

This was quite yummy!!! I didn't use the celery or sage, but ended up increasing the recipe by half (family of six) and made one casserole with only hotdogs, cornbread mix and cheese, and in the other I sauteed onions with jalepenoes, then added that. Forgot to reserve some, so just mixed it all up. Kids all asked for seconds, and have asked me to make again. Loved it, thanks for the recipe!

Was surprised at how tasty this was! It brought back memories of when I was a kid! I didnt think I would like the celery but it added a good flavor. I did omit the sage (didn't have any on hand). My husband loved this as did my parents (they stopped unexpected). It was very filling but would taste great with baked beans on the side! Will be making this again!!!

All these reviews about how something needed to be changed or it was terrible are lying! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out to be perfect. My only problem was that I cut the recipe in half. It was so good!

I also left out the sage, used evaporated milk for 1/2 of the milk, added a can of creamed corn and added just a touch of sugar to the cornbread mix.  Was absolutely wonderful for our family reunion pot luck. Definitely a favorite with the kids...

I used to make something similar to this from a recipe out of Taste of Home.  In fact it might be the exact same recipe.  I made this for supper last night and i couldnt find any sage so i made it without it...it seemed like it really was missing something (obviously, sage lol) so when i make it again i will definitely make sure i have this on hand.  Its definitely something our kids will eat.

Although this was easy enough, no one in my house was a fan.  We did add ketchup and mustard to the top after it was baked, but it didn't help much.  Some observations...too much cornbread, not enough hot dog.  The corbread mix was extremely dry.  It's a great concept, it just doesn't come together like I had hoped.  I will not be making this again.

Hot Dogs!

I had a bunch of hotdogs left over from a BBQ that I needed to use up...so we tried this recipe. I did add some jalapenos and left out the sage. I added 1/2 Cup of sour cream also. I think the jalapenos gave a nice flavor of spice. If I make again I would add the cream of corn and leave out the celery....but definatly leave the green onions and cheddar cheese in.

The only ingredient I left out was the sage, didn't have any. I sliced the hot dogs into bite sized pieces. This was pretty good. It is a recipe I will make occasionally. Next time I may add corn.

this was really tasty.  i left out the celery and onions and sage, because i didn't have any on hand. i also added a can of creamed corn to the mixture, for moistness.  it tasted just like a stickless corn dog, and my fiance LOVED it!  delicious!

Really good...kids loved it!  I used smaller amounts of dehydrated onion and celery and only about 3/4 tsp of sage.  I didn't saute onion, celery and hot dogs since I used dehydrated.  Also, if I had sauted hot dogs, they would have been over cooked. I used sweet cornbread mix and used a little more cheese than is called for. Over all, everyone loved this and it's SO easy!

What a treat, this was a great recipe!  My only change was to finely chop the celery, I wanted the flavor but not the texture.

Yummy! I don't like celery and the hubby doesn't like onion, so we skipped both and the sage. I added one can of creamed corn and used turkey franks (40 cal a frank) and we both really like it. I think with the creamed corn it might have been a little too moist, so I might try decreasing the milk a bit next time, or just cooking longer.

Excellent! I made it with vegetarian Italian Sausage (Morningstar), which worked well. I really don't think it tasted like corn dogs, but that might be because I made it vegetarian...? The dish was extremely moist. In fact, maybe it could have used a few more minutes in the oven, but I thought the moisture made it even better.  After reading the other posts, next time I'll play with it a little, using muffin pans and adding creamed corn and less milk.

OUTSTANDING!  I didn't have any sage, so I used marjoram...smelled the closest to sage, and I'd never cooked with it before. I was actually surprised at how good it was!  I'm not a hot dog fan, but my BF is.  He's a trucker and I'm always looking for freezer meal ideas.  This freezes and reheats really well!  Thanks for sharing it!

Delicious!  A definite keeper!  My husband and I both gave this a thumbs up.   As others have said, it needed more baking time, and I will lower the temp next time.  Mine got golden brown before the 30 min. and I had to cook it beyond the 30 min. for it to get done.  I also omitted the celery and sage, as corndogs do not contain these ingredients, and I used chopped sweet onion instead of green onion. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Lower rating is because it's hot dogs and I just can't see myself ever saying a hot dog is the most delicious thing I've ever tasted and because the ratios in this recipe are way off. Had a freezer emergency that caused 5 pounds of hot dogs to thaw. Needed to find interesting ways to use them up. This was the best of all the ideas. Accidentally did not use the entire amount of cornbread mix called for and am really glad. Even though I doubled the hot dogs there was still a lot of dough for each bite. So if you half the cornbread mix and double the hot dogs--you'll enjoy this.

I made this for a Young Adult group at our church and it was a hit! I left out the celery and sage and substituted vegetarian hotdogs. Served with mustard & ketchup, they all thought it tasted like a huge corndog.

This casserole was very bland and very dry.  I think maybe two packages of hot dogs cut up would help improve it.  Both of my teenagers and my husband said not to make it again.

I didn't have any sage so I omitted it.  I added chopped garlic to the celery and onion mixture.  It definitely needed more spice, will make it again, just play around with the seasonings.  I used 1 package of turkey dogs and 1/2 of turkey smoked sauage all chunked up.  Thanks!

My husband and son really liked this casserole. I only used 1 cup of chopped celery, 2 cups just seemed like a lot. I used 98% fat free hot dogs and skim milk to cut out some of the fat and calories. It does taste very much like a corn dog. I will make this again.

Pretty good recipe. I added a tablespoon of prepared mustard and used poultry seasoning instead of sage last time I made this, and my 'testers' said it added better flavor. Next time, I will omit the celery.

I serve it with a berry fruit and yogurt parfait.

YUM!  I added a dollop of sour cream like another review suggested (just cause I had some)....came out very moist!  Had the leftovers the following day for lunch...re-heated very well on the stove top with a little 'I cant believe it's not butter'spray!

This was good. It looked kind of gross when everything was mixed together and I poured it into the pan, but it really did taste like a corn dog, only healthier. I used light hot dogs and skim milk with good results. The celery and onions add a little something extra. I served with ketchup and mustard on the side.

This is an easy and delicious recipe. Just like real corndogs, the slightly sweet cornmeal goes so well with the salty, savory hotdogs. I used turkey dogs to save a few calories.

Quite the “comfort food” dish! I used kielbasa versus hot dogs and the husband loved it. Thanks, Kathe, for a great recipe!

Kathe- This was a very good recipe!  Holy Cow!  It was easy, fast and turned out so much better than I expected.  We used Kielbasa sausages instead of hotdogs.  Everyone chowed down!  Thanks a million!

I thought this was delicious, but it was a tough sell to my husband. He likes corn dogs but says this doesn't remind him of them at all. Don't know if I'll get to make it again :(

Well..I don't call myself a cook, but when I do cook it often times becomes a family favorite.  I made this dish for my wife for Mother's Day and....I should've taken her out to eat.  This was a big disappointment.  Wow, talk about dry. I went with all veggie dogs even though my wife is the only vegetarian in the house.  She said she liked it, but I suspect it was so she wouldn't hurt my feelings.  She wouldn't have...I hated it.  Like anything though...give it a try for yourself....who knows, you might like it.

Average dish that tasted like it should have, just like a corn dog. I took the advice of others and omitted the onions and celery. The family liked it ok, not a bad meal on a busy night. Nice to have tried it, but I don't think I'll be making it again.

I took the advice of other reviewers and left out some things -- the celery, onions, and sage.  What was left really hit the spot with young and old, and it was a good, quick, and filling meal!  Nice touch, too, browning the hotdog slices in butter!  YUM!

This yummy casserole has some very strong flavors and isn't for the faint of heart (or taste buds) I made it just as the recipe calls for. The only thing I might change next time will be to cut the hot dogs into diagonal rings instead of the thin little slices.  My entire family of all ages enjoyed it and said it was a keeper.

OK, it did taste just like a corn dog - which I admit was impressive.  But... Since this was an adult craving for carnival food and I didn't have a zillion kids to feed, it made way more than I would ever eat. Good try though - who would've thought it really would taste like a corn dog...

Tastes very similar to corn dogs and it gets better the more of it you eat.  Everybody liked it and it was a great change of pace. but it's not something I'd serve often.

I made this exactly as written and I was surprised at how much I liked it. It really captures the flavor of a corn dog. Don’t leave out the veggies, just slice them very finely. They add moisture and sweetness that you don’t want to skip. Everything melds together, I didn’t taste sage, celery, onions or cheese. I just tasted corn dog!

I did as others suggested and omitted the sage and celery and added a can of creamed corn. This is the first time that the consensus from other users on this site have steered me wrong. It was like eating really soggy corn pudding with hot dogs. I'll go ahead and give this four stars since I changed the recipe so much from the original (even though I followed the user suggestions), but I don't think I'll make this again.

This casserole was pretty good.  My sister, who is "special" loves corn dogs and her and I make a recipe together every couple of months.  This is the one we tried.  She loved it.  I liked it.  
I did change it up just a bit.  I used Eckrich Smokey Links, the cheddar ones.  I like hot dogs but not well enough for a casserole.  I omitted the celery as Amanda and I do not care for celery.  I used yellow sweet onions instead of the green onions because I forgot to get the green ones.  I added creamed corn, and decided on two cans because who doesn't love corn pudding!  So to offset the liquid, I used three eggs instead of two. I omitted the sage as others stated to do so.  I added some salt with the pepper.
It turned out great.  It was easy to remove from the pan and smelled wonderful.  My daughter was also over and she loved it.  Amanda loved it and I liked it.  My mother, not so much.  So that's why there are four stars.  Also, it was very easy to make and we needed easy because with my Father in the hospital, easy is the only way to go!

my daughter and I really liked it. it took a lot longer to cook so the cornbread was dried out. it was my fault. I used a bread pan which was to deep. I will definitely make this again but use a shallow baking dish next time. that should solve the problem.

I was really nervous about this recipe due to 1/2 positive and 1/2 negative reviews.  I doubt if I would make it again, I'm giving it 3 1/2 stars.  I agree with others in the fact that it needs more hot dogs.  I did reduce the celery to 1 c. and the onion to 1 c.  I wanted more of a corn dog flavor so I added some dried mustard and reduced the sage to a couple of sprinkles.  I found it to be quite bready and more like a stuffing/dressing with hot dogs added to it.  I missed the crunch of the fried outer coating of a traditional corn dog.  My husband said it was "ok" and so he'll be getting it in his lunch for the next week.  I may try one more serving, but it will be because I don't have anything else to eat.

I omitted celery, green onion, sage, butter, added one can of creamed corn, used Bob’s red mill cornbread mix. Served with quinoa chili also from this site for dinner. It was very moist and tasty!! We all love it!  Next time I’ll try add some greens.

I cut the recipe in half and instead of using corn bread mix, I used the recipe for corn bread on back of the corn meal box. I mixed all ingredients together except saved some of the cheese to put on top and poured into a 12x9 pan.  This turned out real good.

This was DELICIOUS!!!!  My kids and my fiancé and I all gobbled it up.  Seriously!  So good.  The only thing I did differently was omit the green onion because I am not a fan.   I will definitely be making this again and again and again!!

I skip the celery and use yellow onions. I also use chicken apple sausage these days.  I've been making it since 2004. It's a tradition.   At our house we call it Presidential Debate Casserole.  Go Hillary!

This was pretty good. I used red onion instead since it's what I had on hand and we are big onion fans.  I also put the celery and onion through the food processor so they would be really finely chopped. I only put cheese on top and my family requested that I not use it at all next time. I only had one box of corn bread mix so I used that and then substituted the second box with just over a cup of plain cornmeal. I also plan to grease the pan next time. So other than little tweaks for personal preference we liked it and I will make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

Surprisingly I really enjoy this - perfect as a "guilty pleasure" every now and then.  The kids love it and it's super easy to whip up - I always have these ingredients around.

I've made this several times over the past year.  I never have green onions, so I usually use a yellow onion.  I also use whatever hot dogs are on hand.  I don't add the hot dog mixture to the top, I add it all in at once.  I also use the food processor to cut all the veggies and the hot dogs.  My children are small so I don't want them chocking on the pieces.  It looks a little odd with the hot dogs cut up so finely but it tastes great.

Awesome! I did not do the celery and sage due to preference, and was out of onions. Added a can of drained sweet corn. Loved it! Cut dogs into rounds cuz that's what my kids prefer. Will definitely make regularly. Thank you!

I have tried several times and different ways without the celery ( not as good). Last night I made it with dinner sausage, green peppers, and mozzarella cheese in and on top with cheddar.

My husband loved this and I thought it was pretty good, too, but maybe just a bit dry. Used onion powder instead of onions because my husband can't eat onions. Otherwise made it exactly as it written. I think this would be very kid friendly too.

Just made it and ate a portion. I'm usually a man, a plan, and a can. This was easy, fairly quick,  and there wasn't much cleanup. I backed off on the celery and onions. I kept the sage. I think it tastes more like stuffing than corndogs, but it's still good. Kids should like it. 

Cut the hot dogs however you want. Save some time, bro.

I had a lot of venison hot dogs to use up from my husband's hunting trip last year, so I've been looking for new ways to cook them.  

This recipe made A LOT - a whole 9x13 pan for me.  The cornbread was good, but the hot dogs got a little dry when reheating.  Towards the end of the pan, I started serving a slice of casserole on top of a bowl of chili.

It was a good recipe to use up my hot dogs, but I probably wouldn't make again otherwise.

I have been slowly trying to get rid of a bunch of hotdogs we got for a cookout that got rained out. I am not a huge hotdog fan to start with...so this is probably the best that can be hoped for given I am not a hd lover to start with. It was pretty good. Hubby liked it. Probably wouldn't make it again on purpose....but it was a not bad way to move along those leftover hotdogs. kids would probably really like it. The flavor was good though it seemed it could use a bit more moisture/was a tad dry. I think I really would make this again with real beef or chicken in it  instead though.

My husband who hates corndogs went back for seconds.  It was a hit with the kids too.  I took others advice, omitted the celery, used half of a medium yellow onion, and cut way back on the sage, which was about 1/8 tsp.  OH, I added celery seeds in place of the actual celery, 1 tsp.  I only made with 1 C milk and 1/2 C sour cream.  It was super moist.  I made mustard-y baked beans to go as a side dish!  Freakin Fabulous!  Thanks for sharing.

I have never cared much for corndogs but this is a great comfort  food casserole.  I halved it but used a full package of hot dogs.  I am making it again tonight for my grandkids.  I also didnt bother putting a cup of rserved mixture on the top and it wasn't any different.

I made this for dinner a few nights ago and everyone loved it! They weren't sure about it beforehand, they said it was interesting. But one taste and they fell in love with it! I will have to do this again! I did leave the green onions/sage because I didn't have any on hand. I also used Monterey Jack Cheese instead of Cheddar! I recommend it!

Very disappointing!!! Too dry. The sage was overpowering. We could not taste that there was any cheese. Adding some mustard is the only that made this somewhat acceptable to eat.

I thought this was just OK but the hubs really liked it a lot.  We omitted the celery and onion but found it to be a bit dry.  Next time I think we'll try adding sour cream to the corn bread mix for some moisture.  Not bad for a quick weeknight meal.

This casserole was a hit at my house as well!  I omitted the celery and sage, decreased the milk to 1 cup and added a can of creamed corn.  The only thing I would change would be maybe to cook at a lower temp for longer, as 30 minutes at 400 was not enough time for the middle to set.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

If you have kids, you can't go wrong here. Mine loved it! Also, you can't mess this one up. I only had half the milk, so the other half I used chicken broth. I only had 1 pkg of turkey dogs, so we threw in some turkey bacon too. I added cream corn also. Great recipe to experiment with.

This was a fantastic recipe, especially for kids!  If you love corn dogs, you will love this casserole.  I only changed:  amount of milk ot 1/2 cup, omitted sage and used Hebrew National dogs!  WONDEFUL!  If the 16 year old loves it that says it is great!!!!!!!!  Thanks for sharing!!!!  All Mom's should try this recipe!

I would not make this again.  I took the advice of others and ommited the celery and sage.  It was just corn bread with hotdogs in it.  Nothing special at all!!!

When I cooked this exactly as the recipe indicated, it came out way too dry.  Next time I will NOT pre-cook the hot dogs (they were nearly burned) and either put in less cornbred mix or more hot dogs and will cut the cooking time.  Nothing wrong with my oven either.  I will try it one more time.

Okay for me but hubby did not care for.  It was better the first time.  Leftovers not so great, and there was LOTS leftover. Made this second time and added a can of creamed corn and 3/4 cup buttermilk much better! Baked at 325 for 45 min. Delish.

I followed directions exactly with the exception of using hot dogs. I used hillshire  cocktail smokie links. I was disapointed in the flavor and think it may be the cornbread mix I used,It was fairly dense but cut very well. I will do this one more time using beef hot dogs and a goog quality corn meal mix. I put some mustard on my piece and it did perk it up as I ate it soooooooo check the ingredients in your cornbread mix. This may be the difference between o.k. and good!

A friend made this for us one time and it was wonderful. She sent me the link for the recipe here. However, It has been in the oven for an hour now and it still isn't baked through yet. There is nothing wrong with my oven, it's brand new and it's set to 400. After the top got brown I tested it and it was still mushy inside. I covered it with foil so it can finish baking. Next time I need to remember that this takes double the time to bake then suggested.

I'm not a huge fan of hot dogs, which is probably why this recipe didn't sit well with me. My boyfriend, however, loves cornbread and hotdogs so I thought this dish would be a hit with him. He ate a serving for dinner, but said he would rather eat this for a side dish rather than a whole meal.

Very yummy.  My husband and toddler eat this up.  I think it's good with sweated white onions instead of green.  They give it a little kick.  I also add a little sour cream.

This was better than expected but not outstanding. The sage seems very necessary to give this dish its character. Next time will either double the dogs or halve the other ingredients. This would make good comfort food on a cold fall day.

Very hearty and delicious! It tastes just like a corn dog! I left out the celery. Also, I used a can of creamed corn and reduced the amount of milk. It turned out very moist and flavorful.

This tasted NOTHING like a corn dog. I have had corn dogs (Pittsburgh has an amusement park with FAMOUS corn dogs). It was SO DRY too. I made the recipe without adding anything or changing it. I dont think we'll try remaking it! Covering this in ketchup didn't even save it. I want back the money I spent to buy the ingredients!!!

Recipe was a hit!  I omitted celery, onion, and sage.  Added some garlic and onion powder along with 1/2 cup sour cream to keep it moist.  Make sure to bake this in a SHALLOW dish or you'll have trouble with uneven baking.

This was a good recipe.  I halved the ingredients and chopped my veggies very finely.  I thought it was a bit dry, I would maybe add a touch of sour cream or butter to the corn bread batter (could have also been my mix, just plain cheap Jiffy!).  I think next time, I will also chop the hotdogs into "coins".  The bigger chunks were kind of hard for the kdis to manage.  BUT....., they did eat this (happily!), so I will tweak a bit more to my family's tastes.  Thanks.

I brought this to a house warming/pot luck party and I brought home an almost empty dish.  
On the advice of other reviewers I halved the celery and added 1/2 cup of sour cream.  The sour cream helped with the moistness of the bread, but next time I would use a whole cup.  Also, I used Old Bay seasoning instead of sage and I only used 1 pound hot dogs.
Also, don't forget to grease the baking dish!

I love this recipe!  I make this every couple of months, using turkey hot dogs to cut the fat content.  I also use fresh sage when I have it - taking out the sprigs before baking.  I think it's best with the celery and onions.  I've also added creamed corn, as per another reviewer.  This is easy to adjust the amounts depending on your crowd.

This was SO good, tasted just like a giant corn dog - VERY filling and kid-friendly! I halved the recipe and left out the celery, onion and sage, sauteing the hot dogs in butter and a little pepper.  Mixed everything else together and added the hot dogs, poured into a casserole dish and topped with a little more cheese.  My son dipped each forkful in ketchup, I topped mine with mustard. I'll definitely make again, thanks for sharing!

All I could taste was celery and no one liked this. I baked it in muffin pans for easier reheating but pitched them instead. If I attempt this again, I will skip the celery & use white onions.

I chose to keep the onions and the celery as a way of getting some veggies into my family. (I did add some frozen corn.) My picky husband loved it and my 2 yr old even tried- I will make again!

After hearing the name my husband was kid of "iffy" about it.  After the first bite he was hooked!  He ate almost all of the casserole in one sitting.

My daughter, husband & I are all very picky eaters & we all loved this recipe. (which doesn't happen very often)  I did leave out the sage & celery & used sweet onion instead of green because I didn't have any green onions, and it still turned out great!  Thanks for posting!

We really enjoyed this. I left out the sage only because I didn't have any. But, I probably won't use it next time either because it was so good with out it. My picky husband loved this.

Yum!
I don't have anything to add that everyone else has already said... Really yummy, tastes just like a corndog. To those that made it with kielbasa... YUM, what a great idea, I will try that too!!

Our family really liked this. The only things I changed was to use extra sage in with the onions and celery, and I used polish kielbassa instead of hotdogs. We used lots of mustard and everyone loved it! Thanks!

This recipe was okay.  I really love corn dogs and thought this sounded wonderful.  Made it exactly as the recipe called for and it was very dry.  I did like the taste of the sage in it, but found it kinda boring.

I wasn't terribly impressed, I added the can of creamed corn because everyone said it was too dry and it wasn't cooked in the middle after an additional 15 min.  Will have to stick to the recipe next time and see how it comes out.

I knew my son and husband would like this, what I wasn't prepared for was how much I would enjoy this dish.  It also reheated well for a quick Sunday afternoon lunch.

The dryness can be fixed by adding a can of creamed corn to the mix.  My kids love it this way and I don't hear any complaints.

This is an easy and quick recipe.  I make it a little healthier by using veggie dogs and low fat cheese.  I don't bother with pan frying anything first - just mix the cornbread and stir everything in.  Sometimes I add jalapenos for an extra kick.

A Hit in my house!  I made it because my husband LOVES corndogs, and he can't get enough of it!  I use less celery, and whatever cheese I happen to have in the fridge when I make it.  It even tastes good with turkey hotdogs!

I ommited the celery and used cornmeal mix instead of boxed, the outcome was very dry. My family had to pour on mustard to even eat it.  I think the concept is wonderful, it just needs something to make it less dry.

I didn't like this much.  It was quite dry, and it just didn't taste very good.  One of my kids ate 2 bites and then picked at it, almost like he was trying to give it another chance because it seemed like it should be a good idea. .

As many other reviewers stated, I also left out the veggies and sage.  My family really enjoyed this.  I think this will be a good choice for potlucks where children will be attending--they'll gobble it up!

Not what I had hoped - I definitely won't make this again.  The sage made it have an ugly green color and the taste was not very good.

I really enjoyed this casserole.  Tastes just like a corn dog.  Used white onions instead of green as that's all I had.  Unfortunately my husband did not like it so we won't be having this again.
