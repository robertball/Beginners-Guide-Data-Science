Lovely but not like tgi - to make it bang on make the following changes:

Do not use the onion - it kills the sauce . The garlic is more than enough.

Use standard size garlic and not roasting size

Use chilli flakes , not cayenne pepper 

Double up on the whisky (so 2tbsn)

Here's the most important bit - substitute 1/3 of a cup of the sugar for golden syrup. 

After playing with this recipie a lot with various changes the above is virtually indistinguishable from the tgi glaze .

I used this recipe to the exact directions, and it came out perfect. Although I suggest you pull it off the burner after simmering in low for about 20-30 min, put in fridge to cool down and then see how thick it comes out. My first attempt I reduced it way too much, but the taste is very darn close, good job with the recipe! I my self have used this recipe as a base for my own rendition of this sauce, and used honey jack instead of jack Daniels, and added some cinnamon so it was not too similar to T.G.I. Fridays original jack Daniels sauce. No one likes a copy cat, haha

Made this and glazed some smoked beef back ribs. Knocked everyone's socks off!

Glazed turned out perfectly. I may have simmered it a little too long, so when it cooled, it was way too thick. Flavor was just as I remembered from TGIFridays!

I have made this several times just as specified. My family says that the chicken I make with this glaze is the best thing they have ever had in their lives. We love it! Follow the recipe to a T and you can't go wrong. Bake chicken wings for 50 minutes seasoned with salt and pepper, then brush this glaze on every 5-10 minutes and let the glaze build up. It's awesome

I’ve been making this for a few years and this is where I got the recipe and what I use, except for a slight alteration. I change the amount of crushed pineapple from one tablespoon to three. The pineapple gives it a distinct texture that we really like. Our favorite use for this might be surprising. We use this for grilled burgers the most. I spoon the sauce over each burger after the flip. Through trial and error I have found that it burns too easily to let it be in direct contact with the heat source, charcoal in our case. Whether or not this is the original recipe put out in the 70’s by Jack Daniel’s, I don’t know. But we can’t tell the difference in this and what they have at Friday’s.

IMPORTANT: Mak sure you use a lot medium sauce pan. If not it will boil over. Ok. I did what Ben Nathan suggested. It's dead on except for the cayenne pepper. I think it made it a little spicer the T.G.I. Friday's.   I think maybe less cayenne pepper would make it more like the restaurant sauce. I may not put in any cayenne pepper next time. I think it might be ok without it. I'm going to try that this weekend for Christmas finger foods. Cover chic-fil-a's nuggets with the sauce. If also didn't do the garlic like it stated. I'm too impatient to cook garlic. I bought garlic paste instead and urged out the same.  Make sure when you're simmering the sauce that you have medium bubbles. (Too small won't simmer right, too large will probably tasted burnt.)  Follow Ben's changes and a few of my suggestions and it turn out spot on. He did perfect the recipe!

I agree with several others, cut out the onion. It overpowers the sauce. And go very easy IF you use the cayenne, it doesn't need that much. I don't use it at all sometimes and it's fine. But if you use to much, blech. I also double the crushed pineapple.  My family loves it.

I made this sauce and the onions totally overpowered everything. So I suggest cutting the onions down to 1 tablespoon......it's also not sweet enough so I'd up the sugar amount. It was pretty much too strong all around, so next time I make it, I'll pretty much lessen the amount of everything but the sugar.

I followed the directions exactly as written except for the crushed pineapple.  This tastes nothing like JD sauce from Fridays.  It has way too much of a pineapple flavor and hardly any whiskey.

I changed it a bit.  Substituted molasses 2/3 cup for the brown sugar as it creates a greater depth of flavor and color than only brown sugar.  I also doubled the garlic.  I used cayenne pepper since that is what I had in the cabinet, and it worked out just fine.  I make double batches since this freezes very well.

We absolutely loved this recipe - I marinaded some chicken wings in the sauce, and baked them in a hot oven. Initially my sauce was a bit thin, so be sure to let it cool a bit to help it thicken before coating your meat.
Would 100% recommend you try this!

AWESOME!!  We are on a Keto diet so I just substituted some Swerve brown sugar for the regular stuff.  Of course the pineapple juice (less than a cup spread throughout the whole recipe) and only a Tbls. of crushed pineapple only set us back a tiny bit.  We tried it on  BBQ'd flank steak like Friday's does and it was the next best thing to being there in person!!  A DEFINITE keeper!!

I made this last night and it was AMAZING! I read the reviews and altered the recipe by only using 1 Tablespoon of the white onion and 2 Tablespoons of Honey Jack Daniels . I'm going to double the recipe next time.

I love this sauce! It goes great with so many things and it's always a great hit when I make it and add to my main course. 

As extra serving or had a little bit of this to some barbecue sauce. 

 It Never loses its kick. I love this sauce. I make it because it's really good. Every once in  a hundred years I'll buy it if I don't have time to make it.  It's a Great dish.

Not sure why but the sauce didn’t thicken for me. I simmered for 45 minutes thinking it would thicken once it cooled... it didnt.... but the flavor is amazing and worthy of 5 stars.

I make this all the time. I leave the Cayenne out for the family members that don't like spicy food. It is excellent on burgers.

This is dead on.  I have made this sauce three times so far and every time it is prefect.  I did add another tablespoon of Jack Daniels and keep everything else the same.

I will definitely make this again. I usually buy this sauce from TGIF but it was so easy to make.   I didn’t have lemon juice so I used orange juice.

This recipe is outstanding what a big hit it was, this is as close as you can come to the same sauce as T.G.I. Friday's maybe even better. I cut back to 1 cup brown sugar and added 1 Tblsp of Worcestershire sauce the second time I made it and it was still outstanding with that extra little twang we absolutely love it. Michael DeLong  thank you so much for sharing your awesomeness  and making this family a happy one

Lived this one but I just had to add a little extra bourbon. Just had too, LOL. The 1st time, I reduced it a little too much but my salmon was still really good. I also grilled it on a cedar plank. I made it a 2nd time to use on a steak. Also fantastic. Let the meat marinade overnight in the mixture then reduce it right before grilling. You'll thank me later. :)

I doubled this recipe making it exact. It was delicious! and very close to Friday's JD glaze. Others said to omit the onions, but if you use the minced (dried) onions per the recipe, it is an ingredient you do not want to omit. Mine did not thicken as I wanted, but that is probably due to not being patient enough to continue the stirring during the thickening process and I was afraid to burn it. We baked salmon in the oven and put the glaze on it towards the end of baking. Delicious! The leftover glaze for dinner tonight, is now thickened from being in the the fridge overnight and will be put on grilled chicken.

We tried the Jack Daniels Chicken at TGIFridays and fell in love with the sauce.  This recipe is very close to their version and VERY delicious!

I used to order a burger, chicken, or ribs with this sauce at TGI Friday's.  Now, I can make it whenever I want.  My family loves it, too.  Thanks for sharing.

I liked the taste of the sauce.  I let it cook down for an hour and it was still very thin.  It was very good brushed on the chicken I made.
