I made these for a group "Indian themed" carry-in and they were a HIT! I followed the recipe just as it is but was only able to marinate them for 2 hours due to time constaints. I cooked them on a my GMG pellet smoker at 375 and then put them in my crockpot for transportation and keeping hot. I will definitely
be making these again! First time I have ever experimented with  Indian spices and cooking. What an eye opener for me. Loved Them!

Amazing flavor on these wings! I purchased “party wings” for this recipe, just like what you get at BW3. They were awesome. Next time I’ll add some cayenne pepper though as they weren’t very spicy

A nice change of pace from the usual chicken wings! I love Indian flavors and this is the perfect mashup. These have some heat, so if you're sensitive to spicy foods, cut back on the chile. I served mine sprinkled with cilantro, and with a homemade mango chutney yogurt dipping sauce. I marinated mine for about 24 hrs, then grilled them on medium-low. They would have burned on high heat.
