Very tasty stock!
I don't like wasting food so after I strain the stock, I put all veggies on the blender with some liquid (stock) and a little bit of milk or cream.

My kids love this creamy veggie soup ( a great source of fiber)

I love this!!!! I'd never even thought of making my own veggie broth and it's in so many recipes. It's also a great substitute for chicken broth. This is a great way to get rid of vegetables in your fridge that are no longer fresh. I also love the comment about putting the veggies in the blender and making a cream soup with them, I also hate wasting anything. I blended mine with a little of the broth and added sour cream and cheddar. Absolutely delicious!!! To think, I almost threw them away!

This is a fabulous stock.  So much so, the next time I will double it, and freeze the extra into ice cubes in the freezer for whenever I need extra broth.  A couple of things I did was - I cut the carrot pieces into about 2" chunks.  After I cooked everything and the broth was finished, the carrots were still firm enough to cup into slices (I used large carrots.)  I ended up using this as a base for a vegetarian matzo ball soup where I added fresh made matzo balls (see package directions - very easy) and homemade noodles (on this site) plus the sliced carrots and a little parsley.  My friends gave it an 11 grade out of 10.  This will be a staple for me.  I also pureed the leftover vegetables and added some broth and milk with cheddar cheese.  Next time I will cook up some broccoli, mash it up a bit and add it to this mix.  It makes a great base for a broccoli cheese soup.  Plus, if you've never cooked the garlic like this before, it's wonderful.  I did make some homemade bread and threw in an extra head in the cooking process.  If you squeeze the garlic and add a little butter, and spread it on bread with some fresh grated parmesan, it's YUMMY.  This is such a great recipe because you can do so much when roasting the vegetables.  Oh, and I did add a 1/2 bunch of parsley to the broth when cooking.

This is a FANTASTIC stock recipe. I've made it even easier by using disposable aluminum pans for roasting the vegetables. Then I put all the ingredients in my slow cooker and put it on high for two hours, then on low for an additional eight hours. Delicious! And SOOOOO easy!

Beautiful stock, the soup idea was fantastic.  Be sure to add enough salt to bring out the flavor, not enough and it ended up being bland.  Much cheaper than store bought stock, and much more flavorful.  It was hard to not just eat the carrots straight out of the pot!  I used dried bay leaves and parsley, I upped the parsley to 2 teaspoons, and used a whole branch of fresh thyme.  I used two tomatoes, instead of one, as well.  Will definitely keep this delicious stock on hand.

Simply the best vegetable stock I have ever made!  I keep freezer bags of vegetable scraps in the freezer so I pulled out one of those - carrot peels, sweet potato peels, pieces of onions and peppers, garlic cloves that had dried out, stems from spinach, pieces of fennel and herbs that had passed their prime.  I added celery, carrots and quartered onions and some rosemary, bay leaves and peppercorns.  After placing them in the pot I added a little water to the roasting pan to help scrape up some of the bits left in the pan.  The broth is so rich and dark, it looks almost like beef broth.  All I need to do is add some salt and figure out what I want to use this in first!

The green bell pepper was too overpowering. Next time I'll leave it out. Overall good flavor.

I use this recipe anytime I want to make a vegetable stock. It makes the house smell so good all day, after I roast the veggies I put in the slow cooker and cover with water, plus put in the spices in. I leave it on low for about 8 hrs or so. Than I let it cool in the fridge overnight, the next day I put it in ice cube trays and after they freeze than a zip lock bag. I use this stock in place of water when cooking veggies and it rly addes alot of flavor. I also used it when I made baby food and my baby must of thought the same thing cause he loved it.

Fantastic!!!  I used basil and oregano in place of parsley and bay leaves.  Even my five year old loves this and he hates veggies!  I followed advice of others and blended the veggies into a soup.  Yummy!

One of the most tasty soups I've ever had. The dried thyme and the taste of the roasted veggies dominate among the others. Also very easy to cook even for an amateur in cooking.. like me.

I made using the exact vegetables listed this time. Easy to make - great results.  I think I simmered mine a bit long - only ended up with 4 Cups.  This was my first time making vegetable stock and I will continue to make my own now I know how easy it is!  I did add almost  a full tsp of salt and just a dash of pepper.

the best stock ever!  I just used what was in the bottom of the fridge...I have used it for soups, injected a turkey with it...great color too!  UPDATED REVIEW:  I have used a variety of veggies, squash, whatever I have in the scraps bag in the freezer (I save all veggie scraps just for this broth) Roast the veggies, put into two crock pots and let simmer overnight, makes a ton.  Freeze flat in ziplocks so I can just pull out what I need.  Makes plain rice delicous, I use it in everything instead of water or chicken broth! Use fresh herbs if available.

This stock recipe is great.  Very simple.  I made this last night and my whole apartment smelled fantastic.  The only thing different I added was fresh bay leaves, thyme and parsley.  I didn't know it was so easy to make veggie stock!

I only had a red pepper on hand so used that, and didn't have a tomato. The flavor of the stock was fine, but so much evaporated during the simmering time I had less than 4 cups when I was done - and I only let it simmer for an hour. Is it normal to lose that much during the cooking process? I was hoping for a bigger batch.

I changed up a few of the vegetables based on my likes.  I used an unpeeled/chunked large sweet sweet potato, a large unpeeled/quartered onion, 3 unpeeled/chunked carrots, 3 stalks of celery, 1 bulb of garlic cut in half and 3 large quartered tomatoes.  I tossed them all in Olive Oil on a lined baking sheet, sprinkled them with Kosher salt, pepper and thyme.  Roasted them as directed, simmered in water then strained.  I poured mine after cooling into freezer bags in 2 cup quantities.

I used this stock to make Risotto and it was really yummy! (guilty of leaving out the pepper and adding 2 shallots since I had them handy)

We found this recipe to be absolutely delicious.  Followed the recipe as written but without adding salt (hubs is on salt free diet).  It definitely needs salt.  The flavor was outstanding.  I used dried thyme leaves as opposed to ground thyme.  I also made a double batch and got about a quart of broth.  Thanks, Sarah, for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Good flavour and very adaptable, but a couple issues:
1. I never add salt to the base recipe. Salt can be added when used in other recipes (soups, pilafs, etc.). Otherwise, it can be too salty when reduced.
2. The yield does not consider evaporation in the simmering process. I got about 6 cups of liquid using the minimum time and lowest simmering heat.

I'd also like to try using less olive oil.

Really Good! Maybe a bit to much oil. I left out the green pepper (don't care for them).  I also pureed the strained vegetables and froze them in 2 Tbsp portions in ice cube trays.  

I used this to make a variation of butternut squash soup from this site with pureed pumkin from my garden.

1 c. pumpkin puree
1 c. roasted veg. stock
2 Tbsp roasted veg. puree

Heat through, add salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste. Delicious!

It's funny how it can sometimes be quite pricey to make your own vegetable stock, at least as measured against bullion. This recipe uses pretty low-cost vegetables (especially if you omit the bell pepper) and the solids should absolutely be reserved and used for another time. As others have said, it makes your kitchen smell amazing!

years after my first trial making homemade stock which was of course a disaster, I gathered the courage to try again and with the wisdom gained from all the reviews here this was a huge success. Great by itself, makes my rice dishes even flavorful and serves as a good base for my vegetarian soups. Just added some extra salt, a whole potato  and whole lot of indian spices and doubled the recipe. TY for the recipe and the reviews

I love this because I can leave out the items I am allergic to, add what's getting old in the veggie drawer, and it's still a terrific broth!

It's fall, so kitchen is full of squash. I used a big butternut, carrots, onions, turnips and garlic for the roasting. It was hard to save it for the boiling pot, so TASTY. Yesterday added celery and swiss chard from the freezer, fresh parsley, and mushrooms. Seriously yummy. Would possibly add a squeeze a lemon if I were eating it as a consomme'.

Tonight I will use some to make some apple-broccoli soup, then the rest goes in the freezer in quart portions for future use.  (Just bought the chest freezer; how did we ever live without one!)

Excellent combination.  I added a yellow squash & a zucchini to my roasting pan & it was wonderful.  Easy enough to make our own when the local grocery doesn't carry it.

Decent and yummy, but not 8 cups. Doesn't account for the cup that evaporates. Still, yummy!

I suddenly needed vegetable stock for the Boston Baked Beans I'm making this weekend. No way was I buying a can of stock when I have this recipe at my fingertips.

I LOVED this recipe and won't change a thing when I make it again.This tasty stock will also be great as a base for gravies now that Thanksgiving and Christmas are coming up. I have learned that since we don't get as much fat drippings from turkey that we use to it is hard to make a flavorful gravy.I have used water that I boiled veggies and a little wine to help improve the flvor of the gravy and people always rave about it and request that I make the gravy.This will be the recipe I use this Thanksgiving for sure. The great part is that you can make it days ahead of time and it is one less thing to be doing while people are waiting to eat.

I am sorry. I really wanted to like this recipe. I LOVE soup but this was not good at all. I followed the recipe exactly according to the recipe but I just did not like it at all. My husband didn't like it either. Perhaps it is just us since all the other reviews were loving it. I have a feeling that maybe the thyme was a little strong.

This was delicious!  I was sick and drank it by itself.  I used the leftovers to make Mexican rice instead of chicken stock.  It was great!  I will definitely make again to freeze!

This is fantastic!  I never added the pepper.  I used carrots, celery, onions, ginger, beets, garlic, and fennel (anise)  The bulb and the tops.  I also squeezed a lime in it!  So good !

Try roasting some sweet potato with the other veggies.  I also just puree all the veggies and add to whatever soup i'm making.  make packages and freeze separately to keep  on hand - so much better than anything I've tried.

Such a healthy alternative to packaged broth. The aroma of the veggies roasting was awesome! I divided the broth into ziplock bags, labelled it, and lay them flat on a tray in the freezer.

Good recipe, but DON'T discard the garlic husk!! It adds flavor to the stock. Same for onion skins.  I keep a gallon ziploc bag of vegetable remnants (the ends of carrots, carrot skins from peeling them, onion skins, cucumber skins, the bottom of celery, the tops of celery, etc., all the stuff we cut off ) in the freezer , then roast everything and make stock when the bag is full.

I didn’t make changes because then I would t feel qualified to give it a review...but I would probably add a couple more onions. Maybe just one. Also I’d add more peppercorns.

So good! I roasted the veggies in left over bacon grease from breakfast. I know, not healthy. this made about 25 oz. of stock broth shown in the jar.  Then I blended the solids,  as someone else suggested, added some milk, Greek yogurt, and ricotta cheese to make the delicious creamy soup.

Very good recipe especially considering I had to make it without onions and garlic due to dietary restrictions. As the recipe author states, use whatever vegetables you have on hand. For me, I used 5 stalks celery, 5 carrots, 2 tomatoes, and 1 sweet potato (skin on, halved and sliced about ½ inch thickness). Roasted the vegetables in my dutch oven first. Then, added half of the roasted veggies to another pot to make a double batch of stock. Added water to both pots along with the dried parsley and bay leaves. I had fresh thyme and added 2-3 sprigs per pot. Also, added 1 sprig fresh oregano and 6 whole black peppercorns per pot. My adjustments certainly are not necessary, but were simply to adjust for missing onion and garlic. With onion and garlic, you’ll have a much more fabulous stock I’m sure without adding additional herbs. Thanks for sharing the recipe as otherwise I wouldn’t know how to make a simple vegetable stock!

This is awesome, awesome veggie stock.  The garlic really makes it, haven't used roasted garlic in stock before and I don't know why not. I sure will now! Roasting the veggies add richness, depth and color.  Definitely worth doing the roasting step.  Did not have a tomato, but I'll try to add it next time.  I drank it in a cup, piping hot, with a bit of added salt, black pepper and a sprig of fresh thyme.  Lovely.

I make gallons and gallons of vegetable stock starting in Oct. thru March.  I use turnips, cabbage, onion, squash, tomato juice, collard greens, garlic, carrots and celery. I do add two pints of homemade bone broth, and poultry seasoning per 4 gallons. After straining it I freeze it quart and pint size jars.

I made this for my husband when he had a stomach flu. He loved it and now the kids come over and take as much as I'll let them have. It's great for flu and colds. But it can get kind of expensive if you drink it like we do. I fast on it a couple of days a week, drinking up to 1/2 gallon or more a day.  I make half of it spicy for my husband and he takes it to work. It would be great if you're dieting, drinking it before meals.
