I was a little disappointed in these rice crispy treats. The end result almost tasted stale and like they had been soggy at some point, which took out the clean crisp of traditional treats. Maybe too much corn syrup? It would have been much easier and probably better tasting to just make a normal cocoa rice kripie treat, from the recipe on the back of the box.

My husband who is not a chocolate lover like I am said to give these 5 stars, not sure why.  I would give them 3. They taste like Rice Krispies with fudge in them, but the cereal gets soggy by the next day.  These are a really fast snack to put together with ingredients you would usually have in your pantry.  I would be tempted to put some peanut butter into the chocolate mixture if my husband was able to have it.  I would make these again if family requests them, but not for myself.

I ran out of regular Rice Krispies, so we used 4 cups of regular and 2 cups of regular with dried strawberries. :) Oh, and we used a 9"-square pan but we followed the rest of the recipe, and it was actually pretty good! My four-year-old loved stirring the powdered sugar in with the cereal. The strawberries added a different sort of flavour, which was kind of nice. One thing: they were REALLY hard right out of the fridge. Partly my fault with the thicker squares (which I prefer), but I found that microwaving each square for 10 seconds made them more enjoyable and softer. Thanks for sharing, Joyce!
