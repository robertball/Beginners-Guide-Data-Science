I have always doubled the marinade recipe for "Baked Teriyaki Chicken" by Marian Collins on this site when I need teriyaki sauce (that sauce has cider vinegar and has more of a bite).  "Fish and Things" was a sweeter sauce and was different for us, but still was very good. I scaled this recipe back to 12 servings and used just a little less honey than was called for.  One thing I wasn't prepared for was how fast it foams up when you add the honey...I wasn't ready for it and it spilled all over my stove.  I will definitely make sure that doesn't happen next time :o).

I thought this teriyaki was just ok.  It is EXTREMELY sweet.  It did have potential to be good, but next time I will only use half the honey and half the sugar.

this teriyaki is the bomb! my son loved it - (and he's a bit picky about teriyaki's!!)- like a few others, i added less honey, brown sugar, white sugar. if you like your teriyaki sweeter than i'd follow the original recipe..this is the homestyle asian sauce that i could never find in a bottle..brilliant!

This was a good marinade, but not unlike something you can buy in a bottle. I tried it with beef. It did make the house smell great.

Very good recipe.  Anytime I can make a sauce instead of buy it, is great.  It is sweet, but it really works great with Amber's Sesame Chicken!!  DELIGHTFUL!!  I wonder how long this keeps?  It's such a big batch so I reduced it for my family.  I also had enough left over so I used it for Almond Chicken Salad and it was a very nice addition to that recipe as well!

This is nice but as it is I found it tooth-curlingly sweet. I skipped the white sugar and halved the honey and brown sugar which left it about right for our taste. I used it first on tuna - very good. It's good on beef too with the addition of about a teaspoon of Worchester sauce.

This sauce has the basic ingredients of a typical teriyaki sauce (soy sauce, sugar, garlic and ginger). It is the amount of ingredients and additionals added in it that makes it more salty, savory or sweet. In this case this was a tad bit more on the "sweeter" side than I'd normally want in a Teriyaki sauce; however, my family liked it a lot so I gave this a 4 stars! I halved the entire amount of servings to yield 12 servings= 2 1/2 cups. I did grate the fresh ginger instead of just slicing the ginger root. The cooking method was approximate. When the mixture came to a slight boil, it rose and foamed up just as recipe stated. I then removed it from the heat and cool. I also chopped up the green onions, diagonally. I used this marinade for, "Amber's Sesame Chicken," "Almond Broccoli Stir-fry," and Orange Rice Medley," all from this website.

This makes an excellent marinade or even a base to bake/broil in. However, if you are going to cook the fish in the sauce, I would recommend leaving out one of the sweeteners. It is really too sweet otherwise. Great recipe!

I used this marinade on shrimp skewers at work and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe just as it was except I didn't have any green onions and I did use a little lemon juice to cut the saltiness of the soy sauce.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I cut both of the sugars down just a little bit, not sure if that was a good thing because this was kind of salty. Def. needs some crushed red peppers!! I used this to marinade my chicken for broccoli chicken stir-fry from this site.

This is a great recipe. Thanks for sharing it. I didn't have any green onions so I skipped those. I wanted a little extra zing, so I added red pepper flakes, a couple Tablespoons of white wine and some ketchup to thicken it up a bit. Yummy! I mixed some of this with a pound of ground beef and 3 oz. of fried onion rings from a can, grilled the burgers put cheddar cheese on top, served on a toasted bun!!! Everyone raved!!

This is a very tasty recipe.
I have used this many times for fish tacos, believe it or not.
The sweet contrast of the marinade with the spicy salsa for baha style tacos is killer.
I would recommend cutting back on the sugar and I don't use the ginger root

Yummy marinade!!!  Found out about this recipe from "Amber's Sesame Chicken".  Used it for said recipe and I almost jumped for joy on how good it tasted.  This recipe is very sweet (how I like it), but I think I will use a smidge less honey, since that overpowered it.  But still...WOW!!

This smelled really great right up until the honey was added... then it didn't smell like chinese anymore.  I'd just leave the honey out and substitute (if desired) with some other sugar.  molasses?  pancake syrup?  more brown sugar?  Also... the big pieces of green onion were too bothersome to separate from the marinating chicken, so I spooned all of the solids into the frying pan... I recommend mincing or thinly slicing the green onion... because it gets all limp and dark... looks really gross.  Also... don't marinate more than 20 minutes!  Unless you want hard, nuggets that don't have the faintest taste of chicken (or I'm guessing whatever meat you use).

Overall thought it was good... used with Amber's Sesame Chicken recipe as recommended. I cut the recipe in half, although next time I will use a bit less soy as my boyfriend and I both found it to be a little strong.

This was good.  I would cut down on the soy sauce next time I make it though, because it was very strong and covered the taste of the fish.

Made adjusting to 6 servings.  Added no white sugar and backed off honey to about 2 1/2 T based on the previous reviews.  Used a whole clove of garlic.  Also between 1/8 and 1/4 tsp. of ground ginger.  Also, didn't have the green onions.  It was still good.  Used it on fish.  I'd give it 4.5 stars except I can't make a half.

Thanks for this handy recipe!! I used a pancake syrup that was about 15% maple syrup in place of the honey. It turned out fantastic!! I've made larger batches and started using it as stirfry sauce. It is delicious, and the whole family really likes it. Thanks!

All in all, a fairly good recipe.  Works well on salmon, but we weren't crazy about it on chicken or any other type of fish.  I gave it 4 stars because it makes salmon that my husband will actually eat...a big feat.  However, I probably won't try it on anything else because we haven't been crazy about the other attempts.

Prepared this recipe in conjunction with a sesame chicken recipe found on this site. My family liked this teriyaki, especially when I used additional honey and less white/brown sugar.  Will make this sauce again.

How delicious! I halved the recipe to use with Amber's Sesame Chicken from Allrecipes and it still made a generous amount. Because my husband doesn't care for onions in any form, I used about 2 tsp of onion powder instead of the green onions. I may reduce the sugar a bit next time, but overall this is a wonderful marinade. I happened to read about it in the reviews for the sesame chicken recipe, and I'm so glad we tried it!

First off, I just found out you can't edit your review anymore.  If you do, it deletes the previous one.  :/  'Don't like that.  Anyway, back to now, I halved it usings 1c soy, 1/3c each brown & white, 1/8t ginger, 1/2cl garlic; then 1/8c each brown & white with 1/4c honey.  It managed to be too sweet & salty.  I tried diluting, too & it didn't help.  This is a marinade though, not a sauce.  All the other teriyaki recipes have sugar as half the amount of soy.  This one's more sweetener than soy.  The honey is not overpowering, but it is identifiable as an ingredient in the sauce.  Maybe 1/8c each would do the trick - using 1c soy again.  Maybe.  :)  'Made this as an ingredient for Asian Tuna (subbing leftover tilapia, btw) Patties instead of buying.  I'll try it as a marinade next week using salmon.  That seems to be everyone's favorite by the reviews.

This wasnt the recipe i was looking for, but it was good.  It reminds me of "mr. yoshida's" bottled sauce.  The color was deep brown almost black, i was looking for a honey colored sauce.  Tasted very good on steak, i imagine it would be great on chicken, or hamburgers.  I am saving the remaining sauce i have to use in other recipes requiring soy sauce for a sweeter change of taste.
