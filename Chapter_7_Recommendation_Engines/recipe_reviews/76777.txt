Great omelet with a nice Southwestern twist! I love bacon and avocado paired together so I had to give this a try. I cut this down a bit as this makes way too much for two people. I also used butter vs. Crisco (sorry) because I never cook my eggs that way and replaced the water with a little milk.  Overall, very tasty and perfect served with a little sour cream and a side of toast!

Sorry Crisco, but I just couldn't cook my eggs in Crisco, I used butter - but your recipe is good! The way the recipe is written is unclear and should be corrected - the lime juice, of course, is in the salsa, NOT in the eggs!  I had pico de gallo I had made previously, so this came together quickly. This was an interesting and very flavorful omelet.  I like the Mexican flair to it with the avocado and Monterey Jack in the omelet and the fresh salsa topping. This is a colorful and tasty breakfast omelet I'd expect to find on a restaurant menu.  I couldn't do this for breakfast every day as this is very rich -  something to refer to as an occasional treat.

Delicious! I made it without bacon because I don't eat it and without cilantro because I didn't have any but it was SO GOOD!

Totally delicious!!  That salsa is delicious!  The lime juice listed in the omelet ingredients should be posted in the salsa ingredients for a heads up.  YUM!

I recently discovered how well eggs and avocado go together. I thought, why not an omelet? Was glad to find one on AR. I pretty much followed the recipe, except used butter to cook it in, also left out the lime. Really a nice treat for brunch, the Monterey cheese is a good choice for this. I topped with some Cilantro.

This was a beautiful breakfast omelette! I didn't have any jalapeno peppers, so I added a teaspoon of hot banana pepper relish. It worked really well, definitely going to be a new 'go-to' recipe
