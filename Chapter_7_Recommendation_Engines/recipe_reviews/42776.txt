The recipe as written is vague...it should specify measurements of lemon juice and zest, especially for the novice cook--the amounts of lemon juice and zest could drastically affect the final result.  Also, I believe the ratio of cream to milk should be increased to include more cream, less milk, to ensure creaminess and avoid graininess or "iciness."  This has potential as a starting point but needs adjustments to rate any more than two stars. I made the necessary modifications and came up with a 5-star lemon ice cream.

I have a similar recipe that I make.  I set the timer and stir every 30 minutes until it is set (a couple of hours).  It's not totally solid and easy to serve.  Enjoy!

I did use an ice cream maker - just to speed things up. It was the perfect blend of tart and sweet. Such an easy recipe.

My family thought this ice cream had a nice texture and strong (not too strong) lemon taste.  I did use a small lemon and a my microplane did zest my lemon in tiny bits so I didn't need the food processor step to mix the sugar and zest.  Next time I will use only 1 half of the lemon juice in this recipe.  I did take it out of the freezer and let sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes before scooping.  Very nice color.

Really easy to make, and we all liked the lemon flavour - nice and strong! We thought it tasted like Lemon Delicious Pudding, but frozen!

I think next time i'd add some orange or lime to mix the flavours, and also, i think with most icecreams if you take them out before they fully freeze and process them again (then refreeze) you don't get any ice crystals - this recipe had a few (but not heaps).

Really nice and easy, a great first ice-cream making experience for me.

LOVED this! Based on other reviews, I cut the sugar to a little over 1/2 a cup and that was fine. Lovely, lovely lemon flavor...I wanted to eat the zest and sugar by itself...the scent was amazing! Everyone loved this...it set up and froze nicely. We'll definitely make it again!

woah, is this good stuff. but the only problem with it is that when i want to eat it, i have to take it out of the freezer and put it in the fridge for about 15 minutes because it gets a bit hard in the freezer. but other than that, this is the best (and only) icecream ive made. thanx VRMWIFE!!!

This ice cream is fabulously quick, easy and delicious. Because I had no lemons, I subbed 3 Tbsps. lemon juice, a tsp. of grated lemon peel, and a tsp. of lemon extract. To make it creamier, I used 1 1/2 cups cream and half a cup milk. I used my food processor for all the mixing. After pulsing the sugar and peel, I kept the processor on. Then I poured in the milk, cream, lemon juice and lemon extract. After about a minute, it was thick and frothy. I poured it in my Cuisinart ice cream maker, and half an hour later had a tart lemon ice cream my husband raved over.

WOW! This stuff tastes amazing! And cheaper than buying in the store too. I only changed one thing with the recipe, because my lemon zest was already grated very small, i didn't bother with the blender. I froze it overnight because i made it right before bed, and the next morning the first thing i said was, "Wow this stuff is amamzing!" Not too hard, and not too soft either. Perfect. Thank You!

Oh yeah, this is the best lemon ice cream I'm sure I'll ever eat!!  Instead of using a food processor, I grated the lemon zest on a hand grater.  Much easier.  I used the juice and zest from two lemons, and it was perfect.  It was so good, in fact, that I didn't share with my family!  They'll have to make their own ice cream...

This stuff was excellent, although the layer with the lemon peel sunk to the bottom of the pan so once it was frozen I piled it into a bowl to mix it better.  Yum!

While the lemon taste of this ice cream is delicious, it requires a few steps of preparation. It's great that you don't use the hassle of an ice cream maker, but the texture is more like a sorbet than a cream.

Very very good, my husband loved it and he is more of a chocolate person than a citrus person like me.  The recipe calls for a LARGE lemon and that is important.  I had two small lemons and made a double batch.  I mixed everything in the KitchenAid, the milk and sugar first until sugar disolved, then the lemon and zest and last the heavy cream.  Poured into an electric ice cream maker (Cuisinart) and let the fun begin!  I always sneak a taste while it churns and it was so darn good I had to carry a spoonful to hubby (on the sofa).  He usually doesn't like to be disturbed while watching fishing shows but his eyes lit up like a little boy on Christmas morning!  But, next time I must use either large lemons or twice as many small ones.  This ice cream makes a really good float with Sprite.  Very Yummy on a hot summer night.

A bit sweeter than I prefer but it was amazing, Lemon flavor was strong which me and my family loved! I did whip it a couple times during freezing like some of the other reviews suggested texture was wonderful. Will try other flavors as well soon!

I'm sure this is delicious, but I wanted to share my story.  I bought half-n-half instead of heavy cream, so I wasn't able to make the recipe that day.  However, I had my heart set on citrus ice cream.  So, I juiced a medium organic lime over a small dish of vanilla bean ice cream, then mixed it in thoroughly with my spoon.  Delicious, refreshing, simple.

I thought this was very easy to make and very flavorful.  I made this for the first time for my son and new daughter-in-law's rehearsal dinner recently. It went over OK. I'm not sure if every one was too full or for some I think it may have been too tart. I will make it again though. I did receive several compliments on it!!

Excellent recipe for homemade without an ice cream maker - and SIMPLE.  I would serve to company and to the kids.  My kids loved it!  I'm going to try it with an orange later this week, and another batch with some cocoa powder in place of the lemon - I'll keep you posted!

Great lemon flavor.  Easy to make.  Followed another reviewer's advice and reprocessed it after an hour.  Kept lemon juice, cream and milk in (refrigerator) freezer for 1/2 hour before processing to decrease freezing time.

Great ice cream. I needed a fast easy recipe that was ready to freeze in minutes. I was very pleased with my end result. However i use 1 cup cream, 1/2 cup half and half, and 1/2 cup skim milk. Thank for the great recipe!

Great Recipe! VERY easy to make, and not grainy like a couple others have said; just make sure your sugar is dissolved before adding the cream like it says! Overall prep felt like 10 minutes. Again very simple, and very delicious too.  My husband and baby love it. I also have an ice cream maker at home and didn't even need it- the recipe was MUCH faster than trying to dig that thing out and the quality was creamier. My husband's never had lemon ice cream until today and is already suggesting I whip up a large batch to keep in the freezer for a while. :)

Brilliant!  First time ever making ice cream & I'm in love.  I think I even screwed up the cream, I wasn't sure if it had gotten "stiff", but it didn't matter.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Thank you for sharing this.  I love lemon,and ice cream, and its hard to find lemon ice cream. This was easy, and just licking the spatula was
a treat. Very creamy. I used a 3 inch (2.1 oz.). I would recommend this recipe to all ice cream lovers.

I'm always looking for lemon recipes as I have a whole tree full.  I used the last lemon on my tree to try this.   Mine wasn't as tart as I would have liked but I didn't put much peel in.  I stirred it a couple times while it was setting and it's not too firm to scoop.  I didn't use a loaf pan, just left it in the ceramic bowl I mixed it up in.  Very good.  I may try it again and add some strawberrys.

This was so easy to make, it had a really good lemon flavour, will definitely be making it again! I finely grated the lemon zest and didn’t need a food processor.

Made with half and half since recipe calls for equal amounts of cream and milk. I doubled the recipe, skipped the cream whipping and folding in steps,  and used my Cuisinart ice cream maker. A wonderful light and refreshing treat.

I do not have an ice cream maker, so I really enjoyed finding this recipe.  The lemon taste is just right.  Will definitely make this again.

yummy!
I didn't blend the rind, I just left the chunks in the ice cream and it was so good.  The kids loved it.

very popular all round. Tried with 1 and 1/2 cups cream to 1/2 cup milk- very rich & creamy, minimal crystals. A winner!!

Awesome flavor, great texture.  The only problem I had was that I could not get this to freeze!  I put it in an ice cream maker for over two hours and it was still really soupy, then dropped it in the deep freeze for another 3-4 hours, and it still would not fully firm up.  I might try this again, but add some gelatin or temper some eggs in so it would freeze.  Great flavor, though!

This was very good.  It had a lovely lemon taste that I enjoy and I made it in my ice cream machine.  We will make this often.

I doubled this recipe but only used 1 lemon. Also finely grated the rind added it to the sugar and added 2Tbsp custard powder mixed in the milk and cooked it on the stove to form a custard. Let get cold in the fridge, Stired in the juice then added the cream without whipping. Poured it into the icecream maker. Yum!! turned out Delish. I love lemon icecream. This is the best yet.
