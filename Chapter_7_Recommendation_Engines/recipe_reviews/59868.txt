Try adding the following ingredients to this recipe and you will have a 'keeper': increase mayo to 3/4 cup (use light mayo, of course), 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice, 1 1/2 tsps dijon mustard (instead of powder), 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp red pepper (cayenne). Mix with yolks and crab and stuff eggs. Top eggs with a sprinkling of Old Bay or smoked paprika and snipped fresh chives, if desired.

This is great on a low-carb diet!  I added fresh ground pepper to the mix as well.  I like my deviled eggs a bit more moist and tangy, I would also add just a bit more mayo.  I had 3 halves for breakfast with a cup of coffee.  The extra filling is wonderful stuffed in celery sticks for a snack.

Very good. Also goes well with a can of shrimp instead of the crab.

If you like crab, and you like deviled egges you will love this recipe. I made this for cook-out and now I have to have these when ever there is an event. Great food. (Had to double the recipe so that some would make it to the party)

A nice change from the usual, but I thought they were missing a little something. I think Iâ€™ll try again and experiment by adding a few more ingredients. (Definitely a little more mayo for a creamier consistency.) Thanks for the good recipe!

The texture of the egg filling was not as creamy as my traditional recipe.  Next time I may add another tablespoon of mayonaise and a little more Old Bay seasoning.  A nice change of pace from traditional deviled eggs, though.

Luckily, I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and doctored up the recipe. I mixed all the ingredients and crab first, including adding more mayo, dijon mustard instead of the powder, cayenne, nixed the paprika, added a little onion powder, and loaded it with Old Bay. Kept tasting and messing with it until my base tasted like a crab cake mixture. Then I added about 3/4 of the yellows to that mixture and doctored some more until I liked the taste. I just think this is one of those recipes you have to play with and keep sampling until you get it where you want it. But the end result turned out fabulous and my guests LOVED them. Will definitely make again!

Thanks for the great idea.  I used sour cream instead of mayonaisse.

I made this as is and it was missing something. I agree w/ other reviewers about that. I also tried this recipe w/ these modifications (given by a friend): added dijon mustard, instead of mustard owder; added lemon juice, and added diced red bell pepper. Topped it off w/ parsley. This was much better.

I made this yesterday to take to a party.  I love the concept, but it just wasn't a good combination.  I added extra crab, extra cayenne, extra paprika, but it just didn't fly.  A few got eaten, but just a little embarrassing to take something to a get together that people eat only to be polite.  Thankfully I took shrimp tray!  Now that went with enthusiasm!!!  Taking this one out of my recipe box.

Filling was a bit dry, so I added an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons of mayo to make it creamier. Also added a tad more Old Bay. These were good, but I prefer traditional deviled eggs. My husband commented, "They are different, but not a keeper."

I loved this idea.  I used fresh picked crab mean instead of the store bought.  I steamed the crabs with water and vinegar and seasoned them with old bay.  The Old Bay just gave it something special and really set these over the top.

These Deviled Eggs were great! I couldn't find Old Bay Seasoning, so I left it out.  They were a hit.  A great dish for left over boiled eggs at Easter.

Tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and we served a dozen of these alongside our regular deviled eggs that my son made. The regular eggs were all gone and a 1/3 of these were left. They are more work and more expensive and really for taste not worth it. Sorry.

Great recipe, always a hit!  I add extra Old Bay and crab.  Will also add more mayo for creamier consistency. Struggled at first with peeling the eggs and having them stick to shell.  Finally learned to boil water first, then add eggs to hot water and boil for 11 min. Rinse and peel under cold water. Every egg was perfect and easy to peel!
