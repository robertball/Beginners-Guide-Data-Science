Addictive little nuggets! These are dangerous. You’ll eat them all like popcorn. I used frozen tofu and think it helped texture. If you have a deep fryer, I would suggest using that for ease. I’m going to try this in my airfryer. Thank you for the recipe.

I have made these numerous times.  It is very important to get as much water out of the tofu as possible.  When it hits hot oil it will spatter everywhere if you don't .  You could get burned badly and if it hits your floor it may cause slippery falls.
Also, instead of straight flour add lots of cornstarch and the bites will be nice and crunchy.  I use only cornstarch  with a little salt and they come out great.  You can also make a batter using soda water and they will come out puffy.

My granddaughter would like to become vegetarian or vegan. She’s recently decided she really doesn’t enjoy eating meat. I try to help her find foods she can eat to take the place of meat. I can’t believe how versatile tofu is. Thank you for this recipe. So many things you can do with these little nuggets.

Made these for lunch and they turned out great!!  Super quick and easy.  I used firm instead of extra-firm tofu bc that's what I had on hand and I added some garlic powder, onion powder, and sesame seeds to the coating.  Served them with sweet chili sauce and gochujang for dipping.  I'll definitely make these again!!

Easy to make....I made my own self rising flour too (1 cup flour plus 1.5 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp fine salt.
We used peanut sauce to di but may try tempura sauce next time as it would be lighter

These turned out okay but I found the flour taste too much and it was just not a lot of flavors

I love it, served with with a homemade peanut sauce. It was awesome  Next time I'm going to mix a little powdered sugar with the flour, make up a dipping sauce of jam mixed with cream cheese .  You can add your own little twist, I truly recommend trying  these.

Introduced my husband to tofu with this - he was not objecting with the same vehemence at the end of the meal.  :)   Easy to make and really delicious.

I would add peanuts, cilantro, and mung bean sprouts for some nice flavor and texture.
