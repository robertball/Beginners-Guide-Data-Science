This recipe was awesome! I changed just a couple things: I didn't have two cans of cream of celery so I used one can of cream of celery and one can of cream of chicken. I then added a layer of frozen peas on top of the soup mixture before putting the stuffing on top. It was very tasty and filling. I would highly recommend and will definitely be making it again!

this recipe is really easy to put together and the soup really adds a lot of flavor. i would recommend eliminating the celery or boiling it first, otherwise it's too crunchy. also try  adding more chicken unless you only  want to eat stuffing.

Great recipe. My wife who dislikes casseroles really enjoyed it. Next time I am going to use Turkey instead of chicken and I found the left-overs to be excessively salty. I'm going to cut all the salt from the recipe as I'm sure the stuffing has more than its share.

My 12yo daughter actually made this because she wanted a turn making dinner.  She used frozen chicken breasts, cooked them up with some sauteed onion, adobo seasoning, salt and pepper; then cut them into small pieces... because she added the fresh onion, she eliminated the dried onion and celery.  Although we never tried it the 'original' way, my family LOVED this recipe... and we will be having it again and again!

This is the best recipe I've tried thus far and it is GREAT!  My fiancee and I both love it.  I couldn't find cream of celery, but it was still delicious using cream of chicken as a substitute. 

Thank you so much for sharing this!!!

Yum-O!  Will definitely make again.  If you use Stove Top Stuffing do not add any extra salt.  It is plenty salty as is.  Very good and easy recipe.  I did leave the chicken breast whole so everyone could have one.

did a lot of improvising as I made this at the last minute--but it turned out great!  Had 5 small breasts, which when cooked (from partially frozen) measured 3 cups - used 8x8 pan, 1 box of stuffing and 12 oz. of Healthy Request Cr. of Mush. soup (no need to add milk) and did not add extra salt--baked for 30 min.  Served 3-4 generously.  I thought stuffing looked a little skimpy when spread on, so I lightly sprinkled italian bread crumbs over the stuffing and pressed lightly--worked great!  Rave reviews at home.

I just finished eating this dinner.  This is a definite keeper!  I didn't have the exact ingredients, so I substituted 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of broccoli soup for the celery soup.  I eliminated the chopped celery and added celery seed instead, and also added 1 can of peas, drained.  I eliminated the additional salt as others had suggested.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  I think the next time that I make this, I will add fresh mushrooms and broccoli florets.  Absolutely delicious!

This recipe was really good. The entire family really enjoyed it and the leftovers were great too. I used 1 can of cream of celery and 1 can cream of chicken just because it was what I had on hand. I also did not add celery because of personal preference. Definite keeper thank you!

This recipe is so easy it's ridiculous.  I used the low-sodium stuffing mix, didn't add any additional salt, and didn't miss it.  Since it's basically chicken in sauce with stuffing, everybody liked it.

Good recipe for a cold, rainy April evening. You can pretty much add anything to this, particularly veggies. Water chestnuts add extra crunch. I think some color would be nice-- maybe I'll add red peppers next time. I served this with mashed potatoes.

It was an easy and tasty dish.  I was able to make taste preference adjustments and still preserve the integrity of the dish.  The only downside is that this is a VERY salty dish. Salt with caution!!!

This recipe hit the spot!  This is the second time I've followed this recipe, but I think it was better this time!  It was only two of us, so I made two chicken breasts, left whole and one chicken breast was enough for my bf and I.  Now we have lunch for tomorrow!  I made the Stove Top as directed, but the directions call for butter and I just omitted that.  I mixed one can of cream of chicken soup, pepper, and a little less than 1/4 cup  milk (these are all portions based on 2 servings).  I only had a stalk and a half of celery left so I used that, next time I would like to add more, then added the celery and a slice of onion, diced into the stuffing.  For assembly, I did mine differently:  I sprayed two large pieces of tin foil with Pam, coated the chicken with a bit of pepper, Adobe, and dried chopped onion then put that on the foil.  Next to the chicken, I added half the stuffing mixture and topped that with frozen peas.  I then covered it all with the cream mixture, making sure the entire chicken was coated.  Last, I folded the sides and top in so it could cook in the foil.  I ended up cooking the chicken on 375 degrees from 45 minutes.  Amazing!  The only thing I will change next time is no onion in the stuffing mixture and less milk.

Fantastic recipe Alice! Made it just as you listed. Next time I'll add peas but I'm not changing anything else. My husband who is always leery of trying new recipes, actually went for seconds! This is already filed in my recipe box.  Very quick and easy and great to whip up after work. Thank you so much for sharing.

Wonderful!  Even added the 1/4 tsp salt as the recipe indicated and I did not find it to be too salty as others have said.  Very tasty recipe!  Instead of using the stuffing as the cover, I blended it with the soup mixture a wee bit before adding to the oven.  It turned out beautifully moist!

I doubled this recipe and baked it in a 12x20 steamtable pan for a bingo crowd, and they gobbled it up!  I added 1 large chopped fresh onion, combined it with the celery and sauteed both in butter before adding it to the recipe. Also, before I added the soup mixture, I sprinkled two cups sharp cheddar cheese over the chicken. This crowd of ladies is particularly difficult to please, but they loved this!  Great recipe that I'll be making again and again for the bingo babes and at home for my family!

It is great when a recipe is exactly as advertised. This is easy to make and it is GREAT! We have added it to our "permanent" list.  May try and substitute cream of mushroom soup for cream of celery, but the recipe as is gets an A+.

This was really good - and I even forgot to cook the stuffing before putting it on!  I accidently sprinkled it dry on top then re-read the recipe - so I poured a cup of chicken broth mixed with about 3 T of butter right on top of the whole casserole and it turned out fine - the stuffing had a bit of crunch still to it which my kids liked - I served it with some rice.  thanks so much!

Easy and fast dinner.  I sauteed the diced chicken with one small chopped onion.  I eliminated the chopped celery since my husband doesn't like it and the minced onion since I used fresh.
Next time I might leave the chicken whole instead of dicing it, as I found myself searching for the chicken.  I would also leave out the salt.  The chicken and stuffing has plenty of salt already.

I left out the celery and onion because I used stovetop stuffing. I also had some provolne cheese I had to get rid of so I added it on top. I covered it while it baked so the cheese would melt. Wow, what a good meal. My 9 year old daughter loved it. I even had 2 helpings and wanted more. Thank you for posting.

Super easy and good. I only used half the amount of stuffing and thought that there was plenty. Used one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of chicken. Omitted the salt and celery all together due to preference. Served over rice with green beans on the side. Made for a nice lunch surprise for husband at work.

This was pretty good.  I made a batch and a half to feed a group of Boy Scouts at a pot luck last night and I brought home a clean pan.  It's good for a gathering like that, but I don't think I'd make it for dinner for just my family.  Maybe after Thanksgiving with home-made dressing???  That sounds much better.

Easy, quick, and kid friendly! I used a rotisserie chicken, an 8oz Stovetop Stuffing mix, and one can of mushroom soup, then halved the milk and other ingredients. Yummy and boy did it smell good while it was baking. I had everybody's mouths watering. Every mother's dream...along with easy clean up!

Ok recipe, the leftovers didn't stay well or reheat well.  My husband & I don't care for celery so I subbed for two cream of chickens, it was good.  I don't think I'll be making it again because my husband said it reminded him of "chicken and dressing lunches at school".  No thanks!

I purposely altered this recipe to better suit my taste and because I was half asleep when I found the recipe this morning.  :o)  I used the meat from a rotissere chicken, frozen vegetables and cheddar cheese.  I didn't use any salt, but I think it needs just a tad.  I made this for the guy I'm dating and we both loved it.  Thank you.  Will make again.  Go Pats!

Following the recipe will only get you 2 1/2 stars.  For the full 5 stars make your own dressing and use cream of chicken soup.  Toss in some sage when you are cooking your chicken and add a little chicken oxo to boost the flavour.

Nice, easy, basic chicken casserole.  Made it exactly as the recipe stated with a little Old Bay for added flavor.  All three consumers thought it was great.  I'll be adding this into our regular rotation.

This was really tasty but I must have done something wrong...I think the stuffing is supposed to be made already? It was really crunchy. Next time (I will make it again) I think I will moisten the stuffung before I put it in the oven so it will be a little more moist. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T and it was pretty good.

I probably shouldn't state that I made this recipe, as I didn't use a main ingredient here, condensed soup. But I had a 12 oz bag of stuffing mix in my pantry since Thanksgiving and I needed a recipe to use it up. I was inspired by the idea of layers of cooked chicken, creamy sauce and bread stuffing. Since I didn't have the canned soup ( rarely buy that stuff), I substituted 3 cups of homemade Bechamel sauce. I poached 4 chicken breasts and used the broth from that (2 cups) along with 1 cup of milk to make the Bechamel. Also, I went ahead and sauteed the onions and celery in the butter (3 tbsp) for the Bechamel, before adding the flour (3 tbsp). Some salt and pepper and poultry seasoning seemed to be the right spices for this. I KNOW , these are a lot of changes, but It really made a delicious comfort food. And I decided to post this review for the cooks who, like me, want to try this recipe but don't have or don't want to use the canned soups.

Good, but WAY too salty. I even skipped the salt. There's probably such a thing as low-salt canned soup. I'd try that next time. I'm sure my broth was low-salt. I'd cut the salt wherever I could. Other than that, it was tasty. And, I got rid of the stuffing in my pantry! Thank you for sharing.

I like this recipe.  My family did not care for it.  I added poultry seasoning to it and like another reviewer sauted the celery and onions in butter then added it in.  I enjoyed but probably won't make again because my DH and kids did not.

This is one of my new favorite comfort foods. Delicious.  I didn't change a thing, although next time I'll follow the advice of previous reviewers and omit the extra salt. Stove Top stuffing is pretty salty on it's own.

Love this recipe!  What a great way to have a real home cookin type meal even on the days you don't have time.  This one goes into regular rotation.  So easy when you  pre-cook your chicken ahead.

My husband and I really liked this recipe!  It was so easy to do, but to save time, I put my chicken and celery in the crockpot before I left for work that morning.  Then I just shredded the chicken up and put it in the bottom of the pan with the celery.  Cooking the celery with the chicken like this gave it a great taste and made sure that it wasn't crunchy.

Great recipe.  I buy a whole roasted chicken from the store and pick it apart.  I also add a small can of mushrooms to the mix.
