Ok - these were good but I had to make some adjustments to make them taste how I thought they should. This recipe alone was good but I replaced the cream with sour cream and added a touch of milk. Also I put all of the potatoes into a baking dish sprinkled with cheddar cheese and poured 3T. of melted margarine over the top...then they were DELICIOUS!!!!! Thanks.

These potatoes were very good but a little bit too thick for my tastes. I only put in half of the cream cheese and used milk instead of heavy cream. They were very tasty and I will add some ranch seasoning to my potatoes again but if I use the cream cheese I will add more milk.

Good recipe. The ranch does add a little something. Just be careful to taste before you add salt.

These weren't bad-I think I could've cut back on the cream cheese-the taste of it was a little overwhelming. But my husband loved them and now prefers them over my regular mashed potatoes. Next time I'll cut back on the cream cheese a little and maybe add a little bit of butter.

They were a HIT! A nice twist on an old standard. My wife and son went nuts for them. The new ingredients were a nice subtle enhancement and did not overwhelm the natural flavor of the potatoes. Excellent!

These tasted pretty good but were too rich and fattening for me. I felt like I was clogging an artery with every bite I took! I could definitely go for a healthier version of this recipe.

Excellent! A more flavorful version of mashed potatos. I used a little bit less of the cream cheese and added a small amount of milk instead!

I had an envelope of ranch dressing mix that I ended up not using for another recipe and so I went looking for a recipe I could use it in... This is what I got. I used reduced-fat cream cheese I also used 1% milk instead of heavy cream. They were pretty good. Not as ranch flavored as I expected but nicely seasoned and this recipe made mass amounts.

I really like ranch but my family and I didn't think this recipe had much flavor. If you don't like it not to worry. I added cheese sour cream onions and butter and it turned out great!

These were okay but I probably won't make them again. Will stick with traditiona; garlic or plain butter.

My daughter liked these as well as my husband. I thought they were O.K. but needed something else. I think I would rather stick with butter and garlic. Had to add a lot more milk to get to a better consistency. Still it went well with our filet mignons -- I just won't be making it again.

Delicious! I used low fat cream cheese and skim milk to lower the calories but still tasted great! The only thing I will change is buying a different ranch mix next time the generic one I bought gave too much of an onion flavor. Will definitely make again!!!

These potatoes were really good. They are a good idea when you want mashed potatoes with no gravy.

Tasty but way too salty. If I made these again I would use regular ranch dressing instead of the ranch package dressing. I used low fat cream cheese.

I usually use flavored cream cheese but this time I had plain and was looking for something to add flavor to my mashed potatoes. Found this recipe - pretty good for a change! Very easy too. Thanks for sharing!

Very good potatoes. They're SOMEWHAT similiar in taste to another ranch mashed potatoe recipe found on this site but still good. I used only 4oz cream cheese (which was all the cream cheese I had left after splitting a block to make Four Season Enchiladas earlier this week) but still turned out good. Thanks Erica.

I did add a little butter and hot milk to the potatoes when I mashed just for fluffier and a little thinner mashed potatoes. I also used a homemade dry ranch dressing mix. We loved these--ate every single bite. NO leftovers.

I fixed these potatoes this year for Easter. They were really good. My son wanted to take the leftovers home and I had to hide them from him so we could have them the next night. They are a keeper in my home.
