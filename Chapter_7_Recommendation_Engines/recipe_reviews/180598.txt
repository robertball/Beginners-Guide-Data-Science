Perfect BUT...you need to make some modifications: 1. classic shortbread has salt and NO VANILLA. Switch out the 1/4 tsp vanilla for 1/4 tsp salt.  2. the crumble has too much of an uncooked flour taste. Cut back to 1/3 C and add 1/3 C brown sugar and 1/4 tsp salt.   I also baked these for 10 minutes longer than directed so the topping would slightly brown.

Pumpkin Shortbread bars rule!  My husband and I love this recipe!  I made just a few changes, such as I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of ginger, cloves and nutmeg.  I also used 1 can of pumpkin instead of 1 cup.  I put the pecans in the topping, not in the pumpkin batter.  I will be making this again and again!!  Thanks for sharing!

I was hopeful, but then sadly dissappointed in this recipe.  The shortbread wasn't sweet enough for my liking, as it ended up tasting more like pie crust.  Overall i thought this was good, it just wasn't what I was looking for based on the name.  I added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice to the pumpkin mix, and added the nuts in with the topping.  The topping needs less flour: 1/3 c flour, 1/3 c white sugar, 1/3 c brown sugar worked great.  I used an 8x8 pan because i didn't think i could get the crust spread out in the bigger pan.  I ended up cooked for 10 min longer because of the thickness.  If you're looking for a pumpkin pie bar, this woud work.  I'll keep searching for a better use for pumpkin.

These were yummy, I was a little disappointed in the topping.  It seemed like too much flour.  I would have preferred it a little less floury.  Next time I make it I will use 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar and maybe a little more butter and less flour.

This recipe is phenomenal! The things I did differently were the crust and the topping. It seemed so thin with the original crust recipe so I made another half batch. With advice from other viewers, I cut back the flour from the topping a bit. I also added some brown sugar to the topping. I added about a 1/3 cup brown sugar and then used about 1/4 cup white sugar. It was absolutely perfect! Family loved it; and, my co-workers (some who do not even like pumpkin) LOVED IT! THANKS!

Easy and simple. I add some cinnamon and nutmeg to the pumpkin mix.  I took the reviewers advice in using 1/3 c flour, 1/3 c sugar, and 1/3 c brown sugar for the topping.

I would have liked to give 4.5 stars.  Changed the topping slightly to even out the flour/sugar (more like a cobbler topping), but everything else was fabulous!!

5 stars, with modifications. I used a large jellyroll pan (11x17), tripled the crust and doubled the filling and the topping.    To be more like a traditional shortbread, I substituted an equal amount of salt for vanilla. I think I could have gotten away with just a doubled crust, but some reviewers felt they didn't have enough crust so I went with a tripled batch.   I added a total of about 1 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice to the doubled filling.  I think it could use a little more, but it's all I had.  Didn't have pecans so left them out.  As with other reviewers, I cut the flour in the topping down to just 1/3cup and added 1/3cup brown sugar.  Then doubled the whole thing.  After baking the crust, I forgot to turn my oven down to 350F but it ended up baking just fine at 400F for 25 minutes.

Thees were pretty good, I used splenda instead of sugar and they still tasted good.  However, after a day they tasted not as good, it's like the taste went away

I was expecting more of a crumble to go on top and it was dry and floury.  The topping amount seemed out of proportion for the other two layers.  I don't think this worked quite right.

I too found these to have a very heavy flour taste. I agree the topping was probably the reason.  I think I would go with something crunchier more cinnamon flavored.  I think the pumpkin layer needs some added spices, the usual pie ones.  You never know until you try.

Everything came out fine except for the topping; I think there's something wrong with the measurements in this recipe. No way do you need that much flour in the topping. I'd make this again if I had a better topping.

Amazing!  A great way to eat vitamin A!  I followed the advice from the other reviews ( less flour for the crumb mix and salt instead of vanilla, and some brown sugar for the crumb).   I also doubled the shortbread and the crumb mix.

Yum! I could tell by reading the ingredients that the topping included too much flour and the filling needed the addition of a "fall" spice. After reading the reviews and looking at the photos, I decided to go with "footballgrl16" review and make the bars exactly as she recommended. I am so glad I did. Everyone loved the taste/texture combinations and I recived many compliments. It reminded some of a pumpkin pie. I wouldn't hesitate to make these again exactly like this batch. Thanks for sharing!

I really should have read the reviews again. Because i made the recipe to a t and i felt like there wasn't enough crust or filling for that size of a pan so i made it in a 9x9 pan and still feel like there wasn't enough crust. Plus i should've added the fall spices, like cinnamon and nutmeg. But it's all good, it still tasted good.

This recipe for the 9 x 13 pan yielded a very thin bar.  I would have liked the pumpkin layer to be thicker.  I followed the advice of previous reviewers and cut the flour in the topping down to one third cup and even then still found it to be a bit floury.  Sorry but I don't think I'll be making this again.

I loved this!  I love pumpkin when it has a mild flavor.  For this reason, pumpkin pie is usually not my favorite.  This was a great hit at my party for pumpkin lovers and non-lovers alike.  Like other reviewers, I also modified the topping mix to have a little more butter and sugar.  I used brown sugar, white sugar, flower, butter and old fashioned oats.  I just started and kept going until it tasted right.  I think mine ended up making more topping than what the recipe called for, but I think that would be better anyway.

Not my favorite.  I was on a baking roll and this is just one of several deserts around the house and for my family at least it was the one ignored.

This was okay, but a lot less pumpkin flavored than I thought.  Next time I would add some more pumpkin puree.  Also I didn't see the suggestion about adding cinnamon and nutmeg until after I made these.  Next time I will add the spices.  Also I think the measurements for the topping were a little off.  Less flour was needed.  

All in all in was tasty but could have had more of a pumpkin taste!

This is pretty good.  I was surprised there was no spices in this recipe so I added my own. The usual pumpkin spices.  If I had not added any this recipe would have been a huge fail, with no flavour in my opinion.

When I read through this recipe I questioned a few things...the amount  of flour in the crumble and the size of pan 9×13.
I made some changes in how I made it based on my baking knowledge.I didn't want to make as written knowing id be a bit disappointed.
Made mine in an 8×8 pan lined with parchment (makes it easier to remove from pan once cooled and slice). Reduced the flour in the crumble by half to 1/2 cup. Also added a teaspoon of pumpkin spice to the wet mix. 
Cooked the crust for 15 minutes and the entire dish afterwards for 35.
I'm so glad I made these in a smaller pan.honeatly I don't known how you can spread all that crust in a larger pan. My bars came out nice and thick and fluffy...just like I wanted.
IF you don't want a flat bar use smaller pan.

This recipe was obviously not made in a 9 x 13 pan as written to show the picture. Crust ingredient proportions are wrong, there is little flavor to the pumpkin and there was way too much flour in the topping, also lacking flavor. White flour, white sugar and butter do not make a great crumb topping in those proportions.
I had to search for other recipes, most of which were variations/copies of this one.

These were so good.  For topping, I did use less flour and added the pecans.

Those are awsome! The only mistake I did was to store them in the fridge, they were kind of mushy the next day and the filling was more hard. Otherwise excellent recipe!

My boys love these treats! I also added 1tsp cinnamon, /4 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. Reducing the flour in the topping mix is necessary. A keeper for sure!

These bars were easy and simple to make.  My kids loved them!  Personally, I think I used too much pumpkin (my can was 796mL) so perhaps next time I will double the shortbread base or use half a can of pumpkin.  
I took the advice of another reviewer and omitted the vanilla from the shortbread and added salt.  As well as decreased the amount of flour in the topping.  I will add nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon to the pumpkin next time as well for added flavour but otherwise, I will make these again.

No spices were included in this recipe. I added nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger. Still, the brown sugar gave it a strange taste. Could have used the whole can of pumpkin.  Thicker cookie crust but little pumpkin.

It was delicious.  I only read the reviews later to adjust the flour in the crumble I cooked  it just like the recipe, and my hubby and i devoured it in a few days so divine I'm making it again this weekend.

These are easy and tasty. I put salt in the shortbread rather than vanilla. I used a whole 15 oz can of pumpkin. Added some allspice to the pumpkin mix and reduced the sugar to 2/3 C. Topping modified to 1/3 C flour, 1/3 C brown sugar, and 1/4 C butter with a bit more allspice. Used a 8x13 pan and it’s a thin bar, but I like that way.

These are a tasty bar that is somewhat different from the usual bar.  I did take the others recommendations & totally agree with them.  They are:  add 1/4 tsp salt to shortbread layer;  add 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice to middle pumpkin layer;  in top crumble layer, decrease flour to 1/2 cup and add 1/2 cup brown sugar in its place.

These are pretty good, but would be very thin bars if you use a 9 x 13 pan. I used a 9 x 9 and my own crust-- 1 1/3 c flour, 1/2 c butter and 1/4 cup sugar. I used a  15 oz can of pumpkin and added more pumpkin pie spices to the filling.  I also changed the topping as many suggested to 1/3 flour, 1/3 brown sugar, 1/3 white sugar and 4 tbsp of butter...   Oh, and I added the pecans to the topping mixture... Baked for 35-38 min. due to pan variation. I think these may be even better chilled.

loved the taste of this recipe but I feel like for my personal taste the recipe needs to be adjusted to have less crust and less toppings and more pumpkin filling.

Easy and good!  I did add cinnamon & nutmeg to the pumpkin because I love those spices with my pumpkin.  I increased the butter in the topping because there just seemed to be too much flour.  They worked out fine in the 9x13.  I will be making these again!

One of my favorite recipes!  Only modifications:  Made double the amount of shortbread, and followed the advice of a reviewer and made the crumble with 1/3 c flour, 1/3 c sugar, and 1/3 c brown sugar

Delicious, but I followed some others suggestions and made a couple changes to the recipe. Depending on your pan, you may have to cook a little longer so the topping is browned.
1. Shortbread has salt and no vanilla.  Switched out 1/4 tsp vanilla for 1/4 tsp salt.
2. For crumble, cut back to 1/3 cup of flour and add 1/3 c brown sugar and 1/4 tsp salt
3. Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the pumpkin mix
4. Cut brown sugar in pumpkin mix to 3/4 cup

Super bar - very rich, but delicious! I used the whole can of pumpkin but didn't increase the sugar, and it was perfect.  I also added salt to the shortbread crust (but also kept the vanilla, since I like vanilla!) and decreased the flour for the topping.  In my opinion, the topping was good, but there should have been more.

I loved these bars! I added some of the traditional pumpkin or spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves) to the pumpkin mixture to give it a little extra zing. Next time I make them, I think I'm going to grind the pecans up very finely and put them in with the topping at the end instead of in the pumpkin mixture.

The short...very yummy! The long, I started off with one batch of crust but had to end up making 3. Turns out 3 is just a tad too much, 1 is not enough. 2 Will be perfect when I make them again. Filling definitely needed some spices. I'm glad I read reviews. I ended up adding 1 tsp each of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. Definitely cut WAY back on the flour for the topping. I did 1/3 C as someone else suggested. It was a bit time consuming for me although simple. Will be a nice change for Thanksgiving. Thank you for sharing.
