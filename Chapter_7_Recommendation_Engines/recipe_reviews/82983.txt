Made for the first time today and it came out great.  I marinated the london broil using a package of McCormick's Chipotle Pepper marinade.  I put it in a ziploc baggie overnight in the refrig.  Put in casserole dish and poured a can of diced tomatoes over top.  Covered with foil and baked it for 2 1/2 hours at 325.  Best London broil I've ever made.  Usually comes out tough no matter how I make it, this was tender and flavorful.  Great recipe.  Will make again and again.  Thanks!

Tender and delicious.I am not a big meat eater at all and I ate 2 helpings of this. I seasoned the meat first on both sides with salt, pepper and Grill Sensations Lemon Garlic seasoning, then I added the tomatoes and seasoned some more. I also added water to the pan. I will definitely make this again.

This turned out great.  Was very easy to prepare.  Although I sliced onion and red peppers and placed on top of london broil then seasoned with a bunch of my favorite seasonings.  Put about half a cup of water to the bottom of my roasting dish and cooked covered at 325 for about 3 hours.  Yummy, tender and moist.

This was delicious and easy! I took the others suggestions and added 2 TBSP. Soy Sauce and I also used diced tomatoes, of which one can was a tomato and sweet onion mix which was perfect! The meat cooked up perfectly and was so tender! All of my kids loved it and went back for seconds, even my pickiest eater! I can't wait to pass this recipe on to my sister, mom and grandma, they are going to love it! Thanks!

I added 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, crushed black pepper, 2 teaspoons of italian seasoning and 2 tablespoons of A1 to the top of the meat and mashed it in. I also put the meat in a deep, oven safe dish so that the entire cut of meat was covered in the canned tomatos (I used diced tomatos). The meat came out very tender. It was excellent. We are going to have this again. I recommend green beans and orzo pasta with this.

You really need to like tomatoes for this recipe (which I do)! My kids however are a different story. I took another reviewers suggestion & made a heavy duty foil tent placing the ingredients inside & closing it really well (leave room for steam to circulate). I also cooked it at 325. Very moist & tender. I used petite diced tomatoes w/green chiles. When serving slice it as thin as you can. Really good! Made great sandwiches the next day.

This came out pretty good, if a little overdone. The tomato flavor was really intensified and I amd not sure I would use them again. I found it confusing that the directions said to roast for 2 1/2 to 3 hours and yet the cook time in the description says 2 hours. (which is what I cooked it for) And it would be nice for the inexperienced cooks if the directions told you to put a lid on it. But ... it was still the the least tough london broil I've ever had and I will try this again with a different liquid for less time.

This is a very tasty recipe. We always get london broil on sale and I never know what to do with it especially when I don't want to get the grill going!
You definitely have to cover this and add some more water to the pan. I added 1/2 cup water and ended up adding some more. I also cooked on 350 for 3 hours.

This simple recipe suprised me.  The tomatoes enhanced the flavor of the london broil and made it taste more like a shoulder roast.  Quite good.

I made this after I had taken advantage of a "Buy one, get one free" sale on London Broil.  This was surprisingly quick and easy!  The meat came out absolutely tender and if it had a bone, the meat would have fallen off!

I used this recipe today but I used a different sauce. I cooked the London Broil as directed, but my boyfriend hates tomatoes so I used a sauce from a different recipe. The sauce was 1 bottle of 8oz. italian dressing, 1 pkg of dry onion soup mix, 1/2 c. ketchup and one can (10.5oz.) beef gravy. Mix all together and you have an amazing marinade. I let the beef marinade in this over night and then I put it in a baking dish poured the marinade over top and put the foil on top and baked for 2 hours at 325 degrees. Turned out so tender and fantastic taste!!!

I had left over homemade stewed tomatoes that I didn't want to go to waste so this recipe was great for that.  The flavor was good but not sure how you can cook a london broil for 3 hours at 350.  After 1.5 hours it was way over done.  I guy in Texas thought it was the lack of humidity but I'm in PA and had the same problem.  I have a separate thermometer in the oven too so the temp was correct.

This was by far the best london broil I ever made. I used 1 can of beef broth and other spices to our liking. I marinaded it in a ziplock bag in the fridge for 2hrs. I also added fresh mushrooms to the bag and chopped garlic. I roasted it, covered w/tin foil tight, in the oven, at 350 for 2 1/2 hours.I would occasionaly stir the liquid to make sure the meat was covered. After 1 1/2hrs, I added 6 med red potatoes to the liquid. The last 45mins I covered it with stewed tomatoes. My husband said it was the best he ever had. Make sure the liquid covers the meat, that is the secret to its tenderness!

I could never get london broil to be tender, and this worked great! I used 1 small can of diced tomatoes with okra, 3 small sliced onions on top, cayenne, salt, added some burgundy wine, covered with heavy duty foil and cooked on 325F for 2,5 hours like others suggested. Tender and juicy, it will probably be the only way I will cook london broil from now on - any sauce can be used, possibilities are endless! This is extremely easy and no-fail recipe - THANK YOU SO MUCH!

This one is the best. We love tomatoes too, so that helps. This makes the london broil so tender and tasty! I do add beef boullion to it while cooking. It really give the tomatoes flavor and the broil too.

I made this last night and it turned out fantastic.  I used two organic grass-fed london broils.  I used a can of organic whole tomatoes.  I sliced the tomatoes into medium size chunks.  I sprinkled on some garlic powder and pepper.  Baked it for 3 hours at 350 degrees covered with aluminum foil.  During the last five minutes on top of the london broil I sprinkled basil, pepper, and garlic powder.  Covered it back up and cooked for the remaining five minutes.  The london broil came out so tender and juicy.  My husband loved it as well.  On the side I made a Greek Green Beans recipe on this site and it matched up well with the london broil.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was really good.  I had a London Broil in the freezer for quite a while and wanted to use it, but much like other reviewers, it was not Grilling weather.  I found this recipe and gave it a try.  It was good.  Baked for about 4 hours and it just flaked apart.  I used one smaller can of Tomatoes because that is what I had, a small amount of V8 juice and soy sauce and minced garlic. That is it and it smelled and tasted really great.  Will make again.

This was great! I did rub lemon pepper seasoning on the London broil before cooking, for a bit more flavor and added some chopped onion as well.  I also cooked it in the crockpot, on high for 4 hours. Turned out great and I was able to "forget" about cooking dinner.

I don't have the planning skills to start dinner early in the day, so I count on my pressure cooker a lot!. This came out really good. I used one can of stewed tomatoes, 1 cup of water, a pkg. of onion soup mix and a clove of crushed garlic.  For those of you who don't have a pressure cooker, I highly recommend getting one. Meat comes out amazingly tender - no matter what cut you use --and so fast. The key is lots of liquid. I always brown the meat first - it makes a huge difference. Unlike a slow cooker, it's best to cook your veggies separately, as they tend to get mushy.

I thought this was very good and it smelled so yummy while cooking.  A small taste through the cooking process revealed meat that seemed too dry to me, but I used convection cooking on my oven which I know nothing about, but I didn't have 3 hours to cook this so I cooked at 350 for 1 1/2 hours.  This is kind of like a roast, but with a better cut of meat. I made it exactly as stated, except that I added  cut up fresh carrots.  I made mashed potatoes with this & the potatoes dipped in the tomato sauce were very tasty!  Adding the carrots saved me cooking a veggie separately.  My family really liked this.  It's a very easy meal & a keeper for me.

Good basic recipe.  We get a lot of BOGO London Broils, and I look for new ways to make them.  I used a can of diced tomato with green chilis and it was very good.

Bland, came out very watery and had no taste to it.  The tomato taste was 'different' and I could see incorporating it into a different dish but by itself it was just... bland

Good solid recipe. Don't overcook. Don't skimp on liquid to keep the beef moist.

I did a major variation of this recipe.  First I poked the meat with a fork repeatedly, then massaged in French Onion Soup Mix onto the top of the meat.  Instead of tomatoes, I used a red wine mixture (1/2 cup red wine with 1/4 cup water) which I poured over the meat and it soaked in.  I found using a gas stove the cooking time was much reduced--300 degrees for 1 1/2 hours and that was for well done.  Next time I'll cook it even less!

My family just loved this!!! The best part was how easy it is to prepare and just pop it in the oven. To add a some different flavor I used some stewed (you can use diced) tomatoes with the onion, garlic and bell pepper allready in it! It saved time having to cut all of that up. GREAT!!!!!

I did not get the expected results.  The tomatoes dried out and the meat was dry and tough.  I may have done something wrong and would be willing to try it again if I could figure it out.

Tender and juicy as it gets. I set the oven at 325 and kept it in for 2 hours. Some people said it came out dry, but I kept if covered the whole time and it came out great. Added some onions this time, but I plan on experimenting with different spices next time.

This was easy and VERY tasty! I also added carrots, green peppers and onions. As it cooked I added some beef broth. The last hour I added red wine. I had to cover it with foil half way through because it started to dry out. But it breaks apart with a fork and the taste is really good.

I had qualms about this, thinking it seemed too easy, but it is just that!  I put the meat in the oven frozen and it only took an extra 30 minutes.  I've made it twice now, this time I used thick cut sirloin steaks and it still turned out shreddy.  Ate it over salted potatoes from this site, added a little butter to make a somewhat mashed consistancy.  I add extra veggies, this time I put celery and onion on before the canned tomatoes.  Bell peppers next time, methinks!!  This recipe will replace swiss steak for us!  And I 've used a 9x13 pan both times with foil, no fancy roasting pan :)

5 stars for very easy and very good.  I had a couple of one pound london broils and this was a great way to cook them.  Turned out very tender.  I did it pretty much like the recipe except I put a little bit of Bragg's Liquid Aminos over the meat in a baking dish and seasoned with a little garlic powder and cracked pepper.  Left it in the frig to marinate for an hour or so.  Then opened up a can of tomatoes and dumped it on top, covered it with foil, and put it in the oven for 2 1/2 hours at 350.   Sooooo easy and very good.  I have leftovers that will make a great soup today too.  Thanks for this post.

This was very good.  My whole family liked it.  However, I used, 1 can of tomatos with green chilis, and added a green onion.  I guess mine was a smaller london broil because the meat was done in 1 hour and 15 minutes. EXCELLENT!!!

This was the easiest London Broil I've made. I used diced tomato with garlic. I didn't do anything else special. I would have like for it to be not so well done, but my husband likes his beef well done.  He really enjoyed it. When he put the last piece in his mouth, he said make this again.

I was alway's from the old school. Marinate overnight grill & hope it won't be tough. I did this at 325 degrees, one can tomato , one sliced onion and baked covered for 2 1/2 hours. To DIE for! Looking forward to next time but may try 300 degrees for medium.

Okay, firstly, this mostly just tasted like stewed tomatoes. That being said, it was pretty good. (I like stewed tomatoes, but I'm not their biggest fan.) It was definitely tender! I am used to a London Broil on the grill, but as it's the middle of winter I looked for a new recipe. Considering London Broil is on sale, this is not a bad way to go. Would make again, and modify seasonings to my mood, but all in all, not a bad way to go.

I've made this several times......Always sooooo good!!!!

This time I sprayed the roasting pan and seared the meat before putting it in the oven.

I also added some green pepper and onion to the tomatoes.

Next time:
Seared meat and 2 links sweet Italian sausage in cast iron pan and added to slow cooker.  Lightly seared red peppers, orange peppers and onion in pan and added to slow cooker. 
Covered with 1 can diced tomatoes. Cooked on high approximately 6 hours.

I do not like tomato taste, but I use tomatoes in many recipes and love the end result.  This recipe absolutely makes tender meat, but I cooked it 10 minutes longer, and it was very, very dry.  It will make good sandwiches, but I just didn't like it as much as I anticipated.  I did soak it overnight in the tomatoes, and this could have cause it to be dry, but it was very dry.  Great sandwich meat.  Marginal dinner meat.  I doubt I will use it again.

Very easy, but you get out of this recipe about what you put into it. I rubbed the meat with salt and pepper, and added garlic powder, onion, oregano and basil to the tomatoes, but still the meat was bland. Tender, yes, but bland as all get out. This recipe has a good technique for cooking the london broil, but in terms of flavor, it needs alot of help.

As a beginner cook who has no idea how to cook beef, this was a flop - husband said it was tough to chew.  I'm not a natural in the kitchen so I followed the recipe exactly but then read the reviews and turned down my heat to 325 but still cooked it for 2 1/2 hours.  Tough as leather unfortunately.  I was hoping for tender, juicy beef experience.  Well, on to another recipe.  Scratch this one for sure!!

I usually prepare my london broil by broiling it after scoring and basting it with olive oil, salt and pepper. I decided to eschew that technique, and try this delicious-looking recipe.
I must say, I am disappointed. 
I followed the recipe to the letter, and the darned thing turned out as tough as an Army boot.
I will not try this again.

Bought a piece of London Broil for the first time and found this recipe.   Tried it and loved it.  As others have said, it was moist and very tender.   I've always heard London Broil is tough, but with this recipe...no way!   I put a rub of cinnamon, ground pepper and salt onto the meat, placed in an oblong pyrex dish, & topped with a can of Basil & Oregano flavored Diced Tomatoes. Covered with heavy foil and put in the oven at 300 for 3 hours. It came out looking like the 2nd photo.

This was real easy and very delicious.  I seasoned the meat before adding the tomatoes.  I didn't have stewed so I used diced that we seasoned with garlic, green chilies, oregano, etc.  Then I added minced garlic.  I covered it and cooked for 2 1/2 on 325.  It was a little over cooked but super delicious and tender.  Next time (because I will be making again) I will cook it for 2 hours.

Very simple and very easy to make.  I added little bit of garlic powder, salt, and pepper on the steak before throwing a can of chopped tomatoes on top.  It is tasty but extremely dry.  I am going to try cooking it less than recommended 2 hours next time.

This tasted sooo good and was soooo easy to make!  I took some users advice and used diced tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes.  I also added soy sauce and cut onions.  Delicious!!!  This is a keeper.

Just wanted to say - BEWARE YOUR ENVIRONMENT!  I lived in Texas as a bachelor and I used this once and tried to impress a girlfriend - it was perfect (either that, or my girlfriend was trying to borrow money from me).  I tried the EXACT SAME THING after I had to move for my job to Palm Springs, California and it was way WAY too dry.  I could even tell the difference.  (She stayed with me but cooked more often - not sure who really lost in that situation.)  My advice is that the same recipe may not work in two different places, due to humidity or stupidity or whatever.  I learned that the hard way.

This was an ok recipe, but it made my London Broil taste more like pot roast.  This is not my favorite.

I give this recipe 4 stars because it is so easy and I always have the ingredients on hand. The flavor is great...although I'm not sure I'd label it the best ever. Makes great leftovers as well.

I give this a 4 because, while it wasn't the "Best Ever" as advertised, it was very good, and the fact that it was so easy made it even better!!!  

I have made this a few times now, wonderful time saver and the family loves it.

Very tasty.  I added my own spices and water as another reviewer suggested.  The meat looked dry, but was actually very tender for such a lean piece of meat.  My husband really liked it. Will make again.

This is a good way to make London broil, but I wonder if the suggested 350 degrees was a mistake.  I knew to cover it and  I cooked it for 325 for 1.5 hours, then added 1/2 a cup beef broth mixed with 1/2 cup red wine because it was drying out, dropped the temperature to 300, and cooked it another 1.5 hours.  I did cook it on a bed of sliced onions so the juices from the meat would drip down on them and caramelize them.    I had to laugh at all the reviews that supposedly rated this recipe, but used entirely different seasonings.  Those reviews just waste our time.  One person didn't even use tomatoes!  It's one thing to make minor changes and share if it worked for you, but if you completely ignore the directions, then you did not make THIS recipe.  If what you did was completely different, but it tasted wonderful, you should post it as what it is - a completely new recipe.

Cooked it at 325 for 45 minutes then 300 for another hour took it out to stand for 15 minutes and more than done. Will shorten the cook time at least 15 minutes next time. Added 2 russet potatoes cut lengthwise and baby carrots on top in a covered casserole dish. Also gave it a healthy splash of worcestershire and pepper. Next time adding a few pieces of celery and a sliced onion as while tasty need a bit more zing for me. It did come out medium well fork tender. This could be a go to meal especially when London broil is on sale like today, scored a nice looking 2 lbs. (had a tiny bit of fat marbling) for 2.48 a pound on special. Served 4 easy and with the meat on sale 2.50 a plate with a some leftover meat and could have stretched to 5 or 6 with another simple side dish. 2 thumbs up from CT

I have made this Recipe twice and it is excellent. You have to make this in a covered dish with not a lot of extra room

Bottom of the Pan, Half a sliced onion and a 14oz can stewed Tomatoes

London Broil Salted, Peppered, Garliced, on top of the Onions.

The other half of the Onion and a second can 14oz on top of that.

Put the cover on the dish, put in a 350 Degree Oven for 2 hours for a 2 Lb London Broil. add more time for more meat.

Outrageously Good.

Tried it tonight (2 1/2hrs), would do it again, but I think next time I will cover it so it will be more tender. It was a lousy cut of meat and was quite tasty. Thanks

My son and I absolutely loved this.  My husband liked it but thought it had too much of a tomato taste.
I cooked in a crock pot and used a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes seasoned with basil, garlic and oregano.  I served it with pasta which we thought worked really well.

Very easy, very tasty. Did the added suggestion of soy sauce, A1, ground pepper and Italian seasoning - definitely added lovely flavor.

Will make this one again!

Hubby liked it.  But I found it dried out.  I used the 2 T of soy sauce, and put onions over the top of it like some suggested.  I cooked it for 2.5 hours in a 325 electric oven then raised the temp to 250 to get it done.  I'm not crazy about tomatoes, but I do eat them in certain recipes.  The meat was too dried out for me.  Hubby said it was good and he was glad I didn't like it so he could have another serving.  I won't make it again to his chagrin.

I used 1 can of Rotel Tomatoes, 1 can of Fire Roasted Tomatoes, 1/2 cup red wine.  I put garlic powder and pepper on both sides of London Broil and baked at 325 for 2.5 hours (covered).  The last hour I put in a separate dish of fennel that I drizzeled olive oil over.  Delicious!  The salt in the canned tomatoes is enough you don't need to add extra salt.  Hence the garlic powder.

My husband and I liked this but didn't love it.  The sauce was really good (I served the meat over noodles), but the meat was not very tender.  I roasted it tightly covered for three hours, so I'm not sure what I should have done differently.  I will probably make it again if I can figure out how to get the meat more tender.  I think I will use a different cut rather than london broil.

I made this exactly as the recipe suggested, but since I don't have a roasting pan I just bundled the whole thing up in tin foil and it turned out great.

Pretty good.  Very easy and I will make again when London Broil is on sale and am looking for an easy way to prepare it.  I lined the baking pan with foil and had minimal clean up.  The "sauce" was very good over white rice.  Next time may try over egg noodles.

Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fantastic base recipe.  My family loves this one even though I add more to it (spices, onions, carrots, etc).  A fine way to use the London Broil.  Thanks!

I cooked it by the recipe, and it came out well-done,to well-done.The tomatoes came out dry too.After reading some reviews and some said to cover it or cook it at 325 instead. Maybe i'll try it again that way.

One of those very rare times I didn't have canned tomatoes.  But what I DID have is a surplus of salsa.  I thinly sliced an onion for the bottom of the pan, lightly seasoned the meat with a salt-free spice blend, topped with the chunky salsa, added a little beef broth around on the onions and a little on top of the meat.  
I cooked this in my lidded enameled cast iron Dutch Oven.  It turned out  beautiful.  I think next time I'll cut the temp to 325 and cook a little slower.  Definitely have to cover this one so it can steam and stay moist. 
I sliced and pulled the meat and covered with the delicious sauce it made.  Family loved it!

I tried this recipe for the first time today and it came out perfect!! The only change I made was in the marinade. I used one packet of  “KIKKOMAN’S MEAT MARINADE” instead......I was introduced to this particular meat marinade decades ago, and it is always my go to for any meat I want to marinate! ?? I like this one because it has never failed and it only takes 2/3 of a cup of water to the packet and I always get asked what my secret marinade recipe is. People are absolutely shocked when I show or tell them what I used! I also leave the meat in the marinade overnight, if time allows. If not, it still turns out as tender without.

This was my first attempt with a London Broil ever, just stuck to Pot Roasts in a Crock Pot before.

This recipe is super easy,  but don't overcook it.    3 hours was a little long at 350 degrees.   My meat was under 2 pounds (a smaller cut), so maybe would not need that long.

I cooked it on a foil covered pan, so easy cleanup.  I also covered it with foil to keep it from drying out.

I checked it with a meat thermometer at 1 hour 15 mins and it was well done already (about 190-200 degrees).

Super easy recipe with super easy cleanup.

Yes. Had smaller can diced tomatoes. Plus can of the little Oriental baby corn. Had already marinated the London broil in mix of Italian dressing. Horseradish sauce. Spices. About 2 days. Covered in foil. Cooking right now!

I should have paid attention to the picture before I wasted my food.  No beef should look stringy  like the picture.  Most of the ratings for 5 stars must have used a chuck roast type of meat or something meant to cook for hours like stew meat.

No, this is not how to make London broil. Followed the recipe to the letter and wound up with something tough and inedible. Then hunted around for more authoritative sources online. Bottom line: marinate thoroughly, then broil briefly. OR use a slow cooker for 10 hours. This in-between approach does not work.

Very easy recipe and came out pretty good. Meat was very tender and cooked really well. Love the fact there were less than 5 ingredients to make this.. but it needs maybe one more ingredient- was kind of plain

Following others' comments, I cooked this tightly covered, at 325 and for less than half the recommended time. It still came out well-done and dry. I'm going back to cooking my London Broil on the grill.

The meat was OK but not fork tender.  I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed, in a covered glass casserole dish.  Was disappointed after reading other glowing reviews.  Perhaps I did something wrong.

This turned out to be good! I used the critique by mbrousse (1 bottle of 8oz. italian dressing, 1 pkg of dry onion soup mix, 1/2 c. ketchup and one 10.5oz can beef gravy).  Marinade meat over night and pour the marinade on top of meat, cover with foil and bake for 2 hours at 325 degrees. It was delicious!

Garlic salt added directly to meat, covered with thin, loose slices of onion. Topped with stewed tomatoes, seasoned with basil and oregano and some chopped green onion. Delicious, tender and oh-so-easy! My favorite recipe!! Baked, covered for 2 hours produced meat WELL done, but suprisingly tender and still fairly moist. Baked in a dark baking pan in center of oven, so perhaps should have scaled back baking time.

I scored the london broil on both sides and covered with onion, garlic and paprika powders on both sides. I poured 1 14oz can of  Hunt's fire roasted diced tomatoes on top and 1/2 can of beef broth  to the roasting pan.Did not marinate. Covered in aluminum foil and cooked at 325 for 2 hours then add potatoes and carrots for 3rd hour.. This turned out incredibly tender. Thank you!
Made this again tonight but didn't have a taste for tomatoes tonight so I mixed 2 TBLS worst, ketchup, soy sauce, 1 TBLS lemon juice, 1 teaspoon each of onion and garlic powders. Followed the same cooking technique.

I am giving this a 4 simply because I didn't feel like mine was as tender as it should have been.  Maybe I had higher expectations because I wanted a delicious "like butter" texture and that was not the case.  HOWEVER, my husband thought it was AMAZING!  He likes his beef drier than I do, so for him, it was perfect!  What I cannot leave out of my review is that it is just so flavorful!  I will gladly put that sauce over some  egg noodles and be quite happy!   While the meat wasn't as tender to MY taste, it certainly made up for it in flavor!  My husband just put his two cents in saying that he had several bites and it is flavorful and not dry at all!   lol  Me?  Well, not hating on it...

I love the recipe but my cook time is much less.  I also like to add potatoes to the dish and then add mushroom slices for the last 1/2 hour - yum.

I don't care for this cut of meat but I did like the ease of just adding diced tomato.  I opted for Del Monte garlic and herb diced tomato in a can.  I think the meat was overcooked.

It was great, after you enhance it to make it your way, cover it when cooking in the oven. it stayed in the oven just over 2 1/2 hours covered, very tender, very delicious, I added sauteed onions and made great sandwiches on toasted garlic french bread.  Thank you.

I'm disappointed. After just 1h15m at 350, my 1.7 lb roast was done (170 degrees) ... but very tough and dry. :( I followed the recipe and added some soy sauce, Italian seasoning and pepper as one reviewer suggested, and tented it with foil and added a little extra water. If I try it again I'd maybe cook it at 300 for longer and see if it turns out any better.

I used one pound of London broil and a 14 oz. can of tomatoes with chilies.  I added about a cup of water to the pan and splashed both sides of the meat with Worcestershire sauce.  I cooked it, covered, for about 1.5 hours.  It was good, but a bit tough.  It was MUCH better then next day after the leftover meat soaked in the juices overnight.  Excellent flavor!

This was by far not the best London Broil ever. In fact, it's not a LB at all, nor does it taste like one. It turned out dry and bland, and tasted exactly like a beef pot roast. Mediocre at best. I cooked it on 325 instead of 350. The recipe also calls for baking 2 1/2 to 3 hours, so I made the mistake of waiting to check it until 2 hours and 10 minutes. It was already way overdone.

This dish lacked flavor and the meat was super tough.  I think it might have been better in slow cooker on low for 10+ hours as I've done with other london broil cuts.

Just finshed this dish and it was as tasty as the other reviews say. No left overs tonight. I did use fresh garlic and onions. Also added a bit of red wine towards the end. Delicious!

i like the recipe except i changed the stewed tomato to crushed tomato i guess it helped because it went dry in the inside but just cover with the sauce and it is really good if you want you can add a little bit parmesan cheese

More of a pot roast type of outcome.  It is tender.  Just too well done for me. I prefer to put on a rub and grill.

This was okay. I liked the flavor, but the meat was still too tough even though I tried somone's suggestion of using a foil packet.

I loved the ease of this recipe, and the tomatoes added good flavor. On the other side, steak is not meant to be cooked in an oven, especially for hours on end. I think this recipe proves that. There's no delicious crust to this steak. No juicy insides. What's the point of steak without that?

Pretty good.  Mine came out a little tougher than I hoped, but I only cooked mine for 90 minutes.  Tasted a bit like meat pasta sauce.

Very good flavor. I will cook for less time next time; dried out a bit. Tomatoes added a great complementary flavor that I wouldn't have thought of. Served this with rice and dilled green beans.

Good, I marinated the London Broil overnight in barb-b-q sauce which worked well.  After 2.5 hours I took out and used the tomatoes and meat sauce with a side dish of tortolini.  Family loved.
