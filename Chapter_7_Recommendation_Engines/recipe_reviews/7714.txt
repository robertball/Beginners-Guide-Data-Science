I make a LOT of cheesecake and this was the best yet!  My recommendations:  Use more butter to keep the crust together, bake the crust for 10 minutes at 350 and then let cool before adding the remaining ingredients, reserve 1/3 of the caramels to melt for a topping, and I always add a tablespoon of flour to my cheesecakes to keep the cake dense and not gooey.  Also, toast extra pecans to use as a topping with the caramel.  This baking method works great and the crust won't crack:  Bake at 450 for 10 minutes, turn oven down to 250 without opening the oven and bake for 30 minutes, then turn oven off (still without opening the oven) and leave cake in another 30 minutes.  And be sure to make and add 50% more filling to make a higher cake.

Oh my goodness -- what a cheesecake!!  I used an Oreo cookie crust (increased the butter to 6 TBL), baked it for 10 minutes at 350 and refrigerated it overnight before adding the caramel and pecans.  As suggested by others, I brought the crust up about 1 inch on the sides of the springform pan and doubled the amount of cheesecake filling. I used a hot water bath (wrapped the pan in heavy-duty foil and placed it in an oven bag) and baked at 450 for 10 minutes, turned the oven down to 250 without opening the oven and baked for 30 minutes, then turned the oven off (still without opening the oven) and left the cake in another 60 minutes.  The cheesecake was perfect--not a single crack!  I refrigerated the cheesecake overnight, then made a ganache (1/4 cup heavy cream, brought just to a boil, stir in a couple of handfuls of chocolate chips until melted, cool slightly) which I poured over the top.  I sprinkled chopped pecans over the ganache and drizzled caramel ice cream topping over that, then refrigerated until serving. VERY rich, but wonderfully decadent!

This is by far my favorite dessert - cheesecake, chocolate, and pecans!!!  Easy to make, though it does take time.  Well worth it!  I read all of the reviews before attempting.  I DID chill the crust, caramel, and pecan layers before adding the cheesecake mixture; cooked it for 45 minutes; then left it in the oven (after turning it off) for an hour.  It made all the difference - it came out perfect!!!  I'll definitely make this again!

I am an avid cheesecake fanatic and have made boat-loads of cheesecakes in my day.  I have to say, this is one of the best (I know everyone always includes that little cliche when writing a review) cheesecakes I've ever made.  I just had 2 adjustments that I made to the recipe:  1) I used a whole package of oreo cookies crushed up and added to melted butter as the crust, and 2) definately use Kraft caramels and not some off brand such as Brach's caramels.  I have made this twice since Christmas and can't make it fast or often enough for my family and friends.  It truly is wonderful and you won't be disappointed.

Excellent.  Be sure to shape the crust up the side of the pan in order for the caramel layer not to stick.

Lots of potential.  Ratio of carmel to cheesecake is not quite right.  Double the cheesecake filling and save 1/3 of the carmel to dribble on top later if disired.  My family liked it best without adding any chocolate and we like rich deserts.  Added more butter to crust as some reviewers suggested and will not do it again.  I did put the crust higher up on the pan to prevent the caramel from overcooking on the edge.  I would recommend toasting the pecans.  I had no problem cooking it according to the directs without a water bath.

If you find a cheesecake that tastes better than this, let me know. I'll call Guiness! I noticed that, when reading other reviews, there were some comments about the amount of caramel. I think if you let the crumb, pecan and caramel layer cool for a half and hour in the refrigerator before adding the chocolate cheesecake batter, you will have much better results. Other than that, absolutely flawless! And, yes, adding a chocolate glaze will send to into orbit! Thank you!!!

Delicious!  I brought this cheesecake into work and I got TONS of compliments.  For the single guys out there, making this cheesecake is a sure way to impress.  It's amazing how many people become your friend after tasting this cake.  Definitely use a springform pan for best results.  I used a nut chopper to crumble the Vanilla Wafers.  EXCELLENT RECIPE!

Wow!  This cheesecake was awesome.  I have been making cheesecakes for years, and recently stumbled upon this recipe.  I made it for Thanksgiving, and it was gone in 10 minutes.  The previous reviews are priceless, as I am sure my cake would not have turned out as well without them.  OREO crust is a must (1 package Oreos and 5T unsalted butter).  I did 1.5x filling and it was the perfect amount.  You must use Kraft caramels, and if you melt them down with the evaporated milk correctly, it will not harden up when chilled, and will remain creamy and decadent.    Additionally, I sprinkled some ground toasted pecans on top before cooking, and saved a handful for caramels and some of the milk to make a drizzle for the top, and the cake turned out looking very professional.  I used a waterbath to cook, and it turned out absolutely perfect.  Using a waterbath ensures a perfect cheesecake every time.  To make a waterbath, I use 18 inch heavy duty aluminum foil to wrap my 9 inch spring form pan.  I only use one layer and it works fine.  Then I place it in a 12x17x3 inch baking pan with about an inch of water.  Throughout the cooking I throw some ice in to keep the water from boiling, and keep the water level up.  Good luck!

This recipe was just wonderful! It is some of the best cheesecake I have EVER tasted and I will make it again. I followed the instructions in previous reviews (cook at 450 for 10 min 250 for 30 and off for one hour; also add 1/2 recipe extra batter) and it was perfect. It really wasn't hard to make, so don't let the word cheesecake stop you from trying out this recipe!

I think I've found my new favorite dessert!  This was so delicious......but I did make some modifications based on previous reviewers suggestions.  I used a oreo crust with 5 T. butter, put crust up the sides of the pan (to avoid caramel sticking to the pan), saved some of the caramel for drizzling over the top, chilled the caramel/pecan/crust while making the cheesecake part, and added 1 pkg cream cheese, 1/4 c. sugar, 1 egg and about 1/4 c extra chocolate chips to the cheesecake batter.  It turned out beautiful, no cracks.  I also made a little glaze for the top with a handful of chocolate chips melted with several tablespoons of skim milk.  I did use lower fat cream cheese.  It was such a hit with my guests, they couldn't stop talking about how great it was.

This was the best cheesecake I've ever had! I served it at a Christmas party for my friends and everyone was asking for the recipe. Many of them actually said that it was just as good if not better than the cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory.

I absolutely ADORE this recipe!!  It's delicious!!  I've had people, who have always claimed to hate cheesecake or anything other than plain cheesecake, go nuts about this recipe and even grab another slice!  This is an official hit among all of the people I bake for!

The suggestions I have are:
- I increase the cheesecake filling portion of the recipe by another 50%.  This makes it a little thicker, which I like. 
- I use ground Chocolate Teddy Grahams for the crust, and only place those on the bottom, not the sides.  Also, I increase the melted butter to 4-5 tbsp to make the crust stick together better.
- I don't put the caramel layer down in the cheesecake.  Instead, I buy dipping caramel (the stuff people use for apples) and spread a layer of that over the top after the cheesecake completely cools.  An added bonus to this is that it covers any cracks in the top of the cheesecake.
- I cook it for 40 minutes at 350 degrees, and then, WITHOUT OPENING THE OVEN DOOR, I turn off the oven and let it sit in there for another 30 minutes while the oven cools down.  It comes out perfect!
- I roast the pecans by spreading the pieces thinly over a baking sheet and placing it in the oven while I preheat it.  Take them out as soon as it hits 350, though, or they start to burn.

Well, those are all of my suggestions (most of which were gathered and tweaked from other comments on this page!.  I hope everyone enjoys this recipe as much as my family, friends and I do!!

if anyone was disappointed with this recipe, they did something wrong with the prep. it is fantastic; for garnish, i piped on sweetened fresh whipped cream swirled dollops. then added a long-stem maraschino cherry to each dollop to give a crown effect; sprinkled chopped pecans in the center; it sold for $250 at a charity auction and the buyers graciously shared it with their table mates; they reported it was equivalent to cheesecakes at an upscale chicago restaurant they frequent. it is a great recipe and worth the effort it requires.

I was nervous about trying this recipe because this would be my first cheesecake. I've made the Jello boxed cheesecake and that just doesn't count as a real cheesecake, complete with springform pan and everything! It was really easy, in fact, too easy! I want to make another one because it was so delicious! I followed the suggested baking directions of ten minutes at 450, twenty to thirty minutes at 250 then an hour in the oven with it off. A couple of minutes after putting the cheesecake in the oven at 450, it smelled like it was burning. I wasn't sure what to do so I left it alone and turned it down at eight minutes after, not ten. After it was baked and cooled, I did not have any cracks and it did not taste or look burnt. I really don't know what was burning but it there had been a burning cake smell, not as if something else was burning in the oven. Anyway, everyone who had a piece declared it to be one of the best cheesecakes they've ever had. My husband doesn't care for nuts in a cake but he never once complained about the pecans in this cheesecake. I'm so glad I tried this recipe! Maybe I won't be so nervous about trying new recipes in the future. Thank you for submitting this recipe!

I read other reviews stating that the crust layer was too hard so I put the pecans on top of a graham cracker crustand then drizzled 1/2 of the caramel and melted chocolate over them. I then chilled the crust layer before baking. I also marbled the cheesecake and topped it with the remaing caramel, chocolate, and pecans.  My only complaint is that the cheesecake layer wasn't thick enough. Next time I will 1 1/2 or double the cheesecake portion. Bake one hour and let sit in turned off oven for an hour for a perfectly even bake. This cheesecake makes a beautiful and impressive presentation.

Takes a while for the caramels to melt.  Very sticky, but a big hit at Father's Day.  Everyone loved it.  The caramel stuck to the sides of the pan, so it was a little difficult to get out.  I would run a knife around the edges several times during cooling to prevent the sticking.

This is the same recipe I recieved from a bed & breakfast.  The only difference is that in that recipe it calls for 6 TBSP of butter instead of 2 (the 6 is a MUST).  Also, to keep the caramel sauce on the edges from getting too crispy I would press the cookie crust 1 inch up the side (I baked mine for about 10 minutes on 350 to make it set more).  Lastly I cooked mine at 350 for 40 minuted and there was not a crack and I didn't even have to do a water bath - Yeah!

This recipe was disappointing. There was not enough butter included in the recipe to hold the crust together, therefore every piece was a mess when it came out of the pan. In my opinion, there was not near enough filling in the cheesecake. Mine turned out very thin....less than 2 inches high. The caramel/nut mixture above the crust was too tough. I also put caramel, chocolate shavings, and nuts on the top....and with the cheesecake part so minimal, the topping overwhelmed the cheesecake. If I make this type cheesecake again, I'll use the Turtle Cheesecake recipe (also on this site) since it uses much more butter for the crust and extra cream cheese for the filling. I'll also skip the caramel and nuts on the crust and only put them on the top of the cooled cheesecake.

I baked this cheesecake last weekend and it turned out great!  I made some slight modifications to it though.  Instead of using vanilla wafers, I used chocolate graham crackers and 6 tbs of butter.  It held the crumbs together better.  I also used 9oz of caramel instead of 14 and reduced the milk to 3oz.  I reserved some of the caramel for the top of the cake also. I marbelized the cake with the chocolate instead of totally blending it in.  After baking, I layed down more pecans on the top of the cheesecake and drizzled more melted chocolate and the remaining caramel over top.  It was excellent and a hit in my house!

My boyfriend loved it.  I did make a few modifications.  I have a 10" spring form so I added 1 more package cream cheese, 1 egg, and 1/4 cup white sugar.  Also, before incorporating the melting chocolate, I poured some of the batter into the crust.  WIth the reserved batter, I added the chocolate (1 cup chips for me) and then swirled it into the pan.  Beautiful and delicious.  I also used fat free and low fat cream cheese - no problems!

I made this for Thanksgiving 2001 and was told by the family that i had to make it for Christmas also!  This is so sinful & delicious, it looks like something you would see in a gourmet magazine.

I just had a slice of this cheesecake and I feel like I need a bag of Doritos now in my system. It's so rich and sweet that I don't see myself getting another slice, not even tomorrow. I even reduced the amount of caramels and it is just way too much. Super easy to make and very pretty to look at but sickenly sweet. I used a waterbath as I do with all my cheesecakes, flans, and custards. Seriously, I am searching the house for something salty to have ASAP. I'm going on a coma!!

This. Tasted. Amazing!  It was a huge hit when I had my parents over for dinner; it was worth the huge mess it made and the little extra effort it takes.  If I make it again, I think I will use oreo cookie crumbs for the crust, and it needs more butter than called for in the recipe.  Also, I'm not sure how to remedy this, but the caramel stuck horribly to the pan, so badly that I was almost ready to throw the pan away!  Definitely melt the individually wrapped caramels and evaporated milk for the filling; so rich and creamy!

This is supremely excellent! The chocolate cheesecake is silky and rich. The carmel is a perfect creamy consistency.  All you could ask for in a turtle cheesecake:) The very minor changes I made after reading several reviews, were to add 2 extra tbsp of butter to the crust, and I used 2 10.5 oz. pkgs of Werther's Chewy Caramels mixed with 1/2 cup evaporated milk. Oh yeah...Make sure you push the crust up the side of your springform pan at least an inch so the caramel won't stick to the pan.

I made this for someone's birthday at work and it came out EXCELLENT!!!  I love cooking and making desserts but this was the BEST cheesecake I've ever made.

I followed someone's suggestions and made it the following way:

I used crushed oreos for the crust - chocolate cheesecake - this was a no brainer of a change. (baking the crust for 10min at 375 or so)

I saved a little bit of the caramel stuff to decorate the top.

I increased the ingreadients for the filling by 50% and cooked it for 60 minutes at 250 instead of 30 and then left it in the oven (with the oven off)for a half an hour or so after that.

Oh yes...  after pouring the caramel layer on the crust I put it in the freezer for 15 to 20 min so the filling wouldn't mix in with the caramel.  

Helpful note:  I made sure I put the cheesecake on a cookie sheet while baking.  Turned out to be a really good thing as the oil from the butter in the crust and the caramels seeps out the bottom of the cheesecake pan.  

The presentation of this was incredible it looked just like something you would pick up in a gourmet pastry shop! (Now how did that happen???)

The presentation of this way incredible and the taste was even better.  It is the best cheesecake I've ever tasted!

As if this wasn't already bad enough - I used my own favorite cheesecake recipe and then made (per someone's suggestion) Carmels (recipe from allrecipes) which took longer than anything else but OH the wonderful smell in the house! 

For the crust I couldn't find what I wanted and don't like oreos so I bought 2 Chocolate pre-made crusts. Turned out to be a little over 2 cups but I used KerryGold butter (divine) and it stuck together great!  

THEN, with leftover carmel sauce (makes a ton) I buttered a dish, sprinkled pecans and ghiradelli chopped chocolate and poured the rest of the carmel sauce over the top. When everything is said and done I'll cut cute little turtle shapes (I hope) and adorn the top of the cake.

Side note: I buttered the bottom of the springform pan, THEN added parchment paper to cover and THEN buttered that in hopes that it's not a fiaso prying the cake from the pan.

I have a feeling (since I used my own cake recipe) that it's going to be a bit messy as it's nearing the top of the pan and it's only been 10 minutes. lol

I'm giving it a 5 because of how it smells and looks but I can't partake for another 3 weeks so in the freezer it will go.

Try this just once and you will love it. I make alot of cheesecakes for the family and this one takes the top for most requested. It may take a bit of time to make, but well worth it.

MMMMM...delicious! I followed a few other's suggestions, and hardened up the caramel and nuts for about an hour. I also drizzeled caramel on top of the cake after it was baked and cooled, and topped off with some more chopped pecans..it was beautiful and yummy.

I followed some of the many wonderful suggestions of previous reviewers, and this turned out very well.  For the crust I used 1 1/2 c. crushed chocolate graham crackers, 1/4 c. sugar, and 6 T. butter, which I prebaked at 375 for about 6 minutes.  I increased the filling by half, which still made for a fairly short cake.  The original recipe would have been VERY thin.  I also added 1 T. corn starch to the filling to give it a slightly more cakey texture, and would probably add another T. if I make this again.  I toasted the pecans.  And finally, I saved some of the caramel filling to spread on the top, along with a drizzle of chocolate and some extra pecans.  My friends were very impressed with the cake.  It was incredibly rich, but very tasty.

This is awesome! I altered the crust a bit and it was delicious! I used 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar, and 6T melted butter. (baked for 8 minutes in a 350 degree oven before pouring on caramel and nuts.)
I also used the hot water bath method for cooking the cheesecake. Once it was out of the oven I made a chocolate sauce by melting 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips with 1/4 cup heavy cream in a saucepan. I frosted the cake and cooled it in the refrigerator overnight. Everyone loved it!! A real keeper!

Whoa! This is superb! I did make a few changes...baking it in a 13x9 pan works well, and that way you can cut it into neat pieces and remove any unsightly bits before serving. To do this: for the crust, combine 3 C graham cracker crumbs, a pinch of salt and 1 stick of butter and press into the bottom of the pan. Double the caramel layer and the cheesecake part, using slightly less sugar (3/4 to 7/8 C after doubling) because it would be VERY sweet as is. Assemble the cheesecake as stated, and bake at 350 for about 35 to 40 minutes or until the center jiggles just a tiny bit when you shake the pan. Cool completely, then refrigerate until chilled or over night. Cut into SMALL squares, because this is just about the richest dessert you can imagine! You may want to cut off the sides, too, because they can get a little tougher even if the middle's perfectly set. Mmmm...definitely Cheesecake Factory material!

Use Oreos with 3 T butter for crust, added extra 1/4 cup chocolate chips. Used milk chocolate Ghirardelli chips. Drizzled caramel and chocolate on top. Toasted the pecans. Also added 1T flour to batter. OMG delicious! Looked professional! Didn't crack at all! Never happened to me before wen making cheesecake! Did not use a water bath either. Loved this! Thanks!

I found this recipe in the Philadelphia Cream Cheese cookbook years ago. I serve it every Christmas. People come to my Christmas party just to get a slice (and to take some home if possible). A few years ago I had gastric bypass and with a few adjustments, I can still enjoy with wonderful cheesecake but now as a sugar-free! You can't go wrong here. P.S. Yes the original recipe called for TOASTED pecans.

After reading all of the reviews (yes, I was nuts and studied it all so I could make THE perfect turtle cheesecake), I've created my changes and it is AMAZING!  - Double the cheesecake portion recipe, it's not thick enough otherwise. - Instead of adding chocolate to the cheesecake, just do the oreo crust.  The nila wafer crust doesn't have much flavor and the oreo one is flavorful AND give the cheesecake enough chocolate. - Put 3/4 of the melted caramel as called for, but reserve 1/4 of it to drizzle on the top of the cheesecake. - Use an additional 10 pecans (toasted) to decorate the top of the cheesecake.  Looks super professional with the drizzled caramel and WHOLE pecans! - Add 2tbs more of butter to make the crust

Oh my!  I make a lot of cheesecakes and this was absolutely delicious.  The only thing I changed was to make some homemade whipping cream (1/4 cup sugar and 1 cup heaving whipping cream and beat on high until light and fluffy) to add to the top before drizzling with carmel and topping with some pecans.

Wow, this recipe was good!  I followed others reviews and used an oreo crust with 5 TBS of butter.  I increased the filling by 50 perecent to make a taller cheesecake. I wish I would have added 1 TBS of flour because the middle was more gooey than I prefer.  I toasted pecans for the top, made a ganache, and drizzled it with caramel...YUM!  Will definitely make again!  Thanks!

I was sooo looking forward to this cheesecake, unfortunaltely I was a little disapointed. First of all, it was not amazing. The filling tasted good, but not out of the ordinary. The caramel was way too liquidy, and as per the recipe, it doesn't say to boil until thickened, it just says until well melted. It stuck to my pan so bad, I had to soak the pan overnight to get the caramel off!I wish it had said something about greasing the pan beforehand! Even the pecans went lumpy because of how liquid the caramel was. It is very time comsuming to make, and I don't think it was that much worth the effort. I love making cheesecake, and I was looking for one recipe that was a change from my usual new york style that I make, which is usually a great hit! Unfortunalely, this was not nearly a hit at the family gathering. Sorry, but I don't think I'll be making again :(
thanks for sharing though!

This was a good cheesecake but it needs some tweaking. I didn't like the consistency of the cheesecake, it was cake-like instead of creamy like cheesecake should be. If I make this again I would change the cheese portion to be creamier like a New York cheesecake and I would use chocolate cookie crumbs for the crust. Be sure to cool the caramel very well before you pour the cheesecake on top of it.

Absolutely fantastic! My first cheesecake and it came out perfect. I took the advice of others and used 6Tbsp butter for crust, made 1.5 amount of filling mix, added 1 TBSP flour to filling, and just put the minichips directly into the filling unmelted. I also used oreos for the crust because vanilla wafers didn't seem to go with the turtle theme. I would also toast the pecans next time; they got a little chewy sandwiched between the caramel and the filling. I'll definitely be making again. Thanks for the great recipe!!

For those who have never baked cheesecakes, use the suggestions that can be found on this website to bake in a hot water bath as well as leave cake in oven after turning it off.  Will result in a much more evenly baked cake that will not sink and / or crack.  And don't cut corners with low-fat cream cheese or mongrel brand caramels, no matter how you slice it, it's going to be decadent and fattening... it might as well taste as good as possible!

This cake is delicious. I think it's very easy to make and it came out perfect. It tastes even better the 2nd and 3rd day. I followed the advice to make the crust higher on the sides so the caramel won't stick and it worked. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us:)

I thought this cheesecake was too rich and dry. It’s not anything to rave about. I’m disappointed that my time and ingredients didn’t give me a better product. Sorry everyone, it only gets 3 stars from me.

This is an easy one - YUM! YUM! YUM! 
I left out the pecans because I don't like nuts at all, but my guess is if you happen to like 'em adding pecans to this deliciously sinful treat would be very good too. Be forewarned this is on the heavy side. I served a light strawberry cake and several folks at the party commented on how well they complimented one another.
Easy recipe too:
1.Make french vanilla cake mix in 9x13.
2. Punch holes all over with back of wooden spoon.
3. Thraw frozen strawberries (I mixed ina  touch of sugar to make more juice). Spread tyhis over cooled cake, pushing juices and berries into holes. Chill
4. Pour/spread prepared french vanilla instant pudding over top of berries.
5. Chill then top with Cool Whip.
REALLY GOOD!

This cheesecake was fantastic!! It is so nice to try out a recipe that is as good as you hope it will be.  I thought it was pretty easy for a cheesecake recipe, and my extended family ate it right up.

While this was a good cheesecake, I probally will never make this particular recipe agian. It's a great idea, but not very tasty. Maybe if you swirled the carmel into the chocalte base, it would be better. My favorite chocolate cheesecake recipe on this website it the "fudge truffle cheescake"

This is one of the best cheesecakes that I have made.  I made it for Christmas along with a few other desserts, which weren't even touched!! I made some additional caramel and chocolate sauce and drizzled them over the top, and then sprinkled crushed pecans and cherries over that. It made an incredible presentation and added just a little bit more to the flavor - not that it needed any!!! I will definitely keep this recipe in my most used section!

Once chilled, I needed a really good knife to cut through the caramel/crumb layer.  The cheesecake portion was very "heavy".  Although good, I don't think I'd make it again.

This is one rich dessert!!  I made this for a family dinner and no one could eat more than a little sliver.  Several people said the crust was too thick, next time I will put some around the sides of the pan as well.  I also reserved some of the caramel and pecans for the top.  Good thing I did because the top cracked and adding the caramel and pecans to the top made a great coverup and presentation.

Add 6 tbsp of margarine with the wafer crumbs. Bake crust at 350 for 10 mins and cool completely before caramel layer.  Keep 1/3 of caramels to drizzle on top at the end with 1/4 of chopped pecans (toasted). Bake at 400 for 10 mins, reduce to 250 and bake for 30 mins more and turn off oven. Leave in oven 60 mins more (don't open oven door!)

Delicious! I used one & a half times the amount of filling called for, and there was enough to fill 2 store-bought graham cracker crusts (yes, I cheated on that part! haha). Other than that, the only thing I did differently was add about a tbsp. of flour to thicken the filling. Topped with whipped cream & more nuts...YUM!

Great recipe, but maybe a little too rich. I'll definately be making this again, but maybe with a little less caramel.

Good cake! I followed the recipe and everyone thought it was really good. The only complaints were about how sweet it was. I would make this cake again only next time I would use a nut crust instead of the vanilla wafers. 


The caramel sauce worked perfectly. I was scared that it would be to watery or stick to the saucepan but it was successful. I would use less caramel sauce in the cake. Drizzling some on each slice when serving would look nice. 

The cheese part of the cheesecake was my favorite. It was really easy to make and it tasted great! I think it should be doubled.

This turned out great! I make my own caramel sauce so I used that, as well as Oreo crumbs for the crust. The cheesecake part wasn't overly good, so next time I'll adjust that. The flavours were awesome and I'll definately be using this idea again!

I also did the modifications: 1 box oreos, crushed and with 5T butter, in a greased 9" springform baked at 375 for about 10-15 minutes.  Let it cool.  I couldn't find wrapped caramels, so I took a chance and used a 1/2 jar of thick caramel ice cream topping on the cooled crust.  It made it a tad hard to cut, but was very tasty.  Also did the filling 1.5x the recipe, and a little extra dark chocolate chips thrown in.  Then I baked the 3 temperature combination (400, 250, off oven) and chilled it overnight.  It was a hit!  And no water bath needed, that was the best part.    I will use this recipe again!

Tastes great! After it was done in the oven I turned the oven off and left it in for three hours before moving it into the fridge and the top didn't crack. It turned out great. I would highly suggest leaving it overnight. It tasted so much better the next day.

This was very good--my son requested it for his birthday.  After it was refrigerated it was hard to get the sides of the pan to remove because the caramel had stuck to it.  I put the pan, still wrapped in foil, in hot water and was able to dislodge it.  Anyway, the crust is delish, but the filling was not quite as smooth and dense as I prefer, but very good without a doubt.  thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! I have a 7 inch springform pan; I just kind of guessed on the amounts for the crust, but kept the filling ingredient amounts the same and it made a nice thick filling. Will definitely make again and again!

This is a fantastic cheesecake! I made this for my husband's birthday and it was a huge success. I used about 2 packages chocolate graham cracker and 1 stick of butter for the crust, baked that for ten minutes, and let cool. It was really thick and hard to cut, but delicious and oh so chocolatey. Before I poured in the caramel, I put a layer of chocolate chips.  I also made 1 1/2 times the filling per other people's suggestions, baked it about ten minutes longer, and then turned off the oven while leaving the cake in for 30 minutes.  I topped it with caramel, pecans, melted chocolate and mounds of chocolate shavings.  Worth all the effort by far, this one's in my recipe box for good.

This was a fabulous cheesecake.  Ive made it twice now this week for 2 different parties.  Both times I made it a regular pie plate. The first time I melted the chocolate, the second time, I just mixed 1/2 cup mini chips into the batter.  That way looked way better and tasted better in my opinion.  I made an oreo crust and put the chopped pecan on top of the cake OVER lots of drizzled hot fudge and caramel topping sauce.  With only the sauce, the cake looked almost messy, but after the pecans are on top, it looks like something from Bon Appetite.  A favorite recipe to add to my box!  It also never cracks when in a pie plate!!

WOW! The first time I made this I didn't get to taste it because it was donated to a charity auction.  It sold for over $200! However, my friend is a caramel-a-holic so I made one for her surprise birthday party. I was a hit and not a crumb was left over. I'll be making this again (and again).

I baked this for my wife for her birthday, and we both loved it!. Its a great-tasting mixture, and chocolate/caramel/pecans really added another dimension to the cheesecake taste.  The only things I would change would be to raise the edges of the crust to prevent burning of the caramel filling, as others have mentioned, and would bake it in a waterbath, to prevent cracking.

I made this cake for my boyfriends birthday and everyone loved it!  They thought it was store bought!  I didn't use whipped cream to garnish the cake but I did drizzle some melted chocolate and finely chopped pecans.  It look beautiful and tasted even better!  Be prepared, very sweet and rich.

I made this for dessert one night with some italian food and everyone went crazy. They couldn't believe I made it, they thought I bought it from a bakery. My dad said it was the best thing he has ever put in his mouth. I would highly recommend making this, it's amazing!

This recipe was a five with a few changes suggested by other reviewers.  We loved it with the extra filling ingredients, I chilled the crust before filling it, and added a total of 4 tsp. butter to vanilla wafers to make it pack better.  Also make sure to pack it up the sides about an inch and you'll have no problem with burning or sticking caramel.  I did not use a name brand caramel and it still turned out delicious.  My 13y.o.son chose this for his birthday dessert with all the grandparents over and it was a huge hit.  As far as being alot of work--well, what real cheesecake isn't?  Well worth the effort!  Thanks for a great new cheesecake recipe!

A very good cake, although I still prefer plain old New York-style cheesecake! I added a little extra butter to make the crust, and that turned out fine. Liked the thickness of it. Caramel was a little hard for me also, but maybe bringing it to room temperature before serving would help? Good chocolate fix anyway. ;)

Even though my guests were kind, the cheesecake was a total embarassment to me. The bottom turns into "rock" that is near impossible to cut w/ a fork. Will never make again.

Loved it!  Like someone recommended, I left it in the oven after the cooking time was finished.  It was super yummy and quite easy to make.  I took it to my bookclub and everyone loved it!  I used a graham cracker crust also.

This cheesecake recipe is a little time consuming, but it is all well worth the energy put into it.  If you are entertaining chocolate lovers, you will be a guaranteed success.

made this one over the weekend and was a hit with my girlfriend! used grahm craker crumbs and had to use at least 3 tbps additional butter than recipe called for, also added a dash of sugar. i think the crust was my favorite! followed one of the suggestions and marbled the chocolate instead of stirring in. turned out okay, but chocolate was not spread all the way throug the cheescake, was only really on top and got hard and crunchy after baking. also saved some of the carmel and drizzled over the top, which was good. next time I will follow the recipe and see how it turns out.

This was the first cheesecake I ever made.Everyone love it.I ony bakd it for 35 minutes and then let it sit in the oven for 10minutes no cracking.Just one bit of advice make sure your vanilla wafers are packed in the pan well .Mine weren't It made it a little difficult taking it out due to the carmel stuck.But I added fresh strawberries it was a hit.

I really don't know what I did wrong!  I followed the directions exactly but when I cut the cheesecake, caramel oozed out everywhere.  It was unstopable, it all came out and was like liquid.  I don't know what could have happened, any advice?  The actual cheescake itself tasted awesome, I'd like to give this another try!  Please help.

Very good! I made this for my husband's birthday. The only change I would make next time would be to not put any caramel on the crust, but only on the top. Some of the caramel soaked through the crust causing it to stick to the pan when trying to cut it. Much of the crust was left on the pan which was quite disappointing. I did use Smucker's Caramel Sauce instead of following the recipe for the caramel, so that could be why I had problems with it. Otherwise, this was quite good!

I was disapointed with this recipe, I can't put my finger on where/what went wrong for me. The caramel just kinda melted into the cheesecake, I didn't get defined streaks/layers of caramel but you could tell where it was because those bites were tough and chewy. I was expecting more since this recipe has great reviews. Im not sure I'll give it a chance or just look for another recipe.

A family favourite! Try with a ganosh topping to finish it off and pipe whipped cream dollops for each serving. I also recomment light cream cheese (for any cheesecake). You can't taste the difference and it results in fewer callories =)

Someone suggested using a can of dulce de leche instead of the caramels.  I did this, microwaving it for 40 sec before I added it to the crust to make it spread easier.  Consistency was perfectly smooth...not hard at all but not runny either.  Plus, no cooking!  Made this twice with a graham cracker crust and have gotten several compliments both times.

AMAZING!!!  I doubled the cheesecake batter to make thicker, which made for a nice high cake, just like in restaurants.  I saved some of the caramel for topping too.  The crust got a bit hard to cut, but not sure how I would change that.  Would for sure make again!

Great recipe :) For the crust, I used one box of oreos and 4TB butter and lightly toasted the pecans for more flavor. Reading the reviews, I noticed many people thought the caramel to cheesecake ratio was off, so I made 1 1/2 times the cheesecake filling, and i think that it would have been just fine, if not better with the original amounts. I also baked it for 10 min at 450, 30 at 250, and then turned the oven off and let it sit for another 60 min, and it turned out perfect. I will definitely make this again!

Made this several times over the past few years, for parties, holidays, birthdays, etc. Always a hit. It's very rich. I use Oreo premade crust. Then after pouring the caramel in the bottom, I coat it with mini chocolate chips and chopped pecans. I put another layer of chocolate chips and pecans on top during baking. Then, before serving or taking to wherever I am going, I put a caramel drizzle all over the top. Too easy and gives it a professional look!

In order to give this more stars it needed a few changes for my taste.  The caramel made it difficult to slice when chilled and made it way too rich, I like rich but this was too much.  I made 1 1/2 times the batter and only made half of it chocolate adding a little less chocolate than called for.  If I make again I would drop some dollops of caramel in the first layer of cheesecake batter and do some swirls with the carmel and pecans.  Then I would put the chocolate flavored cheesecake batter on top.  I see potential but as is it was not a "hit" at Easter because everyone said it was too rich.  I bake the crust and chilled after the caramel layer was added.

this cake was too sweet for me (I rarely eat sweets), but it got raves reviews from co-workers & friends.  I added a melted chocolate chip layer on top & drizzled some melted caramels, then sprinkled some pecans - very pretty!  make sure there's lots of milk or strong black coffee around!

The results were delicious, but I think there was something missing, perhaps it was the crust.  Instead of the caramel sauce in the recipe, I made my own caramel (no trans anything and no high fructose stuff) which has a richer flavor. I also toasted the pecans on a baking sheet before baking the crust. Other than that, I followed the suggestions of others by using 1.5x the filling (great height!), using more butter in the crust (great flavor and hold) and baking it with the staggered temperatures (no cracks). I will make this again.

i made this for my boyfriend's birthday.  we are usually just fans of plain old, heavy, huge, decadent cheesecake with no frills, but i thought we'd try this.  the caramel was surprisingly an excellent compliment to the cheesecake.  i will say that i was slightly concerned with the fact that the recipe didn't have any flour in it, so i would recommend adding a tbsp like another reviewer mentioned.  (my cheesecakes usually include sour cream and flour). the cheesecake was more dense and perfect a day, even 2 WHOLE DAYS after i made it, but good luck on waiting that long to try it!!! (not gonna happen:) i didn't want a chocolate cheesecake, so i left the chocolate chips whole and just stirred them in the batter.  (personal preference.) so, i give this recipe 5 stars. i will probably return to my tried and true unadulterated cheesecake for most of the time though:)

Hrm nothing special really. I think the chocolate carmel cheesecake listed on the site tastes better. The cake itself is easy to make and is a quick cook, but just nothing pizzazzle about it. Wouldn't make again.

Great recipe!  As with a lot of other users, I would suggest using 1.5 times the filling and a oreo crust instead of vanilla waffers. Additionally, I followed the staggered cooking directions and it turned out great.

This cheesecake was a hit at our fondue dinner party on Saturday!  I 1 1/2 times the cheescake mixture, used 6tablespoons butter for the crust, and baked at 450 for 10 min- 250 for 30 min- and 30 minutes with the oven off as suggested by others.  I will definitely be making this cheescake again! Very Soon!

Mmmmm... So good. My family loved this. It wasn't as thick as I thought it would be but that could be because my mixer broke and I had to mix by hand. I also decided I'd garnish the top with chocolate chips. Without thinking, I threw some on top after removing from the oven. The chips melted and didn't look very good;so I discovered by using the back of a spoon and spreading them it created a thin, delicious chocolate glaze on the top. Yummm...

YUM!!!  This is so good. I've never made cheesecake before and it turned out perfectly.  I took another reviewers advice and used 6T melted butter instead of 2T.  And baked the crust about 8-10 min before adding the caramel on top.  Also 40 min was perfect cook time for me.  I used reduced fat vanilla wafers, low fat cream cheese and Splenda, and it was still sooooo good.  Thanks for the great recipe and helpful advice.

Hey.. I thought this recipe was amazing! I added some cream cheese, and more butter to the crust. Too bad no one at home gave me the chance to cover it with fresh cream or some frosting! It was gone in 2 days! Bottom line... everyone loved it!

This is a melt in your mouth cheesecake.  I added an extra tablespoon of butter to the cookie crumb crust, and I baked it in about 2 inches of water. It came out perfect.  Drizzle it with caramel ice cream topping and sprinkle with chopped pecans an it looks beautiful.

WOW.... Just make sure to bake by hot bath.  I also baked the crust (which I also gave the sides an 3/4 inch so the caramel wouldn't burn) 10 minutes before hand and cooled completely as suggested by a reviewer.  Instead of melting the chocolate, I mixed the chips in with the batter.  I also drizzled extra caramel and chocolate over the top and sprinkled a few nuts to make it look really professional (it also filled in tiny cracks it had.)  This cheesecake is awesome!!!

This is one great cheesecake!  I altered it a bit by melting the caramel and drizzling it over the top of the cake and then topped it with chopped walnuts.  (mmmm...)  Thanks for the recipie!

This was better the second day.  I didn't like the soft, baked nuts, so next time I would omit the pecans from the caramel layer and put them on top after it is cooked.  I also added the chocolate chips as is, instead of melting them.    Great served with chocolate sauce drizzled over the top

What a wonderful recipe!! As others suggested, I added an extra package of cream cheese and more butter to hold the crust together. Also, I pressed the crust up approximately an inch high on the side. Turned out great!

Nice and fancy looking!  Little too sweet for my taste, would cut down or eliminate sugar - there's plenty in the caramels.  Overall very good!  Thanxs for the recipe!

I didn't read the recipe correctly--I only used 7 oz of caramels, and it still came out delicious! I also used half regular and half low-fat cream cheese. This recipe wasn't as much work as it seemed it would be, and it was definitely worth the effort...and the calories!

This recipe was tasty, but not a HUGE hit.  I'd make it again, but probably wouldn't substitute with low-fat cream cheese - had less of an impact because of that I think!

This recipe was very good although there were a few things that kept me from giving it 5 stars. The caramel burned along the edge of the springform pan giving it a not so pretty appearance. I also found it hard to cut-the caramel and crust layer pulled away from the actual cheesecake. I also would have doubled the cheesecake portion-it ended up being very thin.  Flavor wise, this is awesome! I love it-I am a caramel fan and this blended with chocolate is just heavenly.

This is a very rich cheesecake that will have people raving for months.  However, it is VERY time consuming and rather expensive to make.  I think that for this recipe it is vital to use higher quality chocolate.

This recipe is fantastic.  I recommend refrigerating the nilla wafer and caramel layer, it makes the layers stay separated better.  I also used a glaze of chocolate chips, left over evaporated milk and cacao liqueur.  It made the cheesecake even richer.  I have many requests to make this again.

This cheesecake is fabulous!  Instead of mixing the chocolate into the cream cheese mixture, I poured the mixture into the pan and then spooned rows of chocolate and some leftover caramel and swirled it with a butter knife.  Got rave reviews from the ladies I work with.  They want the recipe, too.  I will definitely make another one for Christmas!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipie.  I have the same one only it has a glaze, which makes it even more sinful.
1 cup chocolate chips, 1/2 cup whipping cream, and a dash of coffee flavored liquer

If there is anything more sinful than this cheesecake, then I haven't found it!  A big hit with everyone who has tried it.  So easy to make, too!  Thank you for this fabulous recipe.

This was such a crowd pleaser!!  I made it for Christmas, an it will now be a tradition of mine.

Thanks,

I made this and it was amazing. I tried to follow the recipe exactly but I added a little extra butter to the crust. I think Next time I make I’ll add quite a bit more butter (maybe 5-6 tablespoons) to the crust and work it up the sides of the pan. The caramel layer sticks to the edge of the springform pan quite badly so I want to prevent that. This cake us super rich and was a huge hit. Once the baking time finished I turned off the oven and let it sit in the cooking oven with the door closed for about an hour. I find that helps prevent cracking and settling.

Cheesecake is my favourite dessert and this one is my new favourite. I substituted Oreo crumbs for the vanilla wafers and I drizzled a bit of the caramel on top prior to cooking. I have a convection oven and it was perfect at 45 minutes. It got rave reviews tonight, even from my hubby, who usually passes on cheesecake.

i made this last night for a friend's birthday - first time i had ever made a cheesecake.  it was amazing!  everyone loved it and thought it was restaurant quality.  i especially love how the caramel layer stayed soft and gooey.  i used 50% more filling as others suggested but i'm sure it would have been great as written too.  stephanie, you made me look like a pro today.  thank you for this AWESOME recipe!!!

I have made this cake at least 25 times. I have made a few adjustments over time to my liking. I use double stuffed Oreos for the crust. With the double stuffed cookies, there is no need to add any butter at all to the crust. I toast the pecans in the oven before breaking them up. I double the cream cheese amount and half the white sugar amount. I preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Cook the cake for 10 minutes, shut off the heat & leave in the closed oven for 1 hour more. Then open the door & leave for one more hour. Then I refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours. I have never had a problem with the caramel sticking or any cracks & it tastes amazing!

Our son and daughter in law have birthdays four days apart so I always try to make a cake that will appeal to everyone. A couple of years ago it was a Red Velvet Cheessecake which was delish but this year it will be Chocolate Turtle Cheesecake I.
I just can't leave a recipe alone and this time I'm really glad I tinkered with it ever so slightly. I double the filling for the cheese cake and still did not fill the spring form pan quite as high as I had wished. Next time instead of 4 bars of cream cheese and 4 eggs I will use 6 of each then I might have enough to make a small 6" for the little kids as well. I did heavy cream with the caramels as I had used that many times before. Successfully. Also for the chocolate I have a homemade hot fudge recipe that we use on homemade ice cream and I made that for the chocolate for the cheesecake. Toasted my pecans for the bottom and the top.
Speaking of which go see German Roasted Nuts on this site and use 2 cups cashews; 2 cups almonds and 2 cups pecan. Do not increase honey. DIVINE!

3. cream cheese, 3/4 sugar, 3 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla. Be sure to do graham crust that will go up sides so caramel doesn't leak out making it impossible to release pan.

I used 2- 8 inch silicone pans I made turtle brownie in one and cheesecake in the other so I used brownie as bottom instead of crust - I use the silicone so I can freeze cheesecake pop it out and flip it over so I don't care if cheesecake cracks I'm flipping it over anyway! I did filling for 24 servings to have taller cake

The prep on this recipe takes far longer than 30 minutes. Seriously unwrapping all the caramels was a good 10 minute job. I used graham crackers for the crust and found the caramel to be very runny. I never bake my cheesecakes in a water bath and they generally do not crack (this one didn't). While my husband enjoyed this recipe for his birthday I doubt I will be making it again as I think the other turtle cheesecake recipe on this site turns out far better.

Delicious Cheesecake. I used graham cracker crumbs instead of cookie but I would not recommend using 2 tablespoons of melted butter. That had to be wrong. I used that with 2 cups of crumbs and it wasn't enough to bond the crust. The  crust falls apart while you are cutting it. Especially with that layer of caramel between the cheese part and crust, you have to have a stronger crust because the caramel makes it even harder to cut through. I think 1/4 cup of melted butter is needed. Other than that I did exactly what the recipe called for including bake times and it came out wonderful. The cheesecake batter was much thicker this time but it baked up so smooth. I am very pleased. Great creamy flavor.

I thought this cheesecake was absolutely DELICIOUS!!! Everyone that tasted it, loved it. Not to mention, it looked beautiful! I used the following recommendations: Increased the crust butter to 6 TBL and baked it for 10 minutes at 350. I also baked the cheesecake at 450 for 10 minutes, turned the oven down to 250 without opening the oven and baked for 30 minutes, then turned the oven off (still without opening the oven) and left the cake in another 60 minutes. The top still cracked a bit, but after decorating the top with melted chocolate and pecans, you couldn't even tell. And instead of using wrapped caramels and evaporated milk, I bought the caramel bits that you can melt in the microwave. This was an excellent recipe that was easy to follow and tasted AMAZING!! Will definitely make again.

Very easy to make! I did have to make a few small substitutions based on what I had on hand, and still turned out flawless; beautiful to look at, no cracks, smooth texture. ( my changes were graham crumbs instead of wafers, I would do wafers next time as the Graham's didn't stick together well... And I had only half the Carmel's but I subbed with caramel sauce with no poor side effects, just not a visible caramel layer). I don't agree that this was too rich, as some have said. It is one of the lighter "easier to eat" cheesecakes I have made, and I think would appeal to those who aren't raving cheesecake fans since its not too thick or sticky. Wonderful cheesecake, very solid base recipe. Do what you like to topping or crust... The base recipe is top notch. *note, I always do a water bath with cheesecakes

Use a good quality chocolate, and dont forget to let the caramel layer set a little bit or else the filling will disrupt it quite a bit. other then that its a winner!!

Fantastic!  I too modified, doubled the cheescake part, but only used 1/2 cup choc. chips.  I also used Hershey's classic caramel topping and added pecans, caramel and drizzled more melted choc. chips on top.  It was a huge hit.  Love the pecans and caramel on top of crust!

I had problems with the crust.  Next time, I'll follow my instincts and use more butter.  Although its not specified, I used a water bath - not a good idea.  The cheesecake did not fully cook, but tasted great.

The crust was very hard, hard to cut, hard to chew. The cheesecake was not very chocolatey. I will try this one again b/c I think it has potential. I will put nuts on the crust, possibly into the crust as well. I will reserve the carmel for topping only. And lastly, I will double if not triple the amount of chocolate.

Great recipe.  I used an oreo cookie crust and left out the pecans.  Other then that I followed the recipe exactly.  It cracked in the last few minutes of baking so once it cooled I added a chocolate glaze and topped with crumbled oreos.  Fantastic!

It was very very good ... I used my own cheesecake filling recipe, and a graham cracker crust instead, so I modified the recipe quite a bit, but the overall idea was perfect and everyone loved it!!

This recipe was a huge success! However I did follow several suggestions from reviews. I added a tbsp of flour to prevent cracking and also did the 450 for ten minutes, 250 for 30 minutes, and oven off for 30 minutes. It came out beautiful. In order to make it as chocolate and as dark as the picture I used more like a cup and a half of the chocolate chips. I put pecans and caramel ice cream topping on the top. Oh and I used chocolate graham cracker crumbs for the crust, more like 5 tbsp of butter, and seemed to only use about 1 cup of the crumbs.  Definitely got the brownie points that I needed!

I made this in a 10" springform, so I added 1/3 more of the cheesecake filling ingredients and the crust ingredients.  I also chose not to melt the chocolate chips, just stirring them in instead.  It was wonderful!

I didn't have any caramels on hand so I substituted ice cream caramel fudge sauce.  Don't do this - it makes it too sticky and difficult to cut.  I omitted the pecans.  This cheesecake looks very pretty and has a smooth, rich texture.  I used swirled caramel in the shape of a spiral on the top.  Be sure to bring the cream cheese and eggs to room temperature to prevent your cheesecake from cracking.  I would make again if entertaining.

This cake did not turn out so well for me. I followed the recipe exactly as it was written. The cake was so gooey that I could hardly cut it with a knife. The caramel hardened and fell off of the filling when you try to eat it with a fork. This sounded like a good recipe but, I think I needs a few minor changes. Add flour to the batter to make the cheesecake less gooey, use a different form of caramel, make the cake part thicker, and use more pecans.

delish!! sent it to the fire station with my husband to see if it was up to the firemen's high standards (they are quite the critics, and not afraid to tell you if something is mediocre!) it got rave reviews and they told me I can make it for them anytime. Made as directed but i swirled the caramel and chocolate on top of the cookie crust and topped it with chocolate turtle candies. YUMM

I agree with some of the others: it's good, really but needs some changes. The caramel sauce was way too runny; the pan needed something or you would have the cake sticking to the bottom and hard to remove. The nuts got soggy beacause of the runny sauce and the cheese part tended to go down through the caramel.

This was just "ok" for me. I prefer my cheesecake with a thicker cheesecake.  This seemed more candy/crust than cheesecake.  Other reviews had said to do 1 1/2 x the cheesecake filling - which I would try if I made this again.  I did add more of the turtle topping portion as a garnish since alone, the baked part of the cheesecake didn't look that appealing.  The appearance was fantastic when drizzled with chocolate, caramel and pecans on top.

OMG!  This got the best reviews of almost anything I've ever made.  And that's saying something!!   I was putting it out on a holiday buffet dessert table.  And I'd forgotten to spray the cheesecake pan and it was totally stuck and not coming loose - no how, no way.  So I just put the whole thing on the table with a gigantic spoon for serving.  And it still won hands down over all the other tasty desserts available.  This is one that will definitely be made again!

I am a beginner baker. I made a new york cheesecake a few days ago and it turned out great and I've been eyeing this recipe and wanted to try it. The prep time was about 45 min. I didn't wait to cool anything. I put it together and baked for 40 min, it was definately long enough. It looked like the layers were mooshed together when I took it out after cooling in the oven. In the morning I drizzled carmel and chocolate on top. Once cut its was absolutely delicious. It is very rich. You would definately get your chocolate fill on 1/16th of a piece. The family can't wait till the next get together when I make it again!

My first attempted at making a cheesecake.  Turned out good except when I added the cheesecake layer it caused the carmel and nuts to go all sides.  Also, almost too much nuts but that's just my taste.

This recipe was very good. Before making it, I read the other reviews and agree that the crust should be brought up higher on the sides then suggested. For next time, I would also melt choc chips in the batter instead of adding them whole like I did. It was still good, but seemed too chunky.

This was great, but not perfect.  I had read the reviews so I baked it in a waterbath and it turned out great.  I followed the exact recipe amounts and found the filling was enough.  I might add 50% more but I could barely finish a piece as is.  The only main thing I would do different is melt the chocolate chips as directed.  I followed a few of the reviews and added the chips to the batter and found it too "chunky" with the chips and pecans.  Everyone loved it but most couldn't finish a whole piece.

One of the best cheesecakes I have ever tasted!!  The second time I made it, I couldn't find the caramels, so I used chocolate covered caramels.  I melted them and added 1/2 the canned milk it calls for.  EXCELLENT!!!!

When I made this cheesecake for our Christmas party, everyone when crazy.  This cheesecake tastes like it was made at the famous Cheesecake Factory.  I love the ingredients and will make again and again.

Used this recipe to make my very first cheesecake for a bake off at work...and guess what?!!! I won!!  I used a couple of suggestions that varied from the original recipe and they loved it.  I won three categories:  best tasting, best presentation, and 1st place overall!!  A definite winner and will definitely be making again.

I make this for every holiday party, I am demanded to.  I add hot fudge and carmel ice cream sauce to the top with chopped pecans.  It is the best cheesecake I have ever had.  I even lost a cookoff becuase the jugdes thought it was bought in the store!!!

This recipe was fairly easy to make. It was my first shot at a cheesecake and it was for easter dinner. Everyone loved it! It was a great hit. I read some of the other reviews and made the crust higher on he sides and my carmel didn't burn. If I only liked chocolate this would have been great for me, yet I pleased everyone else which was my goal. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a hit with my Father-in-Law, and the rest of the family loves it as well.  The only thing I would try next time is to see if I can out carmel on top.  I could taste the carme but not as much as I would like.

Difficult to make if you have never made a cheesecake before.  Also hard to find caramel squares in stores.  I used ice cream toppers.

Instead of using the vanilla wafers, I used crushed graham cracker crumbs but other than that, I left everything else the same.  This was very rich and decadent...a little goes a long way!  Thanks for sharing Stephanie.

Would give this recipe more than 5 stars if possible.  Rich and delicious.  Required less baking time than listed, as the cheesecake layer is rather small.  Might try making more actual cheesecake next time.  Perfect the way it is though!!!

I'm pretty inexpreienced when it comes to baking, especially cheesecakes, but this recipe turned out terrific!  I made it for Thanksgiving and i couldn't stop the compliments from flowing in.  Everyone know about my baking capabilities (or lack there of) and they were very impressed with how this turned out.  Definetly refrigerate over night, and let the caramel set before pouring over the cheesecake mixture.  Thanks for such a great recipe!!!!

i was so excited to try this recipe, and when i did, i was disappointed. i took the cheesecake out before the 40 min, thinking it looked done to me, but it had already started to burn a little bit where the caramel was around the edges. The cheesecake part of this dessert wasn't very sweet and didn't have that strong of a cheesecake flavor. It wouldn't have been that big of a deal, but it takes quite a while to make, and even longer till you can eat it! I will have to doctor it up and see if i can add a layer of something sweet like chocolate or caramel and then top it with whipped cream. If i make this dessert again, I will make some changes....sorry

Very disappointed!  The caramel stuck to the crust and therefore was pretty much inedible.  The chocolate topping has a wonderful flavor but presentation was gone!

After reading all the great reviews, I decided to make this recipe for Easter.  I did not like it, nor did anyone else.  It was fairly easy to make and came out okay, but was too time-consuming for the end result.  The texture is too heavy for my liking (even difficult to cut with a knife), and the caramel taste was too prominent (maybe the brand I used).  I prefer a lighter cheesecake.

This was wonderful m husband said it was to rich but he is not a cheescake eater.  I would suggest cooking it until it barely sets. I made this last week and I am going to make it tommorrow again.  I cant stop craving it. I made two and brought one into work they loved it! Thanks for the recipe.

This cheesecake was unique and delicious!  It was absolutly to die for!  Just make sure to give yourself enough preparation time, if you do it all form scratch it does take a bit of preparation

This one of my favorite cheesecake recipes now.  I have served it many times for alot of different people and everyone has loved it!!  I wanted to respond to a review on 3/15/01 by dkelada.  She had a problem with the carmel running when she cut.  My suggestion is maybe she used more than just 5 ounces of evaportated milk.  The first time I made this recipe I almost used a large can of evaporated milk. (Not knowing it came in a smaller can)  This is a big hit!!!!

I made this for the first time this week and brought it to a family gathering. I brought home an empty springform. The only thing I'll do different next time is be more careful when pouring the cheesecake batter over the pecans. I dumped mine out of the bowl into the middle, which pushed a lot of the pecans and caramel to the outside of the pan. In fact, I think I'll add more pecans altogether.

I searched the big web for all types of cheesecakes--some low fat and others not. This was a great flavored one and extremely easy to make. I even did a low fat method using low fat and non fat cream cheeses, pan spraying the form and sprinkling the wafers crumbs, sugar free caramels, low fat milk and low fat chocolate chips. It was pretty good but the original was the best!!!

This was one of the best cheesecakes I have ever tasted...My 15yr old daughter made it and it was the creamiest I have ever had...she also made it with an oreo crumb crust...a little too chocolaty so next time maybe I will use the vanilla wafers and maybe only put chocolate in half of the batter and marble it...definately two thumbs up!!!

Very nice recipe.  Family loved it!  Next time I'm going to try separating the eggs and beating the white then folding them in for a texture enhancer.  Thanks for the recipe!

This cheesecake is divine! If you love chocolate & caramel, you've got to try it. And it's easier than many cheesecake recipes!
