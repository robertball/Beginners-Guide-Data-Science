Undoubtedly delicious! This was the best apple pie I have tasted.....way better than store bought. My son called it the best apple pie in the whole world. I used Ice cream shell from this site for the base.

amazing and really easy I made homemade apple filling with flour brown sugar apples of course and a couple other things but the topping was good I liked the peanut  butter.
