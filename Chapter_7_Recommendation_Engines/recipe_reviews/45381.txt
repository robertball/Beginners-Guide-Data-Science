This recipe is now a family favorite!  I "cheated" a little by using two bags of "boil-in-bag" rice (just put the bags on a plate in the fridge after they are cooked) and I purchased a bag of fresh stir fry veggies in the produce section instead of buying, washing and chopping the celery, mushrooms, bell pepper, carrots and snow peas.  Add a bit of extra soy sauce at the end and enjoy!

This recipe was a good start, but the seaoning needed quite a bit of help. I used brown rice and left out the eggs, subbed water chestnuts for the bamboo shoots, added more garlic. After it was finished, I tasted it and felt it needed some seasoning help. I added in some Five spice powder, more soy sauce and a dash of rice wine vinegar. Much better, IMHO

This recipe was really really good.  I had to add my 2 sense since I was worried not many people had responded, I didn't expect it to be so good, but it was!  The serving size was generous and satisfying too.  Only 5 points with WW!

I subbed water chestnuts for the bamboo shoots and added bean sprouts because I love them but made no other changes. It was a little bland as others mentioned so I added a splash of rice vinegar and this helped a lot. I think replacing a tablespoon of the veggie oil with sesame oil would bring this up another notch. It was good and we enjoyed it but I do think it needs more seasoning.

I liked this very much. I added some fresh grated ginger, a little shredded cabbage, and some white pepper. I substituted sesame oil for the vegetable oil. I also finely julienned the carrots instead of shredding them.

This was very good.  I changed the ingredients just a bit to suit my own tastes; I used 8 oz mushrooms, no green onion, 3 eggs, 2 garlic cloves and 1/3 c. soy sauce.  My husband loved it and since there are just the two of us we have leftovers for lunch today.  Oh, I also added 2 chicken bollion cubes to the water when I cooked the rice-just adds some flavor (not good if you're vegetarian but great if you're a meat eater that loves veggies).  I'll definately make this one again!  Thanks

Delicious recipe that bursts with flavor.  I didn't have snow peas so I substituted them for the regular frozen kind.  I also stirred the rice in before the last of the veggies and cooked it a little bit to get the chill off.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

This is a great and easy-to-make dish.  I pretty much made it as written except for leaving out the bamboo shoots and the snow peas, simply because I didn't have any on hand.  I used frozen peas and some frozen broccoli instead and the results were wonderful.  I srved it with a cup of Miso soup and some mini chicken and vegetable egg rolls.   Delicious!

Good!
Everyone who I cooked this recipe for, loved it. This will definitely be one of my staples. 
I followed the recipe exactly, but, I felt it needed a little help afterward. It was a bit bland. So I add Five-Spice Powder, Adobo all purpose seasoning, and sea salt to taste. After adding a little seasoning, wow! What a difference! Amazing recipe.

This was an easy and versatile recipe.  I will admit I did cheat a little bit and used some frozen veggies that I had in my freezer since I didn't have any fresh ones and it still turned out great!

this was fabulous! I used brown rice, sesame oil and added shrimp !! (or you could eat some shrimp on the side...I just mixed mine right in) It was so good, and will definately be a staple from now on in my house!

I cut the recipe in half.....we'll, the rice and egg parts. I kept the vegetable ingredients the same. I actually used brown rice and cooked the rice in organic chicken broth. I used red bell pepper (we don't care for green). I highly suggest you try it this way, unless you like your fried rice rice-y. ;) NOTE: I always cook my eggs seperately from the fried rice ingredients only because I can't ever get mine not to turn out goopy. I just grease a small skillet with sesame oil and cook the eggs like I would a small omelette. After it cooks solid, I let it cool, then shred it. MUCH easier.

Sorry can't give this one a higher score, it took forever to make, cost a fortune with all of the ingredients, and turned out flavorless.  Fried rice is cheaper at the carry out so I will be getting it from there in the future.

For this type of recipe, I like to brown my rice first. It just brings out the nuttiness of the basmati I used for this dish. I didn't see the need to chill the rice, so I just let it sit while I sauteed my vegies. What's great about this is that you can use whatever vegetables you've got hanging around your fridge. I also added cabbage to the mix and because I made a pork roast the other day, I threw that in too. I was also able to use up the leftover gravy from the roast by replacing two out of the three cups of water I needed to cook my rice. The gravy gave the rice some much needed flavor being that this recipe didnt' call for any seasonings. I still added garlic and onion powders, black pepper and teriyaki sauce. My family loved this Melinda and thanks!

This is a good "veggie fried rice". I added 1/4 t. curry powder and 1/4 t. red pepper flake, for a little kick. Also used low sodium soy sauce. If you really love chinese veggies, a quick substitute for green pepper (if you're not a fan) 1 15 oz. can chop suey vegetables well rinsed, bamboo shoots are already in the mix. ( I had left over shrimp and added it at the last minute..very tasty).  This recipe is also great with pancit noodles if you're not a big rice lover.

Five stars for the base recipe; it allows adjustments for taste preferences. I don't fancy bamboo shoots, but do fancy cabbage and water chestnuts. Not a big fan of soy sauce-colored eggs either, so I left the soy sauce in the bottle for last seasoning step. I loved one reviewer's idea of julienning the carrots--keeps 'em crunchy. I seasoned the rice with a quarter teaspoon of "Five Spice" (contains ginger and  star anise) at the last 5-minute heating/stirring step. Perfect rice, great veggie textures, and mouth-watering flavor. I served it as a side to lemon/pepper-seasoned chicken thighs (had to serve separately to accommodate my vegetarian dinner attendees). I'll make this again!

Great basic recipe for vegetables on hand some leftover broccoli,onion,cabbage and celery.I wanted a light supper.I served with leftover chicken and mushrooms from the previous night so unlike other review I found it cheap.
To make it a quick night dinner I did extra rice the previous night.I also cut extra veggies up.This was the end of the week and I checked my vegetable bins.

This was awesome!  I did slightly less bamboo shoots, but everything else the same.  REally easy once you get cooking.  One thing, where do the green onions go in?  I assume they are garnish.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. We used brown rice instead of white and fava beans instead of bamboo shoots, since it's what we had from the garden. It's nice to know recipes that have common ingredients. I always have Tamari on hand and it did the trick here. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very tasty recipie, easy and fast to make. Would probably add more soy sauce next time. Also, make 2 servings per person if you're serving it alone.

I didn't have snow peas so I substituted green beans and used brown rice.  This was really good and is easily customized for my family's varying tastes -  just had chili pepper flakes, extra soy sauce, teriyaki sauce on the side.  I will definitely make this again.

Used the recipe for a base, did not have a few of the ingredients/veggies.  Ended up very tasty anyway.

This recipe is okay but it gets much better when you use Sesame Oil and Chinese Five Spice and a bit of Oyster Sauce . A dash of Cayenne gives it a kick.

Loved it! The changes I made was to add more garlic, omit the celery, snow peas and bamboo shoots and use fresh mushrooms. Because I was in a rush I added frozen peas and carrots. Family loved it and I will make it again and again.

Will definitely make this again!  It was so flavorful!  I pretty much made this as stated, but... I did substitute liquid aminos for soy sauce, brown rice for white, and I used a big bag of pre-cut stir fry vegetables.  I measured the ingredients to what was stated in the recipe though.  The only real alteration was that I added a generous sprinkle of ground ginger after I added the rice.  It was super fast to make, because I had exactly the right amount of leftover brown rice & the pre-cut veggies.  Easy & delicious!!

Great! I used quinoa instead of rice and it was yummy with less carbs. I also used coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil. I'll make it again.

I made this and was thinking you know I have better stir fry recipes - by the end of my dinner, I realised I'd eaten enough for two and could have kept on eating. Its very yummy and goes without saying its superhealthy! I used organic brown rice.

I thought this tasted really non-authentic.  If you're into really American-tasting or pan-asian food, go for it, but if you're like my fiance and I and like actual Asian food, it doesn't really cut it.  It also took a REALLY LONG TIME, so try a food processor.

I used red pepper instead of green and frozen peas insetad of snow peas (and of course, more soy sauce.) It's not comparable with the best chinese fried rice that I've had but it's far better than most of the chinese places I've tried. This was an excellent dish and recipe that I would recommend to anyone.

Very tasty. I have never made fried rice before and it was simple. I cut it down to 4 servings and that made the perfect amount. I would add a little more soy sauce next time. Otherwise it was really good, will make again. Thank you.

We made this recipe last spring for my daughter's high school graduation party, and it was a huge hit!!  Yes, it was alot of work, and yes it makes a lot of dirty dishes, but you end up with a very flavorful fried rice that has so much more flavor and so many more veggies than take-out!!  I heartily recommend it!!

It sounds complicated but I spent more time chopping up the vegetables than anything else, and the effort was well worth it!!!!

I thought the rice was too bland.  The recipe made a lot of dishes and it isn't worth the time it took to make this
