Way too much chicken broth in this recipe.  The recipe states the chili should be cooked for 1 hour, however the chili never thickened and it needed to cook for an additional three hours.  The finished product was okay, but the beans became overcooked.

I will try this recipe tonite, can't review it yet. But as a previous resident of New Mexico I can tell you this recipe MUST have a can of diced green chiles added to it.  It is the main ingredient of New Mexico cuisine!

I wrote a review of this recipe once before but haven't seen it here, so I feel I must try again...THIS IS THE BEST SOUP/CHILI I HAVE EVER PUT IN MY MOUTH! Yes, I am SHOUTING! Make a lot and freeze the PLANOVERS, you'll be glad you did. My husband and I ate a bowlful of this wonderful dish every other day until it was gone, so I had none to freeze, but I will next time. 5 STARS? More like 10 or 20! I made only one change:  I used ALL beef stock; didn't have any chicken stock on hand

This recipe had way too much chicken broth.  I used the juice of two potatoes to thicken the chili.  I think the chicken broth took away flavor of the chili.  The finished product is not bad, but I think chili should have more of a meaty flavor and a little more spice, while at the same time less cumin.  Again, this is not bad, itÂ´s just not a real chili flavor in my opinion.
