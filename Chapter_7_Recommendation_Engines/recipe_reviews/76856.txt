Not great, but okay.  I would completely eliminate the tomato paste to this recipe.  The dry oregano portion should be cut in half.    Also, I would cut the onion portion in half.  I think the sauce was a little too sweet as well; therefore, I would reduce or eliminate the sugar also.   Consider adding a small amount of cream to the sauce, and also some chopped fresh parsley at the end.  The only other suggestion would be a little more white wine than is called for...maybe 3/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup.  I hope all of this makes for a better dish.

Can't go wrong with all that yummy shellfish! However, I thought it was a *LITTLE* too tomato-ey - in particular, the tomato paste can probably be reduced. Also, I dipped the scallops in some flour+water so they were a little crispy - YUM!

This was delicious!!!  I used 1 lb frozen uncooked shrimp, 1/2 lb jumbo sea scallops and 2 6 oz cans of chopped clams.  I made the sauce exactly according to the directions.  This was very spicy.  If you do not like spicy food I suggest cutting back on the red pepper flakes.  I love spicy foods and thought it was perfect the way it was.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was  good. I will make again soon. Now I am addicted. I couldn't find fresh clams so I bought canned. It was so much easier. Hubby loved it too. Thanks so much for sharing. Made some garlic break and a good bottle of Chardonnay. I cut the tomato paste in half as others recommended. I think it would have been too much if you put the whole amount. Added throughout the  simmering more wine. Would add next time more crushed tomatoes to make it saucier.

Very good!  I agree that the additional tomato paste is unnecessary.  Forgot to pick up clams but it was great with just the shrimp and scallops.  Very nice tomato sauce base that I could see using with other fish (in pasta).

I made this for Christmas dinner and it turned out great!  I used shrimp, scallops and clams but it would have been fine with just shrimp for a less expensive alternative.  I also added Old Bay seasoning while cooking the shrimp and scallops for a little added flavor.  Great Recipe:-)

Fantastic!!!!  I served it for our Christmas dinner.  My Italian mother-in-law LOVED it (as did the whole family).  I will definately make this many times more.  I left out the pepper flakes,  cut back on the tomato paste and used canned whole baby clams and it worked out great.  Made ALOT!  Yummy!

Outstanding!!! I doubled this recipe and prepared as directed with two changes as suggested by earlier review...substituted two 10 oz. cans of Reese whole baby clams in lieu of steaming clams and used only one can of tomato paste for the entire doubled recipe (1/2 can per). Absolutely marvelous! Have passed this recipe along and will surely prepare again.

My family loves seafood so I made this a couple of weeks ago.  It was very very delicious. I cut the crushed red pepper flakes by 1/2 only because our youngest doesnt like spicer food. The rest of the recipe I followed to the letter and my family went crazy over it.  I had left overs and my husband took it to work for his lunch the next day!!!  LOVED IT!! Thanks again Hawn!  I'll keep you as one of my favorite submitters.

Very good. Paste did dry the sauce out. I changed it up a little. Left out the tomatos because I didnt have any and just used a can tomato sauce. Turn out very good and everyone liked it.

I made this for dinner tonight and was pleasantly surprised. My family and I really loved it (some of us are picky eaters!) While making the sauce I discovered it was too spicy. What I wound up doing was adding more crushed tomato and some half and half.  I probably added a cup of half and half in total to cool it down. Normally I wouldn’t add dairy to a dish with fish, but I knew without it the sauce would be way too spicy. If I make this again, I’d probably still add a little half and half and definitely less red pepper. I also did not use clams. I used shrimp and scallops and it was wonderful. I can also see this being delicious with king crab or regular crabmeat. I did not put cheese on top of it (I don’t think seafood and cheese mix) but instead sprinkled some chopped parsley on top of each serving.  I used thin spaghetti but if I make it again I’d maybe try a fettuccine to hold the sauce better.

Very good!  I cut recipe in half but did not have crushed tomatoes, so used canned diced (about 3/4 of a 28oz can), which we really enjoyed. As a result of using diced tomatoes, I did use the specified amount of tomato paste (based on 1/2 recipe) & also used closer to 1/2 cup of white wine for flavour and sauce consistency.  We used a combo of shrimp, scallops and fresh chunks of salmon (no clams on hand!).  Also used the amount of garlic called for based on 8, cuz we love it!  Very tasty and loved the spicy flavour that the red pepper flakes added!

I made this for a Valentine's dinner.  It was Yummy.  The taste of the sauce was so nice.  It was the first time I have every steamed clams.  They seemed to be a bit tough or chewy to me.  Maybe I need more practice with them.  I also added scallops.  Good flavour all around and very easy to make.

Great!    Left out the tomatoe paste, sugar and used canned clams.   Instead of olive oil I rendered a half pound of bacon.  I used the bacon fat to cook the scallops and shrimp.  The cooked bacon I used for garnish.   To die for in more ways than one.   This is an all time favorite.

Don't add sugar, it makes the sauce horribly sweet. Other then that, it was good.

This was good, but I will change a few things the next time....  I'll add less red pepper flakes, more shrimp, and try canned clams.  Otherwise, it was pretty easy and a big hit on a Friday in Lent!  I did use Dreamfields, a low carb pasta, and no one noticed!

I only had scallops to use in this dish, but it was fantastic!  I will definitely make this again.  I garnished with grated mozzarella cheese and parsley flakes (for presentation).  I will submit a photo.

Delicious! I enjoyed it very much! I saved about three quarters of the homemade sauce for a future use because I don't like a lot of red sauce with my pasta or seafood. I agreed with other reviews that the tomato paste had thickened the sauce heavily so I added about a half a can of water and some pasta water to thin it out during cooking. I'm spicy enough so I omitted the red pepper flakes and added some garlic and onion salt & powder for additional flavor. Topped with fresh parsley and Parmesan cheese. Will make again in the future.

we left out the tomato paste, added only 1 tsp of sugar, but the sauce didn't have the "YUM" factor.  Shrimp and scallops were cooked perfectly.

Terrific recipe!  We all enjoyed this dinner.  I left out the red pepper, and I decreased the paste to 1/2 can.  I  also added more wine (about 3/4 c total), and I added a little clam juice to the sauce at the end. It made just enough to feed 6 adults, it may be 8 technical servings, but I guess we had larger portions. Will definitely make it again.

Excellent!  After reading reviews I did reduce tomato paste by half, although I don't think it would have mattered much to use all.  I was prepared to use scallops, however because they turned to mush while cooking them (bought the wrong size) I used extra shrimp and canned clams.  Loved the sweet taste of the sauce, and leftovers were equally good.

Eventhough the sauce was flavourful, I found by adding the can of tomato paste to be much too heavy.  I had to add over a cup of liquid b/c it was just too thick.

I made this dish as a celebration dinner for me and my honey for our first night in our new home.  It was absolutely wonderful, and knocked his socks off.  I stepped out of character and actually followed the recipe to the letter, and it turned out just perfectly.  This will definetely be one of my new favorite dishes to make.  Bravo and thanks for the great recipe!!!

I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful meal!  I have only one complaint... It was SO spicy... And I had even cut the red pepper flakes like the others suggested - but apparently not enough!  I also cut on the tomato paste as well... used half.  Otherwise, definitely loved it and well worth the time to prepare!  My boyfriend even loved it too... mr. picky!  Ironically... I could not find fresh nor frozen clams, so I used canned chopped clams.  It was okay... would have rather it been whole clams.  I used cooked shrimp as well.  Only thing I had to cook were the scallops, and I warmed up the shrimp in the pan as well.  Yes, it was very much enjoyed!  Thanks so much!!!

Very good!
I did make a few alterations though.
First of all, I pureed the sauce before simmering it for and hour, simply because I like a non-chunky, smooth sauce.  Also, I halved the amount of pepper flakes because I was cooking for company and didn't want it to be too spicy.  Not to mention that I only used half the amount of tomato paste, as others had recomended.
Also, I the clam meat (without the shells) that can be bought in the market near my house to save time.
The people I cooked for told me they enjoyed it a lot!

We have prepared this recipe several times now as we love it...have made a few minor adjustments along the way to use mussels instead of clams, cut the red pepper in half and "kick it up a notch" with double the wine and garlic....YUM !!! Oh, we used rice instead of pasta one time too

EXCELLENT!!  My husband and I both loved it.  Based on other reviews, I left out the tomato paste entirely and it was totally fine without.  I also used the canned baby clams, which made that step much easier.  It's pretty zingy with 1T of red pepper, so if you're not of brave heart, you might want to decrease that a little bit.  I will definitely make this again!!

I tried this dish to make a different sauce for a Sunday sauce and it was great.  My daughter loved it and my husband went back for more for the first time in a long time.  

Thanks for sharing this great dish.

Decided to try this recipe and it came out scrumptious! I didn’t have a can of crushed tomatoes so I used a can of whole tomatoes and mashed the tomatoes instead. My wife wasn’t feeling the white wine so we left it out and added a cup and a half of water to the sauce. Cut the amount of salt to half of what was called for since I was worried it may be too salty and also added mussels to the recipe as well. Came out delicious.

Great recipe. I did only use a half a can of paste as well. I did kick it up a notch and add black olives, capers and artichoke hearts to the dish. The family loved it. Great dish I will make again. Steve

This was a delicious and fairly easy meal to make. It was to hot for my taste, hence the 4 stars. I personally feel 1/2 teaspoon would be enough crushed red pepper flakes, not a tablespoon. I did make some changes. To make it healthier, I used zucchini spaghetti instead of pasta. I didn't have white so I used red wine for the sauce and tripled it,  doubled the garlic and added 1/2 a red pepper, 2 stalks of celery and used the white part of a leek instead of onion and cooked this according to the directions for the onion. When added to the sauce, this cut the tomato taste some mentioned. I added a frozen seafood mix and mussels to clams, scallops and shrimp. I cooked the mix with the shrimp and scallops, the mussels with the clams. Doing it this way, with a side salad and garlic bread  would be enough to feed a family of four.

It came out awesome!  The only thing i can say is use fresh seafood for maximum flavor.  A tip i could  add is if your short on time,you could use your favorite marinara sauce instead!!!

I usually follow recipes without making any changes. However, one tablespoon of crushed red pepper was just too much.  I think one teaspoon would be more appropriate.

I omitted clams and based on other reviews only used half the crushed red peppers. I wish I had used all of the crushed red peppers, but I didn't miss the clams. 

Other than that I made it exactly like this recipe and it was amazing! And easy.

This was delicious.  I did cut the tomato paste in 1/2 as recommended and added a little more wine as it started to get a little too thick.  I also cut down on the red pepper flakes by a little bit.

I prepared this dish for dinner tonight.  I followed other reviews and cut back on the paste.  I used diced tomatoes and also backed off on the red pepper... To 1/4 teaspoon.  Overall the dish was amazing but a little hot due to the red pepper.  Next time I will just use a couple shakes.  I could not imagine a full tablespoon.  I only had shrimp and sea scallops.  I will defiantly make this again and add clams.  Thank you for sharing.

I left out the clams and tomato paste, used frozen scallops and shrimp.  Im sure it would be better with fresh seafood.  But this was an easy and nice alternative to weeknight spaghetti.  I also left out the red pepper flakes.  My daughters don't do spicy, but my husband added them to his plate and enjoyed.  Will be making this again.

This was great!  I used bow tie pasta and made a few changes: omitted sugar, added 2 teaspoons dried basil, red wine instead of white, 1/3- 1/2 the paste, extra garlic, and no red pepper flakes, we added them individually after it was plated since some of my guests don't do spicy...  Yum!  
It did seem to need more liquid so I put water into the pan I cooked the scallops and shrimp (and mushrooms & butter!)  in and let that come to a boil and then added it to the sauce.   I didn't have clams but will add them next time.

I loved this recipe! I didn't have any scallops. I used canned clams and frozen shrimp and it was still delicious! I had fried red peppers so I broke a few of those in there. I used fresh oregano and thyme and dried Italian seasoning. It was nice and spicy! So flavorful! My hubby said I outdid myself??

Sauce is great and easy to make. Too much red pepper flakes so I'll use less. Didn't have bay leaves so I used some ground bay leaves. My husband loved it but thought it was a little too spicy and I totally agree with him and that's why 4 stars.

Absolutely stellar recipe!  The Hubs said he would pay for it in a restaurant - that is the highest praise in our home.  :-)  Like others, I left out the sugar, the tomato paste, and cut the red pepper flakes to half of what the recipe calls for.  I love spicy food, and would have used the whole measure of the flakes, but it had good heat and taste with half, plus was not too spicy for others.  I used 2 cans (drained) of minced clams, and added them to the sauce as I started to cook the pound each of scallops and shrimp.   Also used Turning Leaf Chardonnay as the white wine the recipe calls for.  It's a definite keeper, and one I would make for company!

My husband and I were shocked at that heat in this dish, we found the amount of red pepper flakes called for takes away from the other flavours of this otherwise yummy looking dish.  We recommend cutting the red pepper ingredient down and consider carefully how much heat you enjoy in your meal.

I love this and the very tomato-y flavor. However, I did not use a tablespoon of red pepper flakes, more like a teaspoon -- plenty hot for me.

Great dish!
I didn't used clams, and used frozen shrimp and scallops. Yet it was really delicious.

I liked how the sauce mixed well with the seafood and pasta.  I would use less white wine next time because it was a little too strong in flavor. I loved the hint of spiciness and I loved the smell.  I would definitely try this one again.  Thank you for the recipe!

I doubled this recipe and used half the red pepper, no sugar and paste depends on the brand of tomatoes you buy.  I thought it was WAY too hot.  I was so embarassed.  My Mother literally choked on it.  My lips with tingling.  The men in the family liked it.  But I won't make it again.
