You got to be kidding! Maybe once a year. Read only as far in the nutrition, "35g fat..." and stopped there. About the only recommendation would come from a cardiac surgeon who needs the practice to keep his skills up, or has a kid going to college and needs to fund that.

I made this with low fast chicken sausage and we loved it and the nice part is the fat was SO MUCH LOWER - 6 grams per serving.

It was a great base for a recipe! i substituted 6 links of hot italian sausage i already had and instead of green peppers i used very finely chopped celery and carrots. for the seasoning i used some sweet basil, chili powder and a little italian seasoning. I also used low-fat, low-sodium chicken stock instead of water to add some more flavor.   the recipe was a hit and i will be making it again : ]

we loved these! i used a can of manwich instead of the seasoning and tomato paste though. and i just bought hot sausage patties instead of bob evans. tasted like a hot sausage sandwich. i didn't add the peppers though, just onion.

Very yummy, gives plain sloppy joes some spice!  don't like the extra calories, but sometimes the splurge is worth it!  I've used venison sausage too and is equally as good.
