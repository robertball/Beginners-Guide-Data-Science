I followed the recipe exactly (even though my instincts were screaming at me to add and delete stuff). The cookies were horrible! They were pale and tasteless. The cookie part was dull and tasted like shortening because there wasn t much to the ingredients. Then all you tasted were the peppermint pieces. The dough was way too dry as well. Will not be making these again!

If you are looking for a strong peppermint flavored cookies these are not it. They are a very delicatley flavored cookie. Very delicious and a hit with my family and all the neighbors who got them in their Xmas baskets. The dough is a little dry so I would recommend making sure the butter is VERY soft and add a little water(or milk) as necessary to make it workable.

These taste more like a shortbread cookie than anything and the peppermint flavor is very faint but I still like them and they ARE good for using up those leftover candy canes you always overbuy on at Christmas. The only problem with this cookies is that while they're delicious the first day they don't keep well beyond two days. Some ideas: for less greasy cookies change to 1/4 C butter and 3/4 C shortening and for variation try adding chocolate chips.

It's too bad the other reviewers didn't like these cookies because I thought they actually turned out great! I would give the recipe 5 stars if it were all about taste but I have to say they were kind of a pain to make. The dough was VERY dry and crumbly and there's no way you could "drop batter" by rounded teaspoons onto the cookie sheet -- i had to scoop up crumbs of dough and smoosh it into a ball and then VERY CAREFULLY flatten them so the balls wouldn't just crumble. It's definitely more effort than I'd normally want to put into cookies but I have to say that the end result was terrific: very pepperminty and not bland at all and I am having a hard time not eating the whole batch in one sitting! Oh and one other thing it only made 3 dozen not 4 dozen but maybe I made mine bigger than I was supposed to.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were flat and hardly any flavor except for a little bit of peppermint.

I made these to optimize the leftover peppermint candy. It turned out ok; tastes like sugar cookies with Peppermint candy! No one in my picky eater family liked it but I thought it was ok.
