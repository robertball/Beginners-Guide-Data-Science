These taste great, but don't hold together very well - they're very crumbly.  Also, I reduced the amount of peanut butter chips by a third, to reduce the fat a bit.

These are so good, my roomates had no idea they were healthy! I cut them into bars and froze them to put into lunches. They are a great snack and remind me of Reese Peanut Butter Cup flavour...Yum Yum!

This was pretty good.  I found that the raisons were a pleasent surprise, and I changed the peanut butter chips to chocolate chips (still good!).  It was more cakelike than I had expected though.

I really wasn't expecting much from this recipe, but these bars were surpisingly good.  They were much like brownies, just a little crumblier. I was amazed at how much chocolate taste came from such a small amount of cocoa!I think I'd cut back on the peanut butter chips and increase the raisins as I barely noticed the raisins in the bars.  The only thing I didn't like was the dried milk - you just can't hide the taste of that stuff.
