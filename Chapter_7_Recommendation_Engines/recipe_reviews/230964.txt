the bars are definitely good,  but I'm sorry,  this recipe is a little flawed. It never even mentions the 1/2  tablespoon of vanilla extract in the steps,  so I forgot about it and  skipped it completely. Also,  with the amounts quoted here,  the bars would have to be paper thin to fit in a 9x13  pan. I used a 9x9  and it worked a lot better.

SO GOOD!  I used semi-sweet baking chocolate because I didn't have any chocolate chips, just chopped it up before I put it in.  I also prefer thicker bars so used an 8x8 pan instead.  Turned out perfectly first try.

A few things I would alter from the official submitted recipe: Increase the chocolate (any milk, dark, or semisweet will work fine) to 9-10 ounces to ensure even coating over all cereal. Also, add the vanilla extract with the chocolate chips in the melting process. For thin bars, use a 13x9 pan. For thicker bars, use an 8x8 or 9x9 pan. Refrigerate an hour before cutting into squares. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before serving.

This is really addicting. I tripped up as other reviewers noted, and omitted the vanilla the first time I made it since the directions omit the adding point. I intended to put it in after mixing in the chocolate chips, but it comes together pretty fast. It was delicious anyway I definitely agree that the 8x8 pan is the way to go. The first time I made this, I used the nestle toll house chips I had on hand, but the taste is definitely different. I used Hershey's milk chocolate chips on the second batch, and that was more true to the classic s'mores taste. Thanks for contributing such a great recipe!

Easy to just chop up your graham crackers in a large Ziploc and a rolling pin  Works like a charm, no need to drag out the food processor.  One other little tip you can melt your choco chips right in the sandwich size Ziploc bag, just do it on a low temp in the microwave using your cook levels, massage the bag a little and cut a small hole on one end to drizzle over the top.  I can not wait for the grandkids eat them up.  they look YUMMY

I made this last night unfortunately. This is probably the most foul tasting desert I have ever tasted in my life. I did not change anything in the recipe at all.  I could not say what went wrong. I followed the recipe to the letter.
Thank you for turning me off of Smores  for the rest of my life.
So sorry about the bad review, but that's how I feel about it.

I never have leftovers when I take these places. They are easy and QUICK to make. I usually make a little more of the chocolate sauce than called for to cover the cereal more thoroughly, but that's just a matter of preference. I also like to use a higher quality of chocolate, especially since I up that. Using a serrated knife to cut these helps. ;-)

I had pretty low expectations for this bar.  It was just a quick throw-it-together dessert I had to bring to church, but I was very surprised at how good it was.  Something different than your typical marshmallow crispy rice bar.  I doubled the recipe and put in a 9X13 pan.  I think the recipe could be tripled into a 9X13 for thick bars.  Easy, quick, and good.

Very yummy! After reading the reviews, I doubled the ingredients so as to make a 9x13. And I completely forgot to add the vanilla since it's not mentioned in the steps. It still came out so yummy. I did really have to pack everything down in the 9x13 because I found the mixture very fall-apart and crumbly. I would definitely call this a success, and I will be making it again for sure. My husband now refers to this as "crack," and he has said it is the best dessert I've ever made. Big compliments for a super-easy dessert.

A simple tasty recipe! The other reviewers were correct in saying to double the recipe to fit a 9x13 pan. I forgot, though, to double the cereal:( I ended up with extra gooey and chocolatey treats that actually were still pretty delicious. I will definitely remember to measure out enough cereal next time. The only problem I had was the bars got a bit soggy after 2 days. Perhaps that won't be the case when I make this recipe correctly next time.

OMG!! So easy and so, so yummy. Definitely a keeper. Made a double batch. Get out all the ingredients ahead of time so you don't forget the vanilla.

These are a really good treat. As others suggested, I didn't use the vanilla. Agree there is something off on the recipe amount to pan size. I made a few batches to fill the pan and thicken them up. My daughter thought there wasn't enough marshmallow so we threw in a few extra. I also ran out of mini chocolate morsels so had to use regular size for a batch, they melted just fine.

Great recipe. But  I made some minor changes

1.  Double recipe .. it spreads better in the 13 x 9 pan.

2.  Do not remove pot from heat after boiling corn syrup. The chocolate sets up too quickly. Reduce  heat as low as it can go and stir in remaining ingredients.  

3.  After bars set in refrigerator,  bring back  to room temperature before cutting .

I added the vanilla in with the corn syrup. I also sprinkled the top with marshmallows and colored sprinkles when done to make it pretty. Was a huge hit.

The vanilla was not written in the instructions, so I added it to the chocolate mixture before the cereal was added.  This recipe does not fit a 9 x 13 pan, which is a bit frustrating when you realize that after doubling the recipe and placing it in two pans.  I altered it by making one 9x13 pan with thick bars.

I doubled the recipe, using a whole 12oz box of Golden Grahams and put in a buttered 9X13 dish. So simple and fast, thankful for this recipe! Delicious!

These are awesome! Used milk chocolate chips instead and added the vanilla once chocolate was melted. Dropped a spoonful into muffin cups and done. Supper quick and easy! I did add to much vanilla on my second batch (about 1 tsp.) they still we good.

This is something I would make for the kids if their friends showed up and I had nothing else to make them. Kinda like chex mix. Simple and easy.

It is not, however, a dessert I would prep for or go out of my way to make.

This recipe is amazing. I made it to take to a gathering had to make a second one because everyone wanted to try it. Huge family it. Didn't change anything but the pan size . I always read reviews and smaller pan was recommended and I use 8x11 worked perfectly because I didn't want them too thick.

With all this sugar, you can't go wrong. :D  The kids loved it.  So easy to make.  I even had them help me make it.  It was a great dessert for the evening.  I definitely will be doing it again.

I couldn't even spread it to the corners of the pan. Next time I will use a smaller pan.
