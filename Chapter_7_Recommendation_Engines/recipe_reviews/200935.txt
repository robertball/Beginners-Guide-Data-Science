This recipe is AWESOME!!!!!    Simple and incredibly inexpensive to make (only *5* main ingredients + all of them can be purchased in large quantities for very little money = not too shabby!).    I made a big pot of this meal for less than $10.  You can't beat it for the amount of rich flavor you get out of this easy recipe.  You won't be disappointed (I could praise this dish all day!).    I can't wait to stop being full so I can eat more of it.  I will definitely be making this again.  SUGGESTIONS ----------------- -Triple or quadruple this recipe because you will want to share it with everyone you know!  Plus, it makes for great leftovers.  -Before adding potatoes to sauce with peas, mash the peas in the sauce or put the peas in a food processor and give a slight chop on them before adding to sauce.  -Season with salt (black truffle finishing salt works great), fresh coarsely ground pepper, and a generous amount of turmeric.  It will change your life.  :)  -I used medium russet potatoes (which are less than $5 for a huge bag) and had no flavor issues.  Baby red potatoes probably would have added to the flavor, but I didn't feel like running to the store to make that kind of commitment.  -I honestly don't know what shelled English peas are, but I used store-brand frozen peas and everything was terrific.

This recipe was a perfect rendition of the old time dish my grandma used to make me growing up on the farm.  It's very simple and the flavors of the vegetables are really able to shine.  I recommend using fresh peas and red potatoes from the garden or local farmer's market. The supermarket just won't be the same.

This was delicious! I altered the recipe a little bit by using 1/2 c. heavy cream instead of milk. I didn't have English peas so I substituted with Birds Eye Steamfresh frozen peas that I microwaved for only 3 min. so they wouldn't get overcooked. I added some parsley when I added the salt and pepper just before serving. I served this with baked stuffed salmon and it was wonderful. My husband said he could have made a meal out of this recipe alone....and he loves salmon! I'll definitely make this again.

Add a couple tablespoonfuls of minced white onions to the melted butter and sautee them until soft.  Continue with the rest of the recipe and you may even like this yummy recipe even better!

This was my fiance's flashback request.  He said it tasted just like grandma's...with a little spunk.  I doubled the recipe because I knew he would love it, and I added some sour cream because I didn't have quite enough milk.  However, I, myself am not a big fan of peas...but I just adore this recipe!!!  This recipe is tucked into my back pocket, to use many more times in the future!!!

This is exactly how my mother used to make creamed peas and potatoes.  She always used fresh peas and potatoes from the garden, but  I used frozen peas and skipped step #2.  I just thawed them out and then added them directly to the cream sauce.  I know this says to serve immediately, but I like to let it sit for 5 - 10 minutes before serving because the cream sauce will thicken as it cools.

I had fresh peas from the garden and remembered my grandmother making this recipe, although I think she used heavy cream. I like that it is made with milk and not heavy cream. I did not think it was bland at all...I did a lot of pepper though. Thanks for a great recipe and memory!

Not my cup of tea. Wanted to try something different, but it was too milky/starchy/bland for my taste.  Ended up washing out the milk and re-purposed into mashed potato salad. Oh well, it was easy, and worth a try.

I skipped the potatoes entirely (didn't feel like cooking them), and just made the white sauce for peas. It was delicious and felt rich, even with milk instead of cream. I'm definitely looking forward to trying it with the potatoes next time.

Very bland, even after adding lots of salt and pepper (more than I would normally add to anything.)  I suppose I might blame the fact that I didn't have fresh peas, and used frozen instead... so make sure you like your peas before you put them in!  Even so, I think it could use lots of cheese, or garlic, or really any flavor other than what's here... but these are at least decent guidelines for a base white sauce.

very yummy! I added a little plain yogurt with the milk to thicken it up. Needed quite a bit of salt, but was still good.

This a variation to Creamed Peas and New Potatoes my family has enjoyed for years. Of course is it best with fresh peas and new baby potatoes, but frozen peas and any potatoes will work.
What I do: Cook the peas, potatoes and chopped onion (about 1/2 Cup) in in a covered sauce pan with just enough water (about 1/2 cup) so it doesn't scorch until the potatoes are tender. Remove from heat and drain reserving cooking water. Add this water to milk (fat free half & half works great) so you have 1 cup. Follow step 3 in the recipe. Adding a slice of american cheese gives it an added richness.
If have peas with edible pods, these are great and add some extra pea flavor. Just chop them to the size you desire.

4.5  Easy Peasy!!!  Lovely, subtle side dish.  Sit and watch TV and shell your English Peas although I am sure other fresh peas would work just as well.   Salt and Pepper are the only additions needed.

What comfort food!  I tried a fresh twist with ingredients on hand.  That meant using buttermilk and frozen pea pods, plus 1/2 - 1 cup of diced ham and then finishing it off with 2 Tbs. of half and half.  We garnished it at table with grated cheddar cheese.  A more colorful meal with a pleasant tang.

Absolutely delicious.  My mom used to make this dish and it turned out just like her's.  I also doubled the sauce and added some mushrooms.  This is a keeper and will definitely make again.

Easy!!  Old fashioned goodness!  I used russets in place of reds (just used what I had on hand), and frozen peas.  Strangely, I didn't have milk but did have heavy cream. It turned out great!  I added a little bit of minced onion to the browning roux because I had some on hand. Will make thus again!

I liked this. It had a simple and nice comfort food quality. For the peas, I just defrosted some frozen sweet peas. That worked fine. I liked how it had the filling creaminess of the thickened milk without using a bunch of butter or heavy cream like other creamed recipes making it lighter. I even used reduced fat milk and it still thickened up fine. Make sure to cut the potatoes as suggested, so that they soak up plenty of the milk sauce too.

Love this recipe!  My grandma makes it too, and when my husband tried hers, he said we have to make this at home!  She of course doesn't have a recipe just adds stuff here and there.  I need written instructions!  Thanks Berta we love it!

This is a good, basic recipe that has spanned the generations. When fresh peas are out of season, I just add frozen peas to the boiling potatoes 4-5 minutes before the potatoes are done.  Good stuff.

Made this tonight and it was wonderful. I mostly followed the recipe exactly but added 1-2 tbsp chopped onion sauteed in the butter + an extra tbsp, a little s&p, and a sprinkle of turmeric, and a small amount, 1/2 tsp minced garlic. Lovely!   Judi D.

Made it according to the recipe, though I did add a shallot and a little bit of garlic. Very adaptable to whatever you have. You just can’t beat a good white sauce. Very yummy and traditional. Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty much what a person would expect from Creamed Peas and Potatoes.  Good old fashioned, inexpensive food.  I think I'll sprinkle these with bacon bits next time.

I followed this recipe because it was very simple. I have been fighting a nasty cold so my ingredients were portioned to make a nice creamy soup. I also added a cup of kernel corn because why not? :) 

I didn't have regular cow's milk; I only had Vanilla flavored almond milk for the soup, however with the right seasoning it didn't make the soup taste sweet sweet. The soup is great for vegetarians!

Thank you very much for this recipe.  I made this for my Dad as this was his Mom's special summer meal using new potatoes and fresh baby peas just picked from her garden.  I struggled over the yearsto recreate it as she didn't write a lot of recipes down but finally this recipe was exactly like hers (it brought back a ton of happy memories of being in Grandma's kitchen).  I added a dash of garlic and onion powder (just a little) as she used to.  Nothing tastes better than mashing the potatoes and peas on your plate with the cream!  Yum!!

This was okay, but it was pretty bland, even when I added salt and pepper. The creamy sauce part really didn't add much to the dish aside from a thick texture. On the bright side, it was super cheap and easy to make. I think I'll only be making it again if I have the ingredients left over from something else, I don't think I'll be buying the ingredients specifically to make the dish.

I used this as a base recipe for a childhood favorite (creamed new potatoes, aka new potatoes in thickening) and it was a good start.  I added a good bit of water to it to make it more like my mama's recipe.  I also left out the peas....

My grandmother made creamed peas and new potatoes and this tasted just like hers! I had fresh new potatoes from the garden but used frozen peas. I did use half 2% milk and half 1/2 & 1/2. I also doubled the sauce recipe. Very good and the leftovers reheated well.

My husband loved it!! The only thing I did different was add mushrooms.   I know I would've loved it also  if I wasn't on this darn eating plan to lose weight.  But you can bet I will make it and have a big bowl of it as soon as I can!!

This is a great basic recipe to an old standby my nom used to make. I make exactly as stated, but usually add a few skies of thyme and nutmeg and it's a perfect side dish for my taste!

Add 1/2 cup pearl onions to the peas. When plated, top with diced chives. Then it's five stars!

My husband has always talked about how he and his grandpa would make this dish with tiny potatoes and freshpeas from the garden.  We finally planted a garden this year and I made this for lunch today.  Hubby says it's just like he remembered.  I did sub snap peas and cooked them in the white sauce to save a step, then added the par-cooked potatoes.  Garnished with chives and parsley.  delicious and filling!
