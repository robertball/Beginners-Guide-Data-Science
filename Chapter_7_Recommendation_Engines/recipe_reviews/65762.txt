Great wine sauce and very easy to prepare. Best compliment from last night's dinner: "downtown good."  

I used 2/3 potency beef demi glaze instead of broth, which I think helped reduction process and maybe added to flavor? Also did a side of shrooms w/butter sauce, and a side dish of blue cheese crumbles.  Most put shrooms on steak, then the reduction sauce as well as a sprinkle of b.c. crumbles. Had 6 people to dinner so had to make a second batch, but that allowed extra dabs. Enjoy.

TRULY SPECIAL!  This is delicious. I used basil over thyme and it was perfect. Oonly prob I had was the reduction, still a lot of liquid after 30 minutes cooking. Will try with beef consumme next time as it is already thicker than regular broth.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband made this for me tonight and we love it!  He reduced the measurements of wine to 1/2 and the broth to 3/4 of what is stated.  The reducing time took no more than 20 mins using these ratios. In addition he also used mushrooms, two slices of bacon, 3-4 green olives and gargonzola instead of the bleu cheese.  Gotta give it a try.  I'm not a fan of olives, but this was a hit!!!

This was great. We used the thyme and shallots. The sauce turned out a little too watery. It could be because I didnt reduce the liquid enough, or possibly because the heat was too high when I added the cheese. We also used Gorgonzola only because its my favorite. We will definately make this again!!

This was wonderful -- I even forgot the thyme/basil at the end. I used sherry I had on hand instead of port, and used Danish Blue cheese. I reduced it for about 20 minutes and at the end stirred the cheese into the sauce, which thickened it up a bit. Was very flavourful. I didn't have olives, so I subsituted mushrooms. Will make again for sure.

I needed a quick way to cook the filets with a "fancy" sauce and this was great.  My only change was to slice the onions and I didn't use the olives since I ran out of them.  I served it with mashed potatoes (the gravy was great on them!) and brocoli with butter sauce.  Thanks submitter - this was excellent.

the sauce was tasty, but not very attractive. Very runny, even though I reduced the sauce. Served it with a beef tenderloin.

Mu husband did like this. The only reason I am so so it because I don't like olives or blue cheese. But did eat it and did have taste. Will make it again for him. Thanks again

Good. I used chopped black olives instead of slices because that is all I had. My husband actually liked this better than I did and would have rated it a 5. The sauce still was thin despite reducing it for a lot longer than the recipe called for. Anyway, this went very well with the Bermuda Onion Spinach Salad from this site (see reviews).

Fairly easy and tasted quite good. Like other reviewers it took longer than 20 min to reduce. I have a gas stove and can control heat accurately-it still took 40 min. Well worth it-will make again.

This had such great flavor. I didn't have port wine so I used 1/2 cup of red wine and 1/4 cup of additional beef broth. I also didn't use the olives. I will definately be making this again.

I decided to use gorgonzola and followed the rest of the recipe to a "T".  We found it was a tad bland.  The consistency and everything was perfect (I as well simmered it for a wee bit longer) and I used Consummee rather that broth.  I will try this again with Blue Cheese as I believe that will give it the kick it needs and perhaps put in more than the recipe calls for.  Otherwise a lovely creamy type sauce over the potatos and such.

WOWZERS!!  What a keeper!  Raves from everyone at the table tonight!   We are a generally creative crew in our home kitchen and would not have combined these ingredients without the prompting of a 5 star recipe... and We are sooo glad we did!
Thank you for posting... btw.. I followed the recipe exactly using the blue cheese and fresh basil.

It took 35 min to get it down to a 1/3 reduction, but well worth the effor. We used the roquefort that we had on hand,and served it over ribeyes. Awesome recipe.
