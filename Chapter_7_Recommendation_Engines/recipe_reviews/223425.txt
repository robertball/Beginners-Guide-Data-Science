Thought these were great, i ommitted the oil and added about a half a cup of applesauce, used a half of a cup of honey instead of sugar and added a half of a teaspoon of baking powder. these were moist and rose beautifully. healthy and delicious!

I have no doubt that this recipe has the potential to be a very good muffin recipe, but it just didn't work for me this time. The batter was thick - which by itself is not a problem - but it hardly rose at all.  The muffins were *way* too dense. We bake almost exclusively with whole wheat flour, so it wasn't the whole wheat texture that was getting to me. Our usual pumpkin muffins are light and fluffy, despite being 100% whole wheat. 

I have a suspicion that the recipe should call for baking powder rather than baking soda, as there is really nothing acidic in the batter to activate the baking soda. I checked the recipe 3 or 4 times because I just couldn't believe it was calling for baking soda, but I in the end I didn't go with my gut and just followed the recipe as-is. 

If I make this again, I would definitely substitute baking powder for baking soda. The flavors were very nice, but they can't quite overcome the rest of it. They're not bad enough to throw out, but definitely a big disappointment.

I used only whole wheat flour and changed the sweetener to just 1/2 cup honey.  I did not put the topping on.  These are great tasting muffins!

LOVE these muffins. Wanted a healthy, tasty muffin that let me use up all the extra apples my neighbor gave me. I used one 15 oz can of pumpkin and skipped the oil. I also subbed 1/2 cup of the sugar for raw honey for added health benefits and lower sugar (mixed the honey in with the wet ingredients,) and skipped the topping. After 25 minutes at 350 these were golden, moist and delicious. I think next time I'll skip the sugar altogether and just use honey.

I substituted applesauce for the oil and left off the topping, and added vanilla.  They were amazing! I had no trouble getting them to rise with just the baking soda that was called for. I will make these again, my one year old said, "mmmmmm".

I love muffins in general, but am always looking for ways to make healthy ones that are still tasty.  These are now top of my list!  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable, added baking powder as another reviewer suggested, and also added some vanilla.  They were awesome!  And my toddler loves them as well. :)

So amazing! I made these for the parent breakfast at my daycare.  They were met with great reviews. I did exchange applesauce for the oil to make them a bit healthier.    I wasn't thrilled on how the streusel topping came out, I will maybe leave that off completely the next time.

There wasn't anything special about this recipe for me.  The muffins didn't rise at all, the batter was SUPER thick (so much so that I really had to work just to incorporate all the ingredients together) and the flavor wasn't anything spectacular to me.  They were edible, just not my favorite pumpkin muffin recipe.

Just made these & they are so. good. I only had about 4oz of apple in my freezer, cut the sugar by an additional 1/2 cup, and added a ton of extra ginger & nutmeg, just how I like it! The recipe made 18 for me, and they are really soft and not too sweet. Great recipe.

Loved these muffins,especially since they are whole grain.  I ran out of time to make the topping, but they were wonderful as is.

Excellent muffins. To make them healthier, used just 1 c. of sugar, sub half the oil with applesauce (but not all, or your muffins will be very dense) and leave off the topping. Like others, I used 1 tsp. baking powder in addition to the baking soda, and it rose beautifully.

Moist and soft. A little on the bland side. Could use a little more spice.

I just made these and I wanted to make extra and use my whole can of pumpkin so I used a little bit more of everything- I cut back on the sugar and used applesauce in place of oil. I skipped the topping and they turned out yummy. I spread some cream cheese on mine and its really hard to eat just one!

These were great muffins.  I grated the apples since that was easier than dicing them.  I used honey instead of sugar and they turned out well.  I will make them again.

Really yummy. The streusel on top gave it just the right amount of sweet/crunch. 
I made this exactly as it's written - raw sugar and all. :)

I had some dehydrated pumpkin, apples, pears, & nectarines onhand that I harvested & dried last season from our little orchard & garden that I’m itching to use in something.  I’ve been dehydrating everything imaginable for a few years now.  And boy does it come in handy. 

So I went looking for a recipe to use them all, if possible.  This is what I found and adapted. Original recipe in the photos & my changes noted below. 
——————————-

*Pumpkin Apple fruit muffins & crumb topping.  

My recipe alteration notes:

Used 1 cup dried apples, 1/2 cup dried  pears, & half cup dried nectarines from my own harvest & processing.   Reconstituted (with skins) with an apple, raspberry, cranberry fruit juice mix. 

Used 4oz of dried pumpkin (my own) which yielded 12oz reconstituted  with hot water(instead of 8oz in recipe)

Added 1/3 cup dark molasses
Added 1/2 tsp baking powder
Added 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts
Added double the pumpkin pie spice 
(I did up the pumpkin by 50%, so more spice).  

Used light brown sugar instead of raw for topping
Added 1/4 tsp ground cloves to topping
Added 1/4 cup crushed walnuts to topping. 

I baked 8 minutes longer than recommended due to my extra ingredients. 

Used a locally grown and freshly stone ground whole wheat flour from Gaston’s Mill at Beaver Creek State Park, OH.  

This recipe is a keeper for me!   Next time I’m gonna add a touch of bourbon, spiced rum, or other liquor to the fruit reconstitution process.

I added 1 tsp vanilla in case the flavour of the whole wheat flour was strong. I don't think it necessarily needed it though. They were so flavorful, delicious and moist! A hearty fall treat!

These are so good! I followed the recipe to a T. I was skeptical about the lack of acid & the thickness of the batter, but the apples made up for it! I used honeycrisp.

Just made these muffins as a quick breakfast item. I cut back on the sugar, used coconut oil instead veg oil. Batter was pretty thick/hard to mix so I added 1/2 apple sauce. I also added flax meal and would have added chia seeds if we had some. Did not do the toppping. Looking to keep the muffin healthy.  For my purpose (quick/healthy snack) they were perfect.

Love the combo of pumpkin (in my freezer) and apples (a couple old ones in the fridge.) Also appreciate the whole wheat flour. I didn't do the struesel topping and will probably cut down the sugar next time, but a great recipe for breakfast and snacks!

My kids and I LOVED these. I did make some changes... Used only 1 scant cup of raw sugar and no apples. I topped some with the streusel and some with just sugar crystals. Those were just as good (and one less step). I will try another reviewer's suggestion next time and use baking powder. I didn't mind the density, but I wouldn't mind trying to lighten them.

I used half coconut oil and half unsweetened apple sauce instead of 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, as well as adding raw pumpkin seeds to the topping! Yummy

I didn't have wheat flour on hand, so I used all purpose instead. Swapped homemade applesauce for the oil and omitted the topping. These turned out wonderful! A perfect muffin for fall!

I used the recipe to make bread instead of muffins and it is delicious! I love that it has much less oil than other pumpkin bread recipes. The batter was very very thick so I added a little bit of milk to thin it out. I also added about a cup of walnuts because walnuts in bread is delicious.

I took the advice of another reviewer and added some baking powder, about a teaspoon I think. I also added walnuts and used regular sugar since I didn't have raw sugar. These were delicious. Hearty, not too sweet, and nice and fluffy.

I made this gluten free. I substituted the wheat flour with almond flour and the all purpose flour with gluten free all purpose flour. I always use mayonnaise instead of vegetable oil. This makes cakes, muffins and breads very moist. I did add 1/2 tsp of xanthum gum. Changing the flours seems to work on all recipes to make them gluten free. Also gives many options for baking gluten free. We love this recipe. The muffins are very scrumptious! Love the crumb topping.

Followed recipe exactly for the muffins but left off the topping in the interest of time. They were so delicious and a huge hit a brunch! A great way to use-up the partial can of pumpkin I had in the refrigerator. I will definitely be making these again!

Wasn't sure what "raw" sugar was.  I used Turbinado sugar in recipe and topping.  it was delicious, especially the topping--nice and crunchy.  Also, added the baking powder.  Had no canister of pumpkin spice so just used about 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and lesser amounts of nutmeg, cloves and ginger.  Took a bunch to church and 1 man said they were so good he ate 2!

This has become a favorite in my house. I hide all kinds of goodies in there and my husband just eats it up, he even took it to work and the guys wanted the recipe. Takes some effort but well worth it!

I've made these twice now, and the second time was much better after I did a bit of modifying. I used an entire small can of pumpkin; decreased the oil to 1/4 cup; substituted 1/4 cup brown sugar plus 1/2 cup of white sugar; added about 3 cups chopped apples; and since I didn't have pumpkin pie spices, I used a mixture of 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of cloves, nutmeg and ginger. Baking time was about 19 minutes. It made 24 muffins. They are very moist. I didn't put any topping on them, since I like to have them available for a snack. I thought the heavy dose of wheat flour would make them too dry, but I think the extra pumpkin and apples helped keep the moisture in. These freeze well and are quite yummy!

Very good. I used whole wheat pastry flour, brown sugar instead of raw sugar, and skipped the topping. They don't need it.

These were just ok. I made as directed, except subbing applesauce for the oil, and I cut the topping in half. The muffins don't have a lot of flavor; there is some pumpkin flavor but the apple chunks dominate. They also don't rise much, as other reviewers have noted. So if I did it again, I'd add more spices (cinnamon in the batter, nutmeg, cloves, something!) and maybe baking powder. And maybe shred the apple instead of dice.
