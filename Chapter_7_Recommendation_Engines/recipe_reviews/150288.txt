This was awesome.  You can't go wrong with a portobella sandwich.  I've made them before but not with the citris dressing or roasted peppers.  If you like it try marinating the mushroom in a teriyaki sauce...yum!

Yummy! I used a smoked gouda and seasoned rice vinegar in place of the balsamic vinegar. I also roasted the red peppers myself. So much better than the jarred. Besides, it makes the house smell so good!

This was yummy! The only changes I made were I used provolone cheese instead of Gouda, only because I had the provolone on hand, and I used an English muffin instead of the sourdough roll (again, its what I had). The citrus mayo really made the sandwich. Will definitely make again!

There are some good ideas in this recipe, including the citrus mayo, however it didnt impress. Next time i wont use balsamic vinegar in the marinade, and i'll try goat cheese to give it more of a kick.

Very tastey!  Oddly, the roasted red pepper, smoked gouda and citrus mayo also make a delicious sandwich with a fried egg.

Turned out great! First time I ever followed a recipe and they were very easy to make. Will make them again for myself.

We LOVED this! The combination of flavors was wonderful.  I did grill a few onions and throw them on, but everything else was as written.  Wonderful!!

This was my lunch today!  I was really a happy camper!  I don't care so much for smoked gouda, so I used a blend of Swiss and gruyere, and the mixed greens turned out to be just arugula.  This made a wonderful sandwich for me on Chef John's Homemade Hamburger Buns.  I will for sure make this again!  Thanks, sierra!
