This is quite an old, "traditional" Russian food. "Pirogi" simply means "pie." If you make a regular pie, this is the word you should use. Pirogi are usually baked. "Pirozhki" is a diminutive word for "pirogi" and means "little pie" or can even be equated with the word for a "turnover." These can be baked or fried. "Vareniki," usually refers to a type of a dumpling or the preparation of "pirozhki" by boiling. Russian vareniki are boiled and then, sometimes after that, are also quickly fried in butter so tat they don't stick together as much.

This made very delicious pierogis but I found the dough difficult to work with, as I have carpel tunnel and it was nearly impossible to combine on my own. I would imagine a kitchen aide mixer with a dough attachment would make this a breeze, I wish I woulda been warned!

This is the recipe my Mom used to make. The only difference being that she added some dill to the cottage cheese filling.

Just the way my Baba made them.  Takes some time to roll and fill them all but well worth it.  We like melted butter and fried onions on ours.

This dough seemed very difficult to work with.  But the filling is delicious!  I added chopped onion with the cottage cheese and egg mixture and I'm very surprised how tasty it is.

This is a great recipe!  My family loves pierogis and this recipe makes it easy.  I use a potato and cheddar cheese filling instead of the cottage cheese since that's how we've always had them.  I've made double batches and frozen half, but the dough isn't the same once it's been frozen.

this recepy askes for milk and ussualy i use water insted and add one egg to it. if dough is sticky try to add little more flour to it. its best if you knead it with your hands. i make mine with mashed potatoes. when you make perogis try not to get potatoes into the seems. otherwise the potatoes will leak out. i make my dough round, not square. on top i use fried bacon. sometimes nicely browned onions and sourcream. make sure you add some butter to prevent from sticking when you take it out of the water. they are also very tasty when fried in little bit of butter next day.

This was very simple and very good.  I had a lot of cottage cheese (costco size) and needed to use it up.  I used the dry type that was almost like try cream cheese.  I added grated mozzarella cheese (about a cup) and small chucks of old cheddar just to give some variety.

Great recipe! When the dough ingredients were mixed together I thought it was too wet to be any good but when I rolled it out on the floured board it all came together really well. Used a pint glass to make round pirogi and filled them with equal parts potato, sauted onion and cheddar cheese- they were delicious!

I liked the dough it worked very well it was a little doughy so I will roll it thinner next time. I will use a different filling with just a little more flavor.

I tried this recipe twice and could never get the dough to work. I only have a hand held mixer which may have been the problem.
