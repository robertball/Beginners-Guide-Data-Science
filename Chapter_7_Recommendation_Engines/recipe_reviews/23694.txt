Easy and delicious dish!  I adapt it to how my family makes it (I am Portuguese) and take out the tomatoes and add some olive oil.

My family also does not make this with Tomato. Every Christmas eve I look forward to this meal, it is the only time of the year that we make it.   I think that thing I love most about this dish is that my Dad always tells the history of this dish. It was invented in Portugal during the Spanish Inquisition. It proved that you were Christian because if you were a Jew you would not eat the pork (Or Clams) and if you were an Arab you would not eat the Clams. From there it turned into the must have dish for Christmas Eve in all Portuguese Households.   Traditionally it is served with cube fries.

Made this for my Portugese boyfriend.  He said it was great and liked it better than his own.  He especially loved the sauce, only wished there was more of it.  Needs more cilantro than called for. (1/2 cup  or more)
