I'm from Upper Michigan where we're famous for our pasties.  We use ground beef, potatoes, carrots, onion and rutabega in ours.  Serve with ketchup or brown gravy.  To reheat if frozen, bake at 350 on a cookie sheet for one hour.  To reheat if thawed, bake at 350 for a 20-30 minutes, or microwave on High for 8-10 minutes.

I have lived in the Upper Pennisula of Michigan. My grandma was a full swede and we NEVER put carrots into a pasty it changes the flavor. Pork and beef, onion, potato, and rutabagas only. This is a good basic recipe to follow.

This is the closest to real pasties that I've found.  I used 85% ground beef instead of the pork and turnips for the rutabagas,  just because turnips are good with beef.  This recipe is a great basic recipe and easily adapted to each persons tastes.

This was a very tasty recipe.  I didn't have rutabagas (probably never would, either!), so I substituted carrots.  Also, it would have been dry without some gravy, so I made some brown gravy to go over the pasties, and served them with a nice green salad.

I too substituted leftover roast beef and carrots for the pork and rutabagas.  It came out a little dry - I will definitely add more butter on top of the meat and vegetables next time.  Pretty tasty.

This recipe is excellent, but in the future I will omit the potatoes or reduce the quantity. 5 are too many to stuff into this much dough. Instead of the recipe for the crust, I used the Oil Pie Crust recipe submitted by Donna, which is easy and good. It is cholesterol-free! Hint: Do not line the pan with parchment or waxed paper unless you want to eat some of it.

Awesome stuff. I used some venison for the meat and cut down on the potatoes--I still had more filling than dough, but these were so good I might just make another batch of pie crust so we can have them again! I made four and DBF ate three, so they were definitely a hit with him, thanks for a great recipe!

I like the flavor of this pastie.  I will definitely make this recipe again in the future.  Although next time I will cut the amount of potato in half because they were very full (almost exploding) and I didn't use all the potato called for.

I will try this again, I filled the crust too full and had a hard time sealing them.  I also used carrots instead of rutabaga and served with gravy.  Very filling, but a lot of work.

to make pasties, I was taught to use ground beef (80/20), and add a small can of cream of mushroom or chicken to the beef. It keeps the inside moist and flavorful.

This one is as close to the ones my Grandma and Mom made who taught me well. Only change I make is used a cubed medium cut of Beef or Pork, Onions, and Potato.  Oh and since I can't make a pie crust to save myself I use premade Pie Crust such as Pillsbury Pie Crust.  AND NEVER USE GRAVY on  PASTIES!!!!!!!!!

I did make my own dough, so this took a bit longer and more clean up.  Also used half pork and half beef.  They are very tasty!

Fantastic! I did add some gravy to the inside of my pastie and it was awesome.  Doing so means it's no longer the traditional pastie, but the flavor was amazing.  I used half of a store bought pie crust for each.  I made a double batch freezing the half we didn't bake.  We're looking forward to having it again.
