A perfect breakfast dish for those watching their carbs. This would also be great with the addition of diced onion and green pepper. I added crumbled bacon on top.

Great recipe! If using Parmesan go easy on the salt or skip it all together.  Also, allow longer cooking time I the skillet to get it to have a hash brown type texture.  Great side dish!

Ever since I started a low carb way of eating,( never diet!), I have been on the hunt on Allrecipes, as well as elsewhere, to find delicious low carb dishes and this one fits the bill! To this dish I added a sprinkling of sharp chedder cheese,green onion and cubed,(no sugar added) breakfast ham. Even my califlower despiser hubby liked it!

I made this last night and followed the recipe to a “t”. It was terrific! I served with a nice grilled rib eye, another All recipe suggestion for zucchini pasta, a watermelon/blueberry salad with balsamic vinegar, and a delicious Greg Norman 2016 Paso Robles cabernet. It was a very nice meal enjoyed by all involved.

If eating for a 'breakfast' egg scramble then it's what I would expect.  I added onions, garlic and raisins for a little more flavour.  Could experiment a little more and will do when I make it again.

This is creamy and the green onions are a perfect touch. I've made this recipe several times and even placed in tortillas with grated cheddar cheese. Great for on the run.

This was so good that I took it away from my indentured servants. Simply too tasty for them to get any.

Super good! Browning it was a longer process but seems to make it even yummier. It’s going on my “make again” list. Next time I will put it raw in my food processor, add a little water, nook it in the micro in a large bowl, then toss the ingredients in and dump it all into a hot buttery skillet. I think it would be quicker. That’s how I make my microwave cilantro cauliflower rice.
