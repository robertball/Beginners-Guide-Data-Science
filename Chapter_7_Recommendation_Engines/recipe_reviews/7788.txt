I made this cake for a girls' weekend at the lake.  Everyone enjoyed it, but I don't know if it's actually better than Brad Pitt!  Couple of changes would make it better.  Using whipped topping in place of heavy whipping cream combo and using half the recommended pudding.  The pudding seemed to overpower the pineapple.  Will make again most definitely.

Tasty and easy, and a nice change from the various "Chocolate Suicide" desserts served everywhere. Be warned, however, that it is *extremely* sweet. I'd suggest small servings. I'm wondering if using lemon pudding instead of vanilla would cut some of the sweetness ... or reducing or even eliminating the sugar added to the pineapple.

I made this for a summer cook out.  It was well received by all and several people commented on how it was a light, perfect summer dessert.  I added chopped pecans on top, along with the toasted coconut.  I also substituted reduced fat nondairy whipped topping instead of the whipped cream.

This cake is our new family favorite. We have had it on several occasions.I haven't "had" Brad Pitt, but this cake really rocks! For a variation replace the crushed pineapple with peaches. we call it Better than Joh.nny Depp cake

My family loved this recipe. I did not change a thing. It was a little too much for the family of 5, so next time I am making it for our potluck at church!

AWESOME cake.  I really enjoyed this, even though it is really rich and decadent...i only changed the cake from yellow to butter because thats what i had, and i used one instant vanilla with one white chocolate.  DO NOT SKIP THE TOASTED COCONUT, it is soooo good on this cake.  I loved it, is it better than brad pitt??? It gave him a run for his money, but i will always be weak for brad!

UPDATE: MY HUBS AND I STOPPED BY MY PARENTS HOUSE TODAY TO PICK UP THE BAKING DISH I SENT THEM HOME WITH (I.E. THE ONE I USED FOR THIS CAKE). WE ARRIVED RIGHT AS THEY WERE FINISHING DINNER, SO I HAD A PIECE OF LEFTOVER CAKE WTIH THEM. NOT ONLY DID I FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS, I LEARNED AN IMPORTANT LESSON.... THIS CAKE IS 100 X'S BETTER IF ALLOWED TO SET FOR AT LEAST 24 HOURS (OR MORE!) AND PREPARED AS IS (NO MODS NECESSARY)!!! I'M NOT SURE WHY, BUT TRUST ME, A NIGHT IN THE FRIDGE IS KEY. :) Not bad. My hubs and I treated my parents to a belated father's day dinner out. I made this cake to cap off our hearty Italian meal. Although I liked this (my hubs not so much - he isn't fond of any dessert other than chcolate cake lol), my parents were MUCH bigger fans that I was. I think I would have enjoyed this quite a bit more WITHOUT the pudding and if the pineapple were mixed in with the whipped topping. Don't get me wrong.... This was good, it was just a smidgin over the top for me. NOTE #1: Instead of making a syrup out of pineapple and sugar, just warm up a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple in heavy syrup (it's pretty much the same thing and involves less work!). NOTE #2: It is perfectly fine to substitute prepared Cool-Whip rather than making your own. Yes, homemade is prolly better, but it's OK to cheat (and no one will know the difference). Thanks for sharing your recipe, Star. Since my parents really enjoyed this so they will be eating the leftovers all week. :-)

I thought this was good, but not great. A little too sweet, I think I would've preferred draining the pineapple and just spreading it straight over without the step where you add sugar and cook it. That's just me though, everyone else really liked this. Thanks for the recipe!

What comes from my kitchen is not normally praised.  But I made this cake for the Sunday dinner finale......and boy did it make an impact.  My parents came over after church and they, along with my husband, said it was the best dessert they had EVER had.  What a compliment.  Thanks for an easy recipe that even I could follow.

I really liked this! Spongy & creamy delicious. It weighs a lot, so consider this when choosing the container you use to prepare it. Would totally make this again.

OMGG!!...Oh my gosh goodness..unbelievably great!  Can't wait to try this recipe with chocolate cake, chocolate pudding and cherries.  This one is not to sugary sweety, but full of delightful flavors.  As others raters said, don't skip on the coconut..it really adds that something with a mouth wanting more feeling.  Being I haven't had Brad Pitt either, I am calling it Oscar (awards) Cake, cause that's when I found the recipe, or Better than Yo' Mama's cake, cause I have never had anything this yummy.  Both my husband and Father in law loved it...wanted more and more and want to know when the next special awards are : )  I'm thinking a wonderful Easter Day treat with fresh strawberries on top.  Wonderful recipe..thanks for sharing

Excellant!  A delicious change from the usual chocolate versions.  Since finding this recipe I have made it numerous times for assorted potluck situations and always with rave reviews.  Great with pineapple, lemon, or butter cake and pudding variations.

Outstanding. I think what makes this so good is the real whipping cream. I get lazy at times and use cool whip. But the cream is better.

I tried it 2 weeks ago following the exact recipe,  but today I made it with white cake mix, sweetened chopped strawberries, vanilla pudding cups (2), and cool whip.  I topped it off with toasted sliced almonds. Oh boy. Yummy!!!

I followed the directions as they were, except that I used less pudding.  I made 2, 1 oz packages and used the Sugar Free/Fat Free pudding.  I ended up putting about 2/3 of it on the cake.  The cake turned out excellent - very moist and delicious.

Everyone I have ever made this cake for always wants the recipe!   I  am  always asked to make it!
I  do make it how the recipe states but I do add bananas.   I put the pineapple on the cake first,  then I put a thin layer of pudding, sliced bananas, the rest of the pudding last the whipped topping and finally the coconut! Always a big hit!

I made this cake for a church potluck and people were raving about it! And I love the way the coconut glistens on top of the whipped cream...beautiful.

I just got asked to bring this cake again to a family gathering...I think that about says it all. My sister gave me this recipe over 20 years ago...also goes by a different name...like this name better;) The comments are always the same: "This is so moist...it has such a good flavour...I just love this cake!...can I have another slice??"

This cake is so good. Between mouthfuls my husband was saying " Give this recipe 10 stars"! I wish I could because it's that wonderful. Thanks Star for passing along this great recipe, it's far better than Brad!

This cake was good but nothing to rave about. Maybe I'm prejudiced because I think this cake is missing a major ingredient - chocolate! ;^) Seriously though, if you like vanilla you will probably really enjoy this cake.

I tried this recipe for a gathering.  Everyone loved it, they said it was really good.  I thought that it was good and I would make it again.  Though it wasnt all that it was talked about.  I thought it was going to be something really really good.  As other member says, make sure pan is really deep for all the layers.

Delicious!  I followed this recipe to a tee, and it was exceptional!  The cake was not too sweet, and it was so moist...Great to take to a gathering!  I would use cool whip as a topper if I didn’t have any heavy cream:)

Really amazing cake. The pineapple with the toasted coconut is amazing. Keep an eye on the coconut when you're toasting it because it can go VERY fast. Really great flavors.

I've made this twice now for gatherings. One man approached me with a sincere look in his eyes and said "my Mom made a cake just like this" and another coworker has asked my spouse repeatedly if I would make her this cake.
Easy to do, easy to manage and a refreshing change from the chocolates, cherries and peanut butter receipes.
