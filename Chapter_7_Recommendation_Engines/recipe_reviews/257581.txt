This is so good!! I  also skipped the first step, and seared my stew meat instead of boiling it first. I didn't put any chilis in, I didn't want it to be too spicy for my son. I did use 2 tablespoons of Sambal (Chili garlic paste) so I reduced the 10 garlic cloves to 8. Cooked for about 7 hours on low then cranked it up to high about 45 minutes before we ate. We topped it with green onions and sliced red chilies for my husband and I. We will definitely have this again!

I skipped #1 and made it in my pressure cooker for 15 minutes. Made for a very deep flavor. Subbed b. choy for rainbow chard.

It was so good, I forgot to take pictures! It was on the sweeter side, though, more like a teriyaki type flavor than spicy.  My son loved it so much he ate it for lunch the next day, too. You need to store the noodles in another dish, though, otherwise they get soggy.

Great recipe!   Tastes authentic and it’s easy to make.   It was a tad salty for me so next time I’ll use low sodium beef broth and/or low sodium soy sauce or I’ll add more water.   But overall it’s a wonderful recipe!   Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe.  I only had chicken so used that with chicken broth instead.  I will certainly make this again.
