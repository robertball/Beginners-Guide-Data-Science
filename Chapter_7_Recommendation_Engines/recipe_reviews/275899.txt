I doubled the recipe, used a gluten-free cornbread mix and riced cauliflower. I did drain the corn a little.  Since the recipe was doubled and cooked in a 9x13 baking dish, I extended the cooking time. The end result was a corn casserole that you would have no clue had cauliflower in it. It was good but out of personal preference if I were to make it again I'd skip the sugar on top.
