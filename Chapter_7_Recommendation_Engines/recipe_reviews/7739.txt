Sinfully delicious and show stopping masterpiece! However, I didn't use this frosting because, truthfully, it just didn't appear appetizing to me. I made the cake in 8-inch layers for a nice, tall cake. The filling is to die for, and is reminiscent of an Almond Joy candy bar.  I poured a glaze over the top of 4 T. butter melted with 5 ozs. of semi-sweet chocolate, allowing it to run down the sides of the cake. Finally, I  topped the cake with toasted, chopped almonds.  Hubby was in his glory, and said this was worthy of more than 5 stars, the perfect combination of chocolate, gooey and crunchy.  I agree!

Wow! This is a great recipe!  I agree with other reviewers, that there is a mistake in the frosting recipe section- I didn't try it, but just reading it you can see there is something missing.  I decided that I wanted a candy-bar type coating on this cake, so I made a ganache from 1/2 cup evaporated milk, 9 oz. chocolate chips and approximately 2 tb. water.  This gave me a pourable consistency and I spread a thin layer over the cake. It had a dark glossy finish just like a candy bar, but wasn't too sweet.  Fantastic!!!! This is a keeper!

I don't use cake mixes, so I substituted Black Chocolate Cake (with some modifications) submitted to this site by Jeanie. The coconut filling is great. But for the chocolate frosting, I wanted semi-sweet rather than milk chocolate. For this reason I heated 1/2c evap milk, 1 cup sugar, 1t vanilla, 1 stick margarine, and 12ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips. What a great cake! Thanks Leslie! A Chocoholics dream!

Everybody loves this cake!  When I make it though, I use coffee instead of water in the cake mix.  I do this on all my chocolate cakes, it makes them more moist, and helps smooth the chocolate taste.

The coconut filling tastes really good, however, it became really hard when it was time to serve the cake (almost impossible to cut through).  Maybe it was because I put it in the fridge?  Also, after reading the reviews, I ended up making a chocolate glaze using some evaporated milk and semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Next time I won't put it in the fridge and see how that turns out.

The filling for this recipe is absolutely delicious and I will use it again. Other then that I did not follow the recipe. I used a very moist chocolate cake and found that it did not need any extra icing. The filling is so good there is nothing else really needed. Besides a tall glass of milk or coffee! :)

This cake was a hit at my house. Everyone loved it and I had to send some home with everyone. I did however agree with everyone else that the frosting recipe was not correct. I used one of my own frostings and it turned out to be great. I will definitly make this again. It is for sure a candy bar cake!

The coconut filling was delicious! Unfortunately the chocolate cake ruined it. I dipped the leftover coconut in  the chocolate-frosting naples34102 suggested (4 T butter and 140 grams dark chocolate) and that really gave value to the coconut, way better than bounty!!

WHOA! Yes yes yes! A hit! A winner! This was amazing! the changes that I made: I only used 1/3 C sugar. BTW 14 oz. of coconut is translated to 1-3/4 and I used UNSWEETENED. I used Creamy Chocoate Frosting to glaze this please read my review on that because I made lots of changes to kinda fit this and that. I dont know people I'm new here! LOL!

This cake is awesome! The coconut filling is indeed to die for. I would've give this a 5 star if not for the frosting. i used the shiny chocolate glaze recipe instead. My kids had fun decorating the cake with candies. Thanks for sharing:-)

Wonderful- I wanted a chocolate coconut cake for Easter and this was perfect.  

I don't recommend the canned frosting - make your own instead.

This was a hit hit at my house, tasted like a Bounty bar. Thank you:) However I agree with some of the posters who said that the filling was a bit sticky, any suggestions on how to avoid that?

I was really looking forward to making this cake for Valentine's Day, but unfortunately, it was very disappointing.  The coconut filling in particular was a big, sticky mess!  It was difficult to spread on the cake, and after sitting, it hardened so that it was very awkward to eat with a fork and not very pleasant to chew!  I love the idea of dark chocolate and coconut together in a cake, but there has GOT to be a better filling than this!  Also, I iced the cake as suggested by another reader by using the following: 1/2 cup evaporated milk, 1 cup sugar, 1t vanilla, 1 stick margarine, and 12 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips.  This was okay, but WAY too sugary--and this is from someone with the world's biggest sweet tooth!  I would decrease the sugar or possibly even eliminate it altogether.

Ok, first of all, most reviewers here who gave this 5 stars changed something. That's fine, however, if you make the filling AS IS it does come out really sticky and hard to work with. Really delicious, but many complained about not liking the texture of coconut flakes being in the middle of a cake. I would suggest grinding them really fine before heating them to make the filling. Also, I used devil's food cake recipe from this site which made the cake part amazing, and some said it was one of my best cakes yet (paired with the coconut filling). I used chocolate ganache instead of the frosting cited, because it seemed to be flawed. Basically, I am only reviewing the coconut filling here and I would definaltey grind the coconut flakes really fine first, and not boil the milk so long to insure a softer more flexible filling to work with. The taste was really good though.

I absolutely loved this cake and it was so easy to make. After reading other reviews I was nervous to try the icing listed in recipe so made a chocolate ganache I found on this website.

The filling was very good, but I think the frosting was missing an ingredient.  It came out very dry and crumbly.  I added a stick of margarine to make it spreadable.  If I make it again, I will use a chocolate glaze instead of the frosting.

My daughter requested this cake for her birthday and we all thought it was yummy. Instead of using marshmallows I decided on marshmallow cream and had no problem spreading the filling. Like some other reviewers I made a ganache using semi sweet chocolate chips. Thank you so much Leslie!

The coconut filling was very good. I didn't have dark chocolate cake mix on hand so I used a Betty Crocker chocolate fudge cake mix. It came out nice and moist.The filling was a bit difficult to spread. I also made a chocolate ganache that a reviewer suggested. I think it paired well with the cake. I topped it with some shredded coconut and chopped almonds.

Messiest cake I've ever made! Very delicious though and filling tastes like an almond joy. A cup of sugar is quite a bit so if I make it again I will cut out at least a 1/4 cup of sugar. I also used the left over milk and chocolate chips as a glaze.

cake was super tasty. I did follow another persons advice and skip the frosting to go with her recipe...9-10 oz of chocolate chips, 2 tbsp. water, and 1/2 cup of evaporated milk. I made it a 4 layer cake as specified in the recipe, however, once the cake sits for a bit, the filling gets a bit hard and is tough to cut through. Everything about the way it tastes is awesome only next time, I will just make it a two layer cake with one thick layer of filling for a bit more stability in the cake.

I am sorry I almost forgot to say thank you for a lovely cake.  I made it for hubby's birthday (80 yrs. young).  I made white frosting with coconut on top too.  Very pretty and he loved it.

It's true, it's true! It's just like an almond joy. Major yummy-ness for a cake filling. We had the filling with yellow cake - my daughter's birthday request - and a chocolate buttercream frosting. Deelish!

I'm sorry to have say that I give this cake 1 star. It just did not turn out as good as I had hope. It just fell apart. The filling didn't taste like a candy bar it tasted more like macaroons. I just didn't care for it at all.:\  " sigh"

i didn't have a chocolate cake mix on hand so I used a white mix and made a vanilla version.  I made the filling the same except that I substituted 1/4 of sugar with 1/4 cup of icing sugar (personal taste preference).  I used dessert topping mix for the icing. It was amazing.  I would give it 5 stars but I changed to much.  I can't wait to try the chocolate version!!

The filling is great. I agree with another user that this cake is probably better without frosting.

I like this cake but als made some changes... I used a granache instead of the heavy frosting on top.  I also added chocolate pudding to the cake mix to add some moisture and richness to the devils food cake mix.   I wish I had used sweetened condensed milk  - but I did not.  Overall a  nice lush cake  with a great presentation.

The filling was to die for however I didn't like the frosting, so that is why I gave it a four stars.
