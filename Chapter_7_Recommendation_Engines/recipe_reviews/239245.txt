Used skim milk and made this in the blender. If you choose to use the blender, just don't over blend to be sure you get a milkshake consistency rather than a smoothie consistency. I have to admit this was surprisingly good.  Next time, I'll try this with some frozen strawberries, raspberries, or blueberries.

I really enjoy this "Banana Milkshake." I make it all the time with coconut milk and water (instead of dairy milk) since I am dairy intolerant. I like a dash of cinnamon or nutmeg in mine. I find it is an excellent way to make good use of frozen ripe bananas. Thank you Graciebelle for sharing your recipe.

This is one of my favorite low calorie summer treats. I also add Hershey's syrup when I have a chocolate graving and a little vanilla to kick the flavor up a bit.

This reminded me of the milkshakes of my youth. Next time, I'd make sure the milk was  ice cold so the drink comes out very cold.

It was really good in taste. I did not use a blender, so it was not blended well, but it tasted great.

It was very yummy and my husband enjoyed it frozen. It was more like ice cream than a shake for him. Mmmmmm 
I'll probably make this pretty often now.

I must've not mashed it enough or something - because just mashing it ain't cutting it. It's kinda gross with the chunks. It would probably be better if a blender is used.

This "Banana Milkshake" is a staple in our home. It is well known in the Raw Food Community that freezing bananas makes them sweeter (no need for sugar) and a good substitute for "ice cream" when they are run through a Champion Juicer (blank blade) with other fruit (may or may not be frozen) and coconut milk. We typically use coconut milk or another non-dairy milk in our home.  We also add spices, flavorings, and cocoa on occasion to "shake things up a little." Thank you Graciebelle for sharing your recipe.

I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk instead of regular milk. Sometimes I'll add a scoop of vanilla protein powder for extra nutrients.

Easiest shake I've ever made! So simple, yet so delicious. Great way to use all those brown bananas I freeze without a hint of what I'll end up using them for.  I used cashew milk -- I think any type of milk would do.
