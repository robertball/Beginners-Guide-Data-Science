I made these twice now.  The first time I followed the recipe to a tee.  They were great, but the second time I chopped the Rolo's in half as suggested.  The caramel seemed to be more evenly dispersed this way. YUM!

What a unique brownie!  I use this recipe for special occasions and always bring home an empty platter.  I thought the recipe was a little misleading though when it read, "crumble remaining batter over top."  Instead of crumbling, spread the batter.

LOVED these brownies.  The dough is very much like brownie dough - thick and hard to spread.  I wasn't sure how it would turn out that I wasn't "spreading" it on the top layer, but more of dropping it around.  Worked wonderfully, and these were a HUGE hit!

I served these warm from the oven with vanilla ice cream and everyone loved them- check out my photo. Some of the other pictures looked like their brownies were made from a different recipe! My market didn't carry toffee baking bits, so I used a Skor candy bar that I finely chopped, which worked well and added a tasty crunch.  I also cut the Rolos in half as others suggested, pushing the cut side down into the dough.  I have a tip for those having trouble spreading this thick dough into the pan: if you use the back of a plastic spoon or a plastic (not rubber) spatula, it doesn't stick to the dough as much. Also, cutting the brownies with a plastic knife works much better than a metal knife. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Great recipe!  I just made this on the weekend for my sister in law's birthday instead of a cake and everyone loved it!  I used an 8x11 pan instead (the other one seemed just a bit too big) and followed a couple other suggestions cutting down the toffee chips/choc chips to 3/4 c. each.  I aslo used the Hershey caramel kisses (20 of them) and ended up cooking them the 6 mins. at the beginning (same as called for) and about 28 mins. for the second portion.  Decadent treat, thanks Karin!

All I can say is "Wow!".  This recipe was super-easy to make, I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and cut the caramel candies in half, putting the cut side down before baking.  I got so many compliments and requests for the recipe.  Everyone RAVED about them.  Super-easy to make and wonderful results.  This one's a keeper!

Very good! I altered this recipe quite a bit though.  First, I used yellow cake mix.  After baking the first layer of crust, I topped it with Rolo's cut in half (cut face down) which provided a melted caramel layer. Didnt use quite as much choc chips and toffee.  Came out very well!

These brownies were edible, but I was a bit mislead  by the pic's of them, they look like a traditional dense ooey gooey brownie, and mine turned out far from it. They were very cakey (which I should have expected considering they use a cake mix to make them!) I'm lazy and didn't feel like unwrapping 35 rolo candies, so I just bought the individual candy bar rolo's, which come all wrapped in one big foil tube, saves TONS of time!!! Also as stated by so many other's this batter is rediculous to try and spread, even with Pam on your spatula! I made these last night, and I have decided that they are a bad rip off of better than sex cake! I wont be making this again, if I want brownies I find a better recipe (like brooke's bombshell brownies) and if I want better than sex cake I'll just make that!

This recipe is most excellent!  I've been searching this site for a good brownie recipe and my first three attempts at other brownies were disasters.  This one rocks! Really fudgy brownies, perfect for summertime bbq's.  I used an 8x8 pan and it worked perfectly.

Incredible, moist, delectable-looking brownies.  Everyone loved them!  However, there is no "crumbling" remaining mix on top - spread, drop, maybe - but crumble?!

Yummy. Make sure you don't overcook it. Because of all the gooey stuff in the middle, your toothpick won't come out completely clean, even when the brownies are done. This makes it easy to overcook, so watch it. Much better after it has set and cooled for several hours. (Overnight is best)

Very good if you're in a bind (which I was)....only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it still has a cake-like consistency instead of a "brownie" consistency - tasty, nonetheless:)

I made these last night for a dinner party.  I also used someone's suggestion and cut the Rolos in half.  I took them hot out of the oven and put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on them.  Everyone loved them.

This was a really good recipe and pretty easy to make.  However, it was more of a cake texture than a brownie and the dough was difficult to spread.  It might have been better if there was one more egg in the recipe.  On the other hand, the way it is was good with fudge chocolate frosting

These were incredibly rich, so cut them into small pieces.  I took previous reviewers' advice and cut the Rolos in half and I also sprayed my spatula when spreading the batter as it was very sticky.  Delicious and rich!

Rating this based on how I had to make it, with what we had onhand - had to use EggBeaters (who runs out of eggs?? Us, apparently...) the caramel version of Jr. Mints (yea, Dollar Tree.) Made in an 11x7 and was CRAZY hard to spread, even when I sprayed spatula as someone suggested. I expected brownie consistency, but it was total cake texture, and despite the small caramel pieces, sticky to eat. I'll try again with real eggs, Rolos and make sure I use the cake mix that only requires adding water (the one I used called for oil, but I didn't add any - not sure if that affected it.)I'm sure this is fabulous based on other reviews - I just want to indicate what didn't work for me as a reminder the next time I pull this up.

This recipe is awesome! Everyone loved it! I'm trying alternates as suggested by others i.e. caramels, kisses, etc. I personally alternate toffee bits and walnuts. I lightly sprinkled powdered sugar  right before presentation. I'm making them for Christmas and packaging them up as gifts (as requested). Yum!

These are SUPER yummy! I have made these twice now and the first time was exxcelent and the second time I did...I accidently bought a bag of rolo's, reeces and kisses...I used all three candies(cut the reeces and rolos in half) and put them in the mix. It tasted soooo good! I ran out of the dough so the top layer was toffee and choc. chips. I made my own choc. cake mix(healthier. I always have to cook things longer, but I think that's just my oven. FABULOUS recipe! Chewy, gooey, super yummy and worth the calories!

I too can't stand when people massacre a recipe then give it a low rating.  These brownies were great and the only changes I made per other reviews were: I used 9x9 pan (makes it much easier because the batter is really gooey and thick), and 3/4 cup a toffee chips, I thought was plenty.  Cook 5 min. longer because of the thicker pan.

I've made this recipe about 3-4 times now, and its always a big hit.  I get asked for the recipe everytime.  I think the toffee chips add a lot, because you get that nice crunch when you bite into it.  The only issue I run into is the dough is really sticky and hard to spread and it never seems like I have enough for the top layer, no matter how little I put on the bottom.  But that doesn't really affect the taste, so it doesn't matter much.

This was a huge hit at the office. The toffee, choc chips, and Rolo's create a delicious gooey middle layer. The top layer of brownie batter is hard to "crumble" or spread across, so just take a big spoon and drop it down in clumps. It will spread out when it bakes and it's not a huge deal if it doesn't cover everything - I just tried to make sure I at least covered the Rolo's. I almost made my own brownie batter because I don't like to use cake mixes, but I'm glad I followed the recipe because the batter is much thicker than mine would have been. The flavor was still good. I highly recommend this. The longest part is unwrapping the Rolo's and placing them in the pan, but you will be loved when you share these and it will all be worth it!

YUM, YUM, YUM!  I didn't end up having enough batter to fully cover the top and I had to bake them longer than stated.  Other than those issues, a great recipe!

These turned out very good.  It was tricky to get the top layer of brownie mix on evenly, but it seemd to spread as it cooked.  I think I will omit the toffee bits next time because I don't think they added a lot to the flavor (these are very rich and chocolately)  and they tended to get stuck in my teeth.  Next time, I think I will spoon small portions of the dough on the top layer to make it easier to spread.  I used a 10 x 10 pan and it was fine.  Very tasty.

I didn't think the brownie part of this recipe was that great.  I would have preferred to substitute even a boxed brownie mix then added the "extras" like rolos, toffee bits and chocolate chips. It was just ok for us.

I thought I would love these.  But thought it just too much going on in the brownie.  I guess my taste preferences tend toward a simpler brownie.  At the party I served them at about half the people agreed with me and the other half loved them.

After my best friend served us these last weekend, I made these for my Moms group, following the ingredients as written.  They were raved about, and I brought home an empty container!  My husband and kids gobbled them up, too.  Rich and satisfying, my favorite brownie recipe so far!

They were a little crumbly, but good.  I think they would be even better with reese cups instead of rolos.

These brownies were fabulous! I made them for my friends birthday dinner and she LOVED them. They are nice and chewy, in my opinion, the perfect brownie. The only thing missing was the vanilla ice cream, then this would have been over the top delicious! I did cut the rolos in half, then they covered the entire surface of the brownie! Perfect!

Yummy!  I made these for a covered-dish lunch and they were great.  I love the idea of making brownies from cake mix and will be saving that idea for future reference as well.  I used halved caramel cups (Wal-Mart brand...Great Value?) and they were delicious.  I'll try the Rolos sometime, too.  The gooey yumminess inside was a treat.  Instead of 35 pieces, I got 24, I guess because I cut them bigger.  I did use a little extra time for baking because they didn't seem quite done after the written time.

Only downside was that I wasn't able to try them warm with a glass of milk!  I'll be doing that today with what's left :) .  Terrific recipe!

These were very tasty and incredibly easy to make.  I did have some problems with them sticking to the pan; I think it was because I pressed the caramels too far down when I was spreading the batter on top.  I'll definitely make these again.

I have never made brownies before so I was looking forward to making them but by the time I arrived home I was tired but decided to go ahead and make them.  I forgot to put eggs and only realised it after I had put the first layer in the oven. I almost threw out the mixture but decided to keep it. The brownies still tasted sooo good. I will try these again and see how they turn out.  I am from South Africa and don't know what toffee bits/chips are. Is there a substitute that I could use?

My husband asked me to only make these when we have guests coming over because he couldn't stop eating them!  I cut the Rolos in half as suggested by another reviewer.  The mix was VERY hard to spread for me - very thick.

I made these with my 9 yr old daughter for an event. They were so easy to make, yet something special. We split the Rolos in half as previously mentioned, and we baked the brownies  to  the fullest recommended length. They were gooey and candy, and they were a giant, massive hit. As a matter of fact, 3 days have since passed and I am still hearing positive feedback about "those brownies!!"

We will most definitely make again.
