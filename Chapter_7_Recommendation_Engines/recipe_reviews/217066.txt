I made this tonight for my husband and daughter.  The taste was good but next time I will grind the beans before adding to turkey and I will add oil to the skillet.

I loved this recipe! I made a variation though, added some chopped onion, didnt use the egg, and mashed the black beans some to hold it all together better. Yum!

This recipe was just okay. I added chopped garlic instead of garlic powder and used a bit of cooking spray on the pans. I should have used more...the bottoms burn quickly. Definitely eat with lots of barbecue sauce. Some avocado bits also make a pretty good topping.

The black beans just gave it a weird texture. Everything else was fine. I was a little confused by the name. Stuffed to me means inside and the cheese is just mixed in.

Very tasty...so much lighter and healthier than a beef burger!  I used the entire can of black beans because my pack of turkey was 1-1/4lb.  I did not use the bell pepper, I added some dried minced onion, I also added about 3/4 teaspoon of cumin, I forgot the garlic powder but did not miss it.  I mashed the beans with fork before mixing everything up.  I cooked the burgers on a nonstick griddle with a little olive oil.  The burgers were sticky to handle, but were easy to flip once they cooked a while.  I made 6 burgers with this recipe...make sure you flatten them when you put them on the pan, as they will puff up a little when cooking.  If you don't want them too big, make more patties because the ground turkey hardly shrinks at all.

I used green bell peppers instead of red. Seasoned the burgers to taste with the garlic, salt and black pepper while cooking them in the skillet. Smelled real good and taste good aswell. My wife was sort of cautious of the ground turkey instead of beef, but it worked out real well.

My red meat loving hubby and son love these burgers.  I use pimento instead of peppers as I don't care for the crispness of the pepper.  I also substitute pepperjack for the mozzarella.  While we won't be giving up the good 'ol black angus, these are a great alternative.
