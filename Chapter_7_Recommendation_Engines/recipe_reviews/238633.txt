I made this excellent chili with just a few minor modifications. I added in 2 cans of whole kernel corn and 1 yellow bell pepper chopped up. I also added in a can of pitted black olives cut in half for more texture, also sauteed up 2 large chicken breasts and chopped them up for the chicken portion. Very, very good 2 meals!~

Since I am by myself, I cut the cans to 1 each  instead of 3 and just used smaller onions and bell peppers.  Plus I have purchased a smaller crock pot which is a good idea for some recipes.   Nice change.
