Came out great!! I put bread stuffing inside instead and used butter instead of margarine. It was delicious. Husband loved it.

I made this for dinner tonight using chicken leg quarters, left out potatoes and carrots, but the chicken was so tender and juicy, fell right off the bone.

This was very good.  The chicken was succulent and flavorful.  I do agree with another reviewer that the amount of garlic should be cut.  Also, I think there was way too much margarine; it made everything overly greasy.  I suggest not using the margarine in the inside and, perhaps even cutting the other 1/4 cup to less and dotting the chicken skin with it so that it browns more (my chicken skin did not brown and crisp as much as I would have liked).  The "stuffing" was messy once the chicken was sliced so next time I'll use quartered onion and halved lemon.

I loved it. I followed the recipe using  a whole cut up chicken.  I put butter on top of the chicken pieces and under some of the skin, garlic salt, and pepper. I also threw a few sprigs of thyme on top.  I cooked it in the oven, covered for an hour. Then I broiled it for about 10 minutes to get it crispy on the outside. It was delicious. The veggies and meat were cooked to perfection. I will definitely make this again. So easy!!

It turned out great! Low on supplies so I improvised.". I added a few slices of chopped apple to vary the taste and used baby carrots, chopped small red potatoes and a half onion and no lemon. I used another AR recipe to coat the chicken with (lemon herb). Tasted awesome! Also seemed with sweet potato fries. Not bad for my maiden voyage into making a whole chicken :-)

This was my first roasted chicken whole. My house still smells amazing today. I did it as followed with the exception I used real butter. It was so tender and juicy. I also cooked up some fingerling potatoes. It was such awesome comfort food. Thank you for this great recipe.

This was the first time in my 40 years of cooking that a recipe has stated that the oven is to be set to `385 degrees`! lol   Usually it`s  either 375 or 400 degrees.  I think that in this case it should have been 400 or 425 because the chicken didn`t really get brown and crispy.   This was okay but not great.

Excellent recipe. I used a couple tablespoons of butter (we don't use margarine) under the breast skin. I used several garlic gloves and garlic powder too! We like garlic a LOT. I also added a bit of chicken stock to the baking dish to keep things from drying out too much.

This was amazing! My 5 1/2 lb chicken took about 1 hr and 27 minutes to cook. I used butter instead of margarine and basted it half way through. I also added 3 sprigs of Thyme to the top. I made sure it was in the middle of the oven (saved by my mother-in-law as she saw me put it too close to the top of oven). I ended up putting 2 minced garlic cloves inside because that's all I had, but it turned out amazing!!!! Thank you for a great recipe. My husband was impressed. We both wished we had more veggies though. I'll add more veggies of everything next time.

Nearly 2 hours for a 4.5 lb chicken? Depending on your oven that might be a bit long.  I'd check it at 1 hour,20 minutes. Other than that, this is a great recipe.

The chicken was very tender and juicy.  I felt like there was a bit too much garlic.  I recommend not putting it on the outside of the bird.  Otherwise a nice warm meal on a cold night.

I left out the celery and doubled the onions. I also added a dash of fennel seeds to the potatoes. As for temperature, I set my oven to 200 degrees Celsius and cut the cooking time down to 1 hour and 30 minutes. It came out so tender and juicy! Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe was easy, the chicken was moist and tender. I put apple and lemon slices in the chicken, added mushrooms.

However, with the chicken sitting on the veggies, as opposed to being surrounded with them, the bottom of the chicken was mushy, cooking time was longer than I anticipated.  

To keep the veggies from also being overcooked, I cut/sliced the chicken and microwaved it to finish cooking.

If I do make it again, I will put the chicken on the pan, itself, and add the minced garlic to the veggies before putting them around the chicken.

Delicious and the more veggies the better, also the lemon "sauce". In this case, more is better:) Baked it for 3 hours at 350, would go 375 next time.

Was absolutely delicious!   I had just purchased a chicken and fresh carrots, onions and Brussel Sprouts and used the sprouts in lieu of potatoes.   I cooked at 375 degrees for one hour and fifty-five minutes.  I put some extra butter on the chicken and basted with the juices.  Chicken came out skin crisp and tender meat; veggies were perfect = not too firm nor too soft.  Would highly recommend this recipe and I loved finding another recipe for my cast iron skillet!  P.S. I used a 3.75 lb chicken.

Used parsnips instead of carrots which was a mistake, but the chicken was DELICIOUS definitely going to make this again.  I also wasn’t sure if she was calling for half cup total butter.  I used a quarter cup total and it was more than enough.

I love one pot meals.  This had it all chicken and vegies.  My only issue was that I need a bigger cast iron skillet.  I used my 10" put it was stacked to the top.  Still amazing.  I used butter instead of margarine.

Fantastic.  I never knew I could use my cast iron frying pan to make such a delicious recipe.  I will make it again and again.  No alterations on the recipe.  This Lake Girl loved it.

I actually doubled it by cooking two whole chickens in my large roasting pan.  It turned out amazing!  I used real butter instead of margarine, also added some Cremini mushrooms to the veggies (which I loaded up the veggies in the pan, didn't really measure). Baking two birds took about 3 hours, I just made sure to monitor the temperature of the meat.  The leftovers were awesome as well!

Good recipe , times and temps are good to use. I like to add more root vegetables like red/golden potatoes, parsnip, turnips, yams, carrots and even Brussels sprouts. Word of advise: Jew checking your veggies so they don't over cook. If they are don't first you can always transfer your chicken to a roasting pan to finish

I left out the lemon because I didn’t have it on hand but I’m so impressed with this recipe!  Those veggies were incredible.  The only addition I made was some chicken bouillon, salt, and pepper when I tossed the veggies with olive oil.  I tucked the margarine under the chicken skin.  FABULOUS.

This is a great recipe for chicken. The vegetables cooking in the drippings are extra special. I added 2 small peeled sweet potatoes, life changing.

Only addition I did was to put packaged Poultry spices on top of the chicken. House smells amazing.

Excellent moist chicken. I used much less butter than called for, maybe 1/4 c including some put under the skin. Six pound chicken done in 1 hour and 50 minutes. Will make again.

Wonderful! I used small whole red potatoes instead of cut potatoes. I did not use a cast iron skillet, but just put all in my roaster and cooked uncovered. I added a few sprigs of rosemary, thyme and sage on top of the veggies. It was simple and delicious!

Very yummy and no need to keep checking on it or basting it.  I cooked it for exactly 1 hour 45 min never touching it and it came out perfect!!

Loved it! A little heavy on onions for me.  A 5 1/2 lb chicken fed 2 men and 2 women.

This is the best tasting recipe I’ve ever made. The chicken came out tender and juicy and the vegetables were tender but not over cooked. All of the vegetables still had a good bite to them and I didn’t change the recipe very much. After about 30 minutes the skin looked a little dry so I basted the chicken in its own juices however there wasn’t a lot of juices to baste with. I opened a can of chicken broth to baste it the second time and only used a little bit. After that there was enough juice and I basted it every fifteen minutes or so. It looked like it might get too brown so I loosely covered it in foil for the last fifteen minutes or so. Thank you for the recipe.

I have been making something VERY similar but with 2 breasts of chicken cut in halves. I use carrots, onion, Brussels sprouts and sometimes dredge in margarine then flour with tarragon, rosemary, lavender and chicken seasoning. I place this down into a Dutch oven (or pyrex dish), drizzle olive oil over it along with tarragon, lavender. I brown the chicken until brown. Then place the chicken pcs (boneless skinless breast halves) on top of the veggies, and cook until 150 degrees (they will continue to cook and dry isn't good) for 30 minutes at 375 in the oven. This drops the chicken calorie count to 350 cals.

I made according to instructions. At 90 minutes almost all parts of the chicken were at 200 degrees using a Thermopen instant read thermometer. Everything was dry, especially the breast. Check at 60 minutes, certainly not 105 minutes as the recipe suggests.
