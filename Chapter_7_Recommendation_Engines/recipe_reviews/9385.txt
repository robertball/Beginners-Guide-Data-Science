Not a whole lot of flavor in this one.  Would be better if served with a sauce.  Kids don't really like it.

A perfect recipe.  Quick, simple and turns out exactly as a custard should -- subtle, yet rich.

By the way, scrambled eggs as mentioned in another comment would be a result of not tempering the eggs. (combining them *very* slowly)  Follow the directions and this one turns out great.

I searched books and the internet but could not find a custard that would meet my families dietary needs.  (Sugar free, low fat and low cholesterol).  I decided to adjust this recipe and see what happened.  I used Splenda, 1% milk and Egg Creations liquid egg product and crossed my fingers.  The result was AMAZING!  It set wonderfully, was creamy and tasted sweet and rich with vanilla.  My suggestion is to never rush a custard and cover the cooling custard with a film of plastic wrap so that it lays directly on top of the custard.  This prevents a 'crusty film' from forming.  Thank you so much for your contribution!

I used this custard in a trifle dessert (layered cake dessert with cake, custard, and fresh fruit). I had to scoop out scrambled eggs from the custard mixture, but after doing that and adding some more corn starch, it turned out well. Maybe I did something wrong, so I'll try it again.

I'm not a big fan of custard but this one is very nice. It has great flavour, not too "eggy".  Smooth texture.

If you know what you're doing, you won't have any problem with the eggs. I have made this on several occasions with no problems. It's delicious!

This is just perfect!  I tried it in a double boiler and it just seemed to take forever.  Then, I tried it on medium heat, stirring almost continuously, and it worked fine.  Then, I added cooked rice at the end for a rice pudding/custard.  I shared this with two Mongolian friends who had never had pudding and they loved it...had seconds and thirds!

This was ok. I wasn't a huge fan. I had issues with the texture and the smoothness, maybe from the cornstarch. The flavor was good but I doubled the vanilla. I'm going to keep looking for a perfect recipe.

If I was looking to make a good flavor of pudding, this would be a 5 star! However, I was looking for a recipe that would give me the flavor of the boiled custard that you can buy in the grocery store at holiday season. This does not fit the qualification for that, but my wife loves it. She says this would be a great base for rice pudding.

I tried this recipe in a double boiler and it didn't turn out at all! I boiled the mixture for thirty minutes and it wouldn't thicken. I had to finish it in the microwave. However, I liked the flavor and texture, so I didn't give up. I boiled it on medium heat in a regular pot and it turned out perfect! I even made a bit of caramel with butter, brown sugar and baking soda to add some oomph. Perfect tv night dessert.

I love this recipe! It is easy to make and it's flavor blends well with the foods that you add it too. We love vanilla, so we added a little extra to enhance the flavor. I'd make it again.

Was simple and easy. I used a double broiler  and  i had to turn heat up to get it to speed up cooking process. I had to  babysit it to prevent lumps. It did have a cornstarch tasted i increased the vanilla. I also took 1 reviewers advice and combined dry ingredients and then added  milk and eggs that had been mixded togetther.

I followed the recipe exactly & it was delicious!  We were looking for a natural alternative to the "custard in a jug" located on the milk isle.  It was even better chilled with a little freshly grated nutmeg on top.

No problems, using raw milk and tempering my eggs. I also used 2 egg yolks instead of the second egg, since I had them left over from another recipe. Perfect for the trifle I'm compiling.

This really is fantastic!  It's got that scalded milk, caramelized sugar flavor.  It's so yummy.  It made a pretty thick film on top while cooling, so I had to run it through a sieve, but still, YUMMY!! Be sure to temper the eggs first and stir it constantly, or you'll probably get scrambled eggs.

I had trouble with this recipe, it didn't set and even though I tried tempering the eggs they still had the scrambled eggs problem. Overall it didn't have much flavor.
