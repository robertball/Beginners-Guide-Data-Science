I originally reviewed this wonderful recipe on Sept. 8, 2009 when it was on this site as a Kraft recipe.  It bears repeating.  "Delightful and delicious. And fun to make too! I made the job of filling the cupcake cups easier on myself by pouring the batter into a gallon ZipLoc bag and piping it in. Worked great! Also, I found I could use a little more than the 1/2 T. of filling, if that helps. I baked them for the minimum recommended baking time and they were perfectly moist. I did use the mini Oreos, after finally finding them in the fourth store I looked for them, Costco. All I could find until then were the Oreo Cakesters! I'm glad I found them, as they do look nice to top the cupcakes, but regular sized Oreos would do just fine in a pinch. I didn't use the Cool Whip, as these will be served where refrigeration is not possible. I LOVED what I ended up frosting them with - White Cake Frosting II, also from this site. Absolutely decadent, memorable, and certainly worthy of making again!"

Anything with Oreos is bound to be good and this was no exception! These were so easy to make and so adorable that I'll definitely make them again. I did find that I used a bit more of than 1/2 Tbsp. of cream cheese mixture per cupcake, but that's OK because the more the better. I didn't use Cool Whip for the frosting, but opted for "White Cake Frosting II" from this site that I've used on "Cookies 'n Cream Cake" before. It tastes just like the inside of an Oreo and it pipes beautifully. It worked great on these little beauties!

This recipe was so good!! I used Duncan Hines super moist devil food cake mix. It was so moist and fluffy. Sadly, my cream cheese mixture sunk to the bottom but it was still delicious.

I made my own chocolate cake vs using a box (because that's how I bake) and didn't quite make enough for all of the cream cheese mixture. It was really good, but a bit rich.

Loved it! But when filling up the first layer of brownie mix spoon in just a little to save room for filling and Oreo mine over flowed a little.

These were so yummy! My son wanted vanilla cake, so I just added cocoa to the cream cheese mixture, and made chocolate frosting. They were a hit with my family, and both of my neighbors as well. Definitely making these again!!

These were delicious! I read the reviews and learned about the lack of Oreo flavor coming through so I modified by adding crushed Oreo in the cream cheese filling and instead of having the mini Oreo in the filling part I used a full size Oreo at the base. A-MAZING!!!!! Huge hit at my husband work pot luck.

I made these for a bake sale and sold out quickly. A few people came back later to see if we still had any! I will definitely be making them again. Should have charged more for these!

This is such a yummy, easy recipe!!!  I think it's presented so cutely with the little Oreos on top.  The first time I made them I accidentally mixed the whole batter together. It actually turned out great and was very moist. The second time I followed the directions, and it was equally as amazing!  Huge hit at both parties!!

I made these for a baby shower and it was a bit of a flop. no one seemed overly impressed. the cupcakes were better after a day in the fridge. make sure that you put enough of the cream cheese mixture in. it seemed that people thought the cookie in the middle was a lump of something that shouldnt have been there. dont think i'll be make them again.

ok so im in the army and we just had a party for spring and Easter so I volunteered to bake anything that I wanted so I decided to bake something that all the kids loved so sure enough I made well over 100 of these amazing treats.  And let me tell you these thing went like a wildfire i got so much good reviews from the adults and the children.  great recipe and will probably be making this again with different variations too the cake mix and cheese cake mix.  the only thing is I used homemade cake mix and instead of the regular cheese cake type filling I added 2 tablespoons of instant mocha mix and 1 tablespoon of unsweetened coco powder.

I think I would have preferred a larger oreo inside and a heavier frosting.

These were amazing! I made them for a coworker's birthday. Everyone loved them! I frosted them with my favorite go-to recipe, Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting, with Oreo crumbs mixed in. I already had a few other people request these for their birthdays. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

These were boring and lacked depth.    The oreo taste was barely present.  The cream cheese taste was non existent.

I would have put a cookie on top of the topping.
