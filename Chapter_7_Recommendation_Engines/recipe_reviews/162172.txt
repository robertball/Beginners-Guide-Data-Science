Very good cucumber salad - just what I needed to as a side dish for grilled chicken.  I used white wine vinegar because it's a bit milder.  I also used two cucumbers that I thinly sliced and didn't peel.  Very simple and very good.

My great Grandmother made something similar.  It's just the vinigar, sugar, salt, cucumbers + tomato and white onion.  Let it set over night.  It's so refreshing I can't stop eating it.

this was very good, but i thought the dressing could use some oil so i added a tablespoon of oil, i also added 1/2 cup diced tomato, and a couple thin onion slices, the dressing is something i will use again, it would be great on other salads as well, i will definately make this again, thank you, gotta go make more!!!

I added chopped sweet onion and apple cider vinegar at a 1 to 3  ratio with the white vinegar.  It was a hit!

This recipe is great as it is. I agree that sliced onions and sliced tomatoes compliment the cucumbers in this dish. I prefer running a fork the length of the cucumber to cut the skin, then slicing into medallions.

This was ok, but the seasonings as is are not my cup of tea.  The parsley was overpowering and so was the dill.  I took the advice of another reviewer and used garlic salt (and omitted the salt) so as not to have that raw, bitter, garlic taste.  I added sliced radishes and thin pieces of red onion as well.  But all I could taste was parsley and dill....I would probably attempt again but just decrease the parsley by half and I think omitting the dill altogether.  Mind you, it is a great, low-carb recipe though and it's nice not to have a 'heavy-mayo' type salad.

For 2 cucumbers I substituted 1 tsp dried dill, 1 tsp garlic powder and dropped the parsley (since I didn't have any).  Didn't have time to chill it 4 hrs, but it was amazing and delicious after 30m.  There were no leftovers!

Easy Cucumber Salad Haiku: "Yup, this was easy. Nice that it wasn't 'creamy', like other salads." With a plethora of cucumber salads available on AR to sample, it was hard to settle on one, but with "easy" in the title, and a lack of a heavy addition of mayo, this one was a great recipe to land on. I went just a tad lighter on the sugar, but otherwise, followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding a couple slivers of red onion. Served alongside BBQ fare on a sunny weekend afternoon, and this was a crisp cool cukey side dish that we enjoyed.

Awesome!  You can sub dried herbs if you don't have fresh.  Use half the amount of the fresh herbs if you are using dried herbs.

Enjoyed!

After reading the reviews, I halved the vinegar, and also used less dill. I added feta cheese and a little red onion (If you're gonna add red onions, I suggest covering them in cold water and squeezing them; rinse and repeat a few times. It makes them more mild - otherwise they can be really overpowering.)

Seemed to have great potential, but the quantity of vinegar was a little too much and the salad became very liquidy.

Great recipe with a few minor adjustments... Left out the parsley and dill. Used garlic powder instead of minced and cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. Added in a tablespoon of veg oil and a bit of white pepper and onion powder. Delicious!

This is a yummy side dish, no complaints on the recipe. I doubled the recipe when I made it because 1 cucumber didn't seem enough.

Yes, easy it is. I much preferred 'chopping' cucumber than slicing it. Went faster. Made this as is and it's a keeper.

Clean, light, flavorful and healthy. I use honey in place of sugar, and instead of salt I use celery seed. I also just used jarred parsley and dill and it was still great. I did use fresh garlic cloves and that can pack some bite, so you may want to go for the jarred minced garlic for less "punch" if you are serving to those who might be averse to strong flavors like that. LOVED IT!

i thought this was awesome.... i used 2 large english cukes and kept the dressing the same. Prob why it wasn't so overpowering (plus i used dry seasoning only because thats what i had). Tastes like a mild dill pickle without the acid of the pickle. Loved it. I usually make the cucumber dill recipe on here but the amount of vinegar gets to our stomachs after a while. This was just enough for a taste! I break the salad up into mini mason jars so we have grab and go healthy choices during the week for the kids! Thank you

Tastes great pared down, too, if you don't have all of the spices. I used the recipe amounts for sugar, salt, white vinegar, and parsley. Tastes great, just like my mom's! No oil, healthy summer dish!!

I added some red onion to this salad, and I also used dry parsley and dill.  So I only used about 1/2 tsp each.  The dill in my opinion was very strong and overpowered the salad. I will make it again, but this time I will omit the dill altogether.

Tastes great on top of a dinner salad.  I totally forgot I didn't have an onion but it didn't matter.  The garlic and cucumber was great tossed in vinegar with parsley.  Threw this on top of a salad and put the grilled chicken burger and sirloin on top for a great all around salad.

I slice the cukes along with sweet onions. I also use red wine vinegar instead of the white and add a 1/2 tsp black pepper.  If you substitute dried dill for the fresh, use 1/2 Tbs.  Family favorite.

Great, we loved it!  Didn't make any changes other than substituting the fresh herbs with dried as that is what we hand on hand. Definitely plan to make it again!

I've made this 5 or 6 times, and each time I make it, it never stays in the fridge to chill for more than 10 minutes.  Someone always finds it, and then it's gone.  The only change I make is that I double the recipe.

Very good! Like very mild homemade pickles with just the right amount of sweetness and a very fresh taste.  I made 1.5 times the dressing and used 4 cucumbers.  Seems to get more watery overnight, and that didn't bother me at all.  A hit with my family - even those that don't like pickles.

Very nice.  If you want your cucumbers to stay white definitely stick with the white vinegar.  Didn't think of that when I used balsamic haha!  But still very tasty.

I used curly parsley when it really needed flat parsley but I loved it.  It was like eating a pickle without being sour.  I followed the recipe, I think next time I'll add a bit more dill and I might add some finely diced red pepper but it's not needed.  All in all, I loved it.  I ate almost all of it on my own in 2 days.  I also didn't use seedless cucumber since that's not what I grow in my garden and I wonder if that's what made it so liquidy the next day.  I'll make it again, probably soon.  Definitely worth 5 stars!

We eat this salad often, exactly as written. It is light and refreshing. We are living in Greece for a couple years where fresh dill and fresh parsley are used in many foods.  Two thumbs up from everyone in our family.

I used some some of the other's comments, I am just repeating the other person so I can find it when I make this again in a couple of days.  Loved it.  

"For 2 cucumbers I substituted 1 tsp dried dill, 1 tsp garlic powder and dropped the parsley (since I didn't have any). Didn't have time to chill it 4 hrs, but it was amazing and delicious after 30m. There were no leftovers!"

Great cool summer salad!! Absolutely loved it! Unfortunately, I couldn't find the dill I had bought for it, so I used cilantro instead. Oh ya... cilantro has that pretty fresh fragrance and taste. It was crisp and delightful. Strongly recommend it and use the herb of your choice!!

I initially made it exactly as listed - the only true way to review a new recipe.  The amount of garlic and herbs overpowers the cucumbers instead of enhancing their flavor like they should.  I cut back the dill to 3/4 tsp, the parsley to 1 tsp, the minced garlic to 1/4 tsp, and added 2 tbsp chopped white onion.  This allowed the cuke flavor to really blossom.  Chilling at least 2 hours so cukes are crisp - very refreshing - a perfect summer side dish.

I was out of regular salad and wanted a tasty way to use up the half cuke in the fridge. This did the trick nicely! I only had white wine vinegar and I think this would be tastier anyway. I also added a touch of olive oil since I like it that way.

This receipe is okay. I made it for Easter dinner this morning with a few adjustments. Used 1tbsp red wine vinegar and 2tbsp white. I thought it was too salty maybe it was because of the red wine vinegar? I also added a little more sugar as well as red onion and tomato. My grandma used to make something like this but it was a mayonnaise base.

This salad is delicious!  My fiance doesn't like mustard or anything creamy like sour cream or mayo, which limits the kinds of salads I can make for him.  It's great to have an easy salad recipe that we both enjoy!

This is wonderful!  I also added tomato & onion to mine & it tasted great.  Very quick to make & it's still good even if you don't let it sit in the fridge for as long as the recipe calls for.

I loved this recipe.  It was so elegant and yet, my "meat 'n' potatoes" Dad liked this, too.
