TEN STARS! I could have eaten half of this in one sitting. I accidentally forgot the milk so I didn't do the bread crumbs. It was gooey, cheesy, delicious cauliflower.  I used two bags of frozen cauliflower and microwaved them together for about 8 minutes to get it warmed. I didn't do the onions and I didn't miss them. I want to make this every week! Update:  I don’t know what I did wrong the second time but it’s not very good. I substituted cheddar for the Monterey Jack, that’s all I can think of.

Based on one of the previous reviews, I did not add milk (which adds carbs).   I used only aged cheddar and included some diced leftover ham. My husband thought it was great. I will definitely make this again.

Made as written and this turned out pretty good. I actually preferred the cauliflower over a noodle. It did get a little watery on me so next time I will make sure and squeeze the excess moisture out of the cauliflower.

Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is the milk. I WISH I would have forgotten like the other review. Soooo, watery. Cut back or just cut out. Or just make the cheese sauce separate and pour over cooked cauliflower.

Very disappointed with this recipe.  It turned out watery and the cheese congealed. I will definitely make a cheese sauce next time.
