I'm actually surprised I can type right now, after the alteration I  made to this recipe.  Instead of 3 cups water, I used 1 cup rum, 1 cup coconut water, and 1 cup water.  Yowza!  Lip-smackin, buzzed-before-you-know-it goodness.  Sa√∫de!

DON'T PEEL THE LIMES.  The peel contains all of the essential oils of the lime.  It gives it that extra kick.  Yes, it's a pain to strain it, but trust me, you'll be glad you did.  

I made this for a party and then added some vodka for some Brazilian Limeade Martini's.  HUGE hit!

would have given this 4 stars, but it is much too gritty and very hard to strain. this works much better if you blend only the sugar water and lime first then strain it (multiple times) with a very very fine strainer; this way you strain the lime peels, not the milk froth, and you don't loose the small chunks of ice. the proportions of this recipe were pretty much perfect though.

My husband and I just loved this lemonade. It is really a limeade and the taste is out of this world. It's really quick to make and would be great to make up for a barbecue or other summer party. Don't make more than you can drink in a few hours though. As the recipe indicates it doesn't keep well overnight. Definitely my favorite blender drink!

Very yummy! The milk makes it nice and frothy. It was a little too sweet for me though so next time I will try it with less sugar and/or a little more water. A very nice unique summer drink. One year later - STILL a definite favorite, just a note I thought I should add is to be cautious about making it too far in advance from when you intend to serve it, after a few hours it goes quite bitter so serve right away.

I took one sip of this & decided it was begging for some rum so I added a good sized shot of light rum to mine...YUMMY! It was a tad sweet so next time I'll decrease the sugar a little. I think this is my fave new drink!!!

IMPORTANT!  Because this has the whole lime in it, it becomes increasingly BITTER over time after it is mixed. At first it is divine.  Within minutes it is sooooo bitter!!  I was experimenting with two different recipes to see which one I wanted to use.  One had coconut milk, the other had sweetened condensed milk.  The first one was great.  The second was great.  When we went to sample the first one again to compare tastes, it was suddenly bitter.  So, we used the second recipe, thinking the first recipe wasn't as good.  I made a ton of it for our large family to be able to have several refills.  By the time we got everyone gathered and said the blessing- it was horribly bitter.  I thought the kids were being overly dramatic- saying it tasted bitter.  I poured a big glass, and when I tasted it, I was shocked!!! 
It is out of consideration for you that I want you to know this is soooo good- but make it, drink it immediately.  THEN make more! :)  You're welcome!

I placed 3 limes (peel and white pith removed), 1/3 cup sugar,3 tablespoons condensed milk and water in a blender. Strain.  Place ice in a glass and pour the lemonade over the ice. delicious.

You really need the whole lime and zest to bring out the flavor because of the addition of the condensed milk. I made it twice; the first time, I just used store-bought lime juice and it wasn't as flavorful. Also, I have found that lemon peel does not turn bitter the way lime peel does. If you want to change this to Brazilian Lemonade and use lemons, it won't turn bitter even if served hours later.

A favorite of ours! My method of making it is a bit different than written here.  I blend the limes, one cup of water and sugar until the limes are nice and shredded to bits (love my ninja!); strain; put strained mixture back in blender and add condensed milk and blend again; pour over tons of ice and Enjoy! So good and refreshing!

Fabulously refreshing and good.  Because I wanted to make a thick & icy drink, I used 3 cups of primarily ICE with water and cut the rind off the limes because I wouldn't be able to strain it with the icy consistency.  It was excellent this way.  I am going to make this again as an icy drink and also as written because I think using the rind would enhance the flavor.  As others have suggested it would be great with alcohol.  Another great recipe from this site, Honey Walnut Shrimp, uses part of a can of sweetened condensed milk, so there is always some left over to make Brazilian Lemonade.  So glad I found this recipe.

By far THE BEST lemonade I've ever had...and it doesn't even use lemons! It almost seems creamy when you're drinking it, but its not, It's so thirst quenching, and refreshing and sssooo perfect for hot summer days. But never try to make a bunch of it and keep it in a pitcher in the fridge, the long you let it sit the more bitter it gets. You have to drink it right away! I make this all the time! so good, thanks for the recipe!!!

This was very, very good!  The first batch I tossed due to my error - my blender is on its last leg so I blended for a couple minutes, figuring I'd need to in order to puree everything.  Big mistake!  The pith gets pulverized and gives the drink an unpleasant bitter aftertaste that no amount of sugar or sweetened condensed milk can cover up.   For the second batch I actually followed directions and got the delicious refreshing drink everyone raves about.  I just used my regular mesh strainer, pressing down on the pulp with a spoon to squeeze out the drink.  I also used fat free sweetened condensed milk, which minimized the guilt factor for me!  Thanks for sharing!

I made the mistake of following a reviewer's advice not to peel the limes, and followed the recipe exactly. At first it was way too sour, so I added another cup of water and a few tablespoons sugar. It was just alright. But if you don't drink ALL of it at once, it sits and becomes more bitter by the minute--no more than an hour after I'd made this, the entire batch was simply ruined by awful bitterness. Maybe it was just my particular limes, but I won't ever attempt to make this again.

This kicked butt! I added a little less sugar and increased the sweetened condensed milk to kinda make the sweetness a little more complex. The drink had some tones of coconut too it. Actually, some coconut milk could make a wonderful addition. I poured this into some tom collins glasses and placed sliced lime on the rim with an umbrella and a cocktail stirrer with a picture of a parrot on it. I also added just a little clear rum.

Update:

The first time I made this I thought it was a magical concoction...However, I made the exact same way the second time and it tasted like dandelion juice... It was so bitter it felt like all the moisture was dessicating from my oral tissues. Hmmm... now I am kind of afraid of it. I even tried adding a ton more sugar and watering it down but the bitterness of the lime pith remained.  Perhaps it was the fault of the limes... Or perhaps it is cursed. All I know is that the magical concoction I was once so fortunate to sample seems to be fading into a distant memory like a mystical dream that haunts your waking hours, obfuscating the threshold between sleep and awake...

5 star rating, with reserations

I love this lemonade.  I made this a few times already and it always turns out great.  The last time I put frozen strawberries with it and my whole family loved it.  I can't wait to drink this in the summer.

YUMYUMYUM!! I lived in Brazil for a year and a half and this is it!!! This is a memory for me and it is delicious and oh so good. Don't alter the recipe and definitely don't peel the lime. The straining doesn't take that long. Perfect! :)

Just like at Fogo de Chao!!!  I used Splenda for the sugar, too, so I don't feel as guilty drinking this!  I do recommend straining it BEFORE putting in the sweetened condensed milk.

Excellent beverage!  Prepared almost as directed...  instead of adding the sweetened condensed milk to the blender before blending & straining, I simply stirred it in afterward.  Exquisite.

I think this drink takes some practice to make it just how you like. But If you like tropical drinks you will like this lemonade. I added some coconut rum by the advice of another user and this really rounded out the flavor! I enjoy lime juice for a change instead of the typical lemon. The problem was I think I pulsed the limes too much finely and it was really hard to strain, plus that leaves a more bitter taste, which is okay cuz I don't mind bitter but it could be a problem for some. My husband also enjoyed this drink, I will make it again, but next time for a crowd.

This is soooo good. I didn't have any sweetened cond. milk so instead I used coconut milk about 3 tablespoons and added 2 tablespoons more sugar than called for. And I followed someones review to just blend the limes and water and sugar first then strain and add everything else and re-blend. yum!

After seeing some other reviewers suggest switching out the limes for lemons -- and highly preferring anything lemon to anything lime -- I tried that and found it waaaay too bitter. As I changed the recipe I'm not going to yet review it until I give the actual recipe a fair shake, but to even remotely get it to something drinkable I added an extra cup and a half of water, just threw the whole sweetened condensed milk in, and added an extra half a cup of sugar -- and then poured it over more ice to thin it out more. Again, my fault for using two big lemons. (oh, apparently I have to rate it -- putting a 3/5 until I manage to go to the store and get some actual limes)

There's a Brazillian restaurant in Atlanta called Fogo de Chao that my husband and I just love going to. They have a divine drink there that we always get...their Brazillian lemonade. We talk about that lemonade long after we've left the restaurant! IT'S SO GOOD! After dining at Fogo de Chao last weekend, I browsed the internet to see if I could find a copycat recipe and sure enough I did! This recipe tastes JUST LIKE the lemonade served at Fogo de Chao!! I made it a few days before Thanksgiving to see if the recipe would truly deliver the same taste and...oh yes it did!! Now we don't have to wait until dining at Fogo de Chao to have their yummy Brazillian lemonade. I served up a few pitchers of it on Thanksgiving Day and everyone LOVED it. Thank you SO MUCH for the recipe!! 5 stars all the way!!!

Wow, so good. Who would of ever thought? But I agree with over reviews, it can go bitter if it sits awhile. I like to make 1 or 2 glasses...not a whole pitcher. This is an awesome drink after being in the sun all day doing yard work or swimming. I ALWAYS have lemons but not limes so I will substitute and it is still good. Sometimes I add frozen fruit like strawberries, blueberries, rasberries or pineapple to make it extra refreshing.

Cool and refreshing.  Like other reviewers substitued 1 cup of citrus rum for one of the cups of water.  I can't stand straining things so I zested the limes and then juiced them really well, and I used 3 of them.  Instead of the sweetened condensed milk I had to use half and half since was out.  And since my blender is wimpy I served the drink "on the rocks".  Perfect after a hard afternoon of yardwork. . . or reading a book. . . or whatever

I made this for my fiance's going away party and scaled it to 24 servings.  Instead of adding all of the water, however, I substituted 1 bottle of lime vodka for that equal amount of water.  I did not add the ice to blend, and placed the limeade in a dispenser, put it in the freezer for about 3 hours, and just kept it on ice after that.  Many people enjoyed it and two of my fiance's male coworkers even asked for the recipe.  It was a great hit!

I found this recipe because my husband and  I loved a brazilian lemonade that we would always get at this Brazilian Restaurant that we love.  This recipe tasted exactly the same as the drink we love at that restaurant.  We  are having some friends over for Easter this year and we are planning on serving this along with dinner.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

fantastic! I whizzed the limes thru the juicer first, then poured everything into the blender, including the ice. Easy - no straining and got all that lovely lime juice. The taste of this is divine and the kitchen smells delicious.

I love limes and lime drinks.  I Made a HUGE quantity by tediously combining smaller batches.  It was for a housewarming party in the middle of another deadly hot, Texas summer.  I cut up the water, like Miss Powers suggested, with equal parts rum, water, coconut water.

As someone that attends a lot of small to medium parties, I can say that this drink may have gone faster than any drink anyone has ever brought/made to our little shindigs.  So perfect in the heat.

omg... like others have mentioned, it's missing the rum. I made half a batch to make sure I liked it first. So instead of 3 cups water it was a cup of water to 1/2 cup white rum. I had no ice :( . After I blended and strained it was missing yet another special additive, Coconut rum and oh me oh my it instantly became my summer favorite! I plan on buying a bag of limes tomorrow for the weekend! Just be warned you can add a lot of liquor without noticing it, imo at least. Which could be a good or bad thing depending on your objective for the evening.

Not kidding when it says, "best served immediately."  We drank half right away and it was cool and refreshing.  I saved the other half for later and WOW, did it turn bitter!  I had to add a bunch of sugar.

I thought this was really good. I followed my husbands advice and zested the lime into the blender instead of blending the whole lime. Other than a few big chunks of lime peel, we both really enjoyed this drink. I think next time I'll blend everything except for the ice, than strain the drink before adding the ice and blending together again. I also added more lime than called for because I wanted it a little more zesty! This was yummy, try it!

I like this. It's not my favourite but I like it. DO NOT USE THE WHOLE LIME. It WILL be way too bitter/sour. Zest it a bit if you like but peel the rest. After peeling I added the limes, the sugar a 1 cup of water, blended it, then strained it, put it back in the blender the finish it with the rest of the water and the condensed milk.

Very good and simple to make!  It's light and refreshing--just be sure not to pulse too much or it will be a little bitter.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I sliced the limes into wedges and squeezed them into a pitcher. I added the sweetened condensed milk, and then the sugar. I mixed them a little, then added the water. I stirred everything together, leaving the pulp from the squeezed limes. We thought it was a little on the sweet side, but other than that, it was really good!

For the first batch I followed instructions except I put 1/3 c sugar instead of a 1/2 c.  It was good but tangy.  For the second batch I used a 1/2 c sugar and the flavors were perfectly balanced.  What a fun drink!

This is the best Lemonade I have ever tasted. Tonight is the first time we've tried it, and we've already made 2 batches. 

We made the first batch exactly like the recipe. The second batch we added 1 cup of Absolute Vodka (yes we like Vodka) and 2 cups of water rather than 3. It came out absolutely perfect!!! 

We will be making this all the time now, and introducing it to all our friends. 

My wife is Brasilian, and she said it reminds her of home!!!

One of the easiest drinks I've ever made.  I really liked this, but it did have a bit of a bitter aftertaste.  Maybe I'll peel the limes next time...

Not being very fond of sweet drinks, I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and added an extra lime because they were small. Refreshing and delicious; even better after the rum was added!

I tracked down this recipe after having a creamy limeade at a local Brazilian restaurant. I'd have to say that this recipe is just as delicious. I will make this all summer long. Thanks!

This was very good.  After reading the reviews, I ended up blending the limes with 2 cups of water first.  Then I strained that put it back into the (rinsed) blender with the rest of the ingredients.  Delicious!  I could see how mixing this with some vodka or something would be great.

Unique and delicious!  I did what some others suggested because I have an old blender. Blended the limes, water and sugar first, strained, poured it back into the blender, then added the ice and milk. So yummy! Added some vodka afterwards to make a cocktail. Quite tasty! The skins of the lime really add flavor.

I can't imagine this recipe without the rum and coconut water.  ;)  I thought that rum would be a good addition to this drink, then I saw that Ms Powers had the same idea - but she also used coconut water!  I increased the lime to 3 instead of 2.  Grumpy and I both loved the drink.  I'm sure the original is good but I think it is an excellent base for an adult beverage.  I will definitely be keeping this drink in my files for future reference!

These were fantastic!  Not too sweet!  We used splenda instead of sugar, but other than that, to a T!  We made an adult version and used 1 cup rum & 2 cups water for the liquid.  Yum!

This is a great recipe! I did some tweaking to my own tastes but it's very simple and easy to follow. I used about 6-7 tablespoons of lime juice concentrate instead of fresh lime and blended it with ice instead of water.I found it was a little too sweet for me and ended up adding about half a cup of water and a few more tablespoons of lime juice to get it to a sweetness I liked. I also added a  splash of rum to my glass and it was perfect!

What a wonderful twist on lemonade! I substituted 4 Key limes for the 2 regular limes. My husband and I loved it. I'm planning to try it again with coconut cream substituted for the sweetened condensed milk.

Lovely!  Refreshing and tart and frothy and creamy and...mmmm!  I've been using small limes, kind of like key limes, as I live in SE Asia and it's such a great treat in the heat.  I can see this being one of my signature drinks for special occasions!

OMG, this is awesome!!!  I didn't have any ice, so I just used water, but still fantastic.  My friend and I whipped it up for fun and couldn't believe how amazing it was.  I'm going to try this trick with using the whole fruit for regular lemonade and with the condensed milk too.

My family and I love this recipe.  We actually like the bits and pieces, so I don't strain it.  If you don't strain it be sure to drink it immediately because it will turn bitter.  Another word of warning, we loved this recipe so much that I sheared the bolt holding the blender's blade completely in two.  It was a Kitchen Aide.

Quick and easy to make!! My family doubted me at first, primarily because of the lime peelings that I left in there; however after it was said and done....they begged for more!!

Gosh, I was really looking forward to trying this beverage.  But....It was really tart!  I used the VitiMix which pretty much mulches everything.  No straining needed but also means that I had super intense flavors.  I actually had to add additional sugar and I like tart!?  I will definately make this again and play around with the lime peel to juice ratio.  Good refreshing recipe, just be careful if you use a vitamix.

In the U.S., this is called limeade and Americans will probably find this delicious but too sweet, as I did. That said, my Venezuelan husband is wild about it! The first time I made it, I substituted 1/4 cup of Purevia stevia sweetener for the 1/2 cup of sugar - all other ingredients remained the same. The second time I made it with no added sweetener like sugar or Purevia - the sweetened condensed milk supplied all the sweeteness required. My husband didn't even notice. I have also made it with yellow lemons and found it just as delicious. This is a great refreshing beverage for summer. Your guest will love it.

OMGosh!!! This is so good!  I left a little of the pulp in for flavor.  Use organic limes to avoid the possible residue of pesticides.  A must try for anyone who likes citrus!!

This is a great summer cocktail.  I took Miss Powers advice and used 1 c. rum, 1 c. coconut water and 1 c. water instead of 3 c. water.  The only thing I'd change is next time I might use a little less sugar.  This recipe is a keeper!!!  Thanks!!!

I made this exactly as the recipe directed, and I had to throw most of it out. I think if I just slice the limes and squeeze the juice into the blend instead of blending in the peels as well, this would be a big improvement. The end result was very difficult to strain, and it was way too bitter. I added extra sugar, but even then it was too sour for anyone in my family to enjoy. Sorry!

This is too easy and too good.  It is an instant crow pleaser.  It is an expensive exotic looking drinks for pennies.  It went so quickly that I quickly had to make a second batch, on requests.  No one had ever had it before and everyone loved it.  Thanks for sharing.

If I could give this more than five stars, I totally would. I needed to use up a can of condensed milk and this was the perfect way. I scaled this recipe down to two servings, just for my husband and I. He didn't care for it which meant I got both drinks. Score. It's like drinking a key lime pie, but better. So darn good it'll make you smack your momma!

A wonderful change to your traditional limeade.  I will be making this instead! It's quick, easy and refreshing.  While it is best to serve soon after making, with the remainder I threw in a pitcher and stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days and while not equally as delicious it was still quite good.

Fantastic! Great alternative for parties. I made it for a bridal shower and it was a refreshing "change" from the usual gingerale-sherbert punch that is normally served at bridal showers. People loved it!

My guests and I enjoyed this sweet, fresh, and delightfully cool drink last weekend.  It was easy to make.  The only thing I had a little trouble with was straining it into the glasses. Next time, I will buy a larger mesh strainer and pour it into a pitcher first.  Less mess to be sure.  =) 

Has anyone added alcohol to this?  How did that turn out?

This was perfect! So good! We have a fav Brazilian restaurant here, where I always order Lemonade. This is the exact same. Thank you thank you thank you! I can't believe how very easy it is! Followed the recipe exactly, only I cut of much of the rind, the bits that I left on strained out though, so it must not matter. Either way, it was wonderful! Thanks!

I tried it as is and it was good.  I made it again this time using only 2 cups of water and 1/2 cup condensed milk and it was delicious, creamy, and smooth like a key lime pie.  I sweetened it with splenda instead of sugar, to cut calories.

What a great tasting drink! It sort of tastes like a liquid version of key lime pie. Substitute milk (I use non-fat) for condensed milk if you're watching the calories! I can't taste the difference.

I peeled the limes to avoid straining the lemonade, however it still needed to be strained due to the limes' membranes remaining which detracted from the drink.  It was a bit weak - perhaps add another lime? I added about 2 cups crushed ice and the lemonade overflowed the blender container when I turned it on. Tasted o.k. but probably won't make again.

This was really good! Everyone liked it however even after doubling the recipe it wasn't enough! I think next time I will try peeling the limes first. Great!

This is very good and so refreshing. As others suggested I did put in less sugar and it was perfect. The creamy consistancy is a nice twist on the usual limeade. Definitely one I will make again. Thanks for sharing!

You don't need to strain this if you just pour it out of the strainer spout in your mixer. But word of advice- don't store the limes in the pitcher as the rinds will overpower the juice. It either needs to be served immediately or definitely strained if you plan on keeping any in the fridge.

Here's a tip from a Brazilian that makes these a lot:
Cut the limes vertically and remove the big white core that runs in the middle, then cut the parts into wedges. Removing the core avoids the bitter taste some people feel.

This is a wonderful drink, and it's just begging to be a cocktail.  I made a half batch to start since I didn't have fresh limes...I figured the quality wouldn't be perfect but I could decide if I liked the flavor.  I downed the glass and started another half batch.  This time I looked for something to add...and found the bottle of cachaca in our cabinet.  Just a little bit replacing some of the water.  SO GOOD.  Will try with tequila (my fav) and fresh fruit next time!

I mixed 2 lemons n I lime as I didn't have limes. I didn't add the peel as I didn't want the bitter flavour. I squeezed the juice of the lemons and the lime and then followed the recipe as it is..The whole family thought it was divine. Next time I shall use two limes but I won't use the peel.

Following the recipe as is, I thought it was "ok". I think perhaps most people are more used to the bitter aftertaste this drink leaves. But other than that, it's pretty healthy for you and tastes decent. I would probably add more sugar next time.

This is refreshing and delicious.  Only things I did different were to strain before adding milk, then strain again back into blender with milk for another whirl, also used less sugar.

Excellent recipe.  I made the original and I have also used a combination of limes and lemons.  I found that a simple syrup made with half the water and the sugar was the easiest way to incorporate the sugar.  Also, I followed the recommendation of some reviewers and strained the juice before adding the other ingredients. However, even if you didn't make those adjustments, it would still come out great.

Wonderful flavor! This drink does not stay long at all. I made this for a dinner i prepared and by the end of dinner it was already a flop. I didnt even bother to put the drink through a strainer though, and it turned out fine. However if you want a slushy put a lot of ice. i only made 4 servings but i thought it made a lot more. i guess it depends on how much everyone drinks. Overall, it was great.

Oh my gosh. Just served this at a party and it was a hit. For my personal taste, I used 1.5 cups water and 1.5 cups Malibu rum. Also, I seved over ice instead of blending with ice. Everyone wanted the recipe. My husband said it was "money." Oh yeah.

YUM! I didn't add the ice to the blender, just everything else and blended the heck out of it and then strained. THEN I poured over ice. So good. I am pregnant right now, or I would totally be substituting rum for some of the water!

Stupid good! I made it as per recipe, next time I'm going to try a mix of 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda, just to cut the sugar a bit. Otherwise this is like I said "stupid good". A rum addition doesn't sound out of the question either!

So yummy, I felt like I was on vacation in the Caribbean!  I've since tried many variations of this with lemon juice and adding other fruits.  All very good.  I didn't think straining the limes was difficult.  I used a spagghetti strainer and it worked great.

Two things: 5 pulses in the blender. Not 4, not 6, 5!!
Next, DRINK IMMEDIATELY! 10 minutes later is too late, it starts to get bitter. Tastes like heaven when served immediately.

Fabulous! I followed directions to a T but tasted after the 5 pulses and blended mine up quite a bit more. I had no problems straining. Here's a tip: dump it into a pitcher with a straining lid and then you don't have to strain. Just pour. ;)

We would really give this more than 5; it was wonderfully refreshing and tasty.  Only a change of ambiance, i.e., a warm afternoon sitting by the pool (or a cruise!), could have made this taste any better.  Thanks for the post.  As far as one reviewers comment about grittiness, as long as you strain through cheesecloth, you won't have any problems.

yes, this is more sour than people expect but that's what is so good about it. I'm sure it would be fantastic as an adult beverage and I'm excited to try that soon but the kids love it as is and you have to strain it or it's too hard to drink.  The description of a liquid key lime pie is the most like what this drink is. Just saw a version of this somewhere else and a good tip for next time would be to blend the limes with simple syrup - strain and then add the milk.

Thi recipe was soo great... I made it at work and everyone tried and loved it... I didn't have a tablespoon here just a teaspoon so I used 9 teaspoons of the sweet condensed milk....3 teapoons in 1 tablespoon...  It turned out great I will definately make this again... We also kept the peel on and didn't have a strainer so small holes in a styrofoam cup and it was soo easy to strain...

Yummy!  Tastes very much like the Limeade from Fogo de Chao!  You can store the leftover sweetened condensed milk in the fridge to use many more times.

I love this recipe!  I love fresh juices, I don't even buy processed juice anymore.  My kids (both picky!) gulp this down as fast as I can pour it.  It is very refreshing on a summer day.  We actually like it to wash down shortbread cookies fresh from the oven :oD

Great recipe! Didn't have limes on hand so I used key lime juice and adjusted the milk to suit our tastes. My hubby thinks I should rename to "liquid key lime pie". very good! Thanks for sharing.

I was searching for this reciped for years and was very suprised to learn that there was no coconut milk in it. I've made it countless times and everytime people drink it all up! I plan on adding coconut rum to it at our next barbeque.

I love this.  I first made this about 3 years ago.  I use a juicer for the limes which makes it easier.  Add light rum or citrus/orange flavored vodka!  And c'mon, how can you mess this up?  There's 3 ingredients... make it how you like it! :)

This was way tasty. I skipped the ice (our blender can't seem to make the ice bits smaller than chunks, bleh), but kept everything else the same. I didn't end up blending it, I just mixed it till the granulated sugar dissolved. Very yummy, tasted a lot like the lemonade at Tucanos (Brazilian Grill).

Very refreshing! The condensed milk gives a creamy texture.  I will have to say that I grew up in Brazil and have never tasted this type of lemonade down there, I guess is because it's a big country and it may be popular in some areas only. I still have some left and I will try adding some brazilian cachaca that I bought once at the airport and never had a chance to use it. Thanks for the recipe!

Sometimes I blend the limes in a bit longer and only pull out the big chunks and the peel instead of straining it. I cannot stress how good this "lemonade" is.

This recipe is delicious!  The only thing that I have to say is that you shouldn't strain the limes too much and don't worry about using too much ice.  I made this twice, the first time I used a lot of ice and it tasted almost like a sherbet drink.  The second time I didn't use too much ice and I pushed most of the juice through the strainer and it had too much of a lime flavor (I don't recommend it).  From what I could tell the only differences were the ice and the fact that I tried to get as much juice as I could...

It wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be.  No one really cared for it even after I had an actual Brazilian native help me out with it. Also, it does go bad very quickly.  I will try to make it one more time though -- maybe I'll like it better the 2nd time around.

YUM!  This drink is so good.  I made a different limeade yesterday and this put that to shame.  I think I could drink this by the gallon.  The tart and sweet combination was fabuloso.  Thank you!  

Note:  I've made this 4 or 5 times now.  I don't see how anyone would have trouble straining this if you use a small strainer.  I also add the ice after I strain it because I prefer the drink with small ice bits and I don't want that to get caught in the strainer.

Refreshing! Followed exactly. I was a little unsure at first about leaving the rinds on, but the taste was great, and I only pulsed five times. Which leaves the rinds intact and they strain easily.

My kids didn't like this nearly as much as my husband and I did. I bet this mixture would make good popsicles that would give them that tart/sweet flavor in a method in which they're expecting that combination.

Amazing! I had to make something from a country that we are studying and I picked Brazil. At first I made it with servings for 10 so that I could try it. And now I have to make it for 30! The only thing to watch out for is the tanginess. The lime like smacks you in the face the first time you taste it. Will make again!

I made this for a small gathering, and it was a hit. Not only is it easy to make, the ingredients are inexpensive and go a long way. I would make this again. It might also be good with a little rum mixed in. :)

I modified his recipe to make a refreshing yet decadent looking Holiday Martini. I took out one cup of water & instead added 1 cup of good quality vodka. After straining I then poured it over ice in a martini shaker. Shook, poured into an iced martini glass. Garnished with a sprig of mint & sprinkled a little red & green sugar. Awesome. It looked rich & decadent but tasted light and refreshing! Watch out though! They taste good & go down easy. LOL.

Love it love it love it.  I serve it as a non-alcoholic option when I host parties at my house.  Or, add a little tequila to it, and have a yummy alcoholic drink.  I always make loads of this, and the punch bowl is always empty by the evening's end.

I think this has become an instant classic in our home!  It is quite tart but addicting.  My kids puckered up when they first tryed, but then went back for more. I made it for a gathering and it was a hit. Easy to make and inexpensive.

I loved this drink!  It works best with mexican limes which have more juice and less rind.  It's really refreshing and when I made it for a party, my 1st pitcehr was gone in 5 minutes.  This is my new favorite drink recipe!

I'm a really big fan of lime flavored things.  Most especially margaritas.  I was really excited to try this recipe, but I'm not quite sure if I liked it.
It was a little too sweet and the sweetened condensed milk made it even sweeter and gave it a taste that was new to me, therefore the jury is still out on this one.

Absolutely Fabulous!!! The first few sips are very tart, but then it just tastes delicious!  I made this for a Father's Day cookout and it was a hit!!  I sent the recipe home with the guests and can't wait to make it again.  I made it exactly as stated except I took another reviewer's suggestion and substituted a cup of vodka for one cup of the water.  Truly a wonderful summertime drink!!!!

Very easy to make and tasty!  Next time I'm going to leave out some of the water and blend up the ice after it's strained to make a smoothy.

Made this last summer and LOVED it, got rave reviews at our summer parties...forgot about it until I was looking for a refreshing summer drink for our Memorial Day BBQ this year.  Tried using a Splenda instead of sugar, worked great as a substitute. Will definitely be making this again!

Very good, but not too healthy... it's mostly sugar. On occasion this is a wonderful treat.

I like this recipe, I did tweak the amount of sugar in it by cutting it in half. I loved it!  I feel like I am back in Latin America when I drink it.  Thanks for sharing it!

This is absolutely delicious! I prepared it just as the recipe called for and it was perfect. I think if you peel the lime first you won't get the zesty flavor and that may be why some people complained of it being too sweet.I will definitely make this again!

yummy. I cut down a smidge on the sugar, but otherwise followed the recipe - I think keeping the peels on adds a little extra zip that the sugar balances nicely. Will be a standard for us!! Funny story, though - one time last summer, without thinking, I strained the peels out as I would have strained pasta - with the lemonade going down the sink!! Aghgh!!!

This was really good. Everyone at the party liked it; however, I reccomend that you double it. It doesn't make very much.

I also peeled the limes and skipped that whole straining part.

Definitely tasted close to the Brazilian Churrasco restaurants version but was a bit limy. Made a 2nd batch and instead of 2 limes, I used 1 ¬Ω limes, that batch turned out perfect.

Made this as written except exchanged the 1/2 cup of sugar for a 1/2 cup of Splenda to make this fit into my low calorie diet. It was delicious and not too sweet but I wonder if that was due to the sugar substitute. Sooo easy. I don't understand why anyone would complain about how much work this recipe is. As long as you have a fine mesh strainer just blend everything together quickly and pour through the strainer into a pitcher. Easy peasy and delicious.

I had some sweetened condensed milk left from a recent key lime pie.  Stumbling across this recipe was just the thing.  All that was necessary was picking up 2 limes.  

Being the first time to make this. I played it straight down the middle.  My individual mixer that I use for my smoothies (Bullet type) avoided getting out the blender for just the two of us.  As a result it required two batches, which was no big deal.  

These were awesome.  I didn't have any rum on the shelf (not big drinkers) but I would try with that sometime.  If made for just two of us again, I would halve the recipe.  One glass was plenty.  The second glass tasted okay, but a little taste goes a long way.  

If making for a larger crowd, I would pre-cut the limes and put in a baggie.  You could then whip up a crowd size batch and serve everybody at the same time.  

I will make this again this summer and would not make any changes to the ingredients.  Maybe add a garnish if I want to dress up the presentation.

It was yummy. After reading reviews about the bitterness, I peeled only the green skin, then cut the "meat of the lime from the white pith. I also added 1 additional tablespoon of the condensed milk.

This was Amazing! Rather than straining the ingredients I just juiced and zested a lime. I definitely plan to make this a regular spring and summer drink...or cocktail when adding lime rum or tequila.

Easiest summer drink for everyone! For the adults just add a splash of Rum! I followed the recipe exactly, it came out smooth, not gritty like some reviewers stated. Yet I do have a professional grade Vitamix, don't forget to strain it! Viola! Sitting in the shade drinking a glass of limonade!!

Simple and yummy! Made it with kids, so I sweetened it a little more with 5 tablespoons of sweetened condensed milk instead of 3. For those who complained about texture, I would suggest a more thorough reading of directions, which suggest you PULSE in the blender and use a FINE MESH SIEVE.

I found this a bit too bitter for my tastes. I made this in my Vitamix, and I'm wondering if it pulverized the pith too much. Maybe zesting the limes and then removing the pith would work out better next time. I ended up adding some Malibu¬Æ Rum, which helped the bitter taste a bit.

Very yummy!  Family loved it.  Refreshing and tasty.  Straining it is a pain but worth it.  I think the lime peel gives it a good flavor.

Excellent with 2 Cups Coconut Water and 1 Cup White Rum substituted for the water!  For straining, I used a clean French Coffee Press that worked great really well.

Great recipe, but tweaked it a bit.  First of all, I added the lime and sugar to the blender alone.  I then strained the mixture.  Next, I poured the mixture back into the blender, added the milk, ice, and then I added some Vodka which is purely optional.  It was very refreshing, frothy, and creamy.

This was fantastic! I didn't have a proper blender on hand so I had to use a hand/stick blender and it worked fine. We didn't have the ice to add either but found it to taste great regardless. Very quick and easy. Not too sweet or sour.

It was a great recipe! Resist the urge to change anything until you've made it once. I added an extra lime and the flavor was intense. I also used small limes.

Enjoy!

I made this and it's a definite keeper.  I did make a little extra and added in some more ice and condensed milk and the tartness went down a notch.

Certainly a drink to make again and again.

Absolutely yummy! I made it for my family who doesn't drink, but next time, it's going to have rum, or maybe tequila in it. The sweetened condensed milk gives it a really great flavor and creamy texture.

This drink was disappointing after such terrific reviews.  I did strain the lime mixture before adding the milk, as someone had suggested, which I think was a good change.  Unfortunately, I think the sweetened condensed milk made it taste artificial - more like I was drinking a Slushie or melted lime ice cream instead of "pure" limeade.  It tasted good, but it wasn't what I was hoping it would be.

I was a little skeptic, but this was great.  I did use three limes because mine were small.  I can't wait to make a few pitchers of this for our end-of-the-summer block party.

Great taste.  Loved the zesty lime flavor from blending the peels. I made several batches.  My favorite alterations so far include substituting agave nectar for sugar, using 5 Tbs. sweetened condensed milk instead of 3 and reducing the water to 1 cup.  Gives it a more intense key lime pie flavor.

I've never had this in Brazilian Restaurants (never been to one even), like some other reviewers have, so this was new to me. It's very simple to make, and amazingly good. I made several batches and drank them all. One thing: "5 pulses" of my blender didn't really chew up the limes very much, and I didn't know if I should have done it some more. Still, it was great as is.
This was also a good reason for me to finally buy some "fine mesh strainers" for use in this and some other recipes I've seen.

Delicious and refreshing.  I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup, and it was still very sweet. I used a cheese cloth to strain, and had no problem at all. Thanks, Jumala!

Excellent! Everyone that drank it really enjoyed it and very easy to make. I had a little left and several hours later tried it and it was so bitter. So you can't make it ahead of time but you can get the limes sliced.

Made this today for an afternoon treat.  Delicious, I was nervous about the lime peel at first.  I pulsed more than five times to grind up the ice, but was able to strain the peels just fine.  The bottom of the glass seems to have a stronger lime flavor.

Really interesting and unique flavor.  We never had anything quite like it, but enjoyed it very much!

Well, I followed the recipe exactly and when I took the first sip, I didn't love it, but boy, the rest of the family sure did.  I was literally begged all night to make more.

A little unusual taste but it's nice to have something a little different from lemonade once in a while. The recipe had a little dry after taste, otherwise, it was awesome!

Fabulous!!! I doubled the recipe for a small party, and should have quadrupled it- everyone LOVED it! We added rum for an extra kick, but it is just as great without it.  Very quick and easy, with great results.  Served in fun martini glasses with lime slices.

Tasty stuff. For those looking to booze it up, I found the rum to add too strong a flavor, so I preferred to pair it with gin.

Very tasty and refreshing. I made this for a brazilian dinner party.
If you are serving this at a party, serve it with a stirrer because it tends to seperate after awhile.

I poured a shot (or two) of vodka in each glass then added the blended lemonade and stirred. It was fantastic!

Surprisingly it didnt go over so well at my house. I liked it alright. Probably a good base for rum drinks and the like. My wife liked it fine but said it would give her stomach fits with the acid in it. Kids didnt like it much at all.

Very Yummy.  We're in Peru, and the limes here are only about 2 inches long/1 inch in diameter so we put in 7 of them and it was excellent! Be sure to drain it right away - leaving the extra sitting in the blender made it bitter after about 45 minutes.

This was nice.  I found it a little bitter, but not prohibitively so.  This could have been because 1.  I blended too long, 2.  I only used 2/3 the recommended amount of sugar or 3.  I made my own sweetened condensed milk rather than buying canned.  It's sort of like a mojito, but white and not minty.  Haha.  :).

This is so good.  Tastes just like the limonade at a Brazilian restaurant we love.  We sometimes vary the recipe by using carbonated water for a fun bubbley kick.  Mmmmm

I'm not really sure if I like this or not. At first I did not care for it then I thought it's not bad. I don't think I would make it again but I can see where others would like it.

I probably shouldn't have made this given that I hate sour‚Ä¶well anything, but I was intrigued.  I don‚Äôt know if I did something wrong (I did use a hand blender) but I didn't care for this.  Much too twangy!

Excellent--the hit of the party!  Made it w/o the vodka and added to those who requested it.  Would definitely use again.  Does work to make it a fews hours ahead.  I made mine up in the afternoon and served it at 5 & it was just fine.

My daughter loves this and asks me to make it all the time.  Great family drink, very festive, very tasty.
