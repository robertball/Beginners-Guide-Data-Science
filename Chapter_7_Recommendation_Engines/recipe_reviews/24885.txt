Finally, a true French dressing. I use a quality red wine vinegar at times for a different flavor and olive oil(extra virgin)instead of vegetable oil. I wish I knew why Americans seem to insist to add sugar or ketchup to everything,even salad dressings. A nice addition would be some chopped chives and green onions. And in case anyone was wondering why dry mustard instead of prepared mustard: in addition to adding flavor it helps keep the oil and vinegar from separating.

I really enjoyed this dressing on my spinach salad at lunch today.  I'm a big fan of vinegar & oil type dressings, (especially if they don't have alot of sugar) and this was great.  I didn't have any tarragon, so I'm not sure if the effect was any different, but I did add a little cayenne for a kick, YUM!  Thanks Stephanie, I will make this again!

This is a very interesting and excellent dressing. The tarragon is what sets it off. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it. A definite keeper!

Yuck. The ingredients did not blend very well. It tasted like salty oil.

This dressing does not taste like French.  It's more like a spicy oil and vinegar or Italian.  Tastes fine but is not what you expect from the title.

So very good! It is not made with ketchup and it still is good.

I used this recipe as part of the ingredients in Cranberry Sauce Chicken 1 (on this site)and it was wonderful.  Tarragon is the herb that really gives it a special flavor.  I didn't have any white wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar.

I just tried this on a spinach salad and it was great! I don't like dressings with sugar, or at least very little sugar, so my husband I both say this is a keeper. Now we won't have to eat all those preservatives in bottled dressings. Thank you Stephanie!

I love this dressing!  When my husband and I were in Paris many of my salads came with a dressing similar to this one.  I am especially fond of this over butter lettuce.

This was just awful, tasted nothing like french dressing.  We tasted it after the refrigeration and threw the rest out.  I'll keep looking for another recipe.

Better than any bottled I have ever had, also better than any homemade I have ever had. I will make this again.

This was delish!  I made it with just a quarter of the onion on mistake, but that was just enough to make a great kickin' french dressing!  Thanks!

I made the dressing as instructed, only substituting olive oil for vegetable oil and steak sauce for the Worcestershire sauce as I am allergic to anchovies. The dressing was perfect and very elevated. This will be in the regular rotation!

Way too salty. I had to double the rest of the ingredients to cut the salt. Next time Iâ€™ll use 1/4t.  Good otherwise.

I was looking for a different dressing than the same old wine vinegar and olive oil.  This was perfect.  Hubby hates sweet dressings and all the French recipes were made with ketchup and sugar.  He really liked this one.  I didn't have dried tarragon so I subbed herbs de provence (which contains both) for the tarragon and thyme.  I will definitely make this again.

Great! I used extra virgin olive oil and added a bit extra worcestershire and a pinch of cayenne     pepper! A true french dressing indeed!!

While I didn't feel like this was a real french dressing: tasted more like Italian to me, it was still pretty good! I'll use it again!
