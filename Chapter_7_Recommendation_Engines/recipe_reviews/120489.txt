I made this for a potluck where there were tons of fruit salads.  I used colored mashmallows, and honestly laughed at it.  It wasn't the prettiest thing I had ever seen.  I was actually embarrassed to take it.  But, guess whose salad was all gone?  I thought maybe it was kids eating it, nope adults to.  I will probably make it again or use the idea of making a shape.  Maybe a snowman in the winter?
