Surprisingly delicious. This fruit salad has a very sweet and tangy taste, and everyone who has tried it has loved it. (In fact, I've been asked to make more!) I usually make a regular fruit salad and it's in the 'fridge for days. Last night I made this one and it was gone within hours. A great fruit salad. Only thing I didn't like was the strong smell of vinegar when heating it up in the saucepan -- it stinks. But I figure I can make a LOT of the chilled mixture and use it for later, which I do like.

Edited: After making it several times I just thought I'd add more to this review. I'm not much of a cook so I don't see why the vinegar is necessary, probably flavor(?), but to compensate for the terrible smell of it I use half the vinegar. Still tastes great. In fact, I add more pineapple as well. I also wanted to mention that the salad tastes MUCH better if left in the 'fridge for a day or two, when the mixture, pineapple juice, and whipped topping blends together into the apples. This way the peanuts soak up the juice as well and are not as crunchy and hard on the teeth, but enough to still add texture and flavor to the salad.

Wow! Good salad, Kelly. Nice change from the usual Waldorf. Quite unique and very tasty. I'll be serving this at my ladies luncheon. Thanks for sharing.PS for a little extra crunch I chopped up one stock of celery. It adds crunch but doesn't compromise taste.

This was ok.  I had a salad similar to this a long time ago and have been trying to find one as good as the original.  This was not it.  All it seemed to be was apple.  My husband ate quite a bit of it, but I think I will try a few more recipes that are similar but with different variations until I find one I REALLY like.

This really does taste like a candy apple. Would be better a much better salad for fall than spring/summer. Overall, pretty good.

Great recipe!  I've taken this to two different gatherings and it has gone over VERY well at both.  This is easy to put together and adds something different to the usual potluck dishes.  Thank You, Kelly!

I love, love, love this salad.  My kids love it too (but I have to make a bowl with peanuts for me and without for them.)
I make it with all granny smith apples to get a contrasting tartness to the sweetness, and good unsalted peanuts are hard to come by, so I go ahead and use salted and it comes out really good anyway.   Also, I use about double the pineapple and extra creamy cool whip... Made it again today and had to sub corn starch for the tapioca. Used about half as much corn starch as it called for. The dressing looked and tasted kind of pasty until I added a tsp of butter. Then it cooked to the right consistency and became more transparent and the pasty flavor went away. :)

OK, I couldn't find instant tapioca in our grocery store, so I bought, I think, Minute Tapioca.  Hmmm...interesting turn out.  Chewy bits of tapioca.  But ya know, it was still good.  I used granny smith and Red Delicious for a little color.  And people really liked it, despite the Tapioca mistake!  I'll use this again!

Have made this several times (at least a dozen), and each time there is never any left! It's quite unique really and goes well with any dish. Would even be great as a desert. This is a wonderful salad for potlucks, very easy to prepare, takes no time at all. Why not try it just once, while everyone else is bringing jello or potato salad--be different. Promise it will get compliments.

My whole family loved it.  I made it for my friends wedding reception and was asked for the recipe.  Sidenote, make sure if you take it to a reception or party, make sure people know that it has nuts!

This simple salad has a very appealing subtle flavor that works very well with a meal or as a dessert.  Since my family doesn't care for nuts I used raisins instead and we really enjoyed the results.  We'll make this again!!

My husband and I both loved this dessert like salad.  Thank you for sharing it.  It's a great way to use wonderful fall apples.  Also I added another small can of pineapple tidbits to it for a little more fruit to use with the wonderful sauce.

I would give this 5 stars except that it really and truly needs to stay very cold or the flavor is not quite as good.  But when it was cold, right from the frig....it was very good.  I took it to a barbeque and it sat out for some time, thus not everyone was eating it or commenting on it.  But I still think it is a very good recipe and quite "different"....thus the 4 stars.

I wasn't able to make this recipe exactly as written the first time because I couldn't find instant tapioca and unsalted peanuts at my local grocery.  I use vanilla or butterscotch-flavored pudding and salted peanuts and it has become a family favorite for over a year.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

This is a delicious and interesting salad.  I prefer it with sweet apples (like Fuji), but I think some people would like the contrast of using some tart apples as well.  I happen to love the smell of vinegar, so I enjoy the aroma as I'm cooking the tapioca mixture.

I made this for a mixed group of friends (8 people) - and everyone raved about this and wanted the recipe (which I forwarded to all - including family back East).  

When making the dish I found that using two bowls to toss the chilled tapioca mix worked really well (using one bowl as a lid) - the mix spread very evenly.  Then I spooned in the cool whip.  Very easy to make!!!  While it probably could serve 12 - we dished it all out to 8 people and they all wanted more!!!  

This is a must try!!!  Most likely you already have most of the incredients, too!!!  (I also used the Quick Minute Tapioca - and it worked well.)

This dish was delicious we had it for dinner and it was nice in Arizona because of the cool fruit and the hot sun.

Its a bit overwhelming with the cider, so I reduced it by half.  I also used Splenda instead of sugar.  Its a wonderful side dish!

This was just so so for me. Actually kind of bland. I didn't notice any candy apple taste to it at all. Thanks for the recipe.

This salad smells absolutely awful while you are making it due to the vinegar that it calls for.  However, the end result is surprisingly good.  I took this to a family Thanksgiving get together and got rave reviews..Next time I will use less vinegar because as other reviewers say, I don't see why it is even needed.

This did not please my children or myself. It's not bad, it's just not great, either. I did not add the peanuts, but put them on the side for those to sprinkle in that wanted them. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is. I won't be making it again, as I probably will be eating this until it is gone, due to lack of enthusiasm in my house. I appreciate the recipe to try, Kelly, just not a hit at our home.

I think I would have enjoyed this salad immensely, if not for the cider vinegar.  In fact, the overwhelming vinegar flavor (and smell!), is the reason I only give it three stars.  Otherwise, the salad has the potential of being fabulous!  I'm not certain why the vinegar is even necessary, because it doesn't (in my opinion), lend anything good to the salad.  Again, that's just my opinion.  Nevertheless, I'm happy to have found the recipe; next time I'll just exclude the vinegar!

Fantastic! My family devours this one every time I make it. Instead of peanuts, I use pecans. They add a smooth, rich flavor to the dish.

This was great!  The apples stay white, don't discolor even by the next day.  I don't taste any vinegary taste, just tastes great, wouldn't change a thing!

This year was the first time I have ever made Christmas dinner.  I wanted to make soemthing different than the norm and this was the perfect pick. Everyone went back for seconds!  I will probably use a few less peanuts next time, but other than that it was great!

My friend made this for me at a BBQ he hosted.  Thankfully he let me take home the leftovers -- it was fabulous.  I've made this 3x's now.  The amount of peanuts "seems" like a lot, but it is really just right.  It's great as a side dish, dessert, snack.  I used green apples for 1/2 the amount, and red apples for the other 1/2.  Looks more colorful.  Enjoy.

Yummy! Very easy to make and it comes together nicely! I did find that 2 cups of peanuts seemed like an awful lot as I was putting them into the mixture, so I ended up only using 1-1/2 cups and I think that was a perfect amount.  I'm not sure about the serving size of 12; I think it would depend on what is considered a serving... but it fit perfectly into a 2 quart dish.  This is a dish you can make relatively inexpensively yet it is a nice presentation.  Looks as pretty as it tastes!

Everybody really liked this.  It was easy and the ingredients were readily available.  To me, it didn't taste very "taffy-like" but others said it did.  The peanuts made it unique.  Tripled the recipe for a large bowlful to serve 12.
