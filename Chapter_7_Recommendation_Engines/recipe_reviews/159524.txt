I gave it 4 stars b/c I made some changes. I used a can of reduced fat cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of milk & 1/4 cup of chicken broth (all I had) in place of the 2 cups of chicken broth. I also used a frozen veggie blend with carrots, peas, corn, lima beans & green beans. I mixed the rice, soup & liquids together and then poured in the pan. Poured the frozen veggies on top and then layered the chicken over that. Used sea salt, garlic powder, pepper & paprika. This turned out amazing and I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch today!!  UPDATE: The leftovers were even better b/c all the flavors had time to mix together. You could definitely make this ahead of time & freeze until you want to serve it!

I just brought this to a pot luck and it went over really well. When done it looks very impressive; if only my friends knew how easy it was to make! I used thick chicken breasts so it took longer, about two hours, but it still turned out good. This is a very versatile recipe; I'll try it again with different vegetable combos.

Great dish, I did add some canned mushrooms to it. I also had to cook it for about an hour & half @ 350. It still turned out GREAT.

Very tasty-I used 1/2 teaspoon of paprika to add a bit more flavor.

It was alright, I felt like it was missing something. Kinda of bland I guess. Maybe I need to practice a little more. I had to bake it for an hour and a half @ 350.

Used fresh veggies--carrots, onions, celery. And some frozen corn & peas. Needed more time. About 1 & 1/2 hours.

I had hoped to really like this. Made exactly as the recipe stated. Everyone's thoughts were not great, not bad.  Quick, easy fix one pot meal on a weeknight, but took really long to cook at 350 and the veggies were mush in the end. If I were to fix again I'd bake at 400 and add onion and mushrooms (maybe fresh veggies). Not sure if I will fix again.  Thanks though.

I chunked 3 frozen skinless, boneless chicken breasts and diced 2 fresh carrots and celery sticks. Also diced an onion.  Lightly salted & peppered the rice and vegetables then placed chicken chunks on top.  Lightly salted & peppered the chicken then sprinkled with paprika and thyme.  Baked at 400 for 1 hour 20 minutes.  Yum!

This is a great meal to make on a cold winter day.
After reading some of the other reviews, I did tweak it a bit.
After following instructions, I covered with a can of diced tomatoes and a can of green beans. The wife and I really liked it, and will save and make again.

Cook time was completely off for the wild rice. The rice didn't even cook. Ruined the whole thing and I ended up having to cook the rice separately.

This was a great recipe. I did use fresh veggies instead of frozen and I used quite a bit more than the 2 cups called for in the recipe. It was an amazing meal to make and put in my freezer for future lunches.
