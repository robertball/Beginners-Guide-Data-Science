These were very good! I made the following slight changes: creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy because we're not crazy about nuts in things, white whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the all-purpose, a little over 1 cup of semi-sweet chips for the chunks, and I upped the vanilla to 1 T. instead of 1 t.

Everybody I know who loves a peanutbutter cookie loves these.  These are the first to disappear.  Cookes bake up moist are not flat.

My new favorite cookie!! Its a thicker cookie, but not to thick. The only thing I changed was by adding half a bag of mini choc. chips instead of the choc. chunks.

Delicious and moist! I used a little more peanut butter and more chocolate chunks, baked for 10-1/2 minutes, and made sure they were pretty flat before I put them in the oven (they don't spread much). I didn't have time to refrigerate them, which is probably why the shorter bake time worked. Talk about a yummy cookie! Thanks!

Great cookies! Made some alterations that came out fabulous. I added 1/2 tsp. coconut extract and 1 tsp. ground cinnamon. Also, I combined equal amounts of creamy peanut butter and marshmallow cream and stuffed the cookies before baking. Absolutely decadent!

This dough was so easy to work with. It was easy to form and made beautifully shaped cookies. I love the addition of the oats. My family only requested that I use milk chocolate next time.
**This recipe makes way more cookies than it claims.

These were pretty good, but I think the honey gave it a strange aftertaste. We still enjoyed them, though.

YUM! Oats, PB, honey, and chocolate: all of my favorite things in one dessert! I substituted milk chocolate chips for the squares of semisweet chocolate, and used a little extra honey. These were a hit!

Just baked a batch of these cookies, and they came out perfectly wonderful!!  This is now my favorite cookie recipe ever!  I love the addition of the honey and the way it enhances the peanut taste. And the dark chocolate chunks just take it over the edge in taste and add a bit of sophistication.  They are positively addicting.

The recipe was alright. It definitely needs an electric mixer though because I hand mixed it and it turned out too oily. The taste was a little too muffly as well so I recommend peanut butter that has salt in it.

I made these cookies yesterday and they were delicious, forgot to add the vanilla and instead of refrigerating them just dropped by teaspoon full onto pam sprayed cookie sheet.  You could really taste the honey!  I used 1 cup of special dark chocolate chips instead of the chunk chocolate-yummy!

I followed this recipe exactly and was very disappointed.  My husband who loves just about all desserts thought they were "dry".  I tried cooking each batch a different time just in case I had overdone them the first time, but yielded similar results...very dry.  Will NOT be making these again.

What a great recipe!  The peanut butter flavor of these cookies is nice and strong and the brown sugar and honey add a really complex sweetness.  The oatmeal adds some nice texture too!  I will definitely be making these again!

These were pretty good.  The only thing I changed was I used Brown Sugar Splenda Blend because I didn't have enough regular brown sugar.  The cookes are very soft.  I took them to a party and everyone liked them.  They were gone very quickly. I'm not sure how I personally liked the peanutbutter and chocolate toger, although I normally like that combination very well.  Everyone else liked them, so I will probably make them again.  I may use more oatmeal in the future.

These cookies are FABULOUS! They come out so perfectly and their rich taste is absolutely addictive. My boyfriend and I couldn't stop eating them.  The only thing I changed when I made them the second time is to use 1/2 the amount of peanut butter and a little more oats to hold the texture. It's still oh-so-peanut-buttery, with half the fat.

Lovely.  Yes, they are soft and chewy, which is what I love.  I doubled the recipe and ran out of honey and brown sugar.  I was only short about a TBS of honey, so I used real maple syrup for the rest.  I added a bit of white sugar, but I usually reduce sugar anyway.  I used half whole wheat pastry flour.  I had a bunch of chips to use up, so I used milk, semisweet, and white chocolate chips.  Delicious!

Great, soft, peanut butter cookies that didn't get stale for a whole week. The honey is definitely discernable, however. So you if you don't want your peanut butter cookies to taste like honey, this probably isn't the recipe for you.

I halved this recipe and made it with whole-wheat flour and creamy peanut butter - YUM!!! It was the perfect amount to satisfy my sweet tooth and not have a ton of cookies around the house.  Also, I used chocolate chips instead of squares.  One funny thing I noticed is that while the cookies were still warm, they tasted really salty and I was bummed, thinking I screwed up the recipe.  After they cooled down all the way, the salty taste was gone and they were just plain awesome!

these were some of the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had.  I used maple syrup instead of honey and only 1/2 c. of br. sugar. They were great! (I added lots more chunks and white chips as well)

These were alright. They don't have the crumbly peanut butter cookie texture that other PB cookies have. They're more soft and chewy. They actually remind me a lot of like an Otis Spunkmeyer cookie or something you'd get  from a deli. Not bad, but I'm sticking with my other PB cookie recipe.

These turned out wonderfully!  Instead of using the squares of semi sweet chocolate, I used the pre-packaged chunks (and added a bit more than the 5 oz this calls for!).  I kept the mix in the fridge while each batch was baking so they would stay firm... like I said, wonderful.

This is a great cookie!  Followed the recipe exactly except used 1 cup chocolate chips for chocolate chunks.  Wonderful texture and flavor.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious cookies. I doubled the recipe. I think you can leave out the honey, I only added a few teaspoons and I still found them too sweet.

The only change I made was using Nestle milk chocolate chips, because that was what I had in the house.  I also added coarse salt to the tops, because I love that.  This recipe was fabulous and for sure a keeper!!!

Only change was that I used chocolate chunks instead of chopping chocolate. They came out good even though I overcooked them but if I hadn't, they would of been great!

This was a great recipe, they we're big and stayed moist. I do recommend adding more peanut butter and a little more sugar. The Reese's pieces I added was a great touch.

These are good little cookies - nothing out of the ordinary tho.  Replaced 1 cup of all purpose with 1 cup of white whole wheat flour and the chocolate chunks with 1 cup of mini chocolate chips and a whole tablespoon of vanilla.  Flattened the cookies out somewhat before cooking.  Did not chill the dough and cooked for a little more than 10 minutes.  This made 40 cookies for me and will make again, as it was simple, quick and tasty.  However, the honey was quite noticeable, so if cooking for someone who doesn't care for honey, beware.

I made this recipe twice. The first time i made it exactly as the recipe said and the cookies were very good. They didn't last though the night here as "Mr. Nobody" ate them all while the rest of the house was sleeping. The second time I omitted Oats and Honey and added 1/4 of a teaspoon of cinnamon and served them with icecream and  chocolate and rum sauce as the desert at a dinner party. This variation went down well and was very enjoyable.   The recipe is very easy to make and tastes very good. I will be using this recipe again soon.

this recipe is amazing. i wanted a peanut butter cookie but not the traditional heavy cookie like i always do. i thought i'd try this recipe and it turned out great. kids and hubby went nuts over them. they sure didn't last long. im going to try adding trail mix or peanuts next time instead of the chocolate chips. very yummy soft cookies though. this recipe is a keep for sure

I just made these. Literally - not all are out of the oven yet. I love PB Choc Chip cookies, and I have another recipe but it calls for so much oil I decided to seek out another. So glad I did! My boyfriend (who is a major sweet lover) actually stopped playing XBox to come get another and announced to all his friends that they were missing out. The only changes I made were creamy PB (didn't have chunky), using about 1 C choc chips instead of chunks, and I added about 2T cinnamon vanilla non-dairy coffee creamer at the end because the dough looked dry. Don't know that I can taste it, but the finished product is super yummy!!

These are awesome cookies. My family gives rave reviews and have ordered more. They have spread the word and I now have orders for them from all their friends. The only downside is that I can't keep any around.

I loved these! Soft and chewy. The peanut butter flavor isn't too strong, so add more if that's what you want. The oatmeal and honey are perfect additions. I won't change a thing about this recipe.

Excellent, but was afraid to make it exactly as indicated.   I added extra oats and extra flour.  Guessing, I would think about a total of 1 cup oats and 1 extra cup flour.   They are terrific and done in 12 minutes.  Excellent.  (Next time I'll add the chocolate chips) DEFINITELY  a re-do.  This made 40 cookies.

Mixed up a double batch of these cookies, followed the directions with the exception of adding the honey, which I didn't have on hand, and besides, there is enough sweetness from the brown sugar.  Used a solid milk chocolate bunny from the freezer leftover from Easter for the chocolate chunks.  Used a muffin scoop to place them on the baking sheets....they were a wonderful size!  Also, did not grease the baking sheets as I thought there was enough "lubricant" to keep them from sticking with all the peanut butter and butter...I was right, they just about slid off the pans.  Because of the size I made them, I had to bake them for 14 minutes...but they were like biting into a piece of peanut buttery and chocolate heaven.  Will definately make these again!

I LOVE these cookies. Since i doubled the batch, i was suppose to put 2 cups of sugar in but i cut it down to 1 1/2 since there was still 1/2 cup of honey to be added. Next time i will use only 1 cup of brown sugar and the half cup of honey and i'm sure it will be plenty sweet. I used Reases pieces instead of chocolate chunks. MMMMM!

I made these cookies with a regular cheap peanut butter that was was sweater than the regular skippy type brand. I'm sure that with a better peanut butter these will come out much better- will try again, and SOON. Oh, and BTW, no one had a chance to taste them because i finished them all!

I thought these were pretty good.  I substituted 1/2 c. whole wheat flour for some of the white flour and I ran out of honey, so had to use 1/8 c of corn syrup.  I used Adam's crunchy PB.  My dough was not easy to mix as some others have said, and it was extremely oily.  Overall though, it was a very easy and fast recipe and would probably make it again.

These have become a fast favorite in our house.  They are easy to make and my husband and daughter gobble them up.  I don't change anything in the recipe I just learned the hard way to watch the cooking time about 8-9 mins max for us I hate hard cookies.

Fantastic Recipe! Only used 1/2 the brown sugar and used all natural, fresh ground peanut butter. Also added chopped walnuts.

These were pretty good cookies.  They had a good peanut butter taste, and baked up nice and tall and fluffy (no spreading).  I also liked the P.B. and honey combo, and the texture from the oats and chunky peanut butter.  However, I thought that they were kind of a lot of work for a peanut butter cookie.  A lot of ingredients, and a lot of steps.  I might make again, but I will be sure to at least double the recipe to make all of the work worthwhile.

Perfect!  I threw in just over half a bag of peanut butter chips, and the result threw everyone just about over the moon.  Just the right chewiness -- I just used President's Choice organic, *crunchy* peanut butter, and the chunks were the  most mouth-watering  size.  Never tasted a better peanut butter cookie.

These were great! They were more soft out of the oven than I'm used to but after they set up they were great. A good chewyness. Yes, Chewyness.

awesome recipe. unbelievably soft... i wouldn't make it if you're a fan of crispy peanut butter cookies... but it was great... i didn't have any peanuts or oatmeal which was okay but i would usually add it for the added crunch. I'd definitely make these again.

These cookies were great. I used Andes mint pieces instead of regular chocolate chips. Peanut butter and mint actually compliment each other pretty well.

These were so YUM! I didnt have the crunchy PB but will try that next time. Also... after they came out of oven (mine only stayed 11 min) I used the bottom of the measuring cup to gently press them flat. Kids loved them and husband (who doenst like cookies) ate 4!!

This recipe was awesome!!! I hate chocolate however so I used white chocolate instead and it worked perfect. I think this cookie is the best cookie I have ever eaten!!
