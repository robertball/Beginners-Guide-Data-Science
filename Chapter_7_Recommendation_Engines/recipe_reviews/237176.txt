I can never go wrong with Chef John's recipes!  I did change slightly to cater to my family's tastes.  I didn't trust myself to make the shell, so I put the puff pastry into my rectangle tart pan.  As the grocery only had thin asparagus, I had to us a lot more.  I cut into thirds.  I used some garlic-herb soft cheese and sour cream as the base.  I served as an Easter appetizer.  Everyone loved it!  Next time I'll make two!

I made this for a birthday luncheon with maple salmon from this website, and a fresh corn salad.  It was great!    After a 'test run' I did find the mustard a bit too pronounced, so I added a little more creme fraiche.  The puff pastry I had in my supermarket (Pepperidge Farms) was about 10" by 10", so when I rolled up (twisted) a half inch on all sides, I was left with a 9" by 9" area.  For this, I needed about 12-13 medium sized stalks of Asparagus, but only used one portion of the sauce. This square was perfect for 4 portions as a side dish.

It was really good.  I mean, look at the ingredients -- you'd have to mess up worse than I did to make it not delicious. 

First, apparently, there are different sizes of puff pastry.  This is my first time using it, so I didn't realize it and I got a giant one.  It didn't really detract from the deliciousness, it just made a ton more than Chef John's.  Second, I didn't have a silicone baking mat.  I didn't think it would make a big difference, but the bottom burned really bad in the first 10 minutes of "pre baking".  The burned part luckily stuck to the pan, so I just ran with it, and the second part of the baking when I transferred it to a different pan it crisped it up nicely.  All in all, very delicious.

I added some horseradish to the mustard mixture. THIS WAS DELICIOUS!!! I used a homemade puff pastry, made from the recipe found on this site. The side border collapsed, but, ah well.

Sadly, it broke apart when I took it out of the pan, but that did not make it taste worse - just the presentation. Maybe with more practice it'll look better.

4-stars for presentation (although I bought the fatter spears - planning for 5/person, I could've used another spear or 2 of asparagus to fill the pastry). Attractive presentation, easy to prepare. I liked the asparagus; wish the bottom portion of the pastry was flakier.  I didn't love the pairing of the mustard sauce with the vegetable.

Very nice, very easy and made a good presentation for company.  Made exactly per recipe, and 4 of us ate it all.  IF we had any leftovers, I am wondering how it would have fared in the refrigerator?

Very fancy and very easy. I has the potential to be a 5 star. Next time I will make more sauce and add a little more seasoning.

I really like asparagus tarts on puff pastry, but I did not care for the asparagus/cream/Dijon combo. These are all ingredients I like, just not this combo. I liked recipes that were more asparagus with cheese styled.
