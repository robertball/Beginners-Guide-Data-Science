This was quite good, but I only gave it 4 stars because of the jarred sauce. It is much better when homemade. One hint, though-- make sure the polenta is set up before you add the sauce, or you'll end up with a slushy polenta mess. Still tasty, but not very pretty.

Referring to the review that said "polenta=grits": No, polenta is made of fine ground yellow cornmeal.  Grits are made of ground hominy.  While the cooking technique is similar, polenta is much smoother and tastes VERY different.

Believe it or not this is the 1st time this old southern gal has made polenta.  I am not real sure if I cooked it long enough but, it worked out well.  I did not spread the sauce over the polenta. I did not want to risk it getting soggy so, I cut the polenta into pieces, fried slightly in skillet put on individual plates and covered in the sauce and cheese.  The kids, even the picky eater, loved this dish.  I was slightly impressed with myself on this one!

Sooo good and healthy! Used just a little olive oil to fry the slices of polenta.  I used what i had: frozen spinach, red peppers, red onion, mushrooms and it was unbelievable!

A unique way to have serve sausage.  I did as others suggested, baked the polenta, sauteed the sausage w/sauce and waited until time to serve then placed a slice of polenta on plate and topped w/sausage and sauce mixture.

This was good but I did it a lot different. I used jiffy cornbread on the bottom and used home made sauce

Great recipe! I made it exactly as written. My husband and son both had seconds! Some helpful hints: 1) add the cornmeal to the boiling water as you whisk, not vice versa, 2) after 20 minutes in the oven, touch the surface of your polenta gently to make sure it's "set"- mine felt like it the surface of a just-baked cheesecake but grittier. The polenta itself has almost zero flavor, but with the sauce baked on top, the sausage juice gets in there and it's delicious! Add more parmesan, or maybe cook the polenta with broth rather than plain water if you want more flavor.

Did not go over very well with the family. I thought it was alright, but they were not crazy about the polenta.

The polenta was bland the sauce would have been better served over pasta.  I will not be making this again.

I've done this for years, but in the south we call polenta=grits. It is very good though.  You might think it funny but I only heard of polenta about 5 years ago.  Bur grits all my life...LOL

Followed the recipe but the "polenta" had zero flavor and didn't set. Was bland and mushy. :(

4 stars for me, 1 for boys (they said they didn't like it, but ate most of it), 3 for husband.  Whatever, I liked it, and not totally unhealthy.

I have this recipe with tweaks to it...this makes a HUGE difference. Layer of cream cheese mixed with tsp of garllic and a bit of basil (just warm the cream cheese in the microwave so it spreads easier. You can also buy Polenta in the tube form. It is already cooked. So super easy. You just slice that up. They are then little circles of polenta. I layer the polenta in one flat layer. Then start layering everything else. So you put it together like a lasagna. But all these ingredients are the same. So yum!

It just made kind of a weird mush.  I'm going to try scraping off the top and baking the bottom more for the leftovers before giving up.  Maybe the top and bottom should just be made separately and combined at the table.

I have never made polenta.  My family was not very impressed, but it was a quick weeknight dinner.

I really enjoyed this a lot!  I think next time I'll slice the sausage and then bake.  The polenta was excellent.

The recipe is perfect as-is (even if you don't make your own sauce-- I didn't!); but my family could've lived without all that sausage.  A half pound would be more than plenty.  I might try it next time with no meat at all, as a nice meat-free entree.  I was concerned that the polenta wouldn't set up all the way after only 20 minutes in the oven; but, it was just fine.  I let the polenta sit for another 10 minutes or so before putting the sauce mixture on top, checking for firmness.  This is one of the easiest polenta recipes I've tried, and it was a perfect use for my turkey Italian sausage!

A decent, humble, no-fuss, make-ahead meal for a hungry man.  Not fine dining, of course, but good for a week night.  Tastes yummy.

It was OK.  I made homemade spaghetti sauce - so a lot of work for something that would've tasted better over pasta!
