This was very good! I did make a few adjustments, however. I marinated my chicken in Italian dressing before cooking - it added a great flavor to the pizza and helped to keep the chicken moist. I omitted the artichokes, (husband dislikes them) and instead sliced up a few Roma tomatoes to put on top of the chicken - I sprinkled the tomatoes with fresh ground pepper and salt. I used mozzarella because it's what I had on hand. I also mixed in some of a 3 cheese blend I had left over (asiago, romano, and parmesan) it added a nice punch to the flavor of the cheese. I used a Boboli crust and Classico brand basil pesto - it was VERY tasty. I will definitely keep this recipe on hand!

This is so yummy!  I substituted mushrooms for the artichokes and added onions and sliced cherry tomatoes.  I also cooked the chicken in olive oil and garlic.  I used sun-dried tomato and basil mozzarella for the cheese.  This turned out just as good as the resturant we get gourmet pizza from.

Very very good! I made this for an impromptu birthday party for hubby's friend and everyone LOVED this pizza. I even had to give out the recipe it was so well recieved! I used a Boboli thin pizza crust, 2 cooked, diced white boneless chicken breasts, half a can of artichoke hearts sliced up, and Classico basil pesto spread along with an Italian blend pizza cheese. I used an entire package and another handful of cheese and added torn fresh basil leaves as well on the top. Thanks for sharing this wonderful pizza recipe Lisa!

This pizza was so good! My brother loved it, and ate slice after slice. The only change I made was related to the cheese. I've never used fontina cheese, and all I had at home was an Italian blend of mozzerela and romano. I used way more than an 1/2 cup, and it was very good. I always figure, the more cheese, the better!

This was so good and easy!  I made a few changes to suit our tastes:  drained one can of diced tomato; skipped artichokes and used mozzarella.  Next time I think I'll make this with shrimp instead of chicken.  I'll definitely make this again.

Made this pizza with a homemade wholewheat pizza dough and it was outstanding. Knew it would be.  Careful with the artichoke hearts though because some of the prepared marinade types are alittle overpowering.  Add fresh tomatos and it is outstanding.

I took a previous reviewers advice and made this with shrimp instead.  It was very good.  I just added some fresh chopped tomatoes.  Maybe a little garlic added to this would be good too.  I'll try that next time, because I will make it again!

So yummy!! I used a frozen pizza crust, omitted the artichokes and substituted monterrey jack cheese.  I think the fontina or even mozzarella would be better but I didn't have any.  It was great and so easy anyway!

This was excellent! I used the pizza dough II recipe on this website and it was very good with this recipe! I bought two different brands of pesto basil sauce (I don't know why I just did) and mixed them together on the pizza. I also used a blend of parmesan and mozzerella cheese, and brushed the crust with olive oil/garlic and sprinkled some mozzerella on it as well. I grilled some chicken breast and brushed it with olive oil/garlic as well. I also sauteed some mushrooms and put them on the pizza, and I chopped up fresh basil from our garden and sprinkled it on top. The end result was amazing! My family kept telling me how delicious it was and told me I could make it every week. They also told me that I could open a restaurant and serve this and it would sell out! Haha this recipe is a keeper! :)

very yummy pizza! I used a packet mix for the pesto and leftover shredded chicken breast. Substituted Mozarella for the fontina cuz that's what I had. My kids raved about it. They like pesto on spaghetti squash so the taste was familiar to them. But I think they liked this even better! I will most definitely make this again.

This pizza is great tasting, easy to make and quick. We added a lot of extra topping just because we had them on hand. It was great with spinach, mushrooms, scallons and asparagus on top. We will definately be making this again.

The artichokes are good, but for a change of pace, I will use roasted red peppers, mushrooms, and red onion.....it's fabulous and looks really pretty.

Super easy and good! I used mozzerella because I didn't have fontina and rotisserie chicken instead of the chicken strips. Nice! Thanks for the recipe!

This is 10 STARS!!  I boiled 3 chicken breasts, shredded it with 2 forks and added pizza seasoning to it.  I only used 1 tablespoon of pesto, which was plenty.  For veggies I cooked a can of mushrooms, diced up a red onion and sliced about 7 cherry tomatoes in a dash of olive oil for 5 minutes.  To keep the fat low I used shredded fat-free mozarella cheese too.  Piled everything on top of a thin crust Bobabli brand and cooked direct of oven rack at 450 for 8 minutes.  I'll be making this a ton!

Family enjoyed it!  I will make again.  I grilled the chicken beforehand with salt/pepper/garlic powder.  I also used a basil and tomato sauce instead.  It was delicious.  Next time may cook longer so the crust is well done.

This was a great change from standard pizza night! I used Valentinos Pizza Crust from this website, but I didn't wait for it to bake all the way through since I normally don't prebake the crust - BIG mistake! trust the prebaked note on this recipe. I also used more cheese and less chicken, and I used an Italian blend. Will be adding this to our regular recipe rotation!

Use lots of pesto on crust for more flavour and moisture.

Made this with the addition of baby bella mushrooms, and using my own dough recipe.  I cut the artichoke hearts into quarters.  Cooked some Market Day chicken in the skillet with salt and pepper, then sliced it for the pizza.  Delicious..

Amazing pizza! I didn't follow the recipe exactly... I didn't use chicken at all and I ended up adding a bunch of vegetable (roma tomatoes, artichoke hearts and green peppers), I also replaced the fontina cheese with mozzarella(reduced fat).  I thought that it was delicious and a little healthier than normal pizza.

OMG!!!!Absolutley delicious. After reading a few of the reviews,I made a few changes. I added flavor to every layer of this pizza(not that it was really needed): I used a refigerated dough (fresher flavor)I omitted the artichoke hearts and added mushrooms,to save time, I bought one of those rotisserie chickens, deboned/shredded & seasoned (to our taste) the breast and soaked it in its au jus(because a reviewer claimed the chicken came out dry);spreaded butter over the crust;sprinkled the pesto with a little salt;in addition to the fontina I added a pizzeria mix of cheeses and assembled as directed.I've never made pizza, partly because I'm not a big pizza lover.I really don't care too much for the red sauce but after reading and loving all the ingredients in this recipe,I had to give it a try; and oh boy, am I glad I did.My boys told me to rate this a ten and requested that I make it the next day for lunch (only had the dark meat left,so that's what I used and it still came out delish).Try this and enjoy!!

This is fantastic, my wife now has a pesto obsession that this recipe fulfills. I made it tonight with shredded rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, reduced fat mozzarella cheese I had leftover, diced roma tomatoes, mushrooms in place of artichoke, and some thinly sliced and diced red onions. Since there were so many toppings it took about 15 minutes at 425. Awesome recipe

This was a pretty good jumping off point and I have no doubt it would have been good made "as is". I did make a few changes based upon what I had on hand. Used 1 cup chicken and one cup shrimp that I chopped up. I also marinated both the chicken and shrimp in Italian seasoning (I used Emeril's but any would work) for about an hour before cooking. I sauteed the chicken, and a few minutes before it was done, I added shrimp then set aside. In the same pan I added a bit more olive oil and sauteed three thinly sliced white mushrooms and just a smidge of red onion (instead of artichoke which I did not have) until tender. Assembled in the same order adding 2 sliced Roma tomatoes before the chicken and shrimp. I used 5 cheese Italian blend and sprinkled all with a little more seasoning before popping into the oven.

this pizza is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. the only change i would suggest is to maybe marinate the chicken in an italian dressing/onion/pepper/basil marinade before putting it on the pizza because plain cooked or pre-cooked chicken tends to be bland. otherwise it's PERFECT

This was amazing! The only thing I recommend (I had never cooked with pesto sauce before), is if you're using the packet of pesto, make the version that is less liquidy because it doesn't quite thicken up enough for a pizza, but the chicken combined with pesto on a pizza was awesome!

I thought this recipe was great and very easy. Fontina cheese works great but I substituted mozzarella the next time and it works just as good I thought. I enjoyed a not so normal pizza and the fact that this one takes no time at all is wonderful. I used the Pizza Crust II recipe and I and all my friends love it!

I love this! We make it all the time. We add chopped kalamata olives and a little red onion. I usually shake some oregano on the top, too. I don't use fontina -- I use a mozz/parm blend. Yum all around - we always finish off the whole darn thing!

The pizza is very good. I pre-cooked the crust, used mozzarella cheese instead, and left out the artichokes. I will make it again in the future.

Very good, with just a few adjustments.  I brushed my crust w/ olive oil.  Used mozzerella and feta cheeses, and added sun-dried tomatoes and red onions.  TWO VERY IMPORTANT steps are 1) Put cheese on first, then toppings 2) after baking for 10 minutes, I broil it for a couple minutes until bubbly.

This was really delicious.  I used homemade pesto and homemade pizza crust.  I couldn't find fontina so I used an Italian blend of shredded cheeses.  This would also be good with mushrooms and onions or pine nuts added.

This was so good. I altered the recipe a little bit, and I was originally making it to replicate one of my boyfriends favorite dishes at a restaurant in another state. Anyway, used a Boboli thick crust, Victors pesto, cubed up chicken and shrimp and tossed with a little olive oil and emeril's chicken rub and cooked in a pan. Also threw on some marinated artichoke hearts. topped it all off with a blend of italian cheeses and baked for ten minutes. Boyfriend said it was one of the best things he has ever eaten and was better then his restaurant favorite!

OMG!  This was sooo good. I made a few adjustments- I sautéed the chicken in a four cheese prego sauce, sprinkled Italian dressing, and a small dash of garlic salt.  I also added small cuts of tomato on top of the basil pesto pasta.

I had multiple things going on in the kitchen when trying to put this together so really didn't pay attention to the directions beforehand.  So when I actually read them, I was thinking "that's it?".  One kid does not like artichokes so I substituted his slices with black olives.  He loved it.  It was very good and I'll make it again.  Supereasy and delicious.

Excellent! I picked up some fontina and Trader Joe's pesto when I was in the big city last week, used a home made pizza crust (pre-baked) and chicken breast meat I had used to make broth. I topped half the pizza per instructions and the other half using some hints and adjustments from the reviewers. The basic side was very good and would rate 5 stars by itself, especially as an appetizer. On the other half, I used about double the cheese, and added some very thin slices of Roma tomato and a little sprinkle of red pepper flakes. That half was excellent as well! Thanks, Lisa...and thanks reviewers!

This was surprisingly good! I shredded cooked boneless chicken breast instead of chicken strips.  I added portobello mushrooms, onion, and some Texas Pete because I love a little kick when I make pizzas!  I also used Asiago cheese, since it is what I had on hand.  Will definitely make this pizza again!

This recipe is fantastic. I've made it a few different ways - with chicken I cooked on the stove top, with mushrooms instead of chicken, and with pulled pieces from a rotisserie chicken. The one with the rotisserie chicken was BY FAR the tastiest. Also, I know that some have commented that they subbed mozzarella for fontina, but, having made it with both, I can say that making it with fontina tastes much better (even though it's still good with mozzarella). I found fontina with the specialty cheeses at my local grocer and, while more expensive, it is well worth it.

Lots of flavor in this pizza! I sauteed chicken tenders and added sun dried tomatoes. Served with a garden salad for a perfect meal.

This is my favorite non-tomato pizza yet. Great combination of flavors. Straight into the recipe box it goes!

Wow, FULL of flavor.  This is the first time I tried fontina cheese, and I loved, it's perfect for this pizza.  I suggest using marinated artichoke hearts, they were just awesome with everything else on the pie.  This will definately be made again!!

So easy, an outstanding quick meal.  I cooked up the chicken ahead of time, so it only took me about 5 minutes to prepare the pizza, and dinner was ready 10 mins later!  My boyfriend and I fought over who got to take the leftovers to work today.  PS, I left out the artichoke hearts, added some sliced Roma tomato on top of the cheese (mozarella and a Mexican blend we happened to have left over from taco night), and I didn't measure any of the ingredients.  A delicious meal that requires no measuring cups or baking dishes is a definite ***** in my book!  Thanks, Lisa!

My family loved this pizza!  It was delicious and easy.  I made it twice already.  The second time I added potato, which was a great addition.  I highly recommend it!

This was fabulous; true gourmet stuff. I made a homemade pre-baked crust (used Fleischman's Pizza Crust Yeast--no rising, 5-minutes from start to oven). Was leery of the fontina, but it MAKES this recipe.  Make your own quick crust and don't substitute other cheese if you want the 5-star result and a TRUE chicken pesto pizza. It galls me when people change this recipe with multiple substitutions and then review it.  It isn't the same recipe, people!
NOTE: If you don't want to pre-bake the crust, use a pre-heated pan or stone and increase the baking time by a few minutes. Loosely cover the pizza with foil for the last few minutes to prevent the crust sides from burning.

My family loves this! I've made it twice, substituting sautéed onions & garlic for artichoke hearts and using naan flatbread for the crust. Since I always have tapenade on hand, I'll add a little of that next time. The pesto sauce really enhances the taste of the pizza. Thank you Lisa!

This looked and smelled wonderful, but the flavour wasn't what I had anticipated.  I wasn't able to find the fontina cheese, so made use of  a mozza blend of cheeses. Perhaps that made a difference.  I felt it needed some va-voom.

Just had this for dinner... YUMMY!!! The artichokes added such a great flavor with the pesto. We didn't have fontine cheese, so just used shredded mozzarella.

LOVED this pizza.... only a few changes... added some minced garlic, S&P to the oil I cooked my chicken in on the stove.  I used mozarella cheese instead since it is all I could find, and used more like 2 cups of cheese instead of 1/2.  I cooked it for 12 minutes instead of 10.  I'd like to add tomatoes next time.  Yum!  This will be going into the recipe book at home.

Good and easy to put together but it is SOOO salty.  I used bottled pesto and would like to try this again with my own pesto sauce, which generally isn't so salty.  I even washed the artichokes but that didn't help much.  Overall a good recipe.

This was great! I cooked the chicken with garlic powder to give it a little something extra and I used a little more cheese than the recipe calls for. This was easy, quick and delicious! Thanks for sharing!!

This was a great meal!  I rinsed the artichokes well and used slightly less pesto after reading other reviewers saying it came out too salty.  I used Mozzarella cheese because that's what I had on hand, and I sprinkled parmesan on it before I baked it.  Because some people said the chicken came out dry, I put it on the pizza before I sprinkled the cheese on, and it didn't dry out that way.  Absolutely delish!

I used mushrooms instead of artichoke hearts, and mozzarella instead of fontina, and the whole family loved it. I also ended up using 3/4 cups of pesto (which was a whole container), since it looked a bit skimpy with just 1/2 cup on there.

This really was amazing!  I wasn't in the position to buy fresh crust - Boboli was the perfect substitute.  I also marinated my chicken in vinegarette dressing - Brianna's (its what I had on hand).  I chopped up the chicken once cooked and put it back into its juices for a few minutes.
I doubled the artichokes and used fresh mozzerella (sliced) and a little fresh, shredded parmesean.  I baked it according to the Boboli instructions and used a pizza stone!  We will eat this alot!

Used 1 lb chicken, 12 inch Boboli thin crust pie, Knorr's pesto sauce mix and it was INCREDIBLE.  I am NOT a cheese person; normally I take the cheese OFF my pizza.  I used the fontina cheese and it was AMAZING.  Aside from the extra chicken, I didn't change a thing and it was SUPERB. Neighbors were talking about it for days.  A+++++++

Delicious! I used a six cheese italian blend, doubled/tripled the amount of cheese, and used approximately 3/4 cup of chopped smoked salmon.  I really recommend using the smoked salmon because it goes great with the pesto sauce!

This is the best chicken pizza I have ever had. I never had fontina cheese so I was a little skeptical to use it. Wow, its so good. I will find more recipes to use in it. My 9 year old daughter hates anything green I was surprised when she asked for a piece. She ended up liking it so much she had 4 slices. She even ate the artichokes thats amazing. I will be eating this at least once a week if not more. Thank you for posting.

My friends love this recipe so much that whenever I make this recipe, I make an extra one to give away!  This is a great 'starter' recipe to add whatever you like.  I roll the chicken pieces in Italian breadcrumbs before cooking, add fresh sliced tomatoes, mushrooms, and fresh spinach leaves.  I also substitute lots of mozzarella cheese.  Always a hit.

My goal was bite-size appetizers, and this recipe leant a touch of elegance to the ordinary.  I used a sun-dried tomato basil pesto, spooning about 1 t on 1/2" baguette slices, then added a few chunks of pre-cooked chicken breast strips, and topped off with just a sprinkling of an low-fat italian blend of shredded cheeses.  A hit at the bachelorette party I "catered"!

I first made this pizza last year and it was a hit with my roommates and me.  I usually add some chopped up roma tomatoes and use mozerella instead of fontina chesse.  It's one of my favorite meals now!

I was looking for an alternative to the usual Thursday "pizza night" and BABOOM...This pizza was da bomb!!!  I used a can of Italian inspired diced tomatoes instead of slices, added some onion, mushrooms, and a variety of white cheeses. Absolutely Delicious, with a capital D !!!

Pretty good.  I would recommend dicing the chicken chunks into small pieces to get really good coverage on the pizza.  Also, serve with pizza or pasta sauce for dipping.

Outstanding pizza!!! I would give it 5 stars if it included the following (which I added to make the pizza literally mouth watering!): toasted pine nuts, sautéed onions, and a bit of seal salt once it comes out of the oven. Also, due to limited grocery store selection, I used an Italian cheese blend instead of fontina- still amazing! I opted

Awesome recipe! I used the Kerr's pesto mix packet for a quick mixture and cut up some plum tomatoes to add as a topping. I used a mixture of feta cheese and mozzarella to get that yummy melted cheese and popped it into the toaster oven for a personal pizza. Thank you for the quick dinner solution.

Wow. Fantastic. One of my new favorite pizzas. Used Boboli thin crust. Added roasted red peppers and mushrooms. The artichoke hearts were the marinated variety. Fantastic combination of flavors. The fontina makes it, try not to substitute a different cheese. Be careful not to use too much pesto since it separates and becomes oily when baked in the oven.

Instead of chicken, I used some leftover shrimp.  So good, and so easy!  We buy pizza dough from our local pizzeria--it's inexpensive and freezes well.

This pizza is so good--I used a Bobolli ready-made crust, Classico Basil Pesto, marinated chopped artichoke hearts, sliced roma plum tomoatoes and sweet yellow onion.  Topped it all off with Italian blend shredded cheese and it was perfection.  I left the chicken out as a time-saver and it was still great. This is definitely a keeper-tasted like something you'd get at a restaurant. I did have to let it bake a little longer so the cheese would be good and melted, but no big deal. Quick and easy, too!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is very good as it is written (mostly as written - I used the mozzarella I had on hand instead of fontina).   I also made this for a picky friend of mine, skipping the artichokes and adding quartered cherry tomatoes.  Which I also found delicious.  She picked off the tomatoes and loved it.  :)

It was just okay, my 1st homemade pizza ever. Followed recipe to the T. Maybe if I would have used marinated chokes it would have had some flavor. It was very bland, had to use red pepper flakes to get some kind of flavor. Figured I wasted a cub of my homemade pesto sauce. Sorry.

Such a nice easy dinner.  I will definitely make it again.  I used sliced plum tomato and an italian cheese blend that worked very nicely.

The first bite convinced me it was not at all ridiculous to offer a wine suggestion. Very savory, your kitchen will smell heavenly. Good way to use leftover chicken and the jar of artichoke hearts nobody will touch. My husband is going to be home late tonight. Too bad. There won't be any of this pizza left. Bravo!

This is a good base recipe.  I cooked the thinly sliced chicken in oil/butter mix with red pepper flakes and a little garlic powder. After the chicken is cooked I grate parm & asiago cheese on it and stir around so the cheese melts, the oil helps it stick.
I used the pizza dough II found on this site.  I rolled it out very thin and spread butter (not melted!) on the crust before spreading the pesto on the crust.  Using a little butter adds so much flavor to the pesto and crust.  I also used mozzerella cheese with more asiago and parm grated on top.  Artichokes would have been a great addition but I didn't have them on hand.

I give it four because I changed the recipe. Instead of chicken, I used spicy Italian sausage, ground. Topped with black olives and mushrooms. It is GREAT. I give this 4 stars for inspiring me!

Excellent and easier to prepare than I thought. We used to buy chicken pesto pizza at a local restuarant before it closed down.. homemade was even better! I used shredded italian blend cheese.

Good pizza!  I have made it several times.  Have used my own pesto and added roasted red peppers.  I also add additional artichoke hearts.  The fontina cheese is good with the combination.  Very easy and impresses everyone.

Quick and easy, but the chicken comes out dry.  My husband just loves it and would probably give it a higher rating, but I'll let him write his own review. :)

We loved this pizza!  I used a garlic and herb pizza crust from Trader Joe’s which was very good.  My fiancé wasn’t sure he’d like the pesto sauce on the pizza so I made half the pizza with regular pizza sauce and the other half with pesto.  He gave each side a fair try and decided the half with the pesto was the better pizza.  I didn’t have any artichoke hearts but I did add spinach and some pine nuts to the top of the pizza.  The taste was incredible.

I loved this pizza and yet it wasn't quite right.  With that said, I don't think this pizza was the problem but rather the pesto I used.  I want to get that stuff gone - it's a pesto I do love on pasta but a little too lemony for this pizza.  I plan to try this again exactly as it is with a home made pesto and I also want to try it substituting alfredo sauce for the pesto sauce.  I will definitely make it again, though.

I just used mozzarella and substituted mushrooms and tomatoes instead of artichokes.  This was a nice change from our normal pizza.  I made extra and brought it for a birthday potluck lunch and everyone loved it.

This was very good.  I didn't have artichoke hearts or fontina cheese so I used what I had.  I only gave it four stars for that reason.  I used green onion, yellow and orange bell pepper diced fine, mushrooms and some peppers, which I will leave off next time because they overpowered the pesto.  I used a mixture of Montery Jack and Mozerella, which I will use more of next time and sprinkled basil and tomato feta over it all.  I made the crust using Jay's Signature pizza.  This was one of the best pizzas I have ever made.

I absolutely loved this recipe, and so did all my friends I had over for dinner.  We added sliced red peppers on top to add a little extra flavor.  I also added more pesto than the recipe called for.  There were no leftovers this evening!

Really good!  Only 4 stars because I think this recipe is faulted without more toppings. We used: chicken, mushrooms, red onion, and tomato. Used with our favorite dough recipe from this site- Jay's pizza crust. Turned out super yummy!

What a brilliant idea to substitute the tomatosauce with pesto, I can now finally eat pizza (allergic to tomatoes). Thank you very much. It's a very easy recepy and you can change whatever you like, I used basic shredded dutch cheese, salami, bell pepper and pine-apple. It's not an ordinary combination, but it does show that this recepy gives you the freedom to do whatever you like.

I really love this recipe. It's a different kind of pizza as compared to tomato sauce and oregano and what not. It has a delicate taste and is quick and easy to make. I used shredded mozzarella.
Definitely a recipe I want to use again!

This looked and tasted fabulous!  I used refrigerated pizza dough, which I baked first, and then added the toppings.  Prepared just as the recipe stated except I used marinated artichoke hearts.  The pizza had such great flavor.  Everyone at my party loved it.  I can't wait to make it again!

Taste is good.  Easy to do.  I added kalamata olives, mushrooms, and pine nuts.  Next time I'll make my own pesto.

Great! I added crumbled goat cheese and mushrooms instead of artichokes.  Use a fresh pesto rather than out of a jar ( if possible).

awesome. i ended up using one of those prepackaged shredded cheese combos (mix of fontina, parmesean and mozarella) instead of just fontina cheese but it still was very tasty. this is a great dish for pesto-lovers.

One of the best pizzas we've had. Very easy to make, too. I used a Boboli crust, Perdue pre-cooked Short Cut Italian Flavored Chicken Breast Slices and substituted the artichokes with sliced tomatoes. We used Paul Newman's Marinara sauce for dipping, which added a lot of flavor.  By experimenting with different ingredients, this pizza has a lot of potential.

Awesome recipe!  The ingredients are wonderful together.  I don't like tomato sauce on my pizza, but I do love pesto, and it is perfect on top of pizza crust!  I highly recommend this pizza.

This was delicious! I changed the whole recipe! But it turned out RIDICULOUSly fantastic! Instead of crust, I used tortillas. Instead of pesto, I used pizza sauce. Instead of chicken, I used steak. Instead of artichoke, I used mushrooms. Instead of fontina, I used cheddar. And instead of 450degrees for 8-10 minutes, I did 425degrees for 10-12minutes. I rated THIS recipe 5 stars even though I changed things.

Fantastic, and worked well with vegetarian chick'n strips too.  Shred the chicken, don't dice it.  I made my own pesto and pizza dough, and grilled the chicken with some Tuscan seasoning.

It was great!  I added red onion. I'm not sure that artichoke is the best choice. I might try a substitute next time.

very good! I didn't have refrigerated pizza dough so I used bisquick (2 1/4 cup plus 2/3 cup water) and rolled it out to make a homemade pizza dough. I pre baked at 425 for 5 minutes then topped with ingredients. I added half of a 10 oz can of diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of artichokes and used moz cheese. baked 10 minutes at 450. I loved it!!

Copied for advice: "This was very good! I did make a few adjustments, however. I marinated my chicken in Italian dressing before cooking - it added a great flavor to the pizza and helped to keep the chicken moist. I omitted the artichokes, (husband dislikes them) and instead sliced up a few Roma tomatoes to put on top of the chicken - I sprinkled the tomatoes with fresh ground pepper and salt. I used mozzarella because it's what I had on hand. I also mixed in some of a 3 cheese blend I had left over (asiago, romano, and parmesan) it added a nice punch to the flavor of the cheese. I used a Boboli crust and Classico brand basil pesto - it was VERY tasty. I will definitely keep this recipe on hand!"

This is a great basic recipe. I made a few changes, however. I started with dough from scratch that I made in my bread machine. Then I added a layer of pesto, frozen (thawed) spinach, chopped chicken, chopped artichoke hearts, then a layer of bell peppers and onions. I sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top, and baked it at 425 for about 20 minutes. Delicious!

Simple and very tasty pizza. I made it without artichokes because I didn't have any the first time I made it, but now I do, so I will give it a try with the artichokes, but I have a feeling I'll like it even more.

I thought it was very salty.  My husband thought it was a great change from the usual "meat and potatoes" and regular pizza.  He'd like to see it added to the family recipe book, but I'm hesitant -- until I can modify it to tone down the saltiness.

this was a yummy one. I didn't know about the artichoke hearts at first but I don't think the pizza would of been the same w/o them. This is perfect for the kids to make and you to supervise as well.

I'm a big pesto lover, and this is so good! I used Quorn cutlets (substitute chicken) because I'm vegetarian, and mozzarella, because I'm too lazy to grate my own cheese. :) I made it with the Amazing Whole Wheat Pizza Crust recipe from this site, and it was a great combo. Will definitely make this again!

Very good.  I omitted the artichokes and used mushrooms instead.  I really liked the combination of pesto, crust, and cheese.  It will be fun to play around with it and see what else goes well with it.

Pretty to look at and certainly easy to prepare but I found the overall taste just a little above average. I would probably rate this closer to a 3.5. Added pine nuts.

Great quick recipe.  I used leftover rotissery chicken, pesto from a previous dinner and fresh pizza dough from the grocery store. This would be a great dinner to serve company.

Love this pizza. Easy enough for everyday, but fancy enough to feel like you are serving something special.

This was delicious and very easy to make.  I made extra chicken the night before and used the leftovers.  I also used Bisquick brand baking mix for the crust - I just made the biscuit recipe on the box and rolled it out thin.  One thing I will change though.  The store bought pesto sauce has raw garlic and it doesn't cook completely so it is a bit acidic, so next time I will use my homemade roasted garlic pesto.

Liked it, maybe a little greasy.  Was forced to make 2 8" pizzas so maybe i got the amounts wrong.  It had a good taste but I would try not loading it up with cheese so it would be less greasy.

Pretty good combination of flavors... a little bit too rich though.  We used fontina... I would use less pesto sauce next time.  We also added roma tomatoes, which was tasty.

This would also do great as a vegie pizza without the chicken and add tomatoes as others suggested.  Very easy and good.

Great recipe!  Very easy to assemble and bakes in no time.  I used shredded mozzarella and added some sun dried tomato and basil feta cheese as well as slices of roma tomatoes.

REALLY yummy recipe. Easy to make and very good (and good for you!). I added a bunch of garlic on the pizza right before I cooked it... very good! I also cooked the chicken in with some vegetable oil and garlic.. (can you tell I like garlic??)

Made it exactly after the recipe but I was disappointed. I don't think the artichoke and pesto sauce taste went very well together.

Delicious! I made the dough with another recipe I found on here (Jay's Signature Pizza Crust) and it was great. There was so much dough I made 2 pizzas. Even with making 2 pizzas I didn't use all of the artichoke. The pesto I used had macadamia nut in it but I couldn't really taste it. I used 1 cup of Mozzarella instead of the half cup on each pizza beacuse it was about to expire but the extra cheese was wonderful for my family that basically lives on cheese. The cool thing is that when it was cooked my husband and I couldn't tell the artichoke from the chicken. Loved this recipe, will be a regular in my house!

This is a great quick dinner.  You can keep the things at hand and anytime throw it together.  I loved the fact that it was different enough and added new tastes.

I used to make a version of this all the time. I forgot about it. Very easy and very versitile. Try Shrimp, black olives, etc. We make our own pesto, so its usually in the freezer, along with some fresh tomatoes... How can you go wrong?? I also use frozen bread dough for the crust. A loaf makes two crusts.

We all loved this pizza. I used a thin boboli crust and threw on some tomato and shrimp. Homemade pesto also made it quite flavorful.
