Using the exact recipe, the taste was wonderful- but it did not jell on the first attempt and that creates the emotionally painful opening, throwing away new lids, recooking everything down, etc.  That can be kind of expensive and certainly wastes a lot of time.  I tried next time with lemon juice and powdered pectin, which set it up wonderfully (use the 8 tsp of sugar-free pectin and 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of water, with 4 Tbsp of lemon juice if you must redo).

Great flavor but the raspberry definitely overpowered the peach which I found somewhat disappointing.  If I were to make it again I would definitely cut down on the raspberries and up the peaches.  The consistency was a little looser than I was expecting but still firm enough to not be soupy.

Delicious jam recipe! I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it turned out wonderful. If you want your peaches broke down more boil them separately for a while before adding the rest of the ingredients.

This is a BIG recipe. There's a lot of fruit and sugar so use a BIG pot! Also make sure you have plenty of jars, lids and rings ready. This recipe made 6 pints and 10 half-pints for me.
