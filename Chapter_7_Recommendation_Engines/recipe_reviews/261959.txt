1.3.18  Very happy with the way this turned out.  I followed this recipe to the letter with the exception of adding some fennel seeds (just something we always like in red  sauce).  Honestly, if I didn’t know differently, I would think this was made with ground beef instead of ground turkey, and this sauce breaks down really well nutritionally…love that!  I liked the chunky texture, so I didn’t bother to use the immersion blender to smooth it out.  Nothing to change here, this is delicious exactly as written.  And a big THANK YOU to wonderbread403  for submitting a recipe for 20 oz of ground turnkey, the way it’s always packaged (otherwise, what to do with the last 4 oz??).  Thanks for sharing your recipe, it’s a keeper.
