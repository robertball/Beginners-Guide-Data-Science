Being fairly new to eggplant and having tried a few different and diverse ways of preparing it, I'm beginning to think I just do not care for eggplant. That said, I struggled with whether to give this 3 or 4 stars. I decided on 3, but I lean towards 3.5. I made this pretty much as written, minor changes included using coconut oil instead of canola, and adding some chopped scallion and red pepper flakes to the stir fry pan at the mushroom adding stage. I served it over skinny rice noodles, very good way to serve. I used crimini mushrooms (sometimes known as baby bella) and would definitely NOT suggest using white/button mushrooms, although I'm a very timid/reluctant mushroom eater. I actually enjoyed the crimini mushrooms in this recipe quite a bit! I say if you like eggplant, DO give this recipe a try, and if you don't like eggplant, perhaps omit it and use some other veggies such as carrots, peppers, bamboo shoots, snap peas, etc.

This was a simple quick recipe we really enjoyed it.  The only problem was it was just a little dry.  But all in all a good recipe

We loved this recipe! It is quick and easy, and healthy. (I used coconut oil inplace of Canola)  Readers should be aware that when you first add a whole bag of spinach it looks like a mistake!  But it quickly cooks down and the dish looks beautiful.  My kids think they don't like eggplant, and turn their nose up at spinach.  But everyone loves this dish.

This is surprisingly tasty.  Just the soy sauce (I used Braggs Aminos) and ground black pepper.  Only added some red peppers as someone else suggested because I had some. Cooked chicken, mushrooms, peppers and garlic together. Browning the eggplant in a separate skillet is key. Then all together with the spinach...yum!  Definitely use coconut or olive oil...never, never canola!

Exceptionally easy and good! I didn't have any spinach, so that was left out, but considering how few spices and "additional ingredients" are added the taste is extraordinary! Definitely rates as a winner and a keeper!

Here's what I did;
Stir-fry the chicken, then mushrooms in the hot oil until brown, then add the garlic for 1 minute then add the liquid which was 2T soy, 2T Mirin, 2T water into which I had stirred 1t of cornstarch. I stir-fried the eggplant in 2T of coconut oil until browning, then added it to the chicken/mushroom mix, stir, lower the heat and covered for 5 minutes. Then did the spinach for the last minute or 2. It came out great with a nice sauce for the plain white rice.

This was very good. I did do some changes, due to not having all the ingredients.  Added onion, red peppers, and changed out the mushrooms with garbanzo beans, for added fiber and protein.  
Hubby loved it.

This was tasty. I added more soy sauce and some dry white wine to the wok. Make sure to thoroughly cook the eggplant on the separate pan before adding it to the stir fry.

Initially I rated this recipe 3. I rated this recipe a 4 because it was average, yet an excellent dinner because it can be a keto recipe by replacing the soy sauce with coconut aminos.  Furthermore,  I doubled the coconut amino for a juicer dish. The next day I topped the leftovers with siracha and though it was really good.

It was easy and very delicious.  I used broccoli flowerets. instead of the spinach and I added a little whine wine to the chicken.   I served it with cauliflower fried rice.  So it was a veggie and protein meal.

Love, love this recipe! It's my favorite go-to recipe for fast, easy, healthy, and delicious. Who could have guessed that my whole family (including grandkids) would love eggplant! And SPINACH! I usually take liberties with new recipes; I am creative and adventurous and confident. But I like this one just as it is... I didn't change a thing. (Except the instructions a little.) BTW, that photo in no way resembles the final product. Mine, anyway. (Mine looks prettier.)  Thanks for this recipe!!!

The combination of eggplant ,mushrooms and spinach is not a common one but this was delicious. Great way to fix eggplant without adding tons of calories. A definite keeper..

This is a great simple and delicious recipe.  I added vidalia onions and a little brown sugar and allspice to the soy sauce.  I also sprinkled a bit of red crushed pepper.  (I like it spicy).  It came out great!  Did not have any portobello mushrooms on hand, so I used regular mushrooms.  Did not seem to affect the dish.  I highly recommend this tasty, easy to make dish.

I enjoyed the recipe but wish there was more of a sauce to it. I would recommend pouring some soy sauce over the eggplant while it fries and before adding them into the chicken mixture, otherwise they're a little bland.

This was a delightful combination, but I did make some changes. I used boneless, skinless thighs because they have more flavor and moisture and pair better with the eggplant.  Make sure you sweat the eggplant first, while the chicken is marinating. I marinated the chicken in soy sauce, fish sauce, and some sesame oil for about 15-20 minutes before cooking.  I cooked the chicken with a sliced onion and then added the mushrooms, followed by the eggplant once the mushrooms released their juices.  I used portobello mushrooms and since I did not have spinach, I used swiss chard. I made it a second time and used baby zucchini. Any green vegetable works well. A bit of red pepper helps if you like some spice.

Made it as specified. Ended up being a little too salty. probably need to rinse the eggplant before it's cubed and use less soy sauce.

What a lovely recipe! I just so happened to have all the ingredients while looking for an easy meal. I did add a tablespoon or two of hoisin sauce and a tiny bit of ginger, to add a little bit of depth.....then served it over homemade fried rice. My husband said this was restaurant quality. Thank you for this recipe!

Really Good!!  I love eggplant, so I used the whole large eggplant for this recipe.  I cooked the chicken with cooking spray, salt, pepper, minced garlic & soy to brown/sear it (couple min per side), and then added the mushrooms AND maybe ~ a cup of chicken broth - let it simmer, covered on med-low for about 15 min.  At minute 12, I added the spinach and cooked eggplant & re-covered the pan for the last 3 min.  (I cubed the eggplant & cooked it in the canola, added minced garlic & soy as it cooked on Med/Med-low ~5-7 min) Turned out fantastic!!  Served over rice.  I will make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I love eggplant and I am always looking for new ways to prepare it. I made changes to recipe to accommodate what was in my frig. My chicken was leftover from a whole chicken and shredded and I used kale instead of spinach. It was great and I am adding it my favorites.

Added more veggies and Japanese mirin to the sauce (thicken sauce with corn starch or potato starch)
