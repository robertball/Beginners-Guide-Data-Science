My husband really doesn't care for zucchini or ground turkey but he  liked these.  He said they weren't over the top great but he did eat it all.  The patties tried to crack and fall apart on the grill, so pan frying might have been a better method. Served on a whole wheat bun & a side of coleslaw.

This recipe does nothing to the original except add some grated zucchini. I could make this recipe just as healthy by topping the burgers with some pickles and lettuce.

I tried this recipe out very sceptibly and was pleasantly surprised.  This very healthy turkey burger is full of flavour.  I also added a 1/4 cup of hot sauce.  Yum!

Oh my goodness! I am so happy I tried this recipe. You think " turkey burgers " dry, bland- NOT these turkey burgers! They were moist and tasty and noone had to feel guilty about eating a burger! My husband, his aunt muself and our 2 children (ages 2&4) ate the heck out of these burgers and loved it so much we decided that next time I must make much more and freeze them. Thank you for turning something boring into something totally delectable! Mmmmmmmmmm!

I found these to be pretty tasty - but I upped the healthy factor by subbing old fashioned oats for the bread crumbs. My only complaint is they were pretty crumbly and some of them ended up more as meat chunks than burger patties.

these were pretty tasty.. i cut this in half and omitted the bread crumbs and egg white.. i used 1 T of dried onion flake for the fresh and dried parsley for the fresh as well.. i tripled the salt.. added 1/2 tsp of italian seasoning and red pepper flakes.. i think i could have used a little more zucchini or maybe some shredded carrot.. either way it was good.. ty for the recipe

We made these this evening - I loved them!  Hubby said the only improvement he would have made was to add a little more garlic

We LOVED this recipe just exactly the way it is written except that we put them on the gas grill! Awesome! Thanks!
