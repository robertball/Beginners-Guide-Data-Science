This recipe was really easy and the taste was absolutely divine!!  Very rich and chocolately; smooth as silk.  Big hit at my party.

This was one of the most incredible desserts I have ever tasted. It took me about 45 minutes to make, and the chocolate heart topper was easy enough to make freehand. If you put it in a wineglass of some sort, it makes it have that elegant gourmet look. Like I said, this recipe is wonderful, but it's truly all about presentation.

This turned out O.K. but it just didn't make me want to eat that much of it. I think I have had better. Would probably rate this closer to a 3.5.

this was so sweet and rich it was like eating a can of frosting, but was alot of work.  my guests and i did not finish this dessert, and in fact, could only eat a few bites.  it was dense and fudgy, not airy and mousse-like.  i'll try another recipe next ime because this did not make the grade.
