This was really good! I added about a half teaspoon each of paprika and dry mustard, and mixed more grated cheese into the ritz crumbles. Yum!

ok me and my fiance loooove macaroni and cheese. we have tried tons of macaroni and cheese recipes.. but this by farrrrr was our favorite! DELICIOUS! well it also helps that extra sharp cheddar is our favorite cheese and we always have a brick of it in our fridge.  EXCELLENT! nice and creamy and the topping was amazing! i used the other reviewers advice and added parmesian to the topping and i also used garlic croutons instead of ritz crackers.  THE BEST!

I don't normally try a recipe off this site unless it gets at least 4 1/2 stars from 100 people or more, but I was looking for a recipe that called for simple ingredients that I already had, and this one fit the bill.  So I gave it a try, and it was really very good.  The only change I made was that I didn't add the cracker crumb topping.  I sprinkled extra cheese on top before baking.  Everyone in my family loved it, and it was even better the next day!  * I will add that the butter/flour/milk/cheese mixture never did thicken on top of the stove, but it firmed up nicely while baking.

This recipe was pretty good. I topped it with seasoned breadcrumbs instead of crackers, and grated parmesan cheese before baking. Everyone enjoyed it. For more flavor, I will incorporate different cheeses next time, and maybe a spot of garlic to warm the flavor. But nonetheless it was creamy and yummy.

My family loved this.  A few notes - use a pound of sharp cheddar.  It makes a BIG difference.  Other cheddars may leave you with a bland dish.   Also, I had to use cavatelli (it's what I had) but measuring that by cup left me with too few noodles floating in a sea of sauce.  I had to cook more pasta and add it to the pan.   I ended up using 12 oz. of cavatelli. I added 3 cloves minced garlic and a few shakes of cayenne to my roux, cooking for a minute or two without letting it brown, then gradually poured in warm milk and whisked it.  It comes together quickly and smoothly.  Cold milk straight from the fridge will take longer to "sauce up".   2% milk is fine.  Mine actually baked up and browned in less than 45 minutes so watch your oven.  When the top is brown and it doesn't "jiggle" too much, pull it out.   Thank you for sharing your recipe, Jody!

Phenominal!!!!! I can hardly believe I was able to cook something and have it turn out this yummy! It took a little while but was fun and totally worth the wait! 

 I am 17 and wanted to treat myself to something nice as well as make something my parent's (who are vegetarians) could come home to after work. I can't wait to see their reactions!


Throughout the process I added a few things such as :

Sharp Chedder AND Extra Sharp white cheddar
Garlic & Onion powders
LOTS of pepper
A lot of salt ha
and the best part:

I mixed in a splash of hot sauce and you would not believe how much it made the flavor really pop! 

Anyway, AWESOME RECIPE! 5 STARS.

Didn't like this at all and I love mac and cheese. Needs more flavor or something to give it a kick. Will keep looking for a better homemade mac and cheese recipe.

I made this for dinner tonight for myself, my boyfriend and my 7 year old. We're all big food lovers, and none of us can resist a good homemade mac n'cheese. Sadly, I misplaced my usual recipe and thought Id give this one a try. Won't be doing that again. First, as I was making it, I thought that 4 cups of milk seemed a bit much. But I continued on. I made the cheese sauce the way I do a gravy, starting with butter and flour, then slowly adding the milk. It didnt thicken much, due to the amount of milk. So I decided to add the cheese and see if it helped. This is when I first realized that it takes TWO whole bags of shredded cheese! I kept going, since id already used 4 cups of milk. It did thicken, obviously, but when I poured it on to the macaroni, there was sooo much sauce that the pasta was practically swimming! I added some ham and peas, then topped with breadcrumbs and put in the oven. After 45 minutes, I took it out, but it was still a bit runny and not at all browned. I left it in for another 15 minutes then decided it was as good as it was gonna get. It did thicken in the oven, but it was too saucy to brown. The general consenses was that it was edible, but not that great. The texture was... broken up? Almost grainy. I definitely will not be making this again.

Made this recipe exactly as it's written, with the exception of adding parsley and paprika on the top for color. It was delicious and flavorful! I used sharp cheddar, which I think is key to creating a flavorful mac & cheese. When making the cheese sauce, I did combine the butter and flour first to create a rue, then added the milk and cheese.

Great recipe! I overcooked the macaroni but it still turned out tasting great. I ended up using half cheddar cheese and half pepper jack, it added a nice kick! Will definitely be making this again.

My wife made this recipe and we did NOT care for it.  The sauce was broken or grainy.  I'm not sure if it was the type of cheese or what, but it was NOT creamy and smooth like her normal Kraft cheese recipe is.

DELICIOUS! I add about 3-3 1/2 cups noodles as without it the macaroni and cheese is very very runny. I like mine a little more dense. 

Family favorite and a staple in our home!

We loved this!  I made a half batch, just to be sure we'd like it.  I added a dash of pepper, paprika, and dry mustard.  I thought it looked a little too saucy, so I made a little more pasta to put in.  I like macaroni that isn't too liquidy. I used parmesan breadcrumbs instead of crackers.  It was so good! (4 cups of shredded cheese = 1 lb)

my family loved this recipe!  as another reviewer remarked, don't add the butter, flour, cheese and milk all at once.  make a roux by melting the butter first, then whisking in the flour, keeping it moving for about a minute.  then slowly add in the milk, whisking all the while.  only then should you add the cheese (and more milk if needed) and then finally the noodles.  i also added a bit of onion powder and paprika for a boost of flavor.  a great comfort-food main dish!

Made this as a last minute dinner (after watching The Chew that was all about different ways to make mac n cheese).  It was so good!  Even my husband who is not fond of things without meat in them really like it!  It was nice and creamy and full of flavor.  I only made a couple changes, used garlic salt because I put garlic salt on everything!  Had to add a chunk of Velveeta because I didn't have enough cheddar.  Only used half a sleeve of crackers because it seemed like too much, but next time I will do the whole thing....yummy!

Good recipe. My mac n cheese never came out good until I used this recipe. I used 1/2 pound cheddar/jack mix and 1/2 pound Velveeta. Delish.

I made this because I had all the ingredients on hand and it seemed like it would be fast. It was fast and the consistency was nice. However, it was like eating plain noodles. It had next to no flavor. My husband comes from a family that never liked spicy food & everything was kind of "blah" and even he found this "blah". I even added ground mustard because lots of mac and cheese recipes call for it to add flavor. Didn't help. Maybe next time I'll add a can of cheddar cheese soup, saute some onion and see what that does. This was disappointing. Won't use it as-is again, which is a shame because it was easy.

Not impressed with this recipe at all! Very bland, not the creamy texture I was looking for. I did not add the crumbs on top but I don't think it would have helped at all. I will keep looking for the perfect mac and cheese.

Added pepper and paprika.  I also sliced some cooked sausage and added it on top, in order to make it a main dish.  My husband raved!!!

WOW!!! this was the best mac n cheese i have ever had!!! i made it for christmas dinner. everyone loved it! the crackers and butter on top are a great addition. i also threw in some other cheeses that i had in the fridge like mozarella and colby. i used sharp cheddar instead of regular cheddar also. it took a while for the cheese sauce to blend, but patience and low heat were the way to go.

This is good! I added 1/4 tsp mustard powder and 1/4 tsp paprika to give it a little more flavor and color. I will only add the topping to half of it next time since it gets soggy and undesireable on the leftovers. Great job!

Very good.  I don't put the crackers on top.  I also add just a pinch of dried mustard.  Kid friendly for sure and freezes well.

I thought this tasted pretty good; I used cheddar and jack so it came out light looking, especially with all the milk.  I added a dash of garlic powder too.  Instead of bread crumbs on top I shredded some string cheese.  :)

I was so happy to find this simple recipe. I was looking for something to use ingredients I had in my house and use up all the extra cheese hanging around. I left the salt out, because I thought it would be salty enough with the salt in the cheese. However, I definitely will add it next time. I think I will use cheese on top next time either shredded cheddar or grated parmesan. A great easy recipe with simple ingredients.

Was looking for this recipe, so excited when I found it. Awesome, traditional style recipe!  I recommend using croutons as some other suggested, and try using "ditali" style pasta instead of elbows.  Cheers

This recipe was amazing! My family loved it. Once I drained the pasta, I did add two Tbls. butter and 1/2 tsp pepper to the noodles before mixing in the cheese mixture. The cheese mixture thickened beautifully. I melted the butter first, then added the flour, then the milk, then slowly added the cheese and whisked together. I also added 1/2 tsp paprika as I was whisking. It tasted awesome before I even baked it. I will definitely be making this again.

Mmmmmmmmmmmm!  This was a SUPER terrific dinner!  I also made a roux to make the cheese sauce as well, and it thickened nicely in the oven.  BUT instead of all Ritz crackers, I used part crushed Stacy's garlic parmesan pita chips and it was really flavorful!

Very good! Was looking for a satisfying match to go with surf and turf. I made the recipe for 4 servings, but the 4 could easily serve 8. We will enjoy the leftovers!!!

I also added a dash of chipotle pepper and dry mustard.

I absoloutely LOVED this recipe. It seemed a bit soupy before the baking. However, when I pulled it out of the oven I found that it was nice and firm. I served this to my family and everyone agreed. This is delicious. It's the ideal comfort food and the butter cracker topping is yummy. I'll be making it again for sure!

I did not care for this mac n cheese at all, and neither did my husband.   I prefer a creamier macaroni and cheese; I like using meunster or gorgonzola, in my recipes to kick up the flavor and add more of a "creamy cheesy" aspect.  The texture of my dish was grainy. The flavor was also a bland.  I added a little more salt, pepper, and a pinch of cayenne just to kick it up a notch.  Furthermore, I had to broil mine for about two minutes in order to get a nice crisp top.

The macaroni was very bland and tasteless. It didn't have much flavor or anything. I also tried to double the recipe and I was constantly critiquing every ingredient. I would not recommend this.

It was basically soup when I poured it into the baking dish.  It did thicken up during the cooking, so I was pleased.  It had kind of a mealy texture, and I think it would have been pretty flavorless if I hadn't added a shake each of garlic powder, onion powder and dried mustard.  It tasted okay, so I am giving it three stars.  I am going to keep looking for a recipe I really like, though, and I will not make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I added some keilbasa.  My toddler gobbled it up, but my husband and I didn't really care for the flavor of the sauce. If I hadn't added the keilbasa, it would not have been edible, it would have been flavorless.  It needs some spices:  onion powder, garlic powder, ground mustard, and I think it needs more cheese in the sauce.

So tasty! I served this to guests as a side at a barbecue and was asked for my recipe/ I always follow a recipe the first time and then add my own fixin's after that. I found it a little dry for my taste, but all in all a wonderful base to build on. Definitely gets thumbs up.

This is delicious!  It was very creamy and the Ritz crackers added a nice touch.  When I was making it I realized I only had 8 ounces of cheddar cheese so I had to make a couple substitutions.  I added 4 ounces of brick cheese and 4 ounces of sharp cheddar.  It was yummy!

This was so rich and cheesy, it was an immediate fave for my fuss-pot fiance (who had insisted that he didn't like homemade mac and cheese) and his parents.  It was so easy to follow that it came out perfectly, even as a first-ever attempt at homemade mac and cheese.  I added a bit of onion and garlic powders to it for a little bit of added flavour, and it was simply to die for!

I normally don't do reviews on here, but I HAD to say something about this recipe... it just didn't do it for me. The overall texture was weird and dry, and it just tasted blah. I do not recommend.

The kids ate it and that was a plus.  i didnt like it. maybe I did something wrong  but it seemed as if I could taste the the flour as a grain like taste.   Not bad but not a keeper.

This macc & cheese is going, going, going fast. I knew it would so I made a generous 2nd (though smaller) casserole worth which got obliterated practically right out of the oven. I had mine with Italian Style Pork Chops... sooo good!

Great for a quick baked mac and cheese! We did make some changes: split the 1 lb of cheese between cheddar, colby, and monterrey jack.  Also used parmesan on top instead of crackers.

I love this recipe although I tweaked it a bit, I used Velveeta for half the cheese to make it more creamy, and I added a teaspoon of dry mustard. other than that it was great!

I loved this! I used a mixture of cheddar and pepper jack which I feel gave it just the right amount of kick. Also I topped it with panko instead of the crackers mainly because I didnt have any, but also I prefer panko because it adds a nice crunch. My ONLY complaint about this was it had a grainy texture and I would have prefered a creamier texture. Not sure how to fix that, maybe next time I will bake this in a deeper yet smaller dish. The one I used was VERY large and that may have contributed to the grainy dry texture. I will be making this one again, maybe will experiment a little to find a better texture.

This is exactly how I've always made mac & cheese.  I add a little mustard powder & some poultry seasoning to the cheese for a little more flavor & sprinkle stuffing mix (Bell's) on top for flavor & crunch.  Mmmm...

A great basic recipie with things I pretty much always have on hand.  Plain enough for my young kids to devour it down, but cheesy and butter enough to please me and my husband.  I might make it again and add in Broccoli or Bacon....or BOTH

Thanks for sharing a great recipe! I made this for a crowd and was worried about it drying out, even if I covered it, so I doubled the sauce and it came out great! It was a hit! I did add some garlic, onion powder and dry mustard for a little more flavor.

I've made many different types of Mac & Cheese, this was not my favorite.  I ended up adding in colby cheese and pepper jack for some flavor. Still ended up kinda of bland, will stick to my own Mac & Cheese next time!

My family loves mac and cheese and i thought i would try a new recipe. We found the finished product to be very floury. I made the roux and cooked the flour and butter the same amount of time that i usally do but you could still taste the flour. Also i added some other spices to it. We have had better.

Followed the recipe all the way; cooked the cheese, milk, flour, etc for over an hour and it was still very "watery". The end product soupy mac and cheese!

I save certain recipes that I think will work for a potluck, especially ones where I know there will not be much "pasta/meat" dishes. I made this today for a gathering and followed the basics as well as recommendations from reviews.  I baked it partially in a crock pot bowl, took it to the potluck and finished it in the crock pot.  I had so many compliments.  The only thing I changed was no panko or bread crumbs on top and I added a little extra cheese (gouda and about 1.5 oz. of blue cheese).  This will definitely be a keeper for family gatherings and good 'ole Mac & Cheese cravings.

I make this all the time for parties and it's always a staple. So many people ask me to bring this! It's so simple, rich, and delicious. The only thing I do differently is use the entire 16 oz box of large elbow macaroni, it fills a 9x13 perfectly and isn't too dry. Also totally recommend adding some grated parmesan to the breadcrumbs! You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Will definitely make it again, and already have three times.  I added fontina cheese with the cheddar cheese.  It made it extra rich and gooey.  Equal parts of both.  Thanks again.

Good and easy! I also started with a roux adding finely chopped onions.  I added a little Dijon mustard to the sauce. My son was home from college eating 3 huge helpings. Success!

I'm 13 years old and made this for me and my friend for dinner. I took a pie dish (with crust already in it) and poured the mac and cheese n there. I then sprinkled extra shredded cheese on top. Then to resemble a top crust, I bacon weaved on the top. If you don't use bacon, I would have to say that crushed up garlic croutons (or any croutons) work amazing as a topping.

I used croutons instead of crackers. I added Parmesan cheese to top. I added chopped broccoli and dried nettle for some vitamins. Easy and great.   I made a roux before adding cheese and other ingredients to the sauce.

It is so easy to make and taste awesome! I had to make a quick mac and cheese last min and found this one. I prepared everything and then threw it in the fridge for two hours before taking it to a friends house to cook for a pot luck dinner and it turned out great!! I know some people said that theirs was a little runny, the fridge might have helped it a little because mine wasn't runny at all and I went straight by the recipe. It's now going in my favorites :)

Within the first two bites, hubby declared that this hot, creamy fare be put on his special "Football Season Approved Eats" list! It was yummy and devoured in no time at all!  This is a great base recipe that you can build on, depending on your taste preferences. I made a few changes in the sauce: I made a roux first (as other reviewers commented), added sharp cheddar slowly, mixed in a splash of hot sauce and a pinch of garlic (not regular) salt.  Changes in the topping: I added 1/4 t. dried, ground mustard, a dash of paprika, a little black pepper and a splash of hot sauce. It was smooth, velvety and delicious- and NO one noticed I had added hot sauce - it just boosted the flavor a little. We'll be sharing this dish (and recipe) throughout the 2014 NFL season with friends & neighbors.  Thanks, Jody!

This was a good Baked Mac and Cheese Recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, but found it wasn't  as cheesy as I had hoped. I should have slowly added the cheese instead of throwing it all in a pot like the recipe said. Also, I used Ritz for my crushed crackers, which was a nice touch. I will definitely try this again sometime!

This is so delicious! I did make a few changes, I used 3 cups of milk and one cup of whipping cream. For the topping I used roasted vegetable ritz crackers which added great taste!

This recipe is very good. We used old fort/sharp cheddar and it was quite tasty. There was something missing though and I can't seem to put my finger on it. We don't use the processed american cheese so this recipe for Mac and Cheese was sure worth a try. For a hungry family it did the trick.

Loved this recipe and it was so easy to prepare. I did change some of the ingredients by using 1 onion chopped small and 3 small garlic cloves minced cooked in the 1/4 cup butter then added flour and other ingredients with 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard added. Also substituted 1 cup of heavy cream for one cup of milk. Was very yummy. This will be in my recipe box.

This was really good! I ended up using a 16 oz box of noodles and added 4oz of cream cheese because I like my mac and cheese creamier. Next time I may use 8oz of cream cheese and all sharp cheddar. It was a hit for the family dinner. I will make it again for sure!

It has the creaminess we're looking for but not the flavor. We'll keep looking.

A lot of times mac-and-cheese can come out bland so I was a bit hesitant to try this version. However, with the tips that the reviewers gave I found that with minor alterations this recipe can come out really good! First of all, I like to alter recipes to make them easy, and quick (with little mess). This recipe would probably taste awesome with fresh grated cheese, but I don't have the patience for that so I bought the bagged shredded cheese, and it was fine! I bought 1- 7oz bag of SHARP cheddar, and 1-8oz bag of "Mac & Cheese Mix" which was American and Swiss. I was short an ounce, so I added 1/4 cup parmesan that I already had at home. I made a roux, added the milk & cheese and some Lawry's salt. The mixture seemed soupy so I was a bit worried, but it baked fine, and it wasn't runny after it baked. I also bought a bag of garlic croutons (as suggested by another reviewer), crushed the whole bag, and added this on top instead of the crackers... best idea ever!!

It was the best I've had; my husband loved it! I did add a little dry mustard and cayenne pepper. I used crushed croutons for crumb topping and sprinkled just a little cheese with it which crisped up with the crumbs and was delicious!

My younger sister is very picky about what she eats, but she said she wanted "cheesey noodles with the crunchy stuff on top". This recipe is AMAZING!! She even went back for seconds and wouldn't eat anything else but the macaroni. Making this again for sure!

It is so easy and the best tasting mac and cheese I've ever had.  Since I had leftover ham from Christmas I added small chunks to this dish and it was a hit.  Thanks for sharing Jody!

I have never before made mac and cheese and I was hosting a pasta party for 25 field hockey players.  I took a chance and just followed this recipe (after reading the reviews and helpful hints) and just quadrupled the amounts.  I also tweaked it by adding dry mustard, onion and garlic powder and used panko bread crumbs instead of crackers.  The girls all LOVED it and couldn't say enough so thank you, thank you, thank you, for your awesome recipe!!

This is a wonderful base recipe, which EASILY replaced Alton Brown's in my recipe book. Made as written the first time and my rating is on that basis. Second time I made it using sharp cheddar,  and added 1/2 tsp paprika, 3 dashes of Red Hot Sauce, and some black pepper to the white sauce mixture. Didn't add the melted butter to the crackers, either and it was still a much better topping than bread crumbs.

Best mac and cheese recipe I've found so far! I usually use sharp cheddar cheese for some extra flavor.  I also cut down on the amount of crackers in the topping and sub in some bread crumbs as I found it a little too buttery.  Definitely a keeper!

Mighty fine.  be sure to use a sharp cheddar.  milder cheeses leave this dish lacking flavor.  I added onion, garlic, cumin, black pepper, a dash of hot sauce and chili powder.  Also, I ended up with a lot of sauce, so I cooked up some more mac to throw in before baking...

I made the recipe as written, used a whisk with the butter, flour, milk, cheese mixture (just added it all together and whisked it until thickened), then added about a tsp of mustard powder, paprika and garlic powder, a pinch of ground cayenne red pepper and extra salt and pepper.  (Taste the sauce before you add the noodles and add more of desired listed seasonings to taste.) I skipped the crackers/melted butter and used a sprinkling of cheddar on the top, and put it in a 400 degree oven until melted.  It was tasty and was especially great served with fresh steamed green beans.   Thanks!

Best mac and cheese I've ever made. I cooked the butter and flour together, than added milk, right before it boiled I added the cheese. I also used regular bread crumbs insted of crackers. I used an awsome applewood smoked cheddar that my 9 year old loves, and she ate it all and asked for more! I put left-overs that I didn't bake in the freezer and it was awsome 2 weeks later! Thanks

Definitely a good start-out recipe. I added a couple of things based on others suggestions. And my one year old even liked it! Thank you :)

Loved this recipe! Turned out incredibly good. I used sharp cheddar though and added a little colby and jack cheese. My kids complained it was too rich I also doubled the amount of salt and added pepper and it tasted fabulous!

I used way more cheese than the recipe called for (cheddar & muenster) but it still came out floury tasting. Mine also didn't really thicken until baking.

Very good macaroni!  As was done in one of the other reviews I mixed in more grated cheese with the crackers and butter and put that on top.  Very yummy!

I made this for Thanksgiving. However (somehow) I accidentily added pimentos( I was cooking multiple things at one time and slipped up :)). It ended up being the perfect finish to it, adding color and a little kick! I recommend the pimentos : )

This is my first baked macaroni and cheese attempt. My mom used to make it all the time when I was a kid but I’ve never made it and my children are straight up teenagers now. I did a mix of pepper jack and sharp cheddar cheese, I added  a tablespoon of Dijon mustard and a couple sprinkles of onion powder. For the topping I did a combination of Ritz crackers and Cheeze Its . It was delicious and I’ll definitely be making it again.

It’s a great basic recipe. I tweaked it a little. I used 8 Oz cheddar and 8oz whipped cream cheese with scallions and chives. I also used pandora breadcrumbs instead of crackers.  It was crunchy and delicious. I will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe.  I did make the changes to it. The first change was I split the cheese between cheddar and mozzarella.  Mozzarella just makes her a really creamy sauce.  Every second thing I did was add crumbled bacon to it.   Because bacon makes everything better.  Gold rounds were a great idea.  I made this for a Thanksgiving side and it disappeared.

I just made this tonight, we had company over.  Everyone had second helpings, and a few had third helpings!  I've made many mac and cheese recipes, this is by far the best.  I followed it exactly, except for adding maybe a quarter cup or so of extra grated cheddar to the topping.

I made this for the first time today and it was delish! I did make a few changes though... I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of the crackers, and I crumbled cooked bacon on top before I put it in the oven. What a crowd pleaser! Will definitely be making this again!

I used the basic recipe but added an onion and I used gruyere and havarti  cheese instead. It turned out very well. Sprinkle bread crumbs on top so they can toast and add crispness.

I made this recipe as directed. However, next time when whisking the flour butter salt mixture I will use a small saucepan and then transfer it to the larger one before adding milk.  A big hit with kids and adults alike!

I used 3/4 heavy cream, and extra sharp cheddar.  This was soo rich and creamy, it was delicious!

Used bread crumbs instead of crackers and would try different seasonings next time.  Texture and creaminess good! Just a bit too blah for me as is.

This came out great and was a big hit especially the topping. I doubled the recipe and the only change I made was that I used 1 pound Velveeta + 1/2 pound Colby Jack and 1/2 pound cheddar.
That made enough to serve 10 to 12 easily

Turned out great! I was worried it was too soupy when it went into the oven but it thickened up from baking. I added a layer of cheddar cheese slices to the top, baked for about 10 minutes and then added the crushed crackers. It was a hit.

Easy to make with just a few ingredients!  It was awesome!  My family loved it.  Instead of using crackers which I did not have I used panko bread crumbs and added a little parmesan cheese (and a little paprika for color) mixed with the melted butter for the topping.  It turned out great!

I made this for a family reunion. I had NO clue how to scale this to fit two 17x12 pans. I did a test run last night to see how the recipe would turn out and it was devoured!!! I forgot to take a pic last night but took one in the large pan. I did half cheddar and half sharp cheddar. Everything else I kept the same. It was very creamy last night. It probably would’ve set if I had it in the fridge overnight.

First and foremost I have to say I absolutely dislike Mac n’ Cheese due to childhood memories. However because my husband loves it i had to search for an easy but delicious Mac n cheese recipe. I came across this recipe  and WOW the smell just made me take a bite and I have to say the flavor was great. I followed the recipe to the T, I only added 1/2 cup less of milk due to other reviewers saying it was watery. The crunchiness of the buttery crackers made it all come together!

Solid homemade mac and cheese recipe like Grandma used to make. My family uses saltines instead of ritz. I also prefer to mix the crackers with the pasta then dump into my baking dish. When the cheese mixture is ready, pour over the pasta and top  with extra cheese.

Followed the recipe exactly except used Ritz Roasted Vegetable flavored crackers instead of the original ones - added extra flavor to the dish.  Yummm!

I made this for a group of friends for the first time.  They loved it!  The only thing I changed was the topping-  I just added a little melted butter & bread crumbs.  I'm making it next week for a party.

so I changed it up a bit. I used old cheddar as well as an Italian mix of cheese. I also used 2% milk and couple of shakes of dry mustard and ground pepper.  All looked well when I put it in the casserole dish. I used toppables for the topping as well as sprinkled more cheeses on top. Tastes very good but unfortunately it did get grainy after baking. But I will over look that cause it does taste yummy.

Good base recipe: similar to one my mom made in my childhood. Will probably add more cheese to the cheese sauce next time. Also can use more seasoning than what is recommended

Great recipe, I added about 1/4 of cooked bacon, a can of sweet peas and used rotini  instead of elbows. I put 3 cups of cheddar cheese instead of 1 cup because i wanted it more cheesy and i topped it with a butter/panko mix with Italian bread crumbs as a topping. Came out really good, thank you for a great base for me to build upon my recipes.

I combined a lot of advice from previous comments and the whole things turned out great!! I added More Spice (instead of paprika because I didn’t have it), onion powder and chopped garlic to the milk/flour/butter mixture before adding in the cheese. I also added an extra handful of the shredded cheese to make it a bit thicker. Definitely want to stir to a roux for best consistency (unless you really want it a bit runnier). I substituted the cheddar for one bag of sharp cheddar and one bag of the Mac and cheese blend cheese. For the topping I substituted Panko bread crumbs (seasoned) and crumbled Parmesan cheese. I still pour led the 1/4 cup melted butter on top. Overall it turned out really well and was a big hit.

This was the best Mac and Cheese I have ever made.  I use a different version on a regular basis and decided to change it up and so glad I did.  My other recipe doesn't call for crumble on top and that was the one thing my family did not care for so next time I will make it without  it just because they are not use to it.

I loved it. I did add pepper, cayenne pepper and paprika and a little extra salt once mixed together. I used a little more butter on the crackers and extra cheese on top. It was moist and tastes great. I cooked it with baked bbq ribs, potato salad, green beans and croissant rolls for a Sunday dinner! You cant go wrong with this one! #awesome

Kids said it had a slightly grainy taste, probably because I didn't let the roux completely work itself out and they could taste the texture of the flour. Otherwise, really good recipe!

I’ve made this 3 or 4 times now. Always pretty good and for the teenagers i can’t go wrong with home made Mac n cheese!  I usually use bread crumbs on top since we always have them on hand and they are cheaper and healthier than ritz crackers. This time i added sliced tomatoes and cajon seasoning and a little Parmesan on top. The cajon seasoning really added flavor without being too spicy. Thanks for the recipe!!

This is the best I have come across! I compare everything to Stouffers frozen Mac & Cheese, we love that stuff. 
I used 2% milk and extra sharp cheddar cheese.  I might have gone just a tad over and the amount of uncooked macaroni but not much.  Followed the directions. I did throw  a shake of garlic powder and pinch of red pepper in the sauce as I was making it. Don't know if it mattered.  What I didn't do was muck it up with a topping.  I just sprinkled with garlic and Hungarian paprika. That's it. Came out perfect, served it for a girlie summer party at my house, it did great!

I used a full box of elbows and doubled the rest of the recipe. (I can never quite figure out recipes that call for pasta to be measured by the cup.)  The doubled recipe made more than enough to bring as a side dish to large get-together, and fit perfectly in a large deep casserole dish (I think mine is 4 quarts.)   I used a mix of mild and sharp cheddar and it was too mild for me.  Next time will use all sharp.   The mixture looks runny when you first combine pasta and cheese sauce,  but thickens up in the oven. The topping is "the bomb" according to my teenage son.   Very quick and easy recipe.

This is a review of the recipe as is with no changes. Unlike most reviewers here I made this mac n’ cheese per the recipe and it is delicious. You don’t have to change it or add anything special to enjoy this wonderful Mac n’ cheese.

I like this recipe, but it needs a lot more seasoning. I put a little bit of paprika and pepper before it was went into the oven, but it needs more. I also used sharp cheddar. Make sure when you add the milk you do it slowly so you have time to really mix it in with the mixture. Keep whisking. It will eventually thicken up nicely. For the topping I used ground of croutons insteads and just a few crackers and that part is amazing. 45 minutes was the perfect amount of time. It was nice and browned on top, but any longer and the edges would have been burnt. I think this would also be good if you put the cracker crust along the bottom of the pan - honestly that's the best part.

First time making homemade Mac and cheese and decided to give this recipe a try. I looked up a few things to tweak it so it would come out creamy and not too dry. The only thing I did differently was sub out half of the milk with heavy cream, and I also used fontina cheese and pepper jack, instead of cheddar cheese. Other than that the recipe was pretty much the same and I cooked everything the same as well. Came out great! I would use this recipe again in the future!

I am a faculty resident in a boarding school dorm and served a double recipe of this mac and cheese to the boys. They loved it more than anything else I've made all year. It's the crushed up buttery crackers on the top that make the real difference. In addition, I appreciate that the simple flavors in the recipe are popular with a wide variety of tastes.

Took this to party and everyone loved it!

Instead of crackers you could use breadcrumbs but I used the crackers.

Easy to make - cheesey and creamy - good comfort food. Now my go to recipe for baked Mac and cheese!

I love this recipe as a base. We enjoy extra sharp Cheddar cheese so I use that ,adding garlic to the cracker mixture gives it a little something extra you can really customize this recipe to what you like .

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I made it for a party.  Don't worry about it being thin--it thickens as it bakes.  I made it a few hours in advance and put it in the fridge.  Then I made the topping which is a generous amount and adds to this dish.  I added a sprinkle of garlic powder and dry mustard.  If it's for a crowd, make 2 trays!

I used Cellentani pasta instead of elbow. I added cayenne pepper, a little italian seasoning, fresh ground black pepper and an extra half a teaspoon salt or so. I doubled the butter for the topping and used two sleeved of townhouse crackers. More Buttery and less salty crackers than ritz. I am having a hard time trying to stop myself from a third serving...

I think it’s too much butter. next time i won’t use butter in the ritz , all the butter soaked in the ritz and then oozed out and just sat on the top of the whole dish. it’s good though. and i wouldn’t suggest using cheap cheese. maybe that’s why mine came out different but im going to blame the butter again because it tastes like everything separated. maybe i did it wrong. i thought i followed all the directions right though haha. But this is definitely a dish you can customize and make how you like.

This is the ONLY macaroni and cheese my son will eat. He loves it...which is crazy because he doesn’t really like cheese. It’s super cheesy with just the right amount of saltiness. I also made it for a church potluck and it was a big hit! Thanks!

I made this dish again tonight because it was such a hit last week when me and my daughter made it. I used a whole box of macaroni, 2 blocks of sharp cheddar cheese and breadcrumbs instead of crackers. I also used some onion powder, a small amount of minced garlic and some salt and pepper. I even brought some into work for a coworker and he absolutely LOVED it!!! Awesome recipe, next time my daughter wants to add hamburger meat to it. I will post how that comes out.

Simply delicious! As per some of the other comments, I added 1/2 tsp of dry mustard and 1/2 tsp of paprika into the main cheese mix. Additionally, I added some grated Parmesan to both the cheese mix and the cracker topping. Came out great and definitely was even better the second day.

I would give this 4 stars as written. The second time I made it I added seasonings including black pepper, paprika, dry mustard, and a bit of garlic powder.  It only took mine 30 minutes. It is tempting to add more noodles than it calls for, but doing this can cause the dish to dry out.  Also, for maximum flavor, use a good quality sharp cheddar block cheese, and grate it yourself. Yummy!

This recipe was a big hit with my family. I made a couple of alterations. I used a whole box of macaroni and I didn't put the crackers on top. It turned out well and filled a 9x13 pan completely full. Served more then six. Plenty for a party of eight. I would make it again:)

Savannah, age 7, ordered Mac n Cheese.  She said it was almost as good as Chef Ben makes it at school.  But she said leave the crackers off.  I thought it was very good in my quest for the perfect Mac n Cheese recipe and I loved the buttered cracker crumbs on top.

I did not like this recipe at all. This was nothing like creamy, gooey macaroni and cheese I’ve known my entire life. It makes more of a cheese sauce. And the sauce is an odd texture due to the addition of flour. It wasn’t cheesy enough either. Going forward, I will stick with my standard cheese, condensed milk and butter. Hate that I wasted my time and the ingredients.

This was a hit at my house. I used a mixture of Colby Jack, sharp, and mild cheddar.

It lacked salt for me. I added 4 slices of Kraft smoky bacon cheddar and two cups of low-fat Dean’s Cottage Cheese. I also cooked it in a cast iron pot until it smelled done. I also used medium shells.

Great recipe! I didn’t have a full pound of cheddar so I supplemented with pepper jack which gave it a little kick. I’ll make this again for sure!

I doubled the recipe and added a few things. I added dry mustard, paprika and garlic powder for some extra flavour.  I also used 1 cup of 10% cream to make it a little more creamier . Also used bread 
Crumbs for topping mixed with butter. Turned out fabulous and tasted wonderful.

I made this for my work lunch. It was delicious!  A couple of things I did differently. I used heavy cream for 1 cup of milk and I added hatch green chillis and bacon. It was a hit with my fellow work associates.

Delicious and easy! I loved it. However, I made this with a five year old and the texture was not well loved by her. I omitted the extra melted butter(as a calorie cut down, I also used skim milk)and just used cracker crumbs. I also added a small sprinkle of garlic salt and it improved the flavor, I highly recommend doing this. Overall, this is a fabulous recipe and I plan to make it again.

I have made this for huge crowds.  When I do, I cook it all in a big cooker and make the topping separate on backing sheets.  Then everyone can have a spoonful of topping on theirs.

The consistency was very good. However, this needed seasoning! Definitely salt, maybe some dry mustard and paprika or cayenne. Next time I will add parmesan or a different type of salty cheese

Absolutely delicious. The  changes I made is that I used fat free milk, three different cheddars (sharp cheddar, white sharp, & white mild),  and added parmesan cheese to the cracker crumbs. Came out perfect the first time I made it.

It was dry and bland. I used a very sharp cheese and gouda.  When cooked it was oily. Cooking time was too long and the overall taste was nothing exciting. I would change up the cheese and would add more butter, milk and flour. However, I am sure I can find a better recipe. Overall, not good.

Followed everything written here, and I'm impressed for my first ever product on baking.  I wasn't of course expecting the colorful Mac n Cheese like those served in restaurants but I'm pretty happy with the result. I just basically used whatever ingredient I have and this met my expectations.

I followed the instructions as is and it turned out to be a mess. The steps as written say to add the butter, flour, and milk together. I should have used my common sense. Make a roux with the butter and flour then add the milk. Also DO NOT use prepackaged shredded cheese.  It will make the dish stringy with a gritty taste.  If that happens to you, add ice cubes to resurrect the dish.  Based on this I should give it a one star. However the next day I made a new batch of roux and was able to revamp the dish to make it super yummy. My kid said it was the best tasting macaroni ever.  Lesson learned: make a roux and shred your own cheese.

sorry to say this did not come out good for me.   The cheese sauce was sandy and not smooth.  I  only used 2 cups of milk since I thought 4 cups was way too much and I still had way too much sauce.

This was a good starter recipe. I made a few adjustments to this recipe to suit my family's taste buds. I cut the amount of milk by 1.5 cups and did not use crackers.   I  blended a tablespoon of mustard, a small onion, 3 cloves garlic, and a teaspoon of paprika into the milk that was to be added to the the roux. I also added three more cups of shredded cheese to the mix and used shredded cheese as a topper instead of crackers or breadcrumbs. It turned out fantastic!

Maybe it's just our taste, but we found this lacking in salt, even according to the recipe. And I probably should have cooked the noodles a little less, they were too soft.

OMG! This is soooo good. A friend was making fun of me for making Annie's Organic so I thought I'd cave and try to make it.  I had some drunken cheddar in the fridge from the farmer's market. I used that, plus regular cheddar and mozzarella. I didn't have crackers or bread crumbs so I just put sliced cheese on top.  Next time I'm going to try using less butter but other than that, this is perfect.

I have a tried and true Mac and Cheese recipe but my husband told me it wasn't creamy enough so I decided to try this one.  I made it with my 8 year old son for a Cub Scout function and followed the recipe to the tee.  We used extra sharp cheese, but it was bland.

I cooked and added Hamburger and sweated onions to the sauce after I made the roux. and some garlic powder and pepper, with a pinch of sea salt. Just to add more flavor. It is awesome! It's Like a cheesy maid rite.

I made two batches of this for a potluck and everyone loved it. I made one batch with green chili and the other without. I did follow other reviewer's advice, making roux first and adding dry mustard with other ingredients. Family liked the leftovers with ground beef. Will definitely make again.

I've tried other recipe and this one was great!! I've cut the recipe in half and it was still pretty big, my baby loved it! Also I didn't put it for 45 mins, after 20 mins it was fine, maybe because I made it smaller! So cheesy!

I've made this several times, editing the recipe each time until I found the perfect thing. What got  it rave reviews, I sauteed 2 tablespoons of white onion and a clove or garlic, in the butter. Also, omitting the flour keeps it less chalky tasting. Also, I've tried different noodles, fusilli was the winner, my husband added that it seems to grab the cheese better.

Finally! A delicious, creamy homemade mac 'n' cheese recipe that doesn't use velveta. Pretty easy, too. I tried so many before I found this one, and this is the one to keep. Would give it more stars if I could.

I just made this but I used plain & Italian bread crumbs. Since I used bread crumbs instead of the ritz crackers it was pretty bland. I had to add salt and pepper to give it some flavor. Maybe a little more cheese to. My family likes it be

I'm not a cook. Like I hardly ever made anything that didn't come out of a box in the freezer.
I mixed everything together at once in step three without making a roux (whatever that is) that other reviewers talk about. 
When I poured the cheese mixture in the baking pan over the pasta, I was super worried because there was so much! and I couldn't even see the noodles anymore. The sauce was almost to the top of the pan.
I sprinkled grated cheese on top instead of the crackers.
It came out amazing!!! LOVE it!

Tasty and easy. Used half medium cheddar and half mild because my husband prefers mild cheddar. Added pepper for a little kick.

Wonderful! Forgot the elbow pasta, so naked it with penne instead.  Served 5 adults and 3 kids with plenty left over. Everybody loved it, and agreed that it was the best ever and so much better than anything out of a box.

Ok, the best part of this recipe is the cheese sauce ratio to noodles!! When baked, noodles usually absorb most of the sauce, this was perfect! I used a 3/4 lb. White cheddar/gruyere cheese blend from Trader Joes, 2 oz. cream cheese and 2 oz. sharp cheddar. Again this will thicken up some more. Don't over cook. Other changes were: Added 1/2 of a small onion (small chopped) in the melted butter when starting the Roux. Stirred in 1/8 tsp. of cracked pepper to cheese sauce before pouring over elbow macaroni in greased 9x13 dish. Used sleeve of crushed Garlic Ritz Crackers for topping. Viola!! Easy and Excellent!

I LOVE this recipe! I've made it time and time again for my husband, who is an absolute mac n' cheese FREAK. The pasta will get too mushy when baked in the oven if you cook it even a little over al dente, so I would advise taking the pasta out of the boiling water a minute or two before you think you really have too. The kind of cheese you pick really dictates the flavor you get out of it- I use 2 cups Cheddar and 2 cups Mexican blend and it's perfect for us, perfectly mild, and we use Italian bread crumbs on top. I will say that it doesn't sit very well in your stomach, it's a heavy dish, but it's so tasty.

This recipe was pretty good but not fantastic - I made it as written except that I used garlic croutons instead of crushed crackers for the topping, and I cut the amount of butter for the topping in half (it just seemed like a lot!).  As per other reviewers' advice for step 3, I also mixed the butter and flour together over heat before adding the milk and cheddar cheese (also didn't add the salt because I just forgot).  I think this worked better than adding everything altogether as the recipe suggests.  I would recommend this if you're looking for a "simpler" baked macaroni and cheese dish.

I used half sharp cheddar and half medium cheddar and it was still quite bland. It is a good base recipe though. I will probably use it again, but try to figure out how to intensify the flavour.

I've been in the kitchen perfecting my soul food since I was a child. One thing I never got right was mac n cheese, so I stopped making it because it never came out the way I like my mac n cheese to be when it's done right. This recipe was done right. I used a combination of heavy cream, canned milk and a little half n half because that was all I had. I also seasoned the macaroni a touch because I like it to be savory (seasoned salt, garlic powder, black pepper, a little cayenne - light on the salt, it didn't need a lot.) I also used italian breadcrumbs for the topping. Finally, a mac n cheese that I can stick my fork into. Oh! and I used a combo of extra sharp and sharp. Great recipe.

This was my first time baking mac and cheese and it turned out very well! There was no real skill required and it was really tasty. I had no butter crackers but saltines worked fine. I will definitely be making this again!

When I decided I was no longer feeding my kids boxed mac n cheese I went hunting for recipes. This is now my go-to mac n cheese recipe!! I've made it several times now and it turns out great ever time!! Soo good! Now I'm one of those people who likes to "eye-ball" recipes, so I don't ever measure my pasta. For the amount of sauce you make I typically use a whole box of macaroni. And I add extra cheese. I've found sharp cheddar gives me the best flavor. I also add extra seasoning to my cheese sauce. We like things just a little more spicy, the sauce needed a little zing. The last time I made it I added some extra shredded sharp cheddar to the dish once the sauce and pasta were mixed. I really like the way it came out. This is THE mac n cheese recipe for us!! And the topping is so good!!

This was wonderful. I am allergic to cow dairy (excepting butter) so I was excited to find a recipe for mac and cheese where I could simply make goat dairy substitutions. I scaled down the ingredients to make 1/4 the original, used panko in place of crackers, and baked it in the toaster oven. I worried about there being so much more sauce than macaroni, but figured a lot of the liquid would get absorbed as well as boil out. As the vessel I used was deep (instead of wide), I lengthened the time of baking (to about an hour). Perfection! Boy, I've missed mac and cheese... I'll make this again and be creative next time. I'm pleased as pudding with this base recipe. Big thanks to Jody for submitting it!

I followed the recipe as is and found it to be a bit bland.  The only thing that could have made it different than the recipe posted is I used unsalted butter instead of salted butter.  I don't think I would make this again unless it was tweaked to have more flavor.

It is a good base but needs flavor. Next time I would add garlic powder, a little more cheese and use SHARP Cheddar. Maybe add less pasta or make more sauce.

It was absolutely delicious. I have tried a few homemade mac and cheese recipes and this is by far the best. The only thing I would change is to add more cheese than it suggests.Just to give it a more cheesy taste. I haven't tried it again but I might for Superbowl Sunday. But other than that. I love it! Thanks soo much for posting this!!!

I made this exactly as written. Way too much sauce so I had to make more pasta to accommodate for it. The texture was gritty not creamy at all.

This didn't excite me, but a few of my kids say they can live on it. I made a triple batch for a large dinner, and had a good 3/4 left, because it was very basic in flavor, and there was a lot of other dishes... I did the roux, but only used sharp cheddar, not much salt, and it was meh. This was much better the next day, though, and the entire pan was polished off last night. I will make this again, but with a triple variety of cheeses, as some others mentioned.

Made this over Thanksgiving. The family loved it! My last mac and cheese was great, but I wanted to try and cut the cost down a bit, so I found a new recipe. It was very creamy. I went strictly by the recipe. The sauce thickened up as it baked. This is my new go to recipe for mac and cheese!

Very good!! I made half on the recipe because I was cooking just for myself but it couldve easily fed 3 people.  Very yummy! I added a dash of paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper and onion powder! Im not sure how much cheese i really used....just kept adding until it tasted the way I wanted it!

This recipe finally gave me the creamy mac and cheese I was looking for, but sadly it does fail in the actual "cheese" department. I used three bags of extra sharp cheddar and one bag of taco blend cheese and the taste was still too mild. I still cannot find the perfect match of cheesy and creamy, but this one will now be the "base" that I work with!

Have been wanting to make some good Mac and cheese.  This recipe was perfect. We ended up adding onions to the noodles, as well as cayenne,  and French's fried onions and bread crumbs (mixed in the food pricessor) as the crust. Turned out amazing, and I recommend using our spin to it.

This is addictive!  So easy and comes out fabulous exactly as written.  You do not need to make any changes to improve this recipe.  I have made this several times.  I have used whatever blend of cheese I happen to have at the time and it  always come out just as good.  I used kolby jack last time.  Never skimp on the topping.  It really does make it look great and taste great.  I use the traditional "Ritz" crackers.

I'm looking for a good special Mac and Cheese dish.  I'm confused about the description of this dish that says the sour cream and mustard are key ingredients, but the recipe doesn't call for either.  The video didn't either.

I liked it, but my husband loved it. I just wish the cheese was a little bit more melted on the inside instead of grainy and chunky maybe it was the cheese I used.

I used bread crumbs and butter instead of rits crackers because I didn't have any, and it still came out wonderful. Also, instead I used datilinis instead of elbow macaroni because they were all I had and it STILL came out darn good!!!!!!;)

This was good but a little dry. I think I would add more milk next time, maybe another 1/3 cup. But it was very good and cheesy!

Thank you, Jody.. I have made your recipe many times and it is always a winner. I tweak it a bit and do add-ins of ham or bacon sometimes but your basic recipe is what I go to every time. Excellent!

This was good but needed a little something. Maybe next time I will put 2 cheeses instead of 1 to vary the flavor. I also didn't use the crackers but instead used the bread crumbs as recommended.

This was fantastic. My husband actually called it "awesome" and he has a very discriminating palate. I omitted additional salt, however, because the butter and Ritz have plenty.... but man, this was awesome. Thanks for sharing! Next up... we add jalapenos and bacon!

This was really good! I made it Gluten Free: 

-Substituted the all purpose flour with Bob's Red Mill Baking Mix 
-Substituted the elbow macaroni with Trader Joe's Corn Pasta Penne (Although I think a noodle other than penne would work better, corn or rice spiral.)
-I prefer almond milk over regular milk - so I substituted 4 c of milk for 3 c of unsweetened original almondmilk. 

Next time I will try adding some parmesan as well as adding a gluten free bread crumb topping.
 
Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good overall. Used half Mexican shredded cheese and half sharp cheddar shredded. Added two Tbsp of Worcestershire and used ziti for the pasta, which hold the sauce and cheese better than macaroni. Served with turkey meatloaf. The ritz topping makes all the difference.

It was a huge hit! I added 1/2 tsp of mustard powder, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and 1/4 tsp turmeric and black pepper. It really added a lot of flavor. My mom and husband added red pepper flakes to theirs but my kids and I liked it as I made it. Also, I left off the cracker topping.

Turned out great! Very simple.  I took the advice and made a roux first then slowly mixed in the cheese.  Also added cheese with the cracker topping.  Baked beautifully and tasted delicious!

This recipe was delicious. I made it for a friend, but I did not have a 9x13 pan, I only had a 9x9, luckily it fit, it just needed to be cooked a little longer. I then reheated it the next day for someone else and it was still good. It was super easy to make and I loved it. Just remember to use 2% or whole milk.

I made this dish and went according to the perople who said to make a rue, I also doubled the recipe to share with neighbors. It is amazing!! the perfect comfort food.My only change is I added 1/4 cup parmesian I had left over and wanted to use.omg though so fattening, however if you plan to just splurge it is a real treat!!

I made this for dinner tonight for my family. I baked it in individual dishes. We like cheese so I added another layer of Swiss under the cracker crumbs. I also added diced onions and garlic. It was 5 star for us.

My kids have always begged me to make homemade mac and cheese like the fancy restaurants.  I chose this recipe because it looked so easy and had items that my kids like (no onions!).  It was a HUGE hit!!.  My boys like it even better the 2nd and 3rd day and they NEVER eat leftovers.  It is a favorite in the thermos for my son's school lunch.  The only thing I do differently now is only spread the cracker mixture on 1/2 of the dish.  My one son loves the extra crunch on his side and my other likes it without the crunch.

It wasn't really that cheesy in my opinion. Perhaps I will attempt it a second time this time using twice the amount of cheese. But I think there are better options out there for homemade mac and cheese.

This definately makes more than 6 servings. I would say closer to 12. I used a bag of mixed chedder cheese's and also garlic croutons. Mine came out dry, and I'm not sure why? I will add some more cheese/milk to it for leftovers. I did add some onions and garlic which gave it some good flavor. Maybe next time some bacon or ham? I will try this recipe again and am keeping my fingers crossed it turns out better.

I made this recipe a few nights ago and my family really enjoyed it. I made it lactose-free and low-fat. I used Cabot brand 75% reduced-fat sharp cheddar cheese (naturally lactose-free) and fat-free, lactose-free milk. I also used buttery flavored spray on top of the crushed crackers instead of butter or margarine (to take away the calories). I used Ritz wheat crackers for the top. For the flour, I mixed whole wheat flour with the all-purpose flour. I also used whole wheat pasta. It was very tasty...and it re-heated nicely as well. I would definitely make this recipe again.
