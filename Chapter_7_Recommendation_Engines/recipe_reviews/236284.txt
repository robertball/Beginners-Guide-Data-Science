This is a good way to prepare cauliflower, but I need to make a few changes next time.  This recipe really needs a large wok to make successfully, I think.  It nearly overwhelmed my 12 inch skillet.  First of all, I think the meat needs to be seasoned.  A classic way to prepare a Chinese dish is to heat the oil (usually peanut oil, because of the high smoke point) with a couple of slices of ginger, and some sliced garlic.  When they brown, remove them from the oil, and then add the meat.  The flavored oil, along with some soy sauce at this point, would help the meat to have some flavor.  Also, instead of green onions, next time I will sub 1/2 to 1 onion, chopped, to saute with at least 3 cloves of garlic.  My skillet wasn't really large enough to handle the eggs, so I need to cook them to soft scramble stage in a separate pan.  Last, use the sesame oil as a seasoning, instead of a cooking oil, along with the chopped green onions.  I used much more than the 6 tablespoons recommended in the recipe.  Agree with another reviewer, this recipe is very filling.

This sounds like a wonderful inventive recipe.  Good thinking!  But I must point out that Sesame oil should not be heated.  It become detrimental to health when it's composition is changed thru heat.  Use peanut, coconut or olive oil when making this dish as I will do.  Then toast sesame seeds and drizzle the oil and the seeds over the dish before serving.   You'll get a stronger taste of sesame this way and no ill effects to your health.

This recipe is unbelievable. I served it to 2 cauliflower non-lovers and didn't tell them what it was until they were finished raving about it. Hubby said it's up there with his other favourite recipe from AR. That is one high praise. I wasn't sure that straight veggies and pork was going to be enough for my big boys, so I made some rice anyways to add to the dish. The rice is now in my freezer. It was totally unnecessary. The directions don't tell you when to add the peas so I added them to the wok with the pork on it's second round. I also nuked the peas rather than use the stove top. I am so glad I tried this recipe. As another reviewer bd.weld said, "definitely a keeper". Thanks so much John Melinte!

Great Recipe...but note for Cindy - please get your facts straight...you CAN heat sesame oil...as with other oils, you have many different varieties, a refined or semi refined light sesame oil which has a high smoke point is absolutely perfect for cooking and I use it all the time. Unrefined sesame oil is best used for dressing or topping vs cooking as it is very flavorful in its pure state. Dark sesame oil has a lower smoke point and no oil should be cooked beyond the point of smoke...if it smokes, toss everything and start over.

I made this recipe, but i took some suggestions of others (added the peas at the end, and I cooked the eggs separately and added them in). I also made some changes of my own: I marinated the cubed pork in some toasted sesame oil, fresh chopped ginger, and a chopped garlic clove for about 30 minutes or so (while I prepped everything else) and I left the ginger in the finished meal and it was delicious!! I also added some corn and bean sprouts at the end.  And for the record, I really dislike the taste of cauliflower and I had a second serving!!

This "Cauliflower Fried Rice" is EXCELLENT (chef worthy)! I had imagined so many adaptations to the recipe before I had actually made it (i.e. marinate the meat; switch up the pork for a combination of pork, chicken, and shrimp; add hot pepper sauce and/or fresh grated ginger) but I don't think there is much room for improvement in this recipe "as written" now that I have made it. If I didn't know that it was made with cauliflower, I would have never guessed (although the reheated "leftovers" did taste like cauliflower, but still delicious). My large "average" cauliflower yielded 40 ounces of shredded cauliflower, so a small cauliflower would have been enough. I deviated from the recipe only slightly: used garden-fresh peas (not frozen) and cooked them with the vegetables (not separately); added a couple stalks of diced celery and a cup of sliced button mushrooms (which were in my fridge needing to be used up); doubled up on the garlic (personal taste); and used gluten-free low-sodium tamari (not regular gluten-containing soy sauce). I also used toasted sesame oil for the classical Chinese flavor (not almost flavorless plain sesame oil). Thank you John Melinte for sharing your recipe.

Outstanding and definitely a keeper. This recipe is so flavorful and versatile. The only thing I recommend is maybe one more clove of garlic. The cauliflower rice is spot on. Thank you John Melinte for a great recipe.

I fixed this and it turned out great. Used extra cauliflower. First time I've used sesame oil and really love the flavor it gave to the dish. We used chicken instead of pork and I also cooked my eggs in another pan. My husband loved it and was sad it was already gone after 2 meals.  (I saved some to have it for another meal for us) Will definitely fix again.

Used this recipe as a base and replaced the pork with shrimp.  Delicious low carb alternative to fried rice!  Hubs loved it as well!

This was an awesome way to use up cauliflower for picky eaters!
I did make some changes:
*I used pork chops & marinated them in 1 c. soy sauce, 2 TBS corn starch, 1/8 c. brown sugar, chopped ginger & 2 garlic cloves.  Then I cooked the meat and set the sauce aside for the last few min of cooking to give the cauliflower flavor and to cook out raw meat sauce.  
*I used oil instead of sesame oil because it doesn't burn as easily.  I later used a little sesame oil for flavor. (I didn't need anymore soy sauce later)
*I also used a whole cauliflower & 2 carrots.  I then shredded them with my salad shooter & cooked at the same time.  It took WAY longer 5 min to soften up- more like 20!
* Add more eggs too!  I think 4-5 is sufficient.
Super Yummy!!!

We LOVE this recipe!  We have used both chicken and sirloin strips.  I would use about 24 oz of cauliflower.  I just take a large sharp knife and cut the cauliflower into small pieces.  I also would cut way back on the soy sauce!  We used 3 TBSP and added fresh ground pepper and some chinese 5 spice.  Yummy and a fantastic low carb delight!

I was very skeptical of trying this recipe, but it's a keeper!  I love cauliflower, but you seriously don't even know you are eating it, it really tastes just like Fried Rice!   I did what someone else suggested though, and flavored peanut oil with garlic and ginger root, and then stir fried the pork in it..  it really gives it a good flavor. I used the peanut oil to stir fry everything and THEN added sesame oil as a flavor enhancer after it was all cooked.   Most of the other steps I did just as the recipe said.  One thing I must add though, is that grating the cauliflower is a bit messy!!  Well worth the clean up though.

Delicious! I didn't use any meat. Instead of sweet peas I used frozen mixed vegetables. I added some teriyaki sauce, salt and pepper. Love it definitely will do again.

Made this for lunch for my fiance and myself and it was wonderful! Very easy to make, just a little prep work needed.  I used some leftover shredded pork shoulder and just crisped it up a bit in the pan following the same steps in the recipe. This will be a regular lunch for us! I served with a baked eggroll on the side :)

I liked this recipe but the recipe never specifies when you add the soy sauce and peas.  I put them in last and heated the peas through.  I'm not proficient in wok cooking but I have one which I used maybe twice.  I'm 78 and have been cooking for 58 years and would love to try new things.  It was an easy recipe but I think next time I will put all the ingredients out and ready to go.  I had to stop and chop onions and made it on a stop and go basis.  I wasn't very organized but it came out pretty good.  Made too much for just me and my hubby.  But we will warm it up another day.

I followed the recipe, except I added left-over ham.  It was so yummy!  Lots of work cutting, so I made a large batch so I can eat it for a few days.  Also I used the Cuisinart to "rice" the cauliflower.

I made this dish tonight and used shrimp instead of pork.  I used half of a yellow onion, didn't have green. I added sugar snap peas, as well.  Had them on hand.  Wonderful.  My husband didn't know that it wasn't rice!  This is a keeper...

So delicious! Only used 4 T soy sauce (I actually use coconut aminos), and I will make next time with 3. Luckily, I have a food processor, which made short work of ricing.  Whole family loved this! Thanks for the recipe.

Very good recipe for tasty, healthy comfort food.  I used a grater and making the cauliflower "rice" was fast and easy.  A very healthy and tasty dish.  I used lower sodium soy.  Next time, I'll try Braggs Aminos instead.

Loved this recipes!  I'm on Aitkins induction so a delicious low-carb recipe is a god-send!  The only change I made was to add a small diced onion to the stir fry (because I love onion), but otherwise spot-on!

I just made it today and we loved it!  Used leftover pork shoulder and added two more eggs, and a little more soy sauce.  It is amazing how it looks, and tastes, like it has rice in it!  So good!!

Most of my family avoids vegetables. The didn't know what was in this recipe and LOVED it. I used chicken instead of pork since that's what I had. Maybe a little too much meat. Definitely a keeper!

This was awesome!  Besides shredding the cauiflower, which was a little bit of work,even though I used a Cuisinart, it was super easy and so good. Noone even knew there wasn't real rice!

I was skeptical, but now I'm a convert!  Cauliflower rice is awesome!  This recipe rocks too.  I used ground turkey for the meat, and sautéed grated ginger and the chopped garlic with the meat.  To boost the veggie content I added chopped napa cabbage and sugar snap peas (instead of the frozen ones). I took the advice of other reviewers and added the sesame oil at the end along with the soy sauce and 1/2 t. of cornstarch and 1/4 t chinese five spice, and 1/4 t. cayenne for some kick.  It also needed a t of salt I thought.  Topped with green onion and cilantro.  Also, cooked eggs separately then tossed in.  I gave my teenage grandson (and confirmed vegetable hater) a huge bowl which he gobbled up.  I didn't tell him it was cauliflower rice, maybe I never will.  A grandmother's got to have some secrets...

Put the shredded cauliflower on a dish towel and squeeze out the liquid - I was surprised how much squeezed out. Also don't cover the pan when cooking - it makes it come out mushy.

good. I used shrimp in stead of pork and snap fees instead of peas. Cooked the eggs in the same pan and you couldn't tell they were in there. Maybe next time cook it separately.   It does make a lot. My cauliflower was smaller than rice. Next time only do one pass through the food processor.

LOVE IT! I didn't have any pork so I used turkey bacon (not super authentic, but man was it good!). Next time I'll add some bean sprouts with the carrots. Cooking this with sesame oil makes all the difference, awesome nutty flavor. Great recipe!!!

I'm giving this recipe a high rating because I think it is good, but I'll warn you (if you seriously hate cauliflower as I do) don't expect a miracle. The texture is spot on.  The flavor of the other elements in the dish is fantastic, BUT I hate the residual flavor left in my mouth when I eat cauliflower (that earthy, almost dirt-like taste and that "green" aftertaste in the back of my throat that reminds me of the aftertaste of Brussels sprouts...)  This is a good dish and the carb count is fantastic, BUT I still taste the cauliflower.  The aftertaste is still there.  The dish itself is good; I'm just weird.  Bleh.

Good recipe. I used just 5 tbsp of soy sauce instead of 6. Recipe is versatile and love the crunch of the cauliflower vs rice. Will keep it in rotation.

Flavor is good - very much like fried rice.    I made no changes. The 20 oz of cauliflower is a whole head as you buy it in the store. It is hard to handle this quantity in a wok like you use on a home stovetop.

Oh if I would have discovered this gem of a lo w-carb version of Fried Rice a decade or more ago! Been living Atkins lowcarb lifestyle since 2000 and miss all the starches that don't go along with it so when I first made this recipe for which I did not disclose to my husband had cauliflower as the main ingredient as he refuses to eat it imagine my suprise when he went back for seconds and asked me why we were eating 'rice'! 

I serve it with a side of whole fat cottage cheese which for a lowcarb eater goes really well with any dish but especially this as the cool creaminess of the cottage cheese ofsets the richness of the rice. This truly is a one dish meal too and even tastes great the next day. 

It's been a staple in our home ever since. I must say that I don't grate the caulflower but instead use the stem and all and chuck it into our food processor THEN squeeze out the natural juices using a dishtowel before adding it into the pan.  If you don't squeeze the juices out it will make your fried rice dish too wet. I just add the juice into my kitchen compost bowl and recycle it.

This also saves an immense amount of time & physical demands on your body if your at all like me and have arthralgia and have to limit the pressure on my joints and the cauliflower still yields it's shape which is like rice. 

Large Wok: I use my large stovetop Wok to prepare this dish as it allows you to move the ingredients around and up on the sides as you say add your egg and ingredients into th

Low carb yum. Since my husband was diagnosed with diabetes, ten years ago, he has not had fried rice and its one of the few foods he really misses. He was in heaven when I made this. Great low carb substitute. I made one change.When you cook sesame oil you lose most of the flavor. I recommend using any high burn point oil to stir fry and drizzling sesame oil on and mixing in to finish.

Would use less Soy Sauce. Maybe 4 tablespoons would be better than 6. Would add shrimp next time instead of pork. Would like to try adding regular onions as an addition as other cooks did, would add 1-2 more eggs since that is one of the best parts.

YUM! Cauliflower has never been so good!
Agree that it takes a big wok (luckily, I have that). 
I made it with tofu instead of pork.
I'll use only half the soy sauce next time.

Very good. I opted to make mine vegetarian, so left out the pork. I also had no green onion, so I used half a sweet onion. Eating this you couldn't even tell there was no rice, the cauliflower is way more flavorful. I cut the soy sauce in half and it was just right for my taste. Also didn't add the garlic until about 30 seconds before the cauliflower as I didn't want it to burn. Also I soaked my peas in warm water for a couple minutes to thaw them up, no need to boil them first.

This is my first recipe using cauliflower rice. I am shocked at how good it is. Through the cooking process I smelled that cauliflower gross smell, but after adding the seasonings and the soy sauce, that goes out the window and it is amazing. I think the only thing I did different was that I used Ponzu instead of soy sauce, just because I prefer it in general. I will absolutely make this again. EXCELLENT.

The concept is great, and the cauliflower makes for a great substitution without a doubt. However, I felt that there was a lack of flavor in this recipe. I think I will definitely try this again and add more spice and some more veggies. i.e. mushrooms, water chestnuts, baby corn, etc.

This is the first recipe I've made where cauliflower is the substitute for a carb because I've been a little skeptical but I have to say this was AMAZING. The only changes I made were to marinate the chicken in a little bit of teriyaki sauce before cooking it (about 25-30 minutes while I prepped the veggies), I added 1 jalapeño to the veggies for a little spice, and I probably only used 3-4 tablespoons of soy sauce. The tip at the bottom of the recipe page to use a cheese grater to shred the cauliflower was genius! I would 100% recommend this recipe, even if you're not trying to watch carb intake. It's that good!

I loved this recipe - I had a head of cauliflower in the refrigerator and just happened to have all of the other ingredients on hand. The only substitution was that I used leftover chicken instead of pork. The flavors are great and if you are looking to cut carbs you won't even miss the rice. I'll definitely make this again :)

I used tofu instead of pork and added ginger and celery. Instead of shredding cauliflower I put it in the blender which chopped it quite nicely. I also used 4 eggs because I had a lot of cauliflower. This was excellent. I will have a bunch of yummy leftovers.

Loved it! I sub'd out red meat for chicken, also used egg whites... It came out great and super easy. My teenager ate it and she usually would never touch cauliflower.

Terrific! My changes: I used asparagus which I simmered, then simmered the carrot slices in the same water till it was absorbed. Added the sesame oil (light) then minced ginger and garlic and sliced chicken sausages till they were browned. Removed those to the dish with the asparagus and carrots, drizzled soy sauce, teriyaki and toasted sesame oil over. Added more sesame oil (light) and olive oil to skillet, sauteed the cauliflower and scallions till tender then added all the other ingredients. Scrambled the egg right in the same skillet (pushed the other ingredients aside) then mixed all together. It is a great recipe to play with! Thanks!!

My four year old has decided that all veggies are gross so I cooked this to get some into her diet. I exchanged the peas for yellow corn (which she still eats) and added a 1/2 cup of cooked rice for looks. She loved it.

Amazing recipe!  Instead of adding peas and carrots, I added red and yellow peppers chopped finely. I am happy someone wrote that it was too much soy sauce. I just added to flavor. Next time I will add 3 eggs...they are delicious in this recipe.

Well I am just starting to put it together in the cast iron wok.  Now am I mistaken or did the precooked peas evaporate in the recipe.  I will add with the cooked pork and soy sauce.  I just don't see how they put it to finish, maybe my eyes lost them.

I found this recipe to be bland and not very filling.  It was not difficult to shred the cauliflower with a cheese grater. It wasn't terrible, but I definitely won't be making it again.

Followed the recipe exactly as listed.  Outstanding, excellent.  If someone had made this for me and not told me it was cauliflower I wouldn't know.  I'm quite picky about my fried rice and its my standard for rating a Chinese restaurant and this definitely makes the cut.

Great flavor! We’ve been doing keto for quite a while and this was a great way to get some more variety in our dinners. I had a bag of frozen riced cauliflower so I thawed it in the microwave before adding and it turned out great, both the flavor and texture. Will definitely be making this again.

“This is the only way I will eat cauliflower ever again” this is what my hubby said to me after trying this recipe! It was so delicious, easy and quick. We fried some chicken on the side, instead of the pork, but we could have gone without any. In my opinion, it could also serve as a nice veggie dish.

WOW that was amazing. Great recipe with great flavor.  The only thing I did different was add some powdered ginger - it’s something I add to all my fried rice dishes.

Made it pretty much as the recipe says. Because my husband doesn't like peas I used frozen oriental stir fried veggies. I also scrambled the eggs separate and added a dash of Chinese 5 spice. I also did as another posted and added some Teriyaki sauce. Won't be doing that next time. Made it taste to salty

It looks way better than it tastes. All I can taste is soy sauce. I will not make this again.

Delicious. I used chicken, half bag of frozen mixed veggies and a bag of riced cauliflower.  I kept
everything else the same  Can't wait to try it with pork.  Best part is my boyfriend loved it. I didn't 
tell him it was made with cauliflower.   Thank you for the great recipe

I made this recipe with chicken breast.  I didn't prep as I should have and still was able to pull through.  I found it to be pretty easy and very delicious!  The carrots stayed a bit crisp but it made it all the better texture wise.  Will definitely do it again.

One of the best cauli recipes I have found! Worth the little bit of effort and now regular fried rice taste like garbage in comparison. We make it frequently and just change up the meat dish. but delicious and holds its own by itself as well!

Should make as is except add 2 more eggs and reduce the soy sauce by 2-3 TBSP as others have suggested. I didn't listen but should have. Cauliflower requires far less than rice would. I added some corn, more carrots, etc. Can throw in any veggies and would be great. Was very good.

Delicious! I only made one minor change - I didn't pre-cook the peas. I simply added them (still slightly frozen) when the recipe called for it and they turned out great. I will definitely make this again.

A perfect carb friendly alternative to fried rice.  Paired perfectly with homemade orange chicken!  I did make multiple modifications...1) I didn’t add pork.  2) I used 1/3 c. avocado oil to fry the cauliflower, carrots, and garlic for about 15-20 min covered until it started browning like fried rice 3) I added the peas about 10-15 min into the frying as my peas were slightly defrosted and I didnt want them to be over cooked 4) I drizzled soy sauce, definitely using less than the recipe calls for 5) I drizzled the sesame oil over the dish at the end for that additional flavor without heating it to become rancid and unhealthy

Delicious.  Had eaten  cauliflower rice the night before and it was very tasty. Had cauliflower in refrigerator so made for lunch today using what I had. Made lots of little changes and this was truly  delicious. Used leftover chicken and corn cut from cob. Added 1/2 cut up zucchini. Used more garlic and fresh ginger, 1/2 of the cauliflower, only 2T low salt soy sauce and fried two eggs and added the frozen  peas at the end. Added a bit of water  too. No need to cook peas earlier.  Serve with sweet-sour or Duck sauce. Will make over and over.

There is a fine line where the cauliflower is perfect.  My husband says he still prefers white rice, but went back for seconds.  So, this will be repeated.

I made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was good. My family realized it was not rice because the cauliflower was a little crunchy. The second time I made it I used the same flavorings but used some leftovers and a bag of frozen asian medly vegetables(thawed). First I cut a large portabella mushroom into strips like meat and used leftover cooked pork tenderloin. I stir fried these in oil.  Next I added the cauliflower. I stirred for 2 minutes and then covered it for 5 minutes to allow it to steam. This softened the cauliflower to make the texture more like rice. Next I added the thawed vegtables. Then I scrambled the eggs and stirred it in. Finally the soy sauce. No one recognized the cauliflower. Everyone loved it.  The meat could be left out for a meatless version. The portabella mushroom is hearty and seems like meat.

first time using riced cauliflower.  easy to make but takes a little planning.  used leftover blanched snow peas, sugar snap peas, asparagus and broccoli.  added ginger, thai fish oil, and shredded beets.  was a great dinner with plenty of leftovers.

AWESOME recipe. I highly recommend it for a guilt-less chinese food splurge. Of COURSE it's not going to completely replace a good fried rice dish but it comes close enough to add to the repertoire. Even the biggest food critics in the house liked it. I made it with shrimp instead of pork, and added corn. I will be switching up the proteins to keep it interesting. 


My only real recommendation is to make enough to eat fresh and finish up. This may not be  something other people have encountered but I found that my leftovers sweat a lot and completely changed in taste the next day.

this was great!!  i really miss Chinese food when i go low carb and I'm glad i came across this recipe.   just for personal preference,  i omited the carrots and substituted onions for the green onions.  but i followed the steps/ technique exactly as written.  very filling.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I will be the first to admit I didn’t use pork so the flavor could be off for that reason. But this just seemed to be missing something flavorwise that wouldve made it fried rice. Texture and appearance was great but the only real flavor was coming from soy sauce which was not enough to conceal the cauli flavor. Will continue my search for a better recipe and use for cauli rice.

This is a great recipe. I made mine with chicken.  I added broccoli in the place of the peas. I also added fresh ginger , red pepper flakes and a teaspoon of Dijon mustard to the soy sauce and marinated the cooked chicken in it while I cooked the cauliflower. I will make this again!

Made this dish for the first time tonight with some substitutions based on other reviews and a few additions. It came out quite well and was filling. I used peanut oil for cooking and toasted sesame oil for added flavor at the final step. Used chicken in place of the pork which I seasoned with salt, pepper and ground ginger, then marinated for about 30 min in soy sauce, toasted sesame oil and minced garlic. Left out the peas (mainly because we didn’t have any on hand), added about a half onion chopped with minced garlic sautéed at the get go, and chopped water chestnuts along with the carrot for some crunch. Served with mixed veggies (broccoli, onion, bell peppers, mushrooms) stir-fried with more toasted sesame oil, and pork egg rolls on the side. Didn’t use all 6 tbsp of soy sauce, but probably could have for more flavor. It does take some time to prep and cook, but the cleanup may have been just as long! Did the whole thing in a large cast iron skillet except the egg which was cooked separately. We’ll be cooking this again.

First, because this makes a lot, I used a large pot instead of a skillet (I don't have a wok). This works really well. I also used 2 bags of frozen cauliflower rice from Trader Joe's (12 oz each, so a little more than the recipe calls for).  I also prepped the eggs in advance, and had them scrambled and diced. Instead of traditional soy sauce, I used Braggs Liquid Aminos. Coconut Aminos or Tamari would be equally as good, and may not be as strong as the one reviewer noted.  The first time I made this, I did not have green onions on hand.  Still tasted very good without them. The second time, I made a point of having green onions on hand, and also decided to add about a teaspoon of freshly grated ginger, and instead of pork loin, we bought organic ground pork.  Wow, was it delicious. This will be a standard in our household with the added fresh ginger.  This is a great way to use leftover meat, which we often have after roasting a chicken, etc. Using frozen cauliflower rice makes it SO easy!

I wanted to love it - but enjoyed it enough to make again with some changes. The sesame oil and soya overwhelmed the flavour - will adjust even more next time. Worked great in a large wok, used diced ham because I had it leftover, and 1/2 cup of cooked brown rice (same reason).  Next time going to shock cool the peas after blanching and add at last minute to retain a fresher flavour. Also will top with sliced snap peas and rough chopped cachew or sliced almonds and sesame seeds for some texture at serving.

I am not a big fan cauliflower, but this was really good.  I modified it by using "riced" cauliflower from the grocery store and also added a bit of teriyaki sauce.

I've made this  couple times & loved it. I end up doing everything separately & mixing it together at the end. I saute lots of vegetables (peppers, an onion cut into big pieces, sugar snap peas, carrots, broccoli, & anything else I want) about 7-9 minutes until cooked & put them aside. Then scramble 3-4 eggs. Then cook the meat (usu chicken) - I did marinate it with some sesame oil, fresh minced ginger & a garlic clove while getting everything else ready.  I do the "rice" last by cooking it in a T or 2 of sesame oil X 4-5 minutes, adding the soy sauce (6-8 T) & then adding everything back to mix & make sure it's all heated thoroughly. I used sesame oil for everything except the eggs. Fed 10 with about 1 1/5 # of chicken, lots of veggies, & 2# of "rice". Costco has the cauliflower rice already prepped!

This was our first attempt at cauliflower "rice" and we were all pleasantly surprised. I followed the directions, exactly, except that I used olive oil for my sauteing and drizzled with toasted sesame oil before serving, as noted by other reviewers. I also left the pork out altogether, because of personal preference. We'll definitely be adding this into our regular rotation. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Loved this!  So good hard to stop eating.  Suggest careful on the soy sauce.  6 Tb a bit too salty.  Will cut down by 1 Tb next time.  My daughter added sriracha sauce to her bowl as an option.  Super easy, healthy and delicious.

I used half a white onion instead of green onions and olive oil because I didn’t have sesame oil. I made this recipe because my husband came home from the grocery with a bag of grated cauliflower that had an expiration date. We both really liked it.

I used 1 can of peas, drained, instead of frozen because that is what I had on hand.  In my opinion, that was too many peas for the dish.  It was less than 2 cups worth.  But then I don't like peas.  I also agree that the amount of soy sauce was too much as written in the recipe.  everything turned the same color of brown after adding all the soy sauce.  I do plan on making this again however using fewer peas and less soy sauce.  Even my husband, who swears he hates cauliflower, loved this.  He didn't know the rice was missing until I told him.

As I follow an AIP diet I had to make a few adjustments - I didn't add any eggs , I used liquid aminos  instead of soy sauce and used veggies that I had on hand.  Since I have added seeds back after AIP elimination I did season with sesame oil but used avocado oil for cooking.  I also used shredded chicken since I don't eat pork.  It was very good, although I know it would have been even better with eggs - however, my body thanks me for not including them.

Made it exactly as written except for sprinkling soy sauce on the pork as it was cooking and also on the veggies as they were cooking.  Used more soy than called for.  And added one chopped white onion to the veggies.  At the table we added Sriracha and some peanuts!  Will definitely make this again!  And I'm NOT a cauliflower lover at all!

I omitted the pork and egg, used pre-riced cauliflower, a handful of baby carrots and liquid aminos instead of soy sauce. Super easy and so good, but next time I'll use 1/2 the amount of liquid aminos as it was a little overpowering for me.

This was a good flavorful recipe. I made a few changes. I used shrimp instead of pork. I sautéd the shrimp with sesame oil, soy sauce, crushed red pepper, and half the onion. I removed the shrimp with a slotted spoon when done and added the cauliflower (about 1.5 heads) to cook in the shrimp juices to add flavor. I added the other half of the onion during cooking with the cauliflower. Also bought a frozen pea and carrot mixture. What this recipe doesn't account for is the excess water produced by the cauliflower during cooking. I had a lot of liquid at the bottom that I drained off prior to serving. It had good flavor.

Yum! The biggest change I made was to cube, season (sweet chili, soy sauce and fresh garlic) and skewer the  pork for grilling.  I also  added fresh grated ginger to the veggies and had to cook it in batches because (as others have noted) my pan was too small.  It was a big hit with my 6 teenage sons!

This was good - I will make it again. I made some changes - I used chicken instead of pork (just because that was what I had on hand), twice the garlic, a few dashes of sriracha, and way less oil and soy sauce (probably at least half as much). I also had a frozen peas and carrot blend on hand and just defrosted it in the microwave and drained the water. I added a little diced bell pepper when the directions said to add the carrots. I used vegetable oil with just a few drops of the sesame oil (because it's so strong and high such a low smoke point - I thought it might burn at such a high heat). Next time I'll add a little ginger and maybe try the pork or shrimp.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I omitted the pork as I was making this as a side with turkey meatloaf, but next time I am going to make the recipe as is. Amazing how much it was like fried rice! A keeper

I was surprised at how delicious this turned out! I made a few changes though, I did not add any meat to my dish and instead of 2 scrambled eggs, I did three. I also added hot sauce to my dish and seasoned it with salt free Mrs DAsh seasoning. I've made it several times and it tastes Better each time! Also, for my fellow meal preppers, this stays fresh for the entire week if stored in the fridge!

Loved this dish. Used regular oil for the cooking and added some sesame oil at the end before serving for additional flavor. Added peas last and also cooked eggs first before adding. I will make this again. Well worth the effort.

This was surprisingly good - my first experience with cauliflower "rice".  I shredded the cauliflower in my food processor and used a large wok to cook the dish.  I used 1 lb shredded pork since that's what I had on hand and added red pepper flakes and grated garlic and ginger.  I used 1/2 onion instead of the green onion.  When I make again (and I will), I will use less pork/more cauliflower, and maybe one more egg.

Wow Wow WOW! I used half the amount of soy sauce (i didn't have low sodium) and chicken instead of pork and it was AMAZING! The consistency and flavor of the dish was so spot on and surpassed my fried rice cravings! I'm making it again next week at my boyfriends request and he is not the fondest of cauliflower by any means so that says a lot too!

I'm not a huge fan of peas, so would probably add less next time.  Could also use more soy sauce.

It's good, but not great. A lot of effort for what you get.

I was surprised at how good this recipe turned out, considering it was a stir fry with cauliflower.  I used some leftover carnitas and cooked the peas in the microwave.  Since I roughly cut the carrot, I sauteed it for five minutes first and then added the onion.  So good!

Yummy! I used olive oil to cook and only top with the toasted sesame oil. I marinated the cubed pork in some toasted sesame oil, fresh chopped ginger, and a chopped garlic clove for about an hour while I prepared the meal. I added celery, chopped water chestnuts, some rice, and I cooked eggs in separate pan. I added peas at the end.

This was good. I did add 2 celery stalks and 8 oz of mushrooms to the carrots and onions. I also added 1/2 tsp of Chinese five spice to give it a bigger kick. I also cut the oil in half. Just didn't need that much oil.

I used cooked chicken, so was able to eliminate the step of cooking the meat.  Also, I didn't precook the peas as described in the recipe (just rinsed them and threw them in frozen) -- they were nice and fresh tasting that way.  I didn't really notice the flavor of the sesame oil, and have since read that it looses its flavor at high temps.  Next time I will cook the dish in a high smoke-point oil like peanut or olive oil, then splash on some sesame oil at the end for flavor.  I'll also add some ginger or other spices.  Considering the carbs and calories saved by using cauliflower instead of rice, this recipe is a keeper!

This was delicious and my 22 year old son ate 2 huge servings!  Rather than pork, I used chicken marinated in a teriyaki sauce. Also, I added some diced yellow onion to the carrot, green onion and garlic sauté step. Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter.   We have started looking for cauliflower substituted meals and haven't been disappointed yet. Will definitely be cooking this one again. Thanks!

I love this recipe.  I had some leftover roast beef, so I used it instead of the pork.  I only added a touch more soy sauce.  I will definitely make this again, next time using the pork.  Great recipe, and it was my first time using cauliflower instead of rice!  My husband was a little skeptical of the cauliflower, but he loved it too!  Awesome!

I just knew from the ingredients that this dish was going to yummy. Yummy it is! I omitted the meat this time, but next time I make this dish I'll add  chicken. Using  pulse on my food processor was a quick and easy way  to prepare the califlower.

Love this recipe! I always find myself tweaking a bit depending on what we have on hand but it serves as a perfect base. We eat cauliflower rice at least once a week & have made this with shrimp, chicken, pork as well as meatless with extra eggs! Enjoy!

My cauliflower was a bit over processed so I added two eggs and about 2 tablespoons ground flaw seed.  Placed the cauliflower in the pan by itself and flattened it so it would brown quickly and  not be so mealy.  After cooking the cauliflower was more chunky looking.  Added the other prepared ingredients and it looked great!  The cauliflower was a bit darker because of the flax.

This is really good and I will make it again.  Very easy to adapt to vegetarian.  I reduced the sesame oil to a tsp and added this and ginger to the soy sauce.  I used 1 tbsp of peanut oil to fry the pork and the veggies.  A word of caution:  I thought I was clever by prepping the cauliflower ahead of time and freezing it.  Bad idea!  It thawed to the consistency of a slushy snowball and I had to bake in the oven to dry it out.  This recipe also is not good left over so eat it when you make it.  The cauliflower gets a little funky.

Very dry.  I added a good amount of teriyaki sauce to give it some more flavor and help thin it out along with 1/2 cup of water, and then hubby dumped some additional Oriental sauce on his when I served it.  I also put a lid over my pan to allow the cauliflower to steam a bit.

Simmered the carrots with the peas. Doubles the recipe so ended up scrambling eggs in a separate side skillet and then incorporating.  Some of our less attentive guests didn't even know it wasn't rice.  It was delicious and we will make this a side dish staple at our house!

Made a few adjustments to our taste like the oil used, the  veggies and I used an Asian seasoning by McCormick. My husband thought it was rice until I told him. I will be making again.

This was so tasty and super easy to make!  As someone who has to eat low carb and stick to relatively low gluten meals, i was super excited to try something new! Veggies and chicken is only great for so long. I recommend it to anyone! Cauliflower is a great substitute for rice!

We loved this recipe!  We did the whole head of cauliflower and I added some sprouts as other suggested.  It was the perfect amount of soy sauce.  We also cooked with coconut oil instead of sesame and it gave it quite a nice taste.  We will definitely make this again!

This is my favorite way to eat cauliflower!  I am giving 4 stars because I have not tried this with pork  as written, as I do not eat pork. What I love is that you can use the basic recipe as a guide and add any ingredients that are handy, and it is always delicious. I always make this as a vegetarian meal, sometimes with tofu, sometime with veggie chicken strips. The best version involves marinating cubed firm tofu in a mixture of miso paste, rice wine vinegar, and soy sauce for about 20 minutes, then sauté the tofu cubes in peanut or canola oil mixed with a splash of hot sesame oil, sliced onion and minced garlic. Remove the tofu mixture, add more oil and cook whatever vegetables you want, then add the grated cauliflower and season with soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, black pepper. When all is mixed well add the tofu mixture back to the wok, add the egg, stir fry a bit and you have a fantastic one pot meal. A bit of fresh basil or cilantro adds a nice touch if you have any.

I didn't really make any changes apart from using whatever veggies and meat I had on hand as the garnish for the "rice". I feel like you could add anything you want to this dish depending on your taste. The cauliflower was truly a fantastic substitute for real rice. My kids ate it right up without a word and were shocked when I told them it wa not rice only cauliflower! My husband who absolutely loves fried rice loved this dish equally, and of course so did I! I will make this dish over and over again. The cauliflower is just a rice substitute so go nuts and make it your own, with your own sauce blend and veggies you like. Try this recipe if you haven't already, you will be pleasantly surprised.  Two thumbs WAY up !!!

I made this vegan by subbing mushrooms for the pork and chia egg for the egg. I also omitted the onions and carrots because my daughter doesn't like those specific veges and is vegan lol! It turned out delicious!

Used low sodium soy sauce to taste, used garlic infused olive oil for frying and added sesame oil for flavor as well as pepper. while  prepping vegetables I marinated the pork in Trader Joes Soyaki.  Added mushrooms rather than carrots, and fried onion with the pork. I bought riced cauliflower which saved time. In the past I used the grater to "rice" the head of cauliflower. Shortened frying times to avoid the mushiness I experienced the last time I made this recipe which was   with chicken. Next time I'll try using ginger and the garlic in the oil when frying the pre-marinated meat. I like bold flavors and thus far have not found the tastes I'd like with this recipe.  As others have done, I cooked the eggs separately and added them to the mixture as a last step. Rated a 4 because I want bolder flavor and haven't figured that part out YET. Thanks for a great no carb recipe. Enjoying "fried rice" again! :)

This is one of the best substitution recipes I have made. We could barely tell it was cauliflower and not rice. For starters, I would only make this recipe if I had a food processor. It makes grating the cauliflower super fast. To make things even easier, I used frozen peas and carrots and added them at the end. No fresh carrots. Also used tamari sauce instead of soy sauce to make it gluten free.

Easy and delicious, I used  cauliflower rice that I purchased from Trader Joe's. I didn't measure the soy sauce. I just added a little at a time until it was to my liking.

Make sure you don't crowd the wok or skillet you use to stirfry. We added a little bacon, onion, red pepper, snow peas, ginger and garlic. Delicious and so healthy! My husband who isn't a veggie lover says it's a keeper.

Really good. Husband hates peas so used celery and extra carrots instead. Halved the soy sauce, added ginger and used 3 eggs. My husband doesn't like cauliflower and didn't know it was in there until I told him. He wants me to make it again with shrimp next time!

A little time intensive but always comes out great.  I have substituted the pork for tofu (most of the time) and veggie meatballs (trader joes) and Canadian bacon. All came out great (4 or 5 times).

I was a little nervous about this going in, but it was a big hit! The family didn't even notice the cauliflower . The only thing that gives it away is a slightly different texture than rice. Taste is great. I used half a yellow onion in place of the green. I also fried the pork with garlic and soy sauce to make it more flavorful.

I got so full off of 1/2 a bowl that I didn't want seconds.  my 9 year old went back for seconds.... my husband ate all of his.  And to top it off my 1 year old daughter even ate.. it.. I made it last week, and im making it again...

This was great! I tweaked it a little by substituting edemame for peas, using chicken instead of pork, and added red pepper and red onion while cooking the carrots. I also used a spicy asian sauce instead of soy sauce. The texture was very similar to rice, but without the extra carbs. Next time I'm going to try it with shrimp.

If you go into this knowing it's cauliflower, it's pretty good. It can't compare to fried rice, but I suppose the main ingredients are different, so that makes sense.

Loved this recipe!!! Something very different than I normally eat but I couldn't get enough. Next time I will probably use less soy sauce and maybe throw in some extra veggies with maybe chicken and shrimp.

Hubby and I loved this, however prep took me quite a while.  Used leftover pork tenderloin, and added shrimp and Chinese 5  Spice.  Just added the frozen peas when cooking first step.  Followed everything else.  Will make it again for sure.

I used fresh ground pork sausage and poured the egg mixture right on top of food while stir frying, this way it bonds to the ingredients better.

I would give this 6 stars, if that was an option!  This is a great recipe - I have made this 3 times in the last couple of weeks.  I modified the recipe by using cut up hot sausages in place of the pork - it gives a great flavor to the "rice."

I thought this recipe was great.  I didn't use pork because I am vegetarian, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely.  I cut portions to make this for two, used regular onions instead of green because that is what I had.  I also added the eggs to the wok with some oil first, cooked them thoroughly, then removed.  No need to cook the frozen peas first, I just added them for the last few minutes of cooking in the work.  Filling and much healthier than fried rice...this one is a keeper.

I changed up a few things to clean out leftovers.  Regular onion, ribeye, and carrots.  The recipe came out great.  I was skeptical it would be a rice substitute but I was wrong. My wife who hates cauliflower even liked it. She doesn't like when I trick her though.

I used chicken instead of pork.  I am not a pea eater so next time I will probably use less peas.  Very easy to make.

I followed many of the other suggestions. This dish was excellent with shrimp. I quickly shredded cauliflower in my ninja blender with ease. My version serves no more than 4 with 2 cups of shrimp, 1 head of cauliflower, 2 carrots, 4 eggs. Also increased garlic to 4 cloves + 2 more cloves + ginger to season oil for veggies and shrimp. Added 2T rice vinegar to cauliflower and only used 4T Bragg (soy) sauce. Added 1/2 onion to cauliflower. You can use this as a base for many variations but the point here is that you can eat fried rice without rice, and I think it tastes better! I don't think the cauliflower is detectable at all.

Made this last night for my mom and myself.  One taste and mom says "You should make this at least once a week!"  It was that good.  I had cauliflower (of course) but otherwise used what I had on hand.  I had a roasted chicken, yellow squash, green squash, green onions, garlic and a carrot.  So, I spiralized the squash and carrots and stir-fried the veggies together with the cauliflower.  Sauted the garlic  and chicken with a little grape seed oil and the sesame oil ~ and mixed it with the veggies once they were almost al dente.  Scrambled the eggs in the same pan that I sauteed the chicken in and added it last.  Really, really good recipe.

I felt it needed more salt, even after the soy sauce.  It was tasty, though.  Will definitely make again.

P.S.  Don't even bother with the grater, unless that's what you have.  Use a food processor with the grating attachment.  So much easier and faster.

Yummy. I've always wanted to try cauliflower as a substitute for rice. I used my blender on the cauliflower and it worked great!!

This recipe has wiggle room. I used olive oil instead of sesame.  I didn't have green onion, used white onion - delicious. Only 4 tbsp soy sauce is PLENTY salty and flavorful. I also added a bit of cayenne pepper. I will definitely be using this as a base recipe  again and again! Thank you!

My family is on a big diet, so we decided to make this dish. It was really good and tasted similar to fried rice, but the recipient didn't call for enough food for the four of us. It says it makes 6 servings, but I guess it makes 6 servings to be eaten with other sides, which we didn't because it already has protein and vegetables, which is what is on our diet. All and all it was a very good recipie, but I will be making more next time!!!

Delicious! I used canned peas instead of frozen. I also roasted garlic in coconut oil and then added chicken instead of pork. My son didn't notice it wasn't rice. :) I'm doing this again in the future!

This was a great recipe I served for New Years dinner with Lobster Thermidor and spiral ham. I used coconut oil to fry the pork and added fresh shrimp as well. After cooking I added about 2 teaspoons of sesame oil for flavor. I also seasoned the pork lightly before frying to give some flavor. This will be a new favorite in my house!

Delicious! We were skeptical at first, but had a lot of fun prepping and cooking this dish... and then eating it up! Substituted marinated teriyaki chicken for the pork and added bean sprouts. Next time will add water chestnuts too. Thank you for the tasty recipe!

Great recipe except for the amount of soy sauce it calls for, I can't even imagine putting all that in. I adjusted according to taste. I think it's also good to make sure the cauliflower pieces are not too big.

Really good recipe.  Only change that I made was to use chicken instead of pork and marinate it in soy sauce and sesame oil prior to cooking.  My husband loved it and said it should be added to my regular rotation.  Is a little labor intensive if you don't have a food processor, but with one, it's done in a minute.

I would reduce the amount of Soy sauce or use a reduced sodium blend, little too salty for me. All in all a great recipe, satisfies the fried rice cravings in "diabetic me"

I was doubtful this was as good as everyone said, but it was!!! I cut the recipe in 1/2 for just the two of us and still had leftovers.  I also used leftover roast chicken instead of pork and I broke down the cauliflower in the food processor instead of shredding.  Looking forward to trying it with shrimp.

This dish is awesome for anyone watching carbs.  I'm a rice lover so this was a great alternative.  Agree with some other reviews.  I'd cut down the soy, maybe even in half.  I used cut turkey breast from the night before so any protein will do.  Also used different veggies as carrots and peas are not part of my diet. Unfortunately do not have a food processor so blending cauliflower was a real challenge.  Going to buy one now just for future!!

Marinated 2 c cubed pork in sesame oil, T soy, minced garlic, and minced ginger.  Cooked peas in the microwave.  Used 2 large carrots, a whole yellow onion, 3-4 cloves of garlic, and a whole head of cauliflower.  Cut the soy down to 1/4 c.  Will use 4 eggs next time.

Make sure you use a huge skillet! There was a lot of meat in relation to cauliflower which my husband loved but I personally felt like it was a bit too much meat. Great topped with Sriracha!

Will definitely make this again. I didn't have green onions or carrots, so I just ommited the carrots and used yellow onions. I also added just a slosh of soy sauce to mine (i just now noticed I was supposed to anyway... I definitely didn't do 6 Tbsp...) because I thought it needed more of an oriental taste without the carrots in it. It was absolutely delicious! My husband even said he couldn't tell it was cauliflower.

I LOVED this recipe. It was delicious. Few changes I made were using chicken instead of pork and using olive oil  instead of sesame seed oil but otherwise I followed the directions. Very easy and yummy. I used the food processor to shred cauliflower to save myself some work. I will definitely use this again and again and again!!!!!

Delicious!  I kept this vegetarian and couldn't believe how good it was. I would have never guessed this was cauliflower!

Great recipe for people on a low-carb diet! We added kimchi for some kick.

I used low sodium soy sauce and it was still a bit salty with 6 tablespoons, but otherwise very good.  It fooled my husband. He thought it had rice in it.

This dish was incredible!   I used coconut oil instead of sesame because it is trendy (lol!)  and drizzled some sesame oil at the end,  it was delish!  I love it!   thanks for sharing!

Great recipe and super easy.  It makes a ton of food so its great for a group. Next time I will marinate the pork and add sesame seeds as others have suggested for more flavor.

Very good recipe with a few changes. First, I added minced garlic, minced ginger and red pepper flake to the meat to give it some more flavor. It was also way too salty so I cut back to about 4 tablespoons of soy sauce. Added chopped broccoli and some chopped water chestnuts for extra crunch. The cauliflower was taking a long time to cook (my pan was really full) so I added about 1/2 cup of chicken stock and covered the pan to let it steam which worked really well. I also added some siracha at the end for even more flavor. This is a 5 with these changes!

Yummy! I added Brussels sprouts (2 cups total for peas and Brussels sprouts mix) and cayenne pepper. This was easy, delicious and satisfying!

Its time consuming shredding the califlower but maybe thats cause i have a tiny grater. This was very good, and surprisingly filling. Good as a main dish or a side.
