I made a 100 hundred changes to this recipe , it was delicious and the credit goes entirely to this recipe. Someday I hope to make it with the ingredients mentioned. I used spaghetti instead of egg noodles (we are not fond of egg noodles) , apple instead of water chestnuts, regular corn instead of the ones mentioned. I licked the bowl clean. I had used vegetarian gyozas. Thanks a ton for this recipe.

This was pretty good. I used fresh Chinese egg noodles and I could not find vegetable potstickers so I used chicken. I did think there was something lacking but I couldn't put my finger on it. There is a lot going on so I am not really sure what could be missing. Maybe a few drops of sesame oil to help coat the noodles? I'll definitely make this one again and just play around with it a little.

sooooo tasty...I substituted sweet potato noodles for the  egg noodles.   And I had some left over chicken that I included.   This will be a recipe that will be used again.

I made this with seafood mushrooms and snow peas instead of carrots and corn, also I used Chinese egg noddles too. We loved it.
