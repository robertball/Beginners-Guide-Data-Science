We really enjoyed this.  I added half a sliced banana, some mango and a handful of almond slices.  I made and dressed the salad mid morning to use mid afternoon, giving all the fruits to meld with the dressing.  When I opened the container the smell of tequila was pretty strong, but it really isn't strong as you eat it.  I used Sauza (r) Blue tequila and it was just perfect.  This will be featured at many summer functions.  Thanks, becchoate!

I happen to love margaritas and watermelon, so I decided to give this a try.  It was delicious.  Since I like my margarita with salt, I sprinkled a little salty Cotija cheese to taste just before serving.
