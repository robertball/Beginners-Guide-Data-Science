Used these as an appetizer for Thanksgiving. We loved them. I left off the oregano - because I was out. And I added a quartered marinated artichoke heart to each stick. Then I drizzled them with Ken's Lite Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing. Num num! Thank you for sharing!

I had some extra Greek Salad dressing and opted to marinade the feta cheese overnight before assembly .... WOW!  So good!

This is a super idea that I used for a recent dinner party.
Make sure to cut your feta cubes large-ish as they crumble easily as you thread them on a skewer. My guests loved them!

6.15.17  This is really delicious finger food (two bites), and soooo easy to make.  And yes, it does taste like a Greek salad even without the dressing.  No changes or modifications necessary, these bad boys are good!

I whisked together some olive oil and balsamic vinegar and drizzled it over the top. Rave revues!

Don't care for the dried oregano.  Combination of ingredients is tasty but half the time the cheese broke when piercing with toothpick.
