Made as written and this turned out pretty good. I definitely recommend adding more steak sauce, worcestershire, and ranch powder. The recipe does not state where to add the salt so I am assuming it was to the onions. Dipping out all of the mushrooms was time consuming. I do not see the point of dipping them out. I added them all back in the gravy in the end so if I were to make this again, I'd leave them in from the beginning. Overall this was a good recipe but I do think it could be simplified some.

Quite delicious. The ranch dressing, steak sauce & Worcestershire sauce give the gravy a nice tangy flavor that the mushrooms absorb.

Loved this. I would add more mushrooms. I didnâ€™t have steak sauce so I used bbq sauce and Dijon mustard. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I didn't have any ranch so I left that out. Instead of steak sauce I put about a tablespoon of Better than Bouillion (beef). It was a super easy, super delicious recipe.
