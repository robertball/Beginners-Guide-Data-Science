I rinsed & patted dry tilapia filets, gave them a light dusting of flour & pan-fried them in EVOO infused w/ garlic. After plating them, I poured the sauce over top & garnished w/ parsley ... served them w/ Garlic Broccoli Spears w/ Mango Sorbet for dessert. Most of the vanilla flavor cooked off out of the sauce so next time I will add another tsp. near the finish of the cooking time. I used white wine vinegar instead of champagne & I used a pinot grigio. I ahve made a similiar sauce to this before & served it over lobster ravioli, which was very good. Great recipe...thanks McCormick!
