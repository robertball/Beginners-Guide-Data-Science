This is so delicious I have made it several times. I cook the beans first, then add the other ingredients.  I use my slow cooker instead of the oven to finish off the recipe. 
This is my go to recipe for Boston Baked Beans!

I made a couple alterations.  One was accidental.  I accidentally cooked the beans completely before baking for one hour.  I doubled the recipe.  I used salt pork instead of bacon (diced and fried.)  It was fabulous!

Not Boston beans like I'm used to.  The flavor was not bad, but the consistency was off.  I increased the recipe by 50%, to 9 servings, but it was a TON of beans.  I served it at a party with about 20 or so people but I was left with more than half of it. I usually love Chef John's recipes, but alas, we can't be on the same page all the time.

Great. I cooked the beans in the pressure cooker first for about 20 minutes. I also precooked the bacon. Easy and cheap.

So simple, yet tasty!  My family of 7 gobbled it up.  I made a couple of changes, omitted the bay leaf (simply because I was out), and added 1T of Worcestershire. I then proceeded to make this in a slow cooker. I rinsed the beans then let them soak over night. Then, simply drained, added roughly 6 cups water, and added all the ingredients. I put the slow cooker on high for about 7 or 8 hours. (until beans are tender).  Simple!!

Wow. Not sure I can type and shovel these in my mouth at the same time but Wow! This is just the recipe I was looking for. I didn't make any changes to the recipe, but I did cook the beans for 45 minutes longer (too juicy) and then did the 30 min at 350 with the lid off, as the recipe states. 

For those who want these beans less sweet, keep the molasses as is but just add a TBLE of brown sugar instead of a 1/4 cup. My family loves this recipe! A keeper!

I didn't like these, unfortunately.  I'm from New England, and grew up eating homemade baked beans.  The flavor was good, but not what I remember.  These were perfectly fine beans, just a touch mealy, but I prefer beans with tomato, Worcestershire sauce, more pronounced molasses and mustard flavors.  My mom always taught me to cook beans with a pinch of baking soda and a bay leaf, so those made me smile.  As I said, these were good, but just not the Boston baked beans that are served in Boston.

Beans and sauce came out  fantastic! Did a double batch for a club banquet and they were a hit. Glad I reserved a portion for myself before I put them out - they were gone in minutes!

I will definitely be doing these again. Chef John, you're the best!

Gave this recipe a delicious twist.  Cooked it as a "one-pot" meal and substituted twice smoked pork chops, 5 of them, for the bacon/salt pork.  Delete any added salt, as there was plenty in the chops.  Completely delicious! Serve chops and beans together.

First time I ever made homemade beans and it came out great. Followed the recipe until it was time to bake the beans. I used a Pyrex baking dish to bake the beans and it worked great. Served the beans with bbq ribs and they were a hit. Will not fear making homemade beans again.

Really delicious, I used Splenda instead of brown sugar because of dietary issues with some friends.  Used more molasses and replaced dry mustard with dijon.

Cannot accurately rate via the stars as I didn't have a dutch oven to transfer to.  I transferred to crock pot instead and beans didn't finish by the time the rest of the meal was ready.  Obviously, I'll be trying this again!!!

Took beans twice as much time to cook. And for all the time, it wasn’t very good. Maybe I did Something wrong. Chef John is usually spot on.

I’ve made these twice. I’ve found I only have to cover with liquid once, then cook them covered on 350 degrees for 2hrs, stirring once. Then bake uncovered for 30mins. I only had light brown sugar, so I’ll use dark next time. Best made one day in advance so the flavors blend.

Easy to make and tastes delicious. It does take time to prepare, mostly due to soaking the beans, but it is worth the wait! My guests were returning for seconds!!

I altered the recipe a bit, pre-cooking the bacon, adding 1t. garlic powder, about 1/4c. each of ketchup (yes, I did!) and maple syrup, and subbing the bay leaf with a little sage (maybe 1/2-1t.).  The first time I did the recipe, I used cranberry beans instead of navy, and the second time, I used the crockpot instead of the oven.  Just as a note, cranberry beans took WAY longer to soak and cook than the navy beans did.

These were a huge hit at my house both times.  The flavor and texture is out of this world...WAY better than any other baked beans I've ever had and perfect with homemade cornbread.  This recipe was my first go at baked beans (I grew up hating beans) and I found Chef John did it again!  Every time I look over his recipes, I realize we cook much the same way and his recipes always go over well at my table.  Kudos Chef John!

Made it for dinner party.  Everyone loved it!  Didn't want to heat up the house while the AC was running overtime, so cooked it in a crock pot on low for 4 hours, then finished it in a 350 oven as the recipe states.  Cheated and used canned navy beans - (4) 16 oz cans, reserving the liquid.  After mixing the rest of the ingredients, poured in enough reserved liquid to cover the beans.  They dried out quite a bit in the oven, so I think I will add a cup more of the liquid next time, because I will definitely make them again!

I followed this recipe to a tee. It was scrumptious and did not have any ketchup in it. Who in the world puts ketchup in Boston Baked beans, no one. Chef John, I plan on trying many of your other recipes in the near future.

I think this recipe is a good start, although a little bland. I used sea salt in the amount the recipe states, and ended up using about 1/2-3/4 teaspoon more at the end for our liking. I also found it needed a little more brown sugar - about 2 tablespoons. 
I cooked this in the slow cooker after the 10 minute stove top cook, because it's too hot to use the oven.  I cooked on low for the first 4 hours, then high for the last 4, and found the flavor was just starting to develop and deepen. I will try this in the oven, as I'm sure the flavor would be better.

Excellent - had to cook an additional hour (live at 5000 feet). Did initial cooking until browning step; let sit until dinner. Cooked 30 minutes at 350 for final cooking.

This is the first time at making baked beans.  This recipe was on point.  The only thing I would do for large crowds is double the recipe.  Really delicious, received many compliments.

I read where many people have changed this recipe - Why? I made it exactly as per the recipe and I cannot imagine it any better.

Just kidding, I will make some adjustments later but this will always be the mother of beans

This recipe was a good one but I did a couple of substitutions. Instead of brown sugar I added maple syrup and also 1-1 1/2 tsp Chili powder and instead of bacon I use smoked pork hocks. I make them in my slow cooker on slow and (call me crazy) but i do them over 2 days (20 hours total) switching out one cooked pork hock after 10 hours and putting in another for the other 10. The meat is stripped and put in the fridge from the first one to shred into the final product. I also poach eggs to put on top - serve with a salad and it’s a complete meal! So good!!

I might have messed up in doubling the recipe, but the sauce was a bit thin despite a good twelve hours in the crockpot. the taste was spot on though. I'm cooking down the liquid overnight; they'll be better tomorrow. I followed the recipe exactly with no additions, substitutions or deletions. The mode of heat differed; no oven on today as it's hot and muggy here near Boston. - near Boston and full o' beans.
Having made this a second time, I'd substitute salt pork for the bacon and cut into lardon size pieces before cooking. I only used a portion of the salt pork and it worked much better. As it was when I was a kid, I saw people searching for the little giblets of salt pork while hoisting spoonfuls of the beans into the gullet.

I've made this several times. The first time I followed the recipe to the tee and the feedback was that they were too sweet. The next time I substituted maple syrup for brown sugar and still seemed too sweet. The last few times I've eliminated the brown sugar altogether and instead of catsup I use Heinz Chili Sauce. This adds a little "bite" to it. also have used bits of salt pork instead of bacon because that's what my mother used. 
I think these get better after a day or so and a couple of re-heats. 
Next time I'm going to try it in the slow cooker only so I don't have to watch it.

As at least one other has stated my 'go to' recipe for baked beans.
For personal taste, I added 1 Tbsp chili flakes, a dash of liquid smoke, and 1.5 Tbsp pure apple cider vinegar.
     While barbecuing/smoking supper, and feeling adventurous, I added a foil pan  containing Chef John's recipe, and used hickory blocks to add smoke flavor - Excellent !!

A bit disappointed. Made it exactly as written.  It was ok. Definitely missing something. Since I'm not a fan of ketchup etc I was really hoping it would be better.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  I did use my large cast iron skillet with lid in the oven.  Be sure to check and add the cooking liquid from the beans when needed or they will dry out too much.  This recipe is absolutely fabulous.  Yum!  Thanks again, Chef John!

Makes about 6 cups. I've made this recipe several times now. I'm not really sure what value the pinch of baking soda is, but I add it anyway. (If you've run out of it though, I don't think you'll miss it.) I've baked them as per the directions, and have also slow-cooked them on Low for 6-8 hours. Either way, they're delicious. They also freeze well. 
Update: this latest time, I substituted sliced-up breakfast sausage for the bacon, and also borrowed from a South African recipe and added a tsp of curry powder. Also delish.

For some reason this didn't seem five star.  Maybe I'm too used to canned baked beans and bbq flavor and not used enough to the earthy, natural, bean taste.  I did like that it didn't use ketchup or bbq sauce.  I used the crockpot for Step 3 since I didn't have a dutch oven.  My first time making baked beans.  Not bad.  They all got eaten! Thanks.
