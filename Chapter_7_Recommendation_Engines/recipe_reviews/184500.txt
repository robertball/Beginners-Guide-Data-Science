This bread needs a lot of tweaking in my opinion.  I know ovens are different, so 325 might work in someone else's oven, but this did not work in mine at all.  350 for an hour could've worked, but 325 for an hour--forget about it!  It had to bake for 1 1/2 hours before this bread came clean and was finally done.  If I try this again, I'll do 350 and check at 45 minutes.  It came out chewier than I like, and I think those cherries need coated in flour before going in the batter.  They all sank to the bottom. I'd also cut up the cherries next time--I don't think the recipe said to do that, did it?  Bf and I also didn't think  the bread had much cherry flavor except when you bit into a cherry.  I'd nix the milk and do the 1/2 c of cherry juice for a total of 3/4 c of cherry juice.  If I try this again, I'll do my tweaks and see what I think.  Thanks for the recipe!

I too had problems with this recipe. I did all the recipe said but I cut up the cherries and baked at 350 instead of 325. It took 1 1/2hours to bake and because of the long baking time it turned out to be a brick. I was very disappointed in this recipe.

i don't think it had much of a cherry taste, it also took more than an hour to cook it looked a little burnt and i had trouble mixing the shortening it didn't mix well.

This was the first time I baked with cherries, so I appreciated the tips by other reviewers. I used dried cherries and boiled them. Then refrigerated them overnight. When baking, I coated them in flour. I used almond extract instead of vanilla. While mixing, I separated the dry ingredients from the wet, and gradually added the dry to the wet--I didn't make the well. I baked for 1 hour at 350°. This recipe was a good introduction to baking with cherries.

I made this once as recipe said, and the result was notso----
I tried a second time with a few tweaks and it was "THE BOMB".
I changed the cherries to dried cherries that I plumped and let soak for a day in the fridge.
Changed the vanilla to almond extract, added 1/2 cup more cherries and tossed the cherries in the flour mixture to coat
to keep them from falling to the bottom.
OMG!! what a difference those little changes made.  My grandson ( who does NOT like cakes or breads, asked for a second piece)  Very happy with the outcome. oh, and I added Almonds to the top for extra texture.
Bake at 350 for about an hour for regular loaf, about 40 minutes for mini loaf

This was a seemingly easy bread. However that being said, it did not turn out like I thought. It tasted great, but was too much for one loaf. I will have to try again and use 2 pans to see how it turns out next time. It tasted great, not very pretty.
