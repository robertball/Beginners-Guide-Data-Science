I made the "chia pudding" portion of this "Raspberry Chia Pudding" adapting it to what I had on hand and my own personal taste just to test the recipe ratios to compare to other recipes for chai pudding. This chai pudding taste really good. I used: AROY-D coconut milk in the box (not the can, which is a less-sweet and less-flavorful coconut milk ); SO FRESH unsweetened cashew milk instead of rice milk; and 1 tablespoon honey instead of 2 tablespoons of maple syrup. Yum! Thank you Utzy Naturals for sharing your recipe. I think the ratios are pretty good.

This is delicious and easy! I substituted the maple syrup with brown rice syrup due to temp diet restriction. I am making with maple syrup next time.

I LOVE the recipe for not using sugar. I substituted almond milk as I didn't have any rice milk on hand -- tasted great! It was a perfect way to use fresh-picked raspberries and still avoid sugar. The double-crunchiness of the chia seeds and the raspberry seeds takes a little getting used to -- "seedy," says my husband. :-)

This one of the best chia pudding recipes I have tried yet, though I think the super delicious brand of coconut milk that I used this time (Vita Coco Original) made a difference. I used almond milk in lieu of rice milk.

While I love sprinkling berries on my chia pudding, this recipe's chia berry layer is especially delicious and makes for a lovely and delicious breakfast, snack, or dessert treat.  (Basically, you can eat this anytime!)

Interesting texture. I used almond milk instead of rice. I'm not a fan of maple, so next time I'll use agave. Thank you for the recipe.
