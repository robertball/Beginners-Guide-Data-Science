These are perfect for us who monitar our carbs and give us more tasty options for staying gluten free! Since my Lakanto Monkfruit syrup is like using liquid gold, I replaced the maple syrup with 1/2 teaspoon of organic maple extract,and 1 1/2 Tablespoon of Swerve brown sugar substitute. I used the maple Monkfruit syrup on the almond pancakes after they were finished.  Delicious Chief John! I am happy that you're interested in healthier foods.;)

Delicious! I used almond flour vs almond meal, since that is what I had on hand. The end result was thinner, less fluffy pancakes. However, they were still very flavorful and delicious! I'm going to grab some almond meal and try these again. 
Once again, another amazing recipe from the king himself, Chef John.

Delicious, tasty and easy. They do not bubble up like regular on the uncooked side, so I cooked them on low as to not burn them (the saying is true with the first pancake). Will be using this recipe over and over!

I couldn't wait to give these a try, so we had them for tonight's dessert. I could taste they are made with almond flour, and they were pretty good. My 12 yo is a pancake snob, she mentioned they were a bit too thick, so I may thin them out with a bit of almond milk next time. I used avocado oil, instead of olive oil, it's what I had on hand. I topped mine with bananas, walnuts and maple syrup...I had a good time. Will certainly make them again...trying desperately to get my family off of w flour. Thanks Chef

I followed this recipe without making changes, and it turned out well! The pancakes do burn easily, so make sure to keep it on medium heat or lower. I served it with pecans and maple syrup - delicious!

I had Hodgson Mill almond flour/meal on hand to use.  The results tasted good, a bit grainy for pancakes and the color was much darker than the picture.  Topped with butter and a few strawberries and I was a happy camper looking for lower carb alternatives.

These pancakes were quick and easy to make.  However, I  used butter to fry them, and the butter burned quickly.  I wouldn't use butter again.  The pancakes are slightly sweet and very good.  There is no almond taste to them, and that surprised me.  The recipe makes about 3 pancakes.
