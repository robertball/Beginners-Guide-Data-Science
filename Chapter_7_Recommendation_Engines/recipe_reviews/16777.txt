Good recipe.  I used the entire can of apricots and juice in this recipe. The juice gave it enough liquid for it to knead properly.  The yeast loved all the sugar and made the bread rise to the top of the bread machine lid.  I would also roast the nuts to give it a nuttier flavor.

The recipe didn't indicate if we should add the syrup from the can as well. I added all the syrup, and dough was too wet. The bread smelt yummy tho'. Will try again without the syrup. 

Tried again, cannot make it?!

made a few changes in process... first pureed apricots with liquid, did not use wheat gluten, used regular yeast, did not have rapid rise, and (as directed from my bread machine instructions) added tablespoons of flour to mix while bread machine mixed until the dough was a proper consistency. Added nuts as directed in recipe, then removed dough from machine let rise for 2 hours before baking. Took a little less time to bake in regular oven at 350 than in the bread machine, but I like a horizontal loaf better than a vertical one anyway. Good recipe, thank you.

This gets 5 stars for taste but...I had to stand over the machine adding juice/flour till I got the right consistancy.  It does need the juice but not the whole can.  I toasted the almonds.  Next time I will add dried apricot bits to pump up the flavor.

This recipe did not indicate what to do with the apricot juice. I didn't add any of it and the bread did not turn out at all. Smelled good, but, couldn't eat it.
