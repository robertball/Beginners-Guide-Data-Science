I marinaded this for about 7-8 hours and my chicken tasted great and was so juicy. This one is a keeper!

This is a great marinade! I made as directed and marinated my chicken breast over night. Grilled the chicken and it was tender moist and very flavorful!

Full disclosure, I used orange juice instead of lime juice, because that's what I had in the house. I marinated it for about 24 hours and it came out great! 
I never use soy sauce because I generally find it's too salty, so I was concerned how this would come out. But all the flavors melded together well and there were nice subtle hints of cinnamon and rum.
Next time I might try a third clove of garlic and a bit more hot sauce (I used sriracha)...I might also consider using ginger paste instead of ginger powder...Only because I like big flavor, and though this was good, I'd like to see how it might turn out with these changes.
