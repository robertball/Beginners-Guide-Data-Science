My husband loved it, the only change I made was using minced garlic ( didn't have cloves) and some cayenne pepper. We like it hot. Will make again. I think next time I'll make a large batch and can it for a delicious side anytime.

It is a bit bland. It reminds me of that fat burning cabbage soup. I added some rice and a few more seasons to my bowl which helped. Good for those on a diet because of the low calories which is a plus.
