I was making this for only 4, so I used only a turnip and a sweet potato. Used white grape juice because I had it on hand; microwave 5 minutes in the juice because I was short on time, then roasted it â€“ WONDERFUL!  I wanted to dress it up a little, so I added half an onion (wedged) and several sprigs of rosemary and roasted until onion was done.  This really gave it piazza and more variety to the flavor.  My father-in-law (who is not at all adventuresome with food) loved it and asked my mother-in-law to get the recipe!

This was great. I did change the preparation method, however: I tossed all of the vegetable cubes in olive oil and roasted them for about half an hour while I reduced the apple cider & wine. I added the cider-wine glaze to the pans and roasted an additional 15 minutes or so, until the glaze caramelized and any extra liquid had evaporated. I didn't use the butter, since I'd used olive oil for roasting. It looks like a ton when you're making it, but I think the number of servings is pretty accurate.

Didn't use rutabagas or sweet potatoes or turnips because didn't have them on hand, but just used more regular potatoes, carrots, and, parsnips.  Will try with the other vegetables some day.

Very good.  Slightly sweet from the apple juice which was fine.  I would suggest lining your pan with foil for easier cleanup!  Thanks!

I did a Renaissance feast for 50 people and used this recipe.  They loved it.  I kept it simple, potatoes, sweet potatoes and carrots.  I also tossed the veggies in olive oil before roasting them.

I made this with what I had  on hand, which was 2 sweet potatoes, a rutabaga (sweeter version of a turnip), brussel sprouts and a purple onion. I cut the onion into wedges, trimmed the ends and cut a half inch cross into the bottom of the brussel sprouts, and cut the sweet potato and rutabaga into fries. Tossed with olive oil, salt and pepper on a big sheet pan (with 1 inch sides) 4oz each of apple juice and a fruity piniot grigio--didn't reduce it just pored into the pan with the veggies. Baked for 40 min, taking the sweet potato out after 25 min and turning the veggies in the liquid remaining in the bottom of the pan. Back in the oven for another 15min.  Perfect carmelization and could have put the photo on the cover of Gourmet Magazine. (Too bad my batteries were dead in the camera).  I will serve this tomorrow nite at room temp with a drizzle of balsamic & olive oiil, along side Firecracker Grilled Alaska  Salmon (from this site) and wild rice pilaf.  Make sure you use good wine.  If you don't want to drink it--don't cook with it as it will intensify the flavor it reduces.  I used Clos Du Bois but any good quality white wine would be good. Thanks for posting this recipe.

This was really good.  It even turned out despite my errors. I was impatient and didn't boil the apple juice and wine enough before adding the butter and pouring over the veggies.  I felt guilty and pulled them out of the oven after 5 minutes or so, drained it and put the apple juice and wine back on the stove to reduce further.  Then I reduced it too much!  I poured the mixture over the veggies again and threw it in the oven for a second time.  I let it cook for about 35 mintues and it turned out great!  So yummy!  I used a couple of sweet potatoes, some carrots and parsnips.  The veggies had a nice flavour and had a bit of a gourmet taste to them.  Not your typical cooked veggies.  I'll make this again; thanks Christine.

These were fantastic!  I used Brussels sprouts, cut in half and no rutabaga, and the Brussels were almost my favorites!  Except for maybe the parsnips - I love parsnips! Who knew?  I roasted this a bit longer than the recipe, until the liquid had boiled away to a nice glaze and the veggies got browned a bit.  I will definitely do this again!

In my opinion the directions should be revised. Veggies should be in a shallow layer - I guess that's why the two pans - and the cooking time seems to be much longer. I'm now at two hours in the oven and its still not done. Also, the liquid did not reduce that much in 30 minutes.

I really liked this dish. It is a sweeter variation from traditional root bake (usually just garlic, herbs & oil oil), but  a nice change. I added beets and the juice mixed with the apple cider to make a nice sauce. Watch the cider/wine reduction it may take longer than 30mins, but make sure you are down to 3/4 cup before using. A great dish and I have already passed along the recipe! Thank you!

Served with allrecipe.com's "Cuban pork roast" (using a very LEAN roast), "black beans and rice" & shredded romaine and a mango salsa for a real cuban flair.  1/2 serving is the perfect amount as a side dish.  It is beautiful.  I used yuca to substitute for the rutabagas for a cuban flair.

I picked to add butternut squash since I only had a rutabega and not also the turnip.  These assorted vegetables did not cook in the 40 minutes and kept drying out as they were cooking.  I had no carmalization occur.  I don't think I would try this recipe again.

This was okay.  I had something similar to this at someone's home a few years ago and this recipe wasn't as good, but it wasn't bad.  I used all the vegetables listed but I added garlic and onion and more carrots.  I started roasted them in a little olive oil, fresh rosemary, fresh parsley, salt, and pepper first for about 20 minutes.  I didn't use as many of the vegetables as the recipe calls for and I halved the amount of juice and wine.  I poured the juice/wine mixture over and then added the butter to the pan after.  They roasted for a long time.  I didn't care for the rutabagas.  The sweet potatoes didn't seem right either.  I served this for Christmas dinner along with scalloped potatoes and roast beef.  People ate them but I don't think it was a favorite.  I'll have to ask my friend what her recipe was.  I might try this again with more familar vegetables.

This was so good!!!  I made a few changes based on what I had available.  I used butternut squash, brussel sprouts, turnips and onions cut into 1 inch pieces.  I cooked equal parts white wine, and apple juice.  I added fresh thyme sprigs and roated garlic cloves to the mixture and reduced by about 1/2.  I lined a baking sheet with foil, tossed the veggies in olive oil / salt / pepper and topped with the wine mixture and baked....  I will be making this again... tonight!!!  Great recipe Christine, thanks!!!

The slightly tart flavor from the apple juice didn't really fit with the veggies and it could use more seasoning of some sort.  Not really sure what would make this better.

Good way to use up apple juice I had on hand, but my other recipe using olive oil (instead of butter, apple juice, and wine) works just as well.

I didn't know I liked rutabagas until I tried this recipe. I love them. =) The white wine and apple juice combo is perfect.

A yummy addition to a fall dinner, but these portions are huge - I made half the recipe and it was enough for 8. Also, it needed to stay in the oven for 75 minutes.

I cooked the  sauce FOREVER and was unable to get it to reduce.  I guess I did not get it.  I am an accomplished cook, but this did not work.  Ended up frying the vegetables for breakfast like fried potatoes and eating them with eggs.

This is a wonderful recipeâ€”the flavors are lovely, the vegetables and stock can be varied without detracting from the flavor, and the left-overs are even more delicious the next dayâ€”yet it remains only a special occasion dish for my family because it's very time-consuming to make. As other reviewers have noted, it takes longer for the liquid to reduce than the recipe states, and much MUCH longer for it to roast in the over, however that's not entirely a bad thing; I now roast this recipe covered for one hour, then remove it and toss the vegetables, and roast for another hour uncovered, tossing it once more afte thirty minutes to ensure that none of the vegetables dries out. 

My husband is a very picky eater and I love parsnips, so it's nice to have a parsnip dish we can both enjoy, and this dish has been a hit at Thanksgiving for the last two years, so I highly recommend it. However, as I stated above, the prep and cooking time is much longer than the recipe states, so make this dish the night ahead and just warm it up in the over before serving.

4 stars only because it was a lot of work to prep and precook the veggies.  We loved the apple juice glaze.  It's not overpowering and removed the bitterness from the rutabaga.  Served with broiled salmon and fresh pineapple.  Wonderful meal on a gloomy winter day.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was nice.  I actually prefer using a combination of apple juice and lemon juice to the white wine.  I think it's a better combo.  But I do love roasted root vegetables in the winter.  They're at the farmer's market in bulk, and they're full of nutrition and flavor.

I used sweet potato, carrot and beets. The beets were a bit firm, yet started to burn before the others. The sweet potatoes worked the best of these veggies. The carrots were just ok. The dish seemed lightly flavored. Maybe I didn't reduce the apple juice mix enough before adding to the dish to really "caramelize" them. I would make this with sweet potatoes again and try some of the other vegetables listed in the recipe.

I was not impressed with this recipe. It made a TON of vegetables (I should have known better) and they didn't have a wow-factor for me. The apple juice/wine reduction took quite a bit of time. And while this recipe was easy though very tmie consuming, I don't think it was worth it. I think I'll stick to my usual way - a little agave, a little olive oil, a little lemon juice, salt and pepper and roasted.   I did end up turning all the leftover veggies into a delicious spiced bisque though!

Sorry -- I didn't care for this.  The combo of wine and apple juice detracted from the flavor of the root veges.  Maybe I did something wrong, but my veges never carmelized at all.

Unfortunately, this recipe did nothing for me. The apple juice seemed like a great way to sweeten up the root veggies, but the added wine made them almost sour tasting. A similar effect could have been achieved by dousing them all in apple cider vinegar.

I made this with 2 potatoes, cubed and 2 carrots, shredded, only. substituted homemade beef broth for white wine. Didn't measure but estimated the apple juice, broth, n butter. I added allspice & about 3 whole cloves. Put them in a pyrex dish covered with foil and just let them steam then roast without foil in oven. great side dish.

We used this as a side dish for Thanksgiving instead of the typical sweet potato casserole dish. It was a great way to use some different root vegetables. I used the leftovers in a shepherds pie and they were good there as well.

This was good. I made it with just the carrots and sweet potatoes. I first coated them with olive oil and the spices, then poured on the liquid mixture (in which I omitted the butter). The mixture barely got reduced during a half hour of boiling, so I used it as is. Forty minutes is not enough baking time - after an hour they were good, and after another 15 minutes, excellent. Pairs very nicely with roasted chicken.

Because of my location, I couldn't find turnips or parsnips, so I used parsley root and something that the name translates to radishes, but looked more like giant parsnips (and tasted like uncooked frozen french fries)...  I enjoyed it, and so did my guests.  And none of us are huge vegetable eaters.  =)  I might make again for thanksgiving or other large feast.

I just didn't like it.  I liked the parsnips and carrots but I did not like the rest.  This is my first time cooking with turnips and rutabaga.  The recipe was easy to follow and it was easy to cook.  I just didn't like it as I said above.

I served this with ham at Christmas dinner. I divided up into two large roasting pans. Unfortunately one pan burnt to the bottom; the other was perfect. I served the two parts together and no one noticed any difference. Actually the burnt parts are quite tasty.

This was a wonderful dish. I did not use the sweet potato in mine and I added a chopped fennel bulb to the mix of vegetables.  I seasoned the vegetables with kosher salt, fresh cracked pepper, dry italian herbs and garlic olive oil. I started the roasting process while reducing the white wine and apple juice and then added the reduction to the vegetables and continued to roast them until tender. I served this with boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I coated in seasoned breadcrumbs, sprayed with cooking spray and baked in the oven. I had never eaten a parsnip, rutebega or turnip until I tried this recipe. This was hearty, filling and delicious!  My husband proposed to me again when he tasted this dish!

This turned out really well.  I auditioned this for my Thanksgiving Vegtable Dish and it is a strong contender.  The veggies came out golden brown and coated with sticky delicious apple/wine glaze.  

I would suggest beginning with alot more of the apple juice/white wine before reducing into a glaze as it all seemed to evaporate very quickly once in the oven.  I had to adjust and drizzle the veggies with some olive oil halfway through the cooking process.  I would even sprinkle the veggies with some cinnamon next time to capitalize on that rustic fall flavor.  

Also beware that clean-up can be tricky here.  Make sure you lay down some tin foil that goes all the way up the sides of the roasting pan or are in for a clean-up nightmare.

This turned out really well.  I auditioned this for my Thanksgiving Vegtable Dish and it is a strong contender.  The veggies came out golden brown and coated with sticky delicious apple/wine glaze.  

I would suggest beginning with alot more of the apple juice/white wine before reducing into a glaze as it all seemed to evaporate very quickly once in the oven.  I had to adjust and drizzle the veggies with some olive oil halfway through the cooking process.  I would even sprinkle the veggies with some cinnamon next time to capitalize on that rustic fall flavor.  

Also beware that clean-up can be tricky here.  Make sure you lay down some tin foil that goes all the way up the sides of the roasting pan or are in for a clean-up nightmare.

I did not care for the recipe, my husband thought it was edible.  I had no problem reducing the wine and apple juice mixture.  It's nice to see this variety of veggies used, but I think I would just go with plain olive oil, rosemary and a little salt.

  I'm going to use the veggies in a soup tommorrow.

Not bad. I didn't have parsnips, so I subbed carrots, but otherwise I stayed right to the recipe. I'm still not a fan of turnips and rutabagas, but this is probably one of the best ways to do them so that they are palatable.

I made a scaled down version of this without the parsnips or rutabaga. It came out great and is an awesome seasonal sidedish.It does come out very sweet, so I will add an onion next time and maybe experiment with some herbs and using apple cider vinegar for some of the juice. But this is a great basic recipe that you can tinker with to adjust to your own taste easily. Thanks!

Yummy! I followed the instructions as written, except I added beets in addition to all the listed veggies. I don't know what some of the other reviewers were doing that gave them problems -- maybe not reducing the juice/wine enough? (It really does take 30 minutes.) I'll definitely make this again.

This was fantastic.  I did not include turnips and parsnips.  As a consequence, I probably had about twice as much sauce relative to the amount of vegetables.  

I used 1Tbs butter and 2Tbs olive oil.  After reducing the sauce volume, I added ~1/2 cup apple juice so there would be enough volume for all of the veggies to "boil" in the sauce.  I cut the veggies to 1/4" thick slices, and covered the casserole dish with aluminum foil while cooking. 

I served this with a chicken dish, and drizzled a bit of the sauce from the chicken dish on the veggies before serving. Yum!

I've made this four times now, sometimes substituting other vegetables. It's always been delicious. Last night I added fennel which worked very well. You can turn the leftovers into a delicious soup as well, just blend in batches with chicken stock, season it up (I added salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and roasted garlic), add a some more chicken stock, and add some heavy whipping cream at the end (don't boil!) if that's your thing.

I used rutabagas, turnips, carrots and sweet potatoes; it took longer than the allotted 40 minutes to fully cook, but it turned out delicious. The flavors were mellow and complemented the rest of my Thanksgiving meal very well.

Not bad, good recipe for root vegetables.  The serving proportions weren't quite right.  I cut the amount of veggies in 1/2, but used the same amount of sauce (reduced to 3/4 cup), and it was still enough to serve 11 people.

I wanted this to work so badly. I had never cooked with root vegitables and I was so excited to try something new. The glaze ended up to watery and the vegitables were rubbery. I ended up using the yams and carrots as a garnish on the Turkey and throwing the rest out. Such a disspointment.

Amazing recipe.  Didn't have rutabaga, so made it up using more of the other vegetables.  Wonderful taste.  Even my husband, who dislikes vegetables and will not eat carrots, loved this.  He said it was definitely a repeater - even the carrots were good!  A miracle!
