Steps are all accurate and cookies turned out great. The only thing that I changed was for the glaze, I added a bit more sugar for the same amount of butter to make it sweeter, but that's just my taste. Works extremely well if you add sprinkles or other decorative items on top after you drizzle the glaze.

Made as per recipe but I did add a bit more lemon and orange peel (think of a rounded mound instead of flat) and if you have a tabletop mixer, it makes the process much quicker & easier. I put them in convection oven at 340 degrees for 8 minutes and they turned out well; moist and very much like a sugar cookie consistency! Made the glaze per recipe and it was wayyyy too much; the cookies were drowning and I still have leftover glaze! I think next time I will either halve that part or omit completely. Very good recipe and love the flavor combination; I will definitely be making these again :)

I've made it twice now... The second time I left it in the fridge for a couple of hours, which made it easy to make cutouts. The cookies turned out soft and chewy the first time, crisp the second. Didn't bother with the glaze either time, we liked it just as it was.

Everyone that has tasted these cookies loves them!  They are not overly sweet at all, it's a good tea cookie. I did find that if you refrigerate the dough for an hour or so it's not as messy when scooping.  I ended up dipping the tops of my cookies into the glaze and it worked perfectly.

I made it with orange zest only and skipped the glaze altogether.   Needed a good 12 min in a convection oven.  Wonderful, easy cookies that taste like shortbread.  Used a stand mixer which made this recipe about 20 minutes to prepare.  Will use every Christmas from now on.  Freeze beautifully too!  Absolutely 'perfect' recipe.  Thank you :)

These cookies are wonderful! Just the right amount of sweet and citrus. I used the zest of 2 whole oranges and 1 lemon in the batter. My family loves them!!

This was simply delicious!! WONDERFUL smell which was very appreciated in the middle of winter as it reminded me Spring is around the corner. The flavor was fastastic, not overly sweet. I added some orange zest to the glaze. Otherwise, I followed it and got very good kudos from my co workers. Will absolutely make it again.

I was very satisfied with the outcome of these cookies. I do suggest adding a tad bit more flour to the dough to make it a little easier to set, and also adding more orange juice to the glaze is necessary. Over all it is definitely recommended in my book, and as a bonus is very easy to make!

Didnâ€™t measure orange and lemon peel, just went with it and it turned out great. Perfect cookie with or without the glaze! Put the dough in the fridge before rolling the cookies and I did add more orange juice to the glaze for personal preference (as recipe said to).

I substituted stevia  for the sugar and used whole wheat pastry flour, but these resulting cookies were quite delicious.

My guests liked them, but I found it hard putting the stickey dough on the parchment paper.
