Although we all enjoyed this casserole, I felt like the Velveeta was unneccesary.  It would still be cheesy without it, and the Velveeta did not melt properly, causing there to be "globs" of it all through the casserole.  I will make this again, just will leave the Velveeta out.

This was a little too cheesy for me.  The beans almost got lost in a gooey, cheesy taste.  I guess I didn't like the frozen beans either.  I think if I made this again, I'd choose to omit the Velveeta, use half the cheddar cheese, and use *canned* French-style green beans.  I like the beans a little squishier than the slight crispness that the frozen had.  On a more positive note, adding the french-fried onions in the middle, as well as on top, was nice.  I did get compliments on it, though, so....  :)

Great version of the same ol' green bean casserole.  Adds some variety! And I love cheese! However, I think it might be a little TOO cheesy, all the cheese kind of drowns out the other flavors in the casserole.  Next time I think I will leave out the processed cheese, or maybe just use half.

I'm a cheese lover too, but wow....this recipe made me never want to eat cheese again. It was runny and way overpowering. Family told me to never make this again. Its not too late, turn back now and find another recipe...you can thank me later.

I loved this green bean recipe!  I made it for Thanksgiving and everybody loved them. I will be making this for Christmas too! I left out the processed cheese and just used shredded cheddar cheese. It was the perfect amount of cheese and cheesey taste.  I couldn't imagine how this dish would taste with all the extra velveeta added...

This is Wonderful!!!! I used 2 cans of green beans instead of the frozen so the dish isn't so crunchy, and baked for about 45-60 minutes.  Even if you don't like green bean casserole, you must try this.  It is sooooooo good!!  thank you Chris

This recipe is ok, but definitely can only be stomached once a year as that age-old Thanksgiving requirement.  Be careful to heed the others' warnings about too much cheese and milk, and you'll do okay.  Just watch how much you eat, and you shouldn't end up with a belly-ache like I did!

EVERYONE LOVED THIS! I did make some changes (because I didn't have all ingredients) I used 1 can Cream of Mushroom & 1 can Cream of Celery, left out the Velveeta. I got many requests for the recipe. Thank You!

This would have been much better had I used canned green beans. The soup mixture with the cheese is awesome but I don't like frozen green beans, I should have known better.  I will be making this again with canned green beans and I am sure it will be 5 stars.

I have been making green bean casserole like this for years. It is requested for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner every year. The only difference in this recipe from mine, is that I use pepperjack cheese for a little kick.

Made this for Thanksgiving tonight and it is the bomb!  Everyone loved it and said this will be the new green bean casserole!  I did not add the velveeta and added Worcestershire sauce and it was a hit!

I think the recipe would be best suited for canned green beans. I found that even after the total cook time, that the green beans were still too tough for me.

I took this to Thanksgiving today; forget the kids, the adults loved it.  Everyone got seconds. The recipe seemed a little runny at first but if the dish has to sit a while it turned out just right.  I layered the recipe just as it indicates but ended up stirring it after 30 minutes of cooking.  The Velveeta melts but in patches.  Don't bother layer it.  Just mix it all together and add the fried onions during the last 10 minutes of baking.  I used canned french green beans and only used one cup of cheedar.  Super easy and fast.  I will use this recipe again.

I have made this recipe for the last few years and everyone loves it. I forgot to put the velveeta in the first time and it turned out so good, so I jsut leave that out now. I usually make 2-3 batches of it because I'm always asked to make it for all the ThanksGiving get togethers. Thanks for a great recipe.

I used less Velveeta and it turned out great.  I made it the first time with the suggested amount of cheese and it turned into more of a soup.  The second time was wonderful with less cheese.

I have always used this recipe for my green bean casserole. The changes I make, is to use canned green beans, not frozen. I don't like the crunchiness. Also, instead of Velveeta, I use slices of cheddar and munster cheese. It is always a huge hit at parties.

Very tasty ! Made it exactly as recipe listed, the only thing I would change is the sliced cheese in the middle layer. A little too much cheese , so I will omit it. Made this along with the plain version and this went first ! Since the grandchildren ate this willingly this will be served more often . Thanks for the recipe

Very disappointed......WAY to cheesy.  It should be called cheese casserole with  a few green beans.  Next time I would omit the velvetta, cut the cheddar cheese in half and maybe add a little bit of salt.

I make a green bean casserole every year for my husband.  And I found this one with the cheese sounds to good to be true.  Can't wait to try this recipe out this year.  I also use frozen green beans but I boil my green beans first until they are soft, drain the water of course and then add the rest of the ingredients to complete the casserole.  My husband loves that the green beans are not crunchy and he can enjoy the dried onions on top.  Which are suppose to be crunchy instead of the green beans.

This recipe is a good start, but it needs a lot of adjustments.  I made it for Thanksgiving.  Half my guests thought it had too much cheese; and the other half thought it needed more green beans.   It also makes a huge amount.  I halved the recipe and it was easily enough for 8 to 10 people.   If I make it again, I will half everything else, but use 21 oz (roughly a bag and a half) of green beans to balance it.   I have read others who recommend loosing the Velveeta altogether.  You could do that and still have a fine casserole, but the cheddar alone wouldn't generate the super cheesy flavor that makes this recipe a keeper in my recipe box.

Did I miss something?  Although this casserole tasted just fine, inside, it was like soup.  I wondered if I should defrost the frozen green beans and drain them, however the recipe never mentioned doing that.  What I ended up with was something with a nice cheesy crust, sealing in a cheesy soup, which included green beans.  Not sure if I'll try this again.

I was asked to make green bean casserole for Thanksgiving, and wasn't looking forward to cooking something my husband didn't care for.  My husband has never been a fan of green bean casserole, but he now does!  He LOVED this cheesy receipe.  I added pimento to make it festive.  He has even requested that I make it at Christmas!

I also used canned green beans and found the recipe to be a little runny.  I don't think I completely drained the beans, but I also think next time I would use less milk.  But other than that they were delicious!

After reading the reviews, I opted not to put the Velveeta into the casserole, and it was still WAY too cheesy for our tastes. We couldn't taste the yummy mushroom soup or even the crispy onions. I did use canned green beans, but that is what I had, and that is what I've always used in my green bean casserole. Maybe this would be good as a main dish casserole with chicken and rice added. I think I'll stick to my regular green bean casserole that is on the back of French's Fried Onions. Thanks anyway.

Excellent dish! The only green bean casserole I've ever liked. It's loaded with cheese and it's delicious. I used cream cheese instead of Velvetta and it turned out great. Just make sure to use at least a 4 quart casserole dish instead of a 2 quart. I have no idea how anyone could fit all that into a 2 quart dish!

I used this recipe and mixed it with another recipe and it worked really well.  I omitted the Velveeta altogether. The cheddar was enough.

I also added 1 lb portabella mushrooms sautéed with shallots in some butter to the mushroom soup mixture.  I layered the beans and sauce like the recipe said.  It came out really good!  So, it was more like a cheesy mushroom/green bean casserole!

I've been using this recipe since Thanksgiving 2002.  Its become a family hit.  My sister's in-laws request it and the picky kids will eat their veggies this way!  I'm going to try to make this a little more diet friendly by using fat free/low fat atlernatives this year.

this dish is always requested by my husband's family.  I have made it with canned, frozen, and fresh green beans, and is 100 times better with fresh green beans.  I also took the advice of another cook, and didn't even bother layering, add french fried onions to the top during the last 15 min of cooking, so you can stir just before adding them.

VERY cheesy. Nothing subtle about these!
I would recommend canned beans instead of frozen. The frozen ones still ended up pretty firm & crunchy.
A pretty good recipe.

I am a cheese lover but not to big on the green beans but this was a great dish. I was looking for a new dish and this was an excellent choice. So if you have never had it, try it, you won't be dissappointed.

I really liked this recipe, but instead of velvetta use cheese whiz. Mix it in with the soup and warm it in the microwave before, this causes it to spread more even over the green beans.

I do not like green bean casserole. after reading other reviews I decided to try it. It came out a soupy mess. I used 2 cans of french style green beans. If I try again, I think I will use cut green beans. Maybe 3 cans of green beans and 2 cans of onions.  I was disappointed in this recipe.

This recipe is terrible! Cooking should be about getting a good balance of tastes and textures. This has such an overwhelming amount of cheese that it's all you can taste. Made this for company and nobody finished what was on their plate. I ended up throwing 75% of it away.

This was a good recipe. I ended up not using the Velveeta at all, and it was still very cheesy. I also added water chestnuts and sliced almonds in the middle on top of the first layer of sauce, and almonds on the top with the onions. We like a little crunch.

I made this and it was delicious, but I made a couple simple changes:

If you use canned green beans (I used string beans) then use 4+ cans.

I added cheese to sight/instinct, I did not add 1/2 pound- maybe 1/3 tops.

I also added more flavor to the mushroom soup mix by using pepper, minced garlic, onion powder and salt. I feel like that made a big difference, because the flavor was wonderful! 

I will definitely make this again!

Amazing! Second year making this for a side dish on thanksgiving and it's a hit every time! Everyone says it's the best green bean casserole they've ever had. I don't think it's too cheesy as some people commented. It's perfect if you follow the ingredients!

My husband normally hates green bean casseroles, however, I knew the cheese would win him over! I halved the recipe, using (1) 27 oz. can of green beans, and only (1) 10.75 oz. can of cream of mushroom soup. The cheese is the key-Did not add any Velveeta, used grated Colby 1/2 to 3/4C, more on top along with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. Definitely for the cheese lovers! Will make again using French green beans.

The recipie lacked special specific details that would assist in how much Velveeta to add in each layer, as we didnt see a consistant melt throughout the dish. The recipie didnt specify how thin the slice should be, were they pre-wrapped slices?? I would definatley minimize the amount of cheese added.

Left out the Velveeta according to other comments and thought it was a little bland.  Needs some spices or something to liven it up - still good and hearty, but just not too flavorful.  Maybe a cheese other than cheddar would help to make it more flavorful?

This recipe is huge so make sure you have a lot of people to eat it--in error,I made 2 recipes of this dish for a company party and 1 would have been plenty.  My only complaint was that the processed cheese did not melt completely, so I had chunks of Velveeta in the beans.   I guess I should have cooked it longer or used less or maybe a different type of casserole dish would have helped.  I had alot of people ask for the recipe, so I guess they didn't mind the chunks!!  Thanks--great recipe.

Wow, what an easy recipe. I'm a newly wed and decided that this holiday I was going to surprise everyone and show up with a dish that no one makes.  I did a lot of searching for the perfect recipe and I chose this one.  Man, did I do good.  Thanks Chris for and easy and delicious dish.  Oh yea, I didn't had the fried onion until about 5 minutes until it was finished.  Delicious, And I WILL make this again.

This is the best green bean casserole I've ever made...I had many requests for the recipe.  VERY tasty, excellent consistency. Nice slight variation from the "traditional" recipe.  I'll definitely make it again and again and again....

This is the first recipe that I believe that I gave 5 stars to. I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was sooo good!! The cheeses blended in so well with this dish and everyone really enjoyed it. My mom does not like traditional green bean casserole, but with this she loved it and wanted more...Thanks Chris for this great variation!!!

Is this good or what? I love green beans and cheese so for me this is the best! Just wasn't sure what kind of green bean was used canned or frozen. I used canned because I didn't have any frozen french cut, so I drained one can and partially drained the other. Draining all liquid from canned beans I feel is necessary. Thanks for the recipe!
