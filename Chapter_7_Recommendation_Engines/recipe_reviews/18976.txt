This "smoothie" was great!  I did not have any strawberry sorbet so I used about 1/2 cup of plain yogurt and about 1/2 cups of peach juice since that is what I had on hand.  I transfomed this smoothie into frozen treats by pourring the mix into popsicle molds.  The kids LOVED THEM!

It's really good. I added a little ice though to make it colder.

I cheated a little since I didn't have the sorbet, but this smoothie still came out pretty good. The strawberry sorbet would have definitely improved this drink, but it can still stand ok on its own.

This was a wonderful recipe. Hubby and I both loved it.  I've never made it with the sorbet, as that's not a common ingredient for me.  I've replaced the sorbet with ice cream once and with 1/2 C yogurt and 1 C ice the second time.  Both were very good.

Mmmmmm..... i didn't have sorbet but it was spectacular anyways. Want my mom to try this so I'm making more tonight. I just used 7 strawberries, 1/2 peach, 1/2 banana (i have a sweet-toothed pet rabbit who enjoyed the other half :) and three oranges (juiced). Delicious and healthy treat, love it!

The store didn't have strawberry sorbet, so I bought strawberry-raspberry sherbet which worked great.  Other than the sub for the sorbet, followed the recipe to the letter, and this ranks in the top 3 smoothies that I've ever made.  All the fruits partner well, the sherbet thickened and added sweetness, and the OJ really brightened the flavor.  Wouldn't change a thing.
