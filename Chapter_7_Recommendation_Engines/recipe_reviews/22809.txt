I think there may be too much yeast.  Theoretically the sour dough starter should be the only Rising required.  It rose too high and then collpsed  but the flavor was good.  I am going to try it without the yeast in the 2nd part of recipe.

I thought this was worth a shot, since I really love sourdough bread. It's easy and quick enough, it just didn't taste sourdoughy at all...

This bread smelled wonderful and looked beautiful but tasted bland.  It doesn't have a sourdough taste.

I like this recipe, but it didn't taste like sourdough, it was more like regular white bread.

I left the "starter" for 18 hours.....and made as directed by hand, no bread machine.  It was a good bread, just tasted nothing like sourdough.

The bread I ended up with was a little dry and lacked a real sourdough taste.  I'll try it again just to make sure it wasn't a mistake I made in the process.  Still tastes good though!

A small tip to everyone that didn't think it had enough sourdough taste If you add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp sour salt (citric acid for canning) it will help add more of a sour taste. I used a starter i already had and with the added yeast it makes it a little bland but for an easy recipe this is great

The photo of rainbow bread was not enticing at all but the recipe turned out really good.  I would put an entire teaspoon of salt in the next batch.

Made this for the first time today, using the dough blade on my old standing mixer, leaving out the second yeast, rising for about ten hours in my standing mixer bowl at room temp, and wet teens the top prior to baking for 30 minutes at 350, second rise only took an hour and a half, made two round loaves in old pie tins, but came out AWESOME! Thx for the prior hint, it would have been way too much with more yeast, but the crust was almost like a ciabatta thin and light bread, spongy to perfection with a slight sourdough flavor.
