We are 8 years old and we made them all by are selfs. They are the best cupcakes we have ever made. We did not have almond extract and they still are great.  We enjoyed making them and eating them too. They are the best cupcakes ever!!!

THis was good.  I made a couple of alterations, but not many.  I changed the fat to oil after watching an episode of "Throwdown with Bobby Flay" on cupcakes and her (of course, he battled a woman!) secret ingredient was oil in the batter for a lighter brownie.  I also added 12 oz chocolate chips, since my boys were begging me to make chocolate, chocolate chip cupcakes.

I really liked this recipe. After reading some other reviews, and knowing that butter doesnt get used in cupcakes, I used 10 Tablespoons of oil instead of butter. I also think the cooking time is way off. I only cooked mine for 16 minutes, max! They turned out moist and wonderful. I love the hint of almond flavor you get as well.

I had high hopes for this recipe but unfortunately was disappointed.  These cupcakes were *very dense* and not at all cake like (hence the word cup "cake").  I followed the recipe as stated.  I only made half a batch which was 9 nice sized cupcakes.  Also, I used my kitchen aid mixer but don't feel I over mixed the batter.  Fortunately, i was able to "help" the taste but using the Peanut Butter & Banana Frosting recipe from this site (delicious).

These are delicious. I just made these an hour ago - I chose them because I only had unsweetened coco powder and not chocolate chocolate. The batter is like frosting itself and the cupcakes are so airy. I didn't use the almond extract, but that worked out for me.

These cupcakes were great!  I added 2 cups of milk and that did the trick.  It made them moist and rich.  I don't even like cupcakes, but these were amazing.  Easy to make too.  I had to make these because my dad just was released from the hospital and he craved these.  I must say they were a bit lumpy but the were very tasty!

The recipe is ok, the batter came out a little thick so I added a bit more milk and a dash of oil in it as well. However, after adding these it was still a little thick so I decided to make them into cookies instead. That worked out great! Just spoon out onto a cookie sheet, bake for about 8-10 minutes, cool, and add a bit of frosting. It's a great mix between a cupcake and a cookie!

I made these today and they are a HUGE hit!  I did take note of other suggestions and I used 10 tablespoons of oil instead of butter, and 2 cups of milk instead of 3/4 cup.  Mine came out moist and delicious!  I would rate higher, but they weren't perfect...... but close!

Recipe was totally easy. I had fun just playing with the decorating on the frosting and toppings. The only thing I will say, is it's a good decent recipe, was a tad on the dry factor, not much, the flavor was pretty good. Just slightly dry when you swallow. I would add just a little bit more milk or pull out of the oven a couple of minutes prior to the baking time on this recipe. Otherwise, I'd make this again.

These cupcakes were, as the title says, easy. I also used oil instead of butter, just because I didn't want to use up that much of my butter! They came out just fine: an everyday cupcake that's not too sweet, not too crumbly, and not too dense. They would make a great base for any frosting you might desire.

Go for the "Chocolate Cupcakes" instead. These were more like chocolate muffins, and the flavor was nothing special.

They are very good and easy to make but do turn out a tad on the dry side. To really kick up the flavor, I added 2 tbsp of brewed coffee.

I made these for a basketball team, and they were a huge hit! i only dirty iced them, varying between vanilla and chocalate. Vanilla was most popular, especially among kids. Everyone loved them, but they were a bit dry, so next time i make them, i will add more milk. I used margine instead of butter for a little more moistness, and it worked well. I find the almond extract doesnt make a grand diffrence, so i may leave that out next time. The bad thing about this recipe is it doesnt make many, i made full cupcakes, and it made 12. The batter is very thick, but the cupcakes rise well. I only baked for 17 minutes, and even then they were slightly crispy.

I made these for my Mom's birthday party and thought they turned out okay.  They are a nice rich cupcake with good chocolate flavor.  The texture was just a little porous and I only got 14 cupcakes which left me a little short.  I think doubling the recipe would probably work well to give a good 2 dozen -generous- cupcakes.  : )

I followed the recipe, and the cupcakes ended up a little on the dry side. However, they cooked through evenly and had a nice flavor to them. I didn't have any almond extract on hand, so I substituted a little Hazelnut flavoring syrup which gave them a nice, nutty flavor that went well with the cream cheese icing.

I made these for my sister who loves chocolate so I added dark chocolate chips with cream cheese frosting and she loved them. In my opinion they came out way too heavy and dense, a little bit dry... I even used oil instead of butter in hopes of making them more fluffy. I haven't made cupcakes from scratch in a long while, so I may have screwed up somewhere, but I'll try again.

This recipe was dissapointing.  The cupcakes ended up VERY dense and pretty dry.  On the same day, we made applesauce chocolate cupcakes and those were much more moist, fluffy and flavorful.

I agree with Scarlette. This recipe was alright, but definitely dry. If it weren't for the frosting I made, I probably would have thrown them away, no offense.

These were pretty bad. I made sure not to over mix. I did notice the batter was very thick but some cupcake recipes vary. I should have known better and cooked them for about 15 minutes instead of 20. They were dry and not very sweet. Probably about half of the cocoa powder could have been used and maybe 3/4 of the flower should have been used. . I will remember now to always read reviews online because I'm not the only one who got dense cupcakes

Great recipe!! Lovely light cakey cupcake. I substituted 1 tablespoon of butter with oil but only because I didn't have enough butter. I did need a wee bit extra milk but only 1/4 of a cup more and I used evaporated milk (out of fresh). I found that they only needed 16mins to cook and I rotated the trays half way through. I got 24 standard sized cupcakes from the batter. Definatly will be making these again.

Everyone gobbled these up!  I used oil instead of butter, per other reviewers' suggestions.  Topped with Sugar Cookie Frosting and they were just yummy!  Will use this as a go-to cupcake recipe.

Easy recipe. I actually had problems with my oven when i tried to preheat, so i had to wrap up the batter and wait till the next day to use it, in hopes that it would still work. They worked out just great! I found them to be a tad dry, but still very delicious.

This chocolate cupcake recipe was divine! So delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, using "Special Dark" cocoa powder. I received rave reviews. I really feel like the almond extract is what made this recipe, it gave it that special kick of flavor that most chocolate cake is missing. I baked these inside of ice cream cones for my daughter's 2nd birthday. I will definitely be making this cake again!!!

I'm happy for the 8-year olds who made these cupcakes and loved them. I made these for my 6-year old grandson, and thank goodness he likes them too (they're topped with peanut butter frosting); however, I think they're too dry and the chocolate flavor is too bitter for my taste. If it wasn't for the peanut butter frosting ... probably won't make these again.

I started creaming the butter while getting the dry ingredients together and discovered that I only a 1/4 cup of cocoa powder left! I started rummaging through my cupboards to find out if I had anything to substitute and found malted milk powder. So, I added 1/2 cup of that and hoped that the cupcakes would turn out. Yay, they did! The tops were rather crusty, but the cupcakes were tasty! Thanks for a great recipe!

Loved this recipe! I substituted butter for coconut oil and it turned out great! I was afraid the cupcakes would be grainy but they were not. I also baked for 20 mins as the recipe said.

I made these for Easter subbing canola oil for the butter. They were a hit! Usually I have trouble getting the right texture but these were perfect - moist, but they weren't falling apart. I'm going to make them again tonight to take to some friends tomorrow!

My family loved these cupcakes and they were very easy to make.  I followed  the recipe exactly and found no fault at all with the batter.  These cupcakes are almost brownie-like.  I frosted with fluffy peanut butter frosting, which made them even more delicious.

NOT impressed. For a chocolate cupcake recipe, these were far from chocolatey, and I live in Switzerland so the cocoa powder I used was seriously some of the best that can be bought.  They weren't even fluffy and I even used oil instead of butter, which is always a win when it comes to this type of baking. If anything can save this recipe...just find a new recipe.

I made these for my dad on father's day and he loved them although they need butter frosting to match with the light fluffy cake as they are not very sweet.
I followed the exact directions but replaced butter with corn oil as other reviewers suggested i made 12 cupcakes with an extra small cake as i didnt have the time to wait. But it is one of the recipes i am sure to repeat !!!! BTW i am 13 years old only but making these was a piece of cake !!!

I used these as the base for a Turtule cupcake for my friend's birthday, and they were a hit! I did sub in oil for butter, as most reviews suggested. The only complaint I had was that they were a little dense and heavy. But otherwise very chocolately and good!(for Turtle cupcakes, just mix in about 3/4c (didnt really measure) at the end and top with caramel icing)

This recipe wasn't a disaster, but it wasn't the perfect cupcake I'm searching for. It was really dense and a little hard, as well as too dry. Next time I would cook it for less time for hopefully a better cupcake.

These cupcakes are awesome!   I made a half batch and made 12 small-ish cupcakes.  Wonderful flavor and they turned out nice and fluffy and moist.    Would be even better with some dark chocolate chunks!   I made cream cheese frosting for these and they couldn't have been any better!   YUMMY!

I haven't eaten these cupcakes yet, but they look delicious! I am waiting for them to cool and wondering what I should do for a frosting. I didn't make any changes, but I did leave my butter out overnight to make it extra soft. This was a very easy and fun recipe, although the fun part might be just because I love baking... I noticed that some of my cupcakes puffed up more than others. I might have put more batter in those, but I dought that I didn't mix the baking soda in well enough because my 8-year-old brother loves to mix, so I let him mix. He mixed for a full five minutes! My cupcakes cracked on the top, and I absolutely love the way that turned out. I don't know what I did differently from y'all to do that, but whatever! They're delicious! Thank you so, so much for submitting this recipe and I am sorry if my review is lengthy.

I found this cupcake dense and a little dry. I followed the directions as listed. Maybe I will try this recipe with oil instead of butter and see if this makes a difference. It was an okay cupcake recipe. Made them for my 2 year olds birthday, they came out cute! Decorated with Peppa pig ...

My ten year old cut the recipe in half and left out the  almond extract. She looked up an icing recipe on AR too. She made a dozen cupcakes. They were yummy but a tad bit dry, so we will add a little bit of oil or a tad bit more of milk to moisten it up next time . Overall a good recipe!

Delicious!!  I used oil instead of butter, like others said to. I added 2 tablespoons of sour cream and the cupcakes came out rich & fantastic. I filled them with dulce de leche caramel & they were amazing!

This is the best and most tasty chocolate cupcakes I have ever made. I´ve tried so many recipes for chocolate cupcakes but never found anyone that really got me untill I found this.
 I´ve made them now a couple of times, sometimes skipped the almond extract or thrown in a handfull of chocolate chips, either way, they are delicious. 
But I do highly prefer to add the almond extract since it really gives the cupcakes that something extra.

My 10 year old made these more unsupervised than I planned & they came out delicious. The consistency was firm, but moist & the flavor was perfect for even the youngest (who usually just eats the frosting). Thanks for this successful recipe!

I made it three times. Two times were exactly as the recipie and it was great. Then I made a little twist coz my bro isn't that much into chocolate cupcake. I used the batter to fill 12 cupcakes before adding the cocoa powder. Then i added a quarter a cup of unsweetened cocoa powder to the remaining batter which filled around 6 more chocolate cupcakes. Both were equally delicious. To get equal sized cup cakes, I used the measuring table spoon. I put three tbsp in each cupcake. Enjoy!

I made it but I screwed up not mixing the flour, baking soda, and salt. I hope it tastes good as a cupcake but the batter tastes delicious. I also used cake flour and turns out that I can make another dozen maybe because of that.

Loved it! My son and I had a blast making these. We also had a blast eating them. I  over baked them just a bit but the icing covered that.

Just made them I would give it 5 but did not like the almond flavor. Next time I would just use vanilla. But other than that they came out great. They are a little dense, but what do u expect when u use 4 eggs for 1 1/2 cups of flour, its like a brownie cake. Still yummy, I bet it would taste better with frosting, but I ran out out of cocoa and I'm feeling too lazy lol. Oh I did put a little spin bc I ran out of milk, so I used coconut milk and used a cup of it. The kids loved it!!

Decided to make cupcakes on a whim and this is just the recipe I was needed!! I put in a tiny bit less sugar because I like things on the less-sweet side. Because of that they were probably more like muffins than cupcakes. Also I was too lazy to make any frosting to go with them. My oven is rather slow so 23 minutes was the perfect time and they turned out moist and fluffy and the tops  a tiny bit crispy. Sadly I didn't have almond extract so I want to try this recipe again with it. I also think with chocolate chips they would be good.
UPDATE: I made these again with almond, but I think they are better without.

After reading others' comments, I've used 6 tbsp butter + 4 tbsp olive oil to get the best of both worlds! The result is great! Very moist and delicious! I don't like cakes too sweet, so I have only used 1 cup of sugar, which turns out perfect! YUM!

I tried this recipe tonight, because I was craving a chocolate cupcake. I cut it in half, but followed the ingredients and directions exactly. Half made 10 delicious cupcakes; I checked them at 18 minutes, and they were done. As soon as they cooled,I mixed up a small amount of vanilla buttercream, dunked them into coconut, and they were a great, quick treat.I suspect that the people who didn't like them didn't follow the recipe.

These are great! I needed a quick, easy recipe for a class Halloween party and these were perfect. The rounded nicely and tasted great. Just FYI...1/2 a recipe is perfect for 24 mini cupcakes!
