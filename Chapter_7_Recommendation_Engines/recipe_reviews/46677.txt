My boyfriend and I love sandwiches.. so I went out and got all the ingredients for this one. It was so good!!! We love love loved it. Don't use lettuce, use spinach or romaine. And don't stray from the mozarella cheese, it goes with the Italian flavors. Also, get fresh parsely, fresh oregano, and fresh garlic... better than powder. I used red wine vinegar instead of tarragon (I've never heard of tarragon vinegar). 
HOLY YUMMY GOODNESS!!!

Made it for my husband and his friends for the Championship football game. A big hit!! 

One recommendation: I found that this recipe worked perfectly for two, 1 pound loaves of italian bread. I simply split the recipe in half between the two loaves. There was PLENTY of meat, cheese and dressing for both. I think shoving it all into one loaf would have been a bit much.

Wow! This is one "Super" Hero sandwich. You might call it a hoagie or sub depending on where you're from. This isn't exactly "healthy" - but, I guess you have to splurge once in a while. I subbed red wine vinegar for the tarragon vinegar and roasted red peppers for the mushrooms. I also used capicola and proscuitto instead of turkey and added some provolone.  I didn't bother refridgerating this overnight - didn't want a soggy mess, besides who could resist this sandwich! A couple of hours was all we could hold out before cutting it into sections. Perfect with kettle cooked chips and mild cherry peppers - YUM!

I think this is the best sandwich I have ever made!  I get so sick of eating just plain turkey and cheese sandwiches for lunch.  This sandwich is so good.  It is good for a couple of days too.  The bread doesn't get soggy.  I used less meat than the recipe suggested.

Wonderful recipe!  My husband loved it.  I made it with smoked turkey, swiss and provolone cheeses and a spicy salami I found in our grocery store's deli section.  The only suggestion I have is that you reduce the garlic to only one or two cloves--three was just too much for our taste.

Three cloves of garlic was overwhelming, definitely cut back or make sure they are small cloves.  I used my food processor to make the olive salad, starting with pulsing the garlic, then adding the olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice and seasonings, then pulsing sliced black olives and sliced mushrooms.  I will make again for my Super Bowl party, it is a good, make ahead sandwich.

I made this for my husband for our Father's Day picnic.  He loved it.  I used different meats and cheese and pumpernickel bread because that was all they had at the store.  So delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.

This is a nice spring/summer recipe.  Made it the night before and had it for dinner the next day.  I used two 8 oz. oval loaves of crusty bread, 2 clove of garlic and not quite all the sandwich meat it called for. I took another reviewers advice and used my food processor to pulse all the ingredients in step 1.  Family loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for our contribution to Christmas Eve family dinner.  I substituted balsamic vinegar for tarragon vinegar, Havarti for mozarella and added a tablespoon of an Italian herb mixture.  The resulting sandwich weighed just over four and a half pounds and everyone loved it!

Really good!  We enjoyed it for a few days without having it go soggy or gross.  We used turkey and roast beef as our meat choices, and did everything else the same.

This is a GREAT sandwich! I made it for the Super Bowl and my family and friends devoured it. It is very accomodating to different meats cheeses and veggies. 
I omitted the mushrooms and used roasted red pepper flavored olives, added a little chopped onion and chopped pimento peppers to the sauce. This did work well in two oval shaped crusty breads. I couldnt find a round one. I will use this often.

A good combination of flavors that makes for a really good, filling sandwich.  I made this for a party.  It was nice to make the night before to leave time for the rest of the party goodies on the day of.

The proportions and flavor of this sandwich were not pleasing to us.  I used tarragon vinegar and did not like the flavor.  It also seemed like about twice as much meat as needed.  We also did not like the olives.  It seemed like there were too many flavors competing to top one another.

It's a good concept...I'll admit that.  I will do a LOT of tweaking to find the right combination for us.  And we loved the sliced mozzarella - had never had it on a sandwich before.  The concept and the cheese got it the second star.

This sandwich is excellent! I made no changes other than using sharp provolone cheese which is just personal preference. I made it about 24 hours ahead of time and it held up beautifully. Can't wait to have an occasion to make it again! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is THE best Italian sandwich I've ever had!  It really is an amazing amount of meat and cheese and bread but it is so worth breaking whatever diet you were attempting before coming across this recipe.  I don't put the full amount of olives it calls for because while I KNOW it would be amazing.. my boyfriend doesn't like olives. Lame, I know.  SO instead I double the mushrooms.  I also tried it once w/ rice vinegar as it was the only vinegar I had on hand.  Just added a touch more lemon juice to balance it out and it was still absolutely fantastic!  If you're just starting cooking or you're not really sure of yourself in the kitchen this one is a no fail recipe!  No matter what corners you need to cut it'll be just fine. :)  My only small problem is I brought a few pieces for some friends at work and now every time I make it half the office is asking if I can bring a piece for them next time! lol    Thank you for sharing!

Very good!  This sandwich was very easy to throw together the night before.  I used red wine vinegar because my grocery store doesn't carry tarragon vinegar.  I reduced the black olives because I wasn't sure if our guests liked them.  One of them commented that the "black things" in the dressing really added flavor, so I guess I'll add more next time.  I used part of a 4 ounce can of chopped black olives, but will probably throw in the whole thing next time.  I doubt I'll add an entire cup.  I also didn't add mushrooms.  I couldn't find a round loaf of bread, so I settled for a rectangular loaf, which sliced into 6 nice subs.  Definitely remeber to carve out some of the extra bread as directed.  I'll definitely make this again!

Good, for me a it was too much garlic. I wound up scraping off some of the seasonings. The sandwich wound up lasting longer than expected which was a nice surprise. I got probably 4 lunches out of it. I might also substitute the salami for another meat, though that's personal preference.

Amazing sandwich!!  I usually make this on Friday night then my husband can munch on it all weekend.  I've tried a variety of meats- hard salami, mesquite smoked turkey breast, black forest ham, chipotle cheddar cheese and swiss work the best! So good!

This is incredible!  The olive salad is wonderful....I make a similar olive salad for mufaletta but there I use cauliflower...I think the mushrooms are an inspired idea here.  It's this salad that makes the sandwich....you can do anything with it...it would probably taste good in an omelet!  Awesome sandwich...try it and your guests will like.

This is a great sandwich.  It does require a bit of prep but I love how I can make this the night before I have to serve it and it doesn't get soggy.  Just make sure you wrap it in a lot of plastic wrap.  The servings are off because this hero fed 8 people and I still had a serving left-over (and that was after second helpings!).  The only thing I would change is to use LESS chopped black olives.  I used slightly less and it was still really over-powering.  I would probably use a half-cup to 3/4's of a cup of black olives.  Additionally, I added sliced pepperoni to the sliced turkey, sliced ham and sliced salami.  I used green lettuce leaves (not iceberg lettuce) and it came out perfect!  Great game day sandwich!

Used green olives instead of black.  Used balsamic vinegar as I do NOT like tarragon.  THIS MIXTURE is a MUST for picnic sandwiches.  No need for mayo based sandwiches EVER again!  THE BEST TOPPING EVER on a sandwich.  We put on what meats we like and take it from there.

This was great.  I took others suggestions and used red wine vinegar (could not find tarragon vinegar!!) You really need to use the heavy version of italian bread.  I used 2- one pound loaves and there was plenty of seasonings. Served for a ladies luncheon and everyone wanted the recipe.  Great recipe!!

We've made this sandwich several times over the years, for conventions and long trips. Saved us money on one of our 9 hour trips to Orlando. We almost always double the meat proportions, more so because that's how their sold, rather than an intentional modification. Several times I've scooped out the wrong side of the sandwich. Doesn't really matter. With these ingredients, it's hard to go wrong. Be sure to mince your garlic as fine as you can. Three cloves shouldn't anywhere near enough to overpower the other tart flavors, like the tarragon vinegar, salami and olives. But you can never have too much garlic, really.

My family loved, loved, loved it!  I did make some changes and watched Chef John's Shooter Sandwich video, so my sandwich was a very nice hybrid.  I eliminated the olive oil, lemon juice, lettuce, tomatoe and pork.  Instead, I mixed spicy mustard and mayo with horseradish and spread it over the bread.  I mixed all the herbs with the garlic, mushrooms (doubled) and olives (halved) and sauteed on med-low for 20 minutes.  I layered everything as follows: Chicken, beef, turkey, mushroom mix, cheese, pate, cheese, chicken, beef, turkey.  I only used a total of 1 lb of meat.  I loosely wrapped in 2 layers of plastic and then a layer of foil.  I put it between 2 cookie sheets and pressed it overnight in the frig with a 20 lb weight.

This sandwich is great just the way the recipe is!!  (I should mention we don't put lettuce on ours, and if I did then I would assume spinah or romaine would be better, just like another reviewer said).  This has gotten rave reviews by our family and friends and I love having this recipe on hand for something than can be made the night before.  The bread does not get soggy and the leftovers were even great the next day!

I made this for my husband and his German friends..They LOVED it!! Said it was better than the German bakeries..The only things I did different was that I left out the black olives and mushrooms and added dried parsley ( 1tsp).. I also didn't add the turkey and bought just white crusty bread (it felt pretty hard) cause the deli was out of French bread.. I left it overnight and it was not soggy at all...I can't wait to make this again and try it for myself!!

Mmmm, really good!  I didn't use all the meat and cheese, but it was plenty for a 1 lb. round sourdough loaf from Safeway's bakery.  

I used provolone instead of mozzarella, red wine vinegar instead of tarragon and spinach in place of the lettuce.  Love that you make it a day ahead.  We took it for lunch on the boat and hubby said it tasted like a sandwich from a fancy deli!  A great sandwich for a party or crowd, thanks for sharing!  I will definitely be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used all turkey products (smoked turkey, turkey ham, and turkey pepperoni) and smoked provolone cheese.  The end result looked and tasted like something from a restaurant.  Can't wait to make it again.

This sandwich is amazing!  I've been making it for many, many years.  The need for making it the night before you want to eat it helps alot for those occasions when you need to get an early start out the door.   It's my kids and their friends favorite sandwich to take when they go camping,  skiing or to sporting events.  I've used a thick crusty long loaf of bread as well as the round; both work equally as well.  The only changes that I make are to add a little honey to the dressing and some thinly sliced red onion on the tomato layer.  Buy the most flavorful meats from the deli counter you can find.  They need to be able to stand up to the strongly flavored dressing.  We like hard peppered salame,  black forest ham and smoked turkey as well as a sharp provolone or aged swiss for the cheese layers.  I'm so glad I found this here, now I won't have to worry if I can't lay my hands on my paper recipe!

My son and his schoolmates loved this sandwich.  I used one very large/long loaf of garlic/parmesan Italian bread (from Walmart!), I skipped the mushrooms and olives, and I had no lettuce so I skipped that too, and I used Malt Vinegar instead of the tarragon. Everything else I did as called for.  I made it around 11pm, wrapped it up and stuck it in the fridge, and then sliced it up into several servings for my son to take to school for a Friday treat for his buds.  I was afraid it would be soggy, but it wasn't!  They all said it was AWESOME!  I will definitely make this again!

Delicious, my husband is a soldier and tends to need a lot of food to keep him going.  I am going to put this in our rotation to pack in his lunch box.  This made enough portions to pack for several days. I didn't change anything, however, I should have scooped out the bread (like the recipe says) to appreciate the taste of the rest of the sandwich. Thanks!

Excellent - all my kids and husband loved this sandwich.   I think it tasted better using not quite so much meat & Cheese as called for in the recipe (and easier to eat with less meat).

This was great!  I cut the recipe in half and my husband and 16 year old son gobbled it up. (Yes, it was supposed to feed 3 but, everyone knows a 16 year old boy eats enough for 2!)  When sliced, it is really pretty.  The guys thought I had bought it!  I did not have tarragon vinegar so substituted red wine vinegar.  Did not use mushrooms as my guys only like them on pizza. Everything else was exactly as the recipe was written.  Would be easy to substitute any variety of meats and cheeses.  This is a wonderful meal for our long waited for hot summer days.  Great for picnics, tailgate paties. Will be making this a lot I am sure.  Thank you for sharing, Doreen!

This was awesome.  Made some changes, though.  This loosely resembled a muffuleta to me, so I added olive salad and used that instead of the black olives.    I grabbed Italian Sweet bread (maybe by mistake, maybe not) and while I'd rather a true Italian loaf in the future for myself, my husband loved how that offset the tartness from the vinegar.  Nonetheless, we both loved it.  And the longer it sat, the better it got!  (Just be careful how you slice the bread as this is juicy and if you slice too thin on one side, you will not have bread the next day...)

This is a great sandwich and looks very nice sliced from a round bread.  I took it to a potluck but, it was almost too big to fit on a plate.  Would be great at a Super Bowl party.  I used red wine vinegar instead of tarragon and basil instead of lettuce, no tomato as suggested by another reviewer.  I also pulsed the oil mixture in my mini processor. The basil was a VERY good call.  Can always get basil at Wegmans's if that grocer is available to you.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The sandwich lasted several days without getting soggy. My only complaints are that it ended up a little too salty for my taste (Next time I will use low sodium turkey breast and cut back on the meat) and that the garlic intensified over time leaving me with some serious garlic breath.

This is very good and also a nice change but not a 5 star to me. I cut back the oil to 1/3 cup and added finely chopped onion to the mushroom mixture and used balsomic vinegar. I made the mixture one day ahead. Made the sandwich before going to work in the morning and it was ready for supper on a busy evening for both of us. I was afraid of sog but was happy with the turnout. We both took leftovers for lunch today. Will make this again.

This is a really good sandwich and you could use your preference of meats and cheeses.  We added a little onion and yellow pepper rings.  I'll use individual small buns like kaiser rolls next time...maybe a little more vinegar and oil mixture, too.  Thanks for this one!!!

phenomenal treat to have a couple times a year.  Maybe to an outdoor concert in summer (as I did last night), and a Super Bowl party in winter?  
Made mostly as directed, but the possibilities are endless.

The recipe as written was way too strong of a vinegar flavor. It overpowered the sandwich. I will cut the amount down to suit my family's taste buds. The rest of the sandwich was a good match. I liked the use of the italian loaf bread hollowed out to hold the deli meats.

A definite keeper! Thanks so much for the recipe. I only had limes, so used those instead of lemons. Couldn't find tarragon vinegar at my grocery, so used this ital. seasoned red wine vinegar. I doubled it for a crowd, and maybe had too much dressing but the sandwiches were still a big hit and so easy.. we'll be making this recipe again and again.

I don't normally review things like this. But, I really liked the dressing. Combined everything into my food processor and blended it until smooth and it was a absolutely awesome topping. Works great as a salad dressing also. Thanks!

So yummy!!  We made it on a longer loaf of Ciabatta.  My husband and I ate two pieces of it for lunch and then invited another couple over to finish it up with us for supper.  So we got six servings out of it.  Everyone loved it!  My husband wants me to make it for his work lunches now.

Tried this and used roasted red pepper instead of olives (finace doesn't like them.) It was good but I was not crazy about the vinegar in the spread. I usually LOVE vinegar and used the correct amount but it overpowered the other ingredients. Maybe next time I will leave it out. Make sure you use a thinner bread also or it is too big for your mouth.

I really loved this sandwich! I bought 6 massive sandwich rolls, cut them in half, and put them together in an assembly line. I made one vegetarian and one without tomatoes for special diets. I used only one clove of garlic and half of the oil and it was the perfect amount.

It seemed really good at first but the more I ate the more the garlic became to much and the mushrooms could have been left out. I think I'll keep the meat and cold cuts with some oil/vinegar.

I threw a picnic and made sandwiches for all of my friends. I chose this one for my super carnivore friend Jason, and he loved it. I didn't eat it (I'm a vegetarian), so I can't say exactly how delicious it was, but Jason assured me it was fantastic and that he would have eaten a second one, had I made it for him. I did try the olive/mushroom mixture, which I made the night before, and it was awesome. oh! and I made his sandwich on a croissant from my favorite bakery. yay.

I made this for my husband and his friends, and they really liked it. It got kind of soggy, though. I don't know if there's really any way to fix that. My husband wasn't a huge fan of the dressing that went with it, and I think I might use some Italian dressing next time.

mmmm, this is so good. While i was making it i couldn't stop dipping the scooped out bread into the dressing! I used 2 1lb loaves as suggested by another and there was plenty of meat and cheese to go around. I also added some banana peppers because i love em. I made this for a super bowl party and it was a huge hit!

We LOVED these! I used red wine vinegar instead of tarragon vinegar, and omitted the parsley as we don't care for it. Husband added a little mayonnaise, and English mustard. This was so delicious and filling. Thanks, Doreen!

Wonderful and easy.  Didn't use the mushrooms, but did put in some finely minced peppercini to spice up the spread.  Also used fresh basil and Italian parsley from the garden.  I loved it-hubby would rather have mayo and mustard.  What does he know?    This would make an excellent dip or pasta topper.

The dressing is what makes this sandwich incredible. That being said, don't waste your dollars on high-end deli meat like I did because guess what? You can't taste that expensive meat in here, you taste the amazing dressing. Save your dollars and use that deli meat on a sandwich that has a MILD dressing or mayo. That's my two cents! :)

I have made this sandwich many times and it never fails! It's great for gathering as it can be prepared in advance (and it tastes better next day). The only change I make to this is to skip tomatoes. With the dressing, the sandwich is already quite moist. Juice from tomatoes almost make it soggy. Other than that, this is my go-to recipe when I feed the masses!!

This was a hit at a superbowl party.  I didn't even get to taste it.  But everyone loved it. I used a raspberry vinegar as I didn't have tarragon, turkey meat only and added spinach leaves on the lettuce layer for added nutrition.  People commented on these sandwiches all night.

Really great sandwich!  I couldn't find the Italian round loafs at my local bakery so I made my own (google "italian crusty loaf" - I used the first recipe that came up).  The oil/vinegar mixture is awesome.  I doubled the recipe but only used 1/2 cup chopped olives and that was plenty.

Very thick and filling sandwich with great flavor.  I topped it with thinly sliced red opinion and sweet banana peppers.  However, the bread was soggy. (I used a long loaf of Italian bread, which wasn't heavy or crusty.) Next time I'll reduce the amount of olive oil slightly and omit the lemon juice to reduce the liquid and prevent sogginess.

I love Sub sandwhiches and these are at the top of the list.  They were easy to make and the addition of the Italian dressing added a nice authentic sub shop flavor!
