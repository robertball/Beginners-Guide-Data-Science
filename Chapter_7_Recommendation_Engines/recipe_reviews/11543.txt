I substituted Holiday Raic Krispies for the corn flakes in this recipe, and all the kids in our kids club loved them, and the Mom's loved the layered jars as well!!

I made up these jars last Christmas for my husband to give his co-workers.  I substituted holiday (red & green) M&M's for the choc. chips and they really were beautiful.  They take some time to put together, but they are well worth the effort...and they're yummy too.

I received a jar of this mix from some friends of ours.Having never made cookies from a jar, I was worried about the dryness of the finished dough, but they turned out GREAT! I absolutely LOVE the flavor and texture of these cookies! I couldn't stop eating them! I did find the brown sugar was a little hard when I emptied out the jar, but I just broke it up between my fingers. I'll be making this recipe for myself and for gifts.

Maybe I did something wrong, but mine turned out awful.  They spread too thin and I had a tough time getting them off the cookie sheet.  I did use quick oats instead of rolled.  Could that be the difference? And the recipe simply said corn flakes. Was I supposed to crush them first.  If I try again, I'll make these two changes and report back.

We made this as a 4H project, very easy and fun. The kids decorated the jar lids with fabric and raffia. We had the cookies for a snack. We had great reviews from parents and friends who received them as gifts.

What a fun activity to do with kids. I attatched a list of ingredients, the wet ingredients to add and baking details to it and sent it home as a back-yard day camp baking project. We added some M&M's in place of 1/2 the chocolate chips to add more color to the mix - and cookies!

These are yummy!  If you follow the direction exactly, they turn on perfectly, just like bakery, big cookies.  Make sure they are 2 inch balls on the pan!  Great find for the jars and just to make on my own!

I received these a a jar cookie gift years ago and they turned out delicious.  Now I make them all the time as a cookie recipe and always get rave reviews.  Make sure and eat them quickly as they don't keep well.
