These are really great cookies! Mine took a little longer to bake (maybe about 11 minutes). I left them in until they started to crack a bit on the top and looked like they had set. I used the Ghiradelli candy white chocolate for the coating and it worked better than the white chocolate with the shortening - I tried both and the candy was smoother and easier to use. Both tasted amazing! I just preferred the ease of the candy! Delicious!!! My husband said they tasted like brownies with chocolate on top!

I made these cookies years ago from a recipe I found in a Hershey’s book. I lost it during the last move but realized this was the same. My husband confirmed on the Hershey’s site that it matches so mystery solved! I made the cookie batter exactly as it called for. My first batch on the cookie sheet I made too large so I started to make them smaller and worked out great. They do puff up a little but retains their shape for the most part. The only thing I did differently was the white chocolate. I put some in a ziplock bag, microwaved until soft and snipped off a corner to drizzle it on. This created more of a bandaged look. I didn’t add shortening because I didn’t want it to runny and then the drizzle melt into one big layer. The cookies taste like cakey brownies (which I don’t usually care for, I want fudgy) but these pack so much flavor they are delicious!
