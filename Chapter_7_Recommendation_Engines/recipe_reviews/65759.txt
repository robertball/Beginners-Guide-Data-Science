No need to carefully measure ingredients here, just add to your taste bud's content--that's the beauty and fun of true cooking! I prepared this pretty much as directed using a good brand of canned San Marzano tomatoes (the best!) and added a glug of Chianti to the sauce.  The aroma was mmmm, so good, and the dish itself was delicious, flavorful and the perfect accompaniment to the "Grilled Marinated Shrimp" I served with it. As an Italian gal used to Italian cooking and food, I can tell you this combination of typical Italian ingredients is pretty good stuff!

This was EXCELLENT! This had so many great flavors going on and everything went well together. Wonderful blend of textures too. I used the bacon grease and a splash of olive oil to sautee the onions, peppers, and garlic in. I used sun dried tomatoes instead. I cut this down to a couple of servings and it came out perfectly. I highly recommend this dish, it is fantastic.

this dish was so good and so easy to prepare.  i didn't bother with cleaning the skillet after frying the bacon...i just used the bacon grease and threw the rest of the ingredients in the same skillet.  i also added basil and a splash of dry white wine and omitted the bell pepper (not a favorite here).  i didn't even bother measuring the ingredients...this is pretty much a no-fail recipe.  i tossed the sauce with angel hair pasta and it was simply perfect!

This is a keeper!  It takes very little prep work other than roughly chopping veggies, contains staples I usually have on hand anyway, and the smell of the bacon and tomatoes cooking is heavenly!  I emptied the bacon grease to cut down on the fat but didn't clean the pan our before cooking the onions to keep some additional flavor.  I also added a splash of red wine to make the flavor a little heartier and mushrooms for more  texture.  We were out of Parmesan, and it's just great even without cheese.  My husband, a meat and potatoes kind of guy, loved this and had seconds (and he's on a diet!)  I advise against using spaghetti noodles...the rotini or fusili make it easier to get the veggies and pasta together in one bite.

Easy to make and delicious.  I cut the olive oil to 1/4 cup, and used 1 lb turkey sausage instead of bacon.  I've made with both black & green olives vs black olives & capers.  Both are great!  And don't be afraid to use the full amount of the onions.

FABULOUS! I skipped the bacon and added 1.5 lb of cooked Italian sausage. I cut the oil back to 1/4 c and added 1/4 c. butter. I used seasoned diced tomatoes and 1/4 each of green and black olives - oh I also added a pkg of fresh mushrooms at the end. I put everything in a casserole for a get-together a few hours later and reheated in oven with Asiago cheese on top. Be generous with the flat leaf parsley, garlic and crushed red pepper! Got rave reviews! I will make again soon.

This dish was alright.  I thought it would be better as it had capers and olives, two of my favorites.  However, it seemed to be missing something.

This was good, follow the ingredients but didn't measure.  Next time I will leave out the bacon as it got a bit soggy and I didn't like the texture, however, liked the flavor.

Delish! I forgot to add the bell pepper, and I topped with a italian cheese blend. I think I may add just a bit more bacon next time.

Yum! I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and drained the bacon grease, and I also didn't add the olives and capers (because of personal preference). Don't be afraid to really cook the bacon, because simmering it in the tomato sauce will soften it up.

This was okay, but wasn't really good enough to me to deserve five stars. I've tried other pasta recipes on this site that I like better, so even though this dish was alright, I probably won't be making it again.

An easy meal and a popular one in my house.  I added cubed saute√©d chicken seasoned with garlic, salt and parika to make it a full meal.  I used a little of the bacon grease and added olive oil to it for the onion; and after draining the pasta, I salted it lightly and tossed it with olive oil and basil before adding it to the mixture, so that some seaoning made its way into the grooves of the rotini.  Also used fresh, very ripe tomatoes instead of canned ones.  Next time I'll use Italian sausage.

With a few modifications, this turned out to be soooo good. I emptied the bacon fat out of the pan but didn't clean the pan. Instead of olive oil, I cooked ONE medium onion in the remaining grease. While cooking the onion, garlic, tomatoes, peppers and parsley, I added a touch of olive oil to the mix. Instead of using all plum tomatoes, I used one can of tomato paste (add water to desired consistency) and one 14 ounce can of whole chopped tomatoes. I added more garlic and parsley than was called for and substitued the red pepper for yellow. I chose green olives and fusilli pasta... seriously great stuff.

Very good.  I added extra bacon and cut down on the oil.  Like another reviewer said, be generous with the red pepper, garlic and parsley (and the capers too!).  I added mushrooms to mine as well, but don't think I'll do that next time even though I really like mushrooms...they didn't seem to "fit".  I may add chicken though, and extra parm.

I omitted the olives since my husband doesn't like them, but this was a fantastic recipe! Delicious and quick! I also doubled the red pepper flakes, for a nice and spicy dish! Thanks for this great recipe!!

We enjoyed this recipe, but I did cut the amount of onion in half. While we both like onions, two seemed like it would be too much. I certainly wouldn't make this often due to the fat content from the bacon, but it was a nice treat!

Yum!  This is very easy--only prep is chopping veggies.  I rarely make bacon for any other reason than eating it for breakfast or BLTs, and so I usually have a Costco sized bag of real crumbled bacon in the fridge.  I just used that for this dish so didn't go through the whole bacon frying for this.  I added a can of mushrooms for the bf, and used both green and black olives.  If I'd made this just for me, I'd have upped the capers (I LOVE them!) but since bf is indifferent to them, I left as is, and he felt it was fine.  I like the flavors in this, and it was a good place for me to use some of our tomatoes (we have a bunch I'm worried will go bad, so I chopped those and used a 14.5 can of tomatoes with them).  Very easy and quick; don't let the long list of ingredients fool you.  You can sub in this easily--and add or subtract ingredients to your heart's content.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this dish last night and it tasted fantastic. I've used turkey bacon and had no drippings. I also didn't have any capers, so I've used yellow peppers in its place and regular olive oil.  I've also used regular tomatoes instead of canned plum tomatoes. It came out so good--I have leftovers for another night. I would make it again with capers.

I will definitely make it again. It tasted better than I even thought. It had a nice spicy flavor, but not too much. When I make it again, I think I'll change some stuff, not because it's not good, just to see how it tastes with different amounts of ingredients. If you have not tried this, I highly suggest you do.

We thought this dish was excellent it had a lot of flavor and was fairly easy. I did use (2)14 ounce cans of diced tomatoes, fresh garlic and herbs. The pepper flakes gives this dish a lot of flavor but can be tweaked for personal taste. Served with salad and crusty bread - a hearty meal

It was only OK, However to be fair, I used 1 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the plum tomatoes. (I had one.. I needed to use it.) 

There was a really weird flavor to it/aftertaste that I attribute to the crushed tomatoes as well. I am assuming it might be much better with the different tomatoes?
