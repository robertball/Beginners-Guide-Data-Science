It doesn't get any easier than this. I had this ready in less than 15 minutes. I love Wholly guacamole and it is very affordable and convenient when you don't have time to make your own.

I made these by mixing hamburger meat and salsa....then microwaving the cheese on top of the chips on each individual plate, then each person added their own toppings along with the meat. It was great. I doubled the recipe and five of us cleaned it up!! GOOD recipe.

Among the best nachos I've had. Only change was to drop the jalapeno (don't like spicy) and the guacamole (too $$). Will definitely do this one again! - with margaritas!!

Delicious nachos!! Only changes I made were no guacamole (didn't have any ) and used sour cream. I didn't mix the salsa in with the meat because I only had super spicy salsa and didn't want to burn the kids mouths!!
