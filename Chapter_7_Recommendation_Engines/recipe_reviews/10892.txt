I've preferred to make it a little less sweet and more peanut buttery. The measurements were just a little bit different.  For those ppl who were a little bit dissatisfied with this one, I would recommend trying 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1cup creamy peanut butter and 1cup crunchy peanut butter.  It will be a bit less sweet, but I think more peanut buttery.  I sometimes add a handful each of pb and chocolate chips.

Good and peanut buttery, for sure! Between the peanut butter chips and double the amount of  peanut butter to shortening (it's usually even/steven) these are not short on peanut butter flavor.  Just made slight modifications of adding a little vanilla, using traditional shortening and creamy peanut butter.  They're very good, but not outstanding, and because they were putzy to roll into balls because of the plentiful chips getting in the way I'm pretty sure I'm not likely to make these again.

This is the most awesome PB cookie recipe! I usually make things right to the letter but this one I do cut back on the white sugar to 1/2 cup and I add chopped peanut pieces to it as well.  TRES YUMMY!!!

Great base recipe but I took some cues from previous reviews and tweaked a bit. I used 3/4 c. of each of the sugars and 1/4 c shortening and 1/4 c butter. With using the butter and shortening it helps these cookies hold longer without getting hard. I made some and gave them to some friends and am already getting requests for more.

This is a great recipe!  I ate half the dough before it even made it to the oven!  If you're not getting intense peanut butter flavor, the problem is probably your peanut butter, not the recipe.  Brands like Jif and Skippy are *terrible* for cookies.  You want natural, no additive peanut butter.  Freshly made if you can get it.

These are beautiful, tasty, delicious cookies. I had no pb chips and I used real butter instead of shortening.  I couldn't imagine they would have turned out any better though.

Really good cookies.  Not as peanut buttery as I would have liked, but have a good flavor.  The amount of chips used is a bit too much - I suggest cutting the amount of peanut butter chips in half.

Loved these peanut butter cookies.  I add peanut butter chips to other peanut butter cookie recipes frequently, just to up the peanut flavor.  The only change I made was to use 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening since I don't have butter flavored shortening.  This one went into the cookie keeper file.

It's a good recipe, but immensely sweeter than it should be. Some serious adjustments to the sugar quantity must be done.

GREAT COOKIES!!!!  I generally don't change a recipe from the get-go, but had to on this one out of necessity.  I used real butter and only had about 1/4 cup of chunky peanut butter so the rest was creamy.  Didn't matter.  The cookies came out very good.  Nice and chewy even when cooked a little longer than i should have.  This will be my new peanut butter cookie recipe.  My 3 sons can't get enough of them!!!

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES EVER!  These are moist, creamy, rich, and most of all- PEANUT BUTTERY!  I used the full amount of PB chips in the recipe and while you can't "roll" them into balls because the chips fall out, you can easily form them into the cookies.  Mine took 12 minutes to cook but even ones i thought were undercooked and then overcooked turned out DELICIOUS.

These turned out great for me. I used regular Crisco and added a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring. I didn't worry about these coming out pretty, I just used my small cookie scoop and lightly pressed with a fork to make crisscross shapes. Because I was low on peanut butter chips, I used a cup of the Reese's peanut butter chips and a handful of the fun-size Butterfingers that I crushed. Nine minutes at 350* was just right. I suggest you let these cool a couple minutes on the baking sheet before you move them because they will tear like heck. I wouldn't recommend using a cheap peanut butter, either. You'll get a greasy, ugly cookie. I speak from experiance.

Great recipe and easy to make. I only had 1 cup of PB chips on hand so that's what I used. I agree with others... using more than 1-1/2 cups of chips would just be a waste. Other than that, I used the amounts shown, and found that 1-1/2 inch balls made 29 cookies, each about three inches in diameter.  I'll make these again.

Reduce both sugars to 1/2 to 3/4 cup each. Use:  1/4 c shortening and 1/4 c butter, half creamy half crunchy pb,  1/2 cup pb chips and 1/2 cup semi-sweet choc chips. 2 cups of chips is way too much. Especially if: 3/4 c chopped peanut pieces are added. Butter and shortening makes the cookie chewy without getting hard.

This cookie has fantastic peanut butter flavor but unfortunately they're too sweet for me.  If I make this recipe again I will have to reduce the white and brown sugars by 1/4 cup each to make this edible for me.  I don't like cookies that are overly sweet.  I used Simply Jif Peanut Butter as well which is lower in sugar and sodium.  As I said, great peanut butter flavor but too sweet as is for me to make again per the recipe.

I checked three times to make sure I followed the recipe to a T and I did but they were very dry and crumbly.  I have used other peanut butter cookie recipes before and simply added peanut butter chips.  I thought I'd try this one but don't care for it.  Too dry and too crumbly.

These were alright.  Honestly, they seemed a little dry to me.  I used the Reese's Pieces baking chips instead of the regular.  It was good, but I'm going to stick to my old recipe.

Great cookies!  I followed the recipe except I used butter and only 11 ounces of peanut butter chips.  I only baked them for 8 minutes and they came out perfect.  Very moist on the inside with just a little crunch around the edges.  According to my husband it was packed full of gooey  goodness.  It has a great peanut butter taste.

I was in the mood for peanut butter, but I didn't have any peanut butter chips.  I made these with some semi-sweet mini morsels and a little coconut and they were really good.  I can't wait to try them with the peanut butter chips.

These are very good the next day. Used butter instead of shortening. Great combination of chewy, crispy, and soft.  Definitely worth trying.
Would actually like to give 4 and 1/2 stars.

I LOVE THESE COOKIES!  They are soft on the inside and chewy on the outside.  The chips definitely make the cookie.  I only used 1 cup this time, but I think next time I will put in 1 and 1/2 cups chips.  I also used butter instead of shortening.  I am a huge peanut butter cookie fan and this is my new favorite recipe.  Try these, YOU WILL LOVE THEM!

I made them exactly like the recipe called for, except that I substitued a bag of milk chocolate/peanut butter swirled chips instead of plain peanut butter chips.  SUPER YUMMY!  Also, I would probably use butter next time instead of shortening.  I prefer a softer cookie, as opposed to crispier.
I would recommend to ALL!!!

My name is Andrea and I am 10 years old. I made these cookies with a little help of my dad.We kind of switched a few things around. Instead of using the peanut butter chips I used extra  peanut butter. I give these cookies a 4 star rating because it was my first time baking these cookies. I think they were pretty good though, if I do say so myself.

My husband says that these are the best peanut butter cookies he's ever tasted...even better than his mom's!  They're yummy, and I don't even really like peanut butter cookies.

Way too many chips. By the end I had more chips than dough. I cup would have been plenty with the chunky peanut butter.

Pretty decent, but not quite a 5-star. I decreased the sugars to 3/4 c each and added 1/2 tsp vanilla. I also used 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c regular shortening. I do think the butter shortening is the key for next time.  After a few batches, I found that 8.5 min was perfect in my oven. I may try this again by decreasing the flour by 1/4 to 1/2 c next time and increasing the chunky peanut butter to 1.5 cups. I used a 10 oz bag of Reese's peanut butter chips, but would use less next time as well. The texture was a tad drier than I'd hoped, but think it will improve with a few tweaks.

These are fantastic! I needed a recipe without vanilla or baking powder and this fit the bill.

The only suggestion I have is bake them closer to 10 minutes, until the edges are golden. My first batch was a little under cooked.

I love these cookies!  I've made them twice, once with peanut butter chips, and once with semisweet chips.  We love both so much!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Very dry and not peanut buttery at all.  I was dissappointed especially after reading all of the reviews.  I was a little concerned with the large amount of flour and small amount of peanut butter as well as the absence of butter.  They crumbled to pieces when I tried to pick them up.  I have used other recipes for peanut butter cookies and was trying to find something better.  I am still looking.  Will not use this recipe again.

The PERFECT peanut butter cookies! Soft and chewy, a little salty, a little sweet. The addition of the chips makes a good cookie, terrific! I used a mix of peanut butter and chocolate chips and only used one cup total. I think next time, and there will definitely be a next time, Ill do 1 1/2 cups.
Wonderful Recipe!

My husband LOVED these.  I did alter the recipe some.  Creamy peanut butter in place of the crunchy and as others did, I only used 1 cup of peanut butter chips.
