I served mine with a cucumber sauce made of crushed cucumbers, sour cream, and garlic and it was amazing!  We also topped it with fresh onions and feta cheese.  I also stabbed the meat a lot before I cooked it to make it nice and tender.

Boy, did I have happy people at the table last night when I fed them these gyros!  I'd never cooked venison before so was a little intimidated when my husband went deer hunting in his Volvo station wagon (Now called the Deer Slayer). THIS RECIPE ROCKS!  The only change I made was to use fresh instead of dried rosemary.  I marinated the meat maybe 5 hours.  It was very quick to stir-fry, and then I served it with "Peppy's Pita bread" and "Duke" sauce, both from this site.  Yum - what a meal.  Wish I'd had some bozouki music going!  Oh - this marinade & cooking method would probably work for just about any boneless meat you have handy.  Do try it.

I just keep eating this and I am more of a fish or chicken person!! I thinly sliced a backstrap and marinated the meat for about 6 hours.I cook a lot of venison and this recipe is going to be made year round.  I can't wait to be able to throw some on the grill.  YUM I served the meat on Artisan flat bread with sour cream and raw onions as a garnish.  But the meat is sooooo good all by itself that garnish is not necessary.

Loved the marinade! We have a freezer full of venison so we are always looking for new ways to prepare it. We added, as a garnish, a dill and Greek yogurt sauce (1 cup Greek yogurt, tbsp lemon juice, tbsp dried dill, dash of garlic powder and a dash of salt.) We also topped with tomato and fresh green pepper. We liked it so much we submitted a picture!

Made this last night for a hungry crowd and everyone - even the picky eaters - was happy.  I used chicken fried steak cut venison b/c that is mostly what is left in my freezer at this point, but it still turned out great.  Served w/ a yogurt sauce made of 1C nonfat plain greek yogurt, 1/3C minced cucumber, and 1tsp (each) of dried basil, onion powder, and lemon pepper.  Really nice to have a hot summer-appropriate way to serve venison rather than the usual heavy soups, stews, etc.

This is the best!!  My family and I could not stop eating this.  All the leftovers went also.  I think this will become a family favorite and I have been sharing the recipe.  One tip; I cut the meat when still partially frozen.  It is much easier to get the 1/4 inch cut this way.

Delicious and easy!  I used the tip end of a venison tenderloin, sliced it thinly while it was still partially frozen, and cooked it on a very hot griddle in batches.  Served with all the regular gyro accompaniments (tzatziki sauce, feta, onion, tomato.)  A real hit with the family.  (P.S. - Venison is not something I usually have, but was given some by my son's co-worker.  I'm sure it would be great with either lamb leg or beef tenderloin.)

I have been trying various recipes using venison.  My husband really liked this one. The only thing I did different is adding sliced onion, when cooking. I served in pita bread, with fresh tomato wedges, raw thinly sliced onion, Tzatki (or however you spell that cucumber yogurt garlic sauce) and cumin-spiced rice.  Will make again when i have venison OR beef strips to cook.

This recipe rocks..... Used antelope instead of deer and it was awesome. Make cucumber gyro sauce to go with it. Both quick n easy.

I followed everything as directed but used lamb instead of venison. The flavor of the marinade was excellent, and the lamb was as tender as I've ever had. I would've give this a 5th star if it also had a cucumber sauce to go with it.

Unbelievably delicious!  All four of my boys went back for seconds--a phenomenon akin to a sighting of Halley's comet.  A cucumber sauce (as another reviewer recommended (thank you!), strips of red onion, and grated feta cheese are must-haves to make this dish truly remarkable.  This recipe will surely help me use up the deer meat in our freezer.

Awesome! I used ground venison (because that's what we have in the fridge) and it was equally delicious! Definitely a worthwhile spin on the classic gyro.

I liked it.  The flavor of the venison could have passed as beef. I don't know if it was the combination of flavors or the type of meat. I'll probably make this again. I used balsamic vinegar.

great flavor, I used this to make venison donaires-added monteray jack cheese, hot peppers and onion.  I will use this ratio of spices for many meats-I think it woud taste great on shrimp or prok tenderloin kabobs-thanks for sharing

This is superb; my kids love it too! I make the recipe as written and have used poorer cuts of meat and it still turns out fantastic. I always slice the venison really thin while it is still a little frozen, the tougher the cut of meat the longer I let it marinade.. I make a cucumber dill sauce, chop fresh tomatoes and serve the gyros on grilled pita bread.  This is one of my families favorite dinners.

I marinated these for several hours, but the marinade was a little dry so I added some milk, they turned out awesome! My husband said considering it was venison they still tasted pretty authentic. I'm not a huge gyro person but I did enjoy them. We served them with tzatziki sauce that I made between two recipes on this site. My husband was raving about them, though, and I had several people ask for the recipe. One of the people made it a couple nights later, true to recipe, and her family also raved about them!

This turned out great, I will for sure make it again. I used a backstap and sliced it very thin while it was still half frozen. I served it with lettuce, sauteed onions, a creamy ranch sauce, fine cut cucumbers, and pita bread.

what a great recipe!  I whipped up a quick dressing of sour cream, cucumbers and dill to go with this.  also, I didn't have any pita bread handy so I used flour tortillas which worked out awesomely.  I didn't have red wine vinegar either, so I used balsamic, which was fine.  the one adjustment I will make in the future is to halve the rosemary or leave it out altogether... I don't particularly care for rosemary, just a personal preference.  this recipe flew off our plates and I will definitely be making it again!  thanks for sharing this recipe :)

Very good recipe. I substituted regular rosemary because I didn't have any ground on hand, I don't recommend doing that. :) I think next time I'll cut back a little on the cumin also. I also served it with the traditional greek cucumber sauce, sliced red onion, sliced tomato, and feta cheese. YUMMY!!

I am rating this 5 star but I really would've loved it if it would have had a cucumber sauce recipe to go with it.  However, the recipe is great and if you are looking for a new way to cook your venison then you should give this one a try.  The only thing I will say that other reviewers didn't say is that the marinade is kinda dry.  I guess I was thinking of more of a liquid marinade.  I had to double and triple check the recipe to make sure I had all the ingredients right.  But it does cover the meat after you have mixed all of it together.  I will try to find a great cucumber sauce before I make this again, but I will be making it again.

Absolutely loved this recipe! My husband even said it was better than our local Greek-owned gyro restaurant. I used pork tenderloin instead of venison, and substituted 1 tablespoon of Greek seasoning mix per lb. of meat instead of the spices. I will definitely be making this again. I also used the cucumber sauce recipe on here, eliminating the mustard (since a Greek reviewer said mustard is not authentic).

brilliant. creative. inspiring. thank you! I have a freezer full of venison from my father in law and this recipe will be a smash all winter long! I love the spices, but will play with them this winter. I'm thinking jamaican allspice along with the cumin. cool cucumber yogurt/sour cream sauce is a must. I am going to search for more of your recipes. keep it up!

I've made this exactly as written three or four times now.  And my family devours it.  I stuff it inside Peppy's Pita Bread (found on this website) and pour Yia Yia's Tzatziki Sauce (also found on this website) on top.  Yum!  Yum!

We have lots of wild game in our freezer--venison and elk--and I'm always looking for something new to do w/ it. This recipe is truly amazing! I served the gyros w/ diced fresh tomatoes and a cucumber sauce I made. This will be one of our dinner favorites from now on.  Thanks!

Fabulous!
As soon as I mixed up the marinade, I knew this was a keeper. Mmmmm!  Homemade Tzatziki Sauce, tomatoes, red onions, some wheat pita and the venison made one of the top 5 meals ever!

Great way to cook venison! I had never cooked venison and was given some by a friend. I look forward to using this recipe again.

Only giving it 4 stars because this recipe needs to include a cucumber/sour cream sauce to be complete. We made our own from pureed and drained cucumber, sour cream, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Served with sliced red onions, tomatoes and lettuce (with a little Sriracha hot sauce on top), and MAN... it's gooooood.

I thought this was a great and unique way to serve venison.  I marinaded the meat for a few hours. Next time I will marinate over night for more flavor.  I used one of the Tzatziki (sp) sauce recipes from this site.  My only problem - finding good pita bread!?! 2 Thumbs Up. Will definitely make this again.

Amazing!  I will be making this again. I only marinated about an hour and that was plenty. Only change was I always thaw my venison in salt water in the fridge for a few hours or overnight. It draws out the blood and you never have that wild taste that many people say when they dislike venison.

Fabulous!  We did us lamb instead of venison because that is what we had on hand.  The flavors were perfect and replicated the sandwich we usually buy at a local Greek restaurant.  This has become one of our family favorites.

I marinated the venison for 24 hours.  I air fried some home style french fries and sliced fresh tomatoes and romaine lettuce for toppings. "My won't eat  anything new "son loved it! Only thing I would add is some cheese maybe  fetta.  The family said they would want me to make this again.

This was a fantastic recipe! The marinade was so good that the venison didn’t even make it into the gyros. I just sliced the steak and served with a bed of wild rice. My very picky 10yo said it was the best meat he’s ever had. Mom normally does the “good cooking” (I’m just the cooking support) so the compliment was was a great testament to this wonderfully easy and delicious recipe.

Turned out alright. I didnt like how the meat tasted so much like taco meat, too much cumin. It also did not taste much like a gyro as I have had them, and love them. So i probably wont be making this again. Just made me crave a real one.

Very easy to make.  I made the recipe exactly as listed and let it marinade overnight.  My whole family loved it!  I used Naan bread, tomato, thinly sliced onion and served with a cucumber dill sauce.  I personally don't eat venison, but will also try the marinade with chicken real soon!

The seasonings in this recipe are delicious and complement venison well. Our whole family loved the recipe. I sautéed onions and bell peppers to serve with the meat, and made a yogurt sauce like others suggested. The flavor combination was sublime.
Changes: I used balsamic vinegar (that's what I had), and I probably over-seasoned because we had less meat than the recipe called for.

I used this recipe for ground beef minus the oil and cooked it up taco style, it was amazing. I loved it. I used goat cheese and Roma tomatoes and alfalfa sprouts and spinach in my kronos pita bread. My husband likes to add a little chopped onion and cucumber sour cream sauce. A go to recipe for us

Family loved it! My only modification was to use 1.5 lb. ground venison instead of steak strips. I let it marinate for about an hour. While very, very good, next time I will increase the marinade time and add more spice, by perhaps about a third.

I love gyros, and venison but was very unsure of this at first. It was AMAZING!!!! Tip - don't skip the spices! Each one makes the difference in the dish. Especially the cumin, rosemary and marjoram! I added some homemade Tzatziki Sauce (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/tzatziki-sauce/), lettuce, tomato, onion and feta and I was in heaven!! Don't forget the greek salad on the side!

This was great! I did use ground venison like a previous reviewer. I made meatballs with this recipe, then after baking I simmered in beef broth with garlic, onion, and oregano. For low carb I dipped these in a yogurt sauce. My husband ate them in a pita bread with extra onion and peppers.

This was quite delicious and easy.  I didn't have marjoram, so I subbed half basil and half thyme.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I felt the meat could have been a bit more flavorful.  I think next time I will rub the venison with fresh garlic, salt and pepper, and then slice it and marinate it.  But my husband was very pleased with how I prepared his prized venison!  I too made the "Duke" tzatziki sauce to go with it--yum!

Excellent. I went 1.5x on the olive oil and vinegar as it didn't seem to make enough marinade. My son ate four helpings.

These came out great.  It really did taste like beef.  I made some tzatziki sauce with garlic powder, cubed cucumber, greek yogurt, and sour cream.  Delicious!!!

I have a hard time eating venison but we've made this recipe 3 times and we love it.  I wouldn't change a thing.
