The only change I may make is putting the curd on the cake before the whipped topping for better presentation.  Would make it again.

This cake is very good.  My husband says it is the best cake he’s ever eaten.   I was a tad too tart for me.  I followed the recipe except used fresh-squeezed regular lime juice.  Key lime juice was not available.   Next time I will cut down on the amount of lime zest.  There was too much for me.  The one thing I did add was I toasted  some shredded coconut and sprinkled it on top of the cake.  It added some sweetness and texture.   The lime curd was very tart and the coconut helped to balance it out.  I will definitely be making this cake again with those two minor changes.  Oh, and next time instead of a yellow cake mix I am going to use a white cake mix.

I am a huge fan of Key Lime anything! so when I saw this recipe in my in box, I had to try.  I didn't change a thing!  Its a delicious cake recipe.  The frosting takes time to make, but so worth it!

I made this for Memorial Day barbecue at a friends house. I honestly couldn’t wait to taste it. Well, it was fantastic desert!!  Moist and so flavorful. A big hit at the party. 
I would definitely make it again!!!!!!!
