We made this tonight, and subbed shrimp for crawfish, and I boiled the shrimp to make stock instead of chicken broth. It was a big hit! I like my bisque thicker, so I added some cornstarch in hot water. Served up on some French bread. I can barely breath.

It's okay.  Seafood stock should be used.

Outstanding.  Hadn't eaten crawdad bisque since my dad died....he used to fix it when we were kids.  Had to buy frozen precooked crawfish, it's too early in the year to catch them here (but ramps are up :).  Only thing I changed was to half the onion, used stock from a gumbo, and adjusted seasoning to taste.  Definitely a keeper, can't wait to try it with fresh crawdads.

Excellent - made as written and added an extra half pound of crawfish. Smooth, flavorful and you can control the heat. A definite keeper.

This was nice and creamy. Had only bought 16 oz of cream and just used that cuz I didn't have anymore. Came out ok. Also added celery by accident, thought it called for it. And no crawfish at my store, but used shrimp. This bisque was great and it's my first time having and making it Great job. I taste so gourmet!

Great recipe, I used "Better than Bouillon: Lobster Base" instead of chicken broth.

This.  Was.  Amazing.  I was honestly skeptical about the recipe because it seems TOO simple.  I loved it.  I improvised a bit because I did not have all of the things listed.  I used whole milk instead of half-and-half, and I omitted the cayenne pepper because I was out.  I was also reading another recipe that said to boil the shells in water and use that in the bisque, so I used half-chicken broth and half of the crawfish "stock".  SO GOOD!  Next time I make this I will probably try using all "stock" and omitting the chicken broth.  Once the soup was finished, I pureed it to make the whole thing smooth and then added the crawfish meat.  Seriously, I am sad that there is none left.  I loved every drop :)

My husband and I tried this, and we liked it very much :)  It was easy and tastey!  Next time we will probably add some type of veggie, just for a little crunch. we also used milk because we had no cream, we think it turned out just fine.  Once it was in the bowl we add just alittle cheese ... & served with toasted french bread!  Def. a keeper!

Sounds yummy. I am planning on making it this weekend. I did add the recipe to my SparkPeople food so I can have it for the nutrition information when I log it. Thanks! I am rating it as a 5 at the moment.

Good recipe.  I found it a little bland as is but added some extra worcesteshire, plus celery seed and old bay for extra flavor.  My hubby and I both really enjoyed it.

I made this exactly as written except I added more cayenne pepper as I couldn't taste the "just a pinch". I added  probably close to a whole teaspoon and it could have used more. If you think this is not as thick as you would like it just wait till it cools slightly it will thicken nicely. This was easier then I thought it would be and much better tasting then any bisque I've had in a restaurant. EXCELLENT!

It was a bit blander than I like, but nothing some extra cayenne pepper can't fix (and I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so that may be the problem). I did have boiled red potatoes left over because we boil them with our crawfish so I cubed some up and added it with the crawfish. VERY filling!

Made this tonight and it was a hit.  I had 12oz of frozen crawfish meat so I added about half a pound of shrimp cut up into small pieces.  Served it with sourdough bread.  Agree that if I'd had some seafood stock it would have been even better, but all in all it was really good and really easy!  I'm guessing the warmed up leftovers will be even more flavorful.

I've made this multiple times and everybody asks for the recipe,  delicious. Sometimes my friends put it over rice,  others add fresh sweet corn. I make as is.

OMG, This is awesome! I followed the recipe as written. The only thing that may be different is that I used my homemade chicken broth which is a delicious thick bone broth.  I also topped the soup with fresh ground pepper. I made 6 servings and my wife and I ate it all!

This is awesome! So easy to be so good!!! I made as directed except for adding a cup of frozen corn. Crawfish were left over from a crawfish boil. I sent corn and potatoes home with a guest otherwise I would have added some of them too. As suggested by another review I will boil crawfish heads for the stock next time instead of chicken broth. Also, forgot the cayenne---will use in leftovers. I think the crawfish used added plenty of heat. Yes, better than any I've had in a restaurant.

A bit leery in trying this recipe as it was too simple. Absolutely loved it. Added extra crawfish and used seafood broth instead of the chicken broth. Nice and creamy and not to heavy.. Going to try this with shrimp next.  It is definitely a keeper.

We had a crawfish boil, and we used the leftovers to make this bisque.  Can I just say YUM!!! It was a HUGE HIT!  In addition to the crawfish and onions, I added the leftover vegetables from the boil (mushrooms and potatoes).  It was the perfect touch!  I also seasoned the soup with chili powder, salt, and a little bit of cayenne instead of the Cajun seasoning since the fixings were already Cajun-spiced.  Again, I say YUM!

Easy & Yummy. We needed to use our leftover ingredients from the crawfish boil; this was perfect! I didn't add Cayenne, instead I added  Tony's. The vegetables were already seasoned from the boil. I did add 1 tablespoon of Paprika and fresh garlic. Big hit at my house!

This is an awesome recipe.  I add a can of shrimp bisque to it as well as Cajun seasoning.  I puree it and use cream instead of half and half and finish with a touch of cooking sherry.  Yummy and my kids love it.

This recipe was good. I used 3 cloves of garlic since hubs doesn't like onion. It probably would have benefitted from the onion flavor. I also omitted the cayenne since our crawfish was pretty spicy and my oldest is sensitive to spicy foods. I added a small amount of brown sugar to balance it out since I felt something was missing. This was a fantastic use of the extra tails I froze after our last crawfish boil. I ran them through the food processor for several pulses so the chunks of it weren't so huge. I used 4 cups, not sure how that works out weight-wize, probably more than necessary, but it wasn't overkill. I ate too much. I am definitely keeping this recipe for future crawfish leftovers. I'll possibly see about making up some stock and using that as others suggested.
