Thank you SO much for this recipe! I didnt change anything but I did add some jalapeno peppers just because! Oh and a sprinkle more flour because it looked too sticky. It cooked up wonderfully in my bread machine. This is one recipe that I will be making (too) often!!

Does make a really large loaf. I formed it into a large round and baked it on my baking stone. Delicious! (I had to add a little more flour as the dough was too sticky to handle. Otherwise perfect and easy to make.)
