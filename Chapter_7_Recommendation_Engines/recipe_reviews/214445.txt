This was really tasty. I made only one pizza, it was for my hubby and myself. I had one piece! It is sooo filling. I think you would have to feed an army if you were planning on making both, like the recipe calls for. My hubby, who usually can polish off 3/4 of a pizza ate two pieces. So good, but super filling. It was a nice change from regular pizza. We have a pizza stone for our grill, so we grilled it instead of baking it. Other than that I stuck to the recipe.
