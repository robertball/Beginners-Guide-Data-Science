We really enjoyed this recipe.  I made a few minor changes.  First of all, I pounded the chicken flat, placed a slice of cheese inside the chicken breast, then rolled it up and wrapped it with proscuitto - couldn't find parma ham.  Next, I thought the reduced balsamic vinegar sounded like a very strong flavor, so we just drizzled UNreduced balsamic vinegar over the chicken.  It was delicious!  I also cooked the potatoes in the microwave rather than boiling them.  I didn't really change the ingredients, just the process to make it simpler.

This was really, really good.  To the balsamic vinegar I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar, some minced garlic, some dijon mustard and a splash of hot sauce, just to give it some complexity.  When I stuffed the chicken with the cheese, I added a schmear of minced garlic and one basil leaf for extra flavor.  Before putting the chicken and tomatoes (which were wonderful, BTW) in the oven, I drizzled a little of the finished balsamic sauce and sprinkled a touch of mozzarella over the top.  The recipe didn't say whether to cook the chicken covered or uncovered, so I covered it for the first 15 minutes, then removed the cover.  The potatoes were terrific too.  I had picked up some really tiny potatoes (about the size of large marbles) and they worked perfectly for this dish.  Bottled pesto sauce was pretty expensive at the store, so I made my own. The combination of the sharp snap of the potato skins when I bit into them mixed with the great garlicky pesto was just lovely.  This dish made an enticing presentation and is certainly company worthy.  DH and I both loved this dish.  I can't say enough good things about it.  Thanks, Paula

Had to adjust recipe.  It did work out fabulously, but I added more seasoning to avoid an anemic look and sort of bland taste.  Added white pepper, garlic powder and paprika to add color.  If you add a good mushroom sauce, you got a 5 star item.

This was good and my family enjoyed it.  The only change I would make is not to use the reduced balsamic vinegar, but to marinade the chicken in balsamic vin. dressing overnight instead.  I think that would give the chicken great flavor.

I saw this recipe and instantly thought it was going to be a lot of work. Actually, it was VERY easy! I cut pockets first then marinated the chicken in balsamic dressing for about 4 hours. After that I stuffed with mozzerella and wrapped the chicken in Parma de Proscuitto. I also put fresh garlic on top after sprinkling with olive oil. The tomatoes were delicious and really made the flavor of the chicken wonderful. Next time I may find other things to stuff the chicken with, such as fresh basil or oregano. Also, I think this would be better with the potatoes chopped into pieces, THEN mixed with pesto. This will be a regular on our dinner rotation!

Made this for friends and was mortified when the chicken was completely raw after 30 min at 400.  They were forgiving and in the end we ALL loved it.  Great recipe.  Next time I will try some additional seasoning - maybe the basil leaf in with additional cheese.  Will definitely make again!

We enjoyed this recipe with our personal modifications based on other reviews. Dressed up the balsamic vinegar reduction with 1 tbsp. each brown sugar, minced garlic and dijon mustard. Lined flattened chicken breast with fresh basil leaves and marinated roasted red peppers. Also used mozzerella cheese sticks instead of shredded cheese that way it didn't ooze out the sides of the rolled chicken. Used prosciutto too.Sprinkled minced garlic on top of chicken and cherry tomatoes along with the EVOO and s/p. Covered dish for first 15 mins. Buttered potatoes first and then pesto. With the conversions, we really enjoyed this dish. Your inspiration though. Thank you!

I pounded the breasts flat and then sliced a pocket into them.   Take the time to make the balsamic vinegar reduction!  You can do it earlier in the day and just set it on the counter until suppertime.  The dish definitely wouldn't be the same without it.  It was delicious!

FYI fellow home-chefs: Parma ham *is* prosciutto :o)!  I marinated the breasts in balsamic dressing and did not do the "drizzle" as DH is NOT a vinegar fan.  I butterflied the breasts and rolled the cheese and ham inside-- a bit of work, but a nice presentation!  The roasted tomatoes were fantastic!  I used grape tomatoes and when I do this again I may do 2 pints.  For some reason my 13 yr old daughter wouldn't eat the chicken, but she LOVED the pesto potatoes, ate all the leftovers of them and has asked for them again!  I used new red potatoes, and they WERE yummy.  They were so easy to prepare that I'll be using them as a side dish for other suppers.

My family loved this.  My husband commented several times on how great this chicken tasted.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated except I used 1/2 mozz cheese stick for each chicken breast instead of sliced cheese.  I had the string cheese on hand and it was easy to stuff into the cut breast.

This was delicious!! The reason the chicken wasn't flavorful for others is the balsamic vinegar reduction wasn't used. It is a strong flavor to be used lightly over this dish or fresh mozarella and tomatoes. Use the reduction and this one is a for sure hit.

I was disappointed by the lack of flavor of the chicken- I wish I would have put garlic on it.   I wouldn't make this again.

I pretty much followed the exact recipe.  We thought this was great.  The reduced balsamic vinegar was an amazing taste with the chicken and cheese.  My husband said "Wow" when the first bite hit his mouth.  Thanks.  We'll make this again.

This chicken is very tasty!  I took some of the suggestions of other reviewers and marinated the chicken in balsalmic vinegar instead of reducing it.  I also added garlic powder to the marinade.  I pounded out the chicken and placed the cheese on top then wrapped a slice of plain ham around it.  The cherry tomatoes really complement the flavors, I added a little fresh basil with them.

This was okay - chicken didn't have a whole lot of flavor; maybe I should have read these other reviews first and added garlic powder. That sounds like a good idea. Hubby enjoyed it alot though.

This was a wonderful dish!  I did change a few things though.  I marinated the chicken for 4 hours in olive oil, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, basil, and oregano. I also added seasoning to the cheese  (I used shredded b/c that was all I had). The balsamic reduction really makes the dish!

The chicken recipe is fantastic!!! we didn't love the potatoes but live and learn.  The suggestions to add prosciutto and portabellos was excellent. I followed the Balsamic Vinegar suggestions too. Thank you for sharing!

Delicious!  I used prosciutto to wrap the chicken.  I also covered the chicken while it cooked and it came out so moist because of the juice from the tomatoes.  I broiled the chicken for a few minutes to brown the ham and get it somewhat crispy.  I accidentally over cooked my potatoes, so they ended up getting mashed.  I didn't have pesto around, so I added milk, some italian seasonings, and Parmesean cheese instead.  All in all this was a great meal.

I used Proscuitto for the ham.  I only put half of the cheese, because I thought it looked like alot of cheese.  I did not do the tomatoes.  I cooked the potatoes cut in quarters in a microwave steamer and put some with just butter and salt and some with the  pesto sauce.  I love pesto on pizza or French bread, but I would just do the potatoes with salt and butter next time.  The chicken was awesome, especially with the reduced vinegar. I think I would go ahead and add the original amount of cheese and maybe even the tomatoes next time. My children liked it (well, the 6 yr old didn't like the sauce, but the 8 and 17 year old loved it).  Hubby loved it as well (he likes balsamic vinegar, so I figured he would!).

This was good for a change of pace.  It is not something we would like often.  My husband loved the sauce but I found it a bit strong. I put mozzarella cheese on top a little before I took it out of the oven.  It gave it just the right touch.

KILLER. The only change I made was to use two slices of prosciutto per chicken breast, since one wasn't really cutting it. Plus, hey, more delicious prosciutto. Win/win. I can't wait to make this again.

Tasted great, and pretty simple to make.  I used white balsamic vinegar, small red potatoes, and made the pesto using the "Pesto Sauce" recipe found elsewhere in AllRecipes. Next time, I'll start the reduction of the balsamic vinegar at the same time as the potatoes are boiling. That way, it will lessen the time it has to thicken up like caramel (if it does, just warm it up so it liquifies enough to be drizzled over the chicken.)

I added roasted red pepper and a basil leaf to the cheese that I stuffed the chicken breast with.  I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and added some chopped fresh cloves in with the potatoes while baking.  Loads of flavor and very colorful when you cut into the chicken!  Great for dinner parties - can be assembled earlier in the day and popped in the oven.

Just an okay dish.  The chicken lacked flavor and I think if I make it again, I'd add some seasoning in with the cheese.  Picky hubby liked the ham and I thought the potatoes were the best part of it.

I was a bit dissapointed in this recipe. I don't think I would make it again. I thought the chicken didn't have much taste.

Excellent! Added Dijon. Mustard and garlic to the vinegar, marinated chicken in vinegar, garlic and Dijon mustard  1 hour. Would not change anything.

I did like this recipe.  I would change only 1 thing, I did add a little butter to the potatoes and a sprinkle of sugar to tame down the pesto, it was almost too salty.  I have a very picky daughter and she took to this dish well.

This was an ok recipe.  I wasn't crazy about the pesto potatoes.  My husband like it, but our son and I weren't fans.  The chicken was a little dry, next time I think it needs a little less time to bake.  But, overall, the chicken was pretty good.

This is going in my top five! It is so delicious and easy to make.  I mashed the potatoes, added a little cream cheese and then the pesto, and it was awesome.  The sauce is also very tasty, and very simple!  I'll be making this very often.

My family found this hugely delicious.  I didn't drizzle the balsamic vinegar on the kids, a little too strong.  I substituted rice cheese for my lactose intolerant ones and what a hit!  Will defintely be making this one again.

It was a good recipe but i think it would be better without the vinegar drizzled on it.  But other then that easy to make and good.
