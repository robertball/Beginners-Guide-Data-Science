This was very easy to throw together and delicious. Followed the recipe except for adding minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I also coated my chicken pieces in the cornstarch then poured the sauce mixture on top. This method allows the sauce to thicken as it cooks so there is no need to remove the chicken and then thicken the sauce, it works perfectly.

This recipe should be outlawed in every kitchen. OMG, I drank the leftover juices from the crock pot like it was soup. The second time I made it, I added vegetables to it, the possibilities of this recipe are endless. Thank you so much.

This was a nice dish. I did cut back on the honey by half and it was fine for me.. personal preference.  I dont have dried onions so I used some fresh. Added red peppers and broccoli to finished dish. One thing, thickening the sauce in the crockpot didnt work.. never thickened for me so I did this on stovetop

I read the reviews and made some adjustments.  We're not into "sweet" these days, so I cut the honey in half (personal taste preference).  I cooked on low, checked the crockpot at 2 hours, the chicken was cooked and tender, so I removed it from the crockpot and proceeded with thickening the sauce.  The sauce was not thickened after 20 minutes, so I added a bit more cornstarch and finished it on the stovetop.  I also added a little crushed red pepper flakes and a good squeeze of Sriracha sauce to kick up the heat just a bit.  Finally, quickly sautÃ©ed some veggies and stirred in at the end.  I'm not a huge fan of crock pot cooking, but this turned out pretty well, it certainly is easy, and keeps me out of the kitchen on this hot summer day.

A definite keeper!!!!  Very easy to do and had all the ingredients at home!  Followed the recipe pretty much as as written (changes were--->a little extra onion flakes, garlic powder and little less soy sauce).  Husband, 21 year old son and myself loved it!!! None of us thought it was too sweet; as an onion lover, I think I'll put a bit more onion in next time.  Chicken cooked in ~3 hours in my crock pot; sauce thickened up in about 5 minutes.

We liked this! For the sauce I did 1/2 cup honey, 1/4 cup + 2 tbls soy sauce, 1/4 cup ketchup & 1 tsp garlic powder. I used fresh diced onion and diced chicken breast. Cooked sauce, onion & chicken on high for 40 min then added 1 1/2 lb frozen broccoli for about 30 min and served over hot cooked white rice. The sauce was a little thin so next time I will thicken it but This ones a keeper! ??

This was not a favorite for our family.  At the end of the cooking time, I tasted the sauce and it was...sweet.  But nothing else.  There was no depth of flavor, nothing interesting, and it was not delicious.  Also, the chicken tasted dry.

This was very easy to put together and my kids devoured it but for my husband and myself it was only ok. In my opinion it was too sweet. I did sub fresh onion for dried minced onion. Cooking time will vary depending on your slow cooker. Personally mine cooks hot and was done faster than the 3-4 hours on low. I had no issues with the sauce thickening in the crockpot.

I love this recipe! I did find it a little too bland the first time that I made it, so I added less than a scant tablespoon of Chinese chili paste to it at the end, when I added the cornstarch and water. It really kicked it up a notch, and now it's perfect! It's now a "go-to" comfort food in my house. Going to make it again tomorrow.

made this on my sons ski night as i wouldnt have much time to prepare anything when we got home :) when we walked in the house it smelled great! i made a few additions and alterations to our personal taste. i added the cornstarch directly to the honey mixture and lightly coated chicken thighs also with cornstarch. i used some garlic powder, just a teaspoon, i halved the honey per other reviewers suggestions and im glad i did because it wasnt too sweet.   i added some red pepper flakes and some sliced green bell pepper along with a diced onion and lots of minced garlic. finally i added a dollop of dijion mustard to help cut down on the sweetness as well and used the soy sauce too! served it ontop of jasmati rice and what a treat. i may add some broccoli next time to make it a complete meal or maybe some fresh mushrooms if i have some since its a common stapple in my house. thankyou for this great recipe! will certainly make this again and again!

Easy to put together and uses common pantry items I always have on hand. I served it over Uncle Ben's jasmine rice which cooked in 10 minutes. An easy and short night in the kitchen!

Just made this tonight. I made a few variations for personal taste preference. I used almost a half cup of honey, added 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and cooked the recommended time. The chicken was a little dry but overall good. When we thickened up the sauce, we also had to move it to the stove top and my hubby added about an 1/8 cup brown sugar to make a sweet and spicy sauce. We ate it all, no leftovers tonight!!!

This is easy to put together and quite tasty.  My slow cooker must run hotter, because this was done much sooner than I anticipated leaving the chicken a little dry so I would watch the timing.  Unfortunately, I forgot to add the sesame.

Made this tonight for dinner.  It was delicious!  Even my pickiest eater liked it and that is saying something!!  Super easy to make.  I did decrease the brown sugar a bit but other than that I followed the directions as written.  I served it over Basmati rice and it was a hit!

Dinner time snuck up on me today.. And I missed the chance to get my chicken in the slow cooker. Had my heart set on making this so made it on the stove top. I sliced my chicken breasts into thin strips and sautÃ©ed them till almost cooked in olive oil. I added 2 shallots diced and the wet mixture which I added 2 large cloves of garlic to minced (instead of the powder). After reading reviews I cut back on the honey to 1/4 cup (figured I could add more after tasting if need be.. But didn't need or want to). I let this simmer covered on low for about 5 minutes.. And then uncovered and turned off stove to let thicken. Since I didn't use a slow cooker I decided it didn't need the cornstarch since not really much liquid accumulated during the quick cooking. 
Im not one to enjoy a sweeter chicken dish, but this was a nice change. I'm glad I cut back on the honey.. As I can see how that would be just too sweet and one noted. Use sodium reduced soy sauce. I'll make this again maybe adding some red pepper flakes for a nice bite. Also next time I'll be sure to garnish with sesame seeds. :)

Nice honey chicken recipe! My 8 year old ate it and she's picky about chicken. We ate this with soy sauce noodles. Edit: I've made this in the skillet too!

Big hit with my family.  I used a mixture of chicken breast and thighs for more flavor.  Cut the honey back to 1/3 c. Used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.   Added a dash of crushed red pepper for zip.  Sauteed carrots, celery, red bell pepper and mushrooms and stirred in when I returned the chicken to the sauce.  Also, I toasted the sesame seeds for 3-4 minutes to improve flavor and color.  My son liked it so well he asked for the recipe so he can make in his slow cooker at home.

I used chicken thighs for this recipe which was good, because they didn't come out dry. However, that's about all I can say good about this recipe.

It was in the Crockpot on low for four hours (because the chicken went in frozen), but after all that time the sugar in the honey had burned somewhat and made the sauce taste like sweet charcoal. Blech. (There is no way this stuff would survive on high heat.) It also was far too sweet, so I agree with those who cut back the honey by half. We put more soy sauce on at serving time, which helped it a bit, but unfortunately, there are a lot of leftovers that no one will be eating.

I also agree with the reviewer who said the sauce had no depth of flavor. Other than the burned taste, this tasted like watered-down honey and nothing else. 

Not a keeper.

This works great for a busy errand day.  My variations were slight. I put 3 chicken breasts in the crock pot on low.  The sauce was pretty close to the recipe-- reduced honey to 1/3 cup, used 2 cloves fresh minced garlic vs garlic powder. I thickened it up in a skilllet on the range top since it seemed like the crock pot was not going to thicken it.  Flavor  was mild but you can use chili sauce or sriracha to spice it up.

Great recipe. Maybe it is because I have an old crook pot, but after 10 minutes on High, the sauce was not thickening at all. I just threw it in a pan on the stove top on medium and high and it was thick in a about 7 minutes.

Only brown rice was left!  Cooked it longer than the recipe said, about one and a half to two hours, which made the sauce thick and some of the chicken a little dry, but I had to work.  Chicken soaked up flavor. Overall, a hit!

I read the reviews and agree that cooking a chicken breast in a slow cooker  is over kill so when I read the review from someone who used boneless, skinless chicken thighs I paid attention and followed their tweaks.  I tossed the cut up chicken in cornstarch and put  the 2t of additional corn starch into the honey mixture. I halved the honey, added diced onion, used fresh minced garlic and found no need to thicken.  My family loved it and it couldn't have been easier!

I followed the recipe to the letter...and ended up with a dish wreally did not like. The sauce tasted burnt and was too sweet. The chicken was dry and the smell of the dish was a real appetite-killer.

I'd like to give this 3.5 stars but since that's not possible...it's 3.  So...I made this with only a little less honey and everything else I did was as directed.  It was very sweet with even just 1/3 cup honey.  I like sweet stuff...but although this is "good" it definitely lacks something.  I'll make it again but I would definitely doctor it more.  Whoops, I did actually use fresh onion and garlic...but next time I might add orange rind and something else although I'm not yet sure what.  It needs more tanginess.  Ah, ginger.  : )

Doubled up the recipe, but did not double up on the honey so it wouldn't be too sweet. Tasted really good! The sauce did not thicken so I will have to adjust the recipe next time. Added canned pineapple (along with the juice) and steamed broccoli which added more flavor. Next time will add carrots.

This was the worst recipe I ever tried.  I followed it precisely, except for reducing the amount of honey, and served it over rice.  There's no way to put it nicely, so I'll simply say that it was awful.  The sauce does not have a pleasant flavor AT ALL.  I've never given such a low rating to a recipe, but this dish was inedible.

This has become our go-to when craving some Asian food. Super easy to throw together last minute and love being able to throw in the slow cooker and forget about it for a few hours. I would definitely suggest cooking on low 3-4 hours as when I cooked on high, the chicken became very dry and there wasn't as much flavour throughout.

We all really liked it. I did cut the honey in half,  coated the chicken with cornstarch, added some carrots, and broccoli (the last 30 mins).  Was pretty delish! Will definitely make it again!

I enjoyed this recipe; however, next time I'll likely cut back on the honey (it was slightly too sweet for my preference) and make the sauce a bit thicker.

This was delicious!  I didn't think to do the crockpot in the morning.  So I sliced and sautÃ©ed the chicken.  Then I added the sauce and simmered.  I removed the chicken, added the corn starch mixture and let the sauce thicken.  I put the chicken back in and added some chopped green onion.  So tasty!

The sauce had a peculiar flavor to it and never thickened even after I left it on high for 20 minutes! It was very sweet and lacked anything remotely resembling the sauce accompanying sesame chicken. The chicken came out very, very dry (I cooked it on low for 2.5 hours). There was sadly no saving this dish.

The only change I made was to used fresh minced onion, because I was out of dried.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  My chicken was probably done in about 2 hours on low (I must have a powerful crockpot), but I let it cook until it reached the three hour mark.  When I took it out, it admittedly did that half shredding thing that cooked chicken can do, but it was moist, and I was able to cut it into some semblance of "chunks".  It did not affect the taste at all.  Was gobbled up by teenagers and adults alike.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for a winning recipe!

I served this to friends and they raved about it!    We also added mushrooms and red pepper flakes to taste.  We took the advice of another reviewer and dredged the chicken in cornstarch before adding it to the crock pot and it turned out fine....no need to take chicken out and cook sauce on stove top.  We thought we would add red pepper strips and broccoli next time and double the sauce.

It was all right, but I think there are better honey sesame chicken recipes out there, this one was very sweet and not much else. The chicken really takes on the taste of whatever brand honey you put in there.

I thickened the sauce on the stovetop, because the slow-cooker wouldn't do it. The sauce didn't have any depth of flavor at all. The chicken itself was okay, but it was a little drier than I would have liked. The best part of the meal was the plain white rice that I cooked to go with it.

I took another reviewers advice and tossed the diced chicken in a plastic bag with the cornstarch.  The chicken cooked in 2 1/2 hours on low, but the sauce was still thin.  I removed the chicken to a bowl and put a few spoonfuls of the sauce  in a small bowl with an additional teaspoon of corn starch, mixed it around and poured it into the slow cooker.  While stirring I let this cook for a couple of minutes to thicken then put the chicken back in.  Very good.

Loved this recipe!! Only used 1/2 the amount of honey called for.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The sauce is so good I will double the amount next time! 
Will try it with pork chops next.

This was delicious!  No time to mess with the slow cooker, so I just cut the chicken into chunks and cooked it all on top the stove and it turned out great in about 30 minutes.  I cut the honey down by half like others suggested and made double the amount of sauce.  And I didn't remove the chicken, just added the cornstarch mixture into the whole batch.  I'm lazy.   Oh, and I sprinkled in a little ginger just because I like ginger, but it tasted really good without it too.   I was somewhat reluctant to try this because I couldn't picture ketchup in sesame chicken, but the flavors were wonderful.  It might be even better cooked slow.  Next time I'll try it.  Oh, and I used low sodium soy sauce.

Mine cooked on low for 4 hours and then the slow cooker switches to warm and it was very overcooked and dry. I really enjoyed the sauce though! Hubby only rated this a 2.

Very good. Whole family loved it and have asked for it to be made again soon. I made it on stovetop because didnât have time for slow cooker. Doubled sauce recipe and precut chicken to lessen cooking time. Added red peppers and onions. Will make again!

Very low maintenance, so very easy. I very much appreciated just spending ten minutes on the mixture and then just putting the chicken in the crockpot for 3 hours . It is always pleasant to eat a great meal after very little effort.

I made this for dinner tonight..soooo easy to put all the ingredients in the crockpot..put it on Low for 4 hrs but by 3 1/2 hrs I took out the chicken to see if it was tender and it was..the only thing different I would do is double the recipe for the sauce (to pour extra on chicken later)..served it over white rice with a side of steamed vegetables and baked spring rolls..definitely make this again!

This was quick and easy deliciousness! I added a couple garlic cloves and cornstarch to the sauce prior to cooking and the sauce was perfect. I also cut up the chicken breasts halfway through cooking and tossed them back in. Served over roasted onion and peppers and of course rice.

It isn't too hard to make, and it tastes pretty decent for how low effort it is (getting the consistency of the sauce right is definitely the  hardest part) but it definitely needs to be served with rice or the sauce is just way too much

Takes a lot to please my whole family. This one was a winner! I doubled the recipe and keep the chicken breasts whole. Other than that, it was awesome!

We enjoyed this with a few changes.  Similar to other reviewers, I did not want this to be too sweet.  So, I doubled the recipe but still only used 1/2 C honey.  I also only used 50% more soy sauce (so 1/4 C plus 2 TBSP) and ketchup (3 TBSP).  I used about 1/2 sweet onion chopped, two cloves of garlic chopped and some fresh ginger instead of the recommended powdered garlic and dried onion.  Next time I want to try sesame oil instead of vegetable as I think that will add to the flavor.  Both of my teens ate this happily so that is a win!

Very easy to make and a very tasty sauce! I coated the chicken with cornstarch so I didnât have to thicken it at the end, but I found the sauce rendered too quickly, so I added a little extra lite soy and a little garlic hoisin sauce to it, and it was fine. The recipe doesnât say when to add the sesame seeds, so I added toasted sesame seeds about half an hour before serving. The chicken wasnât as tender as Iâd hoped it would be, but that may have been the fault of the sale chicken I bought at a discount grocery store.

I halved the honey because others said it was too sweet. Wish I hadn't, maybe there would have been some flavor then. It was very bland and I will not make again.

My family loved it with rice!  Next time Iâd add some orange zest to make the flavor stronger. Only gave it 4 stars as the sauce didnât thicken up as much as Iâd expected. Will make it again!

I made the recipe as presented only substituting onion powder in place of the minced onions. (Oddly enough, I did not have an onion in the house!)
Served it over basmati rice with broccoli on the side.
My husband said he liked it, but he didnât go back for seconds as per usual. We decided that it was a good base from which to build. And, so fast and easy to prepare!
 I will make it again, but I think some pineapple and green pepper would improve the taste. I would probably put the pepper in about 1/2 to 3/4 way through the cooking time.
It would also be good with some crispy fried chicken and a bit more honey.

I'd give it about 4.5 after changes. It's just my husband and me, so used one large chicken breast instead of 1 1/2 lbs of chicken and yet there wasn't that much sauce. It might be a good idea to double the ingredients for the sauce. I also used fresh crushed garlic instead of garlic powder.  Tasting it at the end, it still needed something so added crushed  pineapple and a little of the juice. Lastly,  toast the sesame seeds.  Toasted sesame seeds are so much tastier.  With these alterations, it was pretty good.

Not a repeater at our house.  Texture, technique, ease of preparation make a five star.  But the taste of ketchup turned us off.  I would like to find a recipe without ketchup in the ingredients.

Well I tried it for the first time. I could taste the ketchup and that was about it, there wasn't any complexity to this dish or any flavoring. I think the basic concept is good but it needs a major overhaul for the seasoning and spices.

This was  pretty good. Kids liked it more than the adults. I made some changes to suit my taste. I used fresh onion and garlic. Only about  1/2 the honey and some sesame oil toward the end of cooking. The sauce didn't thicken in time stated in the recipe. I had to leave it in an extra 30 minutes with the lid of the slow cooker ajar.

Turned out great!  I added some crushed red peeper for spice. I read some reviews about sauce not thickening but mine thickened out fine and my slow cooker is very old like 15 years plus. Nice easy recipe with ingredients I already had at home. I also used frozen chicken, just tossed it right in frozen and it didnât turn out dry at all.

I made this to recipe the first time (only added a bit of minced ginger and crushed garlic instead of dry).  But the second time it cried out for more to me. I wanted it to go further too. So sautÃ©ed half pound of sliced mushrooms with a teaspoon of crushed garlic and since I a bunch of green onions I chopped these and threw them into the frying pan. Then I threw this over the chicken breasts which I had sliced into large bite size strips and turned the slow cooker on low. Added a cup of unsalted cashews towards the end (when I started the rice) along with a cup of fresh chopped pineapple I had on hand. These items just seemed like logical additions and provided some variety to the texture without really altering the basic background flavours.

If prepared as directed, this would have been a 3.  Adding ingredients as I did, it was a 5.  There is nothing âsesameâ about this recipe as given.  Putting sesame seeds on top does not make âsesame chicken.â  Fortunately, I had another recipe for sesame chicken from Allrecipes that includes 2 tablespoons of sesame oil and one teaspoon of chili paste.  I added these to the sauce after removing the chicken and everyone said it was delicious.  We were in a hurry to get dinner on the table, so like some others, transferred the sauce to the stovetop for thickening.

Very tasty. Good easy slow cooker recipe. However the sauce did not thicken in the slow cooker. Left it for about 20 minutes and it was still watery. Threw it in a skillet to thicken it up.

Because Iâm cooking only for myself I cut the number of portions in half. Taking the advice of another reviewer, I cut the chicken into pieces first and covered them in corn starch. When I added the chicken to my crockpot it barely covered the bottom of the pot so I decided to stir fry instead. I added green and yellow bell pepper, green onions and some red pepper flakes for some kick. I also reduced the amount of honey.  By stir frying It took only 30 minutes instead of hours .

I really wanted to like this recipe, but it was pretty salty and very sweet at the same time.  There was a weird taste to it.  Perhaps the chicken needed to be marinated first for more flavor.

Flavor was ok but I couldn't get the sauce to thicken, even with the cornstarch. I was most likely doing something wrong since I'm a beginner.

The flavors in this recipe were excellent. Would make again. My chicken shredded on me a bit after slow cooking. Probably should have used a sharper knife.

This meal was delicious! I served it over white rice, and everyone in my family loved it. I had a little trouble getting the sauce to thicken with these instructions, so I put the sauce in a pot and gradually added more corn starch as it boiled until it reached the thickness I wanted. I poured it over the chicken again, stirred, and then served. Instead of adding sesame seeds into the slow cooker, I chose to apply it to the chicken after it was on the plate. These adjustments worked perfectly for me. This is a repeat recipe!

This was delicious! I have no tweaks for it. I didn't put it over rice, but I might do it over leftover rice.  I wouldn't change a thing.

I really hate it when a review starts out with all the things a person changed, but I realized I did change a few things.  And will change a couple more when I make it again.  It is definitely a keeper!  I always have to make meals in twos because of a son who needs keto for health.  This was easy to make keto by the way!  To improvise for keto, I used chicken thighs, sugar free ketchup, coconut aminos, broth in place of water, and birch xyla, then thickened with xanthan gum.  Of course, he ate it without the rice.  It was really superb!  For the keto recipe, I give it 5 stars!  For the rest of us, I should cut down on the honey, as others have mentioned.  I will use green onion next time, add a little salt, and freshly grated ginger as well as crushed garlic.  I did use thighs and cut them up.  The meal was actually ready in 3 hours.  I like the idea someone mentioned about rolling the chicken in cornstarch first - that would save time in the end.  Very enjoyable!

I modified mine for fun. I switch soy sauce to teriyaki and I got rid of the sesame seeds. Not only did my husband and I love it but I got the seal of approval from my toddler!

It tasted alright, but a little too sweet for my preferences. I might change the ratio of honey to soy sauce and ketchup next time.

I probably would also pre-cut the chicken before cooking it, rather than waiting until the end. By the time cooking was done the chicken was so tender it just shredded, so it was more the appearance of pulled pork than conventional sesame chicken. I also found the liquid had reduced enough during the cooking process that the addition of water and corn starch turned the sauce into a paste, so I'd probably list that step as optional for anyone trying to make this.

I really liked it, it was simple to make and savory. Personally, I'd like it to be just a bit more tangy, maybe I'll add orange zest next time I make it.

Chicken was moist - too much soy sauce. If I were to make this again, I would cut the ss in half and add a bit more crushed red pepper flakes.

This was Yummy!!! Not too much honey at all.  I added a few dashes of red pepper flakes plus 2 tblspns each of onion and garlic powder.  I mixed the sauce and let sit for an hour before putting on top of chicken in bottom of crock pot.   Had rice and broccoli but didn't cut chicken as I used thighs and didn't thicken sauce. Will make again!!

I made the version that was printed in AllRecipes magazine, which had some differences from the way it appears here. Wouldn't say we loved it but it was a good dinner. For our family's tastes, I used less soy sauce, and will probably use more garlic next time.

My favorite part of this recipe was how simple it was. I followed the directions, but the chicken just fell apart into a shred instead of keeping together. The sauce was ok, but the chicken still seemed dry. Nothing like the crispy fried version, Iâll stick to that next time. Served over fried rice to dress it up bit.

This was very good and I didn't have high expectations. I only had 2 hours took cook my 3 large bone in chicken pieces.  So i put it on high.  I also didn't have dried onion so I used an envelope of dried french onion soup mix and just sifted much of the seasoning out. But I think the extra flavor added a lot. I also used much more ketchup than it called for. I didn't mix it up before hand. I just threw it all in the crock pot. The kids were happy so I was too. I will make this again but hopefully with more time.

i decided against the crock pot for time reasons and halved the recipe. i added waaay more garlic (almost a 1/4 cup total minced) a tiny bit of sticky teriyaki, and a teaspoon of sriracha and cooked and sauce in a pan to thicken while i seared the chicken pieces separately in a cast iron pan. served with rice and steamed broccoli took about 25 minutes total super fast and yummy will try in the crock pot when i have more time

The chicken was moist and flavorful.  I will be making this for company in the future.

Very delicious and simple.  I didn't see why this needed to be made in a slow cooker, so I made it on the stove top and had dinner ready in less than half an hour.

I found this receipt in the magazine. It used cut up chicken which you put in the pot with the sauce and cook at low for 2-3 hours. I am wondering what everyone who ismentioning "brown sugar" is talking about-it was not in the magazine recipe and I do not see it in the recipe on line. Anyway, this went together pretty easily. We do not like red pepper so I used a little ginger instead to contact the sweetness of the honey. I also put only a little chopped onion in the mix and instead used larger slices of onion as well as green and red bell peppers and carrots to add for color and flavor. I added the vegetables during the last hour of coooking so they would not get mushy. I cut everything in half as there are only 2 of us and it made a nice amount for dinner served over rice. Overall, it was a fairly good and certainly quick and easy recipe. I may tinker a bit with the flavorings in the sauce, but I will definitely make it again.

Very easy and delicious!  I added sliced celery on top right before serving.  I think it needed that extra crunch and I was out of green onions.  Next time I will add sliced carrots and water chestnuts towards the end of cooking time.

Took 2 1/2 hours in my crockpot on high. I used chopped onion instead of dried onion. I added fresh mushrooms 30 minutes prior and steamed broccoli once finished. I followed another reviewer by adding corn starch in the beginning, sauce didn't thicken but it was fine for us. Easy to put together and everyone liked so would make again.

We love the recipe for Sweet, Sticky and Spicy chicken on this site. I knew this wouldn't be the same because it's made in a slow cooker but I was able to combine the two to make it more flavorful. It is a breeze to make in the crock pot and I loved that! Changes made were small but I believe important: used chicken thighs - they hold up much better in crockpot and should solve the problem most have with dry or "gritty" chicken; doubled everything including chicken but not the honey per another user - plenty of sauce; added minced ginger and srircha sauce for more flavor; lowered my expectations on a thick, sauce - c'mon folks, simple truth is unless you add more corn starch nothing thickens in a crockpot! That being said sauce was not watery; I made the magazine version that mixes all the sauce ingredients including cornstarch and adds straight to crockpot. Really good for a busy weeknight - put on when the kids come home from school and it's ready by dinner. Or better yet, prep the chicken and sauce mixture in the AM, put in fridge and have kids dump into the crock when they get home! Thanks for this recipe! I'm going to try with pineapple next time.

I added snow peas, red bell pepper and some mushrooms. I also added some sesame seeds to the sauce, because the only sesame seeds were sprinkled over at the end. The amount of sauce was crazy good! Served with/over brown rice. Yum!

I was very disappointed by this recipe. I followed the recipe EXACTLY and all it tasted like was gritty chicken.
The cornstarch seemed like it didn't incorporate into the sauce. 
I will never make this again :(

I got this recipe from your magazine, to which my sister subscribes, & followed it exactly. However, I can't, for the life of me, understand how this could be edible to anyone! The chicken was rubbery & tasted wooden (I used beautiful, fresh breasts) & the sauce was awful & bitter. We ended up throwing it away & going out for Thai food! The magazine recipe had you add the cornstsarch right at the beginning & the cook was 2 1/2 to 3 hours on High. I've made many successful dishes in our crockpot, mostly beef & pork, so we're very puzzled & disappointed! This was beyond HORRIBLE!!

This is just so so. Pretty bland. I don't think adding peppers or onions would do the trick. The sauce wasn't good. Sorry!

I'm a new subscriber to All Recipes magazine and this was the first recipe I made. Poor choice: this is way, way, WAY too sweet. I should have realized that 1/2 cup of honey would be overpowering for only 1.5 lbs of chicken. And I even added a big dollop of dijon mustard to tone down the sweetness! As others have said, the sauce is sweet and...that's about it. The flavor profile is not at all complex. And the chicken came out dry. If I  make this again, I'll start from scratch.  HUGE disappointment. Hope the other recipes in the magazine are good, or I'll be cancelling my two-year subscription and stick with CI.

I had high expectations for this recipe, but was disappointed with it.  It was way too sweet for us, and the sauce did not thicken in the crockpot (but thickened quickly on the stove afterwards).  I did not use the red pepper, which may have helped cut the sweetness a bit, but I did use a little hot sauce instead and it was still very sweet.  I think with some of the modifications that others suggested (less honey) it would have been better.  I also added a small amount of fresh ginger because I had it on hand - I wish I would have used more because that flavor helped to give it a taste other than honey. 
 Recently I did a Blue Apron meal that was Sesame Chicken -
 it used hoisin sauce and red chili paste and the dish was fabulous - tasted way better than my skills typically allow!  I think some combination of these ingredients would probably be nice.  Those of you who are great cooks (seems like most of you are!) can likely find the right amounts.  I will experiment with this next time.  Lastly, I added veggies as others suggested - broccoli, bell pepper - but the broccoli did not cook enough even though I cooked it on low for over 3 hours and then high for 30 minutes.   Next time I might steam broccoli a little first, or cook it and add it at the end.  Hope my comments help some of you - potentially this could be a really good quick dinner.  I rely heavily on the wisdom of Allrecipes readers!

Talk about easy and ever-so-yummy. My extremely picky hubby finally gave up after two BIG servings and announced
 "This is definitely a keeper!" Need I say more?

My boyfriend (who does most of the cooking) picked this recipe out of your magazine. Since today was a chilly rainy day and I had the ingredients I decided to make it. Used fresh onions and garlic and added 1/2 a can of pineapple chunks and fresh green and red bell peppers.  I was afraid the sauce would be either too sweet for me, or not enough for him, but surprisingly, we both really liked it! Added a touch more crushed red pepper, which gave it a nice kick!  Keeping this one!

This was surprisingly good. I have never made chicken in a slow cooker that I thought was a good consistency until tonight. I made exactly as recipe stated but at the end added 1/2 t red pepper flakes (it needed more than that) and about 3 c of par boiled fresh broccoli & cauliflower (probably could have just used frozen). In the end, my sauce never thickened but I served it over brown rice so it was okay. I will make again & will add more redpepoer flakes as well as work toward a thicker sauce.

Quick and easy meal - great for weeknights! Used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil ..... didn't have sesame seeds. Didn't find it too sweet like other reviewers. Kids loved it - asked for seconds!  Will definitely make this dish again!

I coated chicken thighs with tapioca starch (didn't have corn starch), cooked it for ~3 hours on low, shredded the chicken to let the sauce soak in, and then mixed it with steamed broccoli and red pepper. The sauce thickened perfectly. Served over white rice and scallions. I used 1/4 cup of honey instead of the 1/2 cup called for in the recipe and I didn't miss it.

I have made this twice and it was delicious but the chicken was a bit dry.

Did I leave it in too long? (4 hours on low in the slow cooker)

Would cutting the chicken into smaller pieces before you start cooking help?

Thank you!!

I am making this with rice for Friday night dinner!

We love this one. It's a staple to my freezer meal prep day!
I make make it in baggies, freeze, thaw, and then pressure cook.  I precut the meat in squares. and add the corn starch at the end. I do catch myself forgetting the sesame seeds though :(

Made this following recipe and some suggestions from previous posts.  Dredged chicken in cornstarch and flour, so no need to thicken at end.  Added all my veg - broccoli, pepper, onion, celery.  Yummy.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a keeper recipe in our house. My husband and I were craving for sesame chicken, so I decided to try this one, with no changes, the only  one was the addition of the starch to the chicken at the beginning and it was just perfect. Thank you for this awesome version!

Simple to make and tasty.  It was a little sweet so I added some garlic chili paste to it to kick it up a little.  It needs a bit more of that or less sugar.  Definitely easy prep and good flavor overall!

The sauce didn't thicken like I thought it would, but overall a great recipe.  Very simple, easy cleanup and family loved it.  This will be in the weekend lineup again

I made no changes.  It was very good!  Didn't TOTALLY knock my socks off, so I didn't give it 5 stars, but would definitely make again.

I pretty much made as written except doubled everything  I added sriracha, tbsp of red wine vinegar, and about 3 tbsp of Thai peanut sauce.  I was hoping the peanut sauce would be like sesame oil flavoring and it was close enough. Oh yeah I was extra lazy and used onion powder instead.

It was good but I think it would be better with sesame oil added and replacing some of the honey with brown sugar.  Next time I want to try doing that.

I made this according to the directions except I cut up the chicken first and perhaps that is why it tasted dry.  I would try it again with boneless chicken thighs (not cut up) and see if that helps.

This is the FIRST Sesame Chicken recipe I've tried that my entire family would eat. I tend to try a lot of recipes and fail a lot of recipes, but this one passed with flying colors!

I did double the sauce to be sure to cover the chicken and keep it moist while it was in the slow cooker. 

The only downfall is having to separate the chicken and sauce and add Corn Starch and then re-mix everything.

Made this tonight for supper. It was delicious. Made as per recipe but added corn starch at the beginning and it thickened beautifully.  Would make again and maybe add shredded carrot.

simple, easy to make, kids loved the recipe...but I would rather have something else than ketchup in the recipe...could you make recommendations for substitutions...I added fresh onion...squeezed it through a garlic press...instead of  onion powder and I used a few cloves of garlic...instead of garlic powder...ohh..I also had to remove the sauce from the crock pot and cook in a pot on the stove to thicken the sauce...I have a very small crock pot...

Sadly, it lacked flavor. To me, it was just a sweet sauce with chicken. Maybe I'll marinate and fry the chicken beforehand to make the dish more flavorful and also add red pepper flakes. Well, at least my husband liked it!  He asked me to make it again!

This was really good and easy to make.  The only change I made was I to coat chicken in the cornstarch then pour sauce on top as suggested by reviewer.  Otherwise, followed the recipe as written.  Family loved it.

My husband said this recipe is a definite keeper.  I only made three changes - used chicken thighs because we prefer dark meat, minced garlic instead of garlic powder and rolled the thighs in cornstarch before cooking instead of making the cornstarch slurry at the end as one reviewer suggested.  Wonderful substitution for deep fried version.

I enjoyed it, but my fiance did not.  It was too sweet for him.  We did use raw honey.  It needs some kind of spice added to it and the sweetness needs to be toned down.  Other than that, it was a quick & easy dish to make.

Very good recipe but next time I would omit the honey and replace with chunks of pineapple, also cut cooking time to
1.5 hours on low and ck temp of chicken.  Serve over plain rice/cauliflower rice unseasoned.  Also would add frozen veggies last 1/2 hour.

Great recipe. Simple and to the point. I slow cooked mine in high for 2.5 hours, removed chicken as instructed and added it back. At first I didn't want to do this as others skipped this step but it helped me make sure the chicken was fully cooked by cutting it and seeing it's not pink.

I really wanted a dish that I could serve up immediately when I got home, so I slightly modified this recipe. I diced the chicken up and coated it in the cornstarch. I also threw in some diced onion, carrot, and shredded Brussels sprouts. I felt like the sauce was a bit on the sweet side, so I added more soy sauce before dishing out and it was perfect. Quick, easy, and delish. Keeper.

The chicken cooks a lot faster since it is cut up. I checked it at 2 hours and was done close to overdone. I didn't have sesame seeds on hand I substituted sesame oil for the canola oil. All in all the whole family enjoyed it. We doubled the sauce and served over pasta.

Delicious! Like other reviewers, I coated the chicken in the cornstarch before I put it in the slow cooker and added srihacha and crushed red pepper for more heat to balance the sweetness. The family loved it!

My kids love sesame chicken and this was a healthier version than the fried chicken they get from our local Chinese takeout.  It was good, not great, the kids didn't love it, but they ate it. I served it over white rice.  Hubby said the leftovers were better than the first time we had it.

I made this, with a few changes - cut honey in half, added pineapple tidbits and a tbsp of hot sauce to the sauce, then added sauteed mushrooms, red pepper and broccoli 10 minutes before serving.  I should have added pineapple tidbits later, with the sauteed veggies to keep their firmness.  Served on Jasmine rice and the four of us ate it all!!  YUM!

It was super yummy and I'll be making it again! The sauce wasn't as thick as I thought it would be. Goes great with rice! Adding veggies sounds nummy too!

Absolutely delicious, will make again and again! I used extra Virgin olive oil instead of vegetable and I did not have the sesame , but look forward to adding that the next time....try it, you'll love it! 4 hours on low, 2 lbs boneless/skinless chicken breasts.

Easy to put together, smells great while cooking. Add some broccoli,  serve on rice and voila! Flavor was good, but a tad sweet. Next time I'll add more salt, perhaps just a dash of Chinese five spice. The sauce took a lot longer to thicken than ten minutes, but maybe that's just my slow cooker.

Really yummy! I substituted the oil for sesame oil and it came out amazing. The chicken was soft and juicy and the sauce nice and sweet. I did add some red pepper flakes and doubled the cornstarch because my sauce was not thickening. Making again for sure!

I made this for my husbands birthday dinner, and we both ate a nice-sized bowl of it, but  threw the rest out. it was good enough to eat until we were full, but not anything real special. I described it to him as a mock sesame chicken, and we both agree that a more authentic-tasting sesame chicken would be better. but it was good for what it was. we're just spoiled, I guess. :-) not a keeper, sorry.

My husband really liked this, but it didn't quite do it for me. I cut the chicken into bite size pieces for cooking and coated in the corn starch before adding to the slow cooker. That worked out well and it paired nicely with rice and some broccoli thrown in at the end. I think if I make it again, I will add a small amount of ginger (one of our family's favorite spices) and reduce the onion (personal preference).

I would rate it more than 5 stars if I could!  This was absolutely delicious, yes, a little on the sweet side, but if you've ever eaten Sesame Chicken at an Asian restaurant, you know that's the way it's supposed to be.  I followed the recipe as written except at the end I added an extra teaspoon of cornstarch as the sauce didn't thicken enough.  This meal was totally devoured by everyone, not a morsel left!  I served it with rice and steamed broccoli.  Can't wait to make this again!

I made this exactly as written except for the amount of honey; I didn't have quite enough and I am so glad I didn't.  It was more than sweet enough. Like most people, the sauce did not want to thicken in the crockpot and I ended up doing it in a saucepan and then mixing chicken in.  Turned out to be more of a sweetened shredded chicken.  I don't think this will be making the list of favorites.

Tasted great although I had trouble getting the sauce to thicken. Certainly didn't look like it did in the picture... turned out more watery. Next time I'll probably take the sauce out and get it really heated up on the stove top instead of trying to do it in the crock pot.

The chicken was nice and tender but the sauce had an 'odd' flavor.  It almost tasted like there was alcohol in it!  I tried adding some brown sugar to the sauce and it did help improve the taste but it still didn't taste 'right' to me.  My husband loved it but I don't think I'll make it again.

I liked this recipe, but it does lack a little flavor and it never got as thick as I normally like the sauce to be. Low for 3-3 1/2 hrs and the chicken was juicy.

Easy "starter" recipe that has endless possible additions! First night added basic peas n carrots, next night - made it into a stir fry! I mixed chicken breasts with boneless/skinless chicken thighs to add different textures.

I had to be out the door in half and hour, so I was looking for something quick to throw in the crock pot. This was so easy, and everything was on hand! I read that it had a tendency to get dry, and since I had to leave it for six hours I added a quarter cup of unsweetened cranberry juice. I also cut the honey down by a third and added a couple of tablespoons of Sriracha hot chili sauce. It was great! I will make it again.

This was easy to make and very tasty!  It compared with a conventional recipe I used to make.  The conventional recipe took  a lot more time and attention to make. I substituted fresh onion for the dried onion.  That worked out fine.  I was slightly disappointed with the thickness of the sauce but I will adjust corn starch and cook time on high the next time I make this one.  I served this with steamed broccoli.

I've made this several times and it has become one of my go- to dishes. I didn't have any sesame seeds the first time I made it so I didn't use them. I still make it without the seeds but I think it would be good.  I tried coating the chicken in cornstarch as another reviewer suggested but the sauce turned out lumpy.  I just wisk the cornstarch into the sauce as I'm making it.

This is pretty good and very easy to make..  However next time I make it I will add fresh chopped onion, fresh garlic and crushed red pepper flakes.  It needs some.inhancement in the flavor department.  Good served with fried rice.

I wasn't crazy about it but my family seemed to like it. Didn't find the sauce interesting. Definitely cut the chicken up beforehand. If you wait until after it it falls apart into mush.

Fantastic! I used bone-in thighs with skin on and only 1/3 cup of honey along with dried chopped onion. Served it over rice with a side of broccoli, cauliflower and carrot medley. Didn't need to thicken the sauce. It was great just the way it is! My son and his friend absolutely loved it! Will definitely make this again. And it was sooooo easy! The house smelled fantastic when I walked in from work. All I had to do was make the rice in the rice cooker and throw a bag of Steamfresh veggies in the microwave when I got home and done!

This was delicious and so easy! I wish it didn't have as much "sweet" in it, but still quite tasty. I didn't have enough honey on hand so I did some honey and some agave (I assume any natural sweetener would do).

This was perfect on the stovetop. I have a crockpot and love it but had no time before work to throw this in the slow cooker before leaving. That being said, I cut up the chicken, made the sauce, and combined the two. I then just heated a few tablespoons of vegetable oil in a pan on the stovetop and pan fried the chicken and the sauce until it was all done. This was exceptional for being such a simple recipe. The only complaint I got was they was not enough! Perfect for busy week days to just throw together. Definitely a keeper!

I read all the reviews and did a few changes and we love this recipe.  I did add 1/8 t. ginger, 1/4. t. red pepper flakes (makes it spicy), 1/8 c. brown sugar, and only used 1/4 c. honey instead of 1/2 c.  I also added half a chopped red pepper and can of drained pineapple tidbits.  I coated the chicken w/cornstarch as one reviewer suggested and did not need to remove chicken to thicken the sauce.  I then served over wild rice.  Killer dinner!

I used the suggestion by a previous person and coated the chicken in corn starch before I added it to the crockpot. I followed the rest if the recipe except I added a couple dashes of San-J Szechuan sauce because I always remembered sesame chicken as being spicy. It was really good for my first effort. Sauce was thick and my husband really liked it. Might try baking it next time though. :)

We did not like it. I will not make it again.
I had no problems with consistency. The taste we were looking for just was not there.
We will stick to carry out for our sesame chicken.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it was delicious. I served it over white rice and there was nothing left. Next time I'm doubling the recipe because we didn't want to stop eating this.

It wasn't terrible but it wasn't for us. I feel like the sauce was missing something. Then again, I think there's something to be said for making the sauce on the stove n not trying to add cornstarch to pot or chicken. Noticed when sauce cooled n thickened due to air is when the flavor was really trying to come out. Aside from adding extra veggies initially I would make this exactly as posted then play with it. Thanks again ladies, I never say any recipe is bad, it just didn't work for us. Although I might try that sauce again on the stove.....

Chicken was very dry and sauce did not have a lot of flavor.  It wasn't bad, but not good enough to make again.

I made this exactly as the recipe states except for adding a tiny bit of crushed red pepper as we like our food with a bit of kick. We liked it but felt that it was a bit too sweet. Next time I am going to scale back the honey by a third. I tripled the recipe for our family of six, so I think the suggested number of servings might be a bit optimistic.

This was absolutely delicious. It was the perfect combination of sweet and salty. I had the chicken in the slow cooker for almost 6 hours and the chicken was falling apart into the sauce.

2/16 The only change I made was to add 1 tea. of sesame oil (more would be good) and to cut the meat into bite size pieces to start. If you do this, cut the cooking time down a lot! I didn't and had to deal w/over cooked chicken (Yuk! not a big fan of chicken to start!).  Much too sweet. Served w/noodles & broccoli. Not bad (except over cooked chicken)

I doubled the amount of chicken therefore doubled the sauce ingredients. It was more than enough sauce. The chicken shrinks a lot even when cooked on low, so be generous with the amount of chicken you use.
This recipe was super tasty and I'll definitely be making it again!

I wish I could give this 3.5 stars, because it really is good, and it's easy to make.  I like no-fuss recipes that don't require a lot of ingredients.  Plus there was some user error in here - my chicken ended up a little overcooked, which is of course my fault rather than the recipe's.  However, the sauce never thickened for me, even when I added extra corn starch.  In my mind, if you're using a crock-pot recipe, you shouldn't have to finish it on the stove, which is why I gave this 3 instead of 4 stars.  But still - easy and good!  Definitely recommend.

I made this and followed some recommendations of others on here. Dredged the chicken, reduced honey, added red pepper flakes, used minced garlic and fresh diced onion. I also added red and green peppers, and broccoli, however this is not a keeper for me this time.

I made this chicken last night.  My husband gets very nervous when I try new recipes but OMG!  This one is a keeper!  We like food with a little heat so I only used 1/4 cup of honey plus one tablespoon and I added 1 t of crushed red peppers.   Served over rice.  It. Was. Amazing!

Loved the taste of this. Took someone else's suggestion and added some red pepper flakes for a sweet and spicy taste and it added a wonderful contrast to the sweetness. I cooked this in under 2 hours in the crockpot by using skinless tenderloins and cutting them into bite sized chunks.

This was...not good. I don't know if it's the honey, but it just seemed burned, and I kept the heat on Low for 3-4 hours. No depth of flavor and very salty, even with low sodium soy sauce. Better off using a store bought teriyaki sauce. :(

I added a touch of sesame oil to the mix.  If I do it again, I would use a little less honey.  
While this turned out to be quite tasty, I think it would be equally good simply as a stir fry, perhaps simmering the sauce for twenty or thirty minutes. 
A good side is sliced zucchini, sauted in garlic, olive oil, and a quarter cup of water.

I followed the directions that came with my slow cooker regarding the cookling times, otherwise followed the recipe as written. The chicken was way overcooked. When I took the chicken out of the sauce to the cutting board, it fell apart and was impossible to cut in nice bite sized pieces as is shown in the picture accompanying the recipe. Instead it was shredded and very tough.  I think maybe slow cooking is not for chicken given the results I got with this recipe. Chicken cannot be overcooked in my experience like say beef or pork can.

I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I was out of sesame seeds, so added a teaspoon of sesame oil to the regular oil to give it the sesame taste. I chose to thicken the sauce on the stove stop instead of the crockpot. Yummy and easy.

I used 2 tsp of honey( instead 1/4 cup )added 1 tsp of minced fresh ginger, and used pieces of chicken thighs instead of Chicken breast, as it lacks taste.  Careful on added salt as the soy sauce is sufficient.  It was delicious with Jasmine Rice !!

This is a great recipe but does need a little tweaking. I agree with others that the amount of honey is way too much. I followed someone else's suggestion to cut the honey in half. Towards the end of cooking and after cooker was turned off, I briefly sauteed about 1/4 cup of chopped green bell pepper and stirred it into the mix for added color. It certainly will be on our table again. I also followed another's suggestion to add a few red pepper flakes and a squirt of sriracha for just a little heat, but I probably got a bit heavy-handed and would add only one or the other another time.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  It came out better than I expected.  It was super easy to put together.  The chicken was juicy and tender.  The sauce was plentiful and had a fantastic flavor.  The  flavor of the sauce exceeded my expectations.  It was a hit even for my picky six year old.  I wil defiantly be making this again!

This recipe was easy and delicious. I followed the advice of another reviewer and coated the chicken in cornstarch before putting it in the crock pot, it eliminated having to thicken it afterwards.  I also used coconut aminos,  instead of soy,  because my son is allergic to soy.

I made this exactly as written ingredient wise, however, due to time constraints  I transferred out of my slow cooker into a wok. I cubed the chicken before adding to wok and poured the sauce from the crock pot over it.  I have to say, it was delicious! I also had some steamed broccoli and water chestnuts and after the chicken was done,  I added them to the remaining sauce in the wok and let them absorb the juices.   My husband and 9 year old raved about it.  We had no leftovers! Thanks for an easy yet tasty sesame chicken!

Great, easy meal. I added red pepper flakes at the beginning and chopped green onion at the end. I also used fresh crushed garlic instead of garlic powder. My family raved about it so this will be a regular at our house! Easy to throw together.

Have made twice, definitely cut the honey. Made a huge difference, not so sweet.  I saute'd my chicken, onions in sesame oil, added nice flavor to chicken. Not a fan of the seeds.
The cornstarch roux,  just turned my Ninja to stove top and it thickened right up, didn't affect the chicken at all, it was tender, not dry at all. I also added broccoli, ate over Jasmine rice. Will make again.

I use lower sodium soy sauce. I also use brown sugar instead of honey. For more flavor, I add a chicken bouillon or tsp of granules. I also increase the garlic powder to 1 tsp or use 1 tbls minced garlic.

First time making, breast meat a bit dry.  Next time used skinless boneless thighs..yum.  they stand up to crock pot cooking so much better.  I like to add fresh veg..peppers,onions,broccoli, garlic and celery.  Makes a complete meal with rice. Good base recipe thanks poster.

Focused on the ingredient list where there was no mention of rice .  Completely missing the word rice until the cooking was done.  No minute rice on hand.  I believe the honey masked the garlic/onion.   Needed enough liquid to submerge the chicken or maybe my slow cooker or the breasts were too big.  Lacked zip.

My picky son ate every bite of this so this is definitely a keeper ! I actually cooked it on high for 2 1/2 hours to speed up the process and  it worked out great. I think my old crock pot may not get as hot as others as  I just couldn't get the sauce to thicken the final 10 minutes. I simply just threw it on the stove top and the consistency improved. Great , easy recipe w/ simple ingredients.

I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't have the onions. I don't know if that would have made much difference. This was quite bland and unremarkable. I won't be making it again.

I'll also use half the honey next time.  

I added some flour to thicken up the sauce at the end as well.
