Cilantro is a love-it or hate-it herb.  I happen to HATE it.  I left it out, and used siracha in place of the sambal. After they were softened, I used my kitchen shears to cut the noodles uop into smaller legnths. To up the veggies, I used half again as many carrots and about 1 cup of steamed edamame. Doubled the dressing and put it all in a "tupperware" bowl.  Stuck it in the fridge and before I went to bed, I turned the bowl upside down to let the dressing run back through the noodles. I got n ice saturation of flavor that way and it was perfect to put in a smaller bowl to take for lunch the next day.  I also had if for dinner the same evening with leftover ribeye thinly sliced on top.  Nice make-ahead light supper for us.  Will do again.

I thought it was great! I did not have fish sauce so I added soy sauce. I didn't have fresh herbs so i added dried herbs and I decided not to add sesame oil because I want it to be healthier!   Still came out great!

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe.  The dressing is lacking something, maybe more brown sugar,lime and ginger and a little oil?  Also, the dressing just runs to the bottom of the bowl, the noodles didn't soak up the dressing even after having sat in the refrigerator overnight. (Another reviewer suggested some peanut butter in the dressing which is an excellent idea.)  It is a difficult salad to plate and eat with the noodles being so long - I would break up the noodles a little before soaking them.  I did serve this with grilled chicken but I used the recipe for Shoyu Chicken for the marinade for the chicken.

Wowee, was I popular at the barbecue on Sunday! I made this great salad - it's sooooo easy and delicious! I made as is but for one thing: I substituted diced green peppers for the green onions as my Boo hates onions, but I put them on the side with some extra crushed peanuts so that people could add garnish to their own salads. This one is definitely a keeper. (BTW, Trader Joe's has pre-shredded carrots which makes it even EASIER!).

I have loved this salad for years - thanks for the recipe.  I find that tossing the noodles in the dressing them laying them out on a cookie sheet topped with the veggies makes mixing everything together well much easier.  I also add a splash of toasted sesame oil to the soaking water - the noodles then don't stick together and drain off the water better.

I LOVED this salad! So refreshing on a hot summer day. The carrots give a nice crunch and some added texture. I love Asian food but I've never used fish sauce before and I was a bit apprehensive. However all of the flavors work together perfectly. Don't be afraid! I think this salad is going to be in heavy rotation this summer at my house. I will say, the rice noodles took forever to soften just sitting in hot water so I ended up boiling them and then hitting them with cold water and it was fine.

Even my picky husband liked this, and I thought for sure he would not.  I used Thai Sweet Chili sauce and since it was so sweet (and spicy) I left out the brown sugar, which was a good call. I added matchstick cut cucumber, and left out the mint. Hubby can't eat cilantro so I served it on the side along with extra crushed peanuts (don't skip the peanuts!!), the more the better.  I grilled shrimp to top the salad which was a great variation. YUM!

The grilled thighs with the marinade was the star of this dish.  I actually thought I would love the noodles and my husband would tolerate them but my husband ate seconds and I liked it well enough.  I did like the texture and the idea of it all but I didn't "love it".  I do think my husband will ask for it in the future and I will definitely save the marinade recipe for the chicken because that was awesome.

The only reason I gave this recipe even 2 stars is due to the sauce, which I tweaked a little even.  Added some lemongrass, more sesame oil, and ginger.  However, the noodles did not soften in the hot water, which is what I was leary about in the first place. I think rice noodles need to be in boiling water for a minute to soften correctly.

This was a fantastic treat, and something different than the usual salads we make. I marinaded the chicken thighs in a combination of sriracha, sesame oil, soya sauce, honey, garlic and pepper, and when we topped off the salad with that, it was perfect.....awesome blend of sweet, sour, spicy, and mint :)

This is a lovely recipe, used siracha and added a bit more sesame oil. Didn't have the Thai basil, but will use next time.

I didn't think it was that spicy, so I added more garlic, fish sauce, chili paste and brown sugar, plus a diced red bell pepper and extra cilantro and mint. Garnished with extra peanuts and bell pepper for a Christmas coffee hour. Yummy!

I actually enjoyed this!  Made the dressing as written and loved it!  I went for what I had on hand such as using small flat noodles and sprinkled a little of dried-freeze basil.  I dislike mint and cilantro.  I love rice noodle salad with cucumbers so I added that.  Totally forgot about sesame oil.  I will try next time, but a teensy but though because it can overpower the whole dish.

I've made this a few times as written, and it never disappoints.  We have always used chicken, but tonight I am going to try it with beef.  If you like Thai cuisine, then you should give it a try!

Made it Loved it!  Might try it with thicker noodles next time and might try stirring in a spoonful of peanut butter into the sauce. The cilantro really made it.

I normally add regular rice when I make Thai Beef Salad, but used this recipe instead. (I did use some very similar dressing that I already had made up.) YUM! Due to comments in the reviews, I added some sesame oil to my dressing to emulsify it. I put this together at lunchtime and let it marinate until dinner. I put it in a Pyrex dish with a cover so I could shake it and flip it. I made this for one and scaled down as follows: 50 g dry noodles, 3 T dressing, 90 g grilled beef, plus herbs and veggies.

I’ve switched out the rice noodles for quinoa a couple of times my love the rice noodles. We make this on a regular basis when the herbs are in season from our garden.

I made this recipe as written with the exception of sesame oil which I did not have. Did not care for the salad, but the grilled chicken turned out fantastic using this marinade. Two stars is for the salad, but 5 for the chicken!

Forget what the critics say (not that there's many but I just read the negative reviews to amplify my reluctance to cook) but you can't really go wrong with this. I added 2 Thai chiles and 1 red jalapeno to the dressing and boy was it spicy! Flavors soaked up in less than 30 mins for me. Only obstacle was having to actually boil my vermicelli noods (not sure if they're the right ones) for a minute because only soaking them wasn't enough - they were still transparent and flat. You want the noodles to be white and cylindrical. I also didn't need to worry about the lack of lime - it's plenty flavorful.

I made this exactly as written with the exception of the fresh mint, the store was out.   I wasn't sure about the fish sauce but I'm glad I went ahead and got it to use; there was no 'fishy' taste.    The salad was very tasty and a big hit.  I'll be making this again.

I made changes to the recipe by adding fresh chopped veggies (sweet onion, red bell pepper, baby bok choy, mushroom) which I lightly sauteed in sesame oil. I followed the advice of a few people posted here and boiled the rice noodles longer than the original recipe. I also warmed the garlic, brown sugar, vinegar, fish sauce and sweet chili sauce mix before pouring over the sauteed veggies and noodles.  

The above was good overall but next time I will reduce the amount of vinegar to 1/4 cup and double the fish sauce and sugar.  I will also reduce the sauce a bit before adding to the noodles.  I will also follow the original recipe when cooking the noodles. They got very soft over time and began breaking into small pieces which wasn't pleasant to eat.  I will still serve this warm as that is just my personal preference.

After reading the reviews I was prepared to add some extra flavor. Even with the added garlic, green onions, more fresh herbs, honey and  lemon juice it  still wasn't - WOW! I thought that if I added corn starch to thicken it (up which it did) that the sauce would have some sticking power but it didn't.  I then let the noodles sit on a rimmed cookie sheet (again another great suggestions from a viewer) the noodles to sit in the sauce for 30 min. My husband and I marinated shrimp in the sauce then grilled it and topped the cooled noodles w/ the semi cool shrimp.  I've come to the conclusion that these noodles don't hold a sauce. The noodles are glass like and vary smooth unlike some pastas that have ridges, nooks and texture therefore can hold and absorb a sauce much better.  If I use these noodles again I will A. Soak the in HOT low sodium chicken broth or B. Combine the HOT chicken broth with some of the sauce (make some extra for this reason) instead of the hot water.

Made this today it was pretty good.I did add a little fresh ginger and cut back on the fish sauce to 2 tablespoons .I also added a little more brown sugar and sambala.Great recipe,very interesting flavors.You just kind of need to play with the recipe for the sauce and adjust the taste to your liking.

Absolutely loved this recipe.
I used egg noodles because I was out of rice noodles and made an extra sauce using Petjel wich is made of dry grounded peanuts and chili flakes, it's an instant peanut sauce from Surinam, spicy and tasty.

Good basic recipe.  I added extra vegs that I had such as cucumber and napa cabbage.  I do not like fish sauce so I left it out.  Next time I may add a bit more sesame oil and some soy sauce.  Seemed to be a tad dry, maybe because I left out the fish sauce. I put shrimp on top.  It was yummy.

Great dish to make for cool summer dinner.  I supplemented the herb mix with some lemon balm, but otherwise followed the recipe as found.  I used jalapeño instead of Fresno peppers.

I went into this with apprehension. Not a fan of cold dinner. But I compromised and had it luke warm. This was spot on one of the best I've had and the whole extended family just went on about it. I made enough for 12 servings for 6 people, just one serving left! Everyone went back for seconds except me, (diet). We added this to regular rotation.

I did not add the chili's at the end. It was strong enough without it. May even cut a tiny bit of the chili sauce or the seasoned rice vinegar. Cooled the noodles and dressed on a sheet pan. Scraped into a bowl and added the peanuts to serve.

Great flavor in the dressing - I added some shredded Savoy cabbage. Rice noodles were a little chewy; one of my friends suggested bean thread noodles instead, so next time, I'll try them.

Ohhhh Chef John, you are so right!!  My gosh, this will now be one of my go-to recipes especially on a hot summer day!  Love, love!  With all due respect, I really LOVE sesame seed oil so I tripled it (yep - tripled) for my own taste.  Overall, just an amazing amount of flavor pouring out of this and I was really surprised by how much the fresh herbs added!  I wouldn't think of leaving them out after tasting it.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I made this and after the 30 minute wait time something came up so didn't eat until the next day which I highly recommend if possible, absorbed all the liquid and flavor. I did try it the day I made it and was still awesome. Only changes I made were I used pad Thai size noodles and added half a lime and I have almost eaten it all myself, I can't stop!

Very easy to make. I would cut the sambal olek in half if your family/guests aren't used to spicy food. I left out the salt because I have high blood pressure and because the salt in the fish sauce is sufficient. I added 1 Tbsp of lime juice and 1 Tbsp of tamarind sauce which helped fill out the flavours.nit definitely needs to be tossed repeatedly to keep the sauce mixed into the noodles. I also substituted marinated and baked tofu for the chicken, which worked very well.

My husband liked it a lot! Of course, I didn't have fish sauce and don't care for cilantro, so I substituted Newman's sesame and ginger dressing for the fish sauce and left out the cilantro. Used less rice vinegar. I served it with a pre-cooked, Maple Leaf Farms frozen duckling, which paired very well and only took 30 min. to make the meal! I used half of the noodles called for, but about 3/4 of the remaining ingredients. Amounts were plenty for 2-3 servings. I will make it again.

Excellent!  So easy to toss together.  I did boil the noddles, but that's the only change I made.  Chef John did it again!!!!

At first, I wasn't convinced about the dressing. However, I added about 1 TB of peanut butter per other reviewers' suggestions, and it came out great! Definitely give the noodles and dressing a few hours to marry the flavors. Rather than chicken, I topped this salad with some chopped spicy peanuts and basil tilapia (just happened to have on hand).

Used soy instead of fish sauce, and didn't have the peanuts or chili paste, but it was still quite tasty! Light and refreshing.

This was a big hit at our last gathering.  Just a lovely blend of spicy, tangy, and sweet.

Quite nice, just the right hint of spicy with the mint/cilantro/basil there to cool it down.  I have bad luck with match-sticking carrots so I just shaved them. I imagine that if I didn't have any sambal in my pantry I could have just used sriracha in its place.  Also, next spring/summer thinking of using fresh thai basil vs. the italian flat leaf my grocer carries.
