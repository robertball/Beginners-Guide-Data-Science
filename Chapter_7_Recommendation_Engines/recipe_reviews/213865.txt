Wow I'm the first to review... The cheesecake was very good, only reason not 5 stars was because of the sourcream topping; I wanted it white like the picture but after adding vanilla it was beige tinted and then baking it for 10 minutes left it a slight golden color.

I was looking for a recipe similar to the way my grandmother made cheesecake and was very happy to find this one, since she also used the sweet sour cream topping. It was very easy to make and I had everything on hand! My topping turned out perfect and white. Tasty and pretty :)

Incredible and delicious! :) so easy!....I included crushed walnuts in the graham cracker crust then baked it for 10 minutes.  No cracks! refrigerated overnight and was able to slice perfect! I recommend this recipe. Beware, family and friends will request it all the time!
