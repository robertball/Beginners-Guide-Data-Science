I haven't seen this recipe in years.  It's a great dessert for a family supper.  I added vanilla to the batter as well as the sauce.  Don't be alarmed by the look of this when you pour the sauce over top - it's very sloshy, but it does turn out nicely.  Serve warm or cold, not hot, if you want the sauce to thicken up a bit.

Nothing wrong with this recipe at all. It turned out perfect and plain delicious. I noticed that most of the problems relate to the sauce being runny. YOU JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND LET IT COOL! IT WILL THICKEN. Also, when you spoon the batter into the dish, use the dish size indicated in the recipe because it should be a fairly thin layer of batter or else it will turn out rubbery.

This is a "take-off" on the Betty Crocker's Picture Cook Book recipe from 1950. The original has different ingredient amounts which change the consistancy of the finished pudding cake with much better results. The original is actually easier to make as well, since you just sprinkle the brown sugar and cocoa ontop of the first layer then pour hot water over the entire mixture before you pop it in the oven.

Loved it! The first time I made it, it came out a little bland. The next time I addes some salt to the batter and it was simply perfect.

It was good, and easy.  A good dessert in a pinch.  The sauce was a little too sweet, but I may have been careless with my measurements.  I might make it again.

There seemed to be too much sauce until it cooled off overnight.  Tasted good, esp. with icecream.

I used to make something like this when I was a pre-teen and teenager (I was a dessert-making fiend) and I hoped that this was it as I think my mother's recipe card was destroyed..... This was NOT it. The ingredients were correct, as I recall, but the pudding turned out a much different consistency, even though I added extra baking powder after reading previous reviews. The sauce never really thickened up (even after cooling on the counter several hours!) until it was in the fridge overnight. I added walnuts and used Craisins instead of raisins, so the taste was pretty good... But I will ask my mom if she still has the recipe somewhere. I don't think I'll make this particular version again, but thanks anyway, Holly. :)

This is like the pudding my Grandmother used to make. In rual Ontario. She always added raisins. I make it to this day. Sure brings back a lot of good memories. Another fantastic Canadian memory. Keep them coming.

Very good recipe! I used soy milk instead of regular milk and it turned out very nice...especially the sauce.  At first I was concerned about the watery consistency before baking...but the finished product was great!

Tried this and it was ok, but knew I had a similiar recipe that I liked better.  So, I searched it out and it has 1/2 c butter added to the batter, as well as an additional tsp of baking powder and increase the sugar to 1/2 cup as well.  No vanilla and no butter in the sauce.  Makes a much fluffier cake. Definitely worth the extra calories!!

I was looking for something to make for breakfast with the ingredients we have in stock that would be a nice change from oatmeal/cold cereal.  This was delicious and I will be making it again, soon!

I didn't have white sugar, so I used brown instead.  I added vanilla and as suggested, cinnamon.  

For the top, I used hot water, like was suggested, out of my Keurig coffee maker, but only used one cup instead of two.  I added 2 tablespoons of butter to the water and brown sugar mixture.  

We had this hot and it was great!

I would say this tasted just the way it's supposed to.  It's a Canadian classic.  Great served warm with vanilla ice cream.

this is almost identical to a recipe my mother made, and I still use to this day. My recipe calls for 1/2 cup sugar in the batter. I also usually use a bit of cinnamon and/or nutmeg in the batter. My mothers recipe also subbed in one apple diced small rather than raisins, although I have used both.. great when you need a dessert in a flash and don't have a lot of apples for a crisp.  Yummy with ice-cream, whipped cream or vanilla yogurt. :D

all good, but boil the raisins with the brown sugar and vanilla and let them plump up for an hour  or so first...

Always an easy one to make and a family favorite. To enhance the flavor, try adding 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1/8 tsp of nutmeg to the sauce.

For the French-Canadians out there this is your basic "Pouding Chomeur" recipe (though my childhood memories of this did not include raisins). Very yummy and decadent with ice cream.

Liked the flavor of the sauce, but was disappointed with the texture of the cake.  One reviewer indicated it was important to bake this in the proper size dish to avoid "rubbery" texture to the cake, so maybe the end results were my fault.  I probably won't try this again unless I'm just really wanting something to satisfy my sweet tooth.

I love this recipe from way back but a few years ago had to cut way back on my sugar intake due to a diagnosis of reactive hypoglycemia, so I used splenda in place of the sugar in the batter and replaced the full cup of brown sugar in the sauce with a half of cup of splenda and a half a cup of brown sugar instead. It turned out just great and I am so happy to still be able to enjoy this dessert!!!!

I found it to be a very strange dessert and mine came out tasting like pancakes with maple syrup as sauce, which was not expected at all. I wouldn't make this again.

This is the only dessert recipe that I have had to throw away from this site.  There was far too much "syrup" and the cake topping was hard like a sweet bagel/bread roll.  I am sorry to say that I shall not be making this again, I really thought that it would be better than it turned out.  Perhaps the syrup needs to be halved?

I haven't seen this recipe in years. My grandmother called it radio pudding because she heard it on the radio in the early 1900's and wrote it down.    We have enjoyed it many times.

Very traditional dessert at home.  My husband was very very happy with it, as it is the same as his mother used to make.  She loved it too. Made it multiple times and will again.

I was intrigued by this recipe.  Who can say no to pudding cake?  Since I've never heard of half-hour pudding cake, I have nothing to compare it to.

I made the recipe following the directions and measurements EXACTLY.  I chose to use golden raisins in the recipe for appearance.  The consistency and taste of the batter was a bit off-putting at first, but I understood that the sauce provides the flavor and the cake has to be thick in order to soak up the sauce and not fall apart.  The sauce thickened a little about 30 mins. after the cake was removed from the oven.

I'm not a big fan of this cake.  It's like a big pancake soaked in syrup.  This cake is good to make if you are craving something sweet and want something easy and quick to make with ingredients that you most likely already have in your cupboard.

This was super sweet. It reminded me of the simple baked goods that my French-Canadian Grandma used to make.

I was in the mood for a pudding type cake so I tried this one.  I would like to say that with most types of sauces unless they have a heavy amount of a thickening agent in them ie. flour, cornstarch...they will usually thicken as they cool which is the case with this sauce. It 'did' in fact thicken with cooling.  I would recommend adding a pinch of salt somewhere for flavor balance.

My mom use to make one, this is not it. The sauce was very runny and the crust rubbery. I won't waste my time again.
