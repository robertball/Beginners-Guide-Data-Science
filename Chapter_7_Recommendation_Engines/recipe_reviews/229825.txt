Made as is with the exception of light cream in place of half & half (it's what I had on hand) and scant 1/3 cup of Truvia in lieu of 1 cup of Splenda.  Set up beautifully; looks, smells, and tastes delicious.  This is a great low glycemic-load recipe, definitely a keeper for us!

When I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, the thought of not having dessert on Thanksgiving Day depressed me. I tested this recipe prior and absolutely love it! I can't wait to have it this Thanksgiving!

Maybe I used the wrong sweetener. am so disappointed. I thought his would be a home run so I made a double batch. The sweetening in it was horrible. I used a new bag of Splenda granulated sweetener made with Stevia. I followed the recipe exactly. The flavor of the sweetener is uneven and unpleasant. It left a lingering aftertaste.  I am disappointed and will likely through most of it out. Iâ€™ll save a bit to taste again another day.

This was an AMAZING recipe! No fuss, no muss, no weird ingredients (I used half milk and half cream, as I didn't have any half-and-half). Perfect amount of vanilla and eggs. I didn't have a glass pie dish, so I baked it in my round, glass casserole dish for an extra fifteen minutes, and it came out smooth and creamy and light and fluffy. Gorgeous! Totally didn't need the whipped cream I made for it. Thanks so much for this recipe! (I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, either, so I stole a list of spices from a different recipe - I don't remember which one, but I'm sure it's similar).

I did not have Almond Flour, but used Coconut Flour instead. I also substituted a 1/4 cup Heavy Cream w/ 1/2 cup half-n-half.
