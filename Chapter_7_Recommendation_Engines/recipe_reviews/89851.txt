I love this recipe! The first time I made it, my husband said he could eat it every day, but I'm limiting him to once/week!  We don't add the cherries - too sweet for our tastes.  Tastes great without them!

Excellent mariade. Easy and flavorful. I didn't even watch the proportions-- just threw together in a plastic bag, dropped in meat and let sit overnight.

My wife is not normally a lamb eater but this marinade has changed that!  We buy boned leg of lamb cut into kabob sizes and mix the marinade and lamb in a large container, let it sit overnight then transfer to ziplock bags with 2-3 servings per bag.  Freeze and pull out for an easy barbeque.  Wonderful!

Delicious marinade.  We used new potatoes instead of cherries and mushrooms and that was very good too.

This marinade is awesome! I used it on a couple pieces of lamb shoulder instead of doing kabobs and it was amazing. The husband and I both enjoyed it.

Delicious marinade! Thanks for sharing. Used it on both lamb and chicken kabobs. Omitted the pineapple & maraschino cherries since didn't have them, and also the butter.

Cut recipe in third....mostly 2 tablespoons of the Dijon mustard. marinaded for about 2 hours. This was really tasty. Did not add any of the fruit, just peppers, onions and mushrooms. Dredged them in the sauce when I put on the skewer. Served with spinach salad and pilaf, great!

What a delicious recipe - I made 1/4 of the marinde and poured it over 5 loin lamb chops. I doubled the oil (which was only 2 tbsp given the proportions) as I found the mustard taste too strong - but the added oil was just the ticket. I only refrigerated the lamb for a few hours and the flavour was awesome. Will try as kebobs in the future.

I omitted the fruit and threw these on the grill without basting them with anything.  Very good.  Lots of compliments.

Very good kabobs. I used boneless leg of lamb, and mixed colors of bell peppers. I used the cherry juice in the basting sauce but only used the cherries as a garnish. I had two guests here that had never tasted lamb and they both thought it was excellent!

Excellent!  Used boneless leg of lamb.  Added juice from half of a lemon to marinade.  Used fresh pineapple and cherries so did not baste with butter, pineapple juicke, cherry juice mixture.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

The marinade was great - just totally overpowered the lamb.  When I eat lamb I want to taste the lamb especially considering the cost of lamb.  Perhaps if I just brushed it over the lamb on the grill instead of marinating it that would have been better.  But I don't think I would waste more lamb on this recipe, sorry.

Made it per the recipe except added some thyme and chopped mint leaves. I also poured extra marinade over the prepared vegetables and left overnight in separate bowl. I then placed the veggies in one grill basket and the lamb in another. Grilled the veggies first and kept them in a preheated oven until the lamb was ready.  Very nice!

This turned out great. I trimmed the 4pound shoulder down to 2 pounds to end up with tender meat and then marinated it for 2 days. 
I grilled at moderate heat for 20 minutes which cooked the lamb nicely. I didn’t use cherries but added some mint sauce to the basting liquid.

I normally enjoy a dill type marinade on lamb but I was pleased with how this marinade turned out. I forgot to put to put it in overnight so it actually marinated for about 7 hours which turned out fine. I skewered the lamb together and did the vegetables separately. Turned out great.

The recipe was great, I did tweak it a bit by leaving out the sage; I don't care for it.
