I am wondering why  someone would rate this recipe without trying it first.   I tried this for the first time and it  came out perfect.  One of the reviewers said that the directions were incomplete??   Another one said that it came out chewy ?  Hmmmm,  i guess it depends how  Long you have been cooking  :) Anyways, I really enjoyed  this recipe  and will definitely do it every time I make a stir fry thank you !!

This is a great technique, new to me. Imade a misteak the first time in that when I added the chicken to the water it dropped the temperature too quick that meant it had to stay more than a minute to get back to boiling, which caused a little toughness. When I did it the second time I worked with smaller batches - the temperature stayed High, and the chicken was perfect. Really is like Chinese takeout!

Velveting is an excellent technique  and a must for making the closest one can get to how the better American Chinese restaurants achieve their excellent results.

When I was a very young cook I worked in a bistro.  One of our very popular dishes was a basic chicken stir fry made with mushrooms, onions, and pea pods served over rice pilaf.  Customers loved it.  It was a very simply dish and the reason why is because we did a simpler modified velveting to the chicken we used.  We cut chicken breasts into about 1 inch cubes.  Then we made a basic velveting slurry with cornstarch, salt, wine, and a bit of cognac.   The chicken was mixed into the slurry and portioned and then refridgerated for the lunch rush.

Over the many years I had forgotten about velveting until I remembered it years later.  I now use a very similar basic velveting recipe of cornstarch with a good wine, fortified wine, of mix some good wine with cognac to fortify it yourself.  

Once you have the basic recipe you can then experiment with other flavors of seasoning or alcohols.  The basic 30 minute "marinate" time allows the chemistry of the velveting mix to do it's magic.  

An important thing to remember about velveting is that this not a traditional  marinade where the meat sits in a distinct liquid.  And, velveting is not brining.  In brining the liquid is made extremely salty on purpose.  The reason is to create a highly saline solution that has a much higher salinity than the meat being brined.  The rea

First of all, DON'T WALK AWAY FROM THE STOVE ONCE THE MEAT IS BOILING.  That said, this is the best thing since Chinese take out. REALLY.  

However, I made some changes to the recipe. I didn't have rice vinegar so I used white vinegar.  I didn't have peanut oil, so I used olive oil. I figured vinegar is vinegar and oil is oil when your going to rinse it off anyway, or use it in boiling water. 

The changes did not change the outcome.  I've always wondered how they made the beef and pork so, well, velvety.  Now I know and I'll never not use this for Chinese cuisine, any recipe with sliced beef or pork again.  I actually velveted  beef,  pork, and chicken. It worked famously!!!!

I was planning to make pork fried rice and now I can't wait!

I made the recipe exactly as written. I cooked it for one minute after returning the water to a boil. I sautéed onions and added the chicken pieces. Then I combined with homemade stir fry sauce and added parboiled broccoli. The texture is AMAZING! Just like a good Chinese takeout. YUM! Will make again :)

This recipe gives a texture to the chicken that tastes just like Chinese take out!  I have made this for my family three times and every time we have zero leftovers. I brown the chicken in a skillet, add homemade sauce and par boiled broccoli.  It’s absolutely perfect and I’m happy to have stumbled on this fantastic trick! It saves so much money NOT ORDERING TAKE OUT!

Works for me. I didn't know about velveting...but it does work and comes out great. THAT'S how they do it at the restaurants. Works fine as a technique to cook chicken for any recipe.

I tried it as written, but didn't find that it worked at all. It seemed to make the chicken chewier, if anything!  And I wasn't able to brown it afterwards without overcooking it. More work, more dishes, and no benefit means I will not try it again.

Used chunks of chicken thighs instead of breastmeat. Added chicken to stir fried vegetables and my own sauce, then heated enough to finish cooking  the meat. Was so tender and flavorful.

I was so happy to find out about this technique!  It was simple and worth the extra time.  I used the chicken for a stir fry which was perfect and am looking forward to using it for other recipes.  Be sure to boil the chicken in batches.  And enjoy the extra tenderness this technique provides!

I prepped the chicken using this method before incorporating in a chicken and broccoli recipe. It will take a little more time but while chicken is marinating you can prep all your vegetables and sauce. The texture of chicken was amazing and also very tasty.

I followed the recipe. I used to always  do this step when stir frying chicken, but over the years I stopped doing it. It made such a difference that I will go back to my old ways.

I used chicken for stir fry and it was really good. Blanching the chicken was easier than I imagined. After blanching I used half that night in a stir fry with a peanut Thai sauce. (That I found on Allrecipes). We loved it!  The other half I vacuum froze for stir fry later. Great recipe/process!  Thank you!

I followed this recipe as the recipe recommended and it really made a difference in my chicken stir fry. It wasn't that complicated to do and the ingredients are pretty basic so I highly recommend this recipe. After going through these extra steps I followed a standard chicken and brocolli recipe and everybody loved it!

This was just like the Chinese restaurant chicken!!  Wonderful!!  Instead of the vinegar, I used cooking sherry and it was fabulous!!  When I stir fried it, I added a little more salt and a sprinkle of garlic powder and that took it to the next level. I will definitely be making this often!!

This technique is a total game changer. I tried it on cubed chicken in chicken tikka masala and got amazing results. I actually made two batches cooked in the exact same gravy. The non-velveted chicken did not even come close to the moistness of the velveted chicken. Thank you for posting this!!

I fully agree with Angels post,even if you may have your personal perfect recipe for a certain dish...how can you have an  opinion upon someone else’s recipe without even testing it out..stop it internet trolls,you do not bully neighbor.(maybe you do,but I doubt it.)
I have made almost the exact recipe without the sugar and it was fantastic.I have the chicken thinly sliced in my fridge right now..this style and I’m very excited to add my veggies.Thank you or taking time to share your recipe...

You have no idea how happy finding this recipe has made me!  I followed the instructions as written and ended up with the exact results I was hoping for: Tender, moist, thinly  sliced stir fry chicken!  Just like the Chinese restaurants!   Just one note: I had to sub apple cider vinegar for the rice vinegar but I doubt it made a huge difference.

Totally delicious!!!
The cabbage was surprisingly good if not a star! That crunch was perfect with the fish and dressing. I added cilantro also :)

I made it just as written, and found it pretty bland. Next time I will use my regular stir fry marinade, which already includes cornstarch and add an egg white.  it seems as though the velveting process has most to do with the egg white and cornstarch. Extra flavorful ingredients will make it just that much better. I usually use soy, sherry,oil,vinegar and cornstarch, maybe fish or oyster sauce or even samba oelek for a kick.

I have not  tried it yet. Wondering if the chicken can be placed in the freezer instead of refrigerated? (To last longer than a few hours)
