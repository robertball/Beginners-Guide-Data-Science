I loved the flavors, but I made the mistake of making this in my slow cooker, and it turned to mush. I made this again, in the oven, and followed another reviewer's tips - added 1 can French onion soup, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup rice, 1 can water, added the chicken pieces on the top, and baked at 350 for an hour, uncovered.  It was wonderful(!), but my chicken was a little overdone - I think 45 minutes would do it.  The third time I made this, I reduced the baking time to 45 minutes, and the chicken was perfect...but the rice was crunchy.  Aarrgh.  Next time, I will bake the rice 15-20 minutes, THEN add the chicken, and cook it 45 minutes.  This dish is way too easy for me to throw it out.  Thanks for the recipe!

I increased the cook time to 52 minutes - the rice was fully cooked and had absorbed all of the moisture.  This is an excellent low-fat meal that I will be sure to cook again.

As it is, I am not sure how this recipe cooks all the way through in the time allowed.  I made chicken and rice my way (one can french onion soup, one can cream of mushroom soup, one can water and one cup rice) and added fresh okra to the mix.  Then put the chicken pieces on top and bake UNCOVERED for 1 hour at 350 degrees or until chicken juices run clear.  Like this, it was very good.  The okra doesn't add a ton of flavor but it does add an extra helping of vegetables to an already good dish!

The recipe should have called either for instant brown rice OR spent longer in the oven
By the time the chicken was done cooking the rice still wasn't done. 

The combination of foods was interesting and tasty.  A nice change.  One of my kids liked it, the other 
didn't.  BUT, I think that if I did the rice differently next time he would like it better too.
Give it a try, it's a nice change in vegetable!

This recipe was very yummy.  My 8 year old loved the rice and didn't even realize it had okra in it.  It came out creamy, and the flavor was wonderful.  The only canges I made were:I used fresh okra, chicken thighs and added salt to it.  Will make again soon.

The dish turned out to be bland.  I followed the directions but should have marinated the chicken and added some more spices myself.

My brown rice needed 90 minutes to absorb most of the  moisture.
Next time I'll increase the temperature and watch the cooking time. I did spice it up with red pepper flakes  I don't think 350  is high enough to cook the raw  brown rice.

This was really tasty.  I also cooked it for 52 minutes and it turned out great.  The only addition I would make is to cube the chicken and mix it in.

Love Okra, and LOVE how this recipe has REAL veggies and brown rice.  Some of the other recipes have a full days worth of sodium and less than a gram of fiber  (2 cans of  soup Plus a packet of onion soup mix... plus.... salty crackers or cereal And butter?  I feel good serving this and variations with other veggies to my family often.   Yes, do up the cook time at least 5 minutes since brown rice cooks so long.  And This is great with avariety of veggies- frozen spinach etc.  If you want more flavor just add dried or suateed onions, garlic of herbs.

I'm sorry, but this came out horrid.  We had never tried okra before, and so I looked for a recipe to use it in and tried this one.  Maybe I did something wrong, but it came out slimy.  The chicken came out bland.  I may try this again with another vegetable and more seasonings on the chicken.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but, decided to add a little Cajun flair to it.  I added 1 10 oz. can of Rotel Diced Tomatoes with green chiles, and used 7/8 cup Swanson Box Chicken Broth instead of water.  I cut back on the water because of the water in the Rotel.  I also sauteed 1/2 onion, 1/2 bell pepper, parsley, and green onions in 2 tblspns. butter and added this to the mixture.  Even though I added chicken broth, I still ended up adding about 1/4 tsp. of salt.  I used red pepper instead of black pepper.  Be careful, the Rotel is already peppered.  This added a great flair to an already excellent recipe.  I did extend the cooking time to 1 hr. 15 mins. to get the rice to cook properly.  Hope you enjoy it.

We love this recipe - although because my family has to eat Gluten Free due to Celiac disease we don't use prepared soup.  I sub one 14 1/2 oz can of diced tomatoes for the can of condensed mushroom soup - and I use a 16 oz bag of frozen sliced okra instead of slicing it myself - otherwise everything else is the same.  We love the tomatoes with the okra too.  I think they add a bit more liquid which aids the brown rice in it's cooking....oh I also put the chicken in the pan first and cover it with everything else so it doesn't dry out while cooking.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I made this, partly because I had never had okra before in my life. it turned out really good. The chicken, espcially, was nice and tender. The only reason I rated it 4 instead of 5 was because I had to substitute cayenne for the paprika, so I can't gauge how it was supposed to taste. 

The cayenne was still good, just a bit on the spicier side. I also added some other frozen veggies that I had, along with some canned corn, which I think added some nice texture.

One thing I will say is if I make it again, I won't use white rice instead of brown. Some it it was still undercooked when it came out of the oven.

I think I missed something because I love rice, okra and chicken but it literally had no flavor!! I thought the generous portion of pepper and paprika I added would help but I wonder what we could do different to make it better!!

Great base- I added mushrooms and used fresh spinach instead of Okra.  Seasoned with pepper, garlic salt and chili pepper for a kick.  Also topped chickend with dry onion soup mix.  Turned out great, loved it.

I tweeked this recipe until almost completely different dish! I needed basic recipe for what I had in mind, so this wiorked out great.  I used box of Zatarans Jambalaya mix with can of rotel tomatoes, one cup of water. added the okra and nestled the chicken in it.  There is no need to add spices, of course!

This was actually quite good!  I love okra, so I was thrilled to find something EASY to use it in.   Substitutions I made:  I melted 2T of butter in the pan as the oven preheated, and then I baked 6 chicken legs for 30 minutes at 400 before turning the heat down to 350.  I transfered the chicken to a plate and let it rest while I mixed the rice ingredients.  I used basmati rice instead of brown, and a soup can of milk instead of water.  I also used cream of chicken soup.  Finally, I added a can of french style green beans.    I baked this dish for 50 minutes tightly covered with foil and it when my whole house smelled great I knew it was done.    Wow!  So easy and delish!

This was reeeally good! i only had white rice but it worked out just fine. I'm pretty sure i added my own seasonings to my liking and i know i added some of paula deens house seasoning to the chicken. I've always been a big fan of okra since i was little but i can see how if you have never had it before you would think it's weird and slimy lol. I like it though! 5 stars lots of flavor

If I had to make this dish again, I would make the rice separately and pour the cream of mushroom/ chicken mixture over it.  My rice never seemed to get soft when I baked it all together.

Giving this 5 stars because it was a nice change, tasted great, and soooo easy!  I had chicken breasts already cooked in the crockpot, so shredded them on top and baked covered in foil for about 35 mins until instant rice was cooked. We served ours with apple sauce and low fat cottage cheese.

Several change are required to make this dish work.  This recipe was quite bland.  Also, it required 90 minutes, not 45.  The okra protein blended with the cream of mushroom soup to create a slimy consistency.

I made this for my mom who loves okra and she thought it was amazing. I read some of the other reviews and baked it longer so the rice would cook and it worked perfectly. I also added a few peppers to make it a little spicier.

Delicious! I used white rice instead because I didn't have brown. I also baked the chicken the night before. I cooked the soup mix for 23 minutes and then added chicken for another 20 minutes. Easy great recipe!

I thought this was good, I followed the advice of baking with the rice mixture for 20 minutes and adding the chicken and continue baking for an additional 45 minutes.  That was perfect.  I personally like more flavor, I tried chili flakes which was better, my husband added Old Bay and I really liked that, I would make it again as it is easy and add the Old Bay during cooking.

I didn't have cream of mushroom soup or brown rice so I used 1 can of coconut milk and 1 cup of basmati rice. I added fresh okra and tomatoes from my garden and added salt, cracked pepper and several spices. I baked at 400 for 45 minutes and it came out perfect. This recipe was quick, easy, very flavorful, and my family loved it. I will definitely make it again.

I don't like okra so I couldn't give it a higher rating but it isn't a bad recipe. Okra is very common/popular in Japan where we live so thought I would give it another chance and this looked promising. I sauteed the frozen okra with garlic before mixing the rest of the ingredients just because I love garlic. I also left out the chicken since I'm a vegetarian.  I thought it was yummy but okra is okra. My kids really hated the okra. It was quite filling and comforting and I would make it again with another vegetable. Maybe carrots or broccoli but I would put the broccoli in in the last 20 minutes or so and would probably use frozen broccoli.

I had to make a few changes but it worked out yummy. It took 1hr15mins to cook although I had increased the amounts! I used drumsticks so they stayed moist but the one piece of breast I put in did not. I added carrots and substituted spinach for okra. Oh and a can of mushrooms and half cup of sour cream. Family loved it even the boy that doesn't like rice!

The rice didn't cook up. Texture wasn't appetizing. I would prob say to use instant rice and fresh sliced okra instead of frozen.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe.  Not only is it delish but it took me 5 mintues to prepare, only dirtied a measuring cup and a casserole dish, and took one hour to bake.  I even used frozen chicken breashets!  Towards the end of baking I did cut up the breasts to get more flavor.  I also used 1.25 cups water.

After reading other people's reviews I used some suggestions. I used a quick instant brown rice which came out perfect when cooked at 350 for 50 mins. I added ginger to the mixture, as I prefer the spice and it's good for you. Also used 1/2 c. of sour cream which made it a bit creamer, and added additional salt, pepper and paprika.

this recipe needs more tweaking. i read the reviews and added the packet of dry onion soup mix so the flavor was really great but just like so many people wrote...the chicken was overdone and the rice was not done. i even used wild rice, hoping it didn't need as long as brown rice. :( i even removed the already overcooked chicken and put the rice back in but there just wasn't enough moisture to get it soft. nice flavor but i won't do this again!

Pretty good.  It was a nice change in vegetable.  Mine did come out a tad slimey, but I think that's just the nature of okra. I added some salt and I think next time I make it I will add seasoned salt and chopped green chiles to it.

Easy dinner to make. I like Okra so however many ways I can eat I am impressed with. I think  the Okra can be easily replaced with  different vegetables  if wanted. I only gave it a 4, because it is simple in taste.

I followed some of the other reviewers suggestion to add a can of french onion soup and I found that it made the dish so salty, I could barely eat it.  Other than salt, I could barely taste anything else.
It did take almost an hour to cook the rice through and I had to add some water during the last 15-20 minutes.  I added the chicken 10 minutes after I put the rice in the oven. 
The great thing about this recipe though is that it is a super easy way to make risotto! I will play with this some more and hopefully find something lower in salt that works as well to give that creamy texture to the rice.

I substituted cream of mushroom soup with French onion soup instead. I cooked the rice separately first with the soup - until still very moist - then baked with chicken & okra. Yummy

After adding additional seasonings like others have mentioned this was awesome. Other than some tweaking with the cook times( the rice wasn't quite done) I won't change anything next time either.

I haven't really cooked with okra before, but this turned out very slimy. Maybe I cooked it too long.

I made recipe as written as far as ingredients. Made a couple of substitutions due to what I had on hand.  I liked the combination of flavors  but it was a little bland. Husband was not impressed but I will try it again and add some extra spices. Thank you for another option for okra!

This was good. I read other reviews complaining about cooking time so I soaked my brown rice for an hour before cooking and added boiling water to the pan. I still ended up cooking it for 70 minutes. I tried cooking it covered for the recommend time but it was very watery still so after the 30 minutes I uncovered it and increased the temperature to 425 and cooked an additional 40 minutes. Changed to the recipe: I didn't have cream of mushroom soup but used "golden mushroom soup" I also read reviews about it being bland so I sprinkled a little onion powder, garlic powder, and chili powder when mixing the ingredients (not very much). I also only added 1/2 the chicken and okra. I don't like reviews that change the original recipe, but this turned out so good!

A great base recipe. This turned out great because I added my own Cajun seasoning to it, as well as a bunch of garlic salt, oregano, thyme, salt and pepper. Boyfriend loved it...drumsticks didn't cook on it... I later pan-fried them--otherwise 350 for an hour works well. 1/2 a bag of frozen okra was more than enough

I used fresh okra. It came-out with a texture of raw eggs- yuck. Oh well for trying to eat okra healthy I guess I'll stick to frying it from now on.

My chicken turned out really dry, even though I put the rice in first for about 7 minutes, then added the chicken.  There wasn't much flavor to it, especially the chicken.  The okra is really gooey and when mixed with the rice, makes a strange texture.  It was a good idea, though.  With some changes, it could be really good!
