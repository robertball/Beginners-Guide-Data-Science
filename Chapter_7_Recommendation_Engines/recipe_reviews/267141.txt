Such a great use for leftover steak! Jar salads are so convenient and great for those with busy lifestyles - prep once, and eat for a week! Make sure you get a good quality Greek dressing for best results.  This makes huge salads that keep me full until dinner time. I'm definitely adding this to my regular rotation! Tip: be sure to pack the jars real tight to minimize air pockets and they will stay fresh all week!
