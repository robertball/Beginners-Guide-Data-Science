This was really good - better than I expected!  The only changes I made were browning the chicken before I put in in the baking pan and using a bottled spaghetti sauce.  I browned the chicken in just a touch of olive oil, assembled the casserole by the directions, covered it in foil and popped it in the fridge until I was ready for it.  Then all I did was put it in the oven while I was cooking the pasta and I had an easy weeknight meal that my entire family (including 1 very picky anti-meat kid) loved and requested again very soon.

Wow! Great dish! I cut the serving size in half because it's just the 2 of us. I did doctor it a bit. First, I'm always looking for ways to "sneak" veggies into my cooking (my boyfriend is not big on them *LoL*) So I sauted a couple chopped carrots with some red onion in a little EVOO before adding my tomatoe paste and sauce. I used Italian seasining, just for convience, instead of all the individual spices it called for. I also added a couple dashs of Franks Red Hot Sauce, and a couple glugs of Black Bean with Ginger and Garlic sauce. I added more minced garlic then called for. I didn't have chicken breasts, so I used thighs instead. Before pouring the sauce on the chicken, I stirred in half a chopped red pepper, and half a chopped yellow pepper. (By adding them last it prevents them from getting soggy) Instead of motzza, I used parm cheese. Turned out great! I served it over some lightly buttered linguini. Yummy!!!

WOW! I HATE Chicken Breasts....till now!  This produced absolutely THE JUCIEST chicken breast I have EVER had! Rave reviews from the family! Husband and son DEVOURED it! This makes a lot of sauce, so everytime I make it I serve it over linguini or fettucini noodles.  Will definately make this again and again! P.S. Great Italian meal to serve to guests!

I absolutely loved this dish!  Better than I expected.  I took the advice that someone else shared and cooked the chicken breast in a pan ontop of the stove first.  I sprinkled some poultry seasoning on first and used italian bread crumbs to batter the chicken and cooked it in some EVOO.  I only browned them on each side.  I used a bottle of my favorite sauce and used half a can of tomato sauce and a can of tomato paste.  I also added tomatoes and onions.  The chicken is so moist and juicy in this dish (and I'm not the biggest fan of chicken breast).  My husband really loved this meal and we are having it for leftovers tonight.
Thank you for sharing this simple recipe!

This wasn't bad at all, I've tried it twice, once as written (except for seasoning the sauce to my tastes) and once using a 6 cheese Italian blend.  Both times the meal tasted good, the chicken was fully cooked and the sauce was good. I really think this loses something by being breaded but not sealed (frying/baking chicken before adding sauce) though.  I don’t think I’ll give it a third try, it’s just a slightly quicker version of Chicken Parmesan and it really doesn’t add much to the traditional.  Thanks for sharing this recipe though!  Oh and a tip for the sauce, using puree instead of the sauce itself gives the sauce a great depth.

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  I was really short on time so I ended up using my favorite spaghetti sauce instead of making the tomato sauce.  It still turned out very good.  The chicken turns out so moist.

I took the advice of previous reviewers and browned the chicken before putting into casserole dish. I also added black olives and a small can of mushrooms. My husband and I both loved it - it is even better the next day.

It was very good. I ended up making 5 pieces of chicken breast and a vegetable soup out of it. I first sauteed some onion with a lot of galic in a pot. Then I added 1.5 can of  large tomato sauce and 0.5 can of tomato paste, sugar and the dried spices like it calls for. In the meanwhile, I coated my Tyson fozen chicken breast( the thin kind) with bread crumb and galic pepper, and browned on very high heat on a oven ready pan. I layered the cheese and poured 1/2 of the sauce over them. The chicken was baked for 30 minutes on 420 degree. While the chicken was cooking, I pour 2 cans of vegetable broth to the rest of "sauce" in the pot and added bay leaves, 1 bag of fozen vegetable mix, and 3 cups of celery. I let the soup simmered for 15 minutes and it was done. The chicken was close to done at that time. So I added the rest of cheese on top of it. Both the soup and the chicken just turned out great.

Family liked it.  I think I prefer Chicken Parmagian where it ends up crunchier because it isn't baked in sauce.  But this was different and a put in the oven and forget about it kind of dish which is always fun to place on the table later.

I sliced the chicken thin as I like sauce to cover all my chicken, not just the outside of a thick piece.  

I sauteed garlic in EVOO with a dab of butter and browned the breaded chicken pieces.  Instead of my usual seasoned breadcrumbs I did as the recipe suggested and sprinkled on garlic powder, salt & pepper on top.  

I didn't have mozarella so used swiss and cheddar.  

I also used a jar of premade marinara sauce. 

I was surprised the cheese in the middle pretty much melted into the sauce.  Ended up like a cheesey tomato sauce.  My sauce was also a little more runny than I'd like so would perhaps add a can of tomato paste to the jar of sauce I used.

I served it over spaghetti.  I see the recipe doesn't say to do that.  I thought it was a given but see another reviewer didn't do that.  

Because I sliced the chicken breast in half I also reduced the time to 40 min.  

I have a feeling like many dishes it will taste better tomorrow than it did tonight.

So the 1 star missing was mostly due to the idea that chicken parm is my preference, how runny it was and that the cheese melted into the sauce more than expected.

I made this exactly as suggested and it turned out fine.  I didn't think it was spectacular, but a good basic chicken & sauce recipe.  Very close to chicken parmesan.

This recipe turned out really good, although i coated the chicken in some miracle whip before the bread crumbs (it gives it a nice little zing.... cant tell its miracle whip after its baked) next time i think im going to add more cheese and instead of bread crumbs coat the chicken in a crunched cornflakes and parmesan cheese mixture, but it was a really good easy and quick recipe, will defiantly be making it again!!!

this was a HUGE hit in our house!  Even my picky daughter ate her entire serving!  I didn't have mozzarella, so I used provolone cheese instead.  YUM!  Will definitely be making this again!

Very, very good!  I used my own spice combination for the sauce, but I'm sure what's listed will still be excellent.  I also used seasoned instead of plain crumbs, because that's what I had on hand.  The chicken came out so tender, it was like a healthier version of chicken parm, because it didn't need to be breaded and fried first, seriously!  My husband and kids raved!  I'll be making this one again.

Just made it. Super yummy and easy. I didn't have bread crumbs so I crushed garlic flavored wheat thins. Also used a big can of hunts garlic tomato sauce. Sprinkled oregano and Italian seasoning over the chicken then did the sauce and cheese on top.

This was a good recipe. My husband and children loved it! I had difficulty with it as it truly is for cheese LOVERS. I thought I loved cheese, but not quite enough. It was good, but too much for me. I'll definitely make it for the family again though!

This is a favorite in our house now.  Anytime I cook it for guests they absolutely love it.  The only thing I do differently is to brown the chicken first (as others have suggested) and use a little less cheese.  Delicious!!!

DELICIOUS!!  Mixed Panko w/seasonings for the chicken breading, but otherwise followed recipe.  My picky 11-yr. old actually had seconds.  Definitely going in the regular rotation - thanks!

Very Good, the family kept calling it chicken lasagna! When I was making it I could not find tomato paste however I did have a jar of spaghetti sauce and used it. I cut boneless breasts in half everyone likes small portions at my house, then I browned the breasts.rolled in bread crumbs covered with sauce and cheese. Cooked until done added more cheese cooked until melted everyone loved it! I do recommend that you cut back on the sauce a little, it tends to over power everything else. Daughter says she did not have to use ketchup so I know it had too much sauce.

Just finished dinner and my family loved it!  I made a few changes:  I mixed grated parmesan cheese with the bread crumbs (I used Italian breadcrumbs) and browned the chicken on both sides in olive oil in a fry pan.  I also used about 1/2 the cheese the recipe called for and it was a huge amount even with half.  I also chopped up some fresh basil on top of the sauce.  I did not use the aluminum foil and cooked it for about 30 minutes since it was partly cooked on the stove.  It turned out great with some angel hair pasta it was perfection.

I'm a real cheese lover, but this recipe had way too much! I didn't even use as much cheese as the recipe called for & it was too much. Tasted a lot like chicken parm.

This is worth making again. Next time I will use thinner chicken pieces, and brown them quickly before proceeding. I used Muir Glen tomato sauce & paste- by far the best taste, & worth the few extra pennies. Served with bowtie pasta, this recipe serves a hungry crowd!

This dish was okay. The first thing it lacked was seasoning on the chicken. Next time I would season it with salt and pepper and brown it in a pan on both sides. Then, I would top it with the cheese and tomato sauce. I never covered my dish with foil because I like my cheese to become crunchy and deep golden brown. I am giving this 4 stars because as long as you season the chicken well, it's a great weeknight meal.

Wow! This is Delicious! The only change that I made was to use Italian bread crumbs. This definitely reminds you of Chicken Parmesan. I used "Free" and 2% Milk" cheese, trying to cut down on the fat. Thanks for the post.

With a family of 6 a filling meal is important. This was great and filled their tummies. I pan fried my chicken till it was almost done and then I put it all in the oven, just so it didn't have to cook as long.

This chicken was soo moist and delicious! I didn't brown the chicken because I like more tender meat and browning always seems to make the meat tougher, so I just baked the chicken as it was, and cooked for 1 hour, it came out perfectly done and deliciously flavored! I used bottled spaghetti sauce in the interest of time, and it was still great! This is a keeper!

This is DEFINITELY a dish for someone that loves CHEESE and TOMATO SAUCE! I am one of those people! So a chicken dish that comes with all that extra goodness to soak up with some bread/rolls/toast is A+! Very simple to make, very simple to eat. :)

I made this exactly according to recipe (except scaled back on the chicken and cheese, using 2 lbs of chicken and about 1.5 lbs of cheese), and it was great.  I'm not sure how often it will make it into the rotation (pretty high calorie), but it definitely makes an easy, delicious dinner.

We loved this dish!  Not exactly the most health concious meal, but it was worth it!  I will probably cut back on the cheese to about half of what is called for, everything else will stay as suggested.  My kids loved it and actually ate the leftovers the next day!  The chicken was super tender.  This will become a staple in our chicken recipe collection!

I am not quite sure why this was rated so high.  It was ok but not what we expected at all.

It tastes good, but an expensive dish because of how much cheese it requires, it was good, but i wont be making it again.

This was pretty good.  A little too much sauce for my family's tastes so next time I would use only one 398ml can of tomato sauce.  I also cut back a td on the cheese.  Good!

This was a big hit at my house! (All Cheese lovers!) Everyone really loved it and had seconds. I used Italian bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese to coat the chicken.  I serve it on top of spaghetti. This is a recipe I will make again!

Wonderful recipe. I used one 10oz. jar of my fav spaghetti sauce, rather than the tomato paste and sauce.

THis recipe is YUMMY!  I didn't have bread crumbs so I substitued crushed cornflakes and also used colby jack cheese in place of the cheeses.  My husband really enjoyed it!

I made this for dinner the other night and it was a hit! I did tweek it a bit for my own preference. I subsituted the cheddar cheese for parmesan cheese and layed the chicken over spaghetti. The chicken would also be great in some italian bread as a chicken parm sandwich.
