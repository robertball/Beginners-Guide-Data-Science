YUM!  My husband and I whipped these up in no time.  The assembly line helps!  We made them as potstickers instead to save on the fat.  (We brushed a non stick pan lightly with oil, set on medium heat, added about 8 potstickers at a time and let them sit for 2 minutes without touching, then added 1/4 cup of chicken broth, covered and turned down on low and let steam for another 2 minutes. Afterwards, we removed them and placed them on a sheet pan in the oven set at 200 degrees to keep them warm while we did the same with the rest.  In between batches make sure to clean off your pan with a paper towel).  We dipped them in gyoza sauce and hot chili oil.  They turned out beautiful and loaded with flavor!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are incredibly good. I cut back on the cilantro to 1 bunch (pretty large). The only issue I had was with the lemongrass - and I didn't see anyone else mention it, so it might be me. I had a hard time getting the lemongrass minced in my food processor. I pulsed it for a while, then cranked it, then sat around hoping the lemongrass would soften, then cranked it again. It turned out fine, but there are still a few rather intimidating chunks it there, so next time I would bash up the lemongrass and ginger together in the processor with just the soy and then add the other ingredients once it was fine. Sorry this is so long - thanks so much for the recipe!

HOLY CAMOLE!!!  These are EXCELLENT.  Made them with the wonton wrapper recipe and they turned out perfect.  They took a little TLC but it was well worth the work!

Awesome. Made these as "potstickers". Used boneless chicken thighs and eliminated the lemongrass.  Put every other ingredient into a food processor until blended,then wrapped the filling in the wonton wrappers and kept in the triangle shape.  We sauteed them in a tbsp of veg oil for 2 minutes, added 2 tbsp of water, covered and let steam for 4 minutes.  Dipped in sweet chili sauce and YUMMMMMY!  Made these for guests 2 nights in a row and RAVE reviews!  Looks difficult but VERY easy and delicious!***update*** used ground pork last night and that was just as yummy!!!

Instead of the chicken, I used 1 lb diced pork chop and 1 lb ground pork sausage.  Instead of deep frying them, I brushed them with oil and fried on both sides for a few minutes in a large frying pan, then added 2/3 cup water, covered the pan, and boiled them in the water until they are done.  They were more like potstickers, but still turned out awesome!  I served them over rice with soy sauce and a green salad.

I made these last week, it was a little tedious but well worth the effort. for me the recipe made about 60 to 70 wontons. I did freeze them before I fried them. They turned out great and I made it with the Hot and Sweet Dipping Sauce from this website.

This was an unbelievable recipe. We actually cut down a lot on the ginger and the cilantro - added a bit more pepper and a bit more salt. In the broth we cut up green onions and threw them in at the very last minute - it would be really good with some sprouts as well. The making of them is a bit tedious but definitely definitely worth it!!

I had been wanting to make these.  I realized I had chicken with cilantro already in it leftover from sour cream enchiladas the night before.  So I took 1 Cup of the shreaded chicken mixture, added 1/2 tsp. ginger, 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp terrayki sauce.  Mixed well then spooned 1tsp of mixture in each wonton.  These were very good. We dipped in sweet sour sauce and hot mustard.

These were delicious and really easy to make. I didn't have lemongrass, but they were still really flavorful. The only other changes I made were to add about 1/2 tablespoon hoisin sauce and to steam instead of fry.

These are great and easy to make.  I added carrots in mine.  Some other suggestions are bean sprouts and bok choy.  I bought already made wonton wrappers to save some time.  I also used chicken breast instead of thighs and steamed mine to keep it on the healthy side.

really delicious, like many others I cut out the lemon grass, used less ginger and used 1.5 green chile peppers, one bunch of cilantro and they were great.
I made about 35-40 of them because those are all the wrappers i had and i kept the rest of the filling for lettuce wraps (also delicious (: )

great recipe! i think it would have been good as the original, but with my modifications it was very good (:

Just made these for a party I'm having this weekend.  I doubled the recipe and still only used one large bunch of cilantro.  I was frying just a few to make sure they were party worthy.  When I tasted them I thought I really couldn' t wait to taste them with the sweet and sour sauce but I didn't have any so I just spread on a little bit of pineapple preserves and it was awesome.  Then I came up with the idea to add pineapple preserves to the mixture before frying.  It made them awesome and helped with the slightly overpowering ginger flavor.  If you like your food a little sweet they are awesome that way.  That being said, they are still awesome the original way also.

These were good. Like any wonton recipe (and I've made a few now), it is very time consuming (unless you have some little helpers, but I never do). I had to eat them plain because I have absolutely no dipping sauces on hand, but they were still good. I made a few changes to this as well. I omitted the lemon grass and sesame oil (I had none), used two serrano peppers in place of 1 red chile, and used dried ginger instead of fresh. Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't really care for these.  The texture was too mushy for the filling and too much cilantro...and I love cilantro.  I think it may be better with diced ingredients and maybe breast meat would have made a difference.

This is one of the best wonton recipes I've ever had.  I used some chicken leftover from a previous roast.  Made tons more filling than I could use, but it had frozen well.  Just be sure to thaw and drain before using as stuffing again.

very tasty! great flaver and spices.I only used half of the cilantro it calls for, two seemed a little intense. my only suggestion is DONT over blend the chicken! blend all other ingredients first and then add chicken, only blend a little, dont puree it!!! thank you for this recipe!!

I used Star_Eyes' suggestion and steamed these, and they turned out quite light and tasty (34 calories each).  Instead of putting 2 lbs of whole chicken pieces in a food processor, I bought 2 lbs of ground chicken.  After making 50 wontons, I still had about 3/4 of the chicken filling left over.  I guess that's just more for next time, but I wonder if that happened to anyone else.

These were fantastic and I have very high expectations for food made at home and in restaurants!  I opted for frying them a bit in sesame oil (I preferred the ones that I browned up nicely on both sides) and then steaming in the chicken broth as another poster recommended.  We don't deep fry much for health (and taste) reasons.  No lemon grass in our big grocery store here in a large city so went ahead without it.  Glad I didn't wait to make them until I made it to an Asian grocer.  Also, added garlic chili paste (about 2 tsp to the chicken cilantro mix).  Oldest son and hubby liked 'em a lot too!

The flavor is amazing.  I did not deep fry but froze them and used them in a soup.  Delicious.  However, I precooked the chicken before making.  And when cut open in the soup, the wonton filling does not like to stay together.  Is this the cause"?  I don't think I would mince the chicken with the other ingredients, but instead, chop of small and add to it.
Delicious!

use the lemongrass that comes in a tube, it will blend much better, instead of cilantro I used thai basil, also ground white meat chicken breasts instead of theighs and baked these in the oven at 350, use mini muffin tins to form the wonton cup and fill the pockets with the mixture, spray with olive oil cooking spray! much healthier this way..

I used ground chicken not thighs.  I skipped the lemon grass and replaced it with some chopped up corn and carrots.  Omitted the ginger completely.  To save on calories I baked them in the oven for about 10 mins at 325 degrees turning them half way.  Served them with some hot plum sauce.  Lots of work, but well worth it.  My guest loved them.

These were really good! I cooked the chicken before putting it in the food processor.  I think next time I will just dice the chicken, put everything else in the food processor and mix them together in the end.

I followed the recipe exactly and could not have been more impressed!! I book marked the recipe because it sounded good...took me a while to get the ambition to track the ingredients ....did so with crispy kung pao recipe for the opening ceremony in Beijing! The flavor in these is awesome! These were pretty quick and easy. Next time gonna try pan fry steaming them!

These were so good! I couldn't get wonton wrappers so I used gow gee pastry and it made 30 rather large potstickers. I took the advice of another reviewer and steamed them instead of deep frying, and served them with Japanese Potsticker Dip from this site. Well worth the effort - will definately be making these again.

I am making these right now and I can tell that they are going to be great.  Here is my version.
15 boneless chicken thighs, 3 Costco packs
1 stalk lemongrass,
1 bulb garlic,
1 bunch cilantro,
2 bunches spring onion,
everything else the same (proportionally).
I put everything through my KitchenAid food grinder attachment and mixed well.

Some of these will be fries as wontons, the others will have to go into eggroll wrappers.

Absolutely perfect! Tasted like an authentic egg roll. All the flavors came through and there was no overpowering salty taste like soy sauce fillings. This is the only way to go.

These might be ok for a base after HEAVILY modifying them, but I just couldn’t make them work. I really wanted to like these but they just really aren’t worth the work. Only make them if you feel you would be happy to just take a full bunch of cilantro and take a bit out of it as is because that’s basically how this tastes.

Unfortunately, this wasn't very good.  I was expecting great results based on the reviews, but I ended up with fried chicken kabobs in wontons.  Not good and won't make again.

These are good. It makes a lot so I saved half and will steam them instead later this week for the football game. I cooked the chicken first, decreased the cilantro and ginger and omitted the lemon grass after looking for it in two different stores. Tasted great anyway.

I know that some ppl don't think that it's appropriate to review a recipe if you change it alot...but I'm still giving it 5 stars. I made these because I needed to use up some wonton wrappers, that were going to expire. It worked great, because I also had cilantro to use up. The changes I made were to use garlic salt instead of fresh (I wouldn't reccomend this because they were a little too salty), and crushed red pepper. I left out the lemon grass, ginger, chile pepper, and sesame oil. Even with so many ingredients missing, they were still very good. I doubled up the wonton wrappers on some of them, too, just so I could use them all up. Thanks!

Super delicious! I didn't have two bunches of cilantro on hand so only used one, and that was plenty. This is on the menu from here on out.

I'm surprised no one has commented on the amount of cilantro. Maybe my grocery store sells cilantro in bigger bunches but I couldn't fit even one bunch into the food processor and the flavor was overpowering with only that much. All I could taste was the ginger and cilantro. Both happen to be flavors I love but it didn't make these wontons my favorites. My kids and husband liked them.

I used cooked chicken for these and subbed about half the amount of basil for the cilantro. The flavor was fantastic, although a bit strong on garlic after you eat them for a while. I fried half and steamed the others, and most everyone preferred the fried. I ended up getting 100 wontons out of one recipe.
