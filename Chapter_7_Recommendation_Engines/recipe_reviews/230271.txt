These lasagna roll ups were quite tasty.  Two whole wheat lasagna noodles per serving is a lot, though!  Whole wheat lasagna noodles are much "heavier" than regular pasta, so beware!  In addition, I thought the calorie count was quite high.  I re-figured mine, and it was lower than the stated 637.  I used an 11 x 7 baking dish.  I used the recommended ingredients, and I found the cooking times to be accurate.

I used my own homemade sauce & a full pound of ground turkey.  This was the easiest lasagna recipe and really tasty.  I served it to guests on the first try and luckily everything turned out!

The taste deserves a five, but there was so much cheese and not any vegetables so it's not very healthy.
