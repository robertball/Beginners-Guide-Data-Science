Very tasty and we thought worth the extra effort.  A little time-consuming though.  Would probably make ahead and bake if preparing for a special occasion.

This recipe is very good and FULL of flavor...the cardamom adds a very interesting twist.  I also liked that the recipe combines two dishes which saves room on the holiday table.  Everyone at my dinner loved them.  Also, I peeled the sweet potatoes, cut them into chunks, and then boiled them so it wouldn't take as long.

I was really excited to try these potatoes but they were a little disappointing. The thyme seemed overpowering and the sweet potato portion  was flavorless. The lack of taste made them 'not worth the effort'.

I've made this dish twice - I'm so-so about it but my husband loves it. The last time I made this I had to use yams and the dish was very rich.  I'd suggest you stick with the sweet potatoes for a lighter flavor.  This dish looks great on a holiday table.

These made a beautiful presentation.  I really can't give them a fair rating because they were hidden in the other room during the Thanksgiving dinner so only a few people got to sample them.  Those who did loved them.  I got to have a little taste and what I did have was excellent.  Although next time I'll go a bit easier on the thyme.

These are awesome!  They take a little bit of work, since you have to boil and mash two sets of potatoes, but it is well worth it!

My family went nuts over these potatoes! I didn't have cardamom, so I used 1/2 tsp of a mild Chinese 5 Spice (light on the anise - didn't stand out). I also didn't have Yukon Golds, so I used regular russets and added another 1/4 C butter. We like "lumpy" mashed potatoes, so I used a masher (lightly) and didn't add the milk.  This is one of the best recipes I've tried from Allrecipes...definitely on our Top Ten list of favorites...thank you, Southern Living Magazine!!

I have made this recipe twice and both times turned out.  I didn't use the exact spices as I didn't have them on hand, so I just use salt & pepper and green onions in the white potatoes and a bit of cloves in the sweet.  Overall the reaction was good.  Will use this again and again for holiday meals

These potatoes were phenomenal!  I used only 1/2 tsp. of cardamom, which suited our tastes better.  

To lighten up the calories, I used fat-free sour cream, reduced-fat butter, and about 8 Tbsp. of evaporated fat-free milk.  No one noticed any difference.

It was well worth the extra time and effort to peel and cook two sets of potatoes.  This one's a keeper!  Thanks!

My Aunt made this for Thanksgiving about 7 years ago and it was sooooo goooood!!  Unfortunatly this year I bought my sweet potatoes from Wal-Mart and they weren't ripe yet, ruined my whole dish, needless to say I will never buy produce there again.

Made these the day before Thanksgiving and baked them the next day while the turkey was resting. (I love make-ahead dishes!). Wonderful flavor. Everyone enjoyed them and there were hardly any left over. This will be a new frequently requested mashed potato recipe in my family.

THESE ARE DELICIOUS! I did not have the cardamom, and they were still wonderful. We sliced the potatoes for a faster boiling process, and served them with salmon for a great meal. I highly recommend them!

Fabulous!  This is my family's new favorite holiday potato recipe.  It goes well with turkey, beef roast or ham, gravy or not.
