Made this recipe with a little twist.  Added Worcestershire sauce to egg batter and bread crumbs to the Parmesan mixture.  Came out amazing!

I did make a slight change.. but I do this for all my recipes which call for bread crumbs. I crush butter/garlic croutons insteadl. I have made this several times and it has always been a really big hit. I will definitely be making this again!

My hubby said out of all my pork chop recipes I have made so far, he likes this one the best! I didn't think it would taste flavorful because it just calls for parm cheese and Cajun. Holy smokes, did it pack a punch! So yummy!

I didn't have Cajun seasoning so I used Old Bay instead, I also added 1/2 tsp of white pepper. Following another suggestion I added Italian bread crumbs.

I added just a few changes and it was fabulous! I did a mixture of 1/4 cup parmesan and 1/4 cup panko. Instead of Cajun seasoning  I used Lawry's Seasoning. Nice flavor and juicy!

Very good and easy, will do this again! My man ,who is  a professional chef, ate every bite and loved it.   I added some bread crumbs and garlic powder to the parm.  Next time I will cut the red pepper in half because it was a bit overwhelming to the other flavors.  Sauteed mushrooms, onions and asparagus with fresh garlic and Yammi Sauce complimented the pork chops perfectly.

I made this with a little twist. I didn't have enough Parmesan so I made my version of shake and bake with fresh bread crumbs and mixed what parm I had with that. Everything else remained the same. This was DELICIOUS! The whole family raved!!!

These were the best pork chops I've had in a long time.  I used equal parts panko and parmesan cheese, along with the cajun seasoning, and the seasoning was perfect!   I was short on time, so I used thin pork chops and cooked them on the stove top in a cast iron pan, flipping them once.  They were done in 15 minutes.  I'll definitely be making these again.

I followed the recipe as written, but did not consider that the flavor might be too overpowering for thin chops. I ended up scraping the breading off one side just to make them edible. It was so fast and easy that I'll definitely try again, but next time I'll try it with thicker chops. If the recipe had mentioned a thickness or weight, then I must've missed it.

This recipe was wonderful! My only add was crushed garlic and butter croutons which really complimented the parmesan. Instead of adding the Cajun seasoning to the croutons and cheese, I simply sprinkled it over the chops before their egg bath. It was just the right amount of spice. This will definitely be a routine meal for our home. We loved it!

Quick, easy, and the family loved it. I did add about 1/2 cup breadcrumbs to the cheese as other reviewers suggested, it worked very well.

Made as directed and was very, very good.  We had 4 good-sized, bone-in chops, so doubled the parmesan/seasoning amount (still using only one egg) and it was just the right amount.  Maybe because of having the bone, they took about an hour to brown up nicely.  Such a simple, easy, and tasty recipe.

I'll definitely make it again - very flavorful. I baked on the middle rack of the oven and it did not brown the crust; next time I will try one rack higher.  I highly recommend it!

So easy and great way to add flavor to boneless pork chops.  Set the timer for 35 minutes and they came out perfect.  Careful not to overcook.  Served with fresh green beans and mashed rutabeggas.  Delicious.

These were tasty but way too dry.  I think they are overcooked at 40 minutes.  Next time I will decrease cooking time by 10 minutes.  My chops were very thick too.

I made this recipe without revisions.  My husband and daughter raved about it! My daughter usually hates pork chops.  It is very simple and easy to assemble with minimal mess.
Will definitely make it again.

Delicious and so easy. I don't like Cajun spice so I used Italian seasoning. I think you can season it with any flavorful combo of herbs and it would be great.  What a simple recipe! Thanks.

This was very good with the suggestions from another reviewer. I added a little bread crumb to the Parmesan mixture and Worcestershire to the egg. Super easy to make and yummy. Thanks!

It was easy and fairly convenient to do, and the taste was amazing! My wife's a pork chop fan and this is a version that I can make: I don't have to deal with a frying pan.

I was disappointed that the coating did not get crispy.  I followed the receipt as written but I don't know why the  topping didn't crisp up.  The flavor was good though and the chops were tender.

Followed recipe exactly. I resisted the urge to add breadcrumbs. OMG! The pork chops were so good. My whole family loved them and my kids are pretty picky. I never find one dish that they will both eat. Will definitely make again!

Very tasty but a little heavy on the Cajun seasoning. Might just be personal preference. Next time I'll half the Cajun seasoning and double the parm. I loved how simple it is. I paired it with mashed potatoes, spinach salad and a lovely Petit Syrah-Petit Verdot blend.

Delicious! This has become my favorite pork chop recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. The bread crumb mixture can be cut down to not waste so much of it. The chops were moist and tender. The flavor was wonderful.

I doubled the recipe and used a combination of bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. Next time, I won't double the cajun spices, though. Just a little too warm for my taste.

I added a little twist on the parm mixture as I didn't want cajun tonight. I used 1tbls of Wildtree brand smoked mozzarella tomato blend, baked in a skillet with Wildtree roasted garlic grapeseed oil.   AHHHHmazing!! Served with baked yams and fresh green beans and butternut squash risotto.  Topped the meal off with a delicious warm banana pecan  bread fresh from the oven.  definitely   will repeat this recipe, it is so easy.

Easy, tasty, and everyone in my family of 11 enjoyed them. I'll definitely be making these again. Maybe because I quadrupled the recipe, but it was just a tad salty so next time I'll use just a smidge less seasoning.

I made this recipe. Overall good. The breading on it was superb...the porkchop could taste more favorful. I will make it again and try it as some of the reviews had said about adding worchester to the egg batter.

I made the exact recipe with bone in pork chops. The only different thing I did was lower the oven to 250 after the initial 40 min at 350. 1 1/2 hrs at 250 and the pork chops were fork tender the way I like them. The taste of this simple (low carb) breaking is delicious. My husband doesn't like pork but he loved these!

Made it just like recipe stated. Very quick and easy. My son and I loved it. I definetly will be making it again. I think next time will I spread some Dijon mustard on both sides before dipping it in the egg though for a little extra umph.

I didn't have bread crumbs so I used whole wheat flour and this came out delish!  I added it to my permanent record.

I didn’t have Cajun spices so I substituted for 1 1/2 tsp of Italian herbs. It was delicious! I would definitely make it again and at some point would love to try it exactly as in the recipe.

Great recipe!  I followed the advice of a reviewer and added a dash of Worcestershire to the egg wash.  I also added a small amount of Italian seasoned bread crumbs, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper to the Parmesan.  (I didn’t use Cajun seasoning). I baked the chops as directed, then browned them under the broiler.  Thanks for a new go-to recipe!

Rubbed the chops in olive oil and brined with course salt on both sides. Seared for 3 minutes each side and let rest for 3 minutes before breading in a combination of ground butter garlic croutons and fresh ground Parmesan. Cooked a 400 for 10 minutes and 275 for 5 minutes. They were so tender and delicious definitely a keeper

I've already made this 3 times and my family and guests love them. My daughter hates mayonnaise so I don't tell her it's on the chicken, but it really keeps the chicken moist and flavorful.  This is the only cutlet recipe I will use.

I brined the pork chops for 24 hours with 2/3 of a 1/4 cup of salt, used an egg wash, and grated Parmesan cheese. It’ll be amazing, juicy, and perfectly flavored.

My whole family loved this and now want it to be a regular meal!  I did change up the recipe some.  I only had shredded parm, so in order to make it crunchier I added some french fried onion (smashed in a bag first), and for the rest of the fam I added the fried onions plus some panko bread crumbs.  I also I added garlic powder and black pepper (you don't need salt, b/t the cajun seasoning and pork itself, there's plenty of saltiness... but do not over do the cajun or it could end up too salty).  I also was worried it would end up soggy w/ the juices that run from the meat, so I put it on a sprayed pan w/ holes set over top of another pan raised up to  catch the juices.  This actually made the bottom side nice and crispy, so I servied it THAT side up... I also broiled about 3 minutes at the end, and the bottom side was STILL crispier than the top even after broiling.  I will also try this w/ chicken and other variations, it's a GREAT recipe!!  I forgot to take a pic, but it was so beautiful the way it crisped!!

Followed the recipe with additions from other reviewers - a bit of Worchester sauce in the egg wash and some bread crumbs in the cheese. Used a commercially done creole seasoning - way too salty. The pork chops were perfectly cooked. Browned under the broiler for 2-3 mins to complete the look. The recipe is wonderful. My spice mix - which I did not taste before use - was too salty. Everyone loved the pork just not the salt. I will make again using a spice recipe from here. Fantastic method for cooking pork chops. Cant wait to cook it again.

These were very easy and the flavor was good. I will definitely make them again. Mine didn’t get browned and I was concerned that I would over cook the chops. Next time I may put under the boiler the last minute.

Absurdly easy, quick, and tasty. Doesn't do anything you're not expecting it to but if you want a simple pork chop recipe you can't go wrong here.

I mean who doesn't like parmesan?

I thought the taste of this was very good. definitely use the Italian seasoned bread crumbs. It really adds to the flavor of it. The problem I seem to have was getting enough "crusting" on the pork chop. Compared to the picture on here. I Didn't have grated parmesan only shredded so I feel that's where I went wrong. I would say if you're going to try this recipe only use grated cheese. I tried chopping my shredded stuff up real good and it still didn't work. but I am definitely going to attempt again because I really liked the ease and the flavor that I did get was pretty good.

Made this twice, first time used shredded parm and it turned out pretty rough. The shredded cheese wouldn't brown, and I ended up with overcooked dry chops. The second time I used grated parm and it was awesome. I used a cajun seasoning recipe from this website and the chops had a great flavor and were moist. My wife was skeptical the second time I made them but afterward told me to keep the recipe. That's a win by my measure.

I never leave a review but this recipe is amazing! Maybe didn’t need to cook it that long because my chops were thinner but turned out amazing and I’m a terrible cook

Made for my wife.  I baked an extra 7 minutes. I will make again but will cook on 375° for 37 minutes. I did add more seasonings. Garlic salt black pepper fresh lemon juice sea salt and backed with a bay leaf on top of pork chop. All seasons I used it was 1/4 teaspoon each. For better crisp baked extra 7 minutes

My husband and I loved this!! My husband does not like spicy food so I lightly salted and peppered. I took the advice of other reviews and added crushed croutons. It’s a keeper and so simple for a week night. Thanks for sharing.

Recipe was very good with 12 thin-cut chops with this change:
I used 1/2 C. Panko, 1/2 C. Parmesan, 1 Tbsp. Zatarain's Creole Seasoning mixture. Baked on two sheet pans for 25-30 mins (depending on thickness). Delicious!!

I really enjoyed this entree. The two suggestions I would make are to use a bit more Cajun Seasoning and make sure you grate, not shred the Parmesan, otherwise there is quite a lot of moisture. Still delicious, just not as pictured.

I will definitely make this again but will bake on a rack in the roasting pan to allow the crust to crisp more. I also substituted crushed garlic croutons for bread crumbs for additional flavor.

Four personally, but hubs loved it and I loved how simple it was. Added some panko to parmesan mix and used whatever seasoning I had since I don't keep Cajun. It would be fine with anything. The biggest thing I want someone reading my review to get is that thin chops won't take very long. I did 25, but they were probably done by 20-22 minutes.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight.  It was a real hit.  I did make some adjustments to the spices, as I'm not a fan of cajun seasoning.  So in it's place I used Cavenders seasoning, garlic granules, onion granules, and pepper flakes.

I made this using butterflied chops, so I reduced the cook time by about ten minutes. I also added equal breadcrumbs to the cheese mixture as other reviewers had suggested. The chops came out moist and flavorful. Adding this recipe to my regular rotation!

This was awesome and juicy! I didn’t have Cajun seasoning so I used California Rancher’s Monterey Seafood seasoning, which is similar to old bay. It was perfect for my 9 year old who can’t handle hot spices.  My leftovers were still awesome the next day, I just covered in foil and popped it in the toaster oven. Thanks for the recipe! I will make this again, for sure!

Made this recipe as stated, the only thing I added was 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of onion powder. It was ok, definitely tasted like Parmesan cheese and could barely taste the Cajun seasoning.

Excellent!!! Tweaked recipe a bit. Mixed 1/2 parmesan & 1/2 Italian breadcrumbs, topped off each chop with jarred Portobello mushroom pieces and sealed them individually in aluminum foil. My guy was raving about them the whole meal, and even said they were "restaurant quality"!!!

Very delicious, my kids loved it. I followed the directions but I used fresh grated Parmesan. I also lined a cookie sheet with foil and laid the pork chops out. I cooked uncovered. Surprisingly they came out with a crispy crust and full of flavor. I paired it with mashed sweet potatoes and steamed broccoli

I expected the cheese on top to melt with the long time in the oven, but was surprised to see it wasn't. Didn't have cajun so I used cayenne instead and with the Parmesan it packed quite a punch!

I am making it , it's in the oven as we speak. My only issue with the recipe is as a less than experienced cook the tip about aluminum foil helping with moistness and cleanup makes no mention of where to use it,  so I just fashioned a chef's hat out of it, and my head was indeed moister and easier to clean! :-D

I add crushed garlic croutons and Cajun seasoning to the breading. I also top it with a (garlic, spinach, cream cheese, Parmesan, mozzarella, heavy cream) topping/ sauce. To die for!! I make this almost every week!

Absolutely delicious - the cheesy taste is awesome!  Maybe a little more moisture would be good - a little dry.

I have used this recipe several times. Followed directions exactly the first time and it was great. My daughter thought it was too spicy so I started cutting the Cajun seasoning in half. I’ve even used this recipe with boneless chicken breast and everyone loved it.

Like a few people, I made some variations - used my own marinade to tenderise the chops (therefore, I didn't use the eggs).  Turned out amazing - so delicious & tender! YUM!

I see the potential but season by was overpowering.  It could be the brand of Cajun seasoning but making as the recipe says way over seasoned the meat.  We ended up scrapping one side of the pork chop and a little on the other side.  I will make again and probably add the bread crumbs others have mentioned.

This is now my favorite pork chop recipe! They came out perfectly seasoned and juicy. The only thing I did differently is sprinkling a bit of Romano cheese atop each chop before baking. This is an easy to make recipe that will please the entire family!

They were ok and “forgetable” I wasn’t impressed. I like Parmesan cheese on Caesar salad, on Italian dishes, but these pork chops didn’t wow me. Not sure I will make again.

It didn't come out like the picture, but it tasted good with the parmesan and Cajun seasoning.  I did add a dash of sea salt to the ingredients. I think I will try it again sometime in the future.  For a single guy it is very easy to prepare.

Didn’t believe the recipe could be this easy. It’s not only easy but DELICIOUS!  I added cayenne pepper, and used thick cut chops. Also broiled then for 2 minutes. Will definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe. The only thing I would add to the recipe is seasoning the chicken breast before hand to give a little more flavor and also adding more bread crumbs half way through the cook time for a more crunchy texture!

This is simple and easy to make. My husband is leery of pork chops having grown up on boiled ones. He actually asked me to make them again! This is a big deal and a gold star for this recipe.

These pork chops came together quickly for an easy weeknight meal.  The parmesan paired perfectly with the pork. I browned the chops on the stove top first before finishing baking in the oven.

4.5 stars.  We liked the Parmesan flavor, and I added a bit of bread crumbs and made my own Cajun spice recipe mix from this site.

Delicious and so easy!  My only change was that I increased the oven temp to 400 for the last five or six minutes to get them brown. We will definitely be making this again.

What a great, simple recipe!!! My husband isn't a huge fan of pork chops, but he loved this recipe! I followed a suggestion of putting bread crumbs in the mix and shook it and the chops in a bag. Great idea! Will be making this again!

We made this for the first time tonight and really enjoyed it. We had 8 oz. butterfly chops that worked perfectly. Only change I made was some extra parmesan once I had it in the pan. We had this with corn bread, scalloped potatoes and green beans for a wonderful dinner

Second time I made so I knew to cut back on cooking time. In my toaster oven, even 30!minutes is too long causing chop to dry out. I would also use less Cajun seasoning. As is, that is flavor much more than Parmesan

Tasty and easy. Used thin pork chops-what I had on hand- cooked for 30 minutes and put under broiler for 5 to brown them up. Husband enjoyed them. I did add some bread crumbs to cheese.

One of my husband's favorite weeknight dinners. I actually replaced half of the parmesan with bread crumbs and added a crushed clove of garlic to the egg before dipping to make it our own.
