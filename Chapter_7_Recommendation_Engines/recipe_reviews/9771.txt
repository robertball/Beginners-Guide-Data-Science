Good cookies. I think one things people might be doing wrong is using oil? for shortening - I used butter and HELLO they were fine. I did bump the flour up to 1 cup - everything else was great. I have found that ANY COOKIE baked until the edges are golden are ALWAYS too done and end up hard. I figure when the start to firm up when you touch the tops - just like cakes - they are done. A trick a friend of mine shared with me (from her Grandmother) is when cookies get hard put them in a plastic bag with a piece of white bread. I don't know the science behind it or how they figured it out but IT WORKS! Soft cookies again. I added 1/3 c. cocoa and yummy. I got 33 cookies. Thanks for sharing.

I made these today and was a bit worried they wouldn't come out well judging by some other reviews but to my delight they turned out absolutely delicious! I read the comments and changed the ingredients accordingly using 1 tsp vanilla extract instead of 1/2 1 cup flour instead of 3/4 1/2 cup margarine instead of shortening and 1/2 cup chocolate chips instead of nuts as well as baking for 8 minutes. There didn't appear to be much batter in the bowl so I wondered how many it would actually make and it was very very moist (probably because I melted my butter). I rolled them into balls with my hands as I like to do though I made them small and widely spaced apart in case they flattened. They actually didn't flatten at all! And because I used small bits of batter to begin with I found out they puff up quite a lot so you could get more cookies if you used less batter. All up it made about 20 cookies so still not a whole lot but a decent amount. The coffee grounds give a sort of crunch to them as if I had put nuts in them and it's enjoyable. Next time I make them I'm considering dissolving the grounds in water first to see how that turns out.

I always read the reviews before tackling a recipe I made these and they were GREAT! Although I prefer butter I used margarine v. shortening for added flavor. I also used a single serving packet of Starbucks instant coffee - which I just happened to have and I think because STarbucks is normally strong coffee one packet worked (compared to 1T v. 2T.) I didn't have nuts which I think would have held the cookie together and kept it from spreading. I always double the vanilla. I also added 1/4 C flour like the other reviewer suggested. The cookie tastes great! The batch made 30 cookies. I only spooned the 1t as the recipe suggested. They spread a lot! They are thin and waferlike but like I said I think the nuts would have held it together better. 8 minutes baking time was perfect as well. I topped them off with Halloween colored sprinkles for interest. I would definitely make again! YUM!

This is an Adult cookie! It does taste like coffee but if you like coffee you will love this cookie. I added chocolate chips and they came out great. I only cooked them 8 minutes...so just check on them so they aren't "rocks". Update: My grandmother (the best cookie maker in the world) loved this cookie so much that she actually asked me for the recipe...can you believe it!

It has no flavor no nothing and is not as many servings as the recipe says it has. It's a great start to a better cookie! It's chewy but that's it...my suggestion is to expirement with it until you love the taste of the batter (even though its not healthy:) ) and then bake it...

All I have to say is that you need hot coffee to soften these puppies up. I tried this recipe and so didn't four of my friends and we all thought the same. LIKE A ROCK!

I thought that maybe they could use a bit more sugar, but even so, they were great!  My whole family loved them!

I just finished baking these & was quite disappointed. They looked like lumpy brown fried eggs! The coffee taste was too subtle as I could only get a hint of it. To the remaining dough in the bowl I added a little more flour & the cookies held their form as they baked. Next time I will also add more instant coffee. These cookies have potential but definitely need tweaking.

Im sorry to say that i didnt really like these cookies very much. They didnt taste much like i had expected them too. I added some sugar and flour so that they wouldnt be quite as flat and some chocolate chips to improve the taste. It somewhat helped and they tasted a little better.

For how few ingredients they are pretty good cookies. However I didn't have walnuts or chocolate chips but they still held together just fine. If you want your instant coffee from making too big of crunchies just pour the amount into a bowl & roll a spoon around on it until the coffee becomes more powdery. I also increased the flour & they turned out perfect. Super easy quick recipe if you don't have very much time.

I'm quite disappointed by this recipe. They taste decent but they spread out a lot during baking. The amounts seem to be off too- no way does this recipe make thirty cookies. I wound up with 14. It's a promising start- with more flour and maybe a dash of cinnamon these would be a lot better.

My boyfriend absolutely loved these cookies (with some changes of course). I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 cup cocoa. I also used 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of sugar. I also replaced the shortening with real butter. I was out of instant coffee so I just used 1 k-cup of breakfast blend coffee (the coffee in k-cups is ground up fine enough that it's not so grainy and it blends into the batter well). They kept their shape very well and didn't spread out at all. They were very brownie-like and if you let them sit a day the coffee flavor is even more noticeable. I will definitely make these again!

They turned out great I put the dough in fridge after making the first batch and noticed that after putting it in the fridge they did not flatten as much. I really liked the subtle coffee taste and walnuts. When i make it again i will cut down on the sugar by a couple of tablespoons.

Not bad I added some chocolate chips for taste and it made a nice touch. The cookies remind me a bit of pancakes though..

We added an extra spoon of sugar. Our coffee is dark roast and they come out strong like we like it. We we substituted the Walnuts for chocolate chips. Delicious!

I'm so disappointed because the reviews on this sounded so good and I wanted to like this but as one reviewer was the only one to be honest these came out looking like a burnt fried egg! I followed everything just as instructed but they just spread out everywhere and were this flat mess. I will say the flavor was very good but this needs something baking powder?? Disappointed for sure:(

I made these cookies and they were good but not REALLY good:) also they were very small and not very many so i doubled the recipe. To perfect them i added (to taste) more coffee more vanilla salt more suger cinnomen and pumkin spice. at the end while they were cooling i added a thin layer of chocolate sauce on them. They turned out FANTASTIC:) perfect for the holidays:)

I made these exactly like the recipe called for. Taste was great. But next time I will use more flour and use butter instead of shortening.
