Great bread if you are looking for keto friendly. Only thing is, it's an expensive bread to make. That said, if you are making this for the first time, I would ease into the stevia..maybe use 1/2 tablespoon to start and see what you think. A tablespoon made this too sweet for a regular type bread if that's what you are looking for and left an aftertaste ( I am very sensitive to alternative sweetners). It also, doesnt rise as much as a regular bread but the consistency and texture are really good.
