This recipe was really easy and fun to make with my 2 kids! They loved it and I loved i too because it was one way to get them eating healthier. I did only a half a cup of white sugar but it still came out good. Definitely on of my favorite sorbet recipes!

It's a nice basic recipe and while I halved the sugar, the flavor is good. The only thing I'd suggest is, after sitting in the freezer overnight, bring it out to let it thaw just a bit, (maybe 10 minutes), before serving. Mine was like very dry snow, until it melted just a bit.

Simple and delicious. I too cut the sugar by half and also added a pinch of salt. When I first tasted the mixture I was afraid the lemon would be overpowering, but once frozen it balanced nicely.

1 cup sugar is way to much! I suggest a half cup instead, but other then that this was great!

Cut back the sugar to a bit less than 1/4 cup.....was too sweet.  2nd time was perfect. And, added bonus ? No sugar crazy

Don't add extra sugar. You don't need it

Rather than adding a cup of sugar I added a half cup of honey.  It was great!

Turned out well.  My food processor worked better to puree the chunks of watermelon than the blender.

The only change I made was to put it in a container into the chest freezer, set the timer for an hour, take it out and mix it up, return it to the freezer and repeat two times, then let it freezer over night.  Turned out yummy!

Great way to use leftover watermelon.  Agree with others about the sugar.  I used 1/2 cup but will cut it down even more next time.
