Don't waste your time with this recipe.. it does not work.   For instance, if it makes 12
cookies, why buy 24 carmels? There isn't room for TWO carmels in each.
The mix as defined is not usable as described, more like a cake batter. If you add
 flour to make it firm enough to divide you end up with a result similar to cardboard.
I threw mine away. The worst thing I ever made in my kitchen...

This recipe DOES NOT WORK! It's like there is a missing step or ingredient, because there is no way that it is like dough, it's more like oat soup. I couldn't shape this or turn them into calzones at all. It was impossible. KT, I'm sorry, but they really were not good. In the end, I just plopped wet blobs of them onto a cookie sheet and put jam on top. Not good at all.

This was one of the worst recipes that I have ever made--I even tried it twice to make sure I made it right the first time.
