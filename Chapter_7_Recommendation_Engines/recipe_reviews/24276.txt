Make sure you use heavy spoons!!! I used a hodgepodge of plastic spoons SOME MELTED some held up well. I would suggest not moving them until set also. But otherwise a cute idea and the kids seem to like them as lollipops also!

Would not recommend pouring hot melted sugar onto plastic unless you want to ingest some toxins.

T used regular spoons and heavy plastic spoons some of the plastic spoons did melt when first pouring in the hot liquid. I would go with all regular spoons next time. You have to work fast to pour the hot candy because it gets stringy pretty fast.

These are easy and super fun! I used a heavy duty plastic spoon and had no issues with the spoons melting. After pouring the candy into the spoons I decorated them with with some Valentine sprinkles which the kids LOVED! I will def be making these again as I think they would make nice little gifts and the flavor possibilities areendless YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)
