Looks like a terrific recipe.  My problem is that there are never stale brownies around in our house!

I put wayyyy toooo much alcohol.... I had to use cognac instead of rum because that's what I had. It really knocked me on my .... . I guess this dessert was more difficult than I expected it to be because things just didn't seem to go right. Used powdered sugar instead of cocoa powder - it balanced out the alcohol. I will probably not make this again for a while though it was quite good. Ridiculously indulgent though.

I got addicted to these the first time I made them! I used 8oz. of Chef John's chocolate chili cookies - took from freezer & let them dry out for a couple hours after crumbling up. They tasted fantastic!  The raisins & chocolate chips really added to the flavor, and I'm craving them ever since. I'm making more now (same way) but will use brownies next time - which I will bake & dry out especially for these. (I bet any cookie or cake would work). I hope I'm not making the Chef mad - I swear I'll actually follow the recipe soon!! LOVE Chef John, his videos & recipes!!  Thank you SO much!

Made the recipe as is and had problems getting the balls to harden up enough to roll. Kept them in freezer for over 2 hours with no luck. Altered recipe to 10 oz of prepared 3 day old bownies and just a smidge less than 1/4 cup rum. Worked like a charm. Also added some orange extract to the chocolate coating to add some flare. They were gone before I coud get them on the serving plate. Very easy to make with the adjustments. Thanks Chef John!

I loved these rum balls much more than the traditional ones.  I used spiced rum as that's what I had, I did use quite a bit, closer to 1/3c rather than a 1/4c.  I agree that 4 ounces wasn't quite enough to coat them, although that could be me as I made a right mess of the coating.  The key with it is to make them about 3-4 days ahead of time so the rum has a chance to mellow out a little in taste.  The amount of rum in it seems more of an approximation, how much you use depends on how stale your brownies are, that may be why another reviewer had quite liquid ones, it should be a soft paste but not liquid at all.  Mine weren't very stale so I crumbled them up and left them uncovered in the fridge overnight which did the trick.

Very time consuming but they were alright, need to make sure you have a good consistency with the brownies I accidently over poured so that batch wasn't that great but another with Kalhua was good

I came upon this recipe while looking for a nut free rum ball.  I used stale store bought brownies and added the spiced rum a little bit at a time to the mix so I didn't have a problem with the consistency.  I found the video helpful with the rolling of the balls in the melted chocolate…they turned out very nicely and got even better with age.  I will definitely make them again.

These were great, easy to make and tasted delicious.  Again, don't overdo it with the rum as it takes some time to soak in.  I made one batch with Coruba and one with Baileys.

Excellent! I was looking for real chocolate rumballs like momma used to make, no vanilla wafers. And this is much better than momma's, but don't tell her. I used my homemade brownies, which feature 2 cups dark chocolate chips & 2 cups chopped pecans. I made them a week ahead, left em in the frig in a plastic bag, then, day of rumballing left them in a bowl to dry out. There was 14 oz of brownie-matter, mixed with 1/4 cup & an extra splash of Cap'n Morgans Spiced rum, and I let it sit for a while...by gosh, I couldn't believe the fine paste it formed. I am glad I wasn't impatient and added more before letting it sit and get pasty! It would have been too wet. I cut it with a knife and fork, stuck it in the frig for 1/2 hour and then used a melon-baller to place each "ball" on the nonstick cookie sheet. Now, it wasn't very ball shaped at THAT point, but after 20 minutes in the freezer I was able to form them easily into a ball! Since my brownies were already over-the-top with chocolate bits in them, I decided to forego the coating; also I was feeling lazy! Sorry Chef John! But MAN they were delish anyway! After they were all rumballed up, I just rolled 1/2 in cocoa and 1/2 in powdered sugar, and put them back in the freezer. The next day, I transported all 40 of them to my husband's bandgig for a holiday treat AT A BAR and ka-whooosh, they were gone just like that. From the stage, our fiddleplayer said: ARE YOU READY TO RUMBALL? I was nearly worshipped! Thanks CJ!!!

Last year, I bought a grocery store bakery brownie and just let it sit out over night, worked out fine.  What I did differently, was to add a tablespoon of Creme de Cacao (chocolate liquor) along with the rum, & I rolled them lightly in chocolate sprinkles just after the melted chocolate had set.  Took them to a Christmas party and they were quite the hit!  This year I'm making batches to add to other goodies for gifts.  If you make these right, 5 stars is what you should be rating this recipe!

My boyfriend and I are celebrating our first Christmas together and since our families will be visiting we were trying to come up with new and exciting things to serve at dinner..... At first we were thinking of making a rum cake but of course we were looking for a way to kick it up a notch! We always use recipes from this site and when we saw the video for this one we just had to test it out so it would be perfect by the 25th,we added 1/2c of rum and the paste already tastes soooo good! I will let you know how they came out soon enough!!!!

I tried the recipe as is and it wasn't bad, though boozy. Switched out the rum for 1/3 cup Bailey's and it was INCREDIBLE!

These are now an every holiday staple!  Did add a few pecans(will try walnuts next) and cinnamon.  Never do brownies without cinnamon!

WOW! These are wonderful! Made these for the holiday but first I had to leave brownies alone long enough to get somewhat dry, then I had to leave them alone until family came... I hope they enjoyed my story about how well the turned out.

These were marvelous, rich, boozy, simple, and a big hit when I made these last Christmas. I used more chocolate than the recipe called for for coating, but I'll blame that on my status as a very novice confectioner. This year I'll make them again, probably with bourbon, rather than rum, or more likely, a batch of both.

I was Christmas baking, and having yielded quite a few brownies, so I decided to make Chef John's rum balls.

They were fantastic. I like my rum balls extremely chocolatey, so I feel that this recipe far exceeds any vanilla wafer rum ball recipe.

I did not coat them in chocolate... instead, I chopped walnuts to mix throughout and sprinkled crushed walnut on top.

I absolutely love them!

I followed it exactly, the balls never got hard.  Came up with an idea to fix it and they were good.  This should have been easy, but it was a pain.

These are great. I made one mistake. I didn't have stale brownies, so I bought some.  I should have let them sit and dry out, because the fresh brownies were too moist and wouldn't accept enough rum. Had they been dry, they would have absorbed more rum. They taste great. Will make again.

Made this for the second time this year. It was a hit with everyone both times! The first time I made these I used a large scoop, but this time I used the 1" like the recipe calls for. I liked them better in the smaller proportion, the chocolate to rum brownie ratio is more enjoyable when the balls are smaller. These are definitely potent, so make sure you caution anyone you share them with, but they are oh so yummy!!

These are tasty - the chocolate coating was fantastic and the directions (esp. video) were great.  They did kind of taste like eating rum-soaked chocolate cookie dough - very moist.  I might like them a little drier/firmer.  Yummy though! I will make again.
Update: I made again because I wanted to make with brownies I had left out to dry.  I did something cool though that you might want to try (btw, my rating is for the original, non-edited recipe, this is just something different).  At the same time I made these (Christmas), I made the Sugar Coated Pecans by Carolyn.  When I made this batch again, I had some pecans left over and decided to chop some up really fine and add to the batter.  Holy Cow!  This was amazing.  It helped the batter be not so dry and also gave it an amazing crunchy flavor enhancement.  Yummy!

These are really simple and tasty, although the steps take some time. I tried one batch with kahlua and another with rum - personally I like the kahlua better. 4 oz of chocolate to coat was plenty for me, but I'm probably making mine too big - I only get about 15 balls out of the recipe.

Sinfully rich!  So good!  I used a 9 x 9 inch pan of stale Gluten Free brownies (Betty Crocker)... A 1/4 of which had already been eaten (Oops).  I crumbled the brownies in a food processor and added a little more than 1/4C Rum... they were strong, but for the better!  Four ounces of dark chocolate was not enough to coat these.  I had some semi sweet chocolate chips on hand that I used to coat the remaining.  Husband loved these... taking the rest to our family Christmases.

So, I wanted to make something for a baking contest at work. I am a beginner baker, so i wanted something as easy as possible. These rum balls involved no baking, and they tasted awesome! The only thing i will say, is im not sure if maybe i didnt do something right, but when i took them out of the fridge to roll, they stuck to my hands!!  These things were incredibly sticky!! I tried rolling them different ways, but i eventually ended up just dunking them in the melted chocolate as is. i didnt get the prefectly round balls as in the picture (more like piles of poo..) but, they tasted delicious!! =P
