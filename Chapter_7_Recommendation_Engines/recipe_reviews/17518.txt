A pretty good pumpkin pie. This one uses regular evaporated milk and it is still sweet enough so you don't need to add sugar to the filling. I only gave it 4 stars because its just a basic recipe. I made my own crust, and that is really half of the pumpkin pie experience. Prep and cook times were accurate and I was very satisfied with the result.

This recipe was simple and the finished product was perfect. This is exactly what I was looking for, and probably won't try any other!

This is the first time that I'm trying to make pumpkin pie..I live in Trinidad, West Indies and this is a strange dish here.  I tried it but 1 tsp each of the cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger.  My family was a bit hesitant to try the dish but now they're begging me for more!!! It was great.  I made my own crust out of honey brand crackers..it was what I had on the spur of the moment.  I would try this recipe again.

A good simple recipe. We prefer the sweeter and creamier version made with condensed milk but this was tasty. We seriously upped the spices, made a double mixture and baked it in a deep dish pie shell for 15 minutes on 200 degrees C and 150 for about an hour and it set like a dream. I had good feedback from workmates, one said she really liked it because it wasn't too sweet. I used a fresh Buttercup pumpkin.

YUM!!!  This is a GREAT pumpkin pie.  I don't know why the others didn't like it as much.

The pie wasn't as flavorful as the pies you get in the store. This is my first homebaked pumpkin pie and I'll probably make it again just with a little more spice.

Very to simple to make. Thanks to Mrs. Nye and her 3rd grade class for submitting a very easy, basic recipe.  My 9 year old daughter measured and mixed this up in no time and without any difficulty.  Thx....Oh, and it's very good!

It's quick, easy, and no frills.  It's also a leaner pie because it's a basic recipe.  I am trying to eat less sugar and reduced the sugar by one-half--it was just barely sweet but still good.  I could taste the pumpkin's natural savory/sweet flavor.

reads like the classic pumpkin pie recipe from the evaporated milk can and there is none better.   without having to make it because I have already made it a million times - big thumbs up!  Only thing that makes it milder is pumpkin you baked and made at home but great any way.

This recipe was just fantastic! Instead of using plain white sugar I used splenda. The pie came out delicious and my family can't wait until I make it again.

I made this pie and followed the directions to the T. It was much to bland, I think if you substitute sweetened condensed milk in stead of evaporated milk and add about 1/4 cup sugar it would probably be fine.
