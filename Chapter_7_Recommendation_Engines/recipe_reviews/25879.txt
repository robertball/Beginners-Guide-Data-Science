I was looking for another way for us to enjoy shrimp and I am so glad that I came across this recipe.  This is amazing.  Since I didn't have individual ramakins I used a very small casserole dish and made this for 2 people.  The only thing I might do differently next time is add a bit of garlic.  This was wonderful, thank you Doreen.

I sauted diced onions and sliced mushrooms in the melted butter before adding the flour, etc.  I also didn't have garlic croutons, and substituted bread crumbs seasoned with some garlic and herb mix.  My husband and his friends loved this.  Tasty and easy.

This has become a favorite with me and my husband. It's so rich and comforting. The flavor of the sherry really adds a lot (I use a dry cocktail sherry).

This recipe is absolutely delicious! My family and guests loved it. I cooked it in a casserole dish and served with baked potatoes and vegetables - it was a big hit.

Good. Very rich, as expected. I did not have cream so used 2 percent milk and increased flour to 1/3 c and butter to 3 1/2 T. Also, I used uncooked shrimp and cooked the whole thing in a 1.5 quart casserole for 30 min. Thickens as it cools. Came out about the consistency of thick gravy. Husband rarely comments about my cooking but instantly did. Kids (just about to be 2 and 4) ate it but pretty much just ate the shrimp out of it because they love shrimp. Would be great over pasta.

I didn't have enough shrimp so I made up the difference with cod and peppered catfish which worked really well. Like another reviewer, I added sauteed onion and mushrooms. I also added chopped parsley to the fish mix for flavour, and used a little more paprika to give it a bit of "kick." This is an easy to prepare, flavoursome and healthy meal. Thanks!

The other reviews are right, this recipe is delicious! Making due with the ingredients I had on hand, here's what I did.  I used imitation crab, scallops and shrimp because I didn't have enough without adding in the scallops. I didn't have sherry so I used 1 Tbsp dry vermouth. I doubled the paprika and added 1/4 tsp salt and am glad I did. Used whipping cream, which is just lighter than heavy cream. Two things to know about this recipe: 1 - the recipe is very liquidy before you cook it. See my before and after photos. It starts out like a chowder but the liquid is completely absorbed while cooking, so don't be afraid to add the full amount of the cream in. 2- this makes 4 small servings, not anywhere near 6. But it is VERY rich so you don't need more than this for 4. Pair it with light sides like a fruity green salad and bread or it will be too much. You could also use this as an appetizer for 4-6 by serving in a bowl with a slice of bread. Too chunky to use as a dip. BTW, the 4 Tbsp of butter on top aren't really necessary if you want to save the calories. So good! Thanks DorrenB!

I thought this recipe was excellent. I used shrimp and scallops and followed recipe, except I added extra cream and cheese. I served with baked pot and ceasar salad. BIG HIT!

Very yummy!  I had extra crabmeat and used this recipe for a weeknight casserole.  To make it lower fat, I used 1 1/2C skim milk and 1/2C of heavy cream.  Not as big a hit with my husband--he wants me to try it with soy milk next time around (believe it or not!)

This recipe was truly wonderful! It took no time to prepare and was so delicious. I will try adding bay scallops as well next time for more variety. This is a keeper for future seafood dinner parties.

Excellent.  Although a little too thick. Sized the recipe for two of us and had to add about 1/2c milk to thin it a bit.  It was absolutely delicious though, as my husband commented 3 times while eating. I will make it again although next time I'll increase the amount of liquid at the start and I'll use 10% cream rather than the heavier cream, or even mix in some regular 2% milk.  A reduction of fat is never bad.

SOOO good. This was a hit at my mother-in law's birthday dinner. The used fresh shrimp instead of cooked because I was  afraid the shrimp would get over cooked. The fresh shrimp came out perfect. It is an awesome dish if you don't mind the fat content. I am going to try to lighten it up next time. Enjoy it on special occasions.

Quick, easy and delicious!  I followed this recipe except I added in some pre-cooked mussles.  Next time I would add in some vegetable broth to thin out the sauce and maybe dice up some veggies and add a touch of garlic.  I would give this a 4.5 if I could!

Wonderful ! Very rich, used egg noodles and spooned it over. Definite company dish, almost everything can be done ahead pop in the oven, and "viola !!" I, too, added a few shakes of Old Bay, and a can of Portebella mushrooms (drained)...yummy ! A KEEPER ! Nice job.

My husband and I love this recipe.  It was easy to prepare and is so good and elegant looking, it is great for either just the two of us or company.  It was just as good the next day too.

A friends 10 year old is very picky, but he LOVES this recipe.  He requests it frequently.

I have made this recipe quite a few times and it is scrumptious.  I make this for my sons b-day each year at his request!  The only change I've ever made was to use dungenesse crab meat.

My husband loved this. I thought it was okay. I used mocked crab and bay scallops only. I also didn't have sherry so I used white wine.

This dish has become a favorite for hosting friends for dinner. It really is a treat. It was my first recipe with sherry and I love the flavor it gives seafood. I found a way to make it into soup but substituting milk for the cream and omitting the crumb topping. YUM!

We love this recipe. The only thing that I changed was to put crushed Ritz crackers on top instead of the garlic croutons and added a little bit of Old Bay. It is now a frequent request by several family members

This dish is absolutely amazing. I made it with rice and put in more garlic than suggested. It tasted great.

I fixed this for Mother's Day along with a chicken dish from this site.  It turned out okay.  I was expecting something a little thicker.  Maybe more cheese would have done the trick.  I wasn't crazy about it, but my husband and dad loved it.

Just wanted to say "Thanks" to the person who sent this recipe in.  My 12 y/o daughter cooked this for a 4-H seafood contest tonight.  Just substituting all shrimp.  There were 10 dishes in her category and she took first place.  The bad thing was that they ate almost all of it, so there wasn't hardly any to take home.  LOL!!  So now she gets to go to District competition.  She has competed for 4 years now and this is her first time going to District.  Thanks for helping her get there.

Pround 4-H Mom,
Cynthia

I have been making this recipe for around 8 years now. It is absolutely delicious every time. My husband loves it. I have even used different seafood combinations, such as scallops and shrimp and scallops and crab meat. It has been great every time. I don't measure the sherry; I just pour some in; you can't get too much.

Excellent dish!  Took suggestions of others and chopped up some onions and softened them while in the butter while it was melting.  I used light cream and didn't add the extra butter on top.  Served it with crunchy bread and some steamed broccoli.

This was pretty good, but extremely rich!  I made it with just shrimp, and added black pepper and some panko crumbs to the crouton topping.  I used one medium casserole dish, and this was very easy to put together.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for two in a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish.  This is a delicious, easy and elegant meal!

Very good.  I substituted bread crumbs for croutons and added parsley, parmesan cheese.  I also added a few garlic cloves and shallots.  I will make this again.  Easy to make, but tastes very rich in flavor.

This is so easy and so delicious.  For a buffet style meal, I doubled the recipe and baked in an oval flat-bottomed casserole dish and served with angel hair pasta. My guests raved!
