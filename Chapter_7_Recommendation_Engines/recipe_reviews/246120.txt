Accidentally forgot carrots so substituted strips of sweet potato (not bad!).  Would have given it a 5 star if it didn't have so much ginger.  We'd take a bit with ginger and it was rather overpowering ('course I should have minced it better).  I will be making it again... The Instant Pot if fab!

Cooked it in my crockpot instead of pressure cooker. Of course this took longer, but the flavors were delicious!

Good soup! Great way to use the pressure cooker too. I put the sweet potato and carrot in there with the split peas. Will make again!

Delicious! I will try adding some cubed ham next time. I didn't have a pressure cooker so I simmered the peas for about 40 minutes. I added 1/2 teaspoon of paprika while cooking.
