If I could give this 10 stars I would.  Made this and everyone Loved it, no leftovers!  
I put hash brown potatoes on the bottom of the 9 x 13 pan and then I doubled the recipe.   In addition to the bacon, I chopped up  an entire package of Canadian Bacon  (For men the more meat the better), also added a package of mushrooms and topped off with  extra cheese.  Covered with foil and Baked on 350 for 45 minutes.    
Everyone came back for a second helping.  :-)
This is a very easy recipe and I will definitely make it again.

I had some leftover philly cheesesteak filling that I added to this egg bake. That negated the green onion or red pepper. Because I am doing a Pantry Challenge, I happened to be out of "fresh" bacon so I used a partial bag of real bacon bits I had in my fridge. I also used up some leftover evaporated milk that I had in the fridge instead of regular milk. I made no other changes. After this came out of the oven, I served it with sour cream/homemade salsa on top and made it more filling with baked hashbrowns and buttered whole wheat toast. NO leftovers. I would make this again. Very tasty.

This was a nice brunch, and definitely something different for my family. I swapped out the green onion from some red onion(1/4 cup) and added a big handful of chopped mushrooms as well. Both which i sauteed quickly before adding to egg mixture. I also decided to fry the bacon up first(i used 9 slices)to render out the fat.Seems odd to me to add the bacon in just as is. I chose to bake mine in a 9inch pie plate, and it took a total of 33 minutes. Will be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!

Using the pan size indicated, the dish is way too thin. If I were to make this again (I won't), I would use a smaller square pan and bake longer. Also, the bacon in this dish is gross. I'm not a fan of limp bacon pieces that have only been warmed 20-25 min. But, now I know. Definitely NOT going in the recipe binder.

Made this yesterday for breakfast with the in-laws,  it was a hit.  I cooked the bacon first to reduce some of the fat,  beat the eggs before adding the rest of the ingredients,  and added some fresh mushrooms.  The guys had seconds. I increased the quantities of everything and I'm glad I did,  I don't think it would have been enough.  I have a little left over, but that's better than not having enough. This could easily be prepared the night before and baked in the morning.  It would also be good for a quick and easy dinner.

Brunch, 11 guys with leftovers. I used 24 eggs, 1lb sharp cheddar, 1 red, 1 green pepper, 10 slices sandwich bread, 1 cup milk, 2 tsp garlic and 1-1/2 lb bacon. Baked in large stainless pan for 40 mins. Everybody liked it.

Winner! Winner! I have tried so many breakfast casseroles that I was beginning to believe that I would never find one that I really liked.  The only things I did differently was to use a chopped bagel in place of the bread and add 1/4 tsp. of dry mustard.  I baked in a pie plate and love it! Plus it was sooooo easy.

This was good!  Here's what I did:  toasted the bread first, used regular onion, canadian bacon (which was lovely-not greasy and good flavor) and green pepper.  I baked it in a 8 x 12 pan for 25 minutes and let it rest for 5.  I will make this again!  Better than I anticipated :)

GOOD EASY HANDY.  This was good. It takes no time to put  together. Not exceptional maybe,  but quite good. I used my
8/11  dish ,,I think 9/13 would be to big. I used 7 eggs, whole wheat bread,  pre-cooked bacon and added a few red pepper flakes with salt and pepper. I will defenetly make again.

I made this with some alterations suggested from previous reviews and it was great! I put shredded frozen hash bowns on the bottom and used 10 medium sized eggs. I also added some extra milk and cheese. I cut up the bacon and fried it a bit and sautéed the onions and peppers.  I didn't want flabby greasy bacon and I wanted to take some of the crunch out of the veggies.  I cooked it for 45 minutes in a 9x13 pan (covered) and broiled it a few minutes so the middle was set.  A bit of extra work, but it was worth it in the end.

This is a good base recipe that you can throw pretty much any veggies (or cold  meat) in your fridge. I didn't have a bread, so used 2/3 cup of breadcrumbs instead, worked fine. I agree with some reviewer that serving this with sour cream on top would be wonderful :) Also I used 8x11 casserole dish (didn't have enough portion for 9x13 perhaps because I didn't use a real bread?), and served with mini-salad and fruits together with 1/6 cut portion of egg casserole.  Winner breakfast/brunch recipe!!

This Egg Casserole was pretty good when I followed the original recipe, but the next time I made it....these were my changes:  I cooked the bacon until it was crispy,  blotting off the grease.  I then lightly sautéed the garlic, green onions, and a few sliced Baby Bella mushrooms,  before adding everything into the egg mixture.  Also, instead of using regular soft bread, I threw in a good handful of those large (seasoned) salad croutons, which added a bit crunch, and even more flavor to this casserole.  Everyone loved it this way.

I really liked this, and DH who swore he didnt like these casseroles- I made him try it anyways-and he loved it :) subbed bacon with cooked sausage , ~1/2 roll, added 2 more eggs,  I liked it. needs a little something, mine a little heavy on the sausage flavor,but maybe more cheddar? I used shredded mex mix cheese. i used  1clove fresh garlic, and cooked some of green onion with sausage first . next time i think ill use yellow onion and cheddar shreds. I topped with fresh chopped tomatoes. sour cream would have been good too. maybe hash browns on bottom next as well. tysm for good quick recipe. its so adaptable! cooked 30 min 360 in 8" glass pie plate. cooked perfectly, brown edges, topped with little cheese last minute.

I sauteed a clove of minced garlic with the onion in olive oil, left out the green pepper,cooked the bacon, used mozzarella and served it with salsa, it was fabulous.

I thought it was good...not super.  I made it as stated except added more chopped red pepper since the one I had was small and there wasn't enough to save and I hate throwing food out.  My biggest concern or issue was the bacon still seemed raw.  Maybe next time I'll try cooking the bacon first, then add to the egg mixture.  I'll also adjust the pan size to make it in a 9x9 and probably increase the cooking time a bit since my family likes a thicker casserole.

I thought this recipe would be simple, and in essence it is. But I decided to use a deeper round pan, rather than the 9X13 and it was a big mistake. It took over an hour to cook. We added leftover prime rib, tomatoes, potatoes, mushrooms, and spinach to the mix and colby jack instead of cheddar.
Things I would do differently next time: bigger pan, cooking potatoes first, and using more eggs for this many mixins.

Truly delicious flavor...however, it's rather flat in shape even though I baked it in a smaller pan.  Also, I precooked the bacon and drained the fat before adding to the mixture.  I would make it again due to its ease of preparation and flavor A+.....presentation gets a B!!

Followed the recipe exactly.  One thing I would change is cook the bacon first before baking.  Not sure if I missed that in the recipe, but the bacon was soggy. Otherwise, it was good and I would make it again.

This was delicious!   I used Tomato, Basil, Mozzarella Chicken sausage instead of bacon -- easier than frying bacon today.  Used whole wheat bread, and skipped the red peppers because not everyone in my family likes them.
Doubled the recipe so I would have leftovers so I cooked it for about 45 min. until the middle was cooked.  Really easy and very good!!

Clarification: Cook bacon fully first, then break up into pieces and put in the casserole.  Recommend using thick bacon and doubling up bacon for the recipe.  Otherwise the bacon pieces are too small and there are too few to taste.

I didn't have bacon so substituted cooked sausage, about 1/2 a roll. And used traditional round casserole dish and baked for 30 mins. Delish. Mushrooms would have been a good addition too.

The only thing I changed was that once I chopped the bacon I fried and drained it before baking it.  I didn't want all the grease in the dish.

pretty much doubled this recipe, used some smoked gouda with the cheddar, used (already fried) bacon and browned sausage and added fresh mushrooms that I cooked with the sausage. no peppers. baked about 40 min? in a 9x13 pan. This is truly a great recipe that can be used with whatever you have on hand. definitely recommend!

Like the title says , super easy to make . However I didn't fancy the partially cooked bacon. I suggest pan frying the bacon with the onions before putting it in with the other ingredients!

It was good in my opinion on it is you can change it however you want to make it fit your palate I personally I think that you should cook the bacon and add real potatoes to it and then it will taste amazing.

Excellent quick recipe with easily found ingredients. It is flavorful; the cheese is not overpowering in flavor which pleases my cheese-hating husband.

I normally exactly follow recipes the fist time I make them but i had no bell peppers, & it still tasted quite good.

I will make this again. I followed some other peoples suggestions like toasting the bread first and cooking the bacon first. I also added Serrano peppers and some hot sauce to the eggs. It was delicious

I'd make this again with just a couple of small "changes." I'd use a smaller, maybe 8 X 8 pan, the 9 X 13 makes this much to thin for our tastes. Second I think I'd cook the bacon till crisp and crumble into the eggs. I and the family like our bacon crisp and the bacon was just not cooked enough for us. May even try bacon bits instead of the bacon.
Other than these two changes we enjoyed this as a breakfast for the holidays.

As others suggested, I toasted the bread first, added more bacon (almost a full pound package) and used a regular onion, both of which I fried first.  I increased the eggs to 7 and added a bit more milk to accommodate for the extra bacon.  It might just have been the most unappealing mixture I've ever poured into a casserole dish!!  And it still seemed too dry so I beat one more egg with a bit of milk and added it. (So a total of 8 eggs and about a quarter cup of milk total).  I also sprinkled a bit more cheese on top.  Surprisingly, and in spite of the way it looked before baking, this turned out wonderful!  It was very delicious and baked up nicely (exactly as according to the time on the recipe).  There were no leftovers!  It's a very flavorful breakfast casserole not like some (and I've tried a ton of them).  Will definitely make this again!

Lined the bottom of the dish with hash browns and baked them a bit before adding the other ingredients. Doubled recipe and used a full red pepper. Used real bacon bits instead of raw bacon. Turned out great with these modifications. Fed 3 adults and 2 kids with very little leftover.

Anytime the men in my house eat it and go back for seconds is a 5star in my books.   I'd add a few more eggs and cheese.  And I used leftover Italian sausage instead ( chopped) as I was using up leftovers.

I decreased the recipe for just my husband and I and it still made a lot.  I added some cajun spice because we like spicy food.  I cooked the bacon first after reading some reviews and the bacon turned out really good.  I baked in a smaller oval dish and had to add 10 minutes to the cook time to make sure it was done.  All in all - very tasty.

Simple. Great taste. I would use a pie plate or an 8x8 next time as it was very thin.  I would like it a bit fluffier. I used pre cooked bacon and it turned out good.
Definitely added to the rotation.

I gave this 5 stars because it was so easy (we thought the taste was good - okay it isn't gourmet, but still delish). I followed the other cook who toasted the bread first and I also used Canadian bacon, after all I am Canadian, eh and trying to cook a bit healthier too! If I used real bacon I would probably cook it first as well? I cooked it in a pie pan so it was deeper, just took another 10 minutes or so. Thank you for sharing.

Family liked this.  I used 7 eggs.   Sauteed thinly sliced neuremburg sausages, chopped red/yellow/orange peppers and chopped shallots.  I did add chopped garlic to the egg mixture.  Used a little extra cheese.  (Basically was using up leftovers).   7 X 9 glass dish was just right, made 6 servings.  I think the pan size in the recipe would be way too big.   To double, I would use two 7 X 9 pans  or 8 X 8 pans otherwise bottom and sides would get too brown in my oven.  Loved that I whipped this up in under 10 minutes, baked in 25 min and it was just as good, if not better than my egg casserole recipe that has to sit overnight.

Changed to a smaller pan size, so it need to be cooked longer. I also  used both bacon and ham. I will make it again and switch some ingredients  maybe add broccoli or spinach.

Recipe for 4+ people, loaded with flavor & health! 
In addition to this original recipe, I made some changes. 10 eggs
1/2 c almond milk
chopped diced bacon already cooked in a bagmuenster cheese (the kind that is meant for sandwiches).  I used 4 slices and piled them on top of each other & diced them into tiny pieces. I didn't have shredded cheese.  

I also added:
3/4 c mushrooms, diced
1/2 c spinach, chopped1/2 small yellow onion3 turkey breast slices, (meant for sandwiches), diced into pieces a tad bit bigger. 

I used a 9 X 13 pan, used olive oil on the bottom & baked it for 40 minutes.  I then added tomatoes on top with a sprinkle of paprika.

I doubled this recipe and made it for a large group. Turned out very well but I left it cook a bit more like 40 minutes because I wasn't happy with how runny the center was after just 25 minutes. The next time that I make it I am going to cut down on the bacon and the cheese a bit, and I think I will cook the bacon a little bit before mixing it in so it has a nicer texture. But the recipe is for a "super easy" egg casserole and it definitely is that. Everyone at the brunch liked it too. There were no leftovers.

I baked it in a pie plate as someone else suggested and it was the perfect size.  I let it bake for 30 min.  I used a bagel and cut it up into small pieces and it worked well.  Next, time I will try it with bacon.  I didn't have any on hand.  I made it for dinner and my kids loved it.

Like others, I think this is a good, base recipe.  I should have gone with a smaller pan size (versus the suggested 9x13), and think the cheese can be easily doubled for a richer flavor and texture. The hint of garlic gave it that extra touch which was nice.  May be faster if you have pre-cooked bacon, sausage or any other meat.

I put this in an 8x8 because it seemed that the 9x12 would be to big still didn't take the time suggested. I boosted the temp up to 400. Other than that I put in some turkey slices instead of bacon

the dish is amazing but it took me a little longer to cook because, the inside wasn't cooking along with the outside. I had to keep it in the oven for a little longer id sy 15-20 extra minutes.

Used a pie plate and cooked longer like other reviewers. Added extra bacon and substituted 1/2 a small Vidalia onion for the green onions. Did not use garlic due to an oversight. Easy and delicious! My book club thought it was tasty, too!

Very good...and the name fits it...so super easy to make !!!  Instead of bacon I used ham and since I didn't have the green onions...I used a regular onion and it came out great !!  Thank you for sharing.

Very easy! I used dry onions instead of red pepper since I was out. The bacon I used was cooked the morning before.  My whole family loved it!

Awesome recipe! Followed recipe as is, Substituted the bacon for meatless sausage & Baked for 25 minutes. We also added some extra cheese along with crushed up spicy doritos crumbled on top & baked for the last 2-5 minutes & This bake came out delicious! Even leftovers this morning were incredible. Saving this recipe to make again in the future! :)

I made it for a brunch for a women’s potluck meeting and they loved it and none was left. I followed the suggestions of another review and doubled the recipe and added hash browns and Canadian bacon. I also used Hawaiian rolls instead of white bread. I made it the night before and baked it in the morning  covered with aluminum foil for 45minutes.

My casserole looked better than this one but, unfortunately, it did not taste as good as it looked. This dish was too salty and the consistency of the eggs was grainy instead of fluffy.  Cheese, bell pepper, onions, milk and black pepper amounts seemed right. Ham was a good substitute for bacon which can be rubbery when baked. Not sure why recipe has bread; 2 slices were too much and made for a weird, grainy texture. I did not use the optional garlic; it would not have improved this dish. I had to increase temp & cooking time; after 20 min at 350°, the dish was watery and hardly gelled so I increased temp to 400° and cooked dish for another 15 minutes. This worked - BUT then my lower oven temp might be off (although it worked well for 2-hour roast pork the other day). The recipe’s 9x13 pan size would have been too big for this small amount of ingredients (it would have produced a big pancake). I used an oval 7”x 9 ½” casserole dish and increased to 8 eggs  and added one more T. milk. This seemed right. My cooked casserole was ¾” to 1” tall, which was still a little flatter than I would have liked. A bigger pan would have made it lower. I let it rest 10-15 min before serving.

I made something very similar to this using the cook times and temp accept I precook most of the ingredients accept for the eggs and cheese , I took frozen sausages and skinned the milk then sliced them into what looked like pepperoni sized only thicker pieces  cooked them until about half cooked added yellow pepper and my pre-boiled potatoes cooking until the peppers begain to soften them added. Mushrooms and onions and garlic cooked for 5-7 mins tills the garlic smell was in the air . Removed from the pan into a 12x6 casserole dish cooked for 15 mins then added cheese cooked for 15mins more on 375

I made it my own by using a pasilla pepper (I don’t like the flavor of bell peppers), bacon crumbles from Costco, and I left out the garlic because I had to go to work afterwards. I didn’t have white bread, so I cubed some mini Thomas’ bagels. Sounds crazy, but the bagels were a great substitute bc they gave it another texture. I doubled the recipe and added 2 extra eggs. It was thicker than shown in the video, which was nice. It just took a little longer to fully cook the middle. Delicious & a great way to feed a crowd!

Made as the recipe stated with minor equal adjustments. Didn’t have green onions so I used 1/4 white onion, didn’t have red pepper, so I used a green one, and added a pinch of shredded fresh spinach. Turned out delicious except very small. Next time I’ll double the recipe or use a smaller pan. I was making it as a last minute item for a get-together, but it’s sooooo small.

Easy recipe but does take some time chopping, grating etc. Made huge batch for 13 adults and one child. 30 eggs, 1 cup milk, 2 cups diced ham, 1 cup old cheddar, 8 chopped green onions, one full clove minced garlic, 1.5 sweet bell peppers, 4 italian herb panini buns diced. Made two large pans in about 40 mins at 350. Brunchers raved. Well worth the effort.
Sorry, 1 pound cheddar, also only a little more than one pan was eaten but we also had hashbrowns, bacon and french toast as sides.

Just starting out learning to cook and this was really nice to make! Had a pan that was a little too big, so used double the bacon so I guess it worked out! Going to try different fillings and see what happens!

Made this for a group recently and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I doubled the recipe but it was still pretty thin in a 9x13 pan.  Next time I will triple the recipe.  Changes made:  cooked the bacon,  added sauteed mushrooms, garlic, dry mustard plus extra cheese at the last minute.   Best breakfast casserole I've ever made!

This is similar to another recipe that you make in a crock pot. In any case, it's delicious. I make a big batch on Sundays, put it in the fridge,  and bring a cup full to work with me each day for my breakfast. The scallion onions and red pepper give a bit of kick. I don't use real eggs but the liquid eggs that don't have any cholesterol. Two thumbs up!!

I read all the complaints about the bacon being soft, and need to tell you why.  The recipe calls for bacon, but does not specify which kind. The video states Canadian bacon,  that is ham for  USA folks. Try ham, sausage, hamburger meat, or veggies and cheeses, and you will make this a family favorite.

This is fast and delicious!  I didn't have green onions, so I microwaved white onions with the red pepper and a little grass-fed butter. I also didn't have bacon, so I used prociutto, so I cut the salt a little.  I also used whole grain bread...yum! It is really good. I have  tried a lot of egg casserole dishes, and this is one of my favorites!

This is a great recipe for feeding a big group, and tastes wonderful... For low carbs leave out the bread and cook on top of the stove... makes a great scramble.

Easy and delish.  Subbed 24 frozen tater tots for 2 slices of bread and it worked.  Baked it 5 more minutes.

Pan size is wrong... unless you want it 1/2 inch thick. I prefer it thicker so a smaller pan.  I also prefer to sauté my veggies prior to baking.  Bacon needs to be pre-cooked (not stated in recipe).

I had a group of 12 over after church. Made two pans - one with crumbled breakfast sausage and one with chopped ham steak. Everyone LOVED it! I served it with sour cream and salsa on the side, fresh fruit and small danishes! Easy and delicious. :)

I really liked it! I did alter it a bit. I was looking for a little healthier so I swapped out milk and used almond milk. I have quite a few people in the house so I did 10 eggs, 1/2 a red bell and 1/2 a green pepper. I put a thin layer of hashbrowns on the bottom and used a pound of uncured bacon. Cut up most and laid 4 pieces on top. It was excellent and a hit!

Used ham and forgot the garlic; used regular onion instead of green onion.  Added shredded hashbrowns layer on bottom and an extra egg.  Took about an hour in a 9 X 9 pan.  Fantastic and very versatile.

This was very easy and very good. The only changes I made, was to cook the bacon a little first,  added 1 small jalapeño and added parmigiano reggiano to the top. This is a good basic recipe that any one can modify to their liking. Also used gluten free bread.

the only thing I did differently was that I did not put any bacon in it...but it still tasted great!!

So far, really simple to make.  I took out the onion (I'm deathly allergic to onion) and put sausage in instead of Bacon (out of bacon in my house, crime).  It's in the oven cooking and I hope is taste as wonderful as it smells.

Love this recipe. I used leftover garlic bread by accident once and loved the flavor it added.  If I don’t have bell peppers I used mild green chilies.  Super easy.

I made with a layer of hash browns on the bottom.  As others suggested, I precooked the bacon and that worked well, but  I thought this recipe was very bland and not one I will make again.

I made this dish and made a few changes as I did not have any cheese.  I added feta and Parmesan cheese and mushrooms. I used precooked bacon so it was well cooked.

Simply delicious made it for supper!

Even though it doesn't say to do so I cooked the bacon first. I always assume that if a recipe asks for bacon it's cooked bacon. Another review stated that the casserole was gross because the bacon didn't cook all the way. I can only imagine it would be pretty gross with half cooked bacon and all that undrained grease. With the precooked bacon I think the recipe is delicious and easy. Also, I've used ham and that's just as good. Thanks.

Don't use a 9x13. I don't know what they're thinking. I used a 9x9 and it was the perfect size. I did have to bake it for 35 minutes that way. I subbed turkey bacon for regular and used half a bag of thawed diced green peppers instead of red.

Not sure if I would make it again. 
I used a regular square casserole dish instead of the 9x13 it called for and  it was still very thin. Also I used a chopped yellow onion. I don't care for green onions.  I cooked the bacon crispy then chopped it. If I make again- I would do more bacon or use sausage instead of /or also with the  bacon. My family was like "yeah it was ok".

I adjusted the servings for 10. Then I added one more egg. A package of frozen spinach. A red & a yellow pepper for color.1 whole garlic bulb & regular onions instead of the green ones.I also used Nonni's seasoned croutons (Costco) & soaked them first in half of the whipped eggs & lined the bottom of dish. First I cut the bacon slices into 2" pieces & sauteed those in the broiler pan under the broiler . This was a great idea.  I then sauteed the onions, garlic, peppers & spinach in a little of the bacon drippings. After this, I continued with the recipie as outlined. I did cover the 9 x 13" dish with foil for the first 20mins & then uncovered it for another 20mins to finish cooking. It turned out delicious. I strongly recommend cooking the bacon first.

After having read ALL of the reviews, I so modified the recipe that it was no longer "the recipe." I cooked the bacon and used part of the rendered fat to lightly sauté the vegetables. Next I took the suggestions of other people to decrease the volume of cheese to egg ratio to make the final dish fluffier. I used half of the cheese in the in the egg mix and the other half as a topping before baking.  Half of the cooked bacon went into the egg mix and the other half was garnished over the nearly fully cooked dish and returned to the oven for the last 5 minutes of baking.  So 5 stars for the inspiration and 3 stars to the dish as originally posted. Thanks so much for your submission, it has served to make a delicious meal....with modifications.

In these recipes, please tell us if the bacon should be raw or cooked....  I didn't want to put RAW bacon into this recipe, so I sauteed it with a little white onion before putting into the mixture.   Sorry, but I was disappointed the the finished product.  I do love most of the recipes I've tried from Allrecipes!

Everyone loved this dish.  I added more milk to the recipe, about 1/8 cup. omitted the red pepper, because I didn't have any.  I also used ham instead of bacon.  I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.

made basically as written.  Used whole wheat bread, grated sharp cheddar, and turkey bacon, plus added a dash of smoky paprika.  Baked in a pie plate which was the perfect size.  The whole thing was gobbled up.  Very good.

4 stars with the changes I made to it and will be 5 stars next time. 1st I'm wondering if the recipe called for raw or cooked bacon? I used precooked. Instead of bread I used leftover homestyle potatoes, cream instead of milk, basically adjusted everything to how I thought it should be in my own way. I do that with every recipe. I too used a smaller baking dish but was prepared for the longer baking time after reading the reviews. I also used sharp cheddar, green bell pepper and sweet red onion which were all sauteed until translucent.

This is an easy base recipe. I used it with my own changes. I followed others advise and used 7 eggs and poured it into a 9" pie pan. Plus I added shredded Parmesan cheese on the top and baked it 35 minutes. Turned out great. I will definitely make it again.

I do not like the reviews that note so many changes to the original, so only noting this to show the versatility to the basic. I was in a rush for a weekend breakfast, so only used what I had in the refrig. Leftover sausage balls in place of the bland bread, baby ham chunks in place of bacon. My husband and I dislike bell peppers and onions, so used squash and fresh spinach. Added ground red pepper for the spice along with garlic, salt and black pepper. YUM and fast. Leftover great as well.

Very good recipe that lends itself to adding and subtracting, depending on what you have taste for and what´s in the fridge. 

I added mushrooms to mine and next time I will throw in some jalapenos.

Yummy! I made some changes though. I added diced potatoes. Par-boiled them for about 10 minutes before adding to the mixture. I didn't have green pinion so I used red and green bell peppers, adding a couple diced mushroom, and since I didnt have bacon, but leftover ham from the holidays- I added diced ham. Turned out great, but it needed to cook a little longer than 30minutes. I cooked for 45 mins on 350. Poke the mixture to make sure all the egg is cooked on the inside.

Our large family enjoyed this breakfast at our cabin on a cold New Years weekend. I used 9 eggs and 1/2 cup of  milk because I substituted dry stuffing mix for the bread. Also used Spam instead of bacon. (When you're at the cabin,  you use ingredients on hand!)

This is probably the basis for a good recipe, but made as stated here, it is too flat and not enough to properly fill a 9x13 pan. I'd suggest using a smaller pan or doubling the recipe. Maybe a couple more eggs and a little less bread.

sounded a little crazy at first with the bread. But thought I would give it a try.  So glad I did.  Very light, moist and tasty.  Added baby spinach to it.

I made this recipe for a Sunday brunch.  Very easy to prepare and for the most part tasty.  I do not like soft limp bacon.  Next time I make this I will pre cook bacon.  This will reduce the amount of grease as well.

Nothing spectacular about this recipe--just easy to throw together and modify to cut in half  for a small portion or throw in ingredients you have on hand so will hold on to it because of those reasons.

My family loved this recipe with a few minor adjustments. The volume of ingredients doesn't really fill a 9x13 baking dish, so I used a much smaller 8x8 glass dish to bake it in.  I cooked the bacon before mixing it into the casserole, since I really don't like chewy bacon, and I sauteed the onions beforehand since we have some folks who are sensitive to raw onions. This made just enough to feed four adults, recommend doubling the recipe to feed more folks.

We loved it. I added breakfast sausage. I will also probably pre-cook the bacon next time. We are thinking of adding salsa to it next time we make it.

I'm low carb so I left out the bread and used heavy cream instead of milk. Very good. I love just cutting S square and popping it in microwave in the morning. Lasted 5 days. 5th as good as first.

Increased eggs to 7, added 1/2 cup cooked loose spicey sausage, cooked the bacon about 3/4 doneness in the oven. Bumped up garlic to a very large clove.  Changed out green onion for 1/2 cup sauteed white onion. Added 1/4 tsp dry mustard. Used artisan sour dough bread which I staled in a 250 degree over for 20 minutes. Used a 9 1/2 " deep dish pie plate, cobered with foil for 35 minutes, removed the foil and cooked for an additional 10 minutes.   This was our Christmas Day brunch along with fried potatoes and mimosas. Many thanks for this great recipe and ideas from other reviewers.

The taste of the final product was fine, but I had to change a few things so it only gets 3 stats. . The recipe doesn't mention that you should, but I precooked the bacon so it would be crispy and give the casserole some texture. I also had to switch to a 6"x9" pan with this amount of ingredients, it wouldn't even spread across a 9"x13" pan. In the 6"x9" dish though, it was perfect, over 1" thick and a nice look.

This was EASY and GOOD!  I used ham, tomato, cayenne, and parsley instead of bacon, pepper, and garlic.
Look forward to trying this again with bacon...very good!!

4 stars only because I couldn't fathom putting raw bacon in this and the pan size seemed unrealistic for what was going in it. I doubled the recipe.  Cut  then cooked bacon in my cast iron skillet.  Scooped out cooked bacon drained extra grease. I mixed it all and put it back into the cast iron skillet. Cooked about 30 minutes at 350. Didn't put peppers in, thought I had one but did not. Also used leftover Italian bread only because I didn't want it to go to waste. Got 8 pie slices.  With 5 of us eating only 1slice left. It was very good and I think next time I may try a "pizza" style with pepperoni,  onions and peppers and maybe fresh mushrooms. Its a very good base to add your own style and flavors and make your own. Will make again.

The dish size was to large , so the second time I made it in a dish half the size. I also par boiled a potato in exchange of the bread. I cooked the bacon halfway to crispy before adding it. I also added an extra green onion. This is a great recipe to play with , make it your own. I'm going to try sausage next time.

it was nice and simple.  I added eggs to it and the next time I make it, I will add some meat and probably green chilies.  It is a very good basic recipe to start with. It is pretty good with just the basic recipe alos.

I followed the advice of another rather and made it in a smaller pan which was a mistake. It tasted great but was too thick so I had to spread out the middle and cook it longer. Since it was the day after Thanksgiving I used left over ham instead of bacon...mmmm

Easy and yummy.  Followed per directions except I added chopped tomatoes and regular onions.   It was wonderful.  Next time I'll add mushrooms.   Would be great wth a small amount of cooked ground beef.  Great recipes to play with.   Will definitely do this again and again.   Try with a dollop of sour cream on top!

Quick and easy. Used a mix of green, red and yellow bell peppers because I had them.  Substituted some leftover Thanksgiving ham for the bacon.  Eggs seems small so I added two additional.  As some suggested, served with sour cream.  It was pretty thin so I would suggest a little smaller pan.  My husband thought it would have been better without the garlic.  That said, four adults ate 80% right out of the oven and husband ate the leftovers the next morning and said it was better day two.  Passed the ultimate test of nothing left to throw away!

I definitely would make it again but in a smaller size dish e.g. 9x9 & bake longer.  I usually follow recipes as written and make notes re changes if the recipe is worthy of trying again.   This time, however,  I felt  there would be too much fat from the uncooked bacon so I reduced the amount to 4 slices and cut most of the fat off before adding to the mixture.

9 x 13" pan is too large for the small quantity which I'd say feeds 4. I precooked the vegetables (regular onion and green pepper), added the bacon I cooked yesterday, and garlic. Not a hit!

I made it as written, minus the garlic since I'm not a  huge fan, and loved it!  Easy to swap out ingredients to clean out your pantry.  The red pepper was a nice,  sweet addition but I might try jalapeño peppers next time for a spicy  twist!

Fried the bacon first.  Did not want all of the grease in it.  It was delicious!
Next time,  I will use a smaller baking dish.  13x9 made it too thin.

Only made it once, but can't change the entry.  I thought this egg dish was too hard/tough, so next time I will reduce the amount of cheese and hopefully the texture will be softer, or bake for a shorter amount of time so that it won't be so dry.  I pre-cooked the bacon to render off some of the fat and make it crispier.  I may do a variation and use ham instead of bacon, and add onion for a Western style.

This was a spare of the moment breakfast and it was fast and very tasty.  I didn't have any green onions but did have some asparagus, so added that instead.  I really liked the fact that I didn't have to put it together the night before and leave it in the refrigerator.
I thought of adding some cooked potatoes that I had, but decided not to this time.  I think they would be a good addition for another time.
I only made half the quantity for the two of us,  was plenty.I would definitely make this again

Substituted ham for bacon, vidalia  for green onion and did half green pepper/half red pepper because that's what I had on hand. Also added a couple of dashes of tobasco sauce for some zip and omitted the garlic because the combination of garlic and eggs did not appeal. Wish I had sauted the peppers and onion first because they still had too much crunch. Overall I'd rate the dish a 4 with the changes I made.
