I've made this many times and I just love it.  I use extra yogurt but that's the only change....I just add two containers and use a premimum brand.  I love the blackberry especially.  It's not too sweet and needs no icing...a real winner in my book!!

3 Modifications :  

1) 1.5x the recipe (12 servings but used 2 eggs instead of 1.5)... and I got 12 muffins with good size tops... 

2) Used white sugar because I thought the fruit-yogurt flavor was rather delicate for brown sugar... 

3) After half-filling the muffin tins I placed a small bit of raspberry jam (about 1/2 teaspoon each) and then covered the jam with batter, making sure the sides of top batter touched the batter below so as to prevent the jam from leaking out to the muffin tin body... which will burn during baking... 

350 degree oven for 30 minutes... Got the perfect muffin shape with high tops and shoulders... 

Very tender and fluffy inside... the white sugar gave it a soft white colour and I think it looks more delicate in addition to tasting so... 

The crust was golden and not too thick... The little jam "surprise" was good as the muffin was not too sweet... Some leaked throup the top... the colour contrast against the soft white inside was also very pretty... 

Overall, a great way to impart subtle flavour to muffins... as well as an easy way to make never-tough muffins... 

Will definitely make again... Highly recommended !!

I used one more egg and white sugar instead of brown and got the moist yummy cake that the submitter mentions. If you're looking for a more fruity taste, a few teaspoons of jam may help.

I was excited to make this cake but did not turn out what I expected. The cake turned out crumbly, a little dry and heavy, maybe an extra egg and cake flour also white sugar instead of dark.

WOW. It is wonderful!!! I follow other users suggestions (use two eggs, regular sugar and 1 3/4 cup of yogurt). It is amazingly good. I did not have the vanilla extract but I used vanilla flavor Yogurt! Left in the oven for about 40-45 minutes. I recommend this recipe.

This is a very good, easy cake.  I used others ideas and added an extra 4oz of yogurt, an extra egg and it was very, very moist!I only had plain yogurt so I added 1/2 cup chocolate syrup for flavor.  Yumm

This is a wonderful cake indeed!!!!  Easy and I used wild berry fat free, sugar free yogurt!  Did only have to cook in my oven for 35 minutes.  Will be making again and trying different flavours of yogurt.  Also cut back on sugar and used crystalized cane sugar.  Highly recommend trying this cake!!!  My husband loved it also.

This is a good recipe.  I used cherry yogurt(Dannon blend),  though it is a very subtle flavor within the cake.  Brown throughout (which I expected w/ the brown sugar) and not very pretty as cakes go.  I did mix up some milk, vanilla and powdered sugar to drizzle over the top.  Next time I may try to find a stronger flavored yogurt to use.  Very enjoyable.  I may make again to use for my daughter's first birthday cake, as she really enjoyed this first one I made!

This cake was so moist, fluffy and unbelievable tasty. I added an extra egg (as suggested by other reviewers) and an extra dollop of yogurt. I made it with apricot yogurt and added an extra 2 tablespoons of apricot jam. I also baked it in 2 2lb loaf tins. On one cake i drizzled an icing sugar mix (icing sugar, drop of lemon juice and a bit o water) and on the other i spread a bit of apricot jam (the minute it came from the oven) - Delicious!!! On another occasion I made it with choc chip yogurt - there was no need for icing - Beautiful!!

This is a solid 4-star recipe. I needed to get rid of 4 kid yogurts that were going to expire. I added one egg, extra vanilla extract, and put 1 1/4 cup yogurt. The cake was delicious -moist and very tasty, however, a bit bland. My husband loved it though...

I was looking for a dessert to use up yogurt.  I made this not knowing if it would turn out, but it did! The fist time I made it with strawberry yogurt. Mine only took about 40 min. to cook. I made it again and put cooked apples in cinnamon and sugar with it. This worked great! Thank you.

Delish, though made in a muffin tin, they have the density and texture of a muffin. Made mine with fat free vanilla yogurt, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown, 2 eggs.

I loved this recipe with a few adjustments. I used 1/2 cup of unsweet apple sauce instead of butter ( I am a health nut) Used 2/3 cup of white sugar not brown, 2 egg whites and 1 and a half cups of zero fat free yogurt. I used vanilla, strawberry, raspberry, and field berry. End result was amazing! My family really liked it as well and they are not the best of eaters lmao. One tip if u decide to use applesauce keep an eye on the cake as the middle doesnt cook as fast so half way through the baking I covered the cake with foil. It took longer  for the cake to bake but boy was it moist and yummy!

I liked this recipe! I had the idea to try making a peach cupcake and wanted to use some greek yogurt that I had in the fridge... I ended up using plain greek yogurt, and making peach reduction using brown sugar, butter and diced peaches... then I folded the peaches into the batter, poured it into baking cups and it took about 25 minutes to bake. Then I used store bought creamy white frosting, and added lots of cinnamon and a bit of brown sugar for my topping! 
They came out great even though I was worried they would be dense due to the batter feeling a bit like a dough!

I followed the suggestions of others and used two eggs. I also used three six-ounce yogurt cups, which brought out more fruit flavor (two dark cherry and one blueberry pomegranate). I made an orange/lime glaze to top it off. It turned out better than expected. Thanks for sharing!

This cake was very moist and yummy. I also made cupcakes out of it. The only thing I was disappointed about was I used raspberry yogurt and you could barely taste it in the finished product. I think it might help with the cupcakes to put a spoonful of jam in the center before baking. I will try this next time to kick up the fruit flavor. Overall very easy and tasty though. Thanks!

My son insisted on a blueberry cake for his birthday and I was happy to find this recipe.  It tasted very good, although it wasn't very blue in color.  Everyone at the party loved it!

Read the reviews, followed advice to use 2 eggs, white sugar and more yogurt.  Frosted with a powdered sugar, milk and a drop of fresh squeezed lemon, a light drizzle and some little sugar sprinkles.  Easy to make, didn't even use the electric mixer.  Moist and delicious.  Used 2 six oz containers of Chobani cherry Greek yogurt.  Will make it again, family loved it.  I would put less baking soda, just because I could detect it.

Loved it!  I added two 6oz cups of non-fat plain yogurt and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.  This cake was very moist and not bland at all (some users said it was bland).  I will definitely make again!

This is a wonderful low-sugar cake, however I found the consistency to be more like sweet bread rather than a moist cake. Be careful not to burn or toughen the outside of the cake! Overall, delicious.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I suggest adding more yogurt than called for, or more fruit that goes with the yogurt you chose.  It is nice and moist and everyone wanted the recipe!

Very moist and very delicious!  I used a flavored yogurt, and while you couldn't taste a distinct flavor, it was delicious!  I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I served with fresh berries & cool whip!
This one will be made again!

I left out the vanilla and used mixed spice instead. Also, a little extra yogurt (an extra quarter cup) to get the right consistency.
Delicious!
May try with fruit yogurt next time.

Mine got done in 30-35 mins, so maybe 50 mins would have been too much but great simple cake.

To make this a little healthier I used 1/4 cup butter & 1/4 cup applesauce instead of 1/2 cup butter. Also, only used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 1 cup. This cake was good, but won't make again.

made this for the first time. It wasn't bad, very saddle taste. I used two eggs and white sugar like someone else mentioned. Also used strawberry banana yogurt. Flavor was super light, but the cake was very moist. Will make this again. I would love to try different flavors.

I made this using blackberry and pineapple-coconut yogurts and made muffins. The texture of the muffin was nice, but I am not sure if I liked the subtle fruity flavor, it was different. It was a good way to use the yogurt before it expired though. I froze these and will send them with my boyfriend since he loves fruity flavored stuff. I think I will keep this recipe and keep trying different flavors to find one that works for me. I felt like something was missing, maybe frosting since it is supposed to be a cake?

I had the same crumbly feel to it the first time I threw it together, so I reduced the flour by 1/2 cup and increased the yogurt by 1/4 cup for the second try. It worked perfectly. I recommend Lowfat Raspberry yogurt since the flavor is not overwhelming but is definitely present.

Deliciously moist. I used blueberry Kefir, which is a little more liquidy than regular yogurt, but it turned out fine. The aroma of the blueberry took on the apartment - smelled SO good. I made cupckes for easy transport. Everyone who had one thought it was yummy.

Simple to make. I only baked mine for about 30 minutes and it was finished. Tasted more like sweet bread than a cake, but delicious none-the-less.

You know, this was OK in that it was very moist and dense.  I like that.  But I used vanilla yogurt and there was really no flavor to it.  To be fair, I'm going to try it again with another flavor of yogurt.  I used 1 1/2 cups of yogurt, but I think it may actually need 2 cups.

This was a "what can I make with the leftover yogurt"... and it turned out so much nicer than I expected. It was delicious! The first time I make a recipe, I always make as stated (with the exception to changing the flour for gluten free blend) and then tweak if necessary. I don't think any changes were called for on this one and I'll definitely make again

I am still undecided if I liked it or not.  Yes it was easy to make because you are basically throwing ingredients into a bowl, but I have never made a cake that had the consistency of cookie dough. You know batter that is made up of those little balls that fly all over when you are trying to miss it together with an electric mixer, especially when the bowl is too shallow.
In some of the other reviews they call for adding jam--which I did by the tablespoon full and in my normal fashion of baking I threw in a little bit of this and a little bit of that to make it a Unique cake.  
It is currently in the oven baking and fingers crossed it doesn't end up being hard like a rock.  Oh and I also added two eggs and used honey for the sweetner instead of brown or white sugar and used salted butter.  Basically because that is what we had in the house.

Slightly unfair review, but I got rid of the plain yogurt.  :)  I wanted chocolate so added 1/4c cocoa & 1t chocolate extract - & 1/4t almond extract.   I used white sugar & added an additional egg, but I had 1 1/2c plain yogurt & used it all.  :o  Welll, this reminded me of devil dogs without the filling.  Moist, but strangely dry, too.

Well....I think this cake will sit here the whole week. It was not good. I can't understand people saying how it was so moist, and flavorful. It was somewhat dry but the killer was it was  so bland and I used two containers of black cherry yogurt! I ended up having to put an icing glaze on it to try to save it. 

Reviews should tell you something when people say they added jam or whatever. If it was flavorful to begin with you wouldn't need to add other additions to it.
I won't make it again.

Followed reviewers' suggestions and added an egg and used 1 3/4 cups yoghurt.  Baked about 40 min in a Bundt pan.  Turned out really well - really great with fruit.  Will make it again.

I was looking for a good recipe to use up some yogurt I had.  I wanted to make cup cakes for a girl at work. So I made this with light brown sugar, 1 egg and 12 onces of Yoplait: Simplait Peach Flavor. Cook the cup cakes at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  So moist and good.  For the frosting I use 6 oz of cool whip and mixed it with 1 cup vanilla frosting.  So smooth and creamy.

This was a great cake. I added an extra egg and used 3 containers of yogurt- boysenberry, blackberry and raspberry. It turned out REALLY well, but only baked a little under 40 minutes. 50 would have been way too long.

I baked this cake and it was a very easy recipe, it came together quickly, and the end product was moist and delicious.  I did substitute white sugar for the brown, but I think it would still be good if you used brown sugar - perhaps just a bit denser.  This is a recipe you could easily play around with by adding fruit blended into the yogurt or using different flavors of yogurt.  I just used regular vanilla.  I think next time I will try it with some cinnamon added.

I followed another reviewer's suggestions and used all white sugar rather than brown. I baked muffins rather than a cake, and added a bit of raspberry jelly in between two scoops of the batter to create a fruit layer in the muffin. Unfortunately, the fruit sank to the bottom, but provided a sweet suprise in every bite! I would make it again, but am not in a hurry.

Taking the advice of other raters I made some changes to the recipe. I used 3/4c white and 1/4c brown sugar, and 1c vanilla yogurt. However, the cake was still bland. I dont't know if I'll even bother trying to tweek the recipe.
