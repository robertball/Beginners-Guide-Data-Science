This was an awesome base for a gluten free and dairy free recipe. Didn't have rice, so used buckwheat. Substituted almond milk. Also added cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg to taste, as well as one egg. Next time will add baked apple chunks. Excited to play around with this recipe.

I just made this recipe for the first time and it turned out pretty well. We are new to gluten-free and I was craving a baked good of some sort. This definitely helped my craving! I substituted almond milk in place of cows and agave for the sugar. I added a pinch of salt, cinnamon and vanilla. The texture is still very different from regular pancakes, but I was able to get used to it after a couple of bites. Thanks for the recipe.

Update: When I made this the second time, I mixed the ingredients slightly different and the outcome was a very fluffy pancake! I used the same substitutions as stated above, but made these changes: heated my skillet first, mixed dry and wet ingredients separately then added the wet ingredients on top of the dry, only mixed about 10 times with a whisk til it was just barely combined, then immediately scooped onto my skillet. This texture was more like regular pancakes than when I tried to mix it with the electric mixer.

I can't wait for my 16 month old to try these.  I made the recipe to a t.  I just ate one without butter or syrup and loved the flavor and texture.  I didn't notice the grainy texture that I sometimes get with rice flour recipes.  I made the recipe into "cookie size" rounds and I think these are going to be our little girl's version of a cookie when she can't eat what we are having.  Great recipe!  What a relief to have something for our gluten and egg free kiddo.

wow! these aree amazing!!  i used brown rice flour [thats all i had in the kitchen],9 and added 1/2 a beaten egg for fluffiness.  otherwise i followed the rest to a tee, and these are the BEST pancakes ive eaten!!  i think the sweetness of the rice flour makes it.

hmmm.. well this recipe didn't go over very well with my family. But since so many other people did like it I thought I could help with the bland taste. I added vanilla and cinnamon to it since it had rice, it tasted very good just not what we were were looking for. Good luck.

I am sorry but just did not work out for me. The batter was a lot and it thickened up substantially.

They were pretty awesome. I didn't have rice flour so I used normal flour and they turned out great. Kind of bland though so I experimented with lots of random spices. Cajun or oregano were the best oddly enough. I made small ones which made great appetizers. Lots of fun, thanks!

We have no food allergies, so we make these with normal wheat flour. But this is a really tasty way to use up rice from dinner the night before. Plus, we are always running out of eggs, so it's a great breakfast option that uses stuff we normally have on hand.

Since my children were small we have always taken the leftover white rice and used it for the next morning breakfast by adding milk, butter, sugar and raisins, our personal version of rice pudding. I don't have food allergies but I am always looking for healthy recipes to try and this one has been added to the list, my grandson loves pancakes so I will try this the next weekend he's over.

These are surprisingly easy to make if you have leftover rice. These work better with overcooked (but not burnt!) rice. They hold together better. I made rice pancakes before with another recipe and it called for the rice to be mashed. I also remember reading about a "mouthwatering" recipe which included lemon juice, cinnamon, and vanilla- I included these this time and they turned out delicious. I have Celiac, but didn't have rice flour so I instead used instant mashed potato flakes. They turned out between a pancake and a hash brown- and were still good! I excluded the baking powder and instead of the vegetable oil used 0live oil- it's healthier. I will definitely make these again! Thank you Jamie!

Thanks so much Jamie for sharing your unique recipes for allergies. My daughter is in the same boat and we have been playing with recipes for years.  Yours turn out great!  I didn't have any rice for this one so I substituted with half the amount of tapioca flour/starch instead. They are the fluffiest non wheat, eggless pancake we have tried!

I have several food sensitivities but have a horrible sweet tooth. This recipe is a nice weekend treat for me. My husband also enjoys it even though he can have classic pancakes if he wanted :) 

I did modify it slightly, I took advice from a fellow reviewer, tcronin, and added 1 fluffed egg, I also added vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, omitted the applesauce and used almond milk.

I would recommend this to anyone but I think you need to add some spices for that true "pancake" flavor.

We didn't care for these.  DH said we might have had bad rice flour, so we might try them again.  The flavor just did nothing for us!

Two out of three kids didn't eat it, and they have not been picky with the gluten free foods that I feed them. Maybe if the rice was warm (I used leftover in the fridge) and it was put in a food processor, it would have turned out ok?  The hand mixer did nothing to break up the rice. It turned out chewy and bland. I added more sugar and cinnamon to help, but it was the worst pancakes that I've ever made.

HO MY GOOOOD ..... WONDERFUL DELICIOUS FOOD

In my family we are allergic to wheat, gluten, nuts, lactose, eggs, fishs and shrimp, and we dont eat meat because it is a carcinogene of class A if i remember properly and it causes IBS , high blood pre, among millions of other things. 

THis receipe is as flufy as an angel cloud above. 

But I did the receipe my way. 
I put the cooked rice, the rice flour, a litle bit of baking soda and a teaspoon or table spoon of sugar and half a spoon of salt. HOOOOOO MY GOODNESS. and i fried it all in a pan,     Finally I am going to be able to add back some weight, because I am at 108 lbs for 5.6 and I would like to get my buttocks back. I surely will with that DELICIOUS receipe. THank you a million. BEST OF LOVE to you.

Success!!! This recipe was soooo easy, can't believe I haven't thought of it as a mum of kids with multiple food allergies! I used egg replacement instead of applesauce due to an allergy, other than that, worked like a charm, thank you for sharing this??

Ok. Just made these. They are amazing. I followed advice from previous person and mixed wet ingredients separate from dry and then combined them just by stirring just until combined. So yummy.

This was a nice alternative for when I was out of eggs. However, it was very bland. I added cinnamon but either should have added more or included something else, like nutmeg or vanilla. My fussy husband was not a fan, and it was a very heavy pancake. I do suggest frying it in butter, because the part of the batch I did with butter instead of Pam tasted better.
