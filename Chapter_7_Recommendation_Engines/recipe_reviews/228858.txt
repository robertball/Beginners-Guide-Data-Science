Hubby gives this 5 stars. I concur.  I worked all day and needed a quick dinner. This was the dish that filled that bill. 
I did dust the chops with flour, I had a couple more chops, so I added some drIed onion and swapped out the sherry for a little bit of chicken broth. Added some extra milk and thinned it out with a little water. I served it with some mashed potatoes that had some kale thrown in for color. Quick n delicious!  Thanks Mizzlex. Keeper:):)

This was a simple and quick recipe but my family loved the results.  Of course I let them continue to think I had been slaving over the dinner all afternoon :-)  I used thick boneless chops so did have to increase the cook time, also added extra half cup of milk to make more sauce and a fair amount of black pepper

My family loved this.  I cooked in the slow cooker all day and used reduced fat cream of celery as it was all I had.  I was pleasantly surprised how awesome this came out.

Simple and quick.  I substituted Worstershire sauce for the Sherry and we served it with rice.  It was delicious and I would definitely make this again soon!

Simplicity at its finest, my family loved it. I also added roasted potatoes and green beans as sides, to make a wonderful easy to make and tasty meal that had my family giving rave reviews, mostly comments of " you can make this again" needless to say NO left overs!

I had some chops in the fridge, a small amount of time and wanted some think different. This recipe was so fast, easy and delicious! I was a bit wary if the mushroom soup because we are fans of it but it was amazing. My daughter ate every bite. The sauce was great over potatoes & carrots. I didn't have any sherry and used a few splashes of worcestershire sauce. I used reduced salt onion & mushroom soup.

I made this tonight.  After reading all the reviews I used one can of golden mushroom soup, 1/2 cup milk, sherry and only 1 TBLSP of the beefy onion soup mix that I had in the pantry.  Was not too salty at all.  Perfect.  Will make again and think I might use chicken next time.  Pork chops I had were thick and were done but I thought a bit tough.  Served with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Great recipe.

The sauce for these chops was divine. Such a simple dish comes out quite delicious. I did add a small container of fresh mushrooms to the sauce while it simmered.

Yummy! Only thing I changed was I coated the pork chops in flour and  browned them with chopped fresh onions. Turned out really good. Yes I will make again.

Quick and tasty trumps too salty any time.  Better Homes and Gardens suggests simmering the salty gravy with a cut up potato.  I’ll try that next time and make extra to serve over noodles.  The recipe was also easy to size down for one.  Thanks MizzLex.

Easy, quick comfort food. Added some pepper, mustard powder, and some flour to thicken the sauce to a gravy (kept the chops warm on the side).

Served with mashed potatoes and French green beans.

The onion soup taste didn't come through as much as I had hoped but the dish was super salty, even with reduced sodium mushroom soup. I'm going to try it again. It wasn't bad but it didn't blow my socks off either.

Love this recipe! Super easy to make and very delicious. I used boneless pork chop s and added 1 cup of milk. I also skipped the wine and added some chicken broth. We had it with rice and steamed broccoli.  I will definitely make it again.

Very good, quick and easy recipe. I usually salt and pepper my chops before browning, but if you do it will be too salty. I would recommend a low sodium condensed mushroom soup if you can find one as it is a fairly salty dish if you add all the onion soup mix and a regular mushroom soup.

Rave reviews from the family on this one. Didn't have cream of anything soup, found a substitute recipe, worked great. 
Saved the leftover gravy for some leftover chicken,  should be great with that as well.

I followed this recipe to the letter. It is way too salty with the cream soup and the dry onion soup. I won't make it again but if you do try using 1/4 or 1/2 the dry soup mix. This is the first Allrecipe that has seriously disappointed me.

Really good! Made with plain white rice and steamed veggies.  I agree with some of the others who think this is on the salty side.  I will definitely make again but will either look for low sodium soup packet or cut the amount I add in half and add more milk with maybe flour to thicken if necessary.  Thank you for adding an extra pork chop recipe to my list!  Chops can be so boring!

Easy does it!  My oh my was this simple to throw together. Nice week day meal with little effort & ready in under a half hour.  Served with baked potato and corn. Will make over and over again. Thanks for submitting.  UPDATE:  I've made this twice now, & used a full packet of onion soup mix but would stick with 1/2 - kinda salty (especially for my toddler). Overall I love the simplicity of this dish & this time since I was out of cream of mushroom, I subbed  cream of potato.  Still good, & I think you could sub cream-of- whatever- you- have- in- the- cabinet.

Love it,  I never have the dry onion soup mix, so I'll usually just add granulated onion. Still delicious, quick and easy!

Great flavor, tender chops, easy to make. I tasted the sauce before cooking and it seemed very salty, so I doubled the sauce recipe except for the onion soup mix. I served it over rice with a side of broccoli. It's a keeper!

I loved it. I grilled half an onion with it also. Left out the soup mix to cut back on saltiness and added carrots. Kinda like a stew, sooo good

Quick and easy! I used boneless pork chops, and I increased the milk to 3/4 cup and added a couple teaspoons of Worcestershire. Great for something different to do with pork chops. I'll definitely be making this one again.

Quick and easy, just what I was looking for. I used a can of milk and the sauce was kinda salty for me. Maybe next time I will half the sauce recipe and add more milk. Will definately make again.

This was VERY salty. I would reduce the quantity of soup mix and try to find a low sodium version if I make this again.

This was fantastic!  Easy, low maintenance meal I served with instant mashed potatoes and a vegetable.  Perfect for a quick meal at the end of a long workday. I didn't have sherry, so I just skipped it. We sure didn't miss it!
