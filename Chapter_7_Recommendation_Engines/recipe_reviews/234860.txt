This was so good! Such since alternative to traditional lasagna. I even messed up a bit with the quantities and it was still great.

Good as vegetarian or with sausage. I made the cream sauce with butter, flour, milk, nutmeg, salt & pepper (not cornstarch). Omitted honey & ginger.

In the middle of making this, I swore I never would again. Too many pans, too much prep, my timing was all off. After I took the first bite, I took it all back. So delicious and fresh-tasting and I Iove the sweetness of the sauce and squash combined with the mushrooms and parm cheese.  Like another reviewer, I couldn't fit the last layer before the cheese, but it didn't matter. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly aside from using fresh spinach and dried sage. It was amazing!

This was pretty good, but I did prepare it differently from the instructions. First, I forgot to add mushrooms, so I didn't have any in mine. Second, I simply cut up the butternut squash into half moons and sauteed them on the stovetop until soft alongside some onions. Third, I only used about 3 cups of unsweetened almond milk and 1 cup of Greek yogurt, alongside 3 tbsps of flour in place of corn starch---this still gave me plenty of sauce for the lasagna. Lastly, I used fresh spinach and just rinsed and drained it, and added it all in a single layer over the first layer of noodles. It worked out pretty well and made for a nice lasagna. Oh, I left out the honey too--didn't think it was necessary at all. I would make it again, and definitely put mushrooms in next time!

This is so worth the effort. It smells so good and then delivers. I made this vegan for my daughter and doubted it's success because I really don't like many of the vegan substitutes, but I was wrong.  I used half  reduced sugar vanilla almond milk and half nondairy creamer for the milk (and then omitted honey), mozzarella shreds (P$$t brand by Kroger or GOVEGGIE cheesy bliss are good, some are awful), and homemade vegan parmesan "cheese" for the original (recipe follows), which gave it a nutty taste. I also added a few "sausage" crumbles to sub for the sage that I did not have. Rubbed sage is so strong and my crumbles have a sage flavor.  I misread the instructions and mixed the spinach and mushroom fillings into one, but it was fine. It  just meant one thicker layer and one thinner and totally unnoticeable. I also left squash chunky for texture. So Good!  Will definitely make again.
Vegan Parmesan "cheese" topping:
3/4 c raw cashews,
3 Tbs nutritional yeast flakes (NOT brewers yeast),
3/4 tsp salt,
1/4 tsp garlic powder.
Process all until resembles grated parmesan. Stores in refrigerator for weeks.

This was SO GOOD!  It was a bit of effort to make too often. Next time I will make two and freeze one. It was a hit with our vegetarian and meat lovers alike

This was really good! I sliced the squash thin and cooked it on the stove to save cooking time, and did not mash it. We liked the additional texture. I also cut the honey in half but left everything else the same. A lot of steps and components so itâ€™s easier with two in the kitchen, but worth it!

It took quite a lot of time but it was very good and family at the Fall Fest event I prepared it for loved it, so I will definitely make again.  I added two items:  one sweet potato with the butternut squash layers and 1/2 red pepper to add some additional color.  I made it as a double recipe in a very large pan and baked for an hour because it had been refrigerated and it was huge. . . and REALLY heavy!

I did not like the sweetness.  The butternut squash was sweet, which I did not expect.  The honey could've been left out, too.

Found a similar recipe in a cooking magazine, but couldn't remember which magazine. Awesome and different kind of recipe as far as lasagnas go. Only changes I made were that I sliced and roasted the squash instead of pureeing it. And I added a small amount of browned grounded turkey sausage. Love this recipe!!!

Very good. Will make it again. I omitted honey. I will go with a little more ginger, and even a smidge more nutmeg next time. -I was light on the nutmeg, b/c I've found it can take over if too much is used.
Great vegetarian option for something different with butternut squash!

So good! But make sure you have a deep dish. I didn't have enough room for the final layer in mine.

Amazing! I left out the spinach to make it a bit more kid friendly.
