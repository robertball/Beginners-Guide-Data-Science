OMG These are delicious!  I changed a few minor things for health & allergy reasons. Substituted Coconut Oil for the vegetable oil, used Chia Seeds & Hemp Seeds instead of Flax Seeds because I only had the ground Flax. Used Peppita Seeds instead of sesame seeds. I can't eat raisins, so used chopped dates & dried cherries. I also added Walnuts. I accidentally added Baking Powder so they are probably puffy and maybe should've been flat, so I tamped them down with a spatula before baking. I increased the seasoning a touch by adding some Allspice & Nutmeg. The smell of them baking makes you stand at the oven & wait for them!  YUM.

These are good, but I have to admit that I made several modifications.  I didn't really want to add more fat and sugar on top of the butter and sugar that I had already added, so I substituted the oil and honey with a couple of bananas and then cut the WW flour to just 2 cups.  I didn't add poppy or flax seeds but loved the taste and texture of the sesame seeds.  I also added a cup of butterscotch chips.  My kids and husband love them.  They're thick and hearty.  I think next time I might cut the flour back a little more, even to give a slightly less dense texture.

These are okay.  Used coconut oil in place of butter and oil, used all ground flax instead of whole flax seeds (since they need to be ground to provide nutritional value), and subbed oat flour for the whole wheat.  The flavor just didn't quite come together for us.  Thanks for sharing!

Great for a take-along breakfast or mid-morning break.
