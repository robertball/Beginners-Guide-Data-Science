This cookie is delicious! My husband LOVES cinna-buns and when I made these cookies he went nuts! A couple of tips--- Refrigerate the dough to make it easier to handle. I rolled the dough into ropes on a floured surface with the palms of my hands then pushed into the line of cinnamon and then pulled it away a little and coiled it there ( because the first couple of times I tried to pick up the rope it broke) then carefully transferred to cookie sheet. YuMmY!!!

My cookies are currently baking in the oven and I'm pondering how I can improve my efforts for my next try as the cookies are spreading out like large disks. I think my butter was a little too soft as I put it in the microwave, it will be room temp next time. I will definately refrigerate the dough as another reviewer suggested prior to handling. I like to use a little powdered sugar in this instance, instead of flour to prevent sticking as it also prevents the dough from becoming too tough when eating. I may even refrigerate the dough before baking to prevent such spreading. I did use parchment paper and not a sprayed pan to prevent this, but I think I just took too long to roll the dough and deal with the cinnamon sugar. I may even try to just roll the whole cookie mix into a rectangle, sprinkle on the cinnamon, roll into a log, refrigerate or even freeze, then cut with a sharp knife to make it even easier to come out with a more uniform and pretty looking cookie. I'm not the best when it comes to intricate or more delicate baking.

WAAAY too much work for what you end up with.  Sticky dough.  Tasted okay, but will not make again.

Even after chilling the dough, it softened VERY quickly and the ropes broke while I was making them into snakes and coiling them into rounds. During baking, alot of my cookies spread out and lost the coiled look. That said, the cookie itself is very nice and the ones that did turn out (somewhat..LOL) like 'Betty Crockers' looks really pretty.  It was alot of work for a cookie mix and I doubt that I will go through the trouble again.  THX.

I did refrigerate the cookie dough for about 30 minutes, then I rolled it out into a rectangle, sprinkled it with cinnamon, rolled it up again, then rolled the cookie roll up in plastic wrap. I then refrigerated the roll for at least an hour, sliced them into 1/2 inch slices and baked them. I think they baked a little better if I flattened them slightly before baking. This was not as time consuming as the initial directions.

These cookies are so pretty and super easy to make. I wanted to refrigerate the dough but as I was in a hurry, I stuck it in the freezer for a few minutes and it worked perfectly.  Easy to roll when chilled ( i took the advise of another reviewer and used powdered sugar on my working surface instead of flour. Will make again.

Really moist and chewy.  I liked these a lot.  However, I did find them a little bit annoying to put together.  I followed suggestions and refrigerated dough for a few hours before rolling.  Next time I would experience with creating a log that I could just cut into cookies, b/c rolling each one took a while.

We made our own dough for these. My kids, 7, 4 and 2, helped roll them, and "spin" them up.  This might be the first cookie that they actually had more fun making than eating!  Although, we all enjoyed eating them, too.  They look great, stay soft, and taste great, too!

What a great way to jazz up store bought cookies...and they look so darn adorable!  I made them for a brunch, when I didn't have the time to make cinnamon rolls.  Not one cookie leftover!...Update, made this recipe again for my family and added in a tablespoon of brown sugar and some ground pecans to the cinnamon mixture...They are just so darn cute and fun to make!

LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE. They are so simple to make, and so delicious. I made these for an office party and got tons of great feedback. My coworkers had the audacity to say that they were from a bakery! I didn't let them know that they were made from pre-made cookie mix though! ;-)

I just got done making these cookies and it was very time consuming. Half way through I got fed up with the coils breaking and yes, I did refrigerate the dough. I just used the rest of the dough to make regular round sugar cookies. I pressed one side into the cinnamon still and just made them like that, the taste is the exact same it just doesn't look as pretty. Also, make sure you watch your cookies when they are in the oven, mine were done after 6 minutes.

The cookies were way too mushy and sticky when trying to roll them, I ended up having to add at least an extra 1/2 cup flour to get it to hold together. The flavor was alright, but I don't think I would go through the effort to do them again. Hopefully other people had better luck.

I was looking for something I could make today with my cookie dough mix because its snowing and cold out and I wanted to warm up the house.  This is a fun recipe when you have time and makes the house smell wonderful! Wasn't terribly time consuming though.  I accidentally doubled the cinnamon in the mix but I think that made them even more tastey! As others have said, watch these, they cook fast! I added flour to the dough to make it easier to work with.

Delicious and easy!  I will absolutely be making these next time I need to bring cookies to a party.  I think the secret is to use room temperature butter NOT melted butter and to refrigerate the dough for at least an hour before making the cookies.  Otherwise they are very hard to roll and mold.

I really liked this recipe. It makes a cookie mix cookie look and taste like something really special. I didn't have any trouble with the dough being sticky or too soft. I used butter that was soft but not melted, maybe that is the trick. I will make these again!

I used the Ultimate Sugar Cookie recipe for the dough as I wanted to use what I had on hand. 

Both my oldest son and I really tried to
follow the directions for dipping and rolling, but with all the handling, it was difficult to keep the dough together.
The rolls kept breaking apart or breaking
into pieces while rolling. So, what my son and I did was quickly roll it into
"snakes", like we do with Pla-Doh, then
dip the whole cookie into the cinnamon-sugar mixture. I had used tinfoil on baking sheets that I had greased with cooking spray, to minimize the sticking that comes when you make a cinnamon-sugar dusted cookie. They turned out really well and the kids loved having "Cookie Testing Time" with their favorite neighbors on the block. I undercooked them just a little, to keep them soft.

I'd make these again. They are like Snickerdoodles, but just a little fancier.

EDITED TO ADD: These spread like the dickens. Funny thing is, that the warmer the dough got from my hot-oven kitchen, the less it spread. I might just use just-made dough next time. These freeze well for school lunches. Freeze them in portions and by the time it's lunch, they're thawed and less likely to break!
