I made these muffins for the second time and made a few changes that made all the difference. Now I have a recipe that is worth making again. I used the lemon yogart but 16 oz instead of 12 and 1 tbs. of lemon extract. Definately cut the amount of poppy seeds in half, 1/4 cup is WAY TOO much. 1/8th cup is plently, I promise. I also used 1/3 cup of oil. I baked them at 400 for 10-12 minutes and they were perfect. Very moist but not greasy, and just the right amount of lemony flavor. The second day they are still yummy warmed in the micorwave.

It's lovely.  I used plain yogurt instead of lemon flavored yogurt and it worked fine.

These muffins turned out quite nice.  I couldn't find Lemon Yogurt at the supermarket so I used plain and added lemon extract to it before I mixed in the eggs and oil, etc.  Next time I might reduce the amount of poppyseeds just slightly.  This recipe made 16 muffins for me.  20 minutes at 350 was perfect in my oven.  I will make these again.  Thanks Karen!

I would have given this recipe 5 stars after the changes I made, but I have to give 4 because it was a bit too dry for me made as-is.  The followed some advice by others the second time around and definitely more moisture is needed.  So I used 2 lemon burst yogurt cups, 6 oz. each, which 1 and 1/2 cups total.  I also used 1/3 cup of oil rather than only 1/4 cup.  I did not measure out my poppy seeds.  I just used a small little plastic jar of Tone's poppy seeds, which was somewhere between 1/8 and 1/4 cup.  (I can see where 1/4 cup might have been pushing it, the amount I used was plenty!)  I kept everything else the same and baked in giant muffins tins which made 6 muffins total for me.  I dropped the temperature to 375 so the outside wouldn't cook too fast, leaving the middle raw.  They came out perfectly, and the the rose nicely giving a decently-rounded top.  The lemon/sugar mixture was perfect to pour over the top.  This really gives the muffins their flavor.  Oh, and I followed the advice a few other cooks and added a tablespoon of lemon extract along with the lemon zest to the batter.  This is a great place to start with a lemon poppy seed muffin, just needs more liquids and it's perfect!  Thanks for sharing.  :-)

These muffins were very easy to make, and they taste great! I made mini-muffins (350 degrees for about 10 mins.) and they turned out perfect. I really like the extra lemon zest in the centre and I sifted icing sugar over the tops. Watch for the edges to turn brown, and they'll be done. (The tops don't turn brown that much.)

This recipe was wonderful!! I have read the other reviews, and I have to say that I don't know how some people ended up with dry muffins. They were very moist and perfectly browned in 19 minutes. The lemon flavor was perfect with the lemon juice and sugar over the top and the light lemony flavor of the muffin itself.

I made these a couple days ago and have been having them for breakfast. They have stayed very moist and delicious! I made several changes to the wet ingredients, though, which I think helped. I used: 2 eggs, 1 6oz container plain Greek yogurt (standard single-serving size), 1/4 cup vegetable oil, and 1 cup of plain applesauce. The addition of the applesauce makes a huge difference to the moistness, and you can't taste it at all. I also used the zest from 2 lemons, which was probably closer to 1.5 or 2 Tbsp, because I wanted to make sure they were really lemony, and they are - not really tart, just very flavorful. I also used half white and half whole wheat flour (1 cup each), which I always do when making muffins so I can pretend to myself they are somewhat healthier. They turned out really well with these modifications!

This recipe is very good.  My husband says these muffins are the best I've made.  I make these with or without the poppyseeds.  Actually, I make one minor change, though.  I put in the lemon juice right in the batter and leave out the last little bit of sugar.  I do not glaze the muffins afterwards.  They are very good that way with a lot of lemon taste.

I loved this muffins! I did follow the advice of others though and used 16 oz of lemon yogurt, 2 heaping tablespoons of poppy seeds, 1 tablespoon of lemon extract, and 2 grated lemon peels. I also made mini muffins baked at 350 for 11 minutes. Once the muffins were cool, I juiced the lemons and added 1 1/3 cup powdered sugar to make a yummy glaze! I will make these again and again!

I made these for Easter brunch. Fabulous! I followed the recipe exactly. (Okay, I did scale down the poppy seeds by about half, but that was it.) This recipe lacks for absolutely nothing!!! I love the glaze and the technique for poking holes in the muffin (I used a fork and stuck each muffin 5xs.) They were so pretty, moist, and everything I could want for a muffin.

Not very good. The muffins were not very sweet and not very lemony. I would expect that a mix would be better. Not worth the time.

First I DON'T COOK!! I have no idea what I'm doing, so that's why I look up recipes... Second... I read reviews..
I noted that in this recipes people were saying they were dry and would add this or that... I took all of that into consideration when I made them. I added more lemon zest, more lemon yogurt, and some lemon extract. They came out nice and moist. VERY lemony but not too much. Yummy all by themselves without the glaze, crazy good with the glaze.

Followed the recipe to a T, even after reading the reviews. I like alot of poppyseeds in my muffins so I was excited to make this one, seeing all the comments on "way too many seeds!".  The result was 12 flat muffins, however. They did not puff up in the oven. In fact, they werent super smooth either. Leaveners werent expired, fresh flour, fresh products...Not very impressed. I will keep looking.

I was really nervous about trying these since most of the readers said they were dry. I decided to follow a couple of the reviews and am glad I did! These muffins are awesome and are NOT dry at all! I added one extra lemon yogurt and decreased the amount of poppy seeds as suggested. I will make these again and again.

These were the best muffins I have ever made, and I've made hundreds.  I had to substitute plain nonfat yogurt, so added a little more sugar and lemon zest.  My husband doesn't usually eat muffins but he gobbled these up like popcorn.

Such mixed reviews I had to try for myself.....   I followed the recipe to specs and they were just off, dry and not very flavourful.  Will not attempt these again.

These came out great and were devoured at work. I did follow the other reviewers recommendations and increase the yogurt to about 1.5C and the oil by a splash as well as decreasing baking time to 16mins. They were nice and moist. I also increased the zest by a few shreds and added 1T lemon juice, but they still could have used a bit more lemon flavor. I will definitely make these again, maybe with double the zest and 2T lemon juice.

Very good, but I intend to play with the recipe a bit more to see if I can get them to come out a bit more tender.  The first time I made them I skipped the glaze and just added 1/4 cup lemon juice to the other liquids.  And since lemon yogurt is unavailable where we are, I added 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract to 1 cup yogurt.  Our family loved them!

The lemon mixture makes exactly 1/2 cup of liquid, which is 2 teas of lemon mixture per muffin, not 1 tablespoon.  No matter how many holes you poke in them, the lemon mixture runs right down the muffin and sits on the pan.  Twenty minutes at 400 degrees makes them overdone.  A quarter cup of poppy seeds is twice the amount you need......in short, an unreliable recipe.

AWESOME. I love lemon & I love poppy seeds. This is the best recipe I have found for both! I doubled the poppy seeds as I can never get enough!!
I noticed some reviewers thought 1/4 cup way too much, hmm go figure. Some also stated they were dry, but that could be from overmixing??
I didn't have lemon yogurt so I used plain with extra lemon juice.
The glaze is what really finishes these gems off!!

Grat tasting muffins, but batter was a little dry after I combined the ingredients. I added 1/2 cup of milk to batter and consistency was perfect.
Also added a touch of vanilla.

I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour and almost doubled the yogurt to keep them moist, and they turned out great. I also added lemon juice to the batter to help with the lemon taste because of the tase of the whole wheat flour.

Loved this! I didn't have lemon-flavored yogurt so I used plain and added 1 tsp lemon extract. And I accidentally put the 1/3 c lemon juice into my mix - but everyone loved it. The lemon flavor wasn't at all overpowering. The batter seemed really dry so I was careful not to overmix. They came out nice and moist though.

O.K., so I didn't read the instructions first and got a bit ahead of myself adding the lemon juice to the muffins. Not a problem... they turned out great despite my mess up.

My husband is diabetic so I used 3/4 cup of sucralose (Splenda) instead of the sugar and that worked well.  I agree with the others definately grease your pan and/or paper cups well and watch the heat.  The sucralose worked ok for the juice on the top.  Try using your food injector instead of lots of holes and pouring the liquid on top.

These were very dry and did not have much lemon flavor.  Not worth the time to took to make them.  I will keep looking for a better recipe.

this recipe is very good.  i did make a few changes as suggested by others.  i used 16oz of yogurt (the whipped kind so it ended up being fluffier).  i aslo added a 1 tbs of limoncello to give the batter more flavor.  when the muffins came out of the oven i poked lots of little holes in them before added the glaze so that it seeped throughout the muffin giving it a better lemon flavor as well.  i will make these again

These are good muffins. Not lemon-y enough for us. However, I should say that I did *not* make the lemon glaze. We don't "do glaze" on muffins:~) That just makes them too sweet. At any rate, I changed a couple of things. I actually used the 1/3 cup of fresh lemon juice IN the muffin batter (vs. in the glaze). I made mini muffins with this recipe (24) and ended up with batter left; enough to make four full sized muffins! The batter was very thick and a bit difficult to work with. Definately not pourable. Pretty much near the consistency of cookie dough. I will cut down the amount of poppy seeds next time. 1/3 cup is way too much (and I love poppy seeds!). Most recipes call for 2 tablespoons. I think I will start out with that next time and just eye-ball it to see if I need to add more.  The muffins are moist enough...but really good with a bit of butter! I will make these again and perhaps add more fresh lemon juice. I really thought the lemon yogurt would give them a kick, but it didn't.

These muffins were excellent.  I made a few substitutions since I didn't have lemon yogurt, so I used vanilla yogurt and added lemon extract.  Additionally, I only had 6oz. of yogurt (standard single serving container), so I added a little bit of milk to make up the extra.  Per others suggestions, I used 1/3c. vegetable oil insted of 1/4c.  I used only about 2 Tbsp. poppy seeds and that was plenty.  I accidentally overbaked them a little while surfing the internet, but they're still great.  Crunchy outside, moist inside.  I skipped the glaze because they seemed good enough without it.  May try it with in the future though.  Thanks for the excellent recipe Karen.

This is a good recipe if you make the changes that others have suggested.
As KEBRAZZ suggested:  I used 16 oz of Lemon Yogurt; and 1/8 cup Poppy Seeds (1/8 was a lot.  You can use less than 1/8 cup Poppy Seeds and it will be fine).
As ELONA suggested:  I use butter, but only 1/3 cup butter (Elona used 1/2 cup).  1/3 cup butter was more than adequate.
Also, I got tired when grating the Lemon Zest -- so I used less than a tablespoon.
The topping really made the muffins special.

I bake quite a bit and was excited to try this recipe but it was horrible. Very dry, even though I read other comments and added a bit more yogurt and oil than the recipe calls for. Only 1 tbs lemon zest?? I used the zest of 1/2 lemon plus 1/4 cup lemon juice, and there was absolutely no lemon flavor. My mom looked up a recipe on food.com and that called for the zest of 2 lemons! No wonder this recipe is so bland. Horrible recipe. Wasted my time and effort.

I thought these were okay but I am never really impressed with any muffin even though I do make them on a regular basis.  I haven't decided if I like poppy seeds in my muffins.   I used 1/8 c. of poppy seeds instead of 1/4 c.  I used 1 tablespoon of baking powder instead of 2 teaspoons but I think 2 t. would have been fine. I used 1/2 c. sugar instead of 3/4 c. because I do not like super sweet muffins.  I used 3/4 c. milk with 1 T. of apple cider vinegar to curdle it instead of the yogurt (because I did not have any yogurt or sour cream on hand.) I used the zest of 1 lemon plus the juice of 1 lemon (which measured 3 T.)  I also added a handful of blueberries because I needed to use them up.  I did not bother with the glaze on top just because I am too lazy to be bothered with such things.  If I decide to make these again (which I may because I still have poppy seeds that I want to get rid of) I will definitely use more lemon juice and lemon zest and maybe even some lemon oil.  I'm pretty sure I will still be too lazy to bother with the glaze even though that would make them yummier.

These are good little muffins! I used 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour which gave them a nice bit of texture and flavour, I also used blueberry yogurt instead of lemon, used melted margarine instead of oil, and added a little bit of lemon juice to the batter to kick up the lemon flavour. Took them out of the oven at 19 minutes and they were perfect!

They were very moist and delicious. I didn't deviate from the recipe. Next time, I would make 14 muffins instead of 12. They baked together and didn't separate as cleanly as I would have preferred for presentation. I also turned my oven down to 375 degrees.

An average muffin. The lemon sugar poured over the muffin afterward helps spunk it up a little.

I loved these muffins!  I did make a couple of small changes.  I used plain yogurt instead of lemon flavored.  I also added just a bit more oil than it asked for.  I know that some people on here only put in 1/8 cup of poppy seeds but I put in the whole 1/4 cup and thought that it was good.  I will definitely make these again!!!!

Perfect muffin recipe.  Definitely watch these as they bake, and swap shelves in your oven half-way through baking.  You don't want the tops to get too crusty, or golden.  I heated the sugar and lemon juice, to make a syrup.  Absolutely delicious, moist, and flavorful.

I made these muffins for a brunch. The final touch of the lemon sugar on the top gave them a nice shiny glaze. They were quite lemony. I made mini muffins, so perhaps I added too much lemon sugar glaze to each muffin, but I love the taste of tart lemon. I will make these again.

This recipe was good when I followed other suggestions of doing 1/3 cup of oil and 1/8 cup of poppy seeds and adding 1 tbsp of lemon extract and 1&1/8 cups of lemon yogurt. They only need to bake between 10-12 minutes for sure. with these changes they are WONDERFUL!

I love LOVE poppy seed muffins!  These were great with the modifications suggested.  I used 12 oz yogurt (1 lime 1 lemon), 1/8 c poppy seeds, 1/3 c oil.  Now, here's where I messed up!  Haha, I put the lemon juice in with the yogurt and everything, so I used 1 T lemon extract 1/3 c water and 3 T sugar for the mixture to pour over the tops:)  They tasted great!  Mine didn't puff up, but maybe it had to do with the altitude? or the fact that I used 1 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1/2 almond meal instead of white flour:) Thanks for a keeper!

I just made these, they taste good - but I would now make the following adjustments. I followed reviewers advice. First of all, 12 oz of lemon yogurt IS enough! Also, I would use 1/3c. veg. oil and poppy seed instead of 1/4 (that's too much) - **also - take it literally when they say LIGHTLY GREASE THE PANS - ESPECIALLY if you have non-stick pans (they still need a bit) - In addition, I tried it both ways - with the high heat and 20 min will nearly burn them, 15-17 min at 350° is best - keep an eye on them! Will probably make them again - but this time with these adjustments!

followed the recommendation to reduce the poppy seeds  and added a bit of vanilla extract.  They turned out beautiful and tasted great (used zest and juice from a meyer lemon from our backyard) - I had a dozen regular size muffins to bring to a teacher's brunch plus a handful of minis for our family.  Will definitely be making these again, as my family was disappointed to get only one mini each!

I just made these today and WOW!! Great recipe. We have been buying lemon poppyseed muffins from the grocery store and although we enjoy them, they are very greasy. I decided to try these and the only things I did different was to follow other reviewers tips to use only 1/8c. of poppyseeds and added a bit of fresh lemon juice to the batter as well. I used just a smidgen more than 1/4c of oil but I am sure the 1/3 would still be fine. I found a lemon meringue parfait flavored yogurt by Yoplait called Source Dessert Selections so that is what I used. Love the lemon juice/ sugar touch at the end. I had no problems of puddling. After they are baked, poke holes with a toothpick and brush on the juice. These were fabulouse!!! Thanks

These tasted great!!! I did change things around a bit. I used about 1/4 c. of soymilk and the juice of 1-1/2 cups of
real lemons rather than yogurt. I increased the oil to 1/3 cup. I added the juice of 1 lemon to the batter. I used the last half lemon and one tbsp of sugar to pour over the muffins after baking.  They were really lemony and moist. This should help those of you who didn't get enough lemon taste!! It really worked.   I also sprayed the muffin tins with lemon flavored baking spray rather than greasing the muffin tin.

These were just ok, they were bland, and didn't have much lemon taste.  Needs something to make them zestier.

All in all, a decent muffin. They definitely need the lemon juice/sugar poured over them.... I cannot stress this enough. It turned a bland, dry muffin into one worth eating. I took the advice of others and only used 2Tbsp of poppy seeds. It was plenty. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was just okay to me.  The glaze was good, but it seemed to only be there to cover the bland flavor of the actual muffin.  It didn't seem lemony enough, but this could be my fault, as I used a bit under a tablespoon of zest and "lemon merguine" yogurt rather than plain lemon.  I'll probably make again, perhaps adding a bit of lemon juice to the batter.

These were pretty good.  I doubled the yogurt and used only 2 TBSP poppy seeds.                       
At first I thought  the topping was odd, but it wasn't bad.  My picky daughter said she thought it would be better without the topping (as she was finishing her fourth one during breakfast.)  They were good cold, straight from the fridge in the morning for breakfast.

I followed TAMBUTLER review and changed a few things per the review. I did double the lemon zest though. Good muffins and moist. Make sure you add lemon extract. I made mine in a mini muffin tin, baking 10 -11 min.

Yummy!!  That's the word my kids were using all morning.  After reviewing the comments, I made a few variations.  First, I noted that the recipe says buttermilk can be used in place of yogurt, although it's not listed as an ingredient, so I made that substitution.  Also, I added 1 TBS of lemon extract.  We like a lemony taste, so someone else may want to use less.  I used only 2 TBS of poppy seeds.  I also used 1/2 a cup of butter, in place of vegetable oil (which may be why we found them to be moist!) Last, I baked them for about 15 minutes, instead of 20.  Minor variations, because the lemon sauce you drizzle on at the end *makes* these muffins!

Even after reading the reviews and making the adjustments, they were dry.  In fact the batter was almost like cookie dough so I added milk.  I'll keep looking.

This recipe is perfect for a formal brunch.  The highlight is the lemony mixture poured into each of the muffins, giving it a delightfully perky taste.  I made these for a Mother's Day brunch and they were the talk of the morning!  One woman made the remark that these were the only thing she wanted for her birthday!  What a great recipe.

I didn't have lemon flavoured yogurt so I used plain Balkin style yogurt (Not quite as thick as Greek yogurt)  , substituted whole wheat flour and I didn't have lemon extract so I added 1/2 c fresh lemon juice.  Truly awesome muffins!  Great flavour and texture!

Just made this recipe and the muffins are delicious. This is my kind of recipe not a lot fuss to make quick and easy.     I didn't have lemon yoghurt I used plain greek yoghurt and add the granted rind of the whole lemon and I did use 1/3 cup of oil and 1 tablespoon of poppy seeds. I will definitely be making these again.

Muffins are great.  Just the right mix of lemon, poppy and yes, yogurt.  These were wonderful tasting and probably healthier than most muffin recipes.  I will definitely bake again.

Good flavor, but cooking these at 400 for 20 minutes is way too much.  Some have complained about there being too many poppy seeds with a 1/4 cup.  I think it provides a good amount if you enjoy it.  Lemon yogurt can be hard to find now.  So I'll have to work with plain or something like lemon pie flavor.

I used half the amount of poppy seeds (still plenty), and used plain greek yogurt instead of lemon yogurt. I increased the amount of shredded lemon peel to compensate and they turned out delicious. I didn't even bother with the glazing, they were nice and moist on their own.

These were kind of dry but I think it's just because I overcooked them. I accidentally put the 1/3 cup lemon juice in the muffins before I baked them so I added another 1/3 cup with the sugar again as the topping. It was delicious and I would recommend doing that. I also topped with Raw sugar before I baked to get that extra crunch. I think I can make them 5 star next time.

I tried this recipe after another one didn't turn out so well.  I followed some of the suggestions posted (only 1/8 cup poppyseed - about 2 tbsps, 1/3 cup oil, 1 1/2 cups plain yogurt) and it turned out great.

These muffins are very good, but very dry. I wish I would have read the reviews prior to making them. I will make again, but I will be following the suggestions made in the reviews.

These were absolutely divine! I took recommendations from other reviews and adjusted the recipe as follows:

- 1/3 cup of oil instead of 1/4
- 1/8 cup poppy seeds instead of 1/2
- 2 containers of lemon flavored yogurt instead of just 1
- added 1 tbl of lemon extract

Will definitely make these again and again.

These were alright, I doubled the recipe but only used the original amount of poppy seeds.  I had to add a couple splashes of milk in order to get enough liquid to mix with the dry ingredients.  They have alright flavour, but not enough lemon for me (and I added lemon extract) they also came out pretty dry.

I don't know what we did wrong. Perhaps it was the 50/50 applesauce/oil mixture we used, or the fact that I used vanilla yogurt (t was what I had on hand).  At any rate, I don't feel confident enough in the base recipe to try this one again.

I gave this one a 4 for effort. I did change a few things in the recipe. I used more lemon zest, plain yogurt (and a bit more than suggested once I seen how the mixture was still a bit dry) and added a lot more lemon juice. (because of the plain yogurt  and I like things really lemony)

I thought they turned out really well but I wish I had used a different glaze for them because the one recommended here was just too runny and didn't co operate very well.

These muffins were a bit dry, even though I added some milk and baked them for only 15 minutes.  I might try this again but add more milk or oil.  I took other reviewers' suggestion to add 1/8 c poppy seeds, and that was indeed plenty!  I also used plain yogurt instead of lemon.

Great Muffins! I used two cups of lemon yogurt (12oz total), and reduced the poppy seeds to about 1/8 cup.

Made this twice.  Both times it came out dry and devoid of lemon flavor. The first time I made as directed, the second time I increased the oil to 1/3 a cup and added 1 tbl. lemon extract and it still came out not good.  I also tried making the glaze twice, once using splenda and the second time with actual sugar.  It was too watery and not at all like a glaze.  I would probably experiment with powdered sugar next time but I'm not going to waste more materials on these muffins.

I love these muffins. I followed the recipe but I used plain yogurt with some lemon extract and they turned out great.  My husband said they taste just like the ones from the bakery.  I did cut back on the glaze, 1/2 cup icing sugar and enough lemon juice to make it spreadable & put on thinly while warm...yum.  I will definitely make these again.

Good muffins.  The dough was a little drier than most muffin doughs.  If I was to make these again, I would reduce the flour to 1 1/2 cups.  I used powdered sugar in the glaze and waited until the muffins were cooled to drizzle it on.  Overall, the lemon/poppy seed combination had a very nice flavor.

These are great! Like everyone, I only used 1/8 cup poppy seeds. Also, I used 12 oz of the yogurt. To keep them moist, I baked at 375 degrees for 15 mins. After the changes, they were perfect!

I thought the muffins were missing a little something. The lemon juice and sugar mixture over the tops of the muffins definitely gave them a kick but without that gloss I felt like it was lacking in lemon flavor. You could only really taste the flour and sugar and not much else.

I'm glad to find a poppy seed muffin recipe that isn't filled with oil!  I haven't quite gotten it as soft as I'd like it, but it is still cakey without being crumbly or too heavy.  They are best right out of the oven!  A batch of these does not last long in our house!

Made these for a mommies that came for a playdate with their kids...moms and kids loved these muffins!  I only did 1/8 cup of poppy seeds, added 1tbsp lemon extract, put the lemon zest in the mix and didn't bother with the sugar and lemon juice glaze.  They all want the recipe and asked for me to make more at our next playgroup date.

I used the recipe as it is given for 12 servings. I thought they turned out lovely. They have just the right amount of crunch and a little sweetness to counteract the tang of the lemon, also very moist. For me, the recipe of 12 actually made 18 and I didn't need to cook them for a full 20 minutes, more like 15 but that could be the stove I am using. I will definitely be making these in the future. Thanks Karen!

These are very good. I used 1/8 c. poppy seeds, 6oz container of lemon yogurt, about 1/4 c. fat free sour cream (squeezed a bit of the juice from the lemon in w/the sour cream), 1/8 c. canola oil, 1/8 c. apple sauce. Kept all the other ingredients the same and baked for 12 minutes.

Good, moist, nice lemon flavor. I used a very scant 1/4 c poppy seed, after reading other reviews. I screwed up the last part, instead mixing the lemon juice into the batter. It turned out great despite the mistake and I didn't add the last few T of sugar. They are sweet enough for me! I had enough batter to fill one regular muffin and a mini muffin tin.

Flavor was great, but they came out dry. Mine were done @ 13 minutes. 30 minutes would be way to long. I think the higher temp dries them out. I will try 375 or 350 next time. I used 2 tbsp poppy seeds.

I followed the receipe and I agree with alot of the other reviews, these are very dry muffins. As I love this kind of muffin I'm willing to try it again this time adding more oil to make them moist as suggested by others.

I loved these!  The edges that got a little too brown, were heavenly!  Very moist and just delicious overall.  We didn't do the glaze b/c my son doesn't like it, and they were still perfection!

definitely delicious.  i took the advice of others and used a little more than 1/8 C. poppy seeds (and that was a perfect amount), used 1/3 c. oil...and i used the most delicious yogurt stonybrook farms organic "lucious lemon" fruit's on the bottom-12oz) and it was amazing.  cooked for 15min each in my oven (a little bit longer than others did i guess).  super moist and super delicious!

This is the best lemon poppy seed muffins I have had.  The texture was wonderful and the taste was not too sweet. I baked for 15 minutes at 400, anymore time and they would have overdone.  The only thing I changed was I used butter instead of oil.

For super lemony muffins, may I suggest adding a couple teaspoonfuls of pure lemon extract.

I'm sure that this would be a very tasty recipe as written but I couldn't resist a couple of changes.  I added 1/2 tsp. of coconut extract(just felt right) and garnished the tops with sliced almonds. Warning: If you are using a dark, non-stick pan, cut the cooking time! I burned my first batch-but I still ate them-thats how good they taste :)

Love these muffins!  When I plan on traveling with these muffins, or storing them in a ziploc bag, I don't do the glaze part.  They are still really yummy and moist.

These were good.  I used 12oz. of yogurt, but plan to make them again with 8oz. of lemon yogurt. I used butter in place of the oil.  Overall, they were moist and tasty.

This is a pretty good recipe. I used plain yogurt and just added a little bit more lemon zest and it worked fine. I would probably add even more next time (2 tbsp +). The lemon/sugar finishing touch made it just right for lemon flavour. I only used 1/8 cup of poppy seeds as was recommended by someone else and it was a perfect amount. I also only baked them for 12 minutes at 400 deg. I can see how they could turn out dry if you bake them longer than that but 12 minutes was more than enough time. Overall, it's a good one!

Very good! I used two small containers of Yoplait "Lemon Burst" flavored yogurt. I also made no changes to the recipe except to half the amount of poppy seeds (1/4 cup is WAY too much AND poppy seeds are EXPENSIVE) and to add a little powdered sugar to the top. The muffins turned out a little dry in my opinion, but they were still really yummy, and oh so easy to make. I like mine warm with melted butter, and hubby likes his with cream cheese. A fantastic breakfast treat or midnight snack! Thanks for sharing.

These are excellent with no changes. 1 cup of yogurt=8 oz, and 1/4 c of oil is perfect. Oh, I did use plain yogurt with 1 tsp. lemon extract cos I had the same prob finding lemon yogurt. These are worth making just the way they are. Oh, and I completely left out poppy seeds because I really don't like them. Ok, so I did change it a little.

These were pretty good! I did add the extra lemon yogurt and decreased the amount of poppyseeds. I thought they could hve used a bit more lemon flavor, but they were still good and everyone liked them. will make again! Thank you for the recipe!

This is a good start, but there's definitely not enough lemon flavor... and I don't even really like lemon, just lemon-poppyseed muffins.  I'll keep playing with it, though, because it has a lot of promise.

These were a bit hit!  I did alter the recipe a bit, added extra lemon extract and used about a cup of whole milk yogurt so they would be more moist.  They were good muffins, will definitely make them again.  They tasted delicious even the next day with some butter on top.  I would recommend this recipe!

Was not impressed with this. Not very lemon-y and to much poppy seed. The "glaze" for the top didn't do much of anything but run over the side and off the top of the muffins.

Dry, but I plan to try again with a few changes.  The changes I made the first time: doubled the poppy seeds, doubled the lemon zest, only used 6 oz yogurt, doubled the sugar in the topping, used a Texas size muffin pan.  They were tasty but dry around the margins, possibly because of the larger size muffins.  Next time, I will use 12 oz yogurt and bake at 350 F.  I might add some lemon extract, because we like strongly-flavored muffins.

I didn't really modify this recipe at all and I had no problems with it being dry.  Please remember when making muffins it is imperative that you not overmix.  In fact, you're better off leaving the batter in a state that seems woefully undermixed to you.  As for modifications, I did use lime yogurt instead of lemon, added a bit of lemon extract, and added orange-flavored crasins.  Delicious.  Beware the glaze, though:  I loved it, but it was quite tart.

Yeah, these are really good.  Like many others, I took several suggestions from reviewers.  I used natural yogurt, and the juice and zest from three small limes, as that is what I could get.   I used coconut in place of poppy seeds, as it is what I had.  They are very moist,  tender and yummy.  Mine didn't rise as much as I would like, but my double batch won't last long around here.  thank you for another good recipe.

Good but this recipe does not have the white frosting shown in the photo, rather lemon juice and sugar poured into toothpick-sized holes. Muffin might be moister and better with homemade powdered sugar frosting.

When I spooned this dry-looking mixture into the muffin tins, I had expectations that my garbage can would end up a little more full tonight. 17 minutes later, I couldn't have been more wrong. These little puppies have the right balance between lemon and poppy seed, rivaling much of what I pay Starbucks $4 for. Next time, I might go with a different glaze with confectioner's sugar.  For now though, I'm happy to reheat these and enjoy them with my homemade coffee! Thanks for sharing!

400 degrees for 18 minutes was a bit too long, in my oven, but muffins are tasty and glaze gives them a nice shiny top and a little more tartness. I will bake again, perhaps with lemon juice added to liquid ingredients in batter as well.

The recipe didn't have enough moisture to incorporate all the flour. Added about 1/4c milk to get it close to a muffin consistency- it was so thick I could have hand kneaded it. Tasty, but weird. It even rose weird. Not like muffins.

For the wet ingredients : I made this using about 14.5 oz of plain unsweetened yogurt, the juice and zest of three lemons plus 1.5 Tablespoon of lemon extract, and 1/3 cup of oil....kept everything else the same. 

Dry ingredients: kept everything the same however I can’t find poppy seed here in NZ so I substituted 1/4 cup of chia seeds and it worked just fine. 

Baked at 175C for 25 mins or so and then poked and poured the lemon juice sugar as directed.

I started with the recipe as written but did make changes that turned it into a regular thing at my house.
I use one cup of AP flour and one cup of pastry flour.
I use regular plain yogurt  and a full cup of sugar to make up for the sugar in the lemon yogurt.
I use more poppy seeds but that is just choice.
I double the amount of lemon extract and use all of the zest and juice of a large lemon.
This is only slightly different from the written recipe and they are very good lemon poppy seed muffins.  Leave out the poppy seed and add blueberries for a wonderful lemon blue berry muffin.
This recipe is also very good using orange insdtead of lemon.

VERY GOOD. I doubled and made 33 good size muffins. I used extra yogurt and oil but on first try thought slightly dry.
As they cooled and little butter changed my mind.
Make again, quite nice.

I made a few changes for dietary reasons.  Used 1/2 sugar, 1/2 Granulated Splenda.  Added 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce for extra moistening.  1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour. Plain 2% yogurt with 1 tsp lemon extract.  Zest from two lemons, juice of one lemon.  2 table spoons of poppy seeds. 20 minutes @ 375 degrees F.  No topping.  They were soft, sweet and lemony.  Excellent!  Will make again.

Absolutely loved these muffins! I admit I followed one of the reviews, so I added less poppy seeds. Also I had plain yogurt so I used it (cup and a half), and finally, reduced the oil to 1/4 cup. Just yummy and healthy poppy seed muffins =)

I see why people said dry. The batter was way too dry. I upped Greek yogurt to 1 1/2 c. Added lemon oil instead of zesting lemons. Also added 2 Tb lemon juice to batter. And like others it only needed 1 1/2 Tb poppy seeds.

Needs a slight increase in sugar to 1 c.

I made no changes except to use a skewer to poke holes in the top instead of a toothpick.  These were moist and delicious!

Followed the recipe exactly except I subbed plain yogurt with a few drops of lemon extract added, results were great, fluffy, moist muffins with a great lemony taste. Please note -  the photo shown with this recipe has granulated sugar sprinkled on top of the muffins with a glaze made from confectioner's sugar ( not granulated white sugar)  drizzled over that.  The big guy loved these and has requested a repeat performance.

To me this recipe is more poppy seed than lemon, it should be called poopy seed lemon muffins! Good and moist and defiantly some adjustments are needed. I will do 2-3 tbls lemon zest and maybe some lemon extract.  Even with the lemon drizzled on top after the lemon flavour was mild. 

Less poppy seeds more lemon is my recommendation to those that like a lemon taste.

Very lemony - just how I like them.  They don't blow me away, but they're very tasty.

These were just ok for flavor and texture. I used lemon-flavored Greek yogurt and used 8oz for a half-recipe (which I got 8 muffins from). But there still wasn't much lemon flavor, even with the glaze. And the texture was kind of gummy. The batter was really thick, not at all like normal muffin batter. I probably won't make these again.

We made these muffins and enjoyed them!  We listened to some of the advice from others, cut the oil and I only had vanilla yogurt but used double the lemon extract.  We also listened to the advice of using 12 oz of yogurt and there is no need for all of the poppy seeds they originally call for - we used 1/2 and it was more than enough.
The muffins froze great making them a lunchbox favorite!

These were awful. They tasted like plain muffins, nothing special and the glaze wasn't pretty or thick. It poured on like water, drenching the muffin. Don't waste your time. I give this no stars.

I loved the taste of these and they were perfectly moist! I used plain Greek yogurt and some extra lemon juice in the batter. I also used less poppy seeds and sprinkled some sugar crystals on top of the muffins before baking. Really delicious, I will definitely make these again!

I didn't have any yogurt in the house, so I used milk and added 1 tsp of lemon extract. I make my own so I had some handy. but I think the lemony flavor would have been more pronounced if I had put in the yogurt...(I think I will add more lemon extract next time ) but these were moist and very yummy!

This recipe was very tasteless. Moist, though. The only saving thing was the glaze that you drip onto muffin.

I'm pretty sure the problem here is whether you're using 1 measured cup of yogurt or 1 store-bought cup of yogurt, which measures out to more like 3/4 cup and that will give you moisture problems.  I just used 1 cup of milk plus a teaspoon of lemon juice to curdle (muffins need the acid plus baking soda/powder to rise) and I also added lemon oil to boost the flavor and because I had it around.  cut back on the poppy seeds and you've got a very tasty muffin!

I used plain yogurt and it seemed to work ok. I did not think that the muffins were dry. Next time I will use less of the topping because it actually seemed to make the muffins a little too wet for my taste. I think a lemon frosting would be better than the glaze.

These were good. I used plain Greek yogurt, and added extra lemon juice to the batter because it was a bit dry. Despite all the lemon, I still found it lacking in lemon flavor.

I agree with most other reviewers that these muffins do not have enough lemon flavor as the recipe is currently written.  The next time I make them, I will add at least a Tablespoon of fresh lemon to the batter and possibly use both the zest and juice of two lemons. I only used 1/2 cup of sugar in mine as I'm trying to reduce my use of sugar in general. 

I do love the way they baked. Mine popped right up in the muffin pan and were lightly browned after about 14 minutes.

I was a little disapointed in this recipe. They were not as moist as I had hoped. I wonder if I did something wrong. Anyway, my husband enjoyed them so maybe I'm just picky!
