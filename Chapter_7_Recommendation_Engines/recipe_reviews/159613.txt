I made this recipe with my sons this morning and it was okay at best. It was more cake-like to me and was not a chewy cookie consistency, more of a fluffy texture. The recipe description says light and fluffy, so I guess I should have listened!!! Good taste though, just not the consistency I like in a cookie. This would be good baked into muffins.

These cookies are supposed to be soft. If you don't like soft, find another recipe. If you indeed like softness, this is the perfect recipe. The only change I make is that I use 3/4 cup of brown sugar and approx 1/3 cup of white sugar to get a bit more of the classic choc. chip cookie taste.

These were too soft for our tastes. If you prefer chewy cookies, you won't like these.

Absolutely Scrumptious!  Not too sweet, and definitely cakey (which I love), and stays moist for days (as long as they lasted in my house!!).  I used only chocolate chips, as I am not a big fan of nuts in cookies.  Will definitely make again!
