Hi, I'm the person who submitted this recipe many moons ago.  I am somewhat shocked at the sodium content at six servings, and have to advise that I think the recipe really makes 10-12 servings rather than 6, and even more servings when calculated using children's portions.  I still love this recipe and eat it often, and just stumbled across it again.

I needed to amend my first review.  I rated this 3 cards the first time, but after letting the flavors blend overnight I would give it a 4.  It was fantastic the second day--much better than the day it was made.

I thought this turned out to be a little too salty for my taste.  I would recommend using very sweet onions and adding celery.  I eat it on bread with tomatoes and cucumbers.  Also, it makes a lot, so halfing the recipe is a good idea.

I served this at my daughter's fifth birthday party as little tea sandwiches on homemade bread.  All the moms asked for the recipe.  I sauteed the carrots and onions in olive oil first, because I have trouble digesting raw onions. I skipped pressing the tofu, just cubed it ahead of time and let it dry out on the counter for about a half hour, then used a potato masher to crumble it. I also skipped the seeds.  The next time I made it I used just the tofu, miso, and tahini and made it smooth in the food processor to use as a dip for raw veggies.  I added some onion powder and nutritional yeast and balsamic vinegar to replace the vegetables, and it was very tasty change of pace from hummus.

This is a fabulous recipe!  I even forgot to buy tahini and decided to substitute peanut butter, and that tasted great too.  It's kind of a weird combination, but it works.  Try it!

I LOVE this recipe!  I am a vegan, but this recipe is for anyone on any diet!  I agree with the other posters that it is definitely better on the second day, but I will still gobble it up on the first day.

Variations:
I have added celery (YUM!) and red cabbage to this. I think celery should be in the recipe.  It is definitely an added texture. This recipe works great on toasted whole wheat, especially with veganaise (vegan substitute for mayo, I am sure regular mayo would be good too).  I haven't tried it yet, but I can't wait to add tomatoes, avocados, etc to the sandwich.

The ingredients in this didn't sound so good, but boy once it was assembled, it tasted GREAT!! I used about 1 c. grated carrot and red miso, and liked it even better. My one year old son loves it too!! What could be better, tasty and vegan.

Oh, this is so good!  I used red miso and no onion because of my husband but otherwise no changes.  I'm not a vegetarian, just trying to get more soy and healthier protein. I highly recommend this to anyone trying to cut meat consumption as it is so tasty!

Tofu, Miso and Tahini are a no-miss base. I added 3 minced scallions, 2 chopped shitake mushrooms, 1/2 finely chopped green pepper, 1/2 cup of parmesan and a dash of garlic powder. DELICIOUS. Other reviewers mentioned that it's better the next day. Can't imagine it'll be better.

I'm relatively new to miso, so this was a great find! I loved the recipe the way it was, but for those who aren't as fond of the tofu flavor, I added 2 Tbsp of dijon mustard & a shake of rice vinegar to tang it up a little. (Can you verb tang?)

This is really good.  And I agree, much better the second day.  I used red miso, toasted sesame seeds instead of sunflower seeds, and pretty much doubled the carrots.  I am not vegetarian, but this is quite tasty. It is pretty salty though.  Very good on whole wheat toast with sliced tomato.

At first this recipe tasted too strong so I tried adding toasted sesame seeds and a bit of lemon juice. It didnt seem to help so I just put it in the fridge. I went back to it a few days later and it was AWESOME! By this time, the flavours had mellowed and the onions gone soft and brown (this is how you tell it has rested long enough). It lasted very well in the fridge, for at least two weeks. I only just threw the rest out because there was only a teeny bit left, not because it seemed spoiled.
Thanks for the recipe :)

This was okay.  The texture was a little weird, next time I might use silken tofu just to make it smoother.  My husband thought it was hummus.

Absolutely delicious on whole wheat toast!  My 15 month old son loves it and gets excited when I ask if he wants TMT for lunch.

Prep time is actually about 30 minutes, because th tofu should be pressed, but the spread is delicious!  I tried with some red peppers on whote wheat toast and it is yummy!

I get tired of the egglass salad recipe and was so happy to find this.  It is very good, though I used yellow miso because it's all I had, and added celery instead of the sunflower seeds.  I made it for people who wanted to try tofu but didn't know what to do with it.  They ate all of it.  Thanks!

Awesome vegan spread.  Very filing and makes a ton!  You can easily get 10+ sandwiches with one batch of this.  There's something very creamy and tastes almost like it has eggs or cheese it in.  It definitely tastes better the next day.  I'll be making this one again!

This recipe has potential but I think there was way too much miso (lots of sodium as noted in the submitter's own review, and also the flavour is very strong). I would use only 2 or 3 tbsp of miso next time. The seeds and onion (I used red) are great for flavour and texture. I didn't use carrots but it would be a good idea. I used Ryvita crackers, which equals about 12 generous servings (one per cracker).

Really good spread! I used dehydrated onion flakes and put them under the tofu to rehydrate while I added the other ingredients. I didn't have brown miso so I used half white and half red and it was great!

A pretty expensive flop. I didn't care for it that much.  My 9 year old daughter is the only one of my three kids that was willing to eat it on a sandwich.  The tahini cost $9 for a jar.  The miso was a bit hard to find for awhile in the Asian section and cost $5.
