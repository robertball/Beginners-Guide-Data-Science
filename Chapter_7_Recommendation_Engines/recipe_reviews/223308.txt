Don't have a jelly roll pan (not even sure what it is) put in a 9 x 13 dish.  Took longer  to cook, about 10 extra minutes with temp turned up to 350.  Tasted great.  Recommend chocolate frosting instead of peanut butter.

Don't try these without a glass of milk nearby! They were very rich! If you love peanut butter you will love these! I used salted butter so I cut the salt down to a teaspoon, I also added about 5 minutes to the cook time. Very easy to throw together. I will make these again but instead of frosting with peanut butter I may try chocolate just to break up the taste a little! Thank you for a great recipe!

I like the flavor of this recipe, but I definitely think the recipe needs leavening other than the eggs. Were I to make it again, I would add perhaps 3/4 tsp baking soda and 1/4 tsp baking powder. Without the leavening, the baking time definitely needs to be increased. At twenty minutes with no leavening, this was nowhere near set enough to take out of the oven. I also would decrease the sugars to 1/2 cup each, as I prefer cookies that aren't so sweet.

very very yummy! It's really rich but it's still delish! It's perfect with vanilla ice cream. Tones down the sweetness a little =)

The bars have wonderful peanut butter flavor, but was just a little too sweet for my personal tastes, however my husband liked it.  My concerns when making this recipe was that other than the eggs, there was no leavening agent which if added, I think would have given it a better texture.  I frosted it with a chocolate frosting and if I were to make it again would also add chocolate chips.

The kids and I loved this recipe!  It wasn't so rich that it was over-powering, but it was a good sweet tooth satsifier.  My youngest keeps asking for these since we made them last.  One thing that I wasn't crazy about was the oatmeal in them was a tiny bit odd in texture, but thw next batch I mixed them extra hard and a bit longer and that broke up the oats enough to get rid of that texture issue.  However the taste was spot on!  I also had to bake a little longer as I used a 9x13 too.

I made these tonight and they are so s'morish. I definitely recommend these. I did add a little something though. I topped mine off with (drumroll please)... Nutella! It made them that much better.

I made this because it sounded delicious but the bake time was much longer than what the recipe calls (somewhere around 40-50 minutes) for and it was quite a bit saltier than I would have liked any of my food to be. It tasted a lot more like salted caramel than a peanut butter brownie. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

Really good. Topped with dark chocolate chips once pulled from oven. Similar taste to a no bake cookie.

Very tasty!! I omitted the icing on top since they are plenty sweet without it.  My batter was very thick and hard to spread into pan. I may try a smaller pan next time so that they are more like brownies instead of soft cookie bars. If you are looking for a salty/sweet snack this is it!

Pretty good. A bit dry. Added chocolate chips. Likely can skip the peanut on top and just sunk into coffee in the morning.

Just made these and they are very good! We are pnutbutter lovers and we think they are a real keeper. I baked them in a jelly roll pan but I baked them at 350 (because I had something else in the oven baking at the same time) decreased the baking time to about 20 minutes (I always reduce baking time for cookies and brownies because we prefer chewy)  other than that, I made them exactly as written, but after reading reviews and seeing that others thought they were to sweet, I put some melted semisweet chocolate on the top when they were finished baking. I actually thought they would be better either without frosting or with pnutbutter frosting on them. They were not over the top full of pnutbutter flavor, but like I said we are pnutbutter lovers. Def keeping this recipe!

I did cut both sugars in half as many of the reviews stated they were really sweet. I frosted them with chocolate also.  A nice, quick little bar.

This is delicious! I was a little nervous because my batter was not as runny as brownies usually are, but they turned out to be so yummy!! I whipped the peanut butter that goes on top and added powdered sugar to it. It turns into a frosting and oh is it ever delicious!!

Followed the directions. Burnt on the edges. Crunchy "healthy flavored" granola bar. Hated it.

Well, I just popped mine in the oven.  Although the texture is a bit odd to be called "brownies", the taste of the batter is great! I am a PB lover though. Are these suppose to be thick?  My batter is thick but I think they will taste great once I frost them with PB.

This is definitely a keeper!  As a peanut butter lover in a family of peanut butter lovers, this was a big hit.  They are super moist.  I used a little more peanut butter (probably 1 cup total), one cup of brown sugar and 1/2 a cup of white sugar.  If you stick to the baking time suggested, you can't go wrong.  Enjoy, PB lovers!
