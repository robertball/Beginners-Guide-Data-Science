Really good. It was a nice light dessert to top off Christmas feast. I too added crushed candy to the filling and sprinkled some on the top with a little of the crushed Oreos.

This was really good. It was even better 2 days later. I added 2 or 3 cups more WF chocolate cookies with chocolate filling crumbs with the same amount of butter (it helps to spray the pan also)in a 9" deep dish pie pan. I froze it for and hour then covered it with foil so it wouldn't stick to the foil. I brought it to work and everyone enjoyed it and asked for the recipe! This would also, be a good base recipe to make a mint ice cream pie. Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty and festive, but next time I will definitely leave the cake in the freezer for several hours longer than specified.  The cake was still a bit runny.

This recipes is fantastic! I made a graham cracker crust rather than a chocolate wafer one and will always make it that way as it paired beautifully. I added red food coloring to the cream cheese mixture and 3 fourths of the whipping cream. Folded in the whipping cream blending the color to a nice pink. With the remaining white quarter of whipping cream I used it to make a marble effect with the pink and it looked great. Wonderful recipe and will continue to make it!

This cheesecake was absolutely delicious! I'm not a fan of cheesecake and only decided to try it for our holiday party because of the aesthetics, but it did not disappoint in the least. Part of the reason I enjoyed it was because the consistency was not like that of cheesecake, probably because we added lots of condensed milk to the mixture, so the texture was more of a  liquid than densely packed. We added crushed peppermint as a topping, but next time, I think adding some into the mixture would give each bite a nice crunchy surprise and an even more peppermint taste, although the peppermint extract certainly did its job. Overall, great holiday dessert.

This was So easy to make but did not hold up well. I think it actually melts faster then ice cream if thats possible. I kept having to take it out of t he freezer and stick it back in when no one was eating it. Very annoying.

This recipe is absolutely divine!  I did have to use more cookies for the crust, but the rest of the recipe was perfect.  I made this for my husband at work (he's a firefighter) and the men LOVED it!

Wonderful! Was told by one partaker that it was the perfect holiday dessert; cool, creamy, and peppermint.
My only variances from the recipe were:
1. I had extra cookie crumbs, so I did 3 cups crumbs to the 1/4 C sugar and 1/4 C butter. Worked great. 2. I like mint, so I added more crushed candy canes to the crust, filling, and sprinkled on top. 3. I had a little extra whipping cream, so added about another 1/2 C.
The pie was light to the taste, but very filling. Not too rich. I also very lightly greased the pie pan because I read in other reviews that it stuck - I didn't have that problem.

This is awesome! My husband says that this is the best dessert ever! I would not change anything. For those that said they had problems with it setting up, they probably did not whip the whipping cream enough.

A wonderful holiday dessert. I made them into parfait cups and crumbled soft (old-fashioned) dutch cocoa cookies for the crust. Saved a ton of time. I didn't have to add butter.

This is the best dessert I have ever eaten!  I have made it for my family last Christmas and everyone raved about it.  They were so excited when I made it again this Christmas.  I add Andes Peppermint Crunch Baking Chips before I freeze it.  These are hard to find, but I recently found them at Oriental Trading.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This was OK.  I added some choc chips and crushed candy canes.  I think it would have been OK without the peppermint extract.  It tasted a little too much like toothpaste for it to be a family favorite.

Leaving it in freezer overnight made it too solid and was not soft enough to cut in time for serving.

Every year we have a contest to see who can make the best pie. This recipe won, but personally I didn't think it was anything special and I wont make it again.
