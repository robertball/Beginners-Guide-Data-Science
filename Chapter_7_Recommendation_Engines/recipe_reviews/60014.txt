We learned something about jalapenos when we shopped for this. The shelf guy at the grocery store assisted in choosing jalapenos, and he said his dad used to grow them. The more pointed the jalapeno, the spicier, he said. We hadn't known that, and since we're not big on really hot spice, we chose a very rounded jalapeno for this recipe. It was perfect! A pleasant heat after you eat, but not overwhelming. And oh, yes, we did like the recipe and will make it again. It's a keeper!

Made it almost exactly like the recipe and it was good.  Then I let it simmer for at least 1.5 hours and it was GLORIOUS!  I used stew meat (chopped in small cubes), left out the jalapenos and used Macayo Salsa Verde for the salsa.  The result was a wonderfully flavored meat for tacos, burritos, chimis or in my case, enchiladas.  The secret seems  to be to keep simmering the beef until the liquid is cooked off.  I live in the Southwest and eat a lot of Mexican food, and will make this recipe again and again.

HELPFUL TIPS THAT HELPED ME: If this is your first time working with beef stew meat, look for beef stew meat that is already cubed and packaged.  You may want to cube them even smaller if you plan to use the meat for tacos, etc.  I've done this both ways & using a FRESH jalapeño tastes a lot better.  Don't be afraid to use a lot more green salsa!! I used a lot more than 7 ounces.  Use what's necessary to cover all the meat ...and then more as you see it soak up.  You don't want your beef stew to turn out dry!  Lastly, to make this  5-stars, simmer it for an hour.  This is very quick.  I never saw my husband and kids eat so much.  They usually only eat chicken.

This recipe is very mis-leading. I followed the recipe exactly, and the recipe fails to note that in order for stew meat to be edible, it must be STEWED. This means the meat must cook in liquid for quite some time, like an hour or more. So, as it is written, this recipe is not good. However, I'm sure the flavors would be excellent with stewed meat. Also, as another reviewer noted, cilantro should not be added before the stewing process. It should be added at the very end, to keep its fresh flavor. I hope to try this recipe again with changes soon.

I can't get a lot of Mexican food items here in Australia, so when my son came to visit us a few weeks ago, he brought me a case of 4 oz cans of green chilies. I used one of these in place of the green salsa and it turned out wonderfully.  I really miss the "authentic" Mexican tastes here and this was a real treat, thank you for the recipe.

This was outstanding!  Added double the garlic, cilantro and jalapeno(seeded)--but we like spicey.  Also cut the stew meat in smaller cubes.  Added 2 cans of salsa and cooked for 2-3 hours on low to really tenderize the meat(added a bit of water if necessary).  Wrapped the mixture  in tortillas, added more salsa and these were sooo good!  Have fixed a number of times.

Browned the stew meat the night before.  Cooked in crockpot on low covered to the top of meat with beef stock and half can of green chile peppers so the flavors would blend.  Drain liquids from crockpot in a strainer so you don't lose the peppers. Combined red salsa, green onions, oregano, lime juice, garlic, onion and a little basil husband don't like cilantro.  Threw in a little more of the canned chili peppers.  Cooked them all together, served with refried beans, tortillas, chips, sour cream and he had to have his tomato.  He loved it.  Thanks for the post.

My husband never comments on my cooking, but praised this dish over and over, and said he wanted it every night for dinner. I used ground beef because I couldn't find stew meat at the store. SO GOOD!! A little spicy, next time I will serve it with chopped tomatoes and sour cream to cool it down a bit. Yum!

What a great find in the thousands and thousands of recipe on AR.  I found a package of stew meat in the freezer and went on a quest to find something to make with it.  I made this, but put it all in the crockpot to slow cook all day.  I did brown the onion, beef and garlic on the stovetop before putting in the crockpot.  I then added one chopped jalapeño to the meat mixture.  One hour before eating I added the rest of the ingredients to the crockpot.  We ate this on flour tortilla shells and topped the meat mixture with "Taco Slaw" from AR.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Melissa, it was one of the best I've made in 2011.

This is a tasty dish and very easy to make. I use canned jalapenos (about 1/4 cup) and I add about 2 Tbsp. of light sour cream. 

Note: to keep the cilantro flavor alive, toss it in just as you end cooking. Otherwise, it will wilt and the flavor will not be as intense.

We enjoyed this dish quite a bit! Thank you! While it drives me nuts when reviewers rate a recipe when they've made all kinds of changes to it, I have to admit that I did add 1 tsp. of cumin to the mix because I am crazy for that spice! With or without the addition, it is a wonderful dish. Some words of advice -- cut the meat into evenly-sized pieces; most definitely simmer the meat until tender, while making certain that the meat is covered with enough salsa to keep it from drying out (I simmered it for 2 hours based on other reviews and the fact that my pieces of meat were rather large); the beef will only be as good as the green salsa that you use, so use whatever kind is your favorite for best results. You could certainly play with the "heat" of this recipe by adding more jalapenos if desired. 1 pound of meat was not enough for 4 people, however. Next time I will double the recipe. All in all, a super recipe -- thanks for sharing!

Loved this! Followed recipe exactly, easy and very tasty! I'd prefer it to be a little more salty. Next time I make this, I'll add a little garlic salt to the meat like someone suggested in a previous review. All in all, very good.

Yum. It was very good. I followed another viewers suggestion about cutting stew meat into small pieces and used green salsa as directed. It was fantastic. Thanks for the recipe I will be using it alot. Made it twice first time I gave it 4 stars the second I upped it to 5. It is one of my favorite recipes and very glad I found this one.

Really Good!! I put this in the crockpot before going to work in the morning. When I got home, I made some cheese enchiladas and smothered them with the Mexican Beef Supreme that had been cooking all day. My family gobbled it up!!

Made according to directions.  Did let meat simmer about an hour, but it was VERY tough.  My husband said that if the meat does NOT have any fat...you just cook it a short amount of time.   Will try again with different meat or cook the lean meat the 10 minutes they recommend in this recipe.  Good recipe though.

I made this in my crockpot on high for 4 hours - added 2 cups of beef broth, plenty of garlic, browned the beef and added 16 oz. verde salsa and a small can of green chiles.  Added the green onion, lime juice cilantro about 20 minutes before serving. It was fantastic!  This is definitely going to be one my weekly "go to" recipes!

Made this for my husband and it smelled awesome. I was surprised because it was much thicker than I expected but the smell and taste was great. This might be good as a filler in a wrapper or over Spanish rice.

So delish! I did simmer for about 2 hours though to really get the sauce to reduce which I think is necessary. I also added a bit of sour cream in the sauce to make it more creamy and of course some for garnish. First time ever having green salsa and very tasty and perfect spicy dish. Thanks!

This has turned into a favorite at my house:) I have made it for company and everyone loves it. I put everything into the crockpot and let it do its job and by the time dinner rolls around its perfect. We eat it with corn tortillas, beans and rice, or with buns, it makes a wonderful sandwich. worth more than a five star rating!!!

this is super delicious. it definitely needs to simmer for at least an hour though. add a little bit of water if you need to during the simmering process. and don't add the cilantro until the very end! i also add sour cream at the end to make it more creamy.

Great burrito filling!  I served it with refried beans.  I used leftover roast and shredded it for this meal.  I also threw in some of the leftover roast potatoes.  So good.  I then used the leftover mexican beef and refried beans, added some cheese and sour cream, stirred and heated for a yummy chip dip.

This was OK, but everyone agreed that it was missing something, we thought maybe some cumin would help.

Delicious!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and made it in the crock pot.  I drained a can of black beans and added it to the mixture, along with 4 roma tomatoes.  I'm definitely making this again soon!

I browned onion then meat in frying pan. I added a cup of beef broth. Put all of it in crock pot on low for about 4 hours. Then took lid off and cooked it on Hi for about an hr to reduce the liquid. WOW AMAZINGLY GOOD! And so tender my meat shredded. I also don't care for the dryness of stew meat. I bought a New York strip steak that had marble in it. My husband is a very picky eater and always has a complaint. He not only loved it but said it was one of the best dishes I have ever made. He wants to have the leftovers with scrambled eggs and black beans wrapped in tortillas for breakfast. Thanks for a great recipe!

Yumm-o. I added a little miso paste to give depth to the flavor, doubled the amount of salsa and a little water since I simmered it for an hour I didn't want the liquid to cook off.

Delicious. Making this tonight for the second time in two weeks. Everyone loved it. I like my meat a little saucier so I used two small cans green chile (Embasa) sauce, and I let the meat simmer on low for about 1.5 hours. Very tasty. We eat it with rice and corn tortillas.

I was looking for a recipe using stew meat and found this one. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised with how good this was!! I didn't change a thing regarding the ingredients; I did let the meat & cilantro mixture simmer for 20+ minutes. Served with rice in tortilla shells. It was delicious! Will definitely make again. I have to comment on a couple reviews - someone said 1/2 cup lime juice was too much. it's not 1/2 cup, it's 1/2 lime!! and I thought the amount of lime was perfect. someone else said it was too tomato-eee, although I have no idea how. there were no tomatos in it unless they are in the salsa verde. thanks so much for sharing melissa!

This is good. It has a simple taste-not complicated with a bunch of seasonings.  Think, mexican home cooking.  I used 3 cans of salsa verde and cooked for about an hour until most of the liquid had evaporated.  I made it into tacos and beef and bean burritos.  I worried that it would be too spicy.  I used one huge rounded tip jalapeno.  It had a lot of flavor.  I didn't have to add hot sauce or sour cream.

Excellent with thin-sliced venison too! YUM!! I didn't even have the green onions and I used homemade salsa verde. Instead of simmering ten minutes, I put the mixture in the pressure cooker for about 6 minutes to tenderize. A crockpot would be a great option too!

I think this is really good. I make this in the slow cooker and serve it with my own version of Jeera rice in the rice cooker. Perfect for a work day.

Oh so good....!! followed the the recipe... except used a 16oz jar of mild salsa verde.
After browning the meat... I put everything in the crock-pot for 5 hours. Meat was really tender and all the flavors blended nicely! I can't wait to share this recipe with my Mexican sister in law... think she will be impressed!
Thanks for submitting it.. :)

This was yummy!  However, like others have said, if you use stew meat, you really, really need to simmer it for a long time to get the meat tender.  If you don't have time, then use a tender cut of meat like sirloin tips.  I ended up, out of neccessity, simmering it for 3 hours and it was wonderful!  I'm going to try it in my slow cooker all day next time.

This would also be great with chicken or pork.  I need to double the recipe next time because we didn't have enough leftovers for all the work/time.

I did have some leftovers over a mixture of steamed white and wild rice and it was a wonderful combination.

Originally I served this as a filling with sharp cheddar/jack cheese in flour tortillas!  YUMMY!  This is a keeper!

**Added** I made this a second time in the crock pot and it was great!  I browned the meat with the seasonings, onion, and garlic, then put it in the crock and then poured the sauce over it.  I used more salsa this time (16 oz to 1.3 lbs meat), added a half-can of tomato paste I had in the fridge, and some diced potatoes.  Awesome!  I cooked it on low for 8 hours.

Great meal!  I left out the peppers and it was still plenty spicy (I suppose it depends on the brand of salsa verde you use).  I mixed in a big scoop of sour cream at the end.  On a warm tortilla...yum!

This was a good recipe. It was very flavorful and it had an unexpected bite to it, which my husband and I enjoyed.  Thanks for sharing it!  

One change: I would add a little more olive oil than the recipe recommends when browning the beef.

My family and friends loved this recipe, although, I did add some stuff. I added potatoes, carrots, and peas...to make it a more all around dish. Otherwise, the spicing and flavor were absolutely perfect! And, a note, the brand of salsa you use will make a difference.

I guess I'm the odd man out on this recipe.  We thought it was good, but we were not as impressed as the other reviewers.  I made it exactly as written, but it was a little dry and bland.  I probably won't make this again since there are better recipes available.

An instant favorite!  My family said it was better than our favorite burrito take out!  I use cut up chicken breast instead of beef.  Next time I'll try shredded chicken so the meat and sauce blend together.

Tasty, though I used regular picante sauce instead of green salsa. I had 1 1/3 pounds of meat, so I adjusted the other ingredients accordingly. Instead of jalepeno, I used one anaheim pepper. This smells great, tastes really good and we ate it over white rice that had a bit of chili powder, oregano, salt/pepper and garlic powder added.

Seared the beef etc. off in a pan and deglazed with 1/3 cup of tequila. (Inhaled vapor, oops!) Poured beef, liquids and everything else into the crock pot and cooked for a bit over 4hrs. WOW!

This was very tasty, but I would use red salsa or tomato sauce instead of or in addition to the green salsa to ease the sourness. Note: cook the onions till translucent before adding the meat, and the onions will caramelize and sweeten dish.  Recipe makes enough for four ample servings.  I made it last night, and brought leftovers to work for my lunch.

This is fantastic!  I sautéed the onions with the Jalapino and added a fresh Poblano, diced along with the garlic to a dry pan.  Once softened, I added the stew meat with avocado Oil.  Slightly browned the meat then added fresh green salsa and Mexican Oregano and 1/2 lime, juiced.  Simmered for about three hours until the meat was tender.  Added fresh green onions and Cilantro.

My family loves this recipe.  My kids loved it, never any leftovers.  I have tried with mild salsa verde and with the spicy green chiles, and it needs the spicy otherwise it falls a little flat. This has become a regular dish in out rotation.

I hosted a book club meeting this weekend, and I made a Mexican-inspired meal to go along with our book of choice, set in Mexico. This recipe was delicious! I made a few adjustments for personal taste--I double the lime, jalapeños, and the salsa verde. I left it in the slow cooker for about three hours, and the meat was delicious and tender. I served it with toasted corn tortillas, sour cream, a side of cucumber salsa, and flan for dessert. What a hit!

This recipe was wonderful but i did cook it down for about an hour and added beef broth while simmering. i added extra cilantro and i think it was too much but everyone else loved it.

This was very good and easy to make.  I used a 7oz can of Herdez green salsa.  Next time I will add a lot more garlic and cilantro and another jalapeño.  I also simmered it for around an hour to make the meat tender.  Thanks for sharing I will make this again.

Amazing flavor!  I cannot believe my children loved it too!  It was not too spicy for me at all, but worried for my kiddos I did add about 1/4 cup sour cream to sauce.  We will be making this again and again!  Thank you for the recipe!

Great flavor.  When I make it next time I'll likely do shredded beef rather than cubed.  The look with the salsa verde was a bit scary, but it was delicious!

Oh My Gosh!!  This is so good!  I made it just as stated except no green onions (I forgot to buy them).  It had the perfect amount of heat.  My DH literally licked his plate! :) Served on tortillas with a mild cheddar and sour cream. LOVE IT! I lived in south TX for years before moving north.  This reminds me of the food we used to eat there and have a hard time finding up here!  Thanks!

This was very good, and surprisingly quick.  I gave it five stars because of its easiness and it's adaptability because you can modify to fit what you have on hand. I did not use a jalapeno or green onions as I did not have either.  I used fresh red salsa in place of green salsa (again did not have), and I added about 1/2 cup of fresh chopped tomatoes.  I doubled the cilantro because I love the flavor.  I served it with sour cream which was great because it cooled off my mouth from the heat.  Overall a great recipe to have.

This was a very good dish.The only things that I did different was to
boil the stew meat in beef broth.
I transfered the stew meat to a 
skillet and cooked the vegetables
along with the meat.You need the
flavor of the onion and garlic in
the meat.I used 1/4 cup lime juice.
I poured the lime juice in the
one can of chili verde sauce that
covered the meat.I only had one
package of stew meat so one can
of salsa was sufficient.I used
this meat for soft Tacos and
served it with homemade spanish
rice.Everyone loved it.

This is a very authentic recipe. I browned the meat with the onoions and garlic then put everything in the slow cooker for 3 hours on high. Next time I'm going to try this recipe with a flank steak and I will shred the meat after for burritos.

This is a very good, and forgiving recipe as long as you do as other reviewers have done and simmer it longer. I ended up burning it a little because I didnt add water, but it was still fantastic. I've never had cilantro/lemon beef before, but I certainly will in the future. It's a great blend of flavors. 

It's also a great way to make use of cheap cuts of beef to stretch a dollar. 

Minor addition: We had some frozen shrimp in the freezer. As the beef was finishing up, I sauteed them in olive oil with some leftover cilantro. When the shrimp was nearly done, I mixed in the beef mixture and pretty much just let it warm for a few minutes. The shrimp had a nice light flavor which complemented the beef very nicely.

This was really good! I used hot salsa verde, and the jalapeno. I love spicy food, but that was a bit much, it overpowered the other flavors. The meat was a bit tough for me, but I think that it would be okay if it was cut into smaller peices. Next time I am going to try making it with green bell pepper instead of onions and garlic.

Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! A new family favourite. 

I skipped the jalep. as my husband is super-sensitive to them, but I substituted a spicy green salsa for the kick. Also,I used white onions and they got too mushy, so I recommend a sturdier onion.  

I think I'll try it with shredded meat next time and serve it in tortillas. 

*** I made this again while visiting family, only I used leftover cooked chicken and served it in tortillas - they LOVED it!

This is an awesome recipe. My husband is from Mexico and he loved this recipe when I made it tonight. My husband and kids asked me to make it at least once a week. I took some reviews and combined them. My grocery store didn't have stew meat so I used round steak and diced it real small. I cooked the onions and garlic in a little oil. After a few minutes I added the beef(and salt) and cooked the meat until browned. Next I added the cilantro mixture. Finally I took the pan with the meat, onions and cilantro mixture and added it to my crockpot. I then added two 7 ounce cans of green salsa. I let it cook in my crockpot on low for about 6 hours. The meat was very tender. We made soft tacos with the meat and served mexican rice on the side. Thanks for an amazing recipe.

I wondered about using stew meat when I first read this recipe. The meat really turned out very chewy and tough. Although the flavor of the sauce was very good, would use some other meat next time. Also used more than the 7 ozs. of sauce the recipe called for. Other than that this recipe really is very good.

We loved this!  I did find that you really need to cook the stew beef a bit longer.  Even my picky eaters raved.  I tried it again on a weekend and did it in the crock pot.  Outstanding.  I even added 2 whole jalapenos to cook all day with it.  Wonderful flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe was darn good! 

I used ground beef as opposed to 'beef stew meat', and decided not to serve it with rice & beans... but instead with bite size tortilla chips! (which could could also double for an appetizer for potlucks etc.).  Hmmm, not a bad idea!!!  

I added sour cream added as a garnish later.  Yum, yum!

This was great! I did take others advice and add sour cream at the end and I'm glad I did because this was a spicy one.

This was great! I wasn't sure if it would be for me but the whole family loved it. I simmered it for over an hour and a half, not sure how anyone could eat the beef at 10 minutes, it was way too tough, but after simmering it was tender! I will make this again!

Being for New Mexico, we eat a lot of green chili and different types of peppers but this dish had a different favor than we are use to in this state. The use of lime and cilantro was excellent! I will make this again.

My son has lived in Mexico for over a year.  I made this recipe for him and we all loved it.  It was more than enough for 3 big appetites.  I served it with refried beans, spanish rice and tortillas.  I used tenderized cube steak, cut up.  I forgot to pull out the sour cream.  It was still very good.

This recipe is EXCELLENT.  I used Old El Paso green chile sauce for the salsa and cooked it a bit longer.  I also used a chuck roast which I cubed instead of stew meat.  WONDERFUL!

We have been making this for years. I usually add a lot more green salsa and simmer until meat is tender. The last couple of time we have used this to make Empanadas. I used pre made pie crust. It is so good!

Very tasty!  Instead of stew meat and cutting that into smaller pieces, I used beef for stir fry- perfect size.  Let the mixture simmer on low for about an hour before using it for enchiladas.  Family loved it!

I made this recipe today. I followed the recipe, but did make a few changes.  

My experience for using beef stew meat to make beef stew or vegetable beef soup has not been good. Even cooking beef stew meat in a crockpot for hours, the beef is tough & chewy. So I used a pound of sirloin steak cut into 3/4” cubes.

I didn’t have a lime, so I left that out.  I used about 10 oz. jar of green salsa & a small can of mild diced green chile peppers.  To have enough liquid I poured in 1 cup of beef broth. 

I felt the recipe needed some tomato flavor, I added 1/2 cup of crushed tomatoes (Cento brand is the best)

I let the meat mixture simmer on low heat for 1-1/2 hours. I add cilantro near the end. The sauce thickened slowly, but never dried out.

I served the Mexican Beef Supreme with seasoned pinto beans, white rice & hot flour tortillas. My husband & I thought it was delicious!

I used leftover smoked brisket for this recipe.  Added lots of cumin, garlic, a can of black beans, and a few tomatoes we had here.  Served over quinoa which I cooked in chicken bouillon.  It tasted quite good.  May be good with the addition of shredded cheese, but DH is not a big cheese fan, so left that out.  This is a good way to use up leftover brisket

Followed recipe exactly except for adding an entire jar of green salsa. Used Pace. It had the lowest sodium of all the brands at my grocery store. I used 2lbs bottom round cut into smaller chunks. Served over white rice, with refried beans and garnished with some fresh cilantro, tomatoes and additional diced jalapeño. I will definitely make again and try it with chicken next time.

I added a couple of Anaheim peppers and let it all stew for a couple of hours. My wife had never had Carne Guisado before so she didn’t know what to expect. One bite and she raved about how tasty it was. There was a little left over and she let me know in no uncertain terms SHE (feather than me) would be taking it to work for lunch tomorrow.

I had this for my dinner over rice but I added more verde sauce and let the meat slowly simmer for an hour and a half , very tender , and added a chopped bell pepper and can of whole green ortega peppers as well  /  use this if you don't want to make your own green sauce , tomatillos , peppers , onion , garlic and seasoning from scratch / make sure to add enough so the meat does not dry out on a long slow simmer / 1 bottle seems to do the trick / Couldn't add photo when I say " use this "  but I used one 24 oz. bottle of Herdez Salsa Verde / green

I rarely write recipe reviews.  This on is worth reviewing with hopes of helping others. The taste is wonderful, so I want to say that right up front. It struck me as odd when I read the recipe that the beef stew meat doesn't actually "stew" for awhile, yet I chose to I make this exactly as the recipe instructed. .  Stew meat is very tough and meant to tenderize during the long stewing process.  Sure enough, our meat was super tough when following the instructions for cooking time.  I highly suggest using a better quality beef if you want to cook it fast.  If you want to use the tougher beef sold as stew meat and actually let it stew for several hours, the recipe might need to be altered to add more liquid.  I will probably also add green peppers for an added vegetable if I make this again.

I just made this tonight and everyone in the house loved it from the 82 year old to the 7 year old!  I made it exactly like stated except I didn't have any stew meat so I cut up some New York Strip Steaks I had in the freezer.  We served over rice.  So delicious!  I highly recommend it.

I made this as written.  Loved it.  On the verge of being too spicy for me & just right for my husband.  More flavor than heat.  Will be making again.  Would like to try in the slow cooker next.

Delicious! I followed a lot of the suggestions from other reviewers. I added twice as much green salsa and a can of green (mild) chiles, added extra jalapenos, more garlic and cooked in my multipot using the stew function, which cooks under pressure for one hour. I also added two cobs worth of fresh, sweet corn. Only added half the cilantro and had cilantro and additional scallions at the table for people to add as desired. This recipe is very good. If you don't like a lot of heat and spice, don't add extra jalapenos or use hot green salsa.

Good flavors throughout! My mom always added potatoes to hers so I used this recipe and added potatoes while the beef was cooking and simmered until they were perfect! Yum! Love it!

This was delicious! I cooked the beef a bit longer until it was tender and almost pulling apart. The flavors and ingredients were spot on and my family loved it! I’ll definitely be making this again. Thanks!

Browned the beef onions and garlic in a pan, then transferred to a crockpot where I added the other ingredients, and cooked on low for 8 hours. My family enjoyed this in tacos. Very good.

Wonderful and easy recipe. Only change I made was to use sirloin tips instead of stew meat so I was able to cook for less time. VERY flavorful and I added a bit of cayenne pepper as I like a lot of heat. I also used a jar of Pace green salsa as I could not find a can.
Will absolutely make this again!

It was rather flat tasting.  There was some heat from the pepper and sauce that carried it.  Combined with burrito ingredients, it was good.  It didn’t stand alone.

Made this fabulous recipe twice, first time as is ,the second with these changes: add a can of rinsed beans ( black, pinto, kidney) , and a cup of corn (canned or frozen) before simmering everything together at very low heat for for at least 2 hours more. THIS IS ESSENTIAL! Served the beef in tortillas, as burritos, sprinkled with shredded cheese, baked for 20 minutes on greased cookie sheet. Serve with additional shredded cheese, salsa, and sour cream on the side. I would have taken a photo, but they were eaten too quickly! My wonderful hubs was over the moon with delight.

I cooked this last weekend.  I added a can of diced tomatoes and cooked it for about two and a half hours.  Was really great and reminded me of a dish that I used to get from a mexican restaurant in Denver, CO.  I would add more Jalepenos....like twice as much.

Yes, we loved it! I cooked the stew beef in insta pot, to get it super tender, then basically followed the recipe. Served in small flour tortillas with hot pepper cheese, black beans and sour cream. Super easy week night dinner for me and hubby.

Stewing beef does not cook by being browned and then simmering for 10 minutes. Would try it again with a more tender cut.  Used cross rib, knowing stew meat would not be tender after browning and 10 minutes.  Still tough, cooked for another 1/2 hour.

Awesome meal.  Easy to prepare.  Always add a little bit more cilantro and lime juice and most certainly add sour cream for that added creaminess and taste

Delicious!! I did take some liberties but pretty much stuck to the general recipe. I substituted lean ground beef for the stew meat which I thought would go over better with the kids and used a jar of chilies instead of a jalapeño. I used all the ingredients to taste and added a little salt and pepper. I think it’s a little saucy to serve in tortillas but it was doable. I tried it both mixing in the sour cream and as a garnish. Both were good. I served it with a side of yellow rice with red beans. Will definitely make it this way again. Maybe will try with shredded beef.

Everyone said it tasted good (even the girl!), but commented that it was a bit spicier than they liked.  I substituted about half of a large Anaheim pepper for the jalapeno.  Next time I'll just omit the pepper completely.  Tasted after about an hour and sprinkled in a little cumin.  Skipped cilantro because we don't like it, and forgot the green onions at the end.  Served with low sodium yellow rice (from a mix -- next time I'll fix from scratch), and Taco Slaw from this site.  Enjoyed the crunch of the slaw with it, but I might be just as happy with crunchy shredded lettuce.  Also, next time I think I'll just buy a chunk of beef and cut it up myself.   ~~~Thanks for the recipe!

Very good! I didn't have any salsa verde on hand so I substituted some leftover red salsa from our favorite Mexican restaurant. It was delicious. Next time I would use a bit less salsa because I found that there was a too much liquid coming out of the tortillas.

When shopping for ingredients we got green pepper instead of green onion...oops.  So we ended up using 1 green pepper and no green onions. My fiance said he never wanted tacos any other way though!  Yummo!

I'm going to have to try this again, it was a little spicy, gravy was dark but good. How ever the meat was tough. I think that was cause  by me. As I said I'm going to try it again.

The first time I made this recipe, I made it "as is", with the exception of stirring in 1 cup of sour cream at the end.  It was awesome, although a little spicy.  The second time I made from leftover roast, that I had shredded and only used half the amount of jalapeno.  My family loved it!

i loved the recipe. The only thing i thought was a bit much was the 1/2 cup of lime juice maybe 1/4 would have been on the money because it was very tangy. Other than that its wonderful and easy to do. I used my mixture to make fajitas and my husband and kids ate every bit.

I made this recipe last night for my husband who is also mexican.  It was fantastic!! I pretty much made it as written except I cubed the steak into small cubes and cooked it for about 40 minutes.  I also doubled the salsa verde.  I served it with black refried beans, whole grain spanish rice.  I slightly browned some corn tortillas in the frying pan with some oil so we could make tacos.  A little sour cream on the tortilla, beans, rice and the meat mixture and presto...an awesome dinner.  My husband loved it.  I will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

great recipe..simple to make.got back from the grocery store without the green salsa or the beef(oops) so I improvised by using chicken tenders from the butcher,cut up small, which made for a shorter cooking time and red salsa...it was wonderful no leftovers.I'll make a larger batch next time..good job boyfriend and Melissa for sharing this recipe..

All this is, is a quick not so good version of chile verde. The beef was tough & the sauce was ordinary. I will not be making this again.

Very good!  I had to cook the beef quite a bit longer than stated for it to be tender though.  I served it with tortillas but it would be good with rice because there was a lot of sauce.

Perfect. Adding to the weekly menu. I used beef the first time. Then used pork. Both were great. Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely fantastic!  I used chicken instead of beef and added some corn at the end, otherwise I left the recipe alone.  The finished product is the perfect spiciness with a splash of lime. The onions and cilantro added great flavor. I will definitely make this recipe again and double it for friends! Great with Spanish rice and sour cream!

This was good, although it needed more salsa...turned out a bit dry for our taste. We also will try it with rice the next time, I only had tostadas available and it just didn't work out. Went well with refried beans.

Very tasty.  I also let it simmer on very low for a long time, until the liquid reduced.  Made for tastier beef.

Incredibly easy and oh so good!  Reminded me of a dish I had in Mexico at a little outdoor cafe'.  I didn't have green salsa so I used green chili enchilada sauce.  Worked great!

This was great!  I am always trying to make great mexican food, but never do a very good job.  My husband and I loved it.  It had a great flavor.  I didn't have a fresh lime so I used lime juice, which I put too much in but it was still great.  Also, the cilantro can be overwhelming, so go light on it if you don't love an intense cilantro flavor.  Great recipe!  Thanks for the submission.

My husband and son loved this recipe. I thought it might be too "hot" for them but it wasn't at all.  I topped with more cheese, enchalada sauce, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes and a dallop of sour cream.  My husband said is was as good as any restaurant! This will go into our monthly rotation.  I might suggest Beano as a side dish! :)

Hey Melissa! I hope you marry that man, don’t let a cook like that get away! This was a very good and I would say authentic dish. It was very easy to prepare. Reminiscent of Rachael Ray's 30 minute meals! It goes together nicely and inexpensive to make as well. The only think I personally would say I did not like was the spicy factor (I even seeded the  pepper as most of the heat is in the seeds). BUT I am a huge wimp when it comes to spice; my husband on the other hand loved it and felt it too be too mild! I will make it again and use half of the jalapeno (he has a cabinet of hot sauce that one of which would compliment this well). The spice really does enhance the flavor so it would be foolish to leave it out. We served this on tortillas, but tastes just as good over the yellow rice we served with it. I served with sour cream as well (A LOT, helped tone down the spice!). ALSO! Please be careful cutting those darn peppers! I got the pepper juice under a few of my nails! OUCH! I was up all night will burning fingers! This was definitely a hit and I am holding on to this one and will make it again. FINALLY I have found a good recipe here again. I have had quite a few misses from here recently. This recipe alone has redeemed all recipes for me!

Was not as impressed as the other reviewer.  This was fair at best.  Don't know what it needs.
