This has a great flavor, and I am enjoying it reheated days later. However, I'm so glad I didn't put it in the crock pot overnight. I made this during the day because I was skeptical of the long cooking time. I checked it at 4 1/2 hours, and it was already sticking very badly to the pot and just about to burn. Next time, I would either decrease the oats to 1 3/4 cup or increase the water by at least 1/2 cup, and only cook for 4 hours. It is very tasty though!
