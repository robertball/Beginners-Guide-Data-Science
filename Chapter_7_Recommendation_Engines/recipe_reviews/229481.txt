Works flawlessly for mixed drinks, but it's much sweeter than simple syrup, so adjust accordingly. The key to the incomplete dissolving of the crystals is to mix the Truvia and water, bring it to a boil in a medium saucepan, and boil until all crystals are dissolved. Remove it from heat and allow it to cool on the stove. I double the recipe and store it in a sealed container in the fridge. 

I mean, I couldn't see myself coating the rim of my margarita glass with Truvia, but it's nice to be able to indulge in mixed drinks while saving a few calories.

If you have an electric teakettle & a Pyrex dish or measuring cup, just boil the water in the kettle and pour it over the Truvia in the Pyrex.  It instantly dissolves-- no heating in a saucepan on the stove needed!

Definitely a very "simple" recipe for simple syrup! And while the truvia doesn't dissolve completely it worked for "Light Delight Sauza(R)-Rita.

Never really could get the Truvia completely dissolved, but it tastes OK.  Needed this for a margarita.

To help dissolve, simply employ the recipe instructions to make a simple syrup:  heat the water and Truvia in a saucepan until all crystals are dissolved, to just beginning to boil...then cool and store in refrigerator...Enjoy!
