This cheese dip is amazing as well as decorative. I just use the spices in my cabinet, so that it doesn't become a big expense. I didn't think I would like the red bell peppers, but they add a nice taste. Making it into a candy cane shape is actually very easy even though it looks a bit intimidating! Just refrigerate it and then it smooths right out. Well worth it.

I served this for Christmas last year and it was a huge hit.  The presentation is wonderful, and it tastes terrific.  After the party was done I mashed it all together, and it was even better with the red peppers mixed in. One more thing,  I put the red peppers in the food processor and chopped them almost to a pulp.  Then I squeezed all the juice through a strainer, and spread them with a spatula and used a butter knife to create straight edges.  They stuck really well.

I made this for Christmas last year and it was really cute.  The flavor was nothing spectacular, just like any other cheeseball, and the placement of the red peppers to create stripes was time consuming, but it definitely had a good presentation.

Ok, the recipe for the cheese log is fine, however I had trouble with the decorating.  The chopped pepper wouldn't stay on the log and kept falling off the sides.  The juice from the pepper also tended to bleed onto the log.  I have been doing Christmas cooking all day and this was the only flop that I have had.  I ended up scraping the pepper off and dividing the candy cane into three smaller logs.
Gave it a try but wont be making it again. sorry.
