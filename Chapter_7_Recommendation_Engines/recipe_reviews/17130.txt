I agree this is one of the fastest ways to impress people I've discovered.  I've tried this recipe with store-bought Alfredo sauce before, and we found it way too sweet--mind you, it was because of the paticular sauce we chose.  A quick suggestion if you don't have the ready-made sauce on hand: saute 2-3 cloves minced garlic in some butter, add the mushrooms and saute for 2 or 3 minutes, add 1 tablespoon of flour to 2 cups milk, then add to mushrooms, simmer until thick and then add 1/3 cup parmesan cheese -- voila! A low fat alfredo with delicious mushroom taste!

My husband and I both loved this recipe!  Don't forget to scrape the "gills" out from the underside of the mushroom, that way the sauce won't turn the purple/brown color some people complained about.  I added yellow bell pepper, zucchini, broccoli, cherry tomatoes and carrots as well.  Then instead of mixing it all together I just spooned the sauce on top of the noodles and topped it with the mushrooms and veggies.  Very delicious and beautiful presentation!

I started hunting around for an alfredo sauce recipe after reading Katya's review.  I used the quick and easy alfredo sauce recipe from here(think thats the same one she got from here).  It made a huge difference.  The dish went from a good one to an excellent one.  The sauce definitely transformed it.  I also added mozarella to the top after I was done to make it more cheesy.  We LOVE this recipe now. I think what I made at home was as good or better than the local restaurant version.  I'm glad I have a treadmill.......lotta calories in this one!

I made this at a grocery store demo and it went over very well.  To cut the fat, I made a low fat alfredo sauce.  This is very delicious and I'll definitely make this again!

This was quick and easy. I used a larger jar of sauce 16 ounces. Next time I think I will add some peas.

The first time I made this, we couldn't eat it...but it wasn't the recipe's fault.  I had never used any jarred sauces and thought I would try one here.  For heaven's sake, take a little extra time and make your own.  As soon as I opened the jar, I knew we wouldn't enjoy it.  The smell is absolutely disgusting...it reminded me of my baby's infant formula...you know that iron-rich fake milk smell?  Needless to say, we tried again with a homemade sauce and it was superb.  Do yourself a favor, unless you have experienced and liked (although I cannot fathom why) the jarred alfredo sauces (even the more expensive ones, which is what I bought, just to be sure), MAKE YOUR OWN ALFREDO SAUCE!  You won't be disappointed...although you may be if you don't!

This was delicious, would definately make again.I used baby bella mushrooms instead of portobello's, and added some sliced red pepper to the mix. I also made my own alfredo instead of the stuff in a jar, the "Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce" recipe from this site (which was also delicious!). My only problem was after adding the alfredo to the wine/garlic/veggie mix, the sauce was too thin so I allowed it to simmer a bit and thicken up. But I must say.....this dish blew me and my boyfriend away, the rest of the wine used to cook in this recipe we finished off with the meal, PERFECT!!!!

This was an excellent meatless dinner along with a green salad and a glass of red wine.  I used the sun-dried tomato alfredo sauce and asiago-garlic stuffed ravioli, and with the mushrooms we didn't miss the meat at all (and we are meat lovers)!  Thank you for a great and quick recipe.

This was good but very rich.  The color wasn't appealing so I wouldn't serve it to company.  I might make it again but use button mushrooms.

This was wonderful! Make sure that you do NOT use a jar sauce but make your own. making your own is just to simple and I do beleive all jar sauces taste like dog gravy. I did add chicken, if i were to make this again and add chicken i would make sure that the chicken was in small peices and not large ones although this recipe is good without the meat. I bought my mushrooms presliced so I didnt have to do anything to them but wash. If you want a all in one pot meal excluding the noodles. after the mushrooms are ready add half a package of creamcheese when that has melted in add about 3/4 cup of milk (or till right consistancy) when that has heated thru add 1/2 to 3/4 package of parmasian. becuase the recipe already called for garlic you do not need to add more and you have your alfredo sauce without needing to make it in a different pan. If you want more sauce simply add more creamcheese and more milk. salt and pepper to taste. I also had left over sauce with no noodles and put the sauce over bow-tie noodles the next day...and it was just as good if not better heated up the second day. ALSO Please do not give this recipe a bad review if you used jar sauce or your alfredo sucked as the recipe does not say use a jar sauce. For then you would be rating the recipe on your failer to provide a good alfredo.

This was very good, but the alfredo sauce makes such a big difference in the taste, I would have preferred a recipe for it or a recommendation for a good jar.

This is a great dish! The one thing I would have to say is use the fresh alfredo sauce that you get in the refrigerated section (if you don't make your own). The stuff that comes in the jar is horrible. Thanks for such an easy and elegant recipe!

This was fine.  For the amount of fat and calories I wish it was better. I'd recommend doubling the amount of mushrooms.  I did make my own alfredo as I’ve never found one in a jar that I like.  I think a vodka sauce would have been very good and a little healthier.  Steamed broccoli also would have been a nice addition.

Loved this. I don't like jarred alfredo sauces, so I took another reviewer's advice and, after sauteeing the mushrooms in the white wine, I added a TBSP of flour (or so) and let that cook a little. Then I added skim milk and a few TBSPs of half-and-half and let that thicken. MUCH lighter than alfredo and ABSOLUTELY YUMMY. Will definitely make this again!

This was very good.  Could have used a little extra something, not quite sure what.  Maybe more wine?  I made the 'Alfredo Light' with it.  It all went together very well.  If serving as a main course, it wouldn't be enough to serve.  Next time I'll use regular pasta for less fat and more attention on the mushrooms.

I was looking for a relatively quick dinner and this hit the spot! I added chicken (cooked it in the frying pan first) and red peppers for some color. I used regular mushrooms since I didn't have any portabellos. So easy, but so Good!!

While I am not a fan of alfredo sauce in a jar, this recipe was quite good--must have been the addition of the white wine (I used a dry chardonnay). I also used baby portobello mushrooms which worked out well. I have tried it with cheese ravioli as well as the tortellini and both are delicious.

I thought this was just ok. I followed the recipe exactly, and made my own alfredo sauce. The portobello sauce was very thin and I didn't think it had much flavor. My husband liked the plain alfredo sauce better than the portobello sauce. Overall, I don't think I'll make this again.

This was great. I used Alfredo Sauce from Rebecca's recipe on this site, and also tossed in some of the sun dried tomatoes I've been making (also with advice from AR!). Very yummy. Thanks so much.

This dish is amazing! I made this for a potluck and it was gone in minutes.  This will be one of my favorites for years to come.

Delicious!  I skipped the storebought alfredo sauce and did as another member suggested by using milk, flour, and garlic.  I also added zucchini and red bell pepper. Will definitely be making this again!

Wonderful!  I used light cheese tortellini and made my own light Alfredo sauce.  I like a little kick, so I threw a bunch of red pepper and some jalapeño juice in it, which turned out great.  I'll definitely make this again for company or a nice treat, but it needs some color--perhaps some roasted red pepper, artichoke heart...something.

we love this recipe - quick easy and so yummy! the portobellos lend such a savory flavor to the cheesy tortellini. we've made this twice this month and my hubby is still craving it, so it looks like we will add it to the rotation.

** EDIT: Several years later, we STILL make this at least once every couple months. It never fails to satisfy.

I made this dish last night and thought it was excellent!  The only thing I would do different next time I make it (which I definitely will) would be to make more sauce.  I had to spread the sauce pretty thin to cover four servings.

very good.  made w/out wine didn't have any.  And grilled caps prior to adding them.  I took the advice from another review and used the quick and easy alfredo sauce.  That was a great combination.  Will make again.

Delicious IF you make your own alfredo sauce. I make a lower fat version buy using reduced fat cream cheese.

This was great!!! I truely loved it. And I'm not the best cook, I did use a jar Alfredo Sauce and mine was very good! I used Bertorlli Alfredo sauce with Mushrooms and still added the other cooked mushrooms as well! And also tossed in shrimp as well.

Perfect as is!! My kids love alfredo but it bores me. I wanted to add portobello mushrooms and stumbled on this recipe. It turned out delicious!! I used jarred Alfredo by Bertolli - I'm a working mom and keep it on hand for quicker meal nights. Would love to try it with fresh. My son told me it was "SO good".  Thanks for giving us a change of the same ole same ole :-)

5 stars with homemade Alfredo. Used jarred 'shrooms because that's what I keep on hand.  Do yourself a favor and don't use pre-made Alfredo;  The outcome is very different between the jarred stuff and real sauce!

This was good but a little too rich for me.  I used the alfredo sauce from the first reviewer below which was great but needed to add a ton of salt (and then handfuls of more parmesan) and more seasonings to combat the blandness from the tortellini. Used a mix of spinach/cheese tortellini for a tiny bit of added healthiness.

Great meal!  Used "Quick and Easy Alfredo" instead of salty store bought and it was great.  Very rich, though.  Next time I might try to make a roux like another person recommended.

Superb meal, especially if you love mushrooms.  Used 1 pound of fresh 4-cheese tortellini, 2 large sliced portobello mushrooms (gills spooned out), 5 sliced crimini mushrooms and s&p to taste.  No parsley and no garlic, as I used the Quick Alfredo Sauce (by distasi) which already used 2 cloves of fresh garlic.  Also did not need to top the finished dish with parm cheese because the yummy sauce contained enough cheese already (and it was relatively healthier that way).

Made the pasta in a separate pot, made mushrooms in a frying pan and then mixed them into the pot that contained the alfredo sauce.  Spooned the sauce mixture over the pasta to make a restaurant-quality meal.  Delicious!  My bf rated it 9.5 out of 10, and I would give it 10/10.

I thought this was really tasty.  One of my children liked it and the other didn't.  I was surprised how thin the sauce was but maybe that was due to the sauce I bought.  Overall very good and tasty.  I will definitely make this again.

No jarred pasta sauce here, I just used a basic alfredo sauce from this site I'd used before. Instead of using all cream, I cut back on the amount called for and added in the white wine called for. I did add one sliced onion in with the garlic. I really liked this as did my oldest boy. My husband and youngest did not. I'd make this again  but perhaps for several lunches during the week. This was both simple and decadent.

Very, very nice dish. So easy to make. Nice balance between the pasta, the portobellos, and the white wine. Only change was to use dried parsley as it's so wasteful to buy a whole pkge of fresh for limited use. Will definitely do this one again.

LOVE this!  Perfect for an easy meal that tastes like you really worked at it.  I use baby bella mushrooms, saute them in a little butter for awhile until they are really soft and then add the garlic, wine and parsley.  I have used refrigerated alfredo and also made my own-both were great!  (I too can't stand the jarred alfredo but the refrigerated is pretty good.)

Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent dish! I love tortellini, mushrooms, garlic and Alfredo so this ounded so good and it was! I did make my Alfredo sauce from scratch and added some sauted fresh baby spinach.

I made this as a quick dinner last night, and I was not disappointed! I added red peppers, zucchini, and extra garlic to give it a little more and if I make it again I'll be adding even more veggies and perhaps cutting down the portobellos (I found there was just a little too much). I wasn't disappointed with the Alfredo sauce I used, but I did splurge on the "good stuff." Big hit, the boyfriend said "oh, this is what tortellini is SUPPOSED to taste like!"

I used the quick and easy alfredo sauce recipe from here and made sure to scoop out the mushroom gills as recommended by reviewers. The end result was delicious, although what could possibly be bad about tortellini and mushrooms in a cream sauce?

Great with a little tweaking. If you saute your mushrooms in butter to cook the liquid out of them before adding the wine, it will really reduce that unlovely purple-ish color of the finished sauce. Jarred Alfredo is a little thick and salty for me, so I added some milk at the end.  I also added fresh parsley and a hit of nutmeg. Even better to add some chopped tomatoes to the top when serving to lighten it up a little. This is a great recipe to play with - and I did. :) My oldest son loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I took the advice of the other reviewers and made my own alfredo sauce the "easy alfredo" sauce on this site. It really made a huge different and was really easy to make. I sauteed the mushrooms and drained off the excess wine and set aside and used the same sauce pan for the alfredo and then added the mushrooms back. Then I poured it over the tortellini and tossed to mix. So yummy. I will definitely be adding this to my permanent collection.

This was a delicious, easy recipe! It was easy to chop and saute the mushrooms while the water for the pasta boiled! I think that next time I might try white button mushrooms or crimini just to give it a different taste and make a low fat homemade alfredo sauce instead of a jarred one. However, the addition of wine and parsley makes the jarred sauce taste much more natural and tasty than just using it normally!

This was nice and super fast and easy to make which is a huge plus on a weekday night, but I didn't find it that mind-blowing. Used regular mushrooms and a four-cheese sauce, and I used the same amount of sauce for half the pasta (so practically doubled the sauce) and it was by no means too much. I thought it tasted a little bland so I added some more herbs, a bit of nutmeg and garlic powder. With the improvements it still wasn't 'absolutely fabulous' but I did enjoy it with a glass of wine. Might make it again if I feel like totellini.

I've made this twice now, both times altering the ingredients slightly to accommodate my fridge... and both times equally delicious.

The first time I only had button mushrooms, the second time I added in spinach and sun-dried tomatoes. Both times, I used Vodka sauce instead to make it a little healthier. It really is absolutely fabulous!

I made this for 30 women at a bridal shower and they all just loved it. The alfredo sauce I choose to use was just the simple Rago Light Alfredo. I also did not measure out the wine I just added until I thought the smell was right. Thanks for the great recipe!

I liked, my husband really liked.  I couldn't find an 8 oz. jar of alfredo, so used the 15 oz. one but increased the wine to 2/3 cup.  Pretty good.  I did scrape the gills.  I did not double the mushrooms.  Might do that next time, but that is a lot of the cost, so maybe not.  My two little girls (3 yrs. and 19 mos.) did not like the sauce.

My husband and I both thought this was tasty although a little expensive to make (prepackaged tortellini & sauce plus portobellos). I wish I had scooped the dark brown "gills" out from underneath the mushroom caps though. They made the sauce look greyish which wasn't very appetizing.

This went together very fast.  Don't cut the mushrooms too small, or they will dissapear in the sauce.  I added some peas to this and it went well.  If you make too much, it doesn't store very well.  Many of the girls in my hall went back for seconds, but I can think of better ways to use the mushrooms.

Wonderful! Since I didn't have tortellini, I substituted it with penne. Also I made my own Alfredo sauce. It was still great! I skipped the wine, though XD
Over all, it was the best Alfredo-sauced dish I have ever tasted!!

So good!  I used homemade alfredo sauce.  Next time I think I'll add some spinach, but it is delicious as is.

I loved this recipe! It was so easy and quick! The only things I did extra were add Parmesan cheese straight into the sauce and also added sauteed spinach for some color and extra flavor. It was perfect. I'll definitely keep this one on rotation in my house!

I made these using spinach cheese ravioli and it was very filling with the portobello mushrooms.  Yummy addition to our recipe box.

I really liked the flavor of this. I used Newman's Own alfredo sauce. I'm not a huge fan of jarred alfredo sauce but once it's mixed with the mushrooms and wine it has a great flavor. It was very easy to make!

delicious! very quick and easy to make! i didn't have white wine so i replaced with rice cooking wine (asian!) haha and it tasted great as well. i sauteed the sliced mushrooms in garlic AND ONION which added additional flavor. sprinkled red pepper over it and it was a hit! i just used fresh mushrooms from the grocery store and it still tasted great. next time, i will try portobello.

Very easy recipe and tasty.  I would definately not serve this for a dinner party as it wasn't impressive in my opinion.  It was an easy recipe and very convenient though making it worth it.

Pretty good!  I made it for 6 servings - I used a 15oz. jar of alfredo.  I served it with Organic Rustic bread and Irish butter.  YUM.  Definitely not good for the waistline, but fast and so tasty!

Superb!  This gets 5 stars for ease of preparation and great taste.  I used the alfredo from the refrigerated section, a whole package of baby bellas, and used cheese ravioli instead of tortellini.  It really tastes like it came from a restaurant.  I'll be making again for sure!

Just ok.  I made my own alfredo sauce and added frozen peas at the very end and it was good but overall I would not make this again.  Leftovers were NOT good at all.

I made this recipe substituting linguine for the tortellini, because that's what I had.  The flavor was nice.  I don't usually like alfredo, but I will make this again.  The fiance loved it!

I didn't have wine, so I used chicken broth instead.  This still turned out really well and was very easy.  I'll make it again, but next time I plan to make homemade sauce rather than use the stuff out of the jar.

This recipe was quick, easy and excellent.  I served it for a party of 6 and actually used 2 lbs of tortellini with the same amount of sauce and it was still delicious and tasty.  We did not need the salt and pepper to taste - b/c the sauce alone was excellent.  Thank you!!!

A gourmet meal.  Have to admit we did use a little butter and little more wine while sauteing the mushrooms.  We mixed the mushrooms mixture right into the pasta so there was sauce on every bite.  Wonderful!

I really liked this. It is heavy though so you can't eat it too often. I followed the recipe but added some red pepper flakes to kick it up and 1 pound of cooked shrimp. Next time I may try it with white button mushrooms instead of portobellos.

Easy to make and tasted amazing. I will definitely make this again. Love the use of Portobello mushrooms in pasta and Tortellini is my favorite pasta. Enjoyed this dish with a Brunello di malticino Italian wine.

This was very delicious. My fiancé loved it just as much as I did, but I don't think you can really go wrong with alfredo.

This was the bomb...it came together in about fifteen minutes.  We loved it and it's the perfect pasta dish when you need something a little creamy but not too heavy on those hot summer nights.  Added extra mushrooms and it DID need a bit more salt and pepper than I thought, but this was a win.  Thank you for the recipe, this is going in the permanent file!

Pretty good, not sure about 5 stars.  It was probably the alfredo sauce i used.  Next time will have to make my own.

I use baby bella mushrooms, 1 cup cream, 1 cup half and half, and then add parmesan cheese until it's thick enough.  I also add sauteed chicken, and steamed sugar snap peas.  Me and my husband love this recipe.

I made this last night and it was incredible. It was the only time I have ever made a white sauce pasta at home that tasted like I ordered it in a restaurant. I added some peas. I used a 9 oz container of frozen Alfredo sauce, and a 14 oz bag of frozen cheese tortellini.(Both were Louisa's brand)

This is delicious, and it's my boyfriend's favorite meal. I use a tiny bit less oil and a tiny bit less wine (not to mention a low-fat alfredo sauce) and it works out great. I've made this for nearly everyone I know and they all loved it. If you think it's too rich, play around with different pre-made sauces and also try varying the amount of other ingredients. 

I agree about the bread...definitely serve it with some nice french bread (and pinot grigio! :)

Really good overall. i didn't have portabello mushrooms and just used button mushrooms. i cooked the mushrooms in a sauvignon blanc and then drank the rest of the bottle with the meal. A lighter wine made a great match. i made my own alfredo sauce, too. Great!

I made my own alfredo for this using almond milk because I don't drink cows milk. It was pretty good. I also added asparagus tips. I would have preferred more mushrooms in it.

Like most reviewers, I think Alfredo sauce from the dry pasta section is one of the most disgusting things to come from a jar. Unlike some reviewers, there is no way I have time to make my own sauce (no matter how easy it's supposed to be). I used Buitoni Alfredo sauce (which, technically, isn't in a jar) and liked it just fine. 
Following another reviewer's suggestion, I added some vegetables. I cooked broccoli until it was very tender and set it aside before cooking 1/2 a zucchini in with the mushrooms, garlic, et cetera. Everything else I kept the same. 
I liked the taste and I like that I can add in whatever vegetable I'd like. I'll make the dish again, and I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to my friends and family.

I'm very new to making my own food, so I still have a lot to learn. The thing I learned from this is that I need to be a bit more mindful of measurements. Sure, it's okay to throw 'a pinch' of something in here and there, and you don't have to have everything measured down to the exact, precise unit... but it should probably come close.

I did not do that when making this. I used more pasta and sauce than what was called for, but used the same amount of mushroom. Thus, the mushroom was a bit underwhelming in consideration of the dish as a whole. However, it still made for a very nice accent flavor.

An easy enough dish that I'll try it again... the right way!

Just finished eating this for dinner tonight. My stomach is warm and full. My breath smells like garlic. No leftovers. Overall a true success!  Modifications-  I sauted the mushrooms, garlic, and parsley in a tablespoon of bacon grease left over from a previous cooking endeavor (I'm not a vegetarian because I hate restrictions) and cranked my electric burner up as high as it could go because I wanted food on the table and my landlord makes me invest in renter's insurance which is great in case of a grease fire. Since my burner was up so high, it meant that I could afford to use more bargain basement chardonnay so I doubled it to a half cup. (Wine is a liquid and dissolves faster at higher heat settings. More wine= more wine flavor.) Overall, dinner was a success even with using a store bought jar of Alfredo sauce and cheap wine.

Great and quick! I placed it on a bed of fresh spinach and I used red pepper with the mushroom mixture for more color. Loved it. I will make a double batch of the sauce next time. Thanks!!

Very rich, creamy, and overall delicious. Me and my family loved it, it was very easy, and it didn't take long at all to prepare! My only problem is that I think it was a tad too sweet (due to the Alfredo I had on hand, I think), and maybe I'll use less garlic in the future, but it was nonetheless very good.

The flavor of this dish was delicious, but the cheese tortellini combined with an Alfredo sauce was just too heavy. My whole family was uncomfortably full after dinner. In the future, I will use the sauce over linguine or another plain pasta.

I loved this recipe and most importantly my hubby loved it to. The only thing I changed was instead of wine I added olive oil and a tab bit of butter. I also added green peppers. Delicious! This is going in my recipe box. Thank you!

I made a homemade alfredo instead of using store-bought. Everything turned out wonderfully! All of my guests had seconds, and some had thirds. I will be making this again.

This was good but it wasn't as good as the reviews made it out to be.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I'm sure I will make it again but, it is very heavy and something you definitely need to be in the mood for.

Used mushrooms I had at hand and the taste was still fantastic. I'm an avid baker so I always have heavy cream on hand, so I also made this using homemade Alfredo sauce (which I recommend). Was a bit watery - a result I contribute to my mushroom substitution (I love mushrooms so quantity probably played a part as well). I'd probably drain the mushrooms a little the next time before adding the sauce.

I'm not the biggest fan of Tortellini, but made this for my husband, the vegetarian.  The sauce is AWESOME!!! He loved it and so did the kids.  I would recommend doubling the recipe for sure and next time I'm going to throw it over some penne or angel hair pasta.  mmmmmm.

This was very yummy - I did use milk/ butter/flour instead of a jar sauce. Will make again. This is a easy yet looks fancy meal to make after a long day at work

We love this recipe, but we are not big fans of garlic so we just leave it out and it tastes amazing

Yummy and very rich.  I found that the mushrooms took much longer to cook than the recipe states.

Just loved this!  Easy to prepare and so yummy.  Evan my daughter ate the mushrooms which she usually won't touch.  A keeper in my recipe collection.

I thought this was just ok, but my husband loved it.  I liked everything except for the white wine, it tasted like it didn't go.  Next time I might just add chicken broth.  I didn't have portobello mushrooms, so I just used regular fresh sliced mushrooms.  I also added chicken strips, which made a nice addition.  As for an alfredo sauce I made a sauce also from this site, Quick & Easy Alfredo sauce, which was awesome!

This was very good. It was VERY rich and VERY flavorful. I couldn't eat that much so I was hungry soon afterwards...but if you enjoy meals to make you tingle this is it!!! Bread helped make it more enjoyable.
