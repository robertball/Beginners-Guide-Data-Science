It was alright, nothing special, but not horrible either. My boyfriend liked it more than I did. If I make it again I'll probably add something to it to give it a bit more flavor, or just mash it all up like mashed potatoes, then make it into potato cakes.

I modified the recipe a bit to make a meal for two.  Did not have low sodium cream of chicken available, so used regular sodium level.  Added a bit of left over ham I had in the fridge.  Was very tasty.

This is a keeper! I used 1/2 cup milk. I will be making this again.
