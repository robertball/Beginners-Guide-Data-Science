Made this using small pearl tapioca instead of quick.  Soaked 1/2 C tapioca in 2C water (as per package) for 5 hours.  Then drained, and continued with recipe.  No salt, and 1t vanilla.  Very good!  We ate it hot, but thought it wasn't sweet enough.  Strangely, it seemed sweeter cold.  Anyway, it's very good and I like it with nutmeg sprinkled on top!!

I used minute tapioca instead of the quick cooking stuff (evidently there is a difference), so my pudding thickened much earlier than the recipe describes. Also I accidently added the vanilla at the beginning of the cooking process, and then added more at the end. However, the end result was still tasty!

Excellant! Reminds me of my grandmother's pudding. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. The second time I omitted the salt (didn't see a need for salt) and increased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon. Absolutely perfect! My granddaughters rave to everyone about their new favorite treat.

Delish old-fashioned, slow-foods recipe. I made a half-recipe (using Splenda as I am diabetic) and poured pudding into three dessert dishes. Then garnished each dish with a strawberry sliced into a fan shape (very easy). Personally, I wouldn't recommend omitting the little bit of salt called for, as it helps bring out the subtle flavor of this pudding. Also, doubling the vanilla works well. This recipe will become a staple around this Grandma's house.

Nice, but the recipe on the tapioca box is quicker and just as good. It skips the tempering of the eggs step by beating the eggs into the milk, sugar and tapioca and letting this stand for ten minutes before heating. The texture comes out better that way. No chance of strings of cooked egg whites.

This is a great recipe.  It reminds me of my grandmothers.  I left out the salt.  Didn't miss the taste at all.  Doubled the vanilla.  I microwaved it to save time stirring it on the stove.  A total of 8 minutes and stirred it every 2 minutes.  I love it warm.  Thanks for sharing.

I don't remember ever having tapioca pudding before, but this was great.  Good thing I didn't follow the directions on the box!  I used 1% milk instead of whole (all I had) and it was still delicious and creamy.  Wonderful treat.

This is a fine basic recipe for tapioca, with one exception. There is no need to fear using small tapioca in place of instant, and it does not require any soaking. Many would-be tapioca cooks shy away from cooking tapioca for that very reason. I would also recommend cooking on medium rather than medium high to avoid scalding , which is very easy to do. Slow cooking is always better than scalded. I love this with a spoonful of fruit preserves on top, or fresh fruits of the season, even better. The tartness of fresh fruit makes the tapioca seem sweeter by contrast. I also advise being sure the tapioca balls are soft, taste test, before removing from heat, but try to remove from cooking before it is fully thick. It will thicken a great deal more in the refrigerator. Tapioca Pudding is a great comfort food treat, and this shines so far more than the fake stuff sold in little plastic cups, no contest! It is not difficult at all, but like good cooking always does, it requires the attention of a loving cook. I have made this 5 times, always with non-instant tapioca.

Very thick! Not watery at all. I have tried a few recipes and this is it. Next time I will add a little more sugar (I have a sweet tooth) and I may have over cooked this a little on that final two minutes. But very tasty just what I was looking for! Thanks for a great recipe!

My 3 year old, who is normally anti-carb, began eating this like there was no tomorrow.  And then she stopped.  It tastes fairly rich and sweet.  I ignored the recipe on the Minit Tapioca box and used this recipe instead, taking the advice of one of the two reviewers and using 1 t vanilla and no salt.  Next time I might try adding some salt to offset the sweetness.  The consistency was good when it finished cooking, but as it sat, it became quite thick.  Good comfort food.

Great basic recipe.  Use 1/2 beans from a vanilla bean for better flavor, and the black specks are a good contrast against the white pudding.

Made this for my mom, who enjoyed the taste.  I did double the pure vanilla extract as a few others mentioned and I'm definitely glad I did, because the vanilla flavor was still mild.  My only complaint - and I wouldn't have deducted a start but a couple of others mentioned this as well, so I don't think it was just me - was that this pudding was beyond thick when completely cooled.  Mind you, except for the vanilla I followed this recipe EXACTLY.  Not one single deviation in timing, measurements, heat settings, anything that could have caused the pudding to set up so thick.  It was truly beyond thick, it was gelatinous.  My stove is a very precise, professional grade, gas stove so it's not like my electric burners were wonky. Because I have no clue how this pudding turned out like this (my Mom assures me it's not supposed to be like that...and she's a Tapioca pudding fanatic)because I am certain I did everything exactly according to the recipe, that's why I only deducted one star because I'm wondering if the consistency has something to do with something unwritten (stir, don't whisk; humid days it should cook less; something).  I will use this recipe as a guide and make it again, but I will increase the milk to 3 1/2 cups or 4 cups (like in the Meadowwood Tapioca recipe on this site) to see if that makes this a Tapioca pudding and not a Tapioca gelatin.

I volunteer at a local hospice by cooking. One of the residents asked for tapioca pudding this week and I used this recipe and it was wonderful. I probably used more vanilla than the recipe called for but otherwise, I followed it as written and it was wonderful. Thanks, Nicole!

Evidently this is the first review in quite a while. This recipe stand the test of time. No tinkering needed, this is good old fashioned pudding at it's best. Thick, creamy, yum!
Takes some time, but worth the effort!

Used this recipe, but I separated the eggs and beat the whites stiff while waiting for the milk and other ingredients to set.  After mixture has cooked, then fold in beaten whites and it makes for a fluffier pudding.  Also I add a can of DRAINED crushed pineapple.  Delish

Perfect tapioca pudding, and very easy to make.  I used coconut milk instead of whole (all I had), and really couldn't tell the difference.  My husband had never had tapioca pudding before, and loved this recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

Thickness consistency: I wasn't sure if it was automatically supposed to be thick at the end of the recipe or thicken up in fridge as it cools down. It's the latter. But, it would have been nice to have had that guidance.

I made 2 batches simultaneously: a batch as the recipe calls for, and a "healthy" batch with non-fat milk, less sugar, and a little less yolk for experimental comparison. The regular batch tastes better and has better consistency, but the "healthy" batch is also good (still has the tapioca ball texture, and vanilla and somewhat creamy taste).

Wonderful, comforting tapioca-jello can't make it like this :) I used regular tapioca soaked overnight (didn't have quick cooking), which turned out just fine.  I saw one reviewer complain about curdled eggs-it is absolutely necessary to take the time to temper your eggs by adding the hot mixture to prevent this from happening.  Very nice recipe, thank you!

I just made this, and I added a of a pinch of nutmeg (I think it's a good thing to add for tapioca pudding in general).  Other than that, this is very good!  My tapioca was not a pearl type of quick-cooking tapioca.  The label said  quick-cooking tapioca, but it was some regular almost tiny flaky looking stuff - turned out fine to my surprise.

Delicious.  I wish it was a little less congealed but I think I left out 1/2 a cup of milk.  Wonderful flavor.  Will make again and add 1/2 c. more milk.

I made this with small pearl tapioca (allowing the pearls to soak ahead of time) and this is hands-down the best tapioca pudding recipe I've ever made. So creamy! I'll be making this over and over!

If you follow most tapioca recipes (I looked at many), they require separating eggs, heating, not boiling.  So, I decided to take a chance and make it a lot quicker.  I used 1/2 C. pearl tapioca and soaked it about 5 hrs.  There was no liquid left to drain.  I used raw sugar, a little less than a half C.
It seemed plenty sweet to me.  Then, I whisked everything together, except vanilla.  Constantly whisking, I heated it over medium low heat to almost boiling.  Perfect!

My pudding came out much thicker (can we say spackle?  :-)) than would be presentable at the table!  So - I would view this as an error in the recipe.

I haven't had tapioca pudding since I was a kid, but I remember loving it.

I made this almost exactly as written, my only changes were using a vanilla bean instead of vanilla extract and adding 1T bourbon (left over from another application). Mr. Spikey -- who "hates tapioca" -- asked for seconds. To me this recipe was dirt-simple  and I'll definitely make it again, playing around with different extracts and, for a savory twist, with practically NO sugar and fresh herbs from my garden. YUM!

Excellent recipe.  I soak my tapioca in milk overnight. I cook it in a deep saucepan immersed in a stew pot of boiling water.  Stirred constantly until thick, it never will burn.  I add the vanilla later after it has cooled down some.

Just made homemade tapioca for first time.  Super easy, fast, delicious. Never had it warm b4. Flavours are more developed that way. Added 3/4 tsp of vanilla, only because I like a lot of it. It needs salt for balance.  Don't omit.

I used Organic Tapioca Granules, which said to use like the quick cook. Worked out perfectly!  Also, I used no sugar, but substituted NOW Real Food Erythritol in its place.  I thought it would not be sweet enough, but adding the egg and the vanilla made it perfectly sweet!
I also used a Lactaid/Almond milk combination and no taste difference at all! 
I will omit the salt next time and double the vanilla, as many others have done previously.
Thank you for this recipe! It definitely hit the spot, especially being lactose and sugar free!!

Easy and tasty  - perfect every time.  I do not have quick-cooking tapioca so I just cook it a lower temperature for a long time until it comes to a boil.  Then when the tapioca looks clear or near clear I start putting the mixture into the beaten eggs.  Turns out great!

I used coconut milk instead for a better option than milk. You can use 1/2 the sugar as well because of the sweetness of the coconut milk. Way more calories for those with a fast metabolism or need calories after intense workouts that includes cards and some protein.

I was never a huge fan of tapioca pudding. Maybe it was the texture, because it always tasted good. This tapioca pudding recipe creates the creamiest pudding ever. I do use Minute tapioca.

Used half water half milk to cut down on fat and calories, and didn't put any sugar (to avoid GM beet sugar) so stirred in yummy Maple Syrup at the same time as the vanilla.

I was worried it was going to be runny, but it was perfect.  It definitely needs a big of salt, but a pinch is plenty.  I added 2 extra tablespoons of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla.  Fantastic tapioca pudding recipe.

This is an amazing recipe. I too left out the salt and doubled the vanilla.  However, mine didn't come to a rolling boil because the tapioca balls thickened very quickly.  It still turned out amazing!

Same as the box, but doubled. Many years ago, I bought a package of small pearl tapioca in Lancaster County, PA. That made the best pudding. So see if you can find pearl tapioca that isn't necessarily from the red box - you'll be pleased with it.

My husband loves tapioca. I made this but used Chia seeds instead of tapioca. I used homemade Almond milk and had to use a little more because of using the chia seeds. I didn't measure how much more Almond milk, when I was cooking it and it was getting thick, I just added more milk to make it more creamy. I used  coconut sugar and vanilla paste. My husband didn't even know I used Chia until after he ate it. He's kind of a Tapioca Snob and I did not want him to judge till he ate it and told me what he thought. HA!! He love it!! My mom had some also and AFTER my husband finished his and said he loved it my mom is actually the one that let the cat out of the bag by saying "It's a different tapioca pudding but it's really good". She love it too. I think the Chia added a nutty flavor. I don't know how to explain it but it was great!! I will always make it this way.

Great recipe.  I modified it for our family:
Almond and rice milk
Glutten free tapioca
Brown sugar

I left everything else the same including the proportions.  It looks and taste great.

Fantastic! My mom loves tapioca pudding and I made it as part of a celebration dinner. I used Minute tapioca, which I think is more like instant than quick-cooking, So I mixed the egg in after the mixture boiled, without the 5 minutes of cooking. I used a mix of fat contents in milk to make it about 2%. I also added a little extra sugar (because my family likes it more sweet) and served it cold with nutmeg on top. Creamy and delicious flavor!

Absolutely delicious, and worth the time and effort. I used 2% milk instead of whole milk and it turned out just fine. I might go with a little less sugar next time.

I liked it.  It's a plain tapioca pudding, exactly what I was looking for.  Did make one change to it:  used large tapioca, which meant I soaked them for about 12 hours and adjusted cook time as needed for thickness.  Almost forgot, I also doubled vanilla.

Definitely be careful with the heat on the stove: heating/reheating milk/cream on a stove top the rule is that as the heat goes up from minimum, the amount of stirring goes up.  At around medium you should keep this moving constantly.

Yes this is the classic minute tapioca recipe but it is a good basic.  In our family, we add the egg yolks with the milk mixture and whip the egg whites separately.  After the mixture has cooled, we fold in the egg whites (it will look lumpy but this is how it should look).  Then we fold in one can of drained crushed pineapple.  Chill and serve topped with whipped cream and the optional, but favorite maraschino cherry.

This is my go-to recipe whenever I make tapioca pudding. My old roommate loves it! I cooked some last time I was in town, and he ate it so fast I had to make a second (bigger) batch! It's super important to stir constantly; I've made that mistake before, and my pudding was lumpy.

I have never made Tapioca Pudding before and both of just loved it.  Had to soak my pearls as they were not quick cooking type, that was not difficult at all. Remember to keep it in fridge. Oh so good and thickened up beautifully. Will make again.

Loved this. Made as is, except used 1% milk instead of whole (kept the salt), and a little extra vanilla.

I love this recipe! It it worth the time and effort.  I would NOT double the vanilla like some of the reviews said. I tried doubling it but it was way too strong even though I love vanilla.

Absolutely fantastic - I used small pearl tapioca and soaked for 1 hr.  Added a little lemon zest to it - it was a hit at my church

Very good recipe. I used 1/2 a fresh vanilla bean instead of vanilla extract, also added orange zest and a little juice from a fresh orange. Was able to get away with 2% milk thanks to the fresh vanilla. The orange zest was a great touch. Delicious.

Perfect.  Followed the recipe exactly except I added just a touch more vanilla.  This was delicious- so thick and creamy and very comforting, and just like I remember it from when I was a child.  I love it both plain or with sliced bananas on top.  Thanks Nicole!

Really fantastic and easy, i'll never use a boxed tapioca mix again.  I might cut sugar down next time because I personally don't need my tapioca this sweet but my husband disagrees.  I also used lowfat milk and it was still really creamy. Topped with cinnamon this is the best!

Delicious!  I don't think I used the quick cooking tapioca, so some of it was a little chewy, but the whole family devoured it immediately anyway.  Next time I'll try it chilled before serving... if I can keep it hidden from my husband and kids that long!

It was extremely easy to make. I was cooking on a gas range, which I am unaccustomed to so I think I may have curled the milk.

This recipe is almost exactly the same as all the others online, with one exception. The directions say to bring to a simmer and simmer 2 minutes, AFTER the eggs are added. When my pudding came out disappointingly yucky I searched other recipes online. All other recipes say to warm gently but explicitly state "do not boil" after the eggs are added. All Recipes is usually my go to for finding an authentic rendition of favorite desserts and baked goods. But this one failed me. Boiling the pudding after the eggs were added ruined it. So sad.

I recently made this recipe but doubled the recipe to equal 12 servings.  My tapioca pudding turned out really runny and I'm not sure what I did wrong.  I have made this several times before and I've never had it be runny like this actually most of the time I did make it, it turned out really thick! It still tastes delicious but the consistency is not what I really wanted.

My husband loves tapioca, and I make a batch every week.   This time I tried to cut down and added only one egg because last batch, once it had cooled down, seemed to produce a bit of water.....but it might also have been because I used a stick blender to whip the egg whites.

I made this twice so far and will make it again and again. The flavor is very good and it is easy to make.
I had to soak my fish eyes overnight because I didn't have the quick kind. 
I'm not sure if it was me or the recipe but the first time it came out very stiff once it sat in the refrigerator overnight. So this second time I added more milk and a touch more sugar. We'll see how it is tomorrow if it lasts that long.
I'll keep on tweaking until I get it the way I like it. 
This is a great starting point recipe. Thank you!

The real way to make old fashioned tapioca pudding is to separate the eggs and beat the egg whites  until stiff, add some sugar and fold them in at the very end of the cooking process.

Very good
The instant cooking tapioca ensures a nice texture without sacrificing flavor. Pretty easy and fast, other than tempering the eggs, which adds all of a few seconds.

I thought I followed the directions exactly but it turned out like glue...had to throw it away.   Did I use the wrong kind of tapioca?   Total waste of ingredients.

Excellent! Bravo Nicole!  It comes out perfect.
I followed the recipe exactly save for increasing the vanilla to 1 tsp. I will be using this recipe for the next 30 years, because the last 30 years I had been following the Fannie Farmer recipe from its 1959 cookbook; which I hadn't loved but was adequate and got the job done. I had been searching for a replacement on and off for a while. Today I saw your recipe, tried it, and came out with tapioca heaven. Thanks!

this is the 2nd time I've made this recipe.  first tim I followed exactly, and it was delish.
this time I use a can or Organic Coconut Milk for 2 cups of whole milk. I doubled the recipe.
it's absolutely delicious.
you could even use more Coconut Milk for a double batch.
this is a keeper

Great recipe but it comes out a bit too thick once it cools so I started using only 1 egg and not quite a full half cup of tapioca.  Comes out perfectly with these changes!

Wonderful recipe! Made a double recipe. I used 2% milk and large pearl tapioca (1 cup) which I DID NOT soak ahead of time. I added salt and 3 tsp. vanilla( at the end of cooking)  and 1 cup total sugar to the doubled recipe. I cooked it for 5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes. I did not add the eggs until the last hour and tempered them before adding. I also started it on low, and then changed back and forth from low to high and back to low every time I stirred it. Hope this makes sense. It did get a perfect consistancy while cooling. It was plenty rich enough with the 2% milk although I may try it next time with half 1/2 and 1/2  and half 2% milk.This recipe goes in with our favorite dessert recipes for sure!!

I made this instead of the usual box recipe (I had the minute tapioca)--much creamier and very tasty.  As others mentioned, I doubled the amount of vanilla, but kept everything else as specified in the original recipe.  

Definitely will make this again!

Made exactly as stated.... however, make sure it's at a COMPLETE boil before cooking 5 min. First time I didn't and it was way too runny... had to re-boil it and add 1/4 tsp cornstarch and it was way too thick. Perfect second time I made it.

I follow this same basic recipe, but add 2 TB cornstarch to yolk mixture, and divide the eggs ( use 2 large or 3 small). While pudding is cooking ( stir often to prevent scorching the milk) beat egg whites to stiff peak. After pudding thickens fold in egg whites and vanilla. This makes a very light but refreshing desert.

Soaked my own tapioca overnight and went a little heavier with it.  Made a double recipe (for 4 people).  At first it seemed a little too sweet as I was cooking it but it mellowed out after it sat in the fridge.  It was very good.  This one will stay in the recipe box!

Almost exactly like I make this one.  I use 4 cups of milk, 3 large eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp salt, 2/3 cup of sugar.  Then I sprinkle top with nutmeg.  This also tastes great with fruit.  I have added sliced strawberries, dried cranberries, bananas, whatever you have around the house.

P.S.  I'm thinking maybe the addition of some booze may make it palatable.  Maybe Bailey's instead of milk.  Hmmm... Or just plain whisky and added a couple more eggs to make it set up.
I failed to mention that I'm alone in my opinion of tapioca in general.  To me it's among the more repulsive, vile etc.  etc. . . . concoctions ever created.  However everyone else thinks it's way above just special and that without it they may all die.  This recipe has been family approved and is very simple and easy and quick to make so I endure it to keep the peace.

This was the best tapioca pudding I have ever tasted. The only changes I made was using organic medium tapioca that I soaked for 2 hours and because I don't like things sweet I cut the sugar in half.  My family loved it.  We ate had it chilled.

good flavor, but the small grains of tapioca I used make this turn into a jelly by the end, making it impossible to incorporate the vanilla evenly.  next time, i'll use less sugar and tapioca.  maybe I should have used larger tapioca or more milk.

I made quadruple for a party, and the ratios seemed good. I used non-instant tapioca, and it was in danger of burning in the pan. If you use non-instant, soaking it for a few hours or so might help.

I also added about 1/2 tsp ground cardamom (maybe 1/4 to 1/8 tsp for the 6-serving recipe), which I learned about from an Indian chef. I really like the cardamom flavor.

I tried making this in the microwave.  The end result was quite delish--the mess I made getting to said end result was impressive!!  My advice: stir every 1:30 once it starts to thicken.

Well, got my own answer...I used my 'plain' SOY MILK and Splenda and it got thick... don't know if most people would like to take out real sugar but I did for my weight reasons. Didn't care for the egg in it but... nice to know for some of us who avoid sugar and a lot of salt - the rescipe can be tweeked. Thanks!!!

Thank you for this recipe! This is what I have been look for. I tried using the recipe on the tapico boxes and it always turned out rubbery and flavorless. This recipe is creamy and delicious and has the taste I like in tapioca

This was so yummy!  Much better than the recipe on the back of the tapioca box that I tried before and thought was just okay!  It is time consuming and I did end up cooking mine a bit too long (I had trouble deciding when it was thick enough-ended up plenty thick!) but it was still gobbled up by the whole family!  This is a keeper recipe for me!

VERY good pudding and cooked up just as advertised.  I might try adding a tad more sugar next time I make this for that little sweet tooth that sits in the back of my mouth.  Otherwise, it took care of a serious tapioca craving.

It was looking beautiful until I added the eggs.  Not sure what I did wrong but now it looks curdled.  Hope it tastes good and the kids will eat it.
