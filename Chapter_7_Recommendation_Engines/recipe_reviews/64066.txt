Great recipe!  One alteration I made on the advice of a local Indian restaurant was to mix 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and 3 tablespoons of water and add this mixture and stir well once the greens have wilted.  Then cover and cook for the remaining ten minutes.

Good, but I think i might just use 2 lbs of spinach next time. I think the mustard greens made it more bitter than I would have preferred.

YUM! this is a great saag recipe! It came out great!  I used 1lb Spinach, 1/2 lb rainbow chard and 1/2 lb collard greens.  This dish stole the show for our Indian Food night.  Everyone loved it!  I was surprised how much the greens cooked down.  I was sure there'd be leftovers but it was all devoured!  Thanks for the great recipe -I'll be making this again in the future!

This saag turned out great. Saag paneer is my favorite dish in Indian restaurants, and this version didn't dissapoint. I used swiss chard that I had in my freezer from my garden this past summer, and some spinach. I made homemade paneer and I also stirred in some plain yogurt at the end for a creamier texture. It was great!

I questioned myself every step of the way as I made this, but it turned out phenomenal. I served it over basmati rice with tandoori chicken.

Wonderful recipe!  I love saag and this recipe is great with a little bit of greek yogurt mixed in, if you're in a hurry, or some home made paneer!  When in a hurry, I just use frozen mustard greens and frozen spinach and it's done and ready to eat in about 10 minutes!

This was great, my husband (the picky one) really enjoyed this with rice, daal and raita (yogurt sauce) so it made for a good meal for vegetarian monday.  I did change some things, I used frozen chopped spinach and frozen chopped mustard green because thats all I had on had and it still tasted and cooked really well.  I didn't seed the chile pepper just added it seeds and all to give it some heat.  Garnished with chopped tomatoes and red chillies to make color pop.

This turned out great!  I added onions and tomatoes as did others.  I also used 1 part spinach, 1 part mustard leaves, and 1 part chard due to comments about using more spinach.  I also used tofu which was very paneer-like, but much healthier!

This is the best Saag recipe I've found and I've been looking for a long time.  Easy, tasty and authentic thanks to the flavour of the mustard greens.  To the reader who found it too bitter, add 1/2 tsp of sugar.  I add some 'homemade' buttermilk (lemon juice and milk) thickened with some cornstarch to get the creaminess I like.  Accommodates paneer or chicken very well.

Ok this is the second time I have made this recipe, after making it exactly as called for the first time I changed it up a bit. I used 1.5 lbs of spinach and only a .5 lb of the Mustards greens.  I also added 1 Tbls of Cornstarch and three Tbls of water.  The Saag came out great and was the consistency we liked.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this with some greens we received for free (don"t know what kind they were) and spinach.  Also I cooked bite-sized chicken breast pieces in olive oil and Garam Masala ahead of time and added it in the last ten minutes of cooking.  Everyone in my family loved this dish! Rarely do six people in our family agree on recipes!

YUM!  This is the most perfect Saag recipe I have ever tried.  I substituded a full head of kale for 3/4 of the spinach, simmered it for an extra 10 minutes to break down the kale.  It was PERFECT!

Great flavor, but too salty for our family.  We will definitely make this agin, but will cut down the salt to 1/2 a teaspoon.

Oh yum!  I made this tonight with 1 big bunch of kale and 1 big bunch of chard (11 oz total). Honestly, I didn't measure the spices very carefully ! I used way more cumin seeds by accident. 

I have a favorite premade (in a can) saag I really like, but this is better! I always thought this would be a difficult dish to make, so always bought the cans,  but it is not. I am so glad I found this recipe. I love greens, but sometimes we get so much in our weekly organic basket that I need other recipes to use them.

I did not like this Saag recipe, it tasted like American southern greens. Not bad, but not what I expected. I think next time I'll try Saag Paneer.

We had very bitter mustard greens, so I'm sure we did not get the ideal situation.  The flavor was still quite good--can't wait to try this with better ingredients!

I made a lot of small changes but kept the overall recipe and process mostly the same. It turned out really well! First, I didn't have any coriander, so I left that out. I also couldn't find fresh green chili at our local market, so I substituted 1 tsp of ground red chili. It was slightly too spicy, so I'd go down to 1/2 tsp or a heaping 1/2 next time. I used a mix of fresh chopped spinach and kale. Can't get mustard greens easily where I live. 2 Tbsp of turmeric seemed like a lot, so I used 1 heaping Tbsp. I followed the reviewer Patrick's advice to add 2 Tbsp of cornstarch and 3 Tbsp of water before letting the dish simmer. Then, after it was all done cooking, I put it through the food processor for about a minute to get the spinach and kale more finely chopped. I definitely recommend that. It made it much more like the saag dishes I've had at Indian restaurants. Finally, I added about five dollops of cream cheese right before serving. One of my friends had done that as a substitute for paneer when cooking this dish in the past. Not as authentic but it's quicker and easier and still tastes good. I've always been intimidated by cooking Indian-style dishes at home but this recipe made it easy. So glad to find it!

This was inedible. As in, we threw it out without eating it. Waaaaay too bitter. And I didn't do something wacky here--I followed the recipe.

I'd be willing to try this again with basically zero mustard greens or turmeric, but as is, yuck. What a waste of food and time.

I did not care for this recipe. It is a far cry from the Saag you would get in an Indian recipe and I won't make it again.

Great flavors, a little too salty. Will use unsalted butter or cut the salt in half or less next time. We used all kale and it was good but might add more water and simmer it for longer. Used almost 2 cups of water as it was, simmered maybe 15 minutes at high altitude. Also put all the spices in the oil at the beginning as most other Indian recipes we've seen do so.

This is delicious.  I wasn't sure what to do with my large bunch of mustard greens form CSA pick up.  We ate them all!  I did cut the butter amount in half.

Just made this tonight. So good we used a mix of chard, kale and spinach. I used red pepper flakes instead of green chili. We also added some paneer made it perfect. Thank you for a great recipe. We will be making this one over and over again.

Something wasn't quite right with this recipe. It was just okay - maybe too much salt, or too much cumin, but I don't know. Too much of something, even though I added quite a bit of water to keep the greens moist. I was wondering what kind of green chile pepper to use - I used an Anaheim.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I wasn't sure what to expect; had never tried this before, but I bought some mustard greens and bok choy and didn't know what to do with them!  It's fun to discover great new flavors by accident.  Thanks for a lovely recipe; I would def make again (and highly recommend serving with the Greek yogurt).  Also, one could add stir-fried meat and beans like chick peas for a one-dish meal!

This recipe was fine, but it needed a dollop of yogurt at the end. I didn't use the whole cumin seeds, and added garam masala and a little honey. Overall, an okay recipe, that needs a few changes to make it really good.

Too much salt!  Everything else was great but it was too salty.  I would at least half the salt in this recipe.  My husband thought it was fine but he adds salt to everything and I rarely add salt to any food.  Just be careful!

This was a very tasty recipe, especially given how quick it is. I'm still on the prowl for a slightly creamier saag recipe and will be trying the saag chole recipe next.

This was another attempt at my "first" attempt at Indian food, the coloring was spot on, however, the flavors left a little something to be desired. I don't know if it was my use of the chiles from my local Indian foods store or that some of the spices I had bought for the dish were past their prime. I also added paneer that I purchased to make it like the order from my local Indian restaurant. I will try this again for sure!

I made the recipe as written and it tasted incredibly bland compared to the saag my Desi friends make. I added three times the amount of spices called for in this recipe and it started to taste OK. Then I added a bunch of cayenne (at least two tbs) and that brought it together. Also the whole cumin seeds give it a weird crunchy mouthfeel; I would recommend ground cumin. Also, text time I make this recipe I am going to use ghee instead of butter, as something didn't taste quite "authentic" about it and I suspect that's what it is.

Family thought it was spicier than they were expecting (I did modify, using Penzey's New Curry to sub for the turmeric, coriander, etc) and it wasn't as cooked down or creamy. Next time, I'd chop everything much finer and add cream or yogurt at the end.

I used half the butter, and it was delicious (with half the fat and cholesterol). Made this with fresh mustard greens and kale, and frozen spinach.

We used frozen spinach and pressed out the liquid after thawing.  I think it made the dish a little too dry.

Turned out great, only used spinach, added garam masala, a couple tablespoons of heavy cream. Could have used coconut milk, but didn’t feel like opening a whole can. Used a stick blender to pulse garlic, ginger and spinach to a nice consistency.

The recipe's explanation that saag is a mix of mild greens and bitter greens was very helpful.  I added yogurt for creaminess as that is much healthier than cornstarch and I noticed other recipes use heavy cream to get the creaminess.  I also saw that other recipes added garam masala.  It was delicious without it but I might try it next time.  Next time I will use half the salt as it was way too salty for my taste.  With the other wonderful spices not that much salt is needed.  I used collard greens and kale for my bitter greens.  I used 1/4 C canola and 1/4 C butter to make it slightly healthier.  It's a great basic recipe.  Here is a recipe for garam masala   ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/142967/easy-garam-masala/

This saag was made with only kale. It is a simple dish, less creamy than the types of saag that use sour cream and butter; but probably healthier!

I didn't like this recipe. Tasted very strange. While I was cooking I was a little skeptical about adding 2 TABLESPOONS of turmeric. But I've never made Indian food before so I went with it.  It totally overpowered the dish. I looked at a bunch of other Saag recipes and it called for 1/4 TEASPOON of turmeric or no turmeric at all. My Indian friends said as far as she knew no one ever uses more than 1/2 tsp turmeric in their saag. I don't know if it was a typo, or a regional thing, but I really recommend scaling way back on the turmeric.

This was very good, even my Indian husband thought it was pretty authentic.  I used all Swiss chard from my garden and doubled the spice as I always do when I cook just for us.  I added some coconut milk at the very end because I had about a half cup leftover from another recipe.  Next time I’d use less butter, I only used 1/4 cup but it was still a little too much for my taste.

it was a pretty decent dish, I couldn't find any cumin seeds or a green pepper though. 
I made it completely wrong though, that was a mistake on my part, not the recipe. I wasn't aware that a garlic clove was just a section of the bulb, I thought that one clove of garlic is just a whole bulb. So naturally, I chopped up 2 bulbs of garlic and added it to the dish. Learn from my mistakes, and save yourself the trouble. Due to having about 10 times the amount of garlic needed in the dish, I ended up throwing it all up.  My farts smell as if my sphincter is a garlic press 
So ignoring my mistakes, I'd give this recipe a 3.5 or 4. Much cheaper than restaurant saag

LOVE this dish.  I only used fresh mustard greens the first time I made this and it was outstanding!  Second time, I used kale and did not enjoy as much.  I would recommend just using mustard greens if you LOVE mustard greens, much more robust than other greens that I tried.  This is a keeper recipe for those who love Indian foods.

I searched for this recipe which my mother-in-law used to make, and found chatni, which is pickled, but I rember she used to cook it.  Indian saag was the closest, and I used green pepper in stead of mustard and spinach. I added some green cilantro and a dash of vinegar. Yum. Goes well with biryani.

Loved this. We cooked the spinach initially until soft then puréed it in the blendtec before continuing with the rest of the recipe and it turned out wonderfully. Will definitely be making it again.

Very easy-to-follow recipe, but next time I will scale back the turmeric. Made the dish a little too bitter, even with using all spinach and no bitter greens.

Upon trying this recipe, it swiftly became a staple in my revolving dinner recipes in college. Served over long grain brown rice with naan bread on the side, this is truly fantastic.

Delish as written, but I've made several time & have adjusted a bit to fit our tastes. I also usually just use spinach to suite our preferences.

I made the recipe as stated. I'm not sure if it was user error, but there was a decided pea-nutty flavor and WAY too salty. With adjustments this would be tasty and pleasing to my husband and myself.

This was great, I was looking for a use for assorted greens I had (bok choy, pak choy, turnip greens, asian greens) as well as some gorgeous baby squash and peppers from my CSA. I had no ground coriander and used half butter, half olive oil. Mixed some greek yogurt into my serving bowl and topped with red pepper flakes. Awesome!

Delicious. I added homemade cumin paneer at the end and served it with some potatoes and green beans mixed in.

I made it with kale instead of the mustard greens. It came out great and was well liked at the office party I took it to. I would probably use more chili peppers next time as the flavor was covered up by the spices and the heat was lacking for my taste.

The final product was very good. I did made several adjustments- I didn't use cumin seeds. I added ground curry. I added 1/4c of sweet corn kernals. I liked idea of adding greek yogurt but didn't have any on hand- two tablespoons of sour cream worked well. I added quite a bit of water while my greens were simmering, so I did end up adding 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken. I would also recommend making sure your greens are chopped into very small pieces- I went too large and ended up having to simmer for quite a while before they broke down enough for my liking.

Yummy! We love greens, so we love this.  I add a little fenugreek sometimes and red pepper flakes. I've never used cumin seeds and it's still delicious.

This would have been much better if I had cut out all of the salt. As is, there was entirely too much salt in this recipe. Otherwise it was good.

This was really tastey!! I was a little skeptical when I was making it whether I would like it or not. But it was really good. I had to add some chicken because it just didn't seem like a meal without protein.

Almost as good as our local gourmet Indian restaurant, which is one of the best rated in the DC area.  Yum!

as written I feel like this dish would be pretty bland b/c like others i felt something was missing.. i used all spinach and still felt it was kind of bitter.. i doubled the chile pepper.. added some curry powder and squeezed some lemon over the finished product.. i didn't feel like it was too salty like some said and we don't like salty foods.. wish i would have added some yogurt like another suggested or some sliced mushrooms and red bell pepper.. but that's a thought for some other time

Turned out quite well, however I would recommend double the amount of green chili.

Very nice saag recipe. I used 1/2 spring greens and 1/2 frozen spinach as that's what I had on-hand. I also used dairy-free spread instead of butter to make it vegan. The frozen spinach made it so easy to make (no need to cover or reduce), so I think I'll just use that next time.

This was very easy to make and I thought it turned out pretty good.the only thing I'd do differently is to leave out the salt as it overpowered the other spices. I'm not giving it a higher rating because I liked it more than the rest of my family.

The recipe was fine but under seasoned. I think I might try making my own garam masala and try it with that. I also might throw in another pepper. Just a note: the greens will cook down a lot. Four medium sized people were able to eat this with paneer and naan easily.
