Very good idea to roast the potatoes, but a little bland if you follow the recipe exactly.  I roasted my potatoes with garlic salt, paprika, and pepper on them as well as chopped GREEN onions mixed in with the taters.  Also added a touch of rosemary.  I cooked 5 strips of bacon in the microwave, chopped it up and added it to the tater mixture to cook.  The bacon-onion-potato-rosemary flavor is just wonderful.  Chopped up lots of celery and added it as well.  Used ½ cup whipped cream cheese, 1/4 cupmayo, and ½ cup sour cream and one cup of shredded chz.  Yummy!

*I like to review a recipe not just based on it's face-value, because how would that work?  We all have totally different taste buds, lol, so I like to review it on how well you can build on it, to your own liking.

I have made this potato salad at least 6 times before I finally realized that I never rated it, so here it is. It's a 5 star keeper because you can do so many things with it. Made it exactly as the recipe says. I have used red and regular white potatoes. Red and yukon 
golds.  No eggs or as many as I've had in the frig up to the specified 6. Regular Hellman's Mayo cut in half with nofat sour cream. Reduced fat Hellman's using the specified amount. Real fried bacon extra crunchy for crumbling. Imitation bacon bits. Added a chopped up stalk of celery. Reduced the amount of onion when I felt my onion was extremely strong. Increased the amount when I used a Vidalia. But one thing I do no matter how I make this recipe is that I double it. It doesn't last long enough otherwise!!!!!

I don't know why it never occurred to me to roast the potatoes instead of boiling them for potato salad! I always seem to overcook them with the boiling method, but these potatoes came out perfectly! I will add celery next time for extra crunch, but this is the only method I will use to make potato salad from now on. It takes about the same amount of time, and the clean up is minimal! I lined a cookie sheet with aluminum and sprayed it with cooking spray so the potatoes wouldn't stick. Thank you for the (somewhat obvious) roasting method!

Yummy! This was wonderful!!!! The only change I made was cutting the mayo in half and replacing the other half with sour cream. A very nice change from the regular mustard potato salad!

This is a really nice change from traditional potato salad made with boiled potatoes. Roasting them seems to bring out more flavor. I roasted the potatoes for about 20 minutes them I added the chopped onion to the pan and roasted for about 15 minutes more. This gave the onions a different flavor as well. I don't think I will ever boil potatoes for salad again. Thanks for the recipe.

This is the most awesome potato salad ever!  I added grated Cheddar and it's just like a loaded baked potato.  I also did as suggested and threw in some chopped celery, baked the potatoes on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet in 2 batches, because I made a  lot.  This is a keeper!

I can't speak from personal experience because I don't like potato salad, but based on my guests comments/reactions, I would say this a good one.  They enjoyed the subtle differences from your everyday potato salad.  Very easy to prepare, too.  I used the recipe exactly as is, except I used Hormel real bacon pieces instead of frying "real" bacon.  Oh, and I added celery because I made it for Father's Day and my dad likes celery in his potato salad.

Very good.  I tossed the roasted potatoes in a little of the bacon grease.  So not healthy, but added a little something.  Used Vidalia onion & low fat Hellmans.

I made this for my daughter's first birthday BBQ and everyone was asking for the recipe.  Great time saver as you don't need to peel the potatoes!  I won't make any other potato salad!

this salad went over like GANGBUSTERS at my staff party this week!  So simple, yet sooooo yummy!  One guy even said it was in his top 2 potato salads (and he used to be a chef!).  One change i did  make was that I cooked the bacon in the oven.  500deg on a cookie sheet lined with non stick tin foil.  keep an eye on it.  should take about 10-15 min.  Remove the bacon to papertowel lined plate and put the potatoes on the same cookie sheet, toss in the bacon drippings and roast!  adds yet another level!  i also used smoked paprika, used a mix of mayo and sour cream and used snipped chives in addition to the onion (only used 1/4 of an onion).  So yummy!

Really love this potato salad, but I did add different things. First I seasoned the potatoes very well before I roasted them. With things like garlic, rosemary, onion. Instead of adding chopped white onion, I added scallion and chives instead. I also chopped fresh dill and added that. I mixed the mayo. with some spicy brown mustard and mixed that in. The longer you let this sit, the more the flavors come out! Delish!

Coat with Grey Poupon before you roast! Do note that my vote is based on the recipe "as is".  (I hate it when people change it and then rate it!) I've been making this for years with leftover roasted potatoes from the dinner before.  (baked after coating with Grey Poupon and olive oil, and roasted with garlic, onion, and rosemary sprigs.  The same dish can be quickly reheated as breakfast potatoes with the addition of your favorite ingredients. (And, you'll be cooking bacon anyway!))  So basically, I make three meals out of a batch of these roasted potatoes.  The spicy mustard and roasted garlic is just a nice addition to the flavors!

This is a really nice potato salad. I think because the potatoes are roasted instead of boiled, they retain so much more of their flavor. Only change I made was to double the bacon because my husband is a bacon-holic!! And I liked that there wasn't so much dressing like so many other potato salads have. Delicious!

This was good, but too many onions.  I changed it to green onions 1/2 cup.  It's much better eaten same day at room temperature.  Needed more salt than 1/2 tsp.  I used 1 teaspoon salt and pepper.  I added 1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper and 1/2 cup celery.  I also added 1-1/2 cups total of mayo.  The potatoes suck up the mayo quick.

Roasting the potatoes for potato salad did indeed add some nice flavor, but the dressing (basically just mayonnaise) needed something more. I much prefer my classic potato salad dressing over this. A little sugar, vinegar or pickle juice maybe? It's very unimpressive as it is.

LOVE IT!  I don't like the "pasty" effect in boiled potato salad and because these are roasted, they are perfect! The bacon is a nice surprise and just because our family is not a big fan of mayo, I cut the amount to half a cup and then added just a couple spoonfulls of sour cream.  YUM.

Never thought to roast the potatoes. This was excellent and took the advice of Beachhousenana and roasted the potatoes on parchment paper, no oil at all. Easy clean-up. I added chopped celery too as this is a standard in potato salad.

I made this tonight at I loved it! I was looking for a simple, tasty way to make potato salad with roasted potatos because I love the flavor of them.  Well, I found it!  The only things I changed were I did not use egg, added green onions, and I added celery as others suggested.  This is definitely a keeper!

I loved this recipe! I would never have thought to bake the potatoes! I bmixed it with the montreal steak spice, which I think another reviewer had suggested, it gave the potatoes more flavour, soo yummy!! I think I'm going to be making this recipe all the time! Fast and Easy!

This was so good. I added chives and cheddar cheese, left out the egg, and used half sour cream.  Made it for a birthday party and there was left overs so the next day I put it in the oven and served it warm and the cheese melted and mayo and sour cream made it creamy.

To me, it really had no flavor.  I did exactly as directed except I seasoned the potatoes a little bit more than the 1/4tsp of pepper.  Also another problem I had with this is with the color of the roasted potatoes, the eggs and then the bacon, it just looked nasty.  I just wasn't impressed and will not be making it again.  Really sorry but I will stick to my regular potato salad.  Thanks for sharing tho :)!

Tasty, a good basic recipe you can easily modify. I read other reviews - tossed my taters in 1/4 c olive oil, 1 tsp garlic salt/paprika/rosemary, and 1/4 cup chopped parsley. Didn't have all mayo so it was a mix of mayo/sour cream. I also added a tsp of the gormet basil blend. Some mustard would be good, or perhaps some chopped red peppers/pimentos for color. Almost couldn't wait for it to cool down!

This is a wonderfully different potato salad!  My family loved it -- even the kids!  This recipe is bound to be used again and again!  I'm not good at creating my own concoctions -- so it's especially
helpful to find your "everyday" great cooks out there!

Roasting the potatoes didn't make a big difference for this one to me. I have a similar recipe that uses a combination of mayo, sour cream and horseradish for the dressing; rest of ingredients are the same, and I prefer it.

I made this and my son, the critical eater in my house, loved it.  Since no one in our house love onion, I used celery for the crunch and it was perfect!  I'm making it again tonight for dinner.

I was really excited about this recipe, but after making it I thought that it was just lacking something.  I used half sour cream, half miracle whip and seasoned my potatoes while roasting them and it was still very bland.  I took a giant bowl of this to a teacher appreciation dinner that I was sitting up for the PTO at my son's school.  When I went back four hours later for clean up every dish was nearly devoured except this one.  The bowl was completely full with only a few spoonfulls missing from the middle.  It was very dissapointing.

Really great, the best potato salad I have ever had!  Made as directed except sprinkled garlic powder over the potatoes as they baked. Oh, and sauteed half the onion in the bacon grease...left the other half alone for the crunch..and added some chopped celery for more crunch. Even my picky husband & son, who both hate potato salad, loved it...Hubby even had seconds!

Wonderful.  I added salt to the potatoes while they were baking.  To change things up have added some caramelized onions (2-ish) to the dressing.  Very, very good.  We just used 2 eggs instead of 4.

I took this to a BBQ at a friends house. I have never had so many compliments on a potato salad. I followed the recipe, except, instead of roasting the potatos I boiled them. It has so much flavor. This will be my #1 BBQ dish from now on.

Roasting the potatoes really made the potato salad sing. I actually tossed the potatoes with a little EVOO and Montreal Steak Seasoning so it would come out more like a steakhouse baked potato flavor. My potatoes needed another 15 minutes to finish up. I used green onion and used a mixture of half FF mayo, half FF sour cream to make it a little like a loaded baked potato. GOOD stuff. I won't ever make a potato salad without roasting the potatoes from now on. It makes a huge difference.

I just now made this for dinner tonight. I love it! Lots of flavor.I added some tarragon and mustard to it. It isn't even cold yet and it is yummy already. I roasted the potatoes in a little bacon fat as well. I like the fact that this is not your ordinary old salad. Thank You Ginger.  Update: While it is true that I liked this,and when I made it, I thought the family would like it too. Well, it turns out, they don't:( everyone tried it, I was the only one to try it warm, the rest ate it cold. Even my unpicky,will eat almost everything,kid did not like it.They did not like the eggs and bacon in it.  Sorry.

I have NEVER in my entire life had a potato salad that I would eat more than the obligatory two bites ..... until I made this one.  It is sooo good.  I have actually made this twice in the past month and both times, my husband and I were fighting over who got the last bite.  This really is the best potato salad you will ever have.

UPDATE July 2012:
I've made this many times over the past several years.  The only changes I make are: to do the main cooking of the potatoes in the microwave (faster!) and to then stick them under the broiler for a couple of minutes just to crisp them up, chop up spring onions (1 bunch) instead of a regular onion (i don't like biting into raw onion), and I like to eat it warm rather than cold.

This was sooo good!  I made some changes.  I roasted yukon gold potatoes w/EVOO, fresh minced rosemary, garlic, salt and pepper until golden brown. Then, I added a little garlic powder when I combined the other ingredients.  Yummy! The rosemary gives a nice flavor.  I'll be making this again and again. Thanks!!

Fabulous potato salad. Can't wait to try it today. Was wonderful right after making it. Might add a little chopped celery but will surely use this method again and again.

Very nice.  This does not make a lot of potato salad, but since it's only two of us, that's not a bad thing.  I added spices to the potatoes, as another reviewer did:  I put the onions (dried, minced), paprika, rosemary, and garlic powder on the potatoes before baking, then added salt, pepper, and parsley after baking.  You don't need quite as much mayo as called for--I just eyeballed and tasted until I got the correct amount.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this a few times and everyone has loved it and I'm always asked for the recipe.  I make it even easier and substitute a (~1.2oz or so?) bottle/bag of real bacon pieces (not Bacos) for the 6 bacon strips.  I'm guessing that six cooked pieces of regular bacon may provide more actual weight of bacon.  But I found the bag/bottle works just fine and saves time.

I make this all the time, has a close resemblance to the potato salads I grew up with as a military brat in Germany.  The bacon is probably healthyer than the fat back the Germans used.  I keep precooked bacon in the fridge to be ready for cooking.  I rarely measure, just add in what seems good.  I also used powdered onion if I am out, so I also started adding a little powder even if I add chopped, it blends in to the mayo nicer.  I also have to leave the eggs out for hubby, so I cut the amount and add them on the table.

I have to say that I never would have thought to roast potatoes for a cold potato salad, but this is a winner. The only slight change I made, was to add part Greek yogurt and part mayo and I used the already cooked crumbled bacon. I just tossed the bacon pieces in with the hot potatoes on the cookie sheet so the flavors would meld.
I am printing this recipe and keeping it handy. It is fabulous and such a nice change. Thanks

I have been making this for years, only I toss the potatoes in olive oil and a packet of taco seasoning before roasting. Delicious! Oh, and I always use green onions and real mayo, not the sweeter Miracle Whip.

I made this for a pot luck, and it was a huge hit. It would have been absolutely fabulous made exactly like the recipe, but I did a few things differently. First, I omitted the hard boiled eggs and bacon. I substituted green onion for the medium onion. Also, when I roasted my potatoes, instead of just using a greased pan, I tossed them in a little olive oil and garlic. When I put everything together, I added just a splash of vinegar.
Also, I was concerned that omitting the eggs and bacon cost me a couple of servings, so I bulked up the salad with some fresh broccoli. I didn't change the amount of mayo, and it worked out perfectly. I got a a ton of compliments.

I served this at a New Years party and it got rave reviews !!!  The roasted potatoes (and I roasted my onions as well ) really added a wonderful taste and texture.  I brushed my potatoes with Zesty Italian dressing before sticking them in the oven which gave them an extra kick.  I doubled the amount of potatoes to 4 lbs. and added more mayo and 1/4 cup of sour cream.  I also added shredded sharp cheddar cheese  which gave it a nice color.  I will never boil potatoes again !!!

This was really, really good with some changes. Before roasting the potatoes I seasoned with a mixture of olive oil, McCormick's Steakhouse Grinders seasoning (a mix of black and pink peppercorns, sea salt, etc); a little garlic salt; a healthy sprinkling of paprika, dried dill, dried parsley and dried chives. I roasted these for about 45 minutes to ensure good browning. One reviewer had caramelized the onions and I did the same with about half of a sliced onion which I mixed in with the hot potatoes right out of the oven. Sprinkled about 3 tablespoons chopped green onion and a teaspoon of dried chives over this and mixed - the smell was heavenly! I added about three heaping tablespoons of mayo (pre-mixed with some paprika, a tsp. of lemon juice and some garlic powder) to the potatoes and stirred until just coated. Added two chopped hard-boiled eggs. No bacon as we don't eat it. This was a great potato salad with wonderful flavors. We'll see how the refrigerated leftovers are today, but we loved it warm!

Since I'm not a "mushy potato salad" fan, I was looking forward to making this..especially since it has bacon (how can you lose). It was easy to make, but after following the recipe, I found it to be bland. Maybe I just prefer everything with kick..so I added some celery and celery salt, garlic seasoning and used green onions instead of regular onions. It was a big hit with my guests and one even said she normally hates all potato salad, but loved this one.

LOVED it!  I had gone to a picnic once and had something similar.  I was thrilled to find your recipe.  The only addition I had was to put fresh chopped garlic in the may/sour cream mixture.  Fantastic!

I made this without the eggs (yucko!) and used a packet of ranch salad dressing mix instead of just paprika and it was wonderful! this is now my potato salad recipe!

I love roasted potatoes, so I thought this was a great idea from the beginning.  I do it a little differently however.  Spray the baking sheet with olive oil spray, lay out potatoes and spray them with olive oil as well. Salt and pepper potatoes generously and bake about 3/4 of the way done.  Add crumbled bacon to top of potatoes and place back in oven until potatoes are finished.  I used about 2 tbsp light mayo and 3/4 cup light sour cream to make the sauce and then add shredded cheddar cheese to the mix.  I did not put in onion or the eggs this go around but may try the eggs next time.  Great recipe!  The whole two pounds was gone almost instantly for only 5 people.  If you're making this for a crowd, be sure to increase the recipe!

This was a hit when I took it to our friend's cottage.  I roasted the onions along with the potatos for half the cooking time.  I also cut the Mayo in half, and added ¼ cup sour cream and ¼ cup softened cream cheese, along with some grilled vegetable seasoning.  Everyone thought the "roasting" idea was awesome.

I've made this twice in the last week.  The first time I did not like it it was to bland but we already committed to take it to another party.  Both times I used 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream like many of the other recipes suggested but what changed it to a five star the last time I used the correct amount of salt and then unbeknowsnt to me my husband who was helping put some salt on the potatoes before roasting and would put a few grinds in everytime he mixed it up.  We are not big salt fans around our house that is why I only put a pinch in the first time but this recipe deffinetly needs the salt to work.  I also put more bacon in both times I made the recipe but that was more of our own prefrence.

I really like roasting the potatoes, this is a very nice change of pace from the typical potato salad.  However, I think that it was bland overall.  I made the first batch following the recipe, let it rest overnight, and I still wasn't entirely impressed.  The second batch came out better, I added a touch of garlic powder, salt and pepper to the potatoes prior to roasting them, and this helped somewhat.  I added onion powder to the salad as well, but it still is not nearly as wonderful as I had hoped.  I am going to have to keep looking for that perfect recipe.

We did not like this with the roasted potatoes. The potatoes are very dry once you bite into them because of being roasted.

This is a middle of the road recipe for me.  It needed serious tweaking before serving to my family.  I LOVE the idea of roasting the potatoes...why didn't I think of that sooner?  However, I could see no point in wasting the drippings from the bacon, so I drizzled THAT over my potatoes before roasting...and added some minced garlic and onion.  I used a light hand on the mayo because I knew that if I used ONLY mayo for the "dressing" that would dictate the taste.  I used sour cream to compensate.  I left out the eggs because I don't care for them.  I also added some celery.  My family LOVED the tweaked version!  Thanks!

Wonderful and easy potato salad. I got rave reviews from my toughest critics.  The only thing I did differently was to roast minced garlic, about 4 cloves, with the potatoes.  The garlic added a ton of flavor.  I also can't eat raw onions, so I left those out.  They weren't missed.

I added garlic, salt & pepper to potatoes as the cooked, but kept everything the same. SOmething I wont make every week, due to calories, but nice to make for a potluck (which is what I did & it all was eaten)To review this recipe as written, is a 3.

Absolutely the best potato salad I have ever made.  I was skeptical because of the mayo and we are a mustard family, but I cut the mayo half.  It is delicious.  My onions were a little bit to strong so I roasted them with potato.  I also used real bacon bits and it tasted great.  Will make again.

Very very good - just make sure you cook the potatoes longer.  I am not sure how long I ended up cooking them but it still wasn't enough.  The flavor was excellent and it was easy to make

This was good.  Did add celery, but wouldn't need to change a thing.  Wouldn't use this as my potato salad all the time, but would be good when you are tired of the same recipe and want something with a different flare.

Don't normally 'review' recipes but had to on this one. I've made potato salad all my adult life & never thouhgt about 'roasting' the potatoes, thus, eliminating the peeling time. Used parchment paper as 1 person suggested~perfect. Added chopped sweet pickle & celery for crunch & left out the bacon (may try next time:-) Thank you so much for making my hectic life so much easier. Fabulous recipe!!!

I made this today with the Beer Brat recipe on this site by Zach and wow, what a great Memorial day dinner!!  I will never prepare potato salad the conventional way again!  This was sooooo easy! Roasting the potatoes was much better than boiling them, I always cooked them too long and they got mushy!  This is a no fail recipe! And it tasted soooo good!!  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!  Yum! Yum!

I could eat my weight in this potato salad! The mayo mixture probably needs to be increased, as listed in this recipe, but I have made it so many times that I don't look at the recipe exactly anyway. This is actually best fresh made, at room temperature, not cold. You can taste all of the ingredients at room temperature, and the salad has not become dry. I have to mix some more mayo and sour cream in the day after, but it could be because in my haste to hurry up and eat it, I don't put enough in the first time!

I made this for my son's 1st birthday party and EVERYONE loved it. I don't like onions personally so I omitted them, but I have still been asked for the recipe a bunch of times. Thanks!

This was a great potato salad! I altered it just a smidge. I used 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo. I omitted the eggs and added celery. I added celery seed seasoning (I just love that season added in). I also roasted the potatoes with the salt/pepper seasoning on them. Yummy! Will be making again.

OMG....this recipe is SO EASY and SO DELICIOUS!  Its my new, go-to recipe.  I wasn't sure how "different" it would be, but roasting the potatoes made a huge difference.  I would highly recommend this recipe.  YUM!!!!

Very easy to make following the instructions.  I substituted sour cream for some of the mayo.  Everyone at the picnic kept saying it was the best potato salad they'd ever eaten.

I add a little olive oil when roasting potatoes. I mix Mayo with miracle whip since the slightly sweet tastes good with the bacon. People always say they love this and I always make a double batch!

This was really good. I customized it quite a bit by adding celery, dijon mustard and some buttermilk. Roasting the potatoes is a fabulous idea.

Very good recipe. I actually boiled the potatoes instead and added the eggs to the water. So when the potatoes were done so were the eggs. I really liked the recipe as is, however I did add more pepper and bacon.

After reading several of the reviews, I expected something wonderful.  Unfortunately, my family and guests found this potatoe salad bland and not tasty.  I ended up throwing most of it out.  I went back to re-read the recipe, sure I messed up, but had not.

Roasting the potatoes in the oven gave this salad a new twist. I found it much easier than the boiling method, and all of the pieces of potato were perfectly done.  I would make this again, but it will not replace my old stand-by recipe for potato salad.

I definitely put my own spin on this.  I added the onions in during the roasting and drizzled olive oil over the potatoes.  I added some cheese and ranch dressing after the potatoes were roasted and served it hot.  It was delicious.

I have never been good at making potato salad - until now. This will be my go-to recipe. I did add a bit of olive oil, salt, pepper, and lots of herbs (dried rosemary, thyme, etc.) to my potatoes before roasting them, and I used scallions instead of regular onions.

This was very tasty. I had to substitute the rosemary for oregano and i didn't add any eggs. but the out come was great. I used a little more bacon than suggested as well. Also the timing for the roasting of the potatoes was way off. It took 45 minutes for the potatoes to roast. overall great recipe.

I have made this several times for my family and they have loved it.  I took it to a potluck last night and it got rave reviews.  I did leave out the bacon due to several people at the potluck do not eat pork.  It was still excellent.  I have also added cilentro, which added a nice kick.

The potatoes took way longer than 30 minutes to cook BUT they were tasty and the clean up was a breeze. I cut the mayo with sour cream and BUT it definitely needed more of it, it was very "sticky", I also added dill, garlic powder, 2tsp of Dijon and celery. Overall, a good start but needs some tweaking.

Great new way to make potato salad, we love the smokiness that roasting the potatoes gives it.  If you are not big on mayo, try 1/2 cup first and then add as needed.

I made this to take to a BBQ... everyone went nuts over it!  People were asking "Who made the potato salad?" all night!
I used turkey bacon and fat free mayo (and reduced the mayo to 3/4 cup). DELICIOUS!

This is a very quick and easy recipe. I used Miricle Whip and added celery. The flavor was a little bland so I used rosemary. The rosemary added a unique flavor that made it extra good. I would definatly pick some fresh herbs next time and season to taste.

Very nice! I made a few changes to make this a little more low calorie.  I cut the red potatoes up and roasted them in the oven with garlic, salt, pepper and rosemary for 15 minutes.  Then I cut up the onion and mixed it in with the potatoes and roasted for another 20 minutes.  I used the eggs the same, but I used thin sliced center cut bacon.  After everything cooled I used 1/2 cup fat-free mayo and 1/2 cup fat free sour cream. Very good.. even with the changes!

I was very excited to make this recipe as I love roasted red potatoes.  I did make a couple changes due to personal taste preference in our household.  I omitted the onions, substituted finely chopped celery, used Miracle Whip instead of mayo and added a dollop of spicy deli mustard.
The taste was fastastic right after I made it (while it was still warm).  However, after chilling several hours before I served it...I found it very dry & less tasty than earlier.  I told my husband it was excellent when I tried it warm so he heated his up & thought it brought out the flavors better.  I have leftovers so I think I will add a little more Miracle Whip and mustard & serve it warm with our dinner tonight.

After being so anxious to try this recipe, I was highly disappointed with the outcome.  The only change I made was to add sour cream as others had suggested. It definitely needs a little more kick. More sour cream?? ** After chilling the salad for about 5 hours, I took it out of the fridge and found that it was really dry.  I ended up making another batch of the mayo/sour cream mix to add some moisture.

This was very tasty. I followed the suggestion of a few other reviewers and roasted the potatoes with EVOO, the onion, rosemary, garlic, salt & pepper. Thought it could use a little something extra. Next time I may add a little dijon mustard just for a bit more flavor.

This recipe was so easy and got rave reviews!  Definitely the only way I will make potato salad from now on.  The only change I made was to toss the potatoes with some EVOO, rosemary, garlic powder, salt and pepper before roasting.  I also did as others had suggested and threw in a couple stocks of celery to add to the crunch.  Definitely a keeper!!

I like the Red Potatoes with the skins for the salad.  It is much tastier.

Roasting the potatoes is definitely the way to go, it adds a whole different level of flavor to the dish.  Excellent!

We liked this recipe a lot.  The second time I made it I cooked my potatoes until they were *very* well done and they sort of fell apart when I mixed everything together.  We liked that softer texture better than chunks of potato.
