great recipe. Most on this site end up sticky to the touch. This was light and moist. Made it into cupcakes and they were perfect.

This ended up being FAR too rich for even the biggest chocolate fan at the party. Sinful is right...

It turned out okay, but nothing really stands out about it.  It tasted like it could have been made from a box.  However, frosting was wonderful! Next time I'll try this frosting with a different cake recipe.

It's a little dry.  Taste isn't too bad, but I'm not fond of the texture.  The kids really like it, so I might make it again for them, but it wouldn't stand up to company. It just isn't a special enough cake.  Nothing about it jumps out at you.
