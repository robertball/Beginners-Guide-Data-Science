My picky 9yr old likes nothing but he ate these chops! I used 6 boneless cuts and had mayonaise and mustard to spare. I also used about a tsp. more of the brown sugar and about a cup and a half of milk. They were delicious and named after my hometown too!

I didn't have particularly thick chops but they took an hour fifteen to be tender. By then all "sauce" was gone. What "sauce" there was the 12 year old liked; but not the pork chop itself. 14 said it would be good without the sauce.:/:D Seems this one to pass on at this house.

I used chicken breasts instead and loved it. The chicken stayed so moist. Thanks!

This was ok. I followed as written exept I cooked mine in the crock pot. About an hour before it was finished I mixed 1 Tbsp of flour and 1 Tbsp butter together and whisked it in the sauce to thicken it. The sauce was a little sweet but otherwise good.

I was very disappointed with the sauce. Although my husband thought the porkchop taste was good the sauce was watery with clumps of mayonaise everywhere. It looked horrible! Did I miss something?

Delicious! Chops were tender but not greasy. I made them as written next time I'll try substituting half and half for the milk and spicy brown mustard for the yellow. I believe these slight modifications will yield perfection.
