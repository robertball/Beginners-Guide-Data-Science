SO GOOD.  I've made this several times and there are never any leftovers.  I've only made 2 changes - I do not use pasta simply to cut calories.  I serve it tossed with lettuce, spinach or a greens combo; and I never have plain yogurt so I use fat free free mayo.  I was skeptical of the apple the first time I made it and only used 1/2 an apple, but the apple is a delicious part of the salad and I always use a whole apple now.  I'm so glad this recipe was posted.

The recipe as it is is probably a four or fewer star, but I read the comments prior to making.  I doubled the salmon and the pasta and the ratio of pasta to dressing was really good.  Very tasty dressing, and now I have leftovers.

Next time, I am going to double the apples as well.  Very simple to make, but allow a little more time than advertised (to cook the pasta and the salmon).

I will definitely make this again!  Thanks!

The curry was a bit overwhelming so I would suggest using a tsp rather than a tbsp. I prebaked the salmon with an assortment of dill, garlic & onion powder, salt, pepper, and a dash of lemon zest. It worked wonderfully although using more salmon than what the recipe calls for is fully recommended. I also always use green or granny smith apples with my chicken apple curry soup and thought they would serve better than red in this recipe which was true in my personal opinion. And just to have a lil creative fun I used the bow tie pasta for the that ridge "fin" like look just to go with the salmon feel. Overall not my favorite but definitely a nice twist for impressing guests while trying something very new. . .

We were pleasantly surprised! My daughter even wanted 3rds!  I did not add the curry because we don't have any. We did add a an of mandarin oranges and that was delicious!

I tried adapting this recipe a bit by serving the salmon and sauteed onions over linguine tossed with apples and walnuts, spooning the sauce on top. I wasn't impressed. Next time I'll try it as written and see if it changes my opinion. The sauce was lacking something, I just can't figure out what. Maybe more lemon juice? Or some sort of basil or dill?

There was too much sauce and I thought 1/2 cup pasta was too little.  Maybe double it next time.  Otherwise easy to put together.

WOW! excellent combination. I overcooked our salmon the night before. So I was looking for something to redeem it. This salad definitely deserves the high ratings it has received. I'm not sure how much salmon we included, probably more than the 8oz called for. Everything else, I followed the instructions exactly. Everybody has their own preference of the amount of curry. But this made a perfect balance for my wife and I. We will definitely use this again, whether or not I overcook the entree.

This was wonderful! We had a guest who doesn't like canned salmon, so I used a can of chicken instead. Didn't have any yogurt so I used mayonaise and eliminated the olive oil. I also increased the amount of dressing and would increase it even more next time. I added a handful of dried cranberries, which gave it nice color and a bit more texture. I will make this again!!

this was a nice change for a tuna salad.  i did add some extra lemon juice as i used greek yogurt and it was a bit thick.  i think my curry must have been a bit old as i found the tbsp didn't overpower at all.

Delicious! I made only two servings of it, and ended up doubling the pasta, but otherwise made it exactly as-is. It turned out great! I think this would also be really good without pasta and used in place of a chicken salad on a sandwich or over greens. Thanks!

I made it without the salmon. I used broccoli instead of celery. And it was quite good. I think you could add chicken or tuna as well, but I liked it as a veggie/pasta salad.

I have made this several times and love it just as is! My preference is room temperature but can also be served cold.

I loved this! I did make some changes and additions, though. I used the tri-colored spiral pasta and doubled the amount of both pasta and salmon. I don't care for raw white or yellow onions, so used green onions. Didn't have yogurt, so used light mayo and left out the olive oil. Used unsalted peanuts and took the advice of one reviewer and tossed in some dried cranberries. Served at a pot-luck salad luncheon and got rave reviews!

This is excellent!  I've made it as written and loved it.  However last night I didn't have any salmon, nor an apple.  So I used cooked chicken and threw in some frozen peas.  Also excellent! Another thing I do on occasion is to use coarsely chopped peanuts in place of the walnuts. The dressing is perfect and can be used with a variety of ingredients.

Made exactly as written and while it was good, I thnk it lacked something. (But, before you add anything, I'd suggest you let it sit in the fridge for a few hours and then taste -- it changes from the time it's made to the time it's served if you give it a few hours.) Anyway, I added some garlic salt and some onion salt - just to taste - and that gave it a little more zing. Overall the recipe is good.

I needed a dressing for grilled salmon salad (on spinach and romaine with some quinoa cooked in chicken broth and curry powder; the salmon was grilled just with olive oil, salt and pepper). This dressing was GREAT! Took forever to find a small container of plain fatfree yogurt (finally found that Stonyfield makes one) - I was about to swap lite sour cream if I couldn't find it but I'm glad I did. Made the dressing exactly as is and let it sit for about 30-60 minutes. The husband loved it and at it as it, but I also felt like it was missing something - it needed a hint of sweetness. A couple of glugs of honey really made this perfect for me.  This is our new favorite summer time dinner!

This salad is very delicious on a warm summer day, and leftover smoked salmon in the refrigerator. I cut back on the pasta to 1/2 cup, and added greens - a nice combination.  Also, Greek yogurt is my preference so added extra fresh lemon juice.  This is a keeper.

Excellent dish!  I followed several other suggestions by doubling pasta and salmon, and added a bit more of the chopped onions, celery and apple.  Also used granny smith apples.  Made for a pot luck lunch at work and it was very well liked!

Did not care for this at all. The curry was too strong in this sauce and I am a curry lover. All I could taste was onion and curry.
