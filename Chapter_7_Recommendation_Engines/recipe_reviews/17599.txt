I used a white cake mix instead of the strawberry, because I couldnt' find one.  :)  It was DELICIOUS!  I think that the reason some of the reviewers' cakes did not turn out is because of too much water.  It says in the recipe to follow the directions on the box, but to use 4 cups of water.  The directions on the box says 2 cups.  I used 2 cups and it worked perfectly.  I highly reccomend this to people who don't like a rich cake.  It is light and fluffy, perfect for a summer day!

Everyone loved this cake! I made a few changes just because it was what I had on hand. I used a white cake mix in 2 round cake pans. As soon as the cakes were done, I poked holes in the tops with a fork about 1 inch apart. Then I slowly poured 1 box of strawberry jello (following the directions on the box) over the top of the cakes while both were sill warm. Divide the jello between the cakes. Then topped with cool whip and strawberries and chill for 1 hour. It turned out delicious and pretty. Very easy and inexpensive to make. Thanks for the recipe. I will definatly make this a favorite!!

this was an excellent, light dessert.  I made the jello as the package directed (1 cup hot water 1 cup cold water) and did as another review suggested by poking the cake several times with a toothpick as soon as it came out of the oven and then poured the liquid jello over top and then put it in the fridge for 3 hours before puting the whip cream and strawberries on top.  A huge hit with everyone in my family!

Perfect light summer cake!  Another tip: 4 cups of water is for 6 oz of gelatin.  Recipe calls for 3 OZ!!  Therefore, you only need 2 cups of water.  Definitely will make again... thanx!

I used white cake mix and only two cups of water for the jello.  When the cake came out of the oven, I poked holes in it and poured the jello over it.  It gave the cake a beautiful pink marble look.  Everyone enjoyed this.

I made this cake twice.  The first time it came out perfect! The second time, it was too wet.  I think I figured it out though, you have to gauge how many holes you poke into the cake.  Too many will make the cake too wet and ruin it.  

Other than that I L-O-V-E this recipe.  I also used Raspberry jello... it was awesome!

This cake was awesome, but I too used only 2 cups of water in the gelatin as directed on the package.  I topped it with cream cheese/whipping cream dressing I adapted from recipes on this site and decorated with fresh strawberries (in sugar).  Wow.  Several folks told me it was the best cake they think they've ever eaten.  And it is very simple to make.  I usually always make cakes "from scratch" but I believe I've been won over to using box mixes once in a while.  Good recipe!

This was a terrific recipe!  It was very fast and easy to make, extremely moist and not overly sweet.  It would be a perfect dessert to serve during the summer because it tastes very fresh and cool.  I used a fat-free egg substitute and fat-free Cool Whip whipped cream so this dessert was completely fat-free!  I will definitely try it again!

I'll give this a 5 assuming that the 4 cups of water was meant to be 2 for the 3oz of gelatin. The cake alone is very sweet. But with unsweetened slices of strawberry, it's very nice! Much like strawberry shortcake. I made this like a poke cake, poking holes in the cake before pouring on the jello. Thanks for the recipe!

It was too sweet for us. I think it's because of the jello (flavored gelatin). Easy to make so i'll keep this recipe, for the big party but i probably won't crave for this.

I agree with the last reviewer... this cake was mushy and wet.  I triple checked the recipe because I thought it was strange to pour 4 cups of liquid on the cake.  In the end, I put about 3/4 of it on and it still came out to be extremely wet.  The taste was good, but the texture left a lot to be desired.

This was very good!  I used a white cake (which I think had some almond extract in it) so it was very light and fluffy.  Not as much of the jello ran into the cake as I would have liked so I think I need to poke bigger holes next time.  It also held up well in the fridge for several days after I made it.

I used 2 cups of water not 4.  I also mixed some cream cheese with the whipped topping.  I cut strawberry's in half and coated with powered sugar - placed in fridge overnight then poured the strawberry juice over cake before covering with whipped topping mixture.  It came out very moist and yummy!  I also used strawberry cake mix.

This is a very light cake. Wonderful for summer.
BUT!! The water amount are off. Use 2 cups of water for Jello and all will be well. 4 cups will never, ever jell right. Easy and quick to make!!

Incredibly moist is right.  How sad that I made this in a rush without reading the reviews!  The flavor of my cake was nice, but I could literally hear a "squish" sound when took a bite.  It's not inedible, but definitely be sure to use 2 cups of water instead of 4. The whipped topping was great, and strawberry slices made it even better.

This is light and delicious, a perfect summer dessert.  As many other people mentioned it works best with only the water directions given on the jello package though.  I tried it twice, once with a strawberry flavored cake mix, and once with a white cake mix.  I much preferred it with the strawberry cake mix.  Although the white cake mix was pretty with the strawberry jello running through it, it was also kind of dull.

I poke holes in the cake and then pour the jello over the cake...I also use a big box of jello and use one cup boiling water and one cup cold..Not too wet when you only use 2 cups total. I also put the smashed strawberries mixed with sugar and put on top of cake then I put cool whip on top of that.  Very good.

AMAZING CAKE!  What a hit.  I did like others suggested and only used 2c of water.   The cake looked beautiful and tasted light and sweet.  I added some coconut flakes to the border of the frosting which was a nice added treat, but didn't overpower because I didn't put it on the whole cake.  Definitely a keeper!

When I first tried this cake the first time, I was short on time.  I spread the whipped topping while the cake was still warm.  The topping melted on the cake and it did not look pretty.  Nevertheless, it still tasted great.  I definately recommend putting the whipped topping after the cake has cooled off.  I have since tried it a second time and waited on spreading the frosting and it made a huge difference on appearance.  It tastes great!

Wow delicious! It was easy and it tasted healthy, not a heavy dessert. Will definitly make this recipe again, and try it with white cake with a  different flavored gelatin. I had yellow cake mix and I bought a 6oz box of strawberry gelatin (counldn't find 3oz at the store). Per other reviews I also used 2 cups of water (1 hot, 1 cold). I put  all 6oz on the cake and it still tasted delicious! I also poked holes into my cake before I added the gelatin, and refrigerated it for 3 hours. Thank you the recipe.

Great Cake, easy to make! I only had an hour to let it sit in the fridge once I poured on the jello- and it still came out great! (The recipe directions confused me when it said 4 cups water for jello b/c the 3oz. jello called for 2 cups- so I followed the box direction).

This just wasn't great. I expected more from it.  It was  like a refrigerated strawberry cake mix.  Not good to us at all! Try the lemon cooler cream cake instead.  I think that is a superior recipe. I won't make this again. Sorry!

I made cupcakes with this, it's a little messy but they turned out well. I used a fork to punch holes in the cupcakes and then poured the jello on top. I followed the jello box directions and only used 2 cups of water, 4 would have been way too much.

This was a very good cake. I had to use white cake mix but I like the way it looked! Also only used the 2 cups of water. There are so many different ways you could make this cake. Next Time I'm going to do a lemon cake with maybe a lime or orange jello. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I agree with the other reviewers - use the amount of water according to the gelatin box. My cake is mushy, but it tastes good! I'm going to serve it anyway because it's more like pudding and the whipped topping and strawberries will make it even more delicious. Next time I'll decrease the water to 2 cups.

Terrific! I used yellow cake mix because I wanted the "marble" look. It was tasty and gorgeous at the same time. Two things I did differently was to poke holes after the cake was baked with a fork and used only 2 cups of water for the gelatin. I was able to make the recipe healthier by substituting the oil for applesauce, eggs for eggbeaters, sugarfree jello mix and fat free coolwhip. Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful, only used 2 cups water for the jello (plus a little bit more plus a little bit of veg oil)used white cake mix as I could not find strawberry mix and it turned out great (I think it did, I never got a piece!!).  Sprinkled a little bit of icing sugar on the top for effect and I think the strawberries were a little bit tart so the icing sugar evened everything out.

This is nice for a summer picnic. Kids love it! All I had on hand was a Classic Yellow cake mix and strawberry-banana sugar-free Jello (made with 2 cups of water). It came out really good. However, next time I will use a strawberry cake mix and strawberry Jello.

I followed the directions completely and found that the cake turned out extremely wet.  I left it in the refrigerator for a day or so and I still had to pour off excess liquid.  I was very disappointed.

I used a white mix instead of strawberry. The one i had on hand was the "party swirl" kind with the dye packets to color the mix.  Instead of using them as directed i mixed both into the entire batter and the cake ended up a nice purpley blue color.  When i added the jello, I poked holes in the cake first so it absorbed more in some spots.  The cake ended up being quite pretty and tasted good too!

Recipe calls to frost the cake with thawed whipped topping. I didn't think that it would actually frost and not melt or run. I made a whipped topping frosting with cream cheese, powdered sugar and vanilla and it frosted and tasted beautifully.
