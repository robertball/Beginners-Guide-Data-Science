I used regular onion soup mix with 1 cup of water, and 1 cup of beer (Alexander Keiths) and the taste was amazing.  The meat was so tender that I found the bones sitting in the bottom of the crock pot, and the sauce mixture was delicious.  The sauce was so good that I baked bread so we could have hot roast beef sandwiches the following day.  I will definitely make this again, but may slightly reduce the thyme from 1 tsp to 1/2 or 3/4 tsp.

I looked this up for our daughter, then thought well OK I'd give them a try, OMG! I couldn't believe how good they were.  I'm a pretty darn good cook and I usually take HOURS with my short ribs, smoking, then brasing, then blah blah blah. These were AWESOME.  I picked all the meat off the bones at the end, meanwhile I added Red Wine and a little thickener to the gravey.  I served them over mashed potatoes.  We had a big Shiraz from Austalia.  I would serve these to my gourmet club in a martini glass over mashed potatoes as an appetizer.  Just enough to have them begging for more.  They are VERY RICH, so you don't need a lot.  ENJOY and Thanks

I usually only try recipes that have been reviewed many times and have a good average rating. But, when I saw this recipe I knew I would love it. I was not put off by 2 out of 4 people that did not like it. Neither should you be. If you like the taste of meat cooked in beer (which is a little bit different, if you've never had it you may not expect what it will taste like) you will love this recipe. There is only one thing I would change (very small) in the whole thing: Chop up a couple of shallots and saute them with the garlic in a very small amount of oil or butter before you add them to the slow cooker. The shallots give it that extra umph and browning the garlic a little bit improves the flavor of the entire dish. Also, make sure you choose a nice dark beer, and one that you like. You will taste it. Enjoy! Its worth it!

this is an amazing recipe.  my kids who range from 4 to 10 just ate these up and they usually don't eat anything new.  the ribs were done in about 6 -7 hours on low heat but i kept cooking them another hour or so and i could not pull a piece of meat out by the bone.  they just slid right out and the flavor was amazing.  i love guiness so i did not hesitate to use it in the sauce.

I made these and they were delicious! I used Amber Bach beer (it's a dark beer) and it gave them such a wonderful flavor.  I even used the liquid they cooked in to make gravy for the mashed potatoes. My boyfriend loved these and I will definitely make them again.

DEEELICIOUS!!!!! Definitly use a darker beer tho...you get LOTS of flavor from these ribs, and don't worry about the alcohol part-it cooks away leaving a wonderful taste sensation for your tongue ; ) These ribs wil absolutly melt in your mouth!!! Everyone who tastes these will rave about all of the flavor, you can tweek with extra garlic etc. according to your tastes, but the original recipe here is a VERY good one!!

I seasoned the ribs with salt and pepper, dredged them in flour, and sauteed them in oil until golden brown on all sides. Removed them from pan, then added the garlic (along with 2 finely chopped shallots) and cooked that until slightly browned. I combined all the other ingredients in a bowl and added the garlic/shallots to the bowl, put the ribs in the slow cooker, and poured the bowl over the ribs. Then I cooked them for 3 HOURS ON LOW!! Yes, LOW. The ribs came out perfect; fork tender, still clinging to the bone,  but not turned to mush! Nice meaty, dark, full, "simmered all day" flavor. Awesome recipe!!

I used 2 lbs of good quality short ribs. The slow cooker method makes for very tender ribs but this recipe needs a lot of "seasoning" work. I also dredged the ribs in seasoned flour and braised on all sides. Halfway through the cooking process, I tasted the cooking luiquid. Worchester sauce, black pepper and sea salt to the rescue! Adding 1 -2 tbsp of Beef Better Than Boullion helped too. Had to add about 1/3 cup more flour to get the right consistancy for gravy. The cooking time of 9 hours was correct for my ribs. I'll work on my own recipe next time.

Turned out quite nicely.  I substituted Golden Mushroom for the French Onion soup and used a local microbrewed IPA for the beer.  It had a slightly bitter undertaste due to the strong beer, but it worked quite well with this dish.  The liquid also reduced to a nice gravy.  The only suggestion I would make is to prepare the ribs a day in advance and refrigerate so the fat congeals and can be discarded since short ribs are so fatty.  It would probably have a better taste too, like pot roast does on the following day.

Oh my gawd!  Why this recipe isn't rated higher - I don't know.  This was yummy for my tummy!  I did make some modifications for example, used a dutch oven, I cooked the garlic and onions first in butter then added the meat and cooked until brown.  I also added fresh thyme to the dish and my cook time was a lot less - I believe about 2.5 hrs.  This is definately a keeper.

I was very disappointed.  These were very tender, however, I just did not care for the taste/lack of taste.  I went ahead and bought short ribs even though they looked extremely fatty, I should of chose another rib selection.  If I make these again I will do something different.  No beer, a different cut of ribs, a lot more seasonings.

The short ribs at my grocery were very fat so I substituted a couple of beef shanks at half the price.  Each shank has a big marrow bone which lends a lot of flavor.  We really enjoyed these.

After reading all the other comments, I rubbed "better than boullion-vegetable" on each rib before going into the slow cooker, this improved the flavor tremendously. I really like this recipe, the beer is awsome and also the brown sugar.

My primary displeasure could just be because of the nature of the meat--it's fatty. But I tried to see past that in my evaluation of this recipe. To me, the flavor was just not that enjoyable. That, in combination with the fattiness of the meat, made this recipe a "one and done" for me.   I did enjoy how easy it was, and it sounded like it would be really good, and clearly, it is to some, just wasn't to my liking.

I'm not a short rib fan (hence 4 stars) but my husband is. I'm a sauce fan and the recipe was a hit for both my husband and I, although the next time I will cut back the brown sugar to 1 tbsp as it was a tad sweet for our tastes. I'll also try the browned shallots. I had the sauce on egg noodles while my husband ate just the meat.

These were very good and tender.  We used Guinness beer and the flavor of that was a little strong.  Still good, but next time we might try a different beer.

This was very good.  Next time, I will remove some of the broth at the end of cooking, and refrigerate to bring fat up to top.  Then will skim, and reheat in a saucepan, will thicken if necessary.  I am sure it will make a killer gravy.  As is, broth was very greasy, to be expected with the cut of meat.  It has potential!

This recipe is amazingly good!!!!  I sautéed my onions and garlic in butter removed them from the skillet and lined my crook pot with this goodness.  I then took my short ribs that were coated in flour, kosher salt ad thyme and brown sugar and braised them in the butter mixture add them to the crook pot.  I took a New Castle dark beer and deglazed my skillet and poured then juices into the crockpot only with the onion soup.  I seasoned with Morton's seasoning and let cook on low for 8 hours. The flavor was amazing the family loved it.  Didn't taste as if it were a pot roast like my ribs would normally taste.  The hubby and kids loved it!!!!

I made this for our dinner last night, 7/21/09 and we loved it! I did brown shallots and added a tablespoon of garlic as someone suggested.  I also used brown rice to put it over, and added baby corn, carrots, pea pods and water chestnuts for crunch. I used Blue Moon Ale.  Great flavor, easy to put together and definately a keeper.

I had to change it somewhat but the concept was wonderful.  The grocery store had no short ribs so I settled with stewing beef.  They also did not have the condensed soup that the recipe called for so I used a can of Campbells Cream of Mushroom and 1/2 package dry onion soup mix.  Used all the rest of ingredients as listed in recipe.  Cooked for 5 hrs on high and served over egg noodles.  Was VERY tasty.  Will make again.

The best beef rib recipes I have ever had.  I typically smoke them and my wife was never a total fan of beef ribs.  After this recipe we will be having ribs more often.  Great flavor and tender.

Fantastic!  I didn't have the condensed soup, so I used dry onion soup mix and a cup of water.  I added a little parsley and sage and a chopped onion.  We had a dinner guest and he asked me what kind of meat it was!  Incidently, I used half beef and half pork ribs; I like to do the same when making a couple of roasts.

These ribs were great.  My boyfriend loved them.  I did make a few changes as per some of the other reviews...I knew beef ribs would be very fatty so i cooked them the day before and shortened the cook time by an hour.  I put them in the fridge till the next morning all the fat had turned solid so i was able to scoop it right off. Pluged them back up and cooked the last hour on high.  I used goldend mushroom soup and they were wonderful served with homemade garlic mashed potatoes.  This one was a keeper.

Made this for dinner guests & family and you know what guests are like. I'm never sure if they are being honest or polite when they say something is good. - I found it very mild in flavor. The ribs were fall of the bone tender but something was missing. Will try again.

Totally tasty dish.  My ribs were very fatty so    almost at the end of the cooking I took my meat baster and removed the fat from the top.  I also used Onion soup as I could not find condensed French Onion soup.

It was a bit on the sweet side so next time I'll only add 1 tbsp brown sugar. I also didn't care for the taste from using the beer so next time I'll probably use beef broth. Other then that it was a good dish. Ribs were nice and tender and the sauce turned into a good gravy!

This wasn't bad!  I used boneless short ribs.  Instead of using cond. french onion soup, I used beef bouillon in 2 cups water, and added dry onion soup mix. I added extra garlic and about 1/2 tsp onion powder.  I also tossed in some baby portabella mushrooms at the start and toward the end added some sauteed onions.  Served over mashed potatoes.  One of my sons, my husband and my mom all went NUTS for it!  The other son doesn't care for meat in a crock pot.  But said it was tasty.  I cooked mine about 7 hours on low and I thickened the sauce at the end.
