I was looking for a way to use my leftover frozen corn and despite the rating I wasn't expecting to like it because it just isn't my thing...but I was so wrong.  It was amazing!  I made per recipe except since I have 2 young kids and anything with a little spice is too much for then\. Before I added the peppers I poured some into a pie plate and baked -pepper free- for them which worked perfectly.  The adult one with peppers was mild still but delicious seconds were served!

This dish was part of my Thanksgiving menu and it is surely a keeping.  If you want a twist on a traditional corn pudding this is a great go to.  We followed the recipe as is since it was the first time making, and there was nothing left after my guests made a first pass at the Buffett!

Thought it was very good. Did not have Poblanos so I used Ortega diced chiles and it was still very good.

This came out great.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a deep lasagna pan, which was a mistake.  The edges got dark before the middle was cooked.  Next time I will use two separate pans.  And maybe add more poblanos, they made the dish!

I made this as a side dish for Cinco de Mayo, the only difference being that I had to make it in my toaster oven, since our stove is on the fritz. I covered a small non-stick pan in foil I sprayed in olive oil, and kept a close eye on the timer I had to reset in the midst of cooking it, but it came out lightly browned and fully cooked.

I followed the recipe ingredients precisely. It was a nice, easy side dish to make, and I rather enjoyed the sweet note of it, in contrast with everything else on our plates just then (chicken enchiladas and other not-so-sweet things). 

Three other people in my house reported liking it especially. My husband commented it was too sweet, and I could see perhaps using a little less sugar; corn is sweet itself with butter. 

Nice pop of flavor with the peppers and corn, and it went well with refried beans, Mexican rice, sliced green onions and fresh cilantro. Â¡Muchas gracias por la receta!

This was very tasty. I think it could  have had a bit more  solidity than  it did.  Maybe the flour needs to be increased.

A big hit at Thanksgiving!  I've had several corn pudding  recipes this is the best.  But as advised by other reader used cream cheese instead of heavy whipping cream

Made it substituted 1% milk and fat free half and half. Turned out great! Loved the contrast of the slightly hot smoky poblanos to the corn. Will serve again.

I wanted to try this recipe because  l  love the combination of the ingredients, however, after I made it this recipe tasted more like an omelette than a pudding.  I really would make this dish for breakfast.  The reason I gave this recipe a two star was because I would not call it a pudding but rather a omelette.  Very flavorful dish to say the least.

I liked it and will make it again for another group. I may reduce the butter. It was not too sweet.

Too sweet.  I probably would probably eliminate the sugar, inasmuch as sweetness comes from the corn (I used fresh corn).

I made it as written, except I added only a tablespoon of sugar.  If you are a fan of sweet and savory together, the sugar is probably fine.  I'm not a fan so I was glad I cut back.  Even so, it was too sweet.  I will make it again with no sugar and more cheese.  Another note: I made it the night before, and then reheated it for T'giving. I'm not sure if that changed the consistency or not.  Next time, I will make and eat it  right away.

I made as directed and it was delicious! Mine needed an extra 10 minutes of cooking (70 minutes), maybe next time Iâll put it in a more shallow dish rather than the deeper dish I used. It was a big hit and everyone loved it!

This recipe is perfect. Just a spot on combination of sweet and savory. And so simple! My only variation was 1 hour, 20 minutes cooking time to firm the center and brown the edges.

I only put in 2 peppers and the zippiness was perfect.  Also used an applewood sharp cheddar and recipe was to die for.  My husband said it was his favourite dish that day!

Fantastic!  I had not worked with Poblanos before and it was fun!   I thought 4 peppers was going to be too spicy, but it was perfect.   Made recipe as stated and it was spot on yummy!

Brought this as a Thanksgiving side dish.  Everyone loved it.  I couldn't find the poblano peppers and the grocer told me  the Passila peppers were comparable.  But it lacked the smokey sweet  flavor.  I will definitely make this again but net time hope to use a pepper with slightly more heat.

Easy to bake and great side for my Thanksgiving dinner. Could try different cheeses. Will make again.
