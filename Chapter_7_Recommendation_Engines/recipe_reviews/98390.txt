There is a slight mistake on the recipe. My original calls for 1 Tablespoon (not teaspoon) of cinnamon and 1 Tablespoon of vanilla.

I have been making this granola recipe for over a year now and am finally getting to writing a review...WONDERFUL!!!  I find it too sweet if I use the honey, brown ugar and maple syrup. I omit the brown sugar entirely and use  cup maple syrup and a tablespoon of honey.  The nice thing about granola is that it's so easy to modify...I never use the same nuts or seed twice!!  Hazelnuts, pumpkin seeds (added later becuase they "pop"!), cashews are among my favorites.  Of course, the good ol standby peanuts and almonds never fail!  I bake about 200 for 40-45 mins, gives you more control over the level of toastiness (or burntness!) you desire.  I often will add in some flax seed meal, excellent health benefits.  I will try the coconut oil for health benefits (and flavor!)  Thank YOU!

Wow!  Thanks for the recipe.  By far the best granola I have ever had.  I eat it 5 or 6 times a week - as cereal, mixed with yogurt or as a dry snack.  For variations, try one or all of the following:  substitute coconut oil for regular oil (the health benefits are amazing), reduce sunflower seeds (they are a little over powering) to 1/2 cup and add 1/2 cup ground flaxseeds, add 1 cup shredded coconut with 10 minutes left to bake.  If you want to get the kids to eat it, substitute 1 cup of chocolate chips or m&m's for 1 cup of raisins (not quite as healthy, but still MUCH better for you than a candy bar and boy is it good!  Kind of a trail mix granola.)  With the shredded coconut and the chocolate chips, it tastes like a healthy magic cookie bar.  :-)

This recipe tasted wonderful!  My only complaint is that it doesn't explain very much for a novice.  This was my first time making granola, and I burned the first couple batches because I kept expecting it to harden and clump as I cooked it, instead of AS IT COOLED.  Even then, 20 minutes was too short for crunchy granola.  I found 25 minutes at a 300 was just about perfect for my taste.  I also left out the nuts, so that could have had something to do with it.  I also would have preferred a glaze or sugar dusting on the raisins.  I didn't feel they mixed well with the other textures and flavors.  Other than that, it was a great recipe, and I kept the slightly burnt granola to eat with yogurt.  It still tastes pretty good, just a little toasty. I'll definitely try again, WITH nuts next time.

This recipe is great. I did modify quantities, using 10 cups of rolled oats (to match the size of the packaging), omitted the almonds, added unsweetened coconut, and increased the pecans and walnuts by 1/2 cups each, and wheat germ and oat bran by 1/4 cup each. For the wet ingredients, I largely kept the quantities the same. Instead of using maple syrup, I used sugar free E.D Smith syrup that uses apple juice concentrate and I increased the amount to accommodate for the extra dry ingredients. Once the granola had cooled, I added 1 1/2 cups of flax meal. Adding it at the end, rather than before the cooking process, keeps the nutritional value intact (breaks down in heat). Yummy, healthy and not too sweet. Thanks for this recipe Annie!

I used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 canola oil and we love it. It's not so heavy and greasy like other granola. I also stirred in miniture chocolate chips as soon as I pulled it out of the oven and stirred them in immediately. They melt nicely into the granola and you taste it but it's not as chunky. We absolutly love it. I used only the honey and maple syrup and it's quite sweet enough. Otherwise I followed the recipe except I omitted the walnuts. This one is truly a keeper. Exactly what I was looking for.

This is my first try at homemade granola. This recipe is easy and -- from the little tastes I took along the way -- yummy.

BUT!

There is a fine line between "toasted" and burnt. My granola is burnt. Just watch out. Even an extra minute can kill the whole batch!

I make this all the time because it magically vanishes in our house!! This is addictive! The proportions work very well, and of course, substitutions are easily made. I use whatever nuts we have on hand. Craisins are delicious, as well as any other dried fruit you like. I also like to sub a cup or two of cheerios or special K for the oat bran to give another dimension to the granola. **Note** to get the granola to chunk, BOIL the sugar/oil mixture (I just put it in a large measuring cup and microwave it until it bubbles - less cleanup), then stir and bake as directed, but after it's toasty, pull it out and DON'T STIR ANY MORE. Let it cool. It should cool and form a large brick that can be broken into satisfying chunks. Then sprinkle the fruit into the container with the granola. **Also, for those trying to skimp, you can sub applesauce for oil/ fake sugar/ yada yada and it will taste alright but it will NOT be as crispy and scrumptious. If you're going to go to the trouble, make the good stuff and follow this recipe. It's healthy and oh so good. Seriously. Try this recipe!

The organic, nutty, rustic flavor is perfect. I love this recipe. It's the first time I've made granola and I was very pleased.

Here's some thoughts: 1) Buying all the ingredients is expensive, but worth it. Figured on a "per bowl" basis, the cost isn't so outrageous though, because, 2) the recipe yields a LOT.  I didn't have a bowl large enough to mix all the ingredients, so I used a large roaster, 3) I prepared it as written and though the recipe is versatile and I might experiment a bit, it's really perfect "as is," 4) I am a huge nut fan and the ratio of nuts in this recipe is very high, 5) this is probably common sense, but if you use two baking sheets, monitor the baking sheet closest to the oven heating element closely. The granola closest to the heating element will burn and stick to the foil if baked too long.

I wonder what the purpose of the oil is.  I would like to use olive oil next time or leave out the oil all together, but I'd like to know what the ramifications might be. I'd hate to spend the money for the ingredients only to learn that the recipe was ruined because an ingredient was left out.

I really, really like this granola.  I've been making Almond Maple Granola regularly for over 6 months now, and wasn't sure about trying a new recipe, since I like that one so much.  But this one is so very good, also.  I really liked the walnuts- left them in big chunks and they're so good that way.  I cut the recipe in half and used 2 TBS less honey than listed, and replaced 2 TBS of the oil with water.  I baked at 300 for at least twice the amount of time listed- maybe a little more.  Just stirred every 15-20 minutes.  I'm looking forward to having this for breakfast!

I made this recipe to the letter save for cutting it in half. It's really good. The only thing I would change next time (and it's really because of personal preference) is letting the syrup boil a few minutes longer to make for a crisper, chunkier texture. Tip: if you like a chunky granola, boil that syrup a bit longer and don't stir the granola at all during baking. Also, let it sit until completely cool on the pan before breaking into chunks. It will harden as it cools. If you like a finer granola, stir during baking and stir again right when it comes out of the oven. Thanks for the recipe. We make a lot of granola at my house, so it's nice to have a great new recipe to shake things up a bit.

Our absolute favorite! It's good with substitutions and GREAT as is. I cook this in my CROCK POT for 2 hours on low until it's light brown and that keeps me from burning it (because I'm prone to burning it in the oven). It takes me 15-20 minutes to put together because of the multitude of ingredients, I don't boil it over the stove but just add it in and stir  the crock pot every 1/2 hour or so. I make this often and we love it.

Granola was just fabulous. It was my first attempt ever at making it but so simple! I made a huge batch to serve at our office breakfast-folks ate it in the morning and snacked thru-out the day. A real crowd pleaser. Please Note: This recipe costs quite a bit of money-yes, you can vary the ingredients to taste but be aware it will add up at the check-out. I'll be making it again this week for our hungry office bunch:}

This is a great granola recipe. The modifications I made are for the health nuts who are wanting to make this a little healthier. I used ground up flax seed in place of the wheat germ and ground up Quinoa in place of the oat bran. To keep it from being too sweet(and  a healthier sugar) and cutting on the calories I only added a little less than 1 1/2 cup of just honey. In place of the vegetable oil I used Coconut oil(extremely healthy for you). I only had to use a 1/2 cup and it was plenty. It turned out amazing and a good healthy snack for the whole family.  I leave out the raisins/craisians so we can choose what we are feeling like in the morning or as a snack, dried apricots are also great!

The first time I made this granola, I made a huge batch. It was soooo good that I snacked on it nearly all day every day. Result was I ate a whole lot less at regular meals, became very regular which I hadn't been in years, and finally... I lost 30 pounds in 6 months which was an unexpected but happy side effect. I have another batch in the oven right now.

Fantastic recipe! Thanks! I have made it three times now and it is delicious and healthy. Like other reviewers I enjoy creating my own slight variation, adding flax seeds, peanuts, pumpkin seeds etc. My husband and I both love it - with yogurt, milk, or just a handful on the go to snack on.  It is somewhat time-consuming to make your own granola. However, I think it's time well spent, especially if you consider how expensive "real" granola is to buy in the supermarket/health food store.  It's important to toast the granola long enough that it will be crunchy when cooled, yet not so long it is overdone. Through trial and error, I have found it's important not to overload the baking tray. Also be careful to gently toss the mixture around a bit during the toasting so that it's done evenly. Be particularly gentle if you like lots of big crunchy clusters in the mix. (I do.) Finally, don't worry if it comes out of the oven still a bit chewy: when completely cooled it should be crunchy. Basically, you want to get it a rich golden brown the color of pancakes - not too light and not too dark.  I split the finished granola up between three glass storage jars and it keeps nice and crisp for weeks as long as you keep the lid on. Once you've opened the lid a few times, it starts to lose its crunch. I mention this just for any readers who are pondering how much to make, as this recipe as given does make a LOT of granola. My advice: go ahead and make the full batch, but divide it between a

I've been making this Megan's Granola for about a year now.  I eat it most every morning topped with vanilla yogurt and fresh blueberries and keep it in a 1.5 Gallon Rubbermaid Flex & Seal Container.  I buy dried fruit, including apricots and cranberries for $1 a box at Walgreens. I buy small bags of nuts at Aldi for a good price.  I also buy snack packs of raisins instead of a big container. I prefer to shop at a grocery (HyVee) that sells interesting bran, seeds, etc. in bulk and where I can experiment with different ingredients and buy just the amount I need. Some things I add include pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, flax seed, and pine nuts.  I delete the salt, cinnamon, and brown sugar. As another reviewer suggested, I put 2T of water in measuring cup before adding the oil.  Add the coconut with 10 min. left to bake and add flax seed after cooking to preserve the nutrients. Know that it clumps after it cools.

This granola is excellent!  My husband, who is very particular when it comes to food, even raved about it.  I made just a few changes to make it a bit healthier, and it still turned out wonderful.  Instead of using the whole amount of wheat germ, I used half wheat germ, half ground flax seed, and left out the oat bran and pecans altogether (didn't have any).  I added some shredded coconut to it about halfway through baking (for fear it would burn), but I think next time I would just add it from the start - it didn't get as toasty as I would have liked.  As for the sauce, I added a couple of heaping spoonfuls of organic peanut butter, and substituted amber agave nectar for the brown sugar (use a bit less than the amount of brown sugar that's called for, as agave nectar is sweeter).  Instead of using vegetable oil, I used half unsweetened applesauce, half extra-virgin coconut oil, and I didn't add the vanilla until right before I was ready to pour the sauce over the dry ingredients so that it wouldn't cook off.  I cooked it at 300 degrees for about 25 minutes, stirring it once halfway through cooking, and added dried cranberries, cherries, and blueberries after it had completely cooled.  Make sure you don't overbake - it won't be crunchy when you take it out of the oven because it hardens as it cools.  Let it cool completely before you break it up if you like clusters and chunks.  Overall, this recipe was very easy to make and as delicious as anything you'll buy in the store!

FOR LOW/NO FAT:  I use apple sauce or home-squeezed orange juice with pulp reduced (squeeze about 2 cups of juice and pulp, then simmer down to 1 cup), or even just water.  When using a liquid instead of oil, spread granola thinner on cookie sheets, reduce oven temp to 275 F, take out and stir every 5 minutes.  It's done when a cluster is crunchy all the way through after cooling, usually around 30-35 minutes.  Water/other liquid instead of oil gets me awesome clusters every time!

REDUCED SUGAR:  This is only way I make this granola - all of the above, plus omit brown sugar, use 1/2 cup honey, and double cinnamon (or use other spices, I like 1 tbsp cinnamon and 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice).  Seems like with less liquid it won't coat as well, but when you use water instead of oil it spreads further.

FAVE VARIATIONS:  orange juice, craisins, cinnamon and ground cloves.  Water, shredded coconut, mini chocolate chips and dried cheeries.  Apple sauce, cinnamon, half golden raisins, half dried apples.  3/4 cup apple sauce plus 1/4 cup pumpkin puree, pumpkin seeds and pumpkin pie spice (must let this one dry out a little longer for some reason).

ENJOY!

Wowee Wow Wow!  We love granola! It's so expensive these days that we have tried and failed many recipes until now.  I didn't have wheat germ or sunflower seeds so I added extra oats and walnuts in their place.  I think this recipe is pretty versatile so experiment with different ingredients or with whatever you have on hand.  My only note to self was the use of foil or parchment paper.  I tried both and prefer the parchment paper.  The granola stuck just a little to the foil and it seeded to brown just a little more than I liked.  Definetly keep an eye on this stuff the last couple of minutes and if it seems too gooey take it out anyway as it clumps up when it cools into nice chunky granola.  This is a keeper, thanks a bunch!!!

Absolutely wonderful. First time making granola. Cut the oil in 1/2 and replaced the other 1/2 with applesauce.  Used 1c maple syrup + 2Tb honey, no brown sugar (not fond of it).  I will make it again and again.

My kids and husband LOVE this recipe! We have it often as cereal. I also have altered it slightly to make into bars. After some experimentation, I figured out how to make them stick together as bars and not be too dense. I substitute half the oats with puffed rice cereal and instead of spreading onto a baking sheet, press into a 9x13 pan and cook for the same amount of time. After it cools, I cut them CAREFULLY into bars (they are still pretty crumbly at this point), turn them over so the side that was on the bottom of the pan is now up. What I did was purely an accident of circumstance, but I ran out of time so, on my way to work, I stuck them in a pre-heated 350 degree oven and then turned it off. They sat there for 8 or more hours. When I came home, I had perfect granola bars that my kids BEG me for as snacks all the time.

Yum Yum Yummy! I was sick of my old granola recipe (which was good, but it's been 2 years of the same thing!). I tried this and it's delicious! Though, because I'm health conscious, I did alter things a bit: I added 1 C. ground flaxseeds, halved the sunflowers seeds and added 1/2 cup of crushed pumpkin seeds, used only almonds for the nuts (not a big fan of pecans or walnuts), only used 2 T. of brown sugar, and instead of vegetable oil, I used coconut oil (I HIGHLY recommend using this - the health benefits are incredible and the flavor is outstanding! - even if you don't like coconut). I used 1 C. raisins and 1 C. dried cranberries. I also used all-natural ingredients. This is fabulous atop organic yogurt finished with fresh fruit :) Thank you for sharing :)

*ALSO, if you want your granola a little sweeter, a good alternative is to add in some agave nectar to the liquid mix...incredible!

I followed the recipe and cooked it at 315 deg F.  Wow - it burned black in 4 minutes.  I know my oven cooks on the hot side, but I think the temp you have must be wrong.  The small part that survived was good though.  Not my favorite recipe though.

As many have said, a wonderful recipe. Don't leave out the oil.  I don't think oil-free granola would be very tasty, since that is that helps it to "toast".  However, I use far less than the recipe calls for - my basic rule of thumb is 2 T of oil for every 2 cups of oats.  I whisk the oil into the  honey (1/4 cup per 2 cups - because I leave out the brown sugar and maple syrup, but you could use as written) then make sure the granola is coated.  You still get a nice toasty result, but with less fat.

Out of this world good! Beats any commercial brand granola out there. I wanted a chunkier granola and was so happy to see CC's review noting to boil the syrup just a bit longer and then to pat it down into the pan and bake without stiring. When it first came out of the oven I didn't think it worked but when it cooled I was able to break it apart in chunks and it was everything I wanted. I added dried cranberries and baked it in with the other ingredients and they didn't burn like raisins. I am so happy to have this recipe and just love it! Thank you!!

I have been making this granola for the past few years.  It is a great base and I have tried it with all sorts of nuts and dried fruit.  I do like cooking it on convection at 200 for about 50 min.  It takes three cookie sheets and with convection and/or a low temp you don't have to fear burning the granola.  My favorite addition is coconut and using dried blueberries for the fruit.  I usually even heat the oil and honey in a cup in the microwave.  I don't think you could screw this up...except by burning it of course!!  YUM!!  Thank you for the recipe Megan.

This is some really delicious granola. I do, however, make the following changes:
1. I double up on the sauce, I really like my granola to stick together and I found that doubling it does the trick.
2. I add a little ground ginger (about one teaspoon) into the sauce.
3. I cook at 275 degrees for 32 minutes, stirring every 8 minutes.
4. I added crystalized ginger as my dried fruit. It phenomenal especially when eaten with Greek Yogurt.

This was my first time making granola, and since Megan's Granola had such great reviews, I decided to give it a try - and was not disappointed. 
To save some money, I used sunflower, almond, and pumpkin for nuts according to other baker's notes (I was a little iffy on the pumpkin seeds, though - they were a bit of a strong taste). 
I used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and added a little extra of the maple and honey, cutting out the brown sugar and it turned out great. I also added about a cup of coconut flakes.
I made this in a few batches, baking at 325 the first few times, then trying 300 the last few (as was recommended by many). The granola turned out best at 300 in my opinion.
Definitely a recipe I will be saving and using as a base for all of my other granola experiments.

This granola has gotten such rave reviews that I now give it as a gift, also.  My husband loves it & I like that it's gotten him off of pocessed boxed cereal.  My only changes are that I use about 8 1/4 or so cups of oats & 2 cups of wheat germ, (no oat bran b/c just haven't been able to find it).  Instead of pecans I use 1 1/2 cups of both almonds & walnuts (we love these nuts & they have the most health benefits).  Omit the salt.  Use just under 3/4 cup Agave Nectar instead of brown sugar, 1/2 cup of maple syrup & 1/4 cup of raw honey.  I use more like 1 1/2 tbl. of cinnamon.  Thank you so much for this recipe!...it really does make a great gift as everyone loves it.

Excellent recipe! I made this exactly as written, except changed up the sweeteners a little bit. I used 1/2 cup of each, since I've heard it is too sweet and by switching some of the honey for maple syrup, it became less sweet and had more of a maple flavor. Other than that, I made this as written and it came out super delicious! My family loves it; everyone was picking it out of the pan while it was cooling. I stirred up one of the pans for a looser granola, but cooled the other one untouched for some chunks. This worked great! I'll definitely be making this recipe again, as it is great. Thanks so much for sharing it!

yummy.  only had almonds and pecans so used 3/4 cup of each.  husband thought needed tiny more sweetness but I disagree.  baked for 50 minutes at 250 degrees and crisped up nicely after it was out of the oven.  I might experiment with applesauce instead of oil next time but for now it's delicious!
2nd time-substitued 1/2 oil for applesauce- could even do more!  used walnuts, pecans, sunflower seeds and almonds.  sprinkled flax seed(ground) on top.  delicious.  oh and use old fashioned oats!

The problem I had was that after the recommended 20 minutes total in the oven it was still very moist....after 30 minutes still very moist.  So looked at another recipe and found it recommended 1 hour in the oven....big difference!!

I make a double batch of this every couple of months and eat it on yogurt for breakfast every morning.  I also gift it to people because I think it's so much better than anything you can get at the store!  One batch makes about 17 cups of granola.

I make just a couple changes:  I use 3 cups of any kinds of nuts I can find (almonds, cashews, walnuts, pecans, etc.), I replace half of the oil with applesauce, and I leave out the dried fruit.

Great recipe!  Every time I make it, I use different ingredients and it turns out every time.  I soak raisins and dried cherries in honey for an hour and then add them with 10 minutes left to bake.  Once I pull it out of the oven, I take a pancake turner and spray with cooking spray then press the granola into the pan.  After it sets it's nice and chunky. Thank you for the recipe!

Kind of your traditional granola recipe... honey, brown sugar, and maple syrup.. but don't fix what's not broken!  When I make granola, I heat the honey, brown sugar, etc. over the stove and add the vanilla last, after its off the heat, that way it doesn't cook out the alcohol and the flavor is still there. Also once i pour the granola onto the baking sheets, i sprinkle more brown sugar on top so that it gives it more of a crisp crunch after it is done baking and had time to cool... its good that way. I always add extra bran, no one can tell, use as little oil as I can get away with to keep it healthy, and just throw in whatever is laying around the kitchen for the mixins.. no batch is ever the same. VERY GOOD.

I love the syrup/honey mix!  I don't use the wheat germ and oat bran and don't always have all the nuts.  But I like to add coconut and extra craisins and raisins.  I carry a baggie of it in my bag for school - very easy be healthy on the go!  Thanks a lot!

Great recipe,  my family loved it exactly as written!  
The second time I made it, I turned it into CHOCOLATE GRANOLA.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, but I also added (4) 1 oz semi-sweet baking chocolate squares and 1/4 cup baking cocoa to the liquid mixture that you bring to a boil in the sauce pan. (It stirred into the granola with no problems.) At the end, when the granola was all done baking and COMPLETELY COOLED, I added 1 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. YUM!!!

This is great granola. I replaced the vegetable oil with coconut oil. The result is very rustic tasting. I don't think it was too sweet at all. I made 1/2 the amount called for to try it out first. I am glad I did because I burned it. I put the two cookie sheets side by side on the same rack and the sides were touching the oven... Big no no. It was burned in 7 minutes. I redid it without it touching the oven and it turned out great.

A WONDERFUL recipe! I didn't have Oat Bran, so I don't know what that would have added to it.  I used twice the amount of fruit called for (and could still add more based on preference) and added the fruit (plus coconut) when I stirred the mixture at the mid-cook point. The sweetness is fine for us as is. THANK YOU for sharing such a wonderful recipe! Also - if your measure the oil first (I used grapeseed oil) then your honey and maple suger won't stick to the measuring cup.

Best granola ever!  I've made this dozens of times, and have used slight variations each time.  I like to use almonds only, no other nuts, I always use 1/2 C coconut oil and 1/2 C vegetable oil, and no brown sugar, it's just sweet enough with the maple syrup.  Great recipe!

I make several versions of granola and this one was a keeper. The overall flavor is good but I should have trusted my instincts and not added the full amount of salt. A pinch of kosher salt is more than enough to bring out the flavors the full amount of salt makes it too salty. I lowered the oven temperature like others recommended to prevent scorching. 

Substitutions/alterations- I used equal parts honey and maple syrup. Substituted unrefined coconut oil for the vegetable oil. Flax seed substituted for the sunflower seeds. 1 cup unsweetened coconut for one of the cups of raisins. I added the coconut only in the last 20 minutes of baking to avoid burning. 

Next time- pinch of salt only, substitute apple juice for the brown sugar. I thought it was just a little too sweet and the apple juice will lower it just enough to make this perfect. Overall it's a good basic recipe then modify for your own tastes.

I've been making granola for several years, but this is the best recipe I've found yet. The only correction/suggestion I would make is to stir the dried fruits into the granola hot out of the oven. That way, little bits of the granola stick to the fruit as it all cools down. It's a nice touch.

Super Easy to make once you locate all your ingredients.  Check your local farm markets or health food stores for the oat bran and wheat germ.  I found that 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon was perfect for this recipe after I miss read the amount on the 1st batch.  I added mini choc chips to my 2nd batch once completely cool.  What a nice bitter sweet treat.  If you don't have 2 lg baking sheets 2- 9x13 pans or an 11x17 pan work great as well I just baked for about 25 minutes vs. 20 that the recipe called for.  I gave away as Christmas gifts in quart mason jars, also great with ice cream, yogert or just to eat as a snack!

I love this kind of granola - everything chopped small and it is crunchy. I wish I had known that it gets crunchier as it cools - I wouldn't have baked it for so long. I also would have added the dried fruit right after the granola came out of the oven so that the fruit stuck to the granola. I used dried cherries and they taste great.

This is a really tasty recipe for granola. That being said, I do make a few changes now and then...I use ground flaxseed in place of the wheat germ, leave out the sunflower seeds and make up the bulk with extra walnuts, and add about a cup of dried pineapple and a cup of coconut (in addition to the raisins), with about 10 minutes left to bake. The extra fruit makes it sweeter without adding more processed sugars.

I also use a large roasting pan, and stir it every 10-15 minutes. It takes close to an hour this way, but gives you a lot more control over the level of toasty-ness.

This is very easy to make. I made the recipe exactly. I halved the recipe and used two cookie sheets to spread it out on. I added a ton of raisins and have stored it in a large glass jar. Stays crunchy.

This is an excellent recipe. Following a few other reviewers I changed the oil to coconut and added blueberries. Its extremely simple to make and tastes incredible. I didnt have flaxseed so I used chia seeds instead. I baked mine at 200 degrees for 45 minutes and it was still kind of soft. I left it overnight to see if it would get crunchy, it didnt. In the morning, with the trays already in the oven, I turned it on for 15 minutes at 300 degrees. Again I let it completely cool and it is very crunchy with brown crispy goodness all around it. Amazing!

This granola is so good. A tip to avoid burning (because the sugar burns quickly) is to raise the oven rack so it isn't as close to the heating element, and stir along the sides and bottom of the pan. I've made at least a dozen batches, and burned a few, but everyone loves this homemade granola!

Delicious granola!  I think this is my new favorite granola recipe.  I baked the granola 25 mins. at 300 degrees, stirring a couple of times during baking.  I used half coconut oil for the oil.  I think next time I will try all coconut oil.   8/5/11-I tried all coconut oil and it tastes even better!

I really loved this recipe. I'm under a gluten-free diet so I used corn flakes and homemade crisp rice instead of the oatmeal etc... otherwise the recipe was a hit in my home, and I'm the only one who suffers from celiac disease... they're stoling my food LOL

I love this recipe as is, but of course I had to tweak it a bit to suit my family's personal taste.  First off, I added 2 heaping tablespoons of crunchy peanut butter to the sauce pan of melted/heated ingredients.  We love peanut butter.  I also   added the vanilla last, after letting the mixture cool to just below boiling, as the vanilla is apt to "boil off" due to the high alcohol content. I also omitted the maple syrup and added 1 tablespoon of molasses, which gives it a nice hearty taste.  Try adding any number and combination of nuts and seeds.  I usually have at least 5 or 6 different kinds in each batch.  It's a huge hit with everyone in my husband's office.  I like to eat it "raw" before baking.  It tastes great and is healthier as the good fats in the nuts/seeds haven't been altered by the high heat in the oven.

Easy and delicious!  So easy to tweak and make your own.  This is my 2nd batch of this granola and I used dried apricots and shredded coconut for the fruit.  I also use coconut oil and grapeseed oil for the fat.  And I used another user's suggestion to cook at 300 for 25 min.  Works like a charm.  I also add ground flaxseed once it's cooled. Very healthy and delicious.  I will be giving some away as Christmas gifts.  Thanks for the recipe! :)
8/18/12-Made it again!  Delicious.  For the fat, I used all coconut oil. Next time, I will try not stirring it, as suggested by some. Because the best tasting granola are the very toasty pieces from the edge of the pan!

I make a variation of this recipe 1-2 times/month and we eat it every morning for breakfast! I found it wasn't quite clumping enough, so I have decreased it to 6 cups of oats, everything else the same. Delicious! I vary the nut and dried fruit combination depending on my mood and the season (dried blueberries and almonds in the summer, dried ginger and cashews for fall, etc.) I have shared it with so many people and everyone is amazed at the flavor!

This is a wonderful recipe, although I made a couple of changes to make it healthier. I used applesauce instead of oil and flaxseed instead of oat bran. My husband begs me to make this and he usually hates eating healthy. My favorite way to eat it is with vanilla yogurt and fruit, yum!

Excellent Granola!

Here's a little tip if you're the type of person who doesn't like dirtying up a 3/4 cup measuring cup for one ingredient and instead eye-balls 3/4 of your much used and dirty 1 cup measuring cup.
Switch the order of your vegetable oil and honey.
Put your cup of vegetable oil in the sauce pan first, then eye-ball your 3/4 cup of honey and add it.
The honey slides right into your sauce pan with no sticking and no spatula needed.

Other than that, great recipe.
As another reviewer pointed out, don't make this thinking it's a "budget" granola.
It cost me 12 bucks and I already had about half the ingredients.
Make this as a special treat or a holiday gift!

Delicious!  My husband and I both love this.  It is rare that we both enjoy something so much.  I substituted the oil for apple sauce (plus added 2 tablespoons of oil), it tasted like apple cinnamon and the house smelled of apple crisp.  Delicious in any form!

None of the store bought granola's are quite right (not to mention the expense), so I finally resorted to making it.  This is the best!  Not too sweet, and I took another reviewer's suggestion of not stirring so that it would be chunky.  Yum, yum!

I just made this..... DELICIOUS!!!  This is my second attempt at granola.  This recipe turned out much better than the first one I tried.  I didn't do the wheat germ, oat bran, pecans or walnuts (personal pref), but I added flax seed and WHOLE almonds.  Fantastic.  This has a very similar taste to our favorite store bought granola.  At a fraction of the cost and waste.  Thanks Megan!!!

Delicious! I have found my granola recipe! I used a cup and a half pecans and a cup and a half almonds because I'm not a big walnut fan. Also I crushed some of the almond slices by hand but not all, the big toasted pieces are yummy too! I did not use Maple syrup either. And only 3/4 cup of oil. I probably won't do this the same way all the time, nice flexible recipe.

I made this for the first time and it was awesome.  I would recommend to anyone.  The only thing I will add....do not wait for the to get crispy in the oven.  It has to cool before it gets crispy, I baked mine for 35 minuts stirring continuely to keep from burning and then I realized it wasnt going to get hard until it cooled.  I will make this again!!

Megan's Granola is eaten everyday at our house.  It's cheaper and tastier than Quaker Natural Granola, and it's also healthier! I also use Coconut oil instead, and add whatever else we have on hand.  Also, I use proportionately more brown sugar and omit either the honey or maple syrup depending on my mood.

Made a few substitutions, of course (who doesn't??) and used 1/2 cup of pine nuts instead of sunflower seeds, also left the brown sugar out and used 1 cup maple syrup + 1 tbsp honey instead.  Added some chocolate chips with dried cranberries and raisins after cooling.  Amazing!  The hubby told me to get on here and give it 5 stars! LOL

Made this recipe today with some modifications -- possibly the best granola I've ever had.  Added 1 Tbls. (instead of tsp.) cinnamon and vanilla.  Omitted the sunflower seeds altogether.  Added only the walnuts and the pecans, and instead of almonds added 1/2 C golden flax seeds. Substituted wheat bran for the oat bran. Changed the sugars to: 1/2 C brown sugar, 1/2 C maple syrup and 1/4 C honey.  Perfect sweetness with the nuts and flax.  Baked at 225 for about an hour, stirring every 15 minutes or so. Delicious!!!  The recipe made a batch that filled a gallon-size freezer zipper bag.

I've tried a lot of Granola recipes because we own a B&B. This is hands down the best recipe out there. It's addictive.

This is a fantastic granola recipe! I did tweak it a bit. I add whatever nuts I have handy and I increase the Cinnamon by double and add a pinch of cloves. A trick I learned in my house. I like it crumbly so I eat it as cereal and my hubby likes it chunky so he can snack on it. As it is cooling keep breaking it up if you want it crumbly  if you want it chunky let it cool in the pan for a good hour or two and then break it off in chunks! Everyone is getting granola this year instead of cookies for the holidays!

I half the recipe because my household consists of my husband and me and the granola gets soft after two weeks in an air-tight container even. I make the changes as follows because we don't eat a lot of wheat:
Instead of the oat bran and wheat germ I replace it with milled flaxseeds (1 c for 15 servings)
Instead of the vegetable oil I replace it with coconut oil 
Also, I have cheap cookie sheets which I've noticed the granola gets crunchier on (I have a nice one that I've used too) and mine does get over done at 20 min. so I bake mine for 17!  Love the recipe! Thanks for sharing!

A very good granola recipe; I made a half-recipe.  I omitted the maple syrup, as I didn't have any, and added an equal amount of water with a tablespoon of maple extract.  I omitted the salt for personal preference, and added applesauce to replace the oil in order to cut calories.  The mixture seemed dry, so I doubled the applesauce and added two T water, which allowed me to moisten all the oat/bran/germ mixture evenly. Next time I'll use two 9x13 cookie sheets (with rims) instead of just one.  The mixture baked evenly, but was still fairly moist at the end of twenty minutes.  It is a very humid day, which may have contributed, but I wanted a drier mix so I turned the oven off and continued to bake the mixture for another 20 minutes-stirring every 10 minutes-in the cooling oven until I got the results I wanted.  I mixed a pineapple/banana/coconut trail mix in half of the mixture to eat as a snack, and left half plain to use over yogurt and cottage cheese, etc.  I'm sure I'll be making this again, although I'll stick to a half-batch to make it easily manageable.  Thanks for the recipe, Megan and annie9!

This is delicious...  I made it as written.  To make it easier i added the nuts & craisins in the food processor.  It took 40 minutes in my oven at 325.  Will probably do 350 or 375 next time to speed things up.  Great healthy recipe and it makes a lot.  Definitely a keeper!

This is my go-to granola recipe! I make this several times a year & it’s coveted by my family & friends. I triple the recipe which makes a huge batch!I substitute pumpkin seeds for sunflower seeds and add dried cranberries & cherries. I also add toasted flaked coconut once my granola is baked & all other ingredients are mixed in.

Yum! I didn't feel like spending a fortune on all the brans etc, so I found a bad of "porridge oats" that had bran, wheat germ and rolled oats already together. I used that in place of the oats and brans etc. I halved the recipe and needed to add about five minutes to the time in the oven. Don't mess with it when it comes out of the oven. just let it cool on a rack so it can clump up as it cools. I didn't add the raisins 'cause those can be easily added to each bowl but not so easily picked out :)

I prefer less sweet granola, so I only put in 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/3 c maple syrup, and 1/3 c honey.  After the first 10 minutes of baking, per other reviewers' advice, I stirred in 3/4 cup of coconut into each pan.  After it was finished baking and completely cooled, I poured it all back into the original large bowl and stirred in 1 cup raisins, 1 cup dates, and 1 1/2 cups of flax meal.  Per a friend's advice, I used a coffee grinder to grind flax seeds into meal - it is necessary to break open the seeds in order to benefit from their nutrition and I have found it hard to find flax meal... either at all or at a good price.  This solution worked beautifully :)   

Thanks Megan and Annie for a super yummy recipe!! :)

Absolutely delicious!  I've been eating this (as prepared by my mother) for years.  Finally began making my own batches...and gifted several for Christmas this year.  For added health benefits, I included the addition of milled flax seed (1 cup each of flax, wheat germ & oat bran).  Scrumptious!

This is not something I eat, but I make it for my husband.  He loves it.  You really can't mess it up.  I add 1 c. of all kinds of nuts, flax seed, etc.  I don't add the dried fruit since he doesn't want any.  It does smell wonderful while it is cooking though.  He is always asking me to make more.

I've made this several times now, omitting the wheat germ and subbing in ground flax seeds, and also swapping the oil for coconut oil for a slightly different taste, and it's come out beautifully every time. I will never be without this recipe for a foolproof, crunch, delicious granola that takes any additions or substitutions like a champ!

I think this is one of those recipes as stated in other reviews that is pretty forgiving.  I added pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds instead of the walnuts and sunflower seeds.  I added almond flavouring but really couldn't taste it so I would leave it out next time.  I think that the time that it says to bake is also a bit off.  I baked it for 40 min stiring twice during baking.  Would make again.

Made this for the first time and love it.  Added more nuts - cashews, almonds, pistachios, pecans, and walnuts. Should have added the pistachios after baking as they browned a bit more than I'd like.  Added M&Ms to one batch and dried fruit to the other batch. Not sure which is better as both are yummy!

Absolutely and in every way fantastic. We halfed the recipe and then stirred in 1/2 c. shredded coconut into one side of the pan and added chocolate chips when it was cool. The other side, I added extra cinnamon and added craisins when it was done. We'll be making this often--thanks!

I made two batches - 1 with only maple syrup and honey, and the other with maple syrup, brown sugar, and honey.

If you can, don't skimp out on the brown sugar. I slightly cut down the amount of brown sugar, but don't leave it out! It adds a much richer, more fragrant taste to the granola that you can't get from the maple syrup alone.

Overall very good, not too sweet.  My changes where as follows: 1) Mixed the nuts 2) Didn't have any apple butter so used 1/2c apple sauce and one small ripe banana 3) I found it much easier to shred the apple and carrots 4) I didn't want it to sweet to didn't use the maple syrup 5) Didn't have oat bran so didn't use.  It took me a about 45 minutes to prepare, which I thought was a bit long, but my family and I have been enjoying it for over a week so it's worth it.  Will make again.

I really enjoyed the granola and actually I took a few suggestions from the other reviewers. I, like many reduced the heat to about 250 after the first 20 mins and stirred it about every 15 for another half hour. It dried out and crispped up nicely. I also couldn't find any oat bran so I just used a bit more oats and wheat germ. I also substituted the sunflower seads and walnuts for cashews. Good Stuff

Awesome recipe!  Not overly sweet like some granola recipes can be.  I did make some adjustments.  I cut the recipe in half, we didn't need that much granola.  Also, I substituted pepitas for walnuts (we are not fans of walnuts.)  And I added a couple spoonfuls of ground flaxseed.  Thanks for the recipe!

A wonderful recipe!  A few things that we found (as beginning granola makers):  The sweetness was quite resonable for a granola.  Next time I may cut it down slightly.  The only other thing was that our granola didn't 'clump' as I expected, however, we removed it immediately from the pan and other reviewers suggested letting it sit, and that may have been our problem.  Having only one baking sheet, it took four rounds to be able to toast all of it.  Yummy on ice cream, yogurt and mixed in with other cereals, or eaten all on its own!

Really wonderful granola.  I didn't have any sunflower seeds or pecans.  The cinnamon and maple syrup added a nice touch of flavor.

Yummy!  It is so adaptable to whatever you have in the pantry.  Quick cook oats make a great substitution for the  oat bran.  Coconut is a delicious addition, too.

Excellent flavor.  However, I needed to turn the oven temp lower and cook it longer in order to get it to crisp up without browning too much.  I like my granola chunky and the second time I made this, I added 2 T. water to the syrup mixture...it clumped up nicely.  I will be making this now instead of buying granola at the store.

I have been making a similar "Super Granola" for over a year and eat it every day. For sweetness, I omit the brown sugar and syrup and use 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup molasses. Oats, 3 cups mixed nuts and 3 cups mixed dried fruit are essential and anything else is up to what's on hand, your tastes and budget. No parchment paper or foil is needed.  I use 3 T. of cinnamon (so healthy) and 2 T of vanilla and 3/4 cup of canola oil. Also add 21/2 cups of water or apple juice to the liquid mixture. To get a less crumbly granola, add 1 cup of whole wheat flour to the mixture before pouring in the liquid mix and it will clump up a lot.  Bake at 275 for 60 to 80 minutes, stirring every 20 minutes and chopping up clumps into smaller pieces with a spatula. The lower temperature helps avoid burning.

Pretty good! As others suggested, I cut the oil in 1/2 and used 1/2c applesauce to decrease the oil as well as omit the brown sugar.  Ran out of honey so I just used maple syrup in it's place.  This actually took more like 30-40 min to cook. Very filling and just the right sweetness.  Oh, I did increase the vanilla and cinnamon to 1 TBSP as I saw the review stating the recipe was posted incorrectly.  Not too sweet, and makes A WHOLE LOT!

This granola is the best. My college age sons love it they demand vats of it. I do use unsweetened applesauce in place of most of the oil.

I agree that you need to bake for only 20 min!  I thought it needed longer and seems like I could have done just the 20 min.  I didn't think it was done enough, but would have been fine.  I did just 1/2 of the recipe and it made a TON!  Will definately make this again.  Not too sweet and a nice crunch.

Oh, my!  Made this tonight, and hubby and I can't stop munching.  I followed the recipe  pretty close this first time, except I didn't have enough craisins.  I would add more dried fruit the next time.  I cooked for 40 minutes at 300 degrees, and did not stir at all - perfect!  Let the cookie sheets cool completely, and have nice big chunks that are perfect for snacking.  This is definitely a keeper.

I have made this recipe, or versions of it, for over a year now. Like many other viewers have mentioned, you can really adpt the recipe to use whatever, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, etc., that you may have on hand. I always divide the mix into 2 cookie pans, and watch carefully while baking to avoid burning!

I have gotten more compliments on my granola!  Everyone asks for the recipe.  Tweaked it quite a bit, based on others reviews & here's what I've come up with.  First of all half the recipe or you will end up with a TON!  If you do, it freezes beautifully.  Just don't add the fruit until after you thaw it & are ready to use it.  I add sesame seed instead of sunflower, 1/2 cup ground flaxseed & 1 cup of unsweetened shredded coconut.  I use 1/4 cup Br. Sugar & 1/3 cup each of honey & maple syrup.  I use almost the full amount of cinnamon & replace Coconut oil for the vegetable.  I boil all this and then add the vanilla.  I bake at 300 for 12 mins then stir.  I bake another 13 mins then take it out & leave it to cool completely.  Then I break it up in a bowl with lots of different fruits - craisins, dried cherries, pineapple, raisins, apricots, apples - anything I have on hand!  It is awesome every time - if I could I'd rate it 10 stars!   thanks so much for sharing!!

This was a major, major hit with my family! I'm 11 years old and I was able to make this, it was that easy!! SOOOOO DELICIOUS!! I did the exact measurements, directions and degrees and it turned out perfectly. We put this over our oatmeal. We also pair this with milk to make a scrumptious, healthy, morning cereal!! Try this!!

Unless you like granola burnt to a crisp turn your temp down to about 275 and bake for 5-7 mins, stir and then another 3-5 mins.

First time making granola.  The recipe is very easy.  After reading reviews, I did not use the maple syrup to cut down on the sweetness.  I added dried unsweetened cranberries and unsweetened cherries.  The result was fantastic.  Not overly sweet and the tartness of the dried fruit brought a nice contrast.  This is a "nutty" recipe, and I think the only nuts you can taste are the almonds and the walnuts.  In the future, I'll leave out the sunflower seeds altogether.  I may try walnuts OR pecans but not both.  But again, let me be clear, this is an easy, quick, albeit expensive recipe, but well worth it.  Definitely will make again.

Great recipe. I did what many did and modified it to fit me. Didn't use the oat bran - just added extra oatmeal. I think I ended up using 7 cups of old fashioned oats and 2 1/2 cups of quick cook oats. The only nuts I added was slivered almonds. Instead of all the oil I did 1/4 c oil 2/3cup unsweetened apple sauce and a little water. Baked it at 270 for a while. I baked mine for quite a while - not sure if it was because I substituted the oil but it comes out quite crunchy and flavorful without all the oil.  Just remember to set your timer and stir occasionally- the first batch I got a little too toasty and it totally dried out the rasins and turned them into little crunchy bites of nastiness.

This is fantastic! Ive made this several times. I have found that cooking them in several batches works best. If you overcrowd the pan then they dont turn out as crispy. I also only use 6 cups of granola so there is more coating. Ive used cranberries, mixed nuts, added coconut, dark chocolate chips, all sorts of variations are possible. I do always use almond extract, that gives it fantastic flavor. It lasts a very long time in a tight lidded tupperwear in the fridge without getting soft. My husband and i love it! Its a new staple!

I've made this cereal so many times and I love it! Cook it at 300 degrees for only 20-25 minutes. It does come out gooey but will firm up. I once cooked it for half an hour and it was burned and not very tasty. I like my granola crunchy for cereal so I freeze it. I only make half as this recipe does make a ton. But again, it freezes really well too.

I also have to give this recipe 5 stars.  I made a few changes in the recipe.  I used 1 1/2 cups each of slivered almonds and pecan pieces and left out the walnuts.  I baked it at 300 degrees for 20 minutes and removed it from the cookie sheets immediately at the end of baking.  If you leave it on the cookie sheets to cool, it will continue to bake and could burn.

This is sooo good!  This is my first time making granola and I couldn't have picked a better recipe.  I'll be using this one again and again.  I made a half batch and have been snacking all day. Next time I'll definitely make the full batch.  The only thing I did differently was use coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil, and I also added shredded coconut halfway through the baking. I put in the raisins and dried cranberries when I pulled it out of the oven and used my spatula to flatten in down in the pan, and when cooled it stuck together in clumps here and there which was perfect. I only added the almonds and the pecans but it was perfect.  This is a great base recipe that you can easily adjust to throw in whatever nuts and dried fruits you have on hand. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was my first time making granola and it turned out well.  I followed other reviewers advice and didn't add the brown sugar.  It is plenty sweet that way.  I left out the pecans and stirred in ground flax seed with the cranberries.  Some of the pieces did burn a bit in the oven, even with frequent stirring, so I would lower the temp and cook for longer.  Great recipe!

This granola is fantastic!  It is on the sweet side so some may want to cut back a little on some of the sweet ingredients.  I am making it this year instead of CHrstmas cookies as a healthier alternative.

Yum! My first attempt at making granola was a success.  I tweeked some (did not have oat germ or wheat germ, and I mixed several kinds of dried fruits).  I also used e.v. coconut oil.  The only issue is that I wanted some "pieces" and you actually would have to eat this with a spoon or sprinkle it on yogurt or ice cream (which is NOT a bad thing!)  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!  I'm inspired to try more variations!

This was SO GOOD!!! I didn't have sunflower seeds or wheat germ, but I will the next time I make it. Cannot wait to try it as a 'parfait' with my vanilla yogurt.  I was recently diagnosed with diabetes & the food I miss most are things that crunch - thanks for sharing this yummy treat:)

Great base recipe!  I like how I can add anything I want and it'll still taste good every time!  The only issue I have with this recipe:  It makes a huge batch and it WILL go stale after about 2 weeks.

I made this with a bowl of trail mix I had in the refrigerator for months.  It had everything from seeds to chocolate and everything in between.  I added the other ingredients all together and baked as instructed.  I am eating it as a cereal with milk now.  It sure beats store bought granola cereals.  YUM!

YUM!  This was my first time making granola and I have to admit, I was a little intimidated.  Wow, this is amazing!  I don't care much for walnuts, so I left those out and added 1 cup of coconut instead. I did about 1 cup each of raisins and dried cranberries. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil - next time I will try the applesauce method that has been suggested.  I just realized I also forgot to put the vanilla in.  Oh well! This turned out great and is definitely a keeper!

This was so easy to make and SO delicious ... I now have orders to make more for friends and neighbors.  I plan to make packages of this treasure for Christmas gifts.  The only things I did different here was add a cup of whole ground flaxseed meal and a cup of oat bran, and it needed an extra 15 minutes in the oven for even toasting.  I'm making a batch right now and plan to stir in a 1/2 cup of nutty natural peanut butter.  Thank you for an awesome recipe!  It's definitely a 'make, eat and repeat' recipe.

Fantastic recipe.  As has been said, the granola crisps up as it cools.  I originally cooked for closer to 30 mins because I didn't want any residual moisture, but I think I'll bake for more like 20 mins as directed next time.  Mine didn't clump as much as normal granola, but it's delicious nonetheless.

I added dried pineapple, mango, and papaya which I chopped up and cooked with the granola. Then my husband threw 5 handfuls of choc chips as I stirred after it came out of the oven. My 5 kids loved it!

Delish! I only made about a third of tthe recipe, that's all I really needed, and I figured I'd try it before I commited to the ingredients for a full recipe. I didn't have any walnuts or sunflower seeds on hand, I just upped the other nuts a bit. And I was making it to be a yogurt topping, so I didn't add the dried fruit at the end. It's a FANTASTIC yogurt topping! My kids LOVE it! (We made parfaits!) I was concerned about burning it, so I decreased the temp, I baked it at 300 for about 25 minutes, maybe 27. It does firm up as it cools, and mine turned out great! I'll be making this to have on hand all the time! I think some M&M's and raisins after it's cooled will make a great trail mix! I'll also have to try some other suggestions and turn them into granola bars, my son loves them!

This recipe is awesome! I didn't have wheat germ so I used flax meal. I didn't have oat bran so I use sesame seeds because that's what I had. i used shredded coconut instead of the pecans, because that's what I had. I used dried cranberries and dried cherries. My husband poured a bowl and added some of our fresh goat milk, then sighed with delight!

Awesome! I use 1/2 cup maple syrup and 1/2 cup honey (brown sugar only when I'm out of one of these). I've thrown in coconut and flax seeds as well.

This a great recipe for anyone looking to make granola (it's way cheaper than the store bought stuff and tastes better too!). I found myself eating it off the spoon before, during, and after it was cooked! After reading the reviews I did omit the brown sugar and just added a little extra honey and maple syrup, it came out great and sweet enough for me! I only had almonds so I just used them all (about 2 1/4 cups). Like another reviewer mentioned, this is great because you can just add what you have in your kitchen and don't need to worry too much about missing/additional ingredients, just add what you like. Very tasty, thanks for the recipe! I'll be using this one a lot!

Great granola. I wasn't sure 10 minutes of baking was enough time, but it is enough time. I added half golden raisins and half dried cherries, which taste great as the raisins are more sweet and the cherries are more tart. Next time I am going to add coconut.

I'm terribly pleased with your recipe and thank you so much.  Made a half batch, didn't have oat bran and added coconut, and cranberries along with raisins.  Used nuts I had available and also sub'd half applesauce for half the oil.  I baked for 20" and then left it in warm oven for 10 more minutes.  I think I had my pan overloaded (only used 1 for a half recipe) as it's still a little soft ... but that could be from the applesauce.  I used honey, brown subar, and maple syrup and didn't find it overly sweet at all - just right.  All in all, very nice!

SO delicious!!! I had so much fun making it, too! 
I followed the advice of other reviewers and left out the brown sugar. However, I did sprinkle a little bit over the top right when I took it out of the oven. I also sprinkled a handful of Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips, and then stirred. The result is an incredible, subtle chocolatey goodness!

I put in almonds, hazelnuts, pecans, and currants instead of raisins.

Fantastic!!!  This is the first granola I've ever made and I will probably be making it for many years to come.  My husband begs me to make more so he can have it for breakfast everyday.  I cut the sunflower seeds down by half (cause I ran out) and liked it better that way.  I also added peanuts.  The first time I made it, i couldn't find oat bran so I upped the wheat germ and oatmeal to compensate and didn't notice a difference.  I will try another reviewers advice and use applesauce for half the oil next time.  LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!!!

This was my first attempt to make granola. There are so many recipes out there I was nervous I'd choose one that wasn't good. This did not disappoint. Best granola I've ever eaten! I didn't have molasses so I just put a little more brown sugar and honey in it and it turned out great w/o it. I'm going to try one of the reviewer's suggestion to use part oil/part applesauce and see if it tastes as good w/half the oil. 
Earns every one of the five stars, I'd give it six if I could.

Absolutely perfect.  the entire family loves this granola.  I used to buy a commercial variety at Target.  it was way too expensive.  Thanks to cheap germ and bran at safe-way its very cost effective. I've ben dieting and this stuff is now a staple.

NOM NOM NOM.  This is a fantastic recipe, been making it for a couple of years.  My husband and I are big fans!  Delicious AND easy to make.  We just have to watch our intake, because we can go through a batch FAST if we're not paying attention.

I loved this.  It was really easy to make.  I admit that I left out the sunflower seeds, and accidentally put all the fluid ingredients together in the bowl.  But then I just mixed it like crazy and spread it on the baking sheet.  I baked and stirred it, and it came out really great.  I woll make this again for sure...it is so much cheaper than buying granola in the store.

Very good. I  made a half batch & omitted the sugar & maple syrup and used 1/3 c. honey. I used coconut oil. Very tasty, although it did not make many granola clusters. Perfect time and temperature for roasting.

Wow, making your own granola is a heck of a lot easier then I thought! Buying all the ingredients is a little expensive at first, but once you have stuff like oat bran and wheat germ I think it's actually cheaper. This makes A LOT. Prob about 3 maybe even 4 boxes worth of granola. I followed the recipe for most of it, but omitted sunflower seeds and added flax and subbed coconut oil for regular. If you've eaten regular supermarket granola your whole life, this really isn't that sweet (despite what others are saying). I didn't measure the cinnamon and I wish I had, the flavor is just a touch bland but I don't think I put enough of that or salt in it so it's probably my fault. In one batch I threw in some shredded coconut in the last 10 min. next time i'll try a little sooner, it wasn't quite toasted. Not a bad recipe! Healthier, easy to make, and very flexible to suit your own tastes!

This recipe is so fantastic and quite versatile!  I changed it up just a little... didn't add walnuts because I was out, added ground flax for more nutrients, used pumpkin and sunflower seeds, used agave (3/4c) instead of maple syrup and honey, and added about 1/2T more of cinnamon.  
I think the recipe could have been made exactly as written and would have been excellent still.  I only tweaked based on what I had in the house and on personal preference.  
Thinking I will try to add peanut butter next time, cut out the cinnamon, and add chocolate chips.  There are so many ways to make this!  Be creative!!

Baked at 275 for 30 minutes, but it is very important that it is not too thick of a layer on the pans.

This is absolutely wonderful!  I don't think my husband will ever let me buy a box of cereal again! 

As many others, I used the recipe as a reference, but substituted different ingredients according to my tastes (I used craisins, almonds, pumpkin seeds and coconut in one batch and almonds, pumpkin seeds, coconut and chocolate in the other).  I'll continue to make this with different variations so as to always have something new.  

I followed the cooking instructions in the "Great Granola" article on this site to cook it on 300 for 30 minutes, then add the craisins, coconut, pumpkin seeds, and ground flax seed (1/2 cup), and cook it for 15 more minutes.  It came out perfect!  Thanks for the tip about it hardening as it cools and not as it cooks. . . I would have been worrying that it wasn't done yet because it was still soft in the oven.  It's done when it's golden brown.  

My 4-year-old usually won't eat cereal, but she gobbled a bowl of this up in minutes.  Adding some chocolate chips right after it comes out of the oven and mixing it in makes it taste like cookies,  which is a great way to get a whole lot of healthy ingredients down a picky eater.  

Be sure to add some ground flax seed since it adds a whole lot of nutritional value and a bit more flavor.  I also followed the suggestion to use coconut oil (I used 1/2 cup of coconut oil and 1/2 cup of olive oil), and I think that it gave it a nice touch, plus the fact that it's a lot healthier than vegetable oil.

I must say first that I am not a cook at all. I'm really trying though.  With that said, I was so excited when this recipe turned out good for me!  Not only is the granola very good, but as it bakes, it makes the house smell yummy.  Don't think I'll buy granola anymore.  Very good, thank you for this recipe.

This was good, I have made it with 1/2 the oil (I really don't see the point of the oil) and it turned out the same. To me the proportion of oats and everything else is a little off. I like a little more oats and less nuts in my granola, it just feels like you have to chew forever.

Pretty good granola.  I made exactly as directed and found that amount of cinnamon to be pretty over-powering.  It wasn't completely crunchy, like I had hoped it would remain, the next day, which was disappointing.  It is easily scaled down for smaller batches.  Overall, I will make it again, just using 1/4 of the cinnamon.

Awesome granola.  I make a lot of the changes suggested by previous reviewers, and I also add 1 cup of crystallized ginger that I make myself (instead of slices, I cut the ginger into tiny cubes, but whatever floats your boat).  It adds zing, and is an amazing addition.

I didn't have any wheat germ or dried fruits, but I couldn't tell the difference. It was still DELICIOUS. I love the idea of having a cereal I can feed my family that has zero corn syrup, zero preservatives, and a minimal amount of refined sugar (the brown sugar). I might try to replace that with an unrefined sugar and see how it turns out.

Absolutely fantastic!  I don't usually care for granola, but my entire family loves this and cannot stay out of it - even just dry as a snack.  My toddlers even love it.  I used pumpkin seeds and flax seeds in place of the sunflower seeds.

A great recipe. I didn't do any wheat germ or anything, just the oats and then I added in pecans, walnuts and then did a mix of dried fruit and pumpkin and sunflower seeds at the end. I did mine about 325 for 30 min.

This granola was perfect. The sweetness was right, the flavour was excellent and it was nicely crunchy.   I added a cup of unsweetened, shredded coconut as well and it was terrific.  I just realized that I forgot to add the oil and it turned out great without it.

YUM YUM! Half the recipe. Used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. No maple syrup so just added extra honey (organic honey is so yummy). Used dried raisins and cranberries. Cooked it for 20 minutes at 325 degrees, flipping it at half way. Then cook it for 5 more mins at 300 degrees. I added the berries right after taking the granola out and then press it down on the cooking sheet so as it hardens, it will create clumps. I let it sit out for at least an hour and I promise it will harden up nicely. I can't stop eating it. Thanks for the fantastic recipe.

This was easy to make - and is quite tasty - I left out the brown sugar, but will add it next time.  I may leave out the almonds next time as I don't like that many nuts in the granola - but we are eating it every day.  I sprinkle mine in with yogurt for breakfast on the run.

The best granola ever!  I've followed the recipe exactly & it's wonderful!  Now I usually make the following changes:  I omit the sunflower seeds, use 2 1/2 cups of craisins, wheat bran instead of wheat germ, extra virgin coconut oil instead of veg. oil & only 1/2 c honey.  I originally thought it would have too many nuts but they add a wonderful flavor that truly makes this special!  I use my food processor to chop all of the nuts at once which saves a lot of time.  I bake the granola at 300 on two large parchment lined cookie sheets for 20 minutes, then at 325 for another 10 minutes, stirring & rotating pans every 10 minutes.  It hardens as it cools so if it's not as crunchy as you like after it cools, just pop it back in the oven for a bit longer.  Thanks for a great recipe Annie!

I'm so gad I found this recipe! I was using a different one on the site and I didn't realize how "not great" it was until I tried this. However, I did substitute apple sauce for the oil...and saved about 2,000 calories. Still tasted great!

Press it down while it's still warm and let cool.  Then it might break into larger clumps for easier toddler and little kid snacking!  My family loved this granola and they aren't big granola fans.

This is good stuff.  I did make 1/3 of the recipe and it made plenty.  I baked it for 15 min, flipped it, and baked it 15 min more.  It does not come out of the oven cripy, it is soft and gets crispy and slightly clumpy as it cools. *I also made one batch with Pumpkin Pie Spices and dried blueberries.  It was delish.

This granola really didn't do it for me.  I'm not sure what I expected but the flavor was kind of "off" to me.  The only change I made was I added some dried cherries along with the raisins & cranberries. My kitchen smells wonderful but that was the only wonderful part.  I was going to give some in gifts bags for Christmas but I think that I will forget that idea.  The couple of people who have tasted it gave it a thumbs down.  It makes a huge amount of granola - not sure what I will do with it.  PLUS, it took a lot of ingredients and the ingredients were not cheap. Maybe you should start out making a half batch. That way you won't waste quality & pricey ingredients.  I think you could find a better granola recipe than this. I was disappointed.

Breakfast of champions! I love this recipe! Since this recipe makes a huge amount I cut the entire thing in half and still ended up with a big batch. I did make a few minor alterations such as reducing the amount of oil, brown sugar, maple syrup and honey because I don't like sweet cereals. In the past I tried a granola recipe that came out heavy, oily and gross so that is why I reduced the oil by a few Tbsp. On the advice of another cook I added about 1/2 cup of unsweetened shredded coconut and it was so good! I think if I had used sweetened coconut it would have been overpowering but the unsweetened was perfect. One reviewer said the recipe is a bit pricey and it can be if you purchase everything in packages. If you go to a health food store such as Whole Foods (my favorite) you can buy all the dry ingredients in bulk. Rolled oats in bulk were $0.99/pound while a container that was about a pound was $2.99. Big difference! The great thing about bulk..you only buy what you need so bring a cup measure to the store if you have trouble eyeballing the amounts. I have never wanted to eat more than one bowl of cereal for breakfast in my entire life until I came across this recipe. Try it, you will never eat boxed cereal again! Thanks for sharing!

Fabulous! Thank You! Here are the changes I made and with these changes i have my permanant granola recipe. The changes were either due to not having on hand or personal preference. Here they are. I used no pecans, instead opted to add some sesame seeds. Eliminated brown sugar and opted to use primarily honey for the sweetness with a lil bit of maple syrup. In place of oat bran i sprinkled in some ground flax seeds and a lil extra rolled oats. Also eliminated cranberries and raisins. This is the best Granola I have ever experienced. Will be my one and only. Megan I Thank You!!

Great stuff! Good all around granola recipe. I used couple tablespoons less oil ...didn't have oat bran, pecans, or maple syrup...increased the honey to replace the maple syrup and was very pleased.  I recommend making this recipe as is once and then using it as a great jumping of point to make adaptions and create granola to suit your own tastes.

I try to give my kids food that are  healthy, homemade and as natural as possible and I have tried many different granola's but could never find one my kids would eat until now. They love it and ask for it every morning, they even help me make it. Thanks for having such healthy foods that I can feel comfortable making and giving them.

Update 02/06/07--Had to re-rate it to 5 stars this morning after having it for breakfast--excellent granola, a really hearty taste, lots of nice crunch! Original review 2/5/07: Although this is wholesome & healthy & tasty, I've been spoiled by another granola recipe on this site, so I have to give it 4 stars instead of 5. I left out the pecans & walnuts & used double the almonds. I followed What A Dish's suggestions of a little less honey & water for part of the oil. I liked the addition of honey & cinnamon. Good recipe but I'll probably go back to my old fave!

I never thought making granola would be so easy!  Next time I might make a larger batch of the stovetop mixture in hopes that the granola might "clump" more.  I used the recommended 4 cups of mixed nuts, but if you're not a huge nut lover, I'd scale that back a bit.  Also, for the dried fruit, I found a mix at Trader Joe's of dried blueberries, cherries, and strawberries that tasted great.  It required closer to 30 minutes in the oven, but overall, very easy and very good!

Great recipe.  I didn't have any wheat germ or sesame seeds so I just added that much more oatmeal. I also added hazelnuts and it turned out great.  I halved the recipe and got about a "normal" size box of cereal out of it. My husband is raving about it and my 18 month old loves it too.

I didn't have oat bran so I substituted some extra wheat germ and oats. At the end I added some semi sweet and white chocolate chips. I also threw in some dried dates and coconut. When I made this I cut the recipe in half and it still made a ton.

This recipe was really easy and tastes even better!  It is a good base recipe for granola (I  changed around some of the nuts etc).  This granola is great for topping yogurt or pudding.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Really great, although mine had to cook a bit more.  Use within a few weeks or it gets less crunchy.

This is really good!  I thought the cinnamon was a bit much, so next time I will probably reduce it.  I love the flexibility of the recipe and I think next time I might try another dried fruit.  Even my picky eater likes it!

I really like the flavor of this and that it isnt terribly sweet like so many store bought and even homemade granolas. It almost had a slight sweet and salty taste to it. I used all unsalted nuts, but it may have been from the salt amount or that I used sea salt. I used the change serving button to change it from 30 servings to 10. It still made a full sheet pan of granola. As I like the flavor ad is, I wasnt concerned about the dry fruit at the end. I think it may be good with a little freeze dried fruit or dried bananas. This would make a good cereal out of it. It has closer to that texture and sweetness anyhow. My only real issue, with the recipe, is that none of the oats clumped in clusters as I had expected. I preferred it being less sweet though. The calories are also quite high unless I stretch the servings. ty

Delicious! I didn't have walnuts, so I used pistachios I had on hand. I left out the raisins/cranberries (personal preference). I also reduced the recipe by 1/2, but this is so good I would be inclined to make the whole thing and jar it up for gifts. Thanks for a great recipe!

LOVE this granola recipe.  I made a half batch to see if we would like the consistency of this granola.  I made it as written and used the dried cranberries rather than the raisins, so my DH would eat it.  I also added a few dried bananas to the mix.  My DH and I enjoy this granola added to our morning yogurt.  I even enjoy it just as a bowl of cereal.  annie9, this is a wonderful recipe, and I appreciate you sharing it.

This was the second recipe for granola that I used and it worked perfectly.  My oven took forever for the granola to crisp.  I also change it up quite a bit adding the nuts that I like.  I don't add the raisins or dried fruit until the last few minutes of baking, that way they stay nice and moist! YUM!

I made this recipe twice, the first time I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup oil. I found after baking I needed to turn over the granola in clumps and put it back in a warm oven to dry out...loved it.  The second time I substituted 1 1/2 cups dark agave nectar for all of the sweetners, again substituted half the oil with applesauce, I also added a bag of coconut flakes before putting in the oven.  I liked this one even better and what a difference in calories and glycemic index.

The first time I made this recipe I accidentally bought steel cut oats instead of rolled oats.  I have made this many times and have used the steel cut ever since.  It gives a different texture, and is probably not for everyone, but it has become a home and work favorite as a topping for yogurt.  Thanks for sharing.

I cut this down to 8 servings, and that will give me plenty for a while!  I used coconut oil and raw honey but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I think next time I won't chop the nuts so finely, and I'll try boiling the liquid part a little longer to see if it does help it clump better.  I baked this at 300 for about 22 minutes, and that seemed right for this amount.  The taste is excellent!  I think extended family members will like this a lot!

I've been trying to find another granola recipe that is healthier.  We liked this one.  To cut down on some expense, I did leave out the sunflower seeds.  We are trying to cut back on sugar, so I left out the brown sugar and it was still a little bit sweet.  Kids didn't seem to notice it.  I also used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil.  I toasted it on the stove as opposed to baking, but maybe next time I will try baking it.

AMAZING!I have made this granola a couple of times, tweaking the add ons here and there. The sauce base is perfect. Like many others, I double the sauce to get clumpy Costco style granola. I have added 1/2 cup of peanut butter to the sauce, banana chips and chocolate chips and it was a huge hit. It truly is the best granola I've tried.Thanks Annie9 for the awesome recipe!

This is now my family's favorite granola recipe.  It's such a great base.  We added pistachios and cashews and kept them just a bit chopped (rather than finely) because we like the big crunch!  Try this over a bowl of yogurt.  It's delish!

I'm not sure why all the 5 stars on this recipe. The granola is just OK.  It is tasty, but certainly not the best granola ever.  I prefer a more chewy, chunky granola and this one didn't fit the bill.

Best granola recipe I've tried so far. I skipped the brown sugar and probably got less clumps because of it, but I didn't want it to be super sweet. I adjusted some of the dry ingredients to taste but kept the same overall amount, so it turned out really well.

Delicious!!!!

Changed it up a bit and used what I had on hand -- no oat bran, no sunflower seeds but added sesame seeds, some coconut -- and loved the maple/brown sugar/honey combo as well as all the nuts.  Hardly low fat, however, with all those nuts.  Also used half butter and half canola oil.  Baked at 300 degrees for 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes.  

I'll be making this again.

This is an excellent recipe.  It can be modified easily for particular tastes.  I stayed pretty faithful to the original with the exception that I added coconut manna to it.  To save some money, I printed out the recipe and took my measuring cups with me to bulk section of Whole Foods to buy the nuts only in the quantities I needed.  This saves money and doesn't leave you with multiple bags of nuts you may/may not use again.  It also saves time - you've already measured the nuts - just mix, toss the bags, and minimal clean up.  My family loved it and the teachers I brought it for also raved about it.

This recipe is great.  I use coconut oil instead of regular oil to make it healthier.  I have also used brown sugar substitute.

Great recipe!  I've never made my own granola before and thought why not since it is probably so much cheaper to make than store bought.  I customized this recipe based on what I had in the house.  I used pumpkin seeds, almonds, walnuts and sunflower seeds for the nut combo.  I increased the honey just a bit since I didn't have maple syrup.  I added in flaked coconut about 10 minutes before this was done.  I baked this at 300 degrees for 40 minutes.  Thank you for a great granola recipe!

This is one of my most popular treats - it's always finished down to the last crumb. Try it with pumpkin seeds, coconut flakes and crazens.

I've made this several times and love it every time.  I add 1 c. sesame seeds to it, and to make it healthy I use 1/2 cup of coconut oil instead of 1 c vegetable oil.  Makes it very flavorful.  Also, this last time I made it I added 1 tsp cardamom and 1 tsp corriander to the wet mixture.  You could barely pick up the taste, but it had just a little bit of that spicy zing.  When you put it in a bowl and pour steamed milk over it, it's the best!!!

This was amazing.  I used raisins, dried apple and cranberries, all finely chopped so that a raisin was in two or three pieces, and I left out the sunflower seeds.   Even my kids liked it -- It stores well and makes a great gift.

Awesome recipe. I've added ground flax (1/2 cup) as well as adding dried dates (3/4 cup) into this recipe, as well as using 1 cup each of golden raisins, and Craisins.  It is totally awesome, I combine one cup of this finished granola with a 6 oz. cup of my favorite Greek yogurt.

[2/12] Made a 1/2 batch [instant oats, bran flakes, almonds, walnuts, peanuts, sesame] and added coconut 20 min in.  Baked at 220 for 40min.  Omitted brown sugar.  1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup maple syrup.  No salt.

As some other reviewers stated, I halved the recipe and used organic ingredients. I replaced the oil with coconut oil and instead of brown sugar, added a tablespoon more honey. I think next time I would add some organic whole cane sugar to give it a little more sweetness since the saltiness is competing with the sweet. This was the first granola recipe I've made and my family and I are all enjoying it! By the way, halving the recipe almost filled a gallon sized storage bag.

Way to go Megan.  This is really wonderful granola.  I have never made granola before and was looking for a recipe to make and send to a soldier in the Middle East.  I followed the advise of some one somewhere and used quick oats (so it cooked through), and mixed it up with the nuts etc.  I also followed the advise of cooking at a lower temp - since I didn't want to run the risk of burning the batch.  I added peanut M&M's as well as the raisins.  This is great as a snack, but it is also great as a cereal with milk - if you leave out the M&M's.   I also used Blue Agave syrup instead of honey, since I wanted the Maple syrup to be the key sweet flavor. I don't think its too sweet at all.

Love this recipe.  I've adapted it slightly, only add 1c bran and germ then add 1/2-3/4 flax seed.  I skip the walnuts and just add extra pecans.  Also add 1/4 tsp clove, 1tsp nutmeg, more vanilla and cinnamon and add a cup of brown sugar.  Great starter recipe!

I always add more oats (old fashioned), halved the almonds (love big chucks), and didn't have maple syrup so left that out along with sunflower seeds. I will add banana chips and dried papaya next time, once cooked. Oh, and dates taste pretty good too.

First time making granola. This was really easy and fun to make. I added a 1/4 tsp almond extract and used raw wildflower honey, and real maple syrup. Accidentally baked it with cranberries mixed in but they're fine.

I love this granola because it's so easily customizable, makes a TON of granola and comes out crunchy where other recipes are more soft/soggy. Make sure you know how much you're making when you start - it surprised me the first time!

This is one of the best granolas I've ever tasted!  The whole family loves it.  I omitted walnuts and just added extra pecans and almonds.  I also chopped the nuts without pulverizing to keep a better texture.  I prefer dried blueberries so I omitted the raisins and cranberries.  Yum!  Delicious with milk :)

I used a little less oil and more cinnamon and vanilla. I also added flax seed and pumpkin seed. This is SO good!

I couldn't wait and had to try a bowl when it was cooling, it smelled so good! I cut the recipe in half and still had 2 pans full. I baked at 300 for 30 mins then added some coconut and ground flax seed for an additional 10 mins. I didn't have oat bran or the walnuts. Also, I did not add the brown sugar. It is plenty sweet without it and I like my sweets!  I am hooked!

YUMMY! YUMMY! YUM! It's just great to make homemade granola. A lot less sugar and no preservatives like the granola I used to buy in bulk at Central Market.  I cut the recipe in half and used enough maple syrup and honey to make about 1/2 a cup...(no brown sugar for me).  Added dried cranberries as soon as I pulled the granola out of the oven. DELICIOUS!!!   Can't wait to add a couple of spoonfuls to my yogurt for breakfast.

I haven't had a chance to make this recipe, but it looks almost exactly to one I have been making. Here's a tip though...you can substitute the honey and maple syrup with Agave Nectar. Or use a combination. I even used all three since I was low on all of it. Didn't make a difference and mixed up the flavor from the last batch. I've never used brown sugar since the syrup/honey/agave gives it plenty of sweetness. I have also used flax seed instead of oat bran. My combination takes at least a half hour to bake. I stir it carefully on the tray for the first 30 min and give it another 10 minutes. It isn't overly crunchy or clumpy but seems to give a bit more umph to the granola and holds up really well in milk. I'm rating it 5 stars because I know this is an amazing granola recipe (or close enough) and my friends go crazy over it!

Awesome recipe.  It is great to have such a reliable and delicious base recipe to play with.  I left out the maple syrup to unsweeten a little and the oat bran because I didn't have.  Wonderful with mini chocolate chips.  My son doesn't know I ate some with it.  Shhhhh!!!!  Don't tell.

Loved this granola!  After first batch kids weighed in on likes and dislikes ... now I add extra oat bran in place of wheat germ, add extra honey in place of maple syrup and replace sunflower seeds for pepitas (pumpkin seeds).  Thank you for such a great recipe!

AMAZING. I made it exactly as stated once, but the second time around did NOT include sunflower seeds (they were too over-powering, in my opinion). I personally prefer it without the sunflower seeds, since it allows the truly nutty flavor of the granola to come out.  Set at 350 degrees (25 higher than in the recipe), my granola still did not really "crisp" noticeably, but as long as you cook it for 20 minutes and then let it cool, you will get a nice, crunchy, clumpy granola.  As others have stated, you can spend ~$30 on ingredients, but the recipe makes about a gallon of granola, so you're set for weeks!

I also have a daughter Megan, and we think this is a wonderful recipe with many variations! After trying exactly, I have made countless variations substituting half the oil with water, changing the oil to coconut, substituting the oat bran (or wheat germ, for a gluten-free child) with coconut or coconut flour, adding different extracts (1/4-1/2 tsp almond is an EXCELLENT addition to the vanilla), and using a few more spices like nutmeg and/or allspice along with the cinnamon. I prefer the almonds sliced, the walnuts coarse, and the seeds omitted. I also omit the maple syrup (cost). I think you can't go wrong! I DO BAKE MUCH LONGER than 20 minutes, reducing oven to 300 if necessary, to get the proper drying and crunch. It should be a nice golden brown.

Made the recipe as stated except for the oat bran (couldn't find any)and the cranberries (don't like them).  It was okay but I thought the sunflower seeds were over powering.  Will leave those out next time.  I too have taken other member's suggestions and replace the oil with a combination of coconut/grapeseed oil and unsweetened applesauce, boil the liquid a little longer, adding the vanilla when done boiling.  Sometimes I drizzle honey and/or maple syrup on one pan (this makes two large cookie sheets), and pressing down the other pan for chunky granola.  Also, this burned in my oven, so now I cook it at 250 (stirring every 30 minutes) for about an hour or until the desired color is reached.  My family loves it.  Update, I have made this many times.  This recipe is very versatile.  I have added quinoa flakes, flax seed meal all types of brans and germs, nuts, etc (keeping the amounts the same).  You can also play with the sweetness to suit your taste.  We eat this as cereal, on yogurt, as a snack whenever.  You can mix in any fruits and chocolate or mini M&M's when it comes out of the oven.  It will clump as it cools.

I made this a couple days ago and added dried sour cherries (yum) w/cranberries and golden raisins and what a treat!!! Believe it or not it seems to get better every day the Canadian pure maple syrup didn't hurt... LOL. I baked on 2 cookie sheets @ 325 for 20 minutes each. I did keep an eye on it and turned them often cooled for the 20 minutes, perfectly crunchie and not too sweet. served over plan vanilla yogurt - WOW. I bought some beautiful jars for storage and they will make great gifts!!!!! Thanks for sharing.

Followed the recipe as is (except I used buckwheat instead of oat bran cause that's what I had) and it turned out wonderful! LOVE IT! A new family staple. We just kept ours in the counter in a large 9X13 dish with plastic wrap on top. We didn't heat ours but you could for a warm breakfast. We put berries and milk on ours...wonderful!

Excellent recipe. Used only 1/2 cup of oil.  Substituted agave nectar for the maple syrup.  Didn't have the oat bran, but tossed 1/2 cup of ground flax on top of the granola as soon as it came out of the over.  Baked for 20 minutes at 300.  Made one batch with Craisins and one with Choc. chips - both were delicious.  As other reviewers said, it is key to let it cool for 20 minutes or so. Mine came out of the oven a little chewy, but within 20 minutes, the granola was delicious and crunchy.  Thank you!

The great thing about this recipe is that it is so versatile and you can add and omit anything that you want!  I decided to take out the sunflower seeds and add more pecans, almonds and rolled oats.  I didn't want to add any maple syrup and instead added more honey and it tasted great.  I preferred to bake it longer on each side, about 12 minutes, so the nuts were toasted a little bit.  I added cranberries in the beginning with the rest of the dry ingredients and it turned out fine.  Instead of having to mix in the middle of the baking time, I  took a pan out of the oven, placed parchment paper on top, then placed a cookie pan on top and flipped the whole thing so the granola was flipped and I wouldn't have to stir - it worked out great but make sure you have a good grip of both pans or else granola goes flying!  Have fun with this recipe and remember, you can't go wrong with the ingredients!

Delicious and the proportions are just right. I followed the recipe exactly. Another reviewer mentioned that it was expensive- but I think the opposite. One box of granola at the store is almost $5, so this will save me a bundle in the long run!

not enough sauce to coat all the oats.  was a bit bitter. wasn't really good to eat plain but was good to mix in yogurt and ice cream with out adding extra sweetness.

Great  basic recipe that you can adjust to your own taste.  I left out the maple syrup, and it tastes great without it.  I did bake mine longer than the 20 min to get it more crisp.  It is a bit pricey to buy all the ingredients initially, but it makes a huge batch of relatively healthy granola without all the preservatives.  Will definitely make again.

My husband asked for home made granola yesterday and I had never made it before.  I made this and we are so happy with it!  I added some nutmeg and used all almonds and walnuts instead of the sunflower seeds and pecans.  I will make this over and over!  Thanks!

I would've never, in a million years, thought that was all there was to making REALLY GOOD granola!!!!  I made it with the kids and I actually had to reprimand them to stop eating it or it would've been gone before my husband got home from work (and it was for him!)  Made it just as written but with 1 c. raisins and 1 c. craisins.  Can't wait to try it on ice cream or yogurt and as cereal.  Most helpful advice from previous reviewer is to not panic when it comes out of the oven looking less than crunchy.  As it cools, it does crunchify.  Ahhhhh, granola with an ingredient list that entirely pronounceable.

I get lots of recipes off this site but have never sent a review.  This one deserves it.  Loved the recipe and loved all the comments about substitutions and cautions about over-cooking.  It definitely crisps up after baking!  Another tip is to just stir in your fruit each time you serve - if you do that the granola will stay crisper when you keep it in your airtight container for storing.

Wonderful 'base' recipe.  This one is definitely a keeper.  I also tweaked a bit.  I omitted the sunflower and maple syrup and I added as other suggested the coconut oil instead of veg. oil.   I also added dried banana chips and pineapple along with the cranberries.  I bet anything you add to this would be good in many variations.  Thank you Annie9!

LOVED this recipe. Loads better than store bought, and a breeze to make. I used hearty steel-cut oats, a little less sugar, pecans and dried cherries. I left out the walnuts and sunflower seeds.   I will definitely make. Thanks annie9 for a great recipe!

Easy and adaptable. After it comes out of the oven, I squish the granola in the tin foil until it cools and hardens. I get some nice big clumps that way.

Delicious! Perfect proportions (with author's correction) I used flax seed meal instead of oat bran. Slivered almonds are great in it. Thanks.

Delicious!  I did change the recipe slightly.  Left out brown sugar, used 3/4c maple syrup and 1/4c honey, used oats, oat bran, wheat germ, sesame seeds, almonds, vanilla, coconut oil.  Had trouble not burning it.  Will turn heat down next time and cook a little longer. Will definitely make this again!

I thought this was very good. I wish it were crispier, but based on other reviews I needed to cook it just a bit longer. But the flavor is very good. Next time I'll experiment to try to make it lower-fat. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

When looking for a granola recipe to make, (I've never made it before) I saw this one with over 150 positive reviews. I laughed and thought, "Well, it must be ok." As everyone has stated, it is wonderful. It has a wonderful combination of honey, sugar, and maple. I'm not a big maple fan, but this was great. My husband loved it. So, future readers, everyone is right. This is a fantastic granola recipe!

It seems unfair to rate a recipe I've changed, but it's SOOO good, I wanted to add my 5 stars.  To start, I only changed the recipe because I didn't have a few of the ingredients, like the oat bran, sunflower seed, almonds, and wheat germ.  I will add at least some of those ingredients the next time I make it for the added health benefits.  I added extra walnuts (to make up for the lack of almonds) and coconut per other's reviews.  I also cut back on the oil, using 3/4 cup of canola (what I always have on hand).  I think I'll cut back on the honey the next time, too, just to try and have less sugar.  The recipe is great the way it is, but I think you could use less sweetener and it would still be good.  I baked mine at 300, since other readers mentioned problems burning (and I know that would be me to forget about it!)  It took almost 30 minutes at 300.  Whatever temperature you use, WATCH it in the last 10 minutes or so, it gets toasty looking really fast!  In all, a GREAT recipe the way it is, and it's even BETTER because of all the creativity you can have with it!

LOVE it!  I made my 1st batch yesterday, and it's half gone already!  I quit buying store-bought cereal for my 4 kiddos, and needed an alternative to hot cereals.  My teenager wants it for snacks, the 10 year old that hates nuts likes it very well, and the 2 year old calls it "cookie cereal" and ate 1 1/2 cups of it for breakfast this morning!  Next batch I will play with the ingredients to add some variety, but this is totally perfect as-is.  Sweetened perfectly, but not too much, and crunchy, chewy and very flavorful!  I did need to adjust the cooking time as my oven cooks slowly, but that was the only difference.  I opted to stir it every 5 minutes as I have bad memories of burnt granola from my childhood lol!  This will certainly be a household staple now - thank you so much for the fabulous recipe!

Really good!  I made with sugar free syrup, splenda and brown sugar twin and it came out great. Added freshly ground flax seed (1/2 cup) which gives a nice nutty flavor. Thanks for a fabulous recipe! I will be making the full version for christmas gifts this year.

This is wonderful.  We highly recommend it.  In case anyone out there does Weight Watchers, we figured that the amount that fits in a 2 ounce cup has 1 W.W. point.

My husband is CRAZY about this granola. He does not eat breakfast unless it's available. I followed the recipe except have used half applesauce/half oil and that works fine. Also added coconut which I personally feel takes it from 'good' to 'great'. Also read the review from the author who stated they changed the recipe and she uses 1 T. cinnamon and vanilla and it is MUCH better with the extra. Be careful not to overcook and you will love this one!

I cut the recipe in half, as the original makes quite a bit. I followed the recipe exactly with one exception- I added about 1/4 c. of milled flax seed for health benefits. Oh, it took a bit longer than 20 minutes in my oven to get nice and toasted. This is great with vanilla yogurt!

This is a wonderful granola recipe!  I've tried it with and without raisins and with the addition of coconut.  It tastes fabulous each way.  I may never try another granola recipe because this one is so good.  I bake it at a slightly lower temperature - 300 degrees.  Other than that, I make no changes to the original recipe.

This recipe is GREAT!  So simple, and very easy to do.  It was my first time to make granola, and this recipe is a "keeper"!  I did make a few changes - used 1-1/2 C. flax seed meal instead of the wheat germ and oat bran, used 3 C. salted mixed nuts, and cut down on the amount of salt added.  Because I like a stronger vanilla flavor, I used 2 tsp. instead of 1.  Baked it at 300 degrees for 30-40 min. It is more crispy if you use extra cookie sheets, and spread it really thin.  YUM!!

This was awesome! Couldn't stop eating it. I had all the ingredients on hand. Crushed some bran flakes from Raisin Bran for the bran part, and used the raisins for the fruit part. Also had some dried cranberries. The perfect mix of salty and sweet!

Delicious & Simple!  We used ingredients we had on hand ~ butter instead of vegetable oil, no maple syrup, just honey and brown sugar.  (It made it sweet enough for us.)  We also added cloves and a bit of nutmeg  
Immediately after baking we also added flax seeds.  We make this often per our children's request!!

I took the advice of some other reviewers and omitted the brown sugar and added an extra cup of honey, Next time I would leave the brown sugar in and still use the extra honey. I find it not quite sweet enough they way I did it. I also used 2 cups of pecans and omitted the walnuts. I had not wheat germ, so I left it out and added a bit more oatmeal and a bit more oat bran. I also added 1 cup of sweetened, shredded coconut. I used 1 cup of dried cranberries, 1/2 c raisins and 1/2 dried currants. All in all very good, especially the way I eat normally it which is in yogurt.

Really a great snack granola as directions call for but to use as a cereal combined with (raw) milk the amount of salt is way too much.I will reduce to 1/4 t or none at all next time and I used 1T cinnamon and 1T vanilla.

OH WOW! that is amazing!  I did not have any what germ or oat bran on hand, but i was craving granola, so i just used Bran Buds and a little extra oatmeal instead.  I also added a touch more cinnamon and everything came out amazing!  i like how you can't pick out the cinnamon, or the maple, but it all blends together.  You and your daughter are brilliant!  I'vbe been eating this no stop for teh past 3 days!

This was excellent!  I had to leave out the nuts and sunflower seeds due to an allergy, but I did add 1/4 teaspoon imitation almond extract and I substituted Rice Krispies for the nuts and it made for a lighter granola.  I have also made this using a combination of dried fruits (apricots, cherries, cranberries and raisins).

Super yummy-- I just finished making it and am already planning what to add next time.  I used cranberries but I think dried apples and raisins would be tasty. Makes tonnes though--  I halved it and still have plenty

When removing the granola from the oven, I poured the granola back into the mixing bowl and folded in chocolate chips. Of course the chocolate melted and coated the granola. I get my chocolate fix with crunchy fruit and fiber all together. Yum!

This recipe turned out amazing! My husband & kids absolutely loved it. I did however make a couple changes, I cancelled out the maple syrup. I felt the honey & brown sugar was just the right amount of sweetness. I also substituted the vegetable oil for olive oil. The bake time was way to high I brought it down to 250 * at  25-30 min. checking it frequently and it was a nice brown color.  To get the crunch you have to let it cool , once cool I broke it up and it was perfect clusters of granola.  I added banana chips & and other favorites. Such a hit didn't even last till the next day

This is my go-to granola recipe.  My family can’t get enough of it and I give jars of it away as presents.  I’ve made a few adjustments to suit my family’s taste.  I replace sunflower seeds with pumpkin seeds, eliminate the walnuts and increase the almonds and pecans, reduce the salt, leave out the oat bran (can’t get it locally but might try flax meal as others have suggested), replace vegetable oil with olive oil, and bake it an extra 10 minutes to get it extra crispy.  I buy most of the ingredients at Aldi’s which keeps the cost down.  NOTE:  I ran out of real maple syrup once and used a regular pancake syrup instead with disappointing results.  I doubled the baking time and was still unable to get the same crispness.

Soooo good !! I took others advice and subbed in coconut oil instead .  Added pumpkin seeds and only used almonds because I prefer those nuts I also added 1/4 cup of ground flax and I halved the recipe because I thought there would be no way I would eat all of it .. I was wrong I am now making a fresh batch as I type . I also did not find this overly sweet as some have pointed out . Yummy Try  this you won't be disappointed !!

This was amazing but a bit too sweet. So,  I  made it with 1/2 the honey, no maple syrup and substituted 1/2 cup of the veg oil with coconut oil instead.  My kids said it was "bangin' "!

I used 4 cups of quick cooking oats, 3 1/2 total cups of nuts/seeds, 1/3 raw organic honey, 1/4 brown sugar, and 1/3 organic maple syrup.  I cooked it @ 250 degrees F for 1 hr, mixing every 15 minutes.  In the last 15 minutes i sprinkled unsweetened coconut on top, then added in 1 cup of mixed dried fruit when cooled.  Deeeeeeelish!!!

I thought I'd try this one by making half a batch.  I loved it.  I used the convection setting on my oven and set it to 300. Stirred it every 10 minutes and it was a golden brown at exactly 30 minutes.   After we polished that batch off, it was off to the co-op for supplies and last night I made a full batch.  This is just so versatile - no changes are necessary, but it's so easy to  personalize.   I did mix rolled oats, rye and barley, but kept the 8 cups.  I think if you keep the quantities about the same, you'll be good to go.   I went with coconut oil, and chopped up some dried cherries and dates to mix in with the craisins and raisins. I think my dried fruit was probably closer to 2 1/2 cups and then chopped up some toasted unsweetened coconut and added to the fruit.  I mixed pumpkin, pepitas, and sunflower seeds because I just like em and had probably a heavy cup, total.  I did need a little help when pouring the heated syrup onto the mix.  I used a large bread making bowl and as the syrup was drizzled over my grains and nuts, I stirred with a large spoon to coat everything evenly.  I divided the batch to two half sized baking sheets w/ ½ inch lips, used parchment paper and did the 30 minute @300 convection setting.  When the second pan was completed, and still hot, I mixed the two pans together in the bread bowl, then added the dried fruits and stirred well. We loaded up quart jars and air sealed them to keep it nice and fresh, but I don't think it's going to last long

Very delicious.  After reading many reviews, I made a few changes.  First, I substituted coconut oil (unrefined to add a little coconut flavor) for the vegetable oil.  I omitted sunflower seeds and added an extra cup of almonds.  I mixed everything together and baked at 250-degrees for 1 1/2 hours, turning every 30 minutes.  I substituted a blend of dried berries for the raisins.  Delicious!

This is one of the best Granola recipes I've made, without any changes. We eat granola all the time for the benefits beyond other cereals and the price of same. Had a friend visiting from France who has eaten some almost every morning this past week commenting, it's the best he's ever had. I could see changes to make in this recipe, but not because it needs any, but more just for variations. Granola is definitely something that begs for change ups. Good stuff, indeed.

Ok, here's the thing...I followed the recipe EXCEPT I left out the fruit and the nuts.  I was trying to make homemade honey nut bunches of oats.  I wanted the bunches, cuz well...bunches.  Ya know?  So I made these without the fruit and nuts and let it get clumpy as it cooled.  It will not clump while hot, so do not leave it in the oven hoping that it will.  That happens as it cools.  This turned out fantastic as bunches.  I added to the cornflakes I had baked with a sweet syrup and cooled.  I tossed those together and now we add whatever fruits, nuts, etc that we want and customize our own cereal flavor.  This recipe written as is was perfect for this.

Love this recipe. Made it once exactly like the recipes and added unsweetened coconut flakes to the second batch. I only made half batches both times since it makes a lot . No problem with it burning at 325, but I did use convection.

This is an absolute never fail recipe. It's a springboard for creative interpretation. I'm allergic to walnuts, so I never put them in.  One time I mistakenly used chipotle -it was awesome!

We make this by the tub!  My husband's absolute favourite and the way we start our day, every day.  I double the cinnamon and vanilla, but that is just a personal preference.  One thing I would suggest to the granola newbies out there - follow the cooking directions.  The first time I made it I had never made granola before and cooked it, and cooked it, and cooked it, trying to achieve the golden brown crumbly appearance you get at the market.  Does NOT HAPPEN!!!  Cook it for the time in the recipe!!!  It seems wet, but when it cools it all comes together to make a beautiful crunchy breakfast!!

I have been making this granola for quite a while (some years now) and absolutely love it.  It's my kids favorite "cereal".  I serve it to them in a bowl with milk and they go nuts.  The only change I make is instead of using vegetable oil, I use unrefined coconut oil.  The taste of the unrefined coconut oil (which has a coconut taste) adds another dimension of flavor to the granola.  Yummy!!!

This was my first attempt at Granola. ABSOLUTELY perfect. my kids ate it up. poured milk on in for breakfast, brought it with for a snack, munched on it while watching a movie, etc. 

The only thing I would change (not from the recipe, I made it exact, and it was perfect) would be waiting until it was completely cool. I like the chunky clusters. I was inpatient, so mine didn't cluster.

To make this gluten-free, I substituted the wheat bran with a 1/2 cup of sesame seeds and 1 cup of shredded unsweetened coconut.  I baked it at 275 degrees for one hour stirring every 20 minutes.  Delicious!

This recipe is fantastic. It is easy to do, my 8 year old usually does most of the measuring and mixing. My 6 kids and my husband and I eat it almost every morning for breakfast or on top of the yogurt that I make.

Awesome recipe ! I personally substitute ground flax in place of the wheat germ and oat bran. I also add dried cranberries, raisens, chopped dried pineapple, mango, and apricots. I'm cheap so in leu of walnuts, pecans and almonds I use unsalted pepitas and unsalted sunflower seeds. Up the cinnamon to a tablespoon, throw in some ground nutmeg. Find a jar and ribbon and bam, Christmas gifts !

I was concerned that this was a little too dry before I baked it, so I added 1/2 cup of melted, unsalted butter. It turned out very we'll, with bigger clumps of granola, which we like.

I have made this recipe, exactly as written several times now and it never fails to be sooo much better than any store bought granola.  I add pumpkin seeds and have added cold milled/ground flax as well, depending on what I have handy.  Perfectly crunchy, cooked at 325 for 20+ minutes, depending on how it looks at 20 I add a few minutes.
I like the little video that they have for it now, looks exactly like how mine looks as I cook it.  Wonderful on yogurt, over cereal with fresh blueberries or strawberries, or eaten plain by the handful, great recipe!

Yum. Yum. Look no further for a fantastic granola recipe! I replaced the vegetable oil with healthier coconut oil (which you cannot even taste in the finished product) and had to bake mine for almost an hour to achieve that golden brown color that is typical of granola.  On the advice of several other reviewers, I also eliminated the brown sugar and the granola was plenty sweet.  **Update 4/03/14**Made this again with the brown sugar and I like it much better.  The granola was crunchier, had more flavor and had more of those granola chunks you expect to find in granola.  Will add the brown sugar from now on just as the recipe states.

Too salty. Omit salt all together or cut in 1/2 other than that great recipe! I didn't have syrup and didn't want to use up my honey so I used brown sugar in place of it and added 1/2 cup of butter to make a syrup consistency. It was great!

Substituted coconut oil for vegetable oil and thanks to my brother-in-law's brainstorm replaced the maple syrup with Kahlua. Really yummy.

This is my go-to granola, I add ground flax seed instead of wheat germ and put molasses and applesauce in the hot syrup sauce.  I also leave the nuts in bigger pieces for more crunch.  Love it.

I use this all the time and love it with Plain Greek Yogurt and fruit for breakfast.  I have used blue Agave Nectar in place of the syrup and cocount oil in place of the vegetable oil and still delicious and a little lower in fat too.

This is hands down, the best granola recipe I have ever tried. It is absolutely delicious! The only modifications... I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil (based on suggestions); it added a great fragrance as well as flavor. I used cashews instead of almonds (left a few in whole pieces) and I boiled the sugar mixture in the microwave (was quick and easy). When the trays were completely cooled (I did this in the fridge), I chopped the granola up into bite sized squares. The leftover crumbs (about a half gallon), I put into a large ziplock which I had as cereal this morning! It is so yummy, and filling, I cannot wait to share it and the recipe with my co workers. Thank you for such a great recipe!

This granola is the best--not overly cinnamony, not overly sweet. I make it gluten free by swapping wheat germ for coconut flakes and/or extra oat bran. I also swap out the walnuts for pumpkin seeds sometimes. It's so good with yogurt and fruit as a parfait or just eaten dry as a snack at work.

I agree that as written,  this granola is delicious;  however,  many of us wish to avoid the high level of fat added by the oil.  There is a simple substitution for that:  instead of 1 cup oil,  I use 1/3 cup oil plus beaten egg whites to make one cup total.   I also reduce the honey to 1/3 cup and add 1/3 cup of peanut butter to the liquid mixture. No need to boil the liquid mixture.  Just mix well and stir for a long time with the dry ingredients before baking. The egg whites and peanut butter add a boost of protein which makes this an even more hearty meal to start the day.  It will still crisp up to a crunchy texture as it cools.  My family loves it made this way;  I've also given packages of my version as gifts and have been told I could found a bakery business on the strength of this granola!

I have tried a few different granola recipes and this one is the best one that I have tried.  The only thing I changed was to use coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil.  I really like the added flavor of the coconut and it also makes it healthier.

I have not purchased any store bought cereal in over a year. I make this granola every 2 weeks, my family loves it. I do not add the brown sugar, but use a full cup of honey instead. And use coconut oil instead of vegetable. I also mix up the nuts and fruit, sometimes also adding shredded coconut. Really is wonderful.

Double this recipe! You will love it that much. I used 12 cups of rolled oats and 1/3 more of all other ingredients. I also added another tablespoon of cinnamon. A hit! Parchment paper to line the baking sheet is a great tip -- it means minimal washing up afterwards.

Used 1/2 oil and half applesauce.  It was a little chewier than I liked so next time I will cook it a little longer. I was just so worried because of all the warnings about it burning! A good recipe for my first try at granola!

While I made some minor changes based on what I had in the pantry, my first attempt at granola is a hit.  I omitted the almonds and brown sugar without changing any other measurements and it was plenty nutty and sweet enough.  I look forward to trying other combinations and ways to reduce calories and raise nutrition.  Thanks for sharing.

I've made this about 20 times now.  I substitute coconut oil for the vegetable oil.  I have a gigantic bowl and triple this recipe (expensive, but it lasts a long time)I use equal amounts of the nuts and grains as to what I have on hand at the time. After baking, I sprinkle craisins, dried blueberries, dried apples etc and let it cool in the pan, then it comes out in bigger chunks.  This will be my go to granola recipe base forever!

I've make this several times. Much healthier and less expensive than store-bought. 

Use parchment paper (browns perfectly), not aluminum foil. I add dried cranberries as we want them.

Great basic granola recipe with lots of flexibility.  To make 1/2 a recipe, you need 4 cups oats, 1-1/2 c. wheat and/or oat bran, 1/2 cup honey and/or maple syrup, 2 cups of nuts and/or sunflower seeds, 3/4 tsp salt, 1/2 c. vegetable, coconut or other oil, 1/2 Tbs cinnamon, 1/2 Tbs vanilla and 1 cup dried fruit.  Add 1/4 cup of brown sugar to taste.  I generally use honey rather than maple syrup since I couldn't detect any maple flavor and the honey is much cheaper.  Also I cannot recommend some of the water-based substitutions I've seen in other reviews such as applesauce, water and maple flavor (??) - you are making many servings of granola and the oil fills an important purpose.

This is really good. 
It fills you and stays with you. 
Our family generally prefers the dried cranberry variant. 
We tried pumpkin seeds, and decided that sunflower seeds suit us more. 
OUR MAJOR VARIANT is substituting 1/2 of the cooking oil with coconut oil. 
Doing so has added a bit of sweetness of coconut without the texture of the shredded coconut. 
There is strong nutritive value found in coconut.

I did modify this a bit.  I used only 1/4c of honey (along with the 1/4c of maple syrup), coconut oil and coconut sugar (in place of the brown sugar).  

In one version, I only used dried apples instead of raisins (with pecans only) and apple pie spice.  Then in another recipe I used the same modifications but with sliced almonds and pumpkin seeds and pumpkin pie spice with raisins. Tastes awesome!

I love this recipe and especially appreciated the reviews that caution for over roasting! I wouldn't have known that the granola crisps up as it cools so when you take it out it's still kind of moist! I followed a couple of other suggestions - omitted the brown sugar completely and it was plenty sweet enough for me. I also used 1/2 cup butter instead of the oil - just my preference - and it tasted delicious! 
One other thing - I wanted to preserve the health benefits of using raw honey so I didn't boil the mixture of honey, syrup and (in my case) melted butter. Worked out fine.

I halved this recipe and it still made a LOT of granola.  Great if you have a large family you are feeding, but for us I would probably half it again.  I ended up making several substitutions as I did not have all ingredients listed in the recipe.  I had no wheat germ or oat bran but I had ground flax so I used just that.  I had no honey so I used pure maple syrup.  I had no sunflower seeds so used what I did have which was filberts and almonds.  I also added huge organic coconut flakes and Trader Joe's tropical fruit mix and dates.  This is a great base recipe and I was very happy with my results.  Definitely will keep this one on file for future use!

Very nice. Also added some coconut to the mixture and made the mistake of adding the raisins and dried cranberries before cooking. Turned out well.

I was looking for a good granola recipe to take along with my family on car trips. This one fits the bill perfectly! I didn't quite have enough oats so I subbed Cheerios (Which are always in abundance here!) for part of the oats. I added chopped dried mixed fruit. To a quarter of the mixture I added some dark M&Ms for trail mix. the rest I saved for snacking and cold cereal. It was crispy and yummy and just chunky enough for finger food. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Really like this recipe.  I followed the recipe except I skipped the sunflower seeds and I didn't add raisins. I'm also not a fan of cinnamon, but it wasn't over powering.  I do think it needs a little fruit just to brighten it a bit, so next time I may add cranberries. Can't wait to try different varieties.  This makes a lot more than I expected, good thing, hubboo ate half a pan in the first night!

Took the suggestion of one of the reviewers below: cut out the brown sugar altogether, used 1 cup of maple syrup, and used 1 TB honey.  I like it less sweet than the original. Great recipe though! Thank you!!!

It was my first try with granola and I will use it as a base recipe. I changed quite a bit because I didn't have all of the ingredients but I wanted to try it. I made a half batch with the oats, 1/2C flax seed, 1/2C flax meal & 1/2 C wheat bran because that is what I had on hand. I also subbed pumpkin seeds, cashews and almonds for the nuts. I used cranberries, raisins and some chocolate chips after it cooled. I thought it was as good as any granola that I have bought. I baked @ 325 for 30 min and stirred every 10 min. It does not get crunchy until it cools. I think I would sub coconut oil for veg oil and add coconut next time.

Loved this! Will be my go to recipe for granola. I like things real sweet so will add more sugar next time. Baked at 300 for 25 mins. Never really clumped together for me but it did crisp up once it cooled.

This granola is fantastic!  I changed two things though.  Firstly, I added a cup of Chia seeds to the dry ingredients.  Chia seeds are a great source of Omega 3 as well as adding some interesting texture and color to the mix.  Secondly, I found that toasting for 20 minutes was insufficient.  I toasted my batch for about 35 minutes stirring every 10 minutes and it turned out great.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have been making this recipe for a couple months now. I have tried other recipes, but this one is the best so far. In the past, I have had trouble getting the granola to toast. I finally realized that I was trying to cook too much at one time. I put a thin coating on the baking sheet and cook small batches at a time. This works much better. The granola is crunchier too. 
Thanks for the recipe, it goes great with homemade yogurt!

I've made this recipe, with modification, every two weeks this year (we eat a lot of granola in our house!) and I've never had mine burn. I think the trick is to have a thick layer of it in the pan as opposed to a thin one.

Like others, I omit the brown sugar all together, and cut the oil in half by using apple sauce. I also like to add some extra spice (ginger, cloves, and nutmeg) and sometimes I add some apple juice or lemon juice, too. I never make this recipe the same way twice, and I've never been disappointed. Thanks for a great breakfast!

I have made this recipe for years and will keep making it.  I make homemade yogurt and then sprinkle this on top.  It’s so yummy!  It does break down into little clumps which is great over yogurt but if your looking for bigger clumps this isn’t the recipe.  This recipe has a great balance of sweetness with the honey!

I use this recipe as a basis for my modified version. Don't get me wrong, I do love the original, but sometimes in favor of less fat + sugar content, I half the amount of oil + honey, skip the brown sugar altogether.  Either way, this is a great recipe!!

Delicious!  I didn't have some of the add ons like flax and I did omit oil and replaced with mashed ripe banana.  Chocolate chips, craisins, raisins, walnuts,  almond slivers and the result was a banana chocolate deliciousness!  I did add in flaxseed meal as well.  The calories are lower by omitting the oil and because I had no sunflower seeds, wheat germ, pecans ... I think the calories were much lower.  Anyway you make it it's great.

I can't say enough about how much I love this recipe. I've been wanting to make homemade granola forever and this is my first introduction. I have made a number of alterations based on the reviews, but I love how many ways you can mix it up! It comes out fabulous each and every time. This is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.

This is such a great recipe! The boiling of the wet ingredients seems such a no-brainer, but I never thought of it! I also added after it was cool toasted coconut, dried cherries instead of raisins, and dark chocolate chips! I left half with no dried fruit for plain cereal.

This is the best Granola Recipe we have found, although I do not cook it, we love it raw and add molasses instead of the brown sugar, my kids eat it as a cereal with some milk or snack on it after soccer and take to school for a snack, i have a bag in the car for myself a healthy snack while driving the kids around. Thanks Megan!!

Easy to make; tastes great just out of hand.  Fine balance of sweet from the honey with the cinnamon and vanilla flavors.  Haven't eaten any cold with milk yet.  I believe this would taste fantastic eaten hot, too.  It's the best idea to add the dried fruit after baking so it doesn't get too dried out and hard.

I just made this, my first time making granola. Fresh out of the oven we have eaten two bowls each and I have not even added the fruit yet! This recipe is a keeper for sure.

I have never made granola before, and this was a great recipe to use.  I read a lot of other reviews on it and switched it around a bit based on what I had and what comments had said.  I halved the recipe, and didn't have wheat germ or oat bran.  I added in more oats for the wheat germ.  I left out the sunflower seeds also.  Used 1/4 cup of maple syrup, and 2 tablespoons honey (just what I had more of/less of) and put in about 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg and clove.  Mixed everything together and spread on 2 cookie sheets.  Baked 25 minutes in a 300 degree oven, mixing halfway through and switching the sheets from top to bottom.  When cooled I added in some chopped dark chocolate instead of raisins.  And just now realized I forgot the oil completely (whoops!).  It tastes great, but isn't really clustered much.  I'll have to try it again with more of the ingredients and see how it turns out.  But I'm VERY HAPPY with it and my first attempt :)

I really liked this recipe.  I didn't have sunflower seeds or cranberries but it still was terrific.  Once trying it I returned the granola to the bowl, added melted butter, more cinnamon, honey and salt, then baked it again for 20 minutes.  Wonderful the second time around!

This is a very good basic granola recipe.  This is my base recipe for every batch of granola I make.  I turn the over down to 275 degrees, though, as I've had too many batches get too brown.  Just a tip - if you like raw walnuts, it's probably best to add them after the granola is baked and cooled.  They develop a funny taste in the oven (I don't have this problem when using them in breads or desserts - just granola.  Not sure why?).

This recipe is great.  I have made it several times and my roommates and I devour it.  Just recently - we replaced 2 cups of the oats with puffed rice and added a cup of coconut.  Add some extra flavor and crunch - but truly - the recipe is good as is.

I made this recipe for the first time today and it was wonderful.  I added a cup of sesame seeds and instead of walnuts, I used raw cashews because that is all I had.  I also ran out of honey and ended up using agave syrup instead. It turned out great

So tastely - Better, healthier and cheaper than store bought.  Once you find the ingredients (I for one never had looked for wheat germ in my life!), it is a breeze to make... Just make sure you don't over cook at burn the granola!  Very yummy and easy to make different versions.

Tried several granola recipes before lucking out on this one.  The honey/brown sugar/maple syrup combination is perfect.  I do cut back on the nuts by half and only do 1.5 cups of bran/germ, resulting in a chewier granola.  Thank you, Megan.

I'm making my 3rd batch since Christmas and absolutely love this recipe.  I accidently overboiled the syrup/honey mixture during the 2nd batch and found it makes for a crunchier/crisper granola (our preference).   Thanks for sharing!

This granola is heavenly.  After much prayer, reading all the reviews, and a little tweaking (only had to change cooking times and temps) it turned out perfect.  I use it for breakfast on my yogurt and a few chunks after lunch, as the carbs are very high.

I make this constantly for my husband who loves it for breakfast as well as a snack at work.  I have had some issues with clumping, but discovered it had a lot to do with how I was mixing the ingredients together, as well as the tendency for my cheaper pans to warp- fortunately have fixed this issue, and it continues to make my husband very happy in the morning!

Great!  I don't think I will ever buy a box of granola cereal again.  I did make half the recipe and it is still a lot.  Thanks for sharing.  I didn't have veg. oil so used canola instead.  Brought to a cottage for a long weekend and everyone there loved it!

This stuff is amazing!!! I love granola and have never tried making my own.  I tried this and really like it and its easy!  Next time though, I'm going to leave out the brown sugar because I think it can afford to lose some of its sweetness to keep it healthy.  I also added milled flax seed after I took it out of the oven so it wouldn't lose it's nutrition benefits.  I'm not going to add the dried fruit because I like it plain.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Use Old Fashion Oats instead of rolled oats for more whole grains. Buy nuts in bulk, and measure nuts, bran, & germ into quart canning jars and store in the 'fridge. When I want to make more, just have to pull out a jar, measure the oats and make the syrup- super easy.

This is my first time making granola and it's soooo good!  Instead of pecans and walnuts I used 1.5 cups golden flax seed and 1.5 cups raw pumpkin seeds (pepitas).  The flax seed gives it a good crunch.  Yum!

Wow, this is amazing! It tastes great, makes a bunch and is easy to make and customize for one's personal preferences. For me, I used 1/2 c canola oil and 1/2 c. applesauce, added 1/2 cup flax seed and used almond extract instead of vanilla for a different taste and baked it for 21 minutes at 300 and it turned out perfectly. Buying all of the ingredients upfront was a bit of an investment but in the long run, will pay off and if you're like me, I've never found the "perfect" granola in the store for me, but now I've got the recipe that will change that forever!

Awesome granola recipe!  The recipe is great as is, but I prefer to use coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil and I usually add flax seed.  The honey, maple, and cinnamon flavors blend together wonderfully!  I've been making a batch almost weekly for our family.

awesome! shared this with my neighbor after her picky kids gobbled it down when my little ones brought it over. I skipped the wheat and oat germ as I didn't have it, added grapeseed oil instead of the vegetable oil, skipped the pecans and subbed with Brazil nuts. Added other dried fruit but WONDERFUL! Going to make another batch right now. Going to try using 1/2 cup applesauce with 1/2 cup oil to cut down on fat. Ohhhh, and I added flax and pumpkin seeds too!

Try adding some fresh ground cardamom (look in the bulk spice section for incredible savings over the stuff in a jar...) for an added spicy zest!

I LOVE this recipe! I didn't have wheat germ or oat bran in my house so i replaced them with chopped cashews, peanuts and shredded coconut. And after baking, I add dried cranberries, dried cherries, dried blueberries and dried apricot. It's so yummy and so healthy!

This is wonderful granola. We eat it everyday with yogurt, my kids love it.  It is very versatile, I've made it with different nuts and fruits, sometimes I add applesauce in place of some of the oil and the results are always yummy.  This time I added dried plums, ok prunes, to the mixture before I put it inthe oven. Very good, the prunes were coated all over with the oat bran. You'll need a big bowl to mix this in and plenty of containers for storage. I generally make half the recipe because it fits nicely in my cereal storage container.

Great granola! I halved the recipe...and added some shredded coconut. I also kept the cinnamon and vanilla amounts as written.....lots of flavor. I did decrease the oil big time....to 2 tblspns total......I think that is more than enough...I couldnt imagine a whole cup of oil in something that is supposed to be pretty healthy for you.....It is delicious and crunchy. Will make again!

Awesome Recipe, I reduced the amount of sugar/syrup/honey to 1/2 cup and took the suggestion of someone else and replaced half the oil with apple sauce.  I also used Canola oil instead of vegetable oil.

This is better than any cereal you can buy in the store.  Plus, YOU have control over what goes into it! Modifications we made were, 1/2 cup ground flax was added.  Coconut and olive oil were used instead of vegetable oil, and we added in a cup of date pellets.  We are looking forward to trying dried coconut and some other ingredients next time. As another reviewer said, if you have never made granola before, you need more instructions.  The ingredients get crispy as they COOL.  I too kept my granola in the oven, expecting it to get hard in there, and it didn't.  It still turned out well, but probably a little over cooked.  Also, It dried into one big container shaped rock, so let it cool before you poor it into your container.

This is the BESTEST granola recipe. We add scoops of fiber powder and protein powder and use flax meal, too.  Turned out GREAT!  You can use Agave instead of Honey for a healthier version.

This is the best homemade granola I've ever eaten!  It was a little pricey for the ingredients, but it makes  a LOT of granola...I didn't want to pay $7 for maple syrup so I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1 cup of honey to make up for it.  Absolutely delicious, hard to stop eating it!

Love it! This is usually made after X-mas because of all the gift nuts on hand. I do not prefer to add the dried fruit but I will throw in some mini chocolate chips to please my son. I also use whatever nuts I have available. Goes great on yogurt & ice cream.

Wow! Good recipie! I love it! I am a celiac member & have bought my granolas for a very expensive cost but no longer! I revised the recipie to suit my dietary needs: instread of oats, replace with brown rice flakes (found at most health food stores); I omited the wheat germ replacing it with crushed flax seeds; I halved the oat bran but could replace with rice bran if needed; instead of sunflower seeds I did millet meal (a nutty crunchy flavor--yummy!); and because I found it too sweet with the brown sugar and the syrup (plus, I need to restrict sugar intake) I did all honey; for the vegtable oil I did the heart friendly olive oil; and instead of all cinnamon, I love the spiciness of nutmeg and did half and half.

This is an excellent granola recipe.  Like most people who have tried the recipe, I changed it up a bit.  I cut back on the wheat germ and used 1 cup;  I didn't use oat bran, I used wheat bran but cut back to 3/4 cup.  I left out the pecans and put in approx. 3/4 cup of almonds and 1/2 cup of walnuts. I didn't add the maple syrup; I used about 3/4 cup of honey and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I used about 3/4 cup of canola oil and 4 tablespoons of virgin coconut oil. I added about 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. And then I added dried blueberries and cranberries but put in about 1 1/4 cup with the mixture of both berries.  I don't like granola too sweet and I like just some fruit but not a lot.  I like the oat/wheat flavor to stand out, which it does in my version (not to say the original version doesn't).  Finally I baked it at 250 for 30 minutes.  Every 10 minutes I kept turning it over for even baking.   Super yummy.

This was the best granola I have ever tasted!!! I's even better than the store brand and MUCH healthier. I made a few changes based on what I had on hand at the time. I completely took out the wheat germ and oatbrand and just substituted 2 cups of Grape Nuts cereal. You must be careful because the grapenut brown pretty quickly so just keep an eye on them. My oven is completely recked and the temp goes up to at least 400 degree F even if I just put it on "Warm" or 200F. My granola was slightly burnt due to this unfortunate situation but I knew the risks before I put it in the extremely hot oven, lol. Even burnt it was GREAT. I eat it with yogurt or just put a bunch in a plastic sandwich bag and snack on it throughout the day. I will guard this recipe with my life and never lose it!!! It's that good!! Thank you so much for sharing!! =).

The major problem with this recipe was the cinnamon, which was overwhelming.  If I ever made it again, I would cut the cinnamon to no more than half a teaspoon.  I like a hint, but this was overwhelming. But I liked the oat bran, which I don't usually add to my standard granola (which I only flavor with honey, and is wonderful).

excellent! the only thing I would do differently next time is cook it a little longer. I did cut down the sugars as others have recommended, just for nutritional reasons. I also didn't put the fruit in it b/c I prefer granola without fruit. You can always add it later anyway.

Alright ladies, I went ahead and tried out this recipe with olive oil. Still delicious! So my opinion is that if you want the added health benefit, go for it because the olive oil flavor isn't obvious AT ALL so unless you have really sensitive taste buds.  I made the recipe with what I had in the house so no oat bran (doubled the wheat germ), no walnuts, no molasses, added cranberries, added chopped prunes, added raisins, added 1 TBS vanilla extract, and 1 TSP almond extract.  I baked in the oven for 30 min at 300 (to dry it out) and then 12 minutes at 350 (to toast it). And don't just turn on the timer and leave: take it out every 10 minutes and give the granola a turn! Also, like another reviewer mentioned, don't be alarmed if your granola is soft after coming out of the oven ... it hardens as it cools!

Very versatile. Not sure if anyone has written this but adding sesame seeds gives it a fantastic flavour! I toasted mine with the other nuts (added pumpkin seeds too). I only make half the recipe and use more pure maple syrup than honey and it fills a cookie sheet.

This is Fantastic. We use is all the time now and won't consider buying box granola ever again. The recipe works great as is, but we add whatever dried fruit on hand (apricots, blueberries) and I have found flavored honey adds a nice twist. Enjoy!

Super easy and super delicious. I had a hard time waiting for it to cool down enough to eat! I found half of this recipe plenty for me.  I made one change: while the syrup was heating up, I put 1C of flaked coconut into the pan the granola was going to bake in, and toasted that in the oven for about 4 minutes. Then I put that back in with the dry ingredients, and put the syrup over everything. It turned out to be a nice addition.  One tip: use a really big bowl to mix everything!

Yum! I only had pecans so I chopped up about 2 cups worth for a half recipe.  I also put in extra cinnamon.  It is yummy to munch on right out of the bag or with yogart or milk like cereal.

This is by far the best granola ever!!!  I made the batch and took some to work.  Everyone was asking for some.  I'm going to make a double back next time so that I have enough to last longer than a couple days.  I ate it with milk like cereal, but liked it better mixed in with vanilla yogurt.  I couldn't get enough.  I bet it would be great made into chewy granola bars as well.

Everyone loved it.  Very wholesome.  Only downside is it goes away fast!  I didn't include sunflower seeds or raisins because I'm a little bit purist about granola...

Very soft and chewy granola, if cooked for the alotted time.  Should cut down on the oil a little bit, though, it can get away with about 2/3 cups of oil instead of the 1 cup it calls for.  Wonderful backpacking food though.  Too many calories for eating at home though.

Best granola ever! I use less oil and do not add fruits or nuts as hubby doesn't like them. I add them to my own later this way everyone can tailor their granola to their liking.

There is way too much rolled oats in this recipe.  I barely got the entire batch coated with the sauce.

very good and versatile- i didn't have wheat germ or bran but increased my oats.  i cut the sugar for everything, but don't do that here!  20 min left the granola too chewy for my taste, so i cooked it another 20 min.  great starting point, to add whatever nuts, etc. that you want. if you really like raisins, i suggest increasing to 3 cups :)

Yum!  I used dried cherries, dried blueberries and chopped toasted pecans for my additions.  This recipe has great "bones" and can be adapted many ways.  I have to say it's expensive to make -spend $30 to get $20 of granola - but I love knowing exactly what's in it and it's more importantly, what's NOT!  Regardless, I would say the price is competitive with high end store-bought.  It also freezes well.

Tastes great! However, I have made granola with WAY less oil and sugar and it still has great taste without all the calories. I also added flax seed.

This was great!  I made it today.  I followed the recipe with a few exceptions.  I used flax meal for the wheat germ since we are allergic to wheat.  I replaced the walnuts with cashews.  I didn't have maple syrup, so I used a bit more honey and I used 1 cup of brown sugar.  After it was done baking, I pressed it into the pan while it cooled.  This gave me some great clumps!  I think next time I might add some pecan halves as well as the finely chopped pecans.  My son, who is SUCH a picky eater and hates nuts really likes it!  Yay!

Made this with a few tweeks like everyone else.  Combination of what you have on hand and what your tastes are. Flax Seed is necessary to me.  Cooked it much longer than recipe (didn't read the reviews). But this is very forgiving.  Good flavor.  Not too sweet. Absolutely amazing!

Be careful not to over cook.  It isn't crunchy straight out of the oven, but it crips up as it cools.  I made about 1/4 of a batch just to see how it would turn out and it was really good.  However 20 min was actually a little bit too long for this reduced amount of granola - it was a little burned but still tasty.  I also added the craisins and some shredded coconut a few minutes before baking was complete.

I'm happy with it.  Definitely be careful about burning. Don't let it turn brown.  Just cook according to the directions and then take it out, even if it seems soft.  It will harden as it cools.  My preference is that the honey-nut taste was a bit strong.  Next time I will use half the nuts, no honey, and add sweetened coconut with coconut oil in place of veg. oil.  I also subbed ground flax for the oat bran.  I figured there were already enough oats and wanted to add the healthy flax. Though a 1:1 sub was a bit much.  Maybe next time i'll only add half the flax so it won't leave little flecks in the bottom of my bowl :)  I also didn't add raisins to the whole batch I add them in later as needed.  Sometimes I do fresh fruit instead of raisins.

This is a wonderful recipe. After finish baking, I added 2 orange zest and the family liked it better. Also, I want it less starch, more fiber,more protein. My variation. oats          - 8 cups flax seed meal- 3 cups sunflower seed - 3 cups walnuts        - 7 cups wheat germ     - 3 cups wheat flakes   - 3 cups. Then I double the wet ingredients. I mixed both wet and dry in a bowel (I tried pouring over the baking pan method and I found it messy and slow). I compact it down and baked it and turn it over once. I've got a lot of big chunks!!!

Wonderful! The great thing about this recipe is how forgiving it is--exchange ingredients and it still wins :) I used milled flaxseed in place of oat bran, and added chocolate chips (before baking, so they'd melt a bit). The result is tasty! Thanks, Megan!

I really love this granola! I made a few changes just because I didn't have all the ingredients. Used the amounts called for for oats, wheat germ, walnuts, almonds, oil,brown sugar and salt but olitted the maple syrup (didn't have any) and instead used 1 cp honey. I also used 1 tbs cinnamon and 1 tbs vanilla. Baked at 300 for about 30-35 min stirring every 8-10 min so it wouldn't burn and it turned out fabulous! After granola cooled I added a combo of dried cherries, blueberries and raspberries. I will definitely make this again!

Best granola recipe we've tried!  We use it as cereal in the morning or to make fruit and yogurt parfaits for a yummy treat.  Can be adjusted to suit your taste.

I made this granola on monday night.  It was great.  I just tweaked it a little bit.  We don't like too much sugar so I just didn't add the brown sugar.  this was so easy to make and much less expensive than whole foods.

Fantastic! I followed the advice of some reviewers and replaced half the oil with applesauce to make it lighter. I baked it at 300 deg for about 45 minutes. I used a roasting pan so the mixture was a couple inches deep in the pan but it worked out fine. I set a timer and stirred it while it baked, about every 15 minutes. It's delicious! WAY better than any store bought granola I've ever had, and even better than the very expensive stuff handmade stuff I get at the local farmer's market. The only problem is that I have become addicted to the granola and I eat too much of it!

YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is SOOOOOO good!!!  The only thing I did different was omit the maple syrup (didn't have any...just added more honey instead) and I'll do it the same way next time.  I baked it for 30 minutes, which was perfect for me because I LOVE crisp/toasted granola.  Next time I will add the raisins right away and clump the granola into clusters which I prefer over loose granola.  Excellent recipe though.  Thank you!!

This is awesome and versatile.  I add whatever dried fruit I feel like.  I have also added ground flax seed.  My kids, both teens, love this stuff, and I know its healthy because I made it myself.  I use honey and molasses to sweeten, and its great. Thanks for this great recipe!

This was an excellent granola!!  My husband took some to work and his coworkers are demanding that I make more.  Another thing I loved about making this is that the kids could help me stir it all together- and after it's all done we use it as a breakfast cereal!

Took Ggrasley advice: "I do like cooking it on convection at 200 for about 50 min. It takes three cookie sheets and with convection and/or a low temp you don't have to fear burning the granola." 

Contributer note: There is a slight mistake on the recipe. My original calls for 1 Tablespoon (not teaspoon) of cinnamon and 1 Tablespoon of vanilla. 

Use 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil for healthier blend.

Great basic recipe.  I use only oats and not the other grains (what I had on hand).  I made 1/2 batch and cooked it in my crock pot, stirring occasionally, then setting it out too cool and "harden".  That worked great and I did not have any burt granola!  I have made this several times with different dried fruits and nuts.  It is always yummy!

I made this in a crockpot. I halfed the recipe and used a 4.5 quart crockpot on high for about 3.5 hours. I put in all the dry ingredients and then the wet and mixed well. I then vented the lid with a chopstick and stirred every once in a while. No risk of burning and it turned out awesome. It's a good cereal type granola, not trail mix type with large clumps. I also traded melted butter for the oil.

This is exceptional. I have made it many times and shared. Everyone always likes it. Each time I make is different. The modification of 1 tablespoon of vanilla and cinnamon (instead of teaspoon) makes this even better. Thank you for the recipe.

This was my first time making Granola. It was excellent! I used 1Tbsp Vanilla and cinnamon as one of the reviews said there was an error.I baked at 300 for 40-45 min.I only wished it was a little chunkier. Maybe letting it cool before stirring? Definitley try this one!

My friend used to make granola from memory. After she moved I had to find my own recipe.  This one is great!  I only add walnuts, and a variety of dried fruits(raisins, chopped apricots, apples, coconut, and broken up banana chips for extra crunch.  I also baked it at 300 degrees.

This is my first attempt at making granola.  I think it was awsome!  The advice of others to watch it carefully is right on, I kept my timer on and watched it, and I still burned some of it, which is such a waste of time and ingredients.  I've been having it in the morning with vanilla soy milk, excellent!!!

Yum!   This was great.  I left out the brown sugar and it was still nicely sweet.  I subbed the oil for coconut oil as another reviewer suggested with great results!  Will make again, thanks.

Thanks for an excellent granola recipe!  You have laid the foundation with your basic recipe and it's up to the cook to add or subtract other ingredients to their liking.  I've experimented with different kinds of dried fruits, and also different nuts (I'm not a huge walnut fan but like pecans).  I agree with others who suggest cutting the amount of sunflower seeds by half, and I've also reduced the sweeteners some (3/4 c of honey was a bit too much).  I use a teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon - not a tablespoon - and it's perfect.  The only other suggestion is to let it bake longer.  Twenty minutes didn't "crisp up" the granola enough so the second batch I baked for 40 minutes in 350 degrees and it was amazing.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will never buy store bought granola again!!

Wow this is awesome!  This is my first *attempt* to make granola and it went well.

I used the following changes as I am a bit crazy when it comes to nutrition:
1. Used apple sauce instead of oil.
2. Used sugar free syrup.
3. Used Splenda brown sugar.
4. Used 1/2 c flax seed also.

I only had wheat germ so doubled that in place of allbran as others suggested, only used peanuts as my boyfriend dislikes the others. 

This is a bit damp (maybe I didn't bake it long enough?) but it is still delicious on top of cottage cheese, yogurt, etc.

Thank you!

Note: due to taste preferences, I now omit the berries and, despite it's lack of sweetness now, it is still awesome.

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of an extra 10 minutes' baking time. Initially the granola was perfect, but after a few hours it lost its crunch and was kind of "damp," for lack of a better word. The flavor was very nice but the texture ruined it.

I can't stop snacking on this!  It is so good and my husbanc absolutely loves it.  He's usually not the granola type, but he loves it enough to mix it in with his daily cornflakes...which is saying something.  I added pecans, almonds, and soy nuts.  Be sure to take the granola out on time and not till you "think" it is done.  Otherwise it will burn while cooling down.

Oh my my, this is wonderful!  Even before it was cooked I couldnt stop eating it!  Listened to other reviewers and only left the granola in for the time recommended even though it didn't appear done.  It crunches up as it cools and is absolutely fabulous!

This granola was so easy and fun to make! A little of this, and a little of that. Used Grapeseed oil for the added health benefits. Omitted honey. If you are out of milk try wetting it down with apple juice.

We have made this three times now.  Usually my 14 yo makes it for us.  We half the recipe, use canola oil, 1/2 wheat germ and 1/2 ground flax seed.  We have varied the type of nuts we use.  Do not use oat bran, just increase the rolled oats.  Last time I threw in a little wheat germ and no one noticed.  The whole family eats this as a handy snack, on yogurt, or mixed in regular cereal.

This is the first time I have made granola.  I will definitely do it again.  I only gave four stars because I didn't think that the time in the oven was correct.  The directions weren't very "stupid" friendly either ;o)  Granola is one of the only things I have never made at home.  It did turn out pretty well other than the one tray overcooking.  Will try again soon!  The only changes I made were to substitute wheat bran for the oat bran, I added 1/4 cup flax seeds, left out the brown sugar completely and put the cranberries instead of raisins.  I am looking forward to trying it out properly in the morning.

Loved this!  Even the kids will eat it for breakfast with milk.  Made it as written except I added more cranberries and added more almonds to make up for not having walnuts in the house.  I also added some almond extract (I love the cranberry-almond combo).  I did cook an additional 10 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes to prevent browning around the edge to the pan.  Great on top of plain or vanilla yogurt.  I also used it as a topping for cranberry-almond tea bread, spinkling it on top of the batter before cooking and covering loosely with foil about 1/2 way through cooking.

Delicious!  Even my dh who doesn't typically like granola ate this every morning until it was gone!  (and my three year old was just as enthusiastic).  It did take longer than the directions stated to get nice and crispy though, just remove from the oven, mix and check every 5 -10 min after the stated time.  Oh, and I halfed the recipe and it still made tons of granola.

My daughter fixed this recipe and I wasn't watching her...mixing all the ingredients instead of boiling the syrups.

The bottom and ends burned, but what didn't burn tasted fabulous.

I have made this twice now and WOW!
We were on vacation in August and purchased homemade granola at a fair.  When I arrived back home I decided to search for a recipe.  This is the best!
I did use others suggestions of increasing the oats, using flax and wheat germ. I also add unsweetened coconut and omitted the walnuts but increased the other nuts.

Loved the flavor as a cereal!  I might have overcooked mine a tad, but it just gave it a nutty flavor in milk.  I halved the recipe (didn't want to waste a lot of ingredients if it didn't work).  I diced a couple of apples and set them in the hot sun to dry out during the day and then added them along with raisins.  It was delicious!

Great recipe. I have tried many granola recipes and this is my favorite. I make it without the pecans and doubled the almonds instead, simply because I didn't have pecans.

This recipe was great!  I love this granola, however I did switch up the recipe in one way.  Instead of pecans I put in raw pumpkin seeds. But overall great recipe, my family kept picking at the cooling granola everytime they came into the kitchen.

This is a great recipe.  I made half a batch and it still filled a large container.  The only changes I made - skipped the sunflower seeds, didn't have the maple syrup so I used 1/2 cup of honey, doubled the cinnamon and vanilla, used half the amount of raisins, and added a 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips.  I had to cook the granola for almost double the amount of time listed though.  Very good.

WONDERFUL! I tweeked it along with "Ultimate Irresitable Granola" Both are fab! I used the "Splenda" br. sugar - 1/4 cup - and 1 cup honey. Also cut back 1/2cup on the wheat germ and oat bran for 1 cup flax seed that I ground. Instead of sunflowers seeds I used pumpkin seeds.  This is so healthy - just got to remember all the carbs. and calories! :(

So good!  I did choose to ad pumpkin seeds and did not chop the other nuts as finely as the recipes requests simply for my taste preference.  This does make a HUGE batch.  I would consider scaling it down if you won't eat a whole lot of it.

this is a very good cereal, but I was looking for a chewy, more snack like,  variety.  I have no idea what I need to look for so I am gonna keep looking.  but this is a wonderful cereal and I am very much enjoying it.

I only wish that there were such a thing as six stars for favorite recipes!  This is our new fave for sure.  In fact, I think we are all fighting for who will get to it first!  Easy to modify for personal taste.  Perfect chewy consistency.  I did not use oat bran or walnuts or pecans, but added extra almonds and I throw in a few dried cherries when I eat it as cereal.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  I will keep these ingredients on hand so it can be made every time I run out.

Fantastic!  Not too sweet, not too nutty.  Perfect.  I added dried fruit and 3/4 cup of shredded coconut.  I am at a high altitude and the wet ingredients didn't quite cover the dry.  I saved the dry stuff in a bag for next time I make the granola.

when measuring wet ingredients, measure sugar first, then oil so the honey and syrup won't stick to the measuring cup.

We like this. we made it. we put in 6 table spoons of walnuts. and we didn't put as much honey as the recipe said, because the last time we         made it , it had to much honey. before we cooked it we pressed down the granola with our hands, to make it clump up. we didn't put any raisins or cranberries in. instead we let our family chose what to put in their granola after we cooked it: raisins, cranberries, banana chips, blueberries, etc. thanks

A five+ recipe! I halved the recipe and can’t wait to try again. I used nuts on hand and subbed pistachios for the pecans. Some folks commented that ingredients were pricey but I used store brand oats, dried fruit bought at Trader Joe’s (affordable and perfect portion) and bought the oat bran and wheat germ at a bulk food store. I used two pans for my halved recipe, set timer for 10 minutes and changed rack positions and baked for an  additional 10 minutes. I stirred up the one pan that got darker and let the lighter one sit undisturbed to cool. That pan was chunkier. Thank you for submitting. This is the only recipe I’ll use!

made half a recipe, plenty for the two of us.  it was easy and excellent!  as others have said, choose your nuts, choose your bran, and swap sugar and honey ratios, the recipe is very flexible.  thank you so much!

I omit the oil.  You don't need it.  All the oil does is add fat to the recipe.  The granola is nice and crunchy!

This is my favorite granola recipe! We love chunky texture. (I only stir it at the 10min mark and then press it back down in the pan. Then leave it alone until it is cool.) Our family is salt free so as is, I can taste too much salt. Easily fixed by using half. I also use grape seed oil instead. I love how that adds a buttery flavor. This is good as a cereal, trail mix, or on yogurt. You can also switch up your dry ingredients to taste. We make it about once a week because it disappears so fast!

I will make this again and again,  maybe mix up the dried fruit. It  also makes a great gift , I bought an air tight container from Kitchen Kapers with a small scoop,  the recepients were thrilled and everyone asked for the recipe.

This granola is delish and easy to make. I substituted the nuts  (except the almonds) for unsweetened coconut and, ground flax seed and extra oats. I also used coconut oil. After reading about the difficulty with baking/burning - I decided to use convection at 200 degrees for 50 minutes and it turned out perfectly. I will make this again!

I have been using this recipe for maybe 8 years or more.  I  use it as a base as I don't always have all the ingredients.  I usually quadruple or sextuple  the recipe  as we go through a lot of it and it stores beautifully (I buy oatmeal in 25lb bags).  My main add in substitutions are raisins, coconut flakes and pumpkin seeds.

This is the best granola recipe I've found. My husband loves to  coat a massive amount of granola over his ice cream as a nightly dessert.  I added 1 cup of coconut flakes  and date bits when I stirred in the cranberries.

I left out wheat bran because I have celiac disease. We added dried blueberries and have added other dried fruits on different occasions. Sometimes I'll add nutmeg too. 
We've also substituted agave for the honey to make it vegan for our began friends. Still great!

To accommodate food sensitivities in our family I substituted flax meal for the wheat germ and pumpkin seeds for sunflower seeds.  Used only almonds and cashews (that's what I had on hand) and dried cranberries.  Very pleased with the results.

Delicious! I halved the recipe to try it out, and glad I did; not sure the full recipe would have toasted up as well as the two baking sheets would’ve been much more full. I used ground flax seed in place of the germ, which I don’t keep around. Worked really well!

This our favorite granola! We mix and match what is available from the local farmers market. Living in Costa Rica, we don't always have all the seeds and grains in the recipe but it always turns out great. Enjoy. Pura Vida!

My initial concern was that recipe was too large, so I halved it. But it was a so delicious, it goes fast and I’ll be making it again and again. I left it in the oven at 325 for about 45 minutes to get it crunchier, but did pull it out to toss and check it twice.

I wanted to try a different granola recipe from the ones I usually make so I tried this one and oh my goodness! So good! I halved the recipe and it made a ton! It’s really pretty looking too, so it’s perfect for gifts. I added craisins and coconut when it had about 10 mins left to bake and it turned out amazing. Definitely will be my go to recipe from now on. Xo

My family loves this recipe. I have to make a batch at least once a month. Nuts and fruits vary but one thing I add is four cups of crisped rice. This adds volume and a yummy crunch

This is one of the first times I’ve made granola in my many years of cooking and baking. Recipe was easy to follow. I did substitute some coconut oil for some of the vegetable oil. And I turned my temperature down to about 300. I did not stir it so its a little bit chunky - I like it that way. Turned out wonderful. Added dried apricots and dried dates. And shared with a friend, wonderful!!

Outstanding! Love it! Goodbye commercial cereal.
Today I made it for the 4th time. It turned out the best ever. The modifications I made to it: Split the ingredients in half to accommodate the equipment I have increased the maple syrup, eliminated the honey. Added Flax seed and dried berries. This time I hand-stirred it to allow it t0 be more flakey. Perfecto!

I did adjust the ingredients a little bit, left out the wheat germ as I didn't have any, left out the pecans and walnuts, and added pumpkin seeds, etc.  This recipe is flexible enough that you can easily do that.  The real value of this recipe is in the syrup, which was very good.  I even ended up with a few clumps, as some people indicated they liked.

I did forget to add the dried fruit after it came out of the oven, so they were a little chewier, but still really good.  It also took a lot longer to bake, even using 2 half sheet pans.  This makes a ton.

Loved this granola...and love that you can make lots of modifications to it to "change it up" depending on your mood, ingredients on hand, etc. This past time, I did not boil the wet ingredients beforehand but mixed them in together and mixed the granola about every 15 minutes, cooking it about 40-45 minutes at 300 degrees and then 325 for the last 10 minutes or so. Putting it on parchment paper made sure that it didn't stick to the bottom. I also used less maple syrup and no honey but i think next time I might put a few TBSLP of honey in since I like that taste and it also helps the granola stick a bit more together. We have used multiple combinations of nuts and all work well. I love using almonds, cashews, soy nuts and sunflower seeds.  We often put the granola over yogurt (with or without fresh fruit like bananas, strawberries or blueberries) or with other dried fruit and sometimes other cereal, like mini shredded wheat. Thanks for this great recipe!

Very good! I make the liquid part according to the directions, but I change the nuts I use depending on what I have on hand. I also have added coconut, peanut butter, chocolate chips, peanut butter chips. The possibilities are endless!

Delicious granola! When I first made this, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. Over the years, I started flinging in the ingredients without measuring at all, based on what I have on hand. It’s always good!

I'm currently on a granola kick, but I'm  also gluten-free, so the wheat germ in this recipe wasn't something I could add. It was fine without it.  The mistake I made was not patting it down enough before baking, so it didn't clump together as much as I would have liked, but the flavor is good.  Kind of wish I would have made just half the recipe.

Added chocolate chips at same time as cranberries. Took half of granola, put it in a freezer bag and put in freezer. Took it out a few weeks later and just as good as first made.

I didn't have all the ingredients so I improvised. I didn't have oat bran or wheat germ so I increased the oats some and added 1 cup of flaxseed. The kids won't eat pecans or walnuts so I left those out. I also cut back the oil to 3/4 cup and cinnamon and vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp each.  It is so delicious I am snacking on it now! Not really sweet, just right. I love that this recipe seems so versatile!

I made this recipe as written for part of a bridal brunch, it was excellent.  The second time I made it (different oven) it wasn't as crunchy, so my only comment would be to make sure that it is starting to brown nicely before removing it from the oven if you want crunch granola.

I made and it's amazing! My only change is I substituted the vegetable oil for coconut oil, added slivered almonds and instead of oat bran, I used the bran cereal. It makes a lot and I've shared it with my daughters & sister and they all loved it, too! I will be making it again when my supply gets low!

Great recipe!. I accidentally omitted the brown sugar and it was not missed.  Used 1/8 cup maple syrup and 1/8 cup light corn syrup.  Did not add sunflower seeds as I do not like them.  
Note: it gets crispier after it cools.  Thank you!!!

I will make it again for sure. I did not put the cinnamon into the boiling oil/sugar. Added more ground cinnamon after it cooled and will look for vanilla powder to do the same next time. Adding the spices and extracts to the boiled oil/sugar boils out the taste of the extract to some degree.

First time baking granola and now I am addicted!  I compared other recipes and this seemed to be the best and healthiest. 
 Used 1 1/2 cups pecans and almonds and didn't add the walnuts. Added cococut for the last 10 minutes of baking. Also used cococut oil instead of vegetable oil.    Very yummy. Can't wait to try different combinations of fruit and nuts.

I have a wheat allergy so most prepared granola is off limits. By substituting oat bran for the wheat germ and wheat bran I was able to make granola wheat free. I don't know if it is as good as the original, but I can't imagine that it could taste much better. Thank you for this recipe, I will make it over and over.

I loved this recipe!  I particularly enjoyed the amount of nuts that it contained! :)  I did not use the maple syrup and the honey (because I did not have any at the time) and found that it was sweet enough with the sugar that it contained.  My daughter loves it!  I definitely plan to try it again.

I followed recipe & put cut up dried apricots with cranberries & added some pumpkin seeds, and a handful of coconut as well.  Took a little longer to cook. But it is great.  Decided to make because  McDonald's went up on their yogurt & granola treat.  Now almost $2.00 here.  So now I get yogurt at the store & add as much of this as I want, and I have eaten as a granola cereal as well.  Very filling and taste so great.

I've made this recipe loads of times, all the times omitting the nuts because of allergies in my house. This recipe was my go to recipe for  a daycare I cooked for. I made it with raisins and leftover cereals or I would make it with coconut and cranberries for a different flavor.  Hell, you can even make it in chocolate if you take out a nut and add coconut . It becomes a chocolate coconut bar!!!

Very good recipe. It makes a huge batch, it’s nust 2 of us, could have halved it and it still would have great.  It is versatile and I’d change it up as I remake it. I could that the fruit didn’t really clump as well as the granola, which kind of separated it from each bite. Would love to figure out how better to make clusters. The honey flavor intensifies after a few days, which as nice. I am hypoglycemic and did NOT find this to be overly sweet, just right!

I didn't have the wheat germ, bran or walnuts. I used grape seed oil and doubled on the pecans.  Otherwise I used all the other ingredients and I must say, it was perfect! It was my first time making granola and I would do it again!

I have been baking this granola for about a year.  I vary the ingredients depending upon what I have.  The oats I always increase to four cups.  Then I add sunflower seeds (2 C), walnuts (2 C chopped into small pieces), flax seed (2 C), wheatgerm (1 C) and then throw in whatever bits of other nuts I may have in the pantry that I think need to be used up.  I keep sugar, honey and maple syrup volumes the same.  I add twice the vanilla, lots of cinnamon and also some powdered ginger.  Any raisins, dry cranberries or dry blueberries I add either at the end of baking or after the pan comes out while the granola is still warm and will soften them. ONE TIP ON BAKING:  STIR EVERY 8-10 MINUTES to keep it from burning!  Really turn it over and mix well each time because the liquids will go to the bottom.  I also use a Syl-Pad in the bottom of the baking pan to keep ingredients from burning. YOU CANNOT put this in the oven and stir just the once!!  I BAKE IT FOR AN HOUR, TURNING FREQUENTLY OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT GET CRUNCHY. I don't like soggy granola.  After it cools completely, store it in either ziplock bags or a tight container to keep it crunchy. 
Have fun!

This is the best granola recipe I have ever tried!  I have been making it for over a year now.  I find that if I keep the proportions right, I can make substitutions.  For example, I will use flax seed meal instead of wheat germ or wheat bran in place of oat bran.  It always comes out delicious!

I love this recipe and have made it for a few years. I double the cinnamon and I bake it at 300 degrees in thinner layers so it’s crispy. I also have added ground flax seed, hemp seeds and chia seeds. Yummy!

Very good granola. I did add some cinnamon and vanilla.  Sweetness tastes good, but makes me feel guilty.  Might want to cut down of sweetness.

My daughter has turned vegetarian at 15 yrs of age and I am concerned about the amount of proteins she is getting.  I'm trying to offer her free choice healthy options she can't resist.
This was a great recipe I'm keeping for sure.  I went low and slow on the toasting at 280 degrees, with convection.  So time it took to toast just right was 40-50 minutes.  Every 10 minutes I stirred the mix and switched pans from top to bottom of the oven.  
I used organic virgin coconut oil, I switched the measurements for brown sugar and maple syrup and I think the mix comes out nice and dry and not sticky.
I also added 1 cup raw shaved coconut and threw in pumpkin, chia and flax seeds, just a half cup each.  Great recipe, this is gonna make great Christmas gifts.

Great recipe. Dropped the sugar content (honey, maple and brown sugar) by about half, as dried fruit also adds sweetness. Increased range of nuts (pumpkin, sunflower, peanut and walnut) plus chia seeds. Added the coconut threads too.  Favourite fruit has been Gojo berries, cranberries and/or raisans and occasionally dried apricots. Now a staple breakfast for family as very filling and sustains for the day. Plenty of fibre, nuts etc, so great for the system.

I personally like granola with more chunks.  Because there wasn't much topping on the dry ingredients, you end up with mostly small individual pieces (think blizzard of oats).  This went soggy really fast and didn't care that much for the taste; my husband won't touch it so I'm getting to eat it all myself.

Followed some of the guidelines for cooking - cooked slow (225 degrees) for about 40 minutes and then upped the temp to 300 degrees for 10 minutes to add a bit more crunch to the mix.

I decided to try this recipe because my elderly mother can no longer cook breakfast because she was forgetting to turn off the stove and nearly caused a fire. So I wanted her to have something nutritious, that  didn't require cooking. She absolutely loved it and has been eating it every day since I gave it to her. I also gave some to my two sisters and they said it's the best granola they've had. I love that it makes a lot since I enjoy sharing my goods to my elderly family members. I did make a slight change.  I didn't have oat bran or wheat germ on hand so I used finely shredded coconut and a little more raw sunflower seeds. I also used a mix of dried cranberries, blueberries and cherries. (Our grocery store sells the mix already bagged). It turned out fabulous! Thank you for a great recipe. I'm making it again, at this very moment, since I gave the first batch away and didn't keep any for myself. Side note: My oven cooks true to temperature, but it took 10 minutes longer than called for and I read on another review that their's burned completely. Ovens and altitude affect cooking/baking, so my advise, just keep watching it and you'll know it's ready when it's golden brown.

This recipe did not disappoint. Very tasty and easy to make once you have all the ingredients. The first time I overcrowded the baking sheets and ended up needing way more baking time (which resulted in burning one sheet full). Second time around, I just baked in batches. I got 4 cookie sheets full. The granola cooked much more evenly this way. I found my ceramic baking sheet needed a few extra minutes but the metal one was perfect at 20 minutes at 325. For first timers, know that it won't be crispy when it's done in the oven. It will crisp up as it cools. Just look for the golden brown color to know that it's done. We leave the cranberries out and add it in the morning with yogurt or any other toppings we like (fresh strawberries are yummy with it!). Each person can customize every day! We store in large air tight containers and enjoy one batch for several weeks. Yum!

YUM! This was delicious! I did make lots of substitutions but I mostly needed this for ratios and cook times. I used coconut oil,  pumpkins seeds, sunflower seeds, pecans, and also blended up oats for the oat bran because I didn't have any. And also I used flaked coconut for wheat germ because I was out but wanted something that has a close texture (and amazing flavor). I also omitted the cinnamon, as I am not a huge fan of it in my granola. I think it limits the kind of yogurt you should eat it with... strawberry cinnamon?? Ew. 
Anyways, this was SO good! I am SO glad I found this recipe! And I am glad I read the review about not stirring it until it cools completely for more chunk.
I totally recommend this recipe!

I hate cereal and I love this recipe. It keeps well in a tight plastic container. I don't add the dried fruit until I use the granola. I find it tends to get hard in the plastic container. I also use a variety of fruit: raisins, cherries, pomegranates, apricots, or whatever I have on hand. It makes a great "munchy" snack, good as a cereal or add it to your yogurt

Have made this several times....very comfortable adding / subtracting / substituting ingredients such as different kinds of nuts, coconut, flavorings, etc. Personally, I go for "edgy burnt" -- like to get it where it is pretty dry, dark, and crunchy. I have never made a batch that wasn't delicious. Best granola ever.

I halved the recipe and used less honey and brown sugar per other reviewers who said it was too sweet. I will not do that next time. I guess I like it sweet and crunchy. I'll update when I make it again.

This was a good recipe; I agree that a few tweaks would bring it up a notch or two, though. DEFINITELY turn down the heat. Additionally, reduce the amount of sesame seeds. I like the flavor also, but if you're not a big fan, it might be overwhelming. I also plan to add some wheat germ/bran to the finished product, when tossing.
This recipe is a great jumping-off point for variations, though, so thanks for that!

Just made this as written, and even though I forgot and added the cranberries before baking it still came out delicious! Will definitely make again - thanks for a great recipe!

This granola was delicious! I cut the recipe in half, eliminated the wheat germ and oat bran because I didn't have them, and reduced the sweeteners. Otherwise I followed the recipe and just kept an eye on the granola once it was in the oven to make sure it didn't burn. I probably wouldn't eat this as a cereal by itself, but it's a nice crunchy addition to yogurt or oatmeal.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe. Since I can't have honey or agave, we used maple syrup instead - yummy! We have made various versions now. The last batch we made was with sunflower seeds and pecans. WOW!  LOVE this recipe!!!!

My family loved this recipe!  It is so delicious and versatile. I just used what I had, (seeds and fruit) in the same proportions as the recipe, but it is the 'sauce' that makes it. My teenagers would grab a handful and I had trouble having some to eat with my fruit and yogurt.

Fantastic most versatile recipe! Living in Shanghai I could not find any normal granola...only the imported brands with too much sugar. Thank you for sharing this recipe, it is so versatile so I could use whatever nuts and fibers were available and make a delicious granola! I've used all kinds of oats and nuts and fruits. For vegetable oil, I prefer coconut because it adds to the sweetness. Two items that are not on the recipe that I usually add: shredded coconut and after baking, some chopped dark chocolate or chocolate chips. Also, I leave out most of the sugar.

This is actually the first and only review I've ever posted on allrecipes.com so it must be good. I've been making it for about 3 years now and it's awesome. Way better than store bought. I don't alter one item of the ingredients. My daughters love it as is. Thank you for sharing. Getting ready to make another batch at this very moment!

Made this for my daughter who is quite picky.  She really liked it and adds it to her yogurt.  For my tastes would add more fruit but for her I used less because of the use in yogurt. Good recipe as written.

I add more nuts and dried fruits.  I make it for me mostly, and since it makes lots, I keep a container of it in the freezer and take out a week's serving at a time.  Visitors love it.  This recipe gets rave reviews!

This is the best granola recipe I have ever seen!  Everyone loves it.  The maple syrup is key!
I like to add a cup of coconut to the dry ingredients, as well as a cup of pumpkin seeds.

This turns out crunchy and delightful. I burned it a bit the first time I made it, so the second time, I turned down the heat to 300 and left it in the oven a bit longer.  Don't let its softness trick you into thinking it won't be crisp when it cools.

Perfect! This was my first attempt at granola.  I chose this recipe because of the many great reviews.  So glad I stumbled upon a perfect recipe the first time around.  I made it almost exactly as called for with only 2 changes:  I used slivered almonds, and chopped the other nuts "rustic" as opposed to "fine."  Also, I added about 1 1/4 C dried cranberries and 3/4 C dried blueberries.  YUM!  Am packaging some in small jars with an individual yogurt, individual OJ, and a homemade muffin to give as teacher treats this Thanksgiving.

Great recipe. I omitted the brown sugar and put a little extra syrup. Followed someone's advice and subbed coconut oil for the regular oil and threw a cup of coconut in after 10 minutes of baking. Next time I think I will try the suggestion to sub 1/2c. applesauce for 1/2c.of the oil. Yum!

Really good flavor.  Didn't have much cinnamon so used some pumpkin pie spice.  A bit sticky.  Stuck to pan pretty badly. Not sure how to correct that.

This is my favorite granola base recipe. The combination of honey. maple syrup, and brown sugar is perfect. I vary the nuts and berries to add variety and I normally add flax or chia seeds as well.

This is wonderful. It has transformed breakfast for my family and become a staple gift at festive times - unexpected, especially here in India! 
I made a few small changes: I omitted the sunflowers (don't like them); used salted roasted almonds (I like a little salt with the sweet) and because we don't get wheat germ here, I left it out and used a bit more oats and a bit more bran (wheat and oat).

A ton of shopping for the ingredients but excited to get started.  The pile of granola was incredible -- cooked, it's about four pounds!  Two issues:  first,  oven at 325* requires more than 20 minutes to get granola crispy ... took more like 40 minutes and I had to thin it down, so either make four or five large baking sheets, each sheet individually baked, or count on soggy granola.  (My oven is perfectly calibrated.)  Second,  are you sure you got everything "crispy" at 20 minutes on 325*?   The color of your granola in the photo indicates it's at the soggy stage and not crispy.  Crispy is darker, actually, and I've got about seven batches to compare when, exactly, the granola gave me crunchy texture.  It's got some nice taste, but I'm still waiting to add the raisins (it's been an hour and the granola is still too warm to add that).

When I first made this and tried a handful while I was putting it away, I thought it was quite nice. The next morning I grabbed a bowl to have with milk, and maybe I just don't like nuts with milk that much or something because I didn't like it at all and ended up throwing it out and having something else. Remembering how much I liked it without milk, I thought I would add some chocolate chips and yogurt and have some for dessert. This made it ok, but still not that much of a fan of it. Guess I'll keep looking for a granola that tastes great with or without the milk.

This recipe is fabulous! I made it without the brown sugar, as we typically don't like things too sweet. Next time, I will use half the brown sugar as well. There really is no comparison to store bought products. I will definitely be making this again.

This is seriously the best granola I've ever had.

It was too sweet as written, so I cut the sugar and oil both by about 45% and it worked fine.

Also, the original recipe is pretty expensive, so I've taken to making a half batch and cutting it with cheap cornflakes and rice crispies as filler (for myself).

Made this and it was incredible.  The family liked it so much we made another batch about 2 weeks later.  Will be making the another batch today but we're going to start cutting the recipe in half as it just makes too much for all of us.

This is a great recipe. I make it often and it is a big hit.  I enjoy tweeking it a little, not wheat bran as I am gluten free.  I add pumpkin seeds in the fall, and sometimes add an extra cup of nuts (we love nutting granola).

Good recipe! I added unsweetened coconut flakes, pumpkin seeds, 1/4 cup molasses and fresh ground nutmeg.
Next time I think I'll throw in finely chopped fresh ginger.

Wonderful recipe. I used honey for sweetener plus 1/4 cup molasses.  Next time I'll substitute coconut for some of the seeds/nuts.

I've made this a coupe of times and made a few adjustments.  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and added 1/4 cup shredded coconut half way through the baking time.  love it!

A winning recipe. I added a bit of honey, maple and cinnamon, so that the taste will be sharper. If you add shredded coconut, put it with the raisins at the end (don't bake it). Going to make it again right now!

This was a great recipe to begin with for a reasonable amount of granola. I cut the sugar to  1 cup total and I used 1/3 cup  organic  blackstrap molasses,  1/4 cup maple syrup and and the rest honey. The blackstrap molasses gives it a rich and earthy taste that my family likes and the honey acts as a preservative. I did not use pecans and I used twice as many walnuts added to slivered almonds and the sunflower seeds. I didn't have oatbran so I used twice as much wheat  germ but I would add the oat bran  next time. I also added a cup of natural coconut flakes – unsweetened. I added an extra 1/2 tablespoon cinnamon and used 2/3  c natural applesauce  combined with 1/3 cup canola oil. I added 1 c organic raisins after I  cooked it at 300° until it was toasted.   I had no problem with burning. My family loved it and I will certainly make it again.   It lasted our family for three  weeks. My version of this recipe will be my go to recipe. Try the molasses if you like molasses.   It's yummy.  Thanks.

THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING GRANOLA EVER!!!!!! The granola also will give off one of the best scents ever that will fill your house with an amazing smell. I would make this again any day. I did put it in for about  minutes at a time stirring here and there at 275 degrees until I got the consistency that I wanted, but other than that, this recipe is FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!

Extraordinary recipe! I used dried cherries instead of raisins/cranberries bc they were already in the house. I'm going to enjoy trying lots of little variations of this recipe!

Very good recipe!!  I'm an experienced cook/baker, but this is my first time making granola.  I halved the recipe and prepared as directed (substituted unrefined coconut oil for the vegetable oil) and it was really good!

I didn't have the problem that a few reviewers did with the temperature being too high...perhaps they didn't bake the granola in a pan on the center rack of the oven? 

Thanks for a great recipe!

I didn't have wheat germ so I subbed in krispy cereal and it was delicious!  I also used other nuts including pistachios and it was also excellent.  Great recipe,  the best granola recipe I've ever used.

I really enjoy this granola!  I look forward to eating it in the mornings.  This keeps me full until past noon.   Additions I gave made are.... One cup of shredded coconut, one cup of cashew halves and pieces, sprinkling in of nutmeg and ginger (maybe about 1/2 and 1/4 respectively), and a couple teaspoons of almond extract.  I do use coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil.  I have been keeping the craisins out and adding them when I eat, if I wish; otherwise, they get a bit hard.  I also put half a banana in the bowl with the granola....so yum!!  I bake at 325 for twenty minutes, give a good stir, and bake for another twenty minutes.

This recipe is a wonderful template in which to experiment with different ingredients.  I've tried suggestions from other reviews, and they've all usually resulted in a delicious product.  I highly recommend browsing through them to get other ideas.

The first suggestion I have applied to the recipe every time I make it is replacing the oil with coconut oil.  If you have a Trader Joe's nearby, they have coconut oil for relatively cheap.

I've tried adding mini chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, organic unsweetened shredded coconut, flax seed, crisped rice, and following someone else's review I tried blue agave nectar.

I distribute the chocolate/peanut butter chips on top of the hot granola right after removing it from the oven, then I allow it to cool completely before transferring it to a container.  This allows the chips to slightly melt and adhere to the granola without scorching them during the baking process, and it also helps the chips retain their shape. Between the two sheets, I use a whole bag of my desired chips (weights may vary).

For crisped rice ( I used Rice Krispies), I gently mix them into the unbaked granola with a fork AFTER I pour it onto the baking sheets.  This avoids crushing the crisped rice.  The end result is a lighter texture with a delicate crunch.  I use about 1 Cup of crisped rice distributed evenly among the two sheet pans.

For the coconut, I add it with the other dry ingredients in the beginning.  I used about 1 Cup.  It doesn't need to be

This was my second attempt at making granola; my first attempt I used a different recipe and I ended up with a burnt mess, but this recipe was great. The only thing I did different was using shredded coconut instead of sunflower seeds as I don't like them in sweet things. I'll definitely make it again, but I think I'll add more cinnamon next time.

Excellent. I didn't have sunflower seeds, but I doubt that would have changed the flavor. Also, I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.

Really easy to make and tastes lovely, I've made it several times. I used coconut oil instead this time... it's cooling at this moment and I can't wait to try it. I've also put in some finely chopped crystallised ginger and I love it, I know its not for everyone but it really adds a zing to my breakfast!

I've been making this great recipe and modifying it for about 4 years.  I always add more nuts, or flax meal, chia seeds, dried figs, dates plus the cranberries and raisins.  With added dry ingredients the liquids also need some increase. My favorite is butter and my latest accident was to carmelize the sugars in a stick of butter, so now I'm stirring in 1 C of coconut oil after it's carmelized and it's marvelous.

I am really enjoying this recipe, very tasty. I too eliminated the brown sugar and increased maple syrup to a cup and honey to a half cup. Based on numerous comments, I started out trying baking at 200 for 40 min., but after the first 20 min, I bumped the temperature to 300.  I would like my granola to have more crunchy versus chew texture; right now it is more chewy then I would like. I added coconut and cashews to the recipe. I am guessing that baking it longer would make it more crunchy.  Any suggestions on this? By the way I appreciate the many comments--a lot of creativity out there.

I've made a lot of granola recipes and this one wins the delicious, quick and easy award.  I made it on a whim so I didn't have any wheat germ or oat bran, so I added flax meal instead.  I added dried cherries and craisins after it cooled.  I could hardly wait to eat it.  It is very crunchy and there were chunks that held together, both of which I love in a granola.  May never try another recipe again. (325 in my oven was perfect.)

Since this is such a great recipe, I increased the portions to 60 servings but decreased the honey to 1 cup and used 1/2 cup coconut sugar and 1 cup maple syrup to reduce the sugar content.

Good recipe, I modified based on other reviewers: added coconut, kept temperature at 250 Fahrenheit, didn't have honey so just added maple syrup and skipped the sugar.  All tips yielded some pretty tasty granola.  Gifting it for Christmas to family!

I make this every year for Christmas gifts in a jar. Some batches I make without fruit, some batches I add chocolate chips, craisins, yogurt covered raisins for a trail mix. Everyone looks forward to their gift every year. It's so easy to make and the best part is the big clusters!

I've made this about once a month for the last year.      My wife and I like it and so do the kids.  I make it with different dried fruits and nuts each time.

I've never reviewed a recipe before, but I decided now is the time! This recipe deserves recognition! I have never made a granola recipe before, but when I came across this one & just had to try it! All the rave reviews sold me on it. It seemed as though everyone who wrote a review about this recipe, made some kind of change to it. I wanted to make the recipe exactly as is. At least for my 1st try. If you follow the recipe exactly, you shouldn't have any problems. At least I didn't. I have to admit, I was very skeptical that it wouldn't turn out. When I took it out of the oven,  I didn't think it was so great.  I was wondering why it received so many rave reviews! But I completely understood after I gave it a chance to cool. I mean, really let it cool. Once it cools down, it gets sooooooooo much better! It was even tastier the next day!  Everyone who has made this recipe knows exactly what I'm talking about! It gets nice and crispy & is extremely addictive! I will definitely be making this again! I absolutely love it! Thank you for sharing such a great recipe Megan!

This is the first time a I have made this granola recipe and I am very pleased with how it turned out. I made a very large batch and added dried cherries, coconut and ground flax seed. I added the flax mostly because I had an unopened bag of it and had no idea what to use it for. When I saw this contained wheat germ, I though I could add the flax too. Worked great. 

Can't wait to share it. I am giving some away for Christmas.

Tastes great, easy to make.  I made it about three weeks ago and just finished up the last serving this morning. I love nuts, but I am going to make some today with only 3 cups of nuts.

I've never cared much for granola until I tasted this recipe.  It is soooo good that I can't stop eating it!  I eat "just one more spoonful" every time I pass by the jar.  I made it exactly as the recipe says except I bake it about 20 minutes longer so it is really crisp and browned.

Great recipe. I only made half the recipe because this was my first time making granola and I wasn't sure, but it turned out great! Also only used almonds, and date crumbles instead of cranberries, but that's just my preference. I'll definitely be making this again, thanks for the recipe and clear instructions.

I used this recipe for my first time granola making. It's TOTALLY AWESOME! There is no reason why to say 'no' to this recipe. Of course, I did as advised by other buyers - to reduce the sweetness. I used half cup of homemade unsweetened apple sauce with half cup of canola oil. And then 1 cup of honey and that's it. The sweetness is just nice. It's so good. I really love pecans in the recipe! You shouldn't take them out as they are the 'lucky bombs' when you eat this with your low fat milk/yogurt. Sadly, I am suffering from some fingers enzeama which is caused by oats.. Still, I cannot say 'no' to this granola.

I followed the basic recipe with just a few changes to suit me. I used the honey, maple syrup and brown sugar but in reduced amounts. It was delicious!

I swapped the vegetable oil for coconut. 
Added flaxseeds 
Used pure maple syrup
Raw unsalted nuts
I did blend 2 cup oats to make a powder so granola would bind together. 
Important to cook on lower rack, or top will burn. Can lower oven temp a little or really watch. 

For extra crispy clusters I used 3 cookie sheets to have it less than one inch. And pressed it hard. cooked 25 minutes, let cool, pressed and mixed raisins in and cooked for another 10 minutes.  Let cool in pan for at least hour to harden.  If still not crispy cook another 10 minutes.  

Took quite a few hours but very tasty and last my husband and 2 weeks.

I've made this twice and it always turns out perfectly by following the recipe.  This time, I also added ground flax & chia seeds (about 1/4 cup total) and it worked great.

Wonderful granola. But this time I changed it a bit. I am not crazy about cinnamon granola so I omitted that. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.... Amazing! I added flax meal, pumpkin seeds and walnuts. Cooked it according to directions. It turned incredibly good! And the smell of the coconut oil while it cooked was mouth watering!

Just in the oven now.  I forgot one step (distracted by my girls).  I'm hoping it comes out okay.  I never brought the sugar/oil mixture to a boil first... just stirred everything up together and threw it in the oven thinking, wow, that was easy!  Hoping for the best!  Before going in oven, it looked like granola, smelled like granola.  Next time, I will heat up the sugar mixture first.  But for now, I'm hoping for the best.... giving it 5 stars because that's how much faith in it I have already (providing I didn't goof up)

I cannot give this recipe enough stars!  Loved it and my husband loves it too.. The only change I made was omitting the almonds and walnuts (only bc we didn't have any) and the wheat germ.  I will be making this again this week.  Was not too sweet for us and love the maple syrup touch very nice! Thanks for the recipe!

So, here's the problem with this perfect recipe: I eat way too much. I make this for my husband. Every time I make it, I change it up a bit. I currently use coconut oil and dried blueberries. But,t his is a perfect basic recipe and there are no limits to possible changes. I've been making it for years and it's finally time for me to say, "thank you"!

Great recipe - fast and very simple.  I make my own pecan/almond milk (also very simple!) and use the leftover nut paste for this granola recipe.  I didn't have vegetable oil so tried using coconut oil and a couple tablespoons of butter instead - still turned out great.

Make this with coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil!!! Much, much better for you and adds a hint of yummy coconut. I replaced it with 1 cup coconut oil. Favorite granola for sure!

It's a good recipe.  My changes: subbed 1/2 C brown rice syrup for brown sugar to eliminate refined sugar.  Subbed coconut oil for vegetable oil.  Didn't have pecans so put 2 C almonds.  Baked 275 for 1 hr, stirred at 20 min and 40 min, and didn't stir again.  After removing from oven at 60 min, let set 20 min to harden.  My husband who likes sugar in his cereal really liked eating chunks of this.  May try other options in future, including other nuts and coconut flakes.

Ok! Its just me eating this so I made half the recipe and it still makes alot. I used what I had on hand which was sunflower seeds pumpkin seeds and sliced almonds and ground flax seed instead of wheat germ. I left out the brown sugar and added just a bit more honey plus 1/2 c. pumpkin apple baby food because I like it more moist than crunchy. I love cinnamon so I added a bit more than the recipe called for, it wasnt overpowering, and some fresh nutmeg and ginger (I eyeballed both). I think it came out perfect! Not too sweet, not too mushy or crunchy. I did leave it in for about 20 minutes longer but I think that may have been because of the extra moisture.

This recipe is perfect.  I only left out walnuts because I don't care for them & used dried cherries/raisin/cranberry combo.  Next time I will just use cherries and cranberries. 
Everyone loved it!

This is the best granola. I have been making this for 2 years now. I use any mixture of nuts I have on hand. And I use coconut oil. I also use palm sugar for brown sugar. Since I make it every week, I reuse the same parchment paper over and over.

My husband and I think this is best granola recipe - hands down!  If you'd like you can do variations, but it is so good as it is.

This recipe is delicious and fresh. To avoid stickiness, mix ingredients thoroughly.  Cook 20-30 minutes longer than recipe suggests, stirring every 20 minutes.

It smelled good whole cooking and I will try it again, but one hour was too long and it was too dark.  Next time I will try 275 degrees and maybe 45 minutes.  I would also increase the ratio of liquid to dry as it was a bit too dry.  I cooked it on a silpat on a good quality heavy gauge cookie tray.  I also think it needs a bit more flavor, maybe a bit more cinnamon.

This is the best granola I've ever had and first successful attempt at making it!  So easy- can't wait to make it again. The base syrup takes only a minute to prepare. I didn't have enough cranberries so with them, I added chopped dried pineapple and candied ginger and coconut to continue the flavor theme. I only had pecans and pumpkin seeds so I added flax and sesame and all bran cereal and wheat germ. The flavor! It was buttery- a blend of salty sweet crunchy chewy- a cookie-like experience. I've had it with milk, yogurt and ice cream. Wow is all i can say! The versatility is endless! Thank you so much! Never any reason to buy granola at the store again.

We love this granola recipe.  It's definitely our go-to.  I usually add about 10 minutes to the cooking time to crunch it up a bit more, and it's great.  Also, I can never get the sauce to boil over medium, so I go straight to high for that.  We add craisins and omit the sunflower seeds just out of preference, and it turns out great!  Love this over vanilla Greek yogurt!

Easy--took 30 min in my convection? Not sure why it was longer for me.  Next time I may omit the cinnamon, craisins, and walnuts and add some peanut butter, peanuts, and chocolate chips (after cooling) to see what that would be like.

I would say that that this recipe is extremely nutritious and could be eaten as snacks throughout the day or as breakfast meals, where you can perhaps mix the granola with some yogurt or even berries for an even sweeter taste. I would prefer to however, switch some sweetening factor ingredients out, as there are too many in this particular recipe for me. I would perhaps take out the maple syrup since the honey and brown sugar already substitutes and fulfills the sweet component well enough. More importantly, by taking out the maple syrup will likely lower the amount of calorie, making it slightly healthier for the consumers. In addition, I would for myself substitute the brown sugar with dark brown sugar and maybe add in some dried apricots and cranberries to satisfy my personal taste since I’m not a big fan of raisins. Overall though, I think your recipe is amazing and I’m sure it would taste really great just by observing the amount of effort and ingredients you came up with. I will definitely have to follow this recipe and try to bake some myself when I have a chance. Thank you for sharing this recipe. - Bee Nandabhiwat

This is my first review ever but because this granola is sooooo good, I want to review it. This is the best granola I've ever had! I've made it 5 times now. I do have to cook it longer than 20 minutes to get it toasted the way I like it, but that is the only change I made. It is wonderful, healthy, and economical!

This granola is first rate!  I just made it for the first time and it's really delicious.  The only changes I made were to use pumpkin seeds, chopped, instead of sunflower seeds (had pumpkin seeds on hand) and to use coconut oil instead of veg oil (healthier, in my opinion).  325 degrees F was the perfect temperature, but after I stirred it for the first time at 10 minutes, per the recipe, it really got cooking and required stirring every 3 minutes or so, which I was happy to do.  I baked it for a total of 27 minutes because I wanted some toastiness in the nuts and no raw taste in the oats.  It worked out wonderfully.  I can't wait to bag some up and deliver it to my mom and my kids because I think they will love it.  I love it.  GREAT on plain Greek yogurt with a few raspberries sprinkled over, even though it was still warm from the oven (no patience in this house, alas).  Oh, I did not add the raisins as some of my peeps don't like them and we'll probably all be eating the granola over yogurt with berries.  Thank you so much for your efforts in developing and sharing this recipe.

A little too sweet, probably depends on what fruit is added. As someone mentioned earlier stir in the nuts for the last part of the baking for a richer taste.

Great recipe!! Although I made a few changes. I didn't have any sunflowers so I used more of the other nuts. I didn't have enough oatbran so I used flax seed meal in place. I used 1/2 cup sesame seeds also (they are great when baked). I put the raisins and cranberries in while the granola was warm to soften them up. I will probably add less salt next time and more cinnamon.

Freaking awesome! I didn't have bran or germ, so I didn't use it but it and it still tastes wonderful. Next time I may add more cinnamon or maybe include nutmeg, we will see.

I made this recipe today and have never made granola before. For some reason I was intimidated by it. I found this recipe to be very easy and I followed it exactly with the Tablespoon of cinnamon. It turned out absolutely perfect! I can't wait to eat it with my yogurt in the morning!

Yum.  Alter as you wish.  I suggest making more sauce than it calls for just in case you need a little extra to coating you put together.

Great recipe. I halved it. Added about 1/3 cup,of sesame seeds. And omitted the walnuts. Love it with yogurt. Or over some cooked apples with a scoop of vanilla ice cream it's  just like a super quick apple crumble :) yum!

Love it! This is my go to granola recipe. After making it several times as written I have made a few changes to the basic ingredients to increase the protein content. I reduced the oats to four cups, and replaced them with 1.5c flax seed, 1.5c almond meal, and 1.5c pepitas. Additionally I leave out the fruit and increase the nuts & seeds called for in the recipe by 1/2 cup each. I have saved this as Nutty Granola in My Fitness Pal if you use that app, 186 calories per quarter cup. Additionally when serving I add a tablespoon of chia seeds to each bowl--if you haven't tried them yet this recipe is the perfect thing to stir them into, so so good for you!

I made this recipe, except I didn't have any vanilla extract so I used Orange extract. I figured cranberries and orange tastes pretty good together, so why not? I just did a little bit so I didn't overpower it. I followed the recipe except I also halved it and it turned out really good. I'd make it again.

Great recipe!  It's really easy and delicious.  I don't add the wheat germ and I also use less oats.  As for the baking - it takes me about 30-40 minutes and I stir every 8-10 minutes so that it cooks evenly.  When it starts to turn golden it ready.

I have made this recipe several times and it turned out great every time.  I made this to take on vacation to have for easy breakfasts, unfortunately it didn't even make it to our destination because my daughter ate it on the car trip from Indiana to Florida.  Recipe is a keeper, thanks for posting.  P.S. It can burn easily so make sure you check it regularly as each oven cooks differently.

Substituted some nuts (walnuts mainly) for cashews and pumpkin seeds and added flax seeds as well--LOVE IT! I stirred at 8 min and it was done at 15 min in my oven.

The best granola ever!! I made this *almost* exactly as written. I substituted 1/2 C of sunflower seeds with flax seeds. Other than that, everything else remained exactly as the recipe stated. 20 mins in the oven, stirred once in the middle of cooking. It is PERFECT! I love it!! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with the allrecipes community! I'll make this again and again!

My first time making granola and I had problems with cooking it too long and burning it a little. I made a couple of changes I thought worthy to share. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable. I added unsweatened coconut flakes and pumpkin seeds. Everyone who tasted it said it was the best granola they'd had! Fresh :-)  Now to perfect my cooking temp and time...

Loved this recipe!  I did use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil,  I used agave instead of syrup because that is what I had on hand and I did not put the brown sugar in because I got distracted when I was making it and forgot.  It will burn quick if you don' keep a close eye on it. Now that I have made my first batch, next time I may add coconut or different nuts.  Lots of opportunity for mix and match.  Others have noted that the cost of ingredients is high which is true but if you compare to a gourmet brand of granola like Bare Naked, you still come out ahead. Super yummy when mixed with yogurt.  5 stars!

I've made this recipe probably hundreds of times; I've had it for breakfast almost every day for years.  Obviously I love it.  I make a few changes, to make it less sweet and to give it more insoluble fiber:

* Skip the maple syrup, but add more oil to make sure the ratio of wet to dry ingredients is unchanged.
* Substitute ground flaxseed for some of the oat bran and wheat germ

*** Also, I've found that the granola is more reliably crispy if you cook it for 50 min at 275.

Note: If you don't have wheat germ, I've found it's still delicious if you substitute oat bran for the wheat bran.

The Best granola ever! My 5 and 7 year old love it and I didn't have to add chocolate chips! I used coconut oil instead of veg oil. Left out the almonds cuz I'm allergic and brown sugar. Added chia seeds and pumpkin seeds. I also lowered temp to 300 and baked for 25 mins.   This is so good! Thank you.

This was my first time making granola and it couldn't have turned out better.  Everyone that I shared the granola with went absolutely crazy for this.  My husband says it makes him sing in the morning to eat it for breakfast.  I did add one addition to the recipe.  I added orange zest, it was a tablespoon more or less added to the oats and nuts before the syrup is added.  I'm planning on using lemon zest when I switch out the dried fruit to blueberries, lemon loves blueberries.  Thank you for the perfect granola recipe.

We always follow this recipe pretty closely.  We usually sub out the oat bran for ground flax seed, I use whatever nuts I have on hand to equal 4 cups.  Pistachios and Peanuts are a fun favorite in our granola.  I also use 3/4 c. maple syrup instead of the combination of brown sugar and maple syrup. Love that it makes such a large batch!

This was delicious!  I made it exactly as stated.  One thing to note, however, is to really cut down your salt if you use salted sunflower seeds.  Maybe cut down the salt slightly regardless and taste it and add more if needed.  My daughter and I had a great time making this and even better time enjoying the fruits of our labor.

I have used this recipe at least ten times.  It is very good!  I usually double it.  It stores very well in an air tight container.  If you don't have enough honey, just add more syrup.  The recipe is very flexible.  It's very important to add the dried fruit after it has been baked.  Crunchy, burned raisins are not so good!

This is the first granola recipe we have ever tried and we love it.  according to other reviewers I have substituted coconut oil for the canola oi.  I also add dried blueberries, dried cherries, coconut and more flax seed at the end.  i also double the amount of cinnamon and add fresh nutmeg. We have made this at least half a dozen times and it only lasts a few weeks around this house.  Thanks for sharing.

DEEE-LISH!! Make it constantly. I leave out the sugar as its perfect without it, no pecans (don't like them) and add 1 and 1/4 cups coconut. FABULOUS. My kids love it, ages 4,6 and 7. And I can't keep my husband away from it hence i make it constantly :) Try it, you won't ever need to look for another recipe.

We love this granola!  Of course I have made changes to it... First I use coconut oil (really good for you and has that coconut taste).  I leave out the wheat germ since my husband does not like it and use 1/2 cup more oat bran and 1/2 cup more oatmeal, leave out the walnuts and use 1 cup sunflower seeds, 1 1/2 cups slivered almonds and 2 cups pecans.  I add different dried fruits.  This is great for snacking, over yogurt, and of course for cereal.

Ohmigosh - YUM! We used extra virgin olive oil and added dates, raisins and coconut. It made the house smell amazing and all 5 boys are asking for more. Great recipe and easily made! A keeper!

I have been dying to eat some granola, i was so tired of eating cheerios every morning!  made this recipe, it is so easy to do, and i had every ingredient on hand except sunflower seeds.  i added flax seeds, and when i mixed the honey, oil and vanilla together, i forgot to add the brown sugar.  so when i had the granola laid out on cookie sheets, i sprinkled the granola with the brown sugar, it is the best granola i have ever eaten. one more thing, i used golden raisins, i find them softer than regular raisins, so i had half and half craisins and golden raisins.  i have eaten this 3 times in the past 2 days!

I have never made granola before and this recipe was both easy and delicious.  I substituted different nuts and dried fruit.  I used less salt and also cut the recipe in half because I thought it was going to be a lot.  Well the response from my family is so enthusiastic that I'm going to have to make the whole recipe soon!  Also, I had no problems with burning.

We leave out all the extra stuff when making the granola and mix it in depending on our mood and taste at the time of consumption. With that being said, this granola is so amazing, we can't eat anything other type again!

Really Good & EASY!  My family loves it!  I'm on my second batch - made it just like the recipe, but in my oven I have to cook it more like 30-40 mins. Easy to tweak for what you have on hand and personal taste. Thanks!!!

This is the best stuff I've ever eaten! I always have it for breakfast with almond milk and then at lunch I top my fruit salad with it. If I have to go a day without it, it's not a good day! I've given this recipe (with a couple alterations) to my best friend and she hasn't gone a day without it either! I cut the recipe in half so I can just use my KitchenAid mixer and making it is a breeze. I recently deleted the wheat germ, increased the rolled oats--actually all the dry ingredients--and doubled the applesauce. One trick I have to pass on is to use a potato masher to break up the big lumps when you stir it in the middle of the baking time. Again, I love this granola and kudos to Megan and her daughter!

So yummy!  I replaced the oil with coconut oil, cut brown sugar to 1/4 cup, and my husband could not find wheat germ and oat bran at the grocery, so we went without.  It was great!  Thank you for this delicious recipe!

I have made this several times, and every time it gets better!  The first time I follow the recipe exactly, and got hooked.  Since then, I have substituted, tweaked, and altered the recipe, but every time is just as good. Since my husband likes his granola kind of chunky/chewy, I mix 3/4 of the syrup over the whole batch of dry ingredients, then dump 3/4 of that mix on one cookie sheet.  Then I add the remaining syrup on the remaining mix, shake it some more and pat it into a separate cookie sheet.  The best of both worlds!!  This is a staple in my recipe box!!

Only change I've made is the quantity of cinnamon, for our familly likes it extra cinnamony, and I vary the dried fruit with what I have in the house. I've had raves from all over the board!

Wonderful! This was my first try at homemade granola. I cut the recipe in half because I was unsure. I was afraid it might burn so I tried 225 degrees but it took about 2-3 hrs (finally I shut the oven off and left it for a couple hours and it crisped right up!) Also, subbed veg oil for coconut oil and used flax seed because I didnt have sunflower seeds. SO GOOD.

Delish!!!  We couldn't keep our hands off of this before it went in the oven.  If you want to make this healthier, add 1C of coconut oil instead.  MUCH better for you than icky vegetable oil, and it tastes much better!  I added chocolate chips to this, too.  Yum, yum, yum.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I reduced the recipe to 5 serving (I'm the only one in my house who eats granola) and it was fine.  The only thing is, you have to watch this or it will burn!  I stirred mine after ten minutes and put it back in for an additional 10 minutes and it was almost burned.  I also only put mine in a 315 degree oven.  I think next time I will either bake for only 15 minutes or I will reduce the heat to 300 degrees.  I will definitely be using this recipe again though.

Great flavours; good fruit & nut to oatmeal ratio. Followed suggestions to bake at 300 or lower for 40 mins; worked perfectly. Can reduce honey and/or maple with little sacrifice for flavour.

I love this granola I also add 1 cup of shredded coconut and increase the nuts to 1-1/2 cups.  I occasionally even add a 1/2 cup 100% cranberry juice to liquid.  It seems to take longer to cook then the time allotted.  But I just keep checking it til it is done.  I have made it about 10 times so far.  It is great.

Great recipe! I make this on a regular basis. Sometimes I substitute pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon if I want to change it up.

Great recipe. I used Almond extract instead of vanilla, used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and omitted the maple syrup ( would have used sugar free syrup but I did not have any on hand). I also added some quick oats since that is what I had in my pantry.
Baked a little longer than 20 min. even in a convection oven.  Nice texture and favor. 
Will make again!

What a great recipe!  I use it on my Greek Yogurt in the morning.  I have a horrible oven, so I lowered the temperature to 300, and had to flip them around every 5 minutes or so.  I love it just the way it is!

Yummmmmmm!  This is my new go-to recipe for granola!  I had a couple of slight changes (applesauce with a dash of oil instead of just oil and I had to bake this significantly longer to get a good crunch)....but it's delicious!!  Thank goodness I won't have to buy granola again! :)

I've never made granola from scratch before and this recipe has me hooked on homemade vs. store bought.  Store bought is around $5.00 for two cups and this is tastier and cheaper.  Thank you for an awesome recipe to share with us.  You rock annie9!

I use this as a basic recipe,  and sub the wheat products (to make it gluten free) with ground flax, hemp hearts, etc. to make up the dry ingredients.  I've made this several times already, each time with different nuts and grains.  I have five kids and a hubby who all LOVE it as a cereal and as a topping on their yogurt.  I don't spray the pan and never have any problems with it sticking to the pans at all.

This was my first attempt at making granola and I am so pleased with the end result!  It tastes wonderful and this recipe is also very forgiving.  I forgot to purchase sunflower seeds, so I just left them out; my daughter even spilled extra cinnamon and vanilla in the bowl...and still the granola turned out excellent.  I actually baked mine for 25 minutes, as I like a crunchier granola.

I will be using the recipe again for sure and look forward to playing with ingredients.

I hate to give poor reviews, but something about the taste just didnt do it for me. I made the following changes: all maple syrup instead of honey, no added brown sugar, and I used the fruit and nuts I had on hand. Maybe had I added the extra sweetness, I would have liked it more.

This turned out great. I needed to bake it an additional 10 minutes and I think I might have needed to put it in for another 5-10 minutes (every oven is different).

Fantastic! I made this for the first time yesterday. I used an organic multi grain hot cereal (rye, barley, oats and wheat), and Bob's Red Mill Organic High Fiber Hot Cereal with Flaxseed, as I had neither the regular rolled oats nor plain wheat germ and oat bran. I have a convection oven and was a bit worried about the temperature, so I set it at 250 degrees and gave it a stir every 15-20 minutes. It took about 45 minutes to get it to the "brownness" we like in our granola. I can definitely say I will never buy granola again. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

Insanely Craveably Good.  Doubled the batch and  turned the heat down to 275 - tossed every 15 minutes for a total of 45 minutes since there was more in each pan. omitted the dried fruits, subbed 1/2c of the oil with a stick of butter.  Don't hate it is really a small amount per serving and delish!

This was GREAT! I made it last night and it smelled delicious while it was baking. Had a bowl with some skim milk and it was the best granola I've eaten. Even my boyfriend who doesn't like trying new things thought it was great! Thanks for sharing! :)

I cut the oil in half (used canola), left out the brown sugar, and added about 1/4 cup agave nectar but did everything else by the recipe.  EXCELLENT!!!!  I brought a huge jar to work this morning and it's already gone.

SO yummy!  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and there was still a TON there!  I gave some to my daughter's preschool teachers- they both asked for the recipe!  I substituted coconut oil for canola oil.  I also used 1/2 raisins and 1/2 dried cranberries.  Next time I will add some more raisins and cranberries to the mix.

Perfect granola-I didn't add the dried fruit because I eat it with my yogurt. Perfect combo of sweet, nutty, and crunchy. The cooking time was too long for my oven-burned the heck out of the first batch and found I only needed about 12 minutes so keep an eye on it and see how fast it cooks in yours.

This is our typical breakfast during winter - we stir it in with yogurt or soy milk. Sometimes I bake in apple sauce instead of the brown sugar to make it less sweet. Exceptional recipe!

This is yummy!  My husband loves it!  I would suggest dividing the recipe by 4 (yes, 4 :)  if you want to make approximately the amount of granola that you buy in a smallish box in the store.  Great!!

Tastes great!  I halve the recipe, add coconut, and reduce the oil and sweeteners.  Tried the applesauce with just a little oil this last time because I just read the oil label and found that it is 14g of fat for each tablespoon!  I don't even want to think about how much fat that is in 1/2 cup!  I needed to cook it for almost 30 minutes without the oil, and the house didn't get that wonderful smell.  Oh well -- the price of healthier eating!

I give it 5 stars for Taste but for instruction 4 or 3 stars!! I had never made granola before so I did not know it would dry out and crunch after when it was cooling. I over cooked it!! The recipe said about 20 min!! I would do no more then 20 min. Good luck the taste was great!! And I like the idea of adding m&m's to make it a kids snack! Thanks for the reviews!

Excellent granola. the change that I made is just for my personal preference, not that it needed it. I added pumpkin seeds ~ chia seeds ~ and sesame seeds. I used agave instead of honey. I keeper.

This makes some really tasty granola. I added a cup of pumpkin seeds, and a handful of shredded unsweetened coconut, and subbed half of the veg. oil for coconut oil. I recommend halving the recipe. I made half and it makes a TON of granola, for two people this will last us a long time.

LOVE this recipe--I actually double it as my husband eats it like it's going out of style. Use it plain, on yogurt, on top of oatmeal. Have varied ingredients based on what I have--always turns out great. I make it over and over!

This is so yummy!!! The only thing I changed was I didn't use maple syrup or oat bran because I didin't have any...I did 1/2 c. sunflower seeds and 1/2 c. pumpkin seeds. Not as sweet as I would have liked but it's probably because I didn't have the maple syrup. I also used olive oil instead of veggie.

I only made a 1/4 of the recipe because I wasn't sure how good it was going to be.  It is excellent and I will be making a full recipe this weekend!  I didn't have the wheat germ or oat bran - so I threw in some flax seed and crushed bran flakes in with the rolled oats.  Instead of maple syrup, I used agave nectar.  Used Olive oil instead of veg oil.  Like other's suggested, I stirred it every 5 minutes to keep from burning.  Next time I will only bake 15 minutes because I think 20 was a little long...it got a little too toasted for me - but it could be my oven temp is off.  EXCELLENT recipe!!!  I would give it 10 stars if I could :)

This is absolutely delicious!  I agree with other reviewers--the problem is trying not to eat of all of this in one sitting!  I made it for Christmas gifts this year, and everyone raved about it, with several people asking for the recipe.  My only alterations to this recipe were--substituted All Bran cereal for oat bran, no almonds (didn't have them), and no raisins or cranberries (in case people didn't like them).  Otherwise I made as directed and it was great!

Excellent Granola!  I didn't have any honey, but corn syrup was a fine stand in.  Not the healthiest choice, I know, but it worked in a pinch.

Give it a try.  I did it with flax seed, almonds, cashews and a dash of peanuts and it was good.  Just be sure to not overcook it.

You can make this as simple or complex as you want! I simplify it by just using honey, olive oil, a little water, salt, and then the mix-ins.

this is one of my favorites. Some things I do differently. Use flax seed instead of wheat germ. I don't use sunflower seeds nor maple syrup. 20 minutes may not seem like enough time, but when it cools it is crisper. This has become a favorite breakfast cereal for us. So much healthier and less expensive than store bought granola.

Excellent! Easy to make but I suggest using insulated baking trays to avoid burning. It took longer to cook using insulated sheets but worth it! DELICIOUS! And healthy too. I had no maple syrup so used golden syrup instead and added raw pumpkin seeds too.  We serve it hot - microwave 15 seconds after adding milk!

I tried this granola and it was very healthy, but a bit too bland for my taste. But I think that can be fixed if you add a handful of chocolate chips, you did a great job though, annie9, your kids love it!

I have 4 children, 4 and under, and we love granola.  LOVE.  This is our very favorite recipe and we've tried a few.  We make this about twice a month.  It's sweet enough, but not too sweet, and it's really easy to make.  We sub chopped apricots and dried cherries instead.  And sometimes we add in semi chocolate chips after it's cooled.  Also, it's wonderful with homemade yogurt drizzled over top.

We liked this a lot - and my kids are the kind who like sugary cereals. (Can't get the dad to stop buying it.) For us it was just sweet enough. Don't cut down the sweeteners unless you're the tree-hugging, granola-eating type... oops, um, never mind.  We halved the sunflower seeds like one person suggested, and I couldn't taste them, but my daughter did and suggested we leave them out next time. The health food store I got my goodies at didn't have walnuts, so we upped the pecans instead, and they were OUT of oat bran, so that went out, too. (A health food store with NO OAT BRAN? Yeah, really!)  We made it with the craisins, and it was tasty! I thought it was a little chewy at the end of 20 minutes but was afraid to burn it thanks to other comments, so I turned off the oven and left it in for about an hour (like we do with meringue). It came out just right - crispy and no longer raw-tasting but not burned.  Thanks, Megan!

I was never really into granola until years ago I tried the one from Costco and became hooked! They ended up changing their ingredients & it now tastes like cardboard : ( .. so I have been on the hunt! I recently found one at Walmart by Harvest's Best & it is pretty good.. especially with strawberry yogurt & a little bit of banana.. Their granola was a bit to gooey.. But I found this recipe & I looked at the ingredients from the Walmart one & they are almost identical! I was so excited to make this.. first I wanted to make it using all the ingredients & no substitutes!! I did add pine nuts, cut the raisens in 1/2 & added cranberries.. I did 1/2 sliced almonds & the other half whole roasted almonds.. I read all the reviews before getting started.. so I did set the oven for 300 & for 10 minutes.. then I added my raisins/cranberries & mixed very well & set for 5 minutes & mixed again & set for another 5 minutes & one more time..I waited for it to completed cool & it was crispy!!  Is it Costco's granola mix? No, but it is really yummy!! Just keep mixing till your arm falls off & they will all get coated! Next time I would cut back on the rolled oats a bit, add pumpkin seeds, flax seeds & cut the maple syrup in 1/2.. tasty, but too overbearing!! I will definitely make again! It was so easy!!

This was very good.  I accidentally burned mine because I thought it needed to get crispy in the oven.  It was good anyways and when kept in an airtight container it lasts forever in the fridge!  Will make again!

I changed a few things to avoid going back to the store, but for a first time granola maker, this was a great base recipe.  Here are my changes: Used 1/2 stick of butter and 1/3 cup oil Did not have any basics but oats so I used 1 cup original grape nuts and 1 cup all bran original anlong with the oats. Toasted the nuts before adding them. Split the recipe and added fruit to half of it (along with some orange zest). Yummo!

This was really easy to make. My husband and I like to take granola to work and buying it premade at the store is so expensive. We both love it. I also like mixing it with yogurt for breakfast.

I was looking for healthier snack alternatives for my husband's lunch at work. This was the best tasting granola I've ever had. The flavor was just sweet enough and we all loved it.

Great stuff!  I followed some reviewers advice and used coconut oil (an ultra healthy miracle food...in my opinion) instead of veg oil (poison, in my opinion:D)and did as others, using the nuts I had on hand.  I used equal parts honey, maple syrup and brown sugar!  This is the best granola!  Going to add some pineapple jerky as soon I can get to the store.

I made this exactly according to the recipe. My only trouble was that the granola didn't "dry up" enough. Felt a little oily even after a few days later. Since it was so time consuming to make and the ingredients cost a lot, I was hoping it would be more crispy, less oily. In the end, I still give it 4 stars. Excellent in milk (or rice milk)!

This has become my families favorite granola. I omitted a few of the ingredients that they don't care for, but it still turned out wonderful. We also eat it like cereal with milk.

This recipe is ridiculously good! My whole family (not one of us big granola fans) loved it. I made it because we are going on a long road trip and wanted a healthy snack for all of us. I decided to try this recipe and am so glad I did!! I only used 1/4 cup honey and then 1 cup maple syrup and the listed amount of brown sugar and it was perfect. It was just sweet enough for us. Also, use the 1 Tbsp of cinnamon and vanilla. It adds so much - I also have mixed and matched the fruit, nuts, and seeds that I used. The only warning is this recipe makes a HUGE amount. Given how good it is, that was a good thing for my family.

This should be titled "Worlds Best Granola"!!!  I have made this recipe a dozen times and everyone loves.  I can not make it fast enough!  I made some small changes to suit our taste but we can not thank you enough for this recipe!!!    I did not add the maple syrup or the sunflower seeds or the walnuts.  Instead I used a full cup of honey and I cut the oil in half.  I also used about 2 cups of dry roasted no salt peanuts.  Once done baking I added 1 1/2 cups raisins.  Thanks!!!

I tried this recipe because I was trying to recreate the granola that a chef I used to work for made at her B&B.  This was an Excellent place to start.  I use cashews instead of walnuts (walnuts to bitter for me), I also add coconut slices, pepitas, and 1 tsp flax seeds (for 1/3 recipe) instead of oat bran.  It just isn't possible to buy granola any where near this good. It is not supposed to be a Diet food!  :)

If you're reading reviews, you're probably wondering, "do I want to spend all this money on ingredients?" - YES!! This recipe is EXCELLENT! I agree with welldone's review, the granola doesn't appear "crunchy" until it cools a little, so take it out after the suggested time. I didn't have all the ingredients so made a few subs: - I ran out of oat bran, so topped it up with 1/4 cup of ground flax  - I ran out of oatmeal, so added extra walnuts This recipe is a keeper- I'll make it again and again. Thanks!!

This is outrageously delicious.  I was disappointed that it doesn't stick together, but whatever, the taste makes up for the inconvenience of having to eat it with a spoon.  I cannot believe how YUMMY this is.  I only made 1/2 the batch, which yields a LOT.  I didn't use walnuts, instead I added an additional 1/4 cup of almonds and 1/4 cup of pecans.  This is SOOOOOOOOO good!!  Thank you for posting this yummy recipe.

I burnt half of the recipie trying to get it to get crispy. I cooked the first batch at the recommended temperature for 1 1/2 hours and it still wasn't crispy. I finally gave up and took it out. To my delight, I found it crisped up once it cooled. I decided to try to cook the second batch faster and upped the temp 50 degrees. It burnt within 15 min. Not a good choice. Overall, it tasted good. I left out the raisins. They didn't seem to fit in with the other ingredients very well.

I made this last night and it is super yummy. I cut down the recipe to 2 cups of oats and the other ingredients accordingly. I am gluten-free so I used gf oats and rice bran and flax seed instead of the gluten filled ingredients and it turned out awesome!

This was very good!  I was looking for a recipe that compared to taste of the store-bought stuff...fits the bill for me.  I added a few things- 1 c. coconut and 2 c. puffed rice cereal.  I baked at 300 for 40 minutes, per the suggestion of previous users.  It was a bit on the sweet side- perhaps would try without the maple syrup and cut down on the brown sugar and then add some fruit juices (pineapple and apple) to the glaze instead?  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!  I cut the recipe in half, left out the sunflower seeds, added 1/4 cup flax seed meal and 1/2 cup flaked coconut.  Sooo good!

This recipe is awesome!!! I couldn't find oat bran, so I just left it out and I added a little molasis and whole flaxseed. It only lasted about a week because we ate it everyday for breakfast or for snacks. I can't wait to make more.

This recipe is fantastic! I made it as stated with the exception of adding a couple extra handfuls of nuts. We love nuts! And I extended the cook time a little. Thank you so much!

Great, lots of nuts make it soooo yummy!! And you can mix and match nuts or raisins/craisins/cranberries to get the total amount of nuts needed. So crunchy... just sweet enough!! This was awesome! Thank you!

Turned out DELICIOUS!!  I did also add ground flax seed, chopped dates, and dried apples and cranberries.  The kids loved having all of the fruit in it.  It was a bit sweet for my tastes, but, of course, the kids didn't complain.  Will definitely make again.

I would actually give this a 3.5 if I could. It just wasn't as amazing as I had hoped it would be. It was good, and I liked that it wasn't too sweet. However I baked as instructed and it was still soft. So I baked it an additional 10min at 375. It did crisp up, but it didn't bind at all like I was hoping, it was just really crumbling.  It does taste good though and makes a good cereal or mix in for yogurt, etc.

delicious!!! the recipe is great.  i usually just use what i have on hand - milled flax seed instead of oat bran, no sunflower seeds if i don't have them, etc.  it's fun and super easy to make.  my roommates all love it! I've made it twice now, and we all share the outcome. i will definitely keep making this.  One note:  I have just been making a HALF recipe, because the one noted calls for so many ingredients.  this was plenty!!

This is so fabulous! since I dont personally dont like raisin, so I used dried apricot instead and I also substituted walnut with Brazil Nut. To my personal taste, I love it to be more sweeter so I added extra 4 tbs of brown sugar. Nice crunchy texture and a goodie which is guilty-free to eat.

This was a great and easy recipe. I love the nutritional value of the whole grains. This made a HUGE amount of granola, which I love! I would offer a couple of suggestions: First, stir in the vanilla to the syrup after it has come to a boil. Remember to take it off the heat and be careful of any splatter from the alcohol cooking off. This will help retain that yummy vanilla flavor. Second: Add the Cinnamon to the dry ingredients instead of the syrup. Don't be afraid to mix everything up in an oversized bowl with your hands before the hot syrup goes in, a great way to involve the kids in the kitchen . . . I used my 12 qt. stock pot. I love this on yogurt, as a cereal, or in cookies! It was so easy and forgiving. I also added shredded coconut for texture and flavor. Thanks for a great recipe!

The mixture of honey, syrup and brown sugar was perfect for the amount of dry ingredients. Just the right sweetness for my taste. I was concerned that it was such a large quantity that it would not be sufficiently dry when stored in an air tight container. I baked it 10 minutes longer than recipe called for and it was wonderfully toasty. I think I will take one of trays out at 20 minutes next time just to see the difference. I used different types of nuts that I had in the freezer and also a variety of dried fruits. I think you can be very creative with those ingredients. I also added double the amount of cinnamon and vanilla. This will be my preferred granola recipe from now on. Thanks.

This stuff is amazing.  I mean, I made all 30 servings and ate 1/3 and gave the other 2/3 away in one week because it was so good I wanted to share w/everyone.  I left out the raisins/cranberries b/c I don't like them, but used sugar free maple syrup, organic oat bran & wheat germ, etc, and it didn't sacrifice any of the taste.  A friend I gave some to asked me if it was loaded with butter and I had to break the news to her that it was completely guiltless.

I love this stuff!  Have made it several times now.  The last time I used regular rolled oats and not the quick cooking.  Much better texture.  Also increased the maple syrup to 1/2 cup, honey to 1 cup and brown sugar to 3/4 cup.  (Ok, so I like it a little sweeter!)  Also used dried cherries for the fruit.  This was the best batch ever.

Wow!  This is just amazing granola!  I got sick of buying mine at the store at skyrocketing prices.  The flavors are wonderful - cinnamon and syrup definitely add to it!  Thanks so much!  p.s. I cooked mine at 300 for 45 minutes, stirring every 20 minutes.

Not exactly what I was expecting.  I was expecting a traditional tasting granola which this isn't.  Saying that this recipe is very, very tasty.  I scaled down the recpie to serve 10.  It needed more quantities of wet ingredients.  The granola turned out really crumbly, not great if you're eating it with milk!  Not all was lost though.  We used it to mix with yoghurts and I made a couple of crumbles.  Will make again!

I thought I had all the ingredients but was missing the oat bran and still made it.  This granola was very good and easy to make, but for some reason we didn't like the combo with the sunflower seeds so I will probably just leave them out next time and make sure I get some oat bran first! :) It also stores very nicely and is yummy with yogurt and on ice cream.

This is fantastic granola! I've been eating it just with milk and also in my yogurt. I accidentally baked the cranberries instead of adding them at the end, but it still turned out great. I used 1Tbsp of both cinnamon and vanilla. Yummy! :)

WOW, so yummy! I used sugar free syrup since that's all we have in the house and it was great - cuts the calories a lot too! I cut out the walnuts and oat bran since I didn't have them and just added more chopped pecans and it was perfect! It's incredible with vanilla yogurt and fresh strawberries! Can't wait to make it again :)

This granola is fabulous!  I did make a few changes, I substituted coconut for one cup of nuts and used less nuts in general.  I used coconut oil for the oil called for but cut the amount in half.  I also substituted flax meal for some of the wheat germ.  I baked it for an extra 10 minutes so it was crunchier.  My kids also love it!

This recipe is awesome! It was the first time I'd made granola and it was so easy! I wasn't big on the sunflower seeds so I think I'll skip them next time. I really liked the cinnamon so I'll add a little extra. I think I'll try toasting at a lower temp next time like other reviewers have recommended. A little bit of mine ended up over done.

Oh my gosh, yum! Only changes I made were omitting the sunflower seeds and maple syrup, and adding about a cup of coconut instead. I also baked it a little longer and then turned the oven off and left it in another 1/2 hour. It turned out great and my three boys who had declared that they didn't like granola earlier in the day, all asked for it for dessert instead of a cookie! Next time I will try cutting back on the sugar and the oil to make it a titch healthier, but only so I don't feel guilty eating it every day because it is so good!

Love this. I couldn't find Oat Bran (found everything else at Wal-mart, of all places), so I used half flax seed and half rolled oats (in addition to what the recipe calls for) in its place. Halved the recipe, baked as directed, and it turned out great! Everyone at work loves it as well.

This was absolutely delicious and as per my husband, it is easily the best granola we have ever had.  I will never buy store-bought granola again.  I didn't use pecans and walnuts, instead I used peanuts which is what I had on hand.  Very yummy!

I make this all the time. Many times I had to use whatever nuts I had on hand, but the results are always great.  I've never had oat bran on hand and so it may be even better!  My son asks me to send it to him when he is away at college!

I just ate this for breakfast for the first time. It was so easy to make and was really good. I halved the resipe and it still made a lot. I didn't use wheat germ or oat bran, just the oats. I used almonds, pecans, and cashews for the nuts and both raisins and cranberries. The only negative thing I have to say is that it was a little too cinnamony for my taste, so next time I'll use less or no cinnamon.

I really like this granola- it's crunchy with just a hint of spice and not too much fruit. My only complaint is that it's a bit too sweet. I'm not much of a sweets person first thing in the morning and this tastes like a dessert to me. On the up side, it browned fantastically and has the best crunch I've found in a home made granola to date. If I were to make it again, I think I'd cut each of the sweeteners in half. I'd also add a tablespoon of water to help it clump a little better. The only change I made was that I used extra light olive oil instead of canola, to make it a bit more heart healthy. I'm not sure you really need as much as it calls for, so I may play with adding a bit less to help with the calorie count. It'd be very good on plain yogurt or in a parfait for dessert as is, or good for those who like sugary cereals in the morning (maybe even kids would go for it, even if they don't like "healthy" cereal). I may make it again, but I think I'll try other recipes before attempting to tweek this one.

What a delicious and flexible recipe!  I added flax seed and reduced the amount of nuts, but the possibilities are nearly endless.  I've made this many times with different combinations of dried fruits (papaya, raisins, mango) and nuts (cashews, almonds, pecans).  A true winner!

We have made this several times and love it!  Like everyone else, we've made a few little adjustments, but the basic elements of this recipe are great!  I use 1/8 cup real maple syrup, take out the sunflower seeds and use a mix of rolled and instant oats to vary the texture.  I also leave the dried fruit out, to be added later depending on the taste buds of the eater.

The best granola I've ever made. I don't typically care for homemade granola, but this is fantastic, even my kids like it. I used I didn't have wheat germ, so I just used more oat bran. I half canola oil / half coconut oil. I used almonds and hazelnuts. Thanks for the great recipe!

Love this. I split the recipe in half and have already made it two times.  I like it as a snack on it's own, or sprinkled over yogurt for breakfast. My toddler loves this too and keeps asking for more.  Time to make some more...

My breakfast skipping husband LOVES this granola for breakfast.  It makes tonnes, but I've still made it 4 times. He eats it with low fat vanilla yogurt.  Now my kids are addicted to.  It's nice to know they're starting their day without the boxed cereals that are full of preservatives and other chemicals.  Also makes a great snack for school.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Deeeelish! I would call this Oatmeal Cookie Granola:) I'm a HUGE granola fan and LOVE trying new recipes... this is at the top of my favorites list. The only changes I will make next time is to use all butter in place of the oil, and leave out the sunflower seeds. The granola tastes like oatmeal cookies until I hit a sunflower seed- then it throws the taste off. Awesome recipe Megan!

Great taste, easy to make, but I would prefer more "chunks."  I guess to do that, you probably need to add more honey.  Even my 11-year-old son likes this!

I have made this granola many times.  I do alter it -- I put in more seeds and nuts, less oatmeal, and I omit the cinnamon. (I added sesame seeds which are also very healthy.) Everyone loves it.

This turns out wetter if you don't use all of the germ/bran that you are supposed to. If you do, it will be pretty dry but I like it that way. I don't think I put in all the honey and put in some molasses to replace some of it, so that could also be why it is slightly dryer.
