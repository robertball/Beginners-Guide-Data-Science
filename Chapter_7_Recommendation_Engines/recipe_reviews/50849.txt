Great start to a fantastic recipe. I wanted to cook indoors, so I preheated the oven to 425.  In the meantime, I seared the sausage with some Worcestershire sauce just to seal in the flavor, then added this to a nonstick-sprayed roasting pan and mixed in the potatoes and onions, drizzled with olive oil, and added crushed red pepper (lots if you like it spicy!), Herbes de Provence, Kosher salt, ground black pepper, garam masala, garlic powder, and one sliced red bell pepper.  I did not use any butter as called for.  In the same skillet with the sausage juices, I sautéed the green beans with 4 cloves minced garlic and a bit of olive oil to soften.  I then added this to this mixture to the roasting pan and tossed all the ingredients together to coat.  Finally, I covered the pan with aluminum foil and baked for 40 minutes, removing the foil for the last 15 minutes, and stirring occasionally.  This was amazing!  Serve with garlic bread!

This is so good!  I make this recipe about twice a month.  I use canned green beans (2 cans) and sauté the green beans in a little olive oil with fresh minced garlic (4 or 5 cloves – we love garlic).  I then add the green beans with oil and garlic on top of the sliced onions (I use 2 onions), potatoes and smoked sausage and roast in a roasting pan at 425 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes, stirring a couple of times.  I also omit the water and do not cover the pan.  I tried this method and it seemed to steam the dish and we like ours browner and caramelized.  Thanks Tonya for a very awesome dish.

My family loves it all!  Fixed it over the weekend on a camping trip and it went down easy.  I used an even pound each of green beans, potatoes and sausage.. probably should have doubled the sausage amount, also.  The recipe seemed like it would be a good one so I made a double batch and tried one over an open fire and the other in a covered mini Weber grill.  The open fire batch I cooked for about 30-35 minutes.. some of the green beans and the potatoes were still a bit crunchy.  The other batch I left in the Weber covered for about 45 minutes.. it came out perfect; the sausage actually browned a bit and the green beans and potatoes were perfect.  I also sprinkled a pinch of Greek Seasoning overall when seasoning (just because I love that seasoning mix) and all in all I'm sure we'll have this many times more.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband and I loved this-we licked the plate clean!  It's important to spray the foil with non-stick cooking spray to ensure the food doesn't stick.

have made this twice. both times in the oven at 400 for 40 minutes in a 9x13 pan using cooking spray and covered with foil. last time used reduced fat polish sausage to lighten up and same fab taste we thought. Used 1 can green beans, 1 cob of fresh corn, 3 chopped garlic cloves, along with the onions and potatoes. Sliced red pepper is delicious as well. Also added some red pepper flakes and lots of pepper for some spice. i did not use any oil but rather used 1/4 can of juice from the green beans and just sprayed the top of ingredients with spray butter. so easy...throw it all in the pan and forget about it!

WHAT WORKED FOR ME AND HELPFUL TIP!: I used 4 medium sized red (w/skin) potatoes chopped in bite sizes so it's fast to cook (as my pic shows).  I don't have a grill and hate when I'm left out of a recipe! But I've made this several times now and the perfect advice of putting this in the oven for 425 (covered so everything can steam/cook and uncovered the last 15 minutes) was perfect!  Also, there's really no need for butter OR oil because quite frankly the sausage will have plenty.  I actually used andouille sausage (found at places like randalls, carrs, fred meyer, heb) because it has cajun spices and doesn't have that disgusting processed taste of kiebalsa.  I did fry for a few minutes on a pan w/Worcestershire as suggested and it was SOOOOO worth it.  I didn't add the sausage until the last 20 min b/c I didn't want dry sausage (and it wasn't).  Sprinkling red pepper over it was also an added bonus.  Was also worried about the water being too much, but again.. was perfect amount.  I just kept poking potato w/fork until it was done (50 min. for me).

I made a few adjustments I don't have an outdoor grill (I live in an apartment) So I baked this in the oven.  I used chrizo sausage and I coverved the pan with alumin foil to "steam" the vegetables the for the last five minutes of baking I removed the foil to let the potatoes brown.  I also added whole cloves of garlic (about 4) to give a little added flvor.  It was a big hit.

This one scored big at my house!  I added some corn on the cob and was so glad I did.  I thawed the nibbler-sized ears and threw them in with everything else.  All the veggies had a nice flavor.  I used a reynolds foil bag which made clean up really easy.

I love this recipe and sometimes make it at home.  Instead of using vegetable oil, salt and butter, I use italian dressing. Delish!

This was so GOOD!  I needed to use up leftover grilled sausage and a half can of green beans and this recipe fit the bill.  Simple prep consisted of cut up boiled red potatoes!  I had a pan of leftover sauteed butter panko bread crumbs.  i put all the ingredients into the pan and heated through.  Added freshly grated parmesan...will make again with fresh green beans. Will definitely add the sauteed panko bread crumbs with the garlic/sliced onion too!

I make this on the stovetop using fresh green beans (ends nipped), quartered red potatoes, beef smoked sausage or polska kielbasa cut into 1-inch pieces, 1-1/2 cups water, along with garlic powder, onion powder, salt & pepper.  I put the ingredients in a skillet on med-high stovetop and let simmer for 45 minutes or so, checking the water level every 15 minutes.  The water steams the potatoes and green beans, infusing the sausage flavor into the vegetables. An old family recipe and one of my kids' favorite meals!

I have been making this for about 45yrs and do it on the stove.  You can use bacon instead of sausage and have it as a side dish.  I have used sausage, pork and chicken.  The bacon gives it a smoky flavor.  I always use frozen or fresh green beans since canned vegetables are mushy and over-cooked. I like my veggies al dente.

Served this at brunch after opening day at our local yacht club.  Easy to prepare, hearty, filling and a perfect counter when consuming to much champagne!  I did add cloves of garlic to the mix and used olive oil vs vegetable.  Would definitely make again.  Thank you Tonya for another recipe to add to my collection.

Excellent dish! I made some modifications as I am wont to do. I didn't use the grill, but baked it in a 9 x 13 dish at 425 degrees. I sauteed 2 cans french style green beans with one sliced sweet onion, two table spoons minced garlic and a can of chopped portabella mushrooms, seasoned with onion powder, garlic powder, pepper and Old Bay Seasoning in two tablespoons of olive oil. I did not use butter. I cut up red potatoes, skin on, into chunks and microwaved in a bowl for 6 minutes. I sauteed turkey kielbasa with Worcestershire for about 8 minutes in another pan. I sprayed the baking dish with olive oil Pam then placed all ingredients into it. I added 1/4 cup water and sprinkled 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese over all.  Then I stirred it all together, covered with foil and baked for 40 minutes. I removed the foil, stirred again and baked an additional 10 minutes to brown. This was the bomb and I will make again and again! YUMMMMY!

Due to our harsh winter climate, I followed the advice of another and did this in the oven in a 9 x 11 glass pan at 400 degrees for 40 minutes.  I covered it with foil until the last ten minutes.  Instead of using oil and butter, I sprayed the pan and top of food with cooking spray.  I used reduced fat smoked sausage and Montreal Steak Seasoning.  It was very flavorful.

This is a great summer (grill) meal that my family loves. The only difference that I make is I use frozen (french) green beans and I add about 2 tsp. of garlic powder. I also use a foil pan (like a disposable cake pan)and grill it with the grill lid closed. I find it much easier than trying to roll up the foil; and the butter and grease from the kielbasa coat the bottom of the pan so you have little sticking/burning.

I love this recipe!  It would be great for camping, and I toss it with oil before I put it in foil to prevent it from sticking.  Also, spraying the foil with non-stick cooking spray helps alot!

Doubled the recipe for a family of 5 and still ran out!  (3 teenagers- go figure!)  Added 2 red bell peppers, 3 lemon cucumbers, a bunch of halved cherry tomatoes, medium chopped zucchini, a few shakes of crushed red pepper flakes, a handful of brown sugar, and a few tablespoons of chopped garlic.  (omitted butter)  I couldn't find fresh green beans so I used a half a bag of frozen and it worked just fine.  This is an awesome base recipe, but we have a garden full of veggies that needed to be eaten and we like a hint of sweet and spicy.

After tossing all the veggies with olive oil and seasonings, I double wrapped them in 4 large aluminum foil packets and did NOT add the extra water.  Adding tomatoes, peppers, and lemon cucumbers provided enough water.  

I have a 3-burner gas grill that usually runs hot so 6 minutes on low flame, turn for another 6, then turn for another six was perfect.  No mushy zucchini and perfectly done potatoes.

This is a very forgiving recipe, so feel free to experiment all you like with your veggies and seasonings!!  Just remember to treat your veggies right on the grill - cook 'em low and slow.  :-)~   

PS - If you are flipping them on the grill as I suggested, definitely use heavy duty foil!!  If the juices run out through a tong puncture, the grill will flame up and burn your packets and they will get too dry and over-done.

yummy! I also roasted this in the oven, as there is 20 inches of snow on top of our grill right now! I left off the butter, used olive oil, balsamic vinegar, basil, &  oregano to season. To the onion, green beans, and potato, I added a lot of fresh mushrooms and used turkey smoked sausage. I baked it covered for 20 and uncovered for another 25. We all loved the way this turned out! I will definitely make again!

This is delicious and quick to prepare.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and sprayed my foil with non-stick cooking spray.  I drizzeled with olive oil and omitted the butter.  I used grill seasoning in place of salt and pepper, which really jazzed up the flavor.  I also used some chicken stock I had on hand instead of water.

The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly.   It was good but a tad bland. The second time I threw in a packet of italian dressing mix and it turned out great.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I cooked mine in the oven, but used everything else as written.  The water, oil and butter made a delicious sauce.  I wrapped mine in foil just as the recipe said, however I set the foil wrapped supper in a 9X12 dish in a preheated 425 degree oven.  I cooked it for about 50 min. and then tore the top of foil open.  I planned on cooking for an additional 15 min. so the sausage could brown. It didn't need it. The sausage was already browned and so tender and good. The potatoes that had been cut into quarters was just right. This recipe was a big hit in our house and I plan on serving it often.

I thought this was a great & easy meal! Just made a few changes. Used 1 pound (fresh) green beans & 1 pound potatoes.
 I sprayed the foil with the non-stick spray.  My husband & I do not like onions, but I added a little onion powder, & garlic powder with some Lawry's seasoning salt to the beans & potatoes. Delicious!!!

I did this in the oven rather than grilling.  Made a few tweaks after reading many reviews.  Put in 9x13 pan covered with foil.  Cooked at 400 degrees for 45 mins, then uncovered and cooked for 15 more mins.  Used only 1/2 tsp of salt, but added several good shakes of garlic powder and cajun seasoning to it. Had some great heat!  Omitted the oil and just sprayed with Pam. Used turkey sausage to keep it a bit healthier.  Will make again!

Excellent!  I used a Hillshire Farms smoked sausage and it was delicious with this meal!  The only suggestions I would make are: 1) spray the foil with vegetable oil to prevent sticking, and 2) reduce the amount of salt and pepper.  It was pretty salty.  Will definitely make again!

Absolutely delicious! I roasted in the oven at 425 as other reviewers had suggested. But before I put the ingredients in the pan I first browned the sausage with worcestershire then removed it, added some butter and chopped garlic and sauteed my 2 cans of drained green beans, removed them and with a dab more butter browned my yellow potatoes with the onion. Then I mixed it all together in the roasting pan and covered with foil and cooked it for about 25 minutes. The whole family loved it! Even my toddlers! The flavor of the smoked sausage permeates the whole meal. I can see how this would be so good on the grill! Thanks Tonya for the new recipe!

I make this at least 1x a month & roast indoors @400. I omitted the butter & added 1 red bell pepper. First, I seared sausage in a nonstick oven proof skillet w/some Worcester sauce then removed the sausage & added a little EVOO to the pan, 4 tsp. minced garlic & the green beans to soften them up a bit. If I don't have fresh, I use Birdseye Steamfresh green beans. Next, I mixed in my potatoes, onions & sliced red bell pepper. Add seared sausage to the mixture, tossing all ingredients to coat. Covered pan w/aluminum foil and baked for 40 min; removing foil last 20 min. stirring occasionally. The flavors were sensational!

This is great for that one-dish-and-done dinner. I've also cooked it in the oven. Turning it over when it's wrapped in foil doesn't really work, cause the liquid leaks out (duh), but you can get away with stirring it and covering it back up. Otherwise the stuff on the bottom will burn.

I used apple chicken sausage, put it all together in an aluminum foil pan covered with more aluminum foil and put it in the coals of our campfire. It was sort of a pain to take out and the part closest to the hottest embers burned, but most of it didn't and it was an AMAZING dish that we'll be making again on our next camping trip.

This was fantastic!  This is step by step what I did so I can repeat it later. Preheat the oven to 425.  I used fresh green beans snipped and broke in half.  I sauteed the sliced smoked sausage with a couple shakes of Worcestershire sauce for 5 minutes while cutting the potatoes and onion. Put those in in a aluminum foil lined large glass dish. In the same pan, I sauteed cut red potatoes in a T of butter, salt and pepper for about 4 minutes, poured them in with the sausage.  Sauteed the fresh green beans with about 2 T garlic and olive oil for about 4 minutes.  Put those in with the sausage.  added maybe 1/4 cup water and 1 large onion cut in thick strips.  Stirred it all up. Covered with foil. baked for 25 minutes.  Checked for potato done-ness with fork... Add 10 minutes with foil off.  Delicious!

Not sure what I did wrong, but this really was not a good one for us. I cooked it in the oven in a roasting pan at 425 and perhaps the method on the grill would add the flavor the oven method lacked.

I made this over the weekend while camping. I split all the ingredients by 4 and made into individual foil packets, lots easier to maneuver on the grill that way, and we could just open our packets and eat right out of them so clean up was easy too!

This was very good.  I used the recipe as a starting point and changed it to my liking.  First, I seared the sausage in olive oil with garlic, and then added frozed green beans to the pan.  I placed 2 sliced onions at the bottom of a roasting pan, added all of the other ingredients (I added rosemary and a pinch of Tony Chachere's) and roasted it at 425 degrees for about 40 minutes.  The family really liked this dish.  Very easy.

Happy to see that someone else lives in an apartment (Zbales and qdog) both did it in an oven.  Can't wait to try it.  Looks real easy. Gave it 4 stars for the ease in fixing for oven cooking.

I did modify this a little bit (according to what I had on hand & based on reviews f/ those who cooked it in the oven)...I used 1 lb fresh green beans, 1 lb red potatoes & chopped sausage patties (didn't have links).  I sauted the beans in oil and garlic.  I tossed all ingredients in a 9x13 pan--added 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, and 2 tsp minced, dried onion.  (I don't like onions but like the flavor so I left out real onions.)  I covered w/ foil & baked 30 mins at 400, then uncovered and baked 15 minutes more.  Flavor was excellent--my husband & I both chowed it! :-)

A favorite in this house.  My husband and son could eat this 3 times a month.  I've made it in the oven, in the crock-pot, on the stovetop, but love it on the grill in the summer.  Thanks Tonya for sharing.

Since it was raining, I made this in the oven using a covered casserole dish. The only thing I changed was adding 1 tsp or Worcester sauce before baking. The resulting juices were outstanding!

I have to admit I thought green beans on the grill was weird when I first found this recipe. Instead of grilling mine, I baked it in a large covered multi-purpose pan. I added a drizzle of olive oil over the veggies instead of butter. I also sprinkled the veggies with a garlic & herb seasoning blend before baking. This stuff turned out SO yummy! It's easy, cheap and darn good food! One I will certainly keep making. Thanks for sharing it!

After reading several reviews I decided to roast in the oven (425 degrees) but it took about 75 minutes before the potatoes were done!  I used canned green beans(added after 1st 30 minutes), extra onion, garlic, italian seasoning, season salt and a T or so of butter. It tasted great, it just took forever.

This can easily be made more tasty by using white wine instead of water.  I also added soy sauce and crushed garlic for mucho flavor!  Also, only about 1/2 tsp. pepper is plenty.  Family loved it.

I premade this in individual packets and packed them in the cooler prior to heading out into the wild . They made the perfect camp fire dinners. It sure beat trying to pack condiments, buns, etc. Easy to cook and easy to clean up.

This was good, would make again. I added more potatoes & green beans than the recipe called for to make the servings less paltry.... we like our veggies! Note, a ring of smoked sausage is no longer 16 oz but 13 oz now.  Thanks for the recipe.

I decided to try and make exactly as recipe states but ended up using about 1 lb beans and 1 lb potatoes (cut in bite size pieces).  We cooked on indirect heat on a gas grill for 15 minutes on each side.  It came out fantastic.  Next time will add a little garlic and maybe a few sprinkles of beef bullion granules.  We had no problem with burning or sticking to the foil.  This recipe will definitely be added to our camping recipe list.

Very simple and delicious!  You don't always need a bunch of different seasonings and add-ins to make a yummy meal!  Flavors of each thing came through.  I did these in individual packets so each person could have their own.  Thanks!

This was great!  Can't wait to make it on our next camping trip.  I omitted the butter and tossed the potatoes with olive oil, rosemary, thyme, garlic salt & pepper then added the green beans & sausage.  Will add more green beans & sausage next time.

Prepared in oven and followed the advice of motherteresa with searing sausage, sauteing green beans and adding fresh garlic to taste and about 3/4 tsp of red pepper flakes for just a little kick.  It was OUTSTANDING and my only regret is I didn't make more for leftovers as we devoured it all in one sitting!  Will definitely make again and again...thanks for a great recipe!

Made as written and this was good. I did end up adding some additional seasonings in the end to give it more flavor but all in all I have no complaints.

This was awesome! I did make a few changes. I cook the potatoes a little before hand and I added a trio of peppers (red,green, yellow, onion, french green beans (fresh),onion, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper, 2 tbsp of dijon mustard, some drizzles of olive oil, and about a 1/2 cup of beef broth and some savory seasoning. Delicious! I also make a gravy from the juices in the dish by using some cornstarch. This is a huge hit at my house and a must try!

YUM!  Made them and they were delish and very filling!  Will season the potatoes next time.  But a very rustic yummy meal!  Thanks!  Will make again!  Plus the kids can pitch in to help make their own dinner!

This was awesome!  Left out the sausage becasue I am not a big fan, but this rest made a fantastic and simple side dish to "marinated spicy pork chops" (from this site).  Thanks for sharing.

Just tried this recipe tonight!  It was a delicious way to enjoy sausages and BBQ at the same time:)  The recipe was so simple, which was great, but also why I couldn't give it a 5 star rating.  I feel like it may have tasted better with some garlic, or some dill added to have a little more excitement.  The only thing to really flavour the dish was the polish sausage, which is great, but unless you get some sausage with every bite, the rest of the ingredients taste a little bland.  Will make again, but definitely will add some more seasoning to help balance out the flavours!

This is a great recipe.  Might sound odd, but I put all of these items along with corn on the cob in a large pot and boil!  Just add the green beans at the end so they don't overcook.  Delicious!

this is a great recipe that i made easier..instead of fresh green beans & potatoes, i used one can of drained green beans and one can of whole potatoes cut in half and seasoned with about 1 tablespoon of prepared dressing from a box of "suddenly" pasta salad and the rest of the ingredients. Wrapped tightly in aluminum foil and placed on grill 25-30 minutes, turning once half way through cooking time. Delicious served with the pasta salad and kabobs or other grilled meats!!

This was good, but it needs more flavour. It's a great starting point, though. I added red pepper and some zucchini I needed to used up. Next time, I will add some fresh herbs, garlic and maybe worcestershire sauce.

It came out great, but I did make some significant changes.  I preheated the oven to 425 degrees.  I used 1 pound potatoes, halved them, and sliced them into 3/4" pieces.  I used frankfurters instead of smoked sausage.  I sauteed the green beans and 2 minced garlic cloves in a skillet over high heat for 5 minutes.  Then I used the same pan to sear the franks in 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce.  I put the beans and the franks into a large bowl together with the potatoes, the onions, 1 Tbsp olive oil, 1/2 tsp thyme, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, and 1 tsp paprika.  I mixed it all together and put it into a greased casserole along with 1/3 cup water.  I covered it tightly for 25 minutes and continued to roast it uncovered for another 20 minutes. My husband and daughter loved it.

I rated this 5 stars as it is great as it is! I have over time been adjusting it to my families taste. I always add corn for texture and color. I also add broccoli, carrots & cauliflower to the mixture… If I have fresh I use those but if not frozen works just as well but do not add any water, it will have enough. I also use EVOO instead of Vegetable as this I thinks taste MUCH better and I do not use any butter. I put it all in a large bowel to mix well with some salt, pepper, garlic powder and Italian seasoning, if it taste good cold it will taste good hot… I bake mine in the oven at 450 for about 20 min’s with a sprayed foil cover so it wont get veggies stuck to it. Then I remove the cover and cook for about 10 min’s or until all veggies are done. In the summer when it is to hot to cook in the house I place the pan on a med-high heat on the grill and cook almost as long… This is the bomb in my house now! It is an all in one meal that EVERYONE loves! I never have left over’s and this makes much more then four servings, I would say like six. Tip: If using frozen veggies I add 1 whole bag of vegetable melody (Broccoli, cauliflower & carrots), half bag of beans and a 1/3 a bag of corn. I have also been known to throw in different kids of squash in it also. Don’t forget the potatoes I use two large or 4 small and leave the skin on YUMMY-YUMMY!!! Use your imagination & it will turn out great!

Nice easy recipe.  I used 2 cans of green beans (drained and rinsed) instead of fresh.  Also added minced garlic, fresh ground black pepper, and a little dried thyme.  I didn't add the water or the salt and thought the salt from the kielbasa was enough.  I will make this again.

This was okay.  It is a good, basic meal.  Nothing bad about it, but also nothing Wow, either.  It fit my son's tastes - he doesn't like fancy, spicy, or casseroles.  I will do this again sometime because it is fun, but I will work with the flavors a bit more - maybe add Italian dressing like someone mentioned.

I make many variations of this. We love it when we are camping! I have used all the ingredients listed + - (dependng on mood and what I have available) cauliflower, kielbasa, chicken, shrimp, crab, mushrooms, corn, hamburger, green peppers, sweet onions and different seasoning including: old bay seafood seasoning, tons of garlic, rosemary, italian seasoning, crushed red pepper etc etc. You can use differnt kinds of potatoes too, basicaly anything you want to add, feel free. I use a wide variety together or alone to change the tase/flavors so it seems like a new dish instead of the same old thing. Oh and french cut green beens are good too.

Oh my goodness - this is a GREAT meal! I made it just as the recipe suggested except I added 4 gloves of garlic, 4 tbsp of butter and the corn cobs as others suggested! It was sooooo good. It's also very easy clean up - especially if you use the foil bags. I will be making this over and over!

I made this twice in the oven at 400.  The first time I didn't cook the green beans and drippings with it.  The second time I did which made all the difference in the world. It went from great to omg!!!  First, I browned approximately 2 lbs of sweet Italian sausage in a pan with a little Worcestershire sauce.  Set the sausage aside in a oiled roasting pan.  Cut up 5 larger red skinned potatoes into 6 pieces each and sliced a large sweet Vidalia onion placed that on top of the sausage.  Lastly, I drained off the water from 2 cans of cut green beans and sauteed them in the sausage drippings with 4-5 cloves of garlic.  Once that softened but not browned, I poured it over the whole thing and sealed it with foil and baked for about 40 minutes.  So simple but would use this recipe to impress guests!  Sooooo good!!

An easy and awesome meal. I was fortunate to have a nice smoked sausage from the meat market, but I'm sure a Johnsonville smoke sausage would be just as good. Everything else I used were basic ingredients, red potatoes and fresh beans from the garden; I don't measure but use judgement according to how my family prefers things. This was a hit and I do plan to use it again.

This recipe is amazing!  I've cooked it on the grill and in my deep covered baker. Both were a huge hit with my family.

I followed this recipe as closely as I could with what I had on hand (dried minced onions, since I was out of fresh, frozen green beans I defrosted a few minutes before adding to the dish, only had 1/2 lb smoked sausage), and added a bit of olive oil (I had no butter), red bell peppers & garlic powder to boot. The lightning prevented grilling so I baked in a 13x9 dish @ 425, covered with foil for 35 minutes, uncovered, stirred, and continued baking uncovered for 20 minutes. It was FANTASTIC!! This was a snap to throw together, can easily be adjusted to add or subtract ingredients as desired, and the taste is wonderful. This is the best kind of recipe! Thank you Miss Tonya!

This was delicious, the only thing I did different was add more oil and omitted the water which is good if you want more carmelization on the onions and sausage. I also cooked for a little longer, if you don't I think the potatoes will not be very soft. I also added garlic powder and onion powder for extra flavor.

I needed to use up some fresh green beans, saw this recipe and fortunately had the smoked sausage in the fridge. I had to get it thrown together in about 5 minutes so I cut up the sausage, threw in a good handful of cut beans and cut up some potatoes (cut to same size as sausage). Threw all of it together along with the onion in a 9x13 pan, topped with seasonings, oil, butter and water and sealed with foil and popped it in the oven at 425 for about 30-45 minutes or till veggies were tender. It was great! The seasonings gave a lot of flavor...some might consider it a bit salty and peppery at 1 t. each but it all worked together flavorwise really well. Will probably try it on the grill sometime but the oven method worked great and it was so easy to throw everything in a pan, cover and bake. Very tasty recipe!

Excellent! The only minor changes I made were to use fresh bratwurst and purple potatoes and bake it in a casserole dish as some others have suggested. We served this over tortillas because they were there but it was fabulous by itself. So simply, so easy, and relatively healthy.

Used all the ingredients as listed except cooked it on the stove in a covered skillet. A very good and easy meal to prepare. This recipe will go into my winter rotation of meals.

I love this recipe almost as much as I love crock-pot green beans and ham!  My only change was to add some fresh cracked pepper!  Perfect served with a crusty dinner roll!

Excellent! I followed other readers and added 1# fresh green beans, Nathan's kielbasa, some leftover red bell pepper, a whole onion and about 4-5 large red potatoes. I sauteed the kielbasa in a bit of Worcestershire, and the beans in a a bit of olive oil, with minced garlic. Shook the potatoes in a large plastic bad with olive oil. Put the whole thing in a foil lined pan, sprinkled some cayenne, pepper and salt, and spray with some olive oil. Add about 1/4 c. water. Seal with foil, and cook at about 45 min at 425. Take off foil and cook an additional 15-20 min. Fantastic! A keeper for sure - and inexpensive!

I put everything in a baking dish covered with foil and cooked it in the oven at 425 for 30 minutes.  It was very yummy, but way too much pepper for me.  Next time I'd probably use half the pepper that it calls for.

Added red peppers and onion, I blanched the green beans and boiled potatoes for about 15 min. then assembled the packets. Grilled about 20 min, yummy and clean up is easy!
I never turn my oven on in the summer, so this is a great grill dinner all in one no matter how hot it is out side.

Too hot to deal with the grill today too, so I made this in the oven tonight. Baked at 400 for about an hour- 45 covered, 15 uncovered. It was AMAZING and my kiddos liked it so much it is ALL GONE.

Love this recipe!  It's fun to cook at home, but one of the best camping recipes I've found.  I prepared this at home and cooked it over the campfire by placing it on a grill and turning it periodically.  So fun and easy.

This was pretty good.  We made it while camping in a dutch oven.  I seasoned it with onion soup mix and added water as necessary while cooking.  The main problem was that the green beans cook way faster than everything else, although I think our fire was a little hot.

this is an awesome camping recipe-very little prep and you can (obviously) make it ahead so all you have to do is pull it out of the cooler and onto the fire. The salt and pepper, butter and evoo is all I used as seasoning and it was so good! I actually bought a package of mixed frozen veggies and put them in instead of just the green beans and it was sooo good! We will be using this idea the next time we go camping!

This was amazing!  I didn't really think the potatoes would be done but they were perfect.  I quartered an onion and added some garlic powder and a seasoning mix and this was perfect.  Some of it was pretty burned so we will put it on the grill for less time next time.  Can't wait to make this again!  So easy and so good.

this recipe was delicious. Everyone in my home ate it. There was a mmmmmmm with every bit. We fallowed the recipe but put a sweet wine but not too sweet and some seasoning salt in it. It was to die for. I would have this every night and not get tired of it.

We LOVED this! Made the recipe as is, except added cajun/creole seasoning and baked it in the oven! And I added big chunks (so they didnt get mushy) of fresh zucchini and yellow squash I needed to use up! I will def. make this again, thanks!

Amazing! I made it for my family tonight and everyone loved it! I changed a few things: 3 baking potatoes replaced the red ones, two cans of green beans rather than fresh ones, and 2 yellow onions rather than just the one. I agree with others, it's a little light on the meat... however, I'd suggest cutting the sausage lengthwise, then into pieces, rather than the suggested slice size (or just add more meat :)).  Overall, supper fast and easy. Everything cooked perfectly on the grill (20ish minutes at between 450-475 degrees).   I will definitely be making this again soon. I loved the amount of flavor, given how few ingredients were in it. Glad it can be made in an oven but the grill worked perfectly.   Great summer recipe!! (Added bonus - Little or NO CLEANUP!)

Excellent!  All I did was add Tony's seasoning and minced garlic.....yummy!  If you have sausage lovers, double it.  I always make cornbread to go with it.

This is an awesome recipe. One variation I like is to substitute andouille sausage and sprinkle a little "slap ya mamma" spices on top...Tasty!

This was okay. I added a lot of flavor to it that I think took it from ordinary to better. Seared the sausage in Worcestershire sauce, soy and balsamic vinegar. Added lots of spices and garlic, of course. Very much so a meat and potatoes type of meal.

LOVE how easy this was and there were no dishes after!  I had to make a few changes so I only rated it a 4.  I used canned green beans instead of fresh because thats all I had.  I added Lawry's seasoning salt for a little more taste and a little more butter for the potatoes.  For some reason I wasn't sure about the water so I never added it.  Came out wonderful!!  Don't forget to spray your foil with some Pam and a little shredded cheese on top never hurts!!!  I will make this again.

We first tried this recipe at home on the grill as suggested and WOW we ended up making this for a church dinner and now our Family Reunion is coming up (My 1st one in 20 years) and this is what I am making.  You are most appreciated for your art of cooking.

This is fast, easy, and so very tasty!  The only change I made was to add fresh minced garlic to the dish.  I used several cloves.  It turned out great and my family loved it.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!

My grill was out so I tried to follow the recipe, but in the oven.  Apparently I'm not very good with aluminum foil, so I ended up dumping it into my stonware 9x13 pan and covering it with foil and it turned out so comforting and delicious!  Definitely a keeper.

YUMMY!!!  So easy and quick to put together and easy clean up afterwards.  The veggies were all steamed to perfection, meat juicy and so flavorful.  We layered onion, potato and then green beans and sausage.  We also buttered the foil before layering.  We will do these again and again.

I made this recipe 3 times in the past 2 weeks!  First time ever that we had no leftovers and my family was asking for more! Cooks very well in a crock pot and takes about 4 hours if the ingredients are put in frozen(I prepared 4 meals in freezer bags and just stuck them in the freezer), I put the butter in after it's done cooking.

This was wonderful! I made two batches and all of our kids ate this. Let me tell you that is amazing considering we have 2 sets of twins and they are 3years old and 4 years old. Ofcourse I seperated the stuff for them they arent really into mixing the foods yet :)

I made this on the grill just as written except I only had french style green beans! And it was delicious! When my husband says a recipe with smoked sausage is a "keeper," that makes me happy because I love smoked sausage! Thanks so much.

Good recipe! I gave it 4 stars because I also felt it needed a little tweeking...
Added garlic to the mix and at my son's suggesion, used beer in a second packet to determine the difference. Great idea! The beer really made the difference. He told me that he and his friends often buy the large coiled sausage from the grocery, poke a hole in it to add beer, and cook the entire package on the grill for just a short time.  The beer adds just enough umph to the sausage.  Thanks for the basic recipe but I think I will keep using the beer!

Being a great fan of ham, green beans and potatoes (a common meal in Pennsylvania) I figured this had to be as good if not better., and it was indeed better.  I made the recipe as stated with the exception of putting more potato in and adding two large cloves of garlic sliced.  What a great change from the normal grilled meals.  It really didn't take as long to cook as I had thought that it would.  Thanks!

This came out more fantastic than I could have imagined!

I bought a package of smoked sausages from the store and the rest of the ingredients I got from our local farmer's market (as well as some excellent corn).  I used a double wrapping of foil to make sure nothing leaked when I flipped it and left it on the grill for 30 minutes.  The sausages and onions were just starting to caramelize and the potatoes and beans were tender.

This is a perfect summer meal!

This was really good.  I loved the flavor of the green beans cooked with the sausage.  It was way too much pepper for our tastes, that made it a little too spicy.   Next time I will use just a dash of pepper.  I also think it would be good to melt the butter with oil in a bowl, add seasonings, then add meat in vegetables, stir to coat.  Then pour onto the foil.  This would get rid of the pockets of salt caused by uneven sprinkling.  With those changes I know this recipe will become a favorite.

Oh my goodness! Very yummy! Added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and baked in 400 degree oven covered with foil about 50 min, then uncovered about 30 more! Very nice and brown and carmelized! Will make over and over again! Thanks for such a good and easy recipe!

We made this while camping. Made according to recipe, but with a very large, pre-packaged foil bag. Used the exact ingredients, but used 1-1/4 lbs. potatoes and 1-lb. green beans. I used Eckrich brand (because it was on sale) smoked sausage and it had a great flavor. My potatoes were kind of large, when quartered, so we grilled 15 minutes on one side, then flipped. That was actually too long: green beans were overcooked and all was starting to burn. Will do again, but will cook 10 min, flip and 10 more,only. The flavor was still very good (even though a little was burned on one side)and we will make again, but will try freezing the green beans, prior to adding, so they are not overcoooked.

This was very good and I loved it because I had no dishes to clean up!  I did use kielbasa instead of sausage and made 5 individual packets.  I put this on my list for camping this summer and can't wait to make it again!  Thanks!

This was very good and very basic.  We can do a lot of tweaking with this, which makes my picky hubby happy.  I divided up the ingredients and made 4 individual packets (I didn't read that part of the instructions first) and baked it in the oven (too cold to grill last night!) at 450 for about 20 minutes and it was perfectly done.

Update:  I made this again last night and instead of salt and pepper, I used grill seasoning.  It was the PERFECT thing the dish needed to add a bit of flavor to everything without overdoing it!

Excellent camping recipe - easy to prep and easy cleanup!!  Followed others suggestions of additional herbs, crushed red pepper and substituting italian dressing for the oil.  Used turkey kielbasa to cut down on the fat content.

I used a chicken and spinach sausage and added about 1/2 cup of italian dressing, double wrapped with foil and threw on the grill over the fire at the camp site and it was great! Easy and the kids loved the change from burgers and hot dogs. The people we were camping with were jealous of our wonderful meal. This is a keeper.

Yum, yum, yum.  Added 2 cloves of sliced garlic and used lite smoked sausage.  Out metal BBQ tongs ripped the heavy-duty foil, but this still turned out delicious and pretty juicy.  I think this would have been great with corn on the cob.

This recipe was awesome! I'm in college and I am starting to spread my wings with cooking...needless to say it's not working the way I planned...until this recipe! It was easy and absolutely delicious and I didn't screw anything up! The great thing about this recipe is you can mix/match with veggies and meat too...try chicken, brawts, mushrooms, squash, different seasonings...it's great! Perfect for spring/summer and hungry college kids!

Very good, and easy to throw together. Normally my husband passes on any dish that has anything that resembles a vegetable but the sausage gave the potatoes and green beans an awesome flavor. Next time I will add a little more garlic but we will make this again! Oh and my bake time was longer, I must not have cut the red potatoes up small enough. All in all, very good and quick clean up!! ??

Made a roast last night so I used those veggies and then added corn on the cob and smoked beef kiobasa. The juices from the roast went into the veggies and it was a great way to incorporate leftovers into a new meal. My husband and kids couldn’t get enough.

This meal is absolutely fantastic. My family says it’s one of their favorite dinners. I use two types of sausage for greater  complexity of flavors. I also slice the sausage into half moon pieces and sauté it with chopped garlic and a few teaspoons of worsteshire before adding it to the foil packs.

Good recipe. You can adjust flavor by adding your own choice of spices. I make something similar in the skillet but without the green beans, this was a great change. My husband ate it all straight out of the serving bowl. Great for camping trips too.

This was a great and easy recipe for camping!
 I cleaned the potatoes and green beans at home then put the green beans in our cooler in a lock and lock brand container to keep water out.
I used turkey smoked sausage to reduce the fat content slightly. 
We cooked this on our little propane camp grill out in the woods of the Allegheny National Forest. We made it into two doubled foil packets. Flipped them over after 15 minutes. Done and ready to eat at 33 minutes total. We both really enjoyed these. 
Thanks for a recipe we will use again for sure!

So good and easy. Great for conference call nights. Skip all the water, it's not needed when using  foil  packs and bake for an hour at 425. Use sweet artisan sausage like pineapple bacon and sprinkle with maple bacon seasoning. Or sweet Italian sausage with Italian seasonings. I added corn cobs, fresh green beans, onion, lots of halved mushrooms, red potatoes. Really could throw whatever sounds good into the pack. Makes good leftovers too.

This was an easy recipe and pretty tasty. Like other reviewers I made it in the oven because our grill is put away for the winter. I did substitute broccoli since our family doesn't like green beans. I agree with other reviewers that you don't need to add much water, if any at all. I followed the recipe and ended up with a half inch of water in the pouch when I was done. Also, it took 45 minutes in total to cook and quite a bit of seasoning added once the meal was on our plates, because even with the onion, garlic, salt, seasoning salt, and chilies in the sausage, it was still quite bland. My husband added fresh grated Parmesan cheese and seemed to like it enough after that.

Nice, easy, and quick meal that is great for the summer. I hate mushy, over cooked green beans, so I cut the potatoes into 1 inch pieces to be able to reduce the cooking time. I also used turkey kielbasa to be a little healthier.

I made this with the following adaptations. Preheat the oven to 425.  Meanwhile, cut the potatoes & add to a 13x9 pan. Sear the sausage in some Worcestershire sauce, add to the potatoes.  Throw onions in skillet until the start to soften, then add to the 13x9 pan.  In skillet, add a teaspoon of olive oil, clove of minced garlic and sauté green beans. Add to the 13x9 pan. Drizzle with olive oil.  Sprinkle with seasoned salt, regular salt and pepper.  Toss to coat.  Add 1/3 cup water.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes.  Test potatoes for doneness.

Great Recipe!  I took the advice of one of the reviewers and seared the sausage  and then baked the mixture.  I also added cajun seasoning, parsley, about half an onion, a red bell pepper and 5 stalks of celery for additional flavor.

Love this stuff! I make it every time we go camping! I chop everything up ahead of time put in a big Baggie to marinate. I add some red peppers, yellow squash and mushrooms . The smell that this dish makes brings all the other campers over to our campsite wondering what I'm making. I use a cast iron pot to make it  Delish!!

Great weeknight recipe!  I added a twist by sprinkling a package of zesty Italian dry salad dressing mix and drizzling a 1/2 stick of melted butter over it all!  OMG is was SO GOOD!

Flavors are good in this dish, great starting point. I added red and green peppers and left out the green beans (not a favorite in our house).

I love this recipe and usually do it in the oven, as one review suggested (425 degrees for 45-50 min, with the last 5-10 min open).  I always spray the foil with non-stick spray before piling on everything.  It is often hard for me to find good green beans, so I have used asparagus and it turns out great.  After I cut off the woody end, I just leave it long, toss them in oil, salt, and pepper with the potatoes and pile it on top of the sausage before sealing it up and baking/grilling.  

Also, I often omit the water, onion, and butter (just use olive oil), and use two packages of sausage instead of one. 

Basically, I just use a bag of redskin potatoes, cut potatoes in half, toss in oil, salt and pepper with the green beans or asparagus, place potatoes on bottom, then sausage, and top with vegetables. I seal up with foil and grill/bake.

Just tried this recipe.  Fantastic!!!!  Used the oven instead of the grill.  Added an extra onion because we are onion lovers.  Motherteresa's comments were spot on.  We used hot Italian sausage and substituted carrots for green beans.  Also added 1 tsp garlic powder.  Searing the sausage in worchestershire sauce was a great idea.  Thank you, for all those who made suggestions.  This will be a favourite from now on.

Love this! Easy,fast,delicious and versatile. I sub sweet potatoes or carrots for the green beans although those are great too. I imagine you can use a huge variety of vegetables with this and they would all be good:) Thanks!

Made this on the grill this weekend to test drive it for a rafting trip  - delicious! So simple, but really good. Perfect for car camping, rafting or other outdoor activity. Even good enough to make at home. Spraying the foil with nonstick spray is a good tip and I will add more potatoes next time.

5 stars for sure!  I have never changed the recipe EXCEPT instead of using foil, I put all ingredients into a foil PAN covered with aluminum foil (leave a little corner open for air) and then cook over the open fire when camping.  It has worked every time.  My kids LOVE this meal!

First time we made this was while camping. We cooked on a flat propane grill.  We really enjoyed the meal; especially with Heinz 57 or Ketchup (you know kids).  The second time we made it was in the oven at home.  Both times it was good but, of course, a good hot meal while up in the mountains is especially yummy! :)

Great recipe.  I made this with my cubscouts tonight. We added ground beef and carrots and omitted the potatoes. Each boy made his own packet and seasoned it.  Then we put it in the hot coals and let it cook for about 30mins.  It came out great.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  And the clean up was super easy.

I thought this was very, very good. I only gave it 4 stars because my daughter and hubby thought it was bland and my son and I loved it. I used skinless kielbasa. I did as other reviewers mentioned and sauteed the sausage in worsterchire sauce first. I then removed from skillet, added some fresh minced garlic and sauteed the onions and potatoes for a few minutes then added the green beans (I used canned). After 5 minutes I combined all in the dish, added a packet of Zesty Italian seasoning, covered and baked 45 minutes, removed the foil and baked an additional 15 minutes. Sooo easy and soo good!!

I followed this recipe exactly the way it's written and baked it in the oven covered with foil.  After seeing all the great reviews I decided to triple it for my family of 7 with hopes of having leftovers for lunch the next day - no such luck - the family loved it.  Even my 'green bean hater' pushed the green beans aside and had two helpings!  This recipe is a keeper!  Many thanks to the author for sharing it.

This recipe is wonderful and easy for a large group of people.  I usually add chicken and use turkey kielbasa sausage instead of smoked sausage.  It is ALWAYS a hit in my house!

Delish!  I cooked it in the oven at 425 - it took about 60 minutes for the potatoes to cook through.  I seared the sausage with worschestire sauce (yum) and sauted the green beans with olive oil and garlic.  I will make it again and again!

This so did not  work for me on the grill.  The foil package was too difficult to flip, when trying to flip, butter and water leaked out. It was a disaster.  That being said, I did try it again in the oven at 400 for 45 mins with a foil cover and 15 mins without the foil. It turned out GREAT!  I do think next time I may parboil the potatoes for a few minutes to help them cook a little faster.

Great starter idea- I used Greek seasoning for all the vegies and barbecued the sausages separately. I also added mushrooms and red peppers- delicious!

This was just okay.  Maybe I did something wrong.  The dish was very salty for our taste.  I enjoyed the ability to of making ONE dish.  I'll try to modify it a little next time.

very good and easy.  Seems to be easy to switch up depending on ingredients on-hand.  This will be going into our monthly rotation.

Oh man was this delish!! We added some eggplant and bell pepper to the mix and eliminated the water (since there is a lot of water in both of those veggies).  We also added a little minced garlic.  The ONLY problem I had with this was that we didn't make a double batch and we all wanted more!  Next time we'll know better!  So simple and so hearty - it really hit the spot!

This turned out very, very good. I added 1 tsp of minced garlic and seasoned with oregano and a little seasoning salt as well. Used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil and cooked it in the oven as other reviewers suggested. Thanks for the recipe!

Super yummy! I added some garlic and a little seasoning to mine. Not sure if it needed it though, it was very tasty. I only had small foil, so I made 2 medium foil packs on the grill instead of one big one.

OMG!!! This is so good and so easy! I made this the night before and my BF put it on the grill for 20 minutes so dinner was ready when i got home from work the next day. We both loved it! Here in Lancaster County, PA we are big on Ham & Green Beans and this was a real nice change. We will be making this over the camp fire on one of our many trips tps to the PA mts. Thanks!

This was really good! I had to make one change - which was to use fresh Italian sausage instead of the smoked sausage (not a big fan) and it turned out well. I wanted more bang for my buck veggie-wise, so I added fresh button mushrooms and sliced red onion to the packets too ... wow! The veggies were just amazing, particularly the mushrooms! A definite keeper!

WOW!! Perfectly delicious! Perfectly easy!! Perfectly summer!! I followed the recipe and didn't add anything. The sausage gives the veggies a wonderfully smoked flavor. You don't need any other spices. Husband and 2 teen sons had one complaint - I didn't double the recipe.

I will be making this often. Quick and easy and no pans to clean up. I used Hillshire Beef Smoked Sausage. Followed the recipe but cut red potatoes into bite-sized pieces, 2 cans of green beans, 1 can of corn, chopped onion, sprinkled a little Worchestershire sauce over it. I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil. Cooked it on the grill for 40 minutes. Great recipe

Excellent! We used cocktail sausages and I added an onion cut up into wedges. I wish I had made more sauce, but that was an operator error. We will do this again - thanks for the recipe!

Great tasting and easy way to have some veggies (I also added frozen corn kernels midway through). To speed things up I partially cooked the cut up potatoes in the microwave first. Glad I listened to reviews and sauteed the sausage in Worchestershire sauce, it really was good and I never would have thought to do that. I doubled the recipe and put in a large rimmed baking sheet and cooked in the oven (grilled foil packets rarely turn out well for me). We were hungry and couldn't wait any longer so I turned the broiler on and it crisped the top up. Can't wait to make again.

When I first looked at this recipe I thought "how good can it be?" It turned out to be very good. I followed the recipe but instead of butter I squirted about a tablespoon or so of squeeze margarine on it. We used the leftovers for breakfast burritos the following morning.

Made this for guests and kids. Everyone really liked it. It is a tasty and very easy 1-dish meal. It's also portable. Before or after you cook it, you can transport your packets to the park or pool easily.

This was VERY good. Made exactly as written except cooked on grill on medium heat for 45 min instead of high for 30 min. Also, forgot to flip over half-way through, but it didn't matter.  Everyone in family loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this with frozen mixed veggies instead of just fresh green beans. I sliced my potatoes and cooked them in the microwave with the butter prior to baking. I layered the potatoes on the bottom, then the mixed veggies, and then the sausage. I baked in the oven at 425 covered w/ foil for 30 minutes. I then uncovered & cooked for 10 more minutes. Everything was nicely cooked through. For my own serving I added parmesan cheese, but my husband just ate it as is (plus extra salt & pepper). He liked it an its a nice change from chicken!

Really good!  I followed the recipe exactly, for once and it was well worth the 5 stars.  I may add some garlic next time just for a change.

I read a lot of the reviews and was almost confused because of all the variations.. but it was great because I fig how could I mess it up. I used Chicken Sausage (which I hadn't read that anyone else used that)broke it up and blended fresh garlic, s+p and cooked in a little olive oil, meanwhile I was cooking potatos (sliced as suggested) 1 red pepper, 1 onion, about a cup of green beans, crushed red pepper, tbsp of butter in the oven at 425.. Once the chicken sausage was cooked I just added it to the dish in the over.. This was really good amd I would def make it again..

Great! Cooked on the grill and everything turned out so flavorful. I tried it in the oven, but it didn't come out the same, and the cooking time was much longer.

This is a very good recipe. It is easily changed to suite your needs. In the winter, I like to make it in the oven and I generally just use whatever type of potato or spices I happen to have on hand. Very yummy.

Great combination.  I don't think I added enough seasoning, because it was a bit bland to us.  I think it would be great with some garlic or garlic powder in it.  Great for camping, fast and easy.

This is a great recipe!  Our family of 5 eats this at least every other week.  I heat olive oil in a skillet, then add the garlic.  Then I saute the onions until tender, then add 2 cans of green beans and let them cook a little bit to take on the flavor.  I add the potaotes & sausage as I cut them, then add 1/2 a cup of water and some black peper, stir and move to the 400 degree oven for 45 minutes--there are never any leftovers!

This recipe is so easy and good! I've made it twice (picky husband likes it, it's a keeper!), both times in the oven as I had no propane, and the only thing I would change is to omit the oil. The butter and grease from the sausage is plenty.  Also, for a bit of extra taste, I threw in garlic, red pepper flakes and fresh thyme.  I baked it in a glass baking dish covered with foil at 400 for close to 45 minutes, it does take a while.

Good and easy.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions, and cooked in the oven at 425.  I should have microwaved the potatoes first though, because they still weren't quite done after 40 minutes and the green beans were wilting.  Also, I seared the sausage with Worcestershire sauce and some fresh garlic before I put everything in the oven.  This recipe tasted great, even if it took longer to cook than I would have liked.

Yum !!!   Very easy to make and tasted great !!  We cut the veggies up and put them in a bowl with the sausage...added a little bit of  oil, then seasoned them with a little bit of cayenne pepper and cajun seasoning.  We had forgotten to add water but it wasn't needed.   Everything turned out great !!  We will make this again -- thank you for sharing !!

Holy cow! This was incredible! My family couldn't stop raving about how delicious the flavor was on this recipe. I doubled it, and cooked in the oven as others recommended, but had to cook about 25 min extra without foil on top to get the potatoes to cook from doubling the recipe! But, it was still amazing! Thanks!

This was so easy and good. Made it in the oven (400 degrees for about half an hour after I did the potatoes in the microwave for two minutes). I wanted to replace the water with chicken broth but was out; will definitely do that next time. I did sprinkle some onion powder over the top, and changed the sausage to turkey sausage. It was all very good.

Loved it!  Family wanted more sausage, though, so next time I'll add in a second pound.  Cooked this in the oven at 425 as other reviewers did.

This is a tasty, beautiful dish!  The only problem I had was the potatoes did not get cooked through (using a gas grill).  I put the dish in the microwave for 5 minutes after removing from grill, and it was perfect!  Instead of fresh green beans, I used frozen "fine" greenbeans and they were great!  All of the flavors blended perfectly.

This was absolutely delicious and so easy!  I don't have a grill, so I just wrapped everything in the foil, put it in a big baking pan, and baked at 425 for 35 minutes, opening the top up for the last 10 minutes.

This was really good, made it in the oven.  The sausage flavor mingles over all the veggies and it tastes great.  I put in in a 400 degree oven for 40 mins, the potatoes were still firm so put it back in for and additional 20 mins at 425.  Can't wait to make this on a camping trip!

Love it!  I've made it three times now, and it hasn't tasted the same yet because I keep trying different seasonings.  I also add corn on the cob, and I only take the foil off for a few minutes because I think the sausage stays juicier if you leave it on.  Great recipe, thanks for posting!

I tweaked this some.  I used chicken broth and used probably a little more than 1/3 cup because I wanted broth with mine.  I sliced my potatoes thin like someone suggested.  Sauteed garlic in butter and added on top of everything. S&P according to our taste.  I cooked in an 450 degree oven because Hurricane Gustav is sending us rain in South Arkansas and I don't won't to mess with the grill.  I didn't think my husband would like this at all but  loved it. Said it was a keeper and went back for seconds.  Next time I am going to try to sneak turkey sausage into it to make it a little more heart happy!  Thanks for the Keeper

Good recipe. I doubled the oil/butter and seasonings (+ red pepper flakes, fresh parsley and fresh oregano), then tossed all together before putting in foil and added the water. I used fresh potatoes, green beans, carrots and onions straight from the garden. YUM!! I think red pepper strips would be a great addition.

I made this twice, once in a 9x13 pan the oven with cheddar brats and once wrapped in foil on the grill with regular bratwurst.  Both times it was delicious, but I think I will always use cheddar brats from now on.  I love the cheesy addition.

This recipe was very tasty.  I prepared it pretty much as written, except I divided it into three foil packets instead of one big one.  Even though I scorched the beans slightly, they still had a great flavor.  I'm sure I'll try it again.

A nice quick recipe.  I used chicken sausage instead.  This is a nice twist on the typical sausage w/ pepper & onion.

Fantastic recipe! I make this in a foil packet over a charcoal grill almost every time we go camping.  We love it!

Great idea!  Not having a grill, I took other's suggestions and baked this in the oven instead.  I used a Pyrex dish and baked for 30 mins with foil on top, then 15 mins after removing the foil.  I used Italian-flavored turkey sausage, which stayed nice and moist. I also added 2 minced cloves of garlic and since I used marsala cooking wine instead of water, I omitted the salt. I also cut the potatoes in smaller chunks - - next time I'll put them in the dish first to be closer to the juices. Very tasty and the house smelled great.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Made this last night, though not on the grill. Used all the same ingredients and made in a large skillet on the stove. Once the sausage browned a bit and onions were clear, I added a bit of water along with the cut up potatoes. Covered the skillet and let the potatoes cook thru. Very good. A keeper. Oh, and I used Kielbasa...it have great flavor to the rest of the ingredients!

Easy prep for a great meal.  I used turkey kielbasa as a healthier sausage, and farmer's market fresh veggies.  I ran out of room in my first foil packet and made a smaller one too.  I cooked over medium heat on my grill and it charred the smaller pouch.  The larger one turned out perfectly though.  Next time, I'll be more careful of the temp, time and pouch size balance.  This was even better as leftovers.

I must have done something wrong...the potatoes were still hard like they hadn't been cooked and it was just bland.  We picked the smoked sausage out and just ate that.  I was so excited for this recipe to be good, too.

Absolutely loved it.  I used the spicy (chipotle blend) sausage and made it awsome.  I also added about 4 crushed garlic cloves.

This is very tasty, especially for such minimal effort!  It was a little peppery, though.  I have made this many times, but with more veggies.  My alterations:  1 lb. green beans, 1 lb potatoes (4 avg. size), omit salt, 3/4 t. black pepper, omit oil, omit butter.
I make this in a dutch oven at home, too.

This was so easy and tasty!  I didn't have red potatoes, so I used regular russets, and I stir-fried chopped onions, garlic and a can of green beans in a pan before adding to the potatoes and sausage.  If I'd read the other reviews and sprayed the foil first, it would've turned out perfectly.  After 30 minutes on the grill, everything was the right consistency and flavor, but a lot of the sausages stuck to the foil and got burned.  My fault, though.

This was delicious.  I had to use canned green beans since the fresh ones at the store didn't look good.  I used the juice from the canned green beans in place of the water.  If I did it again w/ the canned green beans, I would cut back the salt to 1/2 t.  Thank you for a great recipe.  My husband and son yummed it right up.

I made this in a pot on the stove.  Only had 1 can of green beans and added 1 can of pinto beans both with their juices.  I used 6 potatoes cubed, a whole package of polska kielbasa, and a little salt.  Covered and simmered for 30 minutes.  This was an easy dish and the flavor was great.  It actually turned out a little soupy which was fine by me.  My husband said only thing he would do different is to eliminate the green beans (and he loves green beans.)  I'll make again for sure since it requires so few ingredients and you can choose other sausages for different flavors.

My husband and I make this quite a bit with a few modifications.  First, we put in about half the amount of water, then I add half of a dry onion soup mix and 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce and mix well. I also added a little extra butter and subbed olive oil for vegetable oil. Good base recipe-we just needed a bit more flavor.

This is a great recipe for camping. The ingredients are easy to pack into camp and there is no cleanup needed. Its even easier if you cut everything up before going. I have always made it on the campfire using ground beef, this was the first time I tried it with sausage.  It was very good.  I would have to recommend buying good sausage, nothing generic.  This gives it a much better flavor.  Also, adding garlic powder helps it out quite a bit.

Made this recipe the other night.  Didn't have any for leftovers!  I substituted kielbasa for sausage...it was delicious.  I actually cooked mine over indirect heat for the whole time, then took the kielbasa out and threw it on the grill itself just to brown it a bit.  One thing to consider, make sure you have a large enough packet to place all your ingredients in.   I wonder if those Reynolds Wrap packets would work? This recipe is a keeper!!!

I thought this was delicious!  My husband wouldve given it a 3 1/2 though so I went with a 4. 
I added corn as mentioned by another review as well as garlic and alittle more butter and less water.  I also doubled the foil and cooked it for about 10 minutes longer and turned it often.
I will make this again, even my toddler liked it!

I must have done something wrong, as I thought this was very difficult and didn't turn out as expected. First, with the water in there, everything sort of steamed rather than roasted, and didn't get any grill flavor. The packet was nearly impossible to turn as it was big and hot and very floppy. The stuff that was on the bottom got burned and stuck to the foil. No one ate any of it. I'm sure it was just me, but I won't be making this again.

This is really easy, but lacked a lot of flavor, I thought.  If I make it again, I'll make sure I throw on a lot of spice.  Otherwise, a good camping dinner.

So easy to make and so good.  I did have a little problem with burning on whatever was on the bottom but that was my fault as I had the grill on too high.  Will definetly make again.  Thanks Tonya

This recipe is EXCELLENT and quick. If you have a few people over and need to make something quick that will get "ooohs" and "aaaahs" this is the recipe for you. My 7 year old daughter even cleared her plate and wanted seconds.

I doubled the recipe to accommodate my guests but left the recipe as written.  I made a gravy on the side in case anyone wanted it for potatoes.  I will make it again.

Absolutely delicious! My fiancé and I made this and tweaked it just a little. We added corn, garlic cloves, and Cajun seasoning. We also grilled brats instead of using the sausage. The char from the grill on those brats really set it off! We will definitely be making this again. Perfect meal for a football Sunday!

Extremely simple and straightforward. The flavor was good, but I think by playing with the type of sausage you use might significantly improve it. Perhaps a kielbasa, smoked pork sausage (I used beef), or even turkey. I will certainly experiment with it because it’s perfect for camping!

Gave this to my (non-cooking) daughter to make for dinner. She prepared it in the oven rather than grilling. It was FABULOUS. The potatoes took the smoky flavor of the sausage. The beans were al dente. The sausage took on a slight crispiness. 
I'm adding this dish to our regular menu.

This took way longer to cook than 30 minutes. We had to put it back on the grill for another half hour. The potatoes were rock hard. Disappointed in a seemingly quick meal.

Turned out great!!! One of our favorite Fall/Winter dinners!! I put a few cups of chicken broth in the bottom of the crock pot, cooked on high for 3.5 hours- no extra salt added, just pepper! So tasty!!! Saved this recipe for next time!

Omitted water, butter and oil.   Cooked 30 minutes on high heat on grill.  Nothing really browned or carmelized, but vegetables were tender and all was delicious.

I make this all the time.  We use kielbasa sometimes Andouille.  You can only mess this up if you use sausage that has no flavor.  Also, you can use herbs and spices, salt and pepper.  Sometimes, I use rosemary or oregano, also basil.  They can liven up a dish.

Very good and room for many other ingredients and tastes. I did mine in the oven at 400 in a casserole dish and covered. It took 40 min.  Just be sure your potatoes are tender. Done. 
 You can broil for 5 min. uncovered if you like that texture. I did.

I also simmer some baby carrots  and add with the green beans and potatoes.  Great for an easy dinner.  Also very good done over an open fire or on the grill in foil.

This is easy and delicious.  I did bake it in an uncovered skillet at 425 for almost an hour instead of grilling it and I did use frozen green beans.  It probably would have been even better, had I not made those changes.  Next time, I think I'll add some bell peppers and some jalapeno.

I made this in my crockpot for a  camping meal. I did brown my sausage prior to putting in the crockpot, and instead of water I added beef broth instead same amount just broth instead of water. I feel like it gave it more flavor. I cooked it for approx. 7 hours on high or number 4 setting, in my crockpot. All pots vary, so you may want to check your doneness at the halfway mark. Was consumed with delight by invited  campers. The recipe was requested by them and the husband even had his wife make it for him a week later. :)She says, usually he doesn't like smoked sausage!

My husband and I had a similar skillet at Silver Dollar City and this is pretty much like it. We liked it very much. I followed "mothertheresa's" instructions for baking instead of grilling. I'll make it again for sure.

This one is a keeper. I'm looking for meals to cook on my outdoor grill. I don't like cooking indoors during the summer months.

I used frozen spinach instead of fresh green beans because I had spinach on hand other than that I followed the recipe. I think it took about 45 minutes to cook on low heat and the potatoes were nice and soft. 

I do strongly suggest that you use cooking spray in the foil.

Family loved it.

I really liked this dish. I love one dish wonders!  My table had the ages of 6-65 and everyone loved it. I only had Andouille sausage so that is the only change I made. I will definitely make this again and again!

This is great! What an easy foil packet to put together before going to work in the morning: just come home, put the grill on, and pop it on the grate. We'll be having this alot in the future!

I like these rustic, comfort food recipes. I hope people are aware of the dangers of cooking, especially on open flame, while using aluminum foil.

Very tasty and quick!  Following other suggestions, I browned smoked turkey sausage in worcesteshire sauce and added garlic and red sweet peppers.  Then put it in the oven until the potatoes were done - my family really liked it.

I added some peppers to this dish and made a little gravy (beef broth with a teaspoon of flour) to make it a little more stew like but not too much. I also added Cajun seasoning for some flare! Husband loved it and we will be making it again!

My husband and I actually thought this was rather blah. As someone who is trying to eat healthy the majority of the time, this would not be on the list but the picture made this dish look so tempting. I should have added more green beans. My favorite part was the smoked kielbasa, which I did cook in Worcestershire sauce and that gave the meat a nice flavor.  Probably will not make it again...

Made this for my husband, he liked it a lot. I made it in the oven and it came out well. I did add corn on the cob as I saw other reviews had tried it, I don't know if my corn was just bad or if it cooked too long, but the corn did not turn out well. Next time I will just follow the recipe.

Quick and easy recipe.  Followed step 2 but also added garlic powder and sprinkled Worcestershire sauce on top of it.  Baked in 425 degree oven for 40 minutes covered and then uncovered for 10 minutes.  Delicious and the fresh green beans were crispy, just the way we like them.

Great recipe! Add your own seasonings or herbs and it is so delicious on the grill, at the campsite after a busy day of activities!!! YUM! Can't wait to make it again!!!!
I do not use water with it. Just spray some EVOO on the foil, pile stuff on with a little bit of butter and grill. We love herbs, so I always add some on top of our potatoes and other vegetables,  grilled, backed or cooked in a pot. 
Also very easy to prepare ahead of time and have ready at the  campsite. I can't believe I didn't check AR before for specific camping recipes! What was I thinking? LOL. Of course they would have that!!!! It's AR! My favorite recipe site!

Made this on the big green egg and it turned out awesome. I added cherry tomatoes and italian dressing seasoning. It took a bit longer than what the recipe said to fully cook the potatoes. This was super yummy and has become a staple in our house!

Love this recipe. It was so easy & is a great base for many combinations. I added some seasoning salt & some Herb & Garlic dip mix from epicure. We loved it. The potatoes were perfectly done & the beans were not wilted.

I have made this recipe several times.  I enjoy making this recipe.  The first time I made this.  I wondered how this would go over on my family.  It seemed like a weird combination and putting it on the grill seemed even weirder.  
This went over very well with my family.  The second time I made this.  Oh we're having this again...big grins.  I love making this recipe because it is very easy to make.  The only change I made the second time I added a little more potato and used frozen green beans.  I think this would be a good use for summer squash.

Great concept.  Instead of the water, I use beer in the bottom of the pan for flavor,  with garlic and herb seasoning.  My husband and I make this all that time with rave reviews.  The beer is something you should try, especially if you're a fan of steam pots at Joe's crab shack.

This was so quick and easy. I didn't have fresh beans on hand so I used fresh carrots instead. I like how the vegetables picked up the flavor of the sausage, it was great. Will definitely make again.

While camping, we needed to bring a potluck dish to a family reunion. We brought along the ingredients and made this in our trusty dutch oven. Turned out great, except we didn't get to have leftovers! The only change we've made over the years is to add some crushed rosemary for a more savory flavor. Canned green beans also work well, but don't give the texture variation.

Delicious! Only differences I made were instead of regular salt I used Lawry's garlic salt with parsley and I sprinkled ground cayenne pepper on it before sealing! Yummy and thank you for the recipe!

This was excellent - full of flavour!  We used fresh green beans right out of our garden, Kielbasa and new red potatoes.  We were using a small, charcoal grill (Hibachi-style) so hubby left it on for almost double the amount of time and it was just perfect.

I made these while camping and, with reviewer help, made a few changes. I boiled the potatoes first in a pot of water over a Coleman stove for about 15 minutes, or until soft. I then made packets of green beans, potatoes, butter and onions. I omitted the vegetable oil. I tightly sealed and put over a hot campfire for another 20 minutes turning frequently. I needed to add much more salt. I used the leftovers (there was a lot leftover) for potato and onion omelets the next day.

This will be in our regular rotation this summer.  Needed something quick on the grill and this was perfect.  The only slight negative was that the green beans got a little overdone by the time the potatoes and sausage were done.  Next time, I'll cut the potatoes and sausage into slightly smaller pieces so everything gets done at the same time nicely.  Took one reveiwer's suggestion and mixed the potatoes, green beans and onions with a (very) little bit of Italian dressing.  Then layered the potatoes, sausages on top of those, then green beans and onions and then sprinkled a little bit of fresh garlic over all before sealing.  I realized after we have devoured everything that I forgot the butter, but we didn't miss it!

Very tasty, especially when you add some extra crushed red pepper flakes for pizazz...also recommend slicing potatoes smaller than quarters so they cook faster, adding the for the last 20 minutes only and cooking the entire dish 5-10 minutes longer than the original recipe called for. I made it in my oven at 425, for a total of 55 minutes: 20 without sausage but covered w/foil, 20 with sausage, still covered, and 15 minutes without the foil covering. It's worth it.

I never thought of cooking this on the grill but it's great! For many years I made it in a pot on the stove using chicken, beef or vegetable broth for the liquid and no oil or butter. So hearty, simple and delicious! Thanks for the fun twist.

I was out of foil, so I used a heavy dutch oven on the grill, which I uncovered for the last 10 minutes to brown it a little.  It was delicious.  I used half the salt and it was fine.

This was perfect for our camping trip this past weekend. We made it ahead of time and cooked it over the fire. The whole family loved it. Even had leftovers for breakfast! I did substitute canned green beans for fresh out of laziness.

Fantastic all-in-one recipe!  I decided to reduce the fat and caloric value of the sausage and instead use Smoked Turkey Sausage and it tasted like the real deal with all the seasonings.

YUM! My MIL recently gave me a package of kielbasa that I couldn't decide what to do with. This recipe came up in my search results, so I decided to give it a try. I am SOOOOO glad I did!!! It's amazing how basic ingredients can taste so darn good! If you're in a pinch and need a cheap and filling meal, this is just the ticket. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Tonya! I know I'll be turning to this often now that I am back to work again! :-)

This was a great base recipe that I'll have fun playing with. I did it in the oven at 400, 30 minutes covered and 30 minutes uncovered. That wasn't planned, I just figured since the potatoes were still hard, I'd try uncovered. I added chunks of sweet peppers, some rosemary and thyme, then subbed white wine for the water.

Next time, I'll skip the liquid, throw it on a jelly roll pan and add the green beans on during the last 10 minutes.

So EASY and my  family loved this recipe, cannot beat that combination. I have prepared this both on the grill and in the oven (400 degrees 30 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered.)  It's great both ways.  I also season this with garlic powder.

I used a roast pan in the oven. It was a great meal and easy to prepare. If you use the oven it doesn't need that much water added to it. I forgot to take the lid off for the remaining 15 minutes so mine ended up a little watery.

Delicious!  It definitely needed more potatoes though.  I have made this a few times and now use 2 pounds of potatoes and I use seasoned salt in place of regular salt, skip the paprika and dot the top with a couple Tablespoons of butter.  I also don't cook it on the grill, instead I preheat the oven to 425 and bake in a 9x13 pan covered with foil for 30 minutes (I leave out the water).  Then I remove the foil and bake uncovered for another 30 minutes.  FYI, I have also used canned green beans when I haven't had fresh on hand and they work just as well - just make sure you drain them and don't add them to the dish until the last 30 minutes of baking.  It is a no-fuss meal that always gets rave reviews from my kids (5 & 7) and most recently my 16-month old - he ate everything on his plate and nothing was tossed overboard - that is huge!

This was so good. I used sweet Italian sausage and baked it in the oven at 400 degrees for one hour, removing the foil cover for the last 15 minutes. Turned out great!

Great taste and convenience!  Like other reviewers, I added garlic, baked it in a 375º oven, and it was a hit.  Thanks for a great recipe for busy families.

YUM!!  This is a great summer meal, especially when you want something of substance but not spending a lot of time making it.  I did two things differently--I sprayed the foil with Pam to prevent sticking, and I substituted smoked sausage for turkey smoked sausage.  DH and I absolutely LOVED it!  Definitely a keeper in our recipe box!

This was great!  I cooked it in the oven as well b/c I didn't feel like grilling.  I didn't have green beans so I just did it without them.  I did add some sliced banana peppers and minced garlic.  I used garden fresh red potatoes as well.  Very good recipe!

This was an excellent mixed grill. My family just raved about the taste. I used (Sams club) ck. sauage w/ mozzarella & garlic to make it more healthy. Oh what a flavor. Thank you

This is an excellent recipe - very quick and easy. I used venison sausage, so should not have added the salt, but everyone loved it. The potatoes and green beans were perfectly cooked and clean-up was a breeze!

this recipe is okay but there are many that are much easier and taste better. This lacked flavor....maybe I need to use a spicy sausage or jalpeno sausage next time. Needed flavor, great man food. Don't think we'll make this one again. But...its worth a try.

I followed this recipe fairly closely but added minced garlic, about a teaspoon, and cajun seasoning sprinkled over all of it before grilling.  Also left out the salt and olive oil as the sausage had plenty of salt for us and cooked out enough oil/grease to do the job. Was very good but next time I will add baby carrots to the mix.  Cooking time was 30 minutes and I let it sit in the closed up foil for another five minutes before serving. Will definitely be making this again.

This one was really good, quick, and easy. I would recommend a little more water in each packet to prevent some of the sausage and green beans from burning. I had a few burnt ones in mine, but the potatoes were cooked just right so I couldn't have taken it off the grill sooner. Overall very good!

Made it again tonight, this time in the oven.  I didn't pay that much attention to how much of each ingredient I was adding, just kept cutting until it looked right.  I cooked it about 50 minutes at 425, but it might have been better to take it out a few minutes earlier.  I did not add any additional spices; the salt and pepper are enough with a flavorful sausage.  I also used the oil, butter and water as called for.

While good, this recipe was lacking something I couldn't put my finger on while I was eating it, but I think next time I'm going to add chili powder and paprika into the spices.

When over 200 folks review a recipe as being quite good, you know it's a winner.  It was raining and cooking outdoors wasn't an option when I made this dish.  I sliced the onions and sausage and browned them in a large casserole dutch oven while the sliced potatoes were cooking in the microwave.  When they were done, I added them and a tsp. of minced garlic and 2 cans of green beans and put the DO in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes with no lid.  Easy and quick.  I served it with some fried cabbage cooked with some browned diced bacon.

Excellent!  So easy and great flavor.  I put beans on bottom, pour some teriyake sauce on, put potatoes on top of beans, salted, peppered & dill weed on top of potatoes, then onion, then sausage (turkey w/sun dried tomoates & asiago cheese), and drizzled with olive oil.  YUMMY!!!!  30 minutes on low grill was perfecto!

I made this exactly like the recipe stated. It was excellent. Mine burnt a little cooking it on high for 30 minutes. Next time I will cook on medium for 35-40 minutes. It could have been my grill just gets a little hotter then others no big deal. Thanks sooo much for the great recipe.

Made this last night for dinner.  My family cleaned it up! Next time I'm going to have to double the recipe. I didn't use any oil, didn't need it, and I added some extras just because I had them on hand.  Peppers, garlic, a bit of pepper sauce and asparagus.

I used turkey sausage and sauteed the pieces in olive oil cooking spray with lots of minced garlic and red pepper flakes. I used one pound each: turkey sausage, red potatoes, and fresh green beans, used two onions, and drizzled with olive oil (NO BUTTER), and seasoned with Greek seasoning along with the salt and pepper. Also, I doubled the amount of water. Baked at 425 for 40 minutes, covered, stirring halfway through. Then uncovered, and baked for another 10. Tasty!

This is pretty good, and easy.  I just add whatever veggies I have on hand, plus minced garlic.  I also add cajun seasoning for a little kick, a couple dashes Worcestershire sauce, and a little beer in each packet. I use only olive oil, instead of the butter and vegetable oil.  It's perfect for camping!

This was good, I thought it was a bit greasy.  I had to bake it in the oven due to time restrictions, and I also had to use canned beans.  We have made this a few times and it is good every time...

This is a super easy and delicious dish! I have some German friends that make a soup with these ingrediants and it is also delicious. I made very slight modification by cooking the green beans in a pan with some bacon grease and minced garlic.  I barely cooked them just to get them started.  I also used the Hillshire Farms Lil Smokies as that is what I had in the freezer.  The kids really loved them and it was easy. I think for better flavor I will use a higher quality sausage next time but for camping the lil smokies would work out great!

I made this as a side dish and did not want 500 calories a serving for a side dish.  I had, on hand, left over grilled sausage that I ground up in the food processor.  I used about a tablespoon of the ground, grilled sausage per serving.  Yummy!

I opted to make this for two reasons:  A) It's very similar to a dish I make on the stove that we love, and B) we were going camping and we could cook it over a fire.  I did change it up a bit to be like what we make at home, so I did not use green beans. Instead, I chopped 2 onions and 1 green pepper and threw that in with turkey sausage and potatoes.  Didn't have many extra spices, so we just topped it with salt, pepper, butter and a little beer and it was absolutely wonderful!  This is a great recipe if you are going to be camping and want something easy and good to cook over the fire.  I'm sure it's just as good with green beans! We will make this on every camping trip from here on out!

This is a great dish! I cooked it inside in a roasting pan. Seared sausage first in olive oil to get a nice brown color then moved to roasting pan. In same pan, sauteed garlic, mushrooms and green beans for 5 min in olive oil. Added all ingredients to roasting pan, put a few pats of butter on top and cooked at 425 for 20 min covered with foil then 15 uncovered. Delish!

One of my favorite "don't feel like cooking tonight" recipes.  I usually add some rosemary and paprika as well as onions and squash (sometime a little soft after cooking)

I know this is probably better on the grill but had to settle for a pot on the stove and it was still outstanding!  Put everything in the pot and covered it -- used three cans of green beans instead of fresh-- and wow!  So much flavor for such a quick, easy, inexpensive meal.

This made a great meal for the family.  We threw in some kidney beans too and it was so pretty with all the colors.  I've made this on the grill and I've baked it in the oven.  The grill is way better.

Great recipe! On the grill, in the oven and especially over a campfire. I use a garlic olive oil instead of the vegetable oil and butter. Other than that I leave it alone. The sausage adds a great flavor to the veggies. so it really doesn't need anything else.

this was great!! everyone went back for seconds and thats a huge deal for us because our sons are very picky eaters. i don't have an outdoor grill but it was great on our indoor grill. i did add a little more butter for a little extra flavor for the potatoes. i also used canned french style green beans. the only thing i found difficult was flipping it so i just open up the aluminum foil and stirred it about 4 times. it did take a little longer to cook but i supposed thats because of our grill. will definetly make this again!

My family really likes this combo.  I omit the butter and water and just use olive oil and use frozen green beans.  I also make it in one big pan in my oven and add lots of fresh garlic.

wow..my family gobbled this up like mad!  I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used oregano and garlic powder and omitted the veg. oil, and used EVOO instead, no butter.  I'm thinking that it would be fine with no changes.  It's one of those recipes that doesn't sound like a big deal but man..it's amazing!!

This is a great, easy one-pot meal that was a big hit with everyone!  I used frozen green beans so that they would be more firm, and beer instead of water.  I added a splash of red wine vinegar and worcestershire sauce for some additional flavor.  It was delicious!

This was really good and easy, after top-and-tailing the green beans. The only thine I didn't like was that you were supposed to flip over the packet but the top was open. I did try to close the top but the aluminum foil was hot and it was impossible to do with oven mitts on. So with mine I just moved the packets around a bit and then left them to do their thing. It worked really well, there was a couple of burnt bits but all around it was great. My dad doesn't like dry meals so I also made some packet gravy for him but it was peppercorn and that with chipolte sausages was quick a combo! Really spicy, so next time I will use sausages that aren't as spicy, but I recommend this dish. It really is delicious.

This was so simple and yet so delish! The kids (16, 8 and 7) all loved it! The potatoes didn't need any of our normal toppings (butter, sour cream, etc).

I doubled the recipe and I think I messed up because it was tooooo peppery. But it was so good we still ate it. Can't wait to make this while camping.

Oh, one more thing. I tossed the veggies and meat in the oil. (also the salt n pepper) much easier and no problem with sticking.

This recipe hit the spot.  I sliced the potatoes for faster cooking and next time I will use an aluminum bag as it was a pain getting this off the grill.

Great Recipe. It was delicious and required very little time to prepare. I looked at some of the other reviews and borrowed some of their ideas as well a couple of my own. Here are the changes I made: used canned beans, also 8 oz of canned corn, a fresh green pepper. I lightly sauteed these items with the onions. Before putting it on the grill, I added one teaspoon of granulated garlic and a teaspoon of chilli powder to make it more spicy. Cooked it on the BBQ grill for about 35 mins.

This was great! I needed a quick and easy dinner for me to prepare and my husband to cook while I was at work. I had some when I got home and it was awesome! My husband and 2 daughters loved it as well. I omitted the onion because I didn't have any and used regular potatoes. Absolutely perfect!

This was a decent recipe.  My potatoes were a little mushy, but otherwise it was a huge hit with the family.  I would make it again, but next time I might make some a adjustments like other people  did. Thanks for the recipe.

I chose to make this in the oven and it wasn't bad.  I didn't have fresh green beans so I tried it with canned beans and I thought they were the worst part of all.  They turned out mushy!  If I make this again, I will make sure to use fresh green beans!!  I also added two cloves of garlic, minced and it was a good thing because other wise it would have been very bland.

This is indeed a family favorite at our house.  I have made it several times.  The first time I omitted the water & butter.  Big mistake!!  It was good but my beans were dark (okay burned).  Since then, we made the recipe as directed & it turned out perfect.  We always use the "hot" sausage & add a little garlic.  FABULOUS!

Surprisingly good.  Added another potato and cooked it in the oven.  Next time will add more onion and season with garlic powder or fresh garlic which should make this a 5 in my book.

This is a very flavorful and easy recipe! I didn't have an outdoor grill so I used my oven.  425 degrees and cooking for about 30 to 40 minutes did well except that the potatoes didn't get done, even though everything else did.  I'd recommend putting the spuds in the microwave for a few minutes beforehand, or cut them in thin slices.

I found this recipe to be easy and great.  I used turkey sausage, the turkey sausage is about 100 cal. instead of smoked sausage.

This recipe was pretty good. I will probably make this again. I did not feel that the grill added anything extra to the flavor, but I did also grill some corn on the cobb as someone else suggested. Good idea.

My family loved this even my picky 2 yr old. I played with the recipe a little by using white wine instead of water, 4 garlic cloves, Italian seasoning, season salt, and canned green beans. I sautéed the green beans with butter and garlic. I also poured evoo on everything before baking in a roasting pan for about 40 minutes.

This was so good and so easy! This is a perfect Lazy meal. I baked this in the oven at 350 for about 55 minutes. I used green beans, sliced up a sweet onion , a few chicken turkey sausages, halved red potatoes,  corn on the cob (chopped into hunks) garlic powder, Worchestshire sauce, kosher salt, black pepper and red pepper flakes. Placed all of this on a cookie sheet, covered with foil and baked for about 40-45 minutes and then took the foil off for the last 10-15. I have leftovers that I cannot wait to have.

I made this last night and loved the ease of this fresh ingredient recipe.  I loved the way the sausage browned crisp on the foil.  The dish smelled wonderful when we opened the foil packet.  I will take a suggestion from another reviewer next time and add corn on the cob.  I am sure this recipe will be a 5 star with it.

This was great. I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegtable oil and I also used cajun smoked sausage. My children loved it. This is definitely a keeper!! Grilling time was about 50 minutes.

A tasty meal.  More like a 3.5 stars but I'll give it 4 because it was good.  I did make this in the oven (425 for 30mins covered and 10mins uncovered) and added 3 cloves of garlic and a green pepper. We all agreed it was too greasy though.  Don't know if I would make this again but if I do I might try using italian dressing instead of all of the fats (as suggested by another reviewer).

Delicious!  Sometimes you just want a recipe that is easy, quick to make, but still yummy...this is it.  The only thing I did differently was that I didn't add water.  I have made this both on the grill and in the oven at 450 for about 30 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I ended up using canned beans but, they worked great.  This is even great the day after re-heated in the oven or on the stove in a frying pan.  My husband was very happy and believe me when I say that is a difficult thing to achieve when it comes to food.

Delicious! I used canned green beans instead of fresh. Substituted italian dressing for the oil and added some crushed red pepper flakes. Placed ingredients in a 13x9" pan covered with foil and baked at 400 degrees for 30-40 minutes and then for an additional 10 minutes uncovered. Very easy! Am excited to try this on the grill as well!

The changes I made: roasted potatoes in oven, steamed green beans, used Kielbasa.  Satueed everything in frying pan with little oil and salt, butter, paprika, minced garlic.  I actually didn't eat it, but my brother in law said it was decent.  Thank you.

I made this one the grill and it had really good smokey flavor and no mess in the kitchen. Then tried it in the oven during the winter. Easy to prepare and has really good flavor. Even the kids liked it.

I was all ready to make this for supper today when the barbecue ran out of propane.  But thankfully I had read a review from someone who cooked it in an oven, so that's what I did, and it turned out great!  If it's this good in the oven, I can't wait until I can try it on the grill.

This was a very easy meal that tasted pretty good, not spectacular, but good.  Nothing was overdone or raw, and clean up was a snap.  We grilled it over indirect heat.

I don't understand all the 5-star ratings.  While it was ok tasting, it was nothing I'd rush to make again soon.  I'd suggest turning this often to prevent burning and making sure it is very tightly closed.  If I did make this again I'd add some cheddar cheese.

I didn't try recipe as is, but this is a five star concept. I use mild italian sausage instead, a slew of veggies, typically double salt and bake at 400 for 45 minutes (uncovered last 10). Next time I make this I'll steam green beans for about 10 minutes then put together.

Super Duper!  Yes, I said it.  My SO and I made two different batches because I like spicy and he like sweet sausages.  I think mine came out better because the sausage flavors everything.  Buy good and flavorful sausage for this recipe.  Corn is a bonus!  I ate my whole packet and was in complete shock that I ate that much!
Thanks Tonya, this is a keeper!

We enjoyed this a great deal. Might consider a little less onion, but all in all a great recipe.

Yummy! For a low fat alternative, we used chicken sausage instead of the recommended sausage...it was terrific!
