I never thought I'd like bean salad!  This was great - although I didn't use quite as much sugar (about 1/2 cup) and I used a little more vegetable oil (again, about 1/2 cup).  I wonder what it would be like with balsamic or red wine vinegar?  Thanks.

I cut this recipe in half, added carrots, corn, and cucumbers.
I also added celery seed to my dressing/ brine, and heated it on the stove to dissolve the sugar so it wasn't granular.
My sister in law loved and so did I, and normally I HATE bean salads.

I'm glad I tried this salad and it turned out excellent. However, for $4.88 I can buy a big jar of 4 bean salad at Sam's Club - half the cost of the ingredients to make this recipe.

Used black eyed peas, kidney and green beans as I did't have any of the others. Was delicious. Can't wait to make again.

I had to make a few adjustments because I live in Argentina now and the food variety is not as great. I basically just picked 4 different types of beans, whatever I could get. I had to skipe the pimiento peppers too. I used red wine vinegar and less sugar and it still turned out really tasty! I don't eat much meat so this is a great way to get protein and a perfect summer dish.

Well ! My husband just couldn't eat it. My 1.5 year old and I could eat a little and now I have the entire amount in the refrigerator. I don't know what to do.

Tastes like it should!  Hubby asks for it. Make mine simple, just beans, onions and dressing. Tastes like Mom made it.

AWESOME salad! Having to watch my fats, sodium, and spices so this was a wonderful find. Made it last night and just had some for breakfast! Paired it with a little bow-tie pasta with garlic and enjoyed a quick meal for the first time in weeks!

I hate bean salad....until I made this one!  This is a keeper and so easy to throw together.  The onions, celery, bell pepper, and pimento really add a nice touch.  Plus, I bought pimentos that were already chopped so I just had to drain them.  I don't like onions so I added half and that was enough for my liking.  I was also intimidated by the amount of sugar to add so I added 1/2 cup and then a little more from there.  Altogether I didn't have more than 3/4 cup of sugar and that was enough for me.  Everything else was perfect!
