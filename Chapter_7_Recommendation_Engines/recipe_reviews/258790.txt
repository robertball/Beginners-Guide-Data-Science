This was easy to make and tasted fine.. the issue I had was it was way too soft. There is another similar recipe online that uses nearly twice the amount of powdered sugar as this recipe and I agree .. more sugar is needed to make this a consistency other than like raw cookie dough.... taste is good, not beany. and do add the nuts.. again, more than the recipe calls for will help

This was a good recipe. I like the fact it has more protein due to the beans.
