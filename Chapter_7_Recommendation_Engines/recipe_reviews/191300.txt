Great recipe! I just tweaked a couple things for taste. I reduced the oregano to about 2 tsp and I made sure I got greek-style yogurt.  Another thing--this salad is much better the second day! I was disappointed last night, but today I was very happy with the flavor.

Unique with the yogurt, I can heartily recommend this one.  Swap out the yogurt for mayo if you are so inclined.  I added the juice of 2 medium oranges.
