Loved it! Made this for my daughter's birthday and it was delicious! We dusted it with powdered sugar and topped it with sliced berries. Thank you for sharing.

My family liked this cake. A little bit on the dry side. I made cupcakes and topped with some whipped cream and a strawberry.

This is a super-easy, super-yummy cake! I wasn't so worried about being healthy, so I used regular all-purpose flour, as well as using both 2% and whole milk. Very great, has turned out every time! Very moist and fluffy, and not too sweet.

Everyone LOVES this recipe!!! I use regular all-purpose flour and they are still amazing. Other than changing the flour the recipe always comes out perfect. Some times I add sprinkles to make it like confetti and that's always a hit!

I made them as cupcakes, and they came out great! Light and not too sweet. I added raspberry extract instead of vanilla for a fun, fruity taste. My only complaint is they fell quite a bit so they weren't as fluffy as I had hoped.

The consistency was closer to cornbread than cake. It was not light and fluffy at all. It made a decent tasting bread but was not cake-like at all.

really great recipe.  I used raw sugar had to beat the sugar and butter for a long time, 1 part soy whole wheat flour (already blended flour), 1 part white flour and lactose free milk and lactose free butter (homemade from another recipe) and a hand full of lactose free chocolate chips.

Very nice, light texture. I substituted buttermilk for milk. Also put a vanilla glaze on top. Delicious!

I made these as cupcakes. They tasted good and I love that they are healthier than a lot of other cake recipes. 
However, I let them bake for too long. They didn't look done when I took them out of the oven (I set the timer for the time suggested), but the toothpick came out clean. It did have a sponge texture,  but the taste was still good. 
I will definitely make these again!

Very compact and thick, didn't care for it much. Cake is supposed to be light and fluffy. Although it was easy to make and that was nice.

This tastes like a plain pancake but in cupcake form. As I ate one, that's exactly what I said to myself, "Hmmm, this tastes like pancakes without butter and syrup." Needs work to taste like cupcakes, but I haven't tried to make changes yet.

substituted stevia for the sugar, coconut oil for the butter due to dietary restrictions in the house.  It seemed very plain so I also threw in some dried cranberries.  Was not sweet, so I think I need to add more sweetener of some kind to the recipe.  Maybe applesauce instead of the coconut oil next time as well.  This recipe was a great starting point for working with substutions!

I made this recipe with white flour instead, and used almond extract because I was out of vanilla. the almond added a very tasty alternative!

I'm praying it turns out ok I didn't realize there was a difference in whole wheat flour versus whole wheat pastry flour.
