Recipe to note to previous reviewer: This is my recipe and I actually use Cool Ranch Doritos in this. Try different flavors and see which one you like best. I have used everything from plain Fritos to BBQ flavored corn chips, but the Cool Ranch remains our fav. ~Tan

Or use Harvest Cheddar Sun Chips! I love the taste of cool ranch doritos, but its so distinctive and almost too strong.

Thought this was great!  Next time I'll rev up the chili powder a tad but the combo of ranch tortilla chips & the zip of the chili powder makes a very bland fish very good.

It was ok. It seemed like it was missing something. But couldn't figure it out. I have no idea where you could find rach torilla chip's. Where we live we don't have those. And one point in time we had ranch corn chip's but they were only limited time. So the only think I could find to use was cool ranch dorito's.

Yummy! I used my favorite regular corn chips (Juanita's) and threw in some cheese flavored French's onions. This was so tasty. I also made a quick sauce out of mexican style sour cream and salsa which I think added a final touch. I will definitely make again.

Super Easy!  I needed mine to be gluten free so I used plain corn tortilla crumbs (you can get them in the bread crumb aisle) and added ranch flavored popcorn seasoning.  Excellent!

Fantastic catfish recipe - and catfish is my favorite fish. I usually make it by dredging it in cornmeal and pan
Frying it.  Boring!  So I was thrilled to find a recipe so different.  I used Cool Ranch crumbs and lot of chili mupowder, including chipotle chilli powder. My son, who hates fish, asked me to make it again soon.  But as we were licking our lips. My devious mind was thinking of "improvements".   When I made it next, I made a red sauce with lots of cilantro to spread over the crisp fish.  I also topped each filet with a spoonful of sour cream and one of guacamole. The coating on the fish stayed crisp, ,All flavors worked together to make one of the yummiest fish dishes I've ever had.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Fantastic dish!  Love how the tortilla chips added their own touch of spices to this.  Will make again for sure.

It needs some kind of cheese added whether it be in the chips, onions or just plain shredded.

Very tasty.  Will make this one again.  Did not use oil.  Added a little milk to the egg.  Used nacho flavored Doritos.

I just tried this using the exact recipe but next time I'll heat up the spices. The doritos lose a bit of taste while cooking but it was pretty good. Good enough to go into my Recipe Box!

I thought this was just OK, but that's just my personal tastes. I made it exactly as written, except using a little less catfish. I had two huge filets totaling about 1 2/3 pounds, so I cut each of them in half.
I wound up baking the fish for 15 minutes. Breaded/coated dishes don't usually turn out well for me, but this one did - the coating adhered and baked well. It's just that "ranch" flavored chips are hardly my favorite, so the flavor was just OK to me. I love the spicy nacho flavored chips though, so perhaps I'll try again with those.
