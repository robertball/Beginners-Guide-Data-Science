I grew up on these and they are absolutely wonderful! Most eggroll recipes do not include the rice noodles but they should because it adds so much more texture to the eggrolls. Because our family is full of "hot heads" we usually serve this with a mixture of Korean hot red bean paste, sesame seed oil, and a little soy sauce. Kamsa hamnida!!!

These were pretty good when paired with sauce. (i used a gyoza dipping sauce from this site) The zucchini makes them nice and moist on the inside and the tofu and egg help keep it together. The only thing i would do differently is pulse the rice noodles in a food processor a few times to get smaller pieces so that you dont get a long noodle piece in the middle of the roll.

Korean egg rolls are one of my absolute favorites.  Our minister and his wife taught our church ladies how to make these when I was a little girl.  When my birthday came around, this was the dish I requested.  Ours are made with meat and veggies.

Pretty good, not a ton of flavor without something to dip them in. This recipe (for 6) made about 200 wontons! Just a spoonful in each wrapper, but I was shocked! I'm not sure if there's a good way to save this...it would take us about 4 days to eat all of these!

These were pretty good - a little bland for us.  Next time I would add some ginger and some more sesame oil & soy sauce.   The number of servings off - as an appetizer these would serve a crowd.

Really really good! I loved these. I made a smaller batch and just eyed the amount of ingredients vs following the amounts written in the recipe. Also I didn't have any noodles so I substituted some sticky rice instead and they were delicious. Much better than my regular Chinese egg role recipe. I dipped them in Thai sweet chili sauce - so tasty. Thank you for sharing!

This recipe was excellent! My husband who doesn't like eggrolls enjoyed chowing down on these. The one change I did make was not adding the tofu, as we're not big on tofu. Despite the fact that it was all veggies, my husband actually thought there was meat in it, it was just that flavorful.

This is DELICIOUS! Definitely one I am going to save for good. We did, however, make some moderate changes. Instead of firm tofu, we used "meatless griller strips", i.e. fake chicken strips. We cooked those up first and chopped them up into small pieces. We also used 6 oz. of noodles instead of 4. Also, we used olive oil and 1/4 of red cabbage and 1/4 of green cabbage.

I will admit, I would probably cut this recipe in half. It is just my boyfriend and I and this was waaayyy too much. It would be good if you are planning to make something for an office potluck or something social like that.

I'm not sure how anything with a whole tablespoon of fresh ground black pepper could be bland as previous posters thought..but just in case I made one change.. I did not have any plain tofu on hand. What I had were veggie burgers (tofu and veggies) or spicy black bean burgers. (Tofu,black beans and spice). So..since previous posters thought they were bland I went with the black bean burgers and crumbled them up.Neither my daughter nor I cared for the texture of the noodles in it....I'll stick to ones with veggies in them.

My kidlets prepared these. I used regular square wrappers. The recipe is forgiving. As I was frying the triangles, the insides started to ooze out but would stay attached to the wonton wrappers. A bit bland so I served with watered down sweet soy sauce. Next time I'll try the sweet chile sauce and/or sweet and sour sauce.
