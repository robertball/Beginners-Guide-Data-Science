I was very disappointed with this recipe.  Far from "melting in your mouth," these eggs were like eating cold lumps of egg yolk-flavored butter.  Everyone tried one, and then politely refused to eat the rest.  We'll stick with the more traditional recipes for this one.

I tried. I really did. I'll stick to my old stand-by of Mayo, Dijon, onion powder, salt and pepper with a slice of olive.

I did make a few changes as suggested by other reviewers. Substitution of 1/2c Best Foods Mayonniase for the butter. I was out of mustard powder and substituted 2 tsps Dijon then I added 1/2 tsp of white vinegar.  The results were excellent and I had more than enough filling for the nine eggs that I needed for my egg plate.  I garnished with paprika and Voila!

This recipe has a VERY subtle taste that isn't present until after your second or third egg.  Not reccommended for those looking for a "kick" in their deviled eggs.  Not bad, just a little bland.

I was having some family over for dinner and while I do not enjoy eggs of any type myself, the family goes nuts for eggs. My partner tried these as soon as they were done and said they tasted like egg flavoured buttercream. Not a bad thing in his opinion. He felt maybe some people might like them saltier, but we used ground coriander as we had no celery salt. He also felt maybe a little tang, like vinegar or a shot of mayo might be nice. Overall though, he thought they we unique and buttery. Yum.

I prepared these for a backyard barbecue. I boiled two dozen eggs, thinking that my hubby would have leftover Deviled Eggs. I was so wrong! Using real butter made for a wonderful appetizer and these were gone within thirty minutes.

I loved the addition of hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce.  I was not quite sure about using butter, so I substituted mayo instead.  Very tasty.

Hi, I found this recipe when searching for an addition to deviled eggs since I didn't have quite enough mayo for my usual recipe. I took a chance and added some melted butter to finish mine off. This is WONDERFUL! The butter adds a richness that we loved. I think using mayonaise AND melted butter is a keeper!

These had a nice flavour but were too weak. We changed the recipe to half mayonnaise but my husband says the traditional style are better.

Not EXCELLENT but a NICE change.  I too wasn't sure about the butter, so I used mayo instead and all other ingredients as called for.  A little salty, but I'll definitely use this recipe again and maybe tweak the celery salt or Worchestershire sauce to cut out a little salt.

This was delicious! I added sweet relish, pepper and paprika. I like the idea of butter to make it creamy as opposed to mayo. A keeper recipe in my book!

The tablespoon of celery salt was too much and the stick of butter could have been cut in half or replaced with mayo instead.

I just made these eggs a few minutes ago in order to take to a get-together and enjoyed the filling flavoring quite a bit, but with 1 major change.....no butter.  I just substituted full-fat mayo.  This was an interesting twist as there is not pickle relish in these eggs and the worstishire sauce adds a little twist.
