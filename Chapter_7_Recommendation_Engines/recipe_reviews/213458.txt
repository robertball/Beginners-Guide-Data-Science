Overall tasted yummy, but formed too hard.  Had to break it into little pieces just to eat.  More like the hardness of peanut brittle.  Still good, but needs to be tweaked to be softer.

Very tasty new way to do rice krispie treats, but it was not easy to make them look like bears!  The treats get very hard with the caramel.

great treat and kid friendly! Remember to only melt til just smooth. I think the microwave version is best.
