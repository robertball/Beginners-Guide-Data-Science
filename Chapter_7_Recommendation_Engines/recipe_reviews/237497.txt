Joe's Special Beef & Spinach Scramble Haiku: "God, this is ugly. But holy cow it tastes epic! Made it four times now." My daughter asked, "is this dinner? Breakfast? I can't tell!" to which I responded, "sweetheart, this is HEAVEN." Awful to look at, but I remedied that slightly the 3rd time that I made it by adding 1/2 chopped red bell pepper to the onions. The parmesan and the fresh herbs really add something, as I tried it once w/ dried herbs and cheddar cheese and wasn't nearly as thrilled. Really, as written it is fantastic, but our vote (besides it being a no-question-about-it-Five-Stars) is that it needs 1. Color and 2. 1 more egg. Oh and we love to eat it w/ crusty French bread and a side of steamed squash for some reason!

This is an authentic recipe for Joe's Special. Having lived in San Francisco and had Joe's Special many times, I particularly love making this in May and June when Vidalia onions are available. Over the years, I've embellished it with everything from dry Marsala to toasted pine nuts and it is always so good. We like serving this with sliced avocado on the side, or sometimes topped with a poached egg.

Wonderful! The whole family enjoyed it. I didn't have fresh herbs so I had to use dried. It was still very good but a little bland so I added a seasoning mix from a favorite restaurant. I also mixed  in some cheese as well as sprinkling on top. Next time I'll try with fresh herbs and probably add an extra egg.

Made this as posted, with exception of cooking it in a little Ghee.  Olive oil can become rancid when heated. I also added a ripe tomato I had.  Husband liked it.

Thought this might be a good meal for a meat loving husband but nothing special.   Knew it was not tastey enough when the HP came out of the fridge.

I made it twice so far. The second time I made it, I added a fresh hot pepper to kick it up a notch.
It's is very good both ways depending on whether you like it spiced up a little  or not.

I added 3 red potatoes, cooked, pealed, and cubed. A total meal in 1 plate.

My son and I made this, it was good just needed more flavor.  Maybe a bit of tomato paste added with the beef it mushrooms.  We both thought tomatoes but did not want the wetness of drained tomatoes.  Even ketchup stirred in would help.   We already added garlic.   We like a lot of flavor.  If you have mild tastes itâ€™s great.

We quadrupled the recipe and added extra everything except the onion. It's essentially a backwards omelette the way we made it - as much meat as you'd expect egg to be, and as much  egg as you'd expect meat to be. The flavoring is pretty good though and it tastes somewhere in between a breakfast and dinner dish.

Made as directed and yes Sir tasted just like 
what I'd been craving. I think net time I'll add more eggs I wanted more of a scrambled egg mixture. Roommate thought it was awesome too he had two plates this makes enough for 3 easy. We had Bavarian toast with it very good .
