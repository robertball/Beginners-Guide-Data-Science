It is not a bad recipe, but it desperately needs spice.  Strongly recommend using HOT Italian Sausage, and still might need more heat.  Also, the recipe does not specify but make sure you use a 12" skillet.

I took a previous commentor’s advice and added a little cayenne for spice. I also cooked the sausage about 80% through first,  because how does one coin slice raw sausage? Pretty impossible, unless you have a light saber. Also cooked all of the veggies and sausage together until the onion carmelized. Good recipe, but needed some tweaks like these.

I make this dish a lot, except instead of preheating the sauce I pour it in with the sauteed sausage (casings removed)  and vegetables  including mushrooms, fresh or canned, whichever I have on hand,  and simmer it for at least 30 min, but usually an hour for a more flavorful sauce, which intensifies and is always better the next day. This version is quick, but you won't get the wonderful flavor that these ingredients can produce in a long-simmered sauce.

I really liked the flavors of this, but if I make it again I'll use a smaller pasta and ground sausage rather than sliced links.

I added the sausage to the pepper/onion mixture and seasoned with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and Herbs de Provence. I also used hot instead of mild sausage. Quick, easy, simple and very good.

After reading reviews I used Johnsonville Hot   Italian Sausage and I made my own marinara sauce. I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little heat. Used Yellow and Orange Bell Pepper instead of Green. Topped with shredded Asiago cheese and it was great! Will be making this again!!!!!!

This dish was very tasty, and also pretty  quick & easy to prepare.  I used whole grain penne, but everything else remained the same.  I served it with a (Copycat) Olive Garden salad and garlic bread.  We loved it, so it will definitely go into my Wednesday evening Italian dinner rotation.

I added about two tablespoons of Italian Seasoning and about 1/2 tablespoon of chili pepper flakes to this recipe, otherwise the recipe was great. Everyone had seconds.

My family really liked this dish. It was simple to prepare and they all dug into it. For us I added more bell peppers. They're already looking forward to eating it again.

Super easy, and very good as written.  Next time I'll throw in a handful or two of well chopped fresh spinach, just to add more veggies.

Great flavor. Easy to make. I have made multiple times now. One tip is to partially cook the link sausage before you cut it. Makes it much easier. Also, I am very liberal with the olive oil. Tastes great every time. New fam favorite.

This dish was easy to make and the taste was great.  Even my  husband even liked it!  I used combined half beef/half Italian sausage keeping that on low, covered, while  I  heated the marinara sauce and drained the penne pasta.  Everything came together  right on time and the onions and peppers were just the right consistency.   Served with garlic English muffins hit the spot.  If  you like italian with a great presentation you'll love this!

Did not like it at all. 
Hint on sitting sausage into "coins "; place it in the freezer for 45 min to hour, will cut much easier.

I made this with all of the ingredients included on the list. The one thing that I did change was adding the pasta sauce directly to the pasta instead of the sauce at the end in a bowl.  The hardest part about it was peeling the garlic and cutting it.  Overall, this is a great dish with a basil tomato sauce.

Absolutely delicious!  Johnsonville Italian sausage is our very favorite, and this mild sausage added just a tiny bit of heat to the dish.  It's very flavorful and easy.  I used ground sausage and made it into bite-sized pieces.  I also simmered the sauce with sausage, onions and peppers for about an hour.  That really flavors the sauce and makes the sausage very tender.  Instead of penne, though, I used little pasta purses of deliciousness, filled with pesto and ricotta cheese and called Saccotinni.   Wonderful dish!!  Thanks, Johnsonville.

This recipe is delicious, and my whole family enjoyed it.
I used Johnsonville hot Italian sausage links in place of the mild, added in about 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes, upped it to 3 cloves of minced garlic, and topped it all off with a little sprinkle of mozzarella and some fresh basil. Serve it with a green salad and some crusty bread and you've got dinner.

Have made this many times, just as recipe states and also with different pastas (I like linguine, brother likes pene).  Using both green and red bell peppers really makes this flavorful, don't leave them out if you can.help.it!
