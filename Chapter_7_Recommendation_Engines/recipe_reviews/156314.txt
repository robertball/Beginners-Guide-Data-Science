I was unable to find fresh morels so I doubled the oyster mushrooms. Prepped it early and refrigerated it for about 2 hours. Took it out of the fridge about 30 minutes before baking. Found that I had to raise the oven temp to 400 and cook had to cook another 10 to 15 minutes to cook pastry and the meat came out medium rare. My guests loved it and went back for seconds.

The pastry dough needs a 425F degree oven to cook properly.

This recipe was a disaster!  Puff pastry will not brown at 350 so I raised the temp to 400 and gave it the 15 minutes. The pastry was nicely browned but the lamb was raw. Normally a rack of lamb will cook in 15 minutes in a hot oven but the pastry acted like insulation.  Very disappointed.

Looks pretty but if you follow the cooking time listed the lamb just might kill someone. even using a temp probe didn't help as much as I'd like cause I couldn't get an accurate reading from the middle. had to cut it then finish it back in the oven.
doubt I'll try this again.
