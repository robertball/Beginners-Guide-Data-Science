My husband has ancestors from the Isle of Man, so he wanted to make this for a gathering.  I couldn't find beef shank, so we opted to use beef stew meat and simmered it with the rest of the vegetables and added some beef broth.  It turned out very tasty!

Very good! My family is originally from the Isle of Mann so I had to try it, and I wasn't disappointed!

The thyme & leeks added a different flavor than a regular beef barley soup. Everyone ate it, but no one raved. Overall, I prefer beef barley with garlic & onion.
