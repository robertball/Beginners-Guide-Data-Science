I didnt have the beans stated but I had canneloni beans and black beans and used all the other ingredients as stated. Delicious!!! I have tried to limit my meat intake so I eat a lot of beans and veggies. I used this bean recipe as a buritto stuffing. I added the beans, mexican cheese, cilantro,tomatoes! and a dollop of sour cream.  Sooooo good!

I LOVED this! I went with the dark kidneys to give it different color and I used Miller Lite for the beer. I am not much of a beer drinker anymore but love the flavor and boldness it adds to food. I added raw onion to the top of my beans but that is just something my family did growing up and a habit I don't care to break. I've shied away from can goods here lately but this is one I won't be shying from period. I really enjoyed this. Thank you for sharing SweetBasil!

Nice side and good change from sweet baked beans. Sauteed a little onion and chopped country ham. Added beans, dried tabasco pepper, and chopped green sweet pepper with other ingredients. Instead of beer, I've made this with a half cup or so of picante sauce.

So bitter! I made the recipe exactly as stated and it was bitter. I know it's because of the beer, but maybe other cooks could reccommend a particular brand of beer? I tried to salvage this by adding brown sugar, and although it helped a little, the strong bitter aftertaste was too much.

Made this with Corona beer, and substituted 2 serrano chili peppers for the jalapenos (personal preference -- we just like the flavor they give a little better) thought this was a tasty, flavorful, easy side dish -- a definite keeper! Thanks so much!

I have to disagree with the other reviews. These beans didn't have a great flavor...they just tasted like beans. Definitely not a keeper.

I'm right there with MOLLE 888 - - when I read their review I thought "HUH??" but sure enough, my batch, too was bitter and like MOLLE, I wondered if it was the type beer. But!! When all else fails - - - add chicken broth - yes that made all the difference in the world, improved the flavor. I didn't care for all the excess liquid and didn't want to cook the daylights out of it so I added a sprinkle of rice - - tada - -  beans and rice!! Now I can't get my husband to lay off of it! He'll have it gone before dinner if I'm not careful!

This was quick and easy to prepare, and I like all the ingredients that go into it.  But it was missing something; red onion might add flavor.

It took me a while to decide I liked this recipe, but when I got to that point I liked it a lot indeed.  It seemed to get better over time, too, and I ended up eating it for a few days just cold.  No one else in my family was a big fan--it is unusual tasting--but I didn't mind finishing it up!

This was a pretty good recipe with just some minor tweaks.  A lot of reviewers mentioned that the beer either made the beans taste bitter or tasteless, so I instead used Angry Orchard Crisp Apple Cider.  The cider gave the beans a very nice sweetness.

I sauteed the onions with a bit of olive oil before adding them to the beans; threw in diced half yellow and red bell peppers, jalapenos, and garlic when the onions became translucent.  After a couple of minutes, I combined all the ingredients in a pot and simmered as instructed.

This is great! If you don't like it hot try adding shredded white radish and a couple of white icicle peppers raw after it simmers. Nice bit of a crunchy texture to complement the firm texture of the beans. And when they're cold a tiny splash of balsamic vinegar brings up the malty beer tones.
