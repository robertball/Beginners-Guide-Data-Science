A little bland.  Next time I will add some garlic powder and maybe some red pepper flakes to kick it up.  But the idea is great.

This is big with my kids, as it was with me when I was little. Mom always added garlic powder and pepper and more butter. Sometimes, even red pepper flakes. Also works with whatever meat ends you have on hand, like spam or bacon. Most comforting for big and little kids alike.

I made this last night for a toddler and a picky 12 yr. old. Tough crowd, but they loved it! Followed the recipe as written (except for using fresh parsley). Super easy, super cheap and appeals to kids...that makes it a five star recipe to me.

My kids loved this recipe.  They ate it all up.  It's not something I want to eat but it is a very kid friendly meal.  I don't like hotdogs myself, but my kids love it and that what counts.

The only changes I made were to add frozen carrots/peas to the noodles while they were boiling. I had half a bag of egg noodles and some hot dogs that needed used up so this recipe worked great but sadly the kids or the rest of the family wouldn't eat it.... Thanks for the interesting recipe.

Nice, easy and quck.  My daughter is learning how to cook and she made this dish on her own perfectly.  Also, the kids enjoy hot dogs, but I think we will try this with beef kielbasa next time.

precisely what it promises to be - easy and kid friendly! my daughter couldn't believe she actually got to eat this for dinner. i was just plain exhausted and in desperate need of a trip to the grocery store so this won out for dinner. i must say, it really wasn't bad for what it was. and i used light turkey franks and a light butter spread, so it wasn't too terribly bad for us either. thanks!

WOW! Best hotdogs I've had since last state fair (and come to think of it, I liked the coating, not the dog).  This is the perfect quick recipe to make when you're hungry and DON'T want to cook... ie. beats fast food, hands down.  It's also the perfect thing to serve alongside a big serving of steamed veges... or if your kids (and spouse) are food-educated and open-minded, saute the veges right in with the hotdogs. It's a five star for it's simplicity.

I have mixed emotions about this one.  I can definitely see how it is kid friendly. I had leftover hotdogs and egg noodles so I mixed this up I didn't use any measurements.  If your a garlic fan I would definitely add some. I've started making this without the hotdogs just the noodle part with garlic as a side dish.

Rather bland flavor but could be a good base for a quick dinner anytime. Very easy to modify. My mom and 10 year old brother loved it as is so I gave the 4 but I will add some veggies and kick up the flavor next time. Thanks for the easy dinner idea!

Good stuff...to Amanda k23k...that's what happens when you mix hot dogs with carrots and peas. Try the recipe without modifying it with veggies that just don't pair with food like a hot dog  :O)

This recipe is a staple in our house, we love it!  It is incredibly easy to make, yet the taste doesn't suffer because of that.  This is our go to recipe when we don't feel like putting a lot of work into dinner, but still want something very satisfying.  We use beef hot dogs for this, add more Parmesan cheese than the recipe calls for, and have found that browning the hot dogs a good bit adds a little extra flavor.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

This is so easy and yummy. Not gourmet, but that's what gives it such ease and speedy preparation. I added more parmesan cheese when cooking and topped it with a cheddar cheese sauce. You can never have too much cheese!

This was good for a quick supper. I didn't have parsley and was desperate to try this, so I substituted Italian seasoning. Was not anything "wow" to me, but I gave it a 4 star because maybe the parsley really makes the difference here.

I am so glad I saw this recipe. I was wondering what to have for lunch today when I came across it. It reminded me of a similar dish my mum used to make for me when I was a kid. I didn't really make any significant changes to this recipe but I did use fresh parsley and sprinkled some black pepper into the mix. I sprinkled extra cheese over the top. Delicious!

Much tastier than expected, with the simple ingredients and quick cooking time. Not healthy, very buttery and fatty. Comfort food and great for using up leftovers.

I made this last night.  It is a great basic recipe.  I made it just like the directions said but my family and I thought there wasn't enough flavor.  I will make it again since it was so easy but I will add garlic powder for more flavor.

Kids loved this!!!  And I like butter noodles and hotdogs, so I did too.  I omitted the parsley, used a full pack of hotdogs (good ones), added lots of garlic powder and more parmesan, plus salt and pepper.  Very easy, child-friendly dinner.  I also called it "The Kids Tied Up Mom and Made Dinner."

I love hot dogs, and like noodles, and thought this recipe was okay, nothing special. It's probably a pretty kid-friendly dish though. I made it exactly as written, except I've never seen an 8-ounce package of pasta, so just used half of a 1-pound package of "extra-wide" egg noodles. The noodles needed maybe an extra minute to cook. I thought there was a bit too much butter, and was a little surprised at how colorful this recipe turned out to be.

The recipe in its original form was a little bland for me, needed to double the parmesan cheese and add a little garlic to give it some pop.
