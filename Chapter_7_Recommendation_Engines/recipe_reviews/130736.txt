I've lived in Colorado 20 years - this is the ONLY chocolate chip cookie recipe that still tastes like "toll house", but works at our altitude.  Thank you!!!

Yay! It worked! I've used Toll House's high altitude recipe and it was just as flat as the orig. recipe. I've tried others that tasted cakey.  This is it!  Followed directions exactly but switched to Toll house at the end and added 1C. walnuts and the whole bag (2 cups) of chips.  PERFECT.  Consistantly baked @ 11min using a small ice cream scoop (1+TBSP maybe?) to spoon on cookie sheet.  Whoohoo!!!

I live at 6900 ft and mastered most other cookies, but not choco chip cookies.  These were awesome!!!  They rose well after baking and look like REAL cookies instead of the flat masses I've been making.  They taste great, and have the right texture.  My kids inhaled them after school today.  I will make this (finally!) my new choco chip cookie recipe.  Thank you!!!

I moved to Evanston WY three years ago, which is 6850 above sea level. Im from the midwest and never had a problem making cookies untill i moved here. I have tried several chocolate chip recipes and none worked untill i tried this one. I just follwed the directions and got perfect cookies. I will use this recipe again.

I added the extra flour and an extra 1/2 cup of choc bits to make it a little crunchier and choclate-ier.  Definatley worth a try, turned out quite nice, caramelised and crunchy on the outside and softer but not gooey on the inside.  Nice with a big glass of milk.  Beware: a little moorish!!

Worked great at 4500 feet!  This was just what I've been looking for- I'd only reccomend adding more chocolate chips, since I'm a chocoalate fiend.

Didn't work in Colorado Springs (elev 6000ft). Flat cookies that spread out all over the pan instead of rising.

I live in Colorado Springs (7000 ft) and these worked perfectly! The only thing I modified was adding a small box of vanilla pudding mix after the vanilla and reduced the flour by 1/4 cup. We like soft, chewy cookies and these came out fluffy and fabulous on 350 degrees for 14 minutes. I've made these twice now, the second time I separated the dough and made the first half the original recipe still using a full 1 cup of chocolate chips and the other half I mixed with 3/4 cup white chocolate chips, 2 oz bag chopped macadamia nuts and 1/2 cup of Craisins. Both cookies came out fabulous and this is my new go to cookie recipe.

I'm at +-5000 ft and this recipe works fine. Using my cookie scoop I consistently get 4 dozen cookies. I don't modify it at all though I can see how people get such a wide variety of results. Cookies, especially at altitude, are sensitive to moisture and sugar content. You may need to modify even this 'high altitude' recipe depending on your specific altitude and humidity. Realistically, there is no "one cookie fits all" high altitude recipe; it would be helpful if authors always specified their original altitudes to make adjustments easier to guess.  Fixes for overspreading can include refrigerating the dough before baking and using cool pans, adding extra flour a tablespoon at a time, decreasing the sugar by a few tablespoons, adding extra liquid (like an extra egg), and/or increasing the temperature 10-15 degrees and shortening the cooking time. I've started weighing my flour instead of measuring with a scoop with 120 g= 1 cup. Since doing this I start with the same amount every time and can increase it with precision to the right consistency for my conditions. I found I get the best texture if I bake just till the very edge begins to brown and the rest looks under-baked. Then I take them out and let them finish baking on the pan for about 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. If I let them bake till they look done in the oven, they are overcooked and turn crispy. Keep a slice of bread in the container with the cookies to keep them soft.

These cookies have fantastic texture, but they are SO bland!!  Only 1/2 tsp salt to 3 1/2 cups of flour?  The flavor is very noticeably lacking.  To keep the salt/flour ratio the same as Tollhouse's recipe, I would use at least 1 1/4 tsp salt.  That is the only change I would make, though, because they bake absolutely perfectly.  Not flat at all, with a great chew.  If the salt adjustment works, I will never make another recipe again!

This is a great recipe!  I live just outside of Denver, about 5000 feet and it worked great.  After reading other reviews, I doubled the choc. chips.  I'm glad I did, they are just right with 2 cups of chips.

6,000 feet, just perfect. The first batch I made flattened out, which baffled me because this recipe got great reviews from other "elevated" people. I put the rest of the dough in the fridge to finish baking the next day, and they came out SO well! Perfectly chewy in the center and crispy on the outside, loved them. Not sure if chilling helps but it certainly made a difference for me. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe for high altitude in Provo, Utah! I followed the suggestion to add a little extra flour and also made sure to use real butter! People I gave them too asked what the secret ingredient was even though I added nothing special...crazy!

These had a good taste when fresh, but didn't work for me. Flat, flat, crunchy. I tried making big ones, small ones... nothing worked. I'm at 5,000 feet, and still searching for a cookie recipe that actually works at elevation... sigh. Disappointed.

I am only at 3600 ft but still had the flat cookie problem.  These are wonderful.  Puffy but crispy on edges.  Hubby loved them and I will use this recipe from now on.  Thank You to origional poster.

PERFECT. I live in CO (7000 ft) and this is, without doubt, the best cookie ever. I added M&Ms for color and 1 cup of baking cocoa for chocolate flavor.

I live at approximately 5000 feet, just high enough to play havoc with cookies.  This really is a great recipe - the cookies held their shape and were light and delicately crunchy.  I nearly doubled the chips, baked them at 360 degrees for 10 minutes - and they came out great.

I really appreciate that someone has finally offered their high altitude recipe for cookies. So many recipes say no change for high altitude but it isn't true, I baked at sea level for years and when I moved to Utah to 4500 ft I had to make adjustments to all my recipes so I did have flat gooey messes. While this recipe might work for the authors altitude, I find at 4500 ft the following changes perfection, only 3 cups of flour, reduced white sugar 2 tbsp, 2 eggs, 1 tsp salt, 2 tsp real vanilla extract (it makes a huge difference) and 2 cups of chocolate chips. If you can refrigerate the dough for 1-24 hours is best to let flavors meld. With those changes absolute perfection!

I made these with my 7th grade Home Ec students. Then we packaged them up and gave them to the teachers with hand made Christmas cards. They were a huge hit! Everyone is asking for the recipe.

This is absolutely the best high altitude cookie recipe you could ever use!!!!! Fluffy yet moist, low crumble and great rich flavor. Everyone asks me for this recipe and I make these cookies every Christmas for work functions and as gifts to the Vet and the Doctor's   office. If you live in high altitude this should be your "Go To" recipe for chocolate chip cookies. Amazing!

Fantastic! I moved from sea level to 4000 feet, and saw my cookies suffer a little. Then I moved to 7200 feet in Wyoming and my cookies were like hocky pucks. This recipes gave me perfect cookies like I had at sea level :D

We're at about 4,300 feet and I've been having a difficult time finding a good cookie recipe. I followed this one exactly and my husband and I really enjoyed this. The dough and cookies were VERY yummy! Thanks! (Afternote: These cookies have passed the 2 day test! They taste delicious even 2 days after being made! I won't be making any other chocolate/white chocolate chip cookies from here on out!)

These cookies are great!  They remind me of the choc. chip cookie recipe from Cook's Illustrated, which is a good thing.  I was too scared to tweak that recipe after moving from the Midwest to Denver, this is now my go to choc. chip cookie recipe!

Yeah!  When I moved to Colorado,  I thought I'd never be able to make a decent chocolate chip cookie again.  The high altitude adjustments on the Toll House package make no difference. .. These cookies are great,  slightly chewy,  very tasty!

These cookies are awesome!  Since I moved from sea level to more than a mile above it, my cookies are always a little funky.  But these turned out perfect. Nice and soft inside and they store well. Thank you for sharing :)

I live in the Mile-High and I wasn't very impressed with these cookies. I followed the recipe but added another 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. They were a little cake-like. Another review said they weren't, so it depends on your definition. I will keep looking for another recipe.

Yay! A cookie that doesn't sink at the 6700 ft level! Best cookie I've made since moving to CO. I liked them with more chocolate chips though. For those who said they sank, makes me wonder if their baking soda was fresh.

This recipe is fantastic! I wrote the changes from this recipe into my Betty Crocker Cook Book Binder.  When I moved here at 6300 feet elevation, my chocolate chip cookies, from my old recipe, turned out flat and gummy. These cookies are better than any I made at sea level!  They stay puffed up and fluffy and the softness last a few days, (whenever the cookies actually last that long).  I have been using this same recipe for a few years now. People are offering to buy them from me!  

Toast 1/2 cup pecans or walnuts in a skillet before mixing the dough and let them cool, then add them at the time you add the chocolate chips. You will be in Cookie heaven!

Should have written a review months ago. I have baked these quite a few times since I found the recipe, and they always turn out perfectly. I just got done baking another double batch of these. This time I threw in a bag of toffee bits. We are taking them on a big family camp out.  Thank you for posting it.

Soft and fluffy cookies instead of flat crunchy ones.

Moving from 1,000 feet to 10,000 feet, I was cautious to start baking again -- this is one of my first recipes I've tried.  I made a couple of small tweaks as most high-altitude recipes are not necessarily for 10k, but overall I am very happy with it!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!  I cannot believe I'm sitting at 6800 ft in Colorado eating cookies that are moist, and chewy!  Thank you!  Next time I'll double the chocolate chips, but otherwise, this recipe is the answer to my cookie problems at high altitudes.

I so wanted this to turn out well. The reviews were so encouraging. I'm at 6500 ft The cookies were too flat and sugary. There wasn't enough substance to the cookie. It was like a few choc chips held together with sugar and butter. I'm going to try the toll house version next. :(

I live @ 9000 feet in Colorado so baking can be a challenge.  These cookies are REALLY good, my boys and husband loved them.  I made only two adjustments to the recipe; used 3 cups of flour and 2 cups of chocolate chips.  This is a keeper.  
********UPDATE:  I forgot to mention that I used Splenda in place of the white sugar.  The brown sugar and the 2 cups of chocolate chips were just right for sweetness.  Cookies were not flat they were soft and chewy with texture.

I live at 8500 feet, and followed the recipe precisely.  The cookies looked nice and thick and the texture was great. But, we thought the flavor was lacking.  The cookies were really plain. Also, there were very few chocolate chips per cookie. I probably won't make this recipe again, but if I did I would at least double the chocolate chips.

This recipe is great for all those who live at a high altitude. After moving from CA to AZ I have finally found a chocolate chip cookie recipe that tastes and looks like a cookie! Stir by hand and bake for 15 minutes and only put one cookie sheet in the oven at a time. Place cookies in a air tight container while they are still warm. Delicious!!!

YUM! For two years I've been trying to make good chocolate chip cookies in Colorado Springs. They are always flavorless. This recipe is perfect!!! I did use half wheat and half white flour. Good thing I only made a half-batch, because I cannot stop eating them!

These looked great, but they were HARD.  Even overnight in a zipped bag they were HARD.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the taste was "missing" something.I prefer the Toll House high altitude recipe (on the bag).

I was very skeptical when making these.  I live in Wyoming and so far, I found 1 chocolate chip cookie recipe that didn't turn out flat but they just weren't as good as Nestle.  When I made the dough for these, I couldn't believe how dry it was.  But, when they came out, they were really good!  I did add a full teaspoon of salt because I like my cookies a little more salty like Nestle's and a full bag of chocolate chips.  This is definitely my go to recipe for chocolate chip cookies while we're living at over 7,000 feet.  Thanks!  The search is over!

This recipe is AMAZING! I get the best cookies every time I make it. They are thick all the way through. I add a 1/2 cup extra chocolate chips. I live in Denver, CO and these come out perfect every time. I can't recommend this recipe enough!

I'm at 5300 feet. This recipe is perfect as-is in my oven. I did have to alter it slightly for my sister's oven (5200 feet, convection oven): 3/4 tsp baking soda, 3 3/4 cups flour, decrease oven temp to 325, place dough on a pre-heated stone, still bake for 10-12 minutes. In my opinion, better than Nestles Toll House cookies baked at lower altitude. Melt-in-your-mouth, much better!

Thank you so much for this recipe. I live at 8400 ft and being from the flatlands baking has been a challenge. I just made them and they turned out perfect. I did use the whole package of chocolate chips instead of the 1 cup.They are delicious !

I don't know what happened! I'm at 7,500 feet here and I followed the recipe exactly but the cookies turned out hard and greasy on the roof of the mouth. I added English walnuts.  I think 3-1/2 C of flour was too much and the butter was too much.

Can I give six stars?? I live at 7,000 ft elevation and this cookie recipe works where everything else has failed! Delicious, soft and chewy, and beautiful!! I would recommend squishing them down a little before you bake them because they don't spread very far, but otherwise there's nothing I would change. I also added extra chocolate chips, but that's just me.

Although I have tried many other cookie recipes at 7000 feet with success, finding a good chocolate chip cookie was proving difficult.  This recipe was awesome- everyone loved them!

I live at 8150 ft altitude. My cookies were always runny and really chewy. Finally I found a recipe that works for me. My cookies came out delicious and crunchy, just like I love my chocolate chip cookies. I did not make any changes in the recipe and it worked perfect. Thank you for the recipe...

7195 feet and amazing! The best cookies I've made since living in Colorado. I put about 2 inches of heaping cookie dough per cookie and they turned out amazing in just 12 minutes :) Keeping this one!

If you live in a high altitude, this recipe will not work.  I tried it at 6000 ft, and all I got was a flat mess.  You can find adjustments for high altitude baking.  I just moved here, and forgot to adjust.

Oh my goodness!  I found home.  I'm from Traverse City, MI and moved to Flagstaff, AZ about three years ago.  I was home sick one day and thought my grandma's cookies would cheer me up- cookies came out flat, hard with chocolate lumps.  I was so upset, down-hearted and confused why.  It wasn't until others in area told me I needed to add extra flour but then others said add water- nothing worked until now.  I just ate my first cookie from the oven (from this recipe) and I was home again. THANK YOU!

These are amazing!  I live at 6300 feet and have never made a successful cookie until now.  I tried using the convection feature of my oven, but that didn't work at all.  But 350 and just one cookie sheet at a time worked just fine.  Delicious!!

I live at about 6,000 ft in elevation and previous to this cookie recipe my cookies turned out flat and crispy.  But this worked like a charm! I used no-salt cream butter and took the temp down to 325 degrees and they cooked dead on to the time in this recipe. Using that butter made it taste great while cutting down on the amount of salt in the recipe.  DELICIOUS!

Great taste.  Perfect for high altitudes like Albuquerque.  I have waited for years for a great tasting cookie.    A little hard to mix with a hand mixer. But the end results are perfect.  My husband made it with chocolate chunks and did heaping tablespoons and we still yielded 4 doz.

I am at 10,000 ft. high and this recipe works well.  I add one table spoon of corn starch (people around here tend to add corn starch for baking) and bake for 10-12 minutes at my electric oven (375F).

The first batch made to recipe was a bit cakey.  I added an additional cup of chips and a half cup walnuts. Also only cooked them for only 11min like suggested in another review. Came out chewy soft and delicious...

This is a great recipe! I live at 5,600 feet in Montana and my chocolate chip cookies have been turning out like sheets of paper :) I did make a few changes (and for those of you who are still getting flat cookies, this will help): I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored shortening (shortening has a higher melting temprature than butter so the cookies hold their shape better), and I used 1/2t. baking soad and 1/2t. baking powder ~ also , be sure not to overmix! Thanks for posting this recipe, it is wonderful!

I live in Bogotá, Colombia (9000 ft) and all I can say about this recipe is THANK YOU.  Homemade chocolate chip cookies is something us ex-pats really miss here!  I made this recipe exactly as is and the cookies turned out perfectly.  I took them to a dinner party--they were devoured in 10 minutes flat!!  Everyone asked for the recipe.

Finally, after over 40 years at high altitude a perfect cookie.  I refridgerated the dough first and cooked them for a full 15 minutes on a silicone sheet. Lots of smiles at my house tonight.

YES! These were good cookies. I live in Colorado I'm only at 5300 ft and I never really had a cookie problem but it's a problem I never made these cookies! You can tell in the first steps of making these they are going to be good. I doubted the recipe cause it seemed too simple but they were great. They look just like the picture posted. I'm a clumsy cook, meaning 1/4 tsp of salt means me accidently dumping most the salt in the bowl and the recipe stood against my foolishness in the kitchen. I messed this recipe up pretty good and my husband still loved them. I will most definately make these cookies again. Hope I don't goof next time :)

I made these cookies yesterday and I am disappointed!  We live at 8394' altitude west of Denver in the mountains; the cookies looked and tasted wonderful fresh from the oven!  I stored them in my cookie jar which has a tight fitting lid immediately after cooling BUT, the next day they were as hard as a rock! I'd like to try altering the recipe and see if I can get a softer cookie.

I'm a Colorado/Denver area native, and have tried so many recipes. This tastes good but still spreads and is kind of thin. Not AS thin as the others, but still thinner than I had hoped. Next time I'm going to try using half shortening (butter flavored) and half butter to see if that helps.

Colorado-spent several years trying to make chocolate chip cookies that didn't go flat. This is the recipe! Thick and tasty! Great standby, will make again. May add more vanilla next time for more flavor. Great dunking cookies!

These were not cookies. Instead, I made mini "cakes".  Not to mention how bland and salty they were.  I'm going to try the Tollhouse recipe for high altitude next- got to make it up to the kids! (I'm at 5,500 feet)

We live at 5,000 feet and these are by far the very best cookies I've made in years! Until 2000 I lived at sea level and have really struggled with baking at altitude. Please post more 'altitude friendly' baked goods recipes....you are my hero!!

I have been making cookies for a very long time.  These cookies are the best I have ever had!  I do not live in a high altitude city, however, my cookies were always flat.  This recipe has cured all of my problems and they are very tasty!

Thank you Erik C.  Where have you been all of my life!!!!!

I have been trying different high-altitude recipes, and this is by far the best!! It is the perfect recipe for my 4-year-old to help with as well. The only change we made to the recipe was to add another cup of chocolate chips. Awesome flavor and consistency! Not dry or hard, just perfect!!

I just moved to 7000 feet and was so worried about making cookies.  Everything is coming out wrong from what I'm used to at moist sea level. :)  These cookies, however, came out perfectly. Saving this recipe.

Fantastic!
I live at 8000 ft...the cookies came out perfect...crisp on the edge and soft and chewy in the middle.  I did add an extra tsp of vanilla extract, though

Fantastic high-altitude recipe. My boyfriend literally devoured them as they came off the cookie sheet. I also put the choc chips with some walnuts into my electric chopper before i mixed them in.

OMG!!! This IS the recipe for cold weather baking!!! I’m in  Hokkaido, Japan and I’m only living at 308 meters. I love baking chocolate chip cookies but when I’m here in Niseko, Japan where there’s epic powder snow, my cookies always turned out flat and crispy. They tasted good but looked hideous! I usually add a 1/4 cup of cocoa powder for a chocolatey chocolate chip cookie. I cut this recipe in half just to be sure that this recipe works! Boy oh boy!! You didn’t disappoint!! I will use this recipe for baking in cold, dry weather!! Thank you so much!!!

Yeah, finally have chocolate chip cookies that don’t flatten out when they come out of the oven. I followed the directions with the 2 exceptions. I used 2 cups of chocolate chips and I used a regular size ice cream scoop and baked them for 15 min. Perfection..

I live in Colorado and followed this recipe to the letter, with the exception of the cooking time, and these turned out amazing! They are honestly some of the best chocolate chip cookies I’ve ever had! I pulled them out as soon as the edges started to turn golden brown and they were perfect (8-12 minutes depending on the pan). The picture doesn’t do them justice.

I call these Colorado Chocolate Chip Cookies! I am at about 5280 elevation and I love how they turn out! My modifications include softening the butter, 1 tsp of salt, and 2 generous cups of chocolate chips, chill the dough 30 minutes up to 4 hours.  Use cool baking sheets between batches.

At 12,000 feet (and with leaving the dough in the fridge for 30 mins), this recipe didn't work for me. They tasted fine, but were super flat. I will try it again with less sugar and at a higher temperature next time!

Made this cookies with my 5 year old and they turned our great! We live in Colorado Springs, and had no issue with flatness. I made them fairly large so had to bake them a tad longer than suggested.

Unfortunately, these did not work in Colorado Springs...I saw someone else's review from here as well but thought I would try it anyway.  They came out flat, my kids will still eat them, but I can't use the recipe anymore.

"High altitude" isn't specific to a particular altitude. I live in Colorado Springs at 6200 feet. I made about 2 dozen with the original recipe with really flat cookies coming out. So I added another egg (if I made it again I might add even another, so a total of 5). I also added a tablespoon of flour. I refrigerated between each batch as well.

High altitude recipes are tricky, manipulating recipes with every 1000 feet of change (give or take). It's a great start for 6200 feet but I'd have to tweak a few more times to get it just right, and the original recipe was not perfect, but it might be at 3000 feet!

This is my favorite recipe! I try to make them every week! I add the extra flour and chips and keep them in the refrigerator, in an old Toll House tub, so that I remember what temp to cook them at.

Ever since my family and I moved to Crestline, Ca., I have not been able to make edible Chocolate Chip cookies until now. At first glance, I was worried they would taste too cakey but I was wrong. I have made this recipe two times and both times the cookies were as good as my usual recipe from tollhouse. My kids are happy which makes me happy!!!!

I didn't change anything, but I did use the tip to refrigerate the dough overnight first.  The cookies turned out great!  We live at 8200 ft in Colorado.

I moved from Florida to Reno, NV and basically had to trash my old cookie recipe for this one. Honestly, this is better than I could have possibly imagined! I even tried a different high altitude cookie recipe before this one and it didn’t even compare.They come out perfect every time. I bake for 13 minutes because I like a softer cookie. I don’t even think this recipe needs any more great reviews but it’s too good for me not to say something. Definitely make these if you are looking for a high altitude cookie recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly but mine turned out fat and cakey. Not sure what went wrong? They taste fine, just not the normal chewy texture you’d expect from a chocolate chip cookie. I’m at about 7,000 ft.

Followed the recipe as shown to the letter. End result looked good... and were nice and soft/chewy... but the taste left something to be desired. Had a very flour-heavy flavor, and wasn't sweet enough. I also don't think the recipe called for nearly enough chocolate chips, but I suppose that's very subjective.

I moved to Denver from Atlanta over a year ago and haven't found a good cookie recipe since adjusting to this altitude, but this recipe was great! I subbed white chocolate chips and pecan bits and they tasted awesome. 4 stars instead of 5 due to some spreading.

People are saying they went flat. I wish mine did. I've never had cookies come out like this in my life. Maybe it's the butter I used idk. But these are the most dense cookies I have ever had. Thought I had used this recipe before,not sure, but i wont  use it again

i live at 5500' so don't seriously need high altitude.  normally, a bit extra flour or water makes the difference.  i made following recipe exactly.  I thought so much flour overwhelmed the gooey butter taste.  They were very cakelike and nothing close to resembling original Toll House.

I made these in Eagle, CO and they turned out great. Next time I'll add more chocolate chips though because the amount called for did not seem like enough for me.  I did have the issue of these getting hard rather quickly, but that could have been from how I stored them. Overall, delicious!!

I live in COLORADO SPRINGS, CO (6k above sea level) and just made this recipe this morning. The cookies were fluffy, soft and perfect. Most of my other cookie recipes produced flat cookies but not this one, it's a keeper!! Thank you!

This is my go to chocolate chip cookie recipe.  l live at 6000 ft and havent had an issue with flat cookies since using this recipe.  They always come out chewy on the inside and crisp around the edges.  Delicious.

A few tips if your cookies are coming out flat:

1. It's very important that your butter is room temperature before you mix it with your sugar. 
2. Do not over mix the dough.
3. Make sure the cookie sheet is cool before starting a new batch.
4. If your cookies are still spreading try chilling the dough before baking it.

I made these with turbinado raw instead of white sugar because it's what I had on hand. Next time I'll try reducing the overall sugar amount and increasing the salt to compensate, to see if that takes the edge off the intense sweetness. I'll also add more chocolate chips, as I felt this amount was a bit sparing. Hopefully these changes won't mess with what is otherwise a great recipe that does what it promises! 

I am also curious to know what would happen if I reduce the eggs to two and the flour to 2.5... Shoot, seems like I'm going to have to make these a few times!:)

I live in Colorado, and this recipe was very handy because of the high altitude here. They were very gooey and soft. I halved this recipe so I made 24. We ate them all in one night!

We live at 6,000 ft. elevation and have had trouble with our chocolate chip cookies not coming out the way we'd like for quite some time.  These came out nicely.  We used the whole 3 1/2 cups of flour and 1 1/4 cups chocolate chips.  We'll definitely make these again.

I followed the directions with one minor change. Rather than the cup of chocolate chips the recipe call for, I added a 1 and 1/2C. I did 3/4 C of regular milk chocolate morsels, and 3/4 C of mini semi sweet morsels. They came so good!!

Finally - a thick chewy delicious cookie at over 9000' in Colorado. Batter was much thicker (almost a bread dough) than cookie dough I've made before. Worked!

I live outside Denver, CO at just a little over a mile high. After I tried to compensate for altitude in my last batch and they came out like little shortbread blobs (they stayed their EXACT shape through baking), I decided I needed a new recipe. I made as directed but used 1/8 cup extra flour (1/4 cup was suggested), a tiny bit less on the sugars, and a bit more chocolate chips. They stayed raised and actually taste like chocolate chip cookies! I will be sticking with this recipe.

Works great for this baker in Longmont Colorado! I turn the pan around half way though and bake for 17 mins. I like big cookies so I use a ice cream scoop to create a uniform size. Thank you for the recipe!

These are delicious! Although I found that I had to cook them less (10 mins), I was almost out of eggs so I only used two, and I used half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate chips. So good, and they turned out so pretty!

Just finished a batch. This will be my new go to chocolate chip cookie recipe. I moved to a high altitude and my chocolate chip cookies have been a failure, even when following instructions on the package.

I followed the recipe and my batter ended up looking like it was mostly flower, I also read from a couple of the previous comments that they were a little bland; I added a DASH more of vanilla and when I say dash I mean dash. I also added an extra egg and 4 table spoons of water, over all they turned out delicious and they are absolutely perfect, I made mine small and only baked them for 13 minutes at 350. Good luck!

I have been trying so hard, since moving to Pueblo, CO, to make a chocolate chip cookie recipe. All other baking I've done, I could adjust with less solid and more liquid and adjusting bake time. I struggled with basic chocolate chip cookies. I did the recipe to a "T" and baked for 11 minutes. 12 was a tad too long but still fine. These came out crispy on outside but gooey inside. I never rate recipes but am so dang happy to have one that worked so well! I did add extra chocolate chips because, well, I like my cookies chocolate-y. Fantastic recipe by far!

I love love this recipe.  I am located in central Utah and it worked great.  I accidentally only put in 1/2 cup of butter the first time and they turned out great and super fluffy so I make it like that all the time.  Pretty much the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had.

Great recipe, I live in Denver suburb.  The only changes I made was 1-1/2 tsp salt; and 1-1/2 c. chocolate chunks;  and since I have never done any gluten free baking I used 1-3/4 c brown rice flour and 1-3/4 c white whole wheat flour.  I have only a hand mixer so used it to blend up butter, sugars, eggs and vanilla.  Then mixing in the flour mix by hand was challenging to incorporate all but kept at it.  I had to sprinkle in a tsp. of milk to get all the flour absorbed.  With 1/3 dough added some chopped pecans, 1/3 dough added dried unsweetened cherries and 1/3 dough chocolate chunks only.  My oven is a bit on the cool side so I had to adjust by bumping up temp to 355.  Parchment paper is the only way to go on pans.  These turned out perfectly (the way I like) with crunch on the outside and chewy on the inside.  The brown rice flour adds an interesting texture too.

Love these cookies!  I have even used them while camping up in the mountains and cooked them in a reflector oven.  They  are a win for cooking at high altitudes.

I ran out of flour after 2 1/4 cups so I used waffle mix for the remainder and since it already has all the dry ingredients in it, I took out the baking powder and just added a little bit of baking soda then, crossed my fingers that my cookie science was on par as I slid the first batch into the oven.   They spread out a little more than I had hoped, did not rise hardly at all but when I tried them, wow!  The flavor was great and they were crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  That to me is all that I need in a cookie.  :)  I suspect if I had the recipe exact they would have been much better.
I made these again, this time 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup coconut oil.  Amazing flavor except for some reason, I don't think I needed as much flour as my cookies came out very dense this time.  Very crunchy and thick but tasted great and looked beautiful.  No one really complained about the density.

I'm at 8500 feet. The first time I made these, they spread all over the pan and didn't turn out great. The second time I tweaked it a little bit because I wondered if my altitude is a bit higher than the recipe is intended for. I used about 1 1/2 T less of each of the sugars, reduced the baking soda to 3/4 t., and added 1/2 cup more flour. It did the trick and the results were perfect!

I made the first batch per recipe.  The next one I added more chocolate.  We are at 4,500 ft and the cookies raised with no problem.  I even had to flatten them a bit.

Not a good high elevation recipe. At 7,000 ft here in Flagstaff the cookies spread all over the pan and turned out flat and misshapen. Taste is acceptable, but nothing special. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Next time I look for another recipe.

So glad I found this recipe. Made it exactly how the recipe said and they turned out chewy, fluffy and so dang yummy! First time I haven't made flat cookies in 8 years due to high altitude living. I'm at 6000+ feet here in Colorado Springs. I did make sure to just barely mix everything in, not sure if that helped at all. Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly, besides adding  little more chocolate chips.  It is great they come out perfect!!  I moved to CO from the east coast 8 years ago and could never get my cookies to come out as anything but flat and tough.  These taste a lot like toll house but come out risen and soft.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

I'm at 5,200 feet in Albuquerque and I have made this recipe about 20 times. It is so good and the cookies come out perfect and delicious every time, not caved in or burnt like other recipes! I always add chopped nuts and I usually use dark chocolate chunks too. Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!!

So awesome! Wonderful recipe. Did add a tad more chocolate chips than it said.
I'm from utah, and this recipe worked so well! I posted a photo of the finish product. It looks way better in person.

Here's the deal: does this recipe make a tasty batch of chocolate chip cookies?  Yes.  But they're chocolate chip cookies, for goodness sake.  The bar is set pretty high, and if you claim that your recipe does better at high altitudes than the 3,000 other regular recipes, yours had better deliver.  This one didn't, AT ALL.  I live in Colorado Springs and followed this recipe to the letter.  I even used cold butter, cut in with a pastry mixer, like other high altitude recipes say to do.  Exact same shape, rise, and consistency as every other failed recipe.  Hence the two stars.

These were probably the most delicious chocolate chip cookies I've ever made -- at any elevation.  Made them in Tahoe, CA at about 7000 feet.  I halved the recipe and used just one egg (as opposed to 1 and 1/2 eggs), reduced the flour to 1 and 1/2 cups and doubled the vanilla.  My kids couldn't get enough!  Thanks very much for the great recipe!

Very happy with this recipe, here in Colorado @ 6000 ft!  I used half butter, half crisco.  I also halved the baking soda (1/2 teaspoon).  Depending on your oven (and how well-done you like your cookies): mine took 11.5 minutes to bake to a perfect golden brown.  THANKS!!!

I'm at 6500 feet and followed the recipe precisely. They came out more cakey than I prefer. They're more like soft scones than cookies. I suggest cutting the flour down to 2 3/4 Cups from the instructed 3 1/2. Otherwise, it's a great recipe.

It worked well at around 7000 feet. I shouldn't have added the additional flour though, it made them a bit dry. Next time I'll just follow the original recipe exactly. They were very good though despite the dryness.

I live in Colorado at 10,200 ft above sea level,  I've been struggling with baking since I moved here a few years ago, about to give this a shot, I have a good feeling about this, maybe for once they will turn out! Thanks in advance!

Awesome! I live in Colorado Springs, and these are my Go-To cookies! They stay big and plump! I made cookies like this in Ohio using a bit of bisquick in the mix, but out here it's harder to get cookies to rise and be big and thick! These were perfect! :)

I made these according to the recipe and I'm happy to say they turned out great.  I live at 8100 ft elevation and this is the first time I've had success with a chocolate chip cookie.  The texture is a bit different than a toll house made at sea level, but they still look good.  I did add a bit more flour to the remaining dough as we like our cookies a bit cakey.  Will definitely make again.

I'm at 6000ft.  These came out great!  I made the following changes:  refrigerated dough before baking, increased salt to 1tsp, increased vanilla to 2tsp, increased to 2 cups chocolate chips and substituted 8 ounces cream cheese for the eggs (due to egg allergy in the family).  This recipe is a keeper!

FINALLY a recipe for high altitude that works! I added the extra 1/4 cup flour and a bit more baking soda. I went a bit more scant on the sugars as well. These turned out perfect! I make cookies frequently for my children and for their school events. From Wyoming, thank you!

Made at 6000 feet - worked perfectly.  Kids loved.  Used Boulder's own Chocolove chocolate chips :) No complaints - would give 4 1/2 stars if I could, though, just because I prefer a more sugary, less floury cookie.  Still, my family & friends think these are perfect!

Worked like a charm in Aurora Colorado (5,471 feet). Best chocolate chip cookies I've had since I moved to Colorado. Thank you!

9/14/14 Edit:  I cut the in half and doubled the vanilla (as i have done for every cookie recipe I've ever tried). After baking one batch, which turned out wonderful, I rolled the rest of the dough in to 1 inch balls, placed them on a cookie sheet, and froze them.  A couple hours later, after they were frozen, I moved them to a plastic bag and put them back in the freezer. From frozen to perfect cookie took 17 minutes in my 350? oven. Fresh baked cookies to order whenever I want them. I just cannot get over how delicious I find these cookies: the perfect crisp on the outside, chewy in the middle. Again, my compliments.

These were fantastic. I added a teaspoon of baking powder as well to give them a tiny bit more leavening. It helped! They were very moist for days.

YES! So good! I live at 9,400 ft and this recipe turned out perfectly! I substituted banana and tom's red mill egg replacer for the eggs (1 banana per egg, this always works great in baking and gives the cookies an awesome twist. Only had one banana this time, that's why I used tom's). Added some cinnamon too, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. 

baked on the longer end. 

Thanks!!!!!

I moved to Denver 8 months ago from Florida, and I've had problems with my cookies turning out at altitude even if I adjusted the measurements as recommended. Well, problem solved! These cookies are AMAZING! My fiancé said they're the best I've ever made, and I agree. This is my new go-to recipe for sure. Since we have no self-control around cookies, I made a 1/4 recipe, and it made 16 cookies when I portioned them with a tablespoon.

At 6600' did not flatten, but came out in the shape they went in - little balls. Tasted ok, but won't make again. I wonder if 3 and a half cups of flour was a typo? Saw similar recipes that called for 2 1/4 cups of flour.

I live in Colorado, and this recipe works like magic! I use a mix of semi sweet and dark chocolate chunk, and it's amazing!  I recommend using parchment paper to bake but that's just me :) 10out of10  thank you so much!

Oh my gosh. I live in Colorado Springs (moved here a year ago) and decided to bake some homemade chocolate chip cookies. Well, I didn't think altitude was that big of a deal, so I followed the directions on the back of the Tollhouse chocolate chips...worst idea ever! The cookies were horrible and flat, even after adding more flour/baking soda. 
I looked online and made a new batch with this recipe and they came out perfect! THANK YOU!

I have been in Colorado Springs over 25 years and this is the BEST high altitude choco chip cookie recipe I have EVER made.  My cookies were perfect and NOT FLAT!!!!! I followed the recipe exactly, used butter and left them in the oven for 12 minutes. Fabulous!

I tried this recipe but changed a few things like in stead of adding baking soda I added baking powder and added peanut butter to make it creamier. It was a success!

I have been making these cookies for three years now, since I moved to a mountain town in Colorado - living at 8500 feet. Before finding this recipe, my cookies were horrible, which was tragic (as I love cookies, naturally). But this recipe seriously changed everything. I make no adjustments, apart from adding a little orange extract for a fun twist, and they turn out perfectly every time. I get complimented on them every time I bake them. So grateful for this recipe!

Excellent cookies! Baked them twice so far and turned out perfectly both times... I substituted 1/2 c butter crisco and 1 tbsp water for half the butter though :-)

I live in Colorado and on a quest to learn how to bake in high altitude. I've baked using this recipe twice now, and the cookies turned out great both times. I must be generous with my heaping teaspoon because my dough gives me two dozens cookies instead of four. I use parchment paper after the first batch got stuck on the ungreased cookie sheets. Overall, great recipe.

So, we lived in Colorado Springs, CO and these cookies were perfect! We just moved down to Pueblo, and I went to make the cookies to take to neighbors and such, and they came out super flat (usually they're fluffly and chewy)... So, I tried again, triple checked everything I did, and they still came out extremely flat. What am I doing wrong? Or does anyone have any tips? We're at a little bit lower elevation than Colorado Springs, but it is a LOT dryer here since we are in the desert. I don't know if that affects anything? Thanks!

For a slightly less cakey, ever so slightly more gooey cookie I use 1/4 cup less of flour and sub a 1/4 cup of butter for Crisco (so so worth the calories and fat in this recipe) I also use half milk chocolate chips and half semisweet. Make sure your butter and eggs are room temp! Perfect for Colorado Springs baking. This recipe is scrumptious! With a family of four, the cookies are gone in a few hours at most.  Every time I make these people ask for the recipe, and can't stop praising them. Delicious!.

I'm at 7000 feet - Santa Fe.  Don't know what went wrong; I followed recipe exactly and these were the hardest cookies I've ever, ever had, like stones. The batter was so dry I had to form the cookies by squeezing the dough together.  Seemed to need more moisture.  Hate wasting ingredients like this.  Never again!

I live at 9494 feet and had just about given up on baking cookies.  I've had so many failed attempts.  I'm so glad that I found this recipe.  Many thanks to the person who posted it!  The cookies turned out picture perfect and taste wonderful.  The were nice and puffy.  They remind me of my mom's cookies.  Love these cookies!  I have hope again that I can bake at this altitude!!!!

Delicious. In Colorado and my usual cookies don't bake normally and come out flat. These were just fluffy enough and tasted excellent. Though I did find that if I refrigerated the dough for 30 min to an hour, the cookies came out more full and the chocolate chips even seemed to melt better. Refrigerated dough=perfect cookie!

excellent recipe!  We have tried half a dozen high altitude cookies and none have them have worked out.  These however are excellent!  I followed the recipe perfectly.  Did not change anything.  We live at 9,500 ft.  I will have to give most of these away- or I WILL EAT THEM ALL.

I made these the first time following the recipe exactly and the cookies looked great in the oven, but then fell flat.  I live in suburban Denver at about 5700 feet.  The next time I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 Crisco.  I also used fresh baking soda and made sure not to overmix.  Baking soda is only good for about a month.  The results were much better and tasted great.  This is a great recipe, but you still may have to experiment a little to get the results you want.

These  cookies look great and have good texture, but they definitely lack flavor.  I added the whole bag of chocolate chips and I'm glad I did because that helped make up for the lack of flavor in the dough. Too much flour.

Love! I recently moved from CA to ID and this is the first truly high altitude recipe that has actually worked.  The cookies were chewy and delicious.  The only changes I made were doubling the chocolate chips and removed them from the oven slightly underbaked :)

These cookies came out perfect!!! Having lived at sea level most of my life I have really no idea how to bake at high altitude, this recipe took the guess work out for me. I made 1/2 the recipe then added 1/2 cup walnuts and 1/2 cup toffee peices. Both cookies were great. Thank you for this recipe.

7500 Ft...I like the Tollhouse high altitude recipe better so far...I will keep searching for a better one. These were lacking a little in flavor, and need more chocolate chips. They did not seem to bake up any more than normal recipes.

I grew up in Oregon where altitude never affected cookie recipes but upon moving to Colorado 11 years ago I had yet to find a cookie recipe that made fluffy cookies until I found this one!   I made the recipe exactly as it appears and the cookies turned out beautifully! I left the dough out while batches were cooking and learned that this dough needs to stay on the cooler side to provide optimal results. Also, these cookies are not quite as sweet as the premade doughs you can purchase at stores. But once you move past that, these cookies are delicious and soft!

Baking at high altitude can be tricky, so thanks for sharing this recipe!  I did make just a few adjustments.   I substituted 1/2 c. of Splenda brown sugar mix for 1 c. of brown sugar.  I also used Smart Balance 50/50 for baking instead of regular butter.  Finally, I added 1 c. of Heath bar pieces.  With these adjustments, I had to bake the cookies for the full 15 min., and they spread quite a bit.  However, they still turned out soft and chewy.  Without any adjustments, I'm guessing they would have been perfect -- I'll try that next time! ;-)

Great cookie! The batter is thick and broke my hand mixer, but it was worth it! Will make again and again

I made a half recipe.  It was fairly difficult to mix everything together - the butter was cold because its cold in my house.  But once I did get everything mixed up it worked beautifully.  P.S. I'm in Denver.

Much better results than the High Altitude recipe on the back of the Toll House chip bag. May add a bit more flour next time as it spread more than I liked (but nothing like the regular recipe -- I almost gave up on finding a Chocolate Chip recipe that worked here in Colorado). Cookies are nicely sweet and have good crumb.

Ever since we moved to the mountains, I cannot bake a decent standard chocolate chip cookie. I thought this recipe couldn't turn out worse than mine. I'm glad I tried. Soooo good!! I make giant cookies so I baked them longer. They were crispy on the edges and moist and chewy in the middle. Possibly the best chocolate chip cookie I have ever eaten. Can't wait to hear my husband's opinion.

THANK you!  I have been searching for a good high altitude cookie recipe, and you provided it!  My cookies came out looking puffy and beautiful---no more pancakes!  I added more chocolate chips, about a 1/4 cup of pomegranate seeds and about a cup of fresh cranberries and it still came out awesome.

I tried these as written and were too cakey - I made a few changes for 7500ft.  I used butter flavored shortening + 6 tbsp water instead of the butter and reduced baking time to 10 minutes.  Came out prefect.  I also added 1 cup extra cup of chocolate chips and 1/3 cocoa powder for Chocolate Chocolate Chip cookies.

Did NOT work at 9000+ feet!  Very flat and slightly flavorless.  Bummer, still looking for a good cookie recipe.

Thank you!!! After a year and about 20 batches of mediocre to horrible cookies this recipe is a huge winner. We love them!

The cookie tastes alright, but just like every other cookie I have tried these sunk the minute they came out of the oven.  I guess I'll keep looking.

I added some more chocolate chips and rolled the portions into balls.  They turned out puffy and delicious.  Used dorm room oven AND they turned out wonderfully!  I'll post my pictures as soon as I can.  Thank you!

I have MASTERED sea level toll house, but 9000 ft altitude is another story. I have attempted this recipe several times...with extra flour and less cooking time they don't go too flat, but they don't have a yummy buttery flavor at all. Not sure if it is possible to replicate a sea-level perfect CC cookie but I will keep trying.

I have NEVER successfully baked a batch of cookies before.  They always turn out horrible...but these turned out GREAT!  They are puffy and chewy and just plain awesome!  I added 3/4c of chocolate chips and 3/4c of toffee and chocolate bits just to satisfy my personal preferences! YUM!
