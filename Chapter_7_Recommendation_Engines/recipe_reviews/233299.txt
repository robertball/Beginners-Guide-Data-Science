Great recipe!  Was looking for a hearty egg recipe that would "satisfy" my husband after a long day. I used 6 potatoes to beef it up and 8 eggs.  1/2 cup sour cream and about 1/2 cup chedder cheese on the top.  Took about 1 hour 15 minutes (I cooked the sausage links, peppers, and onions in the same pan, while boiling the potatoes to save time.  Put everything but the cheese in a 11x7 pan.  Cooked at 400 for 15 min, then added shredded cheese for the final 15 minutes.

This was a delicious strata!  My boyfriend and I added basil, thyme and paprika after the egg mixture was poured over the potatoes. The addition of the spices would kick it to a 5 star recipe. Definitely will make this again. Thank you!

This was absolutely delicious!  I cut the recipe in half and still had a good amount leftover.

Husband liked it. Used turkey bacon, which I cooked in oven and turkey sausage, which was watery and not as spicy as regular sausage. So added cayenne pepper, dry mustard and Greek seasoning for more flavor. Cheese turned out brown and crusty. Next time I won't add it til the last 10-15 minutes.
