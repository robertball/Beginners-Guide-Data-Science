This frosting recipe was easy and turned out fabulous. Make sure you cook over medium to medium heat while stirring constantly to obtain a thick consistancy. I'm a grandma and the smell of the brown sugar, milk, eggs and butter cooking reminded me of my first job in the summer of 1963 where I made carmel corn from scratch each day.
This recipe is well worth the little extra effort.

Wonderful frosting!  The key to this thickening up is to stir and cook over medium heat for about 12 minutes.

I'm so glad I made this recipe and not one of the others that were on this site. This one looked a lot easier but didn't have as many ratings.  I decided to give this one a try and it was wonderful!  My husband loves German Chocolate cake and so I made it for his birthday. I decided to go for a home made frosting instead of out of the can, and I'm glad I did. This is easy to make. I boiled it for about 20 minutes on medium, added the nuts and coconut and let cool.  I didn't have to add anything to get it to be thick enough, like I read about in other reviews of other recipes. This one turned out great and my husband loved it!

This German Chocolate Cake Frosting is different from the others because it calls for brown sugar.  Most of the others call for White Sugar.  Brown sugar is what my friends like.  Also, I toasted the pecans and the coconut in a 350 degree oven for 15  minutes.  I hate using partial containers of things like 8 ounces of evap milk from a 12 ounce can, so I upped the other ingredients accordingly...12 oz evap milk, 1 1/2 c sugar, 4 egg yolks, 3/4c butter, etc.  You can't have too much of this frosting.  It's like eating candy.  Thanks, Denise.

Perfect traditional frosting for German Chocolate Cake!  Easy and so-sooooo much tastier than a container of store bought.  The recipe as written wasn't quite enough to frost a double layer 8 inch cake.  I will make an additional 1/2 recipe to this next time - and will double the recipe if making a 3 layer cake.  **After making this a few times since rating I would suggest the following slight changes: 1/2c white & 1/2c brown sugar; also increase the coconut to 2c, pecans to 1.5c;  this perfects a box German Chocolate cake mix if you don't have time for scratch cake & works very well on cupcakes.**

It turned out Delicious, but.... this recipe lacks some key important steps/indicators, as a few other reviews have mentioned.... the "Cook time" is completely wrong at LOW heat. Given that stovetops vary, it would've been helpful to know just how THICK to make it... ie) until it runs off the spoon very slowly. It took almost 30min of stirring to become what I considered thick enough (not even very thick) and that was at 3-4 heat. It would've been nice to know, since I was on a time schedule. I'll make it again probably, but I'll be more prepared for the amount of time this recipe will take!

Initially, I thought this was not very smooth and had an eggy flavor (I added 13c condensed milk to counter this), but it improved after cooling.  My boyfriend loves this frosting. I cooked it for about 20-25 minutes, and it became very thick with a carmel flavor. I toasted the coconut and pecans before adding, and I would definitely recommend this.

This was absolutely the best frosting I have ever had.  Mine turned out great,and it smelled so good while it was cooking.  I could have eaten it all with a spoon rather than putting it on the cake.... YUM!

Fantastic! Delicious frosting for a german chocolate cake. Worth the effort! It tastes about 100 times better than the stuff you buy in the plastic can at the grocery store. I made a boxed german chocolate cake mix to save time, but used this recipe for the frosting and the entire cake was a hit. I made it in a 9x13 pan and there was plenty of frosting, enough so that I could enjoy a little straight from the spoon...you know, for quality control purposes. Will never try another version. It really is THAT good!

Best recipe. You have to have patience when it comes to the mixture thickening. Turn that heat to low or medium, and keep stirring!!!! I made this frosting before. It was a disaster because I didn't follow instructions about the heat and the constant stirring. Second time around I aced it.

I am glad that I took the time to make this rather than opt for store bought filling. NOTE: It takes a long time to thicken. I can see how someone may not be patient enought to let it cook and give up, resulting in runny icing. Just keep stirring and it will happen.

I've used toasted unsweetened coconut and toasted pecans. It turned out great without any modifications. My husband was very happy about his all-from-scratch german chocolate cake.

I made the GC Frosting today and it is spectacular - easy to make and most delicious..  It does require medium heat for about 12-15 minutes..  I will make many times over.

This great.  I adapted it for my food allergens.  I exchanged the evaporated milk for coconut milk (regular) from the can (make sure you stir it well before measuring) for the evaporated milk and used dairy free butter.  It came out great!

I couldn't find my recipe book, so I hopped on here thinking I could find one like my great grandmothers... I noticed the brown sugar, but thought "why not?"   Decent enough to say not to try it, but not good enough for me nor even close to traditional! It tastes way more like caramel and less nutty/coconut as it should be. German chocolate cake icing should NEVER have brown sugar!!! That being said, you have to use way more nuts and pecan dust as well. Sorry, I will stick to my great grandmothers....

This was very good. It has kind of a milky taste to it which is yummy and different than the canned frosting you get from the store. It did take a while to thicken. I have an electric stove and kind of played with the temperature between 2 and 3. It took about 30 minutes for everything to thicken.

My husband requested German chocolate cake for his birthday and I am normally don't bake.  This frosting was delicious.  However, I took the advice of one of the other reveiwers and toasted the pecans and cocount and burnt it!  I had to run to the store to get more pecans and did not toast the second batch and it turned out wonderfully.

The recipe is excellent except, like the others have said..you must cook it on medium and for about 20 minutes...becareful not to ignore the frosting while its cooking, the egg in it will begin to look as if it going to scramble...and you must continually stir it...I found it easy to use a whisk. For this to be my first German Chocolate Cake, it turned out great!

Oh my goodness, loved this frosting! I did temper my egg yolks for a perfectly smooth base before I added the coconut and pecans. I've been looking for this one for years. Thank-you so much. The brown sugar is the secret ingredient.

I boiled the first five ingredients until the mixture reached 208F. It took about 15 minutes on med-high. I doubled the coconut (sweetened, flaked)and pecans just because I love them. Frosting turned out great. Perfect consistency, not too sweet.

This frosting was absolutely delicious! The cake disappeared in less than two days! It was easy to make, and I had no problem getting it to thicken. The key is to cook it on medium heat.

Made this today to frost a boxed German Chocolate cake.  It was delicious.  Very easy recipe.  I thought that I hadnt cooked the mixture long enough because it didnt seem overly thick, but once it cooled it was the perfect consistency.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

1st time I have ever made or tried this type of cake & I found it deliscious.  Everyone else, indcluding two who love German Choc cake said it was the best they'd had.
I toasted the coconut & pecans, and paired this recipe with the Hershey's cocoa buttercream on the sides.

This frosting is simple to make and tastes fantastic! I was a little concerned when the frosting looked a bit 'cloudy' when first finished however, overnight the frosting resting in the refrigerator looked exactly the way it should the next morning for icing the cake.  Great color ~ great texture ~ great taste!  Absolutely delicious!!  Aunt Tilly

The only reason I rate this 4 stars is because, personally, I am not much of a German chocolate cake eater.  But I made this recipe for someone else.  I followed the instructions as much as possilbe (a little difficult for me to get the egg yolk out without much of the white getting into it)  but for the most part, I think I did a good job.  We'll let the person I made this for be the judge.  I made it with my own homemade chocolate cake recipe.  I'll re-post the review from the guest of honor :-)  Update 11/27/2010 Well the guest of honor had the cake and have asked me to make three more, wow!!!  She was having friends over for Thanksgiving and she told me that she had to literally hide the cake because her guests loved it so much.  As a matter of fact, they are the ones that called and placed an order.  Like I said, the German Chocolate Cake isn't a cake of my choice, but I'll be making this a lot more since people seems to love it so much.  Thanks for posting a wonderful recipe.  Kudos to you Denise!!!

Made this frosting, just as listed---it's absolutely amazing. Cooking took approximately 20 min...but well worth the time. I put it between the layers, and on the top, frosting the side with rich mocha frosting (of my own) Soooo good!

This frosting is worth the effort just for how amazing it makes your home smell. But in addition to that,  it also tastes out of this world! Does take a while to thicken properly on medium heat but you'll know when you've hit the sweet spot by the color and amazing Carmel fragrance. Very worth the effort and patience!

This was the best frosting! The hardest part was stirring it for 15 minutes. I followed the advice of others and used the entire 12 oz. can of evaporated milk and adjusted the remaining ingredients accordingly. I made a 13 x 9 German chocolate cake and was able to put frosting in the middle and frost the top. My advice is not to have the heat too high because I noticed some of the egg starting to scramble a bit. I immediately turned the heat down. I ended up straining the liquid mixture to make sure I had no egg in the frosting and to keep it creamy. I then added the pecans and coconut. I did toast the pecans a coconut a for about 10 minutes and 300 degrees. I let the frosting cool and it thickened up nicely! I highly recommend this!

Love, love, love this simple recipe for coconut & pecan frosting for german chocolate cake.  This is the same base recipe I use for making homade caramel frosting.  *Note cook frosting for about 20 minutes to get it to thicken then let cool as previously stated.

This was my first attempt at homemade german chocolate frosting and it turned out amazing! I am a scratch cook who is extremely health conscious and this was a special Valentine's treat for my sweetheart to top the homemade healthier chocolate cupcakes I made. I used sugar in the raw in place of the brown sugar (I don't keep any type of refined sugar in the house)  and fat free evaporated milk. I also swapped out the pecans for chopped almonds because I was out of pecans and it still turned out great. I cooked it on medium until it started to bubble and then I reduced the heat a notch and stirred until it thickened. Yum!

Made this for my nieces birthday. I toasted the coconut and pecans before adding and that was the ticket! I doubled the recipe and had a cup left over after generously frosting double layered cake so I made another cake 3 days later. Very good.

I bought the store bought German chocolate cake and wanted to make homemade frosting.  I had a time constraint and am naturally a very slooow baker/cook, but was able to whip this frosting up in a hurry!  And it was delicious!  The people at the party loved it.  I did turn the heat up to medium/high to thicken it up faster, about 12min of constant stirring like another reviewer mentioned.  Worth it.

This turned out too thin for my liking. The taste, however, was phenomenal! A few tips:
first, I doubled the recipe. As one of the other reviews pointed out - it's a wast to dump 1/2 a cup of evaporated milk. I was making three layers anyhow, so I needed the extra frosting. I added 1/2 cup coconut milk to make 2 cups of 'milk'. 
next, I toasted my pecans and coconut. This really pronounced the flavors of each.
thirdly, after simmering the liquid on the stove before adding the nuts and coconut, I strained it through a fine mesh strainer to catch any cooked egg white that might have slipped in. It was tricky getting all of the white out when separating the yolks.
lastly, in order to thicken it I really didn't want to stand over the stove for 20 minutes and risk cooking the egg or changing the sugar composition so I cheated and added about 1/3-1/2 cup flour (for the doubled recipe) after I had chilled it in the fridge for an hour. This did NOT alter the flavor or texture in any significant way. I even did taste tests between that and other thickening agents and this trumped all others.

This frosting is very good. To lower the cholesterol, I omitted all egg yolks and instead dissolved one tsp cornstarch in one Tbsp evaporated milk. I added this while cooking and it was thickened in 20 minutes.

Versatile and easy.  I scaled it down to 1/3 the size and substituted heavy cream for the evaporated milk.  Very rich and very delicious.  Wish I'd had pecans or walnuts on hand -- would have been even better!  Slathered it all over a tiny chocolate cake over some chocolate icing.  Yum!

This is my go-to German Chocolate Cake recipe.  The biggest challenge most people might have is NOT cooking it long enough on the stove.  Just having it bubbling is not enough; I use a wooden spoon for stirring and when it coats the spoon heavily, I then cook for another 5 minutes!!  I can't say enough about this fantastic recipe.

Made this today and it came out perfect!  I see there are some reviews that have problems with thickening.  Please remember that the recipe calls for butter.  Not margarine.  Most margarine has water content and or vegetable oil which may effect the thickening process.  Took about 15 minutes on low heat to thicken.  This recipe I will use again.

An excellent recipe!  A couple of alterations I made to it were...
1) as other reviewers suggested, cooking it on med/low to med heat, but I only stirred occasionally.  
2) I found it to be a bit thin even after the cooking process, so I just added more coconut (approx 1/2 to 1 cup additional).

Next time I make this (and I most definitely will), I may cut down on the sugar a bit as I typically use sweetened coconut.

Super easy!  I had all the ingredients in my well-stocked pantry!  I made a chocolate pound cake and it needed 'something'.  I decided to try this frosting!  Superb!  I read others that used sweetened condensed milk and had the same amount of sugar in their recipe.  I felt that might be too sweet.  I'm sure glad I followed my gut!  This is perfectly balanced, not too sweet and certainly sweet enough for cake!  I printed it and will add it to my home cookbook!

Okay so I made this.  I read some reviews.  Some said it takes 30+ minutes to thicken up.  I don't know about you, but when I add milk, sugar and egg together and heat, it's like a pudding...  I've messed up enough puddings and custards to know that cooking it for 30 minutes will result it something terrible.  I think I spent about 15 minutes in the kitchen putting the cake in the oven, making this frosting and a chocolate butter cream frosting (for those who won't eat coconut or nuts).  I had to run kids and my husband could handle taking the cake out.  And my frosting was super thick and yummy!  It was even thick enough I could really pile it on to be thicker than the butter cream side.  Something that rarely happens with other recipes.   It's just that good you guys!!!  I will never use another recipe.

The only change I had while making this was too turn heat to medium. It does take about 15-20 minutes to thoroughly thicken to a nice consistency for frosting.   But it did. The taste is fabulous.

This is an AMAZING RECIPE. I have no idea how this has bad reviews!!!! I contimplated making this and just finally decided to go for it. Made it without nuts and it still turned out incredible. Only downside is that you might get splattered with hot delicious Carmel. Worth it in the end.. 
Added 2 cups coconut and toasted it until golden brown.

I love this recipe!!!  Cooked for about 12 minutes, as recommended by another reviewer...it turned out great.   Really I think the 3 egg yolks help thicken the whole thing up as well...no need for any corn starch!   Fabulous smell, and even better tasting!

Great recipe! I couldn't find mine and went in search of a new one. I always toast the coconut and pecans and I did this time too. Great frosting!

VERY easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly. I didn't time how long I cooked it, but it was probably close to the 12 min recommendation. It was very thick after it cooled off. Love this!

The people who said you have to cook it on  a little higher heat and longer are right.  It is way too thin if you don't.  I've tried the canned frosting and I never loved it but bought it again because I wanted to save time but it has a chemical taste to it so I ended up making this anyway!

Low heat and 10 minute cooking is laughable.  After 22 minutes of stirring on 3, I raised the heat to 5, which is medium.  Continued stirring for ten more minutes finally got it to thicken.

Tastes good!  I was using it on brownies, so eliminated the coconut and doubled the pecans.

I never made this kind of frosting before. I only did it out of necessity. However, I was surprised by how easy it was to make and how delicious it tasted! It was excellent. I didn't know how "thick" thick should be, so I almost gave up. I think I cooked it about 15 minutes before I was satisfied with it and for extra measure I added more coconut than the recipe called for to make sure it was thick enough. Turned out perfect. Thanks!!

This frosting turned out perfect. I doubled the batch because I was making a BIG cake. I ended up having enough left over to freeze and make another. It was awesome both times! My mum literally had multiple family members *hint* that she wanted the same German Chocolate Cake I made with this frosting recipe for Mother's Day. She also told me herself, about three times :) It was a hit and everyone loved it. I didn't change a thing! Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is a traditional recipe for frosting a German chocolate cake. If you spend the time to cook it slowly on med heat, and continue to stir it will thicken. It has a rich carmel color and looks as good as it tastes. This is the one! Oh, and if you don't like your frosting super sweet, I used unsweetened flaked coconut (Bobs Red Mill)

While the flavor is really good, the color seems somewhat off and it so didn't set!!  I must have added at least a 1/3 cup of corn starch to get it to set and then there seemed to be a predominate eggy flavor.  Once it cooled, it mostly set up and the eggy flavor was lost in the cake but it wasn't what I'd hoped for.

Ive never had German Chocolate, so i didnt know how thick the frosting was supposed to be. It tastes pretty good but this recipe could be a bit more helpful if it had how many minutes of stirring. I possibly stood for half an hour and my frosting is still runny :( im cooling it in the fridge to see if itll thicken :)

this was just ok.  needs salt, cook low about 20-30 min to thicken properly.  This was too sweet using store bought coconut.  grate your own and toast it in the oven.  If I make it again with packaged coconut, need to reduce the sugar.

This is so very easy AND so very delicious.  The first time I tried it I was out of pecans...and even walnuts substituted in this were delicious.  Since then, I've used the pecans.  I've tried slightly browning the nuts and coconut before adding them to the cooked mixture, and like that a little bit better--but either way, this recipe is a WINNER! Thanks Denise!

Followed recipe ratio exactly although I made 1/2 a batch to frost a "Big Top" cupcake (as seen on TV) for my daughter's birthday party. I also cooked on medium stove top heat for 20 minutes--well worth the effort--no skins, no lumps! The taste is much more flavorful than the store bought stuff!

This was a very good homemade traditional frosting for German chocolate cake.  I baked this cake for a good friend's birthday and everyone raved about how delicious the frosting was!  It was perfect. Thanks for the recipe and to all of the comments.  I agree with other reviewers I had to cook it closer to 20 minutes to reach the right consistency.

I prepared this recipe exactly as directed and realized that stirring it on "low" was NOT going to work. I then looked at some other reviews and discovered that many others had commented that the heat needs to be at medium-medium-high, I tried that and it helped, but that was after I stood at the stove stirring it on "low" for about 30 minutes with no resulting thickening. Once you make that change, it's a pretty simple recipe.

Wow! What a great GC frosting recipe. Roasting the coconut and pecans really added to the rich flavor. Long cooking time (12 min) but the end product made it worth the effort for my family and friends!

AMAZING. I never even liked German chocolate cake until I tried my grandma's about a month ago. I had a craving but I was like, "No way am I going to be able to pull this off." Especially seeing as some other recipes people were saying their's never thickened. My first try and I nailed it! I added more pecans than coconut though and it was PERFECT. A+

Easier than I thought it was going to be. Growing up I loved this kind of frosting, thought I could only get it out of a can. (not a big baker) I have never made a frosting you had to cook before. It took a little longer to thicken than I thought it would. It was worth the time. Everyone loved it!

I think this recipe is missing a crucial step-a time indicator of actually how long you must stir this frosting in order for it to thicken.  The taste of the frosting is good, however, the very long amount of time involved for it to thicken on the stovetop was not worth the time spent.

First time making this icing. I doubled the recipe to fill 3 layers and cover the entire cake. I had to cook a little longer because it was doubled. It turned out perfect and delicious.

So simple and delicious!  It takes buttery and caramelly. I lost my old recipe to German Chocolate Cake Frosting and I'm glad I did because I got to try this one.  My husband is German and he went crazy over this frosting!  Thank you!

This recipe is definitely a keeper....except the directions should be to cook the frosting on MEDIUM heat for about 10 minutes instead of low heat. Stir constantly and mixture will thicken. Add coconut and pecans, stir together and let cool to room temp. Perfect!

This frosting is a labor of love but well worth it! I made it for my husbands birthday. It took almost 30 minutes to thicken up, but it finally did. I made exactly as the recipe was written and cooked it at medium. It was just enough to frost the outside of a two layer 9 inch round cake, luckily I had another frosting I intended on using for the filling. Everyone loved it!

I really wish someone would define "until thick" for this recipe. I made it exactly as directed and declared it thick enough when it coated the spoon, as another reviewer suggested.  I let it cool down to room temperature before frosting. It has been a couple of hours since then and it hasn't started to "set". I suspect I did not let it cook long enough. Good flavor though.

This is a great recipe!!
The caramel is so creamy and sticks to the sides of a double layer,  round cake. 
I used the one bowl chocolate cake recipe. 
Amazing!! Thank you for the best recipes,  Allrecipes

For those who are high altitudes please adjust this recipe. I will attempt this recipe again after I clean my oven. I baked this in the listed size pan and it doubled in size spilling all over inside my oven.   It smells good.anyways. And I will update my rating then.

Delicious! I was a little nervous how it would turn out, as I only had nonfat evaporated milk. But it still set up just fine, and was appreciated by all who enjoyed it!

Love this kind of frosting! The changes I made was to double the recipe because I like a lot of frosting and I substituted heavy cream instead of the evaporated milk. It makes it SO much better!!!

Only thing different is I toasted the nuts and coconut and used 12 oz of evaporated milk. Love this recipe on a 12x9. I’ll take into consideration other reviews for increasing for layers. Also made this with a Duncan Hines mix  so it paired really nice

I made the recipe as stated. I would not change a thing.  I appreciated the r3views that reminded me that it may take a while to thicken up.  I used medium heat and used the stirring time to dream about how good this frosting would taste.   It received rave reviews, it was worth the effort and I will definitely make it again.

This frosting got rave reviews but I did follow the suggestions of Chey1 and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and upped the coconut to 2 cups and the pecans to 1.5 cups.  I generously frosted 2 dozen cupcakes and it was delicious!!

This is a great recipe for Coconut/Pecan icing for German  chocolate cake. Followed the directions as written, except took a hint from other reviewers and cooked on medium heat. Mine took about thirteen minutes. Someone mentioned the lack of specificity in the directions, that is a title true, but I have been baking for over 60 years so it was not a problem. I would say one thing to look for is the mixture starts to change color, then it is near done. Also remember you are adding a lot of pecans and coconut. Taste is totally  wonderful

Not as thick and Carmelly like  would like.  I’ll try to double brown sugar, increase egg yolk and will just have to place with it.  Right now Sauce runs thru cake and leaves coconut and pecans on top of cake.

This recipe was awesome and easy to make.  It's all in the frosting sometimes.

Even though I accidentally left out the butter, and left it to sit for 5 hours before frosting the cake, and the frosting was cold,  and the cake was still a bit warm, it all worked and tasted great!

I made this cake and it was great, My mom used to make this cake, and it was nice to have that taste again. I didn't use wax paper on my Pans and the oil and flour seemed to weigh it down a little and it still came out great. Thank you

I followed the recipe using the 12 ounces of evaporated milk and adjusted the other ingredients--basically making one and a half recipe.  I cooked it over medium heat for 17 minutes on my gas stove stirring constantly with a whisk.  I will use this recipe again.  Tastes sooooo good!

I'm so bummed!  I read everyone's comments and cooked on medium for about 20 minutes until it thickened, added the pecans & coconut and set it aside to cool. When I went back to frost my cake it was hard & clumpy. It looked so good when it was cooking too :(

I decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 C and it was plenty sweet.  My opinion is that we use entirely too much sugar  which masks the flavor of the foods it sweetens. I only frosted in between the 2 layers and the top (see photo) so if you frost the sides you will need to make more frosting. It looked like it wasn't going to thicken so I put it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes which did the job.

I tweaked the recipe just a bit. Like some others mentioned I toasted the coconut and the nuts ( didn’t have enough pecans so I supplemented with almonds). I also added 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp butter flavoring.

I cooked the sauce on medium heat for 20 minutes, stirring the entire time. It didn’t start to really thicken until around 16 minutes. I used dark brown sugar and it made the sauce seem a little grainy but once you add the pecans and coconut, it’s not noticeable. Very yummy!!

This was a good frosting, a little too runny but I may have not let it cook down enough. I toasted my coconut beforehand and added it after the mixture cooled so it wasn’t super soggy and got a ton of compliments!

Two things. Current amounts will NOT satisfy needs for a cake with two round layers. I suggest doubling or tripling. Also, highly suggest melting butter first then adding additional ingredients. Otherwise, you may end up with weird buttery clumps that don’t breakdown.

This recipe was simple enough that I was able to do it right on my first try, making my mother's day cake perfect.  The frosting is so much better than the canned stuff. I'll be using this recipe again for sure.

With all the great reviews I was expecting to be over the top with it but I really wasn’t. It was good but just nothing outstanding and definitely need to make more for 24 cupcakes to get a decent mound of frosting on each one.

Perfect 1st time. Used 12 oz evaporated milk, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white granulated sugar, 4 egg yolks, and 2 teaspoons vanilla. This is like making custard to keep the eggs from "scrambling" during cooking. I used a 6 quart Dutch oven over low heat and constantly stirred for about 10 minutes. I can see where using a smaller sauce pan can take much longer. 

Toasted coconut flakes and chopped pecans together in baking pan for 15 minutes at 325 deg. until golden brown prior to mixing in. OMG, we were eating warm frosting out of the Dutch oven.

Who needs cake, this stuff is heaven on a spoon!  For anyone wondering about the cooking time and consistency, I started at medium heat (5 on my electric stove), and once it started boiling I lowered it to 4, stirring continuously with a whisk.  I ended up lowering to 3 because it was boiling pretty intensely.  I checked it at 12 minutes but it seemed a little thin still, so I went till 15 minutes.  At that point it was the consistency of lumpy homemade applesauce, which seemed good. I added the nuts and coconut (sweetened), let it cool and used it to make cupcakes.  It’s a nice lumpy sticky consistency and appears to be staying put!  I had plenty to heap a nice big pile on 24 cupcakes.

No changes needed. This is the easiest and best tasting frosting ever. I won't buy store bought German Choclate Frosting ever again. There is no comparison in the taste. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I followed the directions except I toasted the walnuts and coconut on a cookie sheet for about 8 minutes at 350 degrees. The frosting thickened up just fine. It looked like bubbling hot mud you see in National Geographic shows of Yellowstone mud geysers. It was the perfect thickness.

This is definitely a keeper recipe. The frosting  was better than the cake, but that is usually true with all German chocolate cakes.

This recipe was perfect! I added more pecans and coconut, to taste.  I did not make any addditional modifications other than to cook on medium to medium high heat, otherwise you’ll be stirring forever.  The results were delicious.

Great tried and true recipe!   Used fat free evaporated milk and it was still creamy and great! Liked this recipe because of the brown sugar rather than white sugar.    Definitely my go to recipe for German Chocolate Cake Frosting! Agree with comments about cooking time - takes longer on low - next time I will use medium heat. Very happy with recipe and recommend it.

My husband liked it. However I did not add coconut or pecans and for me, it affected the flavor I'm used to. My husband cannot eat coconut or pecans, but loves the cake, go figure lol. Thanks for sharing

SUPER easy recipe.
I don't know how much of a difference it made, but I toasted the coconut and pecans before stirring them in the liquid mixture (which is what we did when making german icing at the bakery I used to work at).  Turned out great and I couldn't stop sneaking some in my mouth while frosting my cake.

This is a bit of heaven! Our family loves anything with toffee (brown sugar and butter) so this was the perfect recipe for my birthday. I had never considered making it before. I did use medium for cooking it in a thick bottomed pan and stirred constantly as suggested. I almost went a little longer, but it looked about to separate. Put all ingredients in cold to make sure that it doesn't do that, as I've had issues in the past with melting the butter then adding sugar and the consistency not working quite. Covered one box of cake made into muffins with about a half cup left over.

Very tasty. A nice rich caramel toffee flavor. I had enough to frost about 15 cupcakes. I roasted the pecans and coconut. Next time I would just toast the coconut and not the pecans. I too cooked on medium, constantly stirring for 20+ minutes.

Everyone loved this frosting!  It was very easy to make, seemed like it took a little longer than ten minutes to thicken.  I also had a hard time spreading it evenly over the two layer round cake.  Next time I would double the recipe to have plenty.

Be sure that you mix the egg yolks in well to the liquid before you start heating!  I let them float for a minute or two and ended up with little pieces of yolk that I had to strain out.  It's best to add the pecans and coconut after the mixture has thickened.  I used unsweetened coconut and it came out great!

This is awesome tasting! 
For the record I would change the directions to indicate to cook it until it starts gently boiling.
I cooked for about 10 minutes, stirred in pecans and coconut, let come to room temp and it was way too runny.
So I put it back on the stove at a bit higher heat (3 on my stove) and cooked it until it started gently bubbling. Cooked for about 2 minutes at the bubbling stage. It's cooling now and I think will be perfect.

This was amazing, however, I did make a few changes. I agree with using medium heat instead of low. I used all organic ingredients but I think the biggest difference was the coconut. I used unsulphered/unsweetened coconut and it gave this the greatest flavor and  perfect sweetness! Sometimes German chocolate frosting is sickingly sweet to me and probably because the sweetened coconut adds so much extra sugar. This was a HUGE hit with my family and I will always make this one.

I made this frosting for the first time, following the recipe EXACTLY as written.  The timing is way, way off.  It took four times as long to cook than listed.  I stirred, stirred, stirred, and stirred some more before it became thick.  The flavor was good but nothing extraordinary about it.  Much too time consuming.

The frosting turned out delicious.  But the instructions are so vague that I feel compelled to lower my rating, and next time I'll look for a similar recipe that has better instructions.  What does "thick" mean?  At a minimum, there should be some description of how to know I'm done cooking.  I thought it might be obvious because of a sudden, dramatic thickening of the mixture, but that never happened.  It very slowly got thicker over the course of half an hour or so.  When I finally decided to remove it from the heat, I wasn't sure if I should add the coconut and nuts because I didn't want to waste them if it didn't thicken up enough as it cooled!  But I risked it, and the frosting turned out great.  I probably didn't even have to spend as long as I did cooking.  I have a candy thermometer, so maybe next time I'll look for a recipe that specifies the temperature at which I can turn off the heat.

As a side note, I noticed after a few minutes of cooking that my egg yolks were still in a bowl on the counter, so I tempered them and added them in.  That may have had no effect on the final outcome, but I saw in the reviews that some people intentionally added their eggs later, so I thought I'd mention it.

This was a bit too sweet for me.  I knew that it would be quite sweet when I decided to make it, so I used unsweetened coconut and added a pinch of salt  to try and off-set the sweetness.  It was still very good, but not sure I'll make again.

First time I've made German choc frosting...I haven't cut the cake yet.but the taste i took from the pot was DELISH!!  It looks beautiful and set up perfectly.i used medium heat and stirred constantly for 20-25 mins...you must have patience for the right consistency...i did add a few extra pecans the bag comes in 1 and half cups so i just used the whole bag...very pleased with this recipe...it really WAS tasty and easy..p.s. I also toasted pecans and coconut before adding....which i think gave this the mmm factor....everyone loved the cake!!!

This icing was so easy and tasted great. I agree to let it cook longer to thicken up. As it cools it gets to the right thickness to spread.

This was super easy and delicious!  Cooking it at medium-medium high thickened it up in about 15 minutes.  This is a keeper!

This recipe is so delicious. I cooked it on medium heat to obtain the proper consistency. I didn't have pecans, so I used coconut and crushed pretzels. The pretzels gave it really good salty sweet taste.

I am not a fan of frosting nor cake, not really even German Chocolate Cake, but I decided to make this because my husband loves Germab Chocolate.  I had to cook it over medium heat, much like several other people, and after a little over 10 minutes it was thick. It is so delicious I can't stop eating it.

For those concerned about it not thickening. I cut the 1 cup of evaporated milk to 2/3 cup instead and it thickened in no time. Furthermore, I used a fork to stir together egg yolks, vanilla,  brown sugar and evaporated milk before adding it to the butter that was slowly melting over my medium heat saucepan. Then I wisked the mixture for about 3-5 minutes until everything was completely combined and thickened.

I made this frosting and it turned out wonderful. I used sweetened condensed milk and only a third cup of brown sugar. I tasted it until I got the correct amount of sweetness.I did carefully toast the pecans but not the coconut. I will try toasting the coconut next time but do not know if it could taste any better.

I made this scrumptious frosting exactly like the recipe. I'm with the person who said give it 12 minutes to cook. The frosting gets thicker as it cools.

My dads favorite cake is German chocolate cake! I used this recipe for the icing and it was delicious! Some of my family do not eat nuts so I split the icing half with and half without. Then ice the cake that way. Still everyone loves it.

It's not even on the cake yet and I can't stop tasting it!  I will update when I get the rating back from my dad who wanted a german chocolate cake like his mom used to make for his birthday. Like others said 20-25 min of stirring mmmmmm...

Dad said it tastes just like his mama's cake, and that's a pretty tough standard to meet. I made the Black Magic cake from this website to accompany the frosting.

Delicious!  I used organic evaporated milk and cultured butter from Trader Joe's.  The frosting is DELICIOUS!  Definitely stand over it obsessively stirring and stirring.  It will thicken suddenly, it seems.  Worth the effort!

Added an extra pinch of salt.  This is the best coconut pecan icing around.  Be patient and keep stirring! As long as you scaled everything correctly,  it will thicken.  Went excellent using chocolate chiffon cake recipe.

START TIMING ONCE ITS AT A ROLLING BOIL. ***It WILL thicken it just takes about 25 min from boiling pint to a nice thick caramely topping. (Stirring constantly) 
Once you add in the coconut and I used walnuts, it's super gooey and thick let cool in fridge! You will not be disappointed!
I also used canned coconut milk (left over from am count cake recipe) turned out great!

This frosting is amazing.  I made increased the serving size to 18 to cover a 9 inch 2 layer cake.  I also read a review that said to let the mixture cook for 12 minutes, I did that and it thickened up perfectly.

Quick. Easy. Great flavor. A little bit on the runny side, but maybe if you cook it longer or add more pecans and coconut, it will thicken for you. Toasted and salted the pecans to give it a more finished texture. It looked unfinished with just this frosting, so I finished the edges with a chocolate butter cream. (Made this for Megan and Mike. It's their anniversary this month! They were delighted and said it was very, very good.)

Tastes good.  I stirred for 45 min on low to med low heat. Not only didn't it thicken, but it won't set up.  My husband's birthday is tomorrow and his favorite cake is german chocolate. Ok, after not being happy with the outcome, and not being one to be defeated so easily, I turned the stove back on-to med. As it warned back up, I raised the temp just slightly more. I let it come to a boil for about 5 minutes longer. Stirring all the while. It thickened to a degree that appeased me, and removed it from the heat.

Great topping for a box cake mix.  Makes it taste like home made.  Be patient - it takes time for the topping to thicken but worth the wait.

Great recipe! Authentic taste. It was a little dry but that was my fault. Make sure you keep a close eye on the cooking times. I made a double batch of icing which was too much. I think 1 1/2 as much would be plenty. Of course I only made two layers. It was a very dense therefor it should go a long way. The icing took a long time to thicken so I had to turn up the heat, but be cared

Made according to recipe, however used finely chopped almonds, as that is what I had on hand. Turned out great! Be patient when cooking this, and turn up the heat to medium. Keep stirring and you will notice the wonderful fragrance and amber color. 12-15 minutes was about correct for it to thicken. Just be careful not to overcook. I took off heat and added coconut and almonds. I poured on a cooled chocolate 9x13 when the frosting was still somewhat warm. Was worth the effort! Plus, you can't get the wonderful caramel smell wafting through your home out of a can of frosting. Is nice on a cold evening!

This is a great recipe but can be improved if you use whole milk or half and half instead of the canned milk. I don't like the taste of canned (evaporated milk). I made it both ways and it's much better with whole milk or half and half. I actually used 1/2 cup of whole milk and 1/2 cup of half and half. I only used 2 egg yolks in mine and it came out great. As others have said this is more of a Carmel icing, but it is really good. Got rave reviews from my family. It is just enough to ice between the layers and on top of the cake, so if you like the sides iced also, double the recipe. This also freezes well (if there's any left:)

Loved this recipe! Big hit at super bowl party! I used this to dress up a boxed brownie mix. Only change I made was adding extra coconut, and used 2% low fat evaporated milk. Results were the same. I followed other reviewer's comments and cooked on med/med high temp for approximately 10-15 mins. It's better in a good way than the canned junk. I will never buy store bought again!

This was super easy to make! I cooked it for 15 min over med heat. It thickened up quicker than I expected after reading the reviews. My husband loved it! This is a keeper for sure!

A candy thermometer comes in handy while making this.  It should get to 170 degrees to make sure eggs are safe.  I cooked mine over medium-low heat until it hit 170 and then for another few minutes, during which it got really thick.  Then took it off the burner to add coconut and nuts. Turned out great.

I needed some frosting for my brownies, and this recipe was perfect. I had three extra large eggs, but as I am no juggler, one fell and broke on the kitchen floor, so I used two extra large egg yolks, cooked the frosting for about 20 minutes on low, whisking constantly. I made no other changes, and let the frosting cool for about an hour. I had no problems with the frosting being too thin, even with just two eggs! I like the richness that the brown sugar gives to the final product. I will NEVER purchase German chocolate cake frosting again. This is a far superior product!

Loved it. I used sliced almonds instead of the pecans for my grandpas birthday cake. Filled the cake with this and then iced the outside with dark chocolate ganache. So yummy!

I wish I could give it honestly more than 3 stars but this frosting didn't hold up to what I expected of it. It never thickened and it tasted ok. Betty Crocker has a German chocolate cake frosting called Rich & Creamy Coconut Pecan frosting that just taste fabulous and with the right consistency of thickness to stay put on the cake. It didn't cost a lot so I will stick to just buying it since my Husband and Kids  liked that one better as well.

This is magnificent!  I needed a German chocolate birthday cake, and my attempt to make the cake from scratch resulted in absolute garbage.  I decided to doctor up a box cake and hide it under the most fabulous frosting I could make.  This fit the bill!  Why buy a tub of preservatives when a few minutes time and some simple ingredients results in this?  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Absolutely the best German Chocolate Cake frosting I've ever made! Thanks for this great recipe. The only thing I found was you must cook this on medium-medium high heat stirring constantly to get that thick creamy texture.

First time making this, didnot know what to expect because I doubled the recipe but had trouble to getting it thick on low heat but after reading reviews on here helped me a lot.  Donnot be afraid to bump the heat up so it can boil.  That was the biggest help....turned out to be so good.

It tasted good - very caramel.  Since it doesn't say how thick to cook it, I cooked and cooked and it never got thicker (40 min).  Then when it cooled it was the consistency of play dough. We stuck it to the birthday cake anyhow. Next time I will buy the stuff from the store.

German Chocolate Cake is prob my most favorite so I picked up a box the other day with intentions of making home-made frosting. I have made this type of frosting many times,so right now I am calling myself all kinds of nasty names as I choose to go off course & put a few changes in Denise's receipe. . So today I decided to toast both the coconut & nuts that went into the frosting. Big mistake as I over cooked them twice & waisted money on those darned pecans,not happy with myself. I have made this frosting many times, one nearly like it anyway & it always came out good but I also know that toasting nuts bring out more flavor so that is why I tried & didn't go back & research oven temp. Instead I just did them @ 325 degrees with my cake, plus I chopped them up first , prob another mistake. I do suggest putting the icing on while it is still warm, have always done it that way. Sueh48

Wonderful! Used half a cup of evap milk (just what I had open in the fridge) and half a cup of whole milk. Cooked for 12 minutes but ended up putting in a little corn starch for insurance. Turned out perfect and so delish! I will never, ever buy German chocolate frosting from the store again!

This is the first time I have made German Chocolate frosting instead of buying the can.  This recipe is wonderful!  It was easy.  I doubled it and it turned out great.  The flavor, texture, and consistancy are perfect.  SO much better than the can!

I have to agree with WiddoMouse! This is the most decadent German Chocolate Frosting I have ever tasted. Having never made this frosting before, I did some reading. I liked the brown sugar part and then WiddoMouse said to toast the pecans and the coconut...to die for! I too too her suggestion and used a full can of evaporated mile and upped the rest of the recipe accordingly. This is just the best and I can't wait to serve it to fellow employees tomorrow for a birthday cake!

This recipe was incredibly easy to make and tasted absolutely delicious! I poured ganache over the layers of cake and used the frosting for the center of the cake and the top leaving the ganache for the sides leaving it beautiful and tasty!

This recipe was super easy! After one failed attempt with another recipe, this one was a blessing! Perfect! I also used almonds instead of pecans. Still tastes good.

great recipe!  I almost gave up on it at first when I couldn't get it to thicken, but then I read the reviews that said to cook it on medium/high instead of low, and it worked great!

This was very easy and so tasty.  I made a German Chocolate cake for my husbands birthday and this just took it over the top.  Definitely a keeper!

Loved it!  I took the many recommendations and toasted both the coconut and the pecans.  I too cooked it for almos 20 minutes to get it to the right consistency.  Thank you so much!
