This makes for an easy and good cookie, but I prefer to used canned chow mein noodles instead of the shoestring potatoes.  The shoestring potatoes are much more salty and greasy.  The chow mein noodles add the right crunch and taste better with the chips and peanut butter.  Also try adding peanuts or other nuts to them.  I also don't add the oil.  It just isn't necessary.  The chips melt fine and the peanut butter adds plenty of oil.

Being an anti-baker, I chose this recipe for our Christmas cookie exchange.  A little on the messy side to make and clean-up.  Tastes just like a Reeses cup with crunch.  I also used the whole 7oz can of shoestring potatoes.  For presentation purposes, I used the "truffle" paper cups to serve.  They melt fast, so you don't want to handle them alot.  Kids loved to help stir the chocolates together on the stove.

This recipe uses the shoestring potato sticks (I used an entire 7oz can) that are found in the potato chip aisle of your local grocer.

Fast, tasty, and fun to make with the kids.  There are so many possible add-ins and variations you'll never get bored.  Quick and easy with little clean up.

The recipe tastes great, but didnt resemble haystacks. Next time I make them I plan on increasing the amount of  potato sticks to soak up/bind with the peanutbutter/chocolate mixture so  the cookies will look like haystacks. Also I keep mine in the freezer.

I wanted to run out and buy ingredients immediately, but I was confused on the potatoes.  Are we talking about canned shoestring potato snacks, or frozen shoestring cut french fries? The description shown when I added this to my Shopping List didn't help either.

We liked this! Melted the peanut butter and chocolate chips in the microwave.  Takes 3 min. Used double the potato stix and no oil.  Using natural peanut butter balanced the saltiness of the potato stix.  Came out great and so easy!

I used chow mein noodles for the shoestring potatoes and cocoa butter for the canola oil. Very good!
