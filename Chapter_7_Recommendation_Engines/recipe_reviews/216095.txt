I did not care for this.  Although made according to the directions [exactly] 2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning is way too much and is the only thing you can taste. I don't know if the writer made a typo, but I suggest if you try to make this cut the seasoning way back.
 
I will make it again, but skip the seasoning altogether and use a bit of my favorites.

This was really, really good. The smokey flavor of the turkey legs made this a very hearty soup on a cold night. Served it with garlic bread and a tossed salad. Next time I will add chicken broth as added liquid while it is cooking instead of water. I also did not add any salt as the smoked turkey added enough saltiness.

I used vegetable broth instead of water and turkey kielbasa instead of turkey legs added garlic salt. Very tasty!

I am hestitant to try recipes that have few reviews, but this one sounded very good to me and I am so glad that I took the chance.  My husband and I both loved this soup!  Since I wanted to make it right away I didn't soak the beans overnight.  Instead I rinsed the beans and covered with water and brought to a boil.  I let them boil for 2 minutes and then turned off the heat and left them covered for 1 hr.  I then strained the beans and added fresh water.  I couldn't find "smoked" turkey legs, so I
bought the fresh legs that were available.  I made a sauce out of Lea & Perrins white wine sauce for Chicken, a few drops of liquid smoke, and a pinch of Italian seasoning.  We grilled the turkey legs on the bbq coated with the sauce first.  After a about 20 minutes I added the legs to the beans.  I also added one can of chicken broth and didn't use as much water.  Will make this soup many times!

I'm glad I only used one smoked turkey leg. It was plenty meaty. This was a good soup for a cold night. I did up the seasoning, add garlic and add some red pepper flakes for a little kick. Topped with fresh parsley too. None of my kids liked it. :(

Oh so good!!!! Had to sub tomatoes for potatoes due to acid reflux, then added spinach and heavy cream, no parmesan needed, it was divine. Hubby requested for it to be on permanent rotation.

I loved this soup! I used home made chicken stock to cook the beans in after they soaked in water overnight- I also used mixed beans- pinto and great northern. I also just used 1 smoked turkey leg and that was plenty! I also used rotel tomatoes, garlic powder and some red pepper flakes.I used somewhat less than 2 Tb. of italian seasoning- but I think this is what helps MAKE this soup!  I think this is the best bean soup I have ever made!My husband agrees:) We do love our dried beans- I think this is so much better than using ham- saw the smoked turkey legs and wings at the store and bought them for either greens or beans. This recipe is awesome!! Thanks for posting!!

This was a very hearty soup!  I used turkey sausage and added in some sliced little red potatoes along with the beans.  I also added in some spinach and a splash of heavy cream!  It was rich and delicious!

I made it tonight but didn't cook for 4 hours because  I used 4 cans of white beans and added chicken broth instead of water. Cooked the turkey legs for 1 hour and then shredded them. Cooked the other veggies for 1 hour. Otherwise, followed the recipe almost exactly. Used only 1 T of Italian seasoning which to my mind (and my husband's) was enough. Next time, I'll add more turkey (only had 1 1/2 lbs to start with) and also will try a little tomato paste.

This is a great soup. I used a package of mixed beans, some garlic powder, and tarragon (with soup, I don't do a lot of exact measuring) in addition to the ingredients in the recipe. Will definitely make this again.

What is the typical volume of broth?  "Covering" in my case was 12 cups but I included the whole carcass not just the legs.  This will impact the proportion of ingredients.

This is a wonderful heart-warming soup for a cold winter’s day! I added a tablespoon of “Better Than Bouillon” chicken base, a big tablespoon of minced garlic, and a bunch of kale for added greenness. My family loved it!

We cooked a turkey in our smoker.  This was a perfect recipe for the broth we made from it and the leftover turkey.  We like a little spice so we added crushed red pepper like others suggested.  Served it with a salad and crusty bread.

This took a great deal of time, from the soaking of the beans to the cooking of the beans. It did turn out great and is worth the wait, if you’re willing to do it. I added some chopped jalapeño garnish on top of it at the end, to serve.

I soaked the small white beans all night then simmered them for eight hours and they were still a little firmer than I would have liked.  I used the bones from yesterday's home smoked turkey and a light hand with the herbs and it was really good!

After reading the reviews I agreed that some changes sounded like it could make the recipe better.  I used 6 cups of chicken broth rather than the water.  I used only 1 drumstick as it was plenty meaty.  I used some garlic powder, thyme and red pepper flakes - I didn't measure them, I just sprinkled them in.  And lastly, I noticed that the picture that is posted looks as though the broth is milky so I used a small carton of whipping cream at the end after everything was cooked.  The soup was excellent and when my husband likes something, you know  you've hit the jackpot!
