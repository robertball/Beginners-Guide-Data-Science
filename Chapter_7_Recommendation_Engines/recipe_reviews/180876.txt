I have noticed a number of complaints that this recipe is too salty.  Please note that the recipe calls for LOW SODIUM CHICKEN BROTH.  As long as you follow the recipe and do not add salt before tasting, you should not have any problems with salt content.

My husband and I made this recipe the other night, and it turned out delicious!  It tastes almost like a loaded baked potato.  I recommend putting this in bread bowls as a fancy twist.  The only thing I would recommend to change is maybe decreasing the amount of sour cream just a little because it has a bit of a bite to it.  Otherwise, we'll definitely make it again.

This was my first attempt at Potato Soup...my husband and I loved it.  I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and cut the sour cream in half because hubby doesn't care for it but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  We will be making this again on cold winter nights.  Thank you.

This was sooooooooo  good!  I used milk instead of  half & half in an effort to save some calories.  I also sauteed some garlic with the onion and celery.  Was really delicious!

I adapted this so I could make it in my crockpot. I cut up the potatoes and threw them in the crockpot with the chicken broth, a bunch of pepper and a can of evaporated milk. I cooked them on HIGH until an hour before dinner. I mashed them slightly with my potato masher. I did use a whole package of hickory smoked bacon, cooking to crisp. When the bacon was done and out of the hot pan, I fried the veggies in the bacon grease. I didn't have celery but I did have one red pepper and one yellow that I added to onion with a little garlic. After I stirred in the bacon, veggies and cheese, I let it warm through on LOW, then turned off the crockpot so I could stir in the sour cream. Great tasting soup, I was quite surprized though it was a little salty. Great with homemade bread on a rainy night. NOTE: I did not need any flour in my soup at all.

great recipe.  I kinda overcooked my potatoes waiting for my hubby to come home, but I know now.   Very tasty.  I wouldn't mind adding a bit more stalks of celery to it.  
Thanks.

This was a great soup. The only thing I didn't have that the recipe called for were the green onions and the dry ranch seasoning that I had was the fiesta kind, and I only had half a packet. This turned out great. I didn't use the flour or the celery ( don't care for it).

This was really good.  The only thing I would change is adding more bacon but that is just personal preference.  Definitely a keeper.

A great winter soup!  Love this recipe and so does every one else who has tasted it.  Have made it quite a few times now and it's definately deserving of the 5 stars!  The seasoning package really makes this soup, don't skip or substitute for it.. this soup tastes even better re-heated.

Delicious! Do not be freaked out by the Ranch dressing mix. It does not end up tasting like Ranch soup. The dressing mix enhances the flavor of the potatoes & broth. Have made this 3 times now!

This is a delicious potato soup that is great for a cold winter's day. As a time saver I actually used the Ore Ida Steam and Mash potatoes, they are pre-cooked and you can still mash some and leave some chunky - it was a great addition and this is one of my families favorite soups.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would! This is by far the thickest potato soup I've ever made; tastes JUST like what you'd order at these fancy restaurants and pay $5 per bowl!!! The secret is likely in the flour/ranch dressing packet. I have a similar recipe which uses dry country gravy mix, and it thickens the soup just like this ranch dressing, except without the wonderful spice. Per other reviewers, I cut the sour cream in half, and while I could taste it, it wasn't overwhelming, so I concur this is what you need to do to keep the sour cream flavor "light". Again, this recipe is a KEEPER!!!

Yummy!  I tossed the bacon and about half the cheese in the soup.  Used the remaining cheese and green onions to top.

Excellent flavor and ease to prepare.  I used some of the homemade turkey stock I had made, and cubed cream cheese/ 1 c milk in place of the half and half as I needed to use it up, and lower fat content. I also added 2 carrots chopped to the veggies.  We really enjoyed this soup!

This tasted really good. Im not sure if I really like the zing of the ranch and sour cream but it was liked by all in my house and some had seconds. This was cheap and fairly easy other than peeling all of the potatoes. Most of all it was very FILLING!

Tastes great!  I accidentally burned my bacon though, so the soup ended up being a gross brownish color.  Also, I had to add some mashed potato flakes to thicken it up.  Pretty tasty, though!

This was VERY good! I didn't add the celery because my family doesn't like it and I used onion powder in place of chopped onion. I added some bacon seasoning that I had as well. My kids even liked this! Awesome!

So very good!  I actually won a soup cook off at my church with this one!    I added some kosher salt to the potatoes before adding low sodium broth.  I also added a bit of minced garlic to the onions and celery...I added extra celery too.

This soup recipe is amazing!!  I omitted the celery.  I used homemade chicken broth that I made from a leftover whole chicken (the bones).  I didn't have half and half so I used 1 cup whole milk and 1 cup of water and used a little extra flour.  This is by far the best potato soup I have ever had, and I get potato soup at every restaurant I go to.  I love the sour cream and ranch mixture.  It really made the soup.  LOVE IT and so excited to find a simple recipe like this.

This is an AWESOME recipe!!  My whole family loved it and then I took the leftovers to work to share and they loved it too!  I can't imagine it's very healthy so next time I may try fat free sour cream and fat free half and half just to cut some calories.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and it was GREAT!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Our family enjoyed it, but I wouldn't make it again without figuring how to add alot more flavor. We added grated chedder cheese over top, which helped a bit.

Well..... I probably should have removed some of the bacon dripping. It’s very good. But I taste bacon grease. I added the 2 cups sharp cheddar to the soup. And added another package of ranch as one Gave no flavor. However my Husband says it is the best potato soup he has EVER HAD.   On his 2 Nd bowl now. I was born and raised in the south. Potato soup is a southern staple.  I will make this again. Just take some of the drippings out. I also added 1/2 stick unsalted butter.

Quite a bit of work but worth it. It's not hard to make, I'm just not a fan a peeling potatoes even though I do love them!
This's  good soup with lots of leftovers. Filling and hearty.

Definitely a family favorite.  The ONLY change, more bacon.  And as other reviewers have said make sure to use LOW SODIUM chicken broth.

Low sodium broth is a must for it to not be salty. I accidentally used about 3/4cup of sour cream because I forgot to buy more, however it was still great! I also omitted the celery as my husband is not a fan of it.

I only made this because I had a packet of ranch in my pantry left over from the super bowl game that I didn't know what to do with.  I added carrot and a bit of garlic. Also I drained the bacon grease and added a tad of butter to saute. Could have used olive oil. It was ok, but for a comfort food I like the classic nostalgic flavor of what I remember growing up. I didn't grow up on ranch so that flavor, while subtle, didn't do it for me, and masked the flavors of the veggies IMO. To each there own.

Oh, and I did use just a tad of sour cream like many other reviews suggested.

Just finished making this. I added a little more celery, just because I like "chunky" and filling soup, I also added cheese into the soup. Can't help being a dairy person. Dash of S&P and it perfect!

I can not say it was the greatest soup, it came out to be passable.
Since "Mom" the speciaist and my sister gave the thumbs up.
The cooking terminology such as crumple, dice, and others kind of confusing, in this website cooking definitions are absent for first time chefs.
But the soup for the first time it was rated as "liked"

We had leftover potatoes and bacon so I tried this recipe and it was fantastic!  I used milk instead of half and half and it was still nice and creamy, just what I was looking for.

Souper soup!  I made this for our facility 3rd annual wine & beer fest, served 245 people and have heard nothing but good!  I made it just as the recipe was published and I wouldn't change a thing on it.  We served two other kinds of soup also and this was the biggest  hit.  I will continue to make this over and over again. Thanks! Pam

I fixed this for my family, and although we didn't love this, we didn't hate it either.  Really, it reminded us of a restaurant-style soup that none of us were really fond of. Tasty, but not wonderful.

Very good recipe, but I cheated and used canned potatoes. Cut the cooking time down and made for easy mashing.  Will make again!

Very good recipe. My husband said this one is a keeper.  We've been trying new recipes for soup every Sunday. I'm sure we will be making this one again.
