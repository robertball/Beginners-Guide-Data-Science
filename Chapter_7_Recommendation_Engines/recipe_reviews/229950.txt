If Popa were Italian his Simple White Chili would make him Pope.  YUM.  I made this recipe because the name had simple in it, there is no added salt, no cheese, it called for low-sodium seasoning and  the recipe submitter is not known to scrimp on flavour.  My problem is I don't have access to canned green sauce or canned green chiles; so I improvised.  I thought that not using the canned ingredients would have taken away flavour, not so.  I made my own green sauce and roasted my own green chiles then added the liquid from a jar of jalepenos.  Man, is this a good chili. Easy comes to mind as well as simple but tastes like one of those dishes that someone slaved over a hot stove for hours.  I refuse to tell my family that it only took an hour.  The house filled with an aroma that sent all the family in the kitchen for a taste.  Simple, delicious, easy, low sodium, rich flavour and filling.  What more could you want?  Thanks bd.weld for your great recipe.

Hello my brother, Brian! I made your white chili the day before our latest snow fall. My line chef son, Stephen, and his girl friend came down from Big Bear for lunch with us and to collect his birthday cookies and fudge, that Mom has to make for his birthday each year. It didn't start to blizzard until after they left. By then, HWY 330 and 18 were a mess! Well, they made it home in 4 hours, but with their bellies full of your most excellent chili! I poached a large chicken breast, making a stock with with Better Than Bouillon, and then shredded the meat. I halved the recipe and still had a little left to send home with them. I served with salad toppings - shredded cabbage, sliced radishes, cilantro, sliced scallions, cheddar and pepper jack cheese, and baked tortilla strips. This was such a treat on a miserably snowy, cold day! Thank you, my friend, for a such a winning recipe!

I grew up on white beans and still prefer them over red and black to this day. I am also a big fan of green chilies so I knew with a quick glance of the ingredients that this was going to be a darn good chili. It seems a lot of people translate green chilies and green enchilada sauce into "too hot" but that really isn't the case in this recipe. Made as written this recipe was super simple, packed full of flavor, fuss free, and perfect for days you don't have much time to spend in the kitchen. Bonus is that it is friendly enough for the entire family yet more heat can easily be added to the individual bowl of anyone desiring more spiciness. Thanks for the great recipe bd.weld!

I didn't have any mexican oregano but it was still great! My husband who thinks he makes the best chili in the world gave it 2 thumbs up and a couple of picky kids gobbled it up too. I served this with cornbread muffin vs. the garlic bread and it was really good.

The whole family loved this chili! I used chicken breasts, shredded, instead of ground turkey. I reduced the garlic to one teaspoon and increased the cumin to one teaspoon. I measured the chopped onion at 1/2 cup. The canned green enchilada sauce made this easy and so much better than any other white chili recipe I've tried. I served it with shredded monterey jack cheese to top it with and white cornbread.

This was a little bland... adding Tabasco, salt and red chili flakes really helped. Next time I'll add finely chopped jalapenos with the onions.

We will absolutely make this again! It was delicious and best of all, super easy!
I am not overly fond of ground turkey so I instead cooked up some chicken thighs and shredded them to throw in. I also forgot to add the canning liquid from the chili peppers, which I will do next time. 
We loved this recipe and it's getting added to the regular rotation!

I made this as listed but adjusted various spices for our tastes. Four stars because 3 cups of water were about 1 1/2 cups too much, unless you prefer your chili like soup. It’s too liquidity for our tastes, but I fixed it with hot chili liquid and flour. Quite tasty. I’d definitely make it again.

this is a great quick chili base without tomatoes. I made a couple of changes if I did not change the base ingredients. sauteed onion celery and carrot and use low sodium chicken broth. I also use leftover rotisserie chicken. used all the remaining listed ingredients. thanks for sharing this quick tasty chili.

Other than adding a little red pepper flakes for a little extra bite I made no changes. this is wonderful. There is  no way it makes 10 servings.  At least not the way I gobble it down

Outstanding.  Loved it.  Had to substitute leftover turkey for the gr. turkey and 2 cans pinto beans because we only had one can white beans.
Will definitely make again.

This was so good!!!  I made it in the instant pot and then turned it to slow cook mode until we we ready to chow.    The flavors were fantastic!   The only change I made was to use a tsp of cumin and added a tsp of rouge pimento.

Four stars for flavor, five for ease. Very nice. Just for fun, I added some pasilla pepper and diced tomato, as well as a little chipotle chile powder.  I liked the changes but think it would have been great without them too.  Using a premade enchilada sauce was brilliant to get a tasty and somewhat unusual base with no work!
