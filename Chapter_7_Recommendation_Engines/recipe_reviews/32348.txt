If you don't follow the recipe...then you are really rating a diferent recipe.  How is that helpfulto those interested in the rating for this one???  I followed the recipe and it actually turned out the way I think it was supposed to.  It was good if you like the spice.

I made this using regular milk instead of sweetened condensed and was conservative with the spices. It was extremely spicy and since the spices don't melt, VERY gritty. It was also bitter but perhaps that was because I didn't have the right milk on hand. My boyfriend and I took a few sips and had to dispose of the rest. If you make this, I'd suggest trying whole pieces of the spices so you can take them out after steeping in water or trying to strain them out. I, however, won't be adding this to my recipe box at home.

I just tried this tonight, and I thought it was just okay. I made it exactly as written, and it was fairly gritty, as other reviewers have already mentioned. I might make it again, and stir it a lot more, just to see if it improves any. It was, as advertised, pretty spicy, but since I'm not a big fan of nutmeg, it didn't wow me for that reason.

While I agree with Tanya's sentiments, I only had heavy cream, no condensed milk...my problem wasn't with the taste (delicious), however; it was the grainy-ness.  Even after I strained the drink through a fine strainer, it still had a grainey texture.  I think whomever suggested whole spices might be right.

I probably shouldn't be rating this, just because I used regular whole milk chocolate milk and added the spices, but based on flavor, this was really good. The only thing I didn't like was that it was super grainy because of the cinnamon and nutmeg floating all around. Not good.

I appreciate the concept of this recipe, but with only a tiny bit of milk compared to the rest of the ingredients, it's really a dressed up hot chocolate.  We tried it hot, and didn't like the grainy texture.  I couldn't imagine how it would be cold. It was spicy, but the amount of spices (2 1/2 tsp of dry spices per serving) overpowered the hot chocolate mix and left a sludge in the bottom of the mug.  I'm sorry, but we wouldn't make this again.

I didn't add the sweetened condensed milk (we were out). Way too much nutmeg. I  I added at least a cup of actual chocolate milk and it was drinkable, but still super bitter.
