This recipe is INCREDIBLE!!! I don't know what they're supposed to taste like, but I don't care. These are SO tasty, and so budget-friendly. This is my husbands new favorite dinner - he loves how hearty they are and he loves bringing them to work for lunch since they're just as good re-heated. Here's a few tips to help it turn out just right. I made it just the same as the recipe, but the dough ended up needing eight tablespoons of sour cream instead of six - otherwise it was too crumbly and even if I got it rolled nicely, it would crack when I folded it over. Also, when you've sauted your filling ingredients, taste test them to be sure you've got enough spices. My spices were a bit old so I needed a bit more of each. Also, when stuffing your pies, I found that it works better to put a little less in each (I froze my extra filling for super-quick pies next time!) and that way they don't bubble out of their crusts during baking. Also it helps not to mound up the filling too much but to press it flat to keep the crust from cracking when you fold it over. I sealed mine well by using a fork to press around the edges. Maybe this all seems obvious to some of you, but for those new to meat pies, I hope it helps the process go more smoothly. The good news is, they all tasted great, misshapen or not! :)

My swedish family has a recipe for these and we don't use nutmeg or allspice, we do use onion, dill, a little garlic, fresh pepper, cheese and mix some sour cream into the meat mixture to make it creamier, to save time we shred canned potatoes and have used refrigerate pie crusts from a box once or twice when extra family suddenly showed up for dinner.

This recipe was great!  I wasn't sure how the crust would turn out based on the ingredients, but it ended up being delicious!  The only thing different I did was use regular potatos instead of red ones (didn't have any). I ended up with a extra potato in my filling, but it still tasted great.

Making four pies made each one end up a little larger than a Hot Pocket.  Next time I might make eight instead and have them be a little smaller.

Thank you very much for this recipe!

A great filling, portable meal. I used butter for crust instead of shortening and found the dough hard to work with. But it was worth the effort. 
I improvised a bit with my own favourite spices.
Next time, I will use boiled potatoes for smoother texture and some pieces of bacon for extra flavour.

Oops the recipe forgets to tell you to salt and pepper the filling to taste before stuffing the crusts. I live in Junction City and go to the Scandinavian Festival every year. People wait hours for the meat pies. They aren't the same but they are very good.

The recipe was good, but I ended up with a lot more filling than I had dough for. Next time I will double the dough amount and chill it before working with it.

ADD SALT AND PEPPER!  Its obviously forgotten!  
But otherwise, so far so good,.  But I am lazy, so I added sour cream, plus a little extra flour, salt, shortening and water to my usual pie crust that I had in the freezer.  VOILA!!!  Seriously, this dough was the easiest I have ever worked with...so I would say that people having problems with cracking and such...just add sour cream to your usual pie crust recipe in place of some of the liquid.  Worked amazingly well and I have been rollin' out crust for years!   The filling could use some tweaking yet...i will do these again though until they are right!

These were huge! Hubby and I split one. We both agreed they were rather bland and in need of salt and more spices. The crust was very tender and flaky, and turned out the best pie crust I have ever made. I didn't shred potatoes just used some canned that I cut into small chunks. We both ate ours and thought this was okay but it did not make our favorites. This actually tasted better the next day after reheating. Thanks.

This recipe went over well with my husband (who is part swedish).  It sounded as if it could be a little dry, so I added a little extra chopped onion and shredded cheese.  The crust also turned out nice and flaky.  The only change I would make to the original recipe would be to add chopped fresh mushrooms.

Ok, so I'm torn as how to rate this recipe....The meat filling tasted great as we were preparing it....the dough on the other hand was very difficult to work with, it kept cracking.  And then when you put them together, the end result is kinda blah tasting.  Oh, the dough was also kinda on the salty side.  Will try this one again because I really like the portability of this meal.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a good starting point and very workable (I think).

I changed the recipe just a little to fit my family. I used venison instead of beef and more cheese.    I took out the spices that my family would not  have liked and put in ones they would.  I also added philadelphia cream cheese to the recipe for the pie crust.  It makes it more smooth and moist.  Less sour cream, replaced with philly crm.  It was a very good recipe to model mine.    I do go to Junction City to get these pies on purpose, now occasionally I can make it myself now.

A good recipe! I would give it somewhere between 4 an five stars though. The meat was too bland, and diretcions were not as clear as they could be.

Someone made something like this for me after I had my baby, but it had chunks of potatoes in it. I like it both ways. Next time I'm going to try putting carrots and peas in it. I think you could do just about anything. really good.

I have to agree what some others have said about the meat being somewhat bland, but I did leave out the allspice, dill weed, and nutmeg. I added garlic salt and dried basil.  Instead of the dough, I simply used a box of Jiffy pie crust using 4 T. of water and 2 T. sour cream.  I should have used 2 boxes.

The reviews were so good on this that I decided to make it for my card group.   I'm thinking you'd have to be Swedish to appreciate the unusual taste of this dish.  Won't be giving this another try.

I have never tried swedish meat pies before and decided to try this as i had all the ingrediants .I found it worked out well ,i liked the crust and think this crust would be quick and easy to make for other fillings as well . I bioled the potatoes part way with beef broth /water to give them more flavour before shredding them and tried the meat mix with the amount of spices then added more of the same spices as i felt it need more .all in all it was good and i would make it again .I am wondering if it would freaze well ? .

Yum! I was hesitant to try it after a horrible recipe for something similar, but this turned out great! I used a pre-made rolls of pie crust so it was very quick, and I did not have two of the spices so I used ground cardamom, paprika, and allspice along with a bit of pepper. I nixed the butter (there is plenty in the pie crust) and only added a cup of sharp cheddar. Will make the crust next time, and the next time will be soon because I am already thinking about what I am going to try in it - this is a versatile recipe :)

Delicious pies! I found my crust to be a little on the dry side (much like a pot pie crust) but a brush of olive oil helped. I also used mozarella cheese (had no cheddar) and they turned out amazing. Thank you!

These were just OK.  I ended up with far too much filling for the amount of dough.  The filling was rather bland, and if I make this again I would double the spices.

This is a great recipe.  The filling did need some salt.  It was my first time trying a meat pie, and it took longer  than the estimate because it has been a while since I have made dough.  Next time I think I will make the pies smaller perhaps dividing the dough into six pieces.  I used Russet potatoes and margarine because that was what I had on hand.  I will make this again!  Thanks for posting it.

This is the second time that I have made these.  My family LOVE them.  I am from Junction City, Oregon, I work at the Scandinavian festival and I buy more than one of these every year.  I do add fresh garlic, garlic salt and pepper. I did end up doubling the pastry and I bought this really cool mini pie press from Target to use.  They look great and they are amazing.

I have been using this recipe to feed my three kids for almost 15 years, and it is still a favorite. I am Swede and Finn and English by genetics, but being adopted into SE Minnesota as a baby, I was raised with Norwegian and German food. I dare say that these will appeal to all palates. Nice change from the usual ground beef and tater recipes. The spices seen strange at first, but really, give it a try.

I rated it a five star as-is way back when I first made them, but as my skills and our taste buds matured, I did make a few changes to suit. I add garlic, and I change up the other spices as per what is on hand, but keep it in the family. Always use the dill. I seem to be out of nutmeg... oh well. So, tonight I'm using ginger and a touch of Chinese five-spice, along with a dash of paprika. Oh, and salt and pepper. I'm also using fresh venison this time, which should be grand. I do follow one suggestion and add a bit of the sour cream (tater topper, in this case) and cooked, crumbled bacon to the meat mixture to add some flavor and creaminess. (I bet a dollop of cream cheese would be a great addition, too.) Try smoked cheddar, too! :) Tonight, I think I'll hold back just a bit on the dill and add some chopped pickle slices instead. 

But again, it's a five star recipe to begin with. Great comfort food, especially in the harsh Minnesota winters. Just change it up however you see fit. It's incredibly adaptable. My middle daughter requested them for her 21st birthday tonight. The

I sauted diced potatoes  instead of shredded with the meat and seasonings  and I used a ready made pie dough. The result was very good.

I’ve always wanted this recipe as being a big fan of these pies
They are amazing
I used a little more sour cream to make easier to work with on pastry part
It’s amazingly like the ones at the Scandinavian Festival in Junction City Oregon 
Delicious !

The filling was absolutely amazing. I followed other reviews that said to taste and be sure there was enough seasoning, so I added probably about 1/4 tsp more allspice to mine as well as a sprinkle of some onion powder and a teaspoon of salt and two cloves of minced garlic. Also, there was not enough dough. I used probably 1/2-2/3 of the filling with the dough I made so that way I could close the pies all the way, but the filling was so yummy I would eat it without the pie. The dough was amazingly flakey and yummy- I will add more salt to the dough next time because they needed to be salted on the outside when they were done cooking. Overall, the filling was amazing and I will definitely be making them again.

This dough is perfect for any filling you want to add.  The recipe is great as is and we also like to do other fillings like ground chicken, onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, Parmesan.  Or pepperoni, cheese, marinara sauce.

Very good recipe.  We added some frozen peas and carrots, I think it's better with a little more veg, and about 1/4 of the cheese.  I made half as directed then added curry powder to the second half.  Both were delicious.

I grew up on these. My dad's father's family was from Sweden and had these perfected. For this many ingredients, it needs a lot more than a tsp. of salt and some black pepper. I never had tried it with the allspice, dill and nutmeg before, but it was so good. Thanks for sharing!

The crust is awesome!  The key is sour cream I'm thinking. All the flavors in the meat and crust were very good. I definitely will be making this again!  I think maybe adding a little beef broth to the meat mixture would give a more saucy affect as well.

This is fantastic, I did a few things a little different I used about 10 tablespoons of sour cream for the dough and about 1/2 cup milk. I only had 1/4 shortening so I substituted the rest with butter. I also added three tablespoons sour cream to the meat mixture. I added garlic and extra parsley. I love learning new swedish recipe, I wish my family held on to tradition a little more. I wish defiantly be making this again.

The wife loved these. I thought they were a touch on the bland side. Granted, I haven't had Swedish food yet that wasn't beige and salty, so maybe I'm not the best judge. I will say that the dough was wonderful and I plan on using it for other recipes.
