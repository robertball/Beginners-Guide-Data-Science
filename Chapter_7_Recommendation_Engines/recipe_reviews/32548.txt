I want to change this whole recipie, but it is a good start.  I think I would prefer it with sugar instead of honey.  Honey isn't bad though. I also used nonfat milk, that's all I drink, except for in my coffee or hot tea.  I should have figured it out, but whole milk would be so much better or a little 1/2 and 1/2 with the nonfat milk.  Next time I will keep it in the refrigerator and heat up a glass when I want hot tea.  I think this recipie would be better as a hot tea than a cold tea.  But still a good cold tea.  Hope that made some since.

I used my favorite Earl Grey tea to make this.  It's super good, and really does taste great on a hot day!

This was surprisingly good and really refreshing! I cut the recipe in half just to give it a try and was glad I did. Not something I'd make often, but overall a nice change of pace.

I cut the honey by half. For me, that was just right. This is lovely. I think this would be just as good with any tea you'd want to use. Next time, I'll try this with chai tea bags. VERY refreshing. I liked this because I could make it early in the morning and have it set all day in the fridge and it would be ready for me when I got home after work and wanted something sweet but didn't want something high in calories.

I scaled this down to two servings since Hubs is not a tea drinker and this was just for me.  I used just a basic Orange Pekoe tea and only half the honey called for and it was plenty sweet enough for me.  I drank half of it while it was still hot and I really enjoyed it. In fact, I prefered it to the remaining tea I had later after it had chilled!

I thought this was very good. All I had on hand was flavored green tea bags, so I used that and 1 cup of 2% milk (bc that's what I drink) and a little more than 1/2 cup half and half (to make up for the lost fat and creaminess of the 2%). I only occasionally drink coffee in the mornings, but still want a little kick of caffeine. This is very light and will be a perfect iced drink, that's already made, to get me going. Especially living in a humid climate. Thanks!!!!!
