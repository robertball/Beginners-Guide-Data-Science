The chicken itself gets a four star rating, however, the stuffing only gets TWO **. I had to add a lot more herbs and seasonings, including some chopped onion and celery in order to make the stuffing more flavorful. I also didn't love using the whole wheat bread. If making from scratch, I prefer challah bread, if not, the bread cubes from the package work just fine and make a great stuffing.

This recipe was excellent!  I had a get together with my family and made this for dinner along with the roasted chicken and it was a big hit!  No left overs, which was a disappointment for both my husband and I the next day.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to add a half an onion to the recipe and 2 cloves of garlic, also I used white bread instead of whole wheat.  I would most definitely make this again.

Very easy recipe resulting in tender, flavorful chicken. My family requests this every other week! Try using the carcass for broth, it's got great flavor.  Excellent recipe, thanks!

Didn't really like this. Both the stuffing and the chicken ended up being rather bland. The skin was nice and crispy though.
