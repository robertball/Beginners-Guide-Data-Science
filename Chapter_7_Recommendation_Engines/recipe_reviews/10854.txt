I am so happy to find this recipe.  I made these so many times as a child.  The recipe was in a child's cookbook (Betty Crocker's ?) I have tried to duplicate them over the years and now I know why they were never the same, I wasn't using enough butter or sugar. They taste just like they did when I was younger. My brother and I used to eat the whole batch, which probably  explains why I am overweight now.  Thanks so much. Donna Scudder

We've been making these for many years! We got the recipe originally from my mother's Mary Alden's Cookbook for Children (1955). The Eskimo Cookies page is dog-eared from frequent use over three generations. Easy, delicious, fun for kids... we can never wait for them to get cold in the fridge before digging in. My son made them for a school event recently. The kids thought they looked a little strange, but once they tasted them they flew off the plate. Thanks for posting the recipe to share.

This recipe is awesome! I mad eht emistake of bringing them in to my French class and now I'm asked about every week to bring more in!  Everybody loves them, though they are a bit leery of the appearence of the cookie.  As soon as you can convince them to take a bite, you con't stop them from eating more!  I don't reccomend changing anyhting about this recipe, except possibly scaling it to make more!

I also had a small, red, paperback cookbook for children in the mid-1950s that contained this recipe.  I've been looking for it for 20 years!

Tastes like cooky dough or some type of fudge.  Belongs in the "kids" section.  Will not make again.

This is a recipe from the 50's from a kid's cookbook, so yes, the reviews saying this sounds like a kid's recipe are right, it is. Hey, it's a no bake cookie, almost all of which are kid's recipes. You can keep the butter slightly lighter, but not by much, or these will crumble. Also, I'm sorry, you can't substitute margarine in this. Functionally it works, but it just won't taste right.

Really good, but really messy! It takes just a few minutes to make them, but even less to eat them. My husband thinks they taste like a granola bar, but better. I used Splenda instead of sugar, and I used Old Fashioned Oats (I read on the back that they were rolled oats - in case you are wondering). Turned out great! I will make these again! Thanks!

I will eat almost anything but these just weren't very good.  I had to keep them in the fridge for 24 hours just so they had some shape to them and weren't balls of mush.  I won't make these again.  I'd much rather just make no bake cookies.

I wanted to love these, but they really didn't do a lot for me.  They are very messy to eat and make, which I don't mind if they taste really great.  Tasted too much like just creamed butter and sugar to me.  The kids at my son's babysitter's loved them though!  And my two year old loved helping me make them (part of the reason they were so messy :)

These were surprisingly good and delicious. I have my doubts about using raw oats, but it turned out very good. Very interesting recipe and very easy to make.

This was even easier than a cooked type no bake. It was very good in chocolate flavor. The sugar in this does not dissolve giving the cookie a little crispy texture from the sugar crystals and that with the cold temperature from the fridge made the the cookie name seem very appropriate. I used a small cookie scoop and only got 26 from this so had I known that I would have doubled this recipe. Super duper easy and fast. I had the whole thing done from start to finished and in the refrigerator in less than 15 minutes. Thanks Cindy for the fast easy and tasty little recipe, these will be perfect on my cookie trays.

Used this recipe with a group of little girls at a library story time, and it was a great hit. Everyone got to take a turn mixing things, and measuring things, and they were all very excited. We rolled the cookies in sprinkles instead of icing sugar, which they seemed to really like too. I would definitely recommend this for group baking!

It tasted like chocolate frosting with oats - I might try it with 1/2 peanut butter and 1/2 butter. I won't make it as written though.

I thought these were a really tasty and easy little treat that I was able to make at the last minute with ingredients I already had!  I didnt have enough oatmeal, so I used half oatmeal half puffed rice cereal.  I really liked the crispiness the cereal added.   Will probably be making these again soon!

I"m so glad I found this!!!  My sister used to make these when she was younger,and we haven't been able to find the recipe over the years!  Still not sure if these are the exact same thing she used to make, but if not, they're pretty darn close!!!  Thanks so much for sharing a wonderful childhood recipe!

This are the best little cookies!  All parents need to make them with their children.   My mom and I made them when I was little.  We use her little red Betty Crocker cookbook for kids.

I used to make these cookies all the time as an after school treat when I was in high school. That was 45 years ago and this is the exact same recipe I used! I can't believe I found a copy of it online! They taste great and are so easy to make!

I had small people visit who were disappointed because I hadn't baked them a treat so we made these.  The kids had a blast rolling them into (almost) balls and then had to wait impatiently for them to chill.  I put them in the freezer for about 30 minutes.  They are very sweet and very messy the kids loved them.  Thanks for sharing!

This is an excellent recipe.  It took all of 5 minutes to prepare and just about the same amount of time for my family to eat all of them.

Love this recipe!  So simple, so easy.  My 4 kids beg for these!  They usually don't make it to the ball stage.

I really enjoyed these. Simple to make and yummy. Best not to eat warm though...as they can taste a little greasy, nor too cold as they are hard and with less flavour. It is all in the butter.

I loved the texture and taste. It was delicious, i only changed the size of the cookies because I didint have a small enough scoop for tiny ones. Instead I made 5 huge ones.i found it hard cause I put the butter on top so I had to mix it really well.

Yes these are pretty yummy!!! I added a pinch of salt, cinnamon and a sprinkle of flaked coconut and a teaspoon of ground flax to cut the guilt haha! Great no bake kids cookies.

My mom made these every Christmas. One batch for our family and a whole batch for my uncle. These always went fast and my uncle always looked forward to his favorite Christmas present. I've never had them anywhere else, they're so unique! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I grew up on this amazing stuff. I freeze my cookies instead of refrigerator,  of course put in a container with seal otherwise it will taste contaminated. My daughter is now learning how to make it with her daddy while I'm recuperating from surgery. Such a simple recipe. I would love to locate that old kid recipe book. Anyone know where to find it or if it's out there?

Kid and husband tested, mother approved! So easy and satisfying. Plus, there isn't any peanut butter. I needed to stretch the recipe when I noticed I was short on oats. I added some wheat bran and a 1/2 cup of crispy rice cereal. The extra crunchiness is an unexpected touch.  The purists may not agree with the additions but there was absolutely nothing wrong with the outcome. I'll be sure to try this the original way also.

Made these tonight with my four-year-old. We had a good time making them and the instant gratification of being able to roll the first one and hand it off was great. One or two satisfies my sweet craving, any more might be too much sweet for my belly. :)

My only peeve (and this pretty much goes for all cookies) is that there is no way to get 36 out of these but since I never get the actual yield I'm really not worried about it. I think we did get about 20 though so not bad. Definitely worth making.

I've been making these cookies since I was in the "Brownies" when I was a young girl. This was in the 1950's.
