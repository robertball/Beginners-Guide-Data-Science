I love this recipe! This is my favorite pasta salad...EVER. My modifications are as follows: tri-colored tortellini!, red onion, garlic and herb feta, red wine vinegar, yellow bell pepper instead of green, double the hot sauce, juice of a whole lemon, fresh oregano, fresh thyme, fresh garlic, nix the mint, nix the olives.

I brought this to a Thanksgiving dinner, and not only was it a hit with requests for the recipe, but I was also asked to bring it again to a Christmas dinner.  I did make some changes, just to suit my own tastes.  I kept the pasta amount the same, using tri-color parmesan tortellini.  I doubled the herbs & veggies (I used red onion and a mix of red, orange, green, & yellow peppers - very pretty!).  I also added some ceyenne pepper.  I used white wine vinegar, and only 1/2 the amount of both the vinegar and olive oil.  This was plenty of dressing - still a lot of flavor without being greasy.  I think this makes many more servings than the recipe states unless it is all you are eating, so even 1/2 a batch might be enough for a smaller gathering.

Great salad, colorful too.  I added more basil.
I brought this to a potluck, and it was very popular.

YUM YUM!!! This salad was very very good! 
I didn't use the feta cheese though, I added broccoli and I also doubled the tortellini by using 2 packs of green tortellini instead of white and I used dry mint, It was wonderful!!
 The dressing that this recipe calls for is abit too much for that amount of tortellini so that's why I doubled the pasta amount and it was perfect!
-----------------
Thanks for the recipe, We didn't even chill it, we ate it right away and it was GOOD I hope to use it alot as my whole family enjoyed it!

First of all I loved the recipe... but I did make some changes I didn't put in the black olives (personal preference) but Kalamata olives and some marinated artichoke hearts would be delicious next time.  I added one big can of white chicken to make it more of a lunch main dish.  I used Balsamic vinegar.  Doubled the mint, basil and parsley.  Added a few dashes of hot sauce for a bite.  I also added alot more lemon juice because I couldn't taste it (the balsamic may have drowned it out) so all in all about 6-7 tablespoons.  I also increased the feta to a cup and used non fat.  I also chopped about a 1/2 of cucumber into it and decreased the onion to a 1/4 of a sweet yellow onion.

This recipe blew us away.  My husband raved and raved over it.  I did alter it a bit.  I added grilled chicken.  I also added cucumber and omitted the green pepper.  I used green onions and replaced the parsley with cilantro.  Because the type of vinegar wasn't specified, I went with balsamic.  Also I did not chill it for at least 4 hours and instead served it as soon as I finished preparing it.  Thank you for this one!  It will be served over and over in our house.

Wonderful salad...it was perfect for dinner on a hot summer day with some crusty sour dough bread.

I used one 9 oz three cheese, and one 9 oz spinach and cheese (green) tortellini, which made it even more colorful.  The delightful taste and aroma of the fresh herbs were worth the extra trouble and expense as opposed to dried.

Next time I think I will cut back a bit on the quantities of the green pepper and onion, keeping the red bell pepper amount the same, but that's just personal taste.  I used sweet Vidalia onion, and that flavor was great...not as overpowering as white, yellow or red onion might have been.

This was delicious and I plan to make it for the next pot luck or BBQ we attend this summer.  I better take along copies of the recipe cause I know I'll be asked.  Thanks, Paul!

Very nice savoury taste.  I use fresh, tri-color tortellini and omit the mint leaves and feta.  This salad is so good that whenever I make it I can't help but eat a few forkfuls before it even has a chance to "set" while being chilled.

I made this for a bridal shower and everyone loved it.  I left out the peppers and hot sauce and used Kalamata olives and balsamic vinegar.  It was delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

I've made this multiple times and loved it!  I stop at the salad bar to get the veggies at the store and have thrown in broccoli, peas, peppers, and olives.  Saves a lot of work!

Tasty and looks great. I found my container of feta to be moldy so at the last second I had to improvise. I upped the grated parmesan a lot and then threw in some fresh shredded parmesan. This cut some down on some of the "lemoneyness." Definiately serve cold. I made this last night and all of the dressing was gone this morning so don't be alarmed by the extra amount of dressing in the bottom of the bowl when you make this, it will get absorbed. I think I preferred it last night however before everything was absorbed.

This is a hit at every potluck I take it to.  I've lost count how many times I've made this. Follow the recipe exactly and it will turn out perfect.
Be sure and use fresh tortellini pasta, the dried tortellini pasta is never any good.

Mighty tasty and quite versatile.  For the veggies I used green onions, carrots, broccoli, chick peas, and used from garden...mint, oregano, basil and parsley.  The dressing needs some tweeking for my taste and I will work on that in the future.  seems like too much EVOO, did use red wine vinegar and only half a lemon and the zest from the whole lemon.  Also added some stevia for sweetener but could use sugar or honey or agave nectar.  It is a keeper with some personal touches.  Just put out the feta and the fresh grated parmesano regiano for personal topping.

The ingredients in this salad did compliment each other but the dressing was just not that great to me – vinegar is basically what I tasted.  Thanks for sharing though; I will make it again but with my own dressing!

Very good. Well worth it to purchase a high quality fresh or fresh-frozen tortellini, to avoid that heavy & doughey quality that sometimes makes tortellini salads objectionable.

Got really great reviews from this pasta salad at a party.  You can definitely change this salad with different stuffed pastas, which I tried and people also enjoyed.

This recipe is really wonderful, and different from most salads I've made.  My husband loved it too.  The dressing mixture seemed to be too much for the salad, next time I'm going to halve the dressing recipe.

On July 4th morning I searched this site for recipes to take to a potluck when I came upon this one... it was fabulous, and everyone wanted the recipe!   I omitted the Feta, however-- and it was beautiful. colorful and delicious without it!   Excellent!

Awesome tortellini salad!  I was looking for a new pasta salad idea for a picnic, and tried this one.  I used balsamic vinegar in mine as well, and added broccoli and fresh garlic in place of powder.  I thought the dressing was a bit tart, so I added a teaspoon of sugar, and it really enhanced the flavor.  This is now on the top of my favorite pasta salad list!

Good salad, but not superb. I did like it though. I doubled the olives and used katamala. I also halfed the amount of olive oil/vinegar and used red wine vinegar. I also added pine nuts to the salad, which were very good. It was a crowd pleaser for sure! Mmmmm

I really did not like the vinegar taste with the feta and cheese tortellini in this dish - it just didn't mix well tastewise, and I usually love almost any type of pasta salad.

AWESOME!!!! Everybody loved it! I saved a lot of time and trouble by using frozen Stir Fry Peppers(Red,Yellow,and Green Peppers and Onions). Throw the frozen peppers in while you boil the tortellini. I also used dried herbs (just eyeballed it), and did not use garbanzo beans. Thanks for the recipe!

I added thinly sliced radish and sweet pea pods (sugar snap) to the salad and let sit overnight as recommended.  Brought this with us tubing and it was a GREAT hit!!!  Thanks Paul!

This salad was a hit!  It is a nice change from traditional pasta salads and it had such a fresh taste.  I used Barilla three cheese tortellini yum!

Absolutely the best pasta salad known to mankind. I've made this for years, and people always go nuts and beg for the recipe! I add pitted Calamata olives, roasted red peppers, Romano cheese and sometimes garbanzos. Fabulous, Brilliant, a show-stopper!

1/2 of this dressing is plenty to cover the salad.  I thought the dressing would be too much, but I made the full amount in case the dressing absorbed into the pasta and there was no flavor (I marinated overnight).  NO need to worry about that!  The dressing still packs a punch even after sitting with the salad ingredients for a while.  Bf liked it a lot, so I just made another batch tonight with the rest of the dressing but put in chickpeas, mushrooms, and tomato  for his dinner tomorrow.  Pretty versatile, but I'd definitely recommend halving the dressing.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great salad.  I made several changes but the best one was using red roasted peppers from a jar.  It added lots of flavor.  I also used a yellow pepper, tri-colored tortellini, sweet onion, no mint, and only 1 T of lemmon juice.  It was a hit.

By end of summer, my husband was not enthused about pasta or potato salad.  He agreed this one sounded different for our planned picnic. We all really liked it.  Since I left the small amount of leftovers at my son's house, I ended up making more for my husband, two days later.  The lemon juice really gives it a fresh taste, I think.  I was wondering if anyone had comments on using dry tortellinis.  I used frozen tortellinis (19 0z)and followed the recipe otherwise as written.

This is very good recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.  I made a couple of modifications.  I did not add the mint nor the hot pepper sauce and used white balsamic vinegar.  I also used a red onion, which I think is great in salads.

this salad is so delish! i made it on fourth of july pretty much following the directions fully. it was such a hit, that i got asked to make it months later for another party. I used red wine vinegar, sweet onions, and kalamata onions. i added grated carrots. and next time i think i might use roasted red peppers instead of the red pepper and increase the green one for crunch. i love all the fresh flavours that the herbs give it. fresh are the best.

This recipe is kickin'. It has become a family favorite - and I have a pretty picky family! I've made this many times, and my main tip is to add a little more olive oil (half vinegar half OO is too acidic in my opinion). Aside from this, I usually add a dash of sugar, more hot sauce and double the herbs. 

This is a crowd pleaser for sure! Fun too, as you can really go wild with what you throw in, as others have mentioned.

We didn't care for this salad.  I think it was that the dressing was just to tart.  I will make a version of this again, just not with the dressing it calls for. I used red wine vinegar against my better judgement, but I'm not so sure a different vinegar would have saved the dressing part of this recipe.

A keeper! I prepared this a day in advance so the flavors were really intense and wonderful.  The other night I had served Seared Ancho Pepper Chicken (from this site) and since I some leftover I added the slices to this salad.  A great combination if I do say so myself!!  Will be making both of these again and again. Both of these can be prepared way in advance of company.  Thanks so much submitters.

Prepared recipe exactly as written except for adding a little sugar to 'balance' out the vinegar. Brought it to a dinner of 11 people - got nothing but praise including their asking for the recipe. Even the kids liked it. VERY good pasta salad!

Yummy! I used yellow pepper instead of red, put red onion (half of a big one was almost too much), omitted olives and the mint, put oregano and more basil. I added tomatoes, matchstick carrots, and mushrooms. Perfect!

I DID like this salad. It's very different from most salads. I did't have the dried herbs, parm. cheese or 
feta so left them out but added shredded mozzarella. I will make this again.

This was delicious!!! I used the fresh tortellini as one of the reviews suggested - good suggestion. The only thing I'm going to do differently, next time, is to use less onion...personal preference. I love the dressing! I'll definately make this again.

I made this salad for an "Herb Group Gathering", since it had so many fresh herbs in it.  It went over wonderful!!  There were no leftovers!!  And I even forgot to put the cheese on it!!  Next time, I will try it with the cheese, but it was wonderful without it.  I took other's recommendations, and did chill it overnight before serving.  I highly recommend this recipe and will make it again and again!

this was very good, if you like pasta salads, and you REALLY need to let it set...overnight is best!
i loved the ingredients, i may add others if i choose, but i liked it just the way it was!

This is a good recipe.  I just added a little sugar to the dressing to cut the acidity and help the flavors to blend

This was a great recipe, I did follow the advice of another review and added a little sugar to cut the acidity.  However, that was only change I made. Made this for a baby shower, and, the guests loved it.  I have a request to make it for Mother's Day so I will make it the night before.  Great recipe!

This was just okay, I'm not going to make it again. We ate some of the salad immediately (as some reviewers suggested) and some leftover the next day. I do think it was better the next day, after the dressing was able to meld with the pasta and veggies.

This recipe is sooooo yummy! I thought at first the dressing would be too much, but as it cooled in the fridge the cheeses and noodles soaked alot of it up! I altered the recipe by switching the green pepper with a yellow one, using only half of an onion, fresh garlic and half of a lemon's worth juice. I also doubled the feta (yummmm)!

This was amazing it was so fun and easy to make and everyone loved it - it was gone in one day! The only thing i did different was add a lot more feta cheese, parmesan and black olives than requested and I added mozzarella cheese to it as well. It was absolutely delicious.

I have made this recipe numerous times and it's always a hit.  I usually add blanched asparagus as it's one of my favorite veggies and omit the feta chz to keep it a bit on the lighter side.

Very good!  I left out some of the things I don't like (olives) or didn't have (mint, feta), used dry seasonings (didn't have fresh parsley), and added more veggies (shredded carrot, broccoli, etc).  Served it at a family gathering, and everyone loved it...even the kids who hate all veggies!

Good, but not fantastic.  I wanted a 1 dish meal, so I added chicken breast.  When I tasted the end result I needed more flavors, so I added sundried tomatoes, capers, rosemary and more hot sauce (a dash isn't enough).  Will make again, but it didn't blow me away.

This is a wonderful salad with great flavor. I didnt put in the olives and added artichokes instead and it was fantastic! I didnt have time either to let it set for 4 hours. Only 1 1/2 and it was still great!

The best tortellini salad I have ever made! I didn't have fresh basil, so I substituted dried. I also chopped all of the veggies rather than slicing them. I used red wine vinegar... it was delicious!

Very tasty and easy!  I went heavier on the three fresh herbs for more flavor, used sliced green olives in lieu of black olives (didn't have any and thought the green would give more "zip"), and probably more crumbled feta cheese - delicious!

My husband and I loved this salad!  We used fat free sun dried tomato Italian dressing instead of the oil, vinegar and lemon juice, and all of the ingredients marry together so well.  You do need to let this salad set for a few hours for best results.

loved the recipe but I was at the cottage and didn't have all the ingredients so I used balsamic vinegar instead of vinegar. Italian spices and fresh basil. Had it sit in the fridge overnight. My guest couldn't stop eating it. Cut down the balsamic by half.

The ratio of oil to vinegar here doesn't work, but even with that the salad was quite edible. It's a good base for variation.

I made this for the first time when I had company.  Very good!  If/when I make again, I will either cut down on or omit the lemon juice entirely, as it was a bit too tart (otherwise, I'd give it 5 stars).  I didn't have any feta on hand, so I used just the Parmesan cheese.  I also omitted the black olives.  I like the fresh herbs; next time, I will add some fresh oregano.  I also plan to add some grilled chicken breast.  All in all, a great summer salad!
