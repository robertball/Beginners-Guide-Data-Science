Yep, THIS is coquito. My abuelo made it every Christmas for the parranderos-Christmas carolers who show up with guitars, guiros, drums and maracas at your house at 3 am, and won't leave til you feed them. Real coquito does NOT have eggs in it. It's just sweet milk, coconut milk, rum (dark or white, we're not that picky as long as it's Puerto Rican rum ;-)  )and cinammon, just like this. Good job!

I did not care for this recipe. Coquito I and Coquito II are the closest recipes to home (PUERTO RICO)

I followed Brownie1's directions with a few changes: I boil 3 cinnamon sticks in 3.5 cups water. I want to end up with 3 cups of cinnamon water so I add a bit more to account for evaporation. Topped it off with water to get a full 3 cups. Let it cool.  Then put cinnamon water in blender w/1 can evap milk, 1 can condensed milk, 1 can coconut milk and 1 tsp vanilla extract the first time. The second time I tried with coconut cream and it was a bit too sweet so I then added a can of coconut milk and it was PERFECT! With just the coconut milk it was a bit too thin but with both the milk and cream, it was thicker and delicious. You can leave as is so the kids can enjoy as well and add rum to individual servings for the adults. Def serve on the rocks. My mom (born & raised in PR and JUST came home from winter break over there) declared it PERFECT so this is how I'll be making coquito from now on. Yum!

I think that other recipes that include egg yolk take the true taste of coquito.  This recipe was rich and creamy, so far the best one I have ever made.  I made this as a gift and everybody loved it.

This was delicious. Brought back very fond memories of my childhood when my Puerto Rican father made this special drink on Christmas Eve. It was the only time he would allow the kids to take a sip of an alcoholic beverage. I haven't had it in years, but it tastes exactly like what I remember. Very sweet!

This will be good but if you want it great.  Boil the cinnamon sticks in the coconut milk instead of water.  Use only 1 can of that Milk and use a can of cream of coconut instead.  You still need the water because it does get thick so definitely use the 1/2 cup of water.  I also use 2 cups of Rum....Woohoo

I was so nervous at first to make this because of all the many recipes out there.  With eggs, without, just 1 spice or many spices.  I found this one to be easy and simple.  I must say I did chage it up a bit but it still came out great!  I may not be Puerto Rican but I know a good coquito when I taste it and thus one is spot on.   Instead of the dark rum I used 1/2 a cup of coconut rum & 1/2 a cup of 151 rum.  More kick but good flavors to hide it a bit.  Because I didn't have get all of the right ingredients My second batch had 1 can of eveporated milk and 1 can of cream of coconut with the water, rum mix, cinnamon and pinch of salt.  Still good but the first batch is better but combined, they are awesome!  Thanks for the recipe.  I'm going to be a coquito master, lol! But I'm serious.

There are many different ways to make Coquito, depending on where you lived in Puerto Rico, but this recipe came out just like I remember it tasting.  Thank you for posting.  It makes me homesick!

Super easy and very good!  I don't care for the egg-based coquito, so this was perfect for me.  I added more water & rum to make it less creamy.

Rich and creamy. I love the coconut flavour and the fact that it's not too sweet. A good quality dark rum is well worth the extra cost. I think I prefer this over the traditional eggnog I grew up with, and will make this again at Christmas.

Excellent!  Everyone loves it on Christmas Day.  Made a few  changes from reviews read.  Used 3 cups of cinnamon water, 1 can cream of coconut, 1 can coconut milk, 1 can evaporated milk and 1 can sweetened condensed milk.  Added ground cloves, nutmeg and 1 tsp vanilla.  Mixed with 2 cups rum.  Refrigerated for 1-2 days and served cold.  Big hit for our Holiday event.  Not a drop left so I'm making another batch for our New Years celebration.

I made this and the other recipe with more ratings but that calls for eggs, and I LOVED this one better.  It was thick and a bit heavy on the coconut taste, but I added a little more water and rum, and it was perfection.

I made it just as Teresita prescribed. It took me all the way back to my childhood when my Puerto Rican neighbors would whip up gallons of this stuff for all to have. So glad I've found this!

This is the actual classic coquito, the one that has eggs is actually a "ponche de coquito" either one are great for las navidades... this recipe i have been making for 5 years after my mom past away and been spreading it to the family. The only thing i use a cup instead of a half a cup of water... But the best so far

I have a bottle of coquito that I used to compare this with.  The bottle (bought from store) was quite a bit sweeter than this recipe, but the taste was spot on.  I may add a little more sweetened condensed milk next time, but I like it!
