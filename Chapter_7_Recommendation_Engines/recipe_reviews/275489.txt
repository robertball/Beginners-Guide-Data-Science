I was skeptical, but Chef John has never steered me wrong. So glad I tried it as I was pleasantly surprised. It tastes fancier than it sounds, and my family loved it. Next time would use less salt and more cayenne. This will be in regular rotation.

This recipe was fantastic!  My kids ate it up. Chef John does not disappoint!  My one change is that I drained the tomatoes to keep it from being too soupy. Other than that, you need to make this recipe!!

My wife is Filipina and she kept saying while watching the video "needs soy sauce, needs soy sauce" so thanks for making the secret ingredient at the end "soy sauce"

Was always looking for a recipe such as this that hearkens back to grade school cafeteria beefaroni, and with Chef John at the helm, I had high hopes.  This didn't disappoint!  There is a certain nuanced flavor to this dish, that was even more pronounced on day two.  Kids and adults LOVED this.  Made the recipe as is, perhaps with a touch less soy sauce.  I think the only change I would make for the future would be to use the entire box of elbows instead of two cups, which might enhance the meat to pasta ratio.  This will likely become part of monthly dinner rotation.

So good! I did a half recipe because it’s only the two of us but used a whole can of tomatoes and the one cup of water at the end and it was perfect.

Great recipe, whole family loved it. Took quite a bit longer to cook down the liquid when it was just the ground beef and onions.

It was fantastic!  Way better than my family's recipe.  Way more complex flavors and a big crowd pleaser!  Trust the ingredients and the process and you won't be disappointed.  I had to switch out the chicken broth for Better Than Boullion Beef, but it really tasted fantastic.  Got lots of compliments!  Will add this to my repertoire of easy weeknight cooks.

1 12 oz. package of elbow macaroni seems to be the perfect amount for this recipe! I’ll definitely make this recipe again.

So easy - that was great!  Used extra old cheddar and home made chicken broth, and I learned I’ve been doing the meat wrong for all these years - frying to a dry pan makes a world of difference to the texture of the meat. I’ll definitely make again, and likely be a bit more generous with the cayenne.  Cheap and easy, I fed my adult sons and some of their friends with bread I made this weekend, they cleaned the pot as well as the dog does. Thank you!

Very easy to make and tastes great as directed. My granddaughter requested this in her lunch for school.
It's also easily tweaked to ones own personal tastes.

I made this today. Absolutely wonderful!  I changed it up a bit by adding sweet Italian sausage, mushrooms, peppers, shredded yellow cheddar and parmigiana cheese. I also substituted ziti pasta and added crushed tomatoes along with the diced tomatoes. Yummy

This tasted great but came out far too liquid.  I didn't even add the extra cup of water.  In the future i will cut the chicken broth in half.

Don’t confuse this dish with recipes for ‘chili Mac.’ The flavor profile of Chef John’s version is excellent. I made it exactly as directed, shared the outcome with friends, all of whom asked for the recipe. Very easy to make.

I typically expect Chef John recipes to have a lot of steps and be a lot of work, but this one wasn’t bad at all. My picky kids really liked it and want me to make it again. Only change was cooking and storing the noodles separately so they wouldn’t get soggy.

My wife is a great cook but oddly, never had a goulash recipe. This one looked pretty good so we tried it and LOVED it! It has a lot of flavor. Our teenage sons liked it too. Her recipe box now has a GREAT goulash recipe.

Yes I would make it again. But, I would`nt put the macaroni in the soup as soon as I did.  The macaroni gets mushy if over cooked.  You have to eat it before it gets over cooked.  That was my error.  I have started adding cayenne to many of my dishes like John, he`s right it does add more flavor.

Makes a large batch and it is very good.  I was skeptical about adding so much paprika when I first read the recipe but I trust Chef John after making many of his recipes. Only thing I changed was diced and sauted a green bell pepper along with the onion.  I ended up using 1 cup of elbow macaroni and a cup of large seashell macaroni as that is what I had on hand.  I also used mild yellow cheddar instead of the white cheddar. These weren't changes that really altered the recipe's taste.  It was easy to make and a definite keeper.  Nice comfort food on a cold evening...and adding some garlic toast to eat with it was a nice complement.

Recipe was fantastic. I added a diced green bell pepper and 1 Tbsp tomato paste after the onion and burger cooked down and simmered a couple of minutes before resuming the rest of the recipe. Great recipe!

I made this the exact way it was written and I really really loved it.  My family found that the spices were a bit over the top (Italian parsley and Italian seasoning) but I had no issues with it.  It may have been a tad salty and I'd cut down on the soy sauce a bit. but I really loved it!

We really enjoyed this recipe! It's versatile and you can easily add what you like to it. I did not find it to be too watery. I added a green bell pepper and 3 ribs of celery (both chopped) with the onion. Right before I turned off the heat I added 2 cans cannellini beans. This is definitely going in the regular rotation.

This is an easy, delicious recipe that can yield even tastier leftovers for lunches.  The seasoning is really good.  Great for busy weeks.
(My burners need to be replaced so my  timing is a bit off.)

Absolutely delicious!  Loved that the macaroni cooks right in the sauce.  The best goulash I've ever had or made.  Excellent.

I felt like the soup was missing something, I am big into spice, so I added some chili powder and crushed red pepper flakes.  This recipe is 3 stars for me as written.  I did not make revisions until after the first bite.

I made this as written but cut it in half as I have a small family. We all found it too salty. It’s a good recipe but next time I will not add the additional salt and I will use salt-free broth. That should help.
