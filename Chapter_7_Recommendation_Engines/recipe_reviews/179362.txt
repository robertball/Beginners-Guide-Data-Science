No, this is not a 'standard' pumpkin pie and thus, does not taste like one! It is, however, quick, tasty and unique. It has a lightness to it. My children love to make this pie, as they can do it all by themselves.

Sorry, the bisquick mix ruined it for me.  This was not to my liking.  It just didn't seem like REAL pumpkin pie to me.

This was the first pie I have ever made! It was Impossibly Easy!! I liked it because it wasn't too pumpkiny. Everybody had seconds..I'll take that as they thought it was pretty tasty. thanks for the recipe ; )
