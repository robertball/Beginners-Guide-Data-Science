Oooh! These are really good! Made them just a bit more healthy by using all bran cereal, honey in place of corn syrup, and cut the white sugar amount in half. I put in a few cups of granola for the bran too! I boiled the peanut butter mixture over the stove and it was having trouble getting to the right consistency, so I added applesauce until it was runny enough to coat the cereal mixture. About 1/2 cup of applesauce worked great. A new favorite! :)

Great recipe- my husband loves them and he is a die hard 'cliff bar' eater.  I read the other reviews regarding the need for more liquid to hold the bars together, and I found it wasn't really needed if you followed a few tips. First the peanut butter mixture needs to be really hot(like the recipe says- BUBBLING)- even after you mix in the powdered milk- if not it is virtually impossible to stir it into the cereal mixture.  Also, really press the mixture hard into the greased pan- pack it in and it will stay together.  I found that we wanted the bars packed tight so that they would be more sturdy when packed for the trail without falling apart.  Try adding different fruits and white chocolate instead of semi-sweet.  My husband loved banana chips, dates and white chocolate with the peanut butter.  Again- GREAT recipe.

Wow! Great recipe, Janowa. My grandchildren love these, as do I!They gobbled up so many, I was afraid they'd be bouncing off the walls on a sugar high. This morning I made another batch, this time I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup brown (the dried fruits have lots already), I added Wheat germ and ground almonds for additional calcium, Vit B and minerals. They were tasty, too, and my grandchildren won't even suspect that there's wheat germ in them.Thanks for this great recipe that becomes a roadmap to better nutrition for our kids!

This is the best recipe for homemade "power bars" I have found on the internet. I did cut out the sugar, but added pre-sweetened protein powder instead of milk powder. I decreased the rice cereal to 6 cups, and changed the peanut butter to almond butter for a healthier bar. These are so much tastier than store bought--super processed ones!!! Thanks for the recipe idea!

I sent these to my honey in Iraq, and  the guys LOVED them!!! They travel very well, and I made some minor changes...replaced the chocolate chips with M&M's (with 108 degree heat over there, they hold up MUCH better!!), and I used dried mixed berries and dried apples - coarsely chopped, used honey and corn syrup, but left the sugar, and no sesame seeds...had a hard time mixing but I thin the PB mixture needs to be reallllly hot for it to work.  Smashed into a 9x13 pan, then chilled in the freezer before cutting into bars.  Wrapped in foil, then plastic baggies,and away they went!  That was a week ago, and they already "need" more!

These are delicious, and although they aren't low in fat or calories, they are a healthy boost of energy.  I used half honey and half cornsyrup, , dried cranberries instead of cherries, and did not add the sugar in order to cut back on calories.  I am glad I didn't, as they would have been way too sweet.  Perfect snack for hiking, day trips, or busy events.  I will definitley make these  again.

This was really good - like a healthier version of rice krispies squares. I added some flax seed and left out the chocolate chips. I also replaced half the sugar with honey after reading reviews about the dryness. It turned out perfect and held together beautifully. I'll definitely make this again.

I loved this! I altered it a bit for my tastes, and what I had around. Instead of apricots and cherrries, I just used cranberries. I used milk chocolate chips, and used half corn syrup/half honey. I also only did about 1/4 C sugar, because I used sweetened protein powder and wheat germ in place of the powdered milk. Unfortunately, I had no almond extract. I altered it quite a bit, but that's the fun of this one! Very adaptable to tastes and what you have on hand. It's great for snacking when you're too busy for a full meal! Play with it and munch! Yummy...

I had a little trouble with this recipe at first.  The peanut butter mixture didn't seem to be enough to glue the cereal together, so I had to make extra.  Also, I found heating the peanut butter and syrup in the microwave messy and more trouble than it's worth.  Next time, I will cook the mixture in a big pot on the stove, then gradually add the cereal, which I think will help it mix more evenly. The end result, though, is fantastic, and much better than those expensive energy bars that you buy in the store.  They are great for breakfast and a mid-afternoon snack. This one is a keeper!

Good Recipe!  Worth the time and effort to make - way better than anything you could buy ready made like this. I made these especially for my teenage basketball player daughter.  I thought they would be something she could grab and take to eat before or after a game.  I did add an additional cup of peanut butter as mentioned by others for easier blending of ingredients.  I cut and wrapped them individually for freezing. I don't think I'd make any changes on the fruits use when I make them again. The combination of the flavors of the seeds and dried fruits worked together perfectly.

These bars were good, but I was very disappointed when after all that work there is no instruction for baking. I baked at maybe 350 for 25 min and they burned, therefore ruining the taste. Next time I will watch them closely and cook on a lower temp.

Although I dislike when people alter a recipe and rate it based on that, I'm about to join the throngs...I omitted the sugar and used honey for half of the corn syrup.  These are exactly the texture that I've been looking for in a chewy granola bar, but until now, hadn't found.  This recipe is going to be so versatile and customizable.  For those who experienced problems with them holding together, perhaps I can offer a suggestion...It took about 8 min. in my microwave for the peanut butter mixture to come to a good boil, stirring every min. to avoid scorching.  After I stirred it into the cereal and fruit, I used my hands to knead it all together in the bowl, then dumped it into the pan.  You must really press down firmly to get it to hold together.  (You should hear some crunching of the cereal.)  I used my bench scraper to score it, then cooled it completely.  These held together better than any others I have made.  Thanks, Janowa!

Yum! I substituted here and there: added Fiber One Buds for some of the rice cereal, added wheat germ, didn't have powdered milk. I couldn't get it to stick no matter how hard I packed it. So I melted some marshmallows and dumped it all in, mixed, and repressed it into the pan. Worked great. I figured, marshmallow rice crispy treats stay together, so, why not these? Try it!

these were EXCELLENT!!  I will never buy another granola bar.  My kids loved them.  I made them before a camping/canoe trip (as the store bought were just too expensive) and they were a hit!  One bar carried you through for lunch easily.  They're very calorie dense.
I used honey in place of the corn syrup and brown sugar in place of white.  Other than that I followed the recipe faithfully and was not disappointed!

this was yummy, gave to friends, neighbors, & even took some to a potluck; every body loved it & several people also asked for the recipe.  I used one large bag of dried mixed fruit from sun maid. instead of buy each seperately

I'm really enjoying these bars. I cut back on the rice krispies to 6 cups, cut back the sugar to 1/2 c.(used brown), and ran out of corn syrup so I had to make up the difference with honey(about 1/4 c.).  Make sure you watch your sunflower seeds and sesame seeds closely when toasting, they go from toasted to burned very quickly!  I will make these again for a semi-healthy snack option.

Fantastic!  My wife and I loved them!  I think next time I will pump the brakes on the sesame seeds....they tend to overpower.  A very versatile recipe, that I look forward to playing with.

These are incredibly easy to put together, and you can adjust the fruit etc. to make them taste to your liking. I used a multi-grain rolled cereal that had oats, wheat, rye, and barley in place of the rolled oats. Also, I left out the white sugar, and added 1/4 cup brown sugar and used organic Agave nectar in place of the corn syrup. Outstanding! They were still a bit sweet for me, so next time I'm going to try brown rice syrup. I hike a ton, and these really give me the sustained energy I need. Excellent recipe!!

Great bars.  Very tasty!  Didn't have all ingredients on hand so substitued some and cut sugar amount in half so not as sweet!  Will be making these again!  Oh, and you don't bake them so that is why they burnt.

These are great and easy to make!  My husband is a big cyclist and these little bars can keep him going on long rides.  You can really vary what is inside them based on personal preferences and what you have on hand.  We substituted honey for the corn syrup and decided that we would probably leave out the sesame seeds next time. A great way to save money on expensive energy bars!

These area great!  At first I thought they were going to be really crabbily.  But my packaging helped out with that problem.  I cut individual bars and put them in individual food saver packages.  So I could take them backpacking with me.  The vacuum packing must have really pressed things together and they turned out .... well better than the one's you buy in the store for about $1.25 each.  So my recommendation is to press the heck out of them on the cookie sheet or where ever you have the bars sitting to cool.  I mean really press the heck out of them.  I also think the modifications to this could be close to endless in terms of what to add to change the flavor.

I made this recipe with some minor changes according to what I had in the pantry. I formed them into little balls for my grandson, and we call these 'cookie balls'. Great to make in the summer when you don't want the oven on.

Followed the recipe as written, except for substituting cranberries for the cherries.  Couldn't get it to stick together no matter how hard I packed it - wish I'd added more peanut butter as one reviewer recommended.  Anyway, it's a delicious snack!  Before packing it into the pan I used, we sprinkled the mixture on top of vanilla yogurt and WOW!  Would be great on ice cream, too!  This is a versatile little snack.  Makes a bunch of dirty dishes, but very tasty and pretty decent nutrition.  The whole family, including two little ones, loved it - just wish I could use it like bars.  Will definitely try again with more peanut butter next time.  Update: Freezes well and sticks together better after frozen!

These are good...probably better if I followed the recipe closer! I used Splenda in place of the corn syrup and sugar and found a trail mix with sunflower seeds, papaya, apples, raisins, cranberries and nuts.  The only change I'd make to the way I did it is to add corn syrup instead of making the simple syrup... I also heated up the peanut butter mixture on the stove. I'll probably be making these often! Thanks for a great recipe! It's so versatile!

These are very messy to make but worth the effort in taste! I used extra raisins and cranberries instead because dried fruit is expensive. I got bulk seeds for really cheap. I used sesame and flax (because flax is really cheap in bulk). I did reduce the sugar to just half a cup and they turned out really good. In the future I would like to substitute the corn syrup with something healthier without sacrificing taste. Any suggestions? I could eat the entire pan of these

It is well worth having all of these ingredients on hand- these are fabulous. The sauce to hold together is just enough, so do not throw in extra ingredients.

These were quite good. If I could find the Whey I bet it would be 5 stars. Made way too much and froze  some, they defrosted just fine.

These turned out good! I use honey instead of corn syrup, and a flavored protein powder instead of powdered milk. The great thing about this recipe is that it can be customized to your own liking! There are a lot of ingredients that can be switched out for different ones. This is MUCH cheaper than buying energy bars at the store. I will definitely be making these again!

These were great. Its a really good recipe to use up random leftovers in your house. I used a combination of 2 cereals that no one would eat. I think it was a kashi kids cereal and a multi flake cereal and just crushed it a little bit. For the fruit I only had dates, crasins, and a little coconut so that's what went in :) Just tried to stick to the same amount of each...2 cups of fruit and 7 cups of cereal. Did not have any chocolate chips either. I also substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar for the white and 1/2 cup steel cut oats for the rolled. MY KIDS ARE LOVING THEM! Thanks for a great recipe :)

Just made my second batch of these.  First batch didn't have chocolate chips in them and I added coconut and some various dried fruits I had on hand.  Those were a huge hit!  This time I added the chocolate chips and notice that they melted the second the warm peanut butter goo hit them so these will definately taste different.  I bulked this recipe up with pumpkin seeds, walnuts, coconut, some left over chowmein noodles (just to get rid of them) and some dried mango and dried banana.  I also left out the white sugar and used half corn syrup and half sugar free maple syrup and I used organic crunchy peanut butter and soy protein powder in place of the powdered milk. I sampled a clump before I pressed it in the pan and it was tasty so I am pretty sure the bars will also be really good.

These were OK.  Kids didn't like them at all. My husband and I enjoyed them as a healthier alternative to sweeter treats. I used flax seeds in place of sesame seeds. Only used dates and golden raisins, no other fruits. They fell apart easily, making them tough to eat. Toasting the sunflower seeds gave them a very nutty aroma and flavor.

These are really good. I used walnuts, ground up instead of sunflower seeds because I didn't have any. I used 3/4 c honey and 1/4 c corn syrup and 1 c brown sugar. They were quite sweet. I will try different mixtures of frit and nuts next time. I will also only use honey and brown sugar. Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

I'm giving this ***** because there is SO mch you can do with this recipe!!!  I used sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds along with craisins and dried cherries.  I used only honey and added more peanut butter but still found that they were a tad crumbly..I think I'll add 1/4 cup more peanut butter next time...Took these to a soccer tournament and the girls devoured them!!!!!  Great healthy boost for between matches!

These weren't as good as they sounded.  They laid around for a whole week of skiing with a condo full of people and didn't get eaten.  I couldn't get them to stick together and the choc and pnut butter overpowered them.  I might try them without these 2 ingredients.

This recipe was very good, definitely a repeat.  I changed some of the dried fruits and chose a more nutritious puffed grain, but kept the same proportions.  Next time I may add 1/3 cup more sticky stuff, maybe honey or soy lecithin.  It was just a touch crumbly.

I typically have trouble getting these to stick together as a bar but rather go for the yogurt topping crumble texture instead. I have made this many times with whatever dried fruits I have available and whatever nut are in the pantry and they are always delicious. I often make this as a gift for first time moms as the high protein and calcium make it an easy meal on top of the yogurt.

I made these for my teenage swimmer sons to eat before practice. I pretty much followed the recipe except I used cranberries instead of cherries, added a little wheat germ, and subbed 1/3 cup agave for 1/2 of the sugar. I boiled the peanut butter mixture in a large stock pot until bubbly, then added powdered milk and returned to boiling, stirring constantly. Then removed from heat and stirred in flavorings. I added the cereal mixture 1/2 at a time to make stirring easier and with a bit of muscle I was able to mix it well. Smashed the bars in the pan really well. I cut them up and individually wrapped the bars. Hopefully the 325 calories will give them a much needed energy boost. They loved the taste. Next time I make them I think I will use up all the fruit and nuts that I bought and make a few batches of the fruit/nut mixture to have ready to make later. That way I won't have to dirty up the food processor and kitchen all over again.

Best Energy bar  recipe ever,  I love how the recipe is so versatile,  I used  a Granola Cereal with mixed dried fruit,  I added chopped raisins, cranberries, and mixed nuts. I substituted the milk for a chocolate protein powder and  cut used 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also heated the Peanut butter mix on the stove,  as it would have been too messy in the microwave,  when the mixture was bubbling i poured it over the granola and mixed like I've never mixed before.  Punched it down till it was nice and tight cut and cooled for 2hrs.  Bagged them and sent them with my hunney  who was going on a 4day hike. He loved them and so did his fellow hikers.

PEANUT FREE VARIATION!!!- We have a very sensitive peanut allergy in my family, so I substituted sunflower butter in place of peanut butter. Because sunflower butter is much more liquid than peanut butter is, I decided to use melted marshmallows (a la rice crispie treats) instead of corn syrup, to sticky it up more. Unfortunately, I didn't use enough marshmallows, so the bars didn't stick together as bars. But it did make a great granola! We just crumbled it up and ate it like trail mix. It tasted great!

Very tasty. I used a mixture of 90% glucose and 10% honey because I didn't have corn syrup. I also didn't read the directions carefully and brought the peanut butter/sweetener concoction to a simmer over the stove. I got distracted, so it began to burn just a little. Because I overcooked the binder/sugar/PB concoction and my largest bowl barely contained everything, it was difficult to stir it all together. Once the PB/sugar mixture cooled it was very stiff. I tried kneading it with my (clean) hands which worked better. Didn't have a jelly roll pan, so I used a cookie sheet. After I cut the cooled bars, I had about 20% of the cereal, nuts and fruits and cooled PB mixture fall off. Hating to waste it, I tried it as a breakfast cereal. It was DELICIOUS! And the bars are, too! A great accompaniment to a cup of morning coffee and a healthy snack for my kid's lunchbox. Worth the effort.

The taste is absolutely awesome and addictive.  I made the recipe exactly as suggested.  The bars did tend to fall apart a bit, but maybe I needed to pack it tighter?

I found this the most frustrating slice I have ever made. The peanut mixture was no way near enough in quantity to bind the dry ingredients. I ended up tossing in an extra whole 500gm jar of honey and putting all the ingredients into a large pot on the stove on low heat to be able to mix it all together. The end result tastes okay but really sweet (little wonder). I think I'll stick to my regular muesli bar recipe.

Made bars exactly as recipe said. Took them to a Mite Hockey (kids ages 7-9)tournament. The kids gobbled them down and parents were happy to have kids have a healthy snack. The kids played harder then they ever have and took 2nd at the State tournament! Maybe these bars were the reason? I did have trouble fitting the whole recipe in the jelly roll pan. I'll try a larger cookie sheet next time or maybe something with higher sides so it doesn't overflow.

This is excellent!  My family really liked it. Thank-you!  It's very filling.  Instead of the cherries & dates I used cranberries, prunes, dried apples & pears. I did not put any of the fruit or seeds in the food processor, I left them whole and just chopped the bigger pieces into the size of raisons. I also added 1/2C. toasted pumpkin seeds.  Instead of 1C. rolled oats, I used 2C. of fruit granola and then decreased the rice cereal by 1C.  Stirring in the peanut mixture to the dry goodies was difficult I found as it was very stiff and sticky.  It fit into a jellyroll pan and didn't crumble when I cut mine.  It all stay together nicely.  When I tasted it I was very surprised that it didn't have an overly peanutbutter taste and it also has the right amount of sweetness.  Thank-you. It's a keeper!

I give these five stars but for some reason my kids didn't like as much as I did. I didn;t have cherries or apricots so I didn't add. Nest time I will only use 1/2 the amount of sugar called for just to make a little healthier. Thanks for the recipe!!

I replaced the 1/2 cup dried apricots and 1/2 cup dried cherries with 1 cup of chopped mixed dried fruit (pears, peaches, apricots, prunes and apples). It was absolutely delicious. All the adults who tried it adored it. The children however weren't so unanimously enthused (too healthy, I guess...).

My husband was going backpacking so I made these for him and his pal.  He said they held him from breakfast til dinner one day. I subbed almonds and walnuts and only used raisins and apricots.  So it was way nutty, but figured, hey, just more protein.

My family loved these bars! The only thing I did different was to add 1 cup extra peanut butter so it stuck together better.

I replaced corn syrup with honey and left out sugar.  I will do so again as it tastes great with the added benefit of being healthier.

SO SO SO YUMMY!!!! Don't forget the almond essence, that's the best part! I used Nature valley brown rice cereals. I trick, mix the grains and oat with the dry fruit, it prevents lumps and helps to stick everything together. Use parchemin paper instead of butter in a backing sheet. Use honey instead of corn syrup.

Love these bars. I have switched a lot of the ingredients, based on what I've had on hand. I usually never add the sugar or corn syrup, just a little honey and low sugar maple syrup.  They always turn out well.

The best recipe ever!  My grandchildren, children and husband love this!  It works great for my husband who does not like to eat breakfast before he goes to work at 6am, perfect for him to take and eat in the truck during the day at break times.

These were incrediblely easy to make and even better to eat.  Next time I make these I think I will try and add in some bits of apples for an extra kick.

WOW! These are kicked up rice krispie treats. Perfect amounts of all ingredients. Can mix up the dried fruit combos but otherwise don't change a thing.  The kids are gobbling them up!!! Thanks for the recipe.  What a hit. 3/16/10 Update:  tried to cut down on the c.syrup and sugar and use applesauce in their place.  Don't.  Won't hold together.  Should have taken my own advice and stick to the recipe!!!

Very good energy bar, yummy, required cals, easily chewed, no melting chocolate (in pocket), no sugar rush,however, I'm wondering how you fit 15 or so cups of food into a jellyroll pan - I transferred it into a lasagna dish.
