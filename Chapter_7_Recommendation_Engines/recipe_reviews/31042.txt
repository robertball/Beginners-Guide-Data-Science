My husband made these and I loved it! Don't be put off by the amount of onions in it, they become nice and sweet after cooking and with the raisins, honey and cinnamon. We used ground turkey with great results.

Initially, I got the “Huh?” look from my family when I mentioned this recipe, but once the meatballs were on the table, they were eaten with gusto. Having made this recipe several times now, I've made a few adjustments: 1) Grate one onion and use this in the meat. It's easier to form the meatballs 2) use 2-3 pieces of soggy bread that are either torn or sliced. One piece wasn't enough to hold together all the meat 3) add more raisins (but, that's a taste preference) 4) add more Middle Eastern spices. We add a pinch of cardamom, some allspice and lots of cumin. The additional spices and raisins help increase the sweet to savory ratio.  Finally, about those onions. Yes, they do produce water and create a liquid for the meatballs to simmer in. And with the additional spices, they are quite tasty. But 5 were just too much. Because we eat the meatballs as is (rather than served with pasta or rice), the onions overwhelmed the meat. I've since cut down on the number of onions used and add water instead before simmering.   Overall, great recipe. Thanks.

I made this with half ground chicken and half ground beef, and added in the onion as another reviewer suggested.  I also used bread soaked in milk and the balls formed nicely.  I also added a fair bit more water and some chicken broth for the sauce.  It had a great sweet/savory flavor.  Yum!

My husband came in and asked what was for dinner.  I said "meatballs."  He looked in the pot and said "Raisins with meatballs?"  He was rather skeptical ...

After a few bites, he looked at me and said, "My dear, you have once again achieved the unlikely."  He likes it!  And so do I.  It's an unusual combination of flavors, but very good!  I think it needs something else, though ... cloves ... and/or garlic ... maybe?

Very tasty. A unique combination of flavors. We served it over brown rice and there was enough sauce to go around.

This was very very good. I scaled this down and left the egg out. I used panko bread crumbs and added a plash of 2% milk to dampen them barely. I used dried minced onion in the meatballs themselves and sliced the rest up instead of chopping them. I didn't use nearly the amount of oil they called for, only used as little as possible. I used chicken broth instead of water as is my norm. I paired this with some basmati "simple spiced rice" that had cinnamon stick and bay leaf and it was a perfect combo! Thanks for a wonderful meal.

These were Amazing! I didn't use all of the onions but next time I will.  Onions produce water and I needed a few extra tablespoons. I also added garlic to the meatballs.  DE-LISH! These will absolutely be a staple in my house!

This was okay, but like other reveiwers i felt like it was missing something. I tried adding some allspice and it seemed to just enhance the sweetness, maybe something to had a bit og spiciness to contrast with the sweet would work better. Play around with it, and it could be great.

These meatballs are delicious.  I liked them so much I made them for the Christmas Table at my firm and got raves in response.  My favorite compliment was, "Great meatballs.  In fact, it's more than a meatball."

I made this for Ramadan and it was super easy to make! The meat did need a little more seasoning. Next time i may make them bigger and put the raisins inside the meatballs as well as a few crushed pine nuts. And during the last few minutes in the pan, i would drizzle a little pomegranate syrup on top. It would make a really good sauce!
