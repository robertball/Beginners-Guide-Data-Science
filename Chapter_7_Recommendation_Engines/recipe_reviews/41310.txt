a good bread machine recipe is hard to find, but this is really good.  i used dried, minced chives from my spice cabinet and this bread would be delicious without them too!  BRAVO! has a nice texture coming from the machine.

The crust was rock hard and the bread was not very flavorful.

Family loved this bread and I found one review to be very unhelpful and mean spirited.

This bread is excellent, what a nice addition to a great meal!  Someone else posted that good bread machine recipes are hard to come by and I agree-don't pass this one up.  Makes a very tender and delicious loaf of bread.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

This was great. I used fat free sour cream and dried chives because thats what I had. It turned out beautifully, soft and fragrant. I will make this again.

Great bread!  Followed the directions to a "T".  Used fresh chives from the garden.  My oldest son was not sure if he would like it because of the chives, but he ended up eating half the loaf by himself.  Made the house smell so good.

This tasted delicious, but the top of my bread caved in a little during baking. Any suggestions what I did wrong?

Great bread machine recipe!  I used fresh chives, and wished I would have used a lot more because the chive taste was not very strong at all.  That is the only thing I would have changed.
