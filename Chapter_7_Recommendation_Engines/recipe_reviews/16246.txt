I'm not sure if I'd call these the "Biggest or the Bestest" burgers I've ever had, but they certainly were very good. I was a bit skeptical about using teriyaki in a burger mixture as I thought it might overpower the other flavors, but it was actually a nice addition. I cut the recipe in half for one pound of burger meat and got three nice size patties. I used 1/2 tsp. of dried onion flakes vs. chopped onion (was a bit lazy), 1/4 tsp. of black pepper, left out the salt, and used 1 Tbsp. of low sodium teriyaki and 1 Tbsp. of low sodium soy sauce along with the rest of the ingredients. These held together on the grill perfectly and smelled great. They had a wonderful flavor! Perfect on toasted rolls with melted cheese, grilled onion, lettuce, tomato and a dill pickle on the side!

Personally I did not care for these burgers at all.  I followed the recipe exactly, but the burgers tasted very "oriental" and were extremely salty (and believe me, I like alot of salt on my burgers!).  My 2 and 3 year olds would not touch these after one bite.  I'd suggest cutting the recipe in half so you only waste one pound of hamburger if you don't like it.  I have 5 burgers I'm throwing down the disposal.

This is a great recipe, and while I did leave out the salt (didn't feel like it needed it) it was a great recipe and I appreciate it being posted.

These burgers were really good.  I cooked them on the stovetop as we don't have a bbq and I had just cleaned my oven and didn't want to get it dirty!  I'm sure the flavor would be even better when grilled or broiled.  I'll make these again!

Oh my gosh! This has to be the absolute best hamburger I think I have ever eaten. I followed the recipe ingredients to the letter and wouldn't change a thing. However, after forming patties, I put them in the freezer to firm up a bit since they were pretty moist and I thought that they might fall apart on the grill. The flavors melded together as any great recipe should. We had one burger left-over that I just ate for lunch (two days later) and it was even better today than the first day. I just placed it in the microwave for about 20 seconds, topped with a slice of swiss and some minced green onion and nuked it again for about 10 seconds. No bun necessary. I'm not kidding you - it tasted better than any burger I've ever had. This has become our new favorite burger with or without the bun!

This is one tasty burger!  I liked the fact that it didn't have an egg in it, just something with an egg mixed in takes away some beef flavor.  I scaled the recipe to 1 serving & then halved it because there is no way that I could eat 1/2 lb. burger (I didn't think the kids would like it & hubbys out).  I skipped the salt, used onion powder vs. the onion & subbed steak sauce for the teriyaki (I'm out) & made these on my handy George Foreman grill.  YUM!  Thanks Susan!!

Absolutely best homemade burger ever! We are not big fans of teriyaki sauce, so we used our favorite steak sauce, Peter Luger's, instead. We didn't use onion buns, as suggested, but used potato buns. We topped the burgers with cheese, bacon, and caramelized onions and now I have to go get something to eat b/c my mouth is watering. A definite keeper !!!

The only thing I didn't like about these was too salty.  Will definately make again, and just omit the salt.  They were so juicy and wonderful.  Thanks for posting.

It was good, but it was too much like meatloaf.  It did not taste like a hamburger.  We won't be making this one again.

Great burger! I grilled this (on top of a sheet of foil), I only used half the bread crumbs, I used A1 steak sauce instead of teriyaki & I  topped them w/ swiss cheese. I did use onion rolls...POIFECT! We really, really enjoyed these burgers! We served them w/ spicy sweet potato wedges w/ honey mustard sauce, big thick gourmet sweet pickle slices & vodka smoothies (from thsi site) for the adults & orange smoothie (also from thsi site) for our grandson w/ Chocolate Wafer Ice Cream Sandwiches (also from this site) for dessert...thansk for the recipe, Susan Payzant!

Really good. Scaled the recipe in half and it made 2 large burgers. We didn't put any cheese on top, and used dehydrated onions instead, but kept everything else the same. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to lay off the additional salt cos the teriyaki sauce has plenty. I will definitely make this again.

I'm in the middle of making this right now. I halved it, and made 3 large and one kid sized patties out of a pound of ground beef. I added an egg, as I am pan frying them. They are delicious to me and my boyfriend, but my 3 year old isn't a fan. Quick, easy and delicious. I put cheddar cheese on them :)

I would first like to start out by saying how disappointed I was that some people reviewed this without even trying it.  The title isn't "Biggest Healthiest Bestest Burger."  I can see taking a look at the ingredients and deciding to keep looking but posting a negative review based on ingredients alone seems unfair.

I did try the recipe and am giving it 2 stars.  These were edible but not anything that my family cared for.  My husband took a couple of bites and put it down (I knew then that something was wrong).  I followed the recipe to the letter and although I didn’t find it too salty, it did resemble meatloaf and that wasn't what I was looking for.  Also, I could really taste the basil.  Maybe that is just because it isn’t a taste I would normally associate with a burger.?  I will continue searching for a favorite burger recipe and in the meantime, I will go back to just using salt, pepper, and “Montreal Steak” grilling seasonings.  Thanks anyway!

Comments on nutrition comments:  nutrition is for a half-pound of meat and includes the roll and the cheese.  Just something to keep in mind when comparing nutrition.  So if you don't eat a half-pound of meat and don't eat the cheese, that would make a difference.

Made this last night and got excellent reviews from some of the most pickyest people on the planet!!  The only thing different is you might try a slice of provolone or mozzarella.

We usually have 1lb of ground beef on hand. We don't cut back on the add-ins and the result is a flavorful and great textured burger.

Definately a 5 star burger. I did add an egg to the mixture, as some reviews said these were falling apart while cooking.  The result was awesome, these were so moist and flavorful. Next time, I would use maybe 1/2 of an onion instead of a whole one- it seems a little too much considering there are so many other flavors going on. I used roasted garlic teriyaki sauce and topped these with swiss and american cheese. Excellent! Can't wait to make these again.

This is a FANTASTIC burger.  I made some last night for my husband and we both just loved it!  Not sure what anyone is talking about if they don't like it.  It's perfect.  I would recommend to everyone to not read the negative reviews and just make it and see for yourself. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I don't eat onions so I took those out.  Otherwise I followed this recipe to the letter and it turned out pretty good.  I used to do the onion soup mix too but never again! This will definitely be a repeat at my house.

Absolutely one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. We eat lots of burgers and have tried many recipes, including ones that suggest you stuff the burger w/ any number of ingredients. But this definitely tops most of them all so far hands down. Thanks!

This is an awesome recipe!  It seems like whenever I cook something with teryaki sauce it burns on the pan before it cooks all the way.  Probably my fault!  But now I cook the burgers/chicken on one side with nothing in the pan and then add 1/4 cup of water and some seasoning when I flip them and it is very juicy.  I will always cook my burgers like this now. I changed it a bit - actually did 2x the crumbs and 2x the sauce.  They turned out great using a very lean ground turkey. They held together so well with additional crumbs and sauce.

Big?  Yes.  Best?  No.  They were okay, but not anything spectacular.  Make again?  Maybe.  I really didn't like the texture from the bread crumbs.  Made the burger too "mealy"; I want MEAT.  Taste was rather bland, even with using partial seasoned salt and garlic.

These were great!  They had just enough flavor to keep them from being too bland or too overpowered.  I would suggest substituting some onion powder for the chooped onion (dice your onions, don't just chop them, or your burger will fall apart more easily).  These would be great with some sauteed mushrooms!

Verrry delicious!!  Maybe it's a UK thing, but I definitely want more than salt and pepper on my minced beef to make it a real burger...  Onions, without a doubt.  Plenty of herbs.  I'd never used breadcrumbs in a burger recipe before, but it all worked very well - no problems with it holding together!  Teriyaki sauce gave a delicious richness; i can imagine it being salty if the teriyaki wasn't as good as it should have been, but it was fine for us.  Had to sub for the parmesan, and used plain breadcrumbs with Italian seasoning separately as we couldn't get Italian seasoned breadcrumbs!  Served on wholegrain rolls (lightly toasted on the bbq), with rocket, tomato and dijon-mustard mayonnaise - everyone rated it 'a good 4 stars'.  Definite make again.

I substituted ground turkey breast for the beef and used fat free cheddar cheese. It tasted wonderful. I plan to have this again.

I followed the directions exactly and really enjoyed this recipe. I was worried it would be too salty, but it seemed perfect to me. I will definitely make this again. I prefer this over the grill, especially when it's 30 degrees outside!

This burger really lives up to it's name! My husband can't get enough of them! When I first made it, I didn't have teriyaki sauce so I substituted it with bbq sauce and it came out great! I've made this again and again and everyone loves them! I've been told they are like mini meatloafs, you don't even need a bun!

These burgers rock!  I used one pound of ground beef and half a pound of ground chicken. Since I keep kosher, the cheese was out, but they were fabulous nonetheless. Leave out the salt - it's unnecessary. They burst with flavor as is.

Decided to try something new to season my burgers and now I am never going back to the onion soup mix.  This was honestly the best burger I have had.  One warning however.  I mixed the ingredients together and then let it sit until we were ready to grill and some of the burgers at the bottom of the bowl turned out a little too teryaki, so make sure you mix it well and make them into burgers right away.  Super moist and just the right about of flavor.  Yum!

Based on the reviews I thought this was a home-run, but not so. Seasoning was okay, but adding the breadcrumbs made it taste and feel like bad imitation meat. I probably won't make this again.

Cut the salt (either in half or completely) & it's a tasty burger! If you find you need a little salt, it's easy enough to shake on later.

I used lean ground beef. I added only 1/4 of a teaspoon of basil because I don't like it very much. I added marble cheddar cheese, and Cougar Gold cheese. I didn't add parmesan. I used whole wheat buns. They were good!

It was a good recipe.  Left out soy sauce because people had previously complained of the saltiness and I'm not a fan of salty.  Lot of onion though.   If you like that you'll like the hamburger.

Maybe a little too salty.  Try 1/2 of the salt and less the 2 tsp. of Teriyaki.  Other than that, it's tremendous!

Made this with ground turkey and I agree with Wilemon, this was like a meatloaf on a bun. I liked most of the ingredients, but I could certainly live without the bread crumbs. Will do this again without the crumbs. Good base tho and thanks!

They are the best I've had so far. The consistency was great and the combination of flavors added a great deal of flavor without any one being to over powering.

Okay - make sure that the onions are finely, finely chopped.  My family was not too keen on this burger - I guess it is the plain old patty for us.

These burgers were amazing!I took the advice other reviewers and used onion powder instead of onions.(My fiance will not eat onions)I also used steak sauce instead of teriyaki sauce. The steak sauce gave it an awesome flavor. They came out really tender and juicy. I also have the option of "hi" or "lo" broil on my stove so i broiled them half hi and half lo.

My husband and I loved these burgers!! They had the best flavor!!! The only thing I would do different next time is broil them for about 6 minutes on each side instead of 8...and that is only because my children did not like the burnt appearance on top! But we followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect...it is a definite 5 star burger in our opinion! Thanks!

Met rave reviews at a family picnic.  I mixed and shaped the burgers early in the day and cooked them on the grill right before eating.  The size of patty suggested in the recipe was too large, so I made twice as many burgers as suggested.

I tried this with ground turkey and it was good.  It did have a "meatloafy" taste.  I will try again without the breadcrumbs and with ground beef.

These were really good, but a bit too salty for our tastes. I think that if I make them again, I would probably not add any salt. I also halved the pepper, because 1 tsp. is ALOT of pepper to add if you want to taste the actual burger! All in all, it was pretty good.

Perhaps not the absolute best I have ever eaten but very good nonetheless.  I omitted the salt altogether as there is plenty of salt in the teriyaki and parmesan.

This was so good!  I'm cooking for myself, so I scaled the recipe way down and I'm sure my measurements were a little inexact, but it turned out great.  I cooked it in a George Foreman grill, and it fell apart a little, but it was still wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I really liked this recipe.  My husband thought it tasted more like meatloaf than a hamburger.  It was juicy and quick to make.  I recommend eating it with a yummy potato salad and fruit instead of fries.

I didn't have any Italian bread crumbs, so I dried out a piece of bread and added some Italian seasoning. And instead of teriyaki sauce I used teriyaki barbecue sauce and it was TERRIFIC! Really good stuff!

This burger was very tasty and easy to make. However, the teriyaki sauce overpowers the beef taste, so if you'd like to taste more of the beef than the sauce, I'd reduce the sauce by half or use a different recipe.

I had these hamburgers last night and they were so juicy.  I ate two, which barely fit in my stomach!  My girls always give me a hard time about eating and they devored them and asked for seconds!  Absolutely the juicest I have ever had!  You got to try them!

It was fabulous.  I don't think I would use basil though if kids or picky eaters are eating.  Makes it a little too strong.  But great tasting burgers

Excellent! I have been looking for a good burger recipe for the oven that was juicy and full of flavor. This is it. Added a few more spices, but other than that, made it as specified. Great, will make again.

Wow!  Soooooo good!

I used a red onion on a whim, which provided a very strong flavor to the burger.  

The  burger was to die for.

Thank you

Made these tonight for my family, burgers were ok, but the teriyaki flavor was overpowering. My husband  wants to try them again and cut the teriyaki in half.  That might work or i might try what other reviewers suggest and use steak sauce. We did like the texture and because it is so soft and moist we gave half of one to our 11 month old to try want him to get used to "people food" and he ate about half of that so i guess he liked it ok.

This is now our new Family Hamburger. It was a hit with everyone! I ended up Pan Frying ours on the stove top. I made ours extra thick and was worried about the overall taste of the burger since it didnt leave allot of room for toppings, but the meat was so tasty that it didnt matter that it was missing all the extra toppings!

Not sure I should review this recipe b/c I changed it so much but it turned out so well that I thought I share my ideas with everyone. Used 4 lbs. meat (and made 9 burgers), 1 1/4 tsp. black pepper, for the onions I used 2 tsp. onion powder [might use more next time] , 1/2 tsp. salt, omitted the basil and bread crumbs, used 6 T of Parmesan cheese, used 3/4 cup Bulls-eye Sweet and Tangy BBQ sauce, added 4 eggs [beaten], added 3 T Worcestershire sauce, added 2 T liquid smoke flavoring b/c I cooked them indoors on a griddle. Stuck the formed patties in the freezer for 15 minutes to try and firm them up. They still fell apart a little on the griddle. Next time I'll DEFINITELY make them smaller. But the taste was outstanding. I'll be making my version of these burgers again!!!

Very tasty burger.  Won't use the leanest ground beef as they could get dry.  But the flavor was wonderful.  Made as is.  Make sure the onion is small dice or it could get overwhelming.

I gave it three because my family and I agreed that it did contain too much basil and a pinch too much salt. But as far as that it was fine, but not the bestest.

My first attempt at making my own patties.  I usually buy them ready made.  The flavor was very good despite the fact that I overcooked them a bit.  I also used a 90/10 mix.  80/20 mix would have been better because of the fat content to hold them together.  Needless to say, they were a bit crumbly.  Tasty though.

The recipe was good, however, I would recommend reducing the broiling time.  I enjoy my burgers to be cooked medium rare so I took them out of the oven 2 minutes early.  Unfortunately, I was too late and they were already very well done.

Very tasty!  I didn't even have to use any garnishings (ketchup mustard etc) because the taste was so good.  My husband (a bigger ketchup fan) used ketchup and loved it as well.  Next time though I think I'll use less meat since both of the burgers were pretty massive and very filling (we were full without eating anything else!).  Easy and quick to make as well.

We did not like these. I gave them two stars because they were edible but nobody wanted seconds which is unusual on burger night. My husband requested that I NOT make these again. I agree with reviewer "Jepper", if you decided to try these, make half the first time. As for me, I'll stick to plain old burgers.

Great burgers!  My husband didn't even use any condiments.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  This recipe is very versatile as well. If you are out of teriyaki sauce, you can use barbeque sauce, or stir fry sauce.  Two Thumbs Up!

I also found this to be a great burger, but agree with others who found that cutting back the salt would be better. I don't normally make a recipe twice...but I will definitely use this one again.

We had these last night with the TASTY BUNS recipe by Charlene Kaunert and sided with BAKED FRENCH FRIES by Ashlee and wow what a delight. The burgers are easy to make and are extremely tasty. I couldnt get ground beef in the UK so used Minced and changed the teriyaki sauce for worcester sauce instead. I did put the recipe in the fridge for an hour before frying and WOW !! these will be our cookout favourites this summer :) Topped with a little tomato Kethcup, lettuce and tomato and both my small children ate the lot. A sure sign of a very good recipe.
