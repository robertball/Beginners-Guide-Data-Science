Yum + Me!  These may not make it to the party.  One tip: My salami was sliced a little too thin so that when I spread the creaam cheese on it, it would rip up.  Too prevent this, I just cut open the peppers and stuffed them with cream cheese, then rolled it up with the salami. This also gives you the chance to seed the peppers, if you want, and kept the presentation a little cleaner.

These are great. We didnt roll ours we just folded them in half. Also we chopped the peppers and mixed them with the cream cheese, then just spread on the salami and fold over.

OH. MY. WORD.  We have been eating & loving these for years, but only on the holidays when our Aunt & Uncle would come and bring these.  I was just saying yesterday that I need to get this recipe so we can have them more often!  So simple, but so addicting!

I made a batch with a half block of cream cheese, and 2 banana peppers, chopped, and mixed in, and spread on the salami slices. I thought it was very good. But after 1 or 2, it was getting pretty rich...But, when I tried it on a cracker it was AMAZING! Next time I'm going to chop up the salmi an mix it in too and serve it as a dip with crackers. The slight sweetness from a townhouse cracker balanced it out SO WELL! Try it! As a dip, I'd give 10 stars. But the recipe as is, tasty, but a little rich for me.

Five stars for being so easy you and your friend can make these after having three beers. The guys devoured them like the hadn't eaten in days. You can tweak this one and we all sat around giving ideas of how you can tweak them. Some ideas were chopped pickled jalapenos or scallions instead of the called for peppers. Another was to use the vegetable cream cheese instead of plain.  But they were fantastic just the way they were, use quality salami from the deli. Oh and I made this for the recipe group selection of the week of Oct. 27th.

Made for Recipe Group. Good stuff, I thought they wouldn't be as flavorful without some goodies added into the cream cheese, but with the addition of the banana peppers(they are the same as pepperoncini aren't they?)it was lip-smacking. I did sub in cotto salami, regular salami would have been even better! Thanks for the recipe.

Rave reviews from this Italian gal - a surefire hit! If I have the time, instead of folding it in half I roll it up before securing with the toothpick. Fresh salami from the deli is imperative - I prefer Veneto or Fruilano (similar to Genoa but better, same price). I usually make half the platter hot by substituting the salami with soppressata (though you can use a hot salami like hot Genoa instead). If you're unfamiliar with differences in salami and would like to mix it up, deli counters are more than happy to slice off samples for you to try.

This is a nice change from the usual ham roll-up, I did whip the cream cheese before spreading on the salami.

Much like another recipe I've recently tried that similar to this, I just didn't care for it. The bf, on the other hand, thinks they are the best thing since sliced bread. I'll probably make them again if he requests them.

Normally, my ham rollups are asked for every holiday get-together.  I did make those but also added this recipe and, boy, were they a hit.  And so easy, too! I used 20 slices of Genoa Salami and will double that next time.  Hmn, maybe I had better triple the recipe! Thanks, Mrs. Bane!

I don't know why I never thought of using pepperoncini in roll-ups but I'm so glad Mrs Bane did. I don't normally eat salami but we all enjoyed these. I used genoa salami, lower fat cream cheese, and a whole pepper for each roll-up. I don't think 1-3 slices would have been enough unless it meant to slice a pepper into three pieces. I tried them sliced in strips and diced and think I like the diced better. I put them in the freezer for a bit to firm them up and make them easier to cut into bite size pieces. I made these for recipe group 11/2/12.

What a great way to use up a little cream cheese!  We happened to have salami in the house this week, and we always have pepperoncini on hand, so then I remembered this little appy!  It made us very happy!  Thank you, Mrs Bane!

These are delicious! Unlike the picture on the recipe page, I used thinner sliced salami that I folded cannolli like over the filling and then put a toothpick through the top. I also chopped the Pepperoncini, amount to your taste, into the room temperature cream cheese.  Next time I'm going to also use some chopped Jalapenos slices on some of them for the people who like more heat. I'm also thinking of maybe using Soprasata slices, topped with some piped cream cheese and a slice of Pepperoncini or Jalapeno on it. Did I mention these were delicious? If you like the ingredients, you've got to try this. It's also so easy!

A bit time consuming for such a simple recipe but I did chop the peppers for an even distribution. These were a big hit, enjoyed by all guests today! Made for Recipe Group a week later than I was supposed to :)

I love the taste of this combination, but, devised a way to make them easier to make and eat. Chop desired amount of the peppers, and mix into the cream cheese, using a little bit of the brine to make it easy to spread. spread on surface of salami, and roll. Same great taste, but, easier to eat!

Recipe Group Selection:  28, October 2012 ~ This has been in my recipe box for over a year waiting to be made.  I didn't have time to get it made the week of the RG pick.  Glad I finally decided to make them.  These were a huge hit to the shower I took them to.  My DH was eating them as fast as I was making them!  I like that this is so simple and quick to put together and the taste is delicious too!

I made these as an appetizer for a Christmas party last weekend.  Personally, I won't make these again because I found them to be labor intensive.  Maybe it was the salami I purchased, but the salami was pre-sliced & packaged, therefore, kind of wet.  I had to rinse & pat-dry each salami so the cream cheese wouldn't slide off while trying to smooth it on.  The flavor was good and those who tried them did rave about them.

I made this recipe for an "end of the world party" last night.  Fortunately the world didn't end, but these appetizers didn't survive!  They went quick.  People loved 'em.  I made some exactly as the recipe was written.  And I made some with a few changes.  Very versatile recipe.  Thanks!

I guess I was imagining that somehow these flavors would magically combine to get a rating fitting of what I’ve seen.  Nope. Tastes like salami with pepperoncini and cream cheese. Nothing special and not even very good.

These were good. I still prefer the ham and flavored cream cheese with a pickle roll up but these were a nice change.  Good appetizer for Italian night!  Easy to make.

Great flavor combination. I used whipped cream cheese and added some horseradish to half of the salami rolls. Everyone ate them up and no leftovers.

I personally did not like these, however everyone else raved about them so I will give them 5 stars. They are super easy to make too so that's always a plus!

A little putsy trying to keep together.  They weren't as popular as the pickle roll ups.  I won't make again.

I followed someone else's advice and chopped up the pepperoncini, mixed it in with the cream cheese and spread it on the salami.   Make sure you get some of the cream cheese mixture to the edges of the salami.  That way when you roll them up, they will adhere and you won't need a toothpick. They were delicious.

I loved it, and my church group loved it. A dab of cream cheese on a slice of salami, topped with sliced pepperoncini from a jar, and held together by a toothpick. It goes together so quickly, you can make enough for a crowd in a few minutes. It's keto and low carb! What's not to love?

3.15.18  Been making these roll-ups for years, they’re always well received.   If somebody drops by unexpectedly, it’s a quick appy along with some mixed olives (and maybe a pickled egg if you have one on hand) to enjoy with a glass of wine.

Lost one star because these are NOT health in any way shape or form. That said, they sure taste good and are a hit every time I serve them. I have used salami or pepperoni and these are great for using up the pepperoncini peppers you get in those spicy olive mixes. So tasty!!

These were great. I usually make the ham/pickle/cream cheese rolls (always a hit), but wanted to add variation to it...made these for the other half of the tray and everyone loved them. (And they are quicker to make than the ham variation, extra bonus). For anyone out there making for the first time, get the large jar of pepperoncinis, you will need it. Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely love these. I made these for Christmas and took them to my moms. My family absolutely loved them! My brother who is anti veggie anything also loved them.  I just finished making a batch for the NYE party that we are going to tonight. 

I did switch up the recipe. I used the jarred pepperoncinis and just laid them out on a paper towel to get the excess juice off of them, onion and chive cream cheese - and after folding them in half - I folded them again and stuck a tooth pick through them. This made the perfect for putting on a cracker!

This is a delicious appetizer, and a bit different than folks are accustomed to having. I altered only the delivery method, and did not measure the salami or peppers. I finely chopped them both, then mixed them into the cheese until the ratio looked right. Served with crackers and a cheese spreader. WAY faster, it went further, and everyone loved it.

These were a hit at my party.  I did chop the pepperoncini into smaller pieces to make it a littler easier to eat.  I might try a flavored cream cheese (chive or vegetable) next time but we all really like this and it was easy to put together.

These were a tasty little appetizer, and so quick and easy to make. I used a pre-sliced salami this time, but next time I will get it from the deli and have them slice it a little thicker, or slice it myself.

An easy man pleaser.  There are plenty of appetizers out there, but this is inexpensive, quick to put together and versatile recipe as you can use hot peppers to kick it up, or a good dill pickle to bring it down where even the kids will eat it.

Really easy and every time I make these little rolls, I think "what a great taste!".  It's got the spark of the pepperoncini  (or banana peppers) but the smooth creaminess of the cream cheese.

I made this for Christmas day appetizers.  It is delicious!! Was completly eaten by my guests.  I already had everything on hand, so I ended up using onion and chive whipped cream cheese.  Worked great.  Thank you for a gluten free, low carb appetizer.

I found the cream cheese was too bland, and so did the girlfriends I made it for. I'm thinking goat cheese would have added some nice flavor. Or maybe chive cream cheese.

I did not have the peppers so I just used lettuce instead. Also did not have toothpicks so I just rolled it in half. Still turned out delicious and addicting.

I have a similar recipe that calls for all except the pepperocinis.
Only difference is I roll them up in flour tortillas. I make them every year for our after church program refreshments. They go like hotcakes. I read this recipe and thought adding the pepperocinis will make them go even faster. Thanks! Denise M

I love the pepperoncini addition...yummy! Although, I did use the smaller salami (thats all we had), folded in half and secured it with a toothpick. Also, whip your cream cheese for an easy spread.

Made this for Recipe Group...YUM! I used whipped cream cheese, so mine weren't as pretty as they could have been, but it didn't matter b/c they were just for us and they were still delicious! I did chop up my peppers for more even distribution, but that was my only change. I would, and will definitely make these for a party or just to snack on, lol! Thanks for sharing. :)

I'm amazed.  I made an entire plate of these (1 and a half X the recipe) and they were gone within the 1st half hour of our get together.  I chopped up the pepperocini and mixed it into the cream cheese (light).  So easy.  No one could believe there were  only 2 ingredients in the salami.

These are pretty good, similar to something my husband said his grandma made when he was younger.  What she did was have another layer of cream cheese and also flour tortilla, then slice into coins and serve on their sides as pinwheels.  I can see how her slight addition would really push these over the edge!  Yum! Made for Western Region Allstars Faceless Frenzy July 2012
