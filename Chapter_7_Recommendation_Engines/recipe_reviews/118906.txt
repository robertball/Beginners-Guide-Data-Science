This was very good with apples, as well as, gingersnaps.  My kids loved it!

Very good!  Was a big hit!  Changed a couple of things.  (Can't leave anything alone.)  Increased pumpkin pie spice mix to 1 1 2/ tablespoons, and added 1/2 can of pumpkin. Got several requests for the recipe.  Thank you!

After reading reviews I increased the cinnamon and pie spice "to taste".  I also added some "Waler's Vanilla Rum" and ZOWIE!  IT SINGS!!!  I used "Mother's Gingerbread Men" for the ginger snaps.  Cute!

This dip was awesome.  I took it to work for a Halloween potluck. I used spice cookies instead of ginger snaps. I followed the recipe using low fat cream cheese and low fat cool whip. No one could tell that this was a low fat dessert.  While packing it up, I was even stopped in the hallway and asked for more.  Even the men that I work with were asking for the recipe (which is a rare thing where I work) Thanks so much, this is going to be a staple in my potluck recipe box.

Delicious and very unique. Served at my Christmas dinner party. My guest were dipping their chocolate chip cookies in this as well as gingersnaps! I thought it needed 3 tsp. of pumpkin spice.

This was good!  It was a great seasonal treat and very easy to prepare.  Just the right amount of sweetness.

I used "free" topping, reduced fat cream cheese and half the amount of confectioners sugar called for. This would be an excellent topping for spice cake as a quick dessert or filling between layers of angel food cake. We dipped sliced apples in this and loved it.

It was good; I liked it but I had a TON left over from our Halloween party.  Maybe it was just too sweet...I'll definitely make it again but maybe cut the recipe in half.

Great recipe - I served with Gingernut biscuits which looked liek the ginger snaps in the photo. Served at work morning tea and everyone loved it and most asked for the recipe. Really has to be bad for you it tastes so good. Not planning to make often as it is highly addictive. We don't have pumpkin pie spice here so I just added some cinnamon , ginger, ground cloves and cumin.

Three & a half stars.  I enjoyed this, but no one else seemed to.  Maybe it was because the store bought Gingersnaps I bought could kill people (so hard and horrible).  Will try this one more time, but only serve with homemade Gingersnaps...

This compliments the gingersnap perfectly, in my opinion. It's sweet, but not too sweet and seems to tame the taste of the cookie. Thanks!

This was an ok dip.  It resembled cream cheese frosting, rich and with the same consistency.  Carrot cake may be a better companion for this recipe.  As for the gingersnaps, I love them but, I'm not so sure about this pair.  It was way too sweet for my pallet.  I'm sorry but, I don't think I'll be making this one again.

I made this dip to go with homemade ginersnap cookies for a baby shower.  This dip was the hit of the party.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I made it just as stated.  Delicious.

Great, quick dessert!  I added mini Chocolate chips to mine.  Also tastes good with Skooby Bones Graham Crackers, and Nilla Wafers.

There's no reason this shouldn't have 5 stars. This recipe is like a light and fluffy pumpkin-flavored cheesecake (without any pumpkin). I used lower calorie ingredients with great success here. The only thing I'd change next time is 3/4 cup sugar rather than a full cup, but that's probably just my taste, I like things a little less sweet. This dip could be made with sugar free ingredients and still be delicious. Thanks for the recipe, I'm sorry this has been languishing untried in my recipe box for so many years!

My husband was helping me prepare Thanksgiving dinner and I asked him to make this. He is a good cook but never uses recipes so it was a first for him and it turned out great. I would have added another tsp of spices but since it was his first attempt to follow a recipe I didn't want to mess him up. :)


This was fairly well received but I think I liked it more than other people. Part of it may have been the store bought gingersnaps though. The dip was good but the cookies are so hard and the ginger was overwhelming the dip that a lot of people wouldn't eat them. I will make this again but make sure I have apples and a milder, softer ginger cookie.


I like the idea of adding pumpkin to it and will try that. I think that is what will make this a perfect holiday dip.

Awesome Dip! I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe, but try it with Big Soft Ginger Cookies instead of gingersnaps.

Great recipe! I made some small changes like the other reviewers, to up the flavor. I used 3/4 can of pumpkin, a pinch more pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon. I used Nabisco Ginger Snaps, and they were perfect. Not too soft, but not too hard. Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving. My mother is asking me to bring it for Christmas! ;]

I would say this probably deserved another half of star. It was good, but nothing that blew me away. I really don't see me making it again.

I doubled the recipe for a class. I made this dip at first without the coolwhip. It was delicious. I then folded in the coolwhip and it seemed to be too light for my tastes so as other people had suggested I added a can of pumpkin to the dip. I then filled a plastic pumpkin, even double the dip it only filled it halfway. The dip was delicious however the store bought gingersnaps were horrible. I sliced some apples to accompany it though. Next time I'll make my own gingersnaps.

This dip was OK but not something I would fix again. It just did not have a lot of flavor and we didn't really like it on the cookies.

I made this last weekend and served it with gingersnap graham crackers.  Everyone loved it!  Although I did cut the spices in half it was really good. This is one of my new favorites.  I will definately make again!

Something different. Not my favorite, but I would make it again to offer a variety on my buffet table.
