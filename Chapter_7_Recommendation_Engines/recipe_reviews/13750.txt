I love this recipe.  Have been making it for years with just a few changes.  First, I leave the butter out.  I always found there to be enough fat in the cheese.  Plus, I use cream of chicken soup rather than cream of celery and don't add the hot sauce.  I agree with a previous reviewer and only add the cracker crumbs the last 5-10 minutes of cooking.  I have never had anything but rave reviews for this casserole and I even will eat left overs by themself for lunch the next day.  A must for any BBQ!

For several years, I've been taking THIS version of the popular recipe to every event. Everyone always raves about these and says they're the best they've ever had. They're creamier and more flavorful because of the additional can of soup. Don't be afraid of the hot sauce - it doesn't make the potatoes spicy, it just punches up the flavor. If you are hesitant, just use less. There are a lot of hash brown casserole recipes out there, but THIS is the one to use!!!

I used this recipe to replace a hashbrown casserole recipe that I had lost, and I prefer this one.  I used the Bob Evans brand hashbrown and I thought that added extra spice which was good. I also added some paprika for color and spice.  I used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of celery. Although these took a while, they came out really tasty, I made them ahead of time and they heated up well.  The only other change I would make is to add more cheese, cut in half the amount of crackers for the topping bc I thought there was too much topping, and cut the bake time w. the topping back to 20 minutes.  Thank heavens I checked mine 20 mins in or I would've had a burnt ritz cracker crust.  A nice Sunday side dish.

This was a great starter recipe. I’m no morning person, so night before or not I don’t fuss with breakfast stuff much. But hash browns are, after all, just potatoes and I think a grand foundation for a supper casserole as well.  I used 1 can cream of celery and 1 can cream of mushroom. I had a little cheddar, but I also threw in some Mexican blend cheese and a good dose of Velveeta cubed. I also made this to use up leftover ham, about 2 cups cubed. I tossed in about 1 ½ cups of frozen green peas for more color and a supper green veggie. I used 2 Tbsp. Franks hot sauce ‘cause I love the stuff, mainly because it’s hot but not too firey hot. Because it was supper I skipped the cracker topping and used the ultimate (but pricey) king of all casserole toppings, French fried onion rings. Generously dot with butter and it’s divine. Not low cal but delish.

SO SO SO GOOD!  I used one can cream of celery and one can cream of potato, like another user suggested, and the O'Brien potatoes.  I will definitely be making this again!  One suggestion- Wherever I add pepper, I tend to also add salt.  Don't do this!  The two soups make the dish salty enough-- it doesn't need any extra.

I love this recipe!!  I make it every year for our office Christmas party and I alway get requests for the recipe.  Last time I used crushed potato chips for the topping, and sometimes I add diced ham to make it a main dish. *Laura*

I love this casserole! My mom used to make it all the time and I loved it! My mom also used to put ham in it sometimes for a main dish and the recipe she had, didn't have any tabasco sauce in it. I'm happy I found the recipe!!

I enjoy this one every year.  It's a little on the creamy side, I could probably cut down on the sour cream or cream soups, however the flavor is wonderful.  My family enjoys this one along with scrambled eggs and bacon on Christmas morning.  Easy to make ahead and just put in the oven when you're ready to bake.

This is a great, easy recipe. We altered a few things (didn't use cracker topping or add the hot sauce, and used spinach dip instead of sour cream)- it still turned out great! Will definetly make again!

this was really good and easy to make. i mixed things together in a bowl before baking as suggested,left out hot sauce,added 2oz jar of pimentos for color,doubled the pepper,added 2t.salt and substituted 1 can cream of chicken soup(what i had on hand). like being able to do that with recipes and still have them taste good! it was a hit...planned on having some leftovers for tomorrow... minimal leftovers...so much for my plans!

I have been making this for years and it is my husbands favorite dish!!  I leave out the hot pepper sauce, butter and round crakers.  I add 1/2 red onion, only 1 can of cream of chicken soup (however at the holidays I use cream of celery since some family cannot have chicken).  I also use 4 cups of shreded cheese and leave some to sprinkle on top.  It is a hit at any function I take it too.  The biggest differance for taste is to make it a day ahead of time then reheat the day it is serverd.  It gets happy resting overnight.  Some foods are just better the next day.  I also have served the leftovers for breakfast the next day... if there is any left.  If you double the batch make sure you make 1 then make the next.  It turns out better if you don't just combine double ingredients at once plus it is easier to stir at one time.

I used cream of chicken soup since I did not have cream of celery.  I took this to a family Easter celebration and everyone loved it!  The hot sauce adds just enough kick.  My family has already requested that I make this again.

5-star recipe.  I've tried many recipes over the years for different things.  This one delivers exactly what is promised:  a delicious hash brown casserole.    I didn't have crackers on hand, so I put cheese on top.  I think some crumbled bacon and/or chopped green onions on top (for decoration) would render a stuffed-potato type casserole.  I will try that next time as our family loves stuffed potatos.  The recipe given was spot-on.    Thank you, Diane. :)

I followed instructions, and casserole was fine. However, it was a bit bland. Maybe next time I'll add more hot sauce or a dash of Worcheshire sauce.

This was pretty good.  I think it would of been better without the sour cream.  I also doubled the amount of cheese in the recipe and added chopped chicken breast to make a main dish.  Instead of using real butter  I used I Can't believe It's Not Butter for the topping.  I noticed some of the recipes suggested to substitute a can of cream of chicken soup for the cream of celery so I think I might try that also. I followed the recipe exactly on everything else and my family enjoyed it.  Will make again but with these alterations.

Fantastic dish Diane!! I made this for my ever lovin' future SIL as he is my potato freak. We were in Wildwood Crest, NJ for vacation and with all the seafood we were eating my hubby was happy to change the menu up with some smoked ribs and this potato casserole. The only change I made was topping the casserole with buttered bread crumbs instead of the crackers. This was great and thank you!!

Delicious!  I had to substitute milk with a little vinegar for the sour cream, and I used one can of cream of chicken and one of cream of celery.  It was very tasty.

My friends and family love this! I used tator tots instead and you can't even tell it's tator tots. I added a bell pepper which was chopped. And if you don't have the crackers, just top it off with more cheese, yummy!

I just love this. So good and comforting. I used shredded hash browns, and by mistake used double the amount of cheddar (medium) because I halved the recipe and didn't change that, but loved it with that much cheese. Also used corn flakes instead of buttery crackers and don't melt the butter and cornflakes together, just dribble the butter over the whole thing. Great consistency, not too dry or moist, just right. Definitely the hot sauce is a plus, you can't taste it as itself so don't worry. I use Frank's Red Hot Sauce. My sister has a version of this using Cream of Onion soup, but we don't have that here, and I really like the Celery Soup in it.

My husband LOVES this dish, and its so simple! I follow the recipe almost exactly, though I use cream of chicken with the celery for more flavor. I sub the hot sauce with the green jalopeno sauce. DELICIOUS, without the burn!!  I find it unnecessary to defrost the hashbrowns, I usually forget anyway. I've made this many times, thinking about making this dish with Potato O'Brien. DO try this dish!

I had a delicious hash brown casserole at a buffet and was hoping to recreate it at home. This recipe nailed it!!! It's so unbelievably creamy! I halved the recipe, omitted the cracker topping, and served it on top of some leftover taco beef - my fiance and I gobbled all of it back in one sitting and regretted not making more! If you are a cheese addict like myself, try using a can of cheddar soup instead of celery - so good!!

Served this for Easter breakfast.  Everyone liked it.  I used Ritz crackers instead of the buttery round crackers.  Will be making this again.

Great recipe, the hot sauce really adds to the flavor!  I was short on time so I baked it for 50 minutes at 350 and then another 20 minutes at 400.  Turned out perfect!

I make this every year for Easter, however last year I didn't have potato chips or the "buttery" crackers for the top. Since I make mine with SHARP cheddar cheese. I used up the "cheesy square crackers" crushed and I will do it from now on. Oh and I use one can of soup.

I made this for our Mother's Day grill yesterday and everyone raved about how great they were.  I didn't have 2 cans of cr of celeray soup so used one can cream of celery and one can cream of chicken...fabulous and my 2 year old grandson ate and ate.  It was all gone before anything else.  Daughter-in-laws requested the recipe.  Will make this often.

I fixed this for a family gathering and everyone loved it.  The touch of hot pepper sauce gave it just the right amount of zing without being overwhelming

These were okay.  Pretty rich and high calorie though.  Wouldn't make very often.  I followed recipe except used the french fried onions on top.  Those were good!

This is a really good and easy basic recipe. I cut it in half and put it in an 8 by 8 in. pan. I also used bread crumbs on top instead of the crackers; I just mixed the crumbs with melted butter and sprinkled on top. I also used cream of mushroom soup--I imagine you could use "cream of any kind" of soup. This recipe could be dressed up to include bits of ham and/or chicken, mushrooms, peppers, or other vegetables. No need to thaw the hash browns before using them. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it really cried out for some salt and pepper.

I made this for Fathers Day breakfast and it passed the test with flying colors. I used the "southern" style hashbrowns and put my own twist on it knowing what my husband and adult sons would like. I used only one can of cream of celery soup, added one can of cream of mushroom, 1 can of sliced mushrooms, 1 tsp. red pepper flakes, 1 large chopped jalapeno and 2 cloves of minced garlic. I omited the butter and just put a sprinkle of crushed Ritz crackers on top to brown the last 15 minutes. Leftovers were even better today at lunch! Thanks for a new family favorite!!

This is the same recipe that I have been making for 30 years but without the hot sauce. That sounds like a good idea. This dish is always a winner at any time.

This recipe was so good and so easy, just the right amount of hot sauce.  The things I changed were the soup, I used Cream of Corn Soup because that was the only one I could find without wheat in the ingredients, I also used margarine instead of butter, and I changed the crackers to corn chips.   Thanks so much.

I didn't add the hot sauce or the creme of celery.  I added creme of chicken instead.  Also on top of the casserole, I added cheddar cheese before baking.

I changed a few things about this recipe to make it a full meal. I browned some lean hamburger meat, with a half bag of birdseye pepper stir fry(tri color peppers and onions)followed the rest of the recipe except the topping, I used french fried onions, added the last 10 minutes of cooking! It was terrific and actually made enough for two meals, we ate Friday night, then had the rest for lunch on Saturday!

This recipe is ok, but I feel it has too much sour cream. Neither my husband nor I cared for the sour cream taste. If I make this again, I'll decrease the sour cream to 1/2 pint.

I had half a bag of hash browns doing nothing in the freezer, and thought I'd try this recipe just to use them up. Hash browns aren't my thing, and Husband isn't overly keen on them either, but we thought this wasn't bad at all. I used a little more cheese, and also added some garlic powder. Pretty decent. Thanks, Diane!

I did everything like I was supposed to, except I added a diced ham slice to it.  It seemed to be lacking something or maybe just too mushy...not sure which.  Sorry Diane, I won't be making this again.

I just made this as an accompaniment to a ham dinner and everyone raved!  Delicious and easy, but not low fat.  I used diced hash brown potatoes and substituted cream of chicken soup for cream of celery.  This is delicious and tastes you like you slaved away in the kitchen!

This is so easy, and it turned out great!  I substituted onion powder for the chopped onions (hubby doesn't like the texture of them), and crushed up some italian-seasoned croutons as a substitute for the crackers.  I also added 1.5lb. lean ground beef (pre-cooked).  Big hit - no leftovers!  This one goes in my recipie book.

I thought the cooking time was too long on this recipe.  The crackers got too brown on the second go around and the original 50 minutes made the potatoes dry.  I think it should be 30 minutes and 5-10 minutes.

A great make ahead potato dish. I mixed the day before and baked later. 
I used one can of cheddar cheese soup and one can of the cream of celery. Next time I would like to try the Nacho Cheese soup for added zip.
I put most of this into a large dish and decided to experiment with the 1/4 or so left. I added lots of Hormel Real Bacon Pieces, a bit of extra sharp cheddar cheese and some chopped green onions. It tasted like a cross between potato skins and baked potatoes all the way. We preferred these over the other...although they were both really good.

I love this recipe.  I made few minor changes, and it was the most delicious potato casserole I have ever tried! I brought it to a morning meeting potluck, and everyone loved it. I followed the ingredients exactly, except I followed the other reviews, and used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of celery. and I chopped up half a red onion.  Now for my own additions. Yes, I realize this is loaded with calories, but I HAD to try this, and I'm glad I did! I baked the casserole for 50 minutes, and removed it from the oven. I melted cheese whiz, and dribbled it on top of the casserole prior to adding the crackers. I fried up some bacon, and crumbled that to add with the cracker topping! The topping crackers combined with bacon was perfect! Delicious!! :)

Very disappointed. It looked and smelled geat but tasted horrible. I brought it to a cook-out, everyone said it was good but "different". Less than half was eaten from a crowd of 16. The hot sauce was over-powering and it was not nearly cheesy enough. I followed the directions exactly.

i omitted the onion and hot pepper sauce, added minced onion, pamrsean and herb seasoning and used cream of mushroom soup. this turned out pretty good, i think i used too much sour cream( i never measure, lol) but i would make this again. my bf LOVED all the cheese on top.

I would give this five stars but hubby and my mother didn't think it was as good as I did.  I  only used one can of cream of celery and didn't use any crackers on top, I sprinkled cheese instead.  I have to say it was even better the next day!

This was a tasty recipe. Someone below mentioned cutting the butter out of the recipe, so I assumed it was actually in the potatoes.  Looking at the recipe again, I realized that the butter is for the cracker topping - not to go in the casserole. I may have been the only dummy that thought this, but thought I would pass on the info.  Also, I tried to make this a little healthier with fat-free cream of celery soup, lite sour cream, and 2% cheese.  It tasted just like all the other hashbrown casseroles I have had, so why not save yourself a few calories?

I did not care for this recipe as much as others on here. I miss my regular recipe which calls for melted butter and more shredded cheese. Thanks.

Turned out great! I used cream of chicken soup instead of the celery, and it worked great. I also added a couple minced garlic cloves just for a little bite. Loved it! Very tasty.

I put a little bit too much butter in this one and the result was a bit greasy. Flavor was good though. I didn't have enough sour cream so I halved with some cream cheese.

These are terrific! I did leave out the hot sauce (personal preference) but everyone loved it and demanded that I keep this and make it often.  What a success!

Great recipe that's easy to make and with ingredients I usually have on hand. The only change I made was to omit the hot pepper sauce for the children's sake but did sprinkle a little on top my own serving. I found the cooking times to be correct if put in the size baking dish called for. The crumbs on top might get too brown if you cook it in the top half of your oven so take a peek after 15-20 minutes. It even could be mixed up the night before then baked in the morning. Add a stack of pancakes and some crisp bacon strips and you've got a meal fit for overnight guests.

Today I cooked this delightfully rich dish for 7 painters at our church.  I thought there would be leftovers - they ate the whole dish.  I added frozen Italian beans to this dish, otherwise I went strictly by the ingredients.  Thank you Diane!

I made this as written, it was really good but a little dry. The next time I make it I would add maybe 1/4 cup milk. I also would mix everything but the hashbrowns together first so it incorporates better, but that's just to make it easier. This one is a keeper and definitely will make again.

I made this just as the recipe called for.  They only thing I might tweak is the amount of hot sauce. I would definItely leave it in, just use a little less. Very delicious though! Oh, and I also used a can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of celery. This will be my go to recipe for a hash brown casserole now!!!  YUMMY.

This was pretty good, but a little bland.  I didn't have the cream soup suggested, so I used Cream of chicken soup and light shredded cheese.  I used close to 1.5 tbsp. of hot sauce in hopes of getting some flavor and did cut the butter down to 1 tbsp.  It seems like it needs something to kick up the flavor.

Favorite potato casserole ever! I add bacon bits and green onions sometimes too. I live in the land of "funeral potatoes", but we call these "celebration potatoes"!
