I made this for my family at Thanksgiving.  It was good, but I found that about 3/4 cup of both sugars was better as the 1/2 cup was quite tart.  Will use again for Christmas!

This is so simple to make.  I used OJ instead of water, as suggested by others, but cut the amount by 1/4 c.  Also threw in a handful of dried cherries and a chopped apple.  Yum!

This is the BEST cranberry sauce I've ever had! It was recommended by a friend who made it on Thanksgiving- she said it was the best she ever had too!

I made a from-scratch Christmas dinner, and used this recipe.  It was a complete hit, and all my guests thought I slaved over it.  It was so tasty and so easy, I'm now adding it to my recipe box for next Christmas.  Thanks!

Very easy to make and turns out yummy!  I used a strainer and mashed the berries to make jellied cranberry sauce.  It was very tart, as cranberries are.

AWESOME & perfect homemade recipe. Try adding some pumpkin pie spice to the mixture (cinnamon, clove, ginger & nutmeg), tastes great!

This had a really good flavor, but was way to runny. I would take out at least a cup of water if I made it again!

This was very easy and good!  I used 3/4 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown.  I think I will use more white and less brown next time, but still very good!  I will also use OJ next time, but none in the house at the moment.  Will make again!

A good recipe...  I liked the twist of brown sugar but still substituted orange juice for the water and had to make the sugars 3/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup to decrease the tartness.  Will make again tho...

This recipe is great!  My first attempt at cranberry sauce and I am so pleased.  I also changed a few things, however...
1. Used 1/2 C. freshly squeezed OJ for 1/2 C of the water
2. Added the zest from one orange (the orange I used to squeeze the OJ)
3. Cooked longer than the 5 minutes recommended, about 10 min, for all the berries to "pop" and make it a little saucier and less chunky.
These changes gave me a sweet, not too sweet, orange infused cranberry sauce that I will happily refer to from this Thanksgiving on!  Thank you for this recipe!  :)

The combination of brown and white sugar is interesting but not that impressive.  I would halve the amount of water in this recipe.  Maybe that is why it is called, "Washed Cranberry Sauce"   A little too thin for our taste.

I do not eat cranberry sauce so I am going with my husband's rating...this recipe is slightly different from what I usually make and he prefers the old one. He & the other guests said it was ok, but a little too tart.

I am making this right now.  The brown sugar makes all the difference in the world.  Easy, tastes great, gets raves from all.  I'll never buynthe canned stuff again.

Overall a good recipe. I agree with the fact that you need to add more sugar to the recipe. I also did 2 parts OJ and 1 part water.  Tastes good to me.
