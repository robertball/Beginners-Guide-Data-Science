I've been doing this for years using fresh veggies, but I always forget to look at the time when I put them on the grill. My solution is simple. Take any color or clear nail polish and put an x (or if doing individual serving use an initial). When the nail polish turns black it's done.

I halved this recipe, used diced red potatoes, vidalia onions,  frozen corn and peas, used EVOO in place of butter.  Since we grilled this packet on a charcoal fire I triple wrapped the foil, made sure all the veggies were flat in the foil and not heaped up and made sure to dice the potatoes very small. Will definitely make this again this summer and add fresh herbs next time.

This is a great snack during the day. I used 4 red potatoes instead of larger because I prefer less starch. I added frozen corn, peas, and crinkle-cut carrots and used a drizzle of olive oil (just enough to lightly coat) instead of butter and cooked for 30 minutes in a 350 degree oven. So good!

This also works well with canned sliced potatoes.  It cuts the cooking time in half. If using the bbq, make sure to turn the packets over occasionally to prevent burning.

I tried it in the oven and it took 30 minutes longer than the recipe said to cook the potatoes.

I do this all the time but omit the butter and use olive oil instead. I also had tablespoons of uncooked hamburg and a variety of veggies and peppers. It's a quick, delicious, no mess meal. Highly recommend it!

The grill really added a delicious charcoal taste to this, and the butter completes the flavor & texture. Will make again! No changes made to recipe.

Yummy!! I used a can of mixed vegetables (which already had potatoes & onions in it). Put a few globs of butter on it, sealed up my tin foil packet, and baked in the oven at 350F for 20 minutes. I took it out half way through and gave it a little shake. Turned out fantastic!!! I ate all my veggies before I even touched the rest of my meal! Looking forward to this making regular appearances at mealtimes.

Was fine, and may make again because it was handy
to prepare ahead and through in when I get home.
But, plain really just peas and corn
