Good but a little runny as is.  Therefore, I added another can of chili, used the full 8oz cream cheese and chives and taco blend shredded cheese (totaling 1 1/2cups).  This resulted in a cheesy, thick and easy-to-scoop dip.  Guests enjoyed and almost cleaned the bowl.  Great with tortilla chips.  Best part? The appetizer took me 15 minutes from start to finish.  Thanks!!

This was amazing. I left out the cream cheese with chives and added a couple of tablespoons of taco seasoning.  This will definitely become a regular on our list of dips. I don't think I'll buy the cheese dip stuff anymore.  Thanks for sharing!

The only change I've made to this recipe is to add the whole tub of chive cream cheese.  I've been making this for years, and everyone loves it!  I serve it with reduced fat Triscuits, for a different twist.

this was surprisingly good. I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I'm not a big fan of canned chili so i got a large order of chili from Wendy's (which was good since I didn't have to wait for the chili to warm up), I used only chive onion cream cheese since that was all i had, and i only had (real) parmesan cheese so i put some of that in the dip but not as much as the recipe called for. I also added some garlic powder, cayenne, paprika, cumin and chili powder. It came out very yummy!

My friends loved this at the Super Bowl! Brought the leftovers into work and the bowl was licked clean! I made a double batch and added a whole, fresh jalapeno. Only gave it 4 stars because of the high sodium content. Tasted great though!

This recipe is similar to the standard go to recipe that appears at many parties but...this was way to much cream cheese for just one can of chili.

I found this recipe because I needed a way to use up light  cream cheese.  I used 12 oz. of light cream cheese and a 15 oz of Hormel turkey chili + 1/2 c. regular cheddar cheese and baked it in the oven with the chicken wings.  As a "lighter" version it was quite tastey.  I would have added chives and taco seasoning if I had it to give it a little more zip.  If you happen to have leftovers it makes a great topping for baked potatoes too.

Everyone devoured the dip. Only change I made was I heated in a pie plate in the oven stirring a few times so I didn't have to keep watching it during the party. I garnished with sliced scallions.

I've been making a variation of this recipe for years - 1 block cream cheese, 1 can of chili, and 1 can of corn. Microwave 'em all together - the sweetness of the corn just adds to the yummy creaminess of the chili & cream cheese.

I made it just as the recipe dictated, except our little store didn’t have cream cheese with chives, so I made it with all plain cream cheese. I took it to a party, and it was gone fast. Very tasty, and very easy!

So easy and so good!  I've always been of the opinion that you can put anything with cream cheese and it will be delish.  That's true here.  I mix with electric mixer (to break up the beans more) in a microwave safe bowl, then nuke it a bit. If you don't have the cream cheese with chives you can use regular, and also add more cheddar if you want to.  I think proportions aren't too important -- just go with the basics and it will be a hit!

Although I haven't tasted this particular recipe, I used to make  the original recipe for many  parties.  I used hamburger as the base and after being cooked and drained, added grated jack cheese with jalapeños, and medium cheddar, and a small can of salse.

It was great - we just wanted something quick, nothing fancy. This fit the bill PERFECTLY. The only change I made was putting some chopped cilantro on top. Great stuff. I give it four stars b/c for the effort put in, it was delicious!
