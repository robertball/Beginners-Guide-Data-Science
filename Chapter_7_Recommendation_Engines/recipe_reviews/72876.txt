Light, refreshing and perfect for a summer salad....  The citrus vinaigrette was a nice touch - will definitely make again.  Update - made this the 2nd time and used walnut oil in place of the vegetable oil.  Using the walnut oil made all the difference, moved this salad from wonderful to outstanding!!!

This salad is to die for! After making it a few times I have found what works best for us. I added a bit less OJ (1/4 cup less, be sure to use fresh squeezed), half the sugar and I use brown not white, and added half a clove of crushed garlic to give it a kick. Added  some salt and a bit more Dijon (1TBS) as well. I also used mandarin oranges in a pinch they will work as well. Sometimes I use pecans and chevre cheese in place of walnuts and gorgonzola. Both are excellent. Heaven.

The best part of this recipe is the dressing.  The salad ingredients can be modified to suit one's taste.  I was looking for an arugula salad recipe that tasted like a salad I had at a local restaurant.  With a few substitutes in toppings, this salad was very similar in flavor, but a lot less expensive than the restaurant version.  I like to sometimes use sliced fresh pears instead of oranges, omit the onions, use glazed pecans instead of walnuts, and use goat cheese instead of the Gorgonzola.  However, I use the dressing as is.  Excellent!

This salad is very good (addictive, in fact) with the following changes (some to decrease the amount of sugar): use walnut oil in place of one of the oils, use mandarin oranges instead of navel oranges, no added sugar, less OJ, regular walnut pieces, and bagged spring mix to make it snappy!

I substituted drained mandarin oranges, that had been in juice instead of a light syrup, for the naval oranges (easier & visually pleasing) and Splenda for the sugar.  As I was out of Dijon, I used spicy brown mustard and also omitted the oregano due to family preference.  I think this would be yummy with blue cheese or feta as well.

I made this for Valentine's Day dinner as suggested by the Allrecipes Newsletter. The flavor was unique and interesting. I thought the oranges, red onion and gorgonzola were very tasty together. The dressing turned out well and I do hope to make this again.

Excellent flavor combo! (even forgetting to add the red onion) The dressing is great but quite sweet - I would halve the sugar next time and possibly add a little salt. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this several times and it is always a hit.  I have used splenda, and added feta cheese instead of gorgonzola and it was excellant.  As other reviewers have noted, the salad greens can be changed to suit your preferences.

I liked the basic flavor profile of this recipe - sweet, savory and salty.  I made the dressing according to the directions, but I found it a bland and sweet.  It definitely needed more acid so I added additional balsamic vinegar.  For extra flavor, I upped the amount of mustard and added a couple cloves of pasted garlic (garlic and kosher salt mashed with a pestle).   I liked the final dressing result much better.  I would make this recipe again but with the above modifications plus a possible reduction in the amount of sugar, depending on the sweetness of my orange juice (I used fresh squeezed navel orange juice).

This was an excellent recipe. I changed the salad but made the dressing as is, with the exception that I replaced the sugar with splenda.  Very tasty!

One of my favorite restaurants serves a salad with a citrus dressing that I just love except for the fact that it's too sweet for my tastes. Knowing that going in, I already knew I was going to omit the sugar in this recipe and for me that was a good call.  The orange juice made this plenty sweet enough.  I used a white wine vinegar rather than the heavier, sweeter balsamic, and skipped the orange sections in the salad. Nice, light springtime salad.

I just returned from a church potluck. My salad bowl was already empty and I was near the front of the line! Yep, it was very popular.. A few tips. Since I used a glazed nut(honey roasted almonds)I was wary of the sugar in the dressing, so here is what I did. I made the dressing without sugar, then added sugar tablespoon by tablespoon. I kept dipping a piece of lettuce (spring mix)until I liked the balance of tart and sweet. It was less than 1/4c of sugar.Another thing I noticed. If the vinaigrette dressing wasn't totally shaken just before dressing the salad, you got an oily, boring taste. i.e. it needed to be emulsified or it was dreadful.There must be something in commercial dressings that helps emulsify. I was pleased with the dressing and obviously everyone else loved it as well.

Yummy, light & fresh! I have been making a variation of this salad for years. I used walnuts, gorgonzola, and craisins and just threw together a nice balsamic vinaigrette. But, wow what a nice change! I omitted the red onions and used mandarin oranges just because I was too lazy to peel and section oranges : )

Absolutely fabulous recipe.  I took this to school for a teacher appreciation luncheon, and it's a hit!  The salad dressing is delicious.  I made this recipe exactly as written, but I did substitute store bought glazed walnuts, to save time, and I did juice my own oranges (two large naval oranges) as opposed to store bought OJ.  TIP: Blend the dressing ingredients in a blender, holding back the oils.  Once the other ingredients have been blended, slowly drizzle in the vegetable oils, then the olive oil.  It seems to help with achieving the best consistency.  Oh, and I used a high quality extra virgin olive oil for dressing.

This is a great salad recipe and it makes lots. As another reviewer suggested, I did candy the walnuts slightly, by adding 1 tsp of brown sugar to the skillet when the nuts were being browned. This added a tasty touch to the salad. I tried the recipe with both gorgonzola cheese, and the next time with feta - we preferred the gorgonzola. If you are in a hurry, you can use canned mandarins (drained and rinced) in place of the navel oranges. Extra dressing stores well for a week to ten days in the fridge - just shake very well before using again.

Wow this was great!  Everyone at dinner gobbled it up and kept asking for the recipe.  I followed others advice for all olive oil, and less sugar.  I also added a clove of garlic to the dressing and it was amazing.  I did sub feta cheese for the gorgonzola (not sure if everyone would like the flavor) and used mandarine oranges.  Don't pass this recipe up, it an amazing and very gourmet tasting salad

This is my stand-by salad and make it with canned mandarin oranges and bottled champagne dressing. Pretty standard recipe. Pecans as well as almonds are good nut substitutions.

Tasty! I used mixed salad greens with spinach from Trader Joe's, sliced almonds instead of walnut since that's what I had, used canned, drained mandarin oranges, less red onion but thinly sliced, blue cheese instead of gorgonzo (also what was handy) and made smaller amount of dressing with agave instead of sugar, and added poppy seeds. I forgot the pepper and oregano but it still tasted good. I'll remember next time. This is such a good dressing. Thank you!

Wonderful to look at, and even better to eat. I used mandarin oranges as well simply because I had some on hand. I had lots of dressing left over, and it kept well. Thanks so much for the recipe...this salad has become a regular in our house.

I made 1/2 recipe and still got enough ingredients to make at least 4 large salads. I like the dressing and that it was mild tasting. I put the ingredients in a container with a twist on lid, making that part very easy to mix by shaking. The blue cheese and walnuts were a great addition. I didn't toast the walnuts, because I don't care for them that way, and most nuts are sold roasted anymore anyhow. However, I thought the oranges were horribly out of place. I couldn't eat them with the other ingredients. I also had to cut the amount of onion in half as it was too dominant. Other than that, it tasted fine but seemed like it was missing something? It was kind of boring and the ingredients didn't come together much taste wise. Also, one would definitely have to eat something else with this. It is just too light to be any kind of a meal salad for me.

Loved it. A delicious combination. Was skeptical about the dressing but it ended up being light and not too sweet!

This was delicious! I used mandarin oranges instead of navel oranges and also used dried cranberries. I made the dressing as written and substituted equal amount of splenda for the sugar. I thought that as written the dressing was too sweet, so I had to add more balsamic to take the sweet edge off. I'd add less sugar next time. 
Also, serve the dressing on the side. The dressing makes a lot and it's easy to saturate the salad if you dump it all on.

I thought this was good but not fantastic.  I think it really needed something but I am not sure what  I used feta cheese and mandarin oranges and those flavors together were very good!  Might just try to spice it up a bit next time!

We loved this salad.  I reduced the sugar (the sugar in the orange juice was plenty), and added ground ginger for a little but of Asian flavor.  It was great.

I made this for my sewing club lunch and everyone loved it.  I did leave out the sugar and I used mandarin oranges in a jar, so that was plenty sweet.  I used feta with basil and sundried tomatoes instead of gorgonzola.  My husband love it too and he's very picky.  Great recipe, thanks for submitting.

This is an awesome salad! I had a version of this in a deli recently and it was heavenly. So when I found this, I was delighted. I too, switched some of the salad ingredients around, such as apple instead of orange and added dried cranberries. I made the dressing per the recipe and it was excellent. I will make this one a lot. I have never thanked anyone before for a recipe on this site, but let me say it now!!  Thank you!

This salad is awesome! A friend introduced me to it, now it is a staple at my house- The only change I make is since my husband is diabetic, I use splenda in the dressing instead of sugar and it works just fine!

Nothing else to say but "OUTSTANDING". The vinaigrette is absolutely the best. I love it. I made this twice once with fresh oranges and the next time with madarin can oranges. I like the canned oranges the best and I add some of the juice from the can to the vinaigrette instead of adding sugar.

Made this salad last night and it was nothing short of incredible.  My fiance had 3 servings.  The only thing I did differently was to candy the chopped walnuts in a couple tablespoons of sugar in a skillet over med-low heat.  When the sugar melts, give the nuts a good stir to coat evenly and spread out on a plate to cool.  This made the salad for me.

This WAS AMAZING! and a huge success. I, however, caramelized the walnuts a bit by adding some agave nectar (or you can use honey or some form of liquid sugar). And the walnuts took about 10 minutes to brown just how much I wanted them, instead of the 5 minutes. Otherwise, a huge success!

I made this for a group of friends and they loved it. I used about half the sugar for the dressing and they still thought it was a little too sweet. I like it fairly sweet so just adjust according to your preference.

This recipe was fabulous - one of the best salads we've ever made. We served it with grilled salmon, and the flavors really complemented one another. It was easy to do and tastes like something from an upscale restaurant. I think it would be great with chopped avocado added to the salad or even fresh mushrooms. We will definitely make this one again and again. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I had a dinner party and tried this salad but I changed it up a bit.  I substituted a pear for the orange and added craisons. I also added a little butter to the walnuts while cooking them to add flavor. I didn't change the dressing and everyone loved it.  Highly recommended, this one is a keeper!

Excellent salad!  We will be making this one again and again.  We prefer to go light on the dressing, so I halved the recipe for that and we still ended up with enough for a second salad.  I also used canned mandarin oranges and used the juice from the can in the dressing instead of the OJ.  I omitted the sugar on accident, but we still thought the dressing tasted wonderful so I will leave that out in the future as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent salad! This recipe is a real crowd-pleaser and relatively easy to make. We added mandarin oranges in the salad as a substitute. For the dressing, we also added 1 tablespoon of Worchestshire in the dressing and used really good quality OJ. I could eat this salad everyday.

This is an AWESOME salad! Arugula is a peppery lettuce so I always add fresh cracked black pepper. Fresh Florida oranges in season are the sweetest you can find, so adding sugar to the dressing is unnecessary. I use 1 fresh squeezed in the dressing and 1 peeled and cut into the salad. Red onions add a sweet element, yet if I only have white onions, I add it into the dressing. I've used GOAT cheese as well as the recommended gorgonzola and it totally works. NUT oil makes a world of difference...I've used almond, pistachio and walnut as substitutes. Also, toasting and slightly caramelizing the walnuts with light brown sugar is the BOMB! I substituted the balsamic for rice wine vinegar and fresh thyme for the oregano. Using a blender to emulsify the dressing does the trick. I serve this every year at our annual brunch and everyone LOVES it!

This is an excellent salad dressing.  I agree that decreasing the sugar by 1/2 and using brown sugar instead gives it a much fuller flavor.  I also used 1tbsp of honey dijon mustard and decreased the veggie oil to only 3 tbsp. U can use regular orange juice or freshly squeezed to save some time.  Peel the salad oranges with a sharp knife, they look prettier that way. A new favorite!

The first time I made this I thought it was good, but not outstanding. The second time I made this I added my changes....Instead of OJ, I pureed 2 fresh navel oranges. Not only did I not need to add sugar but we also didn’t consume extra sugar from the OJ (bonus!) I also cut out the vegetable oil and just added a bit more olive oil. Wow, did this make a difference, loved it! I think next time I make this I’ll try using the walnut oil like some others have suggested.

Made this for a 3rd of July party - got rave reviews from everyone and most had 2nd so I made it again for a 4th of July party.   We now have some leftover dressing and am looking forward to making another salad with it for this weekend.   Made a couple of modifications though; I decreased the sugar to 1/8 of a cup, I increased the balsamic vinegar to 2 1/2 Tbsp., I increased the black pepper & the dried oregano to 1/2 tsp. and I substituted 1 1/2 cans of mandarin oranges for the navel oranges.

Loved it.  My husband said I should reduce the red onion in it, but I was happy with it.  Dressing was great and the combination of flavors was wonderful.  I cut the oil in half but left the rest of the dressing ingredients the same.

This made a lovely salad - I used butter lettuce mix and it added a softness that was really enjoyed. I found the dressing a little bland...DEFINITELY needed salt and it seemed to need a touch more acid too despite the OJ and vinegar. I added more vinegar and OJ and a little more olive oil to balance and then it was more flavorful...but still a tiny bit thin. 
Everyone at the party LOVED this salad - so I would highly recommend it.  BTW, I wish they'd give prep time including PREP - sectioning oranges can be very time consuming!

The dressing was a little sweet and could use some salt but the flavor combination is so good I have to give it 5 stars even though I'll cut the sugar way down next time.  Wonderfully refreshing on a warm summer evening.

For sure I rate this 5 stars!  Love this recipe.  The only thing I changed if you consider this a change is I use seedless clementine slices.   (O...and instead of sugar - I used splenda) DELICIOUS!

I made this recipe exactly as written. I found it to be quite bland with not too much of an orange flavor, and very sweet. I used the suggestion of other reviewers and added more balsamic vinegar, fresh squeezed lemon juice, minced garlic and more Dijon mustard.  It turned into a really nice dressing.

Delicious salad!  I used a shallot instead of red onion since it's not as pungent.  I didn't change anythng else.  The dressing is so fresh and flavorful.

This was delicious! I subbed shallot for red onion (I prefer the milder flavor) and agave for sugar, used fresh oregano, and I used less than half the dressing, which was plenty for us. The only change I'd make for next time is to add another orange, because I love the fresh flavor it adds. Absolutely delicious and so easy!

Wonderful salad, don't pass on making the wonderful dressing, you will miss a big taste treat! The recipe's summary in the beginning called for glazed walnuts, so I found a recipe on this sight for them!  I added a tsp. of fresh rosemary leaves chopped ever so fine and added in with the maple syrup mixture. I had never had Gorgonzola cheese it was just one of the great flavors of this salad, the pallet was constantly getting a new flavor! YUMMM! YUMMM! Everyone loved it!  I did add, the meat from a Rotisserie chicken so it would be a complete meal for all and then some!

I love the combo of items here, but the dressing didn't do it for us. Not enough flavor, and what flavor there was, was mostly that of olive oil (which I like, but, it's a salad, I wanted other flavors too). We ate it anyway, but I'm doctoring the remainder of the dressing up for tomorrow by adding more balsamic vinegar and dried orange zest. I do think the major problem was that I used bottled Tropicana orange juice -- pretty sure fresh OJ would have greatly improved the flavor profile but I didn't have a fresh orange to juice. The other thing is we like our dressings more heavy on the acids than this one, all of which is easily adjustable, folks! Thanks for the recipe! P.S. I added fresh blackberries too.

Great salad.  Made dressing per directions. Only difference in salad was to use mandarain oranges for convenience.  Will make again.  The salad does not need a lot of dressing and the recipe makes a lot so may cut ingredients for dressing in half next time

Great salad!  The dressing was good as is, but next time I'll omit the sugar (maybe add a tiny bit of Stevia) and use a little less oil.  YUM!

I thought the dressing had too much olive oil, I would cut back on that next time. I loved the citrus flavor in the dressing and the salad ingredients worked really well with the dressing.

This salad was soooo good!  I absolutely loved the dressing.  I left out the walnuts because I didn't have any on hand - but will definately be putting them on my grocery list so that I can make this salad again with them.  Very refreshing salad.  Could be made into a main dish by adding some marinated grilled chicken breast strips on top.  Love it!

I loved this recipe! Even my boyfriend, who is a "meat and potatoes" type of eater gobbled it up! I added feta b/c I did not have gorgonzola and added cranberries for an extra touch, and it was delicious! I'll definitely make this recipe again.

This 5 stars is only for the dressing.  I downsized the dressing recipe for 2 and it still made plenty...at least for me since I don't use too much.  It made at least 1/2 cup which will last me for at least 4-6 more meals. Instead of orange juice, I juiced some mandarin oranges.  I only added a very small pinch of dried oregano.  The salad consisted of what I had on hand...romaine lettuce, toasted walnuts, fresh mandarin oranges slices, pickled red onions, toasted sesame seeds, and a soy marinated and grilled salmon.  The dressing complimented all the ingredients very well.

This salad is so good and it makes you feel good knowing you're eating something good for you.  After reading the reviews, I decided to cut the sugar in half, which I'm glad I did or otherwise I think it would be too sweet.  I didn't have any walnuts, so I used toasted slivered almonds, and that tasted fine.  Definitely use the fresh squeezed juice instead of the one from concentrate.  Great combination of flavors!

I was excited to try this recipe ... but I think that was the problem.  I built it up in my mind too much.  It was too sweet and the dressing was a bit on the oily side.  I didn't care for it, but with some tweaking it would be much better for my tastes

Certainly an easy salad, but even cutting back the sugar to 1 1/3 tsp sugar made it too sweet.  I recommend the tangerine dressing in this site's Apple Avocado Salad with Tangerine Dressing (for which I squeezed clementines).

I followed another reviewer's suggestion to sub apples and goat cheese for the orange and gorgonzola, dropping the onion, and perhaps that was why the dressing seemed so sweet--though I did cut back the sugar.  Hmmmm.

DELISH! I used a can of mandarin oranges, glazed walnuts and skipped the sugar (instead added 1 1/4 packets of Splenda). I think next time I would use regular walnuts not glazed. Otherwise, it was so very good and I will make it again. Dressing would be good on any salad. I served this with Spinich Stuffed Salmon from this site. Thanks!

After reading the reviews, of course, I decided to add about 1/2 teaspoon of orange rind to the dressing, for  extra orange flavor.  Instead of juicing the oranges, I simply peeled and sectioned the orange and threw it in a blender to make the 2/3 cup needed. A thicker dressing in the outcome. My family and I sure enjoyed this salad recipe! Thanks faithful96!

Made this for Easter Sunday Dinner - was a huge hit. Did not add the the Gorganzola directly as some don't like it.Guests who like it added separately.  This dressing is delicious have already made it again since Sunday and its only Wednesday!  Found you can also use toasted Pecans if you do not have Walnuts on hand.

It was ok, uninteresting though.  It was lacking in contrast of flavors somehow, a mild salad with a sweet dressing..I have had better salads most definitely.

yum! this was very good - I thought that the dressing was a bit sweet and perhaps could reduce the sugar - or make it as directed then add more of the other dressing ingredients to reduce sweetness - that way you will have lots of yummy orange dressing to put in a bottle for your next salad - highly rate this dressing and could use on regular salads!!! The only gorgonzola I could find was very expensive so substituted using a soft blue cheese - but I would not do rthis again - you need a crumbly blue cheese for this one - and not too strong because it overpowers the salad

Very lite and very refreshing.  This is a perfect summertime salad !! We loved the arugula in it and the fresh oranges.  swapped pecans for the walnuts.  For the dressing I used some store bought oj and some fresh squeezed.  We loved the dressing!!

The salad dressing was so yummy!  What a great recipe.  I did not toast the walnuts, but thought the flavor was fine anyway.  Just a great mix of flavors.  I'll make this again.

AWESOME! I thought the amount of dressing seemed a bit much, so I halved it, except for the dijon mustard (kept that @ 2 tsps.) and it was perfect! We LOVED the flavor combination of this. I used a can of mandarin oranges in place of the fresh because I knew the mandarin's would be sweet. This salad was a perfect addition to our meal and one I will be making VERY often! Thanks for sharing. :)

Only changes were sweet onion (no red to be found), as well as dijon with honey (what I had in the fridge). Positively heavenly salad.

This was a great salad recipe.  My friends and family really enjoyed the homemade dressing.  I found the dressing made quite a large amount so the next time I maded it I cut the dressing in half.  We also enjoyed this dressing or both standard salads and spinach salads.

This salad was absolutely delicious, and very elegant.  I made it for Christmas Eve dinner along with Smothered Beef Gorgonzola, and everyone loved it.

This salad is really great! Instead of gorgonzola cheese I used feta cheese. It was very colorful. All the flavors blended very well together.

Yum. I love this salad. It's easy and delicious. I always mix my dressing in my food processor as I find the oil separates a bit when it's mixed by hand. I omit the sugar completely from the dressing - the OJ is sweet enough. I've also tried this with goat cheese for a friend who doesn't like gorgonzola. It's still good, but I prefer the gorgonzola as the flavours really compliment each other.

This is an awesome salad!!!  I didn't have walnuts and used pecans and added the gorgonzola to the dressing.  I also used it when I had a party as a drizzle over cold asparagus.  It was a huge hit and everyone wanted the recipe.

This was the best salad.  I used pecans in place of the walnuts and feta cheese instead of the gorgonzola.  I made the dressing exactly as stated, juicing my own oranges and using brown sugar instead of white.  It was so good.  I did halve the dressing recipe as it makes plenty.  I could eat this salad every night of the week.  Thanks.

I made the dressing for a similar salad - granny smith apples, glazed walnuts, red onion, chicken, but I forgot my blue cheese! I really liked the dressing. Made it in my food processor, cut the OJ to 1/4 cup, added some kosher salt. Will use it again.

we loved this.  I am thinking of adding a little tarragon to the dressing next time.  I used toasted almonds but I am thinking that pine nuts might be good also.  Such a different way to make salad.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This was a very nice salad.  If I were to change one thing, instead of using fresh naval oranges I would use mandarin oranges, I think the presentation would have been a bit nicer.  Very nice and fresh.

This salad was a big hit.  I had forgotten the Gorgonzola at home so I used some feta that my friend had in the fridge.  I made a double batch of the salad and they were scraping the bowl.  I agree with some of the reviews that the dressing was a bit on the bland side, but with all the flavours of the salad you hardly noticed.  The red onions and walnuts are truly the star of this salad.

This salad was extremely delicious and easy to make! I took it with me to a date's house for dinner, and he was so impressed! The only change I made (only because I was pressed for time) is I bought the DelMonte mandarin oranges in the glass jar instead of buying, peeling and sectioning navel oranges.

I was very disappointed after reading the rave reviews on this salad.  I made it for a surprise 40th and I ended up running out to purchase salad dressing from the store.  The dressing was a huge disappointment.  Very bland, runny and tasted like nothing but oil to me.

This was good.  I love the combo of walnuts, gorgonzola, red onion, and oranges.  I decreased the sugar a tad and used only olive oil based on other recommendations.  I used fresh oregano from our garden and squeezed my own orange juice.  The dressing wasn't citrusy enough for my taste.  I added some fresh lemon juice, which helped but next time (and there definitely will be a next time!!!), I'll add orange zest to give it a little more orange flavor.

This is really good, I was searching for a recipe that was close to what I had been served at a work luncheon. This was it, the dressing was exact, and I only made 2 minor changes to find the exact thing. I subsituted canned orange segments, and used blue cheese. This is great with grilled chicken breast on top for a tasty lunch.

So good and fresh!  I had this with the Fresh Asparagus Soup from this website which is also fantastic.  I was disappointed to see that I was out of walnuts so I used chickpeas and croutons.  I will try this again with walnuts because I am sure it is even better!

Made this for a BBQ and it was really good.  I took advice from lots of other reviewers - used pears instead of orange, added dried cranberries, used Danish blue cheese as couldn't find gorgonzola and used lots more than the recipe suggested, used pecans instead of walnuts, added garlic to the dressing and halved the dressing quantity, leaving the sugar out altogether.

SOOOOOO GOOD!!! Wow -- this is excellent. I just used a regular romaine lettuce, and as I could not find gorgonzola cheese, used a mild blue cheese instead. I think there is a little too much dressing in the recipe, and I would cut down about 1/3 next time; there was a pool of dressing in the bottom of the bowl. But SUCH a great salad, a hit of a birthday party. Delicious & easy.

5 stars from me but my boyfriend would probably give it 1.  I love salads like this and the vinaigrette was superb.  He likes regular old green salad with ranch so pay no attention to him!

My husband loved this salad.  I made it for Valentines day with Chicken Fricasse. He loved it - especially the Gorgonzola cheese and walnuts make it very unique.

This is a quick salad that packs a lot of flavor!  I served it with steaks and it was a big hit.  The sweet/tangy oranges, toasted walnuts and gorgonzola complimented each other so beautifully!  I really loved the citrus vinagrette dressing - I might use that on more salads!

This was a wonderful salad.  I had no walnuts (which I don't care for, anyway!) so subbed in sliced almonds, toasted.  The first time I made it was for a potluck, so couldn't plate it as directed.  That was a mistake, b/c the balsamic made the whole thing an unpleasant color.  Second time I did it as directed, and it was beautiful.

I just made the dressing and it is wonderful. I used canola oil in place of the vegetable oil and Delano Golden Balsamic style vinegar in place of the balsamic vinaigrette. Very mild flavor and doesn’t overpower the salad.

Really good salad. And very versatile. I did decrease the amount of sugar to 2 teaspoons though because we are trying to cut back on our sugar intake. That turned out well.

Deeeeelicious! 
Made it for my wife's office pot-luck party. She (they) loved it!

"The bout between the 'tang' from the citrus vinaigrette, the 'bite' from the gorgonzola and the sweetness from the juice and sugar explodes into summer freshness in your mouth."

This is a wonderful salad but a bit too sweet for my palate.  I would cut the sugar  somewhat or better yet, next time I'll use maple syrup instead of sugar.

Easy to make for a quick-fix lunch. Dressing could be a little less sweet — I reduced sugar to 3 tsp and it's still sweet from the orange juice. Otherwise fabulous combination. Will make again.

You only need to make half the amount of dressing.  I will add more gorgonzola next time.  I used two 11oz cans mandarin oranges.

I made this for my family barbeque today. A HIT! I took the advice of previous reviewers - added garlic to the dressing, only used 2 tsp BROWN sugar, used less oj. But I don't like oranges and the pears I bought weren't ripe, so I cut up watermelon into the salad instead, and it was amazing!!!! So refreshing. Would make this again in a heartbeat!

The dressing is really nice but I wasn't really a fan of the walnuts and gorgonzola.  I found the walnuts too bitter (perhaps too browned?) and the gorgonzola too gummy (does it come in different textures from dry to creamy?).  I will probably use the dressing again though.

Very tasty salad!  I reduced the sugar by half after reading the comments of others.  I also used a fig balsamic vinegar.  With those changes, the citrus dressing was very good.

I liked the contents of the salad (but we used crumbled goat cheese instead of gorgonzola), but did not care for the dressing. It tasted much too heavy and sweet for me, and I had to throw the whole thing out and start over. I ended up making a dressing with 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 1/2 cup grapeseed oil, 1/4 cup orange juice, and some fresh squeezed lemon juice, a spoon of dijon mustard, and some salt and pepper, so that salvaged the salad, but it still could have been better. I'm still looking for a good citrus dressing to use with this.

What a great salad.  Beautifully blended ingredients.  Loved the dressing.  I only put in one orange but will put in the second one next time, everyone was fighting over them.

I only gave the salad 4 stars because of the dressing.  I guess I really don't like balsamic vinegar.  I tried the recipe with rice vinegar, then realized I didn't like the oregano.  On my third attempt, I just used rice vinegar, orange juice, pepper, garlic, vegetable and olive oils and lime juice.  Perfect.  The salad has so many flavors going on without the dressing - I felt the lighter dressing was best!  LOVE the salad - I also used drained mandarin oranges - they're bite sized and sweeter.

This was delicious! I did make some minor changes... I used feta instead of gorgonzola b/c it's all I had. I also used regular walnuts (because that's what I had and didn't toast them or glaze them or anything). I went light on the oil (to watch calories). I mixed everything together instead of sprinkling on top. And I used a spring mix that had arugula in it and also added some kale! It was AMAZING! Even better the second day!

What a great salad recipe!  I did follow other's suggestions and eased up on the sugar.  I added a tsp at a time until it was just right.  I brought this dish to our neighbours for pot luck and it was a hit!

The only reason I gave this a four and not a five is because the recipe calls for a bit too much sugar, so I cut that by half.  Otherwise, the salad is wonderful.  I make it every year at Christmas for my family and they always rave over it!

The combination of ingredients is wonderful, but you could come up with your personal preferences pretty easily - I used feta instead of gorgonzola, but chevre would have been good too.  I used mandarin oranges instead of navel oranges, especially because October is not "orange season".  The dressing was too sweet for me though - I used o.j. from my fridge and perhaps if you used fresh squeezed o.j. instead, it wouldn't be as sweet.  If I make again, I will significantly reduce the sugar so it's not so sweet.  Otherwise, it was good.

The dressing is fabulous.  I added a clove of garlic (preference only).  The onion is a little over powering and next time I would add less and chop it very fine.  I would also added an extra orange.

Love this dressing!  It's really light and very healthy.  I made it with Clementines and Clementine juice instead of oranges.  YUM! I also substituted pecans for the walnuts. I didn't have blue cheese so I used Feta.

My husband and I loved everything about this salad.  The dressing was so good I almost drank the remainder from my salad bowl. (Just kidding) It was richly flavored, textured and the dressing was just the right amount of sweet/salty/citrus.

I have made this recipe several times and it is absolutely delicious.  The light citrus flavor of the dressing makes for a wonderful and refreshing summertime salad.

Absolutely wonderful!  Made it for Mothers Day and it was a huge hit.  Didn't have gorgonzola so I used feta.

This was good.  I liked the dressing and the walnuts and oranges.  I was not a big fan of the gorgonzola.  It just didn't have much flavor, even though it is strong.  I would have preferred goat cheese.

Light and fresh!  I added sweetened dried cranberries for a little more interest and only used olive oil.  Perfect for summer!

I only made the dressing from this, but yummy!  Didn't have too much of a citrussy flavor so next time I'll use a stronger/sweeter oj.  Other than that this makes a great vinaigrette!

This salad is good enough for company. I made it for Valentines Day and my husband, who thinks he can only eat Ranch dressing loved it. I did add a few sprinkles of brown sugar and butter to the nuts as I toasted them. Otherwise I made the recipe exactly as written. Oops, I forgot I did serve it on spinach leaves and reg. lettuce because I already had it on hand. I'll definately make again.

I made this salad for a work function.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  It is so easy to make and the dressing is fabulous.  I am watching carbs, so I used a Lite orange juice, and Splenda and it still tasted great.  Nobody even noticed that it was "Lite".
