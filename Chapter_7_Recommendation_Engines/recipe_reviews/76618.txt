The recipe was very bland but I tweaked mine a little and it turned out great the second time. I added a bit of salt to taste some garlic and onion powder a pinch of hot pepper flakes and some cocuntut milk. It gives the dish depth and the sauce is very flavorful.

This recipe is very bland and really needed a little salt and something else. My family doesn't even want me to make it again.

I made this with shelled mussels from the freezer portion of the fish counter. I added a cup of sour cream, scallions and a touch of Aleppo pepper to give it some zip. I also thickened the cream sauce with a bit of corn starch. With those additions it was very good
