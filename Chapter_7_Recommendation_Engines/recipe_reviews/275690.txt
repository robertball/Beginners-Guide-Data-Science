It was a hit at our Bible study! I was out of maple syrup so I used 2 tbsp of pancake syrup.

Very yummy, but it was a little runnier that I hoped and I might try it without the last tablespoon of maple syrup at the end, and add a pinch of salt to balance the sweetness. I also wasn't sure how long to mix it as the instructions didn't say, so perhaps if I whipped it longer, it would have cooled more and been less runny going on the cake.

We LOVE it; used 1/2 as much butter. Kids and husband thought it was delicious. We put it on a Nutella Star; our 10-year-old made it all! Recommend on anything. And our wasn't too runny at all. Maybe less butter is key. YUM! We will make again.
