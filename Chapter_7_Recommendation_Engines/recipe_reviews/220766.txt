I gave this 4 stars because I wanted a more lemony flavour.  It is a great cake mix.  I made it a second time and took out 6Tbs of the 1c of milk and added lemon juice in its place.  I also used 1c of whole wheat flour & 2c all purpose and reduced the sugar to just under 2 cups.  It was super moist and really lemony, just the way I like it.

Delicious! 

I cut the recipe in half and it baked up beautifully.  The glaze at the end was not soaking in so I carefully poked the sides of the loaf with a fork and swirled the juice around.  I had a surplus of lemons and not a lot of butter so this recipe was a good match.  Will definitely make again but with a bit less sugar.  Bonus: my husband also found this cake delicious.

This bread was delicious!  I liked the glaze because it helped when taking the bread out of the pan too.  I didn't like the idea of nuts in Lemon bread so I put in 2 TB of poppy seeds.  Yummy!

I don't know if it was a mistake or not, like if it was uncooked in the middle, but it tasted like I'd put lemon curd in the middle (which I didn't) and it made it extra delicious!

I was excited to make this recipe because my family loves all things lemon. But I was disappointed in the lack of lemon flavor in the bread itself. The glaze that is poured on is delicious but I really wish the inside of the bread had more flavor. I may try again but add lemon juice to the bread recipe.

This recipe is very forgiving. I accidentally put the lemon juice in the batter and it still turned out just fine. I had two very large lemons and that equaled 12 tablespoons of juice. I doubled the recipe. And cut it into lasagna pans. Left out the nuts because some folks have not allergies where I'm taking the cake, and put poppyseeds instead.

Wonderful recipe.  I followed as directed and finished with two beautiful loaves of lemon bread. I would suggest that you grease the pans well as the sugar glaze is sticky and drips down the edge making them tough to remove. Excellent flavourful dessert!

I didnâ€™t have enough lemon zest so I added 1/4 tsp of lemon extract to the batter.

I made this recipe as shown except I added  an extra tablespoon of lemon juice and a little extra lemon zest. After reading some of these reviews I was afraid it wouldn't have enough lemon flavor, but 
 it had wonderful lemon flavor and it was great! Maybe the extra zest did the trick. Only thing I would do differently next time is maybe a little less time in the oven, it was slightly drier than i wanted.

I think 60 minutes was too long to cook it because it came out dry.  Next time I will cook it in about 50 minutes.  Otherwise, good.

I took this to an allrecipes get together and served it with Tequila Lime Strawberries and it was a huge hit.  Rave reviews from everyone
 I did make any changes to the recipe and baked it for 60 minutes.  This is going in my keeper file! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This recipe was AWESOME. I  do recommend if you like it very lemony to put lemon juice into the mixture other that that it was amazing.

Easy and wonderfully sweet recipe. The sugar/lemon juice poured over the top created a nice sweet crust. I made the recipe as is, no tweaks, and would make again! It was the perfect texture, and not too sweet or tangy.

EXCELLENT! Hubby brought home some Meyer lemons and I sure wasn't going to let them go to waste.  Used three lemons in this recipe and the loafs turned out great. We are both lemon lovers...Thank for the KEEPER!

I loved the flavor,but I had trouble because I overfilled the disposable pans- my error but wished the author would have specified loaf pan sizes. After greasing the pan I put some lemon crystals into the flour in the pan - it added a great tang.
