I made this recipe for a formal baby shower luncheon. Everyone raved about the salad and EVERYONE asked for the recipe. This is a winner!

We loved this salad - it is really different an very tasty.  the only thing I would change next time is the nuts - pistachios are ok, but they are not my favorite nut - will try pecans, which I think will work as well.
