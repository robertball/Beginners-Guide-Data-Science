Delicious and one I will make again! I thought the dough seemed too wet when I kneaded in the olives and garlic, but the bread is big, moist and excellent, so I wouldn't change the amount of flour. PS I DID leave in an olive pit by accident and my husband nearly broke a tooth! Be careful.

I made this bread yesterday.  Followed the recipe to a T.  I measured the flour with my scale weighing 1 pound = 4 c of flour.
This is one of the easiest recipes for bread that I've ever used.  Wonderful results.  Will make again.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I was rather skeptical while making this bread.  It was extremely easy, but when I began kneading the dough, the entire filling burst through and all over my counter.  I just managed the get the dough into a ball, pressed some of the filling onto the surface of the dough, and decided to try baking it anyways.  It was wonderful!  My husband, myself and our two young children polished off most of the loaf at dinner, and finished the rest for breakfast the next morning.  Next time I make it (which will be soon), I'll just knead it altogether, and not worry about keeping the filling in the middle. Do try this delicious bread. We ate it with souvlaki and a Greek salad.

Very tasty! I used a more traditional method for rising instead of heating anything, and I made the whole recipe by hand. I did use Black and Green Olives because I didn't have Kalamata...although I do love Kalamta!! I let it rise for a full hour on the second rise after shaping. The end result was soft and moist...packed with flavor! I'll try the addition of some olive brine in place of some water next time and maybe a little rosemary. I also only used 1 tsp of salt in the dough because I was using such salty olives! Wonderful recipe-thanks.

Found this recipe while looking for a roasted garlic bread recipe. It was really good! The method described really sped up the proofing process. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer instead of a food processor. Here's the ingredient changes I used: only 2 cloves of garlic as what I had was getting a little dry and thus more pungent and a Tbl of dried rosemary, crushed.

This makes a very satisfying, dense yet tender loaf.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it's an easy bread to make in an afternoon.  I like the use of the Kalamata olives, but the garlic tasted a little "raw".  Next time I will try sauteing the garlic in a little of the olive oil before putting it in the bread.

Very easy, and very good.  I just mixed it with a spoon and then my hands, and kneaded it a bit in the bowl.  I made it with whole wheat flour, and it still came out very moist.  I got half way through the recipe before I realized I was out of Kalamata olives.  Oops!  I used green olives instead, and it was tasty!  It did end up a little too salty with the green olives though, so if I do that again I'll cut some of the salt in the bread.

Great recipe, and I'll be using it again!

Yummy and very easy to make.  I wish it had a denser consistency though, it was very light.

I made this as stated, but distributed olives and garlic through out the entire loaf and not just the center.  I don't have a food processor but even by hand this was super easy even for a non bread maker like myself. Will definately make again.

This bread was so easy to make! I made it by hand because I love the process. It turned out great and was quite tasty along with our lentil soup. I added fresh rosemary to the filling and kneaded the ingredients through the bread. The filling poked out in places but looked pretty and rustic. The texture of the bread was like country white...was hoping it would be more like an Italian loaf...not sure how to achieve that texture since I'm not very experienced in bread baking. This would be a great recipe baked as foccacia too!

Given the glowing reviews, I was disappointed. This is a flat-tasting, substanceless bread, essentially a loaf of wonder bread with diced garlic and olive in it. I was able to improve it a bit by drizzling olive oil on top and coating the loaf with fresh rosemary, but I still won't make it again. The bread with cloves of garlic that my grocery (Albertson's) deli makes is far heartier and tastier.

Best olive bread ever! Reduced the salt by half, roasted the garlic and added fresh rosemary. Made the dough in the bread machine using the dough cycle and finished the bread as described. Next time I will shape into two loafs, as this recipe makes a massive loaf.

Will make this again BUT I will let it rise for a longer period next time as it turned out pretty dense.  For this recipe I had to bake it an extra 20 minutes for some reason and I was using the convection oven.   The following modifications were made: manzanilla olives instead of Kalamata instead of water used the brine from the olives (eliminated the salt) mixed the garlic and olives right in the bread like other suggested.   Nice flavour

This was absolutely stunning to make.  It was great 1st time I made.  2nd time I didn't do well because I overheated the dough during rising period, and under kneaded it, as well.  (I used only 1 tsp salt, but next time I will do just as recipe calls for).

I did this by hand, and it was good.

However, I will let rise the traditional method since I don't have accuracy of temp while it rises.

I read up on troubleshooting kneading and found many good helpful tips.  I would say do not under knead the bread, which was my problem in 2nd batch I did.  (do the window pane test.) This is worth making!

So simple to make. No need to use processor as works just as well with Kenwood or by hand. Does need a little less salt and I will add olives and garlic when mixing next time as it is a little difficult to do it after the first rise. Will also try adding fresh rosemary. Thx Martha for sharing

Ended up making 5 loaves of this over the weekend. The first loaf i made as directed, but the second i used twice the amount of olives. Everyone loved it, even the kids.

Very good recipe, but I too made the recipe by hand, didn't use a bread machine or food processer and it turned out great.  I also mixed the olives and minced garlic right into the dough and decided to bake my bread on a Pizza stone and I love the way it turned out, more like Foccocia Bread.  I spread some olive oil on the pizza stone, sprinkled a little cornmeal on the stone then spread out the dough.  I brushed the top with a bit of olive oil then added chopped  fresh Rosemary on top just before I put it in the oven. Only thing I would do different is use less salt.

ok my first attempt was awful...all my fault the next attempt following all directions whoo hoo fantastic bread!  now that got my mind racing, if olives and garlic were good, why not jalepanoes, sharp cheddar and garlic, then why not olives, garlic and feta?  you get the idea thanks Martha I will always love the original but go for the others..btw the jalepeno and cheddar was great with chili

Great, but way too salty! I would prefer maybe half the salt, but I don't know if reducing it would affect the consistency of the bread. I added rosemary and sun dried tomatoes, and I used some kind of Italian olives instead of Kalamata olives.

This is the first time making a yeast bread for me! I really liked the simple, clear instructions. The bread turned out very tasty, but I changed the recipe a lot. I used rye flour, and added many herbs, both dry and fresh. I also put QUITE the heaping half cup of olives (I like olives a lot) and I kneaded the olives into the bread, not in the center. With all the changes I did, it still rose, but not a *super* lot. It is quite dense and moist, which is good, imho.

I loved this recipe. I also used very little salt, about 1/2 tsp. I also spread out the filling throughout the whole bread, and I used garlic infused olive oil for extra taste!  Delicious!!!   I baked it on a prepared pizza stone.  It was out of this world. I made a loaf last night - then woke up early this morning to make another loaf. I ate drizzled with chile pepper infused olive oil!  My new favorite food!

The bread part was OK, a little heavy and dense but eatable. I did not care for the olive and garlic filling. The garlic needs to be sautéed and the filling should be worked into the dough because getting a mouth full of it was to much. Not sure I'd ever do this one again.

Yummy!  This bread tastes amazing!  I added a bit of chopped up roasted red pepper which looked pretty too.  I will make this bread whenever we serve lamb and I think it will be a wonderful bread for chicken salad sandwich!

It was easy to make.  Mine came out kind of salty and I wonder if it's because I didn't have any non-iodidezed salt?  Aren't the olives packed in some kind of salt solution?  Anyway, it does taste pretty good and I know I'll use it no matter what.  Hence, only 4 stars.

Made this for "Greek night", used Kitchen aid & added garlic and olives after it was mixed, great flavor. Did'nt even need butter.

Have made this a couple of times now. The first time, I used a combination of kalamata and green olives and it was great. The second time I replaced the olives with artichoke hearts (canned) with great results as well! This is a pretty versatile bread and takes seasonings well - I added garlic powder, rosemary, and basil. I do take others' advice and mix the filling into the dough instead of leaving most of it in the middle.

Awesome! Super easy in the kitchen maid, and should also be simple for bread beginners, too. I'd suggest hand kneading in the olives and garlic, though. I used julienned garlic cloves and decided that they needed to be cut even thinner. 
Like I said, the bread was easy to make and delicious (especially warm!). It wasn't dry at all.
