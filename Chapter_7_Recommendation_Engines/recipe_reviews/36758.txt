We found this to not only taste bad, but to also smell really unappealing.  Low fat or not, we absolutely will not make this again - we could not even eat it the night we made it.

LOVED this recipe.  My boyfriend and I usually avoid onions but I added them anyway and I'm glad I did.  This does not taste low fat to me!  I will definetely make this again and again.

For once I am really glad I didn't read the reviews before I tried a dish.  We loved this.  Ours was not soupy or bland, in fact it puffed up nicely when I baked it in a large round dish.  I used regular sour cream, but the ricotta and cheese on top were low fat.  I did have a little less than a full cup of water to add back in due to a little accident, but that was the only change I made.  I also wasn't sure if the recipe should use fresh or frozen broccoli so I used fresh.  Perhaps those with soupy textures used frozen, I am not sure.  When I make this again the only thing I will change is to either leave the onions out or saute them prior to adding in.  I did not care for the crunchy onions.  Even my four year old daughter that refuses to eat broccoli in any form ate her potatoes tonight.

This recipe sounded better than how it turned out.  It is lacking something, maybe a can of creamed soup to make it a fluffy casserole rather than a soupy dish.

This recipe was actually disappointing.  I think the recipe is too large so there isn't enough room for all of it to cook properly.

I made this for a company function and everyone really enjoyed it.  It has a little spice to it, but it was wonderful!

This was yummy.  I used a little less water than the recipe calls for and it did not turn out runny as some of the other reviewers said.  I also added some miced fresh garlic and was generous with the red pepper as I like things spicy.  Excited to try varitions with different veges.  Will make again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

Tasted OK, but seemed more of a thick soup.  Pretty good, but not my preference
