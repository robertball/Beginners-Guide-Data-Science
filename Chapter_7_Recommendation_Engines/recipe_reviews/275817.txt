This was a hit! My husband and son had seconds. I followed the recipe as is, except I added a few parsley flakes to the cheese mixture, because I didnâ€™t have fresh parsley for garnish.

Very good and very easy. My kind of meal! I used regular Ricotta cheese and added a couple extra lasagna noodles, other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.
