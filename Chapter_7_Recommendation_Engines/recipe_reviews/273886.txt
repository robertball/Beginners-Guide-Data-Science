Delicious, easy dish. I love any excuse to use my Dutch oven, and this was a good one pot meal to use it for.

Made this for Mah Jongg night with my gal pals and it was a hit.  Everyone had seconds.  The only change I would make would be to add a little heat to it though if cooking for a crowd, you might just keep a bottle of Tapatillo handy since not everyone likes heat.  Served it with homemade guac.  Yummy!!

I substituted parsley for cilantro (tastes like soap to me) and cut back on the garlic. Great taste, taking the time to toast the rice is well worth it. My wife thought it a bit dry but it looked like the photos.

This was ok but definitely lacked in seasoning;  it was quite bland.  It's basically arroz con pollo

Not spicy enough. Next time will use Ro Tel tomatoes.
