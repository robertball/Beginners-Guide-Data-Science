YUM! But seriously, 1 cup of mayo? I used 2 tablespoons. 4 stars because if I would have used 1 cup of mayo, I'm positive this would have been inedible. I omitted the onions, added a shake of garlic salt, and a little dill relish. I've never tried mozzarella on a tuna melt before, but it was awesome. Thank you!

Years ago my mom used to make chicken melts but she couldn't remember how she made them.  As soon as I read this recipe, I knew this was it.  She substituted canned chicken for the tuna, same amount of mayo (I used light), onion optional, cheddar cheese on a toasted english muffin.  Bake it in the oven until warm and cheese is melted. Yum!!  Thanks for helping me recreate my mom's recipe.

Too much mayonnaise and lacks flavor.  Maybe use 1/2 cup of mayonnaise and add some garlic salt and black pepper.

Great tuna melt.  I did add about 2T of pickle relish and a few shakes of a garlic/dill seasoning blend.  Didn't measure mayo, just eyeballed until I had the consistency I wanted (remember, it will dry out a bit while in the oven).

Made exactly as is and this made a great tuna melt.  

I think people are having an issue with the recipe because they're assuming that the recipe calls for one small can of tuna (usually 4 or 5 oz. depending on brand) but the recipe actually calls for a 12 oz can.  1 C of mayo for a 12 oz can is pretty much dead on to bind the tuna, onion and cheese.

Great recipe!

WAAAY to much mayo!  Mind you, I ate tuna sandwiches throughout my entire third pregnancy because I craved them so badly, (not to mention I love them) and this was a nice change.  Try adding a little hot Giardinera relish to zest it up a bit!  Thanks P. Kelly!

Used Italian bread since that's what I had, and fat-free Miracle Whip which is what I call 'mayo' :-)  (I used the amt called for & liked it that way.) Nothing extraordinary, but good, very simple and quick.  If I happen to have the bread around, this is great for when I'm being lazy or need to use up some tuna or something.

Mayo commenters, please note that the standard can of tuna is 3 oz and this recipe is calling for a can that is 12 oz.  More mayo use...  I always scrape a barely-there layer of mayo onto the bread when I grill a melt. It provides a beautifully glazed finish to the sandwich and its arguably better for you than butter -- but once you are grilling a sandwich that just is not an issue!  

That's why I liked the idea of baking it, no finish. This was pretty good so I did it again with scallions and roasted red peppers (pat them dry). Just plain YUM!

Very good recipe. I have to disagree with the reviewers who say there is too much mayo. I started out using half because so many said it was way too much and I could just tell that it was too dry, so I added the other half and it was excellent. I wonder, though...the recipe tripped me up for a minute because it said 1 12-oz can of tuna fish. I have never bought a 12-oz can of tuna fish in my life. I didn't know they were sold in anything but 6-oz cans. So at first when I thought I read 1 cup of mayo for 1 (6 oz) can of tuna my eyes popped. I did use light mayo to cut calories and added a dash of garlic salt. Will make again.

AWESOME recipe!  I just got finished devouring this!  I did; however, make a few small changes:  I followed the previous post's advice about using less mayo and only used about 4 tablespoons.  I didn't have mozz cheese on hand, but did have some Kraft shredded taco cheese and used that.  I alway keep a mix of  fresh diced veggies in the refridgerator of red bell pepper, green bell pepper, red onion and cilantro (for chicken quesdillas, chicken nachos, etc.), so I added a bit of this to my tuna mixture.  Then, I put the mixture on a splitted wheat English muffin and placed it in the oven until the cheese was slightly melted then I swtiched it over to Broil on high for about 3 min so the cheese was nice and brown on top.

Really nice recipe that lends itself to lots of experimentation! Excellent as is! Personally, jalapenos might spice it up on some occassions, but not called for every time one makes this recipe. For my own self, I think this recipe is great, but would highly recommend cutting down on the mayo! I usually substitute yogurt for the mayo minus the whey for health food reasons and it turns out very good. A+++ and thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!

Excellent basic tuna melt recipe. I don't know how a reviewer could give fewer than five stars. The recipe lends itself to changes to suit individual tastes such as more spice or whatever.
I always dislike reviews that count off because the finished dish might not appeal to their taste instead of it being a faulty recipe. This is great!

Using a whole cup of mayonnaise dilutes the flavor of the tuna too much.  This recipe cuts calories in that it's baked in the oven and not grilled in a skillet.  However, the clincher is the cheese....you really need to use either cheddar or swiss to get that zing in your tuna melt flavor!!

Serve with chicken noodle soup for a quick cold weather lunch. Use lightly toasted english muffin, add finely diced celery and top with thin tomato slice. I use a 1:1 ratio of drained water packed tuna to mayo as the celery & onion add a little moisture to the spread. Serve with celery & carrot sticks along with a dill pickle spear. Great for a quick "no brainer" lunch......and a good way to sneak some veggies in for those picky kids.

I agree with whomever said "seriously a cup of mayo".  I would use maximum 3 tablespoons flat per can of tuna.  I also add more veggies e.g. celery, red pepper, fresh parsley - all chopped finely.  Otherwise, it's terrific.

I haven't made this recipe to rate it, however, I am always asked to make my tuna salad whenever there's a brunch.  I put fresh lemon juice in it, fresh crushed garlic, sweet pickle relish, a little bit of sweet red onion chopped really fine or pulverized in a food processor( too much makes it too oniony, which I don't like) fresh parsley, kosher salt & pepper.  Fresh dill sounds delicious and so does using mozzarella cheese...I'll have to try that next time.  Anyways, you can't screw up a tuna melt if you put whatever ingredients you like in it.  I've even made tuna with fresh broccoli, carrots and spinich that I food process first and add to my flaked tuna with some lemon juice & relish...I eyeball mayo/miracle whip too until right consistency.

These are great.  I worked in a school cafeteria and we use to make these for the kids on hot dog buns, wrap them in foil and baked them until the cheese melted.  we called them  "Sea Dogs".

Very yummy!! One thing I love with this recipie is that the tuna doesn't melt out of the sandwhich when I bake it. It all stays put. I used 3/4 cup mayo along with addding some salt, onion powder and crushed garlic. I also put some cheese on top of the sandwhichs to melt on and make them look pretty! :) Onion powder works fine but next time I want fresh! :) Oh and the best part is this is really easy and fast to make!!

I have made this several times...each time different.  I love the availability of change in this recipe.  When I made this according to the recipe, I did not like the amount of mayo.  So I made it again with half the mayo.  I have made this with salmon, garlic powder and creole seasoning added...bake and then top with more cheese.  this recipe is a keeper for sure.

I use 4-5 cans of tuna for this recipe, then use everything else as is. 1 cup of mayo for just 1 can of tuna is way too much, but for 4 cans of tuna, it's perfect! A family favorite!

I give this 5 stars...for a tuna melt!  It has a ton of mayo for one can of 12 oz tuna, which might be throwing some others off with the amount of mayo.  I have to use 3-5 oz cans of tuna and I use a little more than the cup of mayo and 2 cups of cheese.  Of course you can use less if you WANT to, but if you are going to make a tuna melt, just accept that it will NOT be a low cal sandwich, and go ahead and use the whole cup of mayo and 2 cups of cheese!!  You can add more or less veggies - I substitute onion powder for the onion b/c hubby doesnt like onion.  Doctor it up as you see fit, but just remember, it's a tuna MELT!!  Surprisingly tasty!

This works with just about any bread you have. I like to use whole wheat bread or english muffins. I suggest you don't use a whole cup of mayonnaise, a tablespoon or two with a tablespoon or two of dijon should be plenty. I use about 1/4 of an onion, add garlic powder and maybe some red pepper flake and whatever chopped veggies I have on hand. Great way to clean out your pantry/fridge before shopping day. NOTE: If you don't like soggy bread, you might want to use day old bread or toast it just a bit before adding your ingredients. I like mine a little crispier. If your family isn't a fan of onion pieces in their sandwiches, you can substitute onion powder.

I used this as a basic recipe, and altered it to my family's tastes.  I omitted the onion, and added pickle relish and sliced celery.  I used about 3 T mayonnaise to 6 ounces tuna, and replaced the shredded mozzarella with slices of monterey jack cheese placed on top of the tuna melt.  Finally, I toasted whole wheat english muffins and then baked the melts.  The kids BOTH gobbled them up, which rarely happens at my house.

Pretty tasty...I liked the amount of onion, but used too little mayo and will use the recommended amount next time. Nothing fancy or spectacular, but an easy and simple change of pace from the regular tuna melt.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and only added enough mayo for my taste.  They were right - one cup would have been WAY too much.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written, only adding a bit of garlic powder to the sandwich mixture before popping them in the oven.  This was a good, quick dinner - will make again!  Also good for leftovers, which is nice.

So much mayo, but in all a good recipe. I would put maybe 3 tablespoons mayo add some Greek yogurt and def add the pickle relish and some garlic powder.

I love tuna melts and liked the variation with mozz cheese.  Did not use the full amount of mayo - thought it seemed like way too much.  I use 1 heaping tablespoon per can of tuna.  My kiddos don't like raw onion, so I substitue onion powder.  

Occasionally, I will make these extra special by using very soft cream cheese in place of the mayo - 1 oz per can or some combination of cream cheese and mayo.

This recipe is delicious, although I did replace the mayo with a can of campbells cream of mushroom soup and used cheese buns instead of bread. Very yummy, would recommend this recipe in a heartbeat

Used fat-free yogurt instead of mayo.  No one knew the difference.  Added relish, and TB of lemon juice.  Used less cheese than recipe called.  Good warm or cold.

We would add celery and onion to the tuna with 2 T of mayonnaise.  Put a scoop onto a hamburger bun..a slice of cheese...and pop it into a wax paper bag and into the oven for about 15 minutes.  It comes out toasted and sooooo good!

This is a great jumping off recipe. As is, a tad bland. I added chopped boiled egg, some honey mustard, and a sprinkle of chili pepper. I used ff mayo and they were delic! I toasted the buns before adding the tuna, then shredded the cheese over top, then put under the broiler.oh yes, I added some sweet relish .

Having never made tuna melts before I found this recipe to be the best.  My husband told me he wanted me to make him a sandwich like the cafeteria ladies in college used to make.  This recipe is exactly how he described it.  I used garlic texas toast in place of the french bread. Yummy!  Thanks P Kelly!

Too much mayo. I started with a 1/4 cup & slowly added more to suit our tastes. Probably came to 1/2 cup mayo. I also added a little garlic powder & because I didnt have 2 cups mozzarella I had to use about 3/4 cup parmesan to make up for the mozz i was lacking. Overall, this was very tasty! I think the base recipe is fabulous & simple & can be dressed up easily with tomatoes, eggs, celery, or anything else you desire.

Great Recipe, other than 1 C is way too much mayo (the reason it lost 1 star). I reccommend gradually adding it to the tuna mixture until it is the consistency you desire.  Had to use regular sliced toast because that's all I had.  I also added a bit of garlic powder, dill, brown mustard, and a couple of baby spinach leaves on top under some extra cheese.  YUM!

Several other reviewers noted the extreme amount of mayo.  I also thought it sounded excessive.  Like another reviewer, I found 2 Tbsp. of mayo seemed to be sufficient.  I used English muffins instead of French bread.  I discovered after making the recipe, that I hadn't read it carefully enough--I sprinkled the mozzarella on top of the sandwich instead of mixing it in with the tuna.  The next day I added about 1-1/2 c. cheese and discovered that some additional mayo was needed to bind it together.  Another 2 Tbsp. seemed to do the trick.  I found the mixture seemed a little flat--it needs something to spice it up, maybe some prepared mustard.  I wouldn't make it again as is.

LOVED this! I thought the amount of mayo was perfect with the 12 oz. tuna. My family all raved about these. I added a little bit of seasoning: about 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. Mrs. Dash, and some pepper. I made these open-faced on hamburger buns and sprinked some of the cheese with a bit of parmesean on top. Yum yum yum!!

Good recipe, I used 5 tablespoons of light mayo and used whole wheat bagels. I baked for ten minutes and then put a slice of swiss cheese on top and put them under the broiler for a minute and the cheese was brown and bubbly....

This was delicious. I never had tuna melts as a child because I refused to eat tuna, so I have no hand me down recipe for this. I followed this recipe to the letter (my bread was frozen anyway, so leaving it in the oven while it preheated wasn't a problem) but removed the mustard because I didn't have any and the pickles because I hate them, so this was easy to adjust to my tastes. Any recipe I can follow pretty much exactly and is really, really tasty gets a 5 from me.

These were very good and liked by the whole family. Very easy and fast.
 I did make them with the biskets like someone had suggested. I also used cheddar cheese. Topped them off with a sprinkle of cheese also.
I will try them with something else next time.

I think that 1 c of Mayo is insane.
Spiced my tuna with relish, garlic powder, and pepper.  It still was fairly bland, but good enough for lunch  ;)

This recipe was very good, but I did add a few things. I only used two spoonfuls of the mayonnaise and I added tomato, sliced olives, and some garlic salt on top. It turned out amazing and my kids loved it too!

I really enjoyed this recipe with some slight modifications. My husband absolutely love it. The mixed in Mozzarella was a genius touch. I did add garlic salt, fresh ground pepper, and Mrs. Dash. I also used considerably less mayonnaise. Overall, a delicious, quick and filling recipe.

It immediately became a favorite in our house! Our 6 year old LOVED it!! My only variation was to use Mexican blend cheese. (Only thing I had on hand!) 1 cup of mayo....PERFECT!!!! My husband has suggested this as an easy and tasty dinner on baseball nights! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

OMG!  I've made this a few times now and this has become a family favorite - a definite keeper! It's quick, easy and flavorful.  The only thing I did extra was to add a couple teaspoons of "Hot Hoagie Spread" which took this "over the top" yummy!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This was really good. I toasted them in the toaster oven and they turned out great. I too "eyed" the measurements and added garluc seasoning and pepper...I didn't have onion. I think either way you do this it'll turn out great.

I have a disability that keeps me from using knives, so instead of diced onions I used dried onions.  It worked out great.  The sandwiches had just the right onion flavor.  Also, I reduced the recipe for just 2 servings by "eyeing" the ingredients to match one 5 oz can of tuna.  Baked in the toaster oven for about 10 minutes, until the cheese began to brown on top.  Delicious!!!

Didn't want to have so much of it leftover, and took some caution with the mayonnaise, so overall I used only half of the ingredients, with only 1/4 a cup of mayo. Turned out pretty well, although seeming to lack a little in volume and flavor with just these ingredients. Still a good base, though, and I'll probably look to add to it in the future.

THis was good!! I've never had a tuna melt so i thought I'd try it since I was going to eat tuna for lunch either way. Was good but feel like it needed abit more flavor. I used shredded cheddar and a slice of mozzarella over lettuce to hold in place. Next time I think I need to let it heat up more cheese was melted but middles of sandwich needed abit more to heat through. Will try again w hubby and see what he thinks.

I agree with some of the comments in regard to the amount of mayonaise! A little much for the tastes in our household but other than that, great! I really liked using the sweet onion over a regular red or white. I tried the recipe a couple times and experimented with different types of bread including a whole grain/seasame bread - delicious. I also added one clove of fresh garlic to the tuna/mayo - little bit of a kick. I imagine there are lots of little ways you could personalize this but a great base and really fast!!

I mixed my  tuna with MUCH less mayo, onion and finely diced celery. I then cored and sliced an apple into very thin rounds. I put the apple slice on top of the tuna on the bread, and used a slice of alpine lace swiss cheese and broiled for a few minutes after baking to get the cheese to bubble slightly .... YUMMMY !!

WAY too much mayo.

I use green onions / scallions.

I lightly toast the bread, spread the tuna on top, lay slices of cheese on top (don't mix it in the tuna) and pop them under the broiler for 2-3 minutes.

Other than that, the recipe is perfect!

I haven't made these as yet this way but have made melts for years.  I always use hard boiled eggs along with the tuna and they are delicious and go farther with the eggs.  Never a cup of mayo..I just used enough to hold the ingredients together like I was making a sandwich.  The tuna and egg together is my daughter's favourite sandwich also.

It was okay, only used 2 tbsp of light mayo, used cheddar and mozzarella, added garlic powder and onion powder along with pepper. Used whole wheat as well. Put it in for 10 min at 350 but then turned broiler on for 5 minutes.

This was pretty good and different. I used just plain white bread and used my toaster oven. It cooked it just right. I also added a little garlic powder and only about 2 1/2 TBLS of Miracle Whip, not a cup of Mayo it would have been to much. I also added a little relish. Thanks for the change to the same ol thing.

I made these tonight and even the kids liked them. I used about 1/4 of the mayo called for - I used four cans of tuna and one cup of mayo. I did with onions and without, but sauteed the onions in butter first until they were soft. Very good!

We liked this very well; it was a change of pace from the standard tuna sandwich.  My boyfriend said it wasn't anything spectacular, though.  My fault, most likely, since I used Italian bread instead of quality French.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly (left out the onions, and used cheddar cheese), but I loved the sandwiches - melted in your mouth.  It was a great change of pace.

Great Sunday afternoon lunch.  Substituted cheddar and swiss cheese for the mozerella and it was still wonderful! Kids and hubby gave it a thumbs up.

No thanks! If you are craving a melting cheesy toasted tuna melt" look elsewhere. I order tuna melts like its my job when I'm having lunch... this was the worst "tuna melt" I've ever had. Call it something else, call it open faced tuna and cheese bake. If you called it that, I wouldn't have been disappointed because I would not have made it.

I also like adding diced, hard boiled eggs to my tuna salad and tuna melts.  This was a fine tuna melt recipie.  I used 4 "regular" cans of tuna (20oz before I drained it) to roughly 9 tablespoons of mayo.  (It's so hard to measure mayo accuratly, by volume!)

I made it exactly by the recipe and was very happy with the outcome. This will definitely be made in my household again. This turned out much better than I expected it would using 1 cup Mayo, I am glad I followed the recipe.

I used the small can of tuna and a couple tablespoons of mayo.  Onion powder instead of onion  to save some time.  Then put sliced avocados on the bread before the tuna.  Husband LOVED this!

I only used about 1/4 cup of mayo. I also had no onion. It was good this way! Cheap and yummy. It is an easy after work dinner. It isn't a favorite of the kids here, but it will do when they are hungry.

We lose the onion, add some pickle relish to the tuna, and have a slice of tomato under the cheese, all open-face on English muffins.  Yum!

For some reason, I've never had a tuna melt before and I'm 24 years old.  My 4 year old son had been begging me for tuna all week so I got online and found this recipe.  It was delicious!  I used 2 heaping tablespoons of mayo and I love sweet onion so I was a bit generous.  I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste and threw it in the oven.  I didn't have mozarella so I used provolone.  I turned on the broiler until the cheese was melted and bubbly.  I will definitely be making this again.  Yum!

I didn't have mozzarella so I used shredded cheddar cheese and it was quite good! I hesitantly added diced cucumbers and it turned out well, added a little crunch. I bet these would also be good with provolone cheese. A great easy summer dinner.

I only used a half of an onion because of picky eaters but it was really good. To add a little extra nutrition I used a multigrain french bread. And I did as well as others top with sliced tomatoes and a bit of cheese.
