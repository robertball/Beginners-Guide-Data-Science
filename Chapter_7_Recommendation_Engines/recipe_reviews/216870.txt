These porkchops and potatoes are fab. Excellent, perky flavour, combined with a nice salad, it's a lovely meal.

I used red potatoes cut into pieces and dried herbs for this and it turned out beautifully.  I can't wait for garden potatoes and herbs to be ready so I can try this as written!  Thanks for a great recipe Don.

The potatoes were the best part of this meal...very lovely flavors when roasted in the oven. I didn't have the cardamom pods, so omitted that ingredient. My pork chops had a good flavor, but the meat was on the dry side. Next time I would put the chops on top of the potatoes and cover with foil to try and keep the juices in. No comment from my husband, which means it was just OK. We love pork chops, so this recipe might just fade away.

I only made the pork chops part of this recipe. Such an easy recipe to put together and so tasty! Great food with minimal effort = 5 stars recipe! My husband liked it too and that is an added plus! Will be making this again soon. Will try with the potatoes next time!

These were good for a different way to cook pork.  My husband liked it.

This dish was wonderful.  Husband isn't a huge pork fan so I try to keep his interest with flavorful dishes.  He loved both the chops and the potatoes.  I served with broccoli.  I really liked the fresh ginger and the cardamon.  Thanks, Don, for a delicious recipe.  I will be making this again.

Easy and flavorful! I didn't use the cardamom seeds and had to substitute some dry herbs for fresh, but the potatoes turned out great. The pork could've cooked a little less, but all in all, this is a good dish!

These were fabulous!  My daughter couldn't stop talking about dinner tonight. I have to admit, I was a bit worried about the cumin spice as it can overwhelm most dishes but everything turned out very well. Had minor changes such as using dried herbs (omitting the rosemary as we hate them) to the potatoes. For the pork, I used a tiny dash of ground cardamom and used 1/2 teaspoon of the ground ginger. I found out later, I had fresh ginger after all...I will use fresh next time. Also, I added chopped green onions to the potatoes right before adding the pork because my husband likes green onions on his potatoes, then covered with foil to prevent the pork from drying.

I made this without the cardamon seeds and using dry herbs. I feel like the seeds would have given the meat a better 'spicy' kick and my pieces turned out on the dry side. I even cut the time down when the pork chops were added to the baking sheet and covered it to help retain juices. The potatoes were delicious but my husband and i felt like it was missing something. Altogether this was a tasty quick meal for the ingredients we had on hand.

Thanks for sharing this recipe. It was VERY good. I just cooked the chops. I didn't have the cardamom pods. I used didn't have fresh ginger so I used ground ginger. I can't imagine if I would have all the ingredients how amazing this marinade would have been. I would give it 10 stars if I could. BTW I can't imagine it being better. I will definitely be using all the ingredients listed next time.
