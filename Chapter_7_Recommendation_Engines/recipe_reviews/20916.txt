I made this for the first time for a work function and everyone loved it.  I did make a few changes to the recipe after reading some of the other reviews.  I preheated the oven at 350 and gave the cressiant roles about a 7 minute head start.  I also increased the amount of eggs to a total of 10 and added 3/4 of a cup of milk.  Also I used Italian Seasoning instead of Oregeno.  I baked the casserole at 350 for 25 minutes and then lowered the temperature to 325 for the last 20 minutes and the eggs set perfectly.  I will definitly make this again, but I might try sage sausage instead of the maple Jimmy Dean sausage that I used.  Also I cut the cheese to a total of two cups instead of four and used a blend of cheeses.

Really Good!!  I made a few changes recomended by others.  I used 10 eggs, 2 cups cheese (1 cheddar, 1 mozzarella), 3/4 cup milk and 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning.  I also pre-cooked the crescent crust and added red peppers to the sausage while it browned.  There were not leftovers to take home!!

I have made this many, many times now for all kinds of events. I get asked for the recipe all the time.

It does seem to need some extra time to cook (especially if it is refrigerated overnight before baking, like I do). One easy way I have found to determine if it is done is to bake it in a glass pan. When the cresent roll dough is no longer sticking all over the base of the pan and forms air pockets in between, it's done. 

ENJOY! You will love this recipe.

Made this for Christmas brunch 2004. I used: 1 pound crumbled bacon, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, 1 cup cheddar cheese, 1 cup milk, 10 eggs. I put the bacon right in to the milk and egg mixture. Gave the crescent rolls a 5 minute head start in oven before pouring mixture over them. I baked at 350 (had other things baking) for 40 minutes and it turned out absolutely PERFECT, LOOKED PHENOMINAL,TASTED DELICIOUS  and was so easy. As others mentioned, adding other omlette ingredients could only make a great dish even greater. Thanks to all reviewers who helped me perfect this dish for my family! A TRUE KEEPER in the world of throw out!!

The casserole turned out perfect.  I used mild italian pork sausage with 10 eggs, 3/4 cup of milk, and only 1 cup each of cheese like others suggested, and thought that was the perfect combination.  Any more cheese I think would be too much.  Also, I think that its a good idea to bake the crescent roll for about 6-8 min first before putting in the egg mixture.  Over all, this recipe was wonderful.  My younger brother loved it, and he is a picky eater.  I'm looking forward to making it for Thanksgiving and Christmas morning!

Very good and easy breakfast casserole.
As others suggested I used 10 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, and reduced to 2 cups cheese plus a little extra to sprinkle on top. I did use the oregeno and I thought it was a surprisingly nice addition.  Also pre baked the crescent base for 6 min at 350 added sausage/egg mixture and cooked at 325 for 30 min.  This recipe will replace my old breakfast casserole recipe.

This was absolutely one of the BEST breakfast casseroles I've ever had!  I didn't have oregano...but I did have Italian Seasoning and I used it instead, and it flavored the casserole beautifully.  I also added about 1 to 1 1/2 tsp of salt as well.  Next time I might try sauteing a little green pepper and onion with the sausage and using Mexican Cheese Blend for a more southwestern flair.  My co-workers thank you for sharing this recipe!

This recipe was delicious and a hit with my guests!  Numerous people asked for the recipe which is always a compliment.  I followed the advice of other reviews and increased the eggs to 10, added 3/4 cup of milk, used bacon instead of sausage, reduced the cheese to 2 cups, used a 1/2 tsp. of Italian seasoning and a dash of salt and pepper.  I also pre-heated the crust for approx. 10 minutes in my stoneware.  It was so yummy!  I'm making it again this week for a brunch.

This recipe is okay. Not anything to get excited about though. It lacks flavor. The crust is the best part...but, it's basically just a ton of cheese. The oregano is a bad attempt at adding flavor.  The best egg/sausage casserole I've tried on All Recipes is http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Sausage-Casserole/Detail.aspx.  Check that one out instead.

I made this for work.  Everyone loved it!  I fried the sausage the night before and the rest went together quickly in the morning.  I also added 2/3 cup of milk.  It helps make the eggs less dense.  I think next time I will use 1 to 2 cups of milk though.

This dish is very good. You can omit or add to your perference. It is easy to make and can be done the night before you cook it. Some reviewers didn't care for the crescent. You can use loaf bread cut in pieces. Thank you for sharing!

This FLEW off the pan. I made it for co-workers and you WILL get requests for the recipe. I followed others' suggestions. Changed the # of eggs, add the milk, LESS cheese, let it sit over night in the fridge before I baked @ 6:30AM. I baked the crescent rolls for 5 min, I made the sausage the night before and put it in the fridge, just heated up for 1 min in the morning and threw it in the pan. Came out just fine. I poured the egg/milk/cheese mixture pver the sausage and I sprinkled with italian seasoning. NO oregeno. I dont like it. The was amazing.

I served this for Christmas breakfast, and everyone *loved* it. I followed advice of some of the other reviewers: used 10 eggs instead of 8, added 1/2 milk to the egg mixture, used Italian seasoning instead of oregano, and cooked the crescent rolls for about 5 minutes before adding the remaining ingredients. Yum!

I made this with the 10 eggs & 3/4 cup of milk like other reviewers mentioned.  I also pre-cooked the roll for 6 minutes at 350 then everything at 325 for 20 min and then 350 for 15.  It came out perfect.  It was gone almost as soon as I put it out at the office.  I also substituted peperjack cheese for the mozzarella.

This is a staple recipe for my Christmas Morning Brunch.  I make three varieties, including egg/bacon/cheddar cheese; egg/cheddar cheese, and egg/feta/spinach.  For the egg/feta/spinach, just eye-ball the amount of cheese and drain one frozen box of chopped spinach.  This is always the first to go!

I'm a fairly new cook and a soon-to-be mother. I'm easily intimidated by recipes with a bunch of seasonings because of my unfamiliarity with them. If something goes wrong with the seasonings in the recipe, I won't take the time to fix it.  I was impressed by the simplicity and room for creativity in this recipe. I'm a huge fan of breakfasty foods and cheese, and I found satisfaction for both of those tastes came hand-in-hand in your recipe. The simplicity of it allows more experienced cooks to add and change whatever they would like, yet keeps it easy for the new cooks like me. I absolutely loved how this turned out, how easy it was to make, and the fact that it's simple so that, next time, I might be able to add a bit of my own flair to it.  I wish I would have read the other reviews earlier, though. I would have used two more eggs. I needed to cook it longer than the recommended time and added milk to the eggs and cheese, but other than that, I followed the recipe to a "t" and it tasted great.  The reason for four stars is simply because I'm a new chef and don't have many other recipes to compare it to. I can say it's the best breakfast bake I've had yet, but I've only tried three. I think I'll be adding Italian seasoning and two eggs next time as recommended by some of the others.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us, so that I can share its great product with my family!

You definitely need to increase the cooking time, or set the oven to 350 degrees -- otherwise the eggs don't set and it comes out runny.  I added  chopped fresh asparagus, finely sliced green onions and a couple of shots of hot sauce.  I also used sweet Italian sausage and it came out delicious.

Absolutely Scrumptious!!!  I did the 10 eggs, reduced cheese to 2 cups - used taco cheese, sauteed onions, green peppers and garlic, and also added mild green peppers!  My picky grandson even liked it!  Keeper!  Thank you!

I just made 1/2 recipe using an 8x8 pan.
 I did not use oregano and I added two sliced fresh mushrooms and 1 sliced green onion and a little salt and pepper. I used "Jimmy Dean regular flavor 50% less fat" sausage, but used whole fat cheese. Hubby loved it and so did I. I do think it could be "kicked up a notch"- so maybe I will use hot sausage next time...(but of course "old people" need more flavor)!
Bottom Line -I will make again, and it is good - if you follow the directions! and don't mess around by adding more eggs and milk etc.!(My gas oven baked it just right at 30 min. in a glass pan).

I made this recipe for my team's morning tennis match and there was not a crumb left! I made it the night before, baked the crescent for 7 min. at 350, cooked the sausage and sprinked on and stored it in the fridge. I mixed the eggs (10) w/SHARP CHEDDAR cheese & 3/4 cup milk (as others suggested)and stored that mixture in fridge.  I waited to pour the egg mixture on in the morning before baking.  It needed about 35 min. at 350 (since I used 10 eggs)& it came out perfectly!  I like the crescent crust better than other recipes (like bread or hashbrowns).

This was a really nice recipe. However, the second time I made it I followed some of the recommendations of the other cooks. I did pre-bake the crust/rolls and added 2 extra eggs. I also skipped the oregano and added some red and green peppers AND let it bake for an extra 10 minutes. It was a lot better this way. Everyone loved this. This is a great way to feed a lot of hungry people without a big lot of effort. I will definitely be making this again!

My new favorite breakfast casserole. Like other reviewers, I cooked the dough before preparation (the recommended 8 minutes was a little long, will reduce it to 6 next time). I also found that 35 minutes wasn't enough. Eggs in the middle were still runny at 35, but 40-45 minutes should do the trick. Great Christmas morning or brunch addition. Save this one!

This is really easy and pretty good~!  I used 9inch pie instead of 9x13 for the test run.  I also followed the changes other reviewers had made, but cut down the cheese to 1-1/2 cups, eggs to around 7 (I used some egg substitute) and milk to 2/3 cup to fit 9inch pie.  I had some left over crescent dough, so I used muffin tin to make individual little ones.  It turned out really cute and my kids loved it~! I cut down the cooking time for muffin tins--20 minutes in 350 degree oven because the top started to brown.

Very delicious and a hit at Christmas Eve brunch. Gave it 5 stars although I did make many changes suggested in the reviews: increased to 10 eggs, used Italian seasoning, reduced cheese to 2 cups, baked crescents 5 minutes before adding egg mixture.

This recipe has the potential to be really good. But as is, it isn't 5 stars. You do need to increase the cooking time, but watch it very carefully! The 50 minutes suggested by another reviewer was too long in my oven and the bottom of the crescent dough got overcooked and the cheese on top got crusty. Also, I'd suggest cutting the cheese back to 2 cups and skipping the mozzarella. It was way too much cheese (...even for a cheese lover like myself!). I will try to make this again with some adjustments. Will try adding ham, green peppers, onion and other omelet ingredients rather than just the sausage. Someone also suggested using biscuit dough instead of the crescent dough...I think that's a great idea.

I have been looking for a good breakfast casserole for a while now, and this is the first one I tried and I loved it! I followed the modifications most other reviewers did and it came out absolutely perfect. I also used turkey sausage to make it a little more healthy. I added 3/4 cup milk and only used 1 cup of mozzarella and 1 cup of cheddar, as well as only a 1/2 tsp of italian seasoning (instead of oregano). I baked the crescent rolls first for 7 minutes on 350 and then added the sausage and egg mixture and baked for 25 minutes, then lowered the temp to 325 and baked another 20 minutes and the eggs were perfectly fluffy, with lightly golden crescent rolls on the bottom. Next time I will try some variations and add some veggies like spinach and artichokes! Enjoy!

Easy - Delicious - I followed the recipe and made a few changes as well. I added two more eggs and a 1/4 cup of milk. I made this for a staff breakfast and it was all gone within minutes! Lots of compliments!! The crescent roll bottom was perfect (I did prebake that based on other reviews - so while I browned the meat I had the crescent roll bottom cooking based on the directions for those). The cheese to egg ratio was perfect! I will make this again for sure!!

Pretty good.  A little rubbery, but I think I have bad luck with egg casseroles in general.  I used 10 eggs and half the cheese based on everyone else's recommendations.  I also used reduced fat sausage.  I'd make it again though.

This was really good.  I didn't have any mozzarella so I just doubled the cheddar.   I might leave out the oregano and try another spice next time just for personal preference.  I had to cook it about 35 minutes.  Thanks!

HUGE success! I also revised by adding 2 additional eggs with 3/4 cup of milk and I reduced the cheese to only 2 cups and used a finely shredded Mexican blend. I precooked the crescent base for about 5 minutes and then added the sausage and egg mixture. Turned out perfect and delicious!. Super easy, super quick and not a ton of ingredients so its inexpensive to make! My whole Sunday school devoured it and I got tons of compliments. Great recipe!

I have made this for years, my family demands it for Christmas breakfast.  I have always used biscuits. I use eight eggs beaten with seasoning salt, pour that on the biscuits then the sausage and last just chedder cheese and we like a lot of cheese.  It is best to make it the night before so the eggs soak into the biscuits.  Bake for 45 min at 350.  My kids like to put ranch dressing on it after we put it on their plates and I have found out it is great like that.

I made this recipe as another review mentioned using 10 eggs, 1 cup of each cheese, and 3/4 cups of milk.  I also used biscuit dough instead of crescent rolls (a happy accident) and added canned mushrooms (stems & pieces).  I baked the biscuits on 450C for 10 min. before adding the egg mixture.

It was a big hit at my brunch and many people asked for the recipe.

This was excellent!  I baked it at 350 for 35 minutes instead of what was recommended.  Next time I will add 2 additional eggs, however, it tasted terrific with only 8.  Will definitely make this often!

This is a great recipe, very simple to make and very tasty. I added a little salt and pepper to the eggs and only 3 cups of cheese instead of 4 cups. I also followed someone's suggestion and baked the dough in the preheating oven for 7 minutes before adding the sausage and egg mixture. Very filling and yummy, I have already made this a couple of times and will again.

This was very good ~ I will definitely make it again!  I made a few minor changes: I pressed my crescent rolls on the bottom and a little bit up the sides of the pan, I added 1/2 cup milk to the egg mixture, and I baked for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  There is a TON of cheese in this recipe.  I think I'll try less cheese and more egg next time, along with turkey sausage, for a healthier version.

This recipe turned out great.  I ended up cutting it in half for just my husband and I but still used the same amount of crescent rolls.  I also threw in some spices for flavor.  I agree completely with the reviews that say this was not enough cooking time.  I checked it at 30 minutes and the middle was still moving.  It takes about twice the time, but tasted great when it was done!

I used this basic recipe, with my own additions.  I added some chopped mushrooms to the eggs, and put a single layer of baby spinach leaves over the sausage before pouring the egg mixture.  Baked at 350 for 20 minutes, then 325 for another 20 minutes with good results.  Cool for 5 minutes before serving so the eggs set.

This was very good.  It needs to cook a little longer to make sure it's not runny.  The oregano added a special taste.  Very good, good for company.

This is delicious!  I also pre-baked the crescent rolls for 6-7 minutes.  I cooked the sausage, drained it and then added a chopped onion, chopped spinach and a couple tablespoons of maple syrup.  I used 10 eggs and 1/2 cup milk.  I had to bake it for 35-40 minutes until the eggs were set. 

My family raved about it.

Used 10 eggs and precooked the dough for 7 minutes.  Added real bacon bits and extra seasonings to the egg mixture.  Really great.  Froze the leftovers in individuals servings sizes for a quick breakfast.

Thanks for the feedback folks!  This was awesome.  I pre-baked the crescent rolls for about 6 minutes, added 3/4 C. milk, put in 2 extra eggs (for 10 total), and cut the amount of cheese to 2 cups.  I baked it 20 minutes on 350, and 20 minutes on 325 (my oven runs a bit hot), and it was perfect.  Super easy, super yummy.  This is a permanent addition to my cookbook.

Fabulous!!!  We added green pepper and onion (didn't cook the veggies down beforehand, we just threw them in.)  Very good.  Pair it with the Pecan French Toast and mimosas and BAM! you got brunch.

Made this for Thanksgiving breakfast. Served 6 very nicely. Mixed eggs and cheese the night before, and cooked sausage. Went together in minutes the next day. Not too heavy for breakfast. Served with sweet rolls, hashbrowns and fruit.

This was pretty good.  The only problem we had was the crust part didn't cook (but my husband and I agree that it was probably because our oven is weird).  We added a green bell pepper and some slice mushrooms to the sausage mix.  Next time I will completely precook the veggies cause the liquid from them made the casserole a a bit runny.  I aslo did not use the oregeno, insted I seasoned the egg (before adding to the cheese) with some salt, pepper and garlic)  We served it yesterday at our Easter Brunch and everyone loved it!  And there were 8 of us and there were still 2 pieces left.
Thanks for the recipe!!

I followed other reviewers and used 1C mozzarella and 1C cheddar, 10 eggs and I used a full tsp Italian seasoning. I pre baked the crescent rolls for 6 minutes. This recipie is outstanding! I've tried many egg bakes... The worst being a crock pot version. This is definately my go-to. Only change I would make is to sprinkle cheese over sausage stead of mixing it with eggs and pouring it over. Cheese will be more evenly spread that way.

Very good and easy, I made mine with bacon and instead of the refrigerated bread made it with biscuit mix fr this site, left it at 8 eggs (didnt want it too eggy) and cooked 350, sprinked cheese on top, baked up golden and tastes great.

This was good. Made it with bacon and made the suggested changes. I'm not sure that any one of these egg casseroles is better than the other though. They seem to be pretty much as good as the next one.

Delicious. I used sage-flavored pork sausage, 4 whole eggs and 4 egg whites. I didn't have mozzarella on hand, so I used 2 cups cottage cheese. I didn't give my crescent rolls a head-start like many of the other reviews, but I turned up the heat to 350 and baked it about 30 minutes. It turned out great!

Great basic recipe.  I'm a vegetarian so I substituted soy sausage crumbles and it was yummy. Next time I think I'll add some veggies (green peppers, red peppers, mushrooms, etc.). I served it at a work party and people really liked it.

This was very tasty!  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and baked the crescent rolls for a few minutes before adding the egg mixture.  Also, I added about a half of a jalapeno (finely chopped) pepper and half of an onion to the sausage as it finished cooking.  I sprinkled some Tony Chachere's Cajun seasoning on top (you HAVE to have this in your spice rack!).  Turned out great!!!!

I happened to stumble across this recipe on here today. I have been making this for my Christmas breakfast for at least 10 years! I only use 2 cups of  cheese and I also add about 1/2 cup milk. I precook my sausage the day before. I also add a package of crescent rolls on top of the eggs in addition to the bottom. Pillsbury now has make a crescent roll dough that isn't perforated which made this a cinch to make this year. Mine takes  a minimum 45 minutes to bake. It makes a lot.

This is a great casserole to make for those occassions where you have a large group of people to feed at once. The casserole didn't turn out as light and fluffy as I was hoping for, but it is definitely worth making again. I will use more crescent rolls next time though and possibly more eggs.

This is a great recipe, if you follow the suggestions other reviewers gave. It helps to pre-bake the croissant, I forgot to do that the second time I made it, and it was soggy. I also used 10 eggs and added a splash of milk, and only used about 2 cups of cheese. Delicious even with a slightly soggy bottom, and will make this often!

Everyone's comments were so helpful!  I used a mix of bacon and sausage because that's what was in the fridge.  I sautéed 1/2 chopped onion and about 4 oz sliced Baby Bella mushrooms. Used 10 eggs, 3/4c LF milk, 2 c shr cheddar and about 1 c Mexican 4-cheese (I'll stick to 2 c next time), 1 tsp each garlic powder, dry mustard, salt & pepper, plus a few dashes of Creole seasoning on top of the egg mixture. Used a PChef stoneware pan sprayed with Pam and prebaked the dough for 8 minutes at 350; the casserole took 30-40 minutes (I forget which) to become firm. Definitely a keeper, thanks to all of you :)

I made this recipe for a brunch lately and everyone seemed to like it.  It was Verrrrry cheesy though.  If I did it again I would bake the crescent roll dough by itself for a few minutes (it was kind of soggy on the bottom), increase the number of eggs, add some milk or cream and use about half as much cheese.  My husband really liked the amount of cheese, but it was a very heavy dish for breakfast.  Overall, the combination of the oregano with the seasoning in the sausage was excellent.  Good recipe with a few tweaks.

We've made this recipe twice for guests and it was a big hit both times.  The first time I gave the crescent roll crust a head start in the oven and it turned out better than the second time when I forgot.  When I didn't give the crust a head start, the casserole seemed a little bit soggy.

Good - definetly cook longer, 30-40 minutes in a 350 oven is what I did.  Also, per the comments by reviewers- I revised the recipe a little...... I used half bacon and half sausage (instead of all sausage), 10 eggs, 1/2 cup of milk and added onions to the sausage while it was browning.

I was having a brunch party for friends and family. Unknown to me, my son invited his friends over for a lunch/snack -- cresent rolled hotdogs and chili-cheese fries. Next morning I only had half of each cheese and no cresent rolls... with no time to run to store...I improvised. I used toast on the bottom for the cresent rolls and added 1/2 cup of heavy cream to the eggs and mixed. I also realised that I had bought the "spicy hot" sausage by mistake. Even with all the wrong things happening, this recipe turned out great! I roasted some small cherry tomatoes with a bit of olive oil and fresh basil and some of my guest were eating that on top of this.  I gave this recipe out to several people.. good recipe!I look forward to making it with all the correct ingredients next time ;-)Thanks

I made this for my family for Christmas brunch and I got raves all day. I did put my own twist on it though. I used hot sausage instead of the regular and I used jalapeno jack cheese instead of the cheddar. I also added some leftover asparagus bits. The asparagus added great flavor and some color. Fast, easy and feeds a lot of people. I found if you lightly grease the dish with cooking oil (I used olive) that the crossant crust comes out flakier...

Excellent base recipe for egg and sausage casserole! These were my changes and it came out perfect... Pre baked croissant 7 min. Used 10 eggs, 1/2 cup sour cream (makes the eggs fluffier) 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning instead of oregano, a couple shakes each of ground black pepper garlic pepper and cayenne pepper. Beat with hand mixer for 2 min then folded in 1 cup of each cheese, sausage and 1/4 cup sweet onion sautéed in 1 tbs butter. Baked for 25 min at 350 then 20 min at 325. Eggs came out perfectly cooked and the croissant was golden brown and flakey. Family loved it!

Absolutely great. Served at a going away brunch and everyone loved it and had seconds. I made the recipe as is and it was delicious. Several people asked for the recipe. Served with lots of mimosas, rosemary roasted potatoes and fresh fruit. Absolutely will  make again.

In the oven now. Baked crescent for 7 minutes then added sausage with bell pepper and onion and bacon. Some maple syrup on top of the meat, 10 eggs, 3/4 cup of milk, some butter and 2 cups of chesse. Topping it off with sliced cherry tomatoes. Smells good!

It was very good. I used 10 eggs and 3/4 cup of milk like others said and the Italian seasonings.  It just took forever to cook. But everyone loved it. You need to have a big family though. It's just my boyfriend and I, so I took the rest to my parents house, and they devoured it.

I modified the recipe based on some other reviews.
I made a smaller version in a 9x9 pan; used 5 egss, a bit of 1/2 and 1/2 and much less cheese - about a cup or cup and 1/2. I used a mix of 6 cheese Italian, mozzarella and a small amount of parmesan. I used about 1/2 tsp of oregano and it could have used a bit more.  Jimmy Dean sausage crumbles made this a snap to put together.  I love onions & peppers in almost any egg dish, so I sauteed some and added them.  Agree the crescent rolls make this! Husband LOVED it and wants it in the regular weekend breakfast rotation.

The crescent dough really makes this casserole delicious! I added two extra eggs, a little bit of milk, and garlic. The casserole was not ready in 30 minutes - I had to leave it in for about 45-50 minutes before it completely set.

This is a delicious easy to make casserole.  I probably make it 3-4 times a month for weekend breakfasts.  It is easy to half the recipe by using the 4 oz pkg crescent rolls.  Perfect for my husband and I but also good reheated the next day. Thank you for sharing!

Recipe as-is only gets 4 stars, but when I tried it a second time using the suggestions in the reviews, it gets 5 stars.  Was delicious with the Italian seasoning, and I liked the addition of 1/8 tsp of salt.  Cooking the crescent rolls for 7 minutes and going up to 10 eggs made a great improvement.  First go wasn't bad, but you'll definitely want to take the suggestions if you want something that you'll eat every bite of.  ;)

Needs more eggs.  I could barely taste the eggs, but I used biscuits instead of cresant rolls.  The biscuits taste better I just have to at about 12 eggs for it to be good.

I made this recipe for Christmas breakfast and added the additional ten (10) eggs as another reviewer suggested. I cooked the casserole accordingly and then had to take it to the family gathering. A family member suggested that we put the casserole in the oven with covered tin foil on 300 degrees in order to re-heat the dish (which was just fine IMHO). DO NOT DO THIS!!! It burnt the crescent roll bottom layer and I was not a happy camper. Needless to say everyone loved the top layering however the burnt bottom ruined the dish. I will definitely make this recipe again because I know it can be wonderful cooked properly!

I made a few revisions to fit my taste. I halved the recipe and added 1 extra egg, 1/2 can diced green chilis, and 2 cups of Mexican style cheese instead. I also baked the crescent roll crust for about 8 minutes to make sure it was crispy when it was finished. It was very tasty! Thanks for the great base recipe!

Excellent!  I served this at a last-minute family brunch and eveyone loved it!  I did add 2 more eggs, a splash of milk (maybe 1/4 cup) and 1 tsp dry mustard.  I also used sage sausage and then pre-baked the crust for 6 mins as several others suggested.  I will definitely be making this dish again, it flew off the table. My only regret was that I didn't make two!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a good breakfast casserole.  Used Sage sausage to give it an extra kick!  Did bake it about 50 minutes, crust turned out nice and crunchy!!  My husband gave this one two thumbs up and I agree!

I used this recipe on Thanksgiving when I couldn't find my usual egg and sausage bake casserole.  As others suggested, I added a small amount of milk and increased my eggs to a dozen.  I also added some dry mustard (one ingredient that I could remember from my recipe), dried parsley and garlic powder.  I didn't particularly care for the crescent roll crust, but everyone thought it delicious...so I am in the minority.

I took the previous reviewers advice and used 10 eggs, a bit of milk (I think I used 1/4 c, less cheese and prebaked the crescent rolls for 6 minutes.  Even with the added time for the rolls, it still needed a longer cooking time.  I guess it was about 10 minutes longer...I just waited until it was not jiggly at all (especially in the middle) and it turned out really moist!

I made this for a graduation brunch and prepared the sausage (I used turkey sausage) and the egg mixture two days ahead.  I kept them seperate and precooked the crust, as suggested in the morning and assembled and baked.  It was very popular. I will make this again.

I needed to use up some crescent roll dough and this recipe made an excellent family breakfast.  I didn't have sausage on hand so I used diced ham which is preferred by my kids anyway.  I used 8 eggs and maybe cut back a bit on the cheese.  I also prebaked the rolls a bit as previously suggested.  Everyone like it.

Wow. I made this for Easter brunch and it's definetly a keeper. I kept it "kid-friendly" using only sausages, up'd it to 10 eggs and eyeballed some milk. I added a tblsp of dry mustard and salt and pepper. I left out the oregano and threw a couple dashes of Emeril's Essence. Preheating the dough was a really good suggestion from all the reviewers. That definetly helps. Two cups of cheese was plenty and I had to give the dish an extra 10 minuetes to cook.

This was good on the first bite but by the third I was feeling sick.  It was way too salty...probably due to the sausage and tons of cheeses.  If I made it again I would probably use more eggs and less cheeses.

This is the easiest recipe!  I made it Christmas morning.  I did tweak it a little bit...
I removed the crescents all together.  Instead of a 9x13 I used 12 (star shaped) muffins tins ( baked 30 min.).  This way if people could eat the egg/ sausage cup as is or on an English muffin.  People loved the option.  Will do again!  Great for groups!

did a test run of this... turned out great.  I'm making this for x-mas morning.  Will cut in 1/2 though (for 2 of us).  I cooked onions with the sausage ahead of time, and cooked the crescent rools for about 8 min (as suggested) before adding the rest of the ingredients & cooking for about 30 min.

Simple and delicious is right.  The only things I did differently was I baked it at 350 degrees and I sprinkled garlic powder on the crust to counter act the sweeter taste of the crescent rolls.  This is also good warmed up the next day.

This recipe is very good.  I use about 3 cups of cheese instead of 4.  I also substitute sage-flavored sausage (Jimmy Dean) for extra flavor.

Cheese/egg mixture is THICK with just 8 eggs. So I used 4 more (large eggs). Was still pretty thick but spreadable. I sprinkled a bit of sage on the crescent dough before adding the sausage.  I think next time I will add chopped green onions and diced tomatoes to this and see how it is. This is a good one to let kids help! With all the egg cracking and the cheese adding it kept them busy while I cooked the sausage. Them helping made them love this one all the more!  :) 
Thank you LeAnn!

Add a little flavor to the recipe by using italian sausage and adding 1/4 cup ranch dressing.

I also add celery salt.

I baked it in a stone deep dish pie plate and the egg mixture must have leaked under the crust.  The crust floated up into the center of the dish.  It looked a little funky but the taste was great.  I'll try the right pan next time.

This recipe I could tell would be good but there was just WAY too much sausage - it overpowered the egg and also the crescent roll crust. I would make this recipe again with half as much meat and then I'm sure it would be perfect.

Everyone enjoyed it! I saved some sausage to combine in the egg mixture, and some cheese for the top layer - adding appeal to my  egg- hating kid. *And, watch the  Video first. It  contains obvious but important tips. Such as,  cook the crescent roll crust a bit before covering it with egg/cheese mixture. That's intuitive to me- BUT since I follow recipes to the letter the first time (!), I'm darn glad I watched ....

I sautéed one medium onion with the sausage.  I followed others and  1) used 10 eggs and 3/4 cup milk 2) baked the crescent rolls 7 minutes ahead and 3) baked the casserole at 350 for 25 minutes and then lowered the temperature to 325 for the last 20 minutes, 4) I cut the cheese to a little over 1 cup instead of four and used Mexican cheese blend.  I made two casseroles: for the first I made as above.  For the second, I boiled six potatoes ahead of time, let them cool, and then grated them into the bottom of the dish with a little salt and pepper.  Both came out great and are easy ways to feed a crowd!

A big hit at brunch! BUT did make changes according to another reviewer: increase number of eggs (10-12), add 3/4c milk, reduce cheese to a total of 2 cups. For cooking, bake crescent crust alone for 5-7min at 350, then add other ingredients and bake for 25 min at 350, then reduce temp to 325 and bake an additional 20 min.

I make this recipe pretty often and it's really simple and delicious. I'm leaving a review because so many reviews are people stating that they cook the crescent rolls on their own first. Don't do that! Make this recipe as written. The egg mixture with the crescent rolls turns into the most amazing texture after baking. I feel like if you bake the crescent roll layer on it's own first, you won't get the flavor that you will in the original recipe. Try this as written, it's wonderful!!

My husband has taken this to work twice now; within an hour after the first time he was asked for the recipe. The second time out, he decided to bring two so he wouldn't hear the complaints about not getting any. It's a really easy recipe, I cook the sausage the night before and that makes putting it together and cooking it only takes about 45 minutes in the morning.

Used 10 eggs, Italian seasoning, and 3/4 cup milk.  Also used 1 cup cheddar, 1 cup mozzarella, 1/2 lb turkey sausage and 1/2 cup pork sausage.  Baked crescent roll x 6 min at 350, then casserole x25min at 350, then 10 min at 325.  Slightly burnt, next time will bake 25-30min at 350 after baking crescent roll x 6min

Pre-bake the crescents for 6-7mins @ 350, then add everything else.  We did spicy breakfast sausage, green chiles and green onions. We didn't add any milk to the eggs, and it was very dense.  Next time, we'll add milk and maybe even cottage cheese to the egg whip to get it "fluffier". And as many have said, you def don't need 4 cups of cheese.  We used some pepper jack and a 2% mexi blend, and used a little less than 2 c total.  Next time I'd do the full 2 cups.  Baked it, uncovered, at 350 for about 40 mins. Mmm Mm good.

Definitely read the advice of other reviewers before making this dish. There are enough changes in order to make this successful that it almost becomes a totally different recipe! I was excited to try w/crescent roll dough and was initially surprised that the recipe didn't require cooking the dough a bit before pouring over the sausage and then the egg mixture. Also surprised at the amount of cheese and the low cook time and temp.  My thoughts were confirmed when the dough ended up floating above most of the egg mixture and we had a whole layer of raw dough near the top.  I almost doubled the cook time, increased to 350/375...put in 25% more eggs, 25% less cheese and adding some half/half.  No offense to the recipe author, but this should really be rewritten as to not mislead people. So glad this was just for my immediate family and not for an event so I have time to adjust before I try it again. Many other brunch recipes that are far better...but it was an interesting experiment!

I am reviewing this actual recipe, not adding milk and eggs then reviewing this recipe. The recipe is good as is. It is done in 30 minutes, doesn't need milk or 2 extra eggs. Here is what people are doing wrong in this recipe 1. They are over baking it. Cook it 30 minutes, pull it out and let it set. 2. They are using pre shredded cheese. You need to shred the cheese off the block. Two full blocks. 3. They have thier ovens too hot. 4. They  are complaining about the flavor. Its eggs, cheese and sausage. That is what it tastes like. 5. They are flat out ignoring the recipe.

This is a very easy, quick & delicious recipe.  I too used 10 eggs as other reviewers suggested plus 3/4 cup milk.  I made some Texan modifications.....I nixed the oregano, but added one small can (8oz) green chilies  and substituted spicy sausage in place of the regular. I also used only 2 cups of cheese. I bumped the cook time to 425 & cooked for 20 minutes. My crescent roll was cooked without any pre baking.  Delicious!!!

This recipe is more of a cheesy egg than egg with cheese casserole.  I have tried this recipe two different ways, both are great.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out well.  The crescent roll was even baked up - where when I add more milk and eggs it doesn't because the liquid will bake into the crescent roll.  This casserole is more of a cheesy casserole that will favor towards children.  The other time I made this was by adding 10 eggs, cutting the cheese in half and adding milk as suggested by the reviews.  The casserole was great this way too. If you like more egg, add more egg, if you want to try a kid friendly cheesy version, keep the recipe as is.

Only gave 3 stars because you MUST make changes for this to turn out well, and after you make the changes... it's a different and great recipe. Used 10 eggs, 3/4 cup milk, 2 Cups cheese. Baked for 40 mins to get the eggs to set up.

Made this for Sunday breakfast this morning...OUTSTANDING.  I did take the advice of several previous reviewers and used 10 eggs, 1 cup of cheddar cheese and 1 cup of mozzarella...that was plenty.  I also baked about 50 minutes.  I can't wait to make again...thinking of subbing ham, bacon, spicy sausage, and/or hash browns for the crescent roll.  Thanks for a great base recipe.

We made the modifications in the reviews (10 eggs, 3/4 cup milk, Italian seasoning, 1 cup of each cheese, etc), but found the result only "okay".  Given that ingredient list and health content, it should taste a lot better than that.

Great recipe! I served it at a brunch and everyone loved it. I did add in the tweaks other reviewers suggested, like more eggs and milk and I reduced the cheese to 3 cups of fiesta style cheese. It does take about 40-50 minutes for the eggs to completely set.

This recipe is really good...and really easy!  I meant to add milk as the other reviewers mentioned, but I forgot and it still turned out yummy!  Next time I make it I will add the milk and some chopped onions (would also add green peppers if my hubby liked them).  I used 9 eggs and it turned out great. I like how you can add whatever ingrediants you want.  Great basic recipe to do that.  My husband poured salsa on the top of his and rated the recipe an "A-" as did I.  So pretty great rating for first time making it!

I also followed the directions to bake in the oven at 350 for 25 min. and gave the crescent roles about a 7 minute head start. I increased the amount of eggs to a total of 10 and added 3/4 of a cup of milk. I baked at 325 but mine only needed 10 min. and not 20. I substituted pork sausage for venison breakfast sausage and seasoned it with onion, garlic, and mesquite seasoning. I will make this recipe again it was wonderful. I just wish it was a little more doughy.

I loved this recipe and of course altered it to fit my own tastes!  I doubled the sausage...used 1 cup sharp 1 cup goat gouda 1 cup mozzarella and 1 cup mild.  I mixed it all together and just poured on top and baked!  This is also done well with leftover ham chunks or bacon!  This was breakfast christmas morning!!

This is the easiest, most delicious, breakfast casserole!  I did what many others did and precooked my crescent rolls about 6 minutes in the oven, and I also cut my cheese in half.  I love cheese, but four cups of it is a lot!  I made this for dinner one night and had the leftovers for breakfast the next day.  This casserole reheats surprisingly well.

Very good base casserole.  I did as others suggested and used 10 eggs, 3/4 cup milk, other Italian seasonings and baked the crescent rolls for about 5 minutes by themselves.  Also added bag of hashbrowns.  Cooked at 375 for about 20 minutes and then 350 for about 20 more.  Next time, I think I will double the crescent roll layer.

I had a house full of people and needed something quick to make for breakfast.  Overall everyone really liked a somewhat modified version.  I followed many others suggestion and cooked the crescent rolls for 5 minutes first.  When cooking the sausage I added some sage, salt, pepper, and onions.  I mixed up 8 jumbo eggs with 3/4 c. of milk and three cups of colby jack cheese.  (Next time I'm cutting back even futher on the cheese and adding two more eggs).  Total cooking time took approaximately 35 minutes.  Thanks for giving us a great recipe that is easlily customizable to our tastes.  Next time I'm going to through in some sauted mushrooms too!

I'm rating this based on changes I made which were suggested by a large number of others' reviews. I also used 10 eggs and 2/3 c milk and baked the crust for 7 minutes before adding the remaining ingredients. This was wonderful with these changes; four cups of cheese would have been way too much. I would have given this only 3 stars if made as originally written, but I want others to enjoy this recipe with the changes.

I made this for a brunch and everybody seemed to enjoy it as there were few leftovers. It slices very cleanly from the pan (I followed prev. reviewer suggestions to bake crescent rolls for about 7min first before adding sausage, etc). However, I found it lacking something in the way of flavor. Perhaps using spicy or sage sausage next time will help? I'll definitely play around with this recipe again!

WOW!  This recipe was pretty good and was gone by the end of breakfast.  I used the 10 eggs and put my convection oven up to the 350 for 25 minutes,  I then lowered the temp to 320 and stood watch until the top began to brown, roughly about 6 minutes.  Being an avid cheese lover, I certainly couldn't cut the cheese down, I probably added more, but used swiss cheese and cheddar.  I'm sure I used about 5 - 6 cups of pure cheesy goodness.  I didn't think it was going to turn out well based on what it looked like when it went into the oven, but it came out awesome!  everyone loved it on Easter morning.

Awesome and easy to make. I added some chopped green onions and chopped red pepper to the sausage when it was almost done,increased the eggs to 10 and added about 1/4 of milk. Fantastic!  Next time I might add shallots and sundried tomatoes, or mushrooms or roasted red peppers... the possibilities are endless.

Have made this for years have always known it as breakfast pizza. The only difference is my recipe calls for hash browns with red bell pepper and onions fried in it. Try it it gives it a lot of kick.

for special occasions i usually order quiche from a gourmet shop in town. i will never do that again because this recipe was so easy and delicious! i took the advise from previous reviews and used less cheese and more eggs. i also used hot italian sausage because that is what i had available. next time i'm going to mix it up a bit and use swiss cheese and bacon. thanks so much for the posting!!

Wonderful recipe!  Made this Christmas Eve to have on Christmas morning.  Everybody loved it!  I did as others suggested and used 10 eggs and 1/4 cup milk.  I went ahead and made the night before, covered with foil and refrigerated, then reheated in a the oven at 250 degrees for approximately 1 hour.  I also added about 1/2 cup red peppers and 1/4 cup finely chopped onions.  Excellent!

I made this for Christmas day breakfast. I changed this receipe up a bit to give it a 5 star rating.  I did prebake the crust first for about 7 minutes before adding ingredients. I also added cheese on top after the eggs were done setting and this was in addition to the cheese called for in the recipe.  I added 10 eggs, hot pepper flakes, I used Jimmie Dean Sage sausage, New Orleans Cajun Spice, salt and pepper, oregano, italian seasonings.  I also saute' a green pepper and onion and fresh garlic and added that also to the eggs.  Living in New Orleans, I highly season my food to give it a kick.  I used a blend of different cheeses, mozzarella, Italian Cheese blend and Mexican Cheeses.  Next time I will drain a can of Mexican Style Rotel tomatoes to give it a further kick.

Great, simple breakfast casserole! Everyone seemed to enjoy it. I used a few more eggs and cut the cheese in half. I also prebaked the crust for about 7 minutes based on reviews. A keeper!

I made this casserole for our Mother's Day brunch.  My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the suggestions and added 2 more eggs and 3/4 cup of milk.  I only put 1 cup each of the cheeses.  I also baked the crescent rolls for about 7 minutes before adding the egg mixture.  Very good!

This casserole was devoured.  I also made a few changes suggested by prev. reviewers.  I baked the cresent rolls for 7 min before adding mixture, used 10 eggs and half the cheese. Also, served salsa on the side.  It was great.

This was an excellent recipe.  I made it for New Year Day breakfast.  My husband is very picky, but he loved it.  I only had the spicy sausage.  It really gave it a nice kick.  I offered salsa and sour cream on the side.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks.

LOVE IT!!! Sunday morning breakfasts in my family are a big thing, and this is quickly becoming a BIG TIME favorite!Make sure you use higher quality breakfast sausage.  I bought a generic off brand, and it seemed to be a little too greasy when I cooked it in the casserole.

I halved this recipe using 5 eggs and a whole pkg of the croissants, layering as follows:  half of the croissant dough, 1/2 lb sausage, half of the egg/cheese mixture, 4 sandwich size slices of sharp cheddar, the other half of croissant dough, and then the rest of the eggs.  Even though I halved the recipe, it still took almost an hour for the eggs to cook completely.  This was good, but definitely not good for you!

I made this last year for my son's "Rock N' Roll Breakfast Bash" and it was a HUGE hit!  It was asked for again this year.  I made 3.  One w/sausage, one with bacon bits and one with tomatoes, chilis and black olives.  They were all gobbled down quite quickly, especially the last one!

Absolutely delicious!!!  Took the suggestions and used 10 eggs, 3/4 cup milk, and only 1 cup of cheese.  Also used both oregano and Italian seasoning.  This was a WONDERFUL breakfast, and wasn't to bad reheated!

I make this for guests all the times and the compliments just keep on coming.  I usually cook it 5 or 10 minutes longer, since I can't tell if the liquid is just cheese grease or if its uncooked egg.  Better safe than sorry!!!  I skipped the oregano once and man, was that a mistake.

Ok...I have a granddaughter who hates eggs, but loves sausage and cheese.  She was visiting me when I talked here into "trying something new".  She had some of this and immediately called her mother and told her that she ate some eggs.  Needless to say, I'm sure she loved the sausage and cheese too.  

I used the large size crescent rolls (seemed to cover the pan easier) and added extra eggs.  I've made it with and without the oregano and like it better with.  I'll have to try it with the milk though.  I generally have to cook it an extra 10 minutes.  

I have a regular potluck I go to once a month and this is an expected dish.  Definitely a keeper.

This tasted good, but I gave it a four because it took SO long to cook.  I followed the recipe exactly and cooked this for Father's Day.  It was really disappointing that everyone was waiting around hungry because this had to keep cooking.

Totally loved this.  We have a huge Sunday brunch each week and always looking for creative ideas.  We have 6 kids living here and all but 1 loved it.  I added 2 extra eggs per dish and sauted onions first.  Next time I'll try adding spinach and bacon.  The oregano, makes the dish unexpectedly even better.  I also precooked the crust for about 6-8 mins before adding the egg mixture.  Just awesome!!

I substituted cut up link breakfast sausage and cooked one chopped onion down and several cloves of garlic with it. I also used low-fat cresent rolls as well, but it may come out more pastry like if the regular ones were used. I added several more eggs as well. This recipe hapilly fed family that was in from out of town...with even some to spare.

What more can I say... husband and children loved it. 5 yr old covered it in ketchup, but she does that with all of her food. She's extremely picky though and she ate it all up! Like other reviewers I cut cheese to 2 total cups, added 3/4 cups milk and substituted italian seasoning for the oregano. Baked crescent roll bottom in 350 oven for 6 min, then baked whole casserole for 30-35 min. and it was PERFECT. Mother-In-Law makes a similar egg casserole but this is MUCH better. Will definitely make this again. Worked great for easy, inexpensive and crowd-pleasing dinner with small side salad and veggie.

This was great.  Everyone at church loved it.  I used 10 eggs instead of 8 and added 3/4 cup milk.  I also cut down on the cheese - used 1 cup each.  Also added onion and mushroons to sausage when I cooked it.  Added a little salt and pepper also.

I made this in individual cups for a morning golf outing. Everybody loved them. For single servings use 2 pkgs of rolls and 4 more eggs. This will yield 16 servings.  Bake as recipe suggests checking after 23 minutes to be sure you don't overcook.

Very good casserole.  I followed other suggestions and pre-baked the crust.  I also added more eggs and deleted 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese.

Very good recipe!  I added two more eggs and I used 2c Sharp cheddar and 1c Pepper jack.  I also put the crescent roll crust in the oven about 8 minutes before adding the filling.  Very hardy weekend breakfast, thank you LeAnn!

We love this but I did make a couple changes to suit my family and what I had on hand. I used a mexican blend of cheese (no spices in it) instead of the mozz and cheddar. I think any cheese you like would work. I added a little milk, maybe 1/4 cup, salt & pepper and did not put the oregano in. Made this for company many times and always gets rave reviews.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly, even though I try to do low carb.  Now, I just omit the crescent roll dough (it didn't do much for me, anyway).  Sometimes I use chopped kielbasa if that's what I have on hand.  This recipe has a very high cheese-to-egg ratio; I've never had problems with it being runny.

This is a family favorite. I've passed it along to many people who love it as much as we do. It seems to work better for me if I make it the evening before.

This has become a huge family favorite!  I did make a few changes. I used two packages of crescent rolls to help balance out all the egg and cheese on the top.  Also i used 1 1/2lb of sage sausage to increase the flavor.  Definitely add salt and pepper to the egg mixture.  Super easy and super yummy!

Yummy!  I used a pound of cooked crumbled bacon, which worked great!  I also omitted the oregano.  The casserole baked up almost like "bars" using the bacon...very different!  Almost quiche like.  The sausage is very tasty too!

Did not like this recipe. It took much longer  than the 30 minutes for the eggs to set. The bottom and sides were starting to burn. Bland tasting.

This recipe is a big hit in my family!  The first time I made it was for a Christmas brunch.  There are never any leftovers, no matter how much I make.  I also add mushrooms and chopped onion.  It would probably be good with any of your favorite omelet ingredients.  If you use reduced-fat sausage, cheese and crescent rolls, you can't tell a difference.  It is also good the next day in a sandwich.  I do have to cook it about 50 minutes or longer to get the eggs to set, but that may just be my own oven's quirkiness.  This is definitely a "keeper".

My husband and I both had seconds! I did not have crescent dough so I used fresh pizza dough. I used turkey sausage to cut down on fat. I did not have oregano, so I used dill, black pepper, salt, and mustard. I will add more veggies net time. I had to cook this an hour and increase the temp. but I have a gas oven.

This is an easy and awesome recipe! How about breakfast for dinner night? I've already made it twice; once with sausage and once with bacon. I perferred the sausage, my boys liked the bacon. It's a keeper.

Quick, easy & delicious.  My 7 year old son doesn't eat or like eggs and he loved it. He had the leftovers for dinner the next night.  I've improvised and sprinkled the seasonings my family likes on top, instead of oregano the second time I made the recipe.  I used a stone casserole dish and found that you do need to add to the cooking time.

I am just a beginner, I don't cook much.  This was easy and turned out delicious, even my picky six year old son liked it.  I had to bake it a few minutes longer than she suggested because I was using a glass casserole dish.  Great, easy, recipe.

My husband has made this recipe several times and I love it.   This morning, I tried my hand at it.   Since the crescent roll dough is triangle shaped, I thought it would work nicely to arrange them in a 10" deep dish pie plate.    Unfortunately that made the egg layer thicker, so it took longer to cook and the crust all but disappeared as it worked its way into the center of a very fluffy egg mixture.   It was still good, but I was disappointed because I like the crust.   Stick with the recipe -- use a 13 x 9 inch pan.

Crowd pleaser! Changes suggested in video were right! I would reduce the cheese a bit - 1 1/2 cup of each instead so that the egg - cheese ratio was better.  Add a pinch of salt to the egg mixture as well.

The only thing I did differently was to use 10 eggs, instead of 8, but this change isn't needed.

This recipe is very easy and good. I made the recipe as written.  It comes out of the oven puffy and is picture perfect. I would serve it to guests. It seems a little bland, which can be a good thing when trying to please everyone's palate. This recipe would be easy to tweak. You would not need to add salt,but other herbs and spices would make a nice change. I also tried this with pork sausage made by my meat market...still good.

Delicious! Followed advice of prior reviews and added milk.  Didn't use oregano, just standard salt and pepper for seasonings. Added a teaspoon of dry mustard because other casseroles I've made usually have it in the recipe. A huge hit w/my coworkers..brought home an empty dish!

Have made it twice now.  First time added two additional eggs.  Second time I used sage sausage as it's my favorite.  Both turned out great!   My son thought it was very good.   Next time I might go a little lighter on the amount of cheese to lighten the calories and texture..   Yes, there will  be a next time!   I'm not a fan of cooking, but this was so simple even my efforts did not fail.  Plus, it keeps and reheats well.  The second time I made it the day before I needed it.  Worked out great.

I followed previous suggestions: started the crescent rolls, 10 eggs, 3/4 cup milk, 2+ cups of cheddar/mozzarella mix, Italian seasoning/Herbs De Provence mix. I also seasoned the sausage with seasoned salt and seasoned pepper while cooking. Turned out great.

Awesome breakfast bake.  Everyone loves this one.  Like other reviewers I gave the crescent  dough a 8 minute prebake and used a full dozen eggs.  Used cut up link sausage (it was all I had) and diced some green & red peppers and onions.  Did the layering as called for.  Added can of green chili's . Had house guests.  Popped it in the oven and everyone who was sleeping could smell the heavenly casserole while it was baking.   Wolla! .  There were no leftovers and everyone raved about it.  Put salsa on the table and though I do no eat salsa the rest of our crowd put it on theirs and loved it.  This one is a keeper...

Made this for Christmas brunch  and it was great.  Couldn't have been easier to make.  Next time will try it with ham or bacon and a little more seasoning.  Also used 10 eggs.

This casserole would be perfect for a brunch.  Like other reviewers, I baked the crescent rolls at 350 degrees for about 9 minutes before adding the egg mixture. I also (1) increased the amount of eggs to a total of 10; (2) added 3/4 of a cup of milk; (3) used Italian Seasoning instead of Oregeno; and (4) baked the casserole at 350 for 25 minutes and then lowered the temperature to 325 for the last 25minutes.  The eggs were well set.  This dish is similar to a quiche.  Leftovers held up well in the fridge.

This was perfect for Christmas Morning! I followed the video's recommendation of 10 eggs and 3/4 cup of milk and baking the crust 10-15 minutes before adding the filling. I omitted the Oregano and seasoned with 1-1/2 tsp of Johnny's Garlic Seasoning. The only other addition I made was some chopped mild roasted Hatch Chiles
Will definitely be making this again.

I added two eggs and just used the cheese I had on hand, Italian blend and mexican. I thought this was fabulous! I didn't need to precook the crescent rolls or anything. I did tent the pan with foil to prevent over browning while it baked but otherwise that's it. Great recipe I'll be making this again for sure!

Loved this recipe! I took the tips of others used less cheese (about two cups), added milk (3/4 cup), used Italian seasoning instead of oregano, and precooked my dough 6 min on 350. I also opted out of using mozzarella and stuck with a mild cheddar. Instead of a plain sausage I used a bacon sausage making it even better!  This is a great Easter morning meal!!!!! Thanks for sharing.

Made this for dinner last night. Followed the recipe exactly and was surprised at how flavorful it was! Loved the texture too! I think next time I make it I will add green peppers, onions and maybe mushrooms to take it to the next level. Thank you for this great recipe!

It was ok, need a little more flavoring. From the recommendations of some of the reviews, I used sage sausage, italian seasonings, reduced cheese to 2 cups of Mexican blend cheese, 10 eggs and prebaked the croissant for 7 minutes. Next time I will try the Jimmy Dean Breakfast sausage, I think this would be better than the sage pork sausage which is too bland. I will use sharp cheddar cheese next time and not premake the croissant because it was a bit dry and brown too much or use baked croissants and cut it up and let the egg mixture soak overnight. It was still a big hit at work, but will try it different next time.

We made this casserole for Christmas morning breakfast and it was a big hit. We followed some of the recommendations in the reviews and up'd the number of eggs to10. We also included three quarters of cup of milk and pre-cooked the crescent rolls for about 10 minutes.  We're making this casserole again for tomorrow morning's brunch.

Yummy!  And very easy.  I didn't add any milk, but did add some water and another egg.  I used an 8x8 pan instead of a 9x13 and it took about an hour to cook, and the crescent rolls got pretty dark.  Still, it was still pretty tasty.  I didn't have the cheeses called for so placed slices of American cheese on top of the crescent rolls, then topped with bacon (no sausage around either).  For the cheese in the egg mixture, I used crumbled Boursin cheese.  I took this to a work function and it was gobbled up before 10:30 am; the other casserole I made took a bit longer to be eaten.  We still had some crescent rolls in the fridge so I made this for breakfast this morning but used 5 eggs and just the American cheese since it's just the two of us.  Still delicious, didn't miss the extra cheese, and it needed cooked about 40 minutes until done.  I can see using biscuits, or maybe pie crust and getting a similar result.  I did pre-bake the crust for about 5 minutes each time, and I wouldn't recommend that with the 8x8 pan full recipe, but it seemed okay, if still somewhat dark, with the 5 egg casserole.  Eggs did get under the crust the second time I made it, probably because I didn't press the seams together as well as I could, but it was still tasty and came out of the pan easily.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just made this, it was pretty easy and fast. I used biscuits because that's what I had on hand, baked them about 5 minutes before adding eggs I had mixed up with a few tablespoons of heavy cream (also, just because that's what I had on hand) and the cooked sausage. The only seasoning I used was salt and pepper, we like that better on our breakfast food. Used a little less than 2 cups colby and monterey jack cheese, it was plenty. Will make it again!

Did not use mozzarella cheese and did add a small amount of milk. Also added some frozen hash browns and cooked an extra 20 minutes.

I used the "most helpful" review and made the low fat version (for 196 calories a serving!). Even my picky 2 year old asked for seconds! I used ingredients I ha on hand. Reduced fat crescent rolls, turkey sausage, egg beater equivalent of 6 eggs, 4 Danish eggs, 3/4 cup fat free half and half, sprinkled 1 oz of 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese on top of sausage, 1/2 cup 2% cheddar in egg mixture and 1 cup full fat cheddar on top (all I had). I imagine you could reduce the fat and calories by using all 2% cheese. This was fantastic. Thank you!

I made this today. I used hot pork sausage. I also added a few more eggs, because that is a lot of cheese. So, either add a few more eggs or don't put as much cheese. It turned out very tasty and the hot sausage gave it a little kick. I will definitely make this again. It makes a lot, so now we have breakfast for the next 3-4 days.

I cut this recipe in half (except for the sausage that I ended using just about all of) since I was making this for a smaller group.  I also added onion.  It was delicious and my children loved it.  I didn't bake the crescent rolls ahead of time like some reviewers did & had no problem with a nice crispy casserole bottom.

Very good!  All my kids loved it, ages two to twelve.  I did follow the reviews.  I increased the eggs to ten, cut the cheese to one cup each and gave the crust a seven minute head start.  I also added onion while cooking the sausage and did not use the oregano.  It turned out perfect and can not wait to make again.

Used the basic recipe but I didn't have crescent rolls so I mixed up Bisquick for a crust and used various types of sausages I had. also seasoned with salt/pepper/and "slap your mama" for a little kick. It was a success!

So easy & DELICIOUS!  I used 10 eggs, and 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, (instead of 4 cups of cheese).  I also pre-cooked the dough in the oven for 6 minutes before adding the other ingredients.  I seasoned sausage with salt and italian seasoning, & sauteed until brown,  set aside, and sauteed peppers & onions in the sausage oil.  Then I returned sausage to pan with peppers and mixed together.  I then added this mixture to the pre-cooked dough and topped with egg/cheese/milk recipe (actually i used half & half).  Do not overcook this.  I made the mistake of keeping this warm, covered with foil in the oven turned off and the dough was a little too well done for me, but it was still very yummy!

I made this for a graduation brunch and everyone seemed to love it.  Instead of the crescent roll bottom, I used the Pillsbury biscuits (which I got for under a dollar on sale and with coupons).

Been making this for years. My co-workers and husband ask for me to make often.  Only thing different is that I leave out the oregano and use a monterrey jack/colby cheese combination.  Really good to also add a few lightly sauted red bell peppers.

Every time I've made this, everyone RAVES about it. Wonderful & tasty every time. 
One thing I do is I put the crescent dough in the oven while I'm cooking the sausage & assembling the other ingredients. This way, it always is cooked through.

I've been making this for years.  I'm doing low carb and I make it exactly the way the directions state only I Pam the bottom of the pan and don't use the crescent rolls.  I've had it both ways though and both ways are excellent.  I also prefer it without the oregano.  With the oregano it gives it a more pasta taste instead of that breakfast feel.  Either way I love it!

I tweaked this a bit by sauting onions in with the sausage.  I also prebaked the crescent roll "crust" for about 5 minutes so it would be a little crispy.  Overall pretty good, will add jalapenos next time to give it a little kick.

Great recipe...4 stars because I think it definitely calls for some changes. I agree it needs more eggs, 10 would probably do. I think the 4 cups of cheese was fine but I LOVE cheese. I also cooked the crescent rolls at 350 for 6 minutes before adding the egg mixture. I continued to cook it at 350 for 20 minutes then lowered it to 325 for another 20. I would like to try this with bacon or ham. Tasted even better the next day!

Wow!  I've made a lot of breakfast casseroles and this one is by far my favorite.  I made a few of the changes suggested by other users.  10 eggs, 3/4 c. milk and baked the crescent dough for 5 minutes before adding the rest.  It came out fabulous and even my husband who is allergic to eggs couldn't stop eating it.

I was looking for a quick Christmas morning breakfast recipe, and this worked out great!  I didn't have any ground sausage on hand so I used sausage links and diced them.  I'm gluten intolerant, so I nixed the crescent roll dough all together. I took the advice from the first reviewer and added milk and used Italian seasoning instead of oregano.  Used their baking time advice too and did 25 min at 350 then 20 min at 325.  I will probably reduce by 5 or 10 minutes next time. I will make this again and I'm planning to add red bell pepper and browned potatoes.  I may even use half and half instead of milk.  Can't wait!

Halved the recipe by making it an 8x8 baking dish. Very good! Egg Beaters, 2% sharp white cheddar cheese and turkey sausage made it a bit healthier! I think next time I'll add 2 tsps of Tastefully Simple Fiesta Spice Mix and 1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions.   Time saving tip: Use Pillsbury Crescent Rolls Seamless Dough Sheet

My mother-in-law thought this was the best egg and sausage casserole she ever had.  She gave me a hug and said thank you; I was in shock.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this with everyones suggestions, 10 eggs and baked the rolls for a few minutes before adding the rest, I did use all the cheese. (i love cheese) I was told by everyone that this was the best egg bake they have ever had. My husband told me, I could make this for him anytime I want to suprise him! hehe I will be making this Christmas morning for the hubby and kids! Thanks!!!

I just made this for brunch. I was looking for something to eat now & not have to overnite it. This was perfect. I'm trying to eat healthier so I used a 12oz bag of mornin star meat starters (= to 1# italian sausage) w/ all color peppers & basil instead of oregano. Great Casserole!!

This turned out really well.  I used vegetarian sausage, I used almost all the cheese the recipe called for.  I pre-baked the crust for 7 min.  I followed the other persons advice and baked it at 350 for 25 min. and 325 for 20 min.  I will be making this again!

Could be followed exact and taste great but kind of plain to me. I browned and drained the sausage then put back in the skillet and added onions, fresh garlic, zucchini, and portabella mushrooms. I also seasoned this mixture with fresh parsley, thyme, and oregano. I baked the crescent rolls for 9 minutes and topped with shredded cheese and then added this mixture on top. I beat 8 eggs, milk, salt, pepper, hot sauce, dried mustard, worceteshire, and cheese. Top and bake for about 25 minutes. My guests LOVED it and so did I! :-)

GREAT Breakfast. I love mixing things up and making it mine. I use a little bit of bacon and ham, and took tips from other ratings and used more eggs, and less cheese.   PERFECT!!

I will give it 3 stars I guess cause I am partial to my Great Grandmothers Breakfast Casserole recipe and it I made as is I don't think I would have enjoyed it.  I used 10 eggs, about 1/2 cup skim milk, cut the cheese in half and when I browned the sausage added some onion and green pepper.  I think it would have been pretty bland without it.  I may make this one again.

The main problem was with the crescent roll crust - that flavor didn't go with the dish at all. It might be ok without that crust, but the recipe is pretty bland otherwise.

Very easy and very good, I added some Lawry's season salt to the egg mixture and it was good. Next time I might add some finely chopped onion, mushroom and broccoli to the egg mixture, but it is very good as is.

This couldn't have been easier.  Got absolutely rave reviews.  I used 10 eggs, but otherwise followed recipe to a T.  It was the first dish that was empty and I had multiple requests for the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

Made it for the first time this year Christmas morning.  I wanted something that I could make the night before and just pop in the oven and I must say all the "soggy" reviews had me scared but I went ahead and tried it.  I did make it the night before and decided to turn the oven up to 340 degrees and i cooked it for 45 minutes.  Not soggy at all turned out perfect !  We did increase our eggs to 10, 3/4 cup of mik and we added butter to the eggs.  You won't be sorry you tried this one !

I am really glad I gave this a try, it really is so easy and inexpensive, and tasty too,we ate every bit of it. It seemed to take awhile for the middle to cook, next time I will lower the temp and add extra baking time. I will be making this a lot in the future.

quick and easy and tasty. my husband's very picky and is pretty much a meat and potato man so i have a hard time with new recipes. i was nervous to try this one because he likes his food separate, but he loves it! i've added pepperoni before and that's yummy too. i'd imagine you could use any combination of pork you'd want.

Mmmmm. Nothing better than a great casserole early in the morning. I followed some of the other recommendations and used 10 eggs and of course added extra cheese. Who doesn't love extra cheese! It came out wonderfully.

I followed the other suggestions which I'm sure improved the recipe, but I also think it could be better with some more experimenting.  I did give the crescents a 5-7 min head start, added milk to the eggs, used italian seasoning instead of oregano, reduced cheese to 2 c, and baked at 350 for 25 then 325 for another 20 (which was too long and made both the crescents and the eggs overdone, but that may just be my oven).  Next time, I will also up the eggs to 10-12 and try different seasonings.  I wasn't a huge fan of the italian, but onion powder and garlic or something totally different might be good.  I'll also try to add some veggies (mushrooms, peppers, or possibly even asparagus) which are noticeably lacking in this recipe!  And I'll reduce the cooking time again or at least keep a very watchful eye on it.

The only changes I made were to add 1/2 finely diced onions to the sausage, and a half cup of milk to the egg mixture (it would have been dry without it). Oh- and I halved the amount of cheese called for because of reading other reviews. It was good, but next time I'll only use 1/2 lb of sausage, it was a little too meaty. Or- use more eggs if I need to feed a lot of ppl. I might also add spinach or bell pepper to make it taste healthier. ;)

I made this for Father's Day brunch and it was really yummy.  I used 10 eggs and only half the cheese like some suggested.  My husband said it delicious but wished it was cheesier.  So next time I'll use the amount stated in the recipe.  The croissant on the bottom got a little to crispy but my timer was turned off by accident so I'm not sure how long it was in the oven for.  Will keep a closer eye on it next time but will definitely make again.

Made it again and it was much better!  Put it in the oven with just the crescents for 5 minutes before adding the other ingredients.  Also I used 2 cups of cheddar and 1 cup of mozzarella.  I substituted italian seasonings for the oregano.  (Still used 10 eggs like last time).  I also watched the clock this time.  It was in the oven a total of 37 minutes and it came out perfectly!  YUM!!

I've made this for 4 church and family functions so far, and it is always the first casserole eaten amongst many others there. I agree with everyone else who suggested cutting back on the cheese, adding the milk, and so on. I learned the hard way that this recipe takes closer to 50 min, than 30ish- we were almost late, waiting for it to set up. I never could stomach these casseroles as a kid, but I love this one and make it for dinners, as well!

I have made this several times and always receive rave reviews and requests to make it for the next gathering. I altered slightly based on previous reviews. I have used 10-12 eggs, added half and half, and cut the oregano to 1/2 tsp. I've also added some salt and pepper to my tastes and used 2 cups of Italian shredded cheese mix. And I precooked the crescent rolls for 7 minutes before adding the eggs. It does usually take 45 mins to 1 hour to cook for me.

Very delicious for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! I used Italian sausage (out of it's casing) and Italian seasonings. It was so good we had to go back for seconds!

Fixed this for Easter morning and the family loved it.  I did make a few changes.  I took others suggestions and baked the dough for 7 minutes before adding the mixture.  Used 10 eggs, 1/4 cup milk.  After cooking sausage, I sauteed 8 oz of chopped white mushrooms in 2 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, a pinch of ground black pepper.  Then mixed all the ingredients together with the eggs mix before pouring into baking dish.  Really helped to meld the favors together instead of putting sausage just on the bottom.  Next time I am going to add some chopped green and red bell pepper, a small onion chopped, tomato chopped and 2 tablespoons of Grey Poupon Mustard. I also found that if your oven also has convection then it helped to cook and not leaving the mixture soupy as some stated.  I cooked until the top was golden brown and knife was completely dry when checked.  I can think of many ways to change this and will continue to use as the base.

I made this today for Easter brunch. I actually halved the recipe and used reduced fat crescent rolls, 2% milk cheeses, reduced fat smoked sausage, 1  extra egg and 1/4 c. fat free half and half. I din't cut back on the cheese. It was AWESOME! I followed other suggestions to bake the crescent rolls first. I baked the entire casserole at 350 for about 40 minutes. I have been making all sorts of breakfast, egg, sausage, ham, bacon, potato casseroles and quiches for years. This is by far the easiest and best recipe! My husband gave it 2 thumbs up!

Excellent dish. I used ground turkey sausage and it came out just fine.    I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 10 eggs, just 2 cups (total) of cheese, 3/4ths cup of milk and Italian seasoning. Also, I pre-baked the crescent rolls for 7 minutes or so, and baked the entire dish at 350 .

Yum!  I just made this for breakfast this morning and it was great!  I took some next door to my mother and father-in-laws and they loved it too.  My father-in-law wants the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, but can see adding some onion the next time and even swapping out the sausage for ham to switch it up a bit.  I might have to try that with the left over hame from dinner today!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made something similar for many years. I would suggest adding a small can of diced green chiles. This will make the whole thing come alive. You can also top the slice with a little of your favorite salsa.

I love this recipe; it's our favorite for breakfast.  I always end up with a bit extra of the crescent roll dough, so I cut it up into small pieces and sprinkle over the top before I bake.  I also prebake the bottom crescent roll dough for about five minutes before topping it with the rest of the ingredients.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This recipe is great... I've made it for Christmas brunch and for dinners.  I used 8 eggs with 1 cup of milk.  The Quiche recipe I make calls for 3 eggs and 1 cup of milk and it cooks up fine.  So I wouldn't worry about adding a cup of milk.  I like to whip the eggs and milk with the hand-held mixer to add air to the egg/milk mixture which makes the casserole less dense (I think!).  I cooked the sausage, then sauteed onions and mushrooms in the grease.  I also threw in some cooked broccoli that was in the fridge.  I ended up using 2 cups of swiss cheese, and 1 cup of cheddar, which was plenty.  My husband took some to work for lunch today!

Great recipe.  I always make two: one with hot sausage (Bob Evan's) and one without meat.  I add onions, mushrooms and green peppers as well.  The hot sausage gives it a nice kick!

I make this dish at least 2 Sundays a month with the following changes. I use egg beaters instead of whole eggs and only use 1 cup (4 eggs). Instead of the suasage I use morningstar farms breakfast patties. To getmy son to eat more veggies, I add read onion and bell pepper. My family loves it!

Wonderful Dish! Only thing I did different was to use medium cut hashbrowns instead of the bread.  Everyone at church loved it.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe.  Baked the crescent roll for 7 minutes before adding the other incredients.  Used 9 eggs and only 1 cup of mozzarella and 1 cup of cheddar.  After about half way baking, I sprinkled a little more cheese on top. I also added one drained canned of mild green chiles, a little salt and black pepper to the egg mixture before placing in pan.  Great recipe for when you have company over for breakfast.  Much easier than cooking eggs and sausage seperately. Enjoy!

This was my first breakfast casserole and it was delicious.  My husband and 2 year old enjoyed it as well.  It is definitely going into the breakfast rotation.  It was so quick and easy to make.  The only change I made was that I precook the crescent roll for 7 minutes on 350 degrees.   Next time I will use less cheese and add onions or/and bacon.

For someone who is generally not a breakfast casserole person, I'm addicted to this recipe...it is so EASY!  The OREGANO is the secret...and ANY cheese you have in the fridge will be fine (have made it a half a dozen times, with whatever cheese I have). Simple & delicious!

We love this recipe! Since finding it we have made it tons of times, it's our fall back when we have company. Depending on what we have in the fridge we also add, peppers, onions and mushrooms. It really is a great recipe.

This recipe was delicious.  I used buttermilk biscuits as the base instead of crescent rolls due to that being the only thing that I had on hand.  I also sprinkled Nature's Seasonings on top of the casserole along w/the oregano before baking it.  It turned out very yummy.

This recipe was great with a few changes.  I used Italian seasoning instead of Oregano and added 2 more eggs and 3/4 cup milk like others had suggested.  I will definitely be making this again.  Next time I think I will try to make it using boca sausage so it's a little healthier.

Great recipe, cooked the night before so it was not as nice looking as it was when it was fresh, but it was delicious.  Reheated at 200 degrees for an hour while I got ready for work.  Was able to cut it into nice squares for servings.  I used 10 eggs and sage sausage, and had to cook it a little longer.

Made this on Christmas morning and everyone loved it.  I did make some changes like others suggested.  I doubled the recipe for 12 adults and there was only a little left over, everyone had seconds.  I used 22 eggs, 3c cheese (colby-cheddar) 1ts Italian seasoning, 2lb Jimmy Dean reg bulk sausage, which I browned the night before, 2 pgs cresent rolls, 1 1/2c milk.  Bake the cresent rolls first for 10 min, then added the rest for 40 min.  This recipe is a keeper!

This is awesome!  I had leftover ham, so I subbed that in for the sausage and I used Colby Jack instead of mozzarella.  This took about 45 minutes to bake, but it was worth the wait and delicious!

This was great!  I didn't have sausage, so I cooked up a pound of bacon and substituted.  Everyone at work loved it - it was gone within 1/2 hour.

This was great, even my 2 year old ate it. I didn't have crescent rolls so I pressed buttermilk biscuits as the bottom crust and cut the leftover biscuits into tiny squares and sprinkled them on top, what a great presentation. Had a good flavor but next time I will saute green peppers with the sausage and serve it with homemade milk gravy, Yuuummmm..Thanks for the recipe

Excellent recipe.  I make mine a little healthier by using low fat crescent rolls, egg beaters, low fat cheeses (the no fat cheeses don't melt very well) and turkey sausage.

I made this as a part of my Mother's Day Brunch, and my family loved it!  I reduced the egg and liquid measurements as suggested here, though I stuck with the dried oregano.  Use the oregano!  The smell of the sausage and seasoning while baking is divine.  Really delicious. I'll make this again.

Absolutely delicious!!!!  This was a huge hit in our household, and I definitely will be making it again.  My son especially enjoyed it as he was able to 'help' make it -- stirring in the cheeses and oregano.

Excellent!  I followed others' suggestions to increase the eggs to 10, add 3/4 cup milk, decrease the cheese to a generous cup each, and pre-bake the crescent roll part for 5 minutes at 350. I used turkey sausage.  Next time I will probably use about 3 cups total of cheese....but it was wonderful as is. My family, including 2 young kids, loved it.  Thanks for the post!

Rave reviews from friends - though mine was a little liquidy at the bottom, maybe it was the cheese I used.  I will definitely save this one!

I thought this recipes was great!  I made it for supper served with a fruit salad and my two youngest girls had two servings.  I followed the recipe exactly except I prebaked the cresent roll bottom for a couple of minutes to give it a head start.  We had it as leftovers the next day and it reheated great the next day!  fabulous!!!  Thanks bunches

Great brunch!  Snowed in today so I made it for the gang.  Followed the directions and added a tbs. of crushed jalapenos. Took 15 mins. more in my oven. Came out great.  Thanks!

This recipe is very forgiving, but I wanted to make/rate it as it is written.  Next time I will probably add onions &/or mushrooms....things I like.

I added linguica for more meat flavor.  Next time though, I would leave out the oregano...it's just not a breakfast type of spice in my opinion.  Next time I'll stick to garlic salt and pepper for seasoning.  Oregano was a little too overwhelming for morning time.

Okay, personally, eggs disgust me, but I made this for my husband who loves a good breakfast.  I left out the oregano because its place in breakfast casserole was beyond me, but added bacon and some extra cheese.  My husband loved it and has asked for it several times since then.

Excellent!My picky kids loved it!and my quiche-hating hubby ate it up!I made a few changes. 10 eggs, half the cheese (dieting!),salt,pepper,garlic powder, and used tarragon instead of oregano.I also baked the dough 7 minutes before adding egg mixture & sausage. Baked for 45 minutes uncovered.This is definitely a keeper!!

I really liked this.  My husband ate it, but wasn't that impressed with it.  He's not a big casserole fan, though.  I thought it was very good.  I loved the oregano flavor.

I used Italian chicken sausage and bread instead. I also added spinach, which I just laid on top of the bread. I had to bake it a little longer for it to cook all the way through, but it was wonderful when it was finished. I made it for my mom and she loved it!

This is a great dish to make when you don't want to spend too much time preparing dinner. I leave out the oregano though, it just tasted a little strange.

I made this today with a few modifications.  First I pre-baked the crust 8 minutes as others had suggested.  I used only the cheddar cheese and not quite two cups.  I think it would have been way too much cheese with both.  I added fresh ground pepper to the eggs and excluded the oregano.  On half I added some diced jalapeños.  Since some thought it was somewhat bland, I made sausage gravy and topped individual servings.  Next time I would add more eggs, probably 10.  All in all, it was pretty good.

I made this for our monthly family breakfast get together and everybody loved it.  There were no leftovers!  I did have to make a few changes...I doubled the amount of eggs and seasoned it to our personal preference (left out the oregano and added some Tony Chachere's, a Louisiana seasoning)  I also added sauteed mushrooms, onions, and bell pepper.  I think it would be delicious even without the changes though, and a very easy recipe to make!

This recipe is a definite breakfast/brunch favorite!  We love Velveeta, so instead of the recommended 2 cups of cheddar, I microwaved 16 oz of Velveeta and 2 tbsp of milk x 2 minutes. Then I only used 1 cup of mozarella.  As suggested by others, I baked it a little longer --- 350 x 40 minutes, and it came out perfect!

I made this for an anniversary breakfast. There was too much for 2, but I knew that.  We have kept it in the fridge and have been reheating it in the oven all week and it is still very yummy! I made it just as the recipe stated. Very easy and great! Thank you.

I made this yesterday for my daughter's christening brunch.  It was a hit.  Several guests asked for the recipe.  I followed other's advice and made it with 10 eggs, 3/4c. milk, and half of the cheese.   I can't wait for another opportunity to make this again.

I greased the pan with olive oil, prebaked the crescent crust and just used only 2 cups of cheese.  I also added 3/4 c. of milk.  Tasted great!!!
WIll make again!

I thought it was quick and easy.  I did bake the crescent rolls about five minutes before I put the sausage on top.  I used less cheese than it called for.  My children wouldn't touch it but they are picky eaters.  Too bad for them.

My kids are not big on casseroles because they tend to be more complex on taste, but they LOVED this breakfast.  My husband works at home, so we breakfast and lunch are our main meals.  We will definitely be repeating this.  My dh thought it needed a little more flavor (I didn't) so next time we might add some onions and garlic.

I was having a shower at my house and ran out of 9x13 pans, so I had to split this up.  Half of it went into a stoneware pan which turned out excellent but the half that I put in a dark glass pan (which is a little smaller than a 9x13) was super runny to the point the crescent rolls wouldn't cook. I will try again next time only in stoneware.

I made this for the first time today.  The flavor was very good.  I used low fat sausage and fat free cheese so it was a bit dry. Next time I am going to add some vegtables to make it a little moister.

The best breakfast casserole yet. It doesn't fall apart when taken out of the pan.  I've made it for many church breakfasts and have given the receipe to many friends who wanted it.  Kids love it.  I do use garlic powder instead of oregano.

I substituted the pork sausage with turkey sausage for less fat; I think this would've been a better dish if the amount of cheese was reduced, as other reviewers suggested... It was just too cheesy - I couldn't really taste much else! It wasn't bad... and makes a nice presentation. But if I ever make this again, I'll try other suggested modifications.

I know I'm in the minority, but I did not like this recipe.  First of all, I think I over-cooked it as it was dry.  I also did not care for the taste or texture - it reminded my of quiche, which I do not care for.

Excellent recipe, thank you for sharing it. I made a minor change, as I didn't have any cresent rolls I used a can of large biscuits which I flattened out. Also, my family suggested that the next time I make it I also make some white gravy to laddle over the top. Wonderful stuff!

This would have received 5 stars except that it was WAY too cheesy.  I reduced the amount of cheese to 1 cup of each and it was much better.  As a matter of fact it was fantastic.

This is the BEST breakfast casserole I have ever had!  Maybe even the best recipe I have made off this site!
I halved it (it was just my two year old and me) but still added two more eggs.  I think it would have been fine just as the recipe is, but we like eggs.  I added 1/4 c milk and didn't use much mozzerella.  Like others have said, took much longer to bake.  
Also, the crescents rose up and the eggs ended up on the bottom.  I assume this is normal, but I didn't expect it!
Thanks for the awesome recipe! By the way, my two year old ate more that I did, I think!

This was wonderful and easy, I cut back on the cheese by 1/2 cup after I read other reviews, but I think next time (and that will be next week) I will add the full amount.  I added some chopped onion on top of the sausage and I also think I will just put the cheese right on top of the sausauge next time instead of mixing it in with the eggs.  I ended up cooking this for 50 minutes to get the egg cooked through.  This is a keeper.

Wow! Great Easy recipe that can be added to according to your own tastes! I used bacon instead of sausage and did everything else the same and it came out great.

After reading other comments, I changed the recipe a little.  I used 10 eggs, 3/4 C. milk, total of 3 cups cheese and eliminated the oregano and used maple flavored sausage.  I also baked at 350 for 50 min.  The other comments gave me great insight.  Great recipe with lots of variations possible!

I made this when my in-laws came to visit and it received rave reviews.  I sauteed mushrooms and onions and added it to half of the casserole so that there were two types of casserole to choose from. My mother-in-law asked for the recipe and then she e-mailed me the day after she left our house and said she had made the casserole for breakfast the next morning!  Also, this casserole is even tastier on the second day!

This is a great recipe to make for a brunch. Since people like to request their eggs a different way, it's easier to make this casserole, which everyone will enjoy. I used bacon instead of sausage and skipped the oregano. It turned out great!

Very easy to make-I made it Easter morning.  My husband loved it and suggested you could easily add other mushrooms or onions etc. to it.  I loved it too and normally I don't like "egg-y" things very much. Try it!!

I liked this recipe but if you are going to use that much cheese, increase the amount of eggs. I also added frozen chopped green peppers and onions to this and it was delicious. I used only 2+1/2 cups cheese.

This is a great recipe. Very cheesy and the crescent dough added the right taste. I added the cooked sausage to the egg mixture and then poured it into the pan. It was a little thick when I mixed it in the bowl but it made the appearance much better. I was afraid it was going to look like an egg casserole with no meat. It cooked fine and turned out wonderful.

Great recipe!  Simple to make and tasty to eat.  As other postings indicated, it takes a little longer to bake than the recommended 25-30 min.  With my oven it takes about 40 min.

Yum!  This recipe hit the spot with dh and me.  Plenty of flavor - even used mild sausage.  I did put the croissant crust in oven for just 5  minutes to jumpstart.  Turned out great.  Cooked for additional 10 minutes and then let is sit for another 10 after pulling out of oven.  Will make for Christmas brunch!

My whole family, including three kids, loved this dish!  I used sage sausage and added a few spices...salt, pepper & Penzey's Foxpoint seasoning (which includes shallots, chives, garlic & onion). The only problem I ran into was getting the eggs to set.  I ended up baking it for over an hour.  I'll probably try to use a pan that is more shallow next time.  But there will definately be a next time!

This was delicious. It has become one of my "fool-proof" recipes- a recipe you know will be a hit with everyone. I used a spicy sausage to give it a little kick.

Made this recipe last Sunday for everyone playing/singing on our music team. The guys were loving it! Even the women who were "watching their weight" secretly snagged a piece!  By time church was finished, there was no casserole left! Gonna make it again - thanks!

I used an extra two eggs, and about 1/3 cup of milk to the mixture to make it fluffier.  Forgot the oregano-oops....but my sausage was made with sage, so hopefully that'll make up for it.  It did puff up with the extra eggs and the milk, probably could have used even more milk but I didn't want to risk a soggy crust.  Fantastic!  Thanks!

What a fantastic recipe!! We are not breakfast people as we are always on the go and trying to grab something that will make everyone happy and fill up the family. This is the recipe. The crescent roll base makes for a hearty and fufilling meal. What a way to start the day. Thank you.

Good recipie...added onions and green peppers to one half of it.  The top didn't turn out like I thought it would...I thought the eggs would be fluffier, instead it was more brownish.  Need to cook less, though, as mine turned out a bit hard on the bottom.  But I will DEFINITELY serve this for some Sunday breakfast, and my husband, who doesn't eat breakfast, said he'd definitely eat it!  Thanks for sharing!

GREAT! Made this for dinner last night. Didn't have pork sausage, so I subbed for 1/2 lb bacon/1/2 lb honey ham; added 3 chopped tomatoes. I used 3 cups light mexican cheese.  I also exchanged oregano for freshly ground black pepper, minced garlic and onion.  Put 10 eggs in, as previously suggested, next time I'll try 12 as it was a little dry.  But everyone gave it 2 forks up...thanks LeAnn, we have a new favorite quiche.

This is a great, quick dish, with wonderful results!  I used a combination of cheddar, mozzarella and colby cheese, and substituted a pound of diced cooked bacon for the sausage.  My kids didn't want to try it with the sausage last time I made it, but gobbled it down with the bacon.

I made this on Christmas Eve for Christmas morning breakfast.  It refrigerated nicely and was so easy to just pop in the oven.  My husband and 4 boys loved it -- they usually don't like casseroles!  I did add 4 more eggs and had to cook it for almost an hour, but it was so easy.  Thanks.

This is a great recipe.  My guests loved it and we had plenty of leftovers for the next day.  I've made it twice, the first time I overbaked after reading some other reviews.  Today I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  I think I will try adding sauted mushrooms next time.

I LOVED this recipe, I used bacon insted of the pork, and jack cheese with peppers insted of the cheddar.  I used about 1/3rd of the cheese and it came out perfect!  I reccomend this one highly and so does my family.

My 5 year now will eat eggs again!  This is a easy meal.  Instead of the two different cheeses I used a Mexican mix.  I also used half the fat sauage.  Thanks, this one it is a keeper.

My family really enjoyed it.  We made it in a smaller, round casserole so it took a little longer to bake, but it was great!

I made this Easter morning, it was delicious. It had such a wonderful flavor, better than I expected.  I did cut back on some of the cheese.  I will definitely be making this again! My company really liked it too.

Tasted great and very easy to prepare.  My only comment is perhaps using a smaller size pan would be better.  The 13x9 pan makes the casserole very thin.

Served this for dinner one night for a change. We call these types of things "brupper", not brunch, not supper. Leftovers we're gone at breakfast time! Teens scooped it up!

This was a really good and looked pretty too. I was conservative and followed the directions exactly. Next time I'm going to add mushrooms and green onions to the egg mix before I pour it over the sausage.

This was good. It's similar to a breakfast pizza recipe I have, but easier since you don't have to pat out the dough so much. Next time I'd probably add a cup or so of thawed, shredded hashbrowns. Yummy.

I'd been looking for a sausage casserole for a while and came across this so I thought I would give it a try.  I made this today for a brunch and it was a big hit.  People asked me for the recipe.  I also made up a batch and substituted bacon in place of the sausage.  Everyone loved both.  Thanks for the great recipe.

2/3rd a cup of milk, 10 eggs, 1 tsp of Italian seasoning, 1 cup cheddar and 1 cup of pepper jack. More of a kick but even my pickiest eaters loved it.

This was a really simple recipe and tasty. I made this for a Christmas breakfast for our church and had several others make the same recipe. Several of us had to increase the bake if time to 45 minutes to an hour since it was still soupy in the middle after only 30 minutes. Everyone loved it! I will make this again!

I love this recipe as does my entire family! You can do things like substitute the sausage for bacon or ham and add tomatoes and bell peppers for a Denver Omelet kinda thing. I took out the sausage and make sausage gravy and poor it on top after it’s baked - YUM!!! I’ve also flattened biscuits and put them on the bottom instead of croissants. So many variations you can play with! Hands down, one of my favorite recipes.

I sauté green bell pepper with a little bit of minced garlic, red pepper flakes and pepper in olive oil and put that on top of the cooked sausage. Then I top it off work green onions and bake...this is a family favorite!!

I loved it! I made it with Jimmy Deans's hot sausage, buttery/flaky crescent dough, and the cheddar was part of a 3 cheese blend I used up in my fridge. So good! Flavorful like a really good sausage egg and cheese biscuit. My entire family loved it!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe to the letter, it was bland and no one went back for seconds. This time I used 10 eggs, 1 cup each of the cheeses, 3/4 cup milk, medium spicy sausage, the oregano, and I added a green pepper. I baked it for 25 minutes at 350, then 20 minutes at 325. This time it was a hit, everyone was fighting for seconds.

This has always been my go-to breakfast casserole  with NO changes and made as is! However , tonight I made it for dinner with changes. Wow I thought the original version was awesome, I couldn't believe the dinner version.  I just used what we had on hand.  I used stuffing instead of biscuits, crumbled sauage and cooked with onions.......added Ro-tel after onions were tender. Spooned stuffing in bottom of pan, covered with saugage, onions and Rotel, topped with different kinds of cheese, poured eggs over top and covered with shredded sharp cheddar and baked.  Didn't have sour cream on hand, but topped with Salsa. YUMMY! Now when you have an Appalchian hubs who doesn't "eat" things like and he gobbles it up........you can not go wrong! Thank goodness the orginal recipe is on my Fav list :)

Very good, as long as you add your own seasoning / flavor. I used feta, jack and smoked cheddar for the cheeses and cooked the sausage with bell pepper, mushroom and onion. Before baking, topped it with slices of tomato and sprinkled with extra cheese.

it turned out better how I made it. I took out the crescent roll dough that stuff was nasty in the first time. and kept out the mozzarella cheese
 it tasted so much better.

I used mild italian sausage and 10 eggs with a bit of milk as some reviewers suggested. Excellent!  And made enough to freeze in single servings for work lunches. Will make this often.

I would suggest for those who found it lacked flavor, change your sausage! Use garlic sausage or spicy italian sausage. Even Jimmy Dean spicy or Chorizo will add the flavor lacking from plain pork sausage!

I rated this a 5-star because of the ease of preparation compared to the end product. I took it to my women's group and there wasn't a piece left. I might change the oregano to tarragon next time. I used the fluffier crescent rolls and pre-baked them.

I feel this was only average.  It didn't taste as good as all the rage reviews. Too much cheese and I feel the rolls actually took away from any flavor that could have been there. If I were to make it again, I'd use less cheese and add some other spice. I added green onions based on a suggestion and would do more of that. In the meantime, I'll search for something new.

This is a super easy dish to put together, even in the wee hours of the morning and it was a huge hit at our community yard sale and then again at church! After reading quite a few reviews I went with 10 eggs and 2 cups shredded cheese. I cubed a fully cooked summer sausage and I used Italian seasoning rather than straight oregano. I didn't add any milk like some reviewers did. The other change I made was to use a ready pie dough instead of the Crescent rolls, in the interest of time. I baked them in deep glass pie plates and sprayed them with Pam buttery spray before laying in the pie dough. I baked them at 325 for about 35-40 minutes and they came out perfectly! This is now my go-to easy breakfast/brunch dish and I plan to experiment with other quiche/omelette ingredients. Definitely a new favorite!

I made some of the changes as suggested by other reviewers and added half cup of milk and cooked the crescent rolls for 7 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. I only had 8 eggs, but agree that 10 eggs would have been better. I also seasoned the sausage as it was plain, but another alternative would have been to use the hot and spicy sausage. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This was delicious.  I may try using a different kind of dough next time.  The filling was perfect but I thought the crescent roll "crust" was a little sweeter than I would prefer.  Will definately be making this on a regular basis.  THANKS ??

The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I did some changes. I used Italian sausage, added milk and replaced oregano to Italian seasoning. My family devoured it.

Good basic recipe. If you let all ingredients come to room temp. it will cook in 25-30 minutes. I did as some others suggested and added two more eggs, cut cheese back to two cups and added 1/2 cup of milk. Green onions and bell peppers are great in this too.

I LOVE this recipe. I did a quick and dirty version for myself and my family with what I had in the house. I used 8 frozen precooked sausage patties instead of a pound of sausage, and 6 slices of crumbled American cheese instead of shredded (unfortunately). However, it still turned out amazing! I baked at 325 for 25 minutes and the crescent dough was perfectly browned and flaky, the eggs were cooked thoroughly, and the cheese was perfectly melted! I thought it was a little dry, however, so I topped it with sausage gravy upon serving-- delicious!!! My 1-year-old sister loved it as well :) Definitely recommend and I would make this again in a heartbeat.

Very good and easy to make.  I scrambled  up the sausage the day before so that it would be faster to prepare the next morning.  I also used 10 eggs instead of 8 as recommended by others. I used all cheddar cheese instead of the mixture.  Great for brunches or making on the weekend and then warming up a piece every morning without having to cook!

I made this to use up the sausage on hand.  I added a 1/4 cup of  milk to my servings size of 6.  Used an 8x8 glass baking dish and only used 1/3c of colby/jack cheese and 1/3c of extra sharp cheddar.  The savory flavor was delicious and everyone loved it..  I will be making this again.

This is a recipe my family looks forward to Christmas morning. I added chopped onion to the sausage as it cooked and took the suggestions of using 10 eggs, adding milk and cutting back on the cheese it worked out wonderfully! Great receipe!

I revamped this recipe a little to make it faster and a little healthier: southwestern style egg beaters, ore cooked turkey sausage and reduced fat crescent rolls and cheeses... Still amazing... Still a huge hit.

I pre-baked the crust, with Italian seasoning sprinkled on top. Used blended 3 cheese, red/yellow/green peppers, diced tomatoes and cooked sausage. Baked 35 minutes. Very colorful and tasty.

I make this once a week and never get tired of it. It's always served as breakfast to guests as well. Used two cups of cheese (triple cheddar), ten eggs, 3/4 cup milk, and two teaspoons of Italian seasoning (we like flavor!). Precooked the crescents for seven minutes and increased the total cook time to about 35-40min. Always excellent!

Since it is just my husband and myself I made in a 9"X9". I had a crescent roll sheet and just doubled it. I used 5 eggs, a dash of milk, salt, pepper and Italian seasoning. I had pre cooked sausage and bacon so added both straight from fridge. Did not mix in the cheese, just covered it with cheese. Cooked at 350 for 1/2 hour then cut back to 325 for 20 minutes. Served with a side of yogurt and the hubby ate it up, didn't even want salsa. Will definitely make again.

I made this as written (expect I used all cheddar cheese) and it was yummy! I left a corner of the dish sausage free for my 2 year old and that was the best part! The eggs were very fluffy. I plan to make this again without the sausage and maybe add some veggies. Definitely recommend trying this!!

I also put the oven at 3:50. But instead of using crescent rolls I bought a premade frozen pie crust and let it thaw. To the egg mixture I added a can of Rotel diced tomatoes and green chilies. And then used mild cheddar in the mixture .   On top I put a layer of onion and green pepper and then a thin layer of cheese. It was fabulous!

Excellent  breakfast casserole. Using other reviewers suggestions, I tweaked it like this:  cooked the crescent rolls at 350 for seven minutes first. Added onions and bell peppers to the sausage (along with some Italian seasoning ) when cooking. Drained the sausage. Used 10 eggs and 3/4 cup of milk. Added some cayenne pepper and salt and pepper to the egg mixture. Mine needed to cook for about 40 minutes at 350. Came out perfectly! Everybody wanted seconds! This is a keeper.

Awesome deliciousness! Made for first time. Made some changes to recipe. Used flattened biscuits, added sauteed garlic and onion and used Mexican cheese only. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious breakfast, popular on Christmas morning! Took much longer than stated to cook so I ended up covering it in foil once the top was browning and the inside was still not set. It took about 45 minutes to set,  it came out delicious

The only reason I'm writing what I did was because it was delish and I want to remember for next time!!  I wish there was an option for adding notes without writing a review!!  I followed the other reviews and used 10 eggs, 1/2 cup of skim milk, 1 cup of mozzarella, and a cup of extra sharp cheddar.  I seasoned with 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning and salt & pepper.  I forgot to bake the crust before adding the other ingredients, and the crust was crispy.  I baked at 350 for 30 minutes, then reduced heat to 325 for another 15 minutes.  I let it set for about 10 minutes before serving and the consistency was perfect.  Next time I'll bake at 350 for 20 minutes then reduce to 325 for 20 minutes.  I also might try butter flavored Pam instead of Original when spraying my baking dish and baking crust first.

I love this recipe, so simple and so delicious. I'll make it the night before and throw it in the fridge. In the morning all I have to do is preheat the oven and toss it in. Prefect for Christmas morning breakfast, or Sunday morning bible studies.

I've been making this for years and yes...it's ALWAYS a big hit. I've done many variations on the theme, but the latest was Chorizo for a bit of a Mexican flair. DELICIOUS! Simply omit the Italian seasonings and replace with some chili powder or even a bit of taco spice and a bit of paprika. And some salsa!

Ok lots of changes based on what I had. I only had biscuits so I used about 3, flattened, to cover the bottom. Did as others suggested and precooked for about 7 minutes. Used over 1 lb of breakfast sausage because that's what I had so decided to use all up. Only had 8 eggs so used that though would have used 10 if I had enough. Did as others suggested and only used 2 cups of cheese. Had some diced onions and green peppers (from freezer) that I defrosted and threw in. This came out SO GOOD! It's simple enough that you can jazz it up but solid base recipe (with cheese adjustment). I make breakfast casseroles all the time and my daughter likes some more than others. She LOVES this one.

This is my go-to egg casserole! It comes out great every time and it's very easy to interchange ingredients with whatever you want.  I've made it with sausage and also with bacon and both were a huge hit!  Initially, I was a little leery about the oregano but that is what I think really makes this recipe!

Super delicious and really flavorful!  We made it with Italian Sausage, 10 eggs, 1 cup of each cheese, oregano, salt and pepper and loved it!  Like the other users we cooked the crescent dough for 6 minutes at 350 degrees then reduced the heat to 325, added the sausage and egg mixture and baked for 30 minutes.  Yum!

This was pretty good.  I added spinach, onions, and green peppers to it.  I had to microwave it some as the dish I use was deep and the middle was not cooking all the way through.  It was fine after microwaving.

Per other reviewers, I gave the biscuits a few minutes head start and cut the amount of cheese in half. Next time, I will stick with the amount of cheese in the original recipe :)

I made this last week and my family really liked it. After reading the other comments, I added some milk and used 10 eggs. Also, to flavor it up a little, I used about 1/2 cup of mild salsa. That really added a lot. I also used an Italian cheese blend rather than the plain mozzarella for the bottom layer and used one cup of it and one cup of cheddar on top. Yum!

It is a good go-to casserole for a crowd. Very basic and easy to throw together.  However, if it sits it gets soggy which is not so appealing the next day (that is IF you have leftovers).  I've made it twice now and it gets good comments from family and friends.

Very good and easy to make! I did cook the crescent's first like it was suggested, used 10 eggs and  I added italian seasoning.  Turned out great.  Definitely a recipe I'll use again and again.

Delicious! Not many changes, Used maple pork sausage and cooked that with onion and green pepper, did use more egg and less cheese. This is a keeper!

As is I give this recipe 4 stars. Next time I will add milk per others' suggestions because it was a little heavy. Still an amazing dish though and the entire thing was devoured in about 20 minutes. If that! Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked two of these for the brunch birthday party we had.  My 5 year old helped add the ingredients, and all our guests said they loved the casserole.  The only thing I would do to improve the casserole would be to add a vegetable next time.  I'm aware that's an individual preference.  I liked how easy it was to assemble and bake!  No overnight involved... it's great!

Eggs took too long to cook all the way through - by that point, the cheese was too much and burning. No amount of seasoning would save this dish.

I also took the advice of others and used 10 eggs and 3/4 cup milk and only 2 cups of Colby jack cheese. Cooked 
croissant for 7 minutes then added ingredients.  Started at 350 degrees for 25 minutes then 20 min on 320 degrees. Next time I will cut about 8 minutes off cook time. Will also try half and half or cream instead of milk for a creamier texture. Texture was still dense even with milk. I added salt and pepper and parsley flakes. I did not us oregano.  It was wonderful and my entire family loved it. It was my first egg casserole I ever baked and it was a success! Gave 4 stars because original recipe would not have worked unless you follow the changes viewers suggested

I thought there would be too much cheese so I added 2 more eggs for a total of 10 eggs.  The results were great.  I also added more spice because these casseroles have a tendency to be bland when done.

Followed VYLEE's "most helpful" review, except kept with 8 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, and substituted 6-7 slices crumbled bacon for sausage, added 1/4 cup chopped onion.

Have made this twice.  We really enjoyed it. Only rated 4 stars because the crescent rolls definitely must be pre-baked per other reviews. Did so the first time, and forgot the second time. Definitely makes a difference. Add seasoning and ingredients at your discretion

Tasty enough -- it would be more interesting with a few diced veggies (green onion, sweet pepper, etc.).  Personally, I think the cheese:egg ratio is off: there is so much cheese, that the egg mixture didn't puff up much.  Next time, I will put it in a slightly smaller pan (or increase by a few eggs).  Another alternative I may try: whipping the yolks & whites separately & folding the whites in last.

This is the second recipe from LeAnn that I've made and both were a hit (the other was banana pudding). I made this for a family brunch and my brother-in-law liked it so much my sister is making it for him for his birthday. It was easy to make too.

I used turkey sausage and 9 eggs with a half cup added milk. I only used 2 cups of cheese, 1 cup for each kind. Upped the oregano by a half tsp and added 1/2 tsp onion powder.

This recipe is fantastic. I love it and I plan to make it again very soon. I took a little bit of artistic license with the amount of oregano. I didn't actually have any at home, so used the freeze dried Italian seasoning that I had at home. Instead of 1 teaspoon, I probably used about 4-5. It was really great. I also added a little bit of half and half. It make it a little runny when I cut into it, but I wasn't too bothered by that. My whole family enjoyed it, even my fussy 8 year old. The first words out of his mouth were "I really like this mummy" this recipe definitely get's 2 thumbs up in our house. Thanks for sharing!

yummy! i used turkey sausage and added oregano to it while it was cooking. i also sprinkled in some broccoli florets for color/flavor, and i added a bit of salt/pepper/chili flakes to the egg as well. i only used 2 cups of cheese (mixed mozz and cheddar) and it was plenty!  very yummy!

I love these easy brunch/breakfast recipes!  I make one very similar to this and add a cup or two of frozen shredded hash browns to fill up a large crowd with less.    Try this with sage or maple sausage for a little different flavor, if you like sage or maple you won't be disappointed

I made this for our Bible class after searching for a recipe that would save me a trip to the store. Everyone loved it! It has become my new favorite breakfast casserole. I too put the bottom crescent rolls in the over for a few minutes first to get brown. Thanks!

I had a hard time cooking this in the amount of time stated. I ended up turning up the oven and cooking twice as long to get the egg to set. This made the crescent dough way over-cooked. Aside from that, the actual recipe was delicious and simple. I'm thinking next time I'll cook crescent rolls on the side and omit from the casserole. Good addition to a breakfast buffet.

This was great! I will make this again. I didn't have mozzarella. I only had slices of cheddar so I put the cheddar slice ontop of the crust, the Jimmy Deans sage sausage ontop of cheese, and then the eggs ontop. (I mixed some milk in w/ the eggs). One suggestion I wil do the next time is put the crust in the oven for about 7min like a lot of people recommended because my dough was undercooked in a few spots.

Im giving it a 4 because it is a good base recipe. I added some garlic salt, salt and pepper, used a lot less cheese and more eggs and also added a little milk. I have made something like this many times, minus the oregano and crescent rolls. I believer the more flavor you add, the better.

Pretty simple recipe.  It was good for such a simple recipe.  I will make it again, but I will try to add more things.  Green Peppers, Onions, tomatoes maybe.  Great basics though!  Thanks!

I used 10 eggs, 3/4 milk, 2 cups cheese and added a small amount of green onions, green peppers and mushrooms to the egg mixture.  I also used italian seasoning instead of oregano.  All of my guests loved it.  So I guess I give the finished product a 5 though I'm not sure how good the original recipe is!

Awesome, easy recipe.  My children were tired of sausage and eggs.  Add some cheese and crescent rolls and it was as if I'd reinvented breakfast for them.  My husband loved it, too!

Good, would make again.  Crowd pleaser.  A lot of the bread part absorbed the egg...I missed the yummy cressant rolls in their regualr form.

Easy! I whipped this up one morning without the crescent dough and saved the cheese to put on our own individual servings since some of us can't have dairy or gluten products. I precooked the sausage the night before so all I had to do was throw everything into the pan in the AM and bake while we were getting ready. Yum!

Used half the oregano for kids' sake.  Everyone loved it.  Followed recommendations to ~ half the cheese, and that seemed to be a good idea.

My picky 11 year son just went back for this third helping!   I read the reviews - and "bland" is a word some used, but it is perfect for those that don't like too many (competing)ingredients.  The oregano gave it an interesting flavor. This is a keeper!  (note:  I did use 10 eggs and 3/4 cup milk.  Precooked the crust for 5 minutes as other suggested.  Cheese is a lot - but the kids love it cheesy).

Quick and very simple, just wonderful! This is a quick go- to breakfast idea. Made it this morning and used turkey instead of pork. Also used Italian seasoning instead and also added grape tomatoes, garlic & onions, for some vegetables and added flavor.

Awesome!  So easy, and 4 picky teenagers loved it!  I think it would be great without the crust, too.  I did put the crescent rolls in the oven for about 5 minutes before adding the remainder of the ingredients.  I added oregano, onion salt, and pepper.  YUM!!!

Fantastic recipe that allows for everyone to make their personal preference adjustments.  Here is what I did.  I used 10 eggs, a 5 oz can of evaporated milk, 2 cups shredded pepper jack, 2 cups shredded extra sharp cheddar, 1 lb hot sausage, 1 red bell pepper, 1 onion, 1 14 oz can Rotel original, pepper, garlic powder and oregano.  After cooking the sausage I removed it to drain and cooked the finely chopped red pepper and onion in the sausage remains with pepper, garlic powder and oregano (I don't measure seasonings) then added the Rotel and heated and then added the sausage back in heated all together.  Mixed the eggs, milk, cheese together and added in the sausage mixture.  I baked the crescent dough for 8 minutes in my 9x13 PC stoneware dish at 350 then added the sausage and egg mixture.  I baked it for 30 minutes, turning it down to 325 after the first 10.  It was perfectly done (I can't stomach under cooked eggs) and the eggs set great.  We love cheese and may even use more next time.  My boyfriend and I loved it.  We ate 2/3 of it that night and finished it the next day for lunch.

Excellent recipe; I followed what others said by using 10 eggs. I used 3 cups of shredded cheese. I also added a glob of Dijon mustard to the egg-cheese mixture. We like it better than strata, and it's so much easier.

Used normal instant biscuits instead of crescent and was too "bready".  Use some type of "flaky" biscuits but still not that good.

We LOVED this dish!  I made it while visiting family for Easter and since we had a housefull I wanted to contribute to breakfast.  It was gone in a few minutes.  I have already made it twice since then.  When I made it for Easter, we did not have oregano on hand so that was ommitted but other than that we followed the recipe.  I added crumbled bacon to half the dish (since we have some non meat eaters in the family).  I took the advice of some and baked the crescent rolls for a few minutes before adding the rest of the ingrediants. I think it saved it from being too soggy. Also, 4 cups of cheese just seemed like a lot so we cut it back to 3.  It was great. The second time I made it I added the oregano and I will be honest and say...I didn't like it as well.  Next time I make it I will not add it...but this is easy and delish so I will definetly make it again and again.

I loved this recipe. I made it one day and then saved the rest for quick breakfasts. Other than it tasting great, the thing that I enjoy most about it is that I can make it and eat it in the same day. All the other breakfast casserole recipies that I have found call for setting bread out for a night and then letting the casserole sit overnight. I usually don't think that far ahead when making this dish.

Made this Christmas morning. This recipe is good and hearty. I used less cheese--only about 1 cup--the second time to cut back on the fat, and you can't even tell.

This was excellent! I listened to the top reviews, 10 eggs, 3/4 c. milk, and two cups of cheese,onion powder(plus salt and pepper) instead of oregano..fantastic. I also baked the crescents for 6 min. beforehand, and fried up the sausage the night before. Baked it at 325 for 25 min. then turned up the oven to 350 for 10 min. I can't wait to try other variations with this- bacon, maple sausage, etc. My 11 mos. old loved it, nice and easy for him to eat.

I read all the awesome reviews on this recipe, and I was not really impressed. I made it for a huge family gathering, and it was ok, but nothing great. So I am on the hunt again to find the best breakfast casserole...

I made this today for Easter Brunch and it was a huge hit. I did like everyone said...baked the crescent rolls for 7 minutes first. Used 10 eggs, 2 cups cheese and added some Italian seasoning. It was the perfect consistency baking 25 minutes at 350 degrees and 325 degrees for the last 20 minutes. Let it sit for 5-10 min before serving. Overall, Excellent recipe with a few tweaks. Thank you!!!

Just made this for our Easter breakfast and was a hit.  I added Tastefully Simple Spinach and herb seasoning instead of the oregano.  I did find the cooking time longer than 25-30 minutes, I left mine in for 50 minutes and honestly it could have stayed in another 5 after that.

This recipes is EASY and TASTY, definitely worth trying it. It was very good just the way the recipe is, I thought it was a lot of cheese, but that is just for my taste. Others think it's perfect.

I read through tons of reviews on this and made several changes. I cooked a pound of sausage and about 6 cut up slices of bacon together, I only used about half of the meat mixture. I pre-cooked the croissants for about 9 minutes. I used a garlic parmesan seasoning and black pepper to season the egg mixture.  The egg mixture had about the equivalent of 12 eggs (I used egg beaters) less than 2 cups of cheddar cheese, a can of mushrooms, and a can of sliced black olives. I poured everything on top of the croissants and then put a small layer of hash brown shreds on top and sprinkled more black pepper. I cooked the whole thing for about an hour and a half.  I would definitely add a sour cream or cream cheese next time for some tang and not use the hash browns, they ended up crunchy and didn't add much else. Will probably use the southwestern egg beaters or cut up onions and peppers and maybe some tomatoes. My two daughters and I like it but my husband hasn't tried it yet.

After reading a lot of reviews I had high hopes for this recipe.I made it this morning while the kids were opening presents. I followed some of the reviewers suggestions but it took about an hour to cook and it was nearly burnt on top and not to mention the dough was burnt also. Nobody ate it. Very dissapointing. Will be deleting from recipe box.

this recipe was a hit tonight for supper...i made some alterations to the original recipe though...i layered the 13x9 with the crescent rolls in the greased dish. bake at 350 for about 6 mins. as a previous cook suggested. works out well. then instead of using sausage i used thinly sliced ham & bacon bits and layered it on top of the somewhat cooked crescent rolls. i then beat 10 eggs in a bowl and added about a cup or so of co~jack cheese. poured it over the ham, bacon, and rolls. bake for 25 mins. in your pre~heated oven. when there is 2 mins. remaining i put 8 slices of american cheese over top and melted...turned out very good...family gave it a thumbs up...

Very good and probably better the next day. I decided to prebake the dough for 7 minutes as others reviewed and added 2 more eggs. Other than that the recipe stayed the same. I think green/red peppers or onions or mushrooms or chopped broccoli would go with this also. Thanks for another great breakfast casserole recipe!

Modified with: 10 eggs, 2 cups cheese (1 cheddar, 1 mozzarella), 3/4 cup milk and 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoned sausage and pre-cooked the crescent crust for 10 minutes.  Great recipe and works well to refridgerate leftovers.  I also sometimes put tabasco sauce, sliced tomatoes, a little lettuce and a little sour cream on top if I want to change it up a little bit.

Edible but not great.  I read a review that said the flavors did not blend.  I couldn't believe that you could go wrong with eggs and sausage, but, the flavors really did not blend.  We would have enjoyed just basic eggs with sausage patties more.

You can't go wrong with this recipe.  Easy and delicious!  I did follow the tips about lightly baking the crescent roll crust for about 10 minutes before adding the sausage and egg mixture.  I also cut back on the cheese because I feel the casserole is too greasy with the full amount recommended.

This was tasty, but not fabulous.  I used 10 eggs as others suggested and it took about 10 more minutes of cook time.  I also added some pepper and dashes of hot sauce.  I used green pepper sausage.  I didn't have crescent rolls, so I used Grands Buttermilk biscuits.  My boyfriend loved it, but I could do without the bread bottom.  I wanted more eggs and meat!

My sister gave me this recipe, and at times, I have substituted the sausage with ham, and even added canned tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, or other veggies in season.  Everytime I try something new, everyone loves it.  I often get asked for the recipe.

Loved it.  Lot's of cheese, but as a cheese lover, it was not too much.  :)

This was easy to make. I took some tips from other readers, and reduced the amount of cheese and added some half-and-half to the eggs (sorry, I didn't measure at 5am). Thinking I was being clever, I cooked the sausage the night before, and then forgot to add it! So, mine was a meatless breakfast casserole, and it was quite good. I used Italian seaonings, and prebaked the crescent roll crust about 5-7 minutes before adding the egg-cheese mixture. Started with oven at 350 for 20 minutes, and 300 to finish. I'd make this again; it was a breeze.

The taste of this casserole is excellent, however, the preparation is a bit more of a challenge.  The crescent roll dough was the most challenging to mess with.  I used brown and serve sausage links without cooking it first and that was good.  The egg and cheese mixture ratios in the recipe gave a very thick cheese mix.  After cooking, great.  I will make this recipe again but making some minor adjustments to the quantities of ingredients.

Yummy!  I have used bacon/or ham to replace the sausage if none was in the house.  I also omit the oregano (personal taste) and add garlic powder. I love it!

I have made this twice for company, and everyone loves it!  I use lite pork sausage and add chopped onion when cooking meat.  I also use low-fat crescent rolls and egg substitute for half the eggs.  Bake 30-35 minutes.

As is, this is a 4, but if you tweak it to your tastes, it can be a five. I made the sausage with garlic, pepper and onion. Once you have the base, you can add other spices to your liking. Everyone liked it.

The flavour in this dish was minimal- just cheese (and these cheeses by nature are pretty bland). The base was also heavy/soggy- probably a result of pouring the eggs over top. 

Sorry- this was way too bland for me.

Pretty good. Certainly easy and quick. Could have used more eggs, less cheese and oregano. Also would have benefitted from some sauteed onions and maybe a touch of milk. I thought the top browned too quickly, but that could have been my oven. Overall, pretty good but not the best.

Both my husband and I really loved this. I added bacon to mine and used an italian seasoning mixture. Next time I will also add onion. I wasn't even going to have any because I thought it sounded so much like quiche, which I don't care for, but I tried a bite of my husband's and ended up eating a serving for myself. I loved it!

Great, easy recipe.  Made it for Christmas brunch before and everyone loved it.  I made it the night before and just stuck it in the oven.  It took a little longer than the time states.

This recipe was a little dry, I think next time I will follow other reviewer's advice and make a gravy to go with casserole. This would be a good recipe for a Christmas morning.

I use this recipe quite a bit.  I usually add some Thyme, Mustard Powder, and Basil to it though.  Just for some different flavors.  I also serve with Salsa.

I made this for my husband to take to work and he said every absolutely loved it.  Per other posters, I browned my sausage with onions (the night before), used 10 eggs and 1 1/2 cup milk.  I only used cheddar cheese and I baked my for about 45 minutes.  Will definately make again so I can try it next time.

This is a very quick and easy yet delicious recipe!! My family of 6 gobbled up the whole thing--everyone including my very picky 8 and 3 year old loved it. I served it as breakfast-for-dinner with fresh fruit on the side. The flavor and creamy texture are awesome. A keeper for us.

Increased cooking time as recommended by other reviewers to 40 to 45 minutes in my oven.  I added broccoli to make it a meal in one.  Kids loved it. Might have to add more sausage next time.

I was in charge of making breakfast for everyone on Easter morn. I chose to make this recipe. Everyone like it, but I had difficulty in getting it to cook all the way through. It was a bit runny and I had to cook it longer than the recipe called for. I was also using my mother in law's oven...will try making it again in my own home.

This is a recipe I will definitely make again!  I sliced rather than crumbled the sausage and it was great.  I also added about 1/2 c. of milk as other reviewers suggested and decreased the cheese to about a cup of each.  Super!

My husband raved about this dish. I liked it for the most part, but am not a big egg fan, so I was not as ecstatic. Had to increase the cooking time a little, and it seemed like too much cheese to me. Other than that, I found it easy to make, and came out with good results.

This recipe was very easy to make.  It was so easy, I decided to make two!  In the first dish, I substituted bacon for the sausage and I used diced green ortegas.  In the second dish I used sliced deli ham and diced green ortegas.  I took the advice of others and I used Mexican Cheese in both dishes.  The two dishes were a big hit.  There were no leftovers.  :)  Thanks for the great recipe.

Made this during Christmas and it was a hit!
I used cheddar only, mozzarella did not sound appealing for b-fast. It did take alot longer to bake than stated, 50 minutes in the oven.  Next time I will try half cheddar and jack cheese.  Has anybody tried using biscuits instead of crescent dough?? I may try that also!

Awesome recipe!!!  My coworkers loved it.  After reading the reviews I decided to add a cup and a half of milk so that it wouldn't come out dry.  I used sliced Turkey Polska Kielbasa for the sausage.  And I didn't have any oregano but I sprinkled the dish with paprika before baking.  It came out fluffy and absolutely delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe.  We tried the recipe this morning and got rave reviews from all--including gourmet cook daughter, and picky eater daughter.  I added the recipe to my recipe box and will definitely do it again.
