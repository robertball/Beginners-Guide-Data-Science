This was great.  I used it as a template.  To make it healthier, I upped the amount of onions, added dry red wine and served without cheese and bread.  A few days later I wanted to make the leftovers more of  "meal", so I added some French lentils that I cooked in beef broth, red wine and thyme.  Awesome, awesome, awesome stuff!!

Soup was good, but I don't recommend using low sodium broth unless your diet calls for it. I made it again after using regular beef broth, and it was perfect!

The wine was way too overpowering.  I couldn't even finish my bowl.  It also didn't have the nice richness that makes a good French Onion soup.

My husband and I did not like this recipe.  Too sweet.  Too much sherry.  Not enough onions.  I won't try this recipe again.  There are many good French Onion recipes out here!

I didn't measure anything, and I used white and yellow onions and butter instead of red onions and olive oil.  This recipe is great because it explains how you get the rich onion flavor, and it's from the browning.  My onions were really browned and tasty.

I added a bunch of worcestershire.

I didn't think the wine flavor was too strong but I didn't really measure it (I added a splash, maybe 1/2 cup and 1/4 Worcestershire.

This was my first time making this soup and it turned out great! I didn't put enough beef broth in it and I had 2 onions left over. I used Baby Swiss to top it off. Great reviews from my family!

It is not worth the time and effort to make this soup. I could barely finish it.
