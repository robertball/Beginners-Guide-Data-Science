This stuff is fantastic.  You can slather it on anything or serve it along side something to dip in it.  I used my own homemade curry powder but any store bought would do.

Love this recipe.  I usually double it and add a few shakes of hot sauce for a little kick.

I first made this  sauce exactly by the recipe.  It was WAY too sweet.  So I added another 1/4 C mayonnaise and 1/4 C of mustard.  It was a bit better, but still too sweet.  The honey was so overpowering that I could barely taste the other ingredients. I thought about just dumping it, but then decided to add an 1/8 tsp of lemon juice .  The lemon really helped.  But it still wasn't a sauce to brag about.  Finally, I just dumped a tsp of red chili  flakes into it.  The flakes at least added  a bit of interest to the sauce.  With my fixes it's OK.  But, I won't be making this again.

We basted this on bar-b-qued chicken breasts and it was very good.

I found this recipe a little too sweet.  I will put half as much honey in my future sauces.

I made this not too long ago and it was soooo tasty.  I ended up frying cut up chicken breasts and it turned out good.  Never made this before and is going to be my go to honey mustard sauce and my 2 yr old loved it :-)
