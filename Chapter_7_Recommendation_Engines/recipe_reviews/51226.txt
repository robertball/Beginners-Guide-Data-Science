Boil the ingredients.  The instructions don't say anything about cooking the sauce, but it is much, much better after its been cooked.  As is, it was very gel-like, but cooked, you get a very flavorful sauce.

Great BBQ sauce!!!  I cut the recipe in half for smoked baby back ribs. There's really no need to put this in a blender, just a bowl. I highly recommend putting this on the stove in a saucepan and letting it come to a boil for about one minute.  Then take it off the stove and let it cool. This will let it thicken and allow the flavors to come through. If you like a sweeter sauce keep this recipe the same, if not cut back on the sugar.  If you're like me and like a smoky BBQ sauce add 1/2 tsp. of liquid smoke for half the recipe or 1 tsp. for the whole recipe.

Ran out of Sweet Baby Ray's and needed something to make BBQ Country Style Ribs submitted by Glenda U. It would be foolish to ever buy the store bought kind again. You just can't compare them. This was great! Husband loved it, kids liked it....my 10 year old even put some on the side for dipping. I did exactly what the recipe stated. Also, I don't really think it had a "kick" it was sweet and tangy. This is my BBQ sauce for now on. Thanks for sharing.

wow this is an extradonary sauce. its great the way it is but if you add my modifications, you will have the greatest bbq suace you have ever had. instead of 1 tbl worcestershire sauce use 1/2 cup. add 2 cloves of garlic (minced). delete pepper sauce and use 1 teaspoon of ground cayanne pepper.if this isnt the greatest sauce you have ever had let me know.

WOW - this is one killer recipe! I think it's unfair for cooks to make half a dozen changes and then rate so I prepared exactly as written and yum yum yum! Some of the best spareribs I've ever prepared. Note - I did you use Chipolte Tabasco for the hot sauce because it was all I had on hand.

I needed a quick bbq sauce fix to marinate, then cook 1.5 lbs of boneless pork ribs in the oven for tomorrow.  I chose this one because I had all the ingredients and it sounded good.  I scaled it to yield 8 - just the right amount for this meal.  I wish I had made more.  I followed each measurement exactly and love the result, especially for this.  A perfect taste/texture for an overnight marinade and cooking.  Thanks.  It's a keeper for sure.

This is the BEST BBQ sauce ever!  Found this recipe one day when out of bottled sauce, and it was fantastic!  I will never buy bottled BBQ sauce again, my family won't let me!  I find using a hand mixer is better than the blender, not quite as messy.  We now double the recipe when making as it goes so fast in our home.  Great on beef, chicken, pork, you name it.  We also warm it with a little beer to give it a different flavor.  My picky 10 year old loves it too!  Try it, you won't regret it!

Great sauce! I have made this several times now and I feel I have it perfected at least in my mind. I used only 1 cup brown sugar, 1 1/2 cups ketchup, 1/4 cup balsamic and 1/4 cup red wine vinegars, 1/2 cup beer, 2 1/2 tablespoons dry mustard, 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, 2 teaspoons sweet Hungarian paprika, 1 teaspoon each of Emerils Bayou Blast, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper and kosher salt. After blending well I simmer it for almost an hour. This is so good on so many different things! If too spicy it can easily be adjusted but the best thing about it is, it is so much cheaper to make this sauce than it is to buy any of them from the store. Try it! You won't be dissapointed. FYI Instead of pizza sauce use this on a pineapple and ham pizza. It'll make your eyes roll back in your head!

So at first I didn't really love it, but it was ok. I let it sit over night and the next day I tasted it and it seemed a little better. Well it definitely has grown on me, I love it. My hubby loves it too, and he is very picky about this sort of thing. I will say that it has a little more of a kick to it then I prefer so next time I will use a little less of the dry mustard. No more ketchup for me anymore, I put this stuff on EVERYTHING!!

I was making bbq ribs and ran out of bbq sauce so I needed a quick and easy recipe.  I tried this one and loved it.  I usually bought prepared sauces but I don't think I ever will again.  Even my husband asked me to make it again.  The only thing I changed was that I used balsamic vinegar because I didn't have red wine vinegar on hand.

I'd cut back to about 1 cup of sugar, but this was wonderful and so easy.  I really liked that it didn't have to cook in advance.  Thanks for sharing -- this is a KEEPER.

Like the previous reviewer, I hate when people modify a recipe and then review it. But in this case, I was justified. ;) I was looking for a sauce recipe that was more on the sweet side and with less fire. I had most of the ingredients for this so I tried it. I halved the recipe. I didn't have dry mustard or rice wine vinegar, so I used a generous squirt of prepared yellow mustard and regular white vinegar. Also, I left out the hot sauce. I really liked it. I'll see what my husband thinks when he gets home - this could very well be a keeper!

This is the best bbq sauce ever!  I took the advice of others and brought the ingredients to a slow boil for 5 minutes AFTER I put them in the blender.  This way the vinegar was well mixed and blended with other flavors.  I will never buy bbq sauce again!

I found this recipe to be very fun because we took this and ran with it.  I used all the ingrediants as a base and played around with it and produced a darn good BBQ sauce: First, I took 3 TBLS butter, 1 tsp minced garlic and 1 med onion (minced) and sauted them.  Then I used the following amts: 2 TBLS REG vinegar, 6 TBLS brn sugar, 2 TBLS OJ, 2c ketchup, 1/2c water, 2 tsp salt, 4 TBLS worchtshire sauce and (get this) 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I then simmered ALL this in a pot over med heat for apprx 45 minutes...VERY GOOD.  Semi spicy, semi sweet.  The flavors blended well and worked great with our grilled chicken, a pork marinade, and nice dipping sauce for steak. Thanks JR for lighting a fire of creativity within me...and providing me the basics of a great BBQ sauce!

Good BBQ sauce; will use less brown sugar next time as it seemed a little too sweet; substituted apple cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar only because I only had the apple cider vinegar.

Almost too good to be true.Easy to make and wonderfully balanced taste. Not too sweet, not too spicy, no overwhelming individual flavors. I used Heinz Ketchup and sauce was a little too thick for me (before now I didn't think that was possible) so I added 1/2 cup of Coke and it was perfect. Not quiet as sweet as Sweet Baby Ray's which is fine for me though wife wants me to make it a little sweeter next time.

I made this for the holiday BBQ, pork ribs.  BIG hit!  At first I thought it was a bit too tangy from the vinegar, so I added about 1/4 cup of molasses.  Also left out the tabasco due to spice sensitive friends, we divided it and added some cayenne to half.  I also simmered it on the stove for a bit.  It IS a bit sweet - adding molasses was a questionable tinker - but if you like the honey type sauces you'll probably like this.  Definitely will be making again!!!  Update:  My friends are making a double recipe this weekend - they definitely like it!  Update #3: I forgot, we ran out of ketchup and used 1 cup of tomato sauce...so 1/2 c. ketchup and 1 8 oz. can tomato sauce....

Wow! I was doing a recipe that called for a cup of BBQ sauce and I only had 1/2 C available of a 'bottled' brand, so...I dashed over here and found this. Am I glad I did! I whipped up a 1/2 cup and taste-tested them both. This far outdid the bought one...I couldn't stop licking my fingers. Thanks so much.

Too sweet and spicy for my taste. I used the proportions as a guideline and adjusted too much to give an honest review of this recipe. My version is saved as "Mom's BBQ Sauce, Recreated by ellen".

This is a good BBQ sauce.  I thought there was a little too much black peppper for the taste of my family.  My hubby and I enjoyed it but my kids didn't care too much for it.  I decreased the sugar a bit, that could have been why.  I also simmered it on the stove for about 10 minutes for the flavors to blend together and then basted on skinned chicken leg quarters.

You can ditch a lot of salt and make the sauce thicker by using unsalted tomato paste with onion and garlic powder to replace the ketchup. Simmering it will thicken it up as well. Just as good and way less salty.

Ok people, I must confess, I am a bit of a bbq sauce snob.  I have several favorite recipes, all take a ton of ingredients and time to simmer.

Tonight, I found myself in a pinch.  I was making grilled pork chops, quickie dinner for the kids, and planned on using my usual Sweet Baby Rays brown sugar bottled sauce.  Gah, I was out!  So I hit up Google to find a quick, sweeter sauce, which is my preference.  

I hit on this gem.  I didn't have high hopes, despite the reviews, because I have faith in the sauces and methods I have used in the past.  The only substitution I made was apple cider vingar instead of red wine; partially because I was out of the red, also because I prefer the apple cider vinegar in a sauce to be used with pork.  I added a bit of granulated garlic, for personal preference.  And I also went a bit light on the ground mustard, as the container was almost empty and I didn't even realize it!

Like others, I let it simmer for a bit.  It tasted quite decent raw, but the flavors really need some heat to gel.  Once it finished, it was amazing!  I prefer a sweet sauce, so this was right up my alley.  Those that don't, just decrease the brown sugar.  I used Sriracha for the hot sauce, and a few extra squirts of it.  It gives a fantastic background heat, mild but there, that sneaks up on you.  

Try this one !  Tweek to your tastes if needed, but is fantastic as is!  Thank you for posting!

Wow!  This makes a fantastic, rich and sweet sauce.  It is by far the best sauce I have ever tried...I prepared it exactly as the recipe required.  In the future I may cut back on the brown sugar just a tad, but overall it is a fabulous recipe!

This is the best recipe I have had outside of a restaurant. I have tried many other recipes and they just don't compare. This is sweet and savory with not too much heat. Definitely a keeper. :)

needs garlic and onion powder. I also added a packet of Starbucks Via Instant Coffee. It really kicks it up a notch.

I was looking for something quick with basic ingredients. I really didn't expect much because of the effort this recipe requires. I was pleased to have been so satisfied with this BBQ sauce. It has something for everyone, spice, sweetness, ease, Some might prefer a smokey flavor so go ahead and add 1 tsp. of Liquid Smoke.

Tasty BBQ sauce recipe as written--5 Stars from the cook in the house.  That being said, I have an entire family of finicking eaters, so I needed to make a few adjustments to suit their pallet.  I decreased, by half, the red wine vinegar; decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup; and increased the Worcestershire to 2 T; Oh, and I didn't mention to my family that I used mustard! What they don't know won't hurt them:)  Thanks for the delicious recipe--I won't ever need to purchase store-bought BBQ sauce again.

Excellent, I always use regular yellow mustard instead of dry and bring all ingredients to a boil and then simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes.

Very good sauce but a little too sweet for me.  I cut the sugar in half and added more vinegar and hot sauce for a spicier version of this sauce.

My Mom's been making this same recipe since I was little and she passed it on to me. I think it came in her "Osterizer" cookbook. The only difference is it calls for soy sauce instead of Worcestershire. You definitely don't need the full measure of sugar, it is good with as little as a couple of tablespoons. GREAT on grilled chicken!

Made this sauce for our family and now have made it twice for hostess gifts. Something a little different than wine or flowers!  I made the recipe as is, using Chipotle Tabasco and Penzey's Smoked Spanish Paprika.  Gave it that smoky kick we love!  I just keep saving the ketchup bottles and making cute labels to give them away. (anyone who hasn't tried Penzey's spices, do so!  They're online and their selection and quality can't be beat!  The Viet Namese Cinnamon is to DIE FOR!!)

Nice and sweet with a kick.  We used it to make Barbeque Chicken Pizzas and it was perfect.  I didn't have any red wine vinegar so I had to substitute white instead, but it was still quite good.

This was very sweet so next time I will start with less sugar.  Loved the idea of putting it in the ketchup bottle, worked out great.  The consistancy was great.  This would have been great as-is for ribs but I was serving with chicken so I added 1-1/2 tsp of liquid hickory flavoring and about 1/2 of cup of pre-made hot bbq sauce to season it up.  Everyone liked it and just as good as store-bought.

I made this last night and I disagree. Sauce is much better cooked. Thickens right up. I am visiting my daughter ( new grandbaby) needed bbq sauce quick. This was perfect. I ran out of ketchup used chilli sauce no red wine vinegar used apple cider vinegar. Was very good base to work off.

Pretty good for a homemade sauce, with all ingredients you'd probably have at home. I only made 1/4 of the recipe to try with a sweet and spicy recipe I was going to make. Instead of the blender, I just combined all ingredients in a small saucepan, brought it to a boil and let it cook for 1 minute. My taste preference would be to cut back on the red wine vinegar, probably by half. Next time I'll also cut back on the sugar. I used smoky paprika and added a little more. Thanks for the easy and good recipe!

I ran out of BBQ sauce and needed something fast using the ingredients I already have. I only used half the recipe and I didn't have red wine vinegar or sweet chili sauce so had to use apple cider vinegar and a little cayenne pepper. I cooked it and put it in a squeeze bottle after it cooled (my son loves spicy bbq sauce on his hot dogs). Although I love sweet and spicy sauces, I didn't "love" this one as it was a bit too sweet for me. I added more Worcestershire sauce, a little garlic and onion powder to cut the sweetness. It came out perfect. This will definitely be my permanent go-to BBQ recipe. Thanks!

This is really good! I did make some changes to suit our tastes but it was good before changes. I had to leave out the paprika since I was out, added 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tbs. molasses, 1 tsp. liquid smoke and I did simmer it on the stove for a while. It never got thick enough so I also added a small amount of corn starch slurry. I won't be buying sauce again!

I needed BBQ sauce in a pinch and this whipped out really quick!  It has a good flavor with a little bit of spice.  It makes a lot of sauce - so I have a lot of barbecuing to do!

Wow!  I will never purchase BBQ sauce again.  I added a Tablespoon of Molasses and brought to a slow boil.  Continued to boil for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Thick, rich and delicious.  Perfection!

Absolutely fabulous BBQ Sauce. It makes a lot of wonderful sauce, but it lasts a long time! I did make it a bit hotter, but spicy and hot is our preference. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband picked out this recipe because it had great reviews, he made it to a tee, didn't change anything. It is way to sweet with ketchup and brown sugar, all you can taste is ketchup. We cooked it a bit then tried adding stuff and finally didn't use it because it wasn't worth ruining the ribs we were about to bbq.

A very quick easy and tasty BBQ sauce. I put it in the slow cooker with some pork roasts and made sandwiches. Yum! a couple of great family meals! The only thing I did differently was use smoked paprika to add some smoky flavor and add only 1/2 cup of sugar as I think it is sweet enough. Great recipe :0)

This is a great recipe by itself but I also love trying new things so I changed it a little bit. I used balsalmic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, I left out the dry mustard and the black pepper, but I added some garlic powder and white pepper. Instead of the water I used freshly brewed coffee. I simmered it on the stove for a few minutes and tried it and it was yummy then but after letting it sit in the fridge overnight it was even better. Mine came out sweet with a little kick, love it!

I came across this recipe about a year and a half ago.  Thank you so much.  I am allergic to most BBQ sauces, but made this one and no problem.  My whole family loves it.  My husband thinks it is better than Sweet Baby Ray's.  I can't keep enough of it made up.

Sweet & Tangy!!! This is very easy and pretty good if you like sweet sauces. I did use Cider vinegar instead of white and much more hot sauce. And I simmered it for about 10 minutes before refridgerating. But overall, I'd make it again.

This is the first BBQ sauce I have ever made and it's fabulous.  Needed something quick and easy to go with my slow cooked chicken and this compliments it beautifully.  Tastes so much better than store bought that I will use this from now on when I need a simple sauce.  Can't wait to try this as a marinade in the slow cooker.  Thanks for posting.

Great sauce and easy to make. I only used 1 cup brown sugar and had to use spicy mustard as i had no dry mustard. Also added a splash of beer. Blended and then brought to a boil. Used some on some chicken wings that I rubbed with the "Spicy chicken Breasts" rub. The sauce is sweet at first then leaves your lips hot and spicy. The mixture of the rub and sauce was amazing and I challenge anyone to say otherwise. My wife, mom, and myself gobbled up about 2 1/2 lbs worth of wings in no time. Thanks for both recipes.

I scaled the recipe down to 10 servings.  This is a smooth, silky thin sauce.  I did boil on the stove for a short time to try and thicken up.  I used some of it in the Quick Spicy Chili recipe from this site.  Also would be good on bbq chicken.

I was almost done with dinner and discovered I didn't have the BBQ sauce in the pantry I thought I had.  With four little ones, I figured it was easier to make some than to try to head to the store.  I tried this one, and was not disappointed.  It was easy enough the kids could help.  Everyone loved it!  As it turned out, I also didn't have any red wine vinegar, so I used cider vinegar (which I believe went even better with the shredded pork loin.)  I like the smokey taste of many sauces, so I did add a full tablespoon of liquid smoke to the full recipe.  The next time I may add more.  As someone who always uses store bought, I really enjoyed this, and I'm debating ever buying ready made when this is too easy to whip up!

This sauce is awesome! I put it on some Pork shoulder, that went on the grill and wow! One thing though I left out the salt because I think the ketchup already has enough as it is.

Very yummy. My only complaint is that we tasted the sauce all night (rather acidic and spicy). It didn't keep us from eating leftovers the next day, however, or my husband from adding habanero hot sauce to every bite. ;)

DEELISH!  my only mistake was making the whole thing then putting it on my pork with a brush and contaminating the sauce from the raw meat instead of only using what I needed...had to throw away the whole batch after using it for the ribs but it's easy to make and next time I know to save some before basting!

This sauce was totally awesome added to my pulled pork.  My husband just raved about it when usually he likes to stick to bottled BBQ sauce.  Very easy to make, I added some onion and garlic powder and a little extra hot sauce.  YUMMY!!!

Not what I really like in a sauce.  I was looking for more of what I term "traditional" - more like a BBQ potato chip.  This was a little sweet for us.

This bbq sauce is great.  Has a nice kick to it.  It is a nice change from regular bbq sauce which I find to have a way to overpowering smell.  This recipe is a must try!

Saturday afternoon:  going to make my husband a bbq pork sandwich with leftover porkchops.  Didn't have bbq sauce, which oddly, is vital for a bbq pork sandwich (HA!).  This is the first recipe I came to and a keeper!!!  It's delicious and the entire recipe contains ingredients most of us already have in the house!!!

Delicous!!!

It was very good, however I used an aged red wine vinegar and it was a little overpowering.I added a quarter cup bottled (bulls eye) to cut the vinegar and it worked out great. I used it on baby backs and it was fine.

Excellent! I cut the recipe down just to see if I would like it, and I sure did! I made the whole 32 serving batch the next day, and used the suggestion that it would fit a 32 oz container, just like the ketchup bottle I had finished off. I did not use a blender or processor, but cooked all the ingredients carefully in the microwave.  That melted the brown sugar, and smoothed it all out very nicely. I will have to keep a container of this in the fridge at all times!  4/20/18 - P.S. - I totally omitted the salt; ketchup and Worcestershire sauce  have plenty on their own. I also added a tsp of sriracha sauce for a little kick the 3rd time I made it. And I simmered it on the stove, rather than heat it in the microwave. You can control the thickness that way. Just excellent!

This recipe was so easy, and so good! I did make a few alterations.  First off, I did a cup of brown sugar, half a cup honey. I used apple cider vinegar,  and instead of water I used beer. I didn't  have worchesterchire sauce, so I used soy sauce. Scaled the dry mustard back to 2 tablespoons,  and I blended 2 cloves of garlic and half an onion for flavor. I also simmered on low for an hour just to let the flavors really meld together.  I really enjoyed the effect it had. I will use this in the future for sure!

I put everything into a pan and brought to a boil as was suggested in other comments. The result was too ketchupy-sweet for me. I added about a 1/3 cup molasses, remembering it from the ingredients list of another bbq recipe, reboiled and simmered and yum!

I only give 5 stars to the "best of the best".  This one deserved it.  It was perfect, as proclaimed by my family and me.  I cut the recipe in half and used it on boiled chicken I finished on the grill.  I can't remember why but I left out the hot sauce.  It was "better than Sweet Baby Rays".  When it comes to barbecue sauce, that means a lot.

This sauce came out awesome!   I made some changes.  I did simmer it on the stove for 5 minutes and I did not have paprika so I added garlic powder, 
onion powder and some Montreal steak seasoning, about a tsp. of each, a little less steak seasoning.  It came out so good!  I will definitely be making this again!

This was an awesome BBQ sauce.  As other reviewers suggested, I also brought this to a boil and simmered a few minutes.  I loved it as is but added 1 tsp of liquid smoke which made this perfect for my family!  Husband really loved it!  We won't be buying BBQ sauce anymore - this is my go to recipe from now on!

This was excellent!! I have to say I'm not a very big fan of BBQ sauce this is why I didn't have any in the fridge so I had to make it. I didn't have Worcestershire so I used Liquid Smoke instead. Loved it - I can't wait to make it again.

This was pretty good but much too heavy on the black pepper. try adding half first then more to taste. It was also lacking something, needed a more full bodyed flavor so I added a tblsp of tomatoe paste. That made it perfect!

I thought this sauce was just OK.  I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for liquid smoke because I can't find that in Germany, but I think that might be essential for the type of BBQ sauce I really like.  I will try a different recipe next time, after I get some liquid smoke from the States!

This was very good. I made it as is and then I made it with a few changes. Omited the water, added 2 teaspoons of liquid smoke(hickey) 4 more dashes of hot sause, omited the salt and added about 1/2 teaspoon of crushed peppers and about 4 shakes of chilli powder. I love it! I think I have found my sauce!

Twice now I've doubled the recipe and used it in the crockpot with a bunch of lunchmeat ham for a potluck.  It's been a hit!  I do cook it down some, but other than that I make no changes.  Great recipe.

This sauce is awesome if you are in training to be a flame eater. I did not add the hot sauce but I did add the recommended amount of pepper and wow my nose was running and I was burning all the way down. That was just from taste testing! if I would have added the hot sauce it would have burnt my gizzard out! Next time I will only add 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. The paprika was so strong it left a bitter taste in the back of my throat. I will cut it in 1/2 next time. I did not add the water cuz I wanted a thicker sauce. Loooooooooooooove the thick BBQ sauces. I took a members advice and added garlic powder and onion powder to taste. We love garlic and onions are yummy. It is a must to cook this sauce on the stove top. To tame it down I added 1/2 c. more brown sugar and 1c. of mayo and made the BEST Creamy BBQ Sauce I have ever tasted!!!!!!!! This recipe is totally a keeper. I just had to make some adjustments. I do not like to be in pain while eating. Not to mention that a flowing nose at the diner table is not appealing. LOL I hope this is helpful.......................We have had this a lot since we made this. We are having this again tomorrow. We can't get enough of this!!!

I have now made this many times and it is wonderful! I add about 4-5 drops of liquid smoke to mine and it gives it a wonderful flavor. I come from a "Sweet Baby Rays" loving family and everyone likes it. Be sure to bring to a boil, it helps with the blending of the flavors. Good blend of sweet and spicy. Nice and easy, thanks for posting.  God Be With You.

This is pretty darn tasty. I used 3/4 cup of splenda instead the brown sugar and used reduced sugar ketchup for a low-carb version(lower than most recipes). It was sooo good. It's exactly the kind of bbq sauce I like, sweet and zesty. I also added a little liquid smoke and omitted the water, just because I like my sauce a little thicker.

A tasty sauce that is easy to make.  I put this on steak and didn't really care for it with that meat in particular.  I think it would go much better with chicken or pork and will try that next time.

Just what I was looking for.  This one is delicious on pizza instead of tomato sauce...for a more tangy flavor. It would be great used traditionally too!

For some reason everybody that tasted it thought it had horseradish in it.  I couldn't believe it then I tried it and I agree.  I'm not sure if it was the vinegar or the dry mustard.  Or a combination of both.  When I was making it I thought the amount of dry mustard it called for was a lot but I followed the recipe to a tee.  I tried some on a roast beef sandwich the next day and it wasn't bad.  Of course, I normally put horseradish on roast beef!!

WOW this was so good! I am a big Sweet baby Ray's BBQ sauce fan, but discovered I was out and already had ribs in the smoker, So I made this awesome sauce, Sweet Baby Rays no more!, Only change I did was eliminate the hot sauce and added four Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce into the blender and it gave it just the right amount of sweet heat.

Never buy BBQ sauce again! My boyfriend made this a few months back and we loved it! I made it for the first time myself. Didn’t change a thing. Amazing! No need for blender. And yes, heat this sauce! This will be a staple in my house forever!

This bbq sauce was not too sweet, not too spicy. It was perfect. We followed the instructions exactly with no tweeks. We cooked it in a crock pot  for about 3 hours with 3lbs of pork loin. It only required another cup of water about half way through cooking. I can't wait to make this sauce again with the family!

I had forgotten how easy delicious BBQ sauce is to make.  This is an excellent basic recipe you can adjust any way you want.  I made 1/2 the printed recipe and added a 1/4 t liquid smoke.  Next time I made add more vinegar to make it more like North Carolina sauce, or play with the sugar/hot sauce.  Be imaginative but start with this.  ...Oh, yes, definitely cook it to a slow boil and turn it off to cool before using.

I cut recipe in 1/2 and added only 1/2 cup sugar and it's  still plenty sweet. I used balsamic vinegar because I didn't have red wine vinegar.  I wisked in bowl and then boiled on stove for 1 minute.  Very good, will make again.

This is a great base if modified. If followed as is it is too sour and to sweet and salty. I agree with other reveiwers simmering it for five minutes creates a much better sauce. I cut the sugar,salt,and vinegar in half added a half teaspoon garlic powder then simmered five minutes. The result was outstanding...not to sweet not to sour but full of flavor. We will not purchase bottled sauce from here in.
 Using this modified base I made a batch and added a half cup of brewed pecan flavored coffee. Used it on brisket, ribs and chicken. To get a sauce this delicious I would have to stand in line two hours at a well known BBQ restaurant.

AWESOME SAUCE!!!! I made this sauce because I did not realize we were out of BBQ sauce. I started with less sugar as many recommended, but added the full amount when adjusting seasonings. I replaced the hot sauce with Sirracha because that's what I had. It came out a little spicy so I added a can of tomato sauce to compensate. I did cook the sauce as many others did. This sauce was delicious on ribs...my peeps loved it and I had a large mason jar left over for next time! My daughter was scraping  and eating the remanence from the pot!

Made the recipe exactly as written, at first.  Like others have said, very sweet and tangy (which is what I prefer), but the consistency of the sauce wasn't to my liking - very thick and it didn't seem like the dry ingredients blended in enough after mixing.  Decided to bring it to a boil on the stove, like others had done, and that made a tremendous of difference.  I'd give it a 5-star after boiling; 3-star as written.

This recipe is almost the same one that my parents made back in Kentucky.   We never bought Barbecue sauce because I don't think it was available.  The only thing that I changed was I used chili sauce instead of ketchup because that was the recipe my parents used.  I have been looking for this recipe for years.   Thank you JRNEUMILLER.

Had a recipe that I really loved but couldn't find it after the move, came across this one and it was practically spot on. I halved the recipe but will make more next time. I did not use the blender, but simmered it on the stove top since that is what I am use to doing. Did add extra hot sauce and a touch of onion powder. Was a big hit even for the kiddo who says he doesn't like BBQ sauce. In fact, the hubby even put it on his pasta. Thanks for sharing!

I had chicken thighs and wanted to make BBQ Chicken in the oven, and I had ran out of Store Bought BBQ Sauce, so looked for a quick to do BBQ Sauce and came across this one. Since it was the 1st time I followed the recipe, but halved the measurements as to make exactly what I needed. I usually would cook the sauce for about 30 mins, but since it was going to be oven roasted at 400F for 35 mins no need to cook the sauce. So, little canola oil to coat the chicken, some garlic salt to season the chicken, then mixed the chicken with all the sauce and poured into a baking dish and into the pre-heated oven; total prep time about 7-8 mins, plus 35 mins watching TV for the chicken thighs to cook. Chicken came out delicious!!! For the sauce, I didn't have powder mustard, so used regular yellow mustard, and had ran out of paprika, so used some chili powder. As for the hot sauce, I have about 7 different hot sauces in my pantry, I decided to use Siracha; about 1 TBS for the whole recipe, but adjust to your liking. Siracha BBQ Sauce was a hit!!! The great thing about this sauce is that you can use tweak the recipe to your taste; you can use less sugar, add more vinegar, add garlic (powder, fresh, roasted, etc.), add onions (powder, fresh, caramelized, red, vidalia, etc.), use more or less hot sauce, use different types of hot sauce, etc. I would recommend cooking the sauce some 30 mins., also, this is a sweet thick sauce, so it will benefit from using just a tad more water.

Didn't have red wine vinegar. But I did have Apple Cider vinegar. Also had very little Worcestershire so I added a little liquid smoke and a teaspoon of soy sauce, garlic powder and dash of chili powder. Turned out great. Just as is. No boiling. I poured it on top of a Chicken in the Slow Cooker with a can of Whole Cranberry Sauce and onions.

This is probably one of the BEST bbq sauces that I have ever tried!  The only thing that this sauce needs is a little liquid smoke unless you use charcoal, but other than that it is just perfect.  It is the only one I make for everything from chicken to pork and even beef.  I haven't found anything that this stuff isn't great on!

I made this recipe for pulled pork because I was out of bottled barbeque sauce.  I was looking for a quick barbeque sauce.
This was great and definitely a keeper.  I used less brown sugar.  
Also, since I did not have any wine vinegar, I used balsamic vinegar.
This was so easy to make, I doubt I would ever buy bottled barbeque
sauce again.

Hi folks!
I made this sauce tonight for dinner when I realized I was out of barbecue sauce in the pantry. Lucky me!  This sauce is wonderful. I made pull pork sandwiches. My husband loved it. I did do something different though. After reading over the reviews, I decided to cook the sauce. I did not use a blender. I did use a wire whisk. After getting a soft boil, I then simmered for about 15 minutes. I think next time I'll tweak it to my taste. I might try crushed pineapple. But please try this recipie. I loved it!

This is very tasty. Even though I made changes, it was great, and everyone loved it. I didn't have enough ketchup, so I used half a jar of salsa lol. I cut brown sugar down by 1/2 cup. I didn't add wirstishire so didnt add it, I didn't have dry mustard so used hot dog mustard lol, and I left out the hot sauce. I added 2 cups of water, put the ribs right in it, and boiled it a few hours. When it was all done, the sauce was perfect, the ribs were falling apart, and it was awesome!

This had excellent flavor! My picky husband who will ONLY eat Sweet Baby Rays even liked this well enough that he didn't break out the bottle from the fridge. I thought it was excellent, although I would prefer if it had been a bit thicker. Great tasting bbq sauce! I didn't intend to change anything, however I only had half the amount of dry mustard it called for, and it was still excellent. I did boil it on the stove as well.

I never buy bbq sauce anymore since I have found this recipe.  As others have suggested I cook it for about 15 or 20 minutes.  My husband really likes it too.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This sauce is delicious! I did add some liquid smoke and then simmered all of the ingredients for about 15 minutes. My whole family loved it!

This is so easy and so good.  I had about 1/4 cup of tomato sauce left over in the refrigerator  so I also added that to use it up.

This sauce is a good base, but for me I needed more heat and sweet. About a 3/4 tablespoon of sriracha and about a tablespoon and a half of molasses made this peeeerfect!

It was super yummy!!! I don't think I will buy pre-made BBQ sauce again. The only things I changed was I used white wine vinegar and not quite so much of it and prepared mustard, and that was because of what I had on hand. I also added a dash of garlic powder. I agree with the others that you need to simmer the sauce on the stove and putting it in the blender is not necessary.

WOW, ok I am the first to admit BBQ sauce always came from a bottle in my family. But.... it was raining so bad this morning I didn't want to go to the store after I found out I had no BBQ sauce. So I tried (using that word very loosely)to make my own. I AM here to say never going back to bottled again. Not only was it super easy to make it was fantastic. I did simmer it first, and used balsamic instead of red wine. Try it you'll like it... Can not wait to tell my husband I did it.. He's gonna flip.

Good recipe, and I agree with others that less sugar is ideal. Two notes: hot pepper sauce. For those of us who don't keep a vague bottle of this around, toss that out the window (since we're talking about a homemade sauce) and replace it with some finely grated cayenne pepper. Second note: cut the ketchup amount and replace with a good-quality tomato paste, such as Amore, if any Italians will be attending. They will show all the more love for the chef guaranteed.

This is SWEET. I cut the sugar to 1/4 of a cup and it was still a little too sweet for me. But it is a good base sauce recipe. I added more heat to mine

I have made this twice.  It is the best bbq sauce in the world.  I will not be buying any more bbq sauce since I have found this recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  I make it exactly as stated but I took others advice and cook for about 10 or 15 minutes.  It's the best.

I found this to be too sweet and not enough depth in flavor. However, this is a decent sauce if you have minimal ingredients.

Very easy and very yummy.  this sauce came in handy when I realized I had no bottled barbq sauce at home.  I added some more hot pepper sauce for my buffalo wings and they came out great.  saved the leftover in an empty ketchup bottle.

Yummy!  I cut the recipe in half and didn't have any paprika, but it is wonderful without it.  I can't imagine how good it will be with it.  I didn't add any salt, either, since we're on a salt-restrictive diet.

I used this sauce in lieu of bottled sauce for the recipe "Zesty Slow Cooker Chicken Barbecue". It was a big hit. I didn't use the blender or anything. I just threw all the ingredients with the chicken in a crockpot and left it for several hours.

This was excellent however we changed it a little. We do not use hot sauce so we omitted that and added 1 tsp. of liquid smoke.  Best BBQ sauce we have ever tasted!

A huge hit with the family!  I didn't realize I was out of bottled BBQ sauce so I needed something quick.  It was great just as it was...I just added extra worcestershire sauce b/c we like it.

This is THE BEST BBQ sauce you will ever make! So unbelievably good! Sweet and tangy, without being over-the-top. I followed directions almost exactly, subbed smoked paprika for the regular kind because that is what I had. Seriously, make this sauce. You will not regret it!

Very quick and easy to make, cooking would probably improve. I substituted apple cider for most of the sugar and water and white wine vinegar for red, no mustard and more paprika. With smoked chicken it was amazing.

I was in a pickle when didn't have bottled sauce for BBQ beef sandwiches and used this recipe.  This is most delicious homemade BBQ sauce. I didn't have dry mustard and used just regular bottled mustard.  Thanks for sharing and going to make a few batches to freeze and have on hand when needed!!

Super fast great tasting. You can add any spices you want to taste, also kitchen boquet or smoke or A-1 work real well to give it a darker flavor. Don't forget to cook it all together, just boil it then simmer to taste.

I made this BBq sauce yesterday and it turned out really good. It's a really sweet tasting recipe. I took another's advice and boiled the sauce on the stove. It came out really smooth and enhanced the flavor. Taste the best the next day after it's had time to sit. Thanks

This sauce was great! I followed another reviewers recommendation to increase the Worcestershire Sauce & added two cloves of minced garlic.  The flavor was great--I will definitely make it again.

This was a great last minute sauce I whipped up in a pinch.  I prefer it a little less sweet so next time I make it I might put in a little less brown sugar.  Thank you!  I have never made my own BBQ sauce before.

Excellent! I make as is sometimes (esp. for chicken) or sometimes I use the following variation:

Soy sauce instead of Worchestire (just because I don't like Worchestire), only 1 cup of sugar and substitute 1/2 the red wine vinegar with regular white vinegar. If I have time, I finely chop then saute onion, green pepper and garlic in butter, add the sauce, cook for a bit then put back in blender to puree the veggies. Also like to add liquid smoke or sometimes, a touch of horseradish for extra kick.

Thanks for an awesome recipe! I will continue to use it (both with and without my variation) for years to come!

Great all purpose BBQ sauce it! It was terrific on my pulled pork. I also used some splenda to cut down on calories and couldn't tell the difference. It was great! Next time I think I am going to try a little pineapple

Was looking for a recipe that called for ingredients I usually have on hand. Instead of using regular ketchup, I used Stonewall Kitchen spicy ketchup and it was good. Next time I will use regular ketchup so I can compare.

This sauce is fantastic!  It is very sweet and a little spicy, but not "hot" at all.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I think would like it a little thicker next time, but the flavor is amazing.

After realizing at the last minute that we were out of BBQ sauce, I used this recipe in for the grilled bacon-wrapped barbecued shrimp that we made tonight.  It was great!  We really enjoyed it, and I love having another recipe that I can use in the place of a store-bought product!  Unlike some of the other recipes, this one used ingredients that you're likely to have on hand.  After a quick mix and boil, we were ready to roll.  Thanks so much!

This really is a tasty barbecue sauce - one that I will use again.  Used it with my pulled pork recipe and it was great!  My husband commented also about how good it was.  I agree to cook it for alittle bit to help the flavors mix in really well.

Yum!!  This was the #2 favorite in our taste test of 6 BBQ sauce recipes today!  Very tasty and easy to make, although I didn't use the blender - just mixed in a bowl and cooked on high in the microwave for 2 minutes.  Will definitely make it again.  (Our #1 favorite was "Bob's BBQ Sauce" but this was a v-e-r-y close 2nd!)

This was just ok for me, but some in my family like the thicker base bbq sauces, so I tried this one. I did leave out the red wine vinegar, I've used it in other dishes and it can be overpowering and the amount for this recipe I felt, was way to much for me. My family thought this was good, but I'll stick to my vinegar base sauces for myself. Oh!!! I did add red pepper flakes and apple cider vinegar to spice it up some more, I can't seem to make a bbq sauce with out the flakes, I guess it's a Carolina thing.

This is probably the best BBQ sauce ever! I always have it on hand in my fridge.  I add a little liquid smoke for a little more flavor. Great on anything!!

This is awesome.  I have found lots of stuff to use it on since making it, including noodles.  :)  Being a sauce with quite a bit of sugar, wait until later in the cooking to use it if the meat needs to cook for a longer period of time.

WOW.. I LOVED THIS RECIPE! subbed out a few things.. I used powdered birch xylitol instead of the brown sugar to make this more sugar free (there was still sugar in the ketchup so not totally sugar free) and Grains of Paradise instead of the black pepper since I have a bk pepper allergy and took the advice of other reviewers and heated it up on the stove for like 10-15 mins. This was fantastic on my ribs! THANK YOU for this very simple BBQ sauce recipe!

My husband loved this and said make sure you save that recipe.  I needed BBQ sauce and we didn't have any on hand so I found this recipe and had most of what it called for.  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I substituted malt vinegar.  I also didn't have hot pepper sauce so I substituted a red salsa I had.  Very good taste with sweet and spicy.

This BBQ sauce is AWESOME!  I halved the recipe for Instant Pot ribs, as we ran out of Sweet Baby Ray's.  We LOVED this sauce!  Definitely will be making it again.  I added about a tablespoon of honey and boiled the mixture on the stove, whisking occasionally.  Refrigerates well too...The kids have been using the leftover sauce for french fries :)

Perfection. Super simple and delicious! I used molasses instead of brown sugar and added some dry herbs, which went over well.

This was perfect for ribs after I made a few tweaks. I cut the amounts of brown sugar, water, and red wine vinegar in half, and I added a teaspoon each of garlic powder and onion powder. I combined everything in a saucepan and brought the mixture to a boil and simmered it for about 5 minutes. Perfection!

I used this recipe to make a tangy barbecue sauce. I didn't use the full amount of brown sugar and added a dash of garlic powder. Made for the perfect amount of tangy and semi sweet.

Very easy to make. The taste was a bit too ketchupy for me. I increased the brown sugar by 1/4 c and added liquid smoke. This recipe must be simmered for at least 3 minutes. It will thicken the sauce and enhance flavor.

Strong vinegar taste. Added more ketchup to combat the vinegar. Next time would put less vinegar.

A good starter recipe. I made it according to instructions the first time, and it was nothing to really write home about. A little too sweet, and not a ton of flavor. Serviceable, but boring, even after some simmering.

Second time, I began by carmelising a medium onion, mixed the rest of the ingredients together, added a half teaspoon of chili powder and a dash of garlic, halved the sugar, and substituted the juice from a jar of pickled (mild) peppers for water. It went very well with pork.

Super Yummy!!! My son said I should never buy bbq sauce again lol! Hot sauce does add a little heat kick at the end, I might leave that out next time. Though overall wonderful.

This is a really great BBQ sauce to start as a base in making your own flavor. I was making ribs and forgot I didn't have sauce, so I decided to try this one. I didn't have brown sugar, so I used coconut sugar. Didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar. Didn't have paprika, so I used my siracha seasoning mix. I have to go grocery shopping for one, and for two, it turned out pretty yummy, thanks!

I made this using my own canned tomato sauce, a  little less sugar and some black strap molasses.  A bit of vinegar, soy sauce and worchestershire.  Blend in food processor.  Yummy

I cut the recipe in half and used wet instead of dry mustard and a fermented chili paste instead of the hot sauce. Substitutions were made to suit what I had on hand as I do not go to the store special. The chili paste made it a trifle warm so I liked it and hubby said it was okay. I will make again hopefully with the correct mustard and hot sauce.

I didn't have any red wine vinegar on hand, so I substituted white wine vinegar and used Heinz brand ketchup. Perhaps a few more drops of hot sauce, but we are Texans. Excellent recipe.

I heated it up before I put it on my oven baked baby back ribs. It was a hit! I wish I had doubled the baby back ribs, rub and bbq sauce for leftovers.

Instead of Ketchup I used tomato sauce. I left out the sugar and used a bit of salt. Then instead of paprika and mustard seed I used basil and oregano. I sauteed onion and garlic as well and added that. I left everything else out.

This made the perfect sauce and goes much better on pasta than on bbq meat. 

The point of this is: if you want to review something, review it. If you want to post your own recipe don't do it on someone's review.

P.S the recipe is amazing as is! I just did it. Have a great day.

Overly vinegary and acidic. I'm very unhappy after all the positive reviews, but I don't want my bbq tasting like vinegar. I want sweet, smoky notes and this didn't have any of those despite the promising reviews and ingredients. Simmering it on the stove brought it to a lovely bbq consistancy but unfortunately could not help the flavor very much. I am buying some store bought sauce tomorrow. I hate to waste food, but this is really bad.

Didn’t quite have enough store bought bbq sauce, so we made 1/4 of this recipe.  Boy it was lovely!  We talked about making a full batch once the rest runs out.  Also will try heating it as others mentioned.  I didn’t have hot sauce, so I put in a pinch of cayenne

Use 1/2 cup sugar. Add 1/4 cup pineapple juice. Add 1/4 cup honey. Add 1/2 cup vinegar. Only then will this recipe stand out. Otherwise you will have an ordinary BBQ sauce. Good but ordinary.

Updated review.  This sauce is better over time.  I might do slightly less sugar thr next time, and a bit heavier on the Worcestershire sauce.   It went really well with the ribs I made.

Really good sauce as it is and easy to modify if you like it more tart and a little more vinegar more sweet add a little more sugar or honey more heat up the hot sauce. The way the recipe is very balanced and goes with anything even good for dipping French fries in it. This is my new go to sauce

Turned out way too sweet for us. Added distilled vinegar and it balanced it out.

Halved the recipe and can tell I added a little to much hot sauce, or I'm just weaker to spice than I thought I was (which is most likely the case). Didn't find a need to blend it as my blender would not have done anything to the small particles from the spices left in. It's quite sweet, but that's what I like, so no problems there. Also should mention that the sauce is a bit thin, but you can thicken it up by heating it on the stove for a bit.

The sauce was fantastic. No changes made to the recipe. We used it on slow cooked pull pork. Loved the sweet flavor. Would definitely make this again.

A good base to start with, I cut the amount of ketchup to just a cup and added apple juice and it came out great. Perfect for pulled pork and ribs.

This recipe is awesome! I omitted the pepper sauce and added the 1/2 cup of Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp cayenne pepper and garlic powder. Also the added liquid made it a little too thin so I will add a bit of cornstarch nextime. Also I did boil it to me that’s very necessary. Our family loves spicy but it only needed 1/2 of cayenne pepper. We are sweet baby rays fans but this is a good replacement.

WAAAY too sweet. Sugar from the ketchup just is too much. I added a 800ml can of diced tomatoes with also a sautéed onion and 5 cloves of garlic. Much better imo

This is a great recipe.  I agree with the other reviewers to boil the ingredients.  Simmer on low heat for 5 to 10 minutes and let sit to thicken.  I didn’t have red wine vinegar, but I did have red wine vinegerette.  It worked very well.  I also added cayenne pepper along with the hot pepper sauce to “amp” up the heat.  Will keep this recipe in the archives.

My sauce turned out beautifully.  The pork just fell off the bone.  My husband and daughter really liked it.  The change I made, no vinegar of any kind. I didn't have apple juice so I used beef broth. I will use this to make my bbq.

I've made this a couple of times.  I half it and then only use about 1/2 cup brown sugar to 3/4 cups ketchup.  It's still plenty sweet for my family.  My son asked me to make this version EVERY time.

Way too sweet as listed.  I almost couldn’t make it palatable.  I recommend using 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 cup apple cider vinegar, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp chipotle pepper, 1 tbsp cumin, and several dashes of your favorite hot sauce.  I realize this makes the end result very different, but it’s cloyingly sweet otherwise.

Excellent sauce! I did as others recommended and heated it to a boil - I was a bit lazy so I just combined all the ingredients in the pan and didn’t use my blender. I was out of dry mustard so I subbed regular with no problem. Definitely a keeper!!

I made a half batch & added 1/2 tsp liquid smoke. I used the 1/2 dry mustard & 1/2 spicy brown, added a small amount of chili powder & fresh & garlic powder.  Put everything in a saucepan & boiled for about 5 minutes. It was perfect on shredded chicken in the slow cooker.

I made this and the family loved it. We love BBQ, and we travel all over for it as well. I grilled some chicken and used this sauce for the family. They devoured it and wanted it again the next day.  Now I have it in jars ready to go on a moments notice.

I agree with a previous poster that this is way too acidic -- my taste testers pointed that out! I added more ketchup, water and brown sugar (actually used Brown Sugar Splenda). I also added a little liquid smoke, some garlic , and cooked on the stove for a few minutes. With these changes, it's a 4+.

Put this together in a matter of minutes. I was surprised at seeing Red Wine Vinegar in the recipe but it works so well. I get just a taste of it and it’s great. All Recipes you are my go to for any recipe I’m looking for and you never fail me!!!

I followed the recipe but cut it in half, but it was overly sweet and when cooked as braise with country ribs did not adhere to the ribs as one might have expected. I would probably try this again, but cut down on the brown sugar significantly.

Perfect. My mother used to make this recipe for years. She made it for beef BBQ.  I watched her make it. Unfortunately, after she passed away I realized nothing was ever written down. I always mixed ketchup and brown sugar, added some Worcestershire sauce but never knew the other ingredients. It was wonderful. I didn’t add the mustard because we loved the sweetness either the tang of mustard. Thank you for this recipe.

This sauce is uber sweet! I only used half the brown sugar but had to double the Worcestershire and hot sauce plus add stone ground mustard. No need for the blender, cooking stove top made it easy. I do love that you can make it with everything you already have in your pantry.

We don’t keep bbq sauce at home because it’s hardly ever used. This recipe was super simple to make and tasted great! I don’t keep brown sugar on hand either, so I just used regular sugar and molasses. Put all ingredients in a small pot and heated it up for about 10 minutes.

Very tasty.  Made  it quickly when  I couldn’t find the bottled stuff I’d bought.  I cooked it on the stove rather than making it in the blender.  Will be making it again.

This bbq sauce was delicious with my hubby's smoked brisket but I'm sure it would be great with any meat.
I did add 1/4 cup more brown sugar and a few additional dashes of hot sauce.

Very good...our house brand of bbq for my pork shoulder and pulled pork sandwiches!  

Used smoked paprika and the heat was great with just enough vinegar / mustard.  

A great in-between on sauces!

Made this for some pork roast that I cooked in my crock pot. I shredded the pork and mixed some of this barbecue sauce into it and a BIG WOW!! The sauce has such a wonderful flavor. This is my sauce to go to when doing any barbecue from now on. I did boil it just for a few minutes but other then that I didn't change a thing. Thx for sharing your recipe!!

Great recipe! I didn’t want so much sauce left back so I literally did half of everything and added about a teaspoon of honey to it. I also prepared it on the stove like some of the other users recommended. My family loved it! I will not buy bottled barbecue sauce again!

I made a half recipe for a sauce in a pinch. This is very ketchuppy. Sweet and ketchuppy. It tastes like something thrown together in a hurry.  It tastes cheap. I'm sorry I served this with the pulled pork that had cooked for hours. I'm embarrassed. 
I can see it being popular for quickness and ease of preparation. Many might even like it.
This sauce needs to simmer a bit, and would probably be better the next day. It will not get the opportunity here.
I will never put off a sauce again.

Just made this for Father’s Day and it got raves reviews from everyone. I brought it to a boil and let it cook for a few minutes (that’s all the time I had to spare) and poured it over pulled pork. Fast, easy, and tasty!

I think I sent a review before but I must review this again. This is the BEST bbq sauce I’ve made or had since my grandmother’s own recipe.  Have gotten so many compliments it’s not even funny. My spin on this recipe is that I combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan, not a blender and cook it slowly. The caramelization of the sugars adds depth to the sauce. I also add tomato paste to give it zing.

This is an excellent sauce as is. Sweet, tangy, a bit of heat, and adjustable like many of the reviews have tasted. 
Note - the flavor doesn't truly shine until grilled. The taste of the uncooked sauce is quite different. We will use this sauce a lot.

Was a great universal BBQ sauce, however, the next time I make it I will use a little less ketchup - a bit too tomato-ey for my taste.

Made tbis for pulled pork sandwiches and it was outstanding.  Forgot the bbq sauce on my store trip and needed something fast. This was it!  I warmed the sauce inthe skillet after blending then added the pork. Absolutely delicious.

Good sweet sauce, easy to change up by using different vinegars, cooking smoothed the sauce and blends the flavors.

I loved it, my kid loved it. Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy was my go to, but I think I'll use this from now on. Made it just as the recipe says. It is sweet, but we like it that way.  Not much heat, so to be more comparable to SBR Sweet and Spicy, I'll add cayenne pepper to my part of the sauce. I think you can change up this basic recipe to your pleasing. So glad I tried it! Thanks JR!

Very good for a scratch BBQ sauce. A little too sweet for me. Need more hot sauce. I didn't have mustard seed so I used yellow mustard. Didn't seem to affect the taste. All in all a very good standby.

Way to sweet and the vinegar was over powering.  
I cut the vinegar in half and the sugar.  Bottled mustard works fine. Cooking it ten minutes on low heat made a big improvement.  These adjustments created a superior sauce.

Wanted to make a bbq ham pizza but I was out of bbq sauce so decided to give this one try. This is delicious. Like others have said boil it on the stove for about 3-5 minutes to thicken it up a bit. This will be my go to for bbq sauce.

This is a very good recipe! I used it with some pulled pork. We prefer sauces that are less sweet, so I started with 1/3 the amount of brown sugar and added a generous tablespoon of molasses (an ingredient my grandfather used in his sauce) I continued to add brown sugar and ended u using a little less than half the amount in the recipe. My husband loved it. Thanks for sharing!

I made this, but cut back on the brown sugar and ketchup a bit. I added a cup of tomato sauce, and used soy sauce instead of the Worcestershire. Came out delicious.

Not  popular in my house. Far too tart and spicy for us and we are huge buffalo sauce fans, so the spice isn't what killed this for us.

Great sauce!  I add 1tsp of jalapeño powder and substitute 1tsp of bourbon (for 1tsp of water) when adding the 1/4 cup of water.  I add all ingredients to a large glass measuring cup and use a whisk to beat the mixture.  Then I microwave the mixture for 2 minutes.  Whisk when done.  A stovetop works well too, but find that microwaving works just fine.

I make this in a sauce pan by mixing all of the ingredients and then bringing it to a boil.  This releases all of the spices.  I refrigerate( covered) what I have not used.  Keeps for a very long time.  I have doubles the recipe,too.  Very popular at church functions.

I didn't have red wine vinegar on hand so I used half red wine and half apple cider vinegar. I also used 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper along with the listed hot sauce.  It has a sweet taste on the tongue at first followed swiftly by the heat.  Not too much, just enough kick to satisfy my and my husband's taste buds.  Will use this recipe a lot.

Way too much sweetness and vinegar. I made this recipe because I was out of BBQ sauce for a slow cooker chicken dish I was making. I richened up the flavor by adding about 1&1/2 tsp of cumin, a little siracha (didn’t have hot sauce on hand) and a dash more worstershire sauce.

A great recipe in both its simplicity and flavour.
At first blush, I thought that 1 1/2 cups brown sugar would be too sweet for my tastes.  I wanted to try it pretty much as written and next time I'll cut it to 1 cup.  Another thought would be to use tomato sauce instead of the ketchup.
The minor changes  I made include use smoked paprika to give it a smokey taste.  I upped the Worcestershire sauce to almost a 1/4 cup and used 1 tsp chipotle flakes instead of the hot sauce and 2 cloves minced garlic.  I heated it to a slow rolling boil then let cool.  
Other thoughts would be to chop up 1/2 an onion and use an immersion blender prior to boiling.   I have to believe the longer it sits, the more complex the flavours become.
Great foundation will definitely use again.

Will make again and again. prefer more Worcestershire than recipe calls for--I use about 1/3 cup. Don't like too much heat so I leave out pepper sauce. Better than store-bought IMO.

This was a good recipe.  I took advice from other reviewers and cooked it.  I also doubled the black pepper and added diced onions.  It turned out very good.  It seems to taste better if you make it a several hours before you use it.

The red wine vinegar will cook off if you taste it before you cook it , it will give you a sharp taste on med heat for 15-20 stir.

Instead of water I used apple pie Mead(honey wine) added 1/4 Frank's sweet chili sauce and srihacha instead of hot sauce.  It turned out AMAZING! Nice rich sauce with a perfect combination of sweet and mild head and ridiculously flavorful

Excellent homemade BBQ sauce. I substituted tajin seasoning for the paprika and added a tablespoon of whiskey, 1/2 pack of French onion soup mix, teaspoon of cornstarch then brought to a slow boil on stove. My family absolutely raved about it and asked for some to take home. Will definitely make this again.

I made it as written, omitting a small amount of brown sugar as I like a tangy BBQ more than a sweet one. I also added a shake or so of hot Mexican chili powder. Then I adjusted to taste. Delicious on grilled chicken.

A good, simple BBQ sauce. I halved the recipe and it was still enough for 4 chicken breasts (to marinate and also enough for dipping). I followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty sweet (I might go a little lighter on the sugar next time), plus I added some garlic and onion powder. It was not spicy as all (add more Tabasco if you want yours spicy). I also brought to a simmer on the stove and boiled for about a minute, as others suggested. Overall, it's a keeper!

I just used my immersion blender and let it simmer for about 30 minutes.  I made substitutions based on what I had on hand.  It was a tad sweet, but very good!  Oh an I omitted the water.

I didn't see dried mustard in our spice drawer (found it later though!), so I squirted a bunch of regular mustard in and that worked great. I also boiled it like a reviewer suggests. Next time I plan to cut the vinegar in half to 1/4 cup and to boil a little longer to see if I can get it to thicken up a little more. All in all, though, it is SUPER easy and quick to make. I had it done faster than running to the store (I ran out of BBQ sauce while making ribs). I don't know that I'll ever need to buy BBQ sauce again. ;-)

I made the sauce exactly to the recipe (and simmered it for about 10 minutes after blending). It's got a good underlying flavor, but next time I'll probably halve the vinegar and go with about 1 cup of brown sugar. It was VERY sweet and vinegary, almost overpoweringly so, but I think with these minor adjustments it's a great recipe.

Tastes wonderful! This was simple to make and tasted better than my usual store bought sauce. I whisked everything instead of using a blender - worked just fine.
The only substitution was apple cider vinegar because I don't have red wine vinegar. I also followed the advice of others and let it come to a boil while whisking, then simmered it gently for a few minutes and allowed it to cool.
My next batch I'm going to experiment and add some onion and garlic powders. Maybe!

This was delicious! But I only gave it 4 stars because, as other reviews say, it needs to be boiled for best results.  Also, there is no need to put it in a blender if you whisk it well. Also, I used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar.

I didn't have red wine vinegar,  so I used red wine. I also didn't use the mustard, as we don't like it.  It was amazing!  I have never made bbq sauce before and this was quick and simple. I am going to make more to store in the refrigerator.  2 Thumbs up!

Very tasty for how simple it was to make! I recommend boiling it a bit before using. It gives a greater depth to the flavor.

Was using a bottled product and didn't have enough. Made this recipe. It was easy, didn't require any odd ingredients, and tasted good. A little thin, but worked just fine. I added extra heat with a pinch of red pepper flakes.

Tasty, tangy, quick and easy BBQ recipe! Put it all in a blender and you're done. I used a 1/4 less brown sugar than the recipe calls for and threw some liquid smoke in too.

I made 1/3 of the batch. It had good reviews, but I'm not sure why. Kind of blah. Tastes like doctored catsup, not BBQ sauce. I wanted it for pulled pork, but instead, so as not to waste it, I put it on the 3 meat loaves I was making.

My husband liked this more than I did.  Next time, I will cut back on the vinegar (and probably use apple cider rather than red wine) and halve the amount of mustard.

Very good sauce and super tasty... I did put mine in a saucepan and boiled for just a few minutes. I added the vinegar to taste. It was a little too sweet for me but everyone else loved it! Next time I'll use a tad less sugar.

I made this one night after realizing I was out of barbecue sauce. Only things I did different was not use a blender because mine was broken. The family loved it and asked that I not change a thing!!! I would have liked to put some liquid smoke in (love smoky flavor personally) but am afraid of a family uprising now if I do. .....lol. Thanks for the recipe!! :)

Followed the recipe exactly.  I really liked it, but all the men at the table thought it had too much vinegar.  Based on that, I will probably cut back slightly on that.

Very awesome sauce for pulled pork on the Primo Ceramic grill. Perfect blend of sweet, sour and sweet. The entire family loved it. A big hit! For the person who didn't like it, be sure to bring the combined ingredients to a slow boil and simmer for 10 minutes to burn off the vinegar.

I made a half batch of this as I didn't need so much. It did the trick but was VERY vinegary. I used red wine vinegar as stated but next time would probably use apple cider vinegar and cut in in half one more time. It was very pungent and was overkill. I also used Lawry's seasoned pepper (my favorite spice) instead of Tabasco. This gave it a little spicy kick without the zing (and more vinegar) flavor of hot sauce. 
I'll definitely use this recipe again as a very fast and simple jumping off point and will tweak it as I go.  :)

Delicious!

I followed the advice of cooking the sauce. As it was my first try doing my own sauce like this I'm thrilled that it was so easy, so delicious and I sure do want to try doing more home cooked sauces and others.

An excellent quick and easy BBQ sauce. Uses common ingredients usually on hand. I added a little bourbon for a little "kick".

I made this, but the only thing I changed was cooking it, and adding a little more brown sugar, because I like my barbecue sauce on the sweet side a bit. It was so easy to make and so tasty!

Family loved it, will make again for them. Smelled and looked very good, wish I could of tried it, BBQ anything makes me sick as a dog. I added sweet onion to it and cut back on sugar. Very good!

Absolutely delicious and easy!  I did add a bit of liquid smoke , and didn't have red wine vinegar so I used a bit of soy sauce and balsamic vinegar.   Poured it over pulled pork for sandwiches .  Yummy!

This is one of the best bbq sauces I have ever made.  My sons will not let me make anything else.  I did not use as much brown sugar as it called for and did add the worcestershire.  I think next time I will cook it a little to reduce and make a slightly thicker sauce.  Even without that step though, this is by far the best!!!

I substituted regular mustard for dry and halved the recipe.  It worked out great!  I loved the tip about storing the sauce in a ketchup bottle.

Very good barbecue sauce.  I did try it per this recipe prior to altering.  I cut the liquids and added moonshine to supplement the missing liquids.  What this did, was add slight heat to the end.  My Step-mom thought this was the best sauce she ever tasted.  This sauce seems to go better with beef and pork than chicken.  Try apple cider vinegar instead of the red wine for chicken recipes

Great base sauce.  Easy to adjust to personal tastes.  I love it a little spicier so I added more dry mustard, black pepper and Louisiana Hot Sauce.

Omitted the vinegar because I didn't have any on hand and increased the Worcestershire sauce to 1/4 cup. I did heat it on the stove as others suggested. Easy recipe. My family loved the taste. This is a keeper!

After reading several positive/helpful reviews,  I decided to reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup,  vinegar to 1/4 cup , add 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. onion powder and cooked the sauce as suggested.  This is now perfect for my family's  palate.   I will now make this BBQ sauce and spread the good taste to all our friends.  Thank you for a great sauce...

All the ingredients were used with the recipe tweaked as follows: Instead of water, I used beer. I used the thick Worcestershire sauce. I added 1 diced sweet onion. 2 fresh jalapeño peppers with 4 slits (removed after cooking the sauce).  3 ounces each of Peri Peri garlic hot sauce and regular hot sauce. The salt and pepper were coarsely ground. Only 3/4 cup ketchup and 1 cup red wine vinegar.  Cooked covered on lowest setting of gas heat for 4 hours to thicken, stirring occasionally.  I served with barbecued ribs yesterday (4th of  July) and everyone wanted the name of the  BBQ sauce! I gave them this Web page and told them to tweak it to their own taste...Next time I will use fresh habenaro peppers...I love a very hot, slow afterburn...

i decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup because we dont care for really sweet sauces on our meats. The amount of vinegar also needs to reduced by half. This needs to simmer for ten minutes so the flavors  blend and bloom.After the adjustments it was actually very good..

Like others, I brought it to a boil and let it simmer for 5-10 minutes. It was a little too sweet for my taste, so next time I'll just use 1 cup of brown sugar. Otherwise, great recipe as is, but you can make it your own!

It was very good, but very sweet. Next time I will reduce the sugar. I also added cayenne pepper to give it a subtle spiciness. I also boiled and then simmered it for 15 min. before cooling.

I followed as written.  I did not boil the recipe.  Just whipped it up in my Blendtec blender.  Very easy to make with easy to find ingredients.  None of the chemicals and preservatives that are found in bottled sauces.  That is what lead me to try homemade and I will never go back to bottled sauce again.
 Try this in the Zesty slow cooker shredded chicken sandwich recipe on this site.

I boiled the baby backed pork ribs on stove. Made sauce using smoked paprika.  Poured sauce over ribs and placed in a pre-heated oven at 300 degrees baking  nice and slow. Turned occasionally.

This is a great recipe.  We like sweet sauce, so I added another half cup of brown sugar and left out the pepper sauce.   Also, I heated oil and butter and sauteed minced onion and garlic to give it another depth of flavor and cooked the sauce on the stove.  Also I used apple cider vinegar because I did not have red wine vinegar.  I am getting requests from my family to have this sauce from now on.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Four stars because this is an excellent Carolina-style sauce as written, with a nice balance of flavors.  However, it is *very* sweet.  I tinkered to suit our tastes and ended up with a five-star sauce, but to list all my (significant) changes and then rate the original recipe five stars wouldn't be fair.

This is now our go-to BBq sauce.    It is the best recipe i have found with out molasses. 
I used it on Prize Winning Baby Back Ribs from this site and the combination was fabulous!   I made the recipe as is and it made enough to bottle for future BBq's. 

As per other reviews i did cook the sauce.  The spices melded and the flavor popped.

I had unexpected guests for dinner.  I had chicken to grill but no bbq sauce.  This recipe had all the ingredients I had on hand.  It took ten minutes  and tastes like sweet baby rays .  The only change I made was that I did not use a blender ---- I don't have one, and I boiled it to make it smooth and MAN ALIVE  is it good!!!!  Never buying bbq sauce again.

Made as written first time....Very good.
Second time I used cider vinegar instead. No water.
I also added 1 tablespoon  onion powder and
1 tsp garlic powder. I liked it better. Had more 
flavor undertones. I always cook my sauces before
so I can taste and adjust if needed. Cooking really 
changes the flavor. Specially since vinegar tends to 
cook out or change when cooked.

I changed this up a bit which is easy to do with these ingredients that I already had on hand.  I used 1 C of sugar because the catsup is already sweet.  I omitted the salt because many of the other products already have salt and I do not like a lot of salt.  You can always start with less vinegar and some of the other ingredients and add more of them until you tweak it to your taste. At least it is a fairly simple recipe.

Wonderful flavor as is; however, because I didn't have enough red wine vinegar I used cider vinegar and reduced it only by 2 Tbsp. And just for the sake of making it my own, I added a 1/2 cup of honey:

I used this recipe as a base for shredded BBQ chicken, but it was too tangy, so I added a can of tomato sauce. Very good. :)

What I love is how simple this is. I usually do a dry rub but decided to give this a try.  I actually had all of the ingredients at home. I might try simmering next time, but as is, my guests all raved. Thank you.

Really excellent BBQ sauce.  Made with maple sugar instead of sugar, and added about a tbsp. of smoke sauce.  Otherwise, made as written.  Hubby and I both enjoyed on baby back ribs.

I halved the recipe for ribs on the BBQ. I omitted the water as I wanted the have a thicker sauce to coat the ribs, I used French's Garlic Ketchup and added onion powder, garlic powder and cayenne pepper to the spices listed, omitted the salt as I am on a low sodium diet and ketchup has a high amount of sodium. I brought the sauce to a boil then simmered for about 15 minutes, still a little thin for my liking, added tomato paste to thicken a bit. Good sauce with some tweaking made with pantry ingredients.

5 stars for the sauce as written. It was excellent, then I boiled it based on others reviewers recommendations and it made it very thin. Sure it's better after it's cooked, but it's going to be cooked on whatever meat you put it on. Boiling it made it too thin and it wouldn't stick to my shrimp kabobs.

Gorgeous sauce. Reduce it a little to thicken it and leave it in the fridge for a couple of weeks. The flavours improve and develop over time.

Made a few changes,  made it a little more diabetic friendly.  Turned out really Good. 
Used spenda brown sugar and only used 1 cup. No sugar added ketchup,  Half the salt,  added 1tsp of garlic ( minced ) 2 tlbs of unsweetened apple sause .  And dropped the red white vinigar replaced with  1/3 c of a savory  Spicy Chipotle vinigar.  Now my neighbors are asking for more!

Since the first time I made this my family refuses to have any other BBQ sauce. I add a little honey to it. I've even made it using  liquid mustard. I have also given small jars away for Christmas gifts.  A bit hit around here. Thanks for sharing. :)

Great recipe! I substituted rice wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar since I didn't have any, and added a few more spices to make it a little more spicy. Added a few splashes of liquid smoke and Franks Red Hot to kick it up a notch.

tasted great! Only use about two thirds cup of sugar, about half a cup of beer, and about half the bacon called for. didn't have ketchup,so I had to make my own from tomato paste, water onion powder ,and a little apple cider vinegar. didn't have dried mustard so I used two tablespoons of prepared Dijon mustard. even after all my crazy substitutions, this came out tasting great! I did mix it in a pan and heat it on the stove top turned out great, good stuff!

"Babe, how hard would it be for you to make that delicious barbecue sauce you made the other day?" -my husband. I reduce brown sugar by measuring it loosely rather than packed, omit hot pepper sauce, and add 1 tsp liquid smoke. Delicious barbecue sauce indeed.

We cut the recipe by one third & used apple cider vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar. We left out the hot sauce & added 2 TBSP of Hersey Chocolate syrup.   It was fabulous!  We will certainly make this again.

Really good as is but I took the advice to put it on the stovetop, and also didn't have paprika handy.

This is fantastic. I smoked a large pork loin and shredded the left overs so we had pork sandwiches the next day, I made a lot of this AMAZING sauce and heated the pork in it.... The only thing different that I did was added 1.5 tablespoons of mustard... I decided to jar this sauce so I always have some on hand... My kids love to dip steak fries in it....... Yummy!*****

This recipe is awesome! I use this BBQ sauce on almost everything, and it tastes good! I don't think I'll be buying BBQ sauce anytime soon as long as I have this recipe. I didn't put in mustard although, I'm sure it would taste fine with it but I didn't think it would need it, which it doesn't because it's still REALLY good without it. Overall I recommend this BBQ sauce to anyone, it's sweet, spicy, and goes with anything!

My husband and I argue all the time over which bbq sauce to buy because we have different taste. This recipe nailed it for both of us and was so fast and easy. Whipped it up while the chicken was on the grill and it was delicious. Finally found the one and it was in my kitchen the whole time, go figure.

This is an excellent, nicely balanced BBQ sauce. I followed the directions exactly, except, as suggested by others, cooked the sauce for a minute or two. It was so easy and is so good, I doubt I'll ever buy any ready made sauce from the store again.

A 5-star basic BBQ sauce; I have used it for decades. The ratio of 1 part vinegar to 3 parts ketchup is all I consider absolute. Everything else is a matter of taste ... I just use whatever appeals at the moment. I've never used water before, but it makes sense to adjust the consistency. I do simmer mine for a minute or two, especially when I've put Garlic in it. There are lots of people who cannot stand Colgin's or Wright's Liquid Smoke, so I now use smoked paprika (as another reviewer suggested). I seldom use that much sugar. (Remember: white sugar is way sweeter than brown.)

Used apple cider vinegar, omit the water, trim the sugar for a little less sweet, cook it a bit in saucepan for a bit more smoothness, otherwise all the spices worked very well for a very good flavour, goes well with pork!

My husband saw this recipe before I did and asked if we could try it. I was a little skeptical because I have a favorite store bought sauce, but I said, Yes.  Whipped it up this afternoon, let it sit in the blender until we were ready to cook. I tasted it right from the blender and was not impressed...Way to much pepper for me. But, I carried on. We used it on wings. OMG....My husband said the vinegar fumes when it hit the heat made his eyes water :)  When all was said and done, it is definitely a do again. The pepper and the vinegar cooked off to be just right.  I made two very slight changes.. Because we are not big on pepper heat, I left our the hot sauce and because we love the sweet side, I added in about a tablespoon of maple syrup (the real stuff).... This is a winner.

I love this sauce! I did add 1/4 cup of dales marinade and 1tbsp of liquid smoke and only used 1 cup of brown sugar and it was perfect! I will use this again and again. My new go to bbq sauce. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I did add to it.

I will never buy BBQ sauce from the store again. We made it as directed the first time and it was a little too sweet (I prefer my BBQ tangy) but was still really good. The second batch I made a few tweaks (less sugar, more vinegar) and one or two other small things and it was completely gone! My husband LOVED this sauce!

Great go to! Had no BBQ sauce and made pulled pork!  Was excellent!  I will say, if you are serving this to kids  do not use the hot sauce.  I barely used a dash and it was way too spicy to them.  Perfect for me.

A lot of feedback on this recipe, with some very good ideals. With ours we cut back the Black Pepper to a 1/2 teaspoon due to various brands that are course ground to very fine. This seems to work the best, unless you like it hot. The Hot Sauce was added in and wasn't over powering, but again it is according to ones taste. Replacing the Water with Liquid Smoke gives it that nice Hickory flavor. Overall it is a good & quick to make sauce.

The best BBQ sauce, wonderful as is, but if you make changes it won't change the basic recipe too much.  But I say start with the recipe and see if you like it (which you should because it is fantastic!).

Delicious!  And fun to make!  (I prepared exactly according to the recipe).

It was a tad sweet for our taste so next time I will cut back on the sugar.  And will try simmering to really marry the flavors.

Infinitely better than bottled sauce.

My family's go-to BBQ sauce! I took a couple of previous reviewers' suggestions and added a teaspoon of liquid smoke per 12 servings, and also bring it to a boil when I use it as a dipping sauce (gives it an even deeper color and thickens it a bit more). Other than that, I follow the recipe to a T. Wonderful!

To me this had a super strong vinegar taste.  I might try it again with a little less vinegar next time.  The red wine vinegar I used was kinda old, so I wonder if that made any difference.

Great recipe but as all others suggested...I simmered it on the stove for a while. Also I cut the brown sugar to only half a cup so it wouldn't be too sweet. Came out just sweet and tangy enough too! For a bit of extra kick, I added a bit more hot pepper sauce too. Yum!

I went with this recipe but didn't use the red wine vinegar just a tbsp of regular vinegar and no hot pepper sauce because I don't like it spicy . The whole family liked it!

Extremely tasty and easy to make. We keep a bottle of this stuff in our fridge all the time. Goes great on pork, beef, or chicken. (I can add 3/4 Splenda to cut down on the real surgar.)

This sauce is great!!! I ran out of sauce and was too lazy to go to the store. I read a few recipes and there were 30 ingredients in them... no thanks. This is delicious and easy. Thank you for posting this ! :)

Great recipe! I don't like heat so I leave out the hot sauce. My only suggestion is wait until last to add the water, you may not want it at all. I like a thicker sauce so I never add any water. Also, if you are heating it up or BBQing with it, I don't think there is any need for blending. I just throw all the ingredients in a bowl and mix. So easy and delish. Try smoked paprika instead of reg ;)

Used ketchup without high fructose corn syrup and Demerara. Also, cut the red wine vinegar to 1/4 cup. Poured it over lg meatballs and everyone liked it!

Loved this sauce! We don't keep red wine vinegar in the pantry so I used white vinegar instead. Still great! Lots of flavor and not too sweet, perfect amount if kick for us.

This is a good recipe.  I defiantly suggest bringing it to a simmer, heating it up brought out the flavors more.  I also added a tablespoon of molasses.  I also added mor ketchup to thicken it up.  But overall a very good BBQ sauce.

Good recipe, but WAY too much vinegar for our taste. I had only put in 1 cup of the brown sugar, and ended up adding the other 1/2 C plus honey, and it was still too tangy. Also added a tablespoon of butter to give it a silkier texture.

This recipe was too sweet for me.  I did lighten up on the brown sugar as was.  I used it to slow cook cocktail franks and it did turn out good, but sweet.
