While my first batch out tasted good, they were soggy and not crisp like they  should have been. I tried it again but this time after soaking the potatoes for 30 minutes I drained off the water and soaked them again. I also cut them a little different  the 2nd time so they were thinner and flatter but I'm not sure if that had anything  to do with the better results or not. I fell in love with truffle fries on my visit to NYC a few years ago and these were spot on to the ones I had there.
