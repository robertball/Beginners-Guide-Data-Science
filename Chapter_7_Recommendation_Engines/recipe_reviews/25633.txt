While I'm not a fan of "not cheesecake" this worked for my guests. As for the design...split your batter before adding your flavor so you end up with vanilla and ...  Pour one cup into the pan, follow it with opposite color and repeat till you are out of batter. I crumbed the sides-it really polishes it off.

As a cheese fiend and dairy lover, I don't normally make vegan desserts unless it's a special request. This one is so beautiful, it's hard for anyone to resist. Nice job. (I did use butter instead of margarine in the crust, and added cocoa powder, a pinch of salt and about a tablespoon of confectioners'sugar when grinding the almonds.) I used almond milk instead of soy and almond oil instead of sunflower seed. Served it with warm chocolate ganache.

This is a flawless recipe.  I have been baking for years, but this was my first vegan dessert.  The batter is creamy and easy to work with, and the proportions of ingredients are right on.  For those of you who are interested in creating the rings, try this:  pour 1/3 of the white batter into the pan and gently tilt pan to allow batter to cover the bottom.  Pour 1/3 chocolate batter just into the CENTER of the white batter and allow that circle of batter to spread and widen a bit.  Then pour another 1/3 white batter into the CENTER of the chocolate circle, and allow that to spread a bit.  Repeat with remaining batter.  I hope that helps!

The chocolate part of the cheesecake is very good, but the vanilla part has a noticeable tofu taste.  Unless you really like the taste of tofu for dessert, I would recommend increasing the cocoa and making the cheesecake all chocolate.  Also, I did not know what demanara sugar was, simply used granulated sugar (1 cup instead of 1 1/2).  I think a regular graham cracker crust would be just as good as the almond/whole wheat one.  Very good recipe for not using dairy products, though!

This is good, but you could definitely taste the tofu in the recipe as posted. I tried it again, substituting  creme de menthe for the rum, and it was much yummier.

This cheese cake definitely had a tofu aftertaste. The first bite did put me off, but after a couple more nibbles, I started to get used to it. It was extremely dense and moist. I opted to use a cookie dough crust instead of the suggested crust. I started off mixing all of the ingredients in my Kitchen Aid but the mixture was too lumpy so I used my hand blended and pureed the whole mixture. I used regular brown sugar. I used the reviewer "foodaholic"'s suggestion of how to make the chocolate and vanilla swirls - I kept half the batter white and added chocolate to the other half. I poured a cup of white batter into the center of the pan and then a cup of chocolate batter right in the center of the white batter. I repeated this, making sure not to wiggle or jiggle the pan or the colors would blend. I baked the cheesecake for the suggested time. I was nervous when I took it out after 75 minutes - as the cake was very jiggly in the middle, but I refrigerated it over night and the cake set beautifully! I pressed mini chocolate chips into the sides of the cheese cake.

This is great cake. I made it just as the recipie said and I didn't get any fancy swirling patterns, but I wasn't hoping for any anyway.

I used extra firm tofu which made for a really thick pie, but I'll use firm next time for more creaminess. I used coconut oil, soy milk, and broke up the sugar between sugar, agave, and stevia. I used rum extract instead of rum. I used 1/2 cup of ww flour for the crust instead of a full cup. That was much more pleasant. I will add some salt to the filling next time as it tasted flat. All in all, with a little tweaking, this is a great recipe!

This turned out better than I expected! I did not find it too tofu-tasting at all and it was nice and dense. I didnt really taste the rum either...I topped it with bananas and that added nice flavor. I think if I make it again I might mash some banana and put it in the batter itself.

The flavor is quite nice. The texture all wrong. The filling did not set at all after following the recipe to a tee and 80 mins of cooking and a further 2 hours of refrigeration. I could not sense the tofu after taste other users mentioned.
