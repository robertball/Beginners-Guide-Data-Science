In my family we have this type of pastry as well,I thought I would try this one for a change. It was easy to put together even though I kneaded the dough by hand , I added annisette flavour instead of rum and only used 1tsp.Make sure that the oil is hot enough for frying and that they are all ready to go into the pan in small bathches, it goes quite quickly once you start frying them. The only thing I found different from our family recipe was these turned out softer like a funnel cake and not crisp like what I am used to.

This is a decent recipe. At my house, there were some additions to the recipe that strengthen the success of this fabulous cookie. A teaspoon of vanilla or orange extract will liven it up. Besdies the already noted input that the oil needs to be HOT, as hot as you can go without burning the oil, the cookies themselves should be thin. The thinnner you can get them, the better they will fry and the crisper, and less oily they will appear. While shopping at a local Italian market in San Diego, I came across a cute little cookie company, Cookies con Amore, that actually makes these in a variety of flavors. They did not have the honey, but they were REALLY close to what my Nonna used to make!

These are very close to the recipe my aunts have used to make Crostoli. I used my pasta maker to role out the dough up until level 6, I found 7 to be too thin for this dough. I heat the oil to 345 and only cook a max of three at a time, so the oil temp doesn't drop too much per batch. I give the oil a break every 20 minutes or so. I used veg oil and found it worked better than canola. I use a pizza cutter to cut the strips out. I don't make the slit and pull the pasta through, I'm just lazy and my family never made them this way, maybe we're all lazy :) The kids inhale them like air. I love watching people at work trying to eat one and not get the icing sugar powder on their nice black clothes...hahahahah! This recipe can make 4 large full trays. You can half it and still have a lot.
