I've been doing something very similar to these for several years now.  If you like your potatoes crispy, after chopping them, dry them thoroughly on paper towel before adding the oil.  I put the potatoes in a gallon ziploc bag, then add about 1.5 T of extra virgin olive oil.  Generally speaking, the less oil you can use, the better the result.  after tossing the potatoes in the bag with the oil to coat, add the herbs.  I use dried Herbs de Provence, but almost any herb or blend will work, and kosher salt.  Those on reduced sodium diets can omit the salt and add a bit more herbs.  Toss to coat again.  I also I use a dark cookie sheet lined with Aluminum foil.  When opening the bag, dump the potatoes on the foil lined sheet, but DON'T dump the excess oil in the bag onto the sheet.  The dark sheet absorbs heat and transfers it to the aluminum foil, and the aluminum foil itself provides easy cleanup.  Bake for 20 minutes initially on 450° on the middle rack Then take the pan out of the oven, and gently turn the potatoes.  This will keep them from sticking to the  foil later.  Reduce the heat to 400° and   cook for another 15 minutes.  A convection oven will yield a bit crispier results, but with only a small reduction in cooking time.  Don't open the oven except to turn the potatoes.

This recipe is a good place to start from. However, after some trial and error, I would suggest some tweaks.  I added garlic powder, italian seasoning and a little parmesan cheese to the mix.  I also used olive oil (they needed more then 2 T). I doubled the cooking time(I like mine crispy on the outside) and gave them a stir about half way through cooking.  I had fresh rosemary on hand so I used that instead of dried.  Also, I've found I have better luck with keeping them from sticking and getting them crispy if I use a metal baking pan (rather than glass).

I used olive oil and fresh rosemary for this recipe. Place all the ingredients in a ziplock bag to coat thoroughly and then place on the cooking sheet. Also baked for closer to 35 minutes instead of 20 minutes. Delicious recipe and goes so perfectly with steaks or roasted chicken.

These are so good and couldn't be easier to make.  This recipe also works well with regular potatoes.  I don't tend to measure what I am using.  To cut fat I make sure I use just enough oil to coat the potatoes and spray the baking sheet with spray.

This is almost exactly how I cook my husband's favorite - sea salt rosemary potatoes. Mine is even simpler - just add generous amount of good extra virgin olive oil,red potatoes, sea salt and fresh rosemary to a big baking dish, mix well and bake on 450F,then reduce to 400F. Healthy, simple and absolutely delicious!

Thought I had the best recipe for roasted potatoes already...I was wrong.  This is great.  I thought a whole tsp. of salt seemed like a lot, but used it all anyways, and it was perfect.  A lot of the comments said that these potatoes looked really bland so they added a bunch of spices.  However, my old recipe was similar to the ones they made up, and I think the extra spices take away from the simple rosemary flavour.

I like to use fresh herbs for this recipe and olive oil and some lemon juice.  It is easy and has a nice flavor.  Some other additions are garlic powder and parsley too!

Very yummy and crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. It does take longer than 20 minutes though. I think I usually keep them in for about 40-45 minutes. 
**variation** - sometimes I add dried onions, garlic salt, and all kinds of herbs from my herb garden to spice it up a little. Sprinkle the dried onions on tope before placing in the oven.

These are really good!  I usually sub Herbs de Provence for the rosemary, but otherwise stick to the recipe, and they turn out flavorful.  They do stick to the foil though.  After making these 4 or 5 times, I went in search of a different recipe because I wanted something that didn't dry out as badly or stick to the foil.  They are good, but tasted basically the same as my home fries I make on the stove-top, and not so much like the roasted potatoes I get in restaurants and love.  I have now taken some techniques from another recipe and use them with this one.  Here's what I suggest: Use baby potatoes and cut each in half.  Simmer halved potatoes for 6-7 mins to soften and infuse with moisture so they don't dry up during baking.  Line the baking sheet with foil and drizzle olive oil over the foil to lightly coat, then place each potato half on the foil cut-side down.  Brush potatoes with excess olive oil from the pan, then season and bake.  Now my potatoes turn out PERFECT every time -- nicely carmelized, crispy skin, soft on the inside, not at all dry, and they don't stick to the foil!

These potatoes were super easy to make and tasted great!  I used baby red potatoes, which I then quartered, so there wer enice and bite sized.  I also added a little more rosemary and salt; I bet they'd be good with a little bit of garlic salt, too.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes potatoes, they're the best roast potatoes I think I've ever had!!  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

This was good.  Potatoes take way longer than 20 minutes.  But once they were finally done-they were good

Nice accompaniment to our steak dinner!  The roasting time should only be used as a guide as it depends on your oven as well as the size of the potatoes.  I used baby Yukon Golds, unpeeled, and left them a little chunkier - so the roasting time was just a tad longer.  Just as a matter of personal preference I used a good sea salt, olive oil and fresh rosemary. Delicious - soft and creamy on the inside, crisp and golden brown on the outside.  Along with our grilled steaks I served this with "Italian Nutthouse Tomatoes," also from this site.

As written, this recipe would have to be a 1 - considering the overall cooking time provided is at least half of what is required.  That said, with the tweaks provided by the comments I did read, this is easily a 5 star recipe.  I have been cooking potatoes in a similar fashion for years, but always with olive oil and 1-2 tsp minced garlic.  I also prefer fresh rosemary whenever possible.  The tip of roasting at 450 degrees for 20 minutes then 400 degrees for another 20 (or so) minutes is the best (in my opinion).

Yum!! These were delicious! Followed another reviewers advice and lined pan with aluminum foil. Big mistake. Ended up trying to peel potatoes off of torn foil. Not worth the "time saving" cleanup. Will definitely make again - minus the stupid foil. ;)

This recipe is very good as-is, but I love to change things up and this also serves as a great base recipe.

I've made it with both red and regular potatoes following the recipe as is, and it turned out well.  The potatoes are a little salty for those who prefer less salt, so I usually end up halving the salt (also because we have family members with high blood pressure and on low-sodium diets).  The original recipe allows the flavor of the rosemary to take center stage, but if you want a more complex flavor you can change things up by adding other spices.

To change things up, I add 1/4 tsp parsley, 3/4tsp garlic powder, and 1/4tsp onion powder.  I have found I can more easily coat the potatoes if I toss them first in oil in a gallon size ziplock, then add the spices and toss again to coat evenly.  Then I put the potatoes on a foil-lined cookie sheet (quick and easy clean up!).  I bake at 425 for 20 mins, then turn potatoes to keep them from sticking the the foil later) and continue cooking for another 15-20 minutes or so.

Very good, especially with steak.  I used olive oil vs. veg oil. The cooking time was a bit off.  I baked mine at 425 covered with foil for 20 minutes, then uncovered for another 20 minutes.

This was a good recipe. All ovens vary and some use convection so basically, just check them for your preferecnce. Not so hard to figure out.  I also disagree with people who used extra virgin olive oil (evoo) since it's smoke point is somewhere around 400.  Any kind of vegetable oil really does work best.   Lastly, I did add more rosemary and a sprinkle of basil only because we love them.    Thanks for a good basic, simple fail proof recipe.   =)

This was pretty good.  The rosemary wasn't too overpowering, and it was so simple to prepare.  To cut down on the baking time I microwaved the potatoes for 3 minutes then only had to bake for 15 minutes.  I think it says 10 minutes, but definitely needed more time than that.  I didn't have small potatoes either so I had to use what I had which was large white ones.  But they turned out great and I will make this recipe again, thanks!

For those who have a problem with the potatoes sticking to the pan, don't use aluminum foil, line the pan with parchment paper. Potatoes won't stick and it's easy clean up!

i made these last night with a few tweaks:I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, I added about a tablespoon of minced garlic, the wet kind you get in the jar, not the powdered stuff, about 1 1/2 tbls of italian seasoning, and 1/2 tsp of ground thyme. I put the potatoes in a ziploc bag and then added all the ingredients and just shook it all up and poured the potatoes into a 9x13 baking dish that i had coated in fat-free cooking spray.Also had to cook them for about 35-40 minutes almost twice as long, as other reviewers sugg. They came out unbelievable! My boyfriend absolutely loved them and he is NOT a fan of roasted potatoes, but he raved all through dinner about how good they were! Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe as a basic and made the following changes to add more flavor.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil; used finely chopped garlic instead of rosemary since my husband doesn't care for rosemary. I also baked this for one hour turning the potatoes after about 30 minutes. Before serving, I tossed in some fresh chopped parsley. Hopes this helps some of the reviewers who said there wasn't much flavor.  Great basic recipe, though.  Thanks Tammy.

Great easy recipe, had a dinner party and everyone loved the potatoes.  It did take much longer to cook than the 20 minutes, it was more like 30-40 min.

Yummy......these are delish!  Don't be afraid to use your favorite or different spices, although I liked the rosemary.  I did have to add more than 20 minutes to 
roasting time, and I even cubed my potatoes,instead of quarter them.

Just made this for the first time tonight and it turned out amazing. I added a few extra seasonings like SeasonedSalt, Fresh garlic, and a little extra olive oil. My family loved it. There were no leftovers.

I also have a similar version...I add one packet of lipton's beefy onion soup mix to an 1/8th of a cup of EVOO.  Place potatoes, 1/2 cup chopped onions and 1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper in a gallon ziplock bag, pour inn oil mixture and toss until thoroughly covering vegetables.  I put mine in a 9X13 glass pan and bake at 450 for 30 mi9nutes.  Mix vegetables after 15 to 20 minutes.

This is an all-around great recipe. It has fast become a family favorite. I've been using olive oil instead of vegetable oil for a little added flavor.

This recipe is really quick and easy.  I even reheated it twice due to the main course taking a little longer and they still turned out perfect.  Upon reheating though I added 2 tsp of butter and they tasted great.  Thanks for posting.

So easy, so good, and a very impressive potato side. My family just loved it. I didn't bother to tell them how easy it was. Oh, and I left the skins on the potatoes. Yummy!

very good base. i used yukon gold potatos bec that is what i had and they were perfect! had a natural sweetness from the potato. i did guesstimate with the amounts bec my scale broke so i didnt know how many pounds i used (but def more than two). i mixed all the ingredients in a bag and after placing them on the roasting pan i sprinkled with a little garlic powder. they did take a lot longer than 20 min. i cooked mine for closer to 45. thanks!

My kind of recipe simple and easy.  I use sea salt, and olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I bake them aprox. 40 minutes checking and stirring half way through so they get crispy on all sides.

I can't stop eating these!!!  I have Italian herbs instead of just rosemary, but I coat with all ingrediants, plus a little garlic.  I use olive oil instead of vege oil, and they still come out tasting wonderful!  I love making these!

These potatoes were amazing ... follow the ingredients as listed including the salt and you get a perfectly seasoned side dish.  I did double the cooking time however to get them fully cooked and slightly crispy on the outside.

"Honey pie" made these on the grill tonight using a few more seasonings and herbs and they came out slightly crispy and delicious! They worked nicely with a pretty salad and a perfectly grilled, rare tuna steak! Yum. Great Tammy!

Try using fresh Rosemary and Olive Oil instead of vegetable oil. Much better for you. Loved cooking this with baby back ribs and a fresh garden salad. Potatoes, Rosemary and Lettuces from my garden!

Delicious!!!!  
This was my first time making roast potatoes & they turned out great...but slightly bland.
Next time, I will punch up the flavour with a bit more rosemary & some garlic plus or something for extra flavour.
Thanks for a great recipe!!
UPDATE: With these changes, it is a 5 Star!!
I used yellow potatoes (4-5 large), eyeballed the oil (Mixed it with my hands), kept the salt & pepper the same, and doubled the rosemary.  Delicious!!  Don't worry about it coming out too salty...a lot of it absorbs in the oil.

These were great, but instead of vegetable oil I recommend butter and olive oil.  What's the best is pan drippings from a roast turkey, chicken or beef, but if you don't have that olive oil and butter are the way to go.

Great potato recipe!  If you love recipes that can come together very quickly - this is for you.  The only change I made was used olive oil and added some diced onion.  Know I will make this one over and over again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I used peeled and cubed russet potatoes and extra virgin olive oil, mixed all the ingredients into a bag and made sure all the potatoes were coated.  I put them in the oven for 30 minutes using a glass baking dish lightly greased with cooking spray...they were delicious and so simple!  Who knew such a simple combination would taste so good!

Yummy! Of course, I added some spices to jazz it a bit. I bought some chipolte chili powder for a recipe and only used 1/4 tsp, so, of course, I wanted to use it up! I added 1/2 tsp of the chipolte powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder and wow, was it yummy!

Very good potatoes.  I used olive oil and put all the ingredients, and added cayenne pepper and garlic salt to a ziploc bag and used that the evenly coat the potatoes.  It took about 40 minutes to cook.  Very good.

Very Tasty, but it took twice as long as the orignal recipe said!  The rest of my dinner was ready, so we had the potatoes when we had already eaten everything else.  I used Mrs. Dash, ground pepper and a bit of seasoning salt and then when there was about 10 minutes left put some shredded parmesan cheese on them. When they were done, they were great!

I think I'm going to boil the potatoes some before actually baking it next time just to soften them up a little, otherwise it was a great dish.

Very good and flavorful.  Had to cook for 45 minutes though, not twenty as stated in the recipe.

I used olive oil, and didn't really measure any of the ingredients, but these turned out fantastic.  I had to cook them longer (about 40 minutes).  They were simple, yet a perfect addition to the meal.  I served them with the pork tenderloin with mustard sauce from this site.

Roasted potatoes can be so yummy and they go great with just about anything.  I tossed everything in a large plastic container and then spread the potatoes out on a cookie sheet covered with foil.  I did not use rosemary but did use garlic and onion powders.  Thanks for sharing.

These turned out pretty good.  I used olive oil, and along with the rosemary, I added basil and paprika to give it some color.  I ended up baking the potatoes at 425 degrees for 30 minutes, turning them twice.  Family loved them!  Thanks!

This recipe challenged my "creative" nature, so I added 1/4 teaspoon of fennel seed and 1/2 teaspoon of thyme along with the rosemary, and chopped them all together. also I used extra virgin olive oil. The time had to be extended to 35 minutes, so the next time I think I will try  boiling the potatoes first. This is definitely a keeper.

This recipe was great! The rosemary really makes them yummy. I roasted mine for 25 minutes, and they were perfect--cripsy on the outside and soft on the inside. My husband loved them and can't wait to have them again.

These potatoes have a great taste. I find that I like to use more rosemary then the recipe calls for. Also, they need a long time to bake, otherwise some people in the family complain that they are hard.
Delightful!

I followed Monsieur Sax advice and did the following:
I put the potatoes in a gallon ziploc bag, then add about 3 T of extra virgin olive oil. Generally speaking, the less oil you can use, the better the result. after tossing the potatoes in the bag with the oil to coat, I added the dried Herbs de Provence (1 tablespoon). I added a dash or fresh ground pepper and sea salt and placed directly on the baking sheet. Baked at 450F for 40 mins (tossed them over 20 mins in). My husband said they were the most delicious roasted potatoes he has ever had!!!

Very good.  I tossed all the ingredients in a bowl and then put them on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. The potatoes weren't touching.  I flipped them after 20 min and then baked them for another 15 min. A few stuck, so perhaps next time I will lightly spray the foil with olive oil.

Use the modithe first reviewer, namely use only 1T oil, put in ziplock and toss with oil then add herbs.  When dumping out onto pan, don't dump out extra oil, roast 20 min at 450 and then carefully turn (outside oven) and then return to a 400 degree oven for additional 15 minutes.  These were excellent and we've tried every variation.  Thanks for the info!

These were really good. I kept them in the oven for nearly 50 minutes. I wouldn't double the oil, rather add 1/2 tbsp for every tbsp. also I added other spices on top of the ones listed (garlic powder, Parmesan, basil, etc).

Made these exactly as written and they turned out excellent. Since my wife likes them crispy I broiled them for a few minutes when they were done to crisp them up and they disappeared faster than I would have believed. This one is definitely a keeper!

Very nice.  I usually have to bake potatoes a lot longer than recipes call for, so I was pleasantly surprised when I only had to bake an extra ten minutes, for a total of 30 minutes.  These were nice potatoes, not too difficult, and a lovely complement with the steak and mixed veggies hubs made for dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've been doing something similar for years.  I add a quarter of an onion and a clove or two of crushed garlic in addition to Italian seasoning.  Toss with olive oil and seasoning.  You can also wrap in foil and put on the grill if grilling meat.

Easy recipe with a tasty, simple flavor. I upped the cooking time to about 30-35 mins because I like them crispy, too. Great base as well if you want to add or adjust seasonings, but we liked them as-is!

8-20-12:  Made this again, and it was as good as the first time.
3-9-13:  This time,Ann didn't like it as much.

Loved the flavor the rosemary added.  The foil definitely  needs to be sprayed with Pam - mine were sticking to the foil pretty fiercely when I tried to turn them half-way through.  I also think they need to be cooked a couple of minutes longer.  

Salt - my husband DOES NOT like too much salt on his food.  I taste-tested these before I cooked them and I thought they'd end up too salty, however once they were cooked they tasted just fine - not too salty at all.

Really good!  I think I will go a little lighter on the rosemary next time.  I only used 5 smallish potatoes and kept the same amounts of everything else, so it was probably a little heavy to start with.  I cooked for the 20 minutes and used my broiler for about 5 minutes to crisp them up.  Even the kids liked them!

I've done something similar for a long time now also.  I use olive oil and different herbs and spices depending on the meat/main dish seasoning being served.  I also do the same with sweet potatoes.

This is a great recipe. I've tweaked it a little by substituting the oil with a sauvignon blanc and olive oil mix. Try adding some thyme and sage to the recipe too.

These potatoes were so delicious with the rosemary.  Just gave it that unique flavor.  It goes alittle farther than just salt and pepper flavor.

These are always a classic.  I've also subbed the rosemary w/ italian seasoning before w/ success.  This is a fool proof recipe that would be difficult to mess up.

This was a delicious and easy recipe. I added all ingredients in a large ziploc bag and put it in a aluminum foil-lined glass pan. I cooked 30 minutes, stirring occasionally and they came out perfect!

This is exactly what I was looking for!  I didn't have any rosemary, so I used a freshly ground pepper medly and kosher salt.  I also had to cook mine about 30 minutes, but that's understandable.  Thanks for the recipe!  They were delicious!

Delicious! Changes I made: Used 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil and one teaspoon pepper. I also had to bake it for 40 minutes. It turned out so well, and tasty. Will definitely be repeating this one.

Very good. I did add garlic and onion powder as well. I did end up cooking about 40 minutes as other reviewers had said. My only complaint was that they stuck to the bottom of the pan which made it hard to stir them without making them a little smushed.

Very good. I made the recipe as written. I loved the taste of the rosemary, but the potatoes were not soft enough for my preference. Will increase to 30 minutes next time I make it.

Needed a roasted potato for Baked Potato Soup. Simple and fit the bill for what I needed, as I planned on adding spices to the soup so I didn't want the potatoes to be overpowering. Thank you.

These were great. Simple and tasty. It definitely took a lot more than 20 minutes to cook them, though, and by the time I did take them out, they were probably over-done. So all I can say is that you need to keep checking them after they've been in the oven about 30-40 minutes. Nonetheless, I'll definitely make these again.

Very simple and delicious!  Goes well with any meal - meat, chicken fish.  I prefer olive oil and used a sprig of fresh rosemary from my garden.  I also added two cloves minced garlic and about 1/4 minced sweet onion.  I scraped up all the bits of carmelized garlic and onion from the bottom of the baking dish and sprinkled on top of the potatoes when I served it. Yum!  I use whatever baby potatoes look good - next time will try with a combination of gourmet potatoes like in the picture because it looks wonderful!

Mmmmmm! Will be making these again and again!!! I served these potatoes with the slow cooker pot roast recipe from this site and they were out of this world. I did dice them into smaller pieces. I cooked them in a lightly greased glass baking dish and covered w/ foil. Be sure to stir frequently to prevent them from sticking to the dish. I cooked for about 50 minutes. They were perfect!  They had just enough flavor and were wonderful. I could just eat them by themself they were so yummy. Would be a good side dish to any meal fancy or quick! Very easy to make. Definately recommend everyone to try!

Very good, but I also added crushed garlic, extra rosemary, romano cheese, and that helped flavor it up as well.  I also used a potato medley- red, yellow, white, and purple potatoes, helped to color the dish a bit more.  It definitely needs more than 20 minutes to cook- more like 35-40.  Very tasty potatoes.

Delicious.  I boiled the potatoes for a few minutes.  I added a few cloves of garlic to my boiling water to add some flavor. The softer potatoes gave me a roasting time of right at 20 minutes.

I used regular white potaotes instead of the red ones. I thought this was just Ok. They tasted the same as any other roasted potatoes with the added taste of rosemary. No one else thought they were that special either.

We diced up 2 cloves of garlic and cooked the potatoes for 40 mins. The aroma they put out while cooking was awesome!

I wanted a roasted potato side that wasn't rich.  This was just right.  Flavorful, but still on the lighter side for a potato dish.  I will make again.  

P.S.
I made the recipe as written.  No substitutions.  Even pounded out the dried rosemary.

I couldn't stop eating these. Soo good. I added an extra 10-15 min to cook time and that was just right. I used a baking sheet with tin foil, but next time I'll skip the foil, despite turning them, they stuck to surface and many lost the top layer of potato.

Roasted potatoes can never go wrong  - if you don't do something seriously out of place. 

A good, standard recipe. Easy and quick to do, good results. A bit shy on the spices, the recipe is, but just flavour to your heart's delight and you'll have a nice rosted potatoes in a little while.

These were wonderful!  I made a medley of broccoli, baby carrots, and the red potatoes.  As others mentioned, had to cook a little longer than 20 minutes - around 30, I believe, but that's it.  Delicious!

There was nothing left! I used olive oil and added some paprika, dried garlic flakes, and seasoned salt. Baked them for about an hour.

I have made this recipe 3 times now. The first time I made them I followed the directions exact, but, my potatoes ended up being too crispy and burnt to my pan! They were still tasty, but I was not completely satisfied. The second time I made them, I covered the bottom of my dish in foil and only baked them for 15 minutes. They ended up sticking to the foil (and each other) and were still a little too crispy for my liking. This evening, I made them for a third time and they come out perfect! I lined my dish in foil and also  covered the top with foil. I baked them at 350 for 40 min and they were perfect!

This turned out great! My dinner guests loved it.
I added some garlic salt, marinated everything for approximately four hours and doubled the cooking time.

One of my favorite foods to make. I really love the taste of these potatoes and I add a little thyme to up the flavor! it does take a lot longer to cook though.

Super Easy! I used small yellow potatoes, because that's what I had. I added salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning with just a bit of chili powder for a kick. I cooked them at 450 for 17ish minutes, then broiled for 4 minutes to get them golden and crispy! Love!

These potatoes were wonderful.  I did have to bake them for about 10 minutes longer than suggested on the recipe.  Also, I used "fine herbes" instead of rosemary because it is what I had and it worked beautifully.  Also, it was the correct amount of oil because we didn't have to worry about excess oil.  Lastly, we baked it on a cookie sheet with foil to make sure it would get crispy.

This is great.  The amount of oil (I use olive oil) is just right & so is the amount of rosemary, just a hint of flavor not overpowering.  It did take more than 20 minutes in my oven though.

I just love roasted potatoes, they just have to stay in the oven for 40 min, and make sure you mix them about 3 times cuz the stick to the bottom of the pan.  Instead of using dried rosemary i use the club house vegetable powder, its just great.

These are the best roast potatoes I have ever made. I like them because they don't go over the top with all the different spices. Just salt, pepper and rosemary. I would recommend more pepper, though. I really like this dish!

I have made these several times now and my family really likes them. I bake them for closer to 40 minutes to get them a little crispier. The Rosemary flavor is pretty strong, so you may want to cut back on the amount or use something else if you aren't a Rosemary fan.

These potatoes turned out fantastically - the flavor wasn't overwhelming and really let the crunchy outside of the potatoes shine. Goes fantastically with chicken breasts baked in the oven. I started these potatoes and after cleaning and prepping the chicken, popped that in too and they both finished at the same time! I've made these a few times now and will continue to make them on nights I'm making main dishes that take a bit longer to cook.

As written, this is okay.  The potatoes really need more time -- mine took 45 minutes.  I stirred them several times to make sure all sides were crispy.  You can experiment with spices to make the flavor more interesting.  I added garlic powder and subbed olive oil for the vegetable oil and sea salt for the table salt. I've also used garlic pepper.  They go great with just about everything.

Our family loves these roasted potatos!!  I use olive oil and double the rosemary, sprinkle with parmesean cheese while cooking.   For soft and creamy on the inside I cook them in the microwave for 5-10 minutes before putting in the oven.

Soooo good! I just used all russett potatoes and cut them into smaller chunks so that they would cook all the way through. I used garlic in place of rosemary. I'm not a huge rosemary fan. These were simply amazing!

Great recipe! Both my husband and I absolutely loved them. I used small russet potatoes and they came out beautifully. Because we both love bacon, I added 4 strips of thick-cut fresh bacon to the top. It roasted with the potatoes and added a nice smokey, savory flavor. The only thing that confused me is it doesn't specify whether to cook covered or uncovered. So I roasted them covered for about 20 minutes, then uncovered them and let them roast another 10 minutes and they came out cooked perfectly in the center with a slightly crispy outer. I will definitely be making these again!

very good.  I cut pretty small and they were crispy after about 30 min.  I used seasoned salt on the potatoes instead of regular. Does not need other spices/seasoning, in my opinion.  the rosemary was very flavorful.

Easy and tasty, maybe a bit too much rosemary for my 6 year old.

These were wonderful, I followed another reviewers advice and let them soak in the marinade in a ziplock bag for a few hours. My son who does not usually like potatoes loved these!

These were okay, lacking a little in flavor - I made the recipe exactly as written...if I was a more experienced cook I would have added some other spices.

I used half red, half Yukon gold taters. I also cooked at 450 for 20 minutes, stirring them, then 400 for 15 minutes. Perfectly browned and crispy enough.

This recipe is great!  The potatoes are bursting with flavor.  I took the advice of a couple reviewers and added garlic powder and Italian seasoning, which I would definitely add again.  I also used olive oil and had some problems with burning, so I would reccommend raising the oven rack up if using olive oil.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these the other day, very tasty. However, even cut into smaller than quarters, they had to cook considerably longer than the 20 minutes suggested in the recipe.

There is only two of us so I only used two potatoes. Didn't need to measure, I just doused them with olive oil, sprinkled on the pepper and rosemary and also added italian seasoning. I had them in the oven at 400 for 15 minutes but I was in a rush so then I put them in the microwave for 4 minutes.... and THEN I broiled them real quick so they would brown a bit. It is a good quick recipe.

Easy recipe to prepare. I used fresh rosemary.  It took about an hour in my oven for it to cook thoroughly.  I'm giving it 4 stars because my husband really liked it.  I thought it needed something extra, was a bit bland for my taste.

Very good! Add 1/4 cup of water to help soften the potatoes orelse it takes forever. Near the end I added a little parmeson cheese as well and it was yummy.

We loved this recipe!  I've been looking for a good red potato recipe, the kind you can get at restaurants, and this was exactly what I wanted!  My husband went nuts about it!  I did cook it longer then the recipe said, just like everybody else.  We loved it!  Thank you!

This was absolutely wonderful- my husband and I couldn't believe how flavorful it was! The only change I would make is to cut the potatoes into large cubes, instead of into quarters.

Delicious! I love this recipe! The only thing I added was 1/2 tbs more of vegetable oil and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese during last 10 minutes of cooking time.  I did double the cooking time.  My 10 year old loved them. So simple and yet so tasty.

These were terribly bland and the cooking time was way off... I added A LOT to make it have some flavor.  I didn't measure, but I sprinkled a decent amount of paprika and garlic powder, and I felt it needed a lot more salt (I use sea salt) and pepper.  I used teeny tiny mixed potatos from the farmers market and it still took close to 40 min. to get tender. Overall, it turned out just ok with all of my changes.

This was a nice basic recipe to which I made several changes. I used white potatoes, olive oil, garlic powder, salt, pepper, paprika, romano cheese and a few sprigs of fresh rosemary. We really enjoyed the potatoes but probably would have found them very bland if I hadn't made the revisions.

So good, so easy, yet looks so elegant. My fussy husband and son loved this. I used fresh rosemary, snipped, and olive oil. Thanks for a great side dish.

I couldn't believe how quick and easy this was.  I used garlic salt instead of regular salt and it was awesome!  Definately a keeper.

I'm not a rosemary enthusiast, so we left that out and they tasted delicious!  We served them with salsa.

I didn't have red potatoes, so I used golden potatoes, And ground rosemary. I also used a gallon Ziplock bag to mix it all. Stirred about every 5 min. Turned out great!

I’ve made these following the recipe exactly and they are very good. Now however, I parboil, drain and shake them in the colander to rough them up a bit, then roast. They are very crispy and a huge hit with friends and family.

Used fresh taragon instead of rosemary, but turned out awesome.  The high heat made the outside crisp while the inside turned out just right

I bought a bunch of mini red & yellow potatoes & needed a decent side to go with baked salmon. Opted for this one, and it was okay. I’m not sure I would make as written again, though. I feel like it needs some altering. And that being: smaller crisps quicker & larger is more hearty. Cut depending on who you are serving. These need more than 2Tbsp oil. I tossed in all dry seasonings, first. Then drizzled about 3Tbsp olive oil- placed in glass Pyrex 9x13 & sprinkled w/ some Parmesan. At 20 minutes, they were barely heated through. I turned/tossed. Another 10 minutes was key, and that was when I added the sprinkle of extra Parmesan & turned the oven off, but leaving the dish inside to mesh & slowly cool. 

It turned out very well! But, I do suggest modifying the spices to taste, and adding a bit more oil, otherwise you’ll end up with crispy but burnt if you don’t coat thoroughly. These were really good & easy, but I would like to play around with the flavor & cooking method a bit more than as written.

OMG.... I made these for my husband and he (and I) really loved them. I used small red and white potatoes that I had received in my recent MisfitMarket box. What a great way to roast potatoes. We will definitely be doing these again.

I make these potatoes all the time for my family and they love them. Sometimes I use petite golds which have a buttery flavor. My family, including our grandchildren love them! I use a butter flavored extra virgin olive oil when I bake them. Great recipe.

Omg! I’ve been looking for a recipe like this one. I used Greek seasoning salt and herbs that you can get at Costco. Didn’t have tin foil so used parchment paper soooo much better and dried them up with paper towels before seasoning. I didn’t have to turn them half way. Super moist inside crispy outside.  I baked them for 30 min at 425. Perfect compliment with chicken,  fresh tomatoes and cucumber and let’s not forget home made tzatsiki sauce. Yummy

Super easy side dish to make for pretty much any protein/meat pairing (minus fish probably). Just chopped up some red potatoes, tossed everything into a ziploc, and put them on an aluminum lined pan. Someone recommended NOT to grease the pan in order to get them crispy... so I didn’t. When I flipped them over, they all stuck to the liner! I felt like a dunce lol ALWAYS grease your pans if you’re cooking something like this. If your potatoes don’t come out crispy, I’d recommend turning up the heat in the last 3-5 minutes, and/or making sure every bit is coated in enough oil.

Tasty! I did have to bake longer than the recipe stated, but it got a nice, crispy crust and a nice soft inside. I never seem to have good luck getting potatoes crisped, so I was very happy with this recipe - and picky hubby was impressed, too!

Good! I used half the potatoes, posted amount of the other ingredients except twice the rosemary. I used organic baby golden potatoes that I cut into roughly 1-1.5" pieces because I wasn't sure it would actually bake fast enough. I think it would with bigger pieces just fine, or try the smaller pieces at 15 minutes. Simple, delicious, and fast as promised.

I've made these multiple times exactly according to the recipe and they are great. I'm not a big white potato fan except for French fries, but my family loves them. This recipe is one I'll actually eat--and it's super easy, too. Grease your pan really well because they do stick!

I did not have red potatoes so I just used Irish potatoes and it came out just as good. I also dried the potatoes after I washed them to get the potatoes extra crispy. After I made the potatoes I made a casserole with them with cheese and bacon then popped it back into the oven on 350 degrees for 10 mins

Turned out nicely, the only thing I might change is baking it for a little long to crisp the potatoes a bit more.
Otherwise, very Yummy!

With the right spices, these are great served with scrambled eggs for breakfast! I used salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. Also, toss them with the oil and spices in a Ziploc bag first, then place them on the tray without the excess oil. This will help them be more crispy.

I added a few tablespoons of honey to the oil and rosemary mixture. The honey gave a slight crispness to the roasted potatoes. My new "go to."

Yes, I used Yukon Gold Potatoes, 1/2 tsp each - onion and garlic powder, 1/4 tsp Mrs Dash Original, 1 tsp dried chives, 1/4 tsp sweet paprika and replaced the vegetable oil with a extra virgin olive oil-flavored with garlic and basil. I am not permitted to have salt, so I substituted the salt for 1/2 tsp of Nu-Salt (potassium chloride instead of sodium chloride). I like my potatoes a little crispier so I put them back in the oven for an additional 8 minutes.  One of the best dishes I have ever made. Can be served with anything, but tonight I am topping it with a cheddar/mozzerella cheese sauce and lightly steamed broccoli florets.

Super yummy. Used olive oil and they came out crispy and delicious. I did add a little butter when they came out and tossed them every 5-7 min while in the oven. Mine weren’t an even layer so I had to add an extra 10 min or so cook time. Topped them with a little sour cream (and chives next time) and they were an awesome side dish for our steak dinner tonight. Highly recommend. And sooooo easy. Ty:).

The trick is in the temperature! This is such an easy and delicious recipe. We have tried to roast potatoes so many times, this is the most awesome one!  Btw, we added turkey bacon bits towards the end and roasted the potatoes with it (they cook faster) and since bacon is slightly salty, we skipped the salt.

I made this on the spur of the moment last night and only had regular baking potatos. Although I added a bit more rosemary, this turned out well. It was the perfect compliment to some grilled leg quarters that I rubbed with a recipe found on Allrecipes, after brining them using a recipe that I found on Allrecipes.

Good recipe but I felt it needed a couple of more spices so I added a little Thyme and some parsley because I love parsley on veggies..  I used the Bermuda onions to use up some left over I had and they tasted great.  Used Olive oil to coat them and used a dark baking pan.  I had to turn the temperature down to accommodate the baked chicken I cooked at the same time.   I used 350 degrees for 25 minutes.  The red potatoes browned nicely without burning the carrots and onions (well onions were a little bit too brown).  They tasted great and the recipe is so simple!

I usually make a very similar  recipe. I mix my olive oil and spices ingredients in a zip lock baggie and I use Mrs Dash Garlic Herb/No Salt added. Once I place my potatoes on the aluminum foil sheet in the oven, I  then sprinkle with dry Ranch salad dressing mix. Also you can mix the ranch into the potatoes mixture, stuff, and rebake. Yumm!

Easy and delicious. I did however leave them in the oven for 45 minutes instead of the 20 it recommended. Turned out perfect.

This is a great starting point.  I microwave the cut potatoes for 3 mins, then add to flavoring, then low broil for 25-30 minutes.  Makes sure insides are creamy, and outsides are brown and crispy.

These were pretty good. I was out of rosemary, so I substituted tarragon, which isn't comparable in flavor but is still tasty. I also added a light sprinkling of cayenne pepper and a lot of garlic powder because I can't leave well enough alone. :-) The only major change I made was to roast the potatoes another ten minutes or so to make them extra crispy. It might have been due to the fact that I was using a skillet in the oven instead of a thinner roasting pan that the potatoes didn't get as crispy as I wanted after 20 minutes, but I would say, if the potatoes aren't as crispy as you like after 20 minutes, don't be afraid to leave them in for a few more minutes. Thanks for the recipe! I was looking for nice roasted potatoes with minimal fuss, and this fit the bill.

Totally easy to make and taste great!  Treated it like a baked potato.  What's nice is the brown crunchiness added that you won't get with a baked potato.  Garnished it with organic chives, sour cream and bacon.  Yum!

I took the advice of another review and added 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and sprinkled on some parmesan cheese. I think it made it much better than if I had made the recipe as stated. The garlic powder and parmesan were the dominating flavors and made it taste great. We baked it at 450 for 20 minutes as the recipe said, but the potatoes were not cooked at that point (I cut them into roughly 1 and 1/2 inch cubes). I had to turn down the heat to 400, as they were starting to stick to my baking sheet, and let them cook another 10 minutes. They came out perfectly though. I think this recipe on its own would be okay, but you need to tweak it to get a 5 star dish, therefore I'm only giving it 4 stars. Plus the cooking times vary dramatically from review to review, so know your oven and keep a watch on them so you don't over or under cook.

We liked these but I think that they would benefit from additional seasonings as the were a little bland. I cooked these on a foil covered baking pan that I sprayed with oil. They were done at 20 mins. but they weren't crisp so I cooked them for an additional 15 @450 on convection.

Good recipe. I'm always looking for a way to cook potatoes that isn't boring - the world out there is in enough difficulty as it is without more boring potato recipes. This one is good! One or two little notes:

1) Someone in the comment section (I forget her username...) suggested adding Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. I didn't have any Italian seasoning, but I can attest to the fact that adding garlic powder and Parmesan cheese is a great idea.

2) Someone mentioned that it took them longer than 20 mins to cook the potatoes once prepped. I found that if I preheated the oven long enough, to the specified temperature, the potatoes were perfect after 20 mins - anything longer than 20 mins would have been bad.

3) The original author of the recipe calls for a pretty small amount of cooking oil. I used a pretty liberal amount of oil, and it turned out to be more or less the perfect amount. So use more oil! The same person who suggested adding the Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, etc, suggested using olive oil...which probably would have been a good idea.

Excellent.  I added just a little garlic powder.  If you want to potatoes browned, bake at 375 or 400.  Good company dish.

May I offer some suggestions?
Pre-heat to between 400-450 F (hotter the better but don't want oil to smoke up kitchen.) I read lots of reviews as I had also been making "a similar" recipe a long time. Here's some tips I found In the comments & incorporated into tasty, easy clean up & time saving suggestions.
Wash, cut 2lbs red unpeeled potatoes to a little larger than bite size.
Drying as much water off as possible and this is key to those beautifully browned w/crispy seasoned potatoes ...oh yum :)
1. Take a large gallon bag, lay paper towel or 2 in bottom, add cut up potatoes  & cover with another paper towel (or 2) on top. Seal bag & periodically flip around to capture extra moisture in paper towels. In a small bowl, mix your favorite seasonings (oil, herbs, seasonings,  etc...). Remove  damp paper towels from Baggie(leaving potatoes in bag) & pour in your your personal seasoning mix (including oil) over the potatoes. Amazing how many unimaginable additions that will slap your teeth with wonderment & shock your tastebuds (oh please do  share your successes!) 
Keep fresh (moisture filled fresh seasonings) to a minimum. Use dried ingredients where possible only because of the extra moisture (doesn't mean you can't use ANY, just keep to a minimum...)
Another hint I experimented with from the other true to the tooth hints...and it works premium to the max...
After mixing your personal seasoning preference, pour over the potatoes right into the "drying bag" used all along for pr

This was very very good although I didn't cut my potatoes in quarters, I cut them in bite sized pieces. I added some zucchini as well since I had some leftover from making the turkey veggie meatloaf cups. 

Overall, this was a really tasty side dish and I will be making it again in the future.

Good and we will make this again.  Roasting makes any vegetable taste better.  I used olive oil on the potatoes and they stuck to the pan so I recommend spraying the pan with non-stick spray first.  Another trick - put the pan in the oven while you are warming it and then pull out the pan once the oven has come to 450 degrees and add the potatoes in a single layer.  Helps the bottom of the potatoes brown really nicely.

Really good simple recipe. I served with a marinaded pork roast and it was delicious. Left over potatoes can be added to beaten eggs with milk and poured into muffin tins. They are light and fluffy. Also can add various meats, ham bacon, sausage and veggies. Delicious for dinner.

Sometimes I add kohlrabi with the potatoes. I don't usually add the rosemary but that's because the kids don't like it. It's a good recipe to use up potatoes.
Good stuff!

I add quartered sweet onions , garlic cloves and at the last 20 minutes, quartered artichoke hearts and let it bake until potatoes are crispy crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. ( closer to 45 minutes)  The onions collapse and sweeten and carmelize along with the garlic. Use fresh rosemary and good extra virgin olive oil  and you will gobble this up!

Easy to make and very tasty. I added 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder and omitted the salt. Potatoes were a good complement to breaded shrimp. I would make this again.

Super simple recipe. These turned put great, almost like potato wedges: fluffy insides, and crispy outsides. Ate them right off the pan. I did make smaller pieces, and a shallow baking pan.

Great!!  Like some other reviewers suggested... I cooked a lot longer... At least a 1/2 hr & I also added cut up onions.  I think it all worked out perfectly because I probably added a little more oil than called for but it just everything most & the onions didn't burn

I use olive oil and fresh herbs instead of dry - I use whatever herb I have on hand and throw on a little garlic and onion powder for additional flavor - great easy side dish.

Tastes pretty good, but it took about twice the time in the oven to develop any browning on the potatoes.  Next time I'll cut the potatoes into smaller segments.

I have made many variations of this recipe and all are good.  Quick tips: double cooking time (approx) I line my pan, metal or glass, with parchment paper- never sticks, still have to wash your pan.

I tweaked the recipe but the way I made it was a 5.  I did like another reviewer said and dried the potatoes before putting all the ingredients in a plastic bag and shaking to coat.  Then I cooked for 20 minutes at 450 and 10 minutes at 400.  I used white potatoes and they were delicious.  I had to restrain myself from eating all of them so my partner would have something to eat when he came home!

Made these for a st pat's day potluck, put it into a crockpot after cooking in oven using 1 readers suggestions for making them more crispy using foil lined dark pan.  My potatoes went first by a long shot and everyone raved!

These potatoes are excellent. I used  herbs de Provence instead of Rosemary as I did not have any on hand. I kept them in a little longer so they came out nice and crispy. I definitely would recommend this and I will make it again.

Roast Potatoes Haiku: "Can't go wrong with this. Maybe bake a bit longer. And cut into eighths." Other than cutting my red potatoes into 1/8ths instead of quartered, I followed the recipe, but ended up leaving them in the oven longer to try to get them to brown more. Looooove roasted red potatoes; they complement just about any protein and veg meal!

These were great! I've never tried using the lowest rack in the over before. It was the key to perfect potatoes!! I used black pepper & kosher salt and olive oil.  Didn't have rosemary & it didn't seem to matter. I lined the pan with parchment which made for easy clean up.

Nice recipe. To cut down on oven time I pre-cooked the whole potatoes in the microwave for 3 minutes. They came out nice and crispy outside and tender inside. Thanks for sharing.

I really liked this recipe, but since I'm not a big salt fan, it was a bit salty for me.  I'm going to try just a 1/2 t next time.

Giving this recipe 4 stars because I had to add more herbs and seasonings to give it flavor. Potatoes are awful if bland. Also, the cooking time is way off and I suspected that it would be before I began, as I'm an avid potato cook. I baked for 45 mins turning the potatoes over occasionally.

This is very good, I even used my grinder to grind all the ingredients from dried versions of the herbs that I grow in my garden.  I think having it as a "light dusting" of these spices actually enhanced the flavor.  It didn't take much longer than the listed 20 minutes, I think it took about 30 minutes total in the oven.  I also used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.

This is an easy way to make a side dish! I only needed 9 minutes, stir, then 8 minutes to not burn them. Also, I added garlic and just a little lemon for more flavor.

Made these roasted potatoes tonight for Easter dinner. Everyone loved them and I had no leftovers. I didn't have red potatoes so I used regular potatoes, added about 1/4 tsp of thyme and used virgin olive oil. I will make this again for sure.

Great base recipe! I added a sprinkling of parmesan cheese, and baked it for a bit longer to get a nice brown (about 30 minutes).

Fantastic! I used more rosemary than written, sprinkling about another 1 tsp. over the top. They did take closer to 40 min. in the oven to crisp up as others had written. Try these....they're easy and delicious!

They were great!  My rating is based on the fact that I also added garlic salt, seasoned salt, and vegetable spice though :)  But delicious.  I thought the amount of oil was great...not greasy at all but a little crispy.  Yum!

I have made these potatoes twice now and both times everyone loved them. I did tweak the recipe a little though. I didn't have any rosemary so instead I used fresh parsley. I also added about a teaspoon each of onion powder and garlic powder. I also took the advice of other members and started them at 450 degrees for about 20 mins, stirred them and then put them back in the oven for another 20 mins at 400 degrees. This is a great recipe, easy to make and so delicious!

These are simple and tastey. I did however need to bake for almost 40 minutes. I also cut back on the rosemary and added garlic powder and season salt. My husband and I really enjoyed this combination. It seems to get better once I messed around with some different spices.

This was good, but a bit bland. Next time I will double ALL the ingredients except the potatoes. I also added garlic salt and a bit of onion powder. The cooking time is WAY off. Even at 450, it took about 40 minutes and they still weren't golden or crisp, but were tender enough to eat- and I sliced them pretty thin. I will make this again for sure, but with a few alterations.

I keep finding myself coming back to these.  I use very VERY little olive oil and plenty of fat free cooking spray to make a bit healthier.  Plus we like minced garlic all over, stir plenty while cooking...any potato is fine, just keep the quarters small so they get nice and tender.  Simple and delicious, thanks KIY!

I triple the recipe and instead of adding the seasoning to the bag with the oil I just sprinkled it on top before I put it in the oven.  Everyone enjoyed it very much.  I am giving it 5 stars for taste and for being such an easy recipe!  I lined the pan with aluminum foil and sprayed it with pam before baking so cleanup was just as simple.  We will be using this recipe again!

I have been searching for a good roasted potatoe recipe! Thanks for sharing - this one was excellent.  I tweeked it by using Klondike gold fingerling potatoes (because I had them), olive oil and baked at 450 for 15 minutes then 400 for approx. 40 min.

For years I have roasted potatoes this way, but with fresh dill and parsley in the summer.  Though dry dill will do. And yes about 40 minutes is more like it. Awesome!

Super easy : )  I put the potatoes in a plastic bag along with the oil, pepper, and salt like another reviewer suggested and the potatoes were evenly coated with everything (and the cleanup was easier). The only thing I changed was that I used extra-virgin olive oil.

I used half a package of onion soup mix along with the rosemary to give it more flavor.  Also shook in a ziploc bag first to make sure they were evenly coated.  Thanks!

not great. Too potato-ey. The flavor wasn't very strong and the outside wasn't crispy at all. I'm not a big fan of potatoes so I normally wouldn't even choose this as a side dish but I was cooking for my inlaws and needed a side dish for a roast. nobody really liked them. They weren't the worst potato dish I've had but I won't make them again.

I used about 5 pounds red and yukon potatoes and added some parmesan. I cut the pieces into 1/2" chunks, nice bite size pieces, and they were done in 20 minutes. I broiled them for 1 minute after that to get them a little browner - probably could have done 2 or 3 minutes. They tasted delicious. Next time I'll stir them while baking, as they stuck to my well-greased aluminum foil.

This is an easy and simple recipe.  The only thing I did different was to use olive oil.  This recipe lends itself to variations too.  Next time I may toss some parmesan cheese for some zest.

took the advice of monsieur sax and mixed everything in a bag the night before. i learned that potatoes don't look very good after marinating overnight in a bag. oh well, they tasted good :) used herbes de provence and rosemary.

A good base, as others have said.  Added garlic, salt, onion powder and pepper.  Roasted, turning occasionally, until crispy.

Making the cooking time 40 minutes, adding a little more oil and a squirt of lemon makes these perfect.

I too like my potatoes crispy.  So, instead of halving them, I sliced them rather thick.  Doing so allows each slice to have a LOT more flavour, as well as more crispiness.

These were so simple and flavorful! I didn't have any red potatoes, so I used regular bakers and left them in for 30  minutes. Fantastic! I served them with Garlice Chicken and steamed veggies! Both the chicken and the potatoes had to cook at the same temp for about the same time, so dinner was really simple.

Added basil too and ended up baking about 45 minutes, stirring three times. Sprayed glass pan with Pam and had no sticking issues. Very good, picky eaters like me can eat them with ketchup.

I used tri-color baby gourmet potatoes (I posted a pic - great presentation for company).  They turned out perfect.  The spice amounts and cooking time are right on.  Thank you!!

Recipe came out terrific, only I'm wondering if fresh rosemary might be better suited for this?

Very easy to cook and taste wonderful. This was the first time we roasted potatoes. We used a casserole dish because we didn't have a roasting dish or pan. It still came out great. Big thx.

These roasted potatoes were delicious.  I cut them into bite-sized pieces and had no problem getting them done perfectly.  We love the taste of rosemary.  I also added some garlic powder and Italian seasoning.  I sent the leftovers to our son at college and he gave them rave reviews as well.

These potatoes were very good.  A little salty for my taste though.  And I did have to cook them a little longer - for about 30-35 minutes.  But I'll definately be making them again.  Thanks!

We thought these were just OK, nothing special or unique.  I will stick with my foil wrapped red potatoes, red onion, butter, garlic salt, etc.

This recipe was great.  I did however tweek it a little.  I replaced vegetable oil with extra virgin olive oil and I added some cajun spices, and some dried parsley. Very good, they took a long time to cook (way over 20 minutes)but it was worth the wait!
