I simplified a little and tossed all the seasoning directly into the crock pot along with the other crock pot ingredients but other than that followed directions / ingredients (my roast was a tad bigger than the 1 lb called for). It was a little wet at the end, even with the cheese mixed in so I let it sit with lid off on high a couple hours and that definitely helped thicken it up. If yours is "saucy" before adding the Velveeta, it's not a bad idea to drain off some of that excess liquid. This was a very tasty dip that is also incredibly versatile. Makes a great pulled pork sandwich filling, makes DELICIOUS BBQ nachos, dip with bread rounds, tortilla chips, or Doritos, or add to some Brunswick stew. All really good, tasty options!

I used a pork loin, instead of tenderloin, for  sliders. After it was finished cooking, I drained almost all the liquid and let the fat rise to the top, then skimmed it off. I shredded the pork and then added more of the pork  juice to keep it moist. Then I cubed up the velveeta, added it to the crock pot and let it melt. I thought the bbq/smoke flavor and pickle would be weird with the cheese but the cheese just held it together, it didn’t overwhelm it at all. It had a nice tangy, bbq flavor. I’m definitely going to have this again. It was a hit at the tailgate party! My only worry is if I can’t find the seasoning packet at my grocery store.
