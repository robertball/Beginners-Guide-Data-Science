I wouldn't say that this is the prettiest dessert I've ever made, but we were happy with the way it turned out.  The texture definitely is firm custard, and we enjoyed it more cold than warm (just personal taste preference).

I can't get cherries here or a good brandy so I made this with canned peaches and Golden Rum.  I cut the sugar back a little since the peaches were in heavy syrup and very sweet.  It turned out very well and the custard set up perfectly.  Tasted best warm and this was a very good, easy recipe.  We'll be enjoying this often.  Thanks for posting.

I did not make any changes, my husband and I loved it.  I like it more for a breakfast than for dessert.  I served it to guests (after dinner-chicken Marsala), they ate it with whipped cream.  I like it without anything extra on it.  I will try it with peaches next time.

It turned out great! It was custardy and light. It was as easy to make as explained in the directions but used slightly less sugar.

I used fresh cherries and I was worried it wouldn't turn out. It was perfect! Did recipe as written but might have been lite on the sugar by a tablespoon or 4 and it was sweet enough might not really need that last 1/3 cup. I thought the lemon zest and vanilla at 1 tablespoon each was too much but it wasn't, in fact I might put more lemon in next time to cut the sweet. It came out much darker than pictures I see of it, I attribute that to the fresh cherries and the very dark vanilla extract I used. I want to make another one as soon as I get back from the market with the cherries and can't wait to try it with peaches and blueberries.

OH MY GIDDY AUNT is this stuff good. I made it with thawed cherries, expressed the juice out a bit so they would absorb the brandy a bit better, and used a sifter for the confectioner's sugar to evenly apply for a finished look. It did not make it through the day. I was informed that I had to make another. IMMEDIATELY! I can't believe how easy it was to throw together - just assemble all your ingredients, and you're almost done! It's good warm, cold, with a dollop of whipped cream, served with a heaping tablespoon of vanilla ice cream, or drizzled with a bit of blackberry sauce. Make it 'company fancy with a few fresh or maraschino cherries and a sprig of mint as shown, or just with the confectioner's sugar.

It was turning brown too early I thought so I turned down the temp. to about 300 and took out of the oven a little early.  I served this warm for dessert tonight and it was very good.  Looking forward to having it for breakfast tomorrow.

Delicious brandy flavour!  I would add  more cherries next time, given the addition of cherry juice to the batter, the bottom layer was a strange, greyish colour.  A thicker layer of cherries would break that up a bit, I think.  Also, I cut the sugar down & could probably do so again - a matter of personal taste!  I would make this again.  Lovely dessert.

Made this as written and then with several other combinations of canned/fresh/frozen fruit and different liqueurs. Can't seem to find a bad version! (Not that I want to.) This has become my "go to" recipe for a delicious, easy, and, pretty dessert.  Thanks for the recipe!
