I have made this recipe about 3 times and everytime someone asks for the recipe. I did add a cup of mini marshmallows to the recipe. Great summer pie and easy to make.

Very easy to make with independently delicious ingredients but when combined the result did not live up to expectations. Seemed to be lacking something. Could be just right for others who prefer lighter desserts or have the knack for fixing missing flavors.

The flavor of the mixture was good but my family did not love the final product. I think the graham cracker crust was the problem. I will try it again though.
