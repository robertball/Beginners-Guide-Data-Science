Funny that this recipe is rated 5 stars but the only two reviewers haven't even tried it yet! I know I don't like cilantro but this recipe sounds so good that I thought perhaps this time I might, so I gave it a try. I was wrong. The cilantro ruined it for me. However, my friend who does like cilantro thought the salad was great. I don't like to rate a receipe that I didn't make as stated (I left out the red onion and Jalapenos only becasue I didn't have them on hand, and scaled the recipe back to about half) but in this case it seemed appropriate. My friend really liked it and I think I would too if maybe I used a smaller bit of parsley instead of the large amount of cilantro the recipe calls for. The lime juice as a dressing is really nice, but be careful with the salt.

Sounds delicious.  I just picked fresh tomatoes and peppers from my garden and your recipe inspired me to do something productive......  Thank you.

Great overall, but I'd definitely recommend scaling back the cilantro (I wound up using way less than the recipe called for and added basil because I had a bunch on hand).

I love the flavor overall. I added more pepper and some cayenne pepper to spice it up.

This recipe makes a lot of salad.

Absolutely loved this salad. The jalape√±o is a nice touch but it might be a little too spicy for some.
