I used whole wheat spirals instead of wacky mac.  We should have cooked it a little slower on the grill because the steak came out very chewy.  My husband loved this and gave it a 5 but our dinner guest gave it a 3 so I gave it a 4.  The steak and noodle in your mouth at the same time is a little weird so it may be better to serve the steak on the side.  The dressing is really good.
