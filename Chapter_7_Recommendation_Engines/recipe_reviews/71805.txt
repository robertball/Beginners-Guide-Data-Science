This is the real thing! Empanadas Chilenas, I love them.  The only thing I did different was: brushed the empanadas with eggwhites diluted in water and I baked them, 350ยบ for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown.  They were great! Healthy version!

The crust is the bomb!  Hot Pockets aint got nothing on this!  I'm mexican, so i had to spice up the flavor to make them like grandma's.  Additing chorizo is a must!  Though, before I cooked the meat, I diced two russet potatoes into very small pieces and cooked them with the onion, olive oil, and plenty of fresh crushed black pepper and garlic salt.  Once the potatoes were crispy and the onion tender, I stirred in the meat, and shortly after a whole link of chorizo.  I also added some hot chili powder and oregano.  If I really had wanted to follow grandma's recipe, I would have used finely chopped top sirloin instead of the frozen pre-ground variety.

Oh, my God! I'm Chilean. Empanadas, are among my favorite traditional food. Chilean empanadas are unique in texture and taste. This recipe is great! You can also substitute the meat filling ("el pino") for Mozarella cheese, poultry, or seafood.  When you use cheese, don't use any of the ingredients for the meat one, just the cheese!  Sparkle confectioner sugar on the top of the fried cheese empanada before serving.   This recipe should've been called "Fried Meat Empanadas" (Empanadas Fritas de Pino). "Pino" is what we call the mix of all the ingredients in the meat.  For all empanadas, slide ur clean, wet index finger on the edge of the dough before folding and cooking. This prevents the filling from dripping or falling out while fryng the empanada. Poke the top of the dough with a fork about 3 times before frying so air can exit and prevent dough for exploding while frying.  Look for the recipes for all of them and try them. You and ur family will just love them all! Your guests will love them, too. Make at least a dozen of them for a family of three or four. For parties, make sure you make at least 2 per guest.  Cook time is less than 5 minutes. Two or three minutes of deep fry should be enough.  IMPORTANT: Pls, don't use supermarket dough. The dough recipe is as important as the filling to taste the true Chilean empanadas. Add spices to the filling as per your taste. Don't substitute anything! Enjoy! :)

This is the only empanada recipe that I've tried and I see no reason to look further! So good that my family can hardly wait for them to cool. I think the raisins add such great flavor - I like to chop them up. This is going into my recipe box. Thanks!

Even if you choose not to use the filling part of this recipe, you MUST try making this dough! It was incredible. I halved the dough for a pound of chicken and first of all, I have to say that I was nervous about it being messy and sticky and difficult to handle - nope! It yielded 8 large empanadas and one small one, with a lot less fuss than I thought (I rolled my circles out to be about 6 inches in diameter and they have to be THIN). Let me also say that it fries up flaky and perfect - just make sure your oil is hot before you slide these in. I tried these with chicken as follows: I sauteed half of a chopped onion in some olive oil and added a pound of cubed chicken breast. Added about 1 tsp. chili powder, 3/4 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. cumin powder, 1 tsp. paprika, 1/4 tsp. ground black pepper. I covered this and let it cook on medium heat, stirring occasionally. When the chicken was cooked through I let it cool (omitted the raisins and vinegar) and added half a cup of chopped orange bell pepper and a tablespoon of chopped cilantro. Shredded the chicken into smaller pieces and divided into two portions; added habanero cheese to one and left the other as is. Used this to stuff the empanadas, and they were fantastic! We liked both versions, with and without the cheese. Good with sour cream or chimichurri sauce. Thanks for a great recipe and for taking away my apprehension about making these!

This dough is on point! I was in La Serena, Chile earlier in the year and dined on Empanada Carisco; the best I've ever had. This dough is just as flaky and crispy.

I made my own filling: 4 chorizo sausages (shredded, sans wrapping), half block of shredded mozarella, garlic, and leftover mexican cheddar.

This is so good, I'm gonna make this for my Chilean friends at our next luau!

These were great!!!!  I did change the recipe a little.  I didn't add hard boiled eggs or the raisins.  I did add cheese.  They were great just like the ones you would get at  your favorite Mexican restaurant

It also works very well if you use the end of a fork to crimp the edges.
Here in Chile they make empanadas allot. I have made them with just grated cheese, and they are really good.

Took a bit of time but it was worth it. I increased the recipe's spices to taste, and also added a little cayenne pepper (husband and I like it spicy). Will definitely make it again.

I've made this recipe several times and each time i did i used margarine in place of shortening and cut back on the salt and i've always baked at 400C until edges are slightly brown (usually about 15-18min). Turns out great each time and i've also tried different filling for it too. Yummy

I am so excited I found this recipe because I have been wanting to make empanadas for a while and now that I've found this I know I will be making them often! I did make changes, however, and they were: 1. I didn't use hard boiled eggs because I wasn't sold on the idea. The empanadas were AMAZING so I'm guessing they're not necessary. 2. I didn't fry them. Instead I took advice from other reviewers and baked them in the oven for 15-20 min at 400 degrees. After about 10 min in I brushed them with olive oil then left them in the oven for the rest of the time. 3. I added finely shredded carrots and super diced potatoes mostly because I had them left over from an earlier recipe. I couldn't taste the carrots so I figured this is a good way to sneak in veggies. The potatoes were also a good addition. 4. I was worried about the raisins but they actually added a yummy bite of sweetness to the empanada. But I wanted to be fun/quirky and make a garnish on the side to compliment the taste. SO I decided to make a grape salsa, which tastes AMAZING (along with sour cream) with the 'panadas. I eyed all ingredients but basically it calls for a seeded chopped jalapeno, some diced onion, chopped cilantro, a bit of vinegar, a sprinkle of salt and chopped grapes (chopped into 8ths of 4ths). Mix it all in a bowl and TA DA!  Overall I LOVED this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I started out by chopping into cubes onions, green peppers and tomatoes.  I sauteed the vegetables once it started to brown I added the ground beef and I seasoned with salt, garlic powder, black pepper.  Once the ground beef cooked well, I drained the oil/grease out of the pan.  With the ground beef fully cooked I added it back to the pan and I then added enough raisins (to taste).  After a few minutes of the meat and raisins blending I removed the pan from the stove top and I added chopped hard boiled eggs..I used more egg white (higher in protein).  Let the meat cool off.  I purchased the Goya disks and since they're thick I actually used a rolling pin to stretch out the disc...this was a great idea because I could add alot more meat. To some empanadas I added White Spanish Cheese (lite salt) on top of the ground. I tightened the edges and covered the empanada lightly with egg white. I lightly covered the baking pan with vegetable PAM spray and lined up the Empanadas.  I baked as recommended for 20 minutes @ 400 degrees.  Once I saw the empanadas browning I took them out of the oven and lightly brushed Molasses over each.  I let them cool for a few minutes before we began to enjoy them...they were Awesome!!! Everyone loved the Empanadas and definitely a healthy way eat them. Give it a try and let me know your thoughts.

I am not sure what I did wrong. My dough was nothing like the finished product of a lot of the photos on this site.  I do see some photos that look like mine did-which was pale white and very bland.  The filing was bland, too.  I made a double amount and ended up giving them away.  I spent most of the day making them, too.

I've made this recipe several times, both as written and with changes.  It's great both ways!  I've found the egg is so subtle I don't really miss it.  Instead, I usually replace it with diced potatoes or hash browns if I don't want to wait for the potatoes to cook.  I've also tried puff pastry instead of the dough recipe and it's probably sacrilege but it's handy for a quicker meal.  You can freeze the filling, the rolled out dough circles (separated by wax paper in a ziploc), or the whole cooked empanada.  The puff pastry doesn't reheat as well.  The recipe as written freezes great and microwaves like new!

Very good! The dough was tuff to roll out. I tried half of the batch in the oven for 400 degrees per the other reviews, I didn't care for it too much. The other half I fried and it was way better!! Definitely fried is better, the dough was so much softer and flaky than when it was baked. I did my own filling, I used ground beef and added chorizo. I also added small cubes of potatoe and minced garlic and a fresh jalepeno with the onion. I used Goya seasoning, salt, pepper, cumin, oregano, and crushed red pepper and tomatoe.

We loved them...i was a little iffy about the raisins but choose to put them in...my daughter and fiance didn't know about the raisins until after...and they was very good...I think i might over stuffed them or something because I had 6 balls of dough leftover so I made fried apple pies with those....

Great recipe. I have been making Empanadas for years now but not the dough. Today I decided to make the dough seeing how it is not available where I live. The entire dish was gone in seconds. I always add olives, roasted red peppers and some garlic. Thanks for this dough recipe it is great..

These are the closes I've seen to my mothers.  Please give yourself the time to make them as it seems like it took a while, perhaps b/c I kept checking the laptop to be sure I did everything.  I added 2 microwaved baked potato cut into small pieces to the mixture.  I would also recommend adding more salt.  The next time I make the dough I'll roll it out thinner b/c the way I had started them it was kind of thick . I may also try the oven as suggested.  Oh, I also enjoyed a miller light for the cook.  :)

I did not use the egg or raisins and I substituted morning star farms crumbles for ground beef.  My family ADORED them!  Next time, and there WILL be a next time I will add a bit more spice and some cheese!

I lived in Chile for over three years, and these are very close to what my husband and I became accustomed to. I did, however, add a little hot sauce to the filling to spice it up a little, and black olives to each empanada . I kept every thing else the same. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...making them brought back fond memories !!

I was very hesitant to try this recipe because the thought of working with dough terrifies me.  But, after several small batches, they finally came out perfect.  Novice cooks don't be scared, if I can make these you can too.  The trick to filling them is to add only a tablespoon of meat to the dough and partially seal it, then repeat until it is full (I tried to add the meat all at once and kept making holes in the dough).  I ended up baking these for 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  The first batch I brushed them with egg whites and the second batch I brushed with milk and honey.  I agree with another reviewer that the dough is probably best fried, but I wanted to make them a little healthier and they still tasted wonderful.  Thanks for a delicious recipe, and I can't wait to try them deep-fried.

This is a good base recipe to which other ingredients may be added.  For instance, I added diced green bell pepper, garlic, parsley and thyme.  I also followed the advice of other reviewers and added a diced potato and cheese, but I omitted the boiled egg.  All of these extra ingredients helped bump up the flavor a little.

These were so good, my husband and I fought over the last one! I made the recipe as listed with no substitutions, but I did add a little more cumin, paprika and cayenne pepper to spice up the filling a bit. The raisins add the perfect touch of sweetness to complement the spicy meat--I would probably increase the amount of raisins next time. I don't have a deep fryer, so I fried the empanadas in about 3 inches of oil in a deep saucepan and it worked fine (be sure to use a digital thermometer to check the oil's temperature before you add the empanadas). The dough fries up so light and flaky! I would make more right now if they weren't so terrible for me :(

Yes! I was so happy to see this recipe! They bring back fond memories of my study abroad trip to Santiago when I was in college.  This recipe is exactly how they are traditionally made!  I followed the recipe exactly except for one spice...I used allspice instead of cumin...I'm not a big fan of cumin and trust me...it's even better with allspice!  Thanks for sharing CNCOOK!

I am giving this a 4-star rating only for 2 reasons: First, the spices are not sufficient. Taste your ground beef mixture before stuffing. I didn't measure my additions, but extra salt and cumin, as well as some chili powder and a dash of cayenne brought it up to my tastes. Second, 5 minutes is far too long to cook these. I did the first per the recipe, but for the remaining ones, I turned them in the fryer as soon as the edges looked golden brown. The flavor of the raisins was great, but I'm not convinced that the egg added much. Very much worth the work, CNCOOK! Thank you! Edit: I made these again, this time without the egg. I didn't miss it. Also, my fryer was filled with brand new oil, and it did take about 5 minutes to cook them. :)

This was my first time making or even eating empanadas.  I was apprehensive at first because of the ingredients (eggs? raisins? vinegar?!) but pleasantly surprised by the results.  The dough was easy to work with following refrigeration.  I also baked mine vs. frying.  Very good recipe!

They were tasty but very hard work (more that 2 hours in the kitchen).   It would have been easier to roll our the dough and use a cookie cutter to cut out the thin circles (but the diameter was not specified).
I used 1/2 cup of margarine (1 stick) instead of the shortening.  I baked at 350 for 20 minutes and it was not done, so I continued at 400 degrees for another 15-20 minutes- (that's when it started turing golden brown.

I use the dough recipe and then stuff them with whatever strikes my fancy at the time.  The dough is fantastic.  I make it gluten free, and people that have tried them couldn't tell.

I made these for dinner tonight and I ate them until I had no more room in my belly!!  What a yummy recipe!  I followed some reviewer suggestions and added diced potatoes and chorizo sausage.  It was perfect.  I think if I had not added the chorizo, I would have added hot pepper or some kind of spice to kick up the heat, but the chorizo did enough for me.  I did half the batch deep fried and the other half baked at 400* for 20 minutes(brushed with olive oil at the halfway mark).  We loved both methods equally.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Very very good, fairly easy to make, I thought the meat needed a little more.   I personally like my food more heavily seasoned and medium spicy. So, I added the following to the meat mixture:  Mrs. Dash Southwestern Chipotle seasoning, Smoked paprika,McCormick "Season All" seasoned salt, a little more cumin.  The pastry came out great, nice and flaky and crispy.

I did alter this recipe heavily - sorry... I used the dough recipe, using margarine in place of shortening, and that was fantastic. I didn't have the spices - I used the rest to make taco seasoning - so I used my taco seasoning instead! I used chopped onion and green peppers. It was sooooo good. My father who NEVER eats meals had 3 of these!!! He also asked that any leftovers be put away for him. I'm still in shock! There is no better compliment! The rest of us used sour cream and/or salsa to top them. Oh sooo good. Thank you so much for this base recipe!

I must say I really loved the dough. It is perfect although frying it was a pain.  Next time I plan to bake.  The filling however I totally changed that since I did not have all the ingredients.  I think you put anything to your taste and come out a "winner"

This was awesome! Was not hard to make! I am the world's worst with rolling out dough, and this was by far the easiest to handle EVER! I married into a German family. They make something very similar called perogies or vranakha. It's same thing just filled with homemade cottage cheese, so I split my dough and did both! They loved it! It has now been voted in for Friday dinners. It makes up a ton too, so we ate for a few days on one batch. O, FYI, we had some fried and some baked: they preferred the baked ones, by consensus vote! We will be filling these little darlings with baked apples, strawberry jam, chicken mixed with veggies and cream soup (think chicken pot pie!) The list is endless! Thanks SO VERY MUCH FOR THIS!

This is good!! What inspire me to make this was when I was taking Spanish class and one of the students brought this dish to class for everyone to try. Since I tried this dish, I decided to go to this "recipe site" and look for a recipe for empanadas. Of all recipes for empanadas, I decided to try this one, because it came close to what I was looking for. The only thing different I did was instead of hard-cook eggs, I replaced it with chopped potatoes (peeled) and even add a little bit of cinnamon to give it that sweetness. I also like how raisins enhanced the flavor. Otherwise, this taste great and thank you very much!!

Fabulous recipe, crust is amazing just the right texture, i did follow some suggestions based on reviews, adding the russet potato and garlic salt. Also you have to try the cheese only variation, string cheese or mozzarella is perfect. Thank you for a fabulous recipe.

This is pretty good.  I added chili paste to the meat.  The stuffing is good, but we like a little heat in our food.  I baked the dough, and it was alright.  It is better to fry it.  I would follow her directions on the dough.

These were so good, and a big hit with everyone at my dinner party.  I followed the recipe, but left out the eggs and used refrigerated dough.  I fried them in an electric skillet because I don't have a deep fryer.  The flavor was wonderful, it sounds like a strange combo; beef, paprika & cumin with raisins, but they are delicious!

This recipe is so yummy! It tastes just like the authintic Chilean Empanadas. I did add a tablespoon of chilean oregano and 2 cloves of chopped garlic. I also baked it instead of frying it. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I'll definately use this recipe again!

These empanadas are delicious, and my husband, who is from peru, says they are just about like those he's eaten there. He likes them with very hot pepper salsa. I think it's important  to deep fry them because they don't really have much shortening in proportion to the amount of flour. The deep frying gives them a pastry taste rather than a "biscuity" one. Try them!

Recommended!!!  I made this empanada dough earlier this week, but I used my own recipes for the fillings.  I made some with a pork filling and others with a shrimp filling.  I made the dough just as the recipe states, however, I did add a little baking powder so they would puff up a little when fried... The recipe made 16 large empanadas.  My husband and his son raved about them and I loved them too!  They were delicious re-heated and I also froze some to test how they would be afterwards--they were great!  I posted a photo of the shrimp empanadas... take a look!  

P.S.  This is my first try at making empanadas and I am sticking with this recipe because it's great and there's no reason to look any further!  In addition to that my step-son said they were better than the empanadas he had in NYC!

This is a review for the dough only, I used a different filling. ABSOLUTELY PERFECT crispy bubbly dough, not difficult at all to make. I can't imagine why someone would do baked empanadas when these are so simple to do, and vastly superior. 

Three tips: 

First, if you don't have a pastry dough cutter, you can use the tip of a wire whisk. Just poke it down into the flour rapidly and repeatedly like an ice pick for about 4 minutes. 

Second, this would not come together as a ball for me without a little kneading. About 30 seconds on a floured counter was all it took. Your mileage may vary, I think the water temperature makes a difference here.

Finally, during the frying phase, I did two batches. The first I fried on one side and then turned about half way, and then turned again right near the end. The second batch I did the exact same, EXCEPT I basted the top with a giant spoon for the first minute. Next time, I'm basting every batch, that gave a much better bubbly crust.

This is a first for me. After a friend from church made these, I knew I had to give them a try.  Pastry intimidates me as I don't have a lot of experience with it, and what I've ruined in the past left me discouraged  and I decided it's not worth the time, effort, and expense if I end up throwing it in the garbage. But... these turned out fantastic! I baked half of them, and the other half I deep-fried. And I have to say, baked, they are awesome! But, deep-fried..." Awesomer"!!! This will be THE appetizer for any and every occasion.

I only used the dough for this and created my own stuffing. My husband and his work buddies, one of whom is south american and eats these regularly, loved them. His Chilean friend said they were better than his wifes!

The filling is ok but I had to add a lot off extra seasoning to get it right and the dough is very bland which is fine if you are planning on making a dessert but if you're adding the pino I would definitely use a different recipe for the dough.

I used my own filling recipe (ground beef onion garlic, smoked paprika, Mexican oregano) I sauteed it all together and drained it well and added bread crumbs and an egg.

I rolled the pastry very thin and did not poke holes in them. They were well sealed and did not leak. The crust puffed up in the peanut oil in my deep fryer very nicely. 

Really good pastry for the fryer.

i don't care for raisins all that much so I left them and the vinegar out. Other than that...the pastry and meat were very good. My family devoured these tasty meat pies with chunky salsa and sour cream. YUM. Will definitely make these again!

These were very tasty! I omitted vinegar and raisins. I added some All Spice,  beef broth and cooked potato pieces. It gave it a nice flavor. I also baked these @ 375 for @15 min. flip halfway. I just rubbed beaten egg whites on dough! For the kids I added some cheese. Served with sour cream with a few drops of lemon juice. Yum!

I decided to try this on our camping trip because it looked really good and we could snack on it during the day.  Fantastic!!  We used our Dutch Oven to brown the meat and then fried it in there too!  I premixed all of the spices in a baggie at home and used pre-made empanada wraps I got at the grocery store to make it easier.

I used this recipe strictly for the dough. My mother and I have tried various ways of making dough, but they never seemed to come out quite right. This dough comes out great! It's just how I remember it from Puerto Rico. It does take a good amount of time to make, and it is a challenge without said pastry blender, but it's worth the work if you really want an authentic empanada dough. I used about 1/4 cup more water than was called for, and I also used extra flour for rolling the dough into disks. Delicious!

It is quicker if you make the dough in the morning,  But now I use 3 Pillsbury roll-out pie doughs to speed it up. I only use 1 lb. of meat (change servings to 16).  I put fork holes in the empanada so they don't bulge and split open.  I bake it for 10 minutes at 350, baste top to look better (it made 32). The raisins are great and I add a bit more spice so it doesn't taste like sloppy joes. I found it easy for a beginner cook (but it is time consuming) and the presentation looks great!

This was not good at all.  The dough remained "doughy" no matter how long I fried it. The outside would be brown & inside would be doughy. We also had to find something else for dinner since it was basically burnt raw dough. I hate throwing food away so thank goodness I only made a few before I quit.

We both liked this recipe. She declared it a keeper. I cheated by using the pre-made Goya empanada wrapper, they are located in your grocers freezer section. Just defrost and roll out abit with a rolling pin and add this filling, easy.
Now about the two ingredients everyone comments on, eggs and raisins. I liked both, but I wouldn't go to the trouble to boil eggs just for this recipe. It would be fine without. Now the raisins really added a nice sweetness. Thanks for a new household favorite recipe!

DA BOMB! Upped the cumin and paprika and added a few pats of butter and a little more salt to the dough. I questioned the raisins and egg, but they are delicious! The raisins add just a hint of sweetness to cut through the richness. I also made some empanadas with just meat & cheese. Hubby loved those!

I should have expected that these would be so fatty when frying. There was just too much dough and it was so greasy. Next time I will bake, definitely. We could only eat one each. 
Besides this, you really need to add more fillings. We used spicy sausage, egg, red meat, cheese, onion, and mixed it up.

I am only rating the filling recipe as I use my own flaky pie pastry recipe for the dough, adding a little turmeric for a beautiful color.

This is my favorite empanada filling. Sometimes I sneak in some chopped olives, depending on my mood & how much O want to play with my food that day. HAPPY COOKING YA'LL!

I will definitely make these again.  This is my familyโs New Yearโs Day traditional meal.  It was nice to have an exact recipe as opposed to my yearly guess at ingredients and amounts.  We also substitute pie filling for the meat filling for a yummy dessert.

If you are baking instead of frying, you definitely need an eggwash on top because it will look pale. Also don't forget to
poke a hole on top so it can vent.

Delicious! I fried them in Crisco. I added olives and theyโre nearly identical to what my Puerto Rican mother-in-law makes.

Most of them broke open. That made a bland, no flavor filling inedible, and the product a throw away. Time consuming, lackluster flavor, not appetizing to look out poor excuse for an AR recipe. Not one of the 5 star ratings followed the recipe. So, the dough was OK. The rest, figure out anything, except what the recipe calls for on a filling.

I leave out the raisins, but the recipe is good as-is otherwise. I use different fillings and they're all delicious. the dough is pretty thick, tho, and has a tendency to dry out. I recommend serving with salsa or queso. also, seal with egg wash and fork or these will pop open while cooking.

**REVIEW OF DOUGH ONLY**

Made the dough per recipe.  I fried these in a small/medium size pot (because it's all I had & because I had a limited supply of vegetable oil) and fried one I set aside as test. Once done frying, I placed it on a large platter lined with a layer of paper towel to absorb excess oil. Turned out great--reminds me of grandma's!   I have tried baking empanadas but it just isn't the same! Save the low-fat modification for another dish.

So Good! This is the first time I made empanadas. I used the suggested filling and did not make the dough. I used puff pastry instead. I also added chopped Spanish olives , a little chili powder, extra cumin, oregano and cayenne pepper to give it a kick. I brushed the pastry with an eye wash and baked for 25 minutes at 350.  So light and tasty!

Awesome recipe. I made as is but added chopped green olives. I wouldn't change anything. The crust is flaky and crisp. I don't have a fryer but it worked fine frying in a deep skillet and flipping.

Delicious, flaky crust filled with flavorful meat.  I am in love.  I have never had an empanada before, and these are amazing.  I am adding these to my "must make again soon" folder.  The only thing different that I did on the recipe was to substitute the shortening for lard, because I didn't have any shortening.  They take a while to make, so give yourself about 3 hours.  But they are completely worth it!

They were delicious. I eliminated the raisins, eggs and vinegar. I added about 4 ounces of el pato tomato sauce and a few other herbs. I brushed with the egg water wash and let it soak in before I baked them. They reheat so well and crisp up perfectly. They are a family favorite!

I did not make the dough recommended in this recipe; instead I used a pre-made refridgerated piecrust and baked them in the oven (next time I will need 2 boxes of dough, I had plenty of meat leftover).  I cut the dough with the rim of a large drinking glass and made small appetizer sized empanadas.  I added sliced green olives to the recipe instead of the raisins and served them warm with a chimichurri sauce. My family loved them and are already asking when I can make them again.

I love making anything from scratch, especially when it comes to dough. at first glance the dough recipe looks way too simple, and didn't have any butter element. as tempting as it was for me to tweak it, I kept the recipe as is. I am so glad I did! it was on point! flaky and just the right amount of chew...absolutely delicious. as for the filling I substituted more meat because I only had a little less than 1/2 a lb of ground beef, so I added half a link of jalepeno Italian sausage. I also added a few cloves of garlic...because what's onions without garlic? and because we live in the south, everything tastes better with Creole seasoning.

I halved the recipe and modified it a bit. I added chorizo, used half a pound of ground beef (80/20), used about 2/3 of the spices after I had measured them out together in a small bowl, added a little garlic powder, and brushed them with eggwash and baked them. I baked them at 350 degrees but they took a long time, next time I would bake them at a higher temperature for a shorter amount of time. The crust came out a little too crunchy - but good, nonetheless. I LOVED the filling as I made it - the raisins and egg were actually great additions; I admit I was skeptical! This made 8 empanadas for me - I always tend to oversize things, though. Great dinner, would make again!

I had made a different filling to reuse leftover meatballs and added different stuff to it.  This review is for the dough: The dough was so easy to work with.  I did use butter because I didn't have shortening.   It was still workable but will result in a tougher texture.  For sure, I will pick up shortening the next time I make empanadas.  1/24/15:  So Infinally made the fillings.  It was bland....will need to add more seasonings until just right!

Awesome recipe! I did make a few changes. I knew that a pinch of salt would not be enough to taste the flavors so I used 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of season salt and 1 teaspoon of beef bouillon powder. I also used turkey instead of beef and omitted the raisins, vinegar, and eggs. For the crust I used Chef John's buttercrust pastry dough. I used the buttercrust pastry dough so I can bake it and still have the crunchy/flaky exterior. I will make again!

This recipe was too labor intensive for the finished product in my opinion. They fried up great in the deep fryer, but it was just too much fried dough for me. I was only able to eat 2 because of the grease.

I never cook with raisins so I omitted them from this recipe. These turned out pretty good. However, I did get tired of frying them so we used the left over meat and made tacos for the kids.

These were good! Only changes I made were that I added some garlic powder and some chili powder and I baked them. The kids liked them so that's good. I think they'd be better fried (what isn't?) but i wanted to go the healthy route :)

Perfect dough and instructions! I was scared making these cause the last time I tried making empanadas I baked then in the oven and they were so hard we had rocks for dinner! These came out great, Thank you :)

Recipe said to cook 5 minutes, but that seems too long. I pulled mine out after a minute or two and although they didn't gave a nice brown look they were lighter, crispy and the filling stayed moist. Next time I'll try a higher temp and less time. Great recipe!

I don't know what I did wrong, but it was very very dry and tasted like eating dry hamburger. I've had these before though and they are very good...when made correctly.

The recipe was a good one, but I ended up using left over pot roast (which was delicious) and store bought refrigerated dough.  I do not recommend going the store bought route - it made these very greasy as it soaked up the grease in the pan (and they are already heavy with fats.)  The mix was very good - I was a little hesitant on adding the egg and raisins, but it was really good.

This was really good but needed more seasoning.I added a teaspoon of garlic and extra teaspoon of cumin,mixed in 1&1/2 cup of mexican spiced cheese blend. My family love it,not as hard to make as I thought it would be.

These are SO yummy! I 1/2 the dough and left the meat mixture the same and ended up having more then enough meat.  We didn't have any raisins so I didn't put them in, if you're a little weirded out by the raisins (like we kind of were) you don't need to ad them. I did however ad a green pepper to the meat mixture, and that just added a little more zing.  Also we dipped our Empanadas in guacamole which was a nice compliment, although not needed as the empanadas were nice a juicy.

These were really good I had never had them before.  I did change a few things however.  First I did buy the Goya discs, I added some chopped potatoe, green onion, crushed red pepper, garlic and onion powder and in my husband's added some haberno sauce to really spice it up.  I also did half ground beef and had 1 chicken breast left over so I did chicken in half with all the same spices.  The chicken ones were so much better than the ground beef even my husband who's not a big chicken lover liked the chicken better.  Next time, I think I'll do chicken and shaved steak and maybe try baking them :)  Great recipe thanks for sharing.

Great basic recipe, but keep in mind the ingredients are all pretty mild.  A pinch of salt is a little too little for our taste.  Spiced up to personal taste and these are yummy!

Recipe is great.  To save time on the dough, I used frozen Goya Discs.  Thaw them and add the filling.

They tasted great, i didnt make them with ground beef, but only cheese. The dough was a little hard to get it "just right" but at the end they tasted awesome!!!

It got so many good reviews I thought I'd give it a try. It was bland, greasy and extremely disappointing. I hate wasting food but we tossed these and ended up eating a frozen pizza for dinner instead.

These are really good... one of the nice things is that you can change the filling.  You really could put just about anything in them...

From what Ive tasted of Empanadas from various countries this tastes like a flavorless Mexican version.  Needs much more salt!
