Good recipe, but breading falls apart in pan. Maybe if scallops are doubled dipped, the breading would stay on. Nice twist for a scallop.

Very good. I used a little flour so the breading did not fall off like others have experienced. This one is a keeper

If pan frying, make sure the first side is medium to dark brown (not burnt) before you flip it, and make sure you flip it VERY carefully so that the crust doesn't fall off. I baked the second batch in the oven at 375 for 20 min and had better luck that way. My scallops were small so the baking time would be different for large ones.  Just coat the bottom of a pan with melted butter, flip scallops once to coat with butter, and then place in the oven. The flavour was very nice.
