I made these last night and they are dynamite! A suggestion: I made the first batch dropping the cookies in rounded teaspoons like suggested and they came out a little small and hard. The second batch I made slightly bigger, like a teaspoon and a half, and they came out much softer and chewier. They are really great.

Loved this recipe. Used carrot cake mix as that was all I had in the house. I also added 3 Tbsp. of water to this recipe after reading the review from the lady in Canada saying hers did not spread too well. I will use this recipe again.

These have a nice flavor, but didn't spread out very much--ended up looking like little balls.  That may be because I live in Canada and our cake mixes are in grams, not ounces.  I might have had too much cake mix and it made to batter too thick.  But I'll make them again.  Very easy and my family loved them.

These were the easiest "homemade" cookies I've ever made and were a real hit.  I tried another scratch recipe from here and they were too sweet.  These are just right with just the right amount of spice.  My husband likes nuts in his oatmeal cookies so I added some chopped walnuts and increased the amount of raisins a little and he loved them.  I use a cookie scoop to put them on the baking pan and the first sheet took a long time to bake and didn't  spread much so the second batch I flattened with a spatula and they were just right and took less time to bake.  I will use this again and again!  Thanks for the recipe.

Dissapointing, not like a cookie at all, but tastes like the cake mix...even the texture is too cakey. I won't make these again, miss the butter flavor of a traditional oatmeal cookie.

I tried these cookies, they were very easy to make. They were very good right out of the oven so I thought they would harden the next day when in fact they were even better. The outside was a little crisp and the middle was still chewy, everybody loved them.

These cookies are so easy to make, and they are extremely tasty.  I brought them to work, and everybody loved them.  I even had a couple people ask me for the recipe.  One person even offered to pay me to make a batch for him.

These are the best, easiest, time-saving cookies I have ever made!! I doubled (at least) the raisins and added nuts.  What a quick recipe that tastes like you spent hours.

Hmm.  I think I would rate these cookies at a 3 1/2, but I will up them to 4 because I may have made an error somewhere (but I can't think of where...).  The flavor was OK, and I substituted half of the oil with applesauce.  I also used chocolate chips instead of raisins, which I thought helped.  I made them larger than called for based on other reviews.  They turned out pretty 'fluffy' for a cookie, but mine looked like the pictures so I think I did it right.. Who knows, maybe the ladies at work will love them tomorrow.  So, a decent cookie but just not my favorite.

These went together in the blink of an eye.  I did use about a cup and a half of oatmeal and about a cup of raisins.  Used a mini ice cream scoop to measure out the dough and flattened the top very slightly.  They came out very tender, cake-like rather than crispy, and wonderful.  You'd never know they aren't totally from "scratch".

I give this recipe 5 stars because of the ease of baking and the delicious end product. However, I did have to bake it for a full 15 mts before the cookies were done. They were a light brown all over and settled well.
I used a yellow cake mix since it was the only one I had and added some ground cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves for the spice.

Great recipe! Love having a variety of cake-mix cookie recipes on hand for very quick cookies! I made 30 medium-large sized cookies and did the calorie count...107/cookie, nice! If I actually made 48 they would have been way under 100 (67 calories/cookie), which is a nice advertiser!
I did end up adding a tablespoon of water, which helped to mix the wet and dry ingredients together. Also, I baked them for around 15 minutes.

These cookies were very easy to make and my husband liked them. I thought they turned out pretty good too, but I don't know if they're as good as the oatmeal cookies made from scratch.

All wonderful cookie recipes should be this easy!  Great to take to picnics, long road trips, afternoon meetings, luncheons or tea.  AND simply unbeatable on cold, snowy afternoons with a glass of milk, cup of coffee or cocoa!

These were very good!  I'm going to make them again...soon!  They don't really brown much and I flattened them a little bit w/ my spatula towards the end of the bake time.  I used my pampered chef cookie scoop to make them uniform shape & size.  I also pressed the cookie tops into chopped pecans before baking.  I recommend these!

Yummy! Don't wait for these cookies to look done or even get hard in the oven - they will still be very soft when you take them out, but will "substantialize" as they cool. I left mine in too long thinking they weren't done, and some ended up being as hard as a rock when they cooled! Even so, I took 3 dozen to the college students at church and they were gone in no time!

This is my kind of baking! Fast, easy, delicious. Bridge club loved them! My son asked his wife not to make them anymore because he can't stop eating them! Hint: Don't overbake, they don't get brown.

Great recipe, easy and delicious! I only had medium eggs in my fridge (you are supposed to use large for baking) so I added 3 eggs because the dough seemed too dry with just two, and I didn't want to increase the oil. I also exchanged the raisins with chocolate chips because my kids won't eat cookies with raisins in them. I made them bigger, about walnut size, and they turned out fabulously! The texture was just like a cookie, not cake-like for me. Definitely recommend this recipe when you are short on time.

If you're in a hurry to make some cookies, these are so easy and fast to make. Good flavor, and made for a crispy outside and chewy inside. Use a tupperware container to help keep them from getting too hard.

Followed this recipe as written and the results were exactly what I was looking for.  The spices were PERFECT!  THe cookie was neither too soft nor too crunchy.  It was slightly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  I was worried they might get hard overnight but much to my surprise when I pulled one out of the cookie jar the next day it was actually softer on the inside and tasted better.  I did swap out the raisins for Heath Toffee Chocolate pieces...because my kiddos wont eat raisins.  INCREDIBLE!  I think this would be amazing with butterscotch chips as well.  Love, love, love this recipe!!

I am partial to spice, oatmeal, and raisins so this cookie is the bomb! The batter is really thick when you mix it but drops from a cookie scooper very well. It won't spread out but I kinda like that. They are cake-like but that's the yummy part. These are super simple to make and I'll be making them again. Oh, and if you are on WW each cookie has a points plus value of 4. Yum. Totally worth it to me.

TAWNIE44 is dead on with her review.  Too box-mix tasting.  Texture is cakey not cookie-like.  DH seemed to like these to a point, but I didn't at all.

Very good and easy to make.  Changed a few things.... added two cups of oatmeal, little more oil and about 1/4 cup of water. One reviewer mentioned increase size of cookie... I agree because they don't spread very much.

Not bad but, like others have said, these cookies don't spread. Nor do they brown. It's a bit of trial and error to get the right cooking time. Also, I'm wondering if dropping by "teaspoonfuls" is an error. I tried that, and they were about the size of a nickle. I used a tablespoon for measuring and that seemed to be a good size. Definitley will want to flatten these cookies before baking.

I used old fashioned oats instead of quick cooking, and mixed by hand. After dropping them on the cookie sheet, I also flatted out a bit, considered some of the comments that they didn't spread much. Definitely a little different than your usual oatmeal raising, but turned out great--not too cake-like at all.

These little cookies were 'Spectacular'!  My 5 year old will only eat chocolate chip cookies but ate about 7 of these delicious little things!  I didn't put raisins in and they turned out great still!

I happened to be out of raisins and used semi-sweet chocolate chunks instead.  They were awesome!  I wouldn't change a thing and loved how ridiculously easy they were.

Really good cookies.  I baked them longer as some of the other reviewers suggested, about 12 mins.  I would also add more raisins next time.

Wonderful !!!  This is the first Oatmeal Raisin cookie that has come out "perfect"- they spread to the perfect size!!  Taste just like the cookies you would get at a bakery, and the recipe calls for the fewest, most simple ingredients.  A total hit in my house, definitely will be a keeper from now on!

Today, we made this recipe. However, I don't like it. The cookies are too sweet and salty with a not really appealing looking. I think less sugar and salt should be put, which can make it less "junk food ", less sugar and salt will always make us healthy. In addition, when we shape the batter, hand should not be allowed  to touch it, because hands would make the cookies' surface too smooth that seems like liquid, not solid. The uneven surface looks better.

Amazing go to recipe, especially if you are short on time. Very easy: preheat oven, dump the few ingredients, minus the raisins, into mixing bowl, mix. Add raisins, mix again, bake. In less than ten minutes you have nice tasty cookies without any of the fuss of lots of measuring, etc. It doesn't get easier than this, plus these cookies taste better than a lot of oatmeal cookies I've made. Next time I may add a little vanilla, and some, not many, chopped nuts.  I also added three tablespoons water to the mix, as another reviewer recomended, and doing this definitely made the dough easier to manage. I also dropped the cookies in an almost-tablespoon size, and flattened them a bit before baking and this gave them a nicer shape when done.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

My sister gave me this recipe but I used pure butter in place of oil.  I am also adding 2 cups oats, 1 cup raisans, and 1 cup walnuts.  I use a soup spoon for measure and will press them with a glass.  I also will bake them 12-15 minutes.  I might use half applesauce and half butter for moister cookie.  I don't like them brown, just done and soft in the center.  I am making them for son-in-law as they are his favorite kind.  Will comment on results after I bake them.  I have made them often and like them very much. 5 stars for me.

Excellent recipe. I made a couple of mods:.
I used 1/2 cup of Splenda instead of white sugar, 100ml Eggbeaters instead of 2 eggs(no cholesterol) and used 1 cup of wholewheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour instead of 1 1/2 cups white flour. I also added a 1/2 tsp of Allspice.They taste fantastic.

Very good - made as stated except I used Sunmaid Fruit Bits instead of plain raisins.  Also had to add about 3 tbsps water to make batter a bit easier to work with.  Only the edges brown slightly, so the appearance is not the best, but they are soft and chewy and the spice cake provides a great flavor.  Even my picky 2 year old will eat them!

These are some of the easiest, chewiest cookies I've ever made.  I've been making them since last year (around x-mas) in leiu of gifts and everybody loves them.  Very easy to make, with so few ingredients, and an easy clean up.  My husband requests his with chocolate chips. :-)

I give this recipe high marks for convenience but I did not enjoy the taste or texture as much as I do a traditional oatmeal cookie. But they are soft and chewy and speedy, so try it sometime when you don't have time for all the mixing and measuring.

This is my new favorite cookie recipe.  It's a little hard to mix in the raisins since the dough is so thick.  However, the cookies are excellent, and a cinch to make.  A fabulous quick fix for unexpected after school guests!

You can't beat this recipe for being quick and easy. The flavor of the cookies was nice but I didn't care for the color. Even at a baking them of 12 minutes they looked undercooked and at the recommended time of 7 to 9 minutes they were very raw inside. Unless I'm really pressed for time, I think I'll stick to a more traditional cookie recipe.
