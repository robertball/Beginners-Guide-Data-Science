I loved this Italian twist on meatloaf!  I used fresh minced garlic, and I baked them with a tip I learned when making meatballs.  I baked the mini meat loaves on a cooling rack sprayed with olive oil Pam and placed it inside a baking sheet so the excess fat drains off while they cook!  This recipe was delish!

These were delicious and very easy to prepare. The only sausage I had on hand was venison but I'm glad I used it. This recipe made it very juicy. All the flavors in this went very well together - the hubby and kids all loved it. Next time I won't be as stingy with the cheese, great recipe Paula!

Excellent combination of ingredients!  I followed the directions and ingredients except halving them with just a couple of variations in preparation.  I looked at the other reviews and decided to try some of the saved sauce on the  bottom of my pan for baking, and that worked well.  When it came time for the cheese, I only used half (I didn't want it to slide off!), let it finish baking, and then added the rest of the cheese when it was done---putting it back in the oven only long enough to let it melt.  Excellent!  We have enough left for a really good sandwich!  YUM!  Thank you so very much, Paula!

Wowzer! Really good, easy, delicious. Only did one thing differently. I used hot italian sausage (I love spicy). I also only used 1/2 the cheese at the end. This will replace all other meatloaf recipes in my repertoire.

Tried recipe as written but to much work for how it tasted. I will take some of the ideas though & put into my meatloaf for a change.  I like using both beef & Italian sausage (we make our own from this website).  Also will top at the end mozzarella cheese.  I prefer using crushed crackers to Italian bread crumbs (texture doesn't seem mushy of meatloaf then).  We will also put the Classico Four Cheese Sauce over the meatloaf when service, but not in the making.  I use an egg & diced onion, but that is it.  All the grease from baking this recipe will ruin all the sauce you pour over for baking.  Your sauce is ruined.

Very flavorful! The only thing I did different was save the other 1/2 of sauce to pour over spaghetti & a bit over the top before sprinkling with mozzarella and broiling a few minutes to brown. I will definately make this again!

Made it to the letter which includes the tomato sauce that is called for.  It was pretty good.   Wasn't 5 star good, but I would certainly make again.  I think "hot" Italian sausage might bump the number a little higher.   Nice change to the same old meatloaf.

These are just very large meatballs, really. In fact, you can use the same recipe and make meatballs. I wouldn't think "meatloaf". But they are delicious and easy so I will make again for sure.

These individual meatloaves have a lot of flavor.  Will make again.  Followed recipe exactly.

Use covered casserole instead of 9x13 pan.  That makes it easier to tell when you are getting too much liquid in the sauce.  The aroma while these were baking had me drooling. I plan to use this again as is and as an Excellent Meatball Recipe.

Absolutely FANTASTIC recipe. I skipped the oil, and used some of the sauce to coat the bottom of the pan. I used a slightly smaller baking dish, and formed this into 3 loaves (so they would fit). My son ate a whole one by himself and my hubby and I split one. Delicious!! I really loved how moist and tender these were, and the Italian flare was such a great change of pace from our normal meatloaf recipe. Yumm!

I made this according to the recipe except for the parsley which I overlooked when reading the recipe. They smelled heavenly when baking but the taste was a bit bland. I would make these again.

And will do 1 large loaf instead of several mini's

Made this as written. I found it needed a tad more spice. Next time I will add Italian seasoning and minced garlic. The texture was spot on. Not mushy or dense. My husband loved the sauce and cheese on top. I will take a previous reviewer’s suggestion and bake on a rack to prevent them from soaking up the rendered fat.

I’ve made this recipe time and time again. The only thing I use is fresh garlic, canned diced tomatoes (with any kind of flavor ie: garlic & basil ect. and Parmesan AND Romano cheese grated from Kraft. Excellent flavor; moist meat from the canned diced tomatoes. Give it a try!! The hubby loves it!!

My husband isn't too fond of meatloaf but oh boy did he like this one!!! And my mother in law lives down the street so I offered her some and she is a very picky eater. She text me and said it was very good. I was shocked. Would definitely make this a 100 times more.

This was better than I expected!  We usually make meatloaf with sweet components so I was expecting us not to like this but we did.  It was like a big meatball with sauce.  I think with this though I would have liked even smaller meatloaves.  Thanks for the recipe!!

It was tasty but far too rich.  Meat was tender but individual loaves were far too large and I used a half pound less meat than called for.  Would make for tasty meatballs or meat sauce or perhaps green pepper stuffing.

I needed a meatball recipe and decided to go with this one due to the 4 star rating and positive reviews... I substituted minced garlic in place of garlic powder and also 2 tbsp. ketchup in place of mixing in the half jar of sauce.  I also used 16 oz. Italian sausage and 16 oz. of ground chicken.  Everyone loved them!
