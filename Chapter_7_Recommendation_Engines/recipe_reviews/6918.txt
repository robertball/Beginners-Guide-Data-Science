I'll make this again!  This has a good taste and fine texture.  It's good with butter and honey.  Next time I might cut the sugar in half.

I was really impressed with this bread.  I made the dough balls small, just bigger than a golf ball.  Next time, I'll try them bigger.  They had a nice flavor, good texture.  They were just as wonderful when they were cold, tasted even sweeter!  I wasn't in the kitchen very long, I like that!  Thank you for sharing this recipe. :)

This is a very good recipe.  I made it for a potluck a couple of weeks ago and it went over great.  I made a double recipe and there was none left.  I was making it when my daughter got home from school, I had her try a piece and then had to keep her out of it.  I had to promise to make it again for us.  I made the mistake of rolling out the dough, it makes them kind of hard and chewwy.  We liked ours best when it was soft and chew.  Good recipe, you should try it.

Like fry bread, only just a tad sweeter. I fried them in hot grease and rolled in cinnamon-sugar and we ate them like donuts. Oh, so good.

What a wonderful recipe!  We've made these as is and with several variations - add a handful of chopped fresh basil or some parmesan cheese, garlic powder/salt, chopped onion etc.  Possibilities are endless and they are super fast and easy.  Thank you!

This bread is all about texture and what you can do with it.  Eat it with jelly, or add ingredients to it like green onions and cheese, or eat it with gravy!  I could go on because the possibilities are endless!!!  Crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside!  Oh so good!!!

My 3 year old and I made these tonight. She had hers rolled in powdered sugar and I had mine with butter. These are soooo good. When I was shaping them to fry, she said they looked like pillows. And we giggled about the dough being sticky like boogers, so now we are calling them Booger Pillows. :}}

This recipe is very versatile. Its kind of like a fritter, kind of like fried dough, and kind of like heavy chewy bread. I think I will be making these ALOT more with different additions (like garlic and cheese or cinnamon and apples). Theyre so good we have just one left!

I made this last night and it was a huge hit! Very easy to make and very tasty! I wasn't sure how large the breads were supposed to end up, but I wound up with little inch-wide balls. Will make again and again!

Tried this bread last night, was a little skeptical!  Added some cayenne pepper to the batter for flavor!  Wow was it easy and so good. This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I used brown sugar, and a little bit more than called for by the recipe. The result was a breakfasty bread with a hearty taste and texture reminescent of oats.

This is an excellent recipe.  My daughter made it for me and I just had to have it.  Soft and chewy, these were excellent with my homemade soup.  Best when the balls are golf ball sized.  My husband loves them as much as I did.  I really recommend that you try these ASAP.

This is an excellent and easy recipe. I was trying to find some Portuguese recipes to get in touch with my heritage, and I stumbled on this. The bread is chewy and slightly sweet, almost similar to a gordita. My husband and son LOVE them.

"Mom, can we make a special breakfast?"  But, no eggs.  So, this is what we tried, and it was perfect.  The Boy likes them with cinnamon sugar, while Hubby and I appreciate the doughy sweetness plain.  I used the recipe as written to make 8 biscuit-size fritters.

Excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Unfortunately, I don't have much frying experience so my bread came out uncooked in the center.  I think I had the oil too hot.  However, those that were done all the way were wonderful and will become a staple in my home.

I just made these for my sisters baby shower today, and I found that I had to add a little bit of water because the dough wasn't mixing together well, this is why I am only giving this recipe 4 stars, however once I did this I made them bite sized so they would go further and then dipped some in cinnamon and sugar like someone else suggested and I left the other plain, planning on serving those with honey. I liked them and my daughter (who's almost 3) loved them and kept asking for more, now to see how the other guests at the baby shower like them:)

I like how this recipe is very simple and doesn't require eggs or butter because they definitely taste like they do. I like how they're fluffy. The taste a lot like biscuits if you cook them when they are brown but if they are a golden brown theytaste like unpowdered sugar beignets. I pair them with homemade chili. Delicious

Pretty good, have made it twice now.  Although I tried using them instead of dinner rolls when serving meatloaf, but my partner said that he found it didn't go so well.  The first time we served it however was with soup and it was fantastic to dunk with.  I have frozen some that we had extra and am going to attempt using it as part of a dessert which I have done with another fry bread recipe, serving it with fruit and cream.  I suspect it should taste good!

Be sure to make the balls small; otherwise the bread gets a bit doughy.  I really recommend this with a spicy seafood stew or soup.  Excellent.

when I was a young girl, my sister married a full-blooded Seneca Indian.  She used to make what we knew as Ghost Bread.  I could not find this recipe here so I searched Fried Bread.   This is the ghost bread recipe minus the sugar!!!  Thank you!!!!!

This was so good! I don't have a oven so this is definitely that craving-for-cake fix me up that worked wonders. I added cinnamon, nutmeg and used only 2/3 of the sugar used in the recipe. I used a couple of tablespoons of honey too and it was divine. If you want something savory, I mixed this up and used cheese a couple of times. My boyfriend loves them! Thank you for this wonderful fry bread.

These are good and very easy to make, but are truly nothing more than fried dough. I'm unlikely to make them again. 

I do recommend you pat them pretty flat before frying. They puff a lot.

I make this for my kids for breakfast in the morning (or it would go anytime served with tea).  The only thing I change is that I add Tea Masala (an Indian Spice containing Ginger, Black Pepper, Pepper Root, Cardamom, Cinnamon, Nutmeg & Cloves).  I'm sure it would be great with any combination or whatever you have in your spice closet of these....  Really nice.  Start with about a teaspoon, and add more as you see fit.

Great recipe. Mine came out lumpier than the ones pictured. I tried plain vegetable oil and also garlic flavored olive oil. The garlic gave it just a little more flavor which was good. Also I tried the plain kind with honey and it was great too.

This recipe was the best I found so far to serve my memory of an outstanding New Zealand fried bread I've eaten years back. Our family really enjoyed it but we used about a half cup more of flour so it wouldn't be so sticky. I've made this a handful of times already.

of course I find anything fried yummy, and this was great too.  I mixed with my bread hook, and used whole wheat flour.  I hand-flattened my first three too thick (I drop them in three at a time to keep the oil from cooling down too much), so I rolled them thinner and they ended up puffing up!  I filled a few of them with cream cheese, which made them pastry-like. A few others I filled with cheddar cheese.  I made them to go with chili, but they were great just to nibble on dipped in dijonaise mustard.  A keeper, and so quick!

These were very easy to make, and quite tasty with jam. I think next time I will try different spices or additional ingredients (they seem a little too plain for my taste, although my husband loved them).

Looking for something quick and easy for breakfast and these fit the bill.  I think I made them way way too large, so they were the size of biscuits, but they still came out delicious.  Chewy, with just a touch of crunch on the outside from frying.  We had these with homemade jam and coffee this morning, and I will definitely be making again.  This might be my bread dish for Thanksgiving, they were so good!  Thank you for a quick, easy, wonderful recipe.

I made this for an ethnic food party at my daughter's school...sorry, but I didn't think it tasted like anything :( there was no flavor.  I did everything as directed expect for the formation of the bread pieces.  I fried them as small golf ball size instead of flattening them out.

Apparently I did something wrong because mine tasted like flour. I tried all sizes of dough from golf ball(as suggested) to nearly baseball-sized. Thought I followed the recipe exactly and they looked beautiful but we couldn't eat them. Thanks for the recipe anyway :)

I made these to go along with Chichen Tortilla Soup III (on this site...Yummmmm)and they were very good. I only got about 12-14 using golf ball sized balls of dough. I served them in a cloth-napkin lined basket and they stayed warm for at least 30-40 min.I good item for a brunch or buffet.
