I simply love Gai Lan.  It is one of the best veggies I've ever had.  I have found it at Chinese and Vietnamese markets, but usually I get it at the China Market near my house. It's bitter so ends up going really well with a sweeter sauce.  This recipe is VERY close to what I usually do so I feel justified in reviewing it.  When I blanch my gai lan, I put in a teaspoon of salt, teaspoon of baking soda and a thick slice of ginger (or some bottled minced is good too) in the water.  For the sauce I like using some oyster sauce so it's half hoisin/half oyster.   (I use vegetarian oyster sauce purchased at the Chinese market).  I've also left out the oil and been fine, but the oil is good too.  Other than that my recipe is pretty much the same.  You could do less garlic if you don't like it, but I love garlic.

Great combination of flavors for Gai Lan.  I didn't boil it, just sauted in a bit of oil before adding the sauce.  I added a cubed  small kohlrabi as well.

I like to use this sauce to toss not only Gai Lan, but also broccoli or green beans.  It makes a flavorful veggie side for any asian meat & steamed rice dish.  I find that half the sauce is plenty for 1 bunch or 1 pound of veggies, but this is just preference.  I like my veggies just lightly coated.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a yummy recipe.  I used regular broccoli because that is what we had on hand. The only thing it is missing is a little heat so I added red pepper flakes for that.  Pairs well with Asian Barbequed Steak from this site. Try it you will like it.

I would describe the sauce as a sweet-and-sour sauce, which my boyfriend did not like at all.  He prefers his veggies with more of a savory sauce, so this wasn't a winner for us.  Also, the sauce was very, very thick.  I had to add water to keep it from turning into jello.  I think it might be because I used a prepared hoisin sauce from the grocery store instead of the regular kind you get at the asian market, which has the consistency of soy sauce.

I tried this and added it to cabbage instead. I used one clove of garlic and it was still way too much garlic for my taste. I would make again but omit the garlic - or use garlic powder.

Yum. Next time I think I'll add a bit more garlic and some crushed red pepper. My DH wanted to give it 10 stars.

Used this sauce over some broccoli and pork last night. I made the sauce as written except that I used powdered Ginger and garlic because I didn't have fresh. Amazing!!! This came out so tasty. It had great sweet undertones while still being savory. My only complaint is that it is a little more salty than we are used too.

LOVED this recipe!  We are huge fans of Broccoli so this was an exciting new one to try for us.  I used regular broccoli, but it was still amazing.  I doubled the sauce so that I could use some for a stir fry the next day.  Good idea, that also turned out great!  I wouldn't change a thing...

I used this with regular broccoli. This will be my go-to recipe for Asian style vegetables, I loved how the cornstarch in the sauce made it thick enough to cling to my veggies! Thanks for the recipe, I wish they sold Chinese broccoli here as that would be a wonderful treat!

Good but too sweet for our tastes. I will make this again but cut out the extra sugar as the hoisin is already sweet enough.

This turned out pretty great. I'm doing low-carb so I omitted some of the ingredients. Just used the soy sauce, sesame oil, and vinegar (-1 Tbs). Then garlic salt. Turned out pretty tasty and close to the real thing. Just what I needed to season my broccoli.

It's not supposed to be hoisin sauce! You're supposed to use oyster sauce!!!! 
I'm Chinese and the Chinese name for this dish is literally "oyster sauce gai lan". I don't know how I could have missed it when following this recipe but I used the hoisin sauce like it says and it turned out totally different than what it's supposed to taste like. At first I thought it was because it had too much sugar, then I realized it never asked for the key ingredient-oyster sauce!

Oh so good! Will make again! Since I'm gluten free, I made it with g/f ingredients. Can't go to Chinese restaurants because of being g/f, so this was a wonderful treat!

Very strong flavor. Part of my family liked it some loved it.  I used baby broccoli found in the Chinese section as well.  Next time I will cut back on the hoisin sauce maybe by 1T and see if that is better.

Very good but you don’t need all that sugar! Hoisin sauce and oyster sauce ( which I used) all have a lot of sugar. Taste it first then add some sugar. I also added some water because it got too thick and very strong tasting.

Love it and even better, my veggie hating boyfriend loved it.  The sauce was a bit thick so either less cornstarch needed or a tiny bit of water... but the taste was amazing.

Good. Best described as "broccoli with sweet, tangy sauce". I served the sauce as a dip, on the side of the broccoli. After making  it twice, I made a few small changes: 1 garlic clove instead of 2, and 1/2 T sesame oil instead of 1 T - seemed like too much oil for healthy steamed vegetables. Most importantly, I cut the 1 T corn starch to 1 tsp, because the sauce is plenty thick with just a pinch of corn starch, and way too thick and gooey with a full T.

The ginger in this recipe overwhelmed the dish.  No one liked it or finished it.  If the amount of ginger were adjusted to half or a quarter of the amount so that it seasoned the dish instead of being the only flavour, it would probably be great.

Followed the recipe exactly (except I used regular broccoli) and it came out great! Next time I’ll make a meal of it and add chicken. I might try substituting honey for the white sugar as well.

Omg!! Delicious!! The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar. 1 reduced it to 1 tsp and found it sweet enough.

I used this as a basic jump off point to use up my frozen broccoli.  I followed the recipe except that I added lean ground pork, red pepper flakes, slivered almonds, and it really tasty.

Really liked the flavor of this sauce. Added some chicken breast and treated it like a stir fry.  YUM!

Very good! Authentic taste. It is not necessary to cook the sauce for the full 5-6 minutes. 2-3 worked better, so that nothing burned. The consistency was perfect, thick but not un-pourable. Highly recommend this recipe.

I added water chestnuts to give it a little extra crunch. I will make this again with lots of different veggies.

This is fantastic. Combine in a bowl with Asian chicken skewers and chow mein and have at it.

This sauce is so good. I used it as a stir fry sauce and instead of putting the cornstarch in the sauce I tossed the chicken in it. Thickened the sauce perfectly. Added veggies and it was a perfect quick dinner.

I dunno.  It was okay.  I don't buy premade sauces, but somehow it seemed like it came from a jar.  Yes, the hoisin did; but you understand, right?!  :)

Great flavor and a big hit with the family, who normally doesn't like Gai Lan. I added a couple Thai chilies to the sauce add a little zing but the flavors are great without, too

4 stars because I modified for my family's taste:  Halved the sugar and hoisin, doubled the vinegar.  Used sauce on broccoli last night, but plan to use on many other veggies in future.  Thanks!
