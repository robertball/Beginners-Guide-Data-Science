I'm sorry but these did not impress me at all. When I'd finished mixing the ingredients I really felt like this would feel more at home in a cake pan. To the point where I went back and checked the amount of all the ingredients. They really do spread so you probably need more than 2 inches space. My main problem with them though was how sweet they were. If you like your cookies sweet then this recipe is for you. But I'm afraid not for me. Thanks for letting me try.

We have a family cookie bake each year and I usually select new cookie recipes to try.  One recipe I chose included Nutella and hazelnuts.  I purchased Nutella, but was unable to find shelled hazelnuts at my grocery store. I hopped on allrecipes.com to find an alternative recipe.  This one should've been my first choice!  It definitely peaked everyone's interest.  I followed the recipe exactly (including the food coloring - I used red). It was difficult to tell by appearance when the cookies were done since there isn't any definite browning, but I stuck with the 10 min. bake time.  The Nutella resulted in a moist, almost gooey center which remained soft after the cookies cooled.  This recipe was rated a keeper by five out of five adults at our cookie bake.  I will definitely hang on to this one!

If you are a fan of Nutella, you will be a fan of these cookies.  You can definitely taste the nutella.  They do end up as flat cookies, but the chocolate chips actually give a lot of them a bit of poofiness if you will.  If you want these cookies to be a little more chocolatey, add more chocolate chips.  Nutella has a distinct flavor and while it does have chocolate, it's not a huge punch of it.  The dough does seem like cake dough; don't worry, it's fine.  It dos spread, but not horribly so and they still keep their shape.  We like these cookies and it's a good way to use up our Nutella that we keep forgetting about! thanks for the recipe.

These look kind of funny when they're done.  They really spread out and they are flat.  I used salted butter and added a dash of salt (I remember this activates the baking powder from home ec).  They were still flat.  They taste fantastic though.  Careful not to over cook.  They're hard to tell when they're done.  You get a gooey cookie in the middle if you take them out at just the right time.  I used the red food coloring; I may try to omit this next time.
