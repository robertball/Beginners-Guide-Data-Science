This is a four star recipe that with a few tweaks definitely has five star potential.  Here's what I did to mine: First I added salt to the stew.  The chicken stock has 33% less sodium and unfortunately if you don't add it while the dish is cooking, it suffers. Just be careful not to oversalt.  I served the stew over steamed white rice and then toasted some pecans in butter and brown sugar and drizzled that over the top, it really brings all the flavors together. Mmmm, yummy!!!

Delicious and super easy to make. I followed the recipe and added a diced sweet potato.  I also served with bread as others recommended which was a good idea.

Great flavor, simple preparation.  Has become a "regular" in our family menu.  Added small pkg (2.5 oz) of sundried tomatoes for a richer, more earthy flavor.  Modified to use a dutch oven, instead of a slow-cooker as follows: lightly brown chicken thighs in 1Tbsp melted butter in dutch oven and remove, saute onion & garlic in butter/chicken juices, add back chicken & all remaining ingredients, bake 2 hours at 350 degrees.

I tried this exactly as it was written (except I didn't add the green pepper since I hate them).  Since I started kind-of late, I cooked it in my enameled cast iron dutch oven stove-top over fairly high heat for about 3-1/2 hours.  I was a little nervous since it hadn't been reviewed yet, but what a surprise!  This was absolutely fantastic.  All of the broth cooks down, so you're left with a sticky stew that smells sweet and earthy.  I made a side of khobz, a Moroccan bread, and did a lot of dipping.  Thank you for such a wonderful meal!

I loved this - followed recipe.  Should have used boneless chicken - didn't have and bones were aggravation although taste was outstanding.  Great with rice or noodles

Fantastic and easy.  Used canned fire roasted tomato, green onion, and added a little cayenne and salt.  Not a fan of green peppers so left those out.  There were NO left overs.  Very good ... will make again.

Wonderful dish, lots of flavour, aroma and very quick and easy to prepare.  I would definately make this again.  Followed recipe as written, but next time will try a sweet potatoe in the mix.

This was really tasty! I was skeptical about the raisins, but added them anyway. I didn't need to worry about that part! :) The next time I make it, I will double the spices, and maybe add some cayenne to the mix. It was a tad bland with the amounts called for, but I think adding more will do the trick. Also, I didn't care for it with orzo. I'll do brown rice next time. Overall, quite good, and it will definitely go into my "make again" file.

This recipe turned out great, probably the best one I have made from allrecipes.com so far. My husband didn't like it for some reason though, he's more of a meat and potatoes type of guy :) I loved it, and will definitely be making it again soon!

I cooked this today and it's delicious!!  I added a couple of diced sweet potatoes to it as well as a bit of wild rice.  Really really good......i agree with using bread to dip it in....would be delicious in a bread soup bowl as well.

Super easy slow cooker meal that is a bit different from the standard.  Great flavors from the honey, cumin and cinnamon.  I only used 1 can (2 cup) of chicken stock and there was more than enough liquid.  I also added 1/2 tsp. ground ginger.  Definitely add the raisins in the last half hour.  Served on brown rice.  Will make again!  Thanks for sharing!

More of a soup than a stew.  I added a few more pieces of chicken thighs, and towards the end I put in a can of drained chickpeas and some frozen green peas for some more body.  Next time I'm putting in the raisins toward the end too so that I don't have grapes in my soup, and leaving out some of the honey.

This looked good on paper. Far too sweet for a chicken stew by my standards, but I don’t have much experience with Moroccan food.

I only had bone-in thighs, so they went into the bottom of the crockpot, and everything else got layered in on top. I didn't have a bell pepper, but that's the only change I made to the recipe. I figured since I was using bone-in thighs that the cook time would need to be increased, so I put it on High and checked back 4 hours later to see how they were doing. My thighs were falling apart!! So, I pulled out the thighs and let them cool before de-boning them. I added a little cornstarch to the pot and let it continue to cook. When I was ready to start the rice (used rice not orzo) I put the chicken back in the liquid. I served this in bowls on top of rice. Yum. Next time I won't use so much honey, with the raisins, it was a bit sweet.

Loved the flavor and spices! I decided to add sweet potatoes as others have mentioned and it was just a little too sweet for me my family.  The cinnamon seemed a little overwhelming.  If I were to do it over, I would go lighter on the honey and the cinnamon especially if adding sweet potatoes.

Made this as written, and it's too sweet for my taste. Will try again and probably add a bit of spice to balance out the sweet and maybe half the amount of raisins.

Loved it! My picky husband loved it and told me to keep it in my recipe box. I used my own stock, which made it healthier, and didn't add the raisins because I forgot to but I didnt miss them. I was 9 months pregnant when I made this and it was quick and easy. Also, added a sweet potatoe like other reviewers suggested, and it was an awesome choice!

This was basically good but a little bland.  Next time I will use less chicken broth and increase the seasoning. There was a lot of sauce but it was very watery, will maybe try thickening it with some cornstarch. Chicken was very  tender.

I wanted so badly to like this. It got so many positive reviews and I love slow cooker recipes. The only thing I changed was omitting the green pepper because I did not have one on hand, and I added a little bit less raisins because my hubby is not a big fan. 
Even with less raisins the dish turned out way, way to sweet. I am usually a fan of sweeter dishes, but this was just too much. My husband and I each had a small bowl. 
Even though I found it to sweet, I did like the flavors. I may use the spices as an inspiration for a modified version of this recipe.

This recipe is a keeper, though I tweaked it a bit mostly out of necessity. I didn't have cumin, so I used garam masala, an Indian spice mix that contains cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom and cloves. I substituted unsulphered apricots for the raisins and a diced sweet potato as recommended by another reviewer. And since I don't have a slow cooker, I followed another reviewer's suggestion and cooked the stew in a heavy dutch oven. I brought all the ingredients to a simmer on the stovetop and then placed the dutch oven in the oven at 375 for an hour and a half.  Near the end of the cooking time I added salt to taste and a paste of arrowroot (and water) to thicken the sauce and then reduced it on the stovetop for a few minutes. (Note: I think that this entire dish could be done on the stovetop in about an hour, so I'm going to try this next time out.)  I served the stew with basmati rice. Delicious!

This wasn't bad although I agree with the reviewers who said something was missing.  I followed the recipe at first, tasted it and then added salt, a little turmeric, and some ginger root. I served the dish over rice and garnished with fresh basil and pineapple slices.  I found the sweetness of the recipe complemented the pineapple well.

Oh my gosh... I didn't have really high expectations for this recipe but it's GOOD! I used my dutch oven as I don't like my crock pot. Also used 4 skinless boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs. Also added some chicken base because I am not a fan of chicken stock. It is delicious! I think next time I will be more brave and add some of the spices from other similar recipes here and go for even more intense flavors. This is going to be a new staple in my kitchen, it's easy to toss it all together and not worry about it, just let it slowly simmer. YUM! I also served it with some pita bread and brown rice.

Simple and delicious! I served over white rice instead of the orzo.  I will definitely make this one again!

awesome!  following another person's advice below, I added sweet potato (and left out raisins) and served it over rice. It was very flavorful, filling, and chicken was nice and tender. Easy to make as well.

Delicious!  Although I prefer the dutch oven method another user mentioned, the stew turns out much thicker and more flavorful. This is a new favorite!
