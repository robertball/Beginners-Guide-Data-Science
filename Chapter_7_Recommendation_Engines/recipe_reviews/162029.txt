Good basic seasoning.  I prefer Lawry's Season Salt, but if you don't have that on hand this will do.  Flat Iron steak is one of our family's favorite.  Don't overcook, make sure the steaks are cooked medium and cut them against the grain in thin slices.  Delish! (no worries, if you don't have time to marinate, just season and grill)

Fast, easy, imparts good flavor and doesnâ€™t overpower the flavor of the steak.  What more can you ask for?  Perfect.

Flat iron steak is the American name for the cut known as butlers' steak in the U.K. and oyster blade steak in Australia and New Zealand. It is cut with the grain from the leg of the animal producing a flavorful cut that is a bit tough because it contains a gristly fascia membrane unless removed.

Flat iron is a truly flavorful cut. It will be more enjoyable to eat if you first remove the tough piece of gristle in the center of each piece. Just use a very sharp knife and it will be easy once you have done it once or twice.

Sometimes simple is best! I really like using a little citrus flavor with grilled/BBQ beef, so this is right up my alley. 

The only recommendation I would make is to rub the steak with a little oil before adding the seasoning. All of these seasonings are oil soluble, so you will extract a little extra flavor when you marinate.

Thank you for sharing your recipe!

4.5 Stars:   I added a sprinkling of seasoned salt, per other reviews, and we thought this was very good.

Great flavor even with only 1 hour on the meat. Simple and good. I did add a little oil and put in ziplock which I think helped with flavor absorption.

I season my steaks with this basic blend all the time although I use granulated garlic and onion, I find it easer to use. I will also use chili powder and cayenne to add a nice kick to the steak.

This cut of meat cries out for Sous-Vide technique.  When that is used along with a flame char just before serving, WOW.

This is very good, have used it for several years never fails to be tender and juicy. Spices do not overpower the flavor of the steak.
