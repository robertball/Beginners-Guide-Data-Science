I made recipe, but added  1 tsp.  Baking powder. 
The dough turned out to be just a little bit more flaky, which I really liked.  Other than that  it's  a great  recipe.

I used this recipe for my first ever attempt at empanadas. Turned out great exactly as written! Kids loved them too. Thank you for sharing.
