I have made this salad many times and it is a family favorite.  I cut oil down to 1/3 cup and use a 1/3 cup of Balsalmic vinegar.  I add chopped garlic, decrease sugar to 1/4 cup and add 5-6 packets of splenda.   This salad can also be made with Romaine lettuce and cranberries instead of cabbage for a little holiday flare.

My whole family loves it!  Here are my modifications: I cut the sugar in 1/2.   My kids are not fans of onion so I omit them or put them on the side.  For a bit more flavor I like a bit of chopped fresh flat leaf parsley and shredded carrot(2T) which makes this salad even more vibrant looking.    A tip I'd like to share is to add about 1/2 tsp. sesame oil.  This gives a wonderful flavor.  The  dressing will  emulsify and not seperate once it's cold so chill it and whisk again before pouring on.   I like to pour the dressing about 15 minutes before eating or the ramen is too crunchy for me! :)

I emulsified the dressing so that it wouldn't separate overnight as I knew I'd be using the leftover dressing. Otherwise I followed the directions as written, only I keep the crunchy bits as a topping at the last minute instead of mixing in as we can't eat the whole salad in one sitting. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

We LOVE this recipe. I have made it many times (the kids keep requesting it). I have busy teenagers in the house and sending out a text stating I have made million dollar salad sends them home for dinner. I make it just as is except for doubling the ramen noodles. I often make it with crispy orange beef (from this site)and vegetable fried rice. Delicious!

I got this very same recipe several years ago and nearly every time I make it someone requests the recipe.  This is great stuff!  I make ahead of time and store all three parts separately (nappa, ramen noodle mix, and sauce).  Transport to family meal and assemble just before serving.

Good salad, a little sweet for my taste though.  I will definitely try it again, but will modify the amount of sugar.

A nice change from 'regular' coleslaw. My family enjoyed this recipe, but it makes a lot. Will have to cut the recipe in half next time. Might also add some more protein to it, and eat it as a main dish.

We are diabetic and looking for new and different recipes that can be tailored to our diet concerns.  I thought that I would try this one.  It was great.  I did have to make substations of course.  Splenda for the sugar and I did not use the raman noodles.  I did up the nuts a bit.  Hubby loved it and I may add more green onion.  Hubby wanted to try some chopped water chestnuts.  Thank you for sharing.

This is such a simple recipe that gives huge rewards. My husband and I loved it and I'll make it again. I did follow the recipe exactly so that I could give true feedback on this. I might make some modifications, but really only additions and it won't make it better, just different. I can see many additions that could be added for a different flavor. I liked someones suggestion about adding a little chicken and pineapple. After I had this salad, I can totally see the pineapple adding great flavor. Thanks for sharing!

My family including my 6 year old loved this salad. I replaced onions with crisp iced lettuce, reduced sugar dramatically and used instant cup o' noodles ( which I didn't need to roast as it was very crisp). I loved the Splenda suggestion in some of the reviews will try that next time I make this salad. The best things that I liked about this salad:
1) takes very little time to make
2)is different than usual salads therefore a good change
3) good interplay of crisp and crunchy texture
4) can be a complete main course for weight watchers
5) love the appearance with vibrant colours- extremely appetising
6) a good salad when you're calling people home for dinner.

This is one of my family's favorite salads any time of the year! It tastes great and is a snap to make! I add a little sesame oil to the dressing. It really makes it pop! Also a potluck favorite.

I used regular and red cabbage instead of Napa, and omitted the ramen and added some diced green apple instead. It was de-to-the-licious.

Everyone at our family gathering loved the salad and asked for the recipe. I used napa cabbage and a bag of broccoli slaw. I also added about 2 tsp of grated ginger. It was delicious!

I hadn't made this salad for years and couldn't quite remember how it went but this recipe helped with the amounts.  I lessened the green onion to my taste, switched the amounts for the sesame seeds (1/2c) and almonds (1c) and baked the seed/almond mix for 2 minutes (350* oven). I added 1/2 of  the seasoning packet from the Oriental noodle mix. I won't wait so long before making it again!

For health reasons, I had to back way off the one cup quantity of sesame seeds. I used 1 tablespoon, but added 1 teaspoon of toasted sesame oil. Thanks for a great salad!!

Great basic recipe! I reduced the sugar and the sesame seeds by about half. I added palm hearts and next time I will pimp it up with some grated carrots possibly some chicken thighs, bamboo shoots, grated cucumber, baby corn and other goodies.

I used about 1/8 cup sesame seeds and that plus some sesame oil as others have noted, were sufficient for the sesame flavor.
