Simple and delicious - perfect for an afternoon snack! And oh my was this ever good. I'm an admitted peanut butter addict and I'll try just about any recipe that has the stuff in it. I used fat free vanilla yogurt and reduced fat peanut butter to lighten it up. (I'm still waiting for someone to come out with a fat free peanut butter in my lifetime!!!) I served this with sliced red apples that I dusted with a bit of cinnamon.

My friend and I tried this recipe and decided it was missing something so we added some brown sugar and cinnamon. That really did the trick - we chowed down..mmmm!!

This is one of my favorite afternoon snacks now that I've been eating healthier. My kids love it too! I used Trader Joe's organic chunky peanut butter and Nancy's organic nonfat vanilla yogurt.

I thought this was super easy to make and everyone liked it (I took it smallgroup bible study). I did use vanilla greek yogurt and added a bit of sugar because my Peanut butter doesn't have any in it.

This was great to fill that 'I want peanut butter' craving! I used fat free vanilla yogurt and that seemed to work out fine. I liked the tanginess of the yogurt with the peanut butter flavor and the sweetness of the apple. I look forward to snacking on this healthy dip again! Thanks for sharing.:)

I just made this dip and I really didn't follow the measurements I just combined the peanutbutter and yogurt untill I got the flavor/texure I wanted. I did however add a few dashes of pumpkin pie spice this addition made the dip more interesting.

I used plain yogurt and this turned out fine! The dip is also good with pear slices!

I made this for a party. I thought "peanut butter and yogurt how can it go wrong". Well it can't. I like peanut butter plain on my apple slices but this dip made it so you didn't have the stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth feeling. It tasted cool and refreshing even after it had cooled to room temperature.

Delicious as written. My preference is not to add sugar as others suggested; it takes away the health factor.
