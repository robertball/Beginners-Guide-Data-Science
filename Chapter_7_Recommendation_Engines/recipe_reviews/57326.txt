I've made this many times. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and everyone said it was sweet ( maybe a good rib sauce). Second time I reduced the molasses to 1/4 cup and used peaches in lite syrup. Huge difference - perfect HOT SAUCE. Also, second time it kept a good color after molasses was added. In a family where hot is never hot enough - this is a keeper.

Very good, but can really taste the mustard.  I used French's yellow mustard, and that flavor is strong.  I also used 7 habaneros w/ seeds and it has a nice heat to it that warms your whole mouth.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  Very good, but maybe will modify the amount mustard the next time.  ***I just made another batch using only 1/8 cup mustard, 3 cloves garlic, dash of liquid smoke, 8 habs w/ seed.  I didn't pre cook peppers, I placed everything into the food processor and liquified, then cooked for about 10 minutes.  This is too die for!   I am baking fries right now to dip in it!  I am thinking this is my new JERK sauce!

I hope you like hot!!...  Really Good Sauce!  Sweet, hot, complex flavors, and just when you think everything is fine, those habaneros come strolling across your tongue in a sort of delayed reaction and make your hair stand up...  I made a double batch of this stuff, using just two tablespoons of yellow mustard, and added a teaspoon of liquid smoke.  Otherwise, followed the recipe. It was a nice fiery orange color when I had processed the habs and the peaches.  When I added in the molasses every thing turned a dark reddish brown... Sort of looks like BBQ sauce.  Still good, but I may try using light amber honey intead of molasses next time to keep that lovely orange glow.  It just seems like this sauce should be a nice red-orange color, to match the taste.  Regardless, this sauce is fantastic!  It gets better as it ages and mellows.  I will definately make this again, after I go through the two 24 oz. jars I made the first time!  (It is going fast...) I think I will try bottling some for gifts.

I have made this sauce three times and like it each time. The first time I made this, the mustard taste was  too strong. The second time I made it, I omitted the mustard and added a little liquid smoke, delicious! The third time I added a few peppers with seeds to give it more heat (I like it hot) with the liquid smoke and no mustard. It came out great!

Good Stuff! I also added about 10 or so cloves of roasted garlic. Then I  took half the batch and put it in a sauce pan. Heated it up and added a little cornstarch and peach juice together to thicken it. Awesome stuff on hamburgers. Really tasty and doesn't kill your taste buds! I have both thick and thin sauce to cover any foods you want to add a little kick to! Thanks for the post.

I gave this recipe 5 stars instead of the 4 that I'm really feeling about it mainly because I want people to try it. GREAT recipe, but with some flaws. I just finished my second time making it. (made a double batch this time) The first time with all scotch bonnets(which for those of you who don't know, are about equivalent in heat to habeneros) and this time I made them with MOSTLY Bhut Ghost Peppers (which for those of you who don't know, is the second hottest pepper in the world). For anyone who does not want their sauce to be sweet, I HIGHLY recommend cutting the brown sugar AND the molasses in half. I substituted honey for the molasses the first time and it was fine. I also use peaches in LIGHT syrup to make the sauce less thick AND as a bonus it lowers the calorie count. With scotch bonnets I ended up using 15 peppers. With the Ghost peppers I ended up using 6. I also, per some reviews add a few cloves of garlic, some grated white onion, fresh thyme leaves, and a lime juice water mixture to my sauce to my tastes. Overall with these changes to my preferences, this recipe makes an AMAZING sauce that is great on ANYTHING. Start with half of the sweet ingredients and 3/4ths of the peppers and then add accordingly to your specific tastes. Stop adding peppers when the sauce is just a TAD bit milder than you like because the heat will increase a little as it ages in the fridge. Try it and you wont regret it.

I love this recipe but had enough habaneros to make four batches.  I now have 160 oz of this sauce and am not sure what to do with it.  I tried freezing it in a muffin tin as another user did, however, it just turned into slush.  I'd really like to jar it or can it so I can save some and give some away but I'm not sure if it will keep.

This is excellent. We pan roasted some garlic and aded it. It was not as hot as we expected. next time, we are going to add jalapenos, 1/2 the molasses and use honey, add some finely minced onions, and lime juice.

Great sauce. I made half because I didn't have a lot of peppers. I used 5 small habaneros. Didn't have peaches, but added a little more sugar. Didn't have mollasses, but used honey instead, and a little more honey to make up for the peaches. Very good, smoky, sweet, devilish sauce.

First off, this calls for WAAAYYYYY too much mustard. Even with only 3 Tbsp, it's too much. And I am a mustard fan, but WOW. Mustard and hot sauce serve 2 completely different flavor-purposes. Also, too much cumin. The first time I made this, it tasted like mustard-taco. However, I really wanted to make it work because I love hot sauce, so I made it again, and cut out the cumin altogether, and decreased the mustard down to the 3 tbsp I mentioned. Still too much mustard. However, I am determined to use this as a base for a good, fiery sauce. Next time I will use 1-2 tbsp of brown mustard, dijon or spicy like Guldens or Grey Poupon, instead of the regular yellow mustard I've used before. Also, I used 12-14 habaneros WITH seeds, and the heat was still less than tabasco or frank's. It was hotter in my belly than in my mouth. The flavor definitely gets better the longer it sits in the fridge. Also, I have to admit that it's great with food that normally calls for mustard, such as burgers. BTW I followed some other reviewers and used honey instead of molasses, cilantro instead of coriander, added garlic, and even tried simmering it for awhile (which did help a little). Don't get me wrong, it seems like it has serious potential, but I can't believe it has upheld a 5-star rating as written.

This is magnificant! I only used 10 habaneros (Just a wimp I guess.) but it is just the perfect hotness, with a wonderful flavor. Very quick and easy to make too.

Made this recipe last night and I love it!  It came out looking darker than the picture.  Spicy enough but not overkill. Although I do like things extra spicy so do be careful when testing/tasting it.  I took others advice and didn't use as much mustard as it called for.  I also added some of the seeds of the peppers to give it more spice.  I love the ease of the recipe and also appreciate that no cooking is needed. The other folks in the house don't always love it when you are cooking peppers as the fumes can be dangerous. Thank you for such a wonderful and flavorful recipe!!!  So far I've already used it for lunch on a veggie burger.  Yum.

Good hot sauce recipe. I think next time I would leave some of the seeds in to give this a bit more heat. I did a youtube video of making this. You can view it here: http://bit.ly/hAzO4s

The value of this recipe is the ingredient list - as with any recipe, you have to adjust quantities and ratios to your taste and your objectives.  I was going for a flavorful but super-hot sauce.  Used 2 dozen habaneros from my garden, seeds and all, 2 cans lite peaches, 2 Tbsp ea deli mustard, brown sugar, salt, and paprika, 1 Tbsp ea dark molasses, honey and black pepper, 1 cup white vinegar, 1 tsp liquid smoke, 1/2 tsp ea cumin, coriander, ginger and allspice, and a whole head of roasted garlic.  Put it all in a blender and liquefied, then simmered on stove for about 20 min to blend flavors.  Sealed in small jars and refrigerated.  My pepperhead friends and relatives have raved - used as is and as an addition to rubs and bastes for grilling meat.  My wife and daughter say I'm crazy.  I'm getting ready for a 2nd batch!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made a triple batch of this (36) peppers. I cooked everything together then put the hot cooked sauce into hot sterile pint and half pint jars to can. After the lids were screwed onto the jars they were put onto a rack in a dutch oven type pan with hot water already simmering. They were then processed for 20 minutes. This makes a great gift for the hot sauce lovers in your family.

Excellent hot sauce, I tweaked it just a tad. I used 14 habeneros, 8 seeded and 6 w/seeds. Cut mustard to 1/8c and replaced coriander with a hand full of fresh cilantro. The combination of sweetness and fire is outstanding, a very nice tasty blend. I served this over chilaquiles. Everyone complimented me on this sauce and wanted the recipe. I will definitely keep this recipe and make it often, my thanks to BOB!

I made this for my dad as a father's day present. I put it in small mason jars. This makes a good amount. I've got plenty of sauce for the both of us. Honestly though, this might be the best hot sauce I've ever had. The taste is unlike anything I've had before. Forget about what others said about there being too much yellow mustard. It's really not that noticeable. I used 12 seeded habaneros it surprisingly was not nearly as hot as I thought it would be. The can of peaches adds a great sweetness to it that allows your taste buds to notice the sweetness of the sauce first, and the heat of the habaneros after. This is absolutely perfect for burritos. I've been using it as my go to sauce for Chipotle burritos instead of the smoked tabasco. I'll most likely be making this sauce again when it runs out.

Once a year I process a large case of Habanero Peppers and throughout the year create sauces and spreads using the hot peppers.  Some people have asked how long the sauces will last.  They last forever if you jar them properly.  You can make hundreds of delicious sauces with an array of ingrdients and use them on all kinds of meats and in salsas.

I've tried *lots* of habanero sauce recipes and this is the best sauce I've ever had.  I looked for a long time for something that would approximate the Tabasco brand habanero sauce.  Although this sauce is not a perfect match, it comes pretty close.  I've been making it for years with half the mustard and I use apple cider vinegar instead of white. I've also been using red habs the last couple of years - a bit hotter than the orange ones.  Speaking of hot, I usually use around 18 seeded peppers instead of 12.  I've experimented with different canned fruits but always come back to the peach. Pro-tip: Don't use canned pineapple; it clogs the bottle orifice. Mangos, oranges, mixed fruit tends to oversweeten.  It's perfect with the peaches. Also made some and left the seeds in (pulled the stems out and threw the whole peppers in the blender). That was my "private reserve" batch which was pretty potent... almost too much.

It goes good on just about everything.  There is very little I don't put this on.  I can it regularly and probably have about 24 pints in storage right now. Just use a hot water bath canner and boil pint jars for 30-40 minutes.  I opened one the other day that was almost two years old and it tasted great. I've given bottles of this as Christmas gifts and it's quite popular.

Take some boneless cut chicken pieces, flour up and deep fry, then coat them in this sauce. Put a little blue cheese on the side and watch the feeding frenzy begin.

Spice mix is OVERWHELMING! Trust me on this, use 1/4 of the cumin they recommend or eliminate it all together. Cumin is the dominate flavor of this sauce. I just dipped a knife into the sauce after letting it sit all night. All I taste is sweet, spicy  cumin. A good recipe will marry flavors without one overpowering the other. I used ghost chilies (Naga Morich) peppers in my recipe. I only had to use 3 of them and MAN, IS IT HOT! They also taste better than habanero peppers do.  I also used 1/2 of the mustard recommended based on others reviews. If it wasn't for the cumin it might be palatable. I recommend making a batch without the spice mix. Pour a little into a bowl and add the spices one by one. That way you can experiment with flavor profiles without ruining the entire dish. I will try this again and take my own advice in the process, but as for now this recipe gets 1 star from me.

Delivers a super kick without being too overpowering. It tastes best after it has had about a week in the fridge to let the flavors blend.  I used canned mangoes in light syrup instead of peaches. I also split the 1/2 cup of molasses into 1/4 cup of honey and 1/4 cup of molasses. Other users had said the mustard flavor was too strong, so I cut that in half (to 1/4 cup) as well. Finally, I added 2 teaspoons of garlic powder (I didn't have any fresh garlic for roasting).  Will definitely make this again next year! But, I'll use thicker gloves. I felt the heat through the flimsy ones I wore this time...

Followed the recipe exactly and was very impressed.  This sauce has a wonderful complexity and balance.  Yes, it is hot, but not insanely hot. I had a bumper crop of habaneros this year, and was looking for a good sauce recipe.  I am so glad I tried this one first. I doubled the recipe, canned in 1/2 pint jars and gave much of it away as Christmas presents.  The biggest complaint I heard was, why didn't you make more? I am making this again!

We made this tonight. It was fantastic. I gave only 4 stars because it was not as hot as I had expected. Here are the changes we made to accommodate our tastes. We roasted 1 head of garlic and added the cloves to the blender. As other reviewers suggested we lessened the molasses, mustard, and brown sugar to 1/3 cup each. We also added 4 Long Peppers for some added flavor. Overall we love this sauce and we will continue to use this recipe.

I love it.  Used habaneros from our garden, and our own T & A Farms Raw, Local Honey--which is our business in LA--and lowered the mustard amount.  It was great.  Vinegar, salt, and sugar are meant to balance each other out.  Would use dry mustard next time.  No offense, but some of these reviews change the recipe so much, the review reads like a review of their own creation. :-)

You can put this on pretty much anything and it tastes good. After I made it I had to make some sweet potato fries just so that I had something to put it on because it is so good. I made it for my brother in law for Christmas and I have had multiple people asking for it now. My husband is begging me to make another batch which I will do, but I plan on tripling it. Also, I will be reducing the amount of peppers but just cutting the tops off and leaving the seeds in because it was such a pain in the tush to de-seed them and even through gloves this was burning me. The less contact the better.

Outstanding.  I've been making and consuming this by the quart, after a late season harvest of habaneros.  I left out the molasses, added some more peaches and a handful of small fire cracker hot peppers, as well as a garlic clove, a teaspoon of dried garlic flakes, a tablespoon of catsup and a smidge of maple syrup.  Unbelievable stuff.

This tasted like a nice mix between barbecue sauce and hot sauce. I couldn't find any Habaneros (out of season) so 15 jalapenos were used. Not as hot as I wanted but very good. I also used less mustard and some liquid smoke. I'll make it again when Habaneros show up again.    ----------------------------------------------------------------**Second try with Habs this time. 14 habs, all with seeds (I like the heat). Also, used half honey and half molasses with a touch of maple syrup (Canadian twist I guess) and lemon juice. Amazing sauce and besides delicious, its hot and complex.   Jarred into 125ml portions ready for eating or giving. It's too hot to have larger portions than that. My favorite All Recipes find. Thanks Bob.

This sauce is great marinade for chicken and pork. It is a fantastic use of habaneros. I give bottles of this to my friends and they rave about it. I am making 4 batches of it today because I picked the rest of my peppers last night before our first frost.

I used 1/3 cup honey mustard instead of yellow mustard, 1/2 cup honey instead of molasses, a mix of pineapple and papaya in passion fruit juice instead of peaches, 1.5 tbsp paprika and 1.5 tbsp black pepper.  Used about half of the juice/syrup from the fruit.  Only cut off the stem from the habaneros and added a clove a garlic and some lemon juice.

Everyone who has tried it loves it, I don't think it is hot enough, but it is good enough to go on almost everything.  Going to try another batch with some spicy mustard and less honey and a bit more salt and increase the number of habaneros to 15, I think.

I made this to make good use of the habanero peppers from the garden.  I added 1/2 papaya and a mango to the mix and it came out great.  I also added a good amount of Garlic and some cilantro.  While it is very hot, the sweetness makes it my new fav.  Highly recommended.  All of my friends are begging for more!

An awesome hot sauce recipe! I cooked it to reduce the heat from the habaneros and got a  BBQ'esque (new word?) hot sauce! A big hit with the kids I cook for! Just remember to wear gloves! WoOhOo!

Complex and full of flavor. You won't go to store shelves for sauces anymore. I like using 1/4 C mustard and 20-25 jabs...with seeds... a few Fresnos...GREAT recipe. Friends request bottles of it even though its SO hot...a testament to the flavor.

Made this recipe for the first time and tweaked it only slightly from the original. I backed the molasses down to 1/4c and added 1/3c of honey in its place. We've used this as a marinade on chicken and pork chops and it is outstanding. Great flavor and not too hot. Everyone that has tried it loves it. Great recipe.

I made hot sauce!  I made hot sauce!  I planted a few habanero plants just because I liked the idea.  Then the realization hit that I really should DO something with these lovely plants.  Enter Bob's recipe.  I followed it exactly except: 1) because other reviews said that it was too sweet the first time around, I still used peaches in heavy syrup, but drained and rinsed them.  2) I didn't use allspice just because I didn't have it.  The result was a VERY spicy but tasty sauce.  I can't wait to see how it mellows.

I made this yesterday and was afraid it would be too hot.  I included seeds and stems with half of the peppers.  It is so good!  I am addicted already.  I tried it on chicken and eggs and can't wait to try it on something else!  Thanks for this recipe!

I have an overabundance of habaneros in my garden this year, and I was searching the web for a good hot sauce to make when I stumbled upon this one.  This by far beats any hot sauce I've ever made in the past!  I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical after reading the ingredient list, but with all the good reviews I decided to try it.  The flavors really come together nicely, though I took some of the other reviewers' advice and decreased the mustard down to 1/4 cup and left the seeds in about half the habaneros.  Very nice blend of sweet and hot!

THIS IS THE BEST RECIPE I HAVE FOUND YET!  I am an avid lover of hot sauce and speding 5-7 $ a bottle I searched for the best concoction I could find and I found it!!!! I followed recipe for the most part, I did use 12 habaneros *with seeds*, went light on the yellow mustard, and instead of using a whole can of peaches, I used half can of peaches and half can of mango in light syrup to add a little twist and sweetness. Fantastic, make sure you have canning jars on had to seal and preserve leftovers! MANY THANKS WILL MAKE THIS OVER AND OVER!!!!

My husband made this last year with leftover hot peppers, and he is still using the sauce.  I poured the sauce into muffin tins and froze, and then froze the "muffin-shaped" sauce together in a bag.  That way you take out what you can use at a time and it doesn't go bad.  Great flavor, not just heat.

Mmmmm This is some good stuff!  My hubby likes hot - hot sauce so this fits the bill.  My friend grows fresh Habanero and he will bring me a whole batch over, I make this and it stays great in the fridge.  When we want more of a chunky sauce, I make Pico De Gallo, pour some of this over it and let it marinate in the frige for a while.  It's great that way too!

Far too sweet and far too runny.  I tried a modified version of this recipe first, cutting back on the sweets (yellow mustard, brown sugar) by half and substituting the molasses for honey to keep the beautiful color of the habaneros.  The flavor was spicy hot but I wanted it to have some viscosity as well, so I tried it again thinking the molasses would thicken it enough which it didn't unfortunately.  It also darkened it way too much for my liking.  Will try again with honey, half the sweets, and less vinegar to keep it from getting too 'watery'

Perfect blend of sweet and spicy. I wasn't sure when I was making this if molasses and the peaches would work. IT WORKED!

Great recipe, despite 12 Habs not as hot as the title suggests. Works well plain, as a base for other salsas and mixed into sour cream as a dip.

The "miniature orange bell peppers" my husband thought he was growing turned out to be  habeneros (oops!).  Not wanting to waste them, I came across this recipe and thought "what the heck!".  Now I like a nice "bite" to my hot-sauce, but we're not fire-eaters so I made this sauce using only 5 peppers.  I used about a tablespoon of the mustard - I just didn't see the need to add 1/2 c. when there is already so much vinegar in the recipe, and prepared mustard tends to overpower flavors.  We also did not have coriander on hand, so that was also omitted.  I used 1/2 honey & 1/2 molasses so it wouldn't be so dark, as others have mentioned.  
The sauce is WONDERFUL - just sweet enough and just spicy enough with just enough heat for the wimps in this house, although I am sure it will heat up a little more once it sits.  The next time I make this sauce, I will use 1 tsp. of ground dry mustard instead of prepared, and I am considering adding red pepper flakes to add another layer of flavor.  THANKS!!

A very good start, but needs some tweaking.  Omit the brown sugar, it's entirely too sweet already w/ peaches and molasses.  Don't worry about using 10-12 habaneros, I used 5 and it was not nearly spicy enough.  Use Honey instead of molasses to keep the gold color instead of turning it brown.  Probably should dissolve the dry ingredients better in the liquid ingredients, maybe simmer in a pot first before putting in processor.  Also, it's a bit runny and could use a thickening agent like cornstarch.

My husband is a habanero fanatic and loved the flavor of this sauce. I use it as a salsa base. I simply pulse in a few tomatoes and a white onion to a small amount of the sauce. A little sauce goes a long way.

I love growing habaneros since they're beautiful with the wrinkled orange fruit - but then I never know what to do with them.  This hot sauce answers that question.  I made a double  batch with at least the recommended amount of hab's.  It was really spicy but mellowed with time.  Wonderful to had a smokey heat to chilis, bbq sauce, soups, chicken, or anything.  Will definitely be making more of this when the habanero harvest comes in next year!

I love habanero peppers and thought this would be great....and it is!! I made a few changes for my taste. I used light peaches, 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne, 1 teaspoon of minced onion, 1 teaspoon minced garlic, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup local honey, a few squirts of yellow mustard, hand full of carrots. I also used 15 habaneros with the seeds. put it all in the blender, once smooth I put in a pot and simmered it for 30 minutes. Let it cool and out in the fridge. I love this stuff, my neighbors are begging to buy it from me. It will last forever in the fridge. I like to mix it with mayo or sour cream for burgers and dips... Next time I'm using Ghost Peppers and habaneros. Great stuff...Thanks Bob

I rate this recipe 4 stars because I think it is a fantastic base for customizing your own sweet but sneaky hot condiment.  That being said, it's not nearly as hot as advertised and could use some refinement.  After a few iterations, I've managed to turn this base into my favorite hot sauce hands down over anything I have ever had store bought...and I've had a lot.  Here's what I did to make it work for what I like.

Pump up the heat:
1. Increased the number of habaneros to 25.

Reduce the sweet:
1. Dropped the peaches to an 8oz can w/ heavy syrup.
2. Dropped the molasses to 1/4 cup.

Manage the mustard:
1. Dropped the yellow mustard (french's) to 2 tbsp

Add some flesh:
1. Added one fire roasted, seeded and peeled Pablano pepper.
2. Added two fire roasted and seeded Serrano peppers.

After these changes I really like what I've come up with.  It's a hotter, yet still sweet version with a little more thickness.  I may add some onion next time I do this to add a little more chunk and complexity.

Really good! I used 16 peppers 5 with seeds, Half the mustard, half the molasses and added a dash of liquid smoke like some people sugested. I took a cup of this and added it to a 12oz jar of peach preserves to use for a marinade for chicken for Fathers day BBQ. I'm also thinking of mixing some with cream cheese for a dip...........UPDATE, Just made the best dip ever with this. I used 2 8oz pkgs of cream cheese, 1 cup mayo, 2 4 oz cans of chillie peppers 1 hot 1 mild, 1 cup chedar cheese about 1/4 cup of this hot sauce mixed it all together put it in a 8 x 8 glass pan toped with a little panko bread crumbs and baked for 30 min at 350. AWESOME!!! Going to the store tomorrow to buy some canning jars so I can make a triple batch of this......the batch I made today is 2/3 gone already.

This was used as a chicken marinade (with rave reviews), though I tweaked the recipe a bit. As per the suggestion of other reviewers, I cut both the mustard and molasses to 1/4 cup, and I used peaches in lite syrup because it's what I had on hand. I also added about 6 cloves of roasted garlic. Cumin comes to the front here, but used as a marinade the flavors meld and it makes for a heavenly barbeque experience. Just reserve some sauce for basting- makes about 2 and a half pints.

I should mention that using it as a marinade cuts down on the heat considerably, to the point that even the non-chileheads didn't really notice much of a burn until after finishing the chicken, so it couldn't hurt to throw a few more peppers in there if you like it hot.

Excellent sauce! I suggest NOT adding much of the canned peach syrup unless you want it pretty sweet. I add some of this to some mayo for a nice creamy and spicy dip.

Amazing. Aside from using peaches in light syrup and a tad less molasses then called for I followed the recipe exactly. Great flavor followed by fantastic heat. I've made this twice now, and it's become a new house staple.

Great recipie.  I used half a can of peaches and a handful of dried apricots.  Also used 1/4 of the mustard and used a combination of habanero, chili peppers and serano peppers from my garden.

This was really fabulous.  I used peaches in light syrup but kept everything else the same.  The depth of flavor and complexity was great.  Love, it, love it.  Definitely use gloves when chopping the habs!!!

I really enjoyed the flavor of this.  I think it is just the right hottness the way it is but my husband wanted hotter.  So I made a second batch and left half of the habanero peppers whole with seeds and all.  That kicks it up to where my husband likes it.  We put this on everything from eggs to burritos and even as a chicken wing sauce!!

My garden has nothing but Carribean reds in it, so I could not decide how many to put in. The red habenero variety seems 1.5 times hotter than its cousin. Used 6 Carribean reds and the recipe came out excellent. Put this over cream cheese and it will blow your mind. Thanks bob.

This was so good!  Didn't have yellow mustard, so I added some mustard powder instead, along with a few cloves of garlic.  I thought it was similar to a jerk sauce.  Just used some on fried chicken wings last night with rave reviews from the fiance and his son.  Will definately be using this recipe to deal with the pile of habaneros i got off my plant this year - and probably for years to come!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

yeowza!  my husband couldn't believe that I had made this -- it tasted even better than store-bought!  I followed advice and substituted 1 ts of powdered mustard for the 1/2 cup of prepared mustard, used honey instead of molasses, and didn't add the juice from the peaches -- I think it would have been too runny had I added it.  just wonderful, thanks so much!

This is awesome - we made it with all 12 habeneros both times.  The first time we de-seeded them all, and it had almost no heat but was still tasty.  The second time we de-seeded half, and it's perfect!  Spicy but still delicious.

This is an excellent recipe. I loved the flavor of cumin in the sauce. Tried it on chicken and beef, both excellent. It makes around 650ml.

Wow! This is an excellent recipe! I followed everything exactly, except for the molasses. I used some honey instead, due to not having any on hand. I cut the mustard down to 1/4 cup also. I would definitely recommend this to the HOT lovers, it is very hot with a nice flavor! Love it!

I got home and was all ready to make and no Mustard so I used a small can of tomato paste and I am so happy I did. I tasted it first you taste the sweet then BAM!!! The heat. So good. I halved the Molasses and used peaches in light syrup did not use the allspice cumin or coriander. Instead of the paprika I used the same amount of cayenne pepper. I could use the sauce right away it's that good but I am going to let it sit till tomorrow night so everything blends. Just for those who do not like mustard use tomato paste it is so good it gives it a red colour and it thickens it as well.

Wildly delicious!  Even though I followed some suggestions and reduced the mustard and salt.  And even though I used mango instead of peaches and apple cider vinegar instead distilled... I would have been lost as too where to begin to find such a fantastic combination of spices and therefor believe it deserves a 5 star!

This is a good sauce.  We made today with our fresh from the garden peppers.  We don't care for habanero peppers, so we used Devil's Tongue which are on par heat-level wise.  I drained the peaches and used apple cider vinegar.  I also omitted a few things based on other reviews...I didn't use the molasses or prepared mustard (I used about a teaspoon of powdered mustard), and I didn't use the cumin, coriander, or ginger.  And I used smoked paprika, and I also smoked my Devil's Tongue peppers for a bit.  While it's not exactly the same sauce, it's quite good, and this recipe was an excellent starting point.  Like others, my sauce turned out a bit darker, but the flavor is really good.

Changed the recipe a bit, including the use of Bourbon, (it's the new bacon, it makes everything better!), and I used mustard seed instead of mustard, and I skipped the allspice.

Too many spices give this otherwise delicious hot sauce a cheap taste. I recommend reducing them all by more than half (except for the salt and pepper).

This is great. I roasted my homegrown Caribbean red habaneros and followed the rest of the recipe to a T. It is outstanding! Next time, I won't roast the habaneros...don't think it's necessary! Awesome.

This was SO easy to make, with a large yield, for minimal cost.  I will never buy hot sauce again!  I used what I had on hand, so I ended up substituting peaches for my homemade canned pears, and I used half white vinegar and half balsamic vinegar.  It gave the sauce a dark, rich brownish-red colour, as well as a distinct smoky mesquite flavour.  Absolutely delicous, and the right amount of heat and flavour too!

I'm a hot sauce lover and this recipe is a definite keeper!  Based on all of the reviews I substituted 1/4 cup of honey for the molasses, reduced the yellow mustard to 1/4 cup, added 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke and 5 cloves of minced garlic.  I put it on eggs every morning.  Last night on jambalaya it was awesome.  It's got plenty of heat and the peach and smoke flavors really round out this recipe.

Just made it, with my home grown habaneros. Delicious, can't wait to try it on rice, and with fish or chicken. It is a versatile sauce.

Used 1/8 cup of mustard as others said very mustardy taste, it was the only change we made, everything else stayed the same. We decided after making this the cumin was to over powering will use half the amt. next time. And use 1/4 cup of mustard, 1/8 wasn't enough. Might even try liquid smoke as others suggested. It had nice flavor and heat but as we all try to adjust to our own taste buds after making it as stated. Will be making this again.

Followed the recipe.  They boys Loved the spice!  They said it wasn't as spicy as I was afraid it would be.  It certainly wasn't the pretty red color as in the picture, instead it's a dirty brown.  But I can deal with that.

I followed the recipe exactly as directed I used 12 Habaneros and it turned out great.  My favorite thing to do with this sauce is mix it with sour cream,  it makes for a great dip also goes well in any mexican dish.

Finally, the flavor I've been looking for ! I did  omit the cumin, thought I would leave it out and taste before I added it. It was so good without I stopped there. I also added honey instead of Mollasses, then after tasting I added a little mollases as well, also added 3 cloves of garlic and only used about a tablespoon of yellow mustard. I used 8 large habaneros, seeds and all !! Hot , but wonderful habanero flavor!!! Thanks Bob !!

Very good, but makes a lot, so if you use it just for cooking, I suggest making a little less than the whole recipe!

Awesome stuff, and great way to use a full harvest of habaneros!  This made several jars of hot sauce that we are still using, and my husband absolutly loves it - even 'paints' his sandwiches with it because it is so good.

Hi, We used this recipe to utilise our (enormous) harvest of Habanero peppers, two years ago. This sauce is still live and kicking!  I recommend it to anybody who grows Habanero peppers, and loves hot sauce!  It works great as a steak sauce, and marinade, too.   I have recently used it in my Chicken Liver Pate recipe, and let me tell you it was a single tablespoon, that made all the difference!  Try it.

A very very good hotsauce. It has a great flavour, nice and spicy. I only used half the habaneros, making it less hot so i can eat it as well. Will make a batch like this again and another batch with the full amount of habaneros next time for my husband, who likes it a lot hotter. It also makes a great marinade for chicken or pork. Good stuff!!!

Fantastic recipe!  I was looking to use up my large crop of Serranos, so I used a small bowlful of them instead of the habaneros.  I cut the mustard in half.  I was out of paprika, and I didn't have any peaches, so I used chili powder and pineapple instead.  It worked out perfectly, and one of my coworkers is addicted!  This second time around I'm using the habaneros, and it's even better.

I tried the recipe without any changes and thought it was "the Best!"  I will probably also make a half-strength version so others who prefer "medium" hot sauces can enjoy its wonderful flavor also.

This is FANTASTIC!  I have a few habenero plants that were putting out way more than I could use, so this is my go-to recipe for using them up!  Friends and family both have requested bottles of this for Christmas.  Make it sweeter or hotter/spicier - the possibilities are endless with this!  Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe!

I thought this was excellent although it is sweet enough not to go great on all the foods I like to put hot sauce on..... I did cut down on the mustard and added a few cloves of raw garlic.  I will halve the sugar and maybe drain the peaches next time I make this and see.....

Coming from Buffalo, New York to the eastern shore of Maryland, I had a difficult time trying to find a hot sauce comparable to some of those used in Buffalo. This one is a one-of-a-kind recipe and I now make it in double batches. My friends and family love it and seems we never have enough. I am giving it as Christmas gifts this year and I am sure everyone will be pleased!

Fantastic! I did reduce the habaneros to 2 peppers for 32 servings. The sauce flavor compliments beef and pork very well.

We made two batches of this hot sauce, one with no seeds and one with the seeds from all peppers from both batches.  The seedless batch is noticeably sweet. I notice the sweetness before the heat hits.  We used the peaches in light syrup for that batch. The batch with the seeds tastes very much like a BBQ sauce with a swift punch of heat to the tongue, and there is also some sweetness to it, but the sweetness doesn't have authority over the heat.  It's like a lurking accomplice.  We used peaches in heavy syrup for the hotter batch.  Each batch made 25 ounces, or five 5-ounce bottles.

For each batch, we only used 6 habaneros, and that was plenty hot for us both.  For the sweeter batch, we used Spanish paprika from Penzey's.  For the hotter batch, we used Hungarian paprika from Penzey's.  Also, for each batch we used just one tablespoon of Trader Joe's brown mustard instead of the half cup.

I have made this a number of times.  Absolutely  awesome sauce, friends and family ask for bottles when i make this.  I have made a few changes to this recipe.  I use 28 ounce can of peaches, but triple the recipe.  I usually use 45 habaneros, 9 Serranos, and 9 jalapenos.  all are diced with the seeds intact.  we love the heat.  I substitute cider vinegar and smoked paprika.  lastly, i use 8 oz of sun dried tomatoes.  

place everything in stock pot over medium heat, slowly bring to a boil.  I will cook this for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Using a immersion blender, everything is blended until the sauce is smooth.  Once the sauce cools to 150 degrees, i bottle it in new, clean plastic bottles, immediately sealing with lids and use shrink bands for ultimate protection  I purchase bottles from www.sks-bottle.com.  Huge selection and fast shipping

SUPER sweet. I made 3 batches. First batch was exactly as written. (Except I used canned peaches in LIGHT syrup for all 3 batches, instead of heavy syrup as written)
Very spicy, but way to sweet. Second batch I substituted honey for the molasses, and it was still too sweet. 
Third batch I omitted the molasses and honey, making the sweetness only come from the brown sugar. It was better, but still too sweet for my liking. It's a good sauce maybe for the grill, as a marinade, but not slathered on a burrito like I had hoped.

I have made this multiple times, and have begun altering it to make it into an amazing BBQ sauce (great for pork and chicken).  Try adding some honey and/or pineapple to the blend for a sweeter, thicker sauce.  Bob, ya did good work here!

I made this using 12 unseeded habaneros, and 3tblsp of mustard. I also only used a 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and 1/4 cup of honey instead of molasses. I thought it had great flavor, but a little sweet for my liking as a hot sauce. I used it as a marinade instead. It made some of the tastiest pork I've had. Will definitely make again.

I followed some of the suggested tips.  Just a little mustard, used smoked sea salt, added garlic and cooked half of it into wing sauce.  Delicious!

I made this using only 5 habaneros, personal preference. After blending, I boiled for 20 minutes and canned in ball jars as I wasn't sure of the shelf life of this recipe. We decided to call it our spicy bbq sauce. Wish it would have a thicker consistency but the flavor was on point and I can see using it as marinade also. I did NOT find that the mustard was overpowering in any way whatsoever.

Just made this recipe for the first time today. I think the next time I will use a light colored h ok ney (as others have suggested) to keep the color a brighter orange. I used a dozen habenero peppers, as well as 3or 4 cayenne peppers seeds and all. I also added a little more brown sugar and a  of Capital Morgan to sweeten it up a little.  It has been in the frodge for about 4 hours and I just tried a little...
SPOT ON! Exactly what I was hoping for! I will definitely make this again SOON!

Made this for my husband.  He said it was a little sweeter than it was hot, but he still uses it on more or less everything he can.  I took the star off for the sweetness.

I used the I core of the recipe.  Instead of pears I used caned mango's in light syrup.  It just sounded inviting the mango habanero mixture, and I was right! I used 1/3 cup of molasses instead of 1/2.  Also because I used light syrup which is more liquid'y than thick syrup, I only used 1/2 cup of vinegar.  After pureeing the mixture I simmered it in a pot for about ten minutes, let cool, then put in a jar over night.  Love It!!  I will try it with pears next time and see how that goes, I am very confident it is great too.

Great starting point!  First time I made it I followed the directions to the letter and is came out great.  I have since tinkered with it adding lots of roasted garlic.  I have also changed out the peaches, using canned necterines and fresh pears (my favorite)as well as substuting Honey for the Molasses.

With the 12 Habenaros I dont think the heat is any more intense then Tobasco, but the Flavor leaves store bought stuff in the dust.

AMAZING!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! I made 5 batches of this recipe .. I got 10 pints of REALLY good sauce! Based on others reviews, I bought the peaches in lite syrup & our neighbor had just given us fresh honey, so I used honey instead of molasses. And I had SO many habaneros, that I used 24 per batch vs the 12 it called for!! I canned this (water bath process) for 20 minutes based off of others reviews. My husband eats it like salsa & chips - He loves anything hot & spicy!! Last night for dinner, I marinated a bag of chicken wings with a jar of the sauce, then grilled them outside on the grill. My husband cooked half of them just as was after marinated & half he basted with more sauce while he grilled them. We have 4 kids (7,5,3&1) The whole family LOVED them!! The ones that were just marinated only were delicious! And the ones that were marinated + basted were perfectly spicy!! I am so in love with this sauce!! I wish now, I would have made 10 batches instead of doubling the peppers & only making 5 .. it is SO good! And it is SO easy to prepare!! 

PS I used French's yellow mustard - just the amount it calls for. Not sure why some are saying the mustard is too strong?! The sauce is amazing!! I am thinking that I could have used ANY kind of peaches & been fine, Next year I'll test to find out!

We love this sauce. We grow our own habaneros and this an excellent recipe to use them in. Our favorite way to use it is as a marinade/baste for grilled chicken breast. It adds a sweet, spicy flavor. Delicious!!

This recipe is great, but we did alter it some. We grilled the habaneros, cut the amount of salt, and pepper in half, and used apple cider vinegar instead. All in all, great recipe!!

It's good, but it's not liquid fire.  Next time I'm putting the seeds in because this came out to about a medium hot level and that's with 15 habaneros and 12 jalapenos.

I had a combo of habenero, jalapeno, and chile peppers so that's what I used for the peppers. I also canned some spiced peaches in syrup and used those, so I omitted the spices at the very end of the recipe. I LOVE trying different kinds of hot sauce but have a limited selection in my neck of the woods and never thought of making one until I came across this recipe. Glad I found it. Thanks!

I like xtreem hot and a little sweet. I used 30 peppers no molasses,
no brown sugar, a kids snack size of mandarin oranges cuz thats what I had, 1/4 C honey, 1/8 C mustard, and followed the rest. Very good. Its hard to find habanero extract sauces in Minnesota so this wull do it for me. Ill put this on everything. Caution my wife and kids wont touch this becuz they know how I like heat, but it is not too xtreem. Oh and I like other reviews cut the salt almost in half. Awesome!!

Great sweet, peppery taste.  Black pepper provides different character than most hot sauces.  Makes an excellent wing sauce.  I prepared with reduced mustard (1/4 cup).  I would characterize this as a 7+ out of 10 on a heat scale.  I prepared with 15 habaneros.  Mellows significantly after it sits overnight.

Like others have said, this is a great sauce, but I thought the mustard overpowered the rest of it, and it wasn't hot enough. I started by eliminating the mustard and raising the peppers up to 24 on my second batch, but not hot enough! I got the peppers right at 15 but just cut the stems off an threw them in whole. Now that is hot and it has flavor. I also left out the coriander as I could not find any.

Great sauce! I didn't have 12 but i just left the seeds in what i had...like 6-7...also didn't have any canned peaches so I defrosted some unsweetened frozen peaches and just upped the sugar to 1 C. left out the mustard, didn't appeal to our tastes. Thickened it up a bit with some cornstarch over some heat and bam great sauce to add heat to whatever.

I've made this a few times now because it's just that good.  Instead of canned peaches, I use fresh and add simple syrup or honey, and I sometimes substitute honey + brown sugar for molasses.  I use it in place of taco "seasoning" with chicken or beef.

Fantastic! The sweetness really tempers the spice without taking it away. This is a great way to use up habeneros from a prolific pepper plant :) Save some small glass jars and bottle it up as presents to give away. I'm getting ready to make my second batch within a month!

This is excellent. I would like it to be a little more orange, but the flavors are so complex, sweet, then smoky then BAM hot! I did add a couple garlic cloves, reduced the mustard to 1/4c and cooked on the stove for about 10 minutes. I also added the liquid smoke. I will reduce the salt some next time, it's a bit salty, but wonderful over all!

Awesome! Only change (very minor) used sorghum instead of molasses. A keeper! Great on eggs, carib dishes, cajun, mexican...I could go on.

Great way to use up habaneros! My peppers were green so my sauce was more of a bbq sauce color, but it sure was HOT! Very good on wings! Next time I think I'll tone it down a little, but it had a great sweet and spicy flavor!

This is an outstanding hot sauce on its own. As an alternatinve I substituted King syrup for the molasses and 5 BHUT JOLOKIAS  aka ghost chiles for the habaneros. This came out just slightly hotter than the habanero version. We use this on everything from chicken  and pork to fish. It works good as a rub for ribs before smoking.

I have made this recipe three times now and everyone loves it.  I changed it a little by using ketchup instead of mustard.  I also used three cloves of garlic and a dash of liquid smoke.  It is really good on steaks and burgers.  Excellent recipe!

This stuff is great for almost any sauce that you'd like to spice up.  I fire-roast the peppers and bring the whole thing to a boil for about 5-10 minutes before I jar it for friends.

Great hot sauce.  I did follow the suggestion of others and reduced the amount of mustard by half.  with my home grown habaneros the sauce was plenty hot.  They have been heated by 100+ temperatures the past few weeks.

I have made this sauce dozens of times, and my husband LOVES it. I tweaked the molasses to 1/4c, yellow mustard to 1/8, and only 1 tsp. of salt. It is an all time favorite!

I made this for the first time the other day and used smoked paprika instead of regular and man was it good.  It adds just the right amount of smoky flavor.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, everyone that has tried it, loves it!!

Great Sauce.  Made a few changes and tweaked to my taste. Didn’t use molasses but substituted agave nectar. I also added 8oz of pineapples.  Can’t wait to let it sit and meld together and then taste it again.  Also put 2 ghost peppers in too.  Great color and consistency.

The peppers were green and I used 16. Nice zing. This year's peppers are starting to turn color and are more mature. I am planning on using 20 in my next batch of sauce.

How is this 5 stars? Its thick and goopey, grainy and all u taste is cumin! Way too much molasses, way too much mustard, way too much cumin. Not enough water and too many seasonings, it leaves a grit on your teeth. I dont know what this sauce would ever be used for. The sauce looks NOTHING like the picture so i at first thought i used the wrong amount, but i checked six times! The recipe is wrong. It turned out black. It tastes like a really  taco bell sauce with too much cumin dumped in to a point its gritty. Do not make unless the recipe is updated to the correct amounts.

This was REALLY good, especially as a wing sauce. I took a lot of reviews into mind and decided to use half the mustard, but use brown mustard (horseradish actually). I also replaced the molasses with honey and didn't use any brown sugar. Lastly, I used 12 habanero peppers WITH the seeds.  I like heat, and these came out hot, but not over kill where you can't stand it. Highly suggested to try.

Excellent hot sauce! 
However in searching for a habanero hot sauce recipe, I did note that many of them included garlic, so I decided to added 4 cloves to this recipe too.  Other than that, I made it exactly the way it was presented. 
My son (something of a hot sauce 'expert') gave it rave reviews.

I generally make it with  twelve haberneros and it is plenty hot , somewhat sweet as would be expected with the peaches, molasses and brown sugar. My neighbor- who makes his own  salsa-hot sauce and has had some commercial success  with it, is absolutely sold on this recipe .  I

I've also experimented with " Liquid Ghost." and "Liquid Reaper with the base ingredients plus the obvious substitutions.   The stuff made with ten carolina reapers  is Very Good! but hot enough to blister paint  and kill all the shrubbery for blocks around.. The peppers themselves tend to dominate the other ingredients .  It  is reasonably safe if you only use a  few drops.

After reading all the wonderful reviews of this sause I decided to take a shot at it.  Like all the others I read this recipe then threw it out the window and made my own, then came back to review it to let everyone know that even though the author thought it was great I thought they had it all wrong and should have done it my way instead.  Seriously I'm here to thank the author and make sure the other reviewers know they are welcome to add their own wonderful recipes for us all to improve.

Wow! What a great recipe! I only used a tablespoon of mustard, I didn't have all spice so I improvised with cinnamon and nutmeg, cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, used peaches in lite syrup, and I used raw honey instead of molasses, and it turned out beautiful deep orange and delicious for multi uses. I tried it with a tortilla chip and it was perfect heat with 12 habaneros. The sugar in this really cuts the heat down to a perfect taste. The sugar elements will make for a fantastic glaze on meats for baking or grilling. The sauce is going directly onto my tacos this week. I might add it to spice up a bloody mary and/or margarita too! Can't wait to hand out to my neighbors for the next get together!

I left out the mustard as many reviewers said to do.
I also seeded half the peppers and I wish I hadn't.  I would have liked it hotter.

This is an awesome sweet & hot sauce.  Very good flavor without burning your face off.  Kind of reminds me of the flavor of Buffalo Wild Wings' Mango Habanero, which is WAY too hot.

I simmered the sauce for about 20 minutes then strained out the seeds and pulp to give me just liquid (yield: 2 cups).

I will definitely make this again while habaneros are in season and can it so it keeps until I can send it out as Christmas gifts.

Edit:  I made another batch but this time didn't remove seeds from any of the peppers.  WhoooWEEEE it's hot!  But still has the great flavors.   The point is, vary the amount of heat just by seeding some or all of the habaneros.

I have some Carolina Reapers about to ripen.  Now that's a different story.

Here's a tip:  cook this sauce and add some cornstarch to thicken it.  Use it as an ice cream topping.  Incredible.

Pretty good stuff, but not killer.  I did make one change as I was concerned that it would be too hot for most.  I used 8 Habanero peppers instead of the called for 12.  Should have stuck with 12 as it is certainly not crazy hot.  Since I liked it but didn't love it... I went ahead and modified it:-)   Put it back in the blender and added a can of the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (6 oz. maybe?...in the Latin section..La Costena brand?).  Turned out to be worthwhile at it added some depth of flavor and is still not stupid hot.  All fun & games:-) Enjoyed the recipe...and heed the warning.  Wear gloves...protective eyewear as well.

This sauce is AWESOME. First time I made it , I was swayed by other reviews. It was still great. Every time since I follow the recipe (although I leave the seeds in, I like it HOT) and I get rave reviews from everyone who tries it! For Christmas I made a batch with some Ghost Peppers added, lets see how that turns out lol.

We read some reviews and we were glad we did. We reduced the habaneros to 7 instead of 12, it had its kick right away and they say that it does get hotter. We cut the molasses, brown sugar and mustard in half and used peaches in a light syrup. It gave us more than 1L worth of hot sauce.

Very good hot sauce. I cut the molasses and brown sugar in half. I made 2 batches and shared with coworkers. I used 12 scotch bonnet habaneros and think I will use more next batch to get even hotter. I didn't seed most of them also.

This is the first hot sauce I've ever made. Overall, I think it has a great flavor and plan to use to to make some pulled pork and maybe some grilled shrimp.
I followed one recommendation to use peaches in light sauce and only use 1/4 cup molasses instead (see Monica's review). I think that was the best option as it is sweet enough with just that. In the future I'd also cut back on the amount of cumin (maybe half as much?).
Overall, I'd make this recipe again!

This habanero sauce is VERY tasty!  I would give it 5 stars with these changes I made since I'm not a big fan of sweet sauces.  I used a can of peaches in their own juice and halved the molasses, brown sugar, and mustard.  I also added 5 cloves of garlic and cut down the salt to a Tbs.  The bomb!

I've been making this hot sauce for years and love it. 
My modifications. 1/4 cup of honey, 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Omit the mustard. I use apple cider vinegar instead of regular vinegar.  I use the peaches in heavy syrup. 
 I've used habanero and burning bush peppers. Both are delicious. 
Everybody I know who tries it, loves it! Make sure you wear gloves!

I have retired to Costa Rica and have a habanero bush that produces year round.  I decided to try this recipe but instead of the canned peaches I used fresh mango and fresh orange juice.  I reduced the mustard and it turned out great.  I have gone through half a bottle in about 4 days.  I even add a spoonful to ground beef before making hamburger patties.  Very flavorful and with a kick.  Great recipe for getting rid of my habaneros.  I look forward to trying this with pineapple.

I love this hot sauce! It's great on tacos and in burritos. Also: it's great for hot wing sauce! Just Bake 2.5 pounds of chicken wings for 30 min at 450f, mix 1/3 cups melted butter with 1/2 cup hot sauce, coat the wings with hot sauce in a bowl after cooking and voila! You have some AMAZING sweet and spicy wings! I highly recommend trying this.

Absolutely love this sauce. I use fresh peaches instead of canned because I just don't use a lot of store bought canned items. I also have started adding a few more habaneros to make it a little hotter.

I didn't have vinegar and was far too lazy to go get some so I used 1/2 cup of pickle juice and 1/2 cup of vinegar (HORRIBLE MISTAKE) and didn't use molasses so it's very liquidy, thinking I'm going to get some tomorrow and just add it in. 
1/2 cup of mustard is way to much and I even used French's Sweet Mustard. 
Used Chipolte Mango spice in it too, great idea. 
Thanks for the recipe mate!

I really loved the recipe! Based on a couple of reviews I read I made the sauce with 1/2 of the mustard and I left the seeds in the peppers. (I like it spicy) It came out perfect!

Some friends of mine have been begging me to make it again. Peppers picked and I'm starting a new batch today!

Thank you!

I read a few of the comments prior to making this sauce, I made a couple of changes, Instead of Habaneros, I used a mixture of Asian F1, white fatalii, rocotta, wildfire, and hungarian yellow chilis, I substituted the molasses for a 50/50 mix of maple syrup and golden syrup. I also only added one large heaped spoonful of english mustard. 
I also simmered it for ten minutes, as I want it to last longer.
The resulting sauce was  absolutely incredible, fruity, spicy  and extremely hot, it bears a vague resemblance to tobasco, but has a far superior flavour.
I will definitely make this one again

Beautiful sauce.  I happened to use 6 habaneros, 4 serranos, and a jalapeno because that's what I had on hand..  Great flavor.  Not too hot with the peppers I used.  I suggest using a little less vinegar to thicken up the sauce a bit.

I made this recipe twice. First time forgot to add mustard. With the mustard is good but without it is outstanding!!! It has a wonderful sweet and very spicy taste. Great on sandwiches, in eggs or in a Caesar. Will be making more this year.

I've made this sauce half a dozen times. Every time with a slight twist and Every time with great success. We like heat so we leave the seeds in. Cut the mustard and use better mustard than plain yellow.

This was very good.  My husband was a little nervous using that many habanero peppers, but was pleasantly surprised.  It was hot, but not ridiculous.  We really liked the addition of the peaches.  My husband doesn't like cloves so we didn't add the allspice; however we did add cinnamon and nutmeg (the other ingredients that would be in allspice).  Didn't think there was too much mustard as others have reviewed.  The  next time we make, as there will be a next time, we will cut back on the molasses - a little too sweet for us - just a personal preference.

Had to substitute out the dark molasses with honey, and I added a few mandarin oranges in place of a couple pear slices just to be unique. I read the reviews saying the mustard was a bit overpowering so I used a little under the 1/2 cup recommended. Also I used 17 habaneros since I like my food spicy. Turned out fantastic, nice sweet taste then a fast kick from the habaneros. Will definitely make this again.

This was phenomenal!  My fiance planted a habanero  plant & then informed me he had no idea what to do with all the habanero's that had ripened. Step in Allrecipes.com ...  I wanted a hot sauce worthy of his taste buds & already have a ton of spices in my cabinet so this was a great contender.  Based on other reviews, I made the following changes - I used 6 seeded & 6 de-seeded peppers, a 1/2 c molasses & 1/2 c honey (to keep some of the color - dark red, almost brown).  I didn't have  1/2 c yellow mustard so I used about 2 T & this seemed a good amount anyway. I only had peaches in light syrup & this worked just fine for me.  I also used slightly less cumin than 1 T and it was very prominent flavor so next time (next weekend since I'll have 40 habaneros by then) I'll use 1/2 T. Instead of throwing everything in the food processor and then the jars, I cooked it for 12 minutes on the stove to marry the flavors together.   Also, I'd like to note that this was enough for 4 & 1/2 8oz jars for canning and after tasting the smallest bit on the tip of my tongue, I could still taste the heat 45 minutes later .....  it was that HOT.  I may tone it down to 8 to 10 habaneros for a milder hot sauce (personal preference) or eliminate the seeds all together.  
Thanks for submitting Bob!!!!

Awesome hot sauce! We like it really hot so we leave the seeds in 3/4 of the peppers.  I use dark brown sugar, replace the molasses with honey, and omit the coriander. Comes out awesome every time!

This was fabulous - the first batch is almost gone and everyone in my family is loving it!  I doubled the recipe right away, and added a few more peaches to balance the hot/sweet.  Made a Pork picnic roast on grill after marinating for fathers day. Everyone loved it!

this is a great recipe to modify! i opted for a few cubes of frozen pineapple instead of canned peaches. i also added some saucy susan instead of the peach syrup. had no molasses, so i whipped up a crazy alternative: some agave syrup, balsamic, a few squirts of ketchup and some vinegar from a hot cherry peppers jar. i also used apple cider vinegar instead of white, and threw in a few lemon and lime slices, rind and all. i added some curry, chili and cayenne powder to the mix as well as a few dashes of Dave's Insanity Sauce and Frank's Red Hot to really crank it up. for the mustard i used a blend of Grey Poupon and CaJohn's Jolokia 10. You would think the heat level would be incendiary, but I used frozen habs and bonnets, whose heat diminishes over time. fresh chocolate habs from the market would have made a heck of a difference. either way, a great recipe to go crazy over and personalize. nice share!

I took other folks advice and I cut back on the mustard and the used honey instead of molasses. Great sauce. I can't stop eating it. Will be making again.

This recipe is a base for your own... still awesome! After trying this the first time I cut the mustard, cumin, allspice and coriander out completely! Reduced the brown sugar and molasses to 1/4 cup, vinegar to 1/2 cup and also used the smaller size of the canned peaches in light syrup. Instead of table salt, I use kosher salt to bring the flavor out in the peppers and about 20-25 caribbean hot peppers which are 525,000 scoville units (habaneros are 300,00) mixed with serrano peppers which I leave the seeds in. I do add approx 1 tbsp red chilli pepper powder and real ginger instead of ground ginger (it makes a difference in flavor)

Excellent flavor, but next time I will use more peppers(I used 14). Added one Tbl of Cayenne pepper, used 1/2 cinammon and nutmeg instead of allspice, brown mustard instead of yellow and added some worcesteshire sauce at the end. More peppers in the garden so I may make a second batch for friends!

This was awesome. The only thing I changed was the molasses(dont like) and substituted with honey. I am sure it would be good with molasses too. Just a pref. I have so much I am going to freeze most of it for other stuff. I am going to try with with wings and so many other things. I have fresh habaneros in the garden so I am going to have this all year round. Maybe even share with people at work. Thanks for the recipe. Its in my box.

I absolutely adore hot sauce and I now eat this on pretty much everything. It does come out a little on the sweet side if you follow the recipe exactly, but the flavor is awesome, and it definitely has a bite to it! **OMG, DO NOT SKIP THE GLOVES!!!** lol

This recipe is just the right balance of sweet and hot. I would leave 1/2 of the habanero seeds in next time and add a bit more vinegar. It was just a tad on the sweet side for me.

Wonderful...I made it with the honey and with the molassas...love it!

Best of all, friends found it so good they ate a whole container last Thanksgiving. I have several more in the freeze...keeps well. Probabley the best surprise was how well it mixed with French's Yellow Mustard. I mixed 1-part sauce with 3-part mustard and tada!!! Some of the best spicey mustard I have ever had.

Thanks Bob for this great taste!

Absolutely love this sauce.  I have made it twice, the first time I used honey instead of molasses, 6 habaneros and 6 jalapenos.  I recommend using molasses as it gives it a more complex flavor.  If you like more heat, do not scrape out the seeds.  First time it wasn't hot enough for us.  I also used less brown sugar and mustard the second time around and it was delicious.  I added a 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke based on other comments.  I will make this again and again, thanks for the great sauce!

Great recipe. changed the molasses to honey(sweeter and left the color lighter.) i did make this with habanero and it was great as a hot sauce. afterwards (when my plant had good peppers) i substituted the habanero peppers with (6 not 12) Ghost peppers (bhut jolokia) resulting in a hot sauce with great flavors but even more heat!

Amazing hot sauce with a fruity finish! I used up a pile of my Peach Habaneros in this and although it looks much browner than the pic, it's the best sauce I've ever tasted!

This sauce is DELICIOUS! I've been making this every year for a few years and we really LOVE the sweet/hot combination. This year I mixed habanero, jalapeno and red chili peppers, and it was excellent. I do omit the corriander because I never have any on hand, and this year I omitted the cumin and it was still fantastic. I also add 3-4 garlic cloves for extra falvor. Everyone RAVES over this sauce. We put it on everything from pork chops to burgers to rice-YUM! Thanks for posting. :)

I made this sauce yesterday for are hog roast and it was a big hit. I used 14 habaneros and honey instead of the molasses it retained its bright orange color. Along with the canned peaches we used one fresh peach. It is sweet but everybody liked the heat at the end. Thanks

Terrific sauce! Goes well with chicken. The only thing I did differently is I didn't seed the habaneros. Second time I made it I added a tablespoon of chipotle powder for some extra heat and smokey taste. Keeping this one in my recipe box!

Tastes amazing!  I left the seeds in the habaneros though.  I also took the advice of others and halved the mustard.  I'm already thinking of a couple of variations...a little more brown sugar & molasses to make it more like a bbq sauce...or adding garlic cloves and a little liquid smoke to marinate jerky.    As a warning to those using a food processor: watch out for the liquid level.  Some of it dripped through the bottom.

If I could give this recipes more stars I would. The sauce has the right amount of spice without the constant burn on your tongue. I was fortunate in getting a full crop of habaneros from my girlfriend who accidentally planted these peppers and who does not like spice! In sharing my good fortune with coworkers they also think the sauce is FANTASTIC. I am now 'hording' the rest of the my jars sauce until next seasons crop. I froze my batches and they are still as wonderful as when first making them. I have used the sauce as a bbq sauce for grilled chicken and hot wings. Some coworkers have used the sauce as a dipping sauce for their breaded chicken wings and loved it!

Oh lord Bob!  This is some good sauce.  I followed the recipe except for reducing the mustard slightly and reduced the Habaneros to 9 fresh from the garden.  Very, very good sauce!  Can't wait to try this on some grub.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is WONDERFUL!!! I just poured it on left over fish. I used corn syrup since I didn't have molasses, cider vinegar since I didn't have regular and I used a mild honey mustard dipping sauce since there were so many comments about the mustard. This really cut back on the stong mustard taste. I also used 14 peppers, 4 of which I left seeded. VERY SPICY with the addition.I only wish I would have added garlic like some have suggested.

I sent a sampling of this sauce to fellow college mates and to my dad's boss at Dupont.  They all loved it.  I like it, but then again I'm not too crazy about entirely destroying my taste buds.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It's great!

This was definitely the hottest hot sauce I've made. It got the nose running! I followed the other suggestions and didn't put in the mustard. Great for wings!

My family just loves this sauce.  I didn't add mustard and I think it tastes better without it.  Too much of a strong taste the first time I made it.  This is a keeper.  Thanks RB Miller for sharing

This is a great recipe and a great way to use up the bumper crop of habaneros I have this year.
