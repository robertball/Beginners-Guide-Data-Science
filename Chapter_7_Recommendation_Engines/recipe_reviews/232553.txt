This was really delicious but I'd use less beans the next time.  It was too much for the deep dish pie crust and we had spill over.  I used the beans with jalapenos which gave it a nice kick.

I used the basic recipe , but incorporated fresh ingredients for the tomatoes and chillies,  made my own refried beans and used turkey sausage with mexican spices.... if it was this good from pantry cooking... I've got to make trip to the grocery next time and try the real deal! Thanks so much for sharing!!!

This was so frickin good! My whole family loved it! I must say though, that this was way too much for only one pie crust. I would recommend using 2 pie crusts and instead of 2 cups of cheese each, use only 1 cup of cheese for each quiche. Again, this was awesome

My husband and I loved this! I chopped up an onion and 2 cloves garlic to fry with the Italian sausage I removed from its casing and fried. I put the two frozen pie crust shells in two pans, baked for ten minutes, then filled according to directions. On top, I added sliced grape tomatoes and green pepper. Baked according to directions. Yum!

We thought this was just o.k. Used hot chorizo so it had plenty of flavor. I think some type of casserole would have been a better use of the ingredients (minus the egg).

It was okay, but wouldn't make it again, as it''s pretty bland.  First, I should have known that a layer of refried beans spread over an unbaked pie  crust would leave the bottom of the quiche gummy, not flaky or crisp.  Not much of a kick of heat...  I would suggest adding  jalapenos or cayenne  to the custard and cut back eggs to four.

I used hot rotel tomatoes and slightly less refried beans, and I made it in a round casserole dish because I don't have a deep dish pie plate. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. It was amazing! Even my toddler loved it.

Absolutely wonderful recipe!  I also experienced spillover when preparing the dish.  Next time I'll either use less refried beans or a larger crust.

Edit: I made this again in May 2018. I made sure to use a deep dish crust this time. Still as delicious as the first time!

I had thawed some chorizo and wanted something different...had everything to make this and it was very good.  Definitely a quick and easy recipe that uses things I normally keep on hand, thanks!
