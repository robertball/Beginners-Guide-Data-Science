I wish I could give this recipe more stars! I've been using Tortillas I from this site and thought it was the best one I had found ... until this one came along. I love the fact that you don't have to use boiled water, and that you don't have to let it rest for 10 minutes. This was fast and easy to make. I halved the recipe and divided the dough in 8 golf-size balls and rolled out as thin as I could (about the width of a dime). It felt like I was rolling pizza dough instead. I lightly floured my rolling pin and surface when it was a bit sticky, and rolled from the center out, rotating the dough 90 degrees ever so often. I got smooth edges, but if the edges are jagged then too much lard/shortening was added. I cooked each tortilla for 10-20 seconds on the first side and a little less on the second size. The I wrapped them in a clean dishtowel and stored them in a shopping bag. THE BEST PART OF ABOUT THIS RECIPE IS THAT THE TORTILLAS ARE PLIABLE! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, LaDonna!

I wanted to make quesadillas, but didn't have tortillas, and didn't feel like running to the store for some.  I 1/2ed this recipe because I didn't need very many.  My husband LOVED them!!!  And I was wondering how he'd react, as he's very picky.  He thinks these really are so much better than store bought.  I did substitute shortening for lard, and used hot water.  The dough is nice and stretchy, and I could roll them very thin with a wooden roller.  So delicious.  I was surprised though, especially with my baking experience, that 1/2 the recipe made only 4, 8-10 inch tortillas.  I guess 2 cups of flour doesn't go far in this recipe, but there really aren't any other ingredients so I guess that's it.  So good though.  You won't regret using this one.

I've been trying to make tortillas since being taught by a Spanish family about 15 years ago - without a recipe.  They always turned out like thick roadmaps.  THESE DO NOT.  What I learned from reading reviews and my Spanish family lessons:  First of all, only use this recipe then...1.  Shortening works as a great substitute, lard is best  2.  Use your mixer with a dough hook if you have one.  3.  Should be smooth as a baby's hiney when done kneading, no stretch/tear marks when you form a ball with the whole recipe.  (Seriously.  Pat the ball like you're giving a love pat.  Should be the same.)  4.  Do let the 24 balls rest under a damp cloth if you can. (10-20 min) They will not stretch back and become thick  5.  Use light dusting of flour on your board and pin 6. VERY IMPORTANT:  pick up and turn 90 degrees every time you roll to get a round tortilla!  6.  Use a dry, extremely hot cast iron skillet.  7.  Roll to dime width for large thin wraps, quarter for thin tortillas  8.  Once cooked, stack wrapped in a damp towel or the 1st side cooked will stay crunchy.  9.  Refrigerate leftovers or they will mold in a couple of days.  10. I like to make ahead and re-heat in foil in the oven @ 350@.  HOPE THAT HELPS!  Thank you LaDonna for the perfect ratio of ingredients that should be so simple but it's not and only the Grandma's know!

This recipe turned out great! It was easy. I didn't have lard, shortening or even margarine so I used butter. The tortillas turned out fine, but I couldn't get them as thin as the ones you buy at the store they were a bit bready. I liked them like that. I made half the recipe and I did get 12 tortillas. I had left overs so the next morning I warmed them up and spread some butter and sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar over them. It was delicious with a cup of coffee. I will be making these again using shortening. Thanks for the recipe LaDonna!

This recipe is so simple and easy! I only made half the recipe and used vegetable shortening since I had no lard on hand.  Like another reviewer I also used hot water.  The dough was very easy to handle and roll very thin(although I've never really managed to roll out an actual circle, just oblongs-oh well!).  The dough is on the sticky side, so I was very generous with the flour while rolling out each tortilla, but this didn't affect the final result.  Best tortillas ever, including restaurants!  My husband is from Texas and is pretty  snotty about Tex-Mex food, and he could NOT believe how great these were, still talked about it the next day.  My 3-yr old daughter told me again and again how good they were.  So it's a keeper!  Thanks!

Yes, these are way better than the tortillas in a bag. However, if you separate them into 24 balls, like the recipes says, you get such small tortillas.

You must use HOT WATER!  It makes a big difference. I used 3 3/4 cups of flour, 2 tsp. of baking powder, 1 tsp. salt and 1/3 cup of Crisco Shortening.  Pulsed about 6 times on food processor, then added 1 1/3 cups of HOT WATER.  Pulsed till came to a nice ball.  Took out of processor and hand kneaded 5-6 times. Dough is soft and easy to handle and roll out.  Rested dough 10-15 minutes. Then made into 13 balls.  Rolled out and placed on med. high griddle. Cooked about 15  or so seconds, flipped to other side to cook for same amount of time. then flipped 1 more time. Placed cooked tortilla in paper toweled tortilla warmer. The tortillas came out soft, beautiful and delicious. I did not have to flour the rolling pin or the dough to roll out.  Perfect dough. This is my go to recipe. YOU CAN ALSO DEEP FRY INSTEAD FOR SOPAPILLAS. BUT BE SURE TO PRICK WITH FORK BEFORE ADDING TO HOT OIL IN FRYING PAN.  LET COOK FOR A FEW SECONDS, FLIP AND FRY UNTIL LIGHT GOLDEN BROWN. DRAIN ON PAPER TOWELS, AND IMMEDIATELY TOP WITH CINNAMON/SUGAR.  THESE ARE DELICIOUS!!!!  ENJOY.

Great, simple recipe. I used 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour and shortening instead of lard. They turned out tender and yummy. The only thing I will change next time is extra salt. The WW flour needs just a bit more salt I think.

Excellent Tortilla recipe. I know because that's how my Grandmother made them, and she was 100% Spanish. I learned from her, and am so glad I did, as the store-bought tortillas (most brands) don't even come close to authentic.

One of my great great grandmothers was Mexican, so I was itching to try my hand at making homemade tortillas.  I'm so glad I tried this recipe because it's perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly except I subbed margarine for the lard (what I had) and I made 16 tortillas instead of the 24.  What I love most about this is that it doesn't use so much fat in it (only 2 tbsp as opposed to 3/4 cup like I saw in some other recipes).  The taste and texture is good as well.  I just had one with salsa on it and it was delicious!  Thanks!

To be a really chewy, soft tortilla, these need much more lard/shortening - at least 1/2 cup. Following, this recipe exactly I ended up with very brittle, tasteless tortillas that didn't bubble up well in the pan. I did a bit more research and found a video recipe by Food Wishes - it's the money!

I want to thank all of you for making, eating, enjoying and rating this recipe.  I am the submitter of this recipe.  I grew up making these tortillas with my mom.  I live in NM and i got the recipe from a wonderful lady whom I've know all my life.  She used to cook her tortillas on a cast iron stove lid.  When I got married I got a lid from my mom as a wedding gift.  I hope you continue to enjoy the recipe.

Amazing tortillas!  Forgoing the extravagance of a press, we rolled the dough out with a thick wooden dowel and cooked them on an iron skillet.  Mixing the flour with your fingers is a great stress reliever and works far better than trying to use a mixer.  We used extra virgin coconut oil instead of lard, which has the same consistency as lard (below 76 degrees), but is packed full of good LDL's.  There was no coconut taste, so we have found a new substitute for lard in tortillas.  These tortillas were far better and cheaper than store bought, which are filled with unpronounceable preservatives and hydrogenated oils.

This recipe turned out really well. It is a great way to have fun in the kitchen if you have the extra time. My boyfriend said these reminded him of Indian flat bread. They would make excellent gyro or falafel sandwiches.

I have a few tips to making these the best tortillas they can be.  First off, I used butter because I don't like lard or shortening -- and they still taste GREAT!  Next, be sure your dough is a tiny bit sticky -- if it's too dry your tortillas won't roll as thin.  I used my dough hooks with my hand mixer to get the dough in a ball, then plopped it onto the counter and kneaded it for just a few minutes.  Instead of using flour on the counter (or on your rolling pin when you roll them out), spray the counter with PAM.  When you do this it makes it so you can roll them as thin as you'd like and they'll still peel right off for you to throw on your griddle.  You want to roll them as thin as you possibly can, if you don't they will be more like gorditas than tortillas (which is great for the times you want gorditas!).  I put the leftover tortillas onto foil and them roll them up, placing the whole roll into a ziplock baggie and into the refrigerator.  They are great to have on hand when I don't have half an hour to make them brand new.

Tortillas are quite possibly my favorite food-versatile, flexible, and abso-friggen-lutely delicious.  For the longest time, I was scared as heck to make my own.  Surely it would be obscenely difficult.  Nope.  Easy peasy and abso-friggen-lutely delicious!  Thanks LaDonna for a great recipe!  I used shortening instead of lard, but they still turned out wonderfully!  I've made tortillas a handful of times since the end of December!  Love them!!!!

This is a very good recipe for homemade flour tortillas. Growing up my friends and their families would always make authentic mexican food (all from scratch), one of them being fresh homemade flour tortillas. They did everything by feel with no recipe. The only difference is they had lard! However, I did not have any lard so I improvised an used 1/3 cup Crisco butter flavored shortening. It still came out pretty good, tasty, pliable, fresh and homemade. Everything else I followed to a "T". I used only half the recipe since I was only making for two people. Even with half of this recipe, I ended up with almost 15 small tortillas. I was trying to make smaller tortillas for tacos tonight. I rolled into small golf ball sizes, flatten it out with a rolling pin, turned the tortilla slightly to my left (90 degrees?) each time, flatten some more, inch by inch a circular shape will form. I made this as thin as possible. Placed one tortilla in a hot pan for 45 to 60 seconds, or until I see a small bubble form, then I flip it over to the other side for 45 seconds. I take the tortillas out place them in the center of a clean dish towel and fold the corners over to keep them warm until ready to serve. This is the only way I know how to make homemade tortilla, from watching my friends and their moms and grandma's. The rest just takes practice rolling out the shape to a nice circle. Homemade flour tortillas are always better than store bought.

I, literally, just made theses and I felt it important to comment on others who have reviewed this recipe to say that the tortillas came out too hard... One, you must make sure that you whisk the dry ingredients well before adding the lard.  Make sure that you mix the lard well enough that it looks like corn meal!  Thirdly, pay attention to your flour.  Add a little at a time.  I halfed this recipe and found that I had almost a little over a 1/4 of a cup of flour left over. You need to know how to tell when you don't need to add anymore flour. -The dough will actually tell you itself, when it isn't sticky anymore and you can hold it in your hands without it sticking to them.  I, then, kneaded the dough for several minutes, lightly sprinkling flour on it as I kneaded the dough.  rolled them into balls, coated them with olive oil, rolled them in flour and let them sit for an hour (per another reviewer's suggestion).  Also, when rolling the balls out flat, make sure you coat your rolling pin each time with flour and flour your service, and don't be afraid of rolling them too thin.  They will contract when you place them on heat.  If your tortillas are coming out too hard or crispy, then you are cooking them too long and your pan isn't hot enough.  The first one I made came out hard and crispy because of this.  They only need about 1 - 2 seconds per side. Maybe 3...  If you can get the cooking length down, you should have no issue with this recipe!

Excellent taste and far easier to make than you might think. They are also not all that time consuming and are a lot of fun to make.
I make three modifications to the recipe as written. I use warm water, shortening instead of lard, and I let my dough rest about ten minutes before rolling it out. This makes rolling much easier and the dough will keep it's shape much better once rolled.

I can't believe this recipe has so many rave reviews. Soft tortillas need MUCH more lard/shortening than 2 tablespoons. I wisely added 6 more tablespoons of shortening to make pretty good tortillas. Otherwise it would have been a waste of ingredients.

I make my own homemade tortillas all the time without a recipe and I wanted to try this recipe to compare.  You will not be disappointed!! My husband could not tell the difference!!! The only thing I did differently was I used 2 tsps of salt. Quick note: lard makes these better but you can substitute shortening if you have to.

I made these tortillas last night for my family.We used them for quesadilla's,I didn't feel like running to the store so i used shortening instead of lard They turned out pretty good.It said they make 24 but they made 12 small sized ones, Maybe due to the i fact  didn't have a roller.Next time i will try lard to see if they taste any different!Over all my family was pretty happy with them!

I cut the recipe in half to make 12 and used vegetable shortening instead of lard. These are very quick to mix and cook. The longest part is the rolling of each ball of dough, so a tortilla press would have helped with that. My first tortilla was dry, thick, hard, tasteless, and would not fold. I was ready to dump the rest of the bowl! Then, I decided to make ONE MORE and got it right!!! I found that if I rolled the dough balls tortilla thin, then lifted them and further stretched with my hands, they bubbled and rose on their own in the pan. I found that heating the pan on 7 was best, but then turning it down to about 5.5-6, once heated, worked best to avoid rinsing the pan half way through. I also spritzed the hot pan as needed with olive oil. The rest of the tortillas were soft, folded, and had a good flavor! They are a little thicker than traditional, or store bought, tortillas though. I just hope now, they will keep until tommorrow! EDIT NOTE: I tried them again using vegetable oil, to make them healthier, and I used a tortilla press. The tortilla press was easier to use. All I had to do was stretch them paper thin just a bit more.

And to nikki... Lol again... Another thing my mother in law does is ... after she kneads the dough, she'll divide it into little balls about 1"-1.5" in diamater and with a little bit of corn oil on her hands she'll coat the ball... Then put all the little balls in a bowl and cover with a plastic bag for about an hr... After the time is up she'll pull out one ball at a time and roll it in flour then roll them out... But remember to only roll once then turn ....It really works ;)

this recipe is exactly what I was looking for. I dd substitute half butter and half shortening as lard isnot readily available here. we didn't miss it. they tasted excellent. I made a half batch and got exactly 1 dozen 6" tortillas. I used my hands to stretch them, much as I do pizza dough, then rolled them to even them out and make them thin. I only cooked them for a few seconds per side, then placed them in between layers of damp paper towels. I wrapped the stack in foil and placed in a 250 degree oven to warm them up before dinner. I froze half, and they thaw and reheat WONDERFULLY. thank you! much better than store bought.

Tips: Keep warm inside a towel and wrap the towel with foil. Cook for less time on 2nd side. Do not refrigerate and will keep for 3 days in a ziplock bag. Reheat in a skillet. Use warm water. Mix dry ingredients in a food processor, add lard pulse to combine, turn on and pour in warm water through the opening. Stop food processor when dough ball forms. Finish kneading by hand. I had 2T of water left over. Dough shouldn't be overly sticky. Use plenty of flour when rolling out.

These are GREAT. I used them for flatbread so I left them a bit thicker. For me, it worked better to cook them over high heat for about 20 seconds per side; when I cooked them over medium-high heat, the edges crisped more than I wanted. I also substituted shortening for the lard with no problem. I will DEFINITELY use this from now on instead of storebought flatbread! **Edit: I made these a few times as classic tortillas and found this to be helpful: Sometimes the tortillas seem a little hard/crunchy/inflexible when they come out of the pan. Just lay them on a plate and keep them sealed tightly with plastic wrap. I guess they steam a bit under the plastic so that they're soft and floppy within 30 minutes or so. :)

Love this recipe! I used olive oil instead of the lard and it turned out fantastic.  The consistency of the dough was smooth and easy to roll.

This was a really easy recipe. I cut the recipe in half and used shortening instead of lard. It made 12 regular sized tortillas. For everyone who thinks that this recipe does not make 24, you are not rolling them thin enough! They should not be thick and resemble pitas or naan. When rolling them out they should be thin enough that you can almost see through them. Hope this helps.

I made tortillas for the first time today.! I grew up with a mother who always made tortillas and I've lived on my own for a couple years now buying store tortillas ! I thought it was time that I made my own, and what a great easy recipe to use! I loved it:)  After I made them I told my mother and she gave me some pointers she said do only one teaspoon of baking powder.  I'll try her way next time and see what happens, but great recipe!

These were fantastic!  Easy to make. I used Crisco and they tasted fine.  Have to get a tortilla press though so I can make them faster!  Hubby loved them and he knows tortillas!  I made cinnamon sugared sopaipilla's with the leftovers.

The only thing I would suggest is use warm water, and let the dough rest, for at least 20 min before you start rolling it out

I lived in Mexico when I was younger eating only homemade tortillas so I really know how good homemade tortillas should taste. These hold up to my standard very well! These were very good and very pliable. I did have trouble getting them into perfect circles but that will improve with time. I made half the recipe and it took me exactly 30 mins from start to finish of clean up. I was able to get 11 medium tortillas out of half the recipe. I will definitely make again! And soon!

I didn't want to go to the store and needed a quick easy recipe. This has to be one of the easiest recipes ever.  I made the dough early in the day took about 5 minutes. I separated the dough into 12 parts then just put them in a gallon size baggie and refrigerated until later that day.  When I made them I did use 1/4 cup of Crisco not lard they easily made large 12" tortilla's.  My family could not believe that I made them they were better than store bought supper soft.  I don't think I'll be buying tortillas again. There is a million different things you can do don't be afraid to add flavor or spice and if you make extra and cut the tortilla into triangles prior to cooking fry them up and make tortilla chips to go with dinner. The were just as good and soft the next day did not even need to be heated.  MUST TRY!!

I just made this recipe but I used coconut oil since I don't agree with shortening or lard both very bad for you.... But coconut oil is great for you soooo many health benefits. Try it!!! I'm sure you will love it.........

It's so great being able to make them homemade instead of buying them. I did use unbleached, white whole wheat flour from KAF. I didn't have lard, so I went against the recommendation of the author, but they still turned out good. I'm sure with lard they are even better, but I just never have it around. If you're having trouble rolling them round, place the balls between parchment paper (no flour needed) and be sure to use a long wooden roller, like for pizza dough. Then turn it 1/4 turn with each roll. Oh, and be sure to roll from the middle out. Thanks for the great recipe! Lynette

Wonderful recipe! I was raised in Texas and had home made tortillas (thanks mom!) all of the time by using White Wing Flour. That's a "just add water" mix. When we were stationed in Germany the commissary didn't carry it so I had to make due with what was around. Lots of trial and error, calling home to grandmothers and aunts to figure out what "until it looks right" meant and the horrible outcome of Quaker Oats flour. Yuck.  I've been through quite a few recipes over the years but once I found this one I was able to stop looking. I use butter or lard interchangeably. Simple, easy to make in big batches and they freeze beautifully! Spread them out on the counter on a dish towel, rotating until they're cool, then put a meals worth in a gallon size freezer bag. Do not bag them when they're still warm, they'll stick together! To heat them up just put them on the grill like normal. Perfect!

Fabulous! I have made these 3 times. Always good and so yummy. I use butter because I dont have lard. Doesn't seem to matter. Mix the dough and knead it with your hands. You dont need any fancy equipment. Be sure to roll them *paper thin* with a rolling pin. As thin as you can get them. Cook them on a flat skillet/iron gridle until they are bubbly and browning a bit. I flip them once. Then stack them on a plate as you cook them and keep them covered with tinfoil. The steam will keep them moist and take the crunchy texture away. I have used them to make enchiladas and they are very pliable and turn out great! For me, this recipe makes 10 very large tortillas (burrito size).

This is a solid recipe that can be cut to fit the number of tortillas needed.  I only needed 6 and the recipe was perfect using the calculator.  I only gave it 4 stars because I really think the dough should rest before rolling.  Resting 15-30 minutes results in s dough that is easier to roll out, keeps it shape without snapping back and is light after cooking.

hmmm...just finished making this very timely item...it tastes...slightly chewy, crunchy in some places, soft in others, slightly thicker than store bought because i couldn't get it very thin even using a marble roller...i used vegetable shortening instead of lard and used olive oil in the frying pan to cook the tortillas, i didn't know if i was supposed to or not as it was not in the directions but i figured that that flour would eventually start to burn on the pan .  the next day it was greasy and heavy....not liked at all...will not make this again.

This recipe was exact and delicious.  I like how the tortillas turned out fluffy, without having to use boiling water.  The dough rolled out nicely and I got about 20 tortillas from the mix.  Hint to beginners: when rolling out the tortillas, place your hands on top of your rolling pin- not the handles (works better).  Roll the dough in a ball and press your palms against the countertop- and each time your roll out from the center- turn the dough clockwise- repeat- you will get a round tortilla.  Thank you for the recipe! I will make these again and again!

Easy! I forgot tortillas at the store so I tried this recipe and they came out much better than store-bought. The only change I made was that I used organic coconut oil instead of lard and a bit more than the the recipe called for. It made for a much healthier version.
I have an iron tortilla skillet that I use to heat tortillas which worked out great for these - I highly recommend getting one or a flat iron for these.

I've grown up eating tortillas, especially being from South Texas and being half Mexican. I used butter, about 2 1/2 TBS and a little less than the 1 1/2 cups of water, maybe about 1 1/4 cup. I also used a tortilla press, so I didn't have to roll out and flatten the tortillas. It was extremely quick and super easy. Thanks so much for sharing! We live in the Middle East and authentic tortillas are NO WHERE to be found, except for my home, now ;-). Thanks again!

I don't think the reviewers saying this makes tiny tortillas are rolling them out thin enough.  The size is perfect, the dough is great to work with, the tortillas pliable and yummy!

I know this says not to sub vegetable oil, but I can't get lard where I live, so I routinely use canola oil and they come out perfectly. Excellent recipe--I won't go back to store-bought.

These taste great, are easy to make, and are much cheaper than storebought (and without all the additives!)  I have difficulties rolling them out in a circle but that doesn't really matter.  It is important that the pan be quite hot or they take too long to cook and end up crisp rather than pliable.  I tried them with part whole wheat flour but that, too, makes them less flexible.

This can be alittle tricky, You really need to have  the stove on med-high to high heat and only for a few seconds per side. If you have it at a lower heat setting they will turn out dry stiff and brittle!

Excellent tortillas and much easier to make than I expected.  I didn't have lard so I substituted 2 TBS butter.  This made them less authentic, but the flavor and texture was excellent.  I put them in a folded kitchen towel as I was making them and they stayed warm and soft long after dinner.  When they cooled, I put them in the fridge, still in the towel.  The next day, they're still soft and taste great.

The best my husband has ever had...and he's Mexican!  The only thing to watch out for is how you cook it.  Cook on med-high only for a few seconds each side.  1/2 of them I cooked on med-low & they turned out hard.

I have tried and failed to make flour tortillas several times. This recipe finally made the grade! I grew up in a home where my grandmother made tortillas almost every day. Like many ladies of her generation, she cooked by using a little of this with a little of that, roll it like this and pat it like that. As many times as I watched this process I never quite got the knack. The search is over.  I only changed a couple of things. The first was that I used Crisco shortening like my grandmother. For the first batch of tortillas I used exactly two tablespoons. The texture of the dough was just a tiny bit off. The next time, I measured two HEAPING tablespoons of the shortening and this was just right. My husband loved the first batch but I thought they were a little tough. the next time I was careful to not over knead or over handle the dough. After I kneaded the dough into a big ball I let it rest in the bowl under a clean damp dishtowel for about ten minutes while the comal heated up. After resting, I formed the dough into balls and rolled them out on my floured board. They came out thin, pliable and delicious! A hit with the family for sure! Since I made two dozen, we heated up them up the next day for burritos. Now to work on making perfect circles every time, and not the map of Texas.

Great recipe. My husband made me a large wooden tortilla press so I could make flour and corn tortillas. I used this recipe and  had great success with it . I found that the tortilla would shrink back when removed from the press . I let the dough rest covered for a half an hour and they did'nt shrink back as much.

Like others, I didn't intend to make homemade tortillas but found myself wanting tacos for dinner but not badly enough to go to the store! These are super easy, came together very quickly and we loved them! I had planned on halving the recipe but after reading the reviews about how small the tortillas come out, I made the full batch and cut into 12 portions. The size was perfect, a nice 8-10" tortilla. I also used 3 Tbsp of shortening and the tortillas didn't come out dry as others mentioned. Oh,I did have a helper who rolled them out while I 'fried' them, see if you can get someone to help you!

This is an amazing recipe I wish I could give it 10 stars.. These taste a lot better than what you get in market.. I usually cook for two so I scale it to yield 8 which actually makes 4 tortillas.. If you want to make the amount listed double the recipe or at least increase it by a third.. Try this out you won't be disappointed..

We were making burritos tonight, and I had my husband run into the store to grab the ingredients. The national-name tortillas he ended up buying contained a full gram of trans fat per tortilla - and if you're going to eat more than one, like I was - you'll end up consuming several grams of trans fat. Not cool! So, I ended up searching AllRecipes and made this recipe, though I scaled down the recipe to just 4 servings. (Undaunted, he ate the other ones.) Since this was a 'tortilla emergency,' I was forced to substitute butter for the lard (which I wouldn't use anyway, even if it tastes best). I had to add just a touch more water to mix my dough, but the tortillas came out well....pliable yet crisp. By themselves, they weren't particularly flavorful, but with toppings they were great. It only took me probably 15-20 minutes from start to finish since I was only making four. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

the flavor was good and the texture was almost right.  Keeping in mind I've only tried making tortillas once before with no success, so it just may be my technique.  My result of this recipe was a little dry and not very pliable.  They didn't bubble.  but again it could just be me.  Hope you have better luck.  I'm going to be testing different recipes until I can come as close to my mom's tortillas as I can.

Loved loved loved these.  Taste like naan or fresh pita bread, but thin and durable, like a good tortilla should be.  Halved the recipe, but needed 2 tbsp of shortening to get right consistency before adding water.  I won't buy flour tortillas again.

Wonderful recipe! Followed exactly. Got 16 tortillas that were about 8 inches. I'm sure someone more adept with a rolling pin could have gotten more (or someone with a tortilla press!). Tastes incredible. Very pliable.

As is, the recipe is okay. 2 TBSP of lard did not get my very far with the water...The snap back on the dough was to strong to roll out as far as I needed with having to make 24 count. Plus there was so little lard, that it never reached that "fine cornmeal" state. A 2nd batch was in order. It took at least 4 TBSP of lard and another 1/2tsp of salt as well. Once I did that, it turned out similar to a recipe my mom used to make. BEST TIP I can tell you on how to get equal amount of dough pieces on a recipes such as this is: weigh you dough prior to cutting and proportioning out. Once the dough is weighed divide out how many you need to make this recipe work to serving size. My dough weighed 36oz / 24= 1.5oz per portion. Will make again with my adjustments.

I followed one reviewer's suggestion and used just under 1/2 cup of lard instead of 2 tablespoons and that worked beautifully for me. I feel like without it it would have been too dry. Also added a splash more of water, probably a half a teaspoon or so. This made 18 smallish tortillas for me.

Although I did substitute the lard with about 3 tablespoons of olive oil.  Also the recipe could be readily used in lieu of naan or most other flatbreads.

Wow! These are amazing! I didn't have lard so I used cold butter and they turned out perfectly. They look just like store bought but taste a million times better.

EDIT: I have made these a million times now and I actually like using vegetable oil more than lard or butter. They turn out the same no matter what you use.

Very good except I used warm water and also allowed the dough to rest after neading and again after forming the balls about 10 minutes each time or one beer however you want to set the time is up to you this is the way it was done by my wifes Family and has been passed down for generations good eating!!!!!!

Big secret in making tortillas.  If the get crackery and can seem to get over that.  Use warmer water add a pinch of yeast.  It will make sucessful tortillas all the time.  These cost pennies to make at home.  Soon you can whip out  dozen in 5 min with practice.

Out of all the tortilla recipes I've tried off AR, these are hands down the best. With the original recipe, I made 24 tortillas about 8 inches diameter. Not sure why some people had trouble with this but it does make the number of servings as stated. Also, the dough is very flexible and forgiving. My 5 year old daughter even made 3 on her own. I did use shortening because I didn't have lard and used hot water.

If you're having trouble rolling out circles, look at the back of your largest round dinner plates to see if they have a circular "foot" molded into the ceramic.  If so, put each lightly floured ball onto a cutting board and then press it out round with the bottom of your dinner plate.  If it's still a little thick just roll a bit more after pressing it out trying to keep the round shape.  Pressing out the dough instead of rolling works a bit better if you do have a slightly higher lard content.  You can also try pressing out rounds just by pressing them out flat on your floured surface using a lightly floured cutting board.  (This method makes it a little hard to get the thickness even, though.)

Nowhere near enough lard in this. The tortillas end up hard instead of how they should be. For 4 cups of flour, it should be  closer to 8-12Tbs. Also, when mixing in the water, it should be warm/hot. Finally as a tip, rolling them out between Saran wrap or the like, will make it far easier to get them thin.

These are amazing. I got tired of rolling so the last few I kept pretty thick, about the thickness of a nickle They still cooked up nice on a griddle and were like flat bread. I slathered each with homemade hummus and roasted veggies. This was a huge hit with my 7yr old who has never tried either homemade tortillas or hummus.

I have been making tortillas for about 30 years my mother 50 years her mother for 70 years. I just wanted to say that you can use vegetable oil we do now in the past lard. Our tortillas are fluffy and melt in your mouth.

This took a lot of time and effort for something that tasted like what I can buy at the grocery store.  I will not make again as it was nothing special for my family.

I've been using recipes from this website for quite some time but never really stopped afterwards to write reviews about them. This is the first time I thought I should really write something. This recipe is absolutely delicious! And so easy to make! We had a burrito night so I divided a full recipe into only 8 balls. I wanted them big so I could roll them up even if full with meat, guacamole, beans, sour cream, cheddar cheese... The only thing I changed, like other reviewers, was the fact that I used hot water. I had fresh lard on hand so I used it to follow the recipe. I didn't have a skillet big enough for the size of my tortillas so I used a electric pan for cooking them. It worked perfectly. As soon as I was taking them out I wrapped them in a clean dry towel to keep them moist. I'll be using this recipe again and again! Thank you for the recipe!

Perfect! We really loved these tortillas. They were easy to do. I really only need to learn how to roll them out better. I rolled mine a little to thin so next time I'll go thicker.

My husband and I loved these! I did not change the recipe aside from making them bigger. Next time I think I will try harder to make them thinner and maybe smaller. That can be hard to do as the shrink when rolled out. 
It was fun to make these instead of having to drive all the way to town to get store bought ones. These are way better although a bit of work. I think we will be eating these more often for tacos and tortilla soup....

These were pretty good, but I will definitely add more salt next time.  Mine didn't roll out very thin, so I picked them up and stretched them a bit and that worked well.  I agree with another reviewer who said to heat the pan to 7 and then cook on 5.5 or 6 - I started out at 5 for the first one and it took forever to cook and ended up too thick.  I might also add a bit more lard next time (I halved the recipe, and will probably go with a heaping tablespoon instead of just a tablespoon).  Halving the recipe made 10 medium sized tortillas.

Great recipe..I used 1 1/2 times amount in recipe and got 18 8 inch tortillas..I did  make 24 round balls like recipe said and used Crisco butter flavored shortening..also, hot water...To make into tortilla shape , I rolled out with rolling pan, then used an 8 inch saucepan top to cut out a perfect circle. Also, refrigerated before cooking a few hours..you can safely stack on top of each other..when you flour the dough balls before you roll out,this adds enough flour so tortillas don't stick on top when stacked together.

This just turned into a big sticky mess for me.  I have never attempted my own tortillas before so I wasn't really sure what to expect but what I came up with needed a LOT more flour just to be able to work with.  It was still really sticky when I tried to cook one but it just didn't work out.  The taste was close to a pancake mix pancake.  I don't know what I did wrong as the the instructions and ingredients were simple.  It just didn't work for me.  I am giving it three stars because it must have been my error somewhere but I will not be trying these again.

This was great. I realized after making the dough my rolling pin was no where to be found so I ended up just pressing them out pretty thin but not pretty. I'll make this again when I get a press or a rolling pin. Made a great "budget" dinner that wasn't pasta again.

I did not care for this! the dough was way to dry you need more lard people. Please don't think that this is what homemade tortillas are like. They are supposed to be light and fluffy and melt in your mouth.

I used shortening instead of lard (because frankly, eww!) and these still taste great. Use really hot water as well.  Cooking on cast iron is a must!  These are quick and so easy, I won't ever buy store-made tortillas again.  I will say, this recipe doesn't make as many as it says, unless you make very tiny tortillas.  But it's worth making another batch!

This recipe can be scaled up or down, and the dough can be divided into whatever size you like depending on how big you want the tortillas to be.  Working with this recipe you can easily substitute half the all-purpose flour for corn meal or whole wheat flour.  I've tried with both variations; the corn meal produces a more fragile tortilla but the flavour and texture is out of this world.  Whole wheat is my favourite variation.  I will never buy tortillas from the store again; these are simply too easy and too tasty.

I usually don't post a review when I don't follow the recipe exactly but this one still turned out great!  I used the Smart Balance butter that has olive oil in it in place of the lard and half whole wheat flour.  They still turned out great.  I scaled it down because I was worried about how well they would keep but they were still soft after a week and gone after that!

Very quick and easy, and very tasty.  I struggled a bit at first, to roll the dough out as thin as I wanted it to be, but after a few, I got the hang of it.

-I added some frozen spinach, pepper, oregano, and garlic powder for a bit of difference to ordinary salad wraps. 
-I also subbed one of the cups of flour with whole wheat. 
-And used 2 TB butter not lard.
-As soon as each one was done I immedietly threw it into a ziplock and sealed it shut. They stay very soft that way.

Great recipe. I did end up doubling the lard because 2 T got lost in all that flour. And agreed - they are way better than store bought! A word to the wise: make sure you shake off all the extra flour before tossing them in the skillet or the excess flour will burn. I didn't and I set off the smoke alarm!

My Spaniard husband, whose never had a homemade Mexican tortilla, loved these.  The flavor was great, but I had a hard time keeping them thin enough.  When I took them off the press they shrunk up and got thicker.

The taste was good except the texture was more like naan bread. It made 16 tortillas not 24. As much as I tried rolling them thin they would shrink on the way to the comal.

I ended up getting 16 tortillas out of the recipe.  I cut the dough into about golf ball sized pieces and then rolled them flat.  In order to get the nice round edges, roll your dough into a nice ball, flatten with the palm of your hand, then roll out.  Make sure you have enough flour so that the dough doesn't stick, and rotate 1/4 turn after each roll.  Roll from the center out, but don't leave the dough with your rolling pin at the edge.  My husband said that they were bland, but other than that, everyone liked them.  Just an average recipe.

These are great! I have to admit, I was hesitant to try making these because I've heard homemade tortillas are hard to roll out, but it was the complete opposite for me. I got them nice and thin in no time. I only made 1/4 of the recipe and got 6 small tortillas from it. I did use vegetable  shortening instead of lard and heated my water in the microwave before adding it in. These cooked up nicely and they were still soft (I was afraid mine would get crunchy or hard) I used them to make quesadillas. They were perfect! I will never buy store bought tortillas again for three reasons, these were quick/easy to make, they taste great and the cost to make these are way cheaper than buying the pre-made stuff. These are awesome! Thanks for sharing!

Great and tasty.  I'm in trouble now that I know I can make them instead of buy them.  The trick to make them thinner is to stretch out the tortilla after rolled.   Made mine a little thinner for the family, but I like them thicker.

I have tried lots of tortilla recipes and this one hands down is one of the best! I made it as written with no changes, other than I halfed it. I used vegy oil and coconut oil both in other recipes before with "OK" results. I used lard this time (the amount is small). My opinion, it makes a HUGE difference in the texture of the tortillas...the ones I made last night were exactly like restaurant quality (soft, pliable with good taste). Few helpful things: 1) used very warm water, adding a little at a time, (ended up using less than the recipe called for); 2) after forming into balls, covered the bowl with a damp towel secured on top by a plate to keep the moisture in, and let the dough rest about 15 min (30 would've probably been better); 3) when rolling out the tortillas, use only a VERY light dusting of flour (you don't want to put too much flour back into your tortillas or they tend to be a little stiff), I turned the dough a couple of times when rolling out to start the form of the tortilla, then turned my body and rolling pin to finish out the final shape; 4) I used a Tfal skillet (didn't have a cast iron) on med/hi, cooked 25 sec/flipped, cooked 25 sec/flipped, cooked 10 sec more, then moved tortilla to a damp kitchen towel covered plate (place the warm tortilla between the folds of the towel) then cover the plate and towel with a large bowl to hold in the heat and moisture (this in lieu of a tortilla warmer container). Huge hit! Stored leftovers in fridge in ziploc.

Much better than store bought! I used about 4 Tbs of butter instead of lard and they turned out well, probably not as good as with lard, but I wanted to avoid the preservatives.

I loved this recipe. I did one little change though. I don't use shortening or lard but I had coconut oil so I used that. Perfect and didn't taste the coconut.

Let the balls rest for at least ten minutes before rolling or the gluten in the dough won't relax enough and will "shrink" on you.

So frickin' easy!  I do what one other reviewer suggested and let the divided dough sit under a wet towel for ten minutes, and boy does that make all the difference.  I think the original poster didn't have burritos or other wraps in mind when they set the servings though, I make 16 per recipe.

After reading the most helpful reviews, I decided to use exact measurements, substitute butter for lard and use hot tap water. Into the whisked dry ingredients in my Kitchenaid's mixing bowl, I finely grated refrigerated butter, grating about 1/4 of the butter at a time and stopping to mix it into the flour with my hands. I attached my dough hook and kneaded on speed 2 for 2-3 minutes, until the dough was smooth and elastic. 

I divided the dough into 16 balls after reading how small others' tortillas were and let them rest 10 minutes while I cleaned up and heated my clean dry cast iron skillet to high (later, I turned down the heat to med-high). 

I sprayed both my silicone mat and rolling pin with non-stick cooking spray, spread the ball of dough with my fingers into an approximately 4" circle - the dough is very soft and spread easily - then, rolled from the center out toward 12 o'clock, then 6 o'clock, 3 o'clock, then 9 o'clock, etc. The dough easily rolled so thin I could read the "Silpat" logo beneath it.

After rolling out one ball, I found the resulting tortilla was too large for my skillet, so I divided each ball in half again - making 32 8"-10" tortillas.

I cooked each tortilla about 10 seconds until the bubbles were a dark golden brown, then flipped it over for another 5 or so seconds. 

The tortillas were delicious! Light, delicate and flavorful. Although they were intended for enchiladas, I ate three while I cooked!

This a a great and easy recipe for flour tortillas.  I recommend using milk instead of water or half water half sour cream and double the lard/butter for a chewy, fluffy tortilla.  Also, it is even better when you let it rest.  I made half the recipe yesterday and added the extra butter and water/sour cream (my mothers trick) and stored the extra dough in a zip lock bag.  This morning, the tortilla I made was even more fluffy and chewy.  The trick to the dough not drying out it to rub the balls with a little oil.

I don't have a lot of experience with homemade tortillas. A friend made some once and we found them dry, stiff, and rather tasteless. This recipe is very quick and easy. I made them with my kids and my four year old rolled most of them out. The dough is easy to roll really thin, which was important to us. We tried cooking them on a plain cast iron griddle and with butter. We liked them both ways. We found it was really easy to make them into quesadillas as we made them. We just put slices of cheese on while cooking the second side, then folded it in half. We'll definitely be making them again. I took away one star because I can't say I passionately love them like many of the reviewers, but I think it's just because I've never really had homemade tortillas and it's probably an acquired taste. My husband really liked them. My kids both ate a moderate amount of both the dough and the quesadillas. Neither of them liked the plain tortillas. So I made all of them into quesadillas and put them in the fridge. I'll re heat them tomorrow and see how they are the second day.

I made half the recipe, resulting in 12 tortillas.  To save a little time, I made them in the food processor.  Of course, the most time is in rolling them out.  They came out beautifully.

I didn't have lard on hand so I used shortening. These were wonderful! I've tried other tortilla recipes and this was the easiest and the tastiest. I will definitely make these again! 
I only got 16 out of this recipe, but they were the perfect size. If I had made 24 I think they would have been too small.

These are fabulous and super healthy especially if you substitute ½ whole wheat flour (I did this especially because I like the taste)... but I think they are one of those recipes you learn by trial and error... to start out I had a lot of error... I overcooked most of them... cooking time should be less than a minute as long as you have a hot nonstick pan... also immediately place between paper towels in a sealed bag... by the time I got them all done they had all softened each other up nicely... mine did start to harden in the fridge after a few days, to soften I wrapped in a damp paper towel and microwaved for 5 to 10 seconds and they were perfect... next time I will try like other reviewers said and use hot or boiling water... also I found that it takes skill learning how to roll them out... I think it is best not to over flour the surface and turn the tortilla over constantly until round and about the thickness of a dime

Awesome recipe. So Easy to follow. I used 1 TBSP lard and 1 TBSP Butter. I would reccommend dividing the dough into only 16 balls however. At this size you get 10-11" tortillas, perfect for enchiladas, which is what I was making.
Tortillas were easy to work with. They stayed pliable and rolled up well without tearing. Great tortilla for burritos or wraps! :)

These were very good. Was glad someone said they had substituted butter since 'real and unprocessed' lard is next to impossible to find. Like another person, mine came out thicker, except for one, which got too crispy - suspect there's a 'knack' to rolling these out right. I did have to use flour to roll the balls in or they were too sticky. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

To be fair, I can't use lard so I don't know how fair this review is. My tortillas didn't turn out very soft. I used olive oil. Still looking for something that will yield tortillas that as soft as the old el paso one from the store....

I MAKE TORTILLAS ALL THE TIME THIS IS A GOOD RECIPE   BUT I USE BACON FAT  (PORK FAT RULES) THIS ADDS ANOTHER BIT OF FLAVOR.  MAY NOT BE QUIT HEALTHY BUT REAL GOOD.  PUT BUTTER ON THEM AND ADD HONEY  I HAVE TO MAKE TWICE AS MUCH BECAUSE THE KIDS EAT THEM WITH HONEY AS FAST AS I GET THEM OFF THE GRILL   USE YOUR CAST IRON PANCAKE SKILLET.  THE GRAND KIDS HELP ME ROLL THEM OUT I HAVE SEVERAL SMALL KIDS SIZE ROLLING PINS ONE OF THE BEST ROLLING PINS ARE THE ONES YOU GET FROM PAMPERED CHEF THE ONE HAND ROLLING PIN.

these tortillas turned out pretty good (for my first try) i think i might need to work on making them thinner. it seemed liked no matter how thin i made them, they still puffed up quite a bit. they tasted pretty good though.

Quick and Easy recipe that tastes great.  Added a bit more salt than 1 Tsp and didn't wait the hour before rolling them out.  They came out perfect… pliable and authentic tasting.

This is the best tortilla recipe, I worked at Mexican restaurant once and this is better than the one I used to make there. But  I add 1 more tablespoon of lard and half teaspoon more of baking powder as I like it better the way it came out. Thank you LaDonna!

I have made these tortillas twice (half recipe) with perfect results.  So much tastier than store bought.  I do substitute shortening for the lard -  but the flavor is still perfect.  I use the tortillas in chicken enchiladas!  YUM

Not sure what all the fuss is about Awful!! I followed the recipe exactly it just tasted like flour instead of a tortilla. After cooking the tortillas the mix was crumbly and fell apart I could not use the tortillas for anything like enchiladas etc. My Mom always added lard and hot water and let the dough rise maybe that was the problem. I will admit that the dough rolled out nice that's the only reason why I gave it 2 stars..

Made this recipes as is they were ok. Dough was a little too sticky. Second time around, I cut the water to 1 cup, upped the salt to 2 teaspoons. My grandmother used really hot water and let the dough rest covered in a bowl for at least 30 minutes before forming into balls. I did the same and found its much easier to work with and flavor and consistency were much better.

Easy recipe and finally my tortillas didn't fall apart.  Hard to get them flat enough but I always have problems with rolling dough.

I think these have a learning curve, since mine ended up a bit thick.  But honestly I loved them(I made wheat for me) and the kids loved them too(white flour).  No more buying.  And why would you when you have all the ingredients at home?!  I used crisco instead of lard.

I have been making tortillas for years and the recipe is by far the best.  I didn't have lard and so I used butter.  It worked out just fine.  So soft and perfect!!!

These were pretty good, I rolled them out thin and didnt like the texture so I tried it thicker and that did work very well for my taste. We have home baked tortillas in our local Kroger and I was hoping that I could mirror them with this recipe, no luck. I plan to keep messing with this one, as it seems similar to what I remember my mom using and hope to get the perfect one.

Very easy to make!  It was hard for me to get them very thin but even thick, they were like a gordita shell (from Taco Bell) which I was okay with.

Excellent - I wouldn't change a thing. Except that I used spelt flour with a smidge of xanthan gum to make up for the lack of gluten. Perfecto!

This was my first time trying to make tortillas and these did not come out good at all , they were dry and broke in half as soon as I tried to fold them. I did some research and it seems you need to use alot more lard. I will try to make these again.
edit *
Made these again halving the recipe used a 1/4 cup of butter instead of the 1 TB and they came out great. After I rolled them into balls I put a towel over them and let them sit for 20 minutes before rolling them out.

I agree with dreamer. These tortillas turned out rather dry, dense, and not very flexible. Maybe it was because I used shortening... I don't know how to get lard.

I tried it again but added lots more shortening and they were better! (but not better for you :/)

Also, rolling out thin tortillas with a rolling pin is kind of difficult! Be prepared for a bit of work!

I did not get very good results with this recipe. The tortillas were tough, lacking in flavor, and not very pliable.  About halfway through rolling the tortillas, I got the technique of rolling them super thin...so thin they feel like a piece of fabric. Even though the directions say to use "medium-high heat," I found that I had to keep my skillet temp around medium otherwise they were too crisp and impossible to roll for burritos.

I've made flour tortillas twice now, first using the Tortilla I recipe, and now this recipe.  I really can't tell the difference between either recipe - even tho one calls for shortening the other calls for lard.
One thing that tremendously helped me was to place each piece of dough between 2 pieces of parchment paper when rolling out.  The tortillas may not be pretty like store bought tortillas but they're easy enough to make.

I am a Celiac and wanted some decent flour tortillas I can eat with out having to run to the store and getting Gluten free ones.  So I raided my wife's baking supplies and she has a gluten free flour mix she uses to bake.  So I substitute the all purpose flour and halved the recipe and they came out a little thicker then normal but they came out great kind of like a flat bread but hit the spot.  I am going to get my wife to make some more of these since she is the baker and can work wonders with gluten free flour.

I am looking for a good recipe and this wasn't it.  The dough didn't stick together, so I added more water, then it was so stiff that kneading was VERY hard to do.  After I cooked a few I tasted one and was very unhappy with it.  It didn't taste like a tortilla! :(  I debated not making the rest and then decided to just make bunuelos with them, to not waste the ingredients.  Guess I should just call grandma, but she doesn't have 'recipes' so this may be a long conversation lol

These tortillas are pretty good.  I made the full 2 dozen, so they were on the small side, but I like that because it's instant portion control.  Like other reviewers, I also like the fact that there are only 2T of lard vs other recipes with more fat.  The tortillas became even more pliable after cooling stacked in layers within a Ziplock.  The only reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5 is that the cooking time was not specified (I know this is an art, not a science), so that my first few tortillas were not awesome.  I substituted 1.25 cups of white flour for wheat, and used a tortilla press (saves lots of time vs rolling pin).  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe.  I was using another recipe that used 1/3 cup lard, and although it was pretty good, it seemed a little too greasy.  It does take a bit longer to lightly brown the tortillas from this recipe, though, and I ended up using a bit of pork fat (left over from making pulled pork) on the griddle.  A little extra fat in the recipe would probably work as well, but this was still better than using 1/3 cup lard.  Another reviewer likened the tortillas from this recipe to naan, and I agree - it would probably be great accompaniment with Indian recipes.  Me, I had it with some homemade green chili, and it was great!  I would certainly make this again.

Fabulous!  I was intimidated at first, but these were really easy to make.  I have successfully halved (8 tortillas) and quartered (4 tortillas) this recipe and I always use butter instead of lard.  Note: if you cook these too long they will be hard/crispy instead of pliable so turn down the heat if you are making a large batch and err on the side of being "underdone".

Great recipe.  I used shortening instead of lard because that is what I had on hand and I did not roll out I used my fingers and patted them out because they kept sticking to my rolling pen.  To make them as thin as possible when I picked them up I streched them out and when I layed them in the pan I streched them out more.  I found that on my gas stove top the tortillas came out softer when cooked on Low High. I cooked them one at a time and let one cool on a cooling rack while cooking the next one.  Then I would move it from the cooling rack to a plate.  After they had all cooled and were cold I stored them in a gallon ziplock bag.

Very good and tasty !! I also used margarine, what I had on hand. I need to work on being able to roll them out thin enough, but they were very easy. Used them to make bowls for taco salads. Thanks for sharing !!!!!

Great recipe!  I've made a lot of these now, lately I make 1/3 of the flour whole wheat.  Makes a very nice tortilla.  The cast iron skillet is very key - as is only cooking on each side for about 30 seconds. ;)

Very good.  I used butter flavor shortening and mixed it with some of the flour in a food processor.  The tortillas tasted great, but only made 1/3 of what it was supposed to, so I probably didn't roll them thin enough.  Great when you run out of tortillas! (like I did)

I was very afraid that these were going to be dry and stiff...and not roll worth a darn. But they came out soft and moist...sooo delicious with some fajita mixture! What a great (and cheap!) alternative to storebought tortillas! A definite keeper in my book!

If you are up to the work of making your own tortillas this recipe will not let you down.  My family was very impressed with the taste and texture as was I.  I too substituted olive oil for the lard and used whole wheat flour.  They were amazing, WAY better than store bought especially since I try to avoid bleached flours entirely.

Outstanding flavor!  My husband thought i should open  restaurant with these.  The only thing is as divided this makes very SMALL tortillas.  We like ours a little bigger, so I used more dough per tortilla.

These were so easy to make, especially compared to other tortilla recipes I have used, and they turned out great. I used shortening instead of lard, and i added about a tsp of sugar for extra flavor. I made 1/4 of this recipe because I was only preparing these for my boyfriend and I, it made 4 small tortillas, although next time I will just halve it and make larger tortillas. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I was a little hesitant to try this at first. I had been wanting to find a homeade tortilla recipe, as the ones in the bag are full of preservatives, but I thought they would be difficult to make. Not so! These were easy and delicious. There was none of that funky aftertaste you always get with the premade, bagged variety. I did use shortening instead of lard, but that was because I didn't want to buy a bunch of lard that I would never use. I halved the recipe and got 8 10 inch tortillas. I will NEVER again buy these from the store.

These tortillas are amazing! It was my first attempt at tortillas and it was a success.  Very easy and tasty recipe.  I cooked them in an iron skillet.  I will never buy tortillas at the grocery store again.  My purpose in making them at home is to cut down on preservatives so this will be my new go-to recipe!  Thank you!

I loved these, but I had to add way more lard than the recipe. I made a half recipe and used 3 TBS, so triple the amount called for. Other than that, absolutely delicious and EASY. Don't sub for the lard, it really makes a difference.

This was so easy to make and delicious. I loved not having to let them rest before cooking them. Easy to roll out and were delicious in Burrito Pie from this web-site! I'm keeping this one. Has to be the best and easiest tortilla recipe I have done! :-)

I just made these & they were good. Used canola oil because I didn;t have lard, and warm water. I quartered the recipe and made 6 thin 7-inch rounds. Will post picture next time I make them. Will try olive oil next time. Very easy!

These were pretty easy, and had great texture and taste.  I made these because I always end up throwing away half the package of bought tortillas, and by making them myself I can control what goes in them.  Will make again.

This is a good recipe. If it doesn't turn out well for you then here are some tips: Use Bread flour. Use a stand mixer with a dough hook and let it knead the dough for 10 minutes. Thinner is better. the thinner you roll out your dough the more bubbly it gets. When they are done cooking place them under a damp cloth.

I have made this recipe 3 times now and I love it! The first time I made it, they ended up a bit dry and cracked, so I just threw a few dampened paper towels in the ziploc with them and they turned soft and pliable. I use a food scale to make them all the same size and I use a big skillet and cook 3 at a time so it takes me about an hour from start to finish. I have found that if I cook them a little less than I think I need to, they end up soft. I store them in the fridge with a few damp paper towels and they are good for a little over a week (if they last that long!) I also use Crisco instead of lard as that's what I have in the house and they work perfectly. I will never buy store bought again!

I made this recipe exactly as described.  The tortillas came out brittle and dry. I believe the recipe here should use much more lard (just over 1/2 cup is needed for 2 cups of flour), hot water, and include a 15 to 20 minute resting period for the dough before it is cut into the smaller balls.

I found this recipe to be WONDERFUL! I am very, very picky about tortillas, as the ones I buy in the store feel too dry or they are just too small. With this recipe, I made about 35 decently sized tortillas and they taste delicious! Instead of the lard I used margarine, the only solid "fat" I had in the house at the time. I am looking forward to experimenting with this recipe, possibly making a more dessert-oriented version with cinnamon and a hint of sugar in them for apple filled tortillas.

I followed the recipe exactly but my tortillas came out crunchy? Also when put on the pan the tortilla would have just one large bubble! It was like a ball and I had to flatten it with my spatula...Not sure what I did wrong here.

Just made sixteen tortillas with this recipe, instead of 24. A little more like gorditas.They are better than any name brand tortilla at the grocers.Cheaper,if you don't mind a little work. Generic flour is about $2.69 for five pounds. Ten or twelve 6" store tortillas are about $1.29.
They don't have to be perfectly round either. They look more rustic and authentic.

Super good recipe.  I changed a few things, not much, mainly I put in 4 T butter flavored Crisco and processed it all in the food processor. My MIL always told me to knead them for 2 minutes, roll into balls, and let rest for 10 minutes.  SOOO...since she use to be the food editor for the "New Mexico Magazine", I am following her advise.  
The best compliment that I got from my sweetie, was that they tasted like his mom's tortillas.  Since my MIL passed in 2012, that is high praise from him.
Make sure when you are rolling them out that you turn the tortilla 45 degrees each time you roll it out.  That gives you a nice round tortilla and not the state of Texas!! (No offense to any Texans who read this).

WONDERFUL recipe!  I had never made tortillas before so this was all new to me.  I was inspired to make these by Deb C's photo.  Reading her review I followed her lead and made it in my food processor.  It was so easy.  I watched the video because I wasn't sure how to cook them.  I didn't know if I should oil the pan or not.  Answer "no".  When it came time for clean up, and I did make a huge mess, I remembered Marianne's tip of using cold water NOT hot when cleaning up flour.  It made clean up so easy.  Hubby was the first to try these and after first bite he said, "Oh you're gonna like this!"   I DID!  The nice part is I have plenty left over.  Thank you La Donna for sharing such a WONDERFUL recipe!

This was a great, fast and simple recipe. Thank you for sharing it. I altered it a little to suit my family. We don't use lard, shortening, or margarine, so I substituted 1/2 C Butter instead. I also used 3C white whole wheat flour, 1C All purpose flour, and added the water a little at a time. I'm glad I did because I ended up using almost 1/4c less water than called for. I live in a very humid climate so that might account for it. I should have rolled them out a little thinner but they came out soft and had a much nicer flavor than store bought. I think this is a new family favorite!

OK ladies, here goes...I did not intentionally want to sub ingredients, but I did not have shortening, lard, or even margarine or butter!  I really wanted to make these so I subbed what I had on hand....COCONUT OIL! I did put in the freezer to harden for a bit so it would not be soft or oily. It took just a little more mixing with my fingers to break it down, but my husband who is (very) Mexican could not tell the difference. There really was no difference in taste and I actually liked the taste better. The only thing I would do next time is add just a tad more salt.  My tortillas were soft, pliable and easy to handle.  I did use 1/2 CUP of the coconut oil because that is usually what I add when I have made tortillas before.  I also sprinkle flour on my acrylic cutting board where I make tortillas so they will not stick.  This is THE BEST recipe for homemade flour tortillas that I have found and better than my previous recipe.  I will be making this recipe again and again (with my coconut oil sub I believe). Thanks LaDonna!

These are amazing! Best tortillas ever!!!:) Make sure if you're making these to roll the dough out really thin because the tortillas thicken when they cook. Great recipe!!

I am someone that loves to make everything from scratch... I make my own chicken stock, yogurt, granola, etc etc, but for some reason it has never occurred to me to make tortillas. So of course, I had to make them right away and I'm glad I found this recipe.  I loved these! They're so easy to make.  I wasn't about to go buy some lard, so I ignored the description and used shortening like many other reviewers did.  Perhaps they would be better with the lard, but they were great with shortening.  This recipe makes 24 taco-sized tortillas (about 6" when rolled out).  They don't need long to cook, you're really just warming them up:  I probably cooked them no more than 20 seconds per side.  They're so much better than store bought!  I'll definitely make them again.  Next time I want to try and steam them like they do in restaurants so they're nice and moist.  Thanks for the recipe!

EXCELLANT. This is super easy. My husband is from Latin America and loves corn tortillas but I hate them and this is a perfect compromise I am more than willing to make. And for those doubters out there that say there is little difference between this and store bought...do not listen to them! Store bought white tortillas never go bad, do you want to eat something that never goes bad?   This is fresh and yummy!

Delicious! The tortillas were on the small side even when I rolled them out as thin as I could. Slightly dry. Next time I will add more water or a tiny bit more shortening, but overall these beat store bought tortillas any day!

I make this, but I add canned coconut milk instead of water, margerine instead of lard, and 1/2 cup of regular sugar. When its cooked you eat it with any spread of your preference. We prefer eating it with margerine while it is still warm.

Not being a tortilla maker, I had no guidelines to follow except the instructions.  Sometimes, watching how something is done is a better teacher than reading about how to do it.  Some of my tortillas were like soft wraps, some like crispy crackers, depending on how thin I rolled them out.  I will add more salt next time, less flour so they are not so tough, and make them thicker, to use as wraps.

These are to die for!  My 5 year old helped me through the entire process and she rolled them so perfectly thin. I thought it would be challenging to make these but honestly, they're dead simple. I substituted shortening for the lard and then used hot water. I also added a bit more salt. So easy and fun, I'll definitely be making these again!

I used to work at the local Taco Joint ". (South of the Border) and this is the recipe we used to make our shells.  Many would come in just to buy our naked shells to put their own fillings in. Their perfect with any sandwich filling

We made them a little thicker, more like a pita, and they were AMAZING!!!! If they were easier to make I'd do this all the time, they are extremely time consuming just for part of a dish, but definitely worth it for special occasions. It says no substitutions for lard, but we used butter and it worked perfectly! Made them to go with a recipe on here "Chili Potato Burritos". HEAVENLY :)

I used Crisco vs. lard. I made 16 vs. 24, which I think are a much burrito size. I think if I had made 24 they would have been a soft taco size.

What a wonderful recipe! Made a half-batch using shortening and hot water, and it produced 6 8-10" tortillas. As a tip to those who may be having difficulties getting a nice thin tortilla: flip the dough several times while rolling out, and make sure you flour the board and the rolling pin for each one. These are amazingly easy and delicious!

best I have ever made!  I halved the recipe and used canola oil instead of lard and made 8 soft taco sized tortillas.  Mine were thick enough to be chewy but not like bread.  Perfect in my book and my kids ate them right away.  They were easy to make and loved how quick it was (no waiting)  Next time I wont be halving and will probably be doubling  :)

The best and the easiest I have ever made!  This dough was a dream to work with, and I did sub Crisco for the lard.  Rolling them thin enough isn't a concern - you can lay one on the back of your hand and stretch it out to be larger while you are cooking one in the pan.  Makes for a quick little assembly line and awesome tortillas.  My husband and daughter said they were the best they have ever had.  I would compare these to the fresh tortillas made in Old Town San Diego on Taco Tuesdays!  Thanks so much!

Delicious!!  Subbed margarine for the lard and they turned out great.  They are a little sticky so be prepared with a well floured board.

These are awesome. I never made tortillas before, and I would have no idea what "good" ones should taste like, be these are fantastic! I didn't use lard. I did use margarine. I'm sure they'd be even better with lard, but what isn't?

I gave this recipe 3 stars since I substituted shortening for the lard but these were really bad.  The dough was way to sticky.  I added extra flour while rolling them out but they just turned into dry pucks.  Next time I will use the lard and more of it; less water.

Great recipe. Wish I had the margarine to use as a lard substitute instead of shortening and they would be even chewier. Delicious!

Excellent! Used slightly less water than called for otherwise would have been too sticky.Use lots of flour when rolling out to make nice and thin. I used Crisco but I believe any butter type ingredient would work great. I think melodyanne over-cooked hers because mine came out nice and soft.Just leave until bubbles appear, flip and you're done.So easy! Never buying the store tortillas again. YUM!!!

Delicious! I substituted unsalted butter for the lard and used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 3 cups of unbleached, all purpose flour.  I also used my food processor to mix the dough~easy! I was able to get 16 8" tortillas out of this recipe. Thank you!

This is the best tortilla recipe Ive tried so far! I advise you roll them out as thin as you can without ripping them they cook better on the grittle and have a nice stretchy texture =)

Like some of the others, I could not get the dough rolled out thin enough. I'm not complaining though. I just pretended that I did it on purpose, and made falafel instead. ;0)

These came out great!  I tried another tortilla recipe and the tortillas were tough the next day..  This recipe seemed to be fine and reminds me of my grandmothers homemade tortillas.  The trick is to really knead the dough.  Your arms will be very tired, unless you use a bread machine or mixer.  Maybe, I will try my bread machine next time!  The was easy to roll out and very simple to make.

What a great recipe!  I can't get fresh tortillas here so this is probably the most useful recipe possible for me because I LOVE mexican food.  I am not a baker at all and they came out right every time I made them.  Thanks so much!

These were really easy and good. They didn't have much flavor, but were nicer than the store bought.  Followed the recipe to a T, and placed between a damp dishcloth to keep warm. Looking for a recipe that tasted like the tortillas mom used to make... but maybe it's just because SHE made them that they tasted so good!!

I loved these tortilla easy and tasty. What more can you asked for. The first time I tried these I used regular flour the next time I substituted 1 cup of regular flour with whole wheat flour. Maybe next time I will try all whole wheat :) Oh yeah I used butter instead of lard since I almost  never have lard in the house.

These are wonderful....I put the dry ingredients in my food processer pulsed a couple times then added shortening (didn't have lard) and gradually added water.  The only problem I had was getting a round tortilla...I had every other shape but round.  I will keep practicing.

i ran out of time while cooking and wrapped the remainder of the dough in plastic wrap and placed in a tupperware in the fridge for a couple days.  when i was able to finish them a couple days later, i let the dough warm to room temp and tried re-rolling, and they came out perfect!  much easier to roll,  better consistency and better flavor... will refrigerate to dough from now on  :)

Only cook for 5-10 seconds on each side - worth trying, quick and easy.  Rolled out as thin as possible and it was still to thick - next time will run through our pasta machine (but will end up more rectangle shaped).

This was my first attempt at tortillas.  I was pretty excited to try bc I've had them fresh-made in CA.  The first few looked good, but weren't flexible when cooled.  They were as thin as the ones you buy in the store.  The next few I tried were much better.  I made them about 1/8 inch thick and didn't cook them until they had brown bubbles.  With this method, the recipe would make fewer/smaller ones.  I would definitely try them again.  I might try adding another tablespoon of lard.  (4 cups is alot of flour!)   Oh, and I found that I needed to wipe the excess flour from the pan after about 5 tortillas, otherwise it began to smoke.  And, I didn't worry about making perfect circular shapes =)

I made these with margarine instead of lard (against the recipe-creator's advice) because I had no lard, and the stores were closed. As it turns out, margarine was useable, but I think they'd be a bit easier to knead and be tastier if you used lard.  I halved the recipe it gave me 12 of the smaller-sized (8-10") tortillas. After I kneaded the dough out, I kind of rolled it into a rough log shape and sliced it into 12 equal pieces. I think this helped when it came to making them equal in size and fairly round. I used a marble rolling pin, and had no trouble flattening them out.  The only complaint I got was that they were too flour-y (this was my fault in perhaps being too generous with the flour when rolling out). I will try to get rid of excess flour and use lard next time.

Wow, I'm pleasantly surprised. They taste very good! I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose flour and it worked out great. I also used margarine instead of lard, used a but more than it says. I didn't have lard so that's why I used butter, worked great. I also used hot water instead of cold and that worked great too! The only thing I have to say is that It takes time to make them (rolling them out) and if you leave them in the skillet too long they turn hard and break easily.

These were fantastic! I am a vegetarian so I used vegetable shortening. Came out perfect! I will never buy store bought tortillas again! I will also invest in a tortilla press because it was a bit time consuming trying to roll them out thin.

Just made these and they really are good!  I was a little skeptical only using 2 Tbspns shortening to 4 cups of flour, but they turned out great.  I got 16 tortillas from this recipe.  My family raved about them!

It never occured to me to make my own tortillas until it was one of the Daily Dish recipes that are emailed every day.  I was very impressed with how easy these are to make.  At 1st I didn't think there was enough shortening called for, but trusted the recipe anyway and went ahead with it.  It turned out fine and made the medium sized tortillas you'd buy in the store.  I doubt that I'll go back to buying them now, these are just too easy to do it yourself.  It might be fun now to try making different flavours like they have in the store.

Very easy and so economical! I used my pasta roller to roll out very thin, then finished shaping them with a rolling pin before putting in an ungreased stainless steel pan. (I did not have cast iron) Thanks!

These were wonderful! I did substitute shortening for the lard and put in a little bit of leftover bacon grease for flavor.   The key I found to making them was to roll them out thiner than you want them to end up, then cook them. My first one puffed up considerably, so I ate it, and rolled the next one thiner. =)

These were great, and it gave me such pleasure to actually make tortillas myself!!  I would tweak this just a lil next time though, due to lack of flavor - also, the tortillas need either something lightly brushed onto them before cooking or the flour brushed off of them afterwards because it wasn't nice eating a taco that had excess flour on the outside....eee.  All in all - great.  Thanks so much!!

These are awesome.  I followed the recipe almost exactly--shortening instead of lard, as others noted, and a bit more water (we must live in a drier climate--not all my flour hydrated with just the 1 1/2 c. water).  We don't have a tortilla warmer, so I put them between 2 damp towels and misted every so often with a spray bottle (that's how I make my lefse).  After they "steamed" in this after coming off the griddle, they got lovely and soft and everyone loved them.

The whole family loved these!  I used shortening as I don't keep lard around and they turned out great.  I found that using your fingers to mix the ingredients together works best.  I used a couple of skillets to make cooking them faster.  It helps to mist the tortillas with a bit of water before cooking to keep any flour from sticking to the skillet and browning/burning.

This is the same recipe I was taught growing up. You can sub shortening for the lard as long as it's not all-vegetable. Under no circumstance try to use oil. For special occasions we would do these with 1/2 lard and 1/2 unsalted butter. It is still the best recipe.

My mother's recipe to the letter! My mother made 52 dozen tortillas a week for her friends. She was known as the tortilla lady and this is exactly the ingredients she used. Delicious! Especially when they are hot off the grill with butter slathered on them!!!!

These are really fabulous!  The only thing I changed was to use vegetable shortening instead of lard so these would be vegetarian.  Really soft & as a bonus, easy to make!  I love that I know all the ingredients in my tortillas now, and I can control how much salt & fat is added.  I will try whole wheat next!

This recipe is perfect my husband and daughter loved it. My mom makes homemade tortillas all the time and these taste very similar to my mom's. Just make sure your skillet is on medium/high and you're good.

I have wrote about this recipe once , before .We roll them out and cut into wedges and deep fry them , they are great this way , however , I've always used crisco , instead of the lard , well I tried the lard , and made "chips" like usual , and they appeared to be much greasier , so if anyone read my old review , use Crisco for making nacho chips with them , much better !!!!

Well.. I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised at how well these turned out.  I cut the recipe down to six servings and it made 6 perfect sized tortillas.  I tried using the Pam as one other reviewer noted but that didn't work at all.  I just lightly dusted my counter top with flour and rolled those puppies out very thin.  I cooked them for about 3 minutes on each side and they were the perfect consistancy.  I used tri-tip leftovers to make some fajitas and the tortilla held up very well with all the wet ingredients.  I can't promise I won't buy tortillas again but these certainly do when you don't want to go to the store but want some mexican food :)  Thank you LaDonna for this easy, authentic tasting tortilla recipe.

First, there was way way too much flour. I still had lots of flour left over and it was exceptionally dry. Secondly, I have no idea how you're supposed to get 24 pieces out of it, you're gonna have tortillas the size of drink coasters. The ones I managed to make, which were pretty dry due to all the flour, had to be rolled paper thin and due to the elastic dough, was pretty difficult too. They tasted good but it didn't really work out the way it should have.

So I know the recipe writer says not to use vegetable oil, but that's what I've used. I use avocado oil because I'm allergic to lard (alph-gal allergy. ask google about it). I love this recipe so much and haven't had an issue by not using lard. We make this for our friends and have tacos.

Excellent recipe! However, after reading other reviews as the amount of butter just didn’t seem right, so I followed another reviewer and threw in 1/2 cup butter. So much yes!

Awesome recipe. Snowed in and needed tortillas for breakfast (It's -54° with windchill today here in Wisconsin). Had to use margerine stick as I had no lard. I put extra salt in it like others reccomend: I do not recommend. I did however use hot water as suggested by others and it came out well.  They rolled out nice and thin, and had lots of elasticity. I burnt a few as I am new to gas top stoves (The knobs don't have settings), but most came out lovely. Great recipe! Will use again and again.
***side note (rant): if you use substitutions/alterations in a recipe, it is not fair to give that recipe a bad review if it doesn't come out well. Once you start adding and taking away from the recipe, it becomes 'Your' bad recipe. I see it all the time and it bugs me. 
A fictional example:

"Terrible Recipe! I substituted flour with wheat and rye flour. Used rice oil instead if lard. Used milk instead of water and skipped the salt. Came out like pancake batter! Terrible texture. Will not use this recipe again!"

Do you see what I mean? It isn't fair to the creator. #rantover

These made the best breakfast wraps!

I opted to use olive oil in place of the lard, and they came out perfectly pliable and flavored.

First time making tortillas and it was pretty easy! I have a tortilla press but they ended up being pretty thick (weird) and more Naan-like so I just ended up rolling them super thin with a roller. Turning it an 1/8 of a turn each time I rolled kept them relatively circular. Whenever they stuck to the counter it misshaped so keep it well floured. I used shortening since I don't have any lard and they were soft. Would like to try with coconut oil next time and see if that create the same results. Flavor was good, but I've never had fresh tortilla for a comparison. Cooked for a couple minutes each side on a dry cast iron skillet.

Turned out really well.... think I'd add a bit more lard next time as the flour didn't seem to become "like corn meal" as in recipe. 
Will make again

These are the best tortillas I have made from scratch. Here are my tips for making them successfully:

-Have patience and be persistent. I tried these many times without success, but I kept trying and finally got them right. They are worth it. I have found that I cannot be in a hurry to make these. If I don't take my time they will not turn out great. 

-Absolutely do not substitute shortening for the lard. The texture and taste will not be right. 

-Mix the lard very well. If you think you have mixed it well enough, keep mixing for a few minutes longer still. Getting the lard well mixed is crucial. 

-Use lukewarm water. 

-Mix by hand and adjust the amount of water, if needed. Sometimes I use up to 1/4 cup less than what is called for. 

-For taco size tortillas, split into 24. For burrito size (my preference) split into 16 balls of dough. If you have a tortilla press, use it. 

-When rolling these out, keep work surface and rolling pin very well floured. Use a lot of pressure on the pin to get them thin. The thinner they are the better. Rotate 90° every few rolls to get a more circular shape. 

-I use a 12" stainless steel skillet and do not add oil to cook these. On my stove, I find that they cook best on 6, which is just over medium heat. They do not take long per side. They need to be flat and not wrinkled going in. Over cooking will make them brittle and too chewy. It's best to have help with this part. One person to keep a close watch on these and cook them just right

The recipe is perfect as is with no messing around. It's quick and easy to set up, though you need to set aside quite a bit of time for rolling out and frying the individual tortillas.

As written, however, the recipe really lacks the details needed on how to actually make them properly. My first batch came out kinda mediocre because of not rolling properly nor cooking long enough or quite hot enough. It took some experimentation to figure out the way to actually do so properly.

In practice, I would suggest cutting the number of balls down to about 18 from 24, making each about a third larger. The second thing to suggest is to make sure you roll them out as flat as you can get them, then lift, turn 90 degrees and repeat - if you don't lift the tortillas in between each rolling, they will not stretch any further. You absolutely have to lift them regularly! Third, I  had to turn my heat up a notch past med-high because it wasn't quite hot enough, and the actual cook time took about 45 seconds for the first side, and 30 for the second side. You'll know when they're ready on the first side because it'll start getting really big air bubbles really fast... like up until 35 seconds, virtually zero air bubbles at all, then some at 40, and boom, huge by 45. Your oven may vary for the times, but it's really visually obvious when they're actually done. Like there's not a lot of wiggle room for timing. If you cook any less than that, they come out very rubbery rather than like proper to

The lard ratio is SO wrong.

Ok - we made a batch this way, and made CRACKERS.

We made a batch with 1 c of lard instead of 2 T and got a GREAT result.

DO NOT BE AFRAID OF LARD!!!

I grew up being the flipper! So for that being said I've watched my mother make these a million times, problem was I never had a way to make them for a family of 3!  This recipe were the same ingredients my mom used. My tortillas came out hard and it didn't work.  Not nearly enough salt than what I like in my tortilla, oh! I did do 1 1/2 tsp on the salt too.  I believe that it needs more lard too...2 tbs for me didn't work.  I did mix that by hand as I've seen my mother do prior to the mixer.  I only used the mixer for the hot water part.  This and mac and cheese is my goal to concur! lol...sometimes I need to just keep going and going until it's right...but I'm about on 6 times with mac and cheese and haven't got it down yet.

I make this with fresh ground hard red wheat flour and hard white wheat flour (1/2 & 1/2 mix).  I will have to try it with only 1 teaspoon of salt the other recipe I found first had 2 teaspoons in it.  The secret is to kneed the dough for about 4 mins or so.  I could not figure out what I was doing wrong until my mom help ed me make the dough one day.  When I asked her what she did she said you have to kneed the dough.  They have turned out perfect ever since and don't stick to my tortilla maker.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I cut the recipe in a quarter and it made 3 big tortillas :)
My husband and almost-two-year-old loved them!
I used canola oil instead of the lard (we don't eat lard) they were awesome.

I'll never be allowed to buy store-bought tortillas again...
Thanks for the great easy recipe

I thought they were pretty easy to make.  Family thought they could have used a bit more salt.  The texture was great.  My son had fun rolling them out, next time we'll focus on ROUND tortillas.

I would add use a patterned towel to roll on, when you can see the pattern through the dough it is thin enough. Make sure to brush off all loose flour. I find a well seasoned iron skillet works best. You need to wipe out the pan of extra flour now and then too.

Amazing! First time I've ever made tortillas. Followed the recipe except instead of water I used chicken broth and the lard I used some apple wood smoked bacon lard I had in the fridge. Used three tablespoons intend of two. The tortillas turned out amazing! We will be making more of these.

I've made this recipe countless times and it's great..the lard amount is perfect (I use Crisco veg shortening for vegetarians).  For a variation I use 3 cups flour and 1 cup masa which gives it that corn flavour but with the softness of a flour tortilla.  I use my KitchenAide with the paddle to mix dry ingredients and then cut the shortening in and switch to the kneading attachment when adding the water.Make sure you let the dough rest for 30 minutes.  I cut them into 12's because I like them bigger for fajitas.   I use 2 pans on medium-high heat so I can make them faster and IMMEDIATELY place in a large freezer bag so they stay moist until dinner.  Muy Delicioso!

I've made these a few times now and they are always delicious. I follow the recipe but use Crisco butter-flavored shortening instead of lard (I've never bought lard so maybe i am missing out?) and I make 18-20 to get them a little thicker. One tip - if you shake the flour off before popping in the skillet they cook and taste better. These are great warm but just as good the next day. I store mine in the fridge.

i used vegetable shortening instead of lard as i have a daughter who is vegetarian and these have turned out fine I did let the dough rest 20 mins after needing before rolling out for tortillas and that seems to help reduce how much they shrink up when i lift them up

I made these the other night, I didn't have any lard, so I substituted with Crisco, they came out so good, I was told to "not to buy any from the store again" 
We used some  that night for fajitas, and some for sandwiches for the next  2 days....!
Needless to say, this recipe is a win!

Easy, nice taste & quick!  Be sure to do the moist towel wrapped around each (I used moist paper towels) or they will get hard very quickly.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe & I think it is very good!

I personally have never made tortillas from scratch before and these turned out beautifully. They almost looked store bought once I was finished. I did not use the lard because I did not have any on hand so I substituted it with margarine. I was also planning on using them for quesadillas so I didn't separate the dough into 24 balls. They would have been too small so instead I was able to make 16 six to eight inch tortillas using the full recipe. Oh and make sure that you use HOT WATER when mixing. It makes a big difference. I highly recommend this recipe!

Realized I ran out of tortillas after my husband took the car. Just made these with margarine as that is all I had in the house and the ONLY problem I have is the fact that I don't think my son will EVER settle for store bought again! Can't wait to try it with lard, I bet they will be out of this world!

Simple, easy and WAY better than store bought.  Hubby loved them. I was out and we wanted to make breakfast burritos for dinner.  I looked up the recipe, had the ingredients and it didn't take anytime at all.  I made the whole recipe and have some stored in the fridge. I did not have lard, had a stick of vegetable shortening but didn't want to use it because of all the hydrogenated garbage in it, so I used organic butter (about 2 1/2 tablespoons) in the recipe. It turned out fine.  Organic flour, sea salt, aluminum free baking powder and organic butter.  Now those are ingredients I can live with and much healthier and tastier than store bought!

Not enough lard - tortillas were too brittle and thick, not soft and thin as they should be. Also, hot water should been used when mixing.

A quick and easy way to make delicious tortillas. The family loved them. I halved the recipe: 1/2 flour and 1/2 whole wheat. The flour half tasted better and had a lighter texture. Whole wheat was okay if you don't mind the grittiness.  I will be using this recipe again soon.

I can't believe that it is this easy to make tortillas, even without a tortilla press!  The dough is so easy to work with!  I did not have any problems rolling the dough out paper-thin using only a rolling pin and without additional dusting of flour.  I also love that the recipe calls for very little fat.  I used palm oil & coconut oil blend instead of lard and the recipe still worked!  This recipe is excellent and makes delicious, soft and tender tortillas which are definitely much better than those bought at the store.  Because they are quite easy to make, I will no longer purchase commercial tortillas! :-)

In spite of the warning in the recipe, I subbed the lard with about 1 Tbsp of canola oil and 1 Tbsp of olive oil with delicious results.  It honestly wasn't too bad to work with (after my substitution), and I found that once I allowed the dough to rest I was able to make very large, very thin tortillas (fewer calories) without tearing them in the process, they were super-stretchy and forgiving.  Even when these thinner tortillas were full of taco toppings they didn't tear.  This is an awesome recipe and I highly recommend it, I will never use another tortilla recipe.  I did find that the recommended size of the dough balls was too small for my family's tastes, so next time I will cut the yield and make fewer dough balls.  I used some of the leftover cooked tortillas to make cinnamon and sugar rollups for dessert.

This was fantastic! I loved how quick this recipe was! The first batch I made I halved the recipe and used butter instead of lard. The second batch I still subbed butter but made the whole batch. Both turned out wonderfully! I, like other reviewers, was not able to get 24 tortillas from this recipe. I got 18 and they were a bit thicker and more bread-y. I now realize I could make the balls much smaller but I actually really liked them thicker. Will be making again!

Easy and yummy! I didn't have lard so I used butter, doubling it to 4 tbs. Way cheaper than store bought and just as good!

Very good recipe! I used coconut oil instead of lard (1/4 cup) and 2 tsp. of himalayan salt, and they turned out very good. Got my kids and husbands seal of approval. I will save this recipe and use again :)

I had no lard and used 4 tbsp of softened margarine instead. I followed the rest of the recipe as written and came out with a wonderful dough.  It was a tiny bit sticky as I was first kneading but, as soon as I placed it on a floured surface and began kneading then it was fine.  Rolling it out was fine for me.  I did not separate into individual balls...I rolled out big pieces and then took a large sized salad/soup bowl to make the circles which helped in 2 ways.  1-the edges were clean and 2-after you cut around the bowl the tortilla itself "sticks" to the bowl so it keeps it's shape on the way to the pan.  I also cooked mine in a pizza pan using a tiny bit of stick spray.  They came out crisp and flavorful.  I also added grated cheese into my dough because we were making quesadillas, and that was great.  I am going to use the same dough tomorrow morning adding cinnamon sugar and icing and making breakfast tortillas.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I made the dough in the food processor. Easy dough to work with.The hardest part was getting them rolled out in a circle. Most of them came out rectangular. Next time I will remember to shake off the flour as it burned on to the pan. Despite all this they taste good and saved a trip to the store. I halved the recipe and got 8, 8" tortillas.

Must use lard!  Honestly, I've made them with veggie shortening, and with butter, and with lard.  ALTHOUGH the recipe works with shortening, it's elevated to a different level with lard.  I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.  I've used it over 5 times now, even at a dinner party.  Sometimes I cut the recipe in half.  Easy, delicious, and there's no added sugar like in grocery store tortillas.

I always felt that making homemade flour tortillas would be too much work and too time consuming. Boy, was I wrong! I halved the recipe (only three of us for dinner) and I have to say that this recipe exceeded my expectations in every way. I made the tortillas earlier in the day and then reheated them by placing in a ziplock bag and microwaving on medium for 40 seconds. Everyone commented on how delicious they tasted. I'm never buying them again! Thank you for this excellent recipe :)

made these at a friends house and they were simply to make.  I have never been a huge fan of using shortening, so I used olive oil and they worked well for me.  I did drizzle a little bit more oil as it didn't look crumbly enough, but using the oil worked well. I would make these again

We use this recipe any time we want tacos now. Its quick, easy and tastes way better than those you find on the grocery store shelves. Biggest advantage for me: they are low sodium so I can enjoy tacos again. We make a recipe and divide them into round balls which we then freeze. Easy to get out the number we need for the next meal, thaw and cook. Excellent recipe.

I have tried for years to replicate my grandmothers tortillas. And this is by far the closest thing to them! I do add a tbsp of powder milk to mine I think it makes them softer.

I have prepared this recipe three times and believe I have now perfected it! The only substitution I made was shortening for the lard (lard isn't available where I live). With this recipe, I made roughly 16 tortillas instead of 24. If you are having trouble with rolling out the dough thin enough, LET IT REST! That was my problem the first two times. The third time I let the dough rest twice; first after kneading, and second after weighing out the dough balls. If you are going to let it rest, be sure to cover it with a damp towel to prevent the surface from drying out. Letting it rest made it extremely easy to roll out thinly.

Cool seasonal idea... roll and cut with cookie cutters then cook as directed. They make great dipping crackers and are also delicious with just cinnamon on them (my son's idea). Much better than sugar filled cookies and a fun holiday tradition!

I did not follow the recipe exactly because of my Gluten sensitive stomach and husband's vegan preference.  I substituted peanut oil for the Lard and used spelt flour.  I also used 1 tablespoon baking powder and I placed  2 tsp of salt in warm water to dissolve the salt. Finally, after mixing the dough, I let it set for one hour.  I don't know what allowing the dough to set for 60 minutes does, but it was much easier to handle the dough after it sets than trying to work with it after mixing. For extra flavor I place in 1 tsp of Italian Herbs and Rosemary in the mixture before cooking.  Much much better than anything in the stores with all the preservatives.

My child says these are the best tortillas ever.  Even better than the fresh ones in the restaurant.  I tried using part whole wheat flour but the texture and flavour was off.  Making it with all white was better (not healthier but yummier) and I too used vegetable shortening and hot water.  I just cook them on my electric griddle and they come out perfectly.  This recipe is a keeper!

I thought these were really yummy and they are so much better then store bought. The only problem I had was I kept getting them a little too thick because they would shrink back, then I realized I have to have my pan really hot and that seemed to work. But even the thick one I just ate by itself when it was warm and I really liked it. Good snack :) oh and I used shortening instead of lard because I didn't want to run to the store.

This recipe is simple and easy to follow. I used vegetable shortening and it turns out well. The first tortilla I made, it came out a bit stiff. So I let the dough rest for atleast 30minutes and the second tortilla came out perfect, it was soft and chewy! Is it safe to store the remaining dough in a fridge for a week? How about in a freezer?

I do use shortening and it comes out fine.
Don't make the mistake of using water that is too hot- it makes glue. But warm water works well.

I also use olive oil (stir it in before the water) and these come out great. I think if it is a stiff tortilla it was either cooked too long, too high heat, or too much flour was used. These are great because you don't need to put so much fat in them.

I usually make 1/2 as many as indicated preferring a thick tortilla.

My daughter is on a whole grain, no fat diet, so I substituted whole wheat bread flour for the all purpose white flour--and applesauce for the lard -- needed a bit more water than noted -- but it came out delicious!  I'm not good with breads..but this one was so easy!  Great recipe!

We used vegetable shortening and the result was delicious.  The texture was just like authentic tortillas.  We cooked them before lunch intending to use them for a taco dinner but I couldn't wait and ate 3 for lunch with salsa and hummus! This will become a staple for us since we cannot buy things like this in Tanzania.  I am going to try frying them up as well to see if I can produce good tortilla chips from them.

This recipe was fast and easy to make!  I've made them twice no use in buying from the store when you can make them fast and easy.  They stay soft and chewy.  The only thing i recommend would be to use the full recipe but make 12 large instead.  When making 24 they are a bit to small to fill. 

They taste great!

Absolutely delicious! Used veg short instead (no lard on hand) and they turned out fantastic.  Made less balls (about 16) and got bigger tortillas. Kids and hubby raved all night about them. Will make again! Thanks for the great recipe!! :)

I've made this recipe twice now - it's great!  I halved it both times.  The first time I followed the recipe to the letter, which turned out very good, but the second time I used extra lard and the tortillas were softer and easier to wrap. So my advice is to keep adding extra fat a little more at a time until you get the cornmeal/crumbly texture, if you're looking for more flexible rounds.

Almost, almost, almost like my mom use to make when I was a child. They were a bit thick, but that may have been because I didn't roll out very thin, but should have. I added enough shortening till flour crumbled up like making a pie crust. I would like a softer tortilla. Maybe adding more shortening/ or less. I need to refine, but its a good start.

I've made this twice and each time it's better. :-)  Thank you for all the reviews because without them, I wouldn't have tried it. I like to read them first before trying any recipe and even when negative, I learn from those so I won't make the same mistakes.

Have to agree with melodyanne. This recipe does need more lard but I found 4 Tbsp to be sufficient. It also works very well with expellar pressed coconut oil though you might want to add a little extra salt since you loose some flavor from the lard. Also, as others have said if you try to get 24 out of this they will be tiny. I get about a dozen nice big tortillas out of this recipe. One more point, let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes to make it easier to roll out.

My recipe is for every cup of flour, use 1 tsp baking powder and 1 TBSP shortening and 1/2 tsp salt.  Mix very well about 2-3 minutes.  Start adding hot water from the tap, it will usually take 1/2 cup of hot water.   At times, I use the 1/2 the wheat flour and 1/2 the flour and make wheat tortillas.  Let me know if they come out.

Amazing recipe. But after a few trials I tweaked it a bit:
Added more lard for a total of 3 tbsp 
Used really hot water (this way you get a stickyer dough) 

I would say this recipe makes approx 12-14 tortillas (Not 2 dozen)

I made this for my family tonight with fish tacos and everyone loved them.  The tortillas were the highlight.  I don't keep lard on hand so I used butter.  Used 3 Tbs. instead of 2Tbs.

I tried this recipe for the second time the other day (because the first time was a flop) and after reading some reviews AND watching the video, I decided to try half the recipe but used almost 1/2 cup of shortening. (I know, sounds like WAY too much, but trust me, it's worth it) plus I didn't have to grease my pan when I tried them. I got about 16 good sized tortillas. I like that you can make them as thick (more like pita bread or a good pizza crust) or thin as you want and they are still so good. They were definately best when first made, but that only tells me how many preservatives are in the store-bought ones. A little time consuming, but good things come to those who wait! So glad I tried these again. Thank you LaDonna!

It difficult when people rate a recipe based on the substitutions they have made.  So based on this recipe, I gave it a low rating because it needs more shortening/lard.  Otherwise, by adding the necessary ingredients, it is a simple to make recipe and the tortillas tasted great.  I used a stand mixer with a dough hook so no need to knead by hand.

Made them tonight and my family loved them.  I didn't have lard or shortening which is unusual so I improvised.  I keep bacon grease in the fridge and used that and butter and mixed with hot water as suggested in other reviews.  The dough was great to work with and I had a blast making them on my cast iron skillet.  I may never buy tortillas again!

I've never made tortillas before but have wanted to try my hand. I hate that the ones in the store are so overprocessed and getting to be expensive. I must say - these were a hit! I cut the recipe in half (just in case) and my husband, as well as myself, demolished these pretty quickly. I'll be making these again and again! Thank you!

Made this recipe today and was surprised how easy it was to make these tortillas. I didn't have lard so used shortening as suggested by other reviewers, other than that I followed the recipe exactly. The first few were not very circular, but they got better as I went along. They seemed crispy when I first took them off the grill and I thought I had done something wrong, but as I stacked them into the tortilla warmer (lined with damp paper towel) they softened up nicely. Good tasting and cheap - what more can you ask for? This is great for us since we live in a rural area, and it's a bit of a chore to have to "run into town" whenever we want something made with a tortilla.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. Will surely be making this again, and again.

This recipe is closest to what I used for over 50 years.  I learned it from an old mexican lady. She and I used crisco instead of lard, and worked the crisco in a little at a time as the dough was kneaded after all the other ingredients were mixed together, including the water.  These were served with an authentic homemade mexican pork chili.  As my family grew so did the recipes.  It took all day to make and serve a mexican meal. I love this recipe. It is perfect for a few people.  Much better than any store bought..

I don't know what I did wrong. Obviously something because there are so many good reviews here. I followed the recipe exactly but my tortillas ended up crispy-ish in the pan and doughy tasting. 2T of lard for 4 cups of flour doesn't seem like much. I'm going to try something else.

Very bland and dry. Tried cooking them at different temperatures and lengths of time, nothing worked. Ended up sending the husband to the store to buy pre-made tortillas.

went surprisingly quick.  Followed recipe.  Had enough time to halfway roll one before I flipped the first in the skillet, then finish the one in the skillet and repeat.  My rolling skills aren't the best, but my family didn't complain that they weren't round, per se.  The 7 year old girl keeps eating them plain.

These were great!  I didn't have lard, so I used butter, and it worked fine.

Un-freaking-believable! Neither of us in my home are fond of flour tortillas but we needed them to make a new wrap we'd been wanting to try, so I decided to make them myself rather than buying store-bought. I'm so glad I did! These are soooo good, you could easily eat them plain! And don't be afraid of consuming lard, it's a far more natural, and thus healthy, product than shortening. Thanks so much for an awesome recipe!

Love these tortillas!! I double it, though as these make small taco tortillas and I prefer large burrito size. The taste and texture of these are fantastic!!!

We can never go back to store bought tortillas! Also, if we roll it a bit thicker, it is a delicious substitute for Indian naan bread (topped with butter and garlic). Delicious!

I made it AS suggested.  Used the lard.  Used EXACTLY that amount of water.  UN believable!  I can't tell you how delicious this is!  Plan on fish tacos tonight, surprisingly pliable these things!  Cook a weee bit longer and they get crispy.  Then I added the cinnamon and sugar-my daughter was in awe!  The lard made them light and flaky and I think its the key.  Rolled out easily and I'm not sure I will ever buy them again.  MAKE THESE!!!

This recipe is great. It wasn't difficult, and although it was a bit time consuming, it was definitely worth it! A couple of things to mention: if you follow the recipe exactly, you end up with very small tortillas. After making a few small ones, I started combining two balls of dough into one and cooking them up. They were a bit *too* large that way. I would recommend making a few less tortillas than the recipe calls for so they're a better size. Also, these are difficult to get super thin. Mine ended up being a bit more bready, although I thought they were really good. I will definitely be making these again - they're really a step up from store-bought!

I made this again and loved them! I used coconut oil and warm water. I let the dough sit for more than 30 minutes because that's when I needed it. I squished the ball round with the bottom of my measuring cup to get the circle started and rolled them very thin. These were the best I've ever made, soft and more circular than normal. I'm not buying tortillas from the store again!

Tortillas have always been my personal Achilles heel. I eat them on a day to day basis, but when it comes to making them I never seem to get it right! This recipe, I found to be quite a bit easier to roll out than other ones I have tried. However, they are a bit on the bland side. I also want to mention that I may not be a fair judge. My husband's grandmother and my stepmom make the best tortillas I have ever tasted. The problem with it is, is the way the make tortillas, it's all by feel and not measurements so it's a bit hard when you don't know what you're feeling for! 

I think this is a good starter recipe for me and I will stick to it, maybe trying to tweek it a little flavor wise.

First timer here. Was pleasantly surprised at the ease and quickness of this recipe! After reading other reviews I decided to try halving the recipe and used vegetable shortening and warm water. Loved the final product...and my husband was pleasantly surprised too :) I divided my dough into 8 pieces and rolled them out into around 8" sized tortillas. I think I'll invest in a tortilla press to make the shaping process a bit easier and faster. A winner!

These cooked up pretty well! I agree with another review that dividing up the dough into 24 makes pretty small tortillas, so i just made a few less. Definitely comes out better if the tortillas aren't really thin. Got some crispy ones, but that may have been my error. Will definitely use this recipe again! :)

Great recipe!  My mother in law is Hispanic and makes amazing tortillas and sopapillas, but since she doesn't measure when she makes them I was looking for a recipe to use at home.  It took a little trial and error, but they turned out very well!  It was a bit too much water and I had to balance it out with more flour, but after overcooking the first one, I got the hang of cooking time and it was smooth sailing.  Very easy to make and I always have the ingredients on hand.  Oh, I also used shortening instead of lard.  Really great recipe!

These turned out great. I used vegetable oil and a 1:1 ratio for whole wheat/AP flour. I tend to like things a bit healthier. They were almost like my Nana's!

These were really good and easy to make.  I think they need a little more salt.  I also noticed they were very tough the next day, better fresh of the griddle.  Good recipe though, thanks!

Yum these were great! It made enough for dinner and had some left. So I cut in quarters, brushed with butter and sprinkled with cinnamon and suger. Baked at 400 about ten min until crisp. The kids want me to make them and never. It from the store again. These were super easy.

Fabulous! They are so easy and so delicious... my boyfriend has banned me from buying pre-made tortillas, and I can't say I blame him! :) I ran out of flour just short of the recipe once and used about a half a cup of corn flour (masa harina) mixed in with the flour and they still turned out perfect!

First time making them, ended up with 24 balls, but then combined them into 12 for decent sized tortilla.  Used a tortilla press vice rolling to have better circular shapes.  substituted smoked sea salt for enhanced flavoring.  turned out quite well for a beginner.

FANtastic tortillas.  Are they just like store-bought?  No.  They are fabulous, though, and contain waaaaay less sodium than the store-bought.  The main challenge with these is rolling them into a recognizable circle.  Practice makes perfect, though.  Thanks for the recipe, LaDonna!

My family loves tortillas for Mexican night or just for a late night quesidilla. We were on a budget this week so I looked up this recipe. Wow, amazing difference from store bought. The freshness and heartiness of a homemade tortilla cannot be beat. I used 1/2 wheat flour, less than twice as much salt, and 1/2 enriched flour as a previous member stated and also wiped the pan with a smidge of EVOO between tortillas as another member said.  What an amazing recipe, even with my lack of ability to create circular objects with a rolling pin. Thank you, my wife and two year old thank you as well.

Love this recipe.  Very easy.  The tortillas were very easy to roll out and cook.  The flavor was very good.  I used shortening.  Next time I am going to use my large pancake griddle to cook these.  I made larger tortillas, and this made 12.

My first attempt.  And it was a SUCCESS!!  I used butter shortening instead of lard, but I did everything else as written.  Now I know I will use and need to get a tortilla press. Thanks for sharing!!

Made these on the fly tonight, and they were great! Also made them thicker than it suggested, but they were soft and yummy.  Will be eating the leftovers tomorrow warmed with butter. :)

These are amazing simple to make and DELICIOUS. They are the tastiest tortillas I have ever eaten. I've already made this recipe twice. Once I made a mexican lasagna, the second time was for soft tacos. I froze a couple of the individual balls so next time, I can just pull them out and make how many I want. 
I did not make them super huge, and I got 22 the first time, and 24 the second. Awesome recipe!!

If only I could roll mine thinner...  I can't seem to roll them thin enough.  Perhaps if I decreased the baking powder.  A co-worker of mine, Spanish teacher, would make these and share them.  I enjoyed them plain.

These tortillas are just like my mom made us when we were kids. And they are like the ones grandma would make except she did not roll them out. She did hers by hand like a pizza maker would do except they were like big 12" + tortillas.

These are excellent!! I was looking for a tortilla recipe because all the store bought ones were so filled with junk and ingredients I couldn't pronounce when they were labeled "healthy". I used these for veggie wraps and they were fantastic!!! I made them with whole wheat flour and added a little garlic powder. Thanks so much, I won't be buying store bought again!!

I have never left a review before but have to after making tortillas for the first time last night.  These turned out great.  Only difference I made was added a little more lard, not quite 1/3 cup.  I will never use store bought again!

The tortillas came out brittle and hard right after I took them off the stove. They didn't get any bubbles and were tasteless. The dough was was very dry. It doesn't taste anything like real tortillas or even store bought.

Lets face it...I can't follow a recipe. The first time I made this, I subbed whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour, and despite the warning to only use lard, I subbed vegetable oil. They were easy to roll out, but they kind of puffed up fatter than I wanted them. My 2 year old loved them, but kept calling them pancakes...so I decided to try again without the baking powder, and everything else the same. MUCH better. I will do it like that from now on. So much better than store bought!

Wow I never knew making tortillas could be so easy!! I substituded the lard for margarine and it came out great. The dough was really easy to handle and didn't tear while rolling. Mine came out a little deformed but practice makes perfect! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!!

These are definitely 5+++ stars.  Amazing!!  Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out beautifully.  I've never made tortillas before.  After my first two, when I realized you have to roll them as thin as possible (don't skimp on the flour on your surface or your pin), they were perfect! Thin, toasty, chewy & delicious!  I might invest in a tortilla press because the only negative thing about this recipe was that it was time-consuming to roll out the tortillas as thin as they need to be.  If I had a press, I would never buy store bought tortillas again. Thank You!

Have never made my own tortillas but after buying homemade from Central Market in Austin, I came home to Chicago where you cannot find homemade and decided I had no choice. Store-bought tortillas are loaded with chemicals, have you ever looked at the ingredient list? This was the first recipe I tried! I have to say, make your own, it's SO EASY with flour, baking powder, salt and 2T of lard or shortening (I used Crisco). These are FAST, and delicious! I have also made them with spelt flour and 1/8-1/4 cup additional water. DELICIOUS! Used medium heat, medium high is ok with less time, and as soon as they start to bubble turn over. Each one takes about 3-5 seconds per side in the fry pan. You have to try this one! Great for fish tacos!

I used shortening and halved the recipe...worked beautifully for 9 medium sized tortillas.  These taste just like my favorite restaurant's!  Soooo easy! Thank you LaDonna!

This was awesome. They taste delicious I too had to use butter instead of lard and found that it worked quite well.
They will get quite thin which is nice.
My husband now asks me to make these on a regular basis to he can eat them with eggs and cheese in the morning.

I use to make tortillas when my children were very young, and they would always get excited and join in,,, just like when I brought out a very large bowl of ice cream.  It had been so long since I made them that I thought I better look for a recipe.  I found this one helpful to get back into the swing of things.   ***  I did modify it just a tad.. by using a touch more salt, and almost double the lard.  They came out perfect...!  I had always used either butter or shortening in the past, but I ran to the store and bought some lard, and I think the tortillas taste better and were much easier to roll out.  I can't wait for my daughter to come home from work...  She always loves Daddy's fresh tortillas, but these will be the best.

My mother-in-law taught me how to make tortillas a few years ago. She doesn't have a "recipe" but more like a little of this & a little of that. It's taken me some time to get it down but I have. For some reason I thought I would try an actual recipe. These are great but not as great as the "recipe" I currently use, that's why I chose to give it 4 stars.

So after using this recipe I have made a decision: I am buying a tortilla press! These were AMAZING! I had to use margarine instead of lard but I will try lard at some point too. This recipe was so easy that I had my 11 yr old daughter help me cook them. I rolled and she cooked. So  simple! And with a press I imagine they will come out more even around the edges. Will never buy store bought tortillas again! Thank you so much for sharing!

I can't believe how easy these were! I will definitely  be making these again next time I need flour tortillas. The tortillas become very pliable after resting between dish towels or plates, so they do really well when made ahead of time.

I love this recipe. I didn't have lard so I had to use margarine they turned out wonderful and I used a towel and plastic bag to keep them soft. I highly recommend them so much better than store bought!

Great!   Used Margerine.  My husband says they're almost as good as his mom's!  I think they have excellant texture and taste.   Just remember, the kneading and stretching of the gluten process is very important to the overall texture of the tortilla

This was the best Tortilla recipe I've ever tried! I didn't have lard, so I used shortening instead. Then when I ran out of shortening, I started using butter.  And I used bread flour (it was all I had) instead of all-purpose flour. My husband LOVED them! Thanks LaDonna!

I followed the recipe exactly and they came out awful.  They were hard and had no flavor.  They never bubbled up on the pan. Next time I will try to use shortening instead of the lard and will use more than the recipe calls for.  I was so disappointed after reading such great reviews.

Wow!  Easy, fast, and delicious.  Who could ask for anything more? :)  I threw some chicken legs and thighs in a crockpot in the morning with some taco seasoning.  5:00p.m rolled around and we whipped up these tortillas, shredded some cheese, scooped on some shredded chicken and had a fabulous dinner!  Tips: We used hot water from the tap, which made the dough easy to roll. I used shortening. Cook about 1 minute per side -- the color will look just like the ones you buy in the store -- white with little brown areas.  Made 1/2 the recipe and it served 4 people.  Total time was maybe 1/2 hour from getting out ingredients to meal on the table. My 11 year old daughter and I used the little wooden rolling pin (basically a small wooden dowel) from my son's Play-Doh set, and that worked WAY better than the big rolling pin.  Rolled the dough from center to top edge, then center to bottom edge, then flipped and turned 90 degrees and continued until it was really thin -- thinner than you'd think is ok.  The thinner the better because they puff up a bit when you put them in the skillet.  These were Fab-u-lous.  No more store-bought tortillas for us. Thanks!

WOW!!!!!!!!! These are phenomenal. I halved the recipe and it was perfection. The key I learned is to roll the dough out as THIN as possible. I'll never buy tortillas in the bag again!

I didn't think my husband could say anything better about my cooking...until I made these!  His first wife (passed away) made them and NEVER bought them.  So, still living in that shadow I refused to try. Till now!  These are SOOOO easy and now I understand why he and my girls love the home-made ones so much more!  Thanks for sharing.  I did add some salt so I don't know what they taste like without but I recommend the salt.  I bought a press and it is so fun and easy to use.  Tried to make on a regular pan and had a lot of smoke issues.  I think the cast Iron pan is critical to the health of my normal pan.

These are very good! I used lard, since I use it for my pie crusts anyway. Shortening will give a different texture which I personally don't care for.

My husband is Mexican and he is always talking about his mama's homemade tortillas.  She tried to help me make them over the phone, but she didn't know the measurements so she explained in terms of her hand.  The tortillas came out ok but when I tried the second time I used this recipe and my husband was so happy! "Just like mom's" he said.

This is almost the same recipe that my husbands grandmother (who is from Mexico and is extremely fast) uses. Except when she taught me, she used no measurements and so I don't either. I don't use lard or margerine in mine, I use vegitable oil. My family will no longer eat the tortillas in a bag.

My mom's been making authentic tortillas for years and is gonna teach me soon, in the meantime I thought I'd give these a try and am happy I did! They have great flavor, though I added 4 TBS. shortening instead of the recommended amounts. Happy with this recipe

I've never made flour tortillas before from scratch.  After a couple tries (getting the thickness of the tortilla down) these were out of this world. I would highly recommend!

Very easy. This recipe is the first time ever I've had homemade tortillas actually turn out. Next time we plan to fry them and coat them with cinnamon and sugar.

Great easy Tortilla recipe! I never made tortillas before but I will from now on. It's a little time consuming but plan for it. I didn't have real lard either I had crisco so thats what I used and it did fine. Thanks again!

Honestly, I used expeller-pressed coconut oil for its health benefits instead of lard and these came out awesome! Soft and didn't break when using for tacos! Next time I will try half whole wheat to see how this recipe does with that. It's great to know we are not getting a ton of preservatives and additives and they are so much more flavorful than store bought. One hint - if you want them thin, make sure you don't over cook them or they will turn into crackers!   Thank you so much for this recipe!

EXCELLENT! Used crisco as i didn't have lard and did heat the water up. I ended up adding about one more cup of flour as my dough was a bit sticky. They were so easy to make! Delicous and made a lot!!

Fantastic! I made these with margarine , as my local grocery stores are oddly lacking in lard, and cooked until they bubbled a bit and got light brown spots like store-bought have. I also feel very clever- I used my pasta roller to roll the dough very thin, and then used a bowl to cut out rounds. This resulted in 10 perfectly round, evenly thin tortillas.

This recipe is amazing! So easy, and very fast to make. It has the 5 star approval from my boyfriend, who is not only Mexican, but a professionally trained Chef. I used shortening instead of lard, at his request and they came out perfect!

Oh how I would love to make these more often. But rolling every single one out was quite a task. This, however, does not affect my 4 star rating (4.5 if I could) as a tortilla press would easily solve this problem. I used shortening even though it says not to but it worked just fine.

This was super easy to do and these turned out great. I scaled this down for only two servings and got 4 tortillas from it. These aren't as good as the ones the ladies at the taqueria make, but are better than store bought and faster than a trip to the store. But maybe that is just their years of experience that makes them better tasting. Great recipe, thanks!

These are great! One thing that I changed was subsituting shortening for the lard, only because I don't have lard. Also I made this recipe once before and I used cold water not paying attention, but the dough is easier to work with if you use warm water (80 degrees or so), and they don't take an hour to make if you roll them while you cook them...

These are really good, but rolling them out was very tiring for me (I'm 76), and mine weren't quite as thin as I would have liked.

This was wonderful. I've been trying to get away from processed foods and this is a definate keeper. It was so quick and easy, my younger two children helped and all four kids ate without complaining. My husband is the real test, he is picky and he said these were much better than store bought. We made extra and just stored them in plastic freezer bag for lunch the next day.

very easy, very tasty tortilla recipe!  The only thing I did change was that I used bacon grease instead of lard, but the tortillas still came out flavorful, chewy and soft.  To keep the tortilla soft and moist make sure your skillet is HOT, to nearly smoking point and watch them because it only takes about a minute for the tortilla to finish on one side. I think I may try rolling them out thicker for gorditas sometime.

These are delicious! I followed the advice of some reviewers and used warm water but followed the recipe exactly. I think one key thing to do is roll the tortilla very thin in order to avoid a flat bread type result. Thanks for sharing the recipe, LaDonna.

I will never buy tortillas again.. I have to say our first attempt at this was not the best but after viewing a video on how to make tortillas I tried it again and they were perfect. I will be making these for years to come.

These taste like the ones they used to have at Tias-soft floury with a mellow grilled taste.   So awesome. Thank you thank you thank you!

I little bit confusing at first (the dough was way too wet). But after figuring out the right amount of flour these turned out great! The first tortilla recipe I've made that didn't result in fragile dry tortillas!

These came out thick and pretty brittle, even though I followed the recipe to a t.  they were more like flat bread than tortillas.  May try again.  Hope for better results.

I was truly happy with how these turned out... the second time I did it. When done correctly, these are pleasantly chewy and soft and taste just as good as any tortilla made elsewhere. Use the lard! You'll be glad that you did.

This is the perfect tortilla recipe.  I made them too small (and thus, too many), so I'll probably play around with the size next time.  I ended up putting the last few into the fridge uncooked, and that did NOT work out for me.  They weren't anywhere near as good after chilling for two days.

I made these with my daughter and they were liked by all! I used butter instead of lard, and a tortilla press makes them come out as thin as you like.  I got my tortilla press on ebay for $15 with shipping! the press is very handy if you make a lot of spanish dishes!

These are OK, but it is extremely difficult to get them thin enough.  They are fairly easy to make, but really not worth it for the results.  Sorry, but need to be honest here.

Wonderful! I used margarine and hot water as others previously noted. Rolled out on a floured silpat with a floured ziploc bag on top. No problems with sticking. Made 24 tortillas, ~ 6 inches each. Too small for making burritos but just right for softshell tacos. I may try making 12 larger tortillas next time. The smaller tortillas were wonderful reheated the next morning for breakfast tacos. I imagine they'll work well as wraps as well.

I did substitute butter flavored shortening for the lard and put 1 1/2 tsp of salt! My Mexican hubby liked them and is used to eating his mother's who has been making tortillas for about 30 years so i think this says alot! Hes the one who gave them a 4 star rating! Thanks!

I would recommend baking the dough instead of cooking them on the stove. It makes it easier to wrap and fold without cracking.

So glad I only made 1/2 batch. Followed recipe exactly.   Yuck. They taste like nothing with a raw flour after taste.   definitely  not worth the effort or clean up.  I set my seasoned cast iron pan from my great grandma on stove at level 5 out of 10 and the first one burned black in spots while the rest was still raw. medium/low (3.5) worked much better. 
 I divided it as recipe suggests (24 in a whole batch) they were only about 4”-5” ea.  If you’re going to roll by hand and you want to use this recipe I’d make fewer larger ones.

Wonderful. It did need more lard/butter. I used butter instead of Lard. I did add a little bacon grease to it because Lard is pork to get it that flavor. I would add whatever substance you use a little at. Time until you get the corn meal consistency. I followed another reviewers advice to let the balls sit under a wet cloth for 10 minutes. Worked beautifully. Also the same reviewer posted to cook in dry cast iron skillet. Worked perfectly. I used a fondant roller to reach the thickness I want. Easier to control.

Delicious! Everybody loved them. I halved the recipe & made 12. The tortillas are smaller than the store bought ones, but no worries - just planned on everyone eating 2 instead of 1 (though husband had 4.)

I followed the recipe exactly, as I feel that’s the only way you can give an accurate review. Here’s my take on this... This recipe was easy, and near flawless. My recommendation would be to make 12 instead of 24 as they were too small (even for “street tacos”) and I realized this after making a few. I would also recommend adding a bit more salt. I know that tortillas are basically bland as is, but these are just a tad better if you add a little bit more salt. Also, hot water works better for the recipe if you have a few extra minutes - you should definitely go the extra mile.

I have made these tortillas many times. They are always delicious. The base recipe is really good and makes awesome tortillas. Sometimes I follow the recipe exactly and sometimes I use other things I have lying around- almond flour, coconut flour, butter, oil, coconut oil, various seasonings, etc.  Using other ingredients changes the texture but I haven't ruined any yet. They always turn out delicious.

Finally a simple recipe!!! So many people post complicated recipies that involve boiling water,and the use of the oven. It was so simple I grew concerned with my self. I was begging to think I missed a crucial step.? I DIDNT!! The recipie says takes about 60 minutes to make them. I finished in maybe 20. BRAVA,FANTASTICO RECIPIE.

Easy recipe! Next time I will probably add more water since they came out a bit stiff. I will also add more salt for flavor.

What I loved about this recipe is that it was to the point and pretty simple. Did half the recipe because I only needed 10 tortilla, but ended up still getting 14 out of it. I did have to add a bit more of shortening to make it just right, but overall excellent.

When I first made them with this recipe, I didn't anticipate them to come out as good as they did, but to my amazement as long as I don't roll them out thin they were perfect.

Excellent recipe.  I decided to try this recipe because it actually calls for lard, and that is how homemade flour tortillas are actually made. These were perfect for eating Carne Guisada.

Yum! I followed another reviewer‘s advice and tossed the ingredients into the food processor before kneading. I double the salt, butter, and baking powder… And ended up with flatbread! Or at least thick tortillas. Next time I will try not doubling the baking powder. They were pretty good though!

Absolutely wonderful tortillas! I did not have lard in the house- what I did have was chilled bacon grease (and a little butter, because I didn't have quite enough bacon grease). I blended the dry ingredients and the fat in a food processor and kneaded in the wet ingredients by hand. The dough became beautifully smooth, and I was able to roll them out directly onto my countertop without flour, no sticking. I cooked them until they had brown spots, and put all the tortillas into a ziplock bag when cool. This helped soften all the tortillas- some were a little crispy when I took them out of the pan, but they softened up overnight.

The way the recipe said to do it was too dry. I had to add a lot more oil so they could roll more stretchy. Maybe needed more baking powder. They didn't rise enough.

Great tortillas!  Dough rolled out nice and elastic.  I did use shortening and they came out fine.  The recipe made about 14 small-med tortillas.

Didn't have lard. They turned out good. Odd shapes, but good. Thicker than I expected, but good. Next I'll get a tortilla press, and try again. Good recipe

I made this recipe and as mixed the shortening in, I could quickly tell that the recipe did not call for enough shortening or lard. I added more shortening until I could tell the consistency was right. I used warm water. I also made one tortilla to test it and it didn’t have enough salt for our taste so I actually sprinkled a little salt on the prepared dough balls and then they turned out perfect.

These tortilla’s are amazing!! I just recommend that you allow the dough to rest for about 15 minutes before you start to make them
into balls. I also recommend that you make your balls and flatten them into very thick disks (it helps with rolling it out into a circle). Use hot water for your dough!!

I found that you need much more lard than the recipe calls for. Also you need to use HOT water. I tried using a tortilla press but found this left them a little thick. Rolling pin solved that problem. I have made these several times since making the adjustments.

These taste really good. Still need more practice to get the cooking right. Too much flour when rolling ends up burning on the pan. Also, we like 12" size tortillas and this recipe makes 24 smaller ones. Next time maybe cut dough into 12 or 16 balls instead. But homemade are defiling a nice change from store-bought, if you have the time.

2 tablespoons for this recipe is a joke. If you want to cook frisbees, then go for it. Put at least 3/4 cup of lard in the recipe and stop the orthorexia already.  Also - hot water is a must. 
I had to throw out the entire batch because without more lard, you cannot get the right consistency.

This recipe turned out good when I followed the other reviews and used 1/4-1/2cup shortening. I also typically half it because I don't need that many tortillas.

I have tried to make homemade tortillas before and they were so stiff I couldn't roll them out.  Not these.  They rolled out fairly thin and easily.  I did not have lard so I used butter and I thought it was fine.  This recipe will be my go to from now on.

I will make it again.  My only problem was with my cast iron pan getting a wee bit too hot and scorching some of them.  I would pre-season the pan just before doing this next time.  (It's always seasoned, but I think the flour sucked up all the oil - my story and I'm sticking to it.)

Extremely easy to make.  I made them with my 7 yr old.  We happen to have a tortilla press, so she made the balls of dough, placed them in between two sheets of plastic wrap and then smashed them in the tortilla press while I placed each one in the hot skillet.  Made 1 dozen tortillas for burritos.

Wow, wow, wow! Made no changes; what a treat!

Helpful to use cast iron pan and tortilla press. Also a tortilla holding pan is a bonus.

So awesome, can't say enough!

Not bad, came out a bit stiff; even with recommendations. Feels and tastes more like a chalupa shell after i let them sit in foil and spread a bit of butter to soften them.

Needed a little more salt and maybe a little more lard, and I should have wrapped more damp towels around them, as they didn't soften up as much as I'd like (but that's easy to fix next time). Getting them thin enough was tricky... feels like there might be a technique there I don't know. But they came out good for a first try and I'll use this as the base for some experimentation next time.

First time making homemade tortillas.  Glad I chose this recipe.  I did use butter instead of lard.  Not sure it matters what type of fat you use.  I made half the recipe.  It made 8 tortillas, about 7 inch in diameter.  They turned out very good.  More of a cross between a flatbread and a tortilla because of how they puff up when they cook.  Waaaay better than store bought!

I had to add more lard to get the cornmeal type consistency.  Also, I added garlic powder to my mix.  For my first time, I think I did pretty good.

The only change I made was to cut the recipe in half.  I wanted to see how they would come out, they were delicious! This was Saturday night for dinner.  On Sunday morning I made the full recipe and again, they were just delicious.  I had to make the full recipe because my family really liked them.  Today is Tuesday and they're asking me to make them again!!

Glad I tried this recipe!!
Thanks!!

Use Hot water. Used my kitchen aid Mixer whisk dry ingredients first, add lard, whisk 3 minutes. Switch attachment to mixer paddle, add water mix until it starts to pull from bowl. Switch to knead attachment for another 3-5 minutes. Hand knead on oiled surface until smooth and no tears about 5 minutes. Make into balls and drop in oiled muffin pans with plastic wrap on top. Rest for 25 minutes in warm area about 80 degrees. Use tortilla press with plastic wrap and coconut oil spray. Tortillas come out thin, round, and soft. Immediately transfer cooked tortillas to warmer bag.

Wow! Just wow! I’m a native Texan who lives abroad and it’s been years since I had a tortilla this tasty! I made half of a recipe and still got 14-16 tortillas about the size of my hand (smaller tortillas but not street taco sized). I used slightly less baking powder because I wanted them to be slightly thinner and they turned out perfectly!

I love the taste but I’m really frustrated, and I’m sure it’s user error.  I roll them out seriously thin and they bounce back, shrinking by half and making them thick.  What do I do to prevent that?

The only change we make is to halve the recipe for our family of 3.  Other than that, we make it just as written, and it comes out perfectly every time.

They rolled out just like grandma's, I use them to fry so I only lightly cooked til they started to bubble and get brown spots. Fried nicely and tasted great.  The secret is fresh opened baking powder. Then fry those babies folded in half.

I followed the recipe as written and the results was delicious! My kids eat them faster than I can make them though! I wasn't able to get as many tortillas out if the recipe as what it said, but I'm not a real tortilla rolling pro just yet ...

I used butter as I had no lard on hand and it worked fine.  The only difficult step was rolling out the dough. I rolled it out as thin as I could but it would sometimes tear when I peeled it off. So I would have to restart all over again. 

I didnt use up all of the water as the dough got too sticky, and I added a bit of extra flour.

I used butter instead of lard and I halved the recipe. Worked perfectly. Just make sure the pan is hot and the dough is rolled thin and it'll puff up exactly like a tortilla!

Just made these to make coconut shrimp tacos with. They were amazing!  They remind me of my favorite Mexican restaurant when we lived in Nevada. Very authentic!  I used butter because I didn’t have lard, used warm water due to others suggestions, and I did double the amount of butter because it didn’t seem like enough. I also added a bit of extra water as it seemed dry. So good!

Great recipe. I had to try a few time before I got it perfect. Key is to roll them super thin. Once they start to bubble, flip! Keep them in a towel or warmer so the steam softens them. That was my first mistake. Reheating was troublesome but I will need to work on that. They taste great!

I’ve beed trying to make flour tortillas for a while now. Tried many recipes. I think lard is really the secret ingredient here. So tasty and easy to make. Don’t be afraid of using lard, you only need a little.

After trying another recipe and being disappointed, I was kinda apprehensive about these, but oh my gosh these are amazing!! The recipe is simple, ingredients knead together easily, they roll out nice and easy and cook up perfect. Best part is it’s ingredients you always have on hand anyways, except the lard, I don’t usually buy it but I will now! Because these will be a staple in our house. We go through so many tortillas. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Ok everyone, I followed the recipe exactly, except for two things. I used hot water, and I used bacon grease! Yes, bacon grease. The result was a subtle bacon flavor and a remarkably soft and chewy tortilla.

These were PERFECT. I had neither lard nor a tortilla press so used butter and a rolling pin. I don’t think I’ll ever make tacos with store-bought tortillas again. Also, if you make them thicker (12 servings per recipe) they make great pitas.

Nice and soft, the kids enjoyed the tortillas both with fillings and plain. How ever i did substitute the plain salt for vegeta, and replaced the lard with olive oil.

This recipe has more flour and less grease than most. My results were ok. The tortillas turned out quite stiff and somewhat tasteless. I am sure the taste depends on a few things like flour brands and processing etc. and what kind of lard or grease. I will probably go back to a recipe that requires more oil. But I tried this. And it works as a decent tortilla.

First time making tortillas. They were good, but I agree with some other reviews they could use a little more lard to make them more supple. However, be sure to keep them covered as you stack them! They come off the griddle kind of stiff, but pile them up on a plate and keep them covered with at folded towel. They steam under the towel and soften up nicely.

These were...exceptional. I have never made tortillas before, although I have made naans and roti in the past, with mixed results, so I fully expected to flunk my first attempt at tortillas. However these were so soft and pliable, they actually couldn't of possibly been more perfect. I did double the lard though as one reviewer suggested and I used hot water from the tap.  Make sure you wrap them immediately up in tin foil after cooking, the trapped steam is what makes them so soft.
By the way- to flatten them cut out two circles in from a ziplock or plastic bag and put the dough ball between them, then squash with a heavy book- perfect circles! Yet my husband took to them with a rolling pin after that initial flattening to get them even thinner. I will always, always use this recipe- what else can I say?

I made this recipe. It is very easy to prepare. Yet, is not like the traditional homemade though. It was less than 24. It was kind of hard to roll. I had to cook them for about 15 seconds both sides or else it will be to hard and crunchy or burn. I know is well cook because the air bubbles rise. I have done tortillas before more flexible. These were a bit hard.

I substituted canola oil for lard, added 2 tsp dried basil, and 1/2tsp garlic powder to the flour mixture.  I also used hot water.  The dough is very easy to work with.  Cooked for 1 min on each side. Delicious!

Made these as posted except used crisco as I had no lard- they were perfect after browning on a dry griddle on medium high heat.  I only used half of the recipe for my first attempt to see how they turned out and will use this recipe again and again.  I actually did not roll with a pin but just pressed with fingers and they were great.  Yo u can adjust softness by just frying a little less but even browned they were very pliable for me.

I will probably make these again. I used four types of flour (two white wheat 000 and 650, one whole wheat and one rye) in equal amounts and I didn't actually measure the ingredients. We don't have standard cups and spoons here, so I eyeballed it, as usual. They rolled nicely and came out really tasty.

I followed the comment that suggested using hot water, 3-3/4 C flour, 1/3 C shortening, 2 t baking powder' 1 t salt, 1-1/3 C got water. I used butter, I don't think it was a good idea. It was a bit dry and crispy. The dough felt good to work though. I didn't have a cast iron skillet, so I used a heavy-bottomed stainless steel pan.
I fried some strips of dough and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, also following the same comment. That turned out good. Absorbed too much frying oil though.
Note to self: don't use too high heat and try margarine next time.

I regularly use this recipe for all meals in a day, and the results are always great: quick, delicious tortillas everyone loves. You can use the dough immediately or store in the fridge for later use. I make the dough as instructed, but I roll the dough into a log, slice off pieces, and roll out the pieces as thinly as I can. We use a smoking hot iron skillet, toss them in, 1-2 minutes per side. Excellent every time.

It's like my mom's I made it with veg oil i didn't have shortening  so to make them thinner and tasty kinda brush the balls of dough with oil. It works perfect I noticed at the factory they spay the dough with oil . NOT a lot just enough so they roll smooth and don't crack. Plus u must keep them in a bag shut after each one to keep them soft rookie mistake i learned as a teen. Tasted perfect

These were so fun to make. First time making tortillas from scratch. The only time I have eaten a true homemade tortilla was by a sweet Peruvian lady. She said it HAD to be made with lard only. Well, I did not have lard but only Crisco so I did substitute that and they turned out OK but I am sure if I made them with lard, it would have been better. I will not be intimidated by this anymore so I will make these frequently now.  These should be made into 12-16 tortillas instead of 24 as I thought they were too small.  I have made pie crust from scratch All my life  so this is just like making pie crust but rolling them very thin. We had fish tacos with these and it was a nice treat.

Roll thin! See through thin and don't over cook! Can be scaled down to 3 servings np!!My go to recipe 
I take it down to 3 servings and it still perfect!! I've used lard, shortening and butter AND coconut oil np!! If they are thick and tough your not rolling them thin enough- I cook them with Pam in pan and they bubble nicely! Also dont over mix the dough! Or you wont get bubbles and they will be tough. Mix like a pie crust. Dont use HOT water or you will melt the fat! The little pieces of fat make the bubbles!

Easy Peazy. I substituted 3cups of whole wheat white flour (instead of enriched white) and Crisco instead of Lard. The first few were just okay. Make sure to use high heat and only a minute or two on each side!. Keep warm with foil. I will definitely make this again.

This is exactly the ingredients the Belizean women use. I have a home in Belize and was taught by two different women in the village who pride themselves on their tortillas. The only thing that they do there is they let the dough sit for 15 minutes after its all mixed so the baking powder does its magic.  They also don't have rolling pins and they just use their hands, like you would do for a pizza crust. They push it out with their finger tips on lightly oiled tin foil and then just place the dough side down on the hot pan. After cooking for a short while, the foil lifts off the dough.  No worries about peeling it off the foil.  Mine aren't yet perfect circles like the women in Belize make. But they taste the same! 
The amount of water can vary of course, like all breads you add enough water to make the right consistency. In this recipe specifically, I needed a bit more water.

Extremely easy to work with .  I had to use shortening because I didn't have any lard.  I made half a recipe and ended up with 15 6 inch tortilla ( perfect for soft tacos).  I kept in clean towel to keep warm while I cooked the rest.

This is my favorite tortilla recipe! I use coconut oil instead of lard and they turn out so soft, chewy and amazing! My husband always brags about my tortillas and sometimes he likes to brush them with garlic butter and eat them with Indian dishes as well. I usually don't have the patience to make them all so I just pop the dough in the freezer and let them defrost so I can have fresh tortillas for a couple of days.

This recipe is super amazing but if you don’t have lard, vegetable shortening works too.                           Also it cooks better when you roll the tortillas thinner.

I have used this recipe before and loved it.   This time I did not have lard or enough flour and there was a snowstorm.  I decided to ad lib.  I used Bisquick and 1/2d the recipe.   They were a bit rigid until I steamed them.   I thought it was not a good Idea but my husband was impressed and loved them.   I say that butter and Bisquick did the trick in a pinch but don’t do it unless you have to.   ;).

Wow! I've never made tortillas before and they turned out great. I was very pleased with how easy the dough was to work with. I took the advise of others and used my kitchen aid to mix it all up. Super easy, thanks!

Perfect simple recipe. To make flatter, wrap style tortillas, I reduced to 1tsp of baking soda and increased to 3 tablespoons of lard.

The taste was definitely homemade, but they were a little thicker than I normally like. I put a teaspoon less and got exactly what I was looking for.

The first few times I made this, I followed the recipe exactly...okay not entirely exactly. I don't use lard, but I do use tallow, which is the beef version of lard (we don't do pork) and just as yummy. They were just...okay. Not sure I'd even give them an "okay". The baking powder taste was just off. I live in Phoenix, 3 hours from the Mexican border, grew up in Yuma, which is 20 minutes from the border, so we have Mexican food that is about as authentic as it gets. No authentic Mexican tortilla has the taste of baking powder! So, I omitted the baking powder, and they turned out fabulously! So...bottom line is, if you want true authenticity (and yummyness) do yourself a favor and omit the baking powder, as it's entirely unnecessary. Because the real tortillas aren't "fluffy", any ways. And as another reviewer stated (and I also did, before reading her review), increase the lard/tallow. Your tortillas and tastebuds will thank you!

Great recipe but upped the lard to 4 Tablespoons and used  very hot water. Kneed to the consistency of play dough. Let rest at least 20 minutes. Make sure pan is nice and hot( cast iron is best) should bubble up perfectly. With the extra lard the tortillas are softer and will last a couple of days.

After the first time I made this,  I started adding more spices like parsley and cilantro, and even a dash of chili powder! I also like to add a dash of lime juice in place of some of the water. They taste better and are cheaper than store bought! The only problem I haven't solved is how to get them thin enough to roll for burritos like store-bought, but I'm getting there! 
While munching on my very first tort, straight from the pan, I realised you can also use this as a pizza crust! Which I now do all the time. (For a crisper crust, I recommend cooking the dough crust for a short while before adding toppings.) 

I like this recipe so much, I even made triple the recipe and keep the dry ingredients in a jar so I can just who up 2 or 3 at a time anytime I want.

This was very easy. I did use warm water, and made the dough balls, then let them rest about 30 minutes. Hands down easy, and will not use store bought again. The recipe gave me the number expected.

First time making these tortillas and it turned about absolutely amazing! So chewy and delicious, perfect for a taco night! I used bacon fat instead of lard since we have some on hand, and it worked out perfectly. Our house couldn't get enough of the tortillas, even my Latin housemate!

I really love the tortillas that come from this recipe, I only make 2 changes to it. I add 4 tablespoons of Lard and use Hot water when mixing. 

The extra lard make them easier to roll out and oh so fluffy, the hot water helps melt the lard when mixing.

I love this easy, fun recipe! I just tried it for the first time tonight, and the tortillas were a huge hit. I substituted coconut oil for the lard, and added an extra third of a tablespoon of the coconut oil when my mixture wasn't looking cornmeally enough.

Having never made flour tortillas, I thought this recipe sounded easy to do. I did find that there was not enough lard in this recipe so I went ahead and doubled it. Tortillas turned out great, with good flavor. We used them for soft tacos and thought they were delicious.

I would like to begin by saying thank you for sharing the recipe.  I made these last night for my family and they turn out great. I used 1/3 c vegetable shorthening . I kept all the other measurements exactly as stated in the recipe. I used a cast iron pan and flipped them over as soon as they started bubbling up. There was a couple I did not get to flip right after they bubbled up and they cracked when I folded them, but they are still awesome. Bottom line is, they worked great for me. I made wraps for kids lunches and they rolled out really nice and easy. I am going to fry some today and sprinkle cinnamon and brown sugar on them. Fingers crossed they turn out well. ??

First time I've ever made homemade tortillas before. But I know what real ones taste like. My friend's Hispanic mom used to make them for us on Saturday mornings with butter fresh out of the pan. So ridiculously good.
These were also good, but just good - because homemade is always better than store bought. But they were hard and stiff. I used lard. My first thought is that the recipe must need more lard. After reading another recipe, it seems there's more to it, like A) using more lard, B) using hot water & more salt, and C) letting it rest/rise for a minute...
That's what I'll be trying next. Why buy store bought tortillas with the carcinogenic bromated flour, preservatives, and dough conditioners that make it taste NASTY. Just some good old simple ingredients. I'll take lard over chemicals any day. This recipe was a good starter recipe for me to learn from, and everyone liked it enough. My 16 month old ate the whole tortilla even though she only has a few molars...

Set up camp and thought I had Tortillas for enchiladas, but didn't have them. I found this recipe and made 1/4 recipe for 6 tortillas. Didn't have lard, used 1 Tbsp shortening instead. No oil on griddle either. They were fabulous and saved the day!

Perfect! These were awesome! I am rather bad at making anything bread-like and these came out spot on! I cut the recipe back by 4 servings as a first time and man they were good. Soft and chewey. I followed this recipe exact, but after I made the balls, I did what someone suggested and let them sit under a damp towel for about 30min. Rolled out beautifully and cooked perfect. They were almost too soft! LOL

I loved this recipe! My husband said it tastes like his favorite Mexican restaurant, so that's good. I substituted lard for shortening. I mixed it in my mixer instead of with my hands and found it to be a titch dry at first, so I added a tiny bit more water and it was fine. I cut it into 24 pieces and the tortillas turned out quite small, so next time I'll do 16 pieces instead of 24. I didn't have a tortilla warmer, so I just put them in my glass casserole dish and covered them. I believe the point of doing that is to make them not stay hard, and do be pliable. I suck at rolling out dough, so mine were so not round. But because this recipe was so successful, we ordered a tortilla press so we can make these and stop buying store-bought.

Following this recipe verbatim the dough never gets near elastic. Something They don't bubble well, and come out very dry and crumbly. Another reviewer mentioned these need more lard / shortening. and I am going to try a third to a half cup of lard. That's how the Hispanikc families I know do it. I think the ratio is 1/4 cup lard for 1 cup flour. maybe a bit less.

I was really surprised by this recipe.  I used vegetable shortening instead of lard.  My wife and I were able to eat these without anything on them.  They were quick and easy to make, so much better than store bought.

I don't normally leave reviews, but these tortillas came out perfect! I halved the recipe and used lard and a tbsp of Vegetable Oil, also added an extra tbsp of Salt. Cooked on a Cast Iron skillet and they were nice and chewy. Better than any Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. Will be using this recile from now on. Thank you

Not a terrible recipe but it needs about 3x the lard. Butter or olive oil also work as a good substitutes (I've  used all three). Needs about 6 tablespoons of any of them.

Didn't make any changes but I think the next time I'll add a little more water to make them thinner. Easy recipe!

I've just made them and the result was a amazing. I folllow a comment here and made it with hot water. And replace the lard for 2,5 tablespoon of butter. It's very foldable!!! Everybody here love. And while I was making one all the other dough balls were placed under a wet towel, cause they can dry and that will make difficult to open the dought!

Easy, straight-forward recipe with great results. I successfully used shortening instead of lard. After mixing in the shortening, I used my Kitchenaid as I added the water. Once mixed, I let the balls rest for ~15 minutes. They were easy to roll out and cooked quickly in the pan. They tasted terrific. Great recipe. I will absolutely make these again.

Perfect flour tortillas. Nice to have homemade. I cut the recipe  to 25% using only 1 C flour. Also, I didn't have lard so I used shortening. It works. I hate buying a pack at the store. They're expensive for what they are and we never use the whole pack. Mine were not perfectly round, because I rolled them instead of using my tortilla press. They are thicker than store bought, but that could be me. I rolled them pretty thin, but maybe I could have made them thinner. All that and they were so much better than the store bought ones, as a side with my Black Bean Soup. Definitely making these again. Next time, I'll be sure to have lard.

These were good!
I did use shortening instead of lard and they turned out fine. 
I did find that I really had to flour my pastry board and did have to turn the dough as I was rolling it to achieve a circular shape. 
I will definitely make these again!

Easy enough. I thought I had tortillas for dinner and had already been to the store. This came in very handy. I don't think I rolled them thin enough though. Reminds me of the tortillas at Don Pablo's. Delish!

I like the simplicity of the recipe. It was easy to make. A few tips- use the least amount of flour possible rolling them to keep it moist.  I used to silicon mats to roll it out as thin as possible. I put them in a gallon sized ziploc bag straight out of the pan to make them soft like store bought. Have fun.

For 4 cups of flour, its not enough fat in the dough. It should be for 1 cup of flour , 2 tbsp of lard. Not bad recipe but make improvements to get authentic. Also add boiling water instead

We use a lot of tortillas in our house...we're big on wraps! I think I added a touch more lard and then went ahead with the recipe exactly as I read it.  These wraps are lovely and this will be my recipe of choice!

Great recipe! If you want the warm. soft chewy tortillas that are sold in stores, don't be afraid to add lard! The biggest flaw about this recipe is that with such a small amount of lard, when the tortillas get cold, they become hard and really unpleasant to eat with tacos. (Even warming them back up doesn't really do the trick!) I would say if you want the good tortillas, add about  a cup of lard.

I was so surprised that such a small amount of lard (or in my case, shortening) makes such delicious tortillas. I'm sort of rolling pin challenged and only one of them was actually anywhere near round, but no matter the shape, they were fun to make and delicious. I halved the recipe since there are only two of us and divided them into eight, instead of twelve. They rolled nice and thin and were the perfect size. The first time on any recipe requires a learning curve. My husband loved them and I'm pretty sure we'll never have store bought again.

I made them.  I ate one.  However, I would not serve them to friends until I perfected their appearance.  I found it tough to roll a perfect circle and the cast iron pan I used collected a lot of extra flour/  Are we supposed to grease the fry pan?  I did not and it just seemed that flour was burning.  A video might help. Tasted great- looked sad.

I was looking for a recipe that would lead to the soft thick tortillas that I get from the Mexican restaurants all over Texas.  This did not turn out well at all.  It never got the "cornstarch" consistency that it says it should when the lard is mixed in.  I pressed on and completed the recipe.  The dough was extremely moist and "light" flour was not enough to prevent it from sticking to the rolling pin.  As another reviewer suggested, I tried spraying the pin & rolling surface with Pam - that worked much better.  I tried rolling to different thicknesses, but they never puffed up.

This recipe is great! Easy, fast, and delicious. (I had bacon fat available, so I used that instead of lard; worked out well.) My husband is raving about these and I'm never buying commercial tortillas again.

I subbed in about half a tablespoon of lard for Bacon Grease, and added a pinch more salt.  

Also, while they were a lil sticky to roll out I didnt add any more flour, not even for a surface, because when I did it made them waaaaay too floury. 

They turned out great, made chimis with em

Made these today for a taco pie. Easy, fast, and tasty. Next time I plan to add fresh cilantro to the mix for a flavored tortilla. Thanks for sharing!

I had to use butter and unbleached flour but they STILL turned out great! They roll out so easily and don't stick at all. Really nice! I just needed a few so I quartered the recipe: 1 cup flour, 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/2 tablespoon fat and 6 tablespoons water made six medium tortillas.

Made tortillas for my husband and his family, it was my first time ever. He is of Mexican descent and said they weren't quite like his grandma's, but they were really good! His family approved as well. Easy to follow. Thanks!

Best tortillas I have ever made! I deleted all other recipes I had for tortillas and will only use this one forever. Restaurant quality and so easy to make! Like everyone one else said DO NOT use oil instead of lard it will make or  break your dinner

I didn't like the flavor of the original recipe at all. Tasted like I was eating a flour patty not a tortilla. Instead of regular salt I switched it to season salt. 
I also pressed and stretched it by hand. Not that hard actually. 
It ended up almost like a flat bread, but thinner. Like a hearty tortilla, with thin spots :) 
Also make sure you mix the powder ingredients first, I forgot one ingredient and added it to late. Made it very lumpy, and hard to press and stretch.

I just loved this recipe..all I did was add half teaspoon more salt to help pull out the flavor and 2more tablespoons lard .also used a quarter cup more hot water from the faucet..the tortillas turned out perfect..I also learned as a kid, not to roll them out super then and they stay soft longer and bend easier for burritos..

These are great to prepare with kids.  I followed the recipe as written.  After some trial and error, we found the correct heat setting on the griddle for flexible tortillas that were perfect for our burritos.

Took a little practice to make the dough thin enough but even the ones to thick were amazing with a little homemade butter and honey. 

I did add a touch more lard as one person suggested and seemed to work perfectly, counting how I have none left over.

This a simple and solid recipe. I have made these a few times with no issues.  I use coconut oil instead of lard, or other fat. 
I always let the dough rest as I find it rolls out better.   I find the process a bit time consuming as I usually make them for a crowd so I make them in advance, wrap them in parchment and then aluminum foil and freeze them. When I am ready to use them, I thaw them and pop them in the oven to reheat. I have thrown singles in the microwave too ( day after taco party). Give them a go, they're easy to make and a sure fire way to impress the folks at your taco party :-)
Have fun!

These were just too thick or my taste.  I used an authentic tortilla press (from a Mexican grocery) and when these still puffed up a lot , I pressed and then rolled them out even thinner.  The dough was easy to work with.  I used hot water and let the dough rest for about 15 minutes before pressing.  I will try this again - but will let the dough rest at least 30 minutes and will roll them out paper thin.  Will re-rate if this helps.  The taste is good - but it's more like a pita than a tortilla.

Wow!  Ran out of store bought tortillas and decided to try to make them from scratch.  My young daughter helped me and we used this recipe.  I did not have lard so substituted 3 tablespoons shortening and used hot water.  Memories came flooding back to me and I new my grandma would be proud.  The first taste of one almost brought tears to my eyes.  They tasted just like my grandmas.  I remembered her storing them in an old bread bag and always having them on hand.  We would eat them with melted butter and cinnamon or dripping with honey.  Thank you for this great recipe.  It will be used again and again! My family loved it also

This was my first attempt at every making homemade tortillas.  I was surprised how thick they were, even when I rolled them out as thin as possible.  They were between a tortilla and a pita.  But they were SO delicious!  I will never buy tortillas again.  Bravo contributor!

Reduce the flour and water by 1/2 and you'll have the recipe that I've been using for 15 years. FYI you can substitute oil fir the lard, I use canola oil, and let the dough rest for 10-15 minutes after rolling into balls and before rolling out with rolling pin, this will let any gluten relax and make rolling out much easier.

This was a very beginner friendly recipe. I make as much as I can from scratch so I know what goes into a recipe. I did not use store bought lard as I had just rendered a batch from a ham hubby smoked. It added just the right seasoning to the tortillas. I am still working on getting the shape consistent. I don't have pictures because they were eaten as quickly as I could make them. I used my cast iron skillet to cook these. Lesson learned. Quadruple batch next time.

These came together quickly and turned out great. I rolled them incredibly thin and they still puffed up quite bit so they were a little thicker than a store bought  but really soft and easy to use. I used butter and they turned out fine. I'd try them with lard next time and see the difference. Great recipe! X

I couldn't find lard so I used shortening.  Also used warm/hot water  and then let the balls rest for 10 minutes.  A tortilla press is definitely the way to go, but rolling them out worked too.  These were soooo good!

Used vegetable shortening instead of lard.  Turned out great!!  So much better than store bought tortillas!

I made these on a night that I wanted tacos, but the weather was bad and I didn't want to drag 3 kids to the store. The recipe was easy to follow and the dough came out right using the measurements listed. 

However, having never made tortillas before, I didn't know whether to use oil in the pan or not. Don't. Cook them in a dry pan. 

I also didn't realize that ANY residual flour from rolling them would turn brown and taste awful when the tortillas were cooked. I'd suggest putting the dough between 2 pieces of wax paper and rolling that way to avoid adding any extra flour. That would prevent the browned flour flavor and help considerably.

Other than that, they were fine. They weren't the best tortillas I've ever had by a long shot, but they were ok. I'd probably add a little more salt next time.

Perfect recipe for Spanish tortillas. I usually 1/2 the recipe. I don't use lard but 1 egg instead. Sometimes I add garlic powder so it gives it a nice flavor. I also roll them thicker like pizza dough and cut the dough into squares. Frying them makes them thick and tasty. This is how mom used to make them when we were growing up.

Delicioso! I was looking for a recipe like the tortillas my grandma use to make when I was a kid. She never used a recipe or measured her ingredients. But I remember what she put in them, and this recipe fit. I was a bit nervous trying this because I think my grandma would use more manteca. These turned out great though! I cut the recipe in half and was able to get 6 regular sized tortillas. I cut 3 in to triangles, fried them in oil, and sprinkled them with sugar. My grandma use to call these "Sugar Babies". The other 3 I cooked on a hot cast iron comal. They turned out soft and pliable. We spread them with peanut butter, just like when I was a kid. This recipe was pure nostalgia for me! Thanks for sharing!

We made this as described, but used Crisco shortening instead of lard. The tortillas were delicious and so easy to make. ...We have been in search of a very thin, crispy pizza dough. This dough worked great for that! We rolled it out thinly (about half the dough), par baked it on the lowest oven rack at 450 for about four minutes, then added sauce, toppings, and cheese. Back into the oven it went for about 8-10 minutes, until desired brownness. We were amazed at how crispy and delicious it was.

I don't use lard or shortening. so I used butter and they came out great. I took the other suggestions of using hot water. I boiled the water in my tea kettle and then added it in and let my stand mixer mix it up with the paddle attachment. I let it rest for about 20 minutes and it rolled out fine. I didn't divide into 24 seconds. I think those would have been tiny. instead I made different size tortillas for us. I made 5 taco size, 3-4 miss size and 4 huge burrito size as we like to stuff them. that way everyone can do their own thing with the filling. :-)

These tortilla's are amazing. I made a batch and they where all gone within the hour! I didn't have lard, so I used margarine instead, and had to add more flour and more water.

1st time ever! My Boyfriend and I made these tonight. 1/2 the recipe and  the look great!  I personally think it could use a little more salt and maybe try adding butter with the lard next time.  We will adjust next time. :D   Over all they turned out well. Thanks!

These were really good! My family loved them, the only reason I dont give 5 stars is because they turned out more like a flatbread than a tortilla.  But we still loved them and will make again.

I made no changes to this recipe and they turned out really good. They are simple, quick, and easy. Make sure you don't cook them too long or they will be crispy instead of pliable and soft. Hubby loved them! Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will be making them again ;-)

My grandmother who was born in Mora New Mexico always made her tortillas this way, with lard. Sometimes with shorting "Crisco" but she never measured she just use her hands to measure. She started making tortillas for pay at 6 yrs old! To this day no ever compares to the taste, the texture and width....people would go crazy for her tortillas.

I tried this recipe, and then after reading other tortilla recipes made it again with about 2 tablespoons of lard per cup of flour.  With more lard it was much easier to roll out and handle.  I've tried it with whole wheat flour and white flour and liked it both ways.

Happy to have tried this recipe! Born and raised here in New Mexico, I can vouch for this recipe as being authentic! Living in NM means cooking in a high altitude climate- so I increased my water by 1/2 TBS, covered dough-balls with a damp towel and rested the dough for 15 min- rolled out using 4 strokes- these came out great! This recipe made 14 tortillas roughly (6 inches)

I have made this recipe at least 3 times. My husband and young daughter cooked them as I rolled them. I thought at first I could never do this by myself, but you get a rhythm going and can easily be done. The whole family loved them!!

I loved these! I doubled the recipe and I used butter shortening instead of vegetable shortening or lard and they tasted awesome. Since someone said to use more I doubled the shortening then added another tablespoon. I couldn't get them thin enough and they were more like a flatbread but they still tasted awesome

I'll have try it again. The consistency was fine, but I used an electric stove for the first time in making tortillas so it was tricky.

My to go recipe because it is so easy to roll unlike other recipes.  They came out soft and chewy. If you like your tortillas dense and dry this is not for you.

This does need more flavor and perhaps if more lard is used it would be better.  I also used more salt because I found the 1 tsp was not enough.  I will make again as my kids enjoyed it and easy enough for them to do.

This will be my goto tortilla recipe. Used a kitchenaid mixer and a dough hook. Halved the recipe and made 12. Don't roll too thin and don't cook (about 500F) for more than 30 seconds per side and they come out  great. The blisters should just brown when you flip it. Just like the picture. Put in a tortilla warmer with a paper towel on the bottom as you make them.

very easy very good, if your the person who has them just crumble in your hands, then you need to get out of the kitchen and leave it to those who know how dough works.  these tortillas are just about perfect.

Great recipe! I was taught by my mother who was taught by her mother, to make tortillas but there was no recipe. ingredients were eyeballed in the palm of your hand, which left so much room for error.

I think this recipe is a good starting point. They tasted good and my kids liked them, but I was disappointed in the texture. It wasn't as chewy, soft, or rollable as I was expecting. It was on the harder side as well. Usually during the cooking process, the tortilla bubbles up as it fills with steam, but that didn't happen with this recipe.

Even the vegetarian (cold butter instead of lard) version is excellent. I won't buy pre-made tortillas again! I took great care to work the butter into the flour mixture and it paid off nicely. These are very easy to roll out and need to be thin, thin, thin. They really puff up so make a full 24 out of this recipe or they'll be too thick. I stacked them in a cotton towel as I cooked them, then covered it all with plastic wrap for the day. They stayed moist enough to easily handle. We piled on toppings and cooked over the grill as tostadas. They got a little crispy and were delicious! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I needed much more lard to get the crumble called for, and I had to add more water to get the dough to ball up. That being said.. After I realized I was rolling the dough too thick ( they need to be paper thin) I started getting some really nice tortillas. My husband said they were much better than the store bought ones for sure!

I have made this multiple times. I love the recipe. ...however I omit the baking powder and use warm water. The baking powder seems to leaven the tortillas to much. The warm water helps the dough come together better!

Amazingly perfect! I used coconut oil instead of lard and they came out great. I let the dough rest for 15 minutes and rolled super thin. Halving the recipe and rolling produced 12 medium sized tortillas. Will definitley be making again!

I really like this recipe. It has good bones to definitely make it your own.The texture came out perfect but it tasted a little bland. Definitely going to try adding more salt ( 1 1/2 teaspoons) next time. I used margarine instead of lard and the taste difference is not so much different. Overall, success!

Absolutely perfect!
I also cut the recipe in half and I used coconut oil instead of lard (same amount). I cooked these in my tortilla press and they were amazing, and had that thin yet slightly stretchy feel. Much better than the recipe that came with the press!

I doubt I will make this again.  Could not get the tortillas thin enough as they puff when they cook. These would be better for quesadillas, not the tortillas you use for wraps

I used self raising flour in place of plain because I didn't have enough and it saved me from adding the powders. This recipe was easy and quick, although I only made 8 from the quantities given. It makes me feel good to make something from scratch that our family uses regularly and costs a fortune to buy. We wrapped a low fat chilli con carne in these and created a cross between tacos, burritos and enchiladas.

I was trying to find a recipe as close to my granma's recipe for tortillas. I often help her make them and she died before I could get the recipe from her. This is close to her recipe as I could get that I remember but instead of lard she used oil. My granma's tortillas were the best I ever had I'm sure with me changing the lard to oil will be just as good as her's

It is very easy and tasty! I substituted 1/8 cup of flour for ground flax due to prenatal diet needs and it still came out perfect. I will be making this again.

I followed the recipe, but the tortillas were brittle and pretty tasteless.

My guess is that a lot more lard is needed.  I'll do some research and try again.

My first attempt at making tortillas and I will never go back to store bought ones again.  I used margarine, simply placed all dry items and margarine into a food processor and pulsed until mixed. Then added hot water slowly while machine was running, until it came together into a ball. Kneaded lightly and divided into balls.

Great recipe!  Yes, I used Lard which is more natural than shortening.  I made the whole recipe and they were wolfed down!  The kids loved 'helping' make these.   I served them with Tortilla soup - perfect dinner!

I used real butter instead of lard, and will be storing in the fridge and re-heating them as needed. I wonder if you could add a bit if citric acid for longevity?

Perfect. Used my dough hook in my stand mixer. Added a pinch of sugar. Sprayed the counter with Pam instead of using flour. Just perfect.

Follow the recipe, and be patient with it.  It's worth it.  The tortillas I made came out perfect and soft.  You have to put the tortillas in a warmer or on a plate covered with a towel right after they come off heat.  Let them rest a bit, the get very soft.

These turned out terrific.  At the suggestion of others, rolled the dough into balls and let them rest until a damp cloth for 15 minutes.  Rolled into rounds turning 90 degrees each pass to get a more circular shape (we need to practice)  it's important for the griddle to be really hot to get the nice freckled toasted spots.  If you don't have a tortilla warmer, you can wrap the cooked tortillas in a moist cloth while you cook the others.

I never knew that homemade tortillas could taste so good...and sooooo easy. It is critical that you use lard, I used Tendeflake and they were fantastic. I just wish I could get them as thin as the store-bought ones. These are the only tortillas allowed in our house now.

These are amazing. Moderate work, huge return. I also watched the video and saw they kept them in a tortilla warmer, I didn't have one so I used a round pyrex casserole. Keep it covered in between making them they end up being warm and pliable, just perfect. Also, because I made these a couple of hours before I was eating them I put them in a cold oven and then put the hot cast iron skillet on the oven rack below them and closed the oven.  They kept warm until dinner without heating the oven.  I am going to try and freeze them, I'll let you know how that worked out. Just some notes, I kneaded the dough about 5 minutes. When rolling them I found that if you roll them by turning the rolling pin a 1/4 of a turn on every pass you will get round tortillas. Make sure you roll past the edge on every roll. Use enough flour and keep rolling, they will get thin. This made twenty 6 to 7 inch tortillas for me. I will never buy store bought again..

Right on like we do it with lard. I let the dough rest. So it will stretch when you roll it out. I roll with a wooden roller once up one down then turn the tortilla a quarter turn and repeat until you have a nice round tortilla.

Tried this recipe for the first time and it came out good, not great, but pretty good. I added 3 tablespoons of vegetable shortening instead of lard. Using hot water helped with elasticity. Overall very tasty, my husband was very pleased. My hardest part is rolling them into actual circles.

thank you for the great recipe..I used ww flour a touch more salt and ghee in place of lard. Oh, and iI cut them into 16 that way the size wsa right for me.. Around 2.5 grams of dough each.... VERY good! Ive had such a hard time making tortillas before and these are soooo good!!! 
Tips would include, allow dough balls to rest under damp cloth for 25mins to ensure they are very moist and as you take off of stove cover with same damp cloth. Make sure you roll these out very thin or you will have tasty flat bread lol (not that anything is wrong with that!!)
ALL IN ALL I WOULD GIVE 10 STARS IF I COULD!!

I just finished making this recipe. I am so happy I came across this one. I have a son that is allergic to corn, soy and nuts... It is hard to find a store bought tortilla or any other bread without one of those ingredients. Yippee, lunches just got a little excitement back in them! Thanks so much!  Took no time at all to make and they taste good too!

I didn't have lard, so I used butter, and it was good, but not great. We will try shortening next time and I'm hopeful.

I wanted something like the tortillas made at the tortilla factory in my town.  They are amazing.  I'll keep looking.  For me, these were dry and more like a cracker.

My grandmother is Mexican and is notorious for her homemade tortillas and she has tried teaching me how to carry on this traditional dish; my problem was there was never any measurements and was all done by feel and my tortillas just never met up to my grandmothers standards, until I made this recipe!! It tasted just like grandmothers if not better!!!

I discovered this recipe yesterday, and I made it last night for a BBQ and this morning for breakfast tacos. Coming from Texas, and now living in the Netherlands, this recipe has eliminated our family's cravings for good tortillas! I used warm water and a bit more fat(margarine) and voilà- the tortillas came out light, fluffy and very pliable, not at all like the tortillas you find here in the store. Thank you for the recipe!

My husbands mother use to make the most outstanding flour tortillas she passed away long ago, I lost most of my recipes I had from her. she never measured anything but I got to a point I could make them pretty darn good. So many years have passed since even attempting to make flour tortillas. When I saw this recipe with the lard I knew it was the same. Thank you for sharing. I will be making soon and just know they will be wonderful. Just reading some other comments interesting how many people still use margarine People (margarine is horrible for you it will kill faster than the small amount of lard used) that being said for all the folks using Crisco shortening try the lard just once to see the difference.  Also I am a weight watcher and at 24 tortillas with no changes is 2 points each

A very easy recipe and so much better than anything you can buy at the store! I used Crisco Butter flavor as what I already had. Dough is very easy to mix and roll out. Thank you so much for sharing! :)

These came out tough and flavorless.  I followed the directions exactly and wondered what else I could do to make them better.  I have a tortilla press so I was able to get them rolled and cooked fine.  Other recipes I've looked at use a lot more butter or lard.  I think I'll have to go that route to make them tastier.

Very simple recipe for Tortillas. These came out soft, slightly chewy, and warmed up nicely the next day. Just what I was looking for. They turned out great even without a tortilla press. I did add some extra sea salt to the batch and a splash of lime. Yummy!

I have made my own corn tortillas for a while, but struggled with flour tortillas, but this recipe made a big difference. I did make some changes, based on past experience and other reviews. I agreed that the fat to flour ratio seemed light, so I doubled the fat amount. I don't care for store-bought lard, so I used half butter and half bacon grease and it worked great. I also thought the salt was light, so I doubled that as well and I think next time I might add even more, they still were a little bland to eat alone-it would depend on what I was serving them with. I have a cast iron comal (flat skillet)I bought to make corn tortillas, but I hate having to make one at a time, so I also heated up my well seasoned heavy aluminum skillet and it worked almost as well and cut my cooking time in half. I also got only 16 tortillas because we tend to like them larger. Taking a cue from pizza dough, I let the dough rest covered on the counter for 10 minutes before I started rolling to develop gluten. My instinct was to roll them very thin and these bubbled up nicely on my cast iron but didn't cook as well on the aluminum skillet. These thin ones seemed kind of brittle at first, but softened up after stilling in my tortilla warmer in a towel for 5 minutes. I tried a couple that weren't rolled out as thin more like the video shows. These seemed to cook better in my lower heat aluminum skillet-the cast iron burned them before they cooked through. In short-more fat & salt = 5 stars

Great in a pinch when I wanted tortillas but didn't want to run out to the store. Easy recipe to remember. Used my stand mixer to knead. Fast, easy. Used a bit more lard than called for.

These were so easy and fast.  I didn't have Lard so I substituted butter and it was a hit.  My family of 5 ate them down as they were coming out of the pan.  I made about 12 larger tortillas from the batch.

I've made this recipe a few times now and served it to company.  Everyone loves it.  The extra work is worth the better than store bought results.  The only thing I change, as others have mentioned is that I find 24 tortillas to be fairly small tortillas while I prefer larger ones, so I make no more than 20 with a batch.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very easy to make. I used vegetable oil instead of lard and the tortillas tasted fine to me. To get a perfectly circle-shaped tortilla, I rolled out the dough and placed a small plate (turned upside down) on top of the dough and trimmed the excess dough around the plate with a butter knife. Will definitely make these again and again!!

These were FANTASTIC! I decided to grill carne asada for dinner but didn't have any tortillas, and since I'm 20 miles from town I had no choice but to try to make my own.  After reading reviews of several recipes I decided to try this one.  I used organic AP flour and used lard from a heritage breed, organically raised hog we recently had butchered.  I used about a half tablespoon more lard than called for (there was a small amount left in the jar so I just decided to use it all).  I also used hot water as some reviewers suggested. I had to dust with quite a bit of flour while rolling because the dough was somewhat sticky.  I ended up rolling them between parchment paper and that made it much easier.  These tortillas were absolutely addictive!  We could not stop eating them.  Even when dinner was over and everyone was stuffed we kept tearing off small pieces and sopping up the meat juices and beans with them.  I will never buy store bought tortillas again.  These were as easy as they were delicious.  Truly awesome recipe! Thanks!

I made the mistake of not rolling them out thin enough. It makes a big difference. And I sub'd shortening for lard, and even added a bit of margarine after the fact. I'm sure these would have been better with the lard but they were a good starting point for me. I recommend them.

Easy as pie. I think I put too much flour in (didn't have sifter). Felt a little dense. Recommend use a little more salt.

NEVER buying store bought tortillas EVER again.  Made half the recipe, exactly as it is written and cooked my tortillas in a plain, non-stick skillet.  Needed 8 enchilada sized tortillas for a recipe, so that was all I made out of half the recipe.  Cooked first side 10-17 seconds and the second side 6-10 seconds.  These are delicious!!  Just make them- you won't regret it!

I substituted butter for lard and whole wheat flour for the a-p (b/c that's all I had) and it worked just fine! I halved the recipe and maybe I didn't roll the tortillas out flat enough, but was only able to get 8 tortillas out of 2 cups of flour. I would definitely make this again! Thank-you LaDonna for sharing :)

First time making tortillas and these did not disappoint!  I scaled the recipe in half, used part whole wheat flour and made 8 tortillas. Cooked them in a dry cast iron skillet.  These cook very fast.  Literally in seconds.  Looking forward to seeing how the leftovers hold up.  The tortillas made great tacos.... didn't crack or leak at all!

REALLY YUMMY! Going to chose this recipe again! you CAN substitute lard for shortening (which is what I did). It turned out great! only thing with flour tortillas is there easy to make, just labor intensive if you roll out the tortillas by hand.

This is a pretty good tortilla recipe, it totally worked for me. I substituted vegetable shortening on account of a lack of lard, and the logistics of it worked fine, though you could notice a slight difference in taste. Rolling them out was a lot of worked, and achieving a round shape proved near impossible, but oh well, they're still tasty and soft and I'm proud to say I made them. Definitely will make this again.

I used shortening instead of lard, but I think it needs a bit more maybe 4 or 5 tablespoons to get that soft, chewy flour tortilla feel.

Bread, any kind of bread, has never been my strong suite.  This was wonderful though and all the more so because of so many other failures.  All I had was butter, so I used it instead of shortening and they still came out soft and wonderful.  I also used warm water to help soften the butter, and I had to use a lot of extra flour to kneed and to roll.  The dough was soft and fluffy, even with the extra flour.  Thank you La Donna, you made my day!

This was so easy and fun.  Very proud of myself to be able to whip up hot tortillas for breakfast!  One great thing is that I can keep it for several days in a zip lock in the frig and just roll out what I need.  It is a snap and so good served hot with butter and a cup of coffee!

Very good easy recipe!  
I added a can of tomato paste and some milled flax seed to mine.  Added some nice flavour!  Also made this with whole wheat flower and butter rather then lard, worked great.  I like my tortillas nice and big, so this made 1/2 as many for me as the recipe says.

This was my second attempt at tortillas and I liked this recipe best.  Used butter instead of lard since that is what I had.  Some were a bit crispy and didn't bubble well.  I definitely think it is a heating issue as I am using an electric griddle.  Will try another way of cooking and update soon.  Very easy to make and great recipe!  Thanks!

Made this tonight with my daughter, and they were awesome, and my hubby said they taste like his mom's and that was a awesome compliment. So, this one is a keeper, but i made them to big, and my daughter rolled them smaller, the smaller ones are better and when they are thinner. Hope you try this receipe, and I used butter, don't like preservatives. I rate this 7 outstanding!!!!!

AMAZING! I will never buy store-tortillas again! So easy, cheap and so delish!! I did let them rest for about 30 but mainly cos of the timing with dinner. Not sure if that made a difference. 

My one reccomendation is to roll them super thin, so they are almost transparent. Then they bubble nicely and easy to roll in burritos. The first one I did was maybe too thick and came out more like a frisbee... The rest I rolled super thin and they were beautiful. Also I didn't have lard so I used marg and they worked fine. 

I didn't make the full amount, I used 1 cup flour and that did enough for me and my 2 boys. Made 6 small/med tortillas.

I was really suprised how easy and delish these were. I kinda feel stupid for buying store bought tortillas all these years!

I made these tonight, they were so so GOOD, soft and easy to form for my burritos. The first few I wasn't rolling them thin enough, but once I got the knack it was so easy and the best tortilla's I have had! I also could not make perfect circles, but they wrapped better as slightly warped squares anyway :)

I used lard, unlike these others. I also made 24 of them in a small skillet. They were plenty big enough. I wrapped guacamole in some of them, and I buttered some of them. They were fantastic!

The only thing I wish is that it were possible to get better flour than the basic stuff you get at the store. I have a huge bag of it. Perhaps they would be even better with freshly milled grain.

Like others, I didn't have lard on hand. I subbed 1.5 T of butter in  half the recipe. I used these as a soft taco shell for taco beef, cheese, lettuce and onion and it was really good. It made 8 decent-sized shells. Perfectly for a family of four that includes two kids (5 and 4). I was using leftovers, but this would have been great for fajitas! Throw them in the oven with a damp cloth covering them and make the fajita filling in the hot pan you just used to cook the tortillas.

Awesome flavor.  My family won't eat grocery store tortillas again.  The stand mixer with the dough blade works like magic on this dough.  I just plopped all the ingredients in the bowl (no premixing) & turned the machine on.  No sticky hands....or bowls.   I used (unflavored) coconut oil instead of lard.  I also used coconut oil to lightly oil the pan.  Helped the tortilla get those large brown burn spots.  My only complaint is that by the time I got 1/2 - 3/4 the way thru the tortillas, my house was filled with smoke from the burning flour.  It happened the 1st time I made this & I used a dry pan that time, so I think it was burning flour.  Had to open windows & turn on the fan to prevent the smoke alarms from going off.

I had no problem separating this recipe into 24 balls & getting 8" roundish tortillas out of each one.  It does take some patience & determination with a rolling pin.  Each one was unique!

I don't have a tortilla warmer, so had to improvise with a technique I read about a while back.  I used damp kitchen towels on a plate.  Each time a tortilla was done, I'd put it between the soggy layers to soften the tortillas up while they sat.  Kept them moist & warm.

I love this recipe. I have found that they turn out just a little better when I use this high gluten flour I get sometimes. But they are good with regular flour too. I just use the whisk on my kitchen aid and it is a super easy recipe. I  make less, but larger tortillas. For me a this recipe is perfect making a dozen tortillas

Must use HOT water or you get pita thick. Love to make a couple dozen and have family over. They keep in a plastic bowl with a lid. I do not know how long they will keep. They usually get gone in a couple of days.

Well THAT was easy. Had no lard, used butter. Only wanted enough to make lunch, so winged the measurements and made two wraps. Perfect! (used organic unbleached flour).

Delicious and super easy!  I used whole wheat flour and butter instead of lard and all-purpose flour, and they came out perfect!  My hubby devoured these and since he likes bigger tortillas(these seemed really small), I made a dozen, instead of the 24.  Will definitely be doing it again.  Now I just need to work on making them perfectly round... :)

I don't keep lard in the house, and the only other semi-solid fat I had in the pantry was raw coconut oil. So I used that. They were delicious!

Tasting homemade tortillas will make you sorry you ever wasted time and money on store-bought. At least, that's how I felt. Store-bought tortillas are tasteless, with a gluey consistency: these are light, tender, and flaky, with a heavenly flavor. Once you master the trick of rolling them thin enough (doesn't take long), you will be turning these out for burritos and quesadillas like nobody's business.

I tried this recipe and I found that the recipe called for 4-5 table spoons of lard and 2- 2 1/2 cups of hot water, but other than that they came out great :) Thank you for the recipe :)Always knew the ingredients but I never knew how much to put into it.

This is so easy to make and very yummy recipe!  I've tried many other home made tortilla recipes in the past and none of them came out as good as this one.  I cut the recipe in a half and made only 6 big size tortillas.  Unfortunately the tortilla press I have was very helpful to roll out but not big enough.  I ended up streching each tortilla by hand after using the press.

I made these with 23 grade 3 students today and not only were they simple enough for the kids to make but they tasted great.  We added a bit extra lard so they wouldn't be as tough with that many hands mixing and they came out perfectly.

Wow! So good and so easy!!!! I didn't have lard... So I used cold butter.... worked fine and probably gave the tortillas a bit more flavor.  I used my kitchen aid mixer to mix ingredients and then switched to the dough hook to knead the dough. perfect! I was surprised how quickly they cook.... about 10-15 seconds per side. I'll definitely make these again!!!

Great!  I used half all-purpose flour, half whole whet, and added a bit more salt because of the whole wheat addition.

Used half corn flour and all-purpose.  Loved them as tortillas.  Also lightly browned the tortillas, then cut into "chips" and sprinkled with sea salt, baked for 8 minutes at 450, better than store bought!

5 Stars does not give this recipe enough credit! I stopped buying all breads from the store a few months ago and started baking all of our own. Today for lunch I whipped up some chicken and black bean soft tacos using these tortillas and my kids went wild with excitement when they bit into them. It was also an easy enough recipe for them to help, which is always amazing. Thank you so much for sharing our family's new favorite tortilla recipe!!!!!!

Loved it! 24 pieces does yield smaller pieces, but overall very good. I didn't have lard so I used 4 tbsp peanut oil instead.

Great recipe. I switched out the lard for margarine and used a pastry cutter, but other then that I followed the rest of the recipe and they turned out great. I like to cook apples with a little water and cinnamon and sugar and place in the center of the warm tortilla and roll up for a quick weeknight desert to use up the leftovers as they taste best fresh.

These turned out awesome.  I was a bit skeptical at first, but, they where soooo easy!  There will be a leaning curb on the shape, but, practice makes perfect.

Really good, really easy.  I would definetly add more salt next time.  I tried 1 1/2tsp of salt and it still was a little bland.  They were really fast, rolling them out took the longest but not bad.  I made 14 tortillas and they came out perfect for little tacos.  Nice and pliable, trick is to cook them really fast.  Only 60-90 seconds total in the frying pan.

Delicious and easy! I used shortening and warm water, as others suggested. The tortillas were deliciously soft and wonderful. I even used a normal nonstick frying pan (because I don't have a skillet), and it worked great. Thanks for the recipe!

loved these! I've never had 'real' flour tortillas before, but I much prefer these over the prepackaged kind. Mine turned out a little stiff, but I imagine that could be avoided if they were cooked over slightly lower heat (I think I had the heat on my gas stove cranked up to high).

This was a great recipe. It's really easy-it just takes time to roll out the individual tortillas thin enough, at least for someone like me who's just learning to make tortillas.

Super easy and delicious!  I used the fat from the ground beef in my green chilli stew instead of lard. I just measured it and put it in a bowl and in the freezer for a minute to make it solid.

Wow!!! I'm bread challenged and yet I pumped the out in just lest then and hour. I also didn't feel like going to store for one thing so I made them. Like some of the other reviews I used margarine and made half the amount.  Perfect!!! I would suggest rolling dough out and stretching it a bit too, they are yummy though. Thanks

The first 2 weeks after I tried this recipe, I made almost nothing but tortilla-related things. I tried this recipe with wheat flour too and I thought it worked better. At the very least, it was much easier to flatten with a rolling pin. Very delicious and very easy to make.

My first time attempting to make tortillas and these turned out great!!! They tasted WAY better than store bought, and when comparing the nutrition facts, there is just no way I'm going back. I halved the recipe and used half white, half wheat flour. Turned out fine! I'm going to make these time and time again. (If anything, just to get rid of the HUGE block of lard I bought.)

Excellent recipe! I used margerine in mine. They didn't brown up like I wanted them to, but they were great nonetheless. Maybe I didn't have the heat up high enough?

Absolutely the best square tortilla's! (Ok so my rolling skills are not so good, but my kids love to giggle at the shapes.) So simple, So quick and So very good.. Everyone raves over these every time I make them.

Very good  We just got finished making them.  Next time we would use a little more salt as they didn't have as much as we usually use (I know not good for our diet but we use it sparingly anyway).  And we got 23 tortillas.  They make about a small taco size.  Great as we have a small child so it would be perfect for him for PB&J roll ups too.

This is my 3rd recipe and my third try at tortillas, wow is all I can say. This was the easiest and they came out great. I couldn't stop eating them. I did play with it a bit, I used 3 tablespoons of lard and I added 1 tbl of thyme and 1 tbl of mexican oregano to my flour, added a wonderful flavor.

My husband made these this evening to go with my Chicken Tortilla Soup - they were tasty and he seemed to have a fairly easy time of it and was able to roll them out nice and thin :)

These were very tasty, much better than storebought flour tortillas. I used vegetable shortening instead of lard and I also used warm water like other reviewers. These were very hard to roll out very thin how we like our tortillas, but they still tasted good. For us this recipe made about 18 nicely sized tortillas. Thanks for the great and very easy recipe!

Yum!  I followed the recipe exact except for using 1 cup of whole wheat flour with 3 cups all purpose.  So much better and way healthier than the ones stuffed with chemicals and preservatives at the store!

This recipe was the best!  This was my first time making homemade tortillas and it was perfect.  I did use shortening instead of lard.  I don't even know if you can buy lard at the store?  Either way my 4 year old helped and we had a blast making them.  They were soft and pliable.  I kept them folded in a towel until cooled and stored in the fridge in a ziploc bag.   They haven't even stuck together.  My husband who is a very picky eater has been practically living off of them!  Who needs store bought when you can make your own and they taste so much better!  AWSOME!!!!!

WOW! This is a great recipe. I thought that making my own tortillas would be a lot harder than it turned out to be! I followed recipe exactly. I wanted larger tortillas for burritos and got about 14. Definitely worth the effort....I don't think I will buy ones from the store again. Wondering if and how you can freeze these?

I have made these several times.  They are tasty but I have a very hard time making them as thin as I want them.  Also, I get very jagged edges.  They look funny, I would never make them for guests.  I'll be experimenting with them more.  Hopefully I'll eventually get them right.

OH MY GOODNESS!! These are SO yummy and easy!  I will NEVER buy store bought tortillas again! I'll probably invest in a tortilla press to cut down on time, but a rolling pin does the trick until I get one. I substituted 2C. flour with Whole Wheat flour, and used Coconut Oil instead of lard. (I also used a bit more than 2T.) These were FANTASTIC and I plan on making them from now on! :)

My husband and I live in Korea and we have been craving good tortillas! These are awesome. I couldn't find any lard, butter, or shortening at the store, so I used oil. I think they turned out a little different than if I had used a solid. They also came out a little puffy and bready, but I like it that way : )

These do taste better than store bought, but I have better recipes. I wanted to try this because it had less fat, and no resting required.  Turns out that's what's needed to make good tortillas.  This recipe needs the lard doubled and the dough needs to rest for at least 20-30 min.

Great recipe!  Very easy to make.  I came out with about 12 medium size tortillas following the recipe exactly.  The texture and taste reminded me of the tortillas we get with fajitas at our fav Mexican restaurant.

My Mexican husband loved these and kept telling me that I didn't understand, tortillas are really, really difficult to make so say all the Mexican women he knows.  Not this recipe!  He was impressed.  Next time I'll try using cornmeal as he prefers corn tortillas.  Can't wait!

Perfect! I've made homemade tortillas quite a few times before and these turned out the best of all. They rolled out easily and very thin, they were pliable and very scrumptious!

Followed recipe, but used Kitchenaid mixer with dough hook to mix dough.  Kneaded by hand.  The tortillas rolled out beautifully, with the help of my nine-year old sons.  Results were delicious and tasted straight out of our favorite Mexican restaurant.  Just try not to sample one hot off the grill!

This was my first attempt at making tortillas, and they turned out pretty well!  I had a hard time rolling them out to proper thinness, so I just made half of what the recipe called for.  They seemed a little stiff at first (might have added too much flour) but tasted great with enchiladas.

Wow is all I can say!  Absolutely wonderful.  I have never made tortillas before and I will continue to make these forever.  They were perfect.  I used crisco instead of lard.  They were pliable and extremely easy to roll out.  I hope it wasn't beginners luck.  You must try these if you want to impress guests!!

Agree with some of the other comments about adding flour since it was such a sticky dough.  This recipe is extraordinarily easy and goof proof.  I loved the texture.

Great.  This was my first time to make tortillas and it was very easy.  My first few were too thick.  They were perfect when I rolled them ultra thin.  Just note it does not take long for each tortilla to cook.  I just watched it and after about 1 minute, it was ready to flip. The tortilla slightly bubbled before I flipped it.  Also, I used a cast iron skillet and did not use any cooking spray.  Will be making these again and again.

My mom tried to teach me how to make tortillas.  She never measures, just eyeballs it since she's been making them for over 30 years.  Well i couldnt catch on b/c of that but your recipe tastes just like moms and the taste and smell is WONDERFUL!  thanks for making it easy for me :)

fantastic recipe! I had tried to make tortillas months ago with another recipe on this site.  My arms were aching trying to roll out the dough.  I decided to try again today with this recipe which was MUCH easier to roll out nice and thin.  My family loved them.  Will definitely make again.

I made sure that the water was as hot as the tap could get it & used margarine instead of lard (because I didn't have any on hand)  I threw it all in my bread machine to do the kneading for me, and they turned out great!!!  I also divided into 12 instead of 24 to make larger tortillas.  Needed lots of flour to roll, but definitely better than the store-bought variety.

Delicious!  I made 1/2 of recipe and was able to make 12 soft taco sized tortillas.  The dough was soft and easy to roll.  Very easy recipe and way better than store bought tortillas!

These did take some time but BOY were they worth it!  I did add a bit of cumin and garlic powder and was very pleased with the taste.  I took out some sauce and ate some as I made them!  No more store bought for me!  Thanks LaDonna for sharing.

I used this recipe as a first for making tortillas.  The dough worked up fine, I used some margarine as I thought it would add more flavor than shortening.  They were easy to roll out, and cook, but flavor seemed lacking.  I am going to try the Authentic Mexican Tortillas on this site next--the percentage of fat to flour is quite a bit higher, and I actually rendered some backfat lard and think I will use that.

My family thought these were good.  When I asked them if we should use these again or go back to store bought shells it was a unanimous vote for these.  I just could not make them with lard, vegetable shortening was bad enough.  I do not have a rolling pin yet, so I rolled them out with a plastic cup, surprisingly my resourcefulness worked.  They are somewhat pita like, but we liked that (probably because I couldn't get them thin enough, or the lack of lard).    Oh and I used hot water like others suggested.    Recipe for me yielded about 15 shells a bit bigger than my hand.

These are so much better than any tortillas I've ever had! My boys like to eat them plain, or made into "Mexican pizzas." I make them into about 16 tortillas instead of 24. They are bigger and thicker that way.

The tortillas are fantastic! You can add seasoning to them, creole of fajita seasonings are good. You can replace part of the water with left over beer instead of dumping it out--tasty. The only problem with the recipe is that it makes 8 large tortillas, not 24, large enough for burritos.

Very easy to make! I remembered seeing this recipe on here before I ran off to the store. My picky eater son, and husband loved these. I used half wheat flour and half white, and used butter and heated the water. I ended up with 13 tortillas not 24. :)

these were excellent, a bit labor intensive to make sure that they were thin enough. I think I will be making these for special occasions, and when I don't want to run out and buy some. For the most part I probably will be buying store bought they go so fast in my househould that 24 doesn't last that long. I put a couple in the microwave with some olive oil spray and salt, and cooked for 2 min. They make excellent chips too.

I want to give it 5 stars for taste, but only 3 for the amount it made.  The recipe states that it makes 24 tortillas.  Those were some pretty small tortillas.  I only made 12 tortillas with the dough, which ended up being about the right size.

Haha, first try!  Tasted like tortillas!  Not round and a bit thick, but still very yummy!!!  Do not use grease in the pan,and try to remember while rolling that they will thicken when you cook them.  :)

These are okay, but take some effort. I wold not make them regularly because they are not easy to roll out. They taste great though and my family gobbled them up. Everybody had about 3 or 4. I froze the remaining dough because I was getting sick of trying to get them thin enough! I hope it will roll out okay for next time.

Halving the recipe, I made 6 big tortillas that were perfect for the three of us at home. A very simple-to-make recipe, that is cheaper than the store bought ones we were buying!

I just made these this morning and they are great! The dough had just the right amount of elasticity and was so easy to work with. I used warm water and they puffed up really nicely. Will be using this recipe again. Thanks for sharing!

I never made tortillas before - couldn't have been easier. They rolled out nicely - maybe cause I'm used to rolling out pie crust I didn't have a problem. But they cooked up nicely also. I wasn't sure if I should use a bit of olive oil when cooking them - so I did with some - those are the ones that had the best browned bumps. Was I supposed to. Also I did it in a stick free pan - didn't have a cast iron - worked great.

I didn't have lard, so I used Crisco shortening.  They were good!  Made 12-8" tortillas out of them.  Tried using a pastry cutter to mix the Crisco into the flour but that wasn't necessary - just use your fingers as it says.  Added hot water and mixed in with a spoon until it held together.  Rolled out with extra flour.  Mine didn't come out round, but they still worked!  Used these with the "Fabulous Wet Burritos" reciple from this site.  Very good!

I had lost my recipe for tortillas, and was so happy to have it back.....Oh and my recipe called for warm water, which I feel is best.
