I have cooked this 2x's now and learned from my mistakes.  Two MAJOR CHANGES you need to make.  1.) WAY to much bread crumbs, it was like eating crumbled saltines.  Use 2 cups of Apples and 1 cup bread crums. (Recipe wanted 3 cups bread crumbs).  2.) DO NOT cook for 1 hour or it will get too dry.  Cook for 20 minutes with foil on and 20 with foil off.   With those 2 changes this is a GREAT recipe.

This was great!! I did change just a couple of things for my taste. I used cranberries in the stuffing because I love cranberries and they go great with apples. The stuffing was a little dry for us so I used some apple cider to moisten it up some. I did not even have left overs to send for my hubby's lunch the next day. I will definatly make again. Thanks

This recipe was good but I made it for a friend who is not bread stuffing eater..Instead I did rice with chopped apples and crumbled bacon added a slice of bacon around each chop and baked as for seasoning well I always add what I like no matter what it calls for we all have our own tastes and for the ones who said it is bland well all meat is bland until we make it wonderful. you must have a creative mind in the kitchen even if your following a recipe... Thanks for sharing *Blessing's From Oregon*

Very good recipe!  I too made some changes which I think really made it better.  After chopping the apples, I let them soak in apple juice for about 30 minutes.  I used more of the stuffing ingredients and added about 2 cups of apple juice and about 2 tsps. of poultry seasoning and garlic salt.  After stuffing the chops, I wrapped them with a piece of bacon before pan frying.  I put all the left over stuffing in the bottom of the pan and put the chops on top and cooked as instructed.  YUMMY!!

WOW! These were delicious! I used stove top prepared instead of bread cubes, added some cooked sausage & used a granny smith apple (great flavor). I also used a brown sugar glaze on top - 1/2c brown sugar mixed with 1/4c melted butter & spread over top of chops (only 4 chops). This recipe is a definite keeper! Thanks alot!

I found this recipe to very easy and economical.  First go to Costco or Sams Club and buy a whole boneless loin (about 1.99 per pound x 7 lbs).  Cut the loin in 1 inch chops (makes about 17). Buy a box of Stove Top stuffing and add a granny smith apple (diced).  Stuff the chops, brown and put them in the oven.  EASY, EASY, EASY!

Made some changes to this great recipe because my wife has to stay away from bread and sugar.  I replaced the bread with a cup of Old Fashioned Oatmeal, 1/3 cup Splenda(sugar), 1/3 cup raisens, dash of nutmeg, then the rest of the ingrediannts.  I used only 4 pork chops and put the leftover apple, oat, raisen mixture and spred it over the browned pork chops for baking.  What came out of the oven was beautiful and taisted heavenly.

I found this recipe very bland.  I tried it again, but this time I marinated the chops for 1 hour with olive oil, apple brandy, fresh chopped thyme, bay leaves, salt & pepper.  I pan-seared the chops on all sides and then roasted for 15 to 20 minutes at 325 degrees (internal temp should be 155 to 160 degrees.).  The wife and kids loved it.

This is fabulous!  I added 1/4 cup of apple juice to the stuffing, it was delicious and very moist!  Would HIGHLY recommend.  I prepared it in the morning and refrigerated it until that night.  A little prep work, but well worth it!

This recipe was sooo good!!!  I read from other reviews that the stuffing and chops turned out a lil dry so I poured some apple juice in the stuffing.  I didn’t make any other changes and it turned out wonderful!  I am very happy with the results!  It was a lil time consuming but it was well worth it!  I’m definitely gonna make this one again! Thanks so much for sharing this one!!!

Very good, but I altered slightly.  After reading the reviews about the stuffing, I decided to cut some corners and used a box of Stove Top Savory Herb stuffing.  
I sauteed the onions, then added the apples and lightly sauteed them as well.  Then I just mixed it all in with the Stove Top and followed the rest of the recipe as written.

Pork was delicious, stuffing was moist and flavorful.  I did have extra stuffing, but just put in the dish with the pork chops for baking.

Please ignore the review by Dwight below; this recipe is just fine the way it is. If he had actually READ the recipe and used FRESH bread crumbs instead of dried, his version would have turned out the way mine did: tender, juicy and perfectly cooked.

Yummy! I only gave it 4 stars bc you need to make some changes. I used only 1 cup of dry bread crumbs which was PLENTY. Also, it was really dry so I put a splash of white wine in at the end to moisten the stuffing. Like other reviewers said, DON'T bake it for the time it says. I did 20 min. covered and 20 min. uncovered and it was perfect. Very tasty, nice fall recipe!

I reduced the recipe to feed 2 people and made the recipe as suggested,  adding a little more onion and butter. I also added Rubbed Sage and used  (2) granny smith apples. I didn't find the recipe dry in the slightest. I think the problem some of the others had with dryness was possibly because they didn't use "FRESH BREAD CRUMBS" (takes approx. 5 slices of bread to make one cup (do not pack it). The stuffing should be wet and you should be able to shape it into a ball (not that you need to. I love this recipe, so does my husband.

These are the changes I made: Fry in skillet the butter, onions, apples, rosemary, and celery. Add at last minute the parsley and chopped toast (instead of boxed stuffing or bread crumbs) with a table spoon of brown sugar. Also the thinner the pork the less oven time.

This is execellent! My chops were a good 1 inch thick and cut from the striploin. The cooking time was a little too long even though I started with chops that were only partially thawed.
For the gravy I left some small amount of the stuffing in the fry pan (just what fell out of the chops during browning)and added chicken stock and flour/water mix.

I have always doubt when I cooked pork chops as it always dry and hard. This time it was different, it turned out so GOOD! The meats were tender, moist & tasty. I did a couple changes to increase the taste. I marinated the pork chop with apple juice, chicken stock, garlic & onion powder + salt & pepper for ½ hour; add chicken stock, apple juice and crispy bacon in the bread stuffing. Then pour the juice from the meat from time to time while baking it to keep it moist. My husband said it was so delicious! We will certainly cook it for guests next time. It’s the best recipe for pork chop for us! Thank you.

I made this the other day with french cut pork loins and let me tell you, this is AMAZING! My husband tried this when he came home from work ( he works 2nd shift and I work 1st shift) and when he came to bed at 3AM, he couldn't stop raving about it! He said they were the best pork chops he ever had! The apples are great in this. They give it a nice sweet taste. I went with the advice from another reviewer about how to cook it though. I wrapped them in foil and cooked them for 20 minutes then cooked them for another 20 minutes without the foil. They came out so tender.I absolutley love this recipe!

This recipe has promise.  I made it exactly as stated,except that I did not have celery.  I think to review & rate a recipe honestly that you SHOULD make it the first time the way that it is written, otherwise how is your review honest?  With that said, and with no celery,  I liked the recipe.  I made my own fresh bread crumbs.  I did chop my apples rather large b/c other reviews said that thier apples turned to mush.  Next time I'll chop them smaller & add some pecans.

Very good,  although it started to dry out a little bit.  I poured a little white wine over ir to keep it moist,  which added nice flavour to the gravy later!  Nice recipe.

This recipes was very interesting.  It was tasty but just a bit dry.  I might moisten the stuffing next time using applesauce to bring out more of the apple flavor.  Otherwise, delicious.

This was ok.  I did do somethings a bit different though.  I used pork flavored stove top, I just sauteed some onion, celery, and apple in butter then combined with stove top.  I cooked the chops under the time on recipe and they still dried out.  I think I would make again but used a pork loin instead.

This recipe was excellent! Made it for my family and they absolutely loved it! I used about half the amount of bread crumbs the recipe called for and added some apple juice to the stuffing so it wasn't so dry. i will definitely be making this again!

Will defintely make this again. The only thing I changed was the cooking time. Baked covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for 15 minutes. The pork chops were perfect. Any longer and they would have been too dry. Was a hit in my household.

I thought this was so delicious that I had to sign up to allrecipes.com just so I could post a review! I added garlic when I sauteed the onion. Also, I used about 1/2 of the bread crumbs (as others have mentioned it was WAY too much listed in the recipe). To make the stuffing a bit more moist I added some cranberry juice to give it a little kick. Other than that I followed the recipe word for word and it was FANTASTIC. 5 stars for sure!

The stuffing for this was wonderful.  I ended up using 1.5 pieces of wheat bread for a half recipe.  I chopped it into small pieces (kind of like stuffing) rather than making it crumb like.  I think it added a little more texture.  I didn't bake it because I'm always worried about over cooking them.  I used the Stuffed Pork Chops III method of cooking them...brown on each side then simmer in beef broth.  It takes less time and they come out tender and juicy.  My husband said this is his favorite stuffed pork chop recipe now and would like it again.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

I will normally follow a recipe as written the first time I make it, then tweak it to my taste in the future.  However, when I added the breadcrumbs it was just way, way too dry, so I added in an egg and some water to moisten it and help it stick together.  It came out tasting absolutely moist and delicious, and I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers.

Perfectly delicious fall recipe!  I stayed pretty true to the recipe with the exception of doubling the amount of onions used (I wanted the stuffing a little more savory) and I used a 2 lb. pork loin which I sliced 1/2 through lengthwise and stuffed it (after seasoning it inside and out with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning) and cooked it 1/2 hour with foil, 1/2 hour without PERFECT.  I also made a gravy using pan drippings, chicken stock, and apple cider - seasoning it to taste.  I highly recommend using fresh bread crumbs (I used fresh bread and ran it through the food processor) and unlike other reviewers - did NOT think there was too much bread.  This is a fantastic recipe and is a great way to use pork.  Will be a regular in the fall meal rotation!

First I raised the oven temp by about 15° and baked for only about 35-40 minutes. Some reviewers had issues with the flavor - apples that best retain flavor during cooking are usually the crisp, green variety, such as Granny Smith. The stuffing was pretty dry in the beginning. Adding about 2/3 cup green apple-pear juice made it moist enough. There was more stuffing than could fit into the chops so it just went into the baking dish too. No celery since I didn't have any...this was very good. With the changes I give this 4 stars, 3 without. Husband liked it too. Thank you for this simple, flavorful idea!

I made the stuffing with pears and cranberries as I didn't have any apples on hand.  I also added an egg to hold the stuffing together.  Instead of stuffing the porkchops (mine were too thin) I put the stuffing in a glass dish and nestled the chops in the stuffing and cooked it all like that.  Everyone in the family loved it.

These were very tender and tasty, even my daughter who usually shuns meat, liked these.
I made them in my iron skillet (so I didn't have to use another pan) and added apple juice to the bottom of the pan before I baked it.  I did use Mrs. Cubbison's corn bread stuffing mix and added liquid to the stuffing.  I won't add liquid next time.

Yams would make a nice side dish.  Will definetly make this again.

Loved this recipe.  I didn't use bread crumbs.  I used dry bread.  I also cooked the onion and celery in butter until they were soft.  I added salt and poultry seasoning.  I soaked the apples in some apple cider and then poured the whole thing in when I mixed it together.  I also added some chicken broth.  I took the advice from someone else and baked it covered for 20 min. and uncovered for 20.  It was perfect.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I did not follow the recipe exactly, but it turned out DELICIOUS!  I used some suggestions from other reviews.  With the onion and butter, I added garlic salt, poultry seasoning and 3-4 slices of bacon cut up.  I also only added about 3/4 cup of bread crumbs and a sleeve of ritz crackers crumbled up with apple juice added for good moisture.  I did not stuff the chops because I knew my kids wouldn't like it, so I browned the chops (with oil and salt and pepper) and put them on top of the stuffing in the pan, poured some more apple juice on top and cooked as instructed.  Towards the end I made sure to mix some of the stuffing mix on top of the pork chops so they would be nicely flavored.  Excellent!

I left out the bread crumbs (sounded too bready and dry from other reviews) and just did the stuffing with apples, celery, onions, butter,vermouth (white wine would do if I had it) and cherries since that's what I had on hand rather than cranberries which someone else suggested,nice colour too. Stuffing 4-5 stars, might try it with chicken, but the meat was still a bit bland if you didn't eat every bite with some stuffing.  I think will try the review that suggested a marinade and glaze for the meat.

As I usually do, I changed this up a bit by adding some pineapple juice to the stuffing mixture, wrapping each chop in two pieces of bacon (secured by toothpick) and grilled them.  Just before serving I grilled pineapple slices and placed them on top (see picture).  Great recipe and for my family's taste made even better with the additions.

This recipe was pretty good. I wouldnt' follow the directions completely. The thing I did different was...Not to add so much bread crumbs (It makes it to dry and crumy). Add half then what it says to and replace it with more apples. I also took apple sauce and mixed it with water and poured that ontop of the dish before I put it into the oven. Just so it wouldnt be so dry. Over all it was a crowd pleaser.

Great1  After reading 6 reviews I cut way back on bread ( actually I used Pepperidge farms stuffing ) wrapped in in prosciutto which helped hold in the stuffing and added a saltyness.  My wife wanted to know if I made any extra. Must have been good.

I made this for my dinner club (10 people) and everyone loved it.  It was easy to make for a large crowd.  I took the advice of others and added some apple juice to moisten it up a little.  Definately a keeper.  I'll make this one again.

After reading all the reviews of this recipe, I decided to give it a try... It was delicious, and I figured out that the reason people feel that it's so dry is that they are most likely using DRY bread crumbs - not fresh ones... which are much moister. 
Try this - it's good!!

I have made this recipe time and time again and actually used it for a recipe to give to a bride to be at her shower on the recipe cards.  It is wonderful but be careful not to over cook the pork chops.  Just brown them on the stove top because if you leave them on too long you will cook them through and then overcook in oven.  I use bone in pork chops - I find they have more flavor.  I also make my own bread crumbs.  I use a whole loaf of white bread- remove the ends and cut into pieces about 2x2.  I put them flat on a cookie sheet and in the oven for about 10 minutes at 325 turning once so they are dry.  Enjoy- this is a great recipe.  Thanks a bunch.

Tried this recipie for the first time on Easter Sunday.  This was very different for our family.  Overall, it got pretty good reviews.  I did follow the tip of someone and add some apple juice to the stuffing.  Also I browed the pork before stuffing (another good tip I read).  It made it much easier this way.  Wasn't too time consuming.  I did add some gravy over top to help with the dryness.  Good recipie, wasn't outstanding, but will use it again.  Thanks.

My husband and I thought this recipe was great! I did increase the apples, added a little more celery, added 1 Tbsp of apple juice, 2 Tbsp of buttermilk and 1/4 C of chopped walnuts. There was extra stuffing, so I put it on top of and around the chops. I sprinkled them with a few pinches of cinnamon and baked it 20 minutes with foil and then 20 minutes without. I'm keeping this in my recipe arsenal for sure!

I took some license with the ingredients, using homemade dried cubes of bread I crushed, added some garlic powder, a little tarragon, dried parsley. Used less butter, added the stuffing, s&p the chops, browned, baked 40 minutes covered. This tasted great! Thanks for the recipe and the idea!

We enjoyed the pork chops. I did cook a full hour to make sure meat temp was 170deg F; I added some liquid in the pan for extra stuffing I had and that provided good moisture for the dish. I reduced the bread crumbs by 1/2 and that was just right.

Delicious!  There was a lot of bread crumbs and we ended up leaving about two cups out.
****After almost two years, this our favorite fall pork chop recipe!

Everyone in this house says this is one we can do weekly. I sprinkled ground ginger and paprika on my chops before frying them. Five thumbs up mate!!!

Very good although I improvised on a few things. First my chops weren't thick enough like I thought they were. I fried garlic, apple, onion, and celery with some butter. Added the bread crumbs to find out that 2 cups was WAY too much. So I fried the chops with MORE onion and garlic when they were half way done used the juice from cooking them to fix the stuffing issue. Still not quite enough I added some water. Put the stuffing into the baking dish laid the chops on top and from there everything FINALLY went well. Came out GREAT though. I would definitely reccommend it and it's a keeper but next time I will have to change a few things.

Not the greatest recipe.  It tuned out really dry and chewy even when I used fresh breadcrumbs like other reviewers suggested.  The taste of the filling was alright, but just SO DRY.  I get lots of recipes off of this site, and my husband eats ANYTHING, and this is one dish he didnt like at all.  Will not make again.

These were fantastic! I have never made anything like these before, and I was a little nervous. They went together so easily and turned out wonderful. My family (who are very skeptical to try anything new) loved these. I followed the advice of another reviewer and only used 1 cup of bread crumbs, and after I started making them I realized that I was out of fresh celery. I replaced the regular salt with celery salt and it worked just fine. Super recipe.. will for sure be making these again.

I modified recipe a bit to cater to  gluten-free plus heart healthy diet needs.  I used olive oil in place of butter and vegetable oil.  I used GF Raisin Bread (does not have cinnamon).  Since other reviews stated recipe was bit dry, and I had no apple juice as was suggested, I used Cherry Ginger Brew (22% ginger).  The combination of flavors was fabulous, like a gourmet dish, with the bonus of being GF and loaded with hearth healthy ingredients.  Thanks for the basic recipe.  It was wonderful.

This was delicious.  I did alter it slightly and used three golden delicious apples and steamed them and then made and apple sauce, I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and then transfered it to a skillet where I had fried 1 red diced onion in a tablespoon of butterand added 2 cups of dry breadcrumbs.  I then stuffed 4 pork chops with the stuffing, fried them as above but then baked for 20 minutes with foil and 20 without!  Delicious

This recipe was so tasty!  I used pumpernickle and rye bread because I didn't have white bread available- that kicked up the flavor of the stuffing just enough.

The stuffing was excellent!  I shortened the cooking time, and cooked them covered in a skillet on the stove with some white wine added to keep them moist.

These were pretty good but needed some modifications.  First off, I seasoned the pork chops in sage, rosemary, and thyme.  Then I used dry stuffing mix but moistened it with chicken stock.  I used the remaining stuffing to surround the pork in the baking dish.  Pretty good!

I thought this was a great recipe to alter.  I used Apple-Cinnamon applesauce and Herb Stuffing.  I just mixed the stuffing by eye and taste. I had no problem with the meat drying out.  I did moisten the stuffing mix before stuffing the chops.  I just baked mine for about 40 minutes on 315.  They were wonderful!! Very flavorful, you could really taste the apple sauce and there was the distinct crunch of the onions and celerey. Great and pretty easy to make too!!!

This recipe rocked.  Everyone loved it. I did increase the onion to 1/4 cup and the butter to 1/2 cup because it cooked up with the extra onions.  I used pork stovetop as a side dish with the suggested add-ins of apples and onion (back of box) and it was a great compliment to the chops.

We really like this recipe, but as other reviews have said, it needs more moisture.  Next time, we will definitely add apple juice or cider.  (Sad, since we have some cider in the fridge!)  We might also add some cranberries to add to the "fall" flavor.  Overall, this was really good and we'll be making it again!!
Thanks Nancy!

WE MADE THIS PER THE RECIPE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF REPLACING THE SALT AND PEPPER WITH CAJUNLAND'S GREEN ONION SEASONING.  IT WAS EXCELLENT.  I THINK WOULD WORK WELL WITH VEAL, TOO.  I THINK THIS WOULD BE AWESOME CHRISTMAS EVE OR CHRISTMAS DAY DINNER.  I just used this to make a stuffed pork loin for my husband's children/grandchildren Easter dinner.  It was superb!

I would have given this 5 stars but it was, indeed, a little dry.  I added poultry seasoning as others have suggested and next time I will marinate the chops before prepping.  All in all, an excellent recipe though!

this was the driest stuffing I've ever made and even added liquid to it and it was still awful so we ate the chops and tossed the stuffing out before we choked To say the least some kind of liquid had to have been left out. I've been cooking for 35 plus years so I know a thing or two

This was a pleasant surprise. Kind of like porkchops & applesauce.. I had a pork shoulder steak to use. So I pounded it flat in plastic wrap, and made a little roulade with the filling (held it together with toothpicks). Cook as the recipie indicates and the meat pounded flat cooks quite quickly. Yummy.

This was very good.  I also added some sausage to the stuffing.  I suggest the cooking time be reduced by a few minutes so that the meat doesnt dry out.  The stuffing had a wonderful flavor (I cheated and used Pepperidge Farms Savory Herb bread cubes.)

This didn't at all turn out to taste like what I was hoping.  It was very bland.  The meat had no flavor what so ever.  The outside of the stuffing was good but the inside was way to mushy.  If I did make it again I would change alot of things. Seasoning the meat differently, perhaps adding nuts to the stuffing and maybe basting with maple syrup(that goes well with pork)  I just dont think that the flavor was worth the $9 per pound for the porkchops.

Fairly easy, although several steps are involved.  Not as much flavor as I had hoped.  A sauce made with leftover apples would really as punch to the flavor.

I made this for a special dinner.  It was very good!  I added a little mashed sweet potato, a couple of spoonfuls of apple sauce and a splash of chardonnay to the stuffing.  Gave a little extra flavor.  Served with home made warm chunky apple sauce.  Nice combination and yummy!  A fair amount of work, but worth it.  Hint:  Pan brown the chops before stuffing them.

This was a good recipe, but I found it to be a little bland. Not a bad thing, we like alot of flavor. I am going to make a few changes the next time I make this. First, sauteing the apples and celery with the butter, maybe add a clove or two of garlic, adding a 1/4 cup of chicken broth, and throwing in a 1/2 teaspoon of dried rosemary for some flavor. All in all, we enjoyed this recipe, thanks!

Delicious!! the stuffing wasnt easy to keep in, and there was a lot left over, so we poured the remaining in the 9x13 pan, surrounding the chops. we also used toothpicks to try and keep the stuffing in the chops. It was delicious though. Very well put together.

Thank you for this recipe - its awesome and one of my favorites for fall. Followed original and just added some cranberries, and after browning in skillet did 20 mins in oven with foil and 20 without foil, which thoroughly cooked and sealed in moisture! Poured on brown sugar and pumpkin butter glaze for finishing touch. Pork never tasted so good!

I don't like stuffing, but hubby does.  My in-laws came to visit and he asked me to make these.  They absolutely loved them!  I followed the recipe the first time, then did a few things my way the second.  Both ways turned out wonderful.  Will certainly do it again!

These were kind of blah. I added like others said to do with apple juice and still just blah. I think pork is kind of boring anyway and this really did not do much for me.

try wrapping the chops after they have been stuffed, with a cured ham thinly sliced! any ham will do, the more fat the better....i use a Russian ham called Muscovite ( Odessa style ), it's a pork loin roll that is salted and cured. i also added sharp cheddar to the stuffing.

This is a great recipe!  It was a hit with my company.  I had no fresh bread crumbs, so used plain dried bread crumbs, but only 2/3 cup instead of 3.  It was perfect!

This was a very tasty chop recipe.  I didn't have the time to make my own bread crumbs so I used store bought ones, the stuffing mix came out a little too dry when I mixed all the ingredients together so I added a 1/2 cup of apple cider to the mix it came out very juicy and tasty!

I plan on trying this with some of the other suggestions.  My stuffing felt very pasty while eating it.  Plus, never having had stuffed pork chops, I had hoped that the apple flavor would be a bit stronger than it was.  Is it supposed to be as bland as it was, I honestly don't know if I was expecting something that isn't supposed to be.  I do see the possibility for tweeking to fit my families taste buds.

Great idea with lots of potential, but lacking in flavor. It needs some sage or something.  My husband suggested cinnamon would be good.  Also, it made much too much stuffing - I'd cut back on the amount of bread crumbs and make sure to buy really flavorful apples.

It was a good recipe. I created it for my family and they loved it. Though be advice on the recipe to put more apples than the bread crumbs to taste the apples.

I have to agree with another reviewer on this one.  The stuffing is as dry as graham cracker crumbs and I even added extra butter and 1/2 c of apple juice!  Some liquid HAS to be left out here.  I also baked only 30 min covered and another 15 uncovered.  Plenty done.  
I'll never make this again.  A real waster of all the time and ingredients in the stuffing.  I'm an experienced cook.  I should have known better, but thought maybe the apples after baking would add more moisture. It didn't.  Couldn't even taste the apples, just crumbs.  And like the other reviewer, I threw over 1/2 of the stuffing away - way too much bread crumbs.  I did add another 1/2 c of apple juice to the pan before covering and baking.  Chops were moist.  That's the only good part. Some of these reviews are very disappointing.  I would suggest that if you can't cook, don't rate/review.

Yummy! DO NOT put in 3 cups of the bread crumbs! I threw away more than half of the mixture.Also when I took the cover off, I baked it only for 15 more minutes, and it was great!

This was OK.  My niece enjoyed them but my husband and I weren't thrilled.  I did add additional butter because the stuffing seemed rather dry.  Might try it again and add some white wine or something to add some flavor!

I am not a great cook and this one was easy and very good.  My husband said it was one of the best I have made.  Slightly sweet stuffing went great with the pork chops.  I slightly undercooked the pork for juicer meat.

this was delicious basic recipe for the stuffing- i took others suggestions and added my own.  i used Pepperidge Farm stuffing bread crumbs. Did use liquid as others suggested (3/4 cup total but did a mix of apple juice and chicken broth)  I also sauteed the apple and celery with the onion.  I used only 1 apple and 1 whole onion.  I also did not brown the chops before baking; but i did sprinkle some cinnamon/sugar over the top.

The pork chops were really yummy and went over well with my guests.  The stuffing however, was a little mushy and not as flavorful as I was hoping it would be.  I will make this again, but next time I will add a little more seasoning to the stuffing.

Didn't like this very much.  I followed the advice of other reviews and added some apple sauce and apple juice to make it moister but the stuffing came out like mush.  The flavor was great but the texture was terrible.  Probably won't make this again.  Sorry

This meal was excellent!  I added some apple juice to make sure that the pork chops were moist.  The end result was wonderful...restaurant-like meal!  Two days later, I reheated leftovers, and again added apple juice, and the results were wonderful!  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This was a great recipe and a nice way to prepare pork chops. As others have said, they did come out a bit dry. I would defintitely add the apple juice/cider or even some chicken broth to the recipe just to give it a little extra moisture and a little sauce to go over the top.

This was good.  Although I used pork tenderloin, added some cheddar (which I probably wouldn't do next time)I butterflied the pork, pounded it, and ended up putting one tenderloin on top of the other.  My family loved it.  I also added some apple cider for moisture.  A nice change and I would make this again.

I made this for New Year's dinner but I did it with a roast. I thought it made the meat juicy and tender. I butterflyed the roast then wrapped it up and tied it. I really enjoyed it and so did my family. I will make it again.

I made this for my boyfriend and we both loved it.  Stuffing the chops is a pain, but it turns out great if you just pile the stuffing on top of them.

A wonderful fall treat! If your pork chops aren't thick enough to stuff, it tastes great with all of the stuffing piled on top of the chops! My 6 and 8 year old sons loved it!

I have never made pork chops like this before- my boyfriend and I loved them! I used the granny smith apples for this one, I think they are the tastiest in baked dishes. I e-mailed this recipe to several of my friends. Thanks! -Kerry

Great recipe! I love the combination of pork and apples.  I did cut back on the bread crumbs and used apple juice to moisten basically eye-balling the ingredients to create the stuffing.  I sprayed a baking dish with Pam so nothing would stick. And, since there's nothing worse than dry pork I baked it at 350 covered for 20 minutes and uncovered for another 20 minutes.

We love this recipe and Hubby asked for it again.  The only thing that I do differently, is that I don't stuff the chops.  I put the stuffing on the bottom and the chops on the top.  It works out nicely that way and then my picky children can keep their textures separate.  I double the stuffing part of the recipe to feed a large family.

I took the advice of most others here and did 1 cup of breadcrumbs and cooked the chops about 15 minutes less.  The result : unbelievable!!  Not the easiest dish but real fun to make and so, so amazing to taste!  Thanks for this :)

I made this recently and it had no flavor at all. The fresh bread congealed into a paste. I like the concept but itneeds seasoning and dry bread crumbs and way less of them.

I am not a big meat eater, but I wanted to try something different for a special dinner I was making. This recipe was dry and bland. Did not taste the apples enough and meat seems overcooked at 1hr baking. Would not make again.

I'm not a huge stuffed pork chop fan but this recipe was tasty.  I used stove top stuffing instead of bread but then added apple cider for moisture.  I also baked the pork chops in the cider and all was moist.

I thought the stuffing was really dry, even after adding some water and about half an egg, and the stuffing was a little bland, even after adding a garlic mixture spice. I'm wondering why no one else has has this problem!

I thought this recipe was straight-forward enough. My only complaint is that it did turn out a bit bland.

Semi easy recipe. I wished I had read a review or two prior because I saw a note of adding cranberries- I would have loved that. I decreased the amount of breadcrumbs and added an extra Apple. The recipe calls for two apples, which I worried wouldn’t be enough but yup, 2 are plenty.

Made it, loved it! Had to make it my own, made full recipe for stuffing even tho there's only two of us,used Granny Smith apples, as well as sauté ing onions & celery. After stuffing pork chops & browning, used 8x2 casserole dish. To remaining stuffing, added 1/4 c. Milk , then put it around pork chops. Turned out Awesome!

I think the ratio of apple to bread crumbs was a little off.  I think if I made these again I would make a brine with some apple cider before stuffing and baking them to add a little more flavor.

My husband liked these a lot more than me, but the idea was great.  I might be more creative with the stuffing  next time.  Pork chops did come out juicy and moist.  Good change from the usual. Thanks.

Love it. So easy. I did tweak a bit. Only used 1 cup of bread crumbs and also added cranberries. I also dipped stuffed chops in egg and Panko and pan fried about 2 mins on each side. Put in oven covered with foil 20 minutes and uncovered 20 minutes. Very juicy and cooked perfectly. Will be adding this to the rotation.

Definitely don’t add 3 cups of breadcrumbs! I ended up redoing the first half and using my own cubed bread and it was delicious, just make sure you bake until the bread is crispy.

It was very bland.  The stuffing is missing something.  I had really thick chops.  I cooked them for thirty min covered and twenty uncovered.  Like someone else said, twenty and twenty is probably best.

Just made the stuffing for the pork chops but I did a mini cheat, I bought stovetop,  one box for pork and the other  cornbread  for the flavor but I mixed both stuffings together (1/2 bag of each- only 2 of use - had plenty to stuff and leftovers which I put in an oven safe dish and cooked covered for 20 minutes at 350 ) I did do the recipe as stated but I always put more onion because I love onions. I eliminated the salt because the mixes have enough. The stuffing tastes great. read another's review and took their advice. 20 minutes covered - 20 minutes uncovered. Chops were very moist. THIS ONE IS A KEEPER

I added some fresh Rosemary & Thyme. It turned out great and the meat was very moist. I used "bone in" chops for added flavor, folded them over the stuffing and secured with toothpicks. Enjoy

After reading the other reviews I modified the recipe as well. I did one apple, a handful of stuffing, two stalks of celery diced, and a small onion diced. I also reduced the baking time to 20 minutes covered/20 minutes uncovered. The house smelled amazing the entire time! My son ate two pork chops!

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly, and although we liked it ok, it seemed to lack something. While we were eating, I thought it would be better using packaged stuffing mix and add the sautéed onion & celery, and the diced apples. Well, I've made it at least a dozen times this way, and what a difference! I make Pepperidge Farms herb cubed stuffing per the instructions and add the other things. And no need to transfer to a baking dish if you brown the chops in a cast iron skillet - goes straight into the oven. Huge hit always, and super easy!!!

I have made these twice. This was easier than I thought. The thicker the Pork Chop, the more Apple stuffing you can stuff in them. They came out delicious. The only I did differently the second time was decreased the temp by 15 degrees and 15 min longer baking time.  They were so juicy inside.

I too found it wonderful with the recommended changes.  Also added a clove of garlic to the cornbread stuffing along with half a dozen cranraisins,; stuffed the chops and wrapped bacon around the circumference pinning with a tooth pick.  30 min's covered, 13 mins. uncovered.  Oh, the gravy is ta die for.

Less breadcrumbs for me and only about 40 - 45 minutes. Add a bit of liquid in the roasting pan. Apple juice is yummy. I also like a bit of real maple syrup on mine.

I tried this recipe but without butter and with a few other alterations, but it turned out superbly. This is defiantly worth trying. If you want to see my alterations check it out at www.pantryexperiment.wordpress.com I also did an amazing brown sugar chili rub. You should see it.

This is my second time making this dish and it's delicious and easy. Got a good browned chop with my cast iron skillet, transferred to 9x13 and covered it with foil and transferred to the oven. Used old bread (loaf, hotdog buns) for the crumbs. Removed the pork chops after cooking and added juices and cream to cast iron to deglaze browned bits and make a pan sauce. Economical, too!

I make something very similar but I add crushed fresh garlic to the stuffing and it really enhances the pork and the apples. Also is good if you don't have thick cut chops to put stuffing a baking dish and lay thinner sliced chops on top of stuffing and some chicken broth to keep it moist.

added cranberries and raisins to the mix and used a brandy apple glaze for the surface.  Cooked for 25 min uncovered and 25 min covered. Everyone loved it

I didn't like the apple stuffing at all. Something is missing. I will substitute Hot Italian Sausage instead.

We love this.  Had some thick pork chops and went looking for a way to cook them.  I didn't have any plain bread so used a loaf of Rosemary and olive oil.  Wasn't to sure about using fresh bread crumbs but they are fantastic.  I only had 4 chops so baked the extra dressing with the chops.

As written in the directions, this recipe was NOT good, way too many breadcrumbs & there was a lot left over after stuffing the chops, I also thought the cooking time was too long.

I like this recipe but I didn't make the stuffing,I think it helps to brown the chops before baking them. I have never really been a fan of stuffed pork chops in the past. To make things easy I used Stove Top Savory Herb stuffing and then followed the recipe from where you stuff and brown the chops. I used the convection option on my oven so did 20 minutes with foil and then 30 minutes without the foil. I also put a little bit of butter on top of the chops to keep them from drying out while in the oven, after I browned the chops and put them in the backing dish. The chops come out nice and juicy and very tender. Definitely a keeper if you want to make the stuffing or use something else. NOTE: I also had acorn squash baking in the oven along with the pork chops, I put the baking dishes next to each other on the same oven shelf.
