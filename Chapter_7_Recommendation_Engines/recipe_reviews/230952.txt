I thought they were delicious, and I've never seen anything disappear quicker in my life lol. I made these with "Lorna Doone" cookies as I had no graham crackers and the only other change I made was to put the lemon zest inside the batter.I had them cooling on a platter in my fridge when I ran to the market. Upon my return no more than 15 minutes later my home had been "invaded" by my youngest: 17 y/o daughter and about 1/2 dz of her friends. I had actually made "40 something" mini mini cheesecakes as I had no regular size cupcake cups. When I looked down I could have cried, there were 4 left on the platter UGHHH!!! The only consolation I had was that all I kept hearing was "Mama, these are the bomb". I couldn't possibly be mad? Anyway, I was thinking of adding pumpkin pie spice for Thanksgiving, then my mind started wandering... oreos, nilla wafers, pecan sandies (with a glazed pecan garnish YUM!), the possibilities are endless. I HIGHLY HIGHLY Recommend these they're so easy and so delicious, they will be my new "go to" when I need to bring something to a party. Oh well I guess I'm going back the the market again I need to make more "mini mini" cheesecakes, this time I'm hiding them!.... lol :-)

Have made these several times and they always turn out great.
BTW mzflorida said "the recipe should not have egg whites."
 Nowhere in the recipe do I see egg whites,  just "3 eggs"

I took another reviewers suggestion and added the lemon zest to the batter.  I made them as mini cup cakes.  They came out great.  I brought them to a party and got great reviews from everybody.  Somebody asked me how long I was baking. Since about 3:00PM today :)

These are absolutely delicious, and  easy to make. Everyone was raving about them when I brought them to a party. They make 18 cupcake-sized cheesecakes- a great serving size. I topped some with whipped cream and blueberries, and drizzled others with melted chocolate- but honestly, my favorites were the plain ones!

I made these and they are just mediocre at best.  I think that there is a typo in the recipe.  This batter should not have egg whites.  It makes the cakes too lofty.  That being said, the flavor is good.  Next time I will just do three egg yolks.

This recipe is SO easy to make. I have made it both as written and with 'healthy' modifications and it came out perfect both times! The changes I made cut the calories in half, reduced the fat by 14g PER SERVING and increased the protein by 1g of fat. I had a few friends taste test the mods and they agreed it was out of this world! My husband didn't even realize that they weren't 'real' cheesecake until I told him :-)
The modifications as written are for the recipe cut in HALF (we didn't need 18 for the two of us)
Make the crust as written for 1/2 recipe.
Replace the 1.5 blocks of cream cheese with 1 8oz block of GREEK cream cheese (lower in fat and cal and higher in protein) and 1 5.3oz container of your favorite flavored Greek yogurt (I used Yoplait cinnamon roll, but vanilla would work too). Because of the sweetness of the yogurt and the slight sweetness of the cream cheese, I cut the sugar to 1/4c. I also decreased the egg to 1 egg since the yogurt adds liquid to the mixture. I mixed all ingredients per the recipe, and divided into 10 servings instead of 9, and worked the 'crust' up the sides of the cups a bit. Cooked for 25 min, and while they were cracked when they came out of the oven, they dropped and filled in the cracks as they cooled.
Skipped the frou-frou toppings, you don't need them, and they just add fat and calories.
If you use silicone muffin cups you can pop them right out and put them on a serving tray, perfect finger food! :-)

I was in a hurry and added the heaven cream before I realized it was used after cooking. I went ahead and cooked my creation and they turned out so good. My family loved them even with the goof up.  Cheesecake is my weakness I will surely make these again and again they are super fast and very easy.

I made this for one of our Christmas dinner desserts.  I used homemade strawberry jelly instead of the blueberries.  I put some jelly on top and mixed it in the cheesecakes before baking them, then topped them with some fresh strawberries and blueberries after they were baked. I also used oreo like cookies for the crust.  I made several different desserts and this one went first and got the most raves.  Wonderful recipe, plan on making it often.

No idea why there are so little reviews for this recipe.
Many these mini cheesecakes on two separate occasions. Fed them to my colleagues and friends, THEY LOVED IT!
For me, I preferred to add less melted butter to the oreo bits. Personally felt that it was too oily

I have made these quite a few times. They have always turned out great. I have used diced apple pie filling and made my own blueberry filling to top these. I have also used the Keebler mini graham cracker pie crusts in a pinch.

Not my favorite but definitely delicious! Found this recipe on the back of a cream cheese wrapper and everyone loved them! Although the middles were sunken I fixed it with a little whipped cream

I made these and then had a cheesecake bar - where everyone got to add their own toppings - blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, melted milk chocolate, caramel and whipped cream. This was a huge hit and easiest dessert ever!!

Soooo easy to put together and sooo good - a classic cheescake that was a big hit with my guests. I made it in a springform pan and used frozen strawberries plus 1/3 cup sugar cooked in a small pot till the sugar just melted. I got 12 small pieces and lots of compliments.

I omitted the whipping cream, used canned blueberry filling and added lemon zest to the cheesecake itself. They were amazing! I worried the paper liners would stick, but no problems and I used a small glass that fit my muffin tins to pack and level the crust layer.  Perfect - I’ll be making them for birthdays again this week!

These are mini cheese-cupcakes that are delicious! I just substituted the graham crackers for Digestive biscuits and the results were absolutely amazing! Topped with freshly whipped cream, a slice of strawberry, and some blueberries, these are fantastic for parties, dinners, or lunches.

its hard to tell when the cheesecake is done. i cooked it until the middle seemed firm but you could take that the eggs were cooked. i made a second batch after and took them out a little bit before and they were under cooked.

These are fantastic! With this recipe I made 48 mini cupcakes and 6 full size cupcakes! I baked the minis for 18 minutes and they were perfect .

Made recipe as written.  No changes.  They were awesome.  Dense, rich, and flavorful just like a whole cheesecake.  Love the fact that they are portion controlled.

I just made these today, and they turned out great. I topped them with a whipped cream topping I made from another recipe I found on here, and strawberries instead of blueberries. We love them.

I made these for Thanksgiving this year.  I should have added the lemon zest to the batter to give this cheesecake more oomf!  However, everyone else loved them as they were.  They were super easy to make and using regular size baking cups made them the perfect serving size.  I would make them again.
