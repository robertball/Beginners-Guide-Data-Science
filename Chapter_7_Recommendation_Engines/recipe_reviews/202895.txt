I made this today and it's really good.  I only changed a few things (some to make it healthier and some that probably took that away).  I added 1/2 tsp of oil and swapped to olive oil (omega 9 - much healthier) because I freeze sometimes and lower oil gets dry.  I also used half the sugar and used brown as there are a few more nutrients there and subbed out the rest with a tsp of stevia extract.  Finally I added 1/4 cup pecans and 1/4 cup chocolate chips into the bread and on top of the loaf I sprinkled 2 tablespoons white sugar (only use of it) and sprinkled a few chocolate chips (not many) for appearance sake mostly.    It turned out wonderfully and will present in a way that my church people (that are not healthy eaters) will like it.  (I've discovered if you want them to eat healthy, put all the sugar on the outside!).  The only thing I will do differently next time is add maybe a little more banana (I used frozen and it was in chunks so I don't think I got the full "three" it called for) and possibly a tablespoon of applesauce to keep it moist but it was so good that my daughter kept saying, "Are you sure it's healthy?".  I may also lose the nutmeg next time but I'm thrilled with the antioxident power of this bread...all that dark chocolate with little fat and sugar - wow!  Thanks for this recipe and I'm so glad you posted it.  No one will know this is a healthy bread.

This bread is really good. Here are some changes that I made to make it even better: Reduced the cocoa powder to 1/4 C., increased the oil to 1/4 C. (to make it more moist,) added 1/2 C. semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/4 C. of applesauce, and omitted the cinnamon and nutmeg (I felt like two flavors were already plenty.) I quadrupled the recipe and made fifteen mini loaves for gifts. I had my kids try one and they loved it. It was moist, delicious, and not overly sweet, with the added benefit of whole wheat. I bake A LOT, and I'll definitely make this one again! (Note: the above changes I included are for the original, one-loaf recipe.)

I would have liked to give this recipe more stars.  The texture was nice, and the loaf turned out very moist (I had small bananas, so I used four instead of three).  The whole wheat flour works very well in this recipe.  It just seemed that the chocolate and banana were competing with each other instead of complimenting each other.  I think I would prefer to make regular banana bread and add chocolate chunks to it, rather than adding cocoa powder.

I made this while waiting for my bread dough to rise. Didn't want to waste that oven heat! I did mush one and a half bananas and cut up the other one and a half. I had a bag of chocolate chips I needed to use, so I just threw them in. I had to cover it halfway through with foil so it wouldn't burn. Came out perfectly. EDITED REVIEW: I made these again last night and cut back the flour to 1 1/2 cups and found even cutting back the flour, there wasn't near enough liquid for the muffins. Maybe because my bananas were smaller? I added 1/4 cup greek yogurt and it came out perfectly. Very moist. I got 12 muffins out of one recipe and only four remain this morning!

I just made this bread and my 8 year old daughter and I can't stop eating it.  I only changed up the spices a bit.  I like cloves but less nutmeg, so I put in 1-1/4 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I made it in a bundt pan and baked for 30 minutes and it was perfect!  Thank you!  What a treat!

This is an excellent dessert bread!  I followed the recipe exactly and loved it!  The loaf was dense, moist, and simply scrumptious.  The chocolate and banana were delicious together and you couldn't even taste the whole wheat.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe yielded twelve beautifully high domed, flavorful and moist muffins for me. One thing I did differently than the recipe instructs was to use real buttermilk (1%) rather than the written substitution. I believe there is nothing like the real thing when it comes to buttermilk. It makes a real difference. I would not change another thing though. Each flavor was distinct and all worked  well together. Thank you for sharing a delicious, healthy and unique twist on a traditional favorite.

Fantastic! I made these as muffins (and it made 16 regular-size). I found the banana and chocolate complimented each other very well and didn't have a problem with competing flavors as some reviewers noted. I did reduce the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp, but that was my only alteration. Decadent enough for dessert; healthy enough for breakfast... gotta love that!

This is a keeper since I am always looking for new ways to use up ripe bananas.  They were perfect just the way the recipe is, I wouldn't change a thing. Only difference was that I made 12 muffins instead of the 16 that it says.  They were done in 25 minutes and were just right.

I just made this and my 3 year old are eating a muffin. Muffins were completely done after 25 minutes. I would have given it a three because while they are pretty good, I am not crazy about them. However, my three year old just piped up to say, "I like these black muffins." So, he bumped it up a star. lol I would try it again and maybe add a little less nutmeg.

I thought these muffins were delicious.  I didn't curdle the milk but used whole milk instead.  I also did not use nutmeg or cinnamon but added mini-chocolate chips.  I made 12 large muffins and just ate one out of the oven - will definitely make again.

It turned out very moist but I think 1/2 cup cocoa powder is to much. I could hardly taste the banana, and I used 4 bananas. I do like this recipe and will make it again but with half the cocoa powder.

Very good recipe. I used a bundt pan instead of bread pan and it looks great. I added a half cup of chocolate chips and a half cup of walnuts as well. Easy to make and very easy to eat.

This didn't turn out very well for me. I don't think the cocoa powder goes well with the bananas and/or the whole wheat flour. Next time, I'd just put chocolate chips in it, but I wasn't thrilled with this recipe.

I really liked this recipe! The only thing I changed was the amount of nutmeg, cause I don't like that strong flavor that much. But this cake is really tasty. Will try it again. :)

I can't believe how good these are....usually when I bake with whole wheat flour everything turns out dense and tough.   I didn't add the spices (cinnamon & nutmeg) and the muffins were delicious.    The recipe made 17 muffins.....baked for 25 minutes.   Good recipe.

You certainly could tell these were healthy/whole wheat but they were also moist, delicious, and filling. I followed Meghan's suggestion of adding a bit more oil (and using olive oil) since I was planning to freeze. I also added some chocolate chips and walnuts. Great for a healthier lunch box treat.

Followed this recipe only skipped the cinnamon/nutmeg and substituted buttermilk for milk/lemnon juice and olive oil for canola. Added chopped walnuts and chocolate chips. Came out very nice well. This will be a keeper. When I see 3 blackening bananas, I know what to do :)

Made this for hubby.  Added 1/8 C more oil, additional banana, and 1/2 C chocolate chips. We all thought the taste was great and he really liked it, but it was still very dry, even with oil and banana addition and only baking for 45 minutes. I will make it again for him. Thanks for sharing.

It was bad! It had no taste, all we tasted was the chocolate. It also was dry. Was really looking forward to this, followed the diections can't figure out what went wrong. Think I will stick to my regular banana bread.

I like the idea of chocolate in this recipe, but the nutmeg was overpowering. I think I'll try it again without the nutmeg.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very good.  I think this will be a great chocolate bread /muffin base recipe, just omit the bananas and substitute other things: nuts, chocolate chips, peanut butter, other fruits, etc.  The possibilities or endless.  I think I'll try it with chocolate chips next time.  I'll probably use less nutmeg next time or maybe even leave it out, but that's just a personal preference because I'm not a big fan of nutmeg.

Umm delicious!! This is exactly what I wanted, healthy and still good tasting.  I love baked breads and baked goods, but don't think they always have to be so high in oil and fat and calories.  So I was very excited when I found this recipe, and even more excited when it tasted great.  I love substituting wheat flour instead, you can barely taste a difference and you get about 2.5 grams of fiber in each slice this way (I calculated it like a dork), and adding the unsweetened cocoa to make it chocolately.  I also add 1 cup of chocolate chips, always, to my banana bread, and this was no exception.  And if you want to add maybe 1 more Tablespoon of oil that still wouldn't be too bad healthwise, but it is just fine the way it is!

Also, I split into two slightly smaller loaf pans, I dont have a 9x5, and it was completely done at 40 minutes in the oven.

So delicious. I made 1 dozen muffins instead of a loaf, and baked for 25 minutes. 20-25 minutes is all the muffins need according to my oven. I followed the recipe exactly, except used two medium and two small bananas. I will probably add one more banana next time, great way to add a little more moisture for freezing.

I made as written. This came out looking great, great consistency - but all I can taste is NUTMEG! It seemed like alot but I like to make the recipe as written the first time. It's a disappointment - I can't taste the banana, chocolate or cinnamon...and my nutmeg certainly wasn't fresh :(  I will make again though without the nutmeg and see what happens.

Wow- this is GREAT bread! I subbed a couple ingredients because i didnt have any lemon juice. I subbed 4oz nonfat vanilla yogurt for the skim milk/ lemon mixture and added about 2 tablespoons of skim milk because the batter was a bit thick. I also decreased the sugar to 2/3 cup, used brown sugar, I only had 1/3 cup cocoa powder, and I tossed in another banana. YUMMY!!! I can hardly wait until i make these with the full amount of cocoa and I will also use this recipe in the summer for zucchini bread. GREAT recipe- thanks for sharing. Oh yeah, I made 12 muffins and they baked for about 18 minutes. I did the calorie count on my recipe and 1 of the muffins came out to be 176 calories!!

Overall I liked this recipe. Personally, I'll reduce the nutmeg next time. Also, watch the baking time. I'll shave about 15 minutes off next time. It turned out a little dry.

I really wanted to like this.  It has so many ingredients that I like - chocolate, cinnamon, nutmeg.  But, they just didn't work well together in this recipe.  The muffins were on the dry side, and I even misread the recipe and ended up adding 2 tbs of oil, instead of just the 1 that it called for.  I tried to make these better by adding peanut butter glaze to the top, but it didn't help enough.  Unfortunately, none of my kids were fans of these either, and most ended up not being eaten.

We made these as muffins and I have to agree, the flavours competed.  The muffins were also dry, even though we also added chocolate chips. On the up side, the whole wheat taste was well masked.  Thanks for the recipe. :)

Amazing bread!  When I tasted the batter, I was dubious about it tasting good, but when it came out of the oven, it smelled so good and tasted even better!  The only differences I made was to use 4 T of mayonnaise instead of the eggs and used all purpose flour instead.  The top came out somewhat burnt in about 50 minutes in the oven, but that could just be my oven, so I will bake it at 350 degrees next time instead.  Great recipe!

This was pretty good for something different. My fiance's first reaction was that it was too "chocolately", but we both devoured it. The cocoa powder does a good job at masking the whole wheat flavor. **I made this again to get rid of some turning bananas. I chose this recipe because it doesn't use butter. I left out the cocoa powder and used white flour and it made a wonderfully moist bread. This is a keeper!

Wow! This turned out great. To make it extra healthy, I used splenda instead of regular sugar, and it tasted great.

This recipe was OK for me--not the greatest muffins I've ever had but for a low-fat recipe that also uses whole wheat flour, pretty good.  I did the muffins and followed the recipe exactly.  If you do muffins, check after 20 min.  Mine were done by then and would have been burned at 30 min.  I think if I make again I'd add chocolate chips as well.  Although that would obviously make them not so "low fat." :)

I cut the sugar to 1/4, use only egg whites, use 50/50 whole wheat to white flower and took out the unsweetened chocolate and put chips in instead.

Made this last night and there is only one piece left. This is the best chocolate banana bread I've made. Will be making this again and again and again.

Really good ---  I added a small pkg. of chopped walnuts and made 48 mini muffins.  I reduced cooking temp to 350 and baked about 18 min.  Mostly tasted chocolate - didn't really tast banana, nutmeg or cinnamon.

I changed up a few things. I used Splenda sugar and did not add any of the spices, I don't really care for them with chocolate. I also had low fat buttermilk, so I used that instead of milk with lemon. And put in a half cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips! Came out perfect! A keeper recipe for me. Thank you for sharing! :)

This is great bread!  I subbed honey for the sugar and left out the nutmeg and cinnamon (they sound like weird combos with banana and chocolate!).  I only baked a loaf for 45 minutes and it was perfect.  Husband and 3 kids absolutely devoured it!  My 5 year old was thrilled that he got "chocolate bread" for breakfast!

I made 16 muffines and baked them for just 25 minutes . I did`t wanna wait 30 minutes for the milk and the lemon juice , so I just used 1/2 cup of vanila yougrt instead of the milk and the the lemon juice. the texture is very moist and U don`t taste any whole wheat in it , but the problem is (as another reviewer mentioned)I was expecting a strong flavor from the banana like the classic banana muffine , but it seemes that the cocoa has the overwhelming flavor so be sure to use a very ripe banana, I did`t even taste the cinnamon. any way the recipe is only good when I`m bored of the classic banana muffines.

I wasn't sure what to expect with this, but it had a good flavor. I would say, though, to check it before one hour is up. My loaf was very dry, and I am not sure if it was from over-baking or from the recipe. I will try this again since my kids will eat just about anything chocolate, but I will check it after 50 minutes.

Was dry, maybe 30 minutes for 12 muffins was baked too long. Or maybe needs more oil. Whole wheat does come out dry and dense sometimes.

These muffins are good, and not so sweet as many recipes turn out. Good with a cup of coffee! Nice and moist. I made them with white flour but stuck to the recipe aside from that.

I wanted a healthier treat for my kids that was still chocolate.  That was achieved, but it was very dry and maybe a little too "unsweet" to pass off as a sweet treat for them.

The taste gets five stars.  But, they are rock hard on the outside!  Very soft on the inside.  So either cut the baking down to 50 minutes and/or increase the amount of oil.  Maybe I over mixed them?  I followed the directions . . .  But I really like the flavor so I'm going to give this another go.

I used chocolate chips as someone below suggested (skimping slightly on the cocoa) and added about 1/4 cup of walnuts.  My whole family and different holiday visitors agreed that it was very enjoyable, whether it be for late breakfast or a snack with coffee.

Just not a fan.  I love banana bread, spiced breads, and chocolate.  But this combo of banana, chocolate, and spices, just did NOT work for me.  Rather than combining things I love, it was none of the things I loved when combined.  Didn't taste, chocolate-y, banan-y, or spicy.  Just an odd combo.  I gave this two stars only because I liked the texture of the bread, and might use it as the basis for something else.  Please note, I followed the recipe to a T.

The chocolate mixed in with the banana takes away from the banana taste and therefore didn't taste anything like Banana bread.  It wasn't very tasty and quite bland

The moisture level of this bread was excellent, but i agree with an earlier review...I felt like the banana and chocolate were competing and I didn't like the combination...I think I'll just make regular banana bread in the future.

Loved this recipe - my husband, who is not a big sweets eater, raved about it.  I love that the cocoa masks the wheat flavor so my two little ones think they are eating "chocolate bread".  My mods: used 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour, decreased nutmeg to 3/4 t and used rice milk so my milk allergic son could eat it.  Also, it only took the loaf about 45 minutes to bake.  I will absolutely make this again!
