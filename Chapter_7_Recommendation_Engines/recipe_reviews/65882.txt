I didn't have dried cherries, so I left them out...my daughter said this was the BEST ham she had ever tasted! 
p.s. (Use tin foil to line the pan...if the glaze burns, it is very difficult to remove!)

This recipe is Gr8.  I didn't have and couldn't find dried cherrys so I used sliced up marichino cherries.  All my guests raved about the sauce and the flavour of the ham.  I used the suggestion of covering the bottom of the pan with tinfoil to make clean up easier and would advise doing that.

I made this for Christmas Dinner, and it was an ABSOLUTE HIT!  Everyone loved it.  I bought a sprial cut ham, and spooned the glaze in between the slices of the ham... IT was fabulous!  Double the recipe for a large ham if you're going to put it in the slices.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

My whole family agrees - this is the best ham we have ever had. The glaze is amazing! I used extra of both jams. I have made this for several dinner parties and it's always a huge hit!

Used sliced ham so I grilled it and simmered sauce until warm then drizzled over ham. It was great, my boyfriend and I loved it!! Will definitely try it as glaze when cooking for more people.

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner this year, and it was great!  I only put in half of the horseradish for those that don't like it too spicy, and everyone loved it.  I can't wait to make it again.  I also doubled the recipe and people were slathering it on their ham slices!!
