Even easier fool proof method. Cook rice as directed until you get to the simmer on low part. Instead place pot of rice in an oven which has been pre-heated to 300 and turned off. Let the rice sit in the oven, covered, for half an hour while you prepare the rest of your meal. Fluffy perfect rice every time even if you have a gas stove which loves to burn the rice on the bottom of the pan. I can't get my flame down low enough to make a god pot of rice without some burning on the bottom.
