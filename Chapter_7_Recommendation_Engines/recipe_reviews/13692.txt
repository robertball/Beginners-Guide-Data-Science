This is my favorite cranberry sauce recipe. I like the simple, all-natural appeal. I double the recipe (as the frozen apple juice concentrate I use comes in a 12 oz. container), then add 1/2 to 1 cup of honey for extra sweetness. I also like to put in a Tbs or so of cinnamon for a richer flavor. You can even mix the taste and texture up by throwing in some sliced and peeled Macintosh apples (either cube before cooking or mash after cooking).

Good but still a little tart, try adding between 1/4 and 1/2 cup sugar.  Still quite a lot less than most other cranberry sauce recipes and helps just a little in the tartness area.

Although I wanted something low sugar and simple - I probably won't make it again.

I made this for Thanksgiving Dinner and it was a hit. I should have doubled the recipe because I had nothing leftover. I have a large family but all very picky and have been trying for years to find a cranberry sauce that would please them all and this is it. It will be a family recipe from now on.

Easy to make. A little tart. This is the same recipe as Cranberry Apple Sauce I.

woa nellie! for consistancy, this turned out well...but was VERY tart..could barely eat it...had to sprinkle sweetner on it to make it palletable...I will try this again..might try adding a low cal sweetner, such as stevia..could also benefit from some spice...cinn, nutmeg or apple pie spice would be lovely...overall..i had no idea how to make cranberry sauce, esp low sugar, and this gave me a great place to start...i will keep working with this one...
