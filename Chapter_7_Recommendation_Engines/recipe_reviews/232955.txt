I was looking for a good ham soup to use a ham bone.  This turned out to be great.  I cooked just the ham bone with onion and celery for the first hour or so and then later added the other ingredients so they didn't boil as long.  My family likes their vegetables still on the "al dente" side.  Good recipe!

We really liked this stew. I did simmered the ham bone with the onion and celery for the first three hours then added the ham, potatoes and carrots and cooked that for another hour. I added frozen peas, I'm not fond of canned peas, for the last 10 minutes. The coconut milk I tempered and added at the end. I served this the day after making it as I wanted to skim the fat off the top. I don't make a lot of recipes more than once but I will make this one again. Thanks for sharing.
