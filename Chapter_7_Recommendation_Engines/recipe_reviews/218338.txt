Overall, a nice side dish and the vinaigrette is very good. I chose to steam my green beans vs. roasting which I'm sure made a differnce.  I like to see a nice lively green color on my beans with a snap to them vs. a dark color and basically over cooked...

Everyone in my family did like these and thought they would appreciate them again... but... not my favorite for sure. Might have something to do with me not really liking Green Beans. I thought the texture from roasting them was off and if I must have green beans I prefer them with a lot of crunch. These seems more tough then crunchy to me.... but again like I said, my wife daughter and son in law said they really liked them. The dill Vinaigrette was good, and I might try that again on fresh quick blanched beans just for kicks.

Delicious! I added freshly grated parmesan cheese at the end. I also used honey dijon mustard instead.

In my opinion, the roasted green beans were good. However, when I added the vinegarette, it was gross! I put parmesan on them and it was even nastier. My husband, on the other hand, said that he loved the greenbean dish. He did not like the added Parmesan tho.

Loved this recipe - the beans were tender crisp, and the vinaigrette a nice, light touch. I dusted them with a little granulated garlic when I tossed the beans with the oil & salt before roasting.  Will definitely make again!

My husband made these for me for Valentine's Day with herb crusted salmon and mashed sweet potatoes. So yum! They taste decadent because they're creamy -- but it's deceiving because it's the mustard that makes them creamy! Love love love!

*I followed the recipe exactly* I thought this recipe was ok. The beans were edible but there was something about it that was a little weird. It is unlikely that I will ever make this recipe again.
