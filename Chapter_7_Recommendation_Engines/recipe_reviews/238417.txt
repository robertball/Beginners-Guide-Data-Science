This tasted fine. It was definitely not a clone of Nutella. I made 1/2 recipe in my Vitamix blender. The color is much darker than the picture and it does still have almond bits. Without vegetable shortening or similar products I do not think it will get beautifully smooth like the picture. It reminds me much more of a vegan chocolate fudge, in taste and texture, and it is definitely a healthy tasting spread.

It's quite tasty. Darker that Nutella. I found it was thicker and courser. Wouldn't say spreadable. I used fresh Hazelnuts from Gellatly Nut Farm / Park.  I used hard honey rather than liquid honey.  I will try grinding the toasted hazlenuts first next time before adding rest of ingredients. Might try unsalted melted butter next time instead of oil. Worth making again. Flavourful
