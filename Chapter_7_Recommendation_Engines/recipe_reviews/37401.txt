I used this recipe for the topping, and Mom’s Apple Pie I recipe for the filling. The pie was absolutely wonderful. That’s saying a lot since I grew up on an orchard in a town known for it’s fantastic apple pies. If using a firm tart apple such as Granny Smith, slice apples thinly (approx 1/4”). This will facilitate a good texture without overcooking the pie. I used a regular 9” pie plate (Corning is my favorite), and used 6 medium to large Granny Smiths. Apples cook down; I was taught to pile them into the pie plate and pack ‘em in (before baking, my packed mound of apples rose above the edge of the plate approx. 3 – 4 inches). After heaping the apple mixture into the crust and dotting it with butter, I covered the pie with aluminum foil and placed it into a preheated 450-degree oven. After baking for 10 minutes I reduced the heat to 350 and baked for another 30 minutes while making the streusel topping. I then removed and uncovered the pie, patted the topping over my mound of apples, covered the edge of the pie with a strip of foil to prevent overcooking the crust, and returned it to the oven for another 30 minutes at 350. I had excellent results by following both the filling and topping recipes; I didn’t have whiskey so I used good scotch. I’ll never use vanilla in an apple pie again! As the pie cools the height will go down further and it will solidify.

This was very good.  I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of allspice to the apples.  It just gives it a bit more flavor.

The flavors of this pie were great.  My only negative comment would be that the bottom crust turned to complete mush. It made it very difficult to scoop a piece of pie out from the dish. I used Granny Smith which are supposed to be the best for baking. Anybody have any suggestions?

The pie really bakes down. You need to cut the apples quite thick!!I think it would be better with white sugar in the pie.

Tried this recipe for my first attempt at apple pie. It was amazing! It was such an easy recipe. Of course I doubled the cinnamon and vanilla, as I do in all my recipes. I used 6 medium green apples as a guesstimate for the 1.5 lbs the recipe calls for. The pie had amazing sweet-n-tart aspect due to the green apples. Will try again using different types of apples to see how the pie comes out. Will keep this recipe for years to come.

The whole family gave this pie a 5 star rating! I made one with my teenage son, and then he made another by himself. He was very happy with the results.

This pie was excellent. I added chopped cranberries to the streusal topping for an added effect. I also followed others and added lemon juice and flour to the filling.

My family LOVED this.  But sine I used frozen pie shells, I divided the ingredients between to shells and doubled the topping amounts so there would be enough for 2 pies.

My husband and I made this (our very first pie, ever) last weekend.  We LOVED it!  We bought a graham cracker crust and used several different types of apples.  Was incredibly delicious and very easy to make.  My favorite part is the strusel topping!

This is a great recipe and it's very easy to make. I did do one change though, I melted the butter before adding it to the brown sugar topping mixture and then just blended with my hands. I find it a bit easier that way but I'm sure the other method is just as fine. Make this one when you want a sweet treat!

This was my first attempt at apple pie.It was easy and recieved many compliments at Thanksgiving dinner, but I thought it could have used "something" caramel would have been a nice addition maybe? My husband and I agreed it was  actually better..quite amazing as leftovers!Maybe we ate too much at Thanksgiving to truly enjoy it. I will probably try again with some sort of caramel sauce.
