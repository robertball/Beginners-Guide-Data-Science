We really enjoyed this. I only made one substitution, per the suggestion of another reviewer, I used apple butter instead of chutney (I didn't have a chutney).  I also grilled some chicken breast which my husband added to his.  Lastly, I would recommend using about 1/2 the dressing to toss with the spinach to coat then add the other ingredients and drizzle with the remaing dressing.  Otherwise, alot would end up at the bottom of the bowl.

Fantastic! I made this recipe exactly as written, using Granny Smith apples and Major Grey's Mango Chutney. Perfect combo of sweet, sour and spice in the flavors, and tender, chewy, crisp and crunchy in texture. Nicely done. Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful salad. Chutney to Indians like me can be of a 100 types. I assumed tamarind chutney here and made it instantly with tamarind concentrate, water, cumin powder and paprika. Wouldn't change anything else in the recipe. Just loved the salad. I would like to call it "chaat salad" cause it tasted like Indian chaat, only healthier;) Thanks for the recipe.

The dressing is absolutely phenomenal!! Next time I might try mixing up the add-ins with cranberries or manadarin orange segments, but I will keep a jar of the dressing in my fridge forever! Thanks!

Wow! This sounded so good I had to try it.  I had a bag of spinach and was wondering what to do with it. I didn't have any "chutney". but I added walnuts, yellow raisins & cranberries. The dressing is very tasty and so quick and easy to make.  To my testing bowl I added feta cheese,which only made it better if that is possible. I'm making this for dinner tonight to go alone  with Apple Stuffed Chicken Breast also from this site.  Gee, I sure hope there is some salad left when it is dinner time! :)

I stumbled upon this recipe whilst looking for a different take on a strawberry spinach salad.  So this review is based on the dressing only, but let me say it was so fantastic I had to comment.  The dressing really bumped up my plain old strawberry spinach and inspired me to add raisins, avocado, figs and chopped peanuts to the mix.  I can't wait to make this as written with the apples.  As soon as I can get to the store for apples, you can bet I'm making this again properly.  I checked and I have another big jar of chutney in the pantry.  Thank you so very much for the post, Ali Lowell, this dressing was superb!

OMG where have you been all my life!!! I only had a few choice ingredients in my fridge. The salad had almost all of them. I am a cooking idiot but I love to eat. I didn't have cidar vinegar but I had apple cidar. I also did not have rasions. I subed curry paste for powder. What a great tasting salad!!

This is super yummy!  And so quick!  We doubled the apples, and used cranberries for a fresh, tangy taste.  Goes great with a fresh loaf of bread!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used a spinach/romaine mix and craisins instead of raisins.  I wasn't sure about the curry, but the flavor of the dressing paired really well with the sweetness of the apples and nuttiness of the peanuts.

Hi, great recipe!  back in the early 90's, I worked at a eatery in NW Portland Oregon, we served this salad, I do not remember them adding apples, though we did add thin sliced red onion to the recipee,  I had forgotten of salad, until I went to look for it in my recipes, and had to go online to find it! so pleased it is here, as I recall, we kept the dressing made ahead, and it only took the cook a moment to assemble it. served it with real tasty french bread and butter for a nice classy lunch.

Thanks!

I made this for my book club, and the ladies completely polished it off.  I'd never seen a salad get eaten so quickly in my life.  I used golden raisins, and the chutney I found was an Indian-style mango chutney which went great with the curry and cider vinegar.  This is a fantastic salad, and I'll be making it again.

The dressing was especially delicious. The curry powder and chutney gave it a distinctive flavor. Will definitely use this one again.

5 stars all the way!!! So easy and so delicious!!! Exactly what I was looking for!! I brought it to a BBQ and everyone there raved about it, even my husband who hates curry! As suggested, I substituted cranberries for raisins and apple butter for chutney. This is my new favorite salad!!

This was a very tasty salad! You don't feel like you're "just eating a salad" and need more to go with it, especially if you add some grilled chicken.  FYI - Pureed spinach, apple and chicken makes a great baby food. My daughter gobbled it up! Who would have thought...

This got great reviews at a diner party last night. I didnt chop the apple or dress it until the last minute. This salad dressing has a strong curry flavor/smell which we all love but if you are feeding curry haters it will not appeal to them. Thanks for the recipe!

Wanted to use up ingredients on hand, so I made this with spinach, cashews, red grapes, cantaloupe chunks.  We also added a little bit of chicken breast.  It was excellent!  The dressing was especially good.

Simply put, "Phenominal"   I twisted the recipe to meet my needs: Add goat cheese,add mushrooms and diced onion. Added pecans and dried cranberries (Instead of peanuts and rasins) Venison Backstrap encrusted, grilled medium, sliced thin added to the top of each salad.  This salad is delicious!  I will serve this for our next gourmet dinner party.

This recipe is great! I had just made lasagna and wanted something different and simple as a side.  I saw this and reduced for two - my husband and I.  It was quick, easy and simple.  I actually had all the ingredients in my kitchen.  One change I made was I added almonds in one half as my husband loves peanuts and I love almonds.

I loved the flavor!  I love spinach as a salad base, but I don't like the often sweet dressings served atop.  This is a perfect complement!  Next time, I may let the apples, peanuts & raisins marinade in the dressing overnight, so the flavor is stronger.

This was a very nice change for a salad.  It was simple enough and we enjoyed the blend of flavors! I'm not a curry fan but since it was a small amount I decided to try it.  Glad I did.

Made this for family bithday party yesterday. I could not find chutney and used the apple butter as suggested.Everything else was the same.It was gone as soon as I opened the bowl and everybody raved about it.Will defintely make again and maybe will put some feta cheese and as my husband suggested some fresh grapes also.I did double the dressing just in case but the original portion was enough I think. Thank you for the recipe!

This was a delightful salad! The flavor fusion of the apples, peanuts, and curry in the dressing was perfect. I followed this recipe to the "T" the first time. The second time, I experimented, and added some strawberries, cheese cubes, and dried cranberries. It's great either way no matter what you add. Follow the dressing recipe closely--it's a wonderful flavor. I usually end up making double or triple amount of the dressing. Thanks for posting this recipe!

I really liked this recipe, but my husband thought it was okay.  The dressing is excellent and will be made often.  Great flavor combinations.

Fantastic!  I didn't have any chutney but the dressing was a showstopper nonetheless.  Took it to my inlaws and they all raved and wanted the recipe.

Just want to rave about this recipe. 5 stars!! Delicious, healthy, crispy-crunchy and pretty to look at. My husband and I love curry, but I also like to try new things, plus we are in FL so salads are a natural choice. This recipe seems very forgiving if you need to substitute anything. For example, I used crumbled pecans as I was out of peanuts. I also added some chopped baby carrots along with the chopped apple. I did not have chutney, but I used Patak's hot mango relish along with half a fresh mango, mashed. Because of the fresh mango, I did not add the white sugar as it was sweet enough. Finally, I tossed all the ingredients except the spinach, then ladled the toppings & dressing mixture over a bed of spinach on each plate. It looked absolutely beautiful. Thank you so much for sharing! A keeper.

Loved it!  I didn't measure any of the salad ingredients since I was just making for one...just threw handfuls on the spinach.  For the dressing, I did substitute apple butter as suggested because I don't have any chutney.  I also only used 1/2 T of sugar and thought it was plenty sweet enough.  Next time I will definitely try dried cranberries and feta!

Really good.  The dressing makes this salad.  The kids thought it was too sweet though.

I didn't have chutney but this dressing was still delish! Not too oily or acidic and the curry powder adds fantastic flavor. I put in a little bit of marmalade in place of the chutney but thought it would have been fine, if not better, without it. Will have to try it with chutney soon!

This salad is delicious!!  I didn;t have peanuts so I used pine nuts, they work just as well.  I also added grapes, mini oranges, and apple butter jelly instead of the chutney.  I will be serving this salad for many years to come!

This is one of the best salads I've ever had.  I've made the dressing with and without the chutney, and getting some chutney is definitely worth it (although it isn't bad without it either).  I use Stonewall Kitchen Old Farmhouse Chutney since I haven't been ambitious enough to make homemade chutney yet.  I've also added leftover chicken to make it more of an entree salad, which is also really good.

One of my new favorites, a light tangy dressing that you can mix and match with a lot of different combinations: Mandarin Oranges, Strawberries, Sliced Almonds and any kind of  apples will do (to prepare ahead you can always sprinkle the apples with lemon juice and they won't brown). Today I'll try fresh peaches. Recently I brought it to a family reunion hosted by my Uncle and my mom turns to me and says . . you have to try this spinach one!
