Absolutely delicious. I made two minor substitutions: instead of onion powder I used a 1/2 of a large white onion, tripled the fresh garlic instead of the powder one and didn't use the corn starch.  Thank you it was awesome!

This was quite delicious. I didn't use the corn starch and found that the consistency was thick enough anyway. It really is simple, easy and tasty. Thank you for the recipe.

I used fresh chopped onion and 3 large cloves of garlic instead of the powder in the recipe. 1/2 teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of finely ground pepper. 

Delicious.

Good soup!  My wife absolutely loved it. She's a potato lover so instead of pureeing the soup with a hand blender I cut the potatoes into rustic bite sized chunks.  Added to the texture of the soup and gave it heartier look.

I made this soup, and omitted the half n half, to save on calories.  I used 2 leeks, 6 yukon gold potatoes (unpeeled).  I did not add the cornstarch either.  Once the potatoes were cooked, I used a hand immersion blender to make it smooth.  Yum.

So great! I dont eat dairy, so I switched the butter to a plant oil base one, and the half and half to coconut cream. Made it super creamy! I might add more leek next time...

Very easy to make. I doubled the leeks and used heavy cream. This is a delightful winter soup to be enjoyed with a side of crusty bread.  I will be sending some to the nurses working with my wife as a quick break in their busy day.  :}

This soup is delish as-is, but it does come out on the thicker side. You could probably get away with omitting the corn starch. I'm going to make it a second time, but I'm adding half a yellow onion and will probably omit the corn starch.
I may also add the half-and-half during the last 5 minutes of simmering before blending the soup.

I didn’t use cream and I think that affected the flavor. I didn’t taste the leeks enough and it needed more garlic flavor.

Came out great, I made the same substitution as another reviewer. Doubled the garlic and added 1/2 a diced onion. I also omitted the cornstarch.

This soup came out very well. There is a rich potato taste and a hint of the leek.  I varied the recipe by using 3 lbs of potatoes to 1 1/2 lb leek.  32 oz broth, 16 oz cream, spices as in the recipe.  I also made my own broth,  I buy leg qtrs when on sale, usually .29 per lb. Then boil up 3 of them with carrots and celery, I get broth and chicken meat as a result. The meat I use for salads, mexican dishes etc.

Very good soup!I made only a few insignificant changes. I used 2 T. of minced garlic added to leeks, etc,. then added minimal powdered garlic later. My picky daughter even liked it. I will make this again!

I used some of the advice from others, used real onion, more garlic and I used some of the dark green part of the leeks too.  I also add a bit of Onion Plus seasoning. Great flavor and makes a lot.  Will keep this recipe!

This is very similar to my favorite Clam Chowder Recipe.  Next time I will follow my Clam Chowder base, omit the clams, and just use more potatoes.  This was good, but my Clam Chowder is much more flavorful.

Simply delicious! I used an onion chopped fine, and a stalk of celery diced, and added to the leeks and saute'ed in the butter. I used 1 & 1/2 cartons of Chicken broth to cook the potatoes. When they were soft, I gently mashed then with a hand masher, leaving some chunks. I then added 2 cups of half & half and a bit of vegeta seasoning (about 1 tbsp) and 1 cup of cheddar cheese. Before serving, I sprinkled with diced crispy bacon. My family said it was the best soup ever!

My daughter loved this!!  I made a few substitutions...  2/3 cup of cream (18%) and 6 cups of chicken broth.   I left of the cornstarch because it was thick enough. Finally.  I added  3 tablespoons of crumbled bacon instead of salt.

This soup was awesome!!! easy to make and even though i didnt have garlic powder, realized after i started cooking I doubled up on the minced garlic. I also added some mushrooms and only immulsified half of the potato and leek mixture. Really tasty soup!

Amazing and easy!!! A wonderful Fall and Winter soup for those cold days when you need some home cooking comfort food. Very easy to make. I have been getting a lot of leeks in my CSA this Fall and having been making batches of this like crazy. This is actually my 3rd time making this recipe in 2 weeks. The recipe is perfect as is. I often add extra garlic to satisfy my love of garlic. A keeper for sure!

I have been looking for a great potato leek soup recipe.   This one is awesome!  You have to try this. I did not use the cornstarch also.  It had a perfect consistency.  Thank you for submitting this one.

Really nice recipe. Also omitted the cornstarch. I puréed half the soup and added 1/2 cup of 35% cream. Delicious!!
