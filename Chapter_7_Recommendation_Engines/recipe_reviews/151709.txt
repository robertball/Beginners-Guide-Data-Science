This was a really nice dish--the only thing I changed was the amount of asparagus. I shifted the ingredients to make enough for 5, and 1 large bunch of asparagus was more than enough. Really delicious and easy to make!

I enjoyed this, even though I needed to sub the tomato paste for ketchup because I forgot to pick it up at the store. I doubled the whole recipe, except the asparagus and we still had plenty asparagus! I think this would go perfect with some pita bread on the side as well.

Followed recipe, but have to say, it wasn't very tasty.
With just turmeric and 1 clove of garlic - it was rather bland. I don't think I'll make it again

Tweeked a few things to our taste. Doubled recipe to have leftovers for lunch. Increased garlic to 4 cloves & beef stock for water. Saute onion & garlic together, added all ingredients, but asparagus, & then threw all in slow cooker for 3-4 hrs on low. Meat came out sooo tender! Tossed 10 oz frozen asparagus tips (didn't have fresh) last 5 minutes, steamed up perfect! Husband said better than chili & he loves his TX chili!!! Thanks!

Ok this turned out delicious! But during the process I felt the recipe needed more heat..it was very sweet tomato-y. I doubled the recipe..using a can of tomato sauce..probably was the start of my problems..but I didn’t have tomato paste..4 garlic cloves, one seeded jalapeño(chopped) I wanted a thicker sauce so I used a can of coconut milk and a tablespoon of yellow curry..I had left over baked potatoes...so in they went..served with a scoop of jasmine rice and naan..yum

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  I served it over basmati rice.  The sauce is nice and creamy, but if you look at the ingredients, you'll see it's actually rather low in fat.  I'll definitely make it again, and I think it would also work well with other meats - chicken, beef - and with whatever vegetables are on hand, or even frozen vegetables to make it extra easy.  Note:  the second time I made it, I doubled the lamb to 1 pound.

Made it using cooked leftover boneless leg of lamb cut into cubes, fresh asparagus from the garden.  Sauteed the onions with garlic until soft, then added tumeric, 2 tsp of vindaloo seasoning, 3 oz. of tomato paste, and stirred. Then I added the asparagus  and lamb and let that cook for a minute before adding 1 cup of chicken stock. Covered and cooked on low for 20 minutes.  Served with oven roasted brown rice. I just wish I had some Naan. I think I may add a little cilantro to the mix next time. Yummy!
