Yum! I was worried it would be taste just of mushrooms, but I was pleasantly surprised. I used cheddar and pepper jack cheese with a couple dashes of hot sauce, because I love bold flavors. This is my mistake, but I didn't know what four cups of cooked pasta would be, so I just cooked a pound of pasta, which ended up being too much. Next time will measure like I should!

EDIT: I made this again, measured correctly, and used cheese soup instead of mushroom. I will definitely use the cheese soup again, it just gives it a little something extra.

This was the first meal I made for my boyfriend, so I really wanted to impress him. I doubled the recipe so I'd have enough for leftovers, but I wrote the recipe down wrong so I only added 1 cup milk instead of 2 cups like I should have when I doubled it. I used 1 package of 2-cheese blend & 1 package of cheddar cheese, & 1 package of parmesan cheese. I added 4 cooked chicken thighs that I had cut into cubes to the mix. I cooked it for about 5 minutes longer than said. My boyfriend loved it! He had seconds & thirds! I on the other hand didnt really like it, it was to cheesy for me. But I had it for lunch the next day and I loved it. Def. better the second day around. I now make this recipe almost weekly, its an easy to make and works well for work lunches. I like to add peas, celery, & onions. I also added sour cream once because I needed to get rid of it & it tasted great! Its a simple easy recipe that you can change to make it your own. A sure keeper!

I made this recipe for my son's birthday party and everyone (kids and adults alike) loved it!  I did replace the cream of mushroom soup with cheddar cheese in the can (mainly because my fiance hates mushrooms).  I used low fat cheese and skim milk, plus whole grain pasta.  I don't like mac-and-cheese, but like I said, everyone else raved about it!!!

It wasn't as good as I hoped it would be.  I don't think cream of mushroom soup goes with all cheeses.

This is quite good, will try the cheese soup next time. Adding some peas, carrots and onions to the recipe really makes it heartier and more flavorful. Best of all I just added some frozen vegetables to the pan and made this recipe in no time.

I made this tonight and it was EXTREMELY good! Cheesy deliciousness. It's the 1st recipe I've tried from here. The only changes I made was that I used 1 cup mild cheddar and 1 cup mozerella & I used Roasted garlic cream of mushroom & topped with cheese. So so so good! It's definitely going to be our go to mac n cheese now.

I added chicken to the meal as well as some frozen spinach and it is delicious. I have tried it with cheese soup as another reviewer suggested, however I do like it with the cream of mushroom.

I made this for a winter time shower dish and I had at least five women ask for the recipe. I added some minced garlic and used cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom. Very cheesey! And delicious! Great for potluck.

This is a really great and easy dish.  My family loves it and both my toddler and husband are picky eaters.  I make my recipe with the cheesy soup.  I haven't added anything addition but this is an easy recipe to add diced chicken, ham or turkey with some veggies.

I did not have two cheese blend so I just picked two cheeses (sharp cheddar, longhorn style colby), shredded them and used those. After stirring what I had grated into the rest of the ingredients, I did add another cup or so. I didn't really measure, I just kind of guessed and threw in. As with any cheesy dish, I added my own personal touches (squirt dijon, little Frank's Hot Sauce, onion/garlic powder) and I threw in about a cup and a half of blanched broccoli. This was very easy and there were no leftovers. This could be easily adapted to any condensed soup you have on hand. Next time, I might try this with Cream of Chicken or Cheddar Cheese soup.

A big hit. Everybody from my 16 month old to my husband loved this dish. I made it as suggested, including the cream of mushroom soup, and it was very good. It was cheesy enough as is, I don't know that I'd even want to try it with the cheese soup. This would be great with chicken in it!

I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't care for it. I think I might give it another chance and use cheese soup instead. The cream of mushroom just doesn't taste right to me.

I love this recipe. I added a little ground beef and it became my own version of hamburger helper. I shared it with a friend whose family is not fond of mushrooms so she substituted the soup with broccoli and cheese and she said her family loved her version too!

Loved this as did the husband! Next time I want to try to add chicken and try to make it a little more hearty of a meal. Would probably also work good with other add-in's that you would like with a cheesy nooddle (ex: tuna, veggies, etc..). Very easy and super quick!!

I was looking for something to use with leftover chicken.  This was perfect.  Besides adding the chicken I made the recipe as instructed (98% FF CM, and Chedder/Moz. mix).  I was suprised at how much flavor this had.  My husband loved it and it's going to become a regular.

Based on a lot of other reviews, I made some changes, but I agree that this is a great base recipe! I used cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom and I definately added some extra seasoning, a blend that I use in nearly everything. I also added a bag of cooked frozen vegetables. Finally, I topped it with some bread crumbs. It turned out great!

Used the advice of other reviewers and used the cheese soup instead of the mushroom soup. Doubled the recipe using a 12 oz box of elbow noodles and it turned out great.  Actually mixed it up the night before, pulled it out of the fridge the next day and baked it for a family get together.

Best mac and cheese I have ever had using the previous mentioned cheddar cheese soup instead of the cream of mushroom.

My husband absolutely loved this. I added some grilled chicken to the pasta. I thought it was very good but a little too cheesy for me. I'm sure I'll be making it again though.

Good, easy, quick.  Used cheese soup, cheddar, mozzarella and parmesan, and added chopped onions and bacon.  Will make again and try some pepper jack in the mix.

This is an exceptional dish. I usually make recipes the first time exactly the way it is written. However, this was adjusted out of necessity. My grandson said he does not like mushrooms so 
I used Broccoli Cheese soup. I misread the instructions and used a total of 4 1/3 cups of cheese. I added some mixed veggies and broccoli with cheese sauce to the soup/cheese mix as well some cooked shrimp. I did not bake it but sat it on low fire till it was heated through. I know it was good as that picky 6 year-old ate it  well. I will be making again and this time like the recipe reads.

Just ok. Kinda bland, not too much flavor in the recipe. I do add chicken and have tried many different cheese mixes. So far, gouda is the better choice. I did make this the first time as is and added several spices after it cooked and I tasted it. This recipe has much potential!!

I too had to tweak, to use up what I had, and this recipe seemed to be tweakable. I sautéed two onions and a 4 oz can of mushrooms with some garlic. Used 1 lb Scoobidoo noodles for fun, 1 can c. of broccoli and two cups milk, 1 T Italian seasoning and some black and cayenne pepper. I also threw in a handful of beans the kids brought in from the garden; I steamed these first though. My cheese mix was cheddar-mozz. I also had a rib steak left over from last night, so I diced that and added it. The whole thing fit nicely in a 9x13 pan. The result was creamy and flavourful, a great casserole and the kids just loved it, but I think all the additions I made helped the flavour a great deal. I'd call this a base recipe, and add your odds and ends as I did for a great casserole meal.

I added crushed Ritz Crackers to the ingredients and used 8 oz. of Mozzarella, 1/3 cup of cheddar, and 1/2 cup of parmesan. I mixed everything in a bowl before putting in the casserole dish. When there were only 5 minutes of bake time left, I layered the top of the casserole with crushed Ritz crackers. The husband could not stop eating it. This is definitely a new favorite and so simple to make. LOVE!

I used this recipe as a base. Instead of mushroom or the cheese soup, I used cream of asparagusm yummy.Then I added gloves of garlic, onion powder, garlic powder, cooking herb and garlic cream cheese a little dry mustard. added with the milk and cheese, blended it all together with some fresh vegies and topped with fresh parm. I made it as written a few times and loved it as well, just decided to dress it up a bit.

Yummy!  I used a can of cream of mushroom roasted garlic soup cause that's all I had. Used only sharp cheddar cause once again, that's all I had. I used a lot more than called for. Added shredded chicken, half a package of frozen broccoli and half a chopped onion. Topped with breadcrumbs. I could not stop eating it. Can't wait to make it again!

This is actually really tasty! I was afraid it would be bland or too cheesy, but not at all. I only made one change, I used cheddar soup instead of mushroom. The cheese blend I used was cheddar, mozzarella, and provolone. This was delish and I will definitely make it again!

My hubby and daughter loved this. I thought it was good but not great. I will make again using different soups and cheese and see what happens. Overall this is a quick, kid friendly side dish and a nice change from potatoes or rice.

Easy, tasty side with meatloaf. Nice alternative to the baked potatoes we usually have. Sprinkled additional Parmesan on the top for extra crispness. Yum!

I made this following the suggestions of others and substituted the mushroom soup for cheese.  It was sooo good I even got the approval of my little brother with this one and he's a mac 'n cheese critic. Definitely will be making this again!!!

Very tasty! I cooked chopped chicken breast and spinach and added prior to baking. Delicious and my toddler loved it.

I thought this was pretty good. I did think the mushroom soup was a little over powering, but the flavors were really nice. My husband loved this too! I think next time, I might use cream of onion soup and add some garlic to it and see how it turns out!

I substituted cream of chicken soup for the cream of mushroom soup, added 2 cans of chicken breast meat, garlic & onion powder, and sprinkled 2 cups of shredded cheese on the top

Made this as a side dish with Broiled Tilapia Parmesan (from Allrecipes) and it was a great choice. Very good recipe! Made exactly as recipe stated, only I may have used extra cheese because we love cheese (did use cheddar instead of the 2 cheese blend because thats what I had.) Thanks for another great recipe!! I will definitely make this one again!

This was good, but lacking something.  I added chicken breast seasoned with poultry seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I also sprinkled the top with Italian bread crumbs before putting in the oven.  It was good, but I think next time I will try cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom.

This was very good. My family really enjoyed it. I did sub Cheddar Cheese Soup for the Cream of Mushroom and I used a blend of Colby and Monteray Jack Cheese. I would definately use the Cheddar Cheese soup again but I think I would use a different blend of cheeses next time. Very creamy and cheesy. Perfect comfort food.

Very good.  I have made this twice now, and it was good both times (cheese soup was used both times). I had two kitchen helpers the second time, and they added in extra cheese and green peas (frozen green peas which were added after the baking was finished).  It was still very good!

This was pretty good.  I will def make this again, and it was easy to make.  I used 4 oz of sharp chedder, and 4 oz of mozzarella cheese for my 2-blend. Also, I didn't use reduced fat cream of mushroom.

This was pretty much macaroni and cheese with cream of mushroom soup.  Both my husband and I liked it for something different and will probably make it again, but I think I prefer good old mac and cheese!

this was just OK - I might replace the cream of mushroom soup with a different soup - perhaps cream of chicken.  There wasn't as much flavor as I was hoping for.

This was an awesome recipe. I did however change a little bit. I added salt and garlic powder to the mix. I also cooked up some chicken and sliced it up and mixed it in the casserol before baking. I also topped it with bread crumbs, shredded cheese and parmesean chease. It turned out AMAZING!!

This was good for something simple and quick, like an after work dinner.  For me, this was a little too cheesy, and I followed the recipe to the T.  I guess it could have been the kind of cheeses I used, but it was a little rich for me.  I'd make it again, just not a weekly meal for me.

I made it exactly as the recipe said.  I used a cheddar/hot pepper chese blend.  It was okay, hubby ate it but raved more about the chicken he did on the grill.  Which tells me he wasn't that crazy about it.  If I do this one again, I will more than likely use cheddar cheese soup.

This was really good. However I thought it lacked something, not sure what. Maybe next time I will add some bacon or chicken or pepper jack cheese to liven it up. Otherwise it was really easy and I enjoyed it and will make again.

I stuck to the recipe and it was okay. It definitely was better day two, but I'm a big protein eater so was not filling enought. I will make it again but with modifications adding meat to make it more of a meal.

This was extremely easy and wonderful!  I was out of cream of mushroom and used fat-free cream of chicken instead.

Did not think this was anything to rave about. Probably needed a lot more cheese. Maybe more of the two cheese mix. Would be a good side dish to a really strong flavored meat dish.

This was super good and easy to make.  I used cream of mushroom soup and thought it was perfect.  I also cut up and sauteed a couple chicken breasts in olive oil and garlic and added that to the mix.  The only problem I had was there was waaaay too much cheese.  I really love cheese but an 8 oz package was a lot.  I would probably only use half that next time.  My husband and I were pulling out huge wads of cheese and it was a bit much.  Other than that I loved it and will definitely make it again.

5 starts for easiness, 3 for taste...4 overall :) Next time I'm gonna try cream of chicken since I'm not a mushroom flavor fan.

This was very bland to me. I made it twice once using cream of mushroom and once using broccoli cheese soup. Both were really bland and could use something. I feel like the recipe has potential, but it is definately not there yet.

Great easy recipe! I made a few adjustments, I used Cheese cooking soup as suggested by some of ther other folks, added cayenne pepper to give it a little kick, used heavy cream instead of regular milk, added a dollop of sour cream to the mix, an egg and added some left over chicken. It turned out really yummy. Thanks for the principle idea :)

I thought for sure my 3 kids ages 7, 4, & 13 months would love this.  However my 13 month old was the only one who seemed to really like it.  I thought it was fair & so did my husband.  I substituted the cream of mushroom with the cheddar cheese soup as suggested by a few others.  It would have been helpful to know how much 4 cups was uncooked.  (I'd say it was about 2/3 of a 14 oz. box.)  I didn't quite have 4 cups, so I had to re-boil my water & make more.  Pain, but my mistake.

OK everybody after reading all the do's and don't I came up with this. I doubled this recipe so i used 2 boxes of pasta and I put some butter,lil season salt and pepper in it to taste. I used 1 can of chicken&mushroom and 1 can of cheese soup. After each can I added 1 cup of milk. I also added some chicken to the mix and after mixing everything 2gether I sprinkled it with a 4 cheese blend and put it in the oven 4 15min. It was great!!! my fiance' loved it he even came home on his lunch hour to get more. This was a great recipe.

My children are really picky.  They all enjoyed this dish.  The next day I added my favorite spaghetti sauce to the left overs and it was absolutely wonderful.  Very easy to make and easy to change up the left overs.  Will definitely keep this recipe at hand.

I just made this today.  I used cream of chicken soup rather than cream of mushroom and followed the rest of the directions exactly.  I LOVE cheese, but this was waaaay too cheesy and much too thick.  Maybe adding more milk would help.

Hmm....I wish it had 3.5 stars available.   There really isn't much to say - this is a very simple and predictable receipie. Nothing spectacular but it does make a nice side dish.   My husband and picky toddlers liked it so will make it again. I have tried cream of broccoli and cream of mushroom.  Personally I think cream of broccoli is better.   Give it a try!

I really liked this, and thought that it was a nice variation from plain ol' mac and cheese...but my husband hated it, and the kids thought it tasted plain. I could have added a little extra to enhance the flavor, but I always follow a new recipe to the letter the first time, then decide if it needs altering.

I first tried this when I was in high school a couple of years ago, everyone loved it in my nutrition wellness class. The only thing I changed was instead of chream of mushroom I added cream of chicken. I make it a lot and it is still so good. easy to make also which is a plus.

This actually wasn't too bad, just made, based on what I had in the house. It is on the salty side, from the canned soup and the amount of cheese. It kind of has a slight alfredo sauce flavor from the parmesan cheese. I only had about 3/4 of a cup of cheddar blend cheese left, so I used 1 1/4 cups of fresh grated mozzarella for the rest. The footnotes say to use 2 cups of cheese. I made sure to boil the pasta very well, so it did not soak up too much of the cheese sauce in the oven and dry out. I even took it out 2-3 minutes early. I was also concerned about it sticking to my baking pan, but it didn't at all after spraying the pan lightly with PAM. I recommend measuring the pasta after boiling as I found that I only ended up needing about 1/2 the bag of the 1 lb cooked bag to equal the 4 cups. It didn't make a lot, but I still ended up with some leftovers that never got eaten for some reason.

This was much better than I expected, although I did make a few changes to fit our lifestyle. For one, I used Health Valley mushroom soup, which is not condensed, so I only used 1/2 cup milk. I also added some steamed broccoli and onion we had on hand and threw some bread crumbs and paprika on the top just for kicks. The broccoli was a GREAT addition. But cheers for a creamy pasta recipe that was tasty and not runny! Family loved it.

I really liked this pasta...it was really simple and i always have the ingredients on hand when I need a quick meal idea. I cooked some chicken breasts and cut them into bite-sized pieces and mixed them into the pasta as well, yummy! I'll be making this again for sure!

This made a great side dish.  I added a can of spicy Rotels and some mustard powder.  I also put some bread crumbs on top and sprinkled the parm cheese on top rather than mixing it in.  This is a good recipe that could easily be made into an entire meal.

I used the cheese soup, as suggested, and it was a HUGE hit!  My husband is always asking me to make this for dinner now!!!  Two thumbs up!

This is my favorite go to mac n cheese recipe. It's so good just the way it's written and you can add your own twists to it and it never comes out bad.
Today I added a few crumbles of good blue cheese, yum!

I used a can of cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom.  It turned out very good.  My family loved it.  I think next time I will only bake it for 20-25 minutes.

It needed to have more seasoning besides just pepper.  Probably could have been made w/out the oven, by just cooking the noodles then after draining noodles mix the stuff together n just heat it up.

I thought this recipes would be great and before I wrote this review I tried it several times.  I just can' seem to make it anything more than average.  I tried to use cheeder cheese soup mix and different blends of cheese and could get it to taste just right.  It always had a tangy taste to it.  I will make it on occasion to try to get it right, but wasn't one of my favorites.

This recipe is pretty good. I wasn't all that impressed with it the first day, but it tasted much better the second day, after it had a chance to sit. I consider this to be more of a side dish, like macaroni n' cheese. My husband liked it. I will make it again.

Absolutely delicious!  I chopped up some thick cut bacon and mixed it into the dish, and then topped it with cornflake crumbs before putting it in the oven.  It was hard to stop eating it!

This was so easy and delicious to make. I've used generic cream of mushroom soup instead of Campbell's (still tasted good) and a combo of shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheeses. I would love to try other combos when I make it again. I wish I didn't use more than 2 cups since a third of the pasta were hard to eat.

I made this by the recipe. I did add 1/4 tsp. of dry minced garlic for more robust flavor. Also sprinkled top with Sweet Paprika for added color.

Absolutely loved it. My family loved it.
I was expecting macaroni and cheese, so it threw me off a little bit. Now I see why all the reviews said to add chicken or ham. It's more of a casserole. Great consistency and flavor. I added crushed ritz crackers to the top and cooked it in my toaster oven!  Will make again!

This is was delicious! I thought it was going to be bland, but it was flavorful and very cheesy. I only used sharp cheddar cheese, parmesan cheese, and 1 C cottage cheese. I also added bacon. I followed the advice of others and used cheddar instead of mushroom soup. I will be making this again. No doubt!

After reading the reviews, I decided to try and kick up the flavor a little. I added a can of drained Rotel and cut the milk by about 1/4 a cup and it was EXCELLENT! If you like things a little spicy, this is a great way to go!

Good, just needed a little more flavor for my taste. Next time I will try to spice it up a bit! But quick, easy and pretty good tasting.
