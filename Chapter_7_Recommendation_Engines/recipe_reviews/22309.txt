*Review just for bread, not for glaze* I made a few changes to this bread to make it healthy but oh. my. word. It was SSSOOOO good! Some of the reviewers said that there was no cantelopue taste,  but that's because the excessive amount of sugar was drowning it out. So I just used 3/4 cup of sugar. It was sweet enough and the canteloupe taste really came through. Just make sure you use VERY ripe canteloupe, mine was so soft I was scooping it out of the rind with a spoon.  Instead of the 1 cup of oil, I used just 2 tablespoons of oil but compensated for the liquid by adding 1/2 cup extra cantaloupe puree, 1/4 cup applesauce and 2 tablespoons honey. I also cut out an egg and used just 2. Lastly, I added 1/2 cup raisins to the batter and they just took the bread over the top. I also made this as four mini loaves. The bread came out so moist and fruity...NO ONE could stop raving about it! Thanks so much Linda K! This is a keeper and I made it healthy too so there's no reason not to make it again...and again...and again...:-)

This bread is very moist and has a nice cripsy/sweet crust... without the glaze.  Instead of using 1 cup of oil, I used an additional cup of cantaloupe.  For all my sweet baking, I always substitute applesauce for oil.  Now I know I can use cantaloupe too!

This bread was great and really moist.  I was apprehensive to make because of the odd use of cantaloupe, but I was so glad that I did.  It was excellent.  I did as another suggested and just added the pecans to the batter and skipped making the glaze.  I made mini loaves of this bread for a bake sale at work and everyone who bought it loved it.  I even surprised my husband, who hates cantaloupe, but loved the bread.

i did not like the results, but my husband and co workers did.  there wasn't any "cantelope taste" it was more like pumpkin bread.  if i make again i will leave off the praline glaze and put the nuts in the bread itself.

giving this an extra star for a great way to use up cantaloupe, and I like the fact that as you stated, Linda, it can be pureed and frozen for later use.  My cantaloupe was very sweet and ripe and with 2 cups sugar, I didn't do the glaze.  The cataloupe taste is mild.  Omitted cinnamon from the batter and instead sprinkled a cinnamon/sugar mixture into my sprayed pans before adding the batter.  only 1 tsp. of vanilla and added orange blossom water instead, as I have found that this enhances the flavor of cataloupe.  Used 3/4 applesauce and 1/4 oil and it is very moist.  Added the zest of one lime to the batter to give it a little more zing.  this made 2 nice loaves and I also made a small muffin to sample and review.  Easy recipe to throw together.  Next time I might add 1/4 tsp. more of salt to help enhance the cataloupe flavor.  It was nice to get an occasional small sliver of cataloupe.  I think I might puree 1 cup and leave one more cup of it a bit on the chunkier side.  Thanks for the great, easy, waste-not, want-not recipe, Linda!

This is a copy of Marlen's cantaloupe bread recipe she has shared several times but never with the praline topping.  That doesn't go with this bread at all.

This is a good tasting bread. Don't expect to taste cantaloupe in every bite - it taste like every other sweet bread. However, the cantaloupe makes it incredibly moist and the spices give this bread an extra kick and a great taste. I didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't like the glaze. The bread taste great without it.

I bake 24 muffins for 30 minutes and omit the praline glaze because the muffins are plenty sweet. Since only a couple of us like nuts, I add a teaspoon of nuts to individual batter-filled muffin cups and stir. Delicious!

I stumbled upon this recipe while looking for something to use up some cantaloupe. I have to say I was skeptical at first. I had never heard of making bread w/ cantaloupe before, but I'm so glad I tried. It is surprisingly good. I didn't make the glaze, and I don't think it really needs it. I will definitely make this again!

This bread was delicious and it was a HUGE HIT at the "Big Football Game With A Copyrighted Name" party I went to.  I'm not a fan of cantaloupe, but I love this.

I modified the recipe a bit to make it lower calorie and a little healthier.  Here's The ingredient list I used:
- 2 eggs
- 2 egg whites
- 1/4 C vegetable oil
- 3/4 C unsweetened applesauce
- 1 C Sugar
- 1 C splenda
- 2 C bread flour
- 1 C Whole Wheat Pastry Flour
- rest of the ingredients as written

Instead of the glaze, I mixed some white sugar and powdered sugar and dusted it on the top while the bread was still a little warm.

The bread froze well, too.

will definitely make this again.

FYI:  I am reviewing the bread without the glaze (nut allergy).  This bread is so moist, sweet, and delicious!  We have a new family favorite now.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was great! Because of my son's braces and nut allergies in other students at our parish school I couldn't add the pecans but even so this was a fantastic product. The next loaf will be strictly mine and will include pecans!

this bread is moist and firm making it easy to cut and not fall apart.  i used a very sweet ripe cantaloupe and recipe spices except no topping and pecans in the bread. it was tasty but lacking in any distinct flavor. it was sweet but rather plain.  the cantaloupe merely serves as the ingredient like applesauce that keeps baked goods moist and does not add much if any real flavor.  if i make it again, it will be to use up leftover cantaloupe and i will replace half of the white sugar with brown, add raisins and more ginger, and maybe some nutmeg to kick it up a little.  all in all, still a fairly good quick bread.

Amazing! Moist and spicy, and a hit with coworkers and kids alike. It doesn't even need the praline glaze. I followed other reviews and reduced the fat: 1/4 c. oil, 1/4 c. applesauce, 1/2 c. extra pureed cantaloupe. I will never worry again about too much or too ripe cantaloupe! It freezes well too.

Omit the glaze. The recipe fits in one 9x5 bread pan and two smaller aluminum bread pans. The consensus is the bread is better with chopped pecans in it. Use very ripe cantaloupe. I told everyone that it was pumpkin bread until they agreed that they liked it then I told them the truth. Many agreed that they wouldn't have tried cantaloupe bread. A definite keeper.

You just can’t go wrong with this bread…I found as one review said cut the cinnamon in half that gives the bread it’s on flavor otherwise it taste like banana nut.  I also found cutting the oil in half and cutting back on the sugar to 1 ½…I just added more cantaloupe to replace the oil…I tried adding applesauce to one batch to see if the flavor changed …it didn’t…I also used Israel melon to make a batch and with it there is a lighter flavor but still very good…I am putting melon and cantaloupe in the freezer to make more…thanks a lot…

This bread is a wonderful and unique spin on breakfast bread. It smells and looks FANTASTIC! I made 3 mini loaves and 12 muffins because I wanted to try a variety of add-ins. I did one loaf plain, one with walnuts and one with chocolate chips. The small loaf pans only needed 40 minutes in the oven before they were done, so make sure to watch them if you are going to make smaller loaves. However, the smell will wake you up if you forget about them! The muffins were done in 30 minutes, so again- be careful if you adjust the size of the pan! I did not add the glaze as suggested by others, delicious bread!

As strange as this sounds, this may be the best quick bread I've ever made.  It comes out moist, dense and tastes amazing.  I followed others suggestions and did not make the glaze but otherwise, followed as written.

This is really good! My husband brought home a ton of cantaloupe, and I can only eat so much of it! I did not make the glaze for this, but followed the rest as written. It is a great way to use up cantaloupe if you need to, but I wouldn't go out and buy it just for this recipe. Also, I think the fruit needs to be very ripe for this bread.

Very good--just has a hint of cantaloupe after you eat a few bites.  I didn't make the glaze-- it's a very sweet bread and doesn't need it.  (I used 1 c white sugar 1/2 c honey & 1/4 cup raw sugar.)  I put about 3/4 c pecans in the bread.  Also, I used 2 eggs, 1 T flax and added 3 more T puree. *Just an update--I love making this bread. It's so great for tasteless cantaloupes. It tweaks nicely, but I often just make it exactly as the recipe states. Quick bread perfection!

No one would believe me that this is cantaloupe! It was even hard for me to believe, as I absolutely hate cantaloupe!!! Delicious and moist, everyone thought this was banana bread. ;-) This recipe is one of my biggest bragging points - it can make even the biggest cantaloupe-hater a fan!!!

I found this way too sweet with the glaze and I cut the sugar by half.  I made 24 muffins instead of loaves one batch w/glaze and one without.  The batch without the glaze was very good, but still a little sweet for my taste so I would cut the sugar a bit more next time.  Great way to use up cantaloupe.

I made this with papaya puree, not cantaloupe. I figured they were both melons, and papayas are so inexpensive at the market right now, I wanted another way to use it. I followed other reviewers' suggestions to make this a little more healthy, sub'd applesauce for half the oil, whole wheat flour for half the AP flour, and Splenda for half the sugar. I also didn't make the Praline Glaze, this was sweet enough all by itself. It was a little dense at the bottom of the loaf, so the next time I made it, I doubled my soda and powder and increased my oven temp to 375. Yum! I've even made these as gifts, they're so good.

This turned out fabulous! I didn't have any vegetable oil on hand, so I took someone else's advice and replaced it with an additional cup of canteloupe puree. Also, I only had one loaf pan, so I made one loaf and the rest muffins. The muffins took about 30 min, and turned out great! Will definitely make again!

Like others I subbed an extra cup of cantaloupe for the oil, 1c whole wheat flour for 1c all purpose flour, used an egg substitute, and used half splenda half sugar.  I also added some dried cranberries and a tiny dash of allspice and nutmeg.  No glaze.  I made them in a muffin tin for about 35 min.  They were soooo tasty!  This made 18 muffins, each was 148 calories and only .4g fat!!!  I made a smaller batch with some added wheat germ too.  I'll definitely come back to this recipe if I have leftover cantaloupe again.

Hmmm...not sure about the flavor...yet. It's not that I don't like it but I'm not sure if I do either. Putting some butter on a slice, it was good. I think it needs more spice to it or be sweeter..not sure. I'll tweek the recipe the next time and spice it up a bit to my likings.  It IS a very moist bread. I will definitely try again because it seems that,like bananas, I always have some cantaloupe that I need to use up every now and then and this is such a good idea.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

I happily sliced into a cantaloupe, and popped a chunk in my mouth.  Turned out to be the most miserable, unripened melon ever!  So I made this bread.

I haven't topped it yet, but it is delicious as it is. It is moist and tasty and I would have otherwise thrown out the melon:)

My modifications were to use 3/4 cup Smart Balance spread, (slightly softened) and only 1/4 cup oil.  Because of the lack of sweetness in the cantaloupe I increased the sugar about 1/3 cup.  I toned the ginger down to 1/4t.   I am thrilled with the result. It's a do-over.

A great, very moist recipe. Not much cantaloupe flavor but a really good loaf/muffin. I think it'll be fabulous toasted. 


My changes:
- Reduced the sugar by 1/3 and didn't use the glaze (my cantaloupe was very sweet)
- Added a splash of orange juice
- Substituted 1/3 of all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour
- Replaced half the fat with pureed apples. 

These changes will create a product that will take longer to cook (>1 hr) but is very moist and flavorful while being lower fat, lower sugar, and higher fiber (usually the death knoll for baked goods).

Note: A large cantaloupe makes 3.5x this serving size.

I was looking for a way to use up some cantalope that has been in my fridge. I stumbled across this recipe. An figured I would give it a try. 3 words "Oh My God". this is such an incredible bread. I didn't use the glaze and instead of flouring the pan I sugared it instead. If you haven't tried this yet give it a shot.

I really, REALLY don't like cantaloupe so I was very hesitant to try this.  The kids really liked it and it tastes more of a spice cake than cantaloupe.  I figured with the amount of oil and eggs that the praline glaze was just a extra calories and omitted it.  No one missed it as the bread was moist enough.  I took it to work and played a guessing game--no one guessed.  I didn't have ground ginger, so I used all spice and nutmeg...I also increased the cinnamon by a tsp.

EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS PUMPKIN BREAD - which is a good thing since no one has heard of Cantaloupe Bread......until now ~ THEY WANT THE RECIPE & I come from a family that BAKES & knows their stuff !  Made recipe exactly as written (put the eggs/oil/sugar/vanilla & cantaloupe chunks in a blender and it worked great).  Did not leave in oven the full hour.......super moist bread - although the loaves were flatter than normal - I would still use the two pans to prevent overflow or a mushy middle.  Did not make the Praline Glaze - still PERFECT RECIPE AS WRITTEN !!

Excellent way to use up ripe cantaloupe. I didn't use the glaze because the bread is sweet enough. My friend said it could use some nuts, so next time I will put the nuts is the bread. I swirled a cinnamon sugar swirl through the bread before baking, that is where I will add the nuts as well.

After reading reviews, I cut oil to 1/2 cup, reduced sugar to 1.5 cups, increased pureed cantaloupe to 2.5 cups, exchanged vanilla extract with lemon extract, added about 1 tsp orange zest, 1 tsp lemon zest and 2 tbsp poppyseeds just for fun. Skipped icing. Bake in bundt pan for about an hour. Really moist cake, interesting taste.

VERY moist, and a wonderful solution to having too much cantaloupe on hand or a cantaloupe that's a little too ripe.  You can almost not notice the flavor of the cantaloupe in the bread, but it adds a very mild, aromatic flavor that is wonderful.

So I guess I can't really give this all 5 stars because I didn't put the praline glaze on, but the bread alone deserves 5 stars! What a great way to use up my over-ripe cantaloupe! Everyone LOVES this bread!!

unbelievable!!  I was so hesitant about making this recipe- I mean "cantaloupe" in a bread.  I am so glad I had second thoughts.  Other reviewers were right on saying that it was somewhat like a pumpkin bread.  I did cut the sugar in half and added raisins to my batter and it was plenty sweet and absolutely delicious!  I also left the glaze out, but this was just amazing. Thanks for this keeper!

I made these as mini muffins, cooking them at 350 degrees for 22 minutes. I added the nuts into the batter, also replacing the oil with another cup of cantaloupe. A good use of an abundant crop.

This was fabulous.  They has cantaloupe on sale at 10 vents a pound and I loaded up.  I most definitely will make this again.  Half the oil and replace with more cantaloupe.  Don't skip the glaze!

This was an excellent way to use up some of the cantaloupe we have. I didn't do the glaze, as I had no pecans. Subbed half the oil called for with applesauce, per my husbands request. He said a whole cup of oil was more than he'd like to know was in there! If you like spice breads (pumpkin,apple,pear), try this. It came out moist and we liked the flavor alot. Baked in 2 pans--one a 10x6x4. The other a 9x5x3. The smaller of the two took only 45 minutes to bake. The larger took the full hour.

I was shocked at how good these were.  Since they were for my kids and I didn't want them to have the extra sugar I skipped the glaze.  I also made some other changes for health reasons....used half whole wheat flour, substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil and used honey instead of sugar (converstion is 3/4 c. honey for 1 c. sugar and then lessen 1/4 c. liquid, in this case vegetable oil or applesauce).  Also added some ground flax seed.  My loaf pan was in use so I made muffins and they were great.  No particular flavor stood out but they were an amazing consistency...dense but not crumbly like a lot of muffin.    I didn't give them a 5 because the taste wasn't spectacular or anything I'd crave, but I will definitely make these again as they are pretty tasty and a great texture (although not sure if that's from the changes I made or not).

We loved this!  Who would have thought you could make bread out of cantaloupe?  Well, I guess there IS zucchini bread!  I did change a few things.  We did not like the praline glaze, in fact we scraped it off, so did the kids.  The second time I made it I added more nutmeg, about 3/4 of a teaspoon more and a little more ginger.  The original recipe calls for two bread pans, but I found the loaves to be a bit short.  So the second time I doubled the recipe put it in three pans. Excellent!  Good thing I had a bumper crop of cantaloupe, I've been freezing it all week so we can have this yummy bread all winter!

Very happily surprised that this turned out so yummy! My son requests it everyday for his snack at school... so I made extra and watched it disappear all week! I did add a little more ginger and cinnamon and also a bit of nutmeg, the second time making it to spice it up a little! YUM!

This bread has great texture...nice crispy top and moist inside.  Only problem is there pretty much is very little flavor.  I skipped the glaze on top and put nuts in the batter, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I wonder what it would taste like if you replaced all the oil with more pureed cantaloupe?

YUM! This was really good.  My 1 year old got a taste and now he squeals at me when I open the bread bag, he loves it!  My husband- who is pretty sick of homemade bread at this point- is eating it up.  I didn't use the glaze,reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup, replaced 1/2c. of oil with applesauce.  Very sweet bread with a hint of cantaloupe aftertaste, nice!  Turned out great!

Excellent - rave reviews from my husbands co-workers - Made it in a BUNDT pan (cook time still 1 hr) and used Whole Wheat flour and Splenda (instead of sugar, used 2 cups, may try a little less next time).  A bit more nutritious/lower carb and the folks love it.  Did not use glaze.

Awesome recipe.I make a lot of different breads,and this is surely a keeper.Couldn't decide if I wanted to try the topping or not,so did a loaf each way.The topping was kind of hard (maybe because i halfed the recipe and cooked for same length of time in microwave?)It still tasted good though but was kind of hard to cut the bread.All in all ,a winner either way.The kids loved the sweetness of the praline topping.Thanks

I was skeptical when I saw the recipes, but the with bumper crop of cantaloupe this year, I had to try something new.  I was so excited when it came out so moist and delicious.  You can't even tell there is cantaloupe in it.  I did put the nuts in the bread as suggested by others and omitted the praline topping.  Also, I subsituted half of the sugar with Splenda.  You can't even tell the difference.  I may substitute more of the sugar next time and substitute half of the white flour for wheat flour so my diabetic father can enjoy.  Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe.  Definitely the find of the season.

I was searching for a recipe to use up some canteloupe. Came across this one and although it sounded weird, I gave it a try. I made half of the recipe - just in case. I went with some of the other suggestions and left out the glaze, adding walnuts to the batter. What a pleasant surprise! Didn't tell my fiancee what it was until I got the thumbs up. He was surprised but ate it up! Now I wish I had made the whole recipe! Will make again.

I had cantaloupe given to me that wasn't ripe. I didn't want to waste it so I got online and found this recipe. I also do not use vegetable oil very often and I did not have any applesauce on hand. After I pureed the really tough cantaloupe, I made half the recipe so I could have just one loaf as a test. I used 2 cups of cantaloupe for half the recipe in exchange for the vegetable oil as someone else had suggested. I'm not too fond of pecans, so instead of a praline glaze, I used the brown sugar and margarine and put cinnamon in it .   then I sprinkled some shredded coconut on top and put it back in the oven for about 2 minutes at 400 degrees to toast the coconut. It was a really decent recipe , and I agree it does not taste anything like pumpkin; it does have a unique flavor all of its own.

This is a really great recipe to use up very ripe cantaloupe.  I made the bread portion, but not the topping.  We like to toast the bread for breakfast and I knew the topping wouldn't work in the toaster.  The one change I used in bread recipe was to sub 1/2 c. applesauce for 1/2 c. of the oil.  I knew one cup of oil would make the bread have a super moist texture.  Even with subbing out part of the oil, the bread has a moist, almost sticky feeling to the texture. I made 5 smaller (3 1/2 x 6) pans rather than 2 big pans, baking them for 45 minutes.  The taste is wonderful and the house smells amazing while it is baking.  I appreciate this recipe for the simple fact that I hate wasting food, and this is a great use for ripe cantaloupe.

The bread is nice and moist but there's no taste of cantaloupe. Also the amount of sugar and oil needed to make this is crazy, compared to a banana bread for example. Also the glaze in the end is requiring 2 2/3 chups of brown sugar. There was no way I could put all of that thick sugary buttery glaze on. Maybe it'ssupposed toonly be a 2/3 cup, I'm not sure. Regardless,  I will not be making this again. I may substitute cantaloupe for the banana in the banana bread recipe but this recipe will not get saved.

My family was very skeptical when I told them what I was going to do with our leftover, over-ripe cantaloupe. But when the bread was baking, I saw their noses twitching, wondering what that heavenly smell was. And when they tasted it, they were amazed at how yummy it was! They couldn't stop raving! 

I used butter instead of vegetable oil or margarine, and I added some cinnamon and vanilla to the topping. Incredibly tasty results!

My only complaint is that there's so much fat and sugar in it- and our family is trying to cut back on those things. I think next time I make it I will try using applesauce instead of shortening and honey or blue agave instead of sugar. And I'll have to forego that amazing topping completely. But for an every-once-in-a-while treat, the original recipe is great!

I came across this recipe while searching for ways to use up a cantaloupe from the farm market.  Well, I had never heard of cantaloupe bread, so I was intrigued.  I made one loaf to try it out, using just one egg, which worked out fine.  I put all my liquid ingredients in a blender, along with the cantaloupe and sugar (I used half white and half brown) and pureed it until smooth.  Then  added it to the dry ingredients.  I also folded in 1/2 cup of chopped pecans that I had dusted with flour.  I baked this at 350 degrees, and it still took about an hour and ten minutes.  I did turn the temp down to 325 for the last ten minutes so the edges wouldn’t get too brown.  As many other reviewers, I opted to skip the glaze.  This was a delightful little quick bread with a nice amount of spice.  I wouldn’t hesitate to make it again!  Update 8/16/13 - My neighbor made this bread and suggested changing the glaze amounts as follows: 5 T. butter, 2/3 cup brown sugar and the full cup of pecans for two loaves.

Great, unique, but will probably lessen the amount of cinnamon next time.  That much made it taste too close to banana bread.

Easy and tastes great. It is sweet with a subtle flavor of canteloupe. I would make the glaze after the bread comes out of the oven rather than while it is baking.

Very good and different.  I'd never heard of cantaloupe bread before so I had to try it.  I had 1/2 of a smaller melon and got about one cup of puree, so I just made one loaf but used 2 eggs.  The glaze didn't need 3 minutes in the microwave, only about 1 1/2.  Very, very moist bread.  Subtle flavors but I was pretty pleased with the recipe.

This is the best bread I've ever made!  Had a whole cantaloupe that no one in my family was eating, so I found this recipe and tried it out.  Brought it to two events and everyone raved about it. Please take the time to make the glaze...well worth it!  However, I did omit the nuts.  Also cooked one half in loaf pan and other half as cupcakes.

Wow! Delish! I subed half the oil for an extra half cup of cantaloupe puree because one whole cup kinda sounded gross to me, the sub worked great! I only had one bread pan so the other half of the batter filled 12 muffin cups and the muffins cooked in 30 min. This is a perfect recipee b/c my super-picky family doesn't eat cantaloupe and I love it, so the way I make it uses up about 3/4 of a small cantaloupe which leaves me with a couple fresh slices! Yum!

Really enjoyed this, used an extra cup of cantaloupe instead of oil.  Very moist.  Had everyone try it and try to guess, of course no one could figure it out!  A great way to use up some extra cantaloupe.  Made without the praline glaze and it was plenty sweet.  Would prob increase the cinnamon just a bit next time.   This will be a regular recipe in my kitchen.

Awesome bread!  Who knew that cantaloupe bread would be good?  And who knew that there was such a thing as cantaloupe bread!!! I did what one of the others suggested and used 1/4 c. oil and 3/4 c. applesauce.  Didn't notice a difference at all.  In fact, next time I think I'll use all applesauce.  I also used egg beaters instead of eggs and that turned out fine as well.  Thanks for the recipe.  It was great!

WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS TO INSTURCTIONS THIS IS WAY FAR BETTER THAN ANY BREAD I HAVE MADE.  I CAME FACE TO FACE WITH 200+ CANTALOUPE AND HAD TO DO SOMETHING. TO CHANGE THE RECIPE-1. I SKIPPED THE GLAZE AND PUT THE NUTS IN THE BREAD. 2. I PUT WAX PAPER IN THE BOTTOM SO IT WOULD COME OUT MORE EASILY. OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!

This was surprisingly good for what it is, although I still prefer banana nut bread.  I'd never heard of cantaloupe bread before, but I had some cantaloupe sitting around and thought I'd try it out.  I halved the recipe to make one loaf and it came out pretty small using about half the pan.  I skipped the glaze, and made the following changes: replaced half the sugar with splenda, replaced half the oil with no sugar added granny smith apple sauce, added 1 tbsp sugar free orange syrup, added pecans to the batter, and a bit of shredded coconut.  It really doesn't taste much like cantaloupe and I was glad for that.  It's definitely super moist too.  I topped my slice with strawberries and a squirt of whipped cream and it was very refreshing. Didn't need the glaze at all.

A nice way to use of end-of-the-summer cantaloupe. I halved the recipe to make one loaf, and even then reduced the oil considerably (you could probably even sub applesauce in place of the oil, or do 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 oil). The glaze on this is really nice and adds an extra crunch. Reminds one of a pumpkin bread.

This was delicious!  Really doesn't taste like cantaloupe.  I reduced the sugar about 25% and also used 1/2 applesauce for the oil.  It was very moist!  I didn't put the glaze on...plenty tasty without it. :)

I think this recipe was a Godsend...for the past week my beloved had been reminding me to *please* eat the canteloupe sitting on the kitchen counter (4 lbs for a dollar!  We couldn't resist!) and lo and behold, I found this recipe.  It's extremely tasty and moist and yummy and and and...!

It was an excellent bread, except for the praline glaze which was a little to sweet.  I will most certainly make again and put the nuts inside the bread and leave the glaze off.

My fiance sprung this on me one night last summer. Tasted pretty fine, though I wasent to pleased with the ingrediants (I prefer meat, even in my cakes; cantaloupe takes some getting used to).
Overall a big thumbs up. Ill get her to make it again for me! Was great while watching the hockey game.

This bread was excellent.  Very easy to make and a good way to use up cantaloupe that has overripened.  I made some modifications to "healthy" it up.  I discarded 2 of the egg yolks, replaced 1/2 of the oil with plain non-fat yogurt, replaced one of the cups of flour with wheat flour, and used 1 1/2 c. of sugar instead of 2 c.  I added walnuts also because I love walnuts.  I did not make a praline glaze for the bread.  I think it still turned out excellent with the modifications.

I made the recipe exactly as written, though the praline topping was not appealing so I didn't  add it. It was okay but was more bland tasting than I had expected. I haven't given up on the idea but will likely make some changes the next time I make it. I will probably add nuts to the batter and adjust the sugar (reduce) and spices (change or increase).

The bread turned out wonderful—the praline glaze not so much. The directions for the glaze need to state the power setting on microwave. I followed directions exactly and my glaze semi-solidified. I will just have to heat glaze for a shorter amount of time the next time I make it.

I really liked this, but my husband loved it. I thought the praline glaze went very well with it (I was worried since another commenter said it did not). Probably won't make again because it really doesn't taste like cantaloupe and honestly it reminded me of banana bread -- so I would rather just make the banana bread :)

This is an add on to my 1st review. (Idk how to edit my review ??)
I made some muffins (they came out fine) plus  put it in an 8x8 pan (which i burnt the edges, so i had to cut off the edges & scrape the top. )
It came out w/ the texture like cornbread.  It tastes fine. Just slightly dry. So if i make this again w/ coconut flour, ill add another cup of milk.
All in all not too bad.

I believe in not faulting the recipe creator if you don't follow their recipe, but use it for inspiration, so I give this a 5 stars.  #1) because this gave me something to do with a ripe canteloupe which I ended up pureeing and mixing into a box carrot cake spice mix (I reduced some of the liquid from their recipe). #2) because the praline glaze is a great recipe in its own right.  I didn't have brown sugar so I made a mix of white sugar and maple syrup, added chopped up mixed nuts and almond extract and it was a delicious outcome!

I made this without oil and without glaze. I subbed an additional cup of cantaloupe for the oil. It was good but still didn't taste like cantaloupe. I did notice an aftertaste of cantaloupe though.

OH MY GOODNESS!!! 
   This bread is AWESOME! I love cantaloupe anyway, and this just took it up a notch!  Stock up on cantaloupe when it is bountiful ,flavorful,and inexpensive!  Freezes really well! My family especially lived the praline glaze ! I loved how easy it ALL was!

this bread is amazing. Made it with EVOO and doubled the recipe (only 1 1/2 C. instead of the full amount of EVOO) used a coarse granulated brown sugar for the topping and put it on before baking. Sunk into the bread for gooey swirls after baking. Solved the problem of the topping ruining the bread because it did not taste good on top. When pricking for doneness though make sure you are testing the bread part and not in the gooey part because it will appear not done, baked 1 hour exactly and it was marvelous!!!!

Made with changes suggested by 400luv and as per many peoples recommendation, I skipped the glaze. If I made this again I would cut down a bit on the ginger or substitute some other less aggressive spice. Not that I don't like ginger, but if you are trying to get cantaloupe taste to come through then every little bit helps. Very tasty bread but in a blind taste test I still would not have identified it as cantaloupe and that was with using local farm grown cantaloupe and not puréeing it too fine.

I just made this just as the recipe said. I did not put the Glaze on though becuase I dont like pecans and I wanted it to be more of a bread. This is just as good as banana bread, only using Canteloupe.

This is pretty good!  There is a nut allergy in our house so we of course left out the nuts, which I'm thinking would have given a nice crunch to it. Perhaps chocolate chips could take care of that :-)

Overall this is pretty good, and a great use of cantaloupe if you have some that you aren't going to be able to eat before it goes bad; make this bread!

It was just okay. The flavor didn't come through at all, and even with the spices and orange peel I added, and nuts in the batter there wasn't much interesting about it.  I'm going to top it with a cream cheese frosting just to give it a little more pizzazz.

I followed the recipe, but I modified it by adding 1/4 cup of black walnuts to the batter since I joy the texture and taste of walnuts inside my bread. I changed the serving size from 20 to 10. The All Recipes website automatically adjust the quantities for you. This makes life so much easier. I must say I am very pleased with the final result. 

Even if you don't like or care for melon you will love this recipe...
somehow the melon mixed with the vanilla and other ingredients taste like banana with a hint of melon. It's amazing....It's a familiar.. and intriguing all at the same time. This bread is really moist and delicious.

In my stove this bread bakes in like 35-40 minutes not 1 hour. You should do the toothpick test to determine when it ready to come out the stove. The praline glaze with pecans over the bread is heaven on earth. 

This recipe is "the bomb.com"...I went further and topped the bread with scoop of vanilla ice cream...whew....Good times!  I will make this again. Just like Mr. Food used say "Hum, Hum - Its so good."

I have a lot of cantaloupe growing this time of year and thought I'd give this recipe a try. It was very delicious and moist without a distinct "cantaloupe" flavor. It is similar to zucchini bread. I love the topping as well! The ONLY change I made to this recipe was to use real butter instead of oil in the bread dough which gave it an amazing flavor! I also did not have any pecans, so we just drizzled the sauce over the warm bread and let it sit. DELICIOUS!!!

Made this for a "Chopped" type dinner where we were to bring something using any type of melon. This recipe was an interesting twist, so made it. Using suggestions from other reviewers, I cut the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon and used a bundt cake pan (easier to serve).  I did not make the glaze due to my nut allergy and a lot of the reviews saying bread was already sweet enough. This bread was a HUGE hit, particularly with the children at the dinner! One of the teenagers stated "this bread would be awesome with maple bacon crushed up on top!" -- I may try that next time, LOL!  This recipe is most definitely a keeper and I will make it often!

I too had an under ripe cantaloupe when I found this recipe.  I made the following changes to the recipe when I made my bread.  3/4 cup softened butter to replace the oil, 3 cups of bread flour, 3 teaspoons of baking powder, and I added 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1 cup dried cranberries.  I increased the baking temperature to 350°F.  I baked this batter in 3 smaller-sized, prepared loaf pans and I lined the bottom of the pans with parchment paper to prevent sticking.  It was moist and not too dense. I did not make the glaze. I cut into it while still warm and had a slice with butter melted into it. The bread had just enough sweetness and a delicate flavor. I then tried a slice with cream cheese I had whipped with my mixer, and what a wonderful added flavor to the bread. Cream cheese between two thin slices and cut on the diagonal will make wonderful treats for any occasion.

Everyone loved this cake. Even my kids that all HATE cantaloupe!Made one loaf as directed and added chopped pecans to the second one. Both were successful. I used frozen cantaloupe that I had previously pureed. I didn't not bother making the glaze because I thought that there was enough sugar already in the batter.

I found this recipe about 10 years ago for my sister's wedding.  I dug it back up for my brother's wedding.  It was still a hit!  Everyone loved it.  We served it on the cookie table as a filler.  It went faster than the cookies.
This is requested for every wedding we have in our family.  Will be making it for my nephew's wedding in 2017.

Excellent recipe. My family loved it and my son never eats this kind of stuff (so it was indeed a surprise)! He advice was to put the nuts in the bread instead of on top. I'll try this next time :)

I had bought a rather large cantaloupe from the farmer's market.  It was only so-so and I was having a hard time eating all by myself since my children didn't care for it.  I am so glad I found this recipe!  I was also pleased to learn, from the reviews, that pureed cantaloupe is like applesauce in that you can use it to reduce the amount of oil in a sweet recipe.  So, I added a half cup more cantaloupe and used that much less oil.  Turned out great!  The children devoured this bread and were bummed when it was all gone!  I think I'll have to plant some cantaloupe next year!

Quite disappointed.I was excited to try this and followed the recipe exactly, figuring I wanted to first start from there to determine if I liked it and then determine how I might or might not want to modify it. Now that I've made it I don't think it's worth modifying because I have so many really good recipes for other breads that it seemed silly to work on modifying this one to make it taste like one of the great ones I already have! On the plus side, this bread has a very nice texture and is very moist. The problem is that it is very nondescript -- it has no real "character"of its own. Some reviews said it tastes like banana or pumpkin bread -- not so! Those breads are amazing and each has a unique character of its own. But this bread offers nothing special. It IS good for using up cantaloupe, but then we don't need this recipe to accomplish that, since cantaloupe can be used in the same way as applesauce in a wide variety of breads. Sorry, but this one's not a keeper.

Moist without overpowering cantaloupe flavor, baked in a bundt pan 55 minutes @ 325. Didn't make the glaze, but otherwise followed recipe. Very good.

It was super moist and a good use for a melon that needs to be used but DID NOT taste like melon at all...I rate a recipe by flavor and desire to use it again...so this one gets a 2 and it will not be added to the recipe box.  Disappointed.

AMAZING! I'm not a huge fan of loaves, but this was so moist and SO tasty! I left out the glaze, but made everything else exactly as it says. Thanks for helping me use up my cantaloupe!!!

Our whole family loves this recipe.  The most time consuming part is getting the cantaloupe ready.  I was able to get 6 cups of puree from one cantaloupe, so I divided and froze what I didn't need.  This bread does not taste like cantaloupe - it is more like a spice bread or pumpkin bread.

Not bad, but not fantastic either. Like others have mentioned it didn't really have any kind of cantaloupey taste, instead it tasted more like a spice bread. Albeit a good spice bread, but I was looking for a cantaloupe flavor.

Pretty good.  I added extra cantaloupe and didn't use the praline glaze.  It was sweet enough without it.  The bread is very moist and has a cake-like texture.  It reminds me of pumpkin bread.

I couldn't decide if I liked this bread or not.It was very moist but I just wasn't wild about the flavor.My mom really liked it and said it reminded her of pumpkin bread.I did leave the glaze off because I thought it would make it way too sweet.It was fun to try it but it's just not my favorite.

Wonderful!!  I was very skeptical to try this recipe but it turned out so yummy!!  I also, cut the oil in half and added a bit more cantaloupe.  I added a bit of nutmeg and left off the glaze.  Defiantly sweet enough for breakfast without it.  My 6 year old told me to double the recipe next time. Great recipe, Thanks!

I really liked this recipe. I took it to my sister-in-law after she had her baby. They really enjoyed it. The bread kind of tasted like pumpkin bread but you could definitely taste the cantaloupe. I think the glaze on the top made the bread. Will make again for sure!

I ended up making these into muffins. I got 24 muffins of this batter. Very good flavor-can definately taste the cantaloupe. I used 1/2 of a cantaloupe & pureed it in the blender. I didn't make the glaze but will try it next time for sure!

I halved the recipe and made many of the same healthy substitutions as other reviewers, and it came out pretty well! The only problem (and I may have either mis-measured my baking powder or soda, or it was just the substitutions I made) but the bread didn't rise very much at all. Didn't make the glaze as the bread is sweet enough by itself. Its a great way to use cantaloupe!

This is a favorite recipe in my household. I would give it 5 stars, but I made it without the glaze, so I can't judge how that qouls affect the recipe. The bread itself is the best quickbread I have ever put into my mouth, and I don't like cantaloupe.

I made this last night without the glaze.  We loved it.  My cantaloupe was the sweetest I've ever had, so I probably could have cut the sugar, but this is definite winner.

This bread was surprisingly good.  I had a cantaloupe left over before heading out on holiday, so decided to puree it and give this recipe a go when I returned.  I followed the advice of several members and did not make the glaze but added the pecans to the recipe.  I also left out the oil and replaced it with additional cantaloupe puree.  And, for the sugar, I did half sugar, half Splenda.  The bread is yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

Bread liked by adults and children.  Did not do praline glaze and reduced sugar by 25%. I have made the recipe twice and will make again.  Perfect way to use up those not quite ripe cantaloupes.

this bread was soooo good. My boyfriend, toddler, and I went through a whole loaf just for breakfast. It is unbelievably moist, kinda like cake. I put melted Smartbalance and brown sugar on top, but didn't have any nuts so i left those out. I strongly dislike canteloupe, but I LOVED this. My neighbor and coworker tried it also, and it was a hit.

This was great.  I had a fruit platter a few days ago and was looking for ways to use the fruit before it went rotten.  This bread was so easy and yummy.  My picky husband even liked it.  Who knew you could make bread using melon?  Seems weird, but it works!

Wonderful bread!  Similar to other fruit breads with a slightly different taste.  The glaze is super sweet so you don't need much.  No one will ever guess that it's cantaloupe!

Very moist and the cantaloupe gives it a nice sweetness but not too sweet. Everyone loved it!

Substituted one cup of whole wheat for one cup of flour, one cup of Splenda for one cup of sugar, and 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil. Skipped the topping.  Came out nice, but would add 1 cup of chopped walnuts next time. Can't taste the cantaloupe though, more like a banana bread (that's what the kids thought it was).

I had a cantaloupe to use up and this was a perfect recipe.  I would not change anything.  I did not make the pecan topping and it was great without it.  I will make again!!

This was a wonderful moist bread that kept well for days.  I was really surprised that it didn't taste like cantaloupe.  Not weird at all.  It was wonderful and my family loved it.  I mixed the nuts in the bread as someone else suggested and instead of the icing on top and put a brown sugar and water glaze.  That turned out great too!
