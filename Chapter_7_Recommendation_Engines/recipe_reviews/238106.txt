Fantastic Grainfree Yumminess! As the cook noted, you can use raw sugar, and I did. I couldn't envision only 2 T of coconut flour standing up against so much liquid so skipped the honey for the heck of it. I broke the eggs in a bowl first, added the salt, soda and sugar and whipped it around, to help all melt and meld. I used Trader Joes Organic natural creamy unsalted peanut butter. Added the chips last. I was very concerned that the batter was oily and very wet, so i chilled it for an hour. My batter is BROWN and looks nothing like the photos, but no worries. I pulled the dough from the frig, formed balls about the size of a large walnut, and baked on parchment paper. They did not lose their shape, and there was a fair amount of oil that emerged under each ball. Baked for 12 minutes, turned the cookie sheet and did another 5. Now, right out of the oven, these puppies will crumble...but just a half hour cooling, they are holding together well enough for me to take them to an event tomorrow. I am going to refrig them tonight. These cookies are really delicious to me; I am very comfy with grain free and coconut flour and what to expect. My husband prefers a normal wheatflour cookie and wasnt all that thrilled. I am going to try this with a sugar-substitute for a low-carb and grain free cookie for ME, and I really appreciate the recipe! Final note: the mini-chips add NO choc flavor to me and wouldnt be missed. I would either add the regular sized dark chocolate chips or none.

So Excellent!! This was my first attempt with coconut flour and I picked a real winner! Limited pantry changes: no peanut butter so used crunchy almond butter, no mini chips so used regular. I like to use Himalayan pink salt when there is liquid to dissolve it, so put it and soda into the honey for a few minutes. I used parchment paper and, after cooling baked cookies a minute or two, I slid the whole sheet onto the counter. This bypasses greasing the cookie sheet and lifting cookies with a spatula. So much easier. The cookies were beautiful! This recipe made exactly the number of cookies stated and baked perfectly to the time given. I cannot say how they will keep as there were none left TO keep.

I substituted almond butter for peanut butter. The almond, chocolate, and very light coconut combo is amazing! I can see how peanut butter would be sweeter. I doubled the recipe and yielded almost 60 cookies! Thank goodness we could keep some and take the rest to a cookie exchange. I baked them on parchment paper. The undercooked ones stuck to the paper. Definitely keep the cookies baking at least 15 total minutes. These are so healthy you could eat them for breakfast. But my husband, who usually turns up his nose at healthy stuff--even almond butter--said, "These are really good. Make more of these."

What a delicious surprise these cookies are! I only had a half jar of Jiffy reduced fat creamy peanut butter, so I halved the recipe and added some chopped walnuts. We couldn't believe how plump and great tasting these are. 

Thank you Lmarie!

Made these just like recipe calls for, except I used regular Ghirardelli chocolate chips.  Very tasty!

These were horrible.  I don't know why people post GF receipes that are terrible.  It's such a waste of my time.

Pretty good grain-free cookies.  I read that it turns out dry beforehand, so I added about 1/4 cup of milk to make it more moist.  They turned out pretty good.  I also substituted the honey for 1/2 cup baking stevia to make them low sugar.  Something is missing though, next time I might add some spice, like pumpkin spice or cinnamon.  All in all though, this recipe was pretty yummy.  It would also be fun to try subbing some of the peanut butter for nutella next time, or experimenting with different nut butters.

Delicious! I made these with chocolate hazelnut butter instead of peanut butter, and they were soft and chewy. I had to cook them a little longer than it says.

These are pretty good, a little dry. I added peanut butter chips along with dark chocolate chips.

Not bad for a gluten free recipe. It was simple and very easy to make, but kind of crumbly. I made a half batch and used sugar instead of honey as the recipe allowed.

Cut the salt! At least by half. I will leave out completely the next time I make these.
