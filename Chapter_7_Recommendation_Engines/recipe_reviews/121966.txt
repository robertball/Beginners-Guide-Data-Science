This was a really good salad. I am giving it a 4 instead of 5 because I thought it was a bit boring as written. I added black olives, feta cheese and used Kraft sundried tomato vinegarette dressing. I didn't have fresh basil and neither did the grocery store so I had to use dried. I was pretty bummed out about that. I'm sure fresh would be way better. I will make this again though and I'll be more prepared next time and make sure I have fresh basil. I also thought the bread to produce ratio was a bit off. Too much bread not enough tomatoes and onions. I just added a bit more of each. also, I halved it and it still will serve 4 to 6 people a decent sized serving. I didn't use the dressing it called for but I used very little of the Kraft dressing so I would have to say that as written, the dressing it called for would be sufficient. The tomato juices moisten the bread some too. I think next time I will use cherry tomatoes sliced in half though to cut back on the tomato juice. This time I used Roma tomatoes.

I couldn't get enough of it!!! And I halved the recipe but it was still so much that I shared with my neighbor (and now I'm printing it out for him, too! He loved it!). Make sure you seed the tomatoes, in my opinion. Also, I toasted my bread since it was fresh and I wish I had toasted it just slightly longer. 350 degrees on a cookie sheet, sliced about 1/2" thick for about 8 or 9 minutes would be perfect to me.

I totally agree with the others who said this was not enough dressing, the bread isn't suppose to be soggy, but with the little amount of dressing this recipe called for it left the bread way to crunchy. I added KRAFT's Greek Vinagrette dressing and added feta cheese. What a HUGE hit this recipe with all my guests!!

Tastes like bruschetta you eat with a fork -- what a novel idea! I had a day-old baguette lying around, so I cut it into cubes and left them out on the counter all day (in an uncovered container), and the texture was perfect by the time I was ready to make dinner. I also used fresh cherry tomatoes and basil from the farmer's market. Highly recommend the cherry tomatoes! Cut in half, they're the perfect size. Also, PLEASE don't try to substitute dried basil for fresh. It's barely even the same dish without it! The dressing was good, but I subbed balsamic vinegar for red wine. I also added feta cheese. I'll definitely make this again.

Excellent refreshing salad!  I love the amount of basil that this calls for.  Unlike others, I found the dressing was the perfect amount.  I was tempted to make and add more, but once it was refrigerated for a bit, it was just right.  I actually used a loaf of french bread that I had bought Friday night, so waiting the day and a half to use it turned out to be the right consistency for this recipe, imo.  Not too fresh, not too stale/dry.  Thanks for posting!

I am giving this a three based on the ingredients, not the quantities. The amount of dressing for that much bread is totally wrong!  I think it best to make up a batch of Italian vinaigrette (recipe on here) and use that on the salad as needed.

we had this salad for the first time,it was very good. However, the store was out of fresh basil and so was I, so I just bought feta,basil,tomato cheese. I also used Italian seasoned croutons,and because my husband thinks you must have lettuce,I used romaine which worked great.Thanks for posting a great change of pace salad!!

Excellent!  I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried.  I added fresh spinach to add more nutrition. Also, I used white onion since I was out of red.  (I used the cider vinegar option versus red wine vinegar, and olive oil option versus vegetable oil.)  The dressing was delicious  =D

I added marinated mozzarella shaped in balls or cubes.  I also used a mix of cherry and pear tomatoes and cut them in half.  It was a hit.

I just love this. If you like tomatoes with dressing, you will absolutely love this. I have it for lunch, have it with dinner, bring it over to other people's houses for a side dish... it works for everything. The tomatoes go great with the bread and dressing.

Absolutely delicious!  My 18 year old son came home right after I made it--I had to ask him to stop picking away at it so we would have some left for dinner!  The only change I made was using Vidalia sweet onions, ad I didn't have any red onion in the house.  Definitely a keeper for the summer--and a great way to use summer tomatoes!

I made this salad for a Lenten lunch that was at our church today.  It didn't last long at all!  I didn't even get to try it but hubby said it was EXCELLENT and received many complements.  I did double the dressing, used asiago bread and also sprinkled some mozz cheese on top.  I was going to add black olives but forgot.

Very easy and flavorful as is.  Second time, I used Asiago bread.  Yummy addition.  I also made the dressing later and just used it to marinate veggies.  It was great.

Not since Kuletos in San Francisco have I had a bread salad this good.  Key to my success was heirloom tomatoes (a must in my estimation).  I added an avocado which added great taste and texture.  I bought an artisan loaf of Pugliese bread, sliced and toasted it for the salad bread, then used the rest to accompany my dinner entree.  Guests asked for the recipe on the spot.  When I forgot to supply, they emailed a reminder :-)

I didn't have day old bread, so I toasted french bread.
Still ended up soggy.
Will try day old bread next time. It was delicious!

Really good salad.  I didn't follow measurements exactly, tweaked it to the amounts that I had.  I did lightly toast the bread first, but would have liked it either way.

I really enjoyed this salad! I used toasted garlic bread cubes instead of Italian, and dried basil instead of fresh. Nice amount of dressing and the bread just softened up a little. Next time I will cube everything smaller, so I can get a little ingrediant with every bite.I am bringing this to the next family BBQ!

I had this salad at a local restuarant & thought it was wonderful.  I made my salad with an italian cheese bread.  That was the only change that I made.  Incredible recipe. Thanks!

This salad was fabulous! Wouldn't change a thing, except for maybe a little more garlic... because I like garlic. I would also agree to cube things smaller, as the sliced tomatoes were a little big for the bread. We didn't toast the bread, though, and it was DELISH- not too soggy at all. Yum!!!

Wow, I loved this! I had leftover Sourdough Garlic Bread & decided that would be great in this. It was pretty stale & crunchy so mine didn't get too mushy. My tomato was out of this world good too. Yummy!

I used sourdough bread because that's my favorite bread.  I loved it and so did my boyfriend!  I thought that it was enough dressing as well.

Light, fresh salad for summer! The fresh basil is a must. I also threw in some olives and added oregano and parsley to the dressing. If I had mozzarella balls on hand I would throw those in next time.

I served this at a family gathering and everyone loved it. Good in a time crunch as well. Based on what the other reviewers wrote, I doubled the dressing and increased the tomatoes to about 4 cups and the ratio was perfect. Not at all too oily. Great way to use up old bread from the bakery.
