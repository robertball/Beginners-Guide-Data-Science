This bread is really good.  I like the high fiber content.  My only changes were:  reduced white bread flour to 1 cup and added an extra 1/3 cup wheat flour.  I also added about 1 1/2 tsp of vital gluten.  The bread not only tastes great, it looks great, too!  Thanks for a great, high fiber recipe!

excellent! I added 2 tsps vital wheat gluten, and used the bread machine for the dough cycle and made rolls from the dough (let rise 45 minutes), absolutely amazing served with Honey! thank you so much for this recipe!

Great taste!  My bread machine doesn't work well, so I mixed the dough in my kitchen-aid mixer instead.  It is very hearty and dense...and I may try to add a bit more sugar, and some gluten next time so it will rise a little higher...to use for sandwiches.  This would also be terrific as mini-loaves baked free form (similar to what some of the steakhouse's serve).  Tasted great toasted with honey, too.  Thanks for sharing a really good and healthy bread recipe!

Very yummy! I used wheat bran instead of oat bran and unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and it came out great. Also used all whole wheat pastry flour instead of whole wheat and all-purpose and ground flaxseed (not sure if that is any different from flax seed meal).  It is a somewhat dense bread, but it melts in your mouth; it's not dry at all. I had it with soup the night I made it, and then the next morning I had it again as toast. Delicious! I will be making this one again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  I followed the ingredients exactly and it came out very good-very soft in the inside.  The outside is alittle "hard" but not too bad.
This bread tasted great with honey alone or with a chicken sandwich.  Thanks!

Way too dry as is. Needed more gluten and about 3/4 cup more water.

This would make a good english muffin bread.  It raised very little and think that gluten  would have have helped it to raise rather than stay dense.  Also felt it needed more salt.  But it was still good toasted with a little butter and jam or honey.

I ignored the directions and made this start to finish in my breadmachine.(on whole wheat setting)  Although I added 1 1/2 tsp vital gluten, it did not rise much.
The top looks rough and the bread is very dense.
It does need more salt and it doesn't have much flavor. I hope that it will make yummy toast!
