This bread is really good. I made a few changes, because I know what I like in a quick bread. I like it to be really moist and I find that the recipes with sour cream in them are best acomplished in this way, so I added 1 cup sour cream. I was also concerned with it not being chocolatey enough, so I added a few tablespoons of cocoa to the dry ingredients. I also added extra chocolate chips. I also did what other reviewers suggest, and add the choc chips to the dry ingredients so they don't sink and it worked well. I added a little more zucchini also. And seriously, this is the absolute best bread I've put zucchini into ever! And I've been making different zucchini bread recipes all week. (I have a ton of zucchini in my garden). With the changes I made, I would consider it about perfect! I'll make it again and again. You would never know it had zucchini in it. It's perfectly moist and delicious. Like a rich chocolate cake. Just wonderful!

This bread is a wonderful, chocolatey treat.  The texture is very moist.  My only suggestions are:  1) thoroughly grease the pans, 2) use mini chocolate chips in the recipe, and 3) let the loaves cool at least 10 minutes before you try to remove them from the pan.

My family gobbled this up - I went through four loaves this weekend.
Flour the choc chips first to keep them from sinking and grease your pans well or the bread will stick. This is SO GOOD!

Nice bread. My husband had no idea it was zucchini bread, when I told him he was like ‘NO WAY’ I don’t know if that’s good or bad, either way it’s very good bread. Reading the reviews is very helpful because I had no unsweetened chocolate at home and I searched the reviews if someone had used something other then that, and I finally found people who used cocoa. Turned out great, 3 tablespoon of cocoa and 1 tablespoon of butter per square.

This bread was delicious and very moist.  It got better the second day, even moister!  I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of two, I used half whole wheat flour and half white, and replaced half the oil with applesauce.  I used mini chocolate chips and didn't have any problems with sinkage.  I will definitly make again!

This recipe is total crowd pleaser! I made mini loaves to give as gifts (they freeze well). Bake mini loaves for about 20 minutes.  I also made this into an 8" layer cake and frosted with butter cream frosting and it was a hit at a neighborhood get-together!  The cake took about 40-45 minutes.

Truly wonderful! I've baked this several times now -- though without the chips so far. I used a single bundt pan instead of two loaf pans and extended the baking time a bit. This even works with double the amount of zucchini (or a combination of zuke with grated carrots, pureed apple, or mashed banana...). Really great bread -- more like cake!

Fantastic.  I actually used a large crookneck squash instead of zucchini. I also coated the chocolate chips (regular size) with flour and they did not sink, as others had indicated. I used whole wheat flour, but instead of 2 cups, used 1 3/4 cups as I find whole wheat flour tends to be heavier and take away from the moisture. With this recipe I will use the full 2 cups next time. I also used half white sugar and half turbinado (brown) sugar. Next time I will try using even more turbinado, and less white sugar.  I also used egg replacer with success.

I baked this bread using 3/4 cup oil and adding some extra chocolate chips.  I folded in the zucchini last to see if that would help chips from sinking to the bottom.  It did!  The bread was delicious!  As an added treat, I microwaved slices just long enough to soften chips and served with cool whip.

This "bread" is more like a huge, fudge-y (but still cake-y!), addictive brownie! I halved the recipe and used an extra half cup for grated zucchini, used half unsweetened apple sauce and half canola oil, used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract (probably over-kill, I know!) and added an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa powder. I also used two Hershey's "special dark" chocolate bars, chopped up, instead of the chocolate chips. Using chocolate bars instead of chocolate chips results in a much more melty chocolate-studded treat. They don't harden a lot after being baked so they're still "melty" days after! 

I LOVE vegetables but this is seriously the most decadent, delicious way to enjoy zucchini!

Very moist and tasty. The chocolate flavour isn't overwhelming so you can still taste the zukes.

Flavor was great, no one knew it had zucchini in it! I substituted 1/2 c of cocoa for the squares; and added another cup of zucchini, it worked.  To help it rise more, I added 1 tsp of baking powder and some vital gluten...raised better for the 2nd batch. I also greased the pans with butter and sugared the bottom of the pans.  NOTHING stuck.  Will DEFINATELY make again. Even my picky grandchildren ate it without question 2 thumbs up!

A tip: grease your loaf pans beyond what you think is necessary; I greased mine well and the bread still stuck to the bottom.   Overall this recipe isn't bad. Using the correct size pans, and knowing my oven temperature is correct, each loaf turned out to be about one inch tall on the sides and about two inches tall in the middle, which means that they are rather flat. I could have put all of the batter into one loaf pan, which I think I'll do next time. The bread is too sweet, and I have a massive sweet tooth, but the texture is fantastic. It is basically a chocolate cake, with an invisible zucchini surprise, and that's fine by me! All of my chocolate chips sank, despite adding a flour coat. If I were to make this again, I'd drastically reduce the sugar (I'd start out with one cup and see where that got me), and either use smaller loaf pans or one large one. Another thing: my loaves were finished at 50 minutes, so check yours before the time is up to make sure they don't burn.

I very rarely give my opinion to these, I normally just search and print and save to my box if I like.  Well!!!!! This recipe is perfect - wouldn't change a thing and so light and fluffy! Just a note - i was on my way to vacation and I had just dropped off 1/2 to one neighbor and 1/2 to another - while on my way, both called me on my cell phone and wanted the recipe immediately.  Make and you will be the hit of the party!

I have made this recipe many times and everyone always asks me for the recipe.  This is a great way of using the zucchini from the garden and getting your chocolate fix.  The only change I make is to use a full cup of chocolate chips.  I drain the grated zucchini and squeeze it in a towel before adding it to the batter.   Also, as zucchini bread is moist, I grease the bread pans and then line with parchment paper, grease again and then flour to avoid sticking.

This recipe turned out well.  I used 6 TBS of cocoa and 2 TBS of shortening because I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate.  I also cut the oil in half and replaced it with no sugar added applesauce.  As far as it sticking, I sprayed with butter and flour spray and added parchment to the bottom, and it didn't stick at all.  Some people may be having a sticking problem because the chips tend to sink to the bottom.  If you mix the chips with just a little flour before adding them to the batter, they will not sink as much.

Now this is some good stuff!  I used mini chocolate chips and they worked great, no sinkage.  I did use the suggestion of 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown. The bread tasted great! I made one loaf and six large muffins with the remaining batter...sooooo good!

This was an awesome recipe.  I cut the sugar by 1 cup, added 1/2c of applesauce and 1/2 of oil, and I added walnuts.  I also lined my loaf pans with parchment paper.  All this to cut fat. And believe or not it was still very tasty and moist!!

Excellent! I made 5 mini loaves and 8 mini muffins. Mini chocolate chips were perfect in this recipe. Make sure and let your loaves cool completely before removing from the loaf pans :)

This is an awesome recipe of its kind!  I made a few revisions as follows:  1/2 c oil and 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce, 6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa, 2 tablespoons butter, 2 1/2 c zucchini, omitted the unsweetened chocolate, used 1 c of chocolate chips, and coated the chocolate chips with flour to prevent them from sinking.  Thanks to Diane for such a wonderful recipe!

Tastes almost as good as chocolate cake.  Very moist and my kids love it! I took someones advice and added 1/2 cup sour cream and also replaced 1/2 the white flour with whole wheat. I also use applesauce instead of oil.  I also just used 1/2 cup cocoa powder instead of the squares.

Everyone loves this bread--even those who are supposedly NOT zucchini bread fans can't believe how tasty this recipe is!  I usually don't have unsweetened chocolate squares on hand, so I use a total of 6 T cocoa powder and 3 T melted butter in the recipe.   I have also added more zucchini to the recipe (which just makes the bread more moist) and substituted applesauce for half (or more) of the oil.  This is a "keeper" recipe I make over and over, and a wonderful way to use all the excess garden zucchini!

Made this as per recipe, made one loaf and twelve muffins.  The loaf stuck to the bottom of the pan despite being well-greased.  The muffins came out perfect though and when I make this recipe again, I will make all muffins.  Very good flavor, everyone really loved the muffins.

These are pretty good.  I used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  The recipe makes about 24 regular muffins.  The baking time is about 17-18 minutes.  These are better the next day.  Enjoy!

Very good and moist.  The melted chocolate was speckled so I recommend stirring it in before adding the zucchini (which was cold).  I peeled the zucchini to avoid the "green" look and grated it fine, so hardly detectable.  My chips sank to the bottom, as the batter is rather thin.  Smaller chips would work better.  But overall, delicous and will definitely make it again!

This is so YUMMY and easy!!  I did use 1/3 cup of applesauce to replace some of the oil.  I also followed the other reviewers suggestions to stir in the zucchini at the end of mixing.  My choc. chips did not sink to the bottom!  I used a 9x13 pan and baked for 30 min.  I told my girls that it was brownies. I can hardly keep them out of it!!  Thanks for the delicious snack recipe.

AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!! This replaces my "usual" chocolate zuchini bread recipe.  It was so moist and just delicious. The kids ate it like CRAZY!! Next time I'm going to replace 1/2 cup of the oil with applesauce to make it a bit healthier.  You HAVE to try this!!

This is the best I'm on my 6th loaf in 6 days. Have 2 in the oven right now. Took suggestions of one review substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 cup of oil, also decreased sugar to 1.5 cups. See photo.

Loved this recipe. Very moist and delicious! I did modify a bit, I added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of 1. Also, I didn't have unsweetened chocolate squares so I used 6 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder and 2 tablespoons of oil which equals the 2 ounces squares. Fantastic!

Lovely!

Here are my changes:
* used half whole wheat flour, half all purpose
* replaced 3/4 of the oil with applesauce
* added a couple of TBL cocoa powder (to hide more of the zucchini from my daughters!)
* used mini chips and floured tham as suggested by another reviewer

* baked in a mini muffin pan for about 20-25 minutes

They taste wonderful!

This is fabulous!! If you like chocolate cake you will LOVE LOVE LOVE this bread! It is super moist, and doesn't need any extra sour cream, oil or apple sauce. It is perfect just as is. I did add mini chocolate chips however, as the regular chips were a bit much. As other reviews had specified....grease your pans well and let the bread sit at least 20 minutes after removing from the oven. I run a knife around the entire bread prior to removing from the pans. Please wait, because if you try to remove this bread from the pans while it is still hot, it might stick and  break apart. I am totally addicted to this bread!!!! YUM!

My mom has always said to try a recipe as it's written before making any changes to it.  I followed her advice and this bread turned out wonderfully!  I guess if I'm truthful, I DID change one thing.  I used mini morsels instead of regular (but I don't think that's a big enough change to count).  It was perfectly moist, perfectly chocolatey, perfectly delicious!

A great recipe. My fiance has been a zucchini kick lately so I decided to whip this up for him and he LOVED it. The only things I changed was I added more chocolate (1.5 oz of the unsweetened and 1 cup of the chips) and I used Splenda instead of sugar (only need 1 cup). Definitely toss the chips in the flour mixture before adding to the wet mixture. It keeps them from sinking to the bottom of the bread during baking. Also, keep an eye on it around 50minutes b/c mine was done in under the suggested 60-70minutes. The bread came out very moist and was a huge hit. Overall a great recipe. I will definitely be making this again.

I used 1/4 c. unsweetened cocoa powder in place of the chocolate squares, tured out just fine. This was a delicious bread recipe! Loved it.

I have made this probably 4 times within the last 2 weeks (which makes a total of 8 loafs!) and it goes as fast as I make it.  Co-workers fight over the last piece!  The only thing I did different was melted the unsweetened chocolate and the semi sweet chips together, then mix them in as a last ingredient.  That way you don't chunks at the bottom of your loaf.

Very good!  I have made this a few times with great results, but I didn't use unsweetened chocolate squares.  I substituted 3 Tab. cocoa, 2 tsp. sugar and 1 Tab. oil for one ounce of chocolate (so for this recipe, you double that formula), and it worked out fine.  Also, I used the suggestion of one of the reviewers to fold in the zucchini last, and the chocolate chips didn't all sink to the bottom.  Love this recipe!  Definitely a keeper!

Pretty good.  I prefer my bread to be a little more fudgy (like a brownie) but this was still an excellent recipe. Don't skip the extra chocolate chips!

I followd the recommendations from Missy and this was awesome...plus, I also made a couple more changes.  I used half white and half whole wheat flour (that's all I had), and my chocolate squares were semi-sweet instead of unsweetened.  I upped the chocolate chips to 1 cup and also added about 2 Tb. of cocoa powder to dry ingredients (mixing the chips in with the dry so they wouldn't sink).  I threw in a cup of sour cream also, which I feel really made it more moist (though I can't say for sure, having never tasted it without).  I baked in two mini loaf pans, and had enough batter leftover to make 9 large muffins (which I baked separately for much less time).  I added chopped walnuts to half of what I was making and did the rest without; I prefer nuts.  This is a great recipe and I look really forward to sharing it!!!  Thank you!

Without a doubt the best zucchini bread recipe I have found in 30 years. I did not have unsweetened chocolate in the pantry, so I used 6  Tablespoons of cocoa and 2 Tablespoons of canola oil in its place. I also used mini chocolate chips. This is so moist, almost like a lovely dense cake.

Very Yummy! I didn't have chocolate chips so I melted cocoa powder on the stove with some butter and it turned out great (didn't really need any extra sugar in the chocolate) the recipe called for enough sugar!
Instead of making 2 loves I made one bundt cake and we all enjoyed it!

Thanks!

This was soooooo good!  It's more cake than bread like and the flavors meld so well together. I wasn't sure about the zuchinni and chocolate combo, but wow!!  My husband and especially my 5yr old loved this!  It was gone in two days. I definately recommend making this, though I wish I knew a way to keep the chocolate chips from sinking to the bottom of my batter. Any suggestions???  Thanks!

This recipe is excellent and I made it even better with a few alterations. I didn't have baking chocolate so I used 3 T cocoa and 3 T Black Cocoa powder plus 2 T oil. I reduced the sugar to only 1 cup and used only 3/4 cup oil. The lower sugar lets the chocolate really stand out but not be bitter. If you're a chocoholic you will love it. 1/12 of a loaf is 5 points on weight watchers.

This was such a delicious way to use up my zucchinis! I goofed and only used 1 oz of chocolate but it still turned out amazingly yummy - I'm sure if I had used 2 oz it would have been even better! My husband and I gobbled both the loaves up within 3 days!

Thank you for the advice from previous reviewers.  Following suggestions I subbed applesauce for half the oil, also 3T cocoa and 1 T butter per square of unsweetened chocolate.  I also coated the chocolate chips with the dry ingredients before stirring in and they stayed evenly throughout the loaf.

This is my favorite recipe for chocolate zucchini bread. My tricks for success are to use mini chocolate chips instead of regular sized & also to line the bottom of the loaf pans with parchment paper, then spray pan with non-stick cooking spray. They come out beautifully every time!

This makes a wonderfully moist cake - I really like it a lot.  The batter was pretty thin, so I added an extra half-cup of flour.  The cake still rose up great, but the chocolate chips all dropped to the bottom.  Perhaps I shall try squeezing some liquid from the grated zucchini next time. Thanks for the recipe!

I increased the unsweetened chocolate to 3 squares, used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar, added a 1/2 cup of coco powder, and a half cup of sour cream as a previous reviewer suggested. I left out the cinnamon becasue I just wanted it nice and chocolaty without the spice, and increased the chocolate chips to a full cup. Yum!

Very, very good, more like a cake than a bread!  I followed other reviewer suggestions and cut back on sugar to 1-1/2 cups.  I also used semi-sweet chocolate squares and I added about 3 Tbs of unsweetened cocoa powder and 1/2 tsp of baking powder to get more of a rise.  Just mix the mini chips with the dry and they DON'T SINK.  You MUST let it cool in the pan; I sprayed mine with Bakers Secret and did it in a glass pan and a metal pan, they both slipped right out.  I drizzled with powder sugar icing (just powder sugar and milk) and it was RAVED over.  Thank you for sharing!

Delicious! Well, I admit I made a few changes (1 1/2 cup of sugar and only 3/4 cup of vegetable oil), but besides that, I stuck to the directions and it turned out really good!  I should have read the review where it said let it cool in the loaf pan, because I tried removing it right away and now my bread looks kind of very broken, so let it cool down befor removing!

To begin with the bread turned out to be awesome, super moist and as my daughter put it divine.  The only thing i changed (intentionally) was that I reduced the sugar to 1 and half cup.  The other change (unintentional - because my six year old was in charge of reading was that ..he skipped the 2 squares unsweetened chocolate part so what happened was I used 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips, melted it and used it in the recipe. It was still awesome. I also added some walnuts.

Fabulous!  I made a few changes, though.  I used 3 cups zucchini, I cut the oil back to 1/2 and added 1/2 cup apple sauce.  I also cut back a bit on the sugar.  I added 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar for a total of 1 and 1/2 cups instead of 2.  The last change I made was to add 3 teaspoons cinnamon instead of just one.  My son loves to help make this and thinks the zucchini just "melts away".  We will be making this again and again.

Delicious, but had problems. Batter was too thin and all the chocolate chips went to the bottom. The loaves were barely 2 inches tall and stuck horribly to the bottom due to the mass off melted chocolate chips on th bottom.

Had some zucchini on hand that I had bought to make a Weight Watchers soup recipe, but after a day on the diet, decided to scrap the whole thing and found this yummy chocolate zucchini bread recipe to use up the zucchini instead. This is so delicious and so full of chocolate, you can't even tell there is zucchini in it.

Very good.  I sometimes use applesauce instead of oil.  Also, I have found that the melted chocolate can be a bit tricky to stir into the mixture (it hardens on the spoon, spatula, etc.  I add the oil (or applesauce) to the chocolate before mixing into the rest, and it works quite well.

Fantastic...I made it exactly as written and we loved it! Next time I will probably try using 1/2 applesauce for 1/2 of the oil. I usually try a recipe exactly as written the first time, before making any of my own substitutions. Thanks for a keeper.

this is the best tasting chocolate zucchini bread recipe I have here. BUT I have to say (for me) this made 2 tiny loafs. So either smaller pans or get 1 big loaf (9X5).

BREADMACHINE VERSION!! I made 1/2 the recipe, with half whole wheat, half all-purpose flour, half oil, half applesauce, added 2 T unsweetened cocoa powder, 1/4 t baking powder, and omitted the  cinnamon.  I used the quick bread setting on the breadmaker and added the floured mini chips during the last minute of mixing.  The results were sensational and I had the breadmaker in the garage so I didn't have to compete with the air conditioner on a hot summer day.  I'm hooked on this recipe.

Great recipe!  I made a few changes based on healthier substitutions and a veggie-hater 7 year old:  Reduce oil to 1/2 C. and use olive oil instead.  Add 1/2 c. applesauce.  I peeled the zucchini and then pureed it, and  just drained the little bit of liquid after it sat for a minute (I puree it so that my son can't detect the little pieces of zucchini throughout the bread).  Add 1/4 C. cocoa powder for a deeper chocolate color and flavor.  This bread comes out very moist.
I baked 5 mini loaves for 40 mins.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and lined the bottoms of the pans with parchment paper.  My son calls this his favorite chocolate cake!

Really good zucchini bread recipe.  Very moist and the bites of chocolate morsels are an added treat.  Had students in my Foods and Nutrition classes make these in mini (5x3-inch) pans.  This recipe will yield 5 mini loaves.  Remember to cut back on the baking time  approximately 15 minutes.

This was such a hit!  I split it between a loaf and muffins and put a few chocolate chips on top of the muffins- which was a big hit!  people couldn't believe that there was zucchini inside!  I was initially nervous because the batter was a bit thin, but it turned out perfectly!

Absolutely the best!  I have been making this for two years and everyone LOVES it.  I use 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown, substitute canola oil and use 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat.  The rest of my family is not health conscious at all and they still love it, kids included.  The best!

THIS WAS PROBABLY THE MOISTEST,CHOCOLATY, EASIEST "BREAD" I HAVE MADE IN A LONG TIME!!! AND I AM AN AVID COOK. I LOVE TO ADD A LITTLE ESPRESSO WHEN MAKING A CHOCOLATE ITEM----(IT'S KIND OF LIKE PREFERRING DARK CHOCOLATE---ADDING THE ESPRESSO JUST INTENSIFIES THE CHOCOLATE FLAVOR) SO I DID ADD 1 TBL OF INSTANT ESPRESSO GRANULES.  VERY INTENSE & SCRUMPTIOUS CHOCOLATE FLAVOR. I ALSO USED 2 - 8.25" PANS INSTEAD OF THE 9X5 LOAF PANS TO MAKE FOR HIGHER RAISING BREADS. THE SUGGESTION OF MINI MORSELS WAS A GOOD ONE AND I SHOOK IT UP A LITTLE MORE BY ADDING 3/4 CUP OF WALNUTS, AND 1/2 CUP OF RAISINS. IT WAS TO DIE FOR!
***REVISED 8.5.10......THE BEST FOR 4 YRS OF BAKING IT.

This was delicious and very moist.  I made it into muffins--it made 24.  I thought the batter was too runny, but it tasted great.  Didn't look great as muffins, so they didn't go fast at a potluck, but my family enjoyed them and I will probably make as bread (for presentation) if I'm feeding them to anyone else, next time.  About 25 minutes at 350 for the muffins--so that was a faster route.  Yum!  Thanks.

This recipe makes a fantastic chocolate loaf!  I make this all summer long until my zucchini plant gives out.  I add one cup of frozen Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips just before putting into the oven; they don't melt and they don't sink to the bottom of the pan.  Great recipe!!  Thank you so much for sharing this one.

Delicious & so moist!  I substituted 1 cup of applesauce for the oil & you would never know.  I made 4 small loafs rather than 2 larger ones, it took approximately 40 minutes to bake them.

Great bread!  I substituted 6 tblsp cocoa for the unsweetend chocolate. To make this lower in fat I substituted 2/3 c applesauce & 1/3 c oil for the 1 c.oil.  I changed the 2 c. sugar to 1 1/2 c. sugar & 1/2 c.splenda.  I baked it for 45 min.

Awesome, awesome, awesome!  I can't rave about this bread enough.  Everyone that has tried it loves it.  I substitute 2/3 c. applesauce and 1/3 c. oil for the 1 cup of oil called for...the bread is healthier and tastes fantastic!

Awesome!  Like MommyMichelle, I subbed 6 tbsp. cocoa, 4 tsp. white sugar, and 2 tbsp. oil (total) for the baking chocolate.  I also folded in the zucchini last, and I experienced no chocolate chip sinkage.  :-)  Not exactly a health food, and was gone in about six minutes flat.

This is a great recipe.  However, I have made it twice now and the chocolate chips always seem to fall to the bottom of the loaf and stick to the pan.  So next time I make it I am going to use the mini-chocolate chips and see if that helps.  Otherwise, it was great!

Oh my gosh!!!!!!!  I did this one for some girlfriends at a makeup show.  We all loved it.  Our kids all loved it.  The thing is, I think I forgot to put in the oil and it was still so moist!  Everyone wanted the recipe, even my mom!  Thanks to Diane for sharing this one!

Excellent recipe for us "chocoholics"!  I adjusted/substituted the oil ingredient.  I used 3/4 cup of Smucker's "Baking Healthy" (oil & shortening replacement for baking)and 1/4 cup vegetable oil.  Excellent results were obtained while reducing some of the fat content.  Will definitely freeze lots of shredded zucchini in 2 cup bags for winter baking.

So, so yummy.  It's great as written, but I have tweaked it to our liking.  I use much more chocolate because we LOVE chocolate.  Three ounces of unsweetened chocolate, 2 TBS cocoa powder added to the dry ingredients, and a full cup of chocolate chips.  And I have very strong cinnamon, so I only use a half tsp.  It also works well when I use 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat.  Have also replaced half the oil with applesauce.  The whole family loves this treat!

made for second time this week.  more like a choc. cake - very yummy.  few changes I made: didn't measure zucchini just used what I had, so more like 3 cups; cut sugar to about one and a half cups; added a couple of spoonfulls of cocoa powder - this gave it a deep choc. taste; added a few spoonfulls of sour cream  - this made it super moist.  baked in Wilton Brand Pans (these are great, heavy duty and no stick), so a quick spray with Pam and they didn't stick at all.  had only 1 loaf pan so put the rest into mini muffin pan (these cooked in 10 minutes).  oh, used whole wheat flour as that is what I had on hand.  (you can see i'm not big on exact measuring, this came out great both times! seems to be a very forgiving recipe, don't think you can mess it up)

This is such a nice recipe...though I did use 2 cups of brown sugar instead of the white and used 3 cups of grated zucchini.  And I had to use 6 TBSP of cocoa powder  & 2 TBSP butter to replace the chocolate squares since I didn't have it on-hand.  The recipe made 24 muffins - for easy lunch packing for my boys.   The kids loved them!  What a great way to use up zucchini.  Thanks for the recipe Diane.

How can you not LOVE this. Absolutely amazing and I will be making this again very soon. Pumpkin bread used to be my fav. bread but this just took first place! I barely changed the recipe. I added 1 1/2 overriped bananas and WOW am I ever happy I did. Recipe would have been great without it but if you ever get a chance add the banana is adds a little extra something. For those baking with Zucchini for the first time you MUST squeeze the shredded zucchini dry or the loaf will be too moist.

I made the original recipe, using baking cocoa since I didn't have squares, less sugar  and it it was delicious.  I use it now using organic ingredients and mini chocolate chips and it tastes even better. Again, I always put less sugar.

If I had rated this the day I made it I would have given it 4 stars but probably not made it again.  I could taste the zucchini in it for sure.  I like zucchini bread but to me it seemed you should make either zucchini bread or chocolate loaf not combine the two.  However the next day it was more moist and chocolately and i could not taste the zucchini as much.  Initially I did not like the idea of two smaller loaves but now I think thats a good idea it slowed me down somewhat.   The only changes I made were 1.5 cups of sugar and it was plenty sweet and half applesauce half oil.  Very good will make it again for sure just leave it to cure first.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I used about 1/4 cup cocoa with dry ingredients, in addition to the recipe as written, just cause I LOVE chocolate.  This is to die for.  I used my silicone loaf pan (on a baking sheet for stability), still greased and floured, because I always end up with 1/2 stuck in pan, no matter what I do.  The silicone worked great, no sticking.  This is more like a yummy moist brownie.  Nobody needs to know that there is zucchini in it, you can't even tell.  I still have a ton of zucchini left over, so this is gonna be made a gazillion more times.  Thank you, Diane, for this amazing recipe!

Totally yummy. I put the chocolate chips on top instead of mixing them in. Made a sort of crunchy chocolate top... yum! Also, it took about 20 extra minutes to bake, and my oven doesn't tend to have that problem, so just heads up.

So good!!!! I love zucchini bread and i love chocolate. Together is perfect match.  My kids kept calling them brownies. I made a few changes. Didnt realize i had less then 2cups of flour on hand. so i did half flour and half whole wheat flour.  didnt have chocolate squares so i used cocoa powder but only one ounce with 1 teas of oil. it was plenty of chocolate.  and i only used 3/4 cup of oil and 4 tbsp of melted butter. and then i used 1/2cup of ricotta cheese.  Mmmmm so good! thanks

Very good.  People at work loved it.  I did modify it and replaced the oil with applesauce to make it low fat and in doing so it was too sticky.  Also follow the baking times as I thought it was done 15min before the stated time and it really need the extra time.

I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate squares so I used cocoa powder instead. I also used half brown/half white sugar. The texture of the bread was great! However I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought it could use some more spice. Next time I will add an additional tsp. or more of cinnamon.

Wonderful moist and decadent!   I added a third cup of cocoa to the mix as I love chocolate but it is great as is.  I have made it in two loaf pans or in a 9 by 13 pan.   Great recipe!! =)

Yummy!  More of a cake than a bread - very moist and rich.  I did the half applesauce, half oil thing, and added about 3 TBSP of cocoa powder to the dry ingredients.  I baked all the batter in one 9x13 pan, as my bread pan was occupied.  Since the batter is spread thinner, it doesn't take as long to bake through - I took it out after about 45 minutes.  Use a toothpick to check for done-ness.

I made into muffins, which were really more like cupcakes, with cream cheese frosting. Very rich and delicious. You would never know there was zucchini in them. I did not have unsweetened chocolate so I substituted 3 tablespoons cocoa powder & 1 tablespoon butter for each square of chocolate in the recipe. Worked perfectly.

This was the first time I made zucchini bread so i was grateful the recipe was easy to follow. The only change I made was adding the chocolate chips with the flour mixture like some others recommended. I'll definitely be making this again - the end result is delicious!

Succulent or rather "zucculent"! Very moist and flavorful bread, especially the day after. Like many people, I tinkered with it slightly. For my 24 servings, I used two packets of Truvia (stevia) instead of 2 cups of sugar. It turned out super and there is NO difference in taste between substiting the stevia for sugar. The Truvia website says the exchange rate is 1 packet for 1 cup sugar. There is a different exchange for liquid stevia. Also, it was mentioned that stevia reduces calories by 30%...I'll take it.     You lose a little bulk from not having the sugar so, I used aprrox. 1/4 cup  salted sunflowers as media and did not add the recipe amount of salt.   Yum. Yum. Happy baking!

We made muffins for a preschool snack.  We doubled the chocolate chips and substituted 1 cup organic unsweetened applesauce for the oil.  The cooking time was reduced to 30 minutes in a convection oven until toothpick from the center came out clean.  The recipe yields 24 regular sized muffins and I ran out of muffin cups so we used the leftover batter to make 18 mini muffins too.  They actually are so chocolatey they taste like cupcakes.  We plan on using a cream cheese icing on the tops.  My kids loved them!

Awesome way to sneak some veggies to the kiddos!!  As usual, I substituted like crazy.  But anything that I did would have only made it taste worse, and I thought it was incredible even after I sub'd it to death.  I used all whole wheat flour, I cut the oil to 1/4 cup & added 1 cup of applesauce.  Then I added 3 Tbsp of molasses & used raw sugar (which I cut to 1 1/2 cups).  Also, I didn't have squares of chocolate, so I sub'd 6 Tbsp of cocoa powder & added it to the dry ingredients.  So even after all of those healthnut changes, it turned out delicious.  And it's even better if you sprinkle some mini chocolate chips across the top of the loaf when you pull it out of the oven.  Mmmmmm...

I love this recipe and it's always a huge hit and parties/bake sales and brunches! I'm always asked for this recipe and people are amazed it's zucchini bread! 

I use more apple sauce with a little oil and it makes it moister and brings in a hint of flavor. Very tasty!

I just made this recipe, and it is very, very good.  The only changes I made were these:  I grated one rather large zucchini and didn't bother to measure it (it may have been 3 cups, who knows); I used a small container of applesauce (lunchbox size) and added oil to make 1 cup.  The batter was far more runny than some quickbreads I've made, but I didn't let that bother me.  I made 5 mini loaves and 1/2 pan of mini muffins, they took only 16 minutes on convection /bake and they were done.  I also used PAM baking spray (the kind with flour in it) and nothing at all stuck.

This was tasty but like others mentioned the bread stuck to the bottom of the pan.  I took the advice of other reviews and rolled the chocolate chips in the flour mixture first but it didn't help.  Be sure to heavily grease and flour the bottom of the pans.  I will make again but will be more careful next time.  I may even invest in non-stick loaf pans.

I didn't have any baking chocolate so I did the cocoa/butter thing and it worked out just fine. I also used egg substitute, 1/2 cup applesauce for half the oil (Canola), Splenda instead of sugar, a 1/2 cup more of the zucchini, and 1/2 cup of quick cooking oats to the recipe...still came out very moist.

I used a 9 inch square pan that I baked for 30 minutes in a convection toaster over and it came out beautiful!

Thanks for sharing this good for you chocolate recipe :-)

This was a great recipe- like a lot of other reviewers, I subbed out half the all purpose flour and vegetable oil for whole wheat flour and unsweetened applesauce. I also used the mini chips- they don't sink to the bottom like the bigger chips tend to. Used Pam for baking in my loaf pans and didn't have a problem with sticking. Thinking about using 2 Tbs of Nutella for the 2 squares of chocolate and cutting down the sugar next time I make this.

AMAZING! I used mini chocolate chips and they didn't sink. I also used 2 TBSP cocoa instead of the chocolate. I've made this in a bundt pan and sliced it thin, it was great. I also made them like cupcakes/muffins (no icing) and they were great!!

Great recipe!  I only used 1/2 the oil called for and the other 1/2 applesauce.  The whole family loved them, even my picky kids!

This recipe is delicious...even kids who won't even look at a green vegetable will eat this - just tell them it's chocolate "cake". I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion and added 2 T cocao powder to the recipe for more chocolate flavor. This bread is moist and a definate recipe you'll want to save.

I used 1/2 splenda/ 1/2 sugar and 1/2 cup apple sauce for 1/2 the oil with great success.  I coated my chocolate chips in the dry ingredients before adding and it was fantastic!  As stated, a big hit with the kiddos!

Marvelous!  I have made this twice in the last three days (I have alot of zucchini!), but will make more to freeze.  The first batch stuck to the bottom of the pan, so I floured the pan after I greased it.  I also added a small container of sour cream, which I think just made it richer - gilding the lily a bit!  Wonderful recipe - a great find!

This is very good if you want a strong chocolate flavor, the zucchini is not noticeable.  Mine turned out a bit dry.

What a great recipe:) It's really too sinfully good to include the word "zucchini" in its name. I made a slight change. The chocolate chips sunk to the bottom of the bowl of batter, (I didn't have enough loaf pans to cook all four...yes, I doubled the recipe.) Since I had a handful of morsels, (a 1/4 cup or so), remaining, I opened the oven & sprinkled them on the loaves, after they’d been in the oven 10-15 minutes. They submerged with a few dotting the top of the loaf, which created a rich little pocket. A chocolate surprise, if you will. My entire family, neighbors, and friends have received slices of this zucchini bread to try...and I have to tell you, it was an all and out hit! One more thing...I have no patience for grating, so I chopped, rather pulverized, the zucchini in a food processor. Big time saver. Also substituted whole wheat flour and egg substitute. 

My heartfelt thanks to the "chocolate Zucchini Bread's" contributor.

Sybil So Crazy
(But not from lack of chocolate!)

Absolutely delicious.  I made alterations to the recipe suggested by other reviewers - replaced half the oil with applesauce, used half whole wheat flour, and reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  I made one 9x5 loaf and 12 muffins.  I especially enjoyed the muffins!

This was really yummy.  After reading several reviews I made just a few changes.  I cut down the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and used applesauce (unsweetened) for 1/2 of the oil called for. Also I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate, but did have semi-sweet baking squares so I used those instead. I made one loaf of bread and one pan of muffins with this recipe and they were both terrific!!

Delicious! My family loved this. I used 6 TBSP of Cocoa instead of the chocolate squares and 1/2 tsp extra baking soda. This recipes made 8 mini loaves and 6 muffins which I baked for 30 minutes.

This is exactly what I wanted.  My mom used to make this recipe with fresh zucchini out of her garden.  She always used a square cake pan and iced it.  I remember she always had a pan of it in the freezer and when I came home from school I would put a slice in the microwave and it would come out so tastey!  If this bread comes out dry for you then you must have omitted the zucchini or did something wrong!!  Zucchini is wonderful in many dishes and is fantastic in cakes for the fact that it makes cakes moist, but doesn't really add any flavour!  Yup, my mom's recipe to a T with the hint of cinnamon and all!  Thank you!

This was delicious! I used several suggestions, including the 1/3 cup of applesauce in place of some of the oil and not including the skin of the zucchini for better disguise. I also substituted 3/4 c. of wheat flour for some of the regular flour and added 1 T. of wheat germ. I also only had semi-sweet chocolate squares, so I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and used the semi sweet chocolate squares. I also added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg. Make sure to grease your pans well, I only lightly sprayed and it stuck! Really loved the taste, will make again!

This recipe was great. I made it for my son's birthday cake. The only change I made was to melt the chocolate chips at the beginning with the other chocolate. This created a dense chocolate cake almost like a brownie. And the chocolate chips didn'e sink because they were melted!

This bread is TOO good.  My goal has been to put some away in the freezer for the holdays, but they never last. They are just too yummy and convenient to have around. It is great for morning coffee, for a Hostess gift, a snack... served warm with a scoop of French Vanilla ice cream, when company stops by, etc.

I made this bread for my aunt and  grandma who i live with and we all loved it!  I also had the problem of the choc chips floating to the bottom. maybe if you baked part way and then sprinkled them on? it's good sliced with a little cream cheese icing for dessert. yumm!

This is the best zucchini bread I've ever had.  I like a strong cinnamon flavor and I thought the chocolate might mask it.  But it actually enhanced the flavor and the cinnamon chocolate combo is asweome!  I make 4 mini loaves and just cut the baking time to 35 minutes and just kept my eye on it.  I will be making this recipie often.  Thanks for sharing!

This is the best way I found to get my kids to eat zucchini!  As with all zucchini bread recipes, it takes longer than you want to put it together, but once you do, it's worth it!  Everyone I've shared these with loves them!

I made mine into 12 muffins and a small loaf. I baked them 25 minutes. I also like to use mini chocolate chips. I used 1/2 c of applesauce/1/2 c of oil instead of all oil. I also used 3/4 c of cocoa blended into the oil instead of chocolate squares.

The chocolate flavor was perfect, and this turned out very moist.  However, the chocolate pieces, although I had mixed them with the dry ingredients, sunk to the bottom and stuck to the pan, making the whole loaf stick to the bottom when I tried to remove it.  Hence it was plated looking like a sunken mess.  Next time, I will cut a piece of parchment do the bottom of the pan before pouring in the batter.

This recipe is great! My kids even love it and they don't like anything with vegetables. They say it tastes like chocolate cake. I substitute 6 Tbsp. cocoa and 2 Tbsp. melted butter for the chocolate squares.

This recipe was excellent!  I added 1 cup of coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil.  I also used coconut palm sugar instead of white sugar.  It was a very easy recipe and very tasty.  This recipe is a keeper!

I've been making this for years now, and it needs no modification whatsoever!! It's very chocolaty and moist!! There's no need to add extra cocoa, or sour cream. It's absolutely fabulous as is and my favorite all-time recipe I've made from this site.

Very good! I think it has more of a cake consistency but I love it anyway, added some whole wheat flour and milled flax seed, big hit! Will keep to make again and again!

This recipe was really easy and tasty.  Even the 3year old enjoyed it.  I didn't have 2 loaf tins, so I made some muffins as well with the left over mixture.

This is a fantastic recipe.  It is easy and delicious.  We added pecans which floated to the top of the loaf and added a wonderful crunch.  I would highly recommend this recipe. Thanks!

Yummy!

Instead of eggs, I used 1 cup of unsweetened apple sauce with 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder.  Also cut back the oil to 3/4 cup.

The bread tastes great, you just NEED to really grease the pans good. Mine fell apart after trying to get them out and I thought I over-greased the pans.

This is recipe is delicious -- although calling it bread is deceptive.  It's much more like cake...yummy, yummy chocolate cake.  It sounds healthier if you call it bread.

Very moist and excellent!  I used bittersweet chocolate rather than unsweetened, and chopped the chips so they wouldn't sink.  Got rave reviews.

Amazing!!  I didn't have chocolate squares so I added 6 tbsp cocoa powder to the mix.  I also only used 1/2 cup oil and added 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce.  I baked them into muffins in about 22 minutes.  Wow...is all I can say.

This recipe is awesome!  It has been a great hit with family and friends, especially during the holidays.  My children love it too!  They couldn't believe they were eating zucchini!  I use the jumbo or regular sized chocolate chips and follow the recipe to a "T".  It's absolutely delicious!

I changed a few things in this recipe. I didn't want two loaves (my husband and I wouldn't be able to finish them), so I used 8 tablespoons Saco's cocoa powder, 2 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce, 1 egg, 1/2 cup oil, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup flour, 1 tsp. baking powder, 1 cup grated zucchini, 1 tsp vanilla, a dash of pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 tsp salt and a full cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips (we like chocolate at our house). This ended up very, very moist and soft with a deep chocolate flavor - I'm just not sure I liked the zucchini mixed in. I baked the batter in mini-loaf tins which makes it easy to grab on the go for a snack, or to give away as a gift.

SO GOOD!!!! It was almost fudgy in texture and taste.  The only variations I made were to use whole grain flour with a little regular flour mixed in (make it a little more nutritious) and an extra square of the melted chocolate.  I have never seen anything hoovered up so fast!

I made 8 loaves of Zucchini bread, with 4 different recipes and this one was my favorite. I wasn't sure about it to start with either because I'm not a huge chocolate fan.    I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. I used only 1/2 cup veg oil but added 1 cup applesauce.  I added a splash of nutmeg and ground cloves.   For the chocolate chips. I just left them until the end, after the batter was poured into pan and I spread them out over the top, some sank some didn't, but it was perfect that way.  I will definitely used this one again.

Very good!  I actually cut this recipe in half because I didn't have 2 loaf pans handy.  It worked just fine except my baking time was a little less.   I didn't have unsweetened chocolate, so like another reviewer I used 3 tablespoons cocoa plus 1 tablespoon melted Smart Balance and it worked just fine!  I used slightly less sugar ~3/4 cup or so and I used a little more zucchini as well.  I also added the mini chips to the flour mixture and they didn't all sink to the bottom.   The bread was moist and chocolately and we enjoyed it!  Thanks!!  : )

I have used this recipe for 3 years and love it! One thing I would suggest is that you spray the bottom of your pans well,the chocolate chips fall to the bottom and stick!  I also have added raisens and walnuts!

Wow, this was delicious!!!  It's already gone and we just made it last night!!  We added an extra square of chocolate and next time we might even add another for more chocolate flavor. Used the semisweet chocolate chunks--it's funny because my husband loves dark chocolate but he thought he'd like me to make it with milk chocolate next time.  I also think next time I'll leave out the cinnamon--no complaints about it, just was a little strong for me.  I used a little over 3 cups of zucchini and it all melted in the bread just fine :)  I'll be making this over and over and over and. . .again!!!  WONDERFUL!!!!!

So good and it freezes well too.  Tastes great with milk chocolate  chips.  You can cut the sugar to about 1 3/4 cups before you notice a difference.  Sometimes I use half whole wheat flour, and you can't even tell.

this was amazing!!!  I put the chocolate chips in with the dry mix which kept everyone suspended, and used cocoa powder mixed with oil in place of the squares.  My ricer worked great to get out the excess moisture.  Will definitely make again!

Not what I was hoping for. I followed the recipe and added some of the suggestions in the reviews, such as grease the pan twice as much as you think you need, add the choc. chips to the flour mixture, and adding sour cream. It stuck to the bottom and had a burnt kind of taste, even though I only baked it 40 minutes. (it was perfectly baked at that point) It looked good. I wanted this to tastesoooooooo good and it was just ok. Need to keep looking or tweaking. Sorry.

I made two very chocolately, very moist loaves with this recipe.  This bread is so good!  I used half oil and half applesauce instead of one cup oil and one cup of white flour plus one cup of whole wheat flour to make it a bit healthier.  I also used liquid egg whites instead of whole eggs.  Since I love chocolate, I added one cup of chocolate chips that I rolled in the flour before mixing in which kept them from sinking to the bottom.  This recipe is a definite keeper and will be used many times in the future!

We love this! Very moist and chocolatey. I took others advice and decreased the sugar to 1 1/4 cups, which was the perfect sweetness for us.  Also increased the zucchini to 5 cups...which didn't seem to affect it at all. I sprayed my pans LIBERALLY with Pam non-stick spray, let the loaves cool when done, and my loaves didn't stick to the pan one bit. I coated the choc chips with flour which helped them to not sink too much. It did seem a little oily, so next time I'll try a healthier version substituting applesauce for half of the oil, and spelt flour for half of the white flour. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I love this, with my attempt to make it healthier.  I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce, one of the cups of flour was whole wheat and I used only one cup of sugar.  I did add a few extra chocolate chips and a couple Tbls. of cocoa.  Oh, one tsp. of almond extract really changes the flavor.  I put it all into one loaf pan, and watched carefully so I didn't overcook.  We all love it - even my little ones.

I love making this recipe for my family. It satisfies my chocoholic husband and is so moist thanks to the zucchini. I also floured the chocolate chips to prevent sinking every time I've made it.

This was awesome. I've never made Zucchini Bread before! I replaced the oil with unsweetened apple sauce and replaced the solid chocolate with 3 tablespoons of cocoa.  I'll definitely be making this one again!!

I found this bread to be a little bit too dense and heavy, but the flavour was nice.  As another reviewer mentioned, the chocolate squares can be replaced by 6 Tbsp of cocoa and 2 Tbsp of butter - if you do this, however, I recommend mixing them into the batter separately or you may end up with chunks of unsweetened chocolate in the cake.

I was a bit unsure about combining chocolate and zucchini but man, this recipe changed my mind, it was so delicious. I don't like loaf shapes so I made a bundt instead, and everyone loved it!

This bread was moist and had an ok chocolate flavor, but, wasn't what I was looking for in a zucchini bread.  It didn't have the "zucchini bread flavor" I was looking for and it wasn't quite rich and chocolaty enough for a chocolate bread.  It just wasn't suited for our taste.

Very good bread. I wish I should have listened to some of the reviews. I used pam spray inside the loaf pan but that wasn't enough. My bread stuck to the bottom of the pan. That was party because I didn't wait until the loafs were cooled. I tried to remove them right away to cool off quicker. It was a BIG mistake. My kids who loath Zucchini loved it. They still ate it even after I told them Zukes were in it.

It's not quite zucchini bread and not quite chocolate bread. It tries to be too many things at once and does neither very well. It's good and moist and chocolatey--just not the best and not what I was looking for.

Awesome recipe,  great for the end of summer zucchinis from the garden! I gave a loaf to two friends and both raved about it and asked for the recipe! I used mini-chips, and DO be sure to grease loaf pans well! Yum Yum.

I rated it a 5 for taste because it  is orgasmic!!! BUT I have had trouble getting it out of the well-greased baking pans(This is maddening).  The first time I made it I used Pam Baking Spray and had no trouble but have made the recipe twice since then and was especially careful about the greasing (I was out of Pam Baking Spray-with theflour) and still had trouble.  I will never make it again without Pam.  It did occur to me though that I could try using some of the flour from the recipe to coat the chocolate chips so they don't sink to the bottom . The chips caused the sticking problem I think.

Made this delicious bread this past weekend. It was gone within a few hours. Plan to bake again this week. Will grease & flour the pans so it won't stick to the bottom. Might add nuts also. Very good! A little suggestion as a follow-up: I have found that if I melt the chocolate squares in the microwave, the chocolate hardens into small bits when added to the batter, thus the bread does not have the "chocolate" look.  This doesn't happen when I melt it on the stove. Keep that in mind.

Fantastic! Made as written, no changes. Shredded the zucchini in food processor, and thought it looked a bit stringy, but turned out great! My 5 y/o didn't even know it was there. Tastes great warm, even better next day.

Very good! Used the cocoa powder suggested instead of the chocolate squares and added some nutmeg for more spice. Also made in muffin tins (25 mins.) to take to a cook out and they were an instant hit. The family has insisted on this again!

This is definitely more like a dense cake than a sweet bread.  I used 1 cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of zucchini.  I used 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder instead of the chcolate bars.  I used 1/2 cup vegetable oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.  I also used 1 cup chocolate chips and coated them in flour before I stirred them into the batter.  Next time I'll use this recipe to make a layer cake instead of in loaf pans...BECAUSE THIS IS NOT BREAD...IT'S CAKE!!  Very yummy though.  :)

This turned out great. I shredded the squash in my Cuisinart. I followed the recipe as written and made two, nicely sized loaves. It might be fun to sub white chocolate chips next time.

This bread was delicious. I added some cocoa and some shredded coconut. I had made this to get rid of some zucchini and put it out at a party. It went very fast. Next time I would add an extra square of chocolate and more cocoa. I would also keep the 1 cup of shredded coconut, I would add less sugar, maybe cut 1/2 cup to 1 cup out. I will make this again. Thanks.

Really this recipe is 3.5 stars for me but everyone else seemed to like it so 4 stars it is!  Only sub was to use 3 parts apple sauce and one part oil. The three main problems I had - there is no zucchini taste - I don't think 2 cups is enough.  I'm sure you could easily use 3 cups.  Also the directions for the recipe states "lightly grease" pan. You need to really grease your pans or use parchment paper.  My loaves did a pretty good job of sticking to their pans. Lastly, the chocolate taste wasn't chocolatey tasting enough for me.  Maybe some cocoa powder would have done a better job.  Although my chocolate chips didn't sink next time I will coat them in flour (as per other reviewers suggestion).  It's a good idea.

This is quite tasty. I added a few more chocolate chips than called for, but that was the only change I made. Oh yeah, and I forgot the cinnamon. Really great when it's warm from the oven! You can't even tell that it has zucchini in it - don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing....

I just made this today, I printed the recipe two days ago when my mother-in-law gave me a HUGE zucchini, which I don't even eat!  She's disabled and cannot bake for herself so when she suggested we look for a bread recipe we found this one.  We are both chocoholics so of course one with chocolate as opposed to none sounded better!  I thought it would be a good thing to let my 2 year old son have since its got zucchini in it and he loved it!  I actually did too, now we just have to test it on mom-in-law!

AWESOME!!! My kids are loving this, just printed this recipe 5 days ago and already made 4 loaves of this.  Came back to All Recipes to print it for all that asked me for the recipe.  Made according to directions but only baked :50 mins, and used Jumbo eggs.  I am going to have to try the lower fat options next using this recipe.

Even after coating the chocolate chips with the dry ingrediants, they still sank to the bottom of the bread pan.  It caused cutting the bread to be a little difficult.  The taste was okay, I would have enjoyed it more had the chocolate chips spread evenly through the batter.  

Maybe I'll try it again and sprinkle the chocolate chips on top of the batter before sticking it in the oven, to give them a chance to sink a little more evenly.

This is a great recipe that seems adaptable to modifications.  I just made this tonight (in fact, one loaf still in the oven) and the chocolate taste is rich and wonderful.  I changed the oil to 1/2 c. and added 1/2 c. cinnamon applesauce, added about 3/4 c. chopped walnuts and used 70% dark cacao chocolate in place of the unsweetened chocolate and decreased sugar to 1 1/2 c. My results were excellent with a moist, flavorful product and I will certainly make this again!

Yummy!  What a great way to use the abundance of zucchini at this time of year!  I halved the recipe BUT used the whole 2 Cups of zucchini and the whole 3/4 C of chocolate chips; it yielded one nice sized loaf.  I had to bake this for a bit longer than the recipe specified, maybe because the one loaf had the full 2 Cups of zucchini.  I also added a touch of nutmeg.  My whole family loves this! I will make it again.

It's terrible! Because you just can't stop eating! I sure will make this recipe over and over again! This positivelly is the best way to eat chocolate and zucchini. I used nuts instead of chocolate chips, and also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. YUMMY!

Delicious bread!!  We loved it.  Very moist and full of chocolate flavor.  I had to use semi-sweet baking chocolate squares since I was out of the unsweetened squares, so maybe that made it more chocolaty?  Thanks so much for the zucchini recipe.  I am always looking for different ways to bake with it.

Very tasty. I subbed 6 tbsp cocoa powder per another user's suggestions (didn't have cocoa squares in the house). I think next time I would add more chocolate chips - they really do liven it up!

Very moist & chocolatey.  It did stick to the pan, though, so I will grease & flour next time.  I also added 1 cup of chips tossed in flour & I didn't think the cinnamon flavor was overpowering.

Nice and moist, I enjoyed every bite, as did my husband.  Also like that it makes 2 loaves.  That way, if you want to give one, you can still have one!!  Also, as I normally do, I added extra chocolate chips.  After all, you can never have to much chocolate!!

I used half wheat flour and half white flour, was generous on the zucchini, and was frugal on the chocolate chips and oil.  Zucchini works as a "natural fat" as it is.  Chocolate chips can sometimes make things overly rich.  I couldn't detect a "nutty" texture from using half wheat flour.  I was just hoping to add some healthyness to the recipe. Overall, delicious!  I'll use this one again and again.

I made mine into muffins, using papers - followed the recipe except I doubled the chocolate chips and used canola instead of vegetable oil.  Baked for about 30 min, but watched it from 20 min on.  Use REAL vanilla extract it makes a difference.

These turned out excellent, I was given a HUGE zucchini from a friend and it barely put a dent in it, will probably make a bunch of loaves and freeze them to eat during the winter.

Made with with my daughter to take for a picnic, with a few small changes:
* cut down sugar to 1 cup
* used 1.25cup apple sauce instead of oil
* substituted white chocolate for the semi-sweet choc chips in recipe
The bread turned out really perfect. We used fresh zucchini from our garden and the cake was very nice and moist.

I just made this recipe and oh man is this ever good!  I followed some of the suggestions such as 2/3 cup of apple sauce, 1/3 cup oil, and mixed the chocolate chips in with the flour.  I also put waxed paper on the bottom of my pans and sprayed heavily with canola oil.  My breads came out with no problem and taste great.  I know they won't last long!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!!!

Well, this didn't stay in my kitchen very long! Everyone loves this recipe because it is more chocolate-y than sweet. I will always use the unsweetened bar for that reason. I used the applesauce/oil mix and it gave a wonderfully moist loaf. I did add a little more flour before I poured into mini-loaf pans. Hint: Mix your chocolate chips with 1/4 c. flour before you add to the mix! I cannot wait to make this again and I hope it freezes well--I've got a lot of zucchini.

I thought this recipe was great - I followed it exactly except put 1/2tsp more baking soda as suggested in other reviews.  I greased and floured the pans - didn't stick at all.  Definately make this again.

Everyone loved it!  Very simple and very chocolatey!  I would add more chocolate chips though, and I like more walnuts as well.  Had great crisp outside, which I love, and super moist inside.  Even the kids devoured this.  Thanks for a new recipe in my repetoire!

In the words of my father-in-law...This is an awesome recipe!  I used german chocolate as I did not have unsweetened chocolate and added a couple tablespoons of cocoa.  Instead of regular chocolate chips, I used the mini ones.  This is a keeper recipe!
UPDATE:  to those who's chips are sinking - try mixing 1/4 of your flour with the chips.  I have found that if you are using regular size chips, they will tend to sink.  Mini chips work best.

This is sure an improvement on "plain old zucchini bread"! Especially for us chocolate lovers. Don't be afraid to substitute all of the oil with applesauce....it will be just as moist and MUCH less fattening. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the way to eat your vegetables!  :-)  My picky toddlers hoovered this "cake" up as quickly their pudgy fingers allowed them.  It is a great way to use up all that wonderful, garden fresh zucchini.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips as a substitute for the squares of chocolate at the beginning of the recipe.

This bread is really delicious!  I usually make it the night before because it always tastes better the next day.  Also, I use milk chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet.  Update 2/11/09: Substituted almond extract and added some freshly grated ginger - amazing!!

Excellent "bread"!  I used semi-sweet chocolate, cut the sugar to only 1 cup and used 3/4cup of oil and it still turned out great!  I added the zucchini at the end followed by the chocolate chips.  Would never guess that it was zucchini bread.  Even my picky 2&3 year olds loved it!

Yum!  I made this in a bundt pan, and baked it for 75 minutes. I also used a combination of semi and milk chocolate chips.  It turned out moist and delicious.  Definitely more of a cake than a bread, and no kid will ever suspect there is zucchini in it, especially if you peel it and grate it on a fine grater (squeeze the excess moisture out).

My grand children loved it! Easy to make and moist.I added 1 tsp. instant coffee after the melted chocolate and oil to give it a malted flavor(I do this with all my chocolate recipes)I also cut the cinnamon down from 1 tsp. to 1/2 tsp. so it would not over power the taste of the chocolate.

This bread was out of this world. Everyone in my family loved it. It was just like eating chocolate, chocolate chip cake. My 1 year old and 4 year old couldn't get enough of it. It stayed moist and delicious for days! I can't wait to make it again and share the recipe with more friends and family.

This recipe had lots of flavor.  My 5 year old loved it and she thought it was a brownie!  What a clever way to disguise the zucchini!  It was really moist but the crust was just a little too crumbly.  Had a little problem removing it from the loaf pan.  I also used choclate chunks instead of chips.  Was a big hit!

delicious! soft and chocolately, can barely tell there's zucchini in it...great for the kids, but i would add at least 1 cup of chocolate chips next time. i only had semi-sweet baking chocolate and that seemed to work fine. makes 2 loaves!

This was good & moist & well like by some of our family, but not everyone.  We had a couple kids suspicious of the green bits! The chocolate taste came mainly from the chips. I think I'll try it again, substituting some cocoa for some flour.

One of the best zucchini breads I've ever had. Anyone who loves chocolate will love this bread. I added some walnuts the second time I made it and it tasted even more awesome. Kids can't even tell that it has zucchini in it.

This cake, er I mean bread, is super yummy. 60 minutes was enough time - plus the tips for small chips worked great. I added walnuts since I like a little crunch in my cake-breads. Scrumptious!

Preface: The recipe I made, I loved. However, that recipe was not truly the recipe given, which is why I am giving it only 3 stars.

After reading the reviews, I made the following changes: added about 2/3 cup of sour cream, added 1/4 cocoa powder, added and extra 1/4 cup chocolate chips, did a tablespoon of vanilla rather than a teaspoon, and added a little extra zucchini. Simply because I prefer it, I also decided to make muffins instead of loaves. 

With these changes, the muffins were delightful. The texture was moist yet light, and the flavor was yummy. Even with adding a 1/4 cup cocoa powder and chocolate chips, however, I personally would have preferred it a little more chocolatey. I won't hold this against the recipe though since I'm admittedly a chocoholic.  

I will definitely make these again, but would keep the same changes I made plus add extra melted chocolate as well.

I made a couple of changes based on other reviews and they still turned out great.  I decreased the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and substituted half of the oil with applesauce.  I'm certain the recipe is great as it -- I'm just trying to save some calories.  My nephew, who wouldn't dare eat zucchini -- if he knew it was there -- devours these!

Delicious! I made the recipe just as instructed. However, instead of 2 large loaf pans I made 12 muffins and 2 mini loaves. The muffins make it easy for the kids to grab one or 2 on the run. They turned out so moist! My son doesn't know they had zucchini in them and ate most of what I made. He probably wouldn't have even tasted them had he known! This is a recipe I will come back to again and again

This is an UNBELIEVABLY delicious "bread"!  It's more like CAKE, and since you can't even taste the zucchini, keep telling everyone it really is zucchini bread! LOL.  It was a huge hit w/everyone at work, and in my family, not to mention I myself, couldn't stop eating it. So maker, beware! lol

After reading several of the reviews I made sure to grease and flour my pans. I baked the bread for 80 minutes and even though the toothpick came out clean the pans were greased and floured the bread still stuck. This bread is delicious and I will make it again but next time I'm gonna leave it in the oven for 90 - 100 minutes.

Absolutely wonderful recipe. I agree with other posters about the greasing, however. I did liberally grease the pans and the bread still stuck terribly. I will use parchment paper next time. I changed the recipe a bit and replaced the semi-sweet morsels with a chopped Lindt 70% cocoa bar just to rachet the chocolate up a bit. I added nuts also. The bread was super moist and smelled great when baking. I will make this again!

Delicious!  After reading the reviews, I used 2 cups zucchini, for the sugar I used half white and half brown. Also, I used 1/2 c oil and substituted the other 1/2 c with applesauce. Used 1 cup mini choc chips and tossed in flour before adding.

Tried this recipe today. My twin girls gobbled it up. Great recipe. Added 1 tsp of baking powder to make it rise up. And would reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups next time. Excellent recipe to use up the extra zucchinis from the garden .

This is a really great recipe to use up any left over zucchini or yellow squash you have left from your garden.  I took advice from others and added 1/2 cup of sour cream and used 1/2 cup of cocoa powder instead of melting the chocolate. LOVE IT!

This is one of my favorite fall/holiday recipes.  I add 1/4 C cocoa powder instead of the baking chocolate and 1 c chocolate chips to make it extra chocolaty. It makes great muffins as well as bread loaves. (I can get 1 large loaf and 12 muffins from this recipe)

Very good.  I used 2 cups zucchini and added 1 cup shredded carrots to get more veggies in for my son.  I also used 1 1/4 cup sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar and added a tsp of dark cocoa powder to the mix.  I baked as muffins for about 15-20 min, until toothpick was clean.

I love this recipe.  It's the best possible way to make zucchini. Like other reviewers I did make some changes.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out kind of greasy because of the cup of oil.  So now I use 1/2 C of apple sauce and 1/2 C of sour cream and leave the oil out entirely.  I've also tried substituting Coconut oil for vegetable oil and that turned out really good.  Also I double the Unsweetened Chocolate and add additional cocoa powder because it is not nearly chocolaty enough.

This is really delicious.  I made a few changes.  I used 1 C sugar, 1 C applesauce NO oil.  I used cocoa (3T + 1T butter).  I made 4 mini loaves and baked them for 30 min on bottom shelf 15 min on top shelf.  It is so moist my husband took some in to work and sold them for $4 a loaf.  In one loaf I added dark chocolate chips and a handful of raspberries, haven't tried that one yet but I am sure it will be good.  This is a super moist recipe I really love it I will definitely make it again.

One thing I know for sure: this zucchini bread tastes MUCH better the second day!  I really was not too impressed when I ate a slice just an hour after baking it.  I'm glad I didn't review it then.  The next day, and for the next few days, this chocolate zucchini bread was quite delicious!

DELICIOUS! Moist & chocolatey. This bread was so good. It was more like dessert. I didnt have the chocolate squares so I used 6 Tbsp Cocoa powder. I also used almost 3 cups zucchini because I cup up too much. I sprayed my pans with extra Bakers Joy and baked for 60 mins. Perfect!

This recipe is perfect as is--moist, cake-like, hint of cinnamon...delicious! Cooked for 55 minutes--but then I think my oven might run slightly hot.

Awesome Awesome Awesome!! I make this a lot and it comes out great each time! I use 2 1/2 squares of semi sweet chocolate. And I also add the chocolate to the flour after its melted. Grease the pans well or it will stick!! I just made 6 loaves (double recipe) in under the time it took my oven to heat up!

Amazing!  I made this in mini muffin pans and baked at 325 for 25 minutes.  Came out perfect.  I also added walnuts because zucchini bread just isn't zucchini bread without them.  I also used mini chocolate chips instead of full size.  For some reason when I use the regular size, they tend to stick to the bottom of my pans.  The mini chips don't sink to the bottom of the muffins.  This is my "go to" recipe now.

Amazingly good! Can't believe this is zucchini bread - it takes like moist chocolate spice cake! I was feeling uncharacteristically health conscious when I made this, so I subbed applesauce for half the oil, but otherwise followed the recipe and it was amazing. Oh, I also didn't really measure the shredded zukes, but I suspect I had way more than recipe called for - still turned out wonderful! Thank you for the recipe!

I made this for the first time today, and just now sliced a piece to sample. WOW! It is so good, moist and so chocolatey! My teenage daughter was hesitant to try it because of the name, i.e. zucchini, but she was very pleasantly surprised, and even had a second piece! Thank you!

I made this a few times when our zucchini was in season because after the first time, everyone wanted more. I added a little nutmeg as well and it was incredible. Hand down my favourite chocolate zucchini bread recipe!

Great recipe. I did not use the melted chocolate, but still found the bread to be moist and tasty. This was my first time making zucchini bread and my chocolate chips sank, but I'll follow the advice of other reviewers next time and flour them first.

As others have said, an EXCELLENT recipe.  Very dense and moist and delicious.  Here are the changes I made: cut down sugar to 1 1/2 cups (very glad I did this as I think it might be too sweet with the full 2 cups); replaced 1/2 the oil with applesauce; added additional zucchini; used mini chocolate chips (added to the dry ingredients to prevent sinking to the bottom); added walnuts; used cocoa and butter instead of the unsweetened chocolate (3 tbsp cocoa and 1 tbsp butter per square of chocolate).
Will make this one over and over.  I froze enough zucchini from my garden to make this throughout winter.

Amazing, moist and chocolatey.  I did use 3 (1 ounce) squares of unsweetened chocolate instead of 2.  Also, I added chopped cherries that I had soaked in rum overnight to one of the loaves.  Very good.

Super good bread! I left out the chocolate chips and the cinnamon (one of my kids' friends has an allergy) I also substituted applesauce for oil, and agave nectar for sugar (better for the waistline AND super good for diabetics) it smells delicious and I did it all in the bread machine!

It gets 4 stars for the delicious taste.  I substituted coconut oil for the veggie oil but I full cup is way too much!  Bread is incredibly oily.  Used Hershey's dark chocolate instead of unsweetened or semisweet chocolate and also used raw sugar instead.  Will make again with half the oil.

Fabulous!!! Love this wonderful bread/cake.  Two things I would do differently - I forgot to dredge the chocolate chips in flour; Bake longer, I chose the shortest recommended time and next time I will add the additional 10 minutes (or maybe longer as this is a very, very moise bread).  I can't say enough about how goooood this is (hubby just loved it), plus the zukes came from our veggie garden!!

It turned out amazing, in fact my husband could not stop eating the batter! I didnt have cocia squares so I substituted 1/4 c cocoa mixed with 1/4 c sour cream.. I think that helped with the moistness too! I will definately use this again.

I love this recipe! I tried it recently and have been making it a lot now...it's become a staple!  I ran out of zucchini and made it with shredded carrot and I also ran out of eggs and so replaced each egg with 1/4 cup applesauce and it turned out great.  I didn't stir in choc. chips but sprinkled chocolate chips over the top before baking.  I took this to a large gathering and had no leftovers and plenty of compliments.  I also made these into muffins the other day because my daughter had been asking for cupcakes and so these passed off as chocolate cupcakes.  I just cooked 20 minutes for muffins.

This is very good and moist.  I will put a buttered piece of wax paper on the bottom of the pans.  I loaded the pans with butter but the bottoms really stuck and broke apart. My grandson does NOT eat any veggies but loves chocolate cake.  He loved this...psst...didn't tell him there was zucchini in it.

I thought this was a great recipe. Very moist. I did spray the bottom and the sides of the pans with PAM. After I took them out of the oven, let them sit for 30 min. Inverted the pans and they slipped right out. Did not stick like other reviews mentioned. An old trick I learned from baking bread.  Also, I sprikled the chips on top of the bread seems to keep them from sinking to the bottom.

I thought this was just okay.  It didn't rise enough; if I made it again I would add 1 tsp. baking powder.  The chocolate flavor wasn't very strong, and it stuck to the pan.  Sorry, but I'll try a different recipe next time.

I LOVE this recipe. I started using it about two years ago after a bounitiful backyard garden full of zucchinnis. They are easy to grow, but who really eats them? I found this recipe and have been repeatedly asked for the receipe. My sister even brings over zucchinni's for me to make her this bread. Suggestion: Use only 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 of apple sauce. Also, serve warm as a dessert. It tastes more like chocolate cake then bread! YUM!

This came out great! I used 1.5 cups of sugar and 3/4 cup of oil and it came out perfect. I used 1 cup of mini chocolate morsels. I baked it in a 9x13 inch pan for 35 minutes instead of two loaf pans.

Great recipe!  I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of unsweetened apple butter, because I didn't have applesauce like other suggested.  I also used 1/2 whole spelt flour and 1/2 white spelt.  It is so yummie you can't tell there is a vegetable in it.  Thanks

I changed only a couple things with the recipe: used 1 cup white/1 cup brown sugar, used only 2/3 cup oil, and omitted the choc chips - but only because I forgot about them. Mine was still plenty moist and I liked the fact that some of the zucchini flavor remained. This is a GREAT recipe as-is if you're looking for a tasty quickbread for breakfast or as a light dessert. If you want something more decadent - then go ahead and add sour cream or more chocolate.

Yummy! The only thing I changed was that I used apple sauce instead of using oil and then instead of melted unsweetened chocolate, I used dark chocolate. To top things off, I sprinkled some cocoa nibs on top, which gives the bread such an awesome texture. =) Enjoy!

This is a great recipe, all in all, but keep in mind that each baker will have different results in the end.  Even though I followed the instructions about lightly greasing the pans, my loaves stuck badly to the bottom.  My pans are not non-stick so the next time I make this I will grease the bottom of the pans and then line the bottom only with waxed paper, just like I do when I bake German chocolate cake. Also I will check for doneness at 50-55 minutes because my bread was a tad dry after baking for 60 min. If you don't like chocolate/cinnamon combo omit the cinnamon.  It will taste just as good.  Two grated, medium zucchinis yielded two packed cups. Going to buy more zucchini soon so that I can try to perfect this recipe.

Made this with half the oil and 3 cups of zucchini.  I also subbed the chocolate chips for butterscotch chips and added walnuts.  It was faaaabulous.  Stuck to the bottom of the pans, which I blame on the butterscotch chips, so next time I'll line them with parchment, but I'll make this again the same way in a heartbeat.

This was very good but needs wayyy more zucchini!! It was too dry for my liking. Next time I will add at least 4 cups of zucchini.  I also didn't have unsweetened bakers squares. 2 tblsp cocoa powder plus 1 tblsp oil = 1 ounce square.

I still found this to be too sweet after decreasing the sugar to 1 1/2 cup.  I made the following modifications: 6T cocoa + 2 T butter (as substitution for the unsweetened chocolate)  Used 1 C white sugar and 1/2 C turbinado sugar  Replaced 1/2 of the oil with applesauce.  Used 1/2 C AP flour and 1/2 C whole wheat flour

This has been a hit every single time I have made it. I've cut the sugar in half with little effect and even substituted honey, which makes it more moist.  I've also cut chocolate chips quantity for a less chocolately version.

This is by far the best chocolate zuchini recipe I have found!  I made this in a bundt pan.  Turned out to be a wonderful cake..light and fluffy. I added powdered sugar on the top for the final touch. My family can't get enough of this..I have made this twice just this week.

yum yum yum. Another hit with my hubby.  I made these originally to take to a meeting but we ended up buying cookies on the way because my husband wanted to keep them all for himself.  I didn't have any bittersweet chocolate, so I used semi-sweet and just cut back the sugar a bit.  I also substituted applesauce for ALL of the oil and it turned out just fine.  Next time, I want to try throwing a banana into the mix.  A definite winner!

I originally made this for a ladies meeting and it was gone. I made the recipe as is and it was moist nd full of chocolate taste. My husband and neighbors loved it. It is not low in calories, but great with a cup of tea or coffee.

Honestly,  I didn't think this was that good.  Granted I didn't add the chocolate chips, I reduced the oil and used Whole wheat flour instead of white flour, but still.  For me the Zucchini Flavor was too strong and I couldn't taste enough chocolate.  This recipe isn't worth the calories.

Nobody believed it was zucchini bread. It was much lighter than most zucchini breads I have ever tried and the chocolate put it over the top!

Great Bread - thank you.  I too used Cocoa powder because I didn't have the squares.  The powder and shortening worked fine.  This is a keeper - I will make again and again.

This is an excellent recipe. We added a half cup of walnuts and to help prevent sticking, cut a piece of parchment paper the shape of the bottom of the bread loaf pans we used and greased the top of the parchment paper and the loaves came out great. Everyone raves about this recipe.

I made this and it was the best zucchini bread I've ever tasted!  I made about 15 mini loaves of it and shared it with patrons at the bar I work at.  Everyone raved about how great it tastes and wants a copy of the recipe, so I've been emailing/sharing your recipe on here!  Thanks for a fantastic and easy recipe!

this is terrific, and if you have some zucchini to use up you should definitely put it in your repertoire.  I subbed some of the oil with applesauce and some of the sugar with splenda, otherwise made it as written and we all loved it.  Even my son's friend, who doesn't eat vegetables at all, loved it.  We didn't tell him about the zucchini until after he ate it though--he was like 'I've never had zucchini, its good'.  lol.

This bread did not turn out at all for me. The method is all wrong, you cannot add melted baking chocolate at the same time as the zucchini, it will sieze up and become hard little balls in the batter. I wasn't sure about the cinnamon, but added it anyway, thinking the mexican chocolate cake has it, and that is delicious. This bread is not rich enough to pull it off. I even added some cocoa powder to the flour to try to make it more chocolatey. It didn't work. I added the chocolate chips to the dry ingredients, and they didn't sink, but my mini loaves all stuck horribly to the pans. This is the first quick bread I have ever had stick to my stoneware pans that have been well seasoned. I think the bread itself just didn't hold together to come out of the pan. I tasted the bread, and it just wasn't very chocolatey, it was kind of regular zucchini bread with some bitter chocolate mixed into it. Wierd taste, so I tried to save it, and made a glaze for the bread using chocolate, butter, and cream. It still didn't help much.

This was the first time I have made zucchini bread and it was excellent! Very moist and delicious. My son hates vegetables but loved this bread! The only change I made was to substitute the 6 tablespoons of cocoa and 2 tablespoons butter in place of the chocolate squares. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

So I started making this recipe, and realized that the grater was being difficult, so I just chopped the zucchini up into itty bitty pieces with a knife instead. I ended up having closer to 3 cups then 2, but I figured it would make the recipe more zucchini-tastic, so I added it all anyhow. I was feeling saucy, so rather then using 2 cups of white sugar, I did 1 cup white and 1 cup brown. I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate, so I kinda took the idea from the Chocolate Zucchini Bread II recipe and used 1/4 cup cocoa powder instead. Now here's the bad part: when I got to the point where I needed to add in the flour, I realized that I only had 1 cup's worth left. I just didn't feel like going to the grocery store (it was late) or harassing someone else to go to the grocery store (I'm entirely too nice for my own good), so I cracked open a package of brownie mix and used a cup of that instead, figuring that brownie mix is probably mostly flour anyhow....right? So I baked it for 60 min and the result was rather like an English pudding crossed with, well, brownie. Crusty on top, and really moist in the middle, with random globs of chocolate and zucchini. My mutant concoction in no way resembled what this recipe was supposed to look like in the end, but it went fabulous with vanilla ice cream!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I've used it several times and it always comes out fabulous.  I normally don't write a review if I've made changes but the changes I made are very minor.  I don't normally keep chocolate (bars) on hand so I used cocoa powder and I don't think it effects the taste or texture, if it is a bit dry, then I add an extra small egg to the batter.    I also find grating my zucchini on the smallest grating side works best.  I've made it with a bigger grate, like what you'd get from your food processor but the smaller size seems to make the bread really moist with a better texture than the bigger size.  I also use whole wheat flour instead of white and I don't think it changes much.  I've done some variations as well such as putting strawberries or raspberries in the mixture.  I usually make mine into extra large muffins and then ice them with cake coating and add a variety of sprinkles or cake decorations.  This recipe will always be in my recipe box :).

Very good recipe!  I actually combined this and the "Mom's Zucchini Bread" recipes and made half a recipe of each.  I used a little bit more sugar because the other recipe called for more, 2 t. vanilla, 1 t. baking powder, 2 t. cinnamon and no chocolate chips.  Again, these changes were made because the other recipe called for them, not because this recipe isn't probably perfect as it is (and I'll definitely be trying it again as it :)).  My husband loves chocolate and loves zucchini bread, so this one is a winner for sure!

This turned out great!  I don't usually make a lot of changes but recently my husband found out he has diabetes so I made a number of changes so that he could enjoy this.  First I used liquid unsweetened chocolate, 3/4 C of canola oil ( I would have tried half applesauce but I was out of it--next time) 3/4 C fake eggs, splenda sugars 3/4 white and 1/4 brown; you only use half of the sugar needed when using spelnda baking sugar.  I also mixed in a banana.  This was really good and I will make it again.  I did flour the chips and I added pecans to the flour before adding to the batter.  I used pam/w flour for the pans and had no problems getting loaves out.  This was a huge hit and actually I may even use less sugar next time it was a bit sweet.

I made this with my 5 year old and 9 year old granddaughters- fun rainy day cooking time. It was delicious- the girls loved it, even the 5 year old who hates most green vegetables. She loved watching me shred the zucchini and both girls were a big help. We froze a loaf and sent a loaf home with them. Next week I will make these into muffins.

This bread is awesome!!!  I did add the sour cream just for giggles, and a bit extra flour for safety! This is a great way to get the kids to eat the zucchini I love:)  I doubled it and will freeze it for the winter~ We have a winner here

CRAVABLE!!!!! I used the slight modifications of 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 oil and the lowered sugar content (1.5 cups). I did let the zucchini drain just a bit before add to the mix but WOW it was a big hit with even my 4 and 2 year olds! Thanks for sharing!

I agree that this is a wonderful recipe.  I also couldn't resist making some changes, just to make it ultra-healthy.      I used:  6 Tbs. cocoa and 2 Tbs. oil for the chocolate; I used 2 cups Splenda instead of sugar; I used 1 cup cinnamon applesauce instead of the oil; I used 1 cup whole wheat and 1 cup all purpose flour for the 2 cups of all purpose flour;  I omitted the cinnamon since it was already in the applesauce.  I also, only baked it between 40 to 50 mins.    I've made 8 loaves of this in the last 2 weeks and family and friends LOVE it!  Even my littlest ones.  It is very moist and a very nice treat for dessert.    Thank you for posting this one.

This is the most delicious and decadent bread.  The flavor is out of this world and my family thoroughly enjoys it.   I have four loaves in the oven to bring for a family function since it got such rave reviews last year.     Yummy, especially if you're a chocolate lover.  The zucchini is a hidden moistening ingredient.    Easy and accurate recipe. Five Stars all around from me.

Very moist and fantastic flavor BUT even though I thoroughly greased a non-stick bundt pan, I needed a chisel to get it out. It broke up into several pieces. Good thing I only made it for my family. Since they really liked it, they didn't mind that it was broken up. Also, my three yr. old didn't like those "green" things in the cake, so next time I'm going to peel the zucchini first.

I love this recipe!  I've made it over a dozen times and always get rave reviews. I have never altered the recipe even. It is plenty chocolaty too!  Stays moist, and is one of my favorite breads to make.

Used 1.5c sugar, added 3 tsp cocoa powder. Half white, half whole wheat flour. Only 2/3 c chocolate chips because that is all I had. Made 18 big cupcakes, 25min in the oven. Could be a bit more chocolatey - doesn't look or taste as dark and rich as I'd like, but tasty and moist.

Did not care for this too much. Followed the recepie exactly. The loaf stuck to the bottom of the pan inspite of being very well greased. Would not make this again.

Superb recipe for a healthful chocolate loaf.  I use organic sugar(you can actually cut it back a bit too, mine still comes out nice.)  Used Hersheys Cocoa Special Dark Unsweetened Cocoa Powder.  Also made cupcakes, with a thin layer of frosting.  Kids will love them - and a good way to get at least a little veggies in them.  Great 'Chocolate Cupcake' alternative!

As mentioned before in another review - It's not quite Zucchini and it's not quite chocolatey. I also had problems getting it out of the pan and now have several "mini" loaves. I will stick with my moms tried and true recipes and just add chocolate if I so desire.  Thanks anyways!

Yummy bread. I was a little disappointed because I thought it could have been more moist. Stuck to the recipe completely, but used mini chocolate chips.

I have made this a few times, most recently for brunch today. Our oven runs hot so we usually don't cook things as long as direction say but this time I only baked it 40 mins and it was the best of all the times I have made it. It is SO moist and yummy. I love this bread!! Everyone raved about it today and wanted the recipe. It's easy to make and makes 2 nice size loaves. YUM!! Make this recipe!

Delicous, cake-like, rich!  I took the advice of others and used cocoa powder.  This worked fine (you can add it with the dry ingredients).  Sticking to the bottom of the pan is a problem.  Even with heavy greasing, the bottom half stuck!  Problem solved...I lined the bottom of my bread pan with parchement paper after spraying the pan with Pam.

Fabulous recipe; thank you Diane! I too changed a few things to make it even healthier: 1 1/4 cups of sugar instead of 2, 3/4 oil plus 1/4 apple sauce instead of 1 cup oil. I also added about 1/4 cup ground flax seeds and 2 tsp cocoa. Everyone loved it!

Yum! I made muffins (12 big ones) and they were done in 45 mins. Mine is a little bit of a healthier version. I used almost 3 cups of shredded zuchini, used one and a half cup of white flour and 1/2 cup of wheat bran. I didn't have any chocolate squares. I added 1/4 cup of cocoa instead. I used 1/2 a cup of oil and 1/2 cup of apple butter (apple sauce would be a good option). Used only 1/2 cup of splenda sugar, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I found that with the chocolate chips and the sweetness of the apple butter it was sweet enough in the end.

I didn't have the unsweetened chocolate on hand like most reviewers so I took the suggestion of 3 tbsp cocoa, 2 tbsp melted butter as a substitution. I also used 1/2c of oil and 1/2c of applesauce and added 1/2c of fat free sour cream. I baked them as muffins and a loaf and the muffins took about 18-19 minutes and the loaf took about 40 minutes or so. I also only used 1 1/2c of sugar rather than the 2c. Next time i'll likely add a bit more cocoa powder.

Wonderfully moist cake.  I used all whole wheat flour, and replaced 3/4 of the oil with applesauce, and it's day three and the cake is still delightfully moist and hasn't gotten chewy at all (as I've had other recipes do with the apple sauce replacement).  I also used four tightly packed cups of zucchini.

I brought this to work and everyone loved it.  I used half whole wheat flour and I think that with all the chocolate, oil, and sugar you could even use all whole wheat flour if you want.

I put in a little extra zucchini (these quick breads always seem able to handle more veggie or fruit if you have it).

The chocolate chips do tend to get to the bottom, but it's okay.

Very Good...I used this recipe, but I did not have any unsweetened chocolate, so I used 3T cocoa mixed with 1T of veg oil.  I also used 3/4 c sugar with 3/4 c of Splenda blend instead of 2 c of sugar.  I used 1/2 applesauce in place of 1/2 cup of oil. Mini choc chips worked great.  It was a hit!!

This is wonderful. I used 3/4 c applesauce and 1/4 oil. Used only 1 1/3 c sugar and still super good.  
I made one loaf and one pan of muffins.
Will for sure make again!  Everyone loves it.

This was a very tasty bread/cake. I would have liked it more chocolatey, and I'm sure it would have been if I'd had all of the ingredients. Here were the modifications I made: 2 Tbs. cocoa instead of the chocolate, and no chocolate chips, because I was out; half wheat flour and half white; half brown sugar and half white; organic chocolate extract and organic orange extract (1 tsp. each) instead of the vanilla. Additionally, even though I used homemade baker's secret, which prevents almost everything from sticking, I had to cut this into pieces to get it out of the bundt pan.

Can I give it six stars? Honestly, it's a good thing my wife doesn't like chocolate breads because I've eaten both loaves myself.  Wow I think this has to be one of the best recipes I've gotten form allrecipes.

These were fantastic. My kids gobbled them up in no time and I felt a little better with them having them because of the zucchini. I did use 3 cups of zucchini and added 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil. Simply delicious - you must try!

This was absolutely delicious. I am lowering my cholesterol by adding ground flaxseed to my diet and this recipe was a good one to experiment on. I substituted 2 of the 3 eggs by putting 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed in a small bowl and adding 6 tablespoons of warm water,setting this aside for about 10 minutes . It has the gel consistency of egg whites when it is ready. I added this along with the last egg in the recipe and the bread turned out great. I also cut the oil by 2/3 by using that much in applesauce.  Even though I  only used 1/3 of the oil and one actual egg... this was a pretty tasty  zucchini bread, moist and chocolaty, I will make this again!! :)

I made this for some college friends that came over this past weekend. It was fantastic! Like a lot of other people said, more like a cake than bread...which I had no problem with! I cut the recipe in half and greased and floured the loaf pan so I didn't have any problems with it sticking. I coated the chocolate chips in flour before mixing them in the batter and made a glaze with confectioners sugar and milk that I drizzled on top for a sweet finish. Delicious!

This truely a five star recipie except for the fact that it sticks to the pan. Tried twice first time with the baking tempurture, 350 degrees but was done in 45 minutes, could not get it out of the pan. (Does not make for a pretty loaf!) Taste and texture was still very good. I made again today, decreased the temperture to 325 degrees for baked for 55 minutes and it still stuckto the pan. Again bread is really good. First loaf warm could not get out of the pan, so second loaf I let cool completly, but had to pry it out with a metal spatula, came out almost complete. I am using new non stick pans, but I guess I should still lightly grease the loaf pans.

I made this exact recipe only using 3 cups of zucchini because I had a little extra.  Now I have changed the recipe to 3 cups.  I have made about 6 batches and everyone says it is the best they have ever had.  My 3 1/2 year old loves it!  Her 4 year old friend asked if she could have more "brownie".  It's a great recipe!  Thanks for sharing it!

Mine came out moist but a bit crumbly at the bottom.  Not as dense as most quick breads, more cake like.  I doubled the chocolate, used half whole wheat/half white flour, half brown sugar/half white.  Overall it had an excellent taste and I loved the chocolate chips in it.  Baked in a glass pan this took only 55 minutes at 340 degrees.  Next time I will add more zucchini.

This is GOOD!! Very very rich though, but no one believes it has zukes! I dint have the chocolate, so used cocoa and butter instead, and it came out perfect. Definitely a keeper, though next time I might reduce the oil to 1/2 cup and use whole wheat flour instead.

It's so good.  I made some modifications:   I use 1/2 of the oil, add 2 tbsp of cocoa, 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose flour, bake for 50 minutes.  My husband and kids don't even know there's zucchini inside.  It's like the Sneaky Chef's recipe.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

overall this was pretty good.  i had a slightly smaller loaf pan, so cooking for the entire 60 minutes was way too long.  cooked the 2nd loaf for 45 minutes and it was just about right.  not a huge fan of the cinnamon, but might try this again with more chocolate chips and no cinnamon.

yummm! this is my favorite thing to make because it's sooo delicious (and I like to think its healthy because of the zucchini, heh).  For parties I usually make the bread in muffin pans; the only thing I change is the cook time (about 25 minutes).  They're a hit everytime!

I tried this recipe out last summer when I was given some zucchini from my cousin's garden. Since I do NOT really like zucchini I was suprised at how incredible this recipe turned out. I loved it and so did my finicky 2 year old!! Made it several times and will make it again and again.

This bread is so delicious!  I did change a few things though, I only put in half the oil and substituted the rest with applesauce and I used cocoa powder since I didn't have any unsweetned chocolate bars.  It didn't need all that oil it was plenty moist and delicious with only half.  My children devoured it and I definetely will make again soon.  Thanks for the recipe.

SOooooooooooo yummy!!! Each time I bring bread over to my neighbor her husband ALWAYS says "I hope that is the Chocolate Zucchini bread!!".  Needless to say everyone is a fan and I make it often. I freeze my Zucchini from the summer in grated 2 cups bags -- it liquifies some when it thaws but that way it is all ready just to be dumped into the bowel and baked up.

YUM!  This is the best zucchini bread I've ever tasted!  It does stick to the bottom of the pan, and I had some pretty crazy looking loaves the first time I tried making it.  Now, I take a little piece of parchment paper, trim it to fit the bottom of my loaf pan, spray a little Pam on the bottom of the pan so the parchment paper will stick, and spray the whole darn thing with some Pam.  My loaves never stick to the bottom now.  

I also found that I sometimes have clumps of flour in the bread, so now I add the zucchini after everything else and I don't have that problem.  

I also have made this recipe with excess yellow crookneck squash and I think it tastes better than when I've made it with zucchini.

This is a good recipe but would suggest that you skim through the million suggestions to find the right recipe you desire. I try to cut sugar as much as possible and with this recipe you can because of the chocolate. Kids love it; it is very moist and tasty. Review all suggestions prior to considering.

This was a great recipe.  I substitutes the oil with apple sauce which did not remove anything from its texture, it was very moist.  I also did one loaf of bread and with the otehr half I did 10 muffins, just cooking it for less time and it made great muffins too.

Wow!  I wish I could eat all my vegetables this way!  This is some of the best bread I've ever tasted!  It's very much like chocolate cake.  Excellent all around.  I used 6 egg whites, only 1.5 C white sugar, and olive oil to make it more healthy.  Don't be stingy with the chocolate chips, though -- they make it!  Absolutely heavenly eaten warm!

This bread was fantastic! I took it to work, and it was gone in two days, where only 5 people work! Of course, I took the recipe with me, and everybody took a copy of it home. I made it just as posted, but I think I will add a dash of vanilla extract to it, and maybe a few walnuts the next time I make it.

This was great bread. I would suggest leaving it for several hours, because it is so much better the next day.

I really liked this recipe. Very moist. As per the other reviews I added the extra cocoa and achieved a nice chocholate flavor. Thanks for this recipe!

I think this is, by far, the best zucchini bread recipe that I have made so far. I made it just as the recipe calls, but added 1 cup of chopped pecans. Also, when I sprayed the pans with cooking spray, I coated the pans with sugar. You have to scrape a knife in between the pan sides and bread to kinda loosen it, but it give the out side of the bread a sweet, crunchy texture. I brought this to work and it was gone in about an hour. Thanks for a great recipe.

I thought this was really nice, but mine turned out a little strange. I used 1 cup of apple sauce and no vegetable oil, also trimmed the sugar down to 1.5cups. The consistency turned out a bit like bread pudding. It still tasted good though. Next time I will use 1/2oil and 1/2 apple sauce and also not add the cinnamon, since it overpowers it a bit.

This had wonderful flavor but I don't think it needs to be in 2 pans.  They were very short little loaves and I didn't like that.  But all in all it was a great recipe!

Wonderful!  I have made this bread four times in the last month because everyone keeps asking for more!  I follow the recipe, but use mini chocolate chips. When zucchini is in season, this recipe will be a staple in my kitchen! Delicious!!!

Very yummy. The only thing I will change next time I make it is cutting the coco powder to 1 tbs. The chocolate over powered the zucchini but was still really good.

Very moist, rich, chocolately and delicious.  However, I used nonstick cooking spray to grease the pans and I had trouble with the loaves sticking to the bottom of the pans.  I wonder, since the bread turned out almost like cake, if it would have helped to both grease and flour the pans.  I wrapped the loaves in plastic wrap and refrigerated them overnight, which made them easier to slice the next morning, and you can't tell a little of the bottom is missing.  Plus I immensely enjoyed eating up the parts that stuck to the pans!

What an excellent way to use up that extra zucchini my neighbor keeps bringing me.  It was easy to make - my two little girls even helped.  (I made 4 small loaves so I could give a couple out to neighbors, but now that my bread is gone I wish I had kept it all!!! ;o)  ).  I was referred to this recipe from a friend, and I will definitely refer this to other friends.
The bread is moist and sweet without being to rich.  It's nice in the morning with tea/coffee, or for dessert (plain or with ice cream).
I'm glad my neighbor just sent over more zucchini; I'm off to make more of this bread. 
By the way... I made this recipe as is.. no changes needed.

This is a wonderful recipe!  The bread is so moist and delicious!  My very picky kids love it!  I followed the recipe as directed EXCEPT I left out the cinnamon.  The whole family devoured it.  This is another great way to use up all those zucchini!

Wonderful flavor. Wonderful texture. I followed the recipe almost exactly - I only had bittersweet chocolate and so I melted and added that instead of the unsweetened.  It turned out beautifully.  I made them in muffin pans and then topped them with a swirl of cream cheese frosting.  Very rich but everyone loved them.

I used cocoa instead of chocolate squares, and subbed applesauce for half the oil. I don't know if that was why, but the bread fell apart and was hard to serve. The flavor was good, but maybe it's a mental thing I couldn't get over the zucchini. My husband liked it until I told him about the veggies. :) I like regular zucchini bread more, but I would make this again if I was flooded with vegetables and got sick of plain zucchini bread.

OMG!! This is awesome! Made some for a bake sale~many raves from there! Made for friends~and finally for myself. This is definately a keeper!
I did omit the cinnamon, however. Just didn't seem to need it.

Wonderful - WONDERFUL!  I made 6 loaves this weekend and will be making even more tonight.  My husband adored it.  I found that I really needed to grease the pans well for them to pop out easily.

The bread totally stuck to the bottom of the pan and all the chips sunk. However, my daughter loves the bread and my husband likes it even though he hates zucchini. I guess I'd try again I'd just flour the pan next time. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour.

This recipe came out very good even with the changes that I made. To make it more healthful, I used all whole wheat flour, 1 3/4 cups Splenda, 1/4 cup honey, 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil. Besides for the slight Splenda aftertaste, it tasted great. I froze the second loaf, and the first is almost gone. Will make again!

I substituted Splenda for one cup of the sugar and applesauce for half the oil...also left out the cinnamon.  I stirred the flour, baking soda, salt and chocolate chips together before adding to the wet ingredients.  I made 12 muffins (baked for about 30 minutes) and a small loaf (baked about 15 minutes longer)...absolutely delicious!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Very good, especially for chocolate lovers!  I added a few more chips.  It did stick to the pan, so I suppose I should have greased AND floured it.  Next time.....

This bread was great.  I grated the zucchini and drained it slightly to reduce the moisture.  I also used muffin tins, and made 12 muffins, and had enough to make one small loaf also.
I didn't have any veggie oil or olive oil on hand, and was out of applesauce (um I think I need to go shopping?! ;) ) so I used only a half cup of peanut oil.
It all came out great, chocolatey, and moist.  DH said it was great!

This is an awesome chocolate zucchini bread. If you mix the chocolate chips in with the dry ingredients to coat them,the chocolate chips do not fall to the bottom. I also used parchment paper lightly greased in the bottom of the pan and it came out easily.I added nuts and used milk chocolate chips. This was the first recipe that I added to my recipe box! Bravo Diane!

As usual I cut the sugar by half a cup. I also used about a quarter-cup less oil than in the recipe, and replaced a quarter cup of flour with oat bran. I do this with most muffins and quickbreads I make from American recipes. I used a Swiss 70% cocoa chocolate and used 50 gm total. I mixed the grated zucchini and mini choc chips together, then folded them into the batter at the last minute. I was doubtful that the 1 teaspoon sodium bicarb would actually be sufficient to raise the pourable batter ... I was mistaken! This is a totally delicious, moist, chocolatey bread/cake which is not sickly-sweet or too rich. The choc chips are well-distributed in the cake, which has a very pleasant thin sweet crust on the top. YUM! Next time I make it (which will be soon!) I'll use half wholemeal flour, cut the oil and sugar a little more and add another half cup or so of zucchini ...

Fantastic and easy to make.  i also subbed the melted chocolate for the cocoa measurements, subbed the applesauce for the oil.  I checked after 45 min, and it was done already!

Made this for my husband to take to work as a treat for his group.  He said they gobbled it up.  Next time I make it, I will probably increase the bake time or temperature to assure it is thoroughly baked on top.

I've used this recipe for over a year now; today my youngest requested it for "share bread" day at school.  It is a great way to use up x-tra zucchini from the garden.  Sometimes I substitute white chocolate chips for semisweet.

What a tasty bread!!  My sister made this for Thanksgiving and it was gone in 1 day. Everyone loved it! She did substitute applesauce for most of the oil to make it lower in fat.  It was moist and  delicious.

This didn't really "wow" us at all.  In fact, I've had better store-bought baked goods.  Unless you've just got more zucchini than you know what to do with, make brownies instead!  For all the fat and calories of this bread, you'll get a lot more chocolate-bang for your buck!

My family thought this was the best.  I made extra loaves and gave them to my neighbors and got rave reviews.  A great way to use up zucchini from the garden. I did use mini chocolate chips and had no problem.

OMG!!! This was the best zucchini bread I have ever made!  It was soooo moist.  I did not have regular chocolate chips, but I used chocolate chunks, instead.  Perfect for the chocolate lover!  A friend of ours was visiting when I baked and took the entire second loaf home!  I will definately make again & again!

I doubled the recipe to make two loaves. I might have added a bit more oil. They were so moist, that the consistency was more like a holiday or English pudding. I was so worried they were under-baked but they received rave reviews. The people asked for the recipe. A win!

I made the recipie but my sister is gluten free and I'm vegan. Everything was the same except I used gluten free flour, I made flax egg to replace regular eggs, and my household doesnt like oil so I replaced that will dairy free yogurt. I accidently used spicy chocolate too, but it turned out really great. Definitely would make it again!!

I made it exactly as printed. I must say I was disappointed. My opinion is that I should be able to follow the recipe exactly and have it turn out correctly. Well, the chips fell to the bottom, they stuck to the pan and, of course, overcooked. When a recipe site publishes a recipe, I don't feel I should have to read thru countless reviews to find out HOW to make it turn out right.  Actually, i dont have time to do that. The top 3/4 that did come out of the pan tasted great. I will make it again, knowing what others have said to make it correctly.

Very very good bread.  As per others suggestions, I increased to 2 1/2 cups of zucchini and 1 cup sour cream.  It's a chocolately goodness.  I baked 60 minutes.  It didn't rise a lot but it is very good!

This was fantastic....You wouldn't know that zucchini was in the batter it totally disappeared. I used 1/2c apple sauce and 1/2c olive oil and simi sweet dark chocolate.
 Will make again.

If you're not a very skilled baker, and I am not, this recipe is a little tough to get right. The hard part is getting the melted chocolate to blend nicely into  the batter that is a lower temperature.

While mine was nice and moist there was barely any chocolate taste unless we bit into a chocolate chip. Disappointing since the whole idea of me making this was for the chocolate taste.
I even added a little cocoa powder to it.
Maybe I'll go and look into the zucchini chocolate brownies someone mentioned.

Fantastic recipe!  After reviewing the comments, I added a cup of sour cream and about a tablespoon of cocoa powder in addition to the other ingredients.  There was plenty of batter for two full loaf pans.  Both pans disappeared very, very quickly!

This was great! It disappeared very quick! 
 My only swap was 2 tablespoons the dark cocoa powder instead of the unsweetened chocolate.

Super easy to make! Flavourful and moist, although I would add more cinnamon. I'm going to try adding allspice, cloves, nutmeg and pumpkin seeds for an Autumn flavour. I also made a sour cream glaze....DELISH!

Instead of  2 oz unsweetened chocolate- I used 2TBLS oil and 2 TBLSP Hershey's cocoa.  I also used thin spiraled  Zucchini. So, we will see!!!

Great recipe! Added 2 TBS cocoa powder, decreased sugar, increased zucchini. No news for sour cream, it is moist enough.

I love this recipe! I did put sour cream in one batch and then none in the 2nd batch both were great. This last batch I did as muffins, super yummy.

I have made this bread many times and disappointed when it did not come out of the pan easily.  This time I greased the pan and then put parchment paper on the pan bottom and two long sides.  The bread came out of the pans beautifully.  
I used mini loaf pans, and I am sure larger pans would work too.  Very nice recipe.

I've made this twice. both times I reduced the sugar by about 1/3 and added more flour by about 1/3. it turned out great. I also didnt have to cook it as long as this said. I think it depends on the size of your pan, if the mix is deeper it will take longer to cook. I cooked it in a pyrex instead of a cake pan and it didnt take quite as long. I also like the suggestion to put in mini chocolate chips. I didnt have any unsweetened chocolate squares, so I melted butter, sugar and cocoa together instead.

Perfect chocolate bread!  I followed the recipe as is.  The second time I made this, I added some chopped walnuts and mini chocolate chips.  I also added 1/2 c applesauce and 1/2 c oil.  This is a winner!!

Zuchinni bread was great; I didn't make any changes but I'll add cocoa powder the next time I make it! I used PAM baking spray with flour and no problem sticking.

I would definitely make this again.  
I made it with 1-1/2c. sugar. I also put in 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. applesauce, and 1/2 c. sour cream.  I followed the reviews and coated my choc. chips with flour and folded the zucchini in before placing it in the oven. 
It didn't rise as much as some of the other breads I have made but, it was still really good.

I made it several times. Great recipe!  I did squeeze some of the liquid out of the zucchini after the first batch as it took longer than 60 minutes to cook. Flouring the chocolate chips was also a game changer.

Yummy! I replaced half of the oil with applesauce and because chocolate is sacred in my family - I added 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1 tbs of cocoa powder. I also followed the recommendations of others and mixed the chocolate chips in with the dry ingredients first and added the zuchinni very last after everything else had been mixed in. Otherwise no changes. 
My only note of caution - my loaves were done in 50 minutes instead of the 60-70 minutes recommended in the recipe. Thank you for the recipe!

This bread turned out so good! Super moist! My husband thinks it's fantastic. I made just a few small changes- added about 3/4 cup sour cream, 1T cocoa powder, a bit more zucchini, reduced the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 cups and used a full cup of chocolate chips (tossed with some flour). Thanks for the recipe!

Made this chocolate zucchini bread this morning 5/27/19 made a loaf and mini loafs. I added chopped walnuts to recipe, it was real chocolately and super moist, my family loved it. My daughter who don't like zucchini bread ask me would I make another one soon. Great recipe love it recommend to other to make if you love zucchini. Want to try the Apple, carrot next and the lemon one.

I can’t believe I’m saying this... but it may be too chocolatey for me. I prefer a little less sweet so next time I’ll decrease  the sugar.

Hello humans! I have to say i have had quite the time wit dis resipe. you see i have a capuchin monkey and he goes bannas for bannas so i went onto the interglatic web (i beleve thes is hwhat the humans call it) and aske. How to i make bannas for my pet monkey. The result pulled up  a respe for here resipe, now i when to de grocers pharmcey and bought hall de ingredents and came home to cook for me leetle monkey friend. You see i am quite clumsy and tripped on de way into my pod so i spit de bannas and day bursted in my faces!!!! Well monkey wasent home so decided to improvie. I when back to ask the intergaltic web "how do i make bannas for my pet monkey with out bannas?" dis here website poped into my veiw plane. I was over joyed. the resipe had called for some brom chunks called chukulate. I had dot herd of dis but my monkey had made some replaca of dis in the back yard i deciced to use dis instead.  After i used this resipe to create de "heathy alturnative" and i brought my monkey in. He ate dis and then died on de spot. Its tis alright though because i never really liked him anyway. So i when to the dead people store and bought him a coffin. I supose that is de tradtion her. And had a celbration in my room. Overall i hink this resope is a hit!!!

This was my first zucchini loaf, both making one and also the first time eating one. I don't want to be negative because I thought it was pretty good. However, it really is on the sweet side and I've been making a concerted effort to reduce my sugar/salt intake. I couldn't get one of the loaves out of the pan and I ALWAYS grease my baking pans. The one I decided to cut was crumbly so not a clean slice so I didn't submit a pic. One reviewer said she used sour cream and I might do that as well with the left over zucchini  I have in the freezer. Overall though, I liked the recipe and will make it again. I will submit or amend this rating if the next one turns out better.

My grandson and I loved this one!  I swapped the oil out for applesauce on a 1:1 ratio.  I also lined the pans with parchment paper as titis made the loaves easier to remove and plate.  These loaves freeze well.

Oh my gosh, just WOW! If I could give this recipe more stars I would. This is my first time making chocolate zucchini bread with the exception of one small change (unsweetened cocoa powder vs bar) I followed the recipe as directed. My son who is not a fan of zucchini said the only problem was is that I didn't make more. The only complication I ran into was the chocolate chip sticking slightly to the bottom of the pan so next time I will grease the pan more, and flour the chocolate chips. Fantastic overall and so moist!

So moist, so chocolatety, so delicious!  I made 3 mini loaves with this recipe. Froze 2 of them and even they are as good as the one that I didn’t freeze. I always add a heaping spoon of mayo to any batter-based recipe I make but wanted to try this as is and it was perfect!

Excellent Recipe.  I used some of the suggestions as adding cocoa powder to the dry ingredients.  I thought I greased the pan well, not so.  Nxt time I will do a better job.  Wonderful Product.

This is a great recipe! Very easy to make, lots of flavor, and people love it! I have taken this bread to work to share and my coworkers asked for the recipe, so of course I gave it to them! I prefer to skip the chocolate chips and add about 2 heaping TBS of cocoa powder for a richer chocolate flavor. It’s a great way to use up summer zucchini harvests!

Made this Chocolate Zucchini Bread this morning.  It came out OK, but not great like my regular Zucchini Bread recipe.  I'm at an altitude of almost 4800' so I'll need to make some adjustments.  Sunk in the middle and stuck to the bottom of the pans even though I greased the pans more than the recipe called for.  I'll add 1 tsp of Baking Powder next time, coat the mini chocolate chips in the flour or put them on top before baking them.  I'll add some chopped walnuts and I'll stir in the grated zucchini at end of mixing.  If anyone else has suggestions for high altitude baking, please let me know.

Oh, yummy!   I couldn't face another loaf of regular zucchini bread and I have a garden full of zucchini to use up.  I made my first batch this morning and I'm busy making another batch this afternoon.  I'm in big trouble now.

Great recipe!  And it was even better the second day.  Then it was all gone!!  Everyone loved it.  Made two loaves, gave some to friends.  It did not last long!  The only thing I changed was I used a cup of cinnamon applesauce because I didn't have vegetable oil and left out the teaspoon of cinnamon.

I made two changes, used 2/3 cup vegetable oil and 1/3 cup applesauce and when I split it between the bread pans I added 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips to one and 1/2 cup dark morsels to the other.  This was without a doubt one of the best breads I've every had.  It was so moist and flavorful.

I have been making this for years, even after the very first time I got rave reviews. As I've made this over and over, I have made some tweaks. I reduce the oil to 3/4 cup. If the zucchini is very wet, I wring out some of the moisture. I use a full cup of mini chocolate chips. If I want the bread to be extra chocolatey, I add 1/4 cup cocoa powder in addition to the chocolate called for in the recipe. Shredded yellow squash can reliably be used in place of the zucchini as well. I have used one or the other or a mix of both with no notable difference in flavor or quality. This recipe is a true winner, whether you make it as written or use my alterations.

SO GOOD! I used applesauce instead of oil. Like others, I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Rather than a loaf I made full size and mini muffins. Used mini chips instead of full sized.

Great recipe.  I used 1 1/2 cup sugar & increased chocolate chips to 1 cup.  Family & friends LOVED it.   One young friend   loved it,  hates squash but didn't know he'd ate some.  :D   Moist, chocolate and yummy.

I didn't have the squares of chocolate, so I substituted 3 TBS of cocoa + 1 TBS of canola oil per square.  I omitted the cinnamon, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I made muffins instead of loaves (the recipe made 27), and baked them at 325 degrees for 27-30 minutes.  After they cooled I topped them with vanilla (canned) frosting.  Everyone who had them, loved them!

This is a great recipe for chocoholics
 Chocolate plus vegies makes a win win Recipe.  I have made this multiple times according to the recipe. The only mandatory change I made was to grease and flour each pan. This made getting it out of the pan so much easier. I did add more chocolate chips and found cooking for 1 hr much better.
This is a great recipe!! So many people did not know it had zucchini in it.

I made two changes to this recipe and my kids loved it. I'm quite sure they would have loved it equally without the substitutions! What's not to love here? Chocolate? More chocolate? Moist and delicious! I'll make it over and over again. 
I substituted in half apple sauce for the oil amount, and half whole wheat flour for the white. Nobody was the wiser

Make that a 4-1/2 star rating! I used frozen zucchini (thawed, of course) with the liquid drained off. Cut sugar to 1-1/2 cups and used a full cup of chocolate chips mixed in with the dry ingredients as several people suggested. Heavily greased my one large and two small pans with Crisco shortening. No problem removing the bread after cooled. The small pan took as long as the larger one--about 40 minutes. Super tasting bread. Will be making it again and will be using fresh zucchini next time just to see if it makes a difference in taste or texture.

Wow! Excellent recipe. I changed a few things (used 3 oz. applesauce plus half cup sour cream and no eggs). Delicious.

The flavor was amazing but it was a little heavy and didn't rise much. I followed these modifications and added 1 cup sour cream, added a few tablespoons of cocoa to the dry ingredients and extra chocolate chips and extra zucchini. I also did what other reviewers suggest, and add the choc chips to the dry ingredients so they don't sink and it worked well.   Will try it again for sure, with a little less heavy ingredients.

I made a few changes - added 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa and reduced sugar by 1/4 cup. Substituted half of the oil for unsweetened applesauce. It was SO GOOD and you couldn't tell at all that some of the oil was missing. I will make again next time I have zucchini!

I did not make any changes in the receipt itself.  Yet,  I did   not bake it   in an oven at 350 degrees as suggested. I lowered the oven temperature to 250 and left it 70 minutes instead.

My family liked this a lot. I thought that it was an interesting new way to make zucchini bread. It tastes like German chocolate cake to me. It is very soft and moist.

I calculated the macronutrients based on the ingredients I used. I subbed the oil for 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce and I cut the sugar down to 1 and a half cups. Based on cutting into 20 slices, 10 slices per pan. 
Calories: 231 
Carbs: 31.5
Fat: 10.6g
Protein: 3.3g

Next time, I will leave out the chocolate chips (I'm not a fan but my family was, they can add some on top if they want), sub all the oil for applesauce, and cut sugar to 1 and a quarter cups. This will bring the nutrition to:
Calories: 128.5, Carbs: 25.4g, Fat: 2.6g, and Protein 2.7g

This is really good bread.  I made a few changes (only 1.5 cups of sugar and I replaced the cup of oil with a cup of unsweetened applesauce).  Next time, I will double the cinnamon (this was a whisper and I prefer a shout of cinnamon), add chopped pecans (because I love a little texture in my breads), and keep my other changes (reduced sugar and applesauce instead of oil).  I'll definitely make this again.

I'm not sure what I was expecting here, and I first I wasn't so excited about it - it wasn't a chocolate cake, but also wasn't a healthy bread. But then it started to grow on me. It's moist and flavorful, and the kids treat it like chocolate cake. If you're looking for something truly healthy, this isn't it, but this is a nutrition upgrade from regular chocolate cake. To make it healthier, replace half the oil with applesauce, cut the sugar to one and half cups, and use at least half (or even all) whole wheat flour.

This bread is so good! The chocolate chips are a must, they add so much moisture to the bread. I'll probably add more next time. I floured them too, and they didn't sink to the bottom, as other reviews said had happened.

Great recipe. I made a few adjustments based on some other reviews. I cut the sugar to 1 cup, added an additional tsp of baking soda and baked in a bundt pan for around 50 minutes. It rose perfectly, turned out moist and fluffy and tastes great!

I made it exactly as written, except I used white whole wheat flour, and mini chocolate chips rather than full-sized. (My chips DID sink to the bottom of the cake, so next time I will mix them with the dry ingredients, as one reviewer suggested.)  The flavor and texture were  fabulous - very moist and delicious.  The zucchini completely disappears, it tastes like a brownie - yum!

Loved it.  Used semi-sweet baking squares, that I had handy, and cut back a little on the sugar.  Substituted 1/2 cup of butter for 1/2 of the oil.  Baked in a 9x13 pan for 40 minutes.  Very moist, fluffy, and yummy!

Made mini loaves with this recipe. It was a hit to all I gave it to for gifts. Just like eating chocolate cake. So awesome! Only thing was that the chocolate chips that were on the bottom stuck to the pan and made if difficult to remove. Let cool completely. Wish I would have listened to the tips in the other reviews. I also used have the oil and used applesauce for the other half measurement. Will be a holiday gift giving staple from now on.

Great holiday treat!  2 regular loaves = 5 mini loaves.

Tips (for next year  when I make this again).
 - 1 medium zucchini = 2 cup of zucchini.
 - melt chocolate in large ceramic bowl, then, add - in the following order to ensure smooth chocolate mixture:  vegetable oil, eggs, sugar, vanilla, zucchini.  Add flour mixture slowly. Then, chips.  Add 1/2 cup extra chips when doubling recipe to make 10 mini loaves.  Be sure to allow the chocolate to cool so it does not cook eggs but mix with vegetable oil so no chucks or bits of chocolate float around.

I usually don't rate receipts I've tried online...many don't taste as good as they look however; I made muffins with this receipt. It was absolutely the best! I added 1/2 cup of walnuts. My son that doesn't eat cakes, pies or muffins loved it. I've made it twice in less than a month and will be making them again today on this cold Saturday.  The muffins were very flavorful, moist, light, moist,(oh did I repeat MOIST) and irresistible. You can't eat just one. They made about 18 med. sized muffins.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the bakers chocolate because we didn't have any. I substituted Hershey's cocoa and coconut oil for the chocolate. This was amazing! We made some into muffins and some into mini loaves of bread.

I had to review this, this is the best zucchini bread/dessert that I've ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly, no changes needed.  This was excellent and everyone in my family loved it.  Not too sweet and was very moist and springy.

First batch was excellent!  
Second & Third batch sank in the middle.  I used exactly the same ingredients.  Third batch I used 1/4 baking powder and it still sank in the middle. I wish someone would tell me what they think the problem is.

I made minimal changes:  First, I substituted unsweetened apple sauce for all of the oil.   Second, I added walnuts.   I used silicone bread pans  and baked for 75 minutes.    They came out of the pans with ease and perfect form.   Mmmm.

I have made this bread several times and it is a big hit! I found if you grease and flour the pan they will come out perfectly. Also, I have made them in muffin form to share at work.

I have made this several times now!  We love it following the recipe exact and following  some of the suggestions from other reviewers! I think I love it most with a cup of sour cream and mini chocolate chips! It's a cross between  brownies and chocolate cake! My kids ask for it all the time! Oh, I also usually use cocoa powder as that is what I most often have on hand! I use the substitution suggested on the can for the chocolate! Very good!

This delight gets 2 thumbs up every time I serve it. Parchment paper is the key. This bread is SO moist, it tends to stick to the bottom, the sides loosen easily, but line the bottom with parchment and you have moist, chocolatey perfection every time.

Just made this and it's fabulous! Followed true recipe but upped by a 1/4 the amount of chocolate chips and cinnamon just because of personal preference. Also made cupcakes instead of loaves, reducing baking time to 45 min. They were done perfectly. Made 2 ½ dozen.

I've been making this recipe for many years and it's our favorite zucchini bread recipe.  This is my second time reviewing it, only to say that I finally tried substituting cocoa powder for the melted chocolate squares, and it turned out just as good. I found this to save a bit of time and make the recipe even easier.

I made it with a few tweaks only added 1and 1/3 cup of sugar 2 is alot and unnecessary. I also skipped the chocolate chips and used cocoa power instead of baking chocolate. Again makes me feel less guilty about eating the whole loaf before my hubby gets home ;) this recipe turns out great everytime!

I love this recipe and have made several times. I rarely have baking chocolate on hand so I substitute cocoa powder/butter 3:1 (Tablespoons). I love almond extract and will add 1 tsp  as well and if i have the extra i will up the chocolate chips to 1 cup.  Otherwise I leave the receipe as is. One suggestion to avoid sticking on the pan is to put a layer of parchment paper along the bottom...then spray with cooking spray. No problems then!

Delicious! I followed a few other suggestions including using mini chocolate chips and generously greasing the pans, but followed exactly otherwise. It was so tasty immediately after baking, but seemed even more moist and delicious after being wrapped in plastic wrap and aluminum foil for a couple of hours. This will be a regular for us!

It tasted fine, but it didn't raise, in fact it sunk in the middle. I might try adjusting the flour for the high altitude.

Really good and moist. I baked mine for 60 mins at 350, and I should have done 55 mins. I don't know this oven well enough yet, so lesson learned. Choc chips fell to the bottom, I would take others' advice more to heart and REALLY grease the bottom of the pan (like grease and flour) because mine stuck to the bottom. Otherwise, dynamite recipe!

Made this over the weekend but did make a couple of changes.  I used 1 cup of butter instead of vegetable oil, which I think helps to make it rise a little higher.  I also used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar which, along with the cinnamon, helps to give it a little more flavor.  I grated and then pulsed the zucchini in the Cuisinart. Came out perfect and very moist and my family and coworkers enjoyed it!  Will definitely make it again.

You have got to make this! My zucchini are growing so well this year and after returning from vacation, I had a very large zucchini that I harvested and was perfect for baking. After finding this recipe, I knew I had to try it. Truly amazing! So moist and flavourful. I did follow the suggestions and modifications that were pointed out in the review by "missy" and it truly is perfect! Nothing but "mmmm" came out of my husband's and children's mouths while they were devouring this. :) One other modification I made was using 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips.

This recipe is great as a bundt cake. It is very moist and delicious. I added some orange zest.  Great way to hide zucchini from those who claim not to like it.

While this recipe tastes great I found it hard to get out of the pan. I would recommend lining the bottom with parchment paper to get out of the pan easily.

I made this and thought it was delicious! I used 3 tbsp cocoa powder and 1 tbsp butter because I didn't have the cocoa squares and subbed applesauce for half of the oil because I didn't realize I was short until I started mixing everything together. I had mini chocolate chips and didn't flour them and didn't have any problems with them sinking or sticking to the bottom. My toddler loved it, too!

My family loves this recipe.  Perusing the reviews, I also add 3/4 to 1 cup sour cream to the recipe and add 2 TBS. of cocoa.  I also only use 1/4 cup of oil and then add 3/4 cup of unsweetened/natural applesauce to the recipe to cut the fat.

I made this bread for my adult Sunday school class and for work and it was wonderful!  They ask me to make it again every week.  I didn't have the chocolate squares so I used a four oz bar of Bakers german sweet chocolate and instead of the chocolate chips (didn't have those either) I used one cup of Ghirardelli white chocolate chips.  Everything else as listed.  Excellent!!! Thanks for posting this recipe.

BEST ZUCCHINI BREAD EVER!!
However, I still had problems with the chocolate chips sinking ALL the way to the bottom, even after flouring them.  It took an hour and a half just about to cook, but it was worth it!  If there is a way to keep the chocolate chips from sinking to the bottom, I'd love to know what it is!  Love this recipe, got requests to make it again and again.

I made half the recipe (just one loaf pan), baked for 45-50min, and replaced some egg with banana. It is super moist. I would call it cake instead of bread. Delicious!!

Best quick bread recipe ever! I only add the chocolate chips to the top after its in the loaf pan. This way they dont sink down too far when cooking and stick to the bottom of the pan.

I made the recipe exactly as is, and it was great.  I spiralize zucchini a lot (for noodles) and I was bothered with the amount  of waste.  So throughout the week I put "scraps" in a bag and decided to make a bread.  This was a great splurge.  Lots of sugar and oil, but a nice, tasty splurge and good use of the zucchini scraps.

So good! I always harvest more zucchini than we can eat, so I'll shred it and freeze it and then make zucchini bread year round! (Just squeeze out excess water)I made this for church and everyone was raving about it! You can never go wrong with chocolate and since there is veggies in in, it's good for you, right? ;)

So yummy! Even though I accidentally only put one ounce of unsweetened chocolate instead of two it was still delicious! I baked it for 60 minutes and that was slightly too much so next time I will back off on the time a little.  I will definitely make this again!

Everyone said it was a wonderful "cake like" zucchini bread, so I decided to put it in a 9x13 pan! Folded in the zucchini  just before I poured it into the greased 9x13 pan, then sprinkled the chocolate chips and chopped walnuts on top. I used 6 TBSP of cocoa and 2 TBSP of butter instead of chocolate, applesauce in place of oil, a little less than 3 cups of zucchini and half brown sugar, half white. I baked it for about 45 minutes. It didn't stick to the pan and the chips and walnuts stayed where they should. This came out soooo delicious! When my family came home, half of it was gone in about 10 minutes!!! Thanks so much for such an awesome recipe!

This is SOOOO GOOD! I had a giant 40-cent zucchini from the farm stand so I did a double batch. Made 24 muffins, 24 mini-muffins and 1 loaf out of it.  (And I STILL have 1/3 of the zucchini left!) I used reviewers tips and subbed 1/2 oil w/unsweetened apple sauce, did 50/50 whole wheat/white flours, 50/50 white/turbinado sugars AND cut sugar down to 1.5C (still plenty sweet), and did 50/50 zuke/banana because I had a bunch of brown bananas. I was 1oz short on unsweetened baker's chocolate so I used the 3T cocoa/1T butter sub another reviewer mentioned and it worked great. Mini choc chips folded in last didn't sink to bottom. Greased pans really well and had no sticking problems. Definitely a keeper: my kids loved them and asked me to make the recipe again - and OFTEN!

Really sweet, and really good! I doubled the zucchini, used dark chocolate (chips and baking), used 2.5 cups of old fashioned oats in place of the flour, and used 3 mashed bananas in place of the oil. Next time, I'll cut the sugar by half to decrease the sweetness. I also baked mine in muffin tins for portion control. I'll definitely make these again!

Super moist and chocolate-y.  I used added 1/2 cup sour cream and used shredded punchini (hybrid zucchini pumpkin).  Kids loved it, I loved it.  Thumbs up!

Loved this recipe.  I made it as written the first time...fabulous.  Wanted to lighten it up the 2nd time.  Still fabulous...couldn't tell the difference.  I doubled the recipe...changes I made - used 1 cup coconut oil (melted)/1/2 c. applesauce/1/2 c. vegetable oil, 3 total cups of sugar (should have been 4 with the doubled recipe), added 3 T. of cocoa powder and doubled the zucchini (8 cups total).  Turned out amazing!!!

Took one loaf to a potluck and one to work. No leftovers. I do not like to make adjustments to a recipe before trying it, however I would definitely replace some of the oil with applesauce next time. Too oily for my taste. I did line the bottom of my pans with parchment paper and did flour the chocolate chips. No issues.

Wow. This was great!!  I sprayed a dish with coconut oil and powdered it with cocoa powder.  The cake released beautifully.  Subbed butterscotch morsels instead of chocolate chips. Dusted with powdered sugar. TASTED LIKE A MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE.

I trimmed the sugar by 1/2 c, but in the end I found it not quite as chocolatey as I'd hoped.  Still quite good though! I lined the pans with parchment, btw.

It's a tasty bread. I was happy to have a use for my zucchini! The kids were happy with this recipe even with the small changes I made.
I made the changes not so much for health but from a lack of enough ingredients! I omitted one egg, I substituted half the sugar for granular stevia, and omitted the chocolate chips. I added 1/3 cup of cocoa, and a little more of the bakers chocolate. I used semi sweet bakers chocolate. Baked this as 20 muffins, at 325 F for 28 minutes. The kids were asking for seconds so you know they've past that test! Thanks, yummy!

This is so amazing! my best yet! I added 1/2 cup sour cream and 3TBL of cocoa powder, as recommended in other reviews. I baked it as a cake in a 9x13 pan and cooked it for 30 minutes, came out perfectly moist and soft! I already have people asking for the recipe :)

This recipe is so heavenly - I don't know if I like this better than Chocolate Zucchini cake - this recipe is worth making.

I made this twice in the past 2 weeks. Once as bread and once in a bundt cake pan. I didn't have the squares of chocolate so I used 6 Tbsp. of cocoa and a little extra oil. I used 2-3 teaspoons of cinnamon and a tsp. of baking powder. I used mint chocolate chips and an extra 1/2 cup of flour and added and extra cup of zucchini at the end to prevent the chips from sinking. It worked out well. I also coated the pans with sugar as well. This is decadent. Everyone loves it.

YUM YUM YUM! This is sooo good! I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and instead of vegetable oil (never use it), I used coconut oil (which I use in pretty much everything). Since I cut the sugar, I add a little more chocolate chips (just like I do in my choc chip cookies =). I did not have a problem with my chips sinking. I also added a half cup more zucchini. I could not find my other loaf pan, so I used my angel food cake pan and just put all the batter in there. This was a delicious treat!

Very nice texture and moistness. I think I'll try it without the cinnamon next time.Flavor  too strong  for the chocolate.  The chocolate chips sank to the bottom so maybe try
the mini chips next time. There will be a next time, definitely a recipe to play with.

The flavor of this bread is very yummy!  I didn't change a thing and my family loved it.  The bread stuck to the pans even though I greased the pans A LOT, so I (like other readers) highly recommend really greasing your pans well or adding a light dusting of flour to the grease in the pan.  I had an abundance of zucchini this year and made several loaves of this bread to freeze and my husband declared them to be "hunting season grub", so it's pretty much husband approved!

Flavor is absolutely delicious. You couldn't see or taste the zucchini. I added pecans (didn't have walnuts). I also used 1/2 cup of cocoa because I didn't have melting chocolate. It was almost too moist, and i may try cutting back on the oil next time.  Had to let it sit for a long time before I could cut it without it falling apart.  Definitely thumbs up!

Used sour cream and extra zucchini as another reviewer suggested.  Would definitely make it again though would reduce the amount of sugar used.  Our favourite chocolate chips are quite sweet already!

Amazingly delicious! The taste and texture are perfect! The only changes I made were substituting half the oil with applesauce and half the flour with whole wheat. This recipe is a keeper!

To be fair... I did change it a lot per some of the other reviews. I felt like it tasted more like a cake than bread at the end. BUT IT WAS GOOD!  

I added a cup of sour cream to the wet ingredients because I hate it when bread comes out dry and sour cream always makes it more moist.

I added two tablespoons of cocoa powder to the dry ingredients to make it a bit more chocolaty.

I cut down the sugar so a little over 1 1/2 cups. I think next time I will do less. Maybe a little more than a cup.  The sugar makes it very cake like.

i used mini chocolate chips and did have a small sinkage problem.  I think it was because the sour cream made it even more runny that it already was!  And I used the whole bag :O  I know.  I didn't read the directions so I just dumped it in, haha.  It was VERY chocolaty haha. But SUPER tasty that way.  

So the bread came out crazy moist because of the sour cream I think.  Spray you pans crazy good. Both my loafs ripped.

I bet it is good as written too.  I love the kick the cinnamon gives it!

I have an old recipe for this but decided to give this one a try. One ingredient I can not leave out when making zucchini bread is ground cloves! It really enhances the chocolate flavor in any recipe! I did like this recipe, it came out most, not overly sweet. My recipe is slightly  different..replace half the oil with unsweetened applesauce or cut the sugar down and use sweetened applesauce and of course, the ground cloves!

I followed the directions pretty much exactly, except I put it in a sheet cake pan rather than loaves. It tastes great, but it has a slightly strange, kind of sharp, smell. It's not overly unpleasant, and it doesn't affect the taste. I've never made a zucchini bread before, so maybe that's just one of the side affects (or maybe just the zucchinis I used). Either way, still a great recipe!

Delicious!  Sticking is a problem but Pam for baking works great. I also put the chips on top of the batter and then gently swirl them in before baking. This seems to work the best. I Cannot keep the bread around when I bake it. :-)

This is a great recipe.  I get lots of compliments but I have made some changes to make it more diabetic and low fat conscious.  I added 3/4 cups of lite sour cream, added an extra cup of zucchini, I substitute the sugar with 3/4 brown sugar splenda and l/2 cup reg sugar, I added 1/2 cup of apple sauce and only put in 1/2 oil. I was also worried about how chocolatey it would be so I added 1/4 cup of cocoa.  Very good and very moist.

Very Good! Some reviewers had trouble getting the bread out of the pan. When you take the pans out of the oven, place them on their side for about 5 minutes until the bread pulls away from the side, and then flip the pans over and do the same for the other side. I cut the sugar back to about 1 1/3 cups and it was still good, I replaced all the oil with applesauce (for a more healthy alternative). I added the chocolate chips to the flour mixture (stir around) and then mixed all that into the liquid, and I did not have any trouble with the chips sinking to the bottom.

This bread tasted good, but the bottom stuck to bottom of the pan, even after greasing generously. If I was planning to serve it to guests I would have been very peeved. As well, I used defrosted grated zucchini and it was still a little cold when I added it to the chocolate and eggs and the melted chocolate solidified- I think cocoa powder would have worked better to give it a more consistent chocolate taste and colour.

Wow! The zucchini really does disappear completely in this. There is NO discernable texture from it, and we could only see a little green from the peel. Since others said their bread stuck, I used Baker's Joy, a spray with flour in it meant to help cakes release easily. I made muffins out of it (in my pans that are NOT non-stick anymore), and they fell right out when I tipped the pans over. That is definitely the way to go!

Like others, I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups (which was perfect) and substituted 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 c. of the oil. I used 6 T. cocoa for the 2 squares of chocolate, because that's what I had. If I had made them as the recipe was written, they would have been moister and even more wonderful (but more fattening, too). The recipe made 24 cupcakes, which I baked at 375 for 14-15 minutes.

This is a very tasty recipe.  I added more zucchini, closer to 3 cups.  Added some powdered cocoa for extra chocolate (about 2tbsp), and added about 1/2 c plain Greek yogurt.  Also doubled chocolate chips.  Super moist.  Did 1/2 as muffins (good for school lunches) and other 1/2 in loaf pan.  Muffins took 20 min on convect.

Loved this!! I changed a few things though. I used namaste brown rice flour  instead of white flour, coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and stevia instead of sugar.  For a healthier version. Amazing!!

This was yummy!! I did add 1 cup of sour cream. I also used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup homemade peach apple sauce (recipe found on allrecipes.com) instead of the 1 cup oil it asks for; the apple sauce has a lot of cinnamon in it so I didn't add it to the dry ingredients. I also added 1TBL of cocoa powder. 

I just sprayed my pans with Pam. I think it will be easier to get out of the pan if I dust it with powder sugar after I oil the pan.

Wow is this good!  I was so excited when this was emailed to me I made it right away after reading the reviews.  They were right, this is super moist, delicious and tastes like eating chocolate cake!

I didn't melt the 2 oz of chocolate and mix it in. Otherwise I followed as is. The bread stuck to the pan but is delicious!

This is the first time I have ever made zucchini bread so I decided to try a chocolate recipe, b/c everyone likes chocolate!I used 3TBSP of cocoa Powder and 1 TBSP of butter in place of unsweetened chocolate. I used 2 of my larger loaf pans (not sure what size)-but split batter between the pans and placed in the oven. i checked them part way thru cooking and noticed they were not rising much at all! Then I realized the 2 cups each of Flour and sugar, had only total 1C each b/c i had been using the 1/2 Measuring spoon! cooked for 55min and they were chocolatey and fudgey and still eatable.

I felt this recipe called for a lot of sugar. Instead of the 2 cups it called for I added 1 3/4. I had never made it before and didn't want to change too much initially. Having sampled them with the slightly reduced amount now, I will reduce even further next time.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour in place of all purpose white. The recipe is definitely a keeper. Everyone in my house loved them, just a bit too sweet for my taste.

Delicious. I would highly recommend, however, topping the loaves with chocolate chips. They'll sink to the bottom, and man alive--they do NOT want to come off the bottom of the pan! So, top away, and the loaves will come out fine. Added about 3/4 C of sour cream. Mm mm good. :)

Add a tbsp of cocoa and grease and flour the pans instead of just grease. Or use parchment paper. Put the chocolate chips on top not folded in.

This was an excellent recipe. I used gluten free flour and substituted coconut sugar in place of the white sugar. I made muffins and baked for 20 minutes. Very moist and delicious.

The bread was delicious! I added a couple of bananas, skipped the chocolate chips and eliminated 1/2 a cup of the sugar and it turned out perfect. I used medium aluminum baking pan creating 3 loaves. Cooked for approximately 50 minutes. This recipe is a keeper!!

Gooooooooood God! AMAZING! This is the first time I have ever made zucchini bread and this recipe was easy to make. I have actually made this twice in the past two weeks it's so easy and delicious. It's the perfect amount of chocolaty. I rolled the chips in flour the second time as I read in other reviews and it did help to prevent them from sinking to the bottom. Did I mention that it is extremely moist as well?!

I've been making this recipe for years with no changes. It's what I always use for my extra zucchini. I use silicone bread pans and find it doesn't stick as much as a regular pan and comes out nicely with no greasing.

This is an absolute favorite recipe--everybody loved it and loved it even more after i told them it was a zucchini bread and wasn't a straight-up brownie!  I have now baked this more than a handful of times (thanks to being over run with zucchini from the garden) and each time it turns out fantastic!  I recently made them into muffins and they were fantastic!

I did make a few changes to the original recipe...  I only used 1.5c of white sugar and I used 1c coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil.

  I'd made a different chocolate zucchini bread and it was just too chocolatey for my tastes--this one is just right!  It is just chocolatey enough but not overpowering!  

I also line my pans with release foil and they just slide right out!

I would not make this recipe again.  I followed the recipe to a T.  The flavor was wonderful but could not get it out of the pan and all the chips sank to the bottom. That was the problem.  If is ever made it again -- would probably not add the chips.  I also tried to make muffins and they too stuck.  I had a mess. __ Donna

Made this and my very picky 3 year old has devoured a whole loaf in 2 days. I did not have any chocolate baking squares so I used a melted Lindt chocolate bar and reduced the amount of sugar I added. It turned out great. Will be making it again this week.

Made this bread Sunday to take to the cook out on Monday (Memorial Day).  I took the advise to add 1 cup sour cream to make the bread more moist and added coconut and chopped pecans (because in my family there is nothing that can't be made better by adding coconut and pecans).  My older brother (who can't stand zucchini) ate this bread like candy!!!  I still haven't told him it is a zucchini bread... It is a big hit and a real keeper!
Thank you for posting this recipe!

Thanks missy I just made this recipe and added the changes like you suggested (sour cream and cocoa)
The end result was a big winner in chocolate taste moisture and like you I added more chocolate chips.
For sure this one is making my family recipe book and I will make it  again  and pass it on to my friends.
Just the best I ever made This would make a great gift to all chocolate lovers??

I made this bread for a party and it was a huge hit. Everyone was asking for the recipe. Bonus: if I slice it up my child thinks he is eating a brownie, and while I wouldn't exactly call this a healthy recipe, with the zucchini in it I feel like it's at least slightly better for him than other sweets. Great way to use up the inside of a hollowed-out zucchini after making stuffed zucchini.

My family loves this recipe. I make it exactly as written with one exception- I don't have the unsweetened choc on hand so use a piece of melted chocolate bar. Our 10 & 15 yr old love it knowing it has zucchini in it. Our 16 year old wouldn't touch zucchini with a 10 ft pole so we told him it's Chocolate Chip Cinnamon Bread..he gobbles it up!

EASY to make, moist, chocolatey and looks exactly like the photo. Makes two beautiful full size 8x4 inch loaves; when baked in 9x5 inch pans, loaves looked too small. Made 4 loaves in one day - the first time I did not have two 1-ounce squares of the unsweetened chocolate so I just used one 1-oz. square and it was totally fine.  I cut the amount of salt in half for health reasons (using just 1/2 teaspoon) and omitted the cinnamon due to personal taste; also, since I did not have regular size chocolate chips I substituted mini chips which got "lost" in the batter, so I do think using regular size chips is a better idea. Only needed to bake each batch for 55 minutes at 350 degrees, certainly not 60-70 minutes as recipe states. Will make again and add walnuts on top for some crunch.

I love this recipe.  I already made 2 chocolate breads and came back to make more.  It is very chocolatey and moist.  I did do what someone else said to do and that's do 1/2 veg oil and 1/2 applesauce.

I followed the recipe, except I substituted cocoa powder + oil in place of the squares, I don't have any on hand. It tastes good, but I feel like there should be more of a chocolate flavor, I might add more chocolate next time. I will be making again though!

This was delicious! The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar--one cup was perfect. I had planned to substitute applesauce for some of the oil, but I didn't have any on hand, so I'll try that next time. I had no trouble with the bread sticking to the pans; I used nonstick pans sprayed with baking spray (the kind with flour in it), and the loaves popped right out.

the batter was very runny and soupy. I added another cup of flour. It also was not chocolatey enough for me. I added 1/2 cp cocoa and 1/2 cp of semi-sweet chocolate chips.

Excellent as written! This time I had a bunch of rhubarb in my garden, thought  "why not?". I used 3 cups of rhubarb finely chopped in my food processor, let it sit with 2 small boxes of cherry jello mixed in, for about 5 minutes. Added 1 cup of plain yogurt (the rhubarb didn't seem as 'wet' as the zucchini did). Followed the rest of the recipe. OMG!!! Chocolate cherry bread!!! My rhubarb hating boyfriend and son have no idea there's rhubarb in it. I'm not telling them...

Loved this recipe! I did as BASSANGEL suggested and cut the sugar to 1&1/2 cups, used half wheat, and half white flour, and applesauce for half the oil. Also used mini-chocolate chips. The second time I made it I had semi-sweet baking squares on hand so used those instead of the unsweetened chocolate. Both ways are delicious though my sweet tooth preferred the semi-sweet way.  Would definitely not recommend the full amount of sugar with the semi-sweet chocolate though. It's not even needed when using the unsweetened chocolate. Both times I've made this, I have had 4 cups of shredded zucchini so made double batches. I got three small loaves and 4 mini-loaves out of it. My only issue is the bread sticking to the pans when removing it.  Will grease the pans myself next time and not let the kids do it. Maybe that will help. P.S. the kids love it too!

This bread was a success at my house.  It turned out to be moist and chocolatey.  My daughter and her friend, who apparently hates everything, couldn't stop eating it.
Although I normally follow a recipe exactly as written on the first try, I couldn't bring myself to add 2 full cups of sugar and reduced  the amount to just over 1 cup.  The result was still a very sweet bread and I could probably reduce the amount even more.  Two cups would have been way too much and made it overly sweet, which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. The semi sweet chocolate chips add more than enough sweetness to justify reducing the sugar.
Also, it only took 55 minutes cooking time

WOW, I just made theses and they are AMAZING. I am usually pretty sceptical about ratings on these type of things, but holy cow, they are all correct.

I made a few of the adjustments like others suggested for my first try.  I switched out the oil for apple sauce, but I was just a tiny bit short of 1 cup apple sauce, so I just topped it up with oil and only used 1 cup sugar and 4 Tbs of cocoa instead of the choc.  I also added some walnuts.  These are soooooo moist and tender.  Have already printed it to save and on my way out for mor apple sauce to make a few more batches.

This was deliciously chocolatey, wonderfully moist. The cinnamon was a great addition. I accidentally used best for bread flour but it didn't have any negative effect. This is a wonderful treat! thanks for the recipe Diane!

Awesome bread! I also put in only 1 and a 1/2 cups of sugar, as well as 1/2 cup applesauce in place of half of the oil and it turned out great- moist and chocolatey! 60 minutes was the perfect amount of time for my loaves, in glass pans.

This recipe will be in my family forever! By far the best chocolate zucchini bread I have tried yet! I did not have the bakers chocolate so I substituted with 3 tbs. cocoa and 1 tbs. oil and also sprinkled chopped pecans and white chocolate chips on top before putting in the oven! My only problem is that I can not bake enough loaves to give to friends...we eat it up faster than I can get them baked!

way to healthy (but yummy) as written so I used only whole wheat flour, all applesauce instead of oil and cut back on the sugar a little and it turned out really well.  I only used cocoa (3 tbs) instead of chocolate because that is what I had.  I will try cutting the sugar back even more next time and see if my kids notice.

I made this as muffins and they were beautiful, moist, and delicious!  I substituted whole wheat flour for all of the white flour, unsweetened applesauce for 3/4 cup of the oil, and coconut oil for the remaining 1/4 cup vegetable oil.  I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and they were plenty sweet enough.  I also added 3 Tbsp cocoa because they were just a little less chocolaty than we'd like.  Wonderful!!

I make this recipe as written every year when zucchini is in season.  My only change is to make 24 muffins and use the rest of the batter for one mini loaf.  I bake muffins for 25 minutes and the mini-loaf for 50 minutes.

Delicious BUT both loaves stuck to the bottom of professional baking pans even after I read another review about extra grease (I used Crisco).  I even ran a knife along the sides.  The first loaf fell out in two pieces with 1/3 stuck to the bottom.  On the second loaf, I ran a pancake turner underneath and got most out.  I will make this again but I'll line the pans with quick release foil.  NOTE:  I used semisweet chocolate since that is what I had on hand.  The bread reminds me of a moist brownie.

In looking for a chocolate chip zucchini bread I picked this because it has the most star rating and many more reviews than the other bread recipes.  I am not disappointed.  I did do a few modifications simply due to not having the squares of unsweetened chocolate.  I used about half regular baking cocoa and half dutch processed cocoa (as I didn't have enough regular).  I didn't add the oil typically needed when using cocoa powder instead of squares.  I also went a bit shallow on the oil as I thought a cup too much with the moisture the zucchini will create.  Next time I will decrease the oil to probably 3/4 cups.  With the dutch cocoa this ranks right up there with Starbucks chocolate cinnamon bread!!!!

Upon reading other reviews...I used half oil and half applesauce, cut down sugar slightly, used half whole wheat flour, increased the amount of zucchini slightly and used mini choco-chips.  Used mini loaf pans, so the baking tie was decreased.  All three kiddos under the age 7 loved it and the hubby loved it too! A "dessert" I feel better about serving!

LOVED this recipe! But I did tweak it a bit as I'm on Weight Watchers and wanted to make it a lower-calorie/point way.  I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 applesauce (unsweetened), dropped the sugar to 1 1/2 cups (may even try to do 1 1/4 on the next one), used 1 egg and the rest liquid egg whites.  Tasted amazing and everyone raved about it! I also didn't have 2 loaf pans so I followed the tip of another reviewer and made it in a bundt pan (baked at same temp for 70 mins).  Definitely making this again!!

Very good!  Very chocolatey without being overly sweet.  As far as Zucchini  breads go, the blueberry zucchini bread from this site is my hands down favorite but this is delicious as an after dinner treat or it would be a fabulous addition to a brunch spread!

My family and friends loved this recipe.  They could not believe that it had zuchini in it.  I did make a couple of changes. I used this recipe as the base for a banana walnut chocolate zuchini bread.  Will make again and again.

Delicious!  This are a great snack for school.  I made them in muffin tins.  As suggested in previous reviews, I used sour cream, the cocoa/butter combo instead of chocolate, and apple sauce instead of oil.  I omitted the chocolate chips & cinnamon, and added some powdered flax.  I will make this again soon.  The whole family loves them.

This truly is a great recipe. I couldn't keep my 4yr old out of the batter! I am avoiding Sugar,  Grains and vegetable oil, so I made a few changes and it still tasted awesome. With these changes there is truly no guilt, and great fiber!

In place of Sugar: 1/2 cup Xylitol + 1/4 tsp pure Stevia powder.
In place of Vegetable Oil: 1/2 cup butter (melted) + 1/2 cup applesauce.
For Flour: 1/2 cup flax meal, + 1 cup swifted coconut flour, + 1 scoop plain protein powder.
Did not add chocolate chips. 

Reduce oven temp to 325 degrees and leave in the full 70 minutes. 
Batter will be thick. In fact, I would highly recommend it for muffins. Still cook at 325 to keep from browning, but reduce cooking time to desired moisture level.

This was great and I also tweeked it to fit my likes. I added juice  and zest from an orange. Cooked it a little less for moisture content. Although next time I will try the sour cream alternative. Excellent flavor, thanks so much....

Very moist and a nice flavor (I used milk choc. chips---don't like semi-sweet), but I had much the same problems ronboyle had. The bread I made came out a little taller, but the batter was on the thin side and the bottom of both loaves stuck to the pan. A lot of the chips were at the bottom, even though I coated them with a small amount of flour before adding them to the batter. I'm wondering what changes I could make in the recipe amounts to get better results.

I never tried to make zucchini bread before this recipe. It was extremely fudgy and moist. My kids enjoyed it and were undeterred by the hint of green in among the chocolate. To that end, I would probably shred the zucchini smaller next time. Delicious!

Delicious, Moist, would definitely make again.  I halved the recipe, put in slightly less oil and sugar because I added in chocoloate chunks instead of the chips and some walnuts.  Still very tasty.

Really, really great stuff. I subbed 6 tbsp cocoa powder and 2 tbsp coconut oil for the chocolate squares, whole wheat pastry flour instead of white flour, and raw cane sugar instead of white... worked great, absolutely delicious! Thanks for giving me a way to use up all this zucchini!

This bread was delicious, after I made some changes to it. One thing that I like is clear directions, and the melted chocolate is not something you can mix into a cold batter without it hardening as mixed in. On the plus side, it does melt again when baking. I substitued the oil with fat free yogurt, did 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup packed Splenda Brown Sugar Baking Blend. I also added 2 heaping tbsp. of cocoa powder, and did 1 1/2 tsp. baking soda. This definitely made it healthier.

Great recipe. I followed some other suggestions and used less sugar(1 1/2 cups) and subst. 1/2 the oil for applesauce. Very moist and plenty sweet. I also used Nestles mini choc. chips and had no problem with them "sinking". Good use of Zucchini!

i used 1/2 cup oil and a 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce and i also added 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour.  i think this will become a favorite recipe of ours....especially with all the "free" zucchini signs up and down our country roads!

This is a great recipe! I scaled the recipe in half and made cupcakes, and they turned out moist and delicious. I used half oil and half applesauce as some other reviewers did, and had no problems. I also subbed cocoa powder for unsweetened chocolate, because that is what I had, and again no problems. This is an easily adaptable recipe, which is one of the things that makes it great!

Very yummy!! I made some changes however; instead of 1 cup oil, i did 1/2 cup and 1/2 cup applesauce - also I used 1 cup chocolate chips instead of 3/4. And i didn't have chocolate squares, so I used 6 tblsp cocoa and 2 tblsp butter as suggested by others. It turned out delicious - the only problems were the chips sank to the bottom (as others had already noticed) and it stuck to the bottom of the pan even though I greased it quite a bit.

Update: 8-30-10

LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BREAD!! We now substitute 1/2 c. applesauce and 1/2 c. oil for the 1 c. vegetable oil it calls for and last night, tried adding Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips. TO DIE FOR!



Yum. A week ago we made this bread exactly as written, dividing it into a smaller loaf pan and a cupcake tin. Tonight, we "discovered" a lone cupcake still in a plastic container in the refrigerator. My husband asked if we should throw it away because he was sure it would be disgusting and dry. We each took a half and then instantly regretted sharing. Moist, delicious and wonderful.

I improvised quite a bit on this recipe and it turned out...okay.  Some fault, I think, to me and some to the recipe.  I doubled the recipe, making two breads and a dozen muffins.  I took the muffins out halfway through baking time and they were burnt on the bottom, but the breads came out mostly okay, though just *slightly* overdone on the edges.  Bearing in mind that I doubled the recipe, I used a total of: 3 oz. unsweetened chocolate, just over half the sugar (maybe 1.25 cups), part zucchini and part carrot, 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour, added two over-ripe bananas, and the rest was the same.  They are much less cake-like than other reviews said, probably due to less chocolate and sugar.  I don't like oily muffins/breads and these kind of came out that way (I really need to keep some unsweetened applesauce on hand for substituting).  If I do it again, I will substitute applesauce for oil, use all the chocolate, and close to if not all the sugar.

I am allergic to chocolate, so I very rarely eat anything that features it as the main ingredient. This cake is so fabulous that I'll suffer the swollen lips and itchy throat just to enjoy a small slice.

My husband made this and followed the recipe, but used mini chocolate chips.  He also cooked it in a bundt pan.  This is absolutely fantastic!!!  I might replace some of the oil with applesauce next time, though.

Tastes just like cake. I substituted oil for applesauce and used splenda. Then put it in a sugar cone and with ice cream. I could eat that all day!

More like cake then the average zucchini bread.  Put a confectionery sugar glaze and serve as a dessert.

Thanks Diane for the best Zucchini Bread recipe ever.  Discovered it on AllRecipes last year; have made it many times since.  Everyone loves it and just about everyone who tries it has asked for the recipe.

Definitely tasty, just not as moist as I was hoping from the other reviews. I did only use 1/4 cup of sour cream as that was all I had on-hand, so when I make it again, I will go for the full cup. I also included some shredded carrot, used cocoa powder & butter in place of the chocolate squares & used 1/2 whole wheat 1/2 white flour.

This was really good. I only had large loaf pans so my loaves turned out really small. Next time I will multiply the recipe to 1 1/2 times to get bigger loaves.
Edit 05/14/2019: Still one of our favorite recipes. Tonight was one those nights when we wanted something sweet but needed to go to the grocery store.  I made so many modifications to this recipe and it still worked!!

Pretty darn good, just not fantastic.  loved the cinnamon flavor w the chocolate. coated the chip w the dry ingredients and they didnt sink. will make again during the holidays. might try and add the sour cream per other reviewers to kick up the moist factor.

We really liked this recipe - I used a full bag of Chocolate chips and about 4 oz of a hershey chocolate bar, 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil with 2 Tbsp of cocoa powder - my only complaint was all the chips sank to the bottom - may cut back on the chips next time - but there will definitely be a next time!

I made this recipe and sent one loaf to work with my husband and brought one to work myself.  Both were eaten quickly with a lot of complements!  I only used 1/2 cup of oil and an additional cup of zucchini the bread retained it's moist texture just fine. Like another reader suggested, I was afraid that 2 ounces of chocolate wouldn't be enough but I resisted adding more and it was plenty of chocolate, especially with the chocolate chips.

A great recipe for zucchini bread.  I finely grated the zucchini so that it would be undetectable to the picky eaters in my house, and they gobbled it up!

Very good taste. It was a little on the dry side, however that may have to do with the fact that I have a convection oven and I have learned that they run a bit hotter and cook a bit faster. I did add 1/4 cup of baking cocoa to the mix because I could tell by the batter it would not be chocolatey enough, I am glad I did. Definately coat your choco chips in flour before you add them to the batter and if you have a convection oven like me, do not cook them longer than 50 minutes and start poking for doneness around 45 minutes. By the time the top looks crusty and cracks, it's too late. But as far as taste, very good, not overly sweet. I will definately give another try.

Pretty good! I didn't want my bread to taste like oil (we only buy olive oil and its taste is pretty strong, so when i make sweets i usually avoid using it). Added 1/2 cup oil - 1/2 cup milk, and 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder. 
Made 12 muffins and a beautiful loaf!!

Nice way to use my giant zucchini. I had already given just as many as I could to everyone I knew, so this was a great way to use the big ones that were left over. I loved how moist it turned out.

This was very good, but I think I would like a deeper chocolate flavor. The next time I make it I'm going to play with adding additional cocoa powder. Thanks for a great way to use up my garden zucchini!

This was delicious. I doubled the chocolate and added a big handful of chopped walnuts. I also reduced the sugar to 1 3/4 cup but felt it could have used more and will add the full 2 cups next time. I also greased the pan and dusted it with cocoa. This was a hit at work. People liked that it wasn't too sweet, so reduce sugar to suit your tastes. Everyone wanted the recipe.

I make this several times each summer during zucchini season--it's always a hit, and most folks can't believe there's zucchini in there! The choc. chips do seem to settle on the bottom--maybe using mini-chips would help? It's very moist, almost cake-like. I love that this recipe makes 2 loaves--one to keep, and one to give away!

This bread is fabulous.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe, but substituted half of the oil for applesauce.  It was VERY good.  This time, I didn't have chocolate squares, so I used cocoa powder instead, adding it with the dry ingredients.  I thought it was even better this time.  The chocolate was more even, instead of getting chunky like it did before. This is an amazing recipe!

Great recipe...not too moist or too dry, which it great.  Breads in not my strong point and this recipe was perfect.  Also, I used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet.  It was great.  Thanks!!

My family and friends loved this deliciously moist chocolate bread.  The only change I made was to omit the cinnamon.  It tasted just like a homemade chocolate cake, no one noticed the zucchini.

My husband and I loved this bread! It's more like cake than bread. I wouldn't change a thing. I froze one loaf, but we thawed it as soon as we finished the first loaf. It still tasted fresh.

Oh, my, this is some awesome, awesome bread.  I sugared the pan as suggested , otherwise it was made as written.  It is wonderful out of the oven, but even better after a day.

Loved this!  I was a little apprehensive because of the lack of b. powder and lots of oil, but this was the nicest bread witht he best flavor and texture.  Even my picky veggie-loathing husband ate it up.  Cinnamon was a nice touch.

Pretty good, I think it could be a little more chocolately but I'm also comparing it to my Grandmas which I grew up eating!! Definetly a great way to get kids to eat extra veggies without them knowing, my nephew ate two peices and he hates his veggies!!(Just like any kid does)

This is wonderful.  I used canola oil and baked 1 hour in glass 9x5xinch pan at 325.  Very nice texture and tastes more like cake.  Hubby said its a keeper.  Next time I will use mini-choc. chips as the regular ones did sink to bottom of pan. Also think I will use a smaller sized pan.

My husband, kids and co-workers loved it.  I wasn't as thrilled, but I think it's just personal preference.  It was very moist and chocolaty though.  I used mini-chips as recommended by another reviewer and they didn't sink to the bottom.

I liked the flavor, texture, and how moist it was. I think that next time I will try it with the applesauce in place of the oil, becuase it seemed too oily.

This recipe was great, I can't believe how moist it was. I had made another close to this, but I think using the chocolate squares makes a difference instead of using cocoa. Thanks for a simple great recipe to use up those darn zucchinis from the garden!!!

I made this for my co-workers and also for my in-laws.  Everyone really liked it, although you couldn't really taste the zucchini.  It tasted more like a very moist and delicious chocolate cake!  Still, very good, and a nice way to use up extra zucchini.

Pretty darn good...the taste is better on the 2nd day, too. I didn't get as much of a rise out of it as I am used to getting from other quick breads, so the texture is a bit dense. I might mess around with leaveners next time to give it some more openness. Be careful when testing for doneness...if you hit a chocolate chip, you'll think it needs more time when it might not. Thanks for the great recipe...this is a perfect way to use up zucchini & get a nice chocolate fix at the same time.

This bread tastes great and is very moist. It is very brownie like. I followed the recipe exactly as it was on the sheet but still had problems. The bread didn't rise hardly at all. It was about and inch and a half thick when done baking. Also I greased the botom and sides of the pna generously with crisco but both loafs stuck tothe bottom. I saw how others said theirs stuck but I didn't see anybody having trouble with theirs rising. ANy suggestions? We still ate it and it was delicious!

This recipe was really fantastic.  Like others suggested, I cut back on the oil, and it is still really moist.  I added extra chocolate chips, but it definitely wasn't necessary.  It is plenty chocolatey.

This is a fantastic recipe!  My husband is a chocolate maniac and was unsure whether chocolate would taste good with zucchini but he loves this bread!  He had a slice with vanilla icing and went back for seconds.  I kept mine in a ziploc bag and it stayed nice and moist. I  stirred the zucchini in with the moist ingredients and did the chocolate chips last and none of the chocolate chips sunk to the bottom. I will be using this recipe often!

My mom makes a chocolate zucchini cake. Every Sunday for our family dinner her cake has been requested. I found this recipe, made it for a church picnic. It was a big hit. This is the request for our Sunday dinner desert now.  I took it to work, I had a co-worker propose marriage after eating this bread (Sorry I'm already married to a very happy and well feed man).

This was really great! I didn't change a thing my kids (and even my husband) gobbled it up!  I usually don't care for zucchini bread, but this is definitely a keeper!
