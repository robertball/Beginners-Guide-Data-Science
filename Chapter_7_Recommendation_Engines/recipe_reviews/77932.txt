This is a great recipe and easy to make.  I substitute whole milk (and sometimes 2% milk) for the 1/2 and 1/2.  It is so thick and healthy and the fresh rosemary is the perfect addition!

great soup! I made it twice, the first time i wasn't so impressed but my husband loved it. So I made it again and took the time to caramelize the potato and onion (the first time i was in a rush and didn't wait for the color to turn). I think that really help bring out the flavor. I added the rosemary during the saute and additional 1 tsp when i added the stock. I used whole milk instead of half and half. I loved it the second time! will defiantly make again.

Excellent soup....  although not as amazing as the Creamy Butternut also offered by Pam Anderson (try it!). I used an immersion blender, and left a few chunks of potato so it seemed like a heartier meal. Also, I used half a cup of half&half, and the rest 1%. Still rich and lovely.

This was an amazing recipe!  I made a few modifications though, but it was still incredibly tasty.  I didn't have russet potatoes, but I did have the tri-color mini potatoes, and those worked just as fine.  It did delay the caramelization time, however, but no biggie.  Added a little bit more sugar, and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter.  Don't have cayenne pepper, so I used Paprika, red peppers and black pepper.  Lastly, I used milk instead of the half & half, and just for giggles I included a quarter cup of white wine and about a tbsp of Dijon mustard.  Blended that all together, and WOWZA!  I wanted to lick pan clean it was that tasty.  Will definitely be making this again!

A keeper, for sure. Changes I made for our tastes: used minced garlic (from a jar) instead of the whole cloves; used no cayenne; used 1% milk instead of cream. The fresh rosemary really makes this great.

This is a great dish for using up a bag of poatoes before they sprout. I replaced sliced green onions for the rosemary since I couldn't find any. The bacon topping really makes a meal out of this and adding some cheese makes it taste just like a baked potato with toppings. Sauteing the onion and potato gives it extra flavor than just boiling them would. Yum.

Very good. Not sure what it would take to make it "outstanding". The serving size is about 3/4 cup. Bacon is a nice garnish; maybe next time I'll add some swirled cream to each serving. This took me an hour to make from start to finish. I increased the garlic, and the cayenne (which is very subtle). I'm glad I tried this. Not sure what the orange round things are in this photo, though; I'd love for someone to explain. In the instructions, #2 refers to "squash", but it's not one of the listed ingredients! This photo looked nothing like what I ended up with. Not even the green stuff. What IS all that, anyway??

At our church we have  Souper Bowl contest to raise money for our Christan School.  My daughter's class always get together to make a soup for the contest.  Without knowing it they chose all the ingredients in this soup and added a few more. Like beer, rice and egg dumplings. They always put dumplings in every soup they make. They won second place.  Awesome soup.  You will not be disappointed. But you do not have to add the beer, rice and dumplings it's good the way it is!

this is the best potato soup I have ever eaten, I followed the recipe except I used whipping cream deluted with milk probably half cream and half milk only because I wanted to use up the cream I had, and I used about 1/2 tsp rosemary, we like only a hint of rosemary. Never have seen potato soup made this way and it is excellant

Good stuff.  Omitted the bacon garnish (bought the bacon, but never got round to "deploying" it).  No need ... but, as another review said....do not omit the rosemary!

Very good soup.  Added some cooked bacon in while simmering for the meat lovers in the house.  Also had a sweet potato so I chopped that up with the white potatoes.  Turned out great

Wonderful recipe!  So tasty, I only made a few adjustments.  I reduced the rosemary to just less than a teaspoon and only used half a cup of whole milk instead of the half & half.  As a poor student who doesn't own much, I used a hand mixer to do the puree-ing and it worked out great.

Very good!  The soup was rich, creamy and very filling.  Loved the garlic and rosemary flavors.  The family enjoyed it also, and pleasing them is no easy feat, LOL!

Delicious results! Great for a blustery day. Made with homemade chicken broth, fresh thyme added, dried rosemary, added bit of chopped carrots & celery and used whole milk.

Nice soup - made it as described except used light milk - easy to make, tastes good. Next time I think I will try adding more herbs.

I used the directions as a guide and threw in some left overs in addition to the ingredients listed.  I added some overcooked white beans, mushrooms and some carmelized onions that had a balsamic glaze over it, as well.  The soup was awesome; but it turned out to be brown (the color of a good brown gravy) -- therefore, no picture because it does not look very appetizing, but tastes great!

Even though I only had red potatoes and garlic powder and dried rosemary, this came out very well. I simmered the potatoes with dry herbs and for 20 minutes instead of 10 in hopes they would blend well, and they did! Will definately make this again.

It was good.  We used 1/4 the amount of rosemary recommended and it was still strong.  I love seasoning, but if I had used the whole amount, it would have overpowered the meal.

This is a great recipe. Had to make it again because the first batch disappeared so quickly. Used 2% milk this time because I ran out of half and half. I noticed using entirely half and half made the soup very thick and heavy, whereas using only milk made it more of a cream soup. I threw in a little extra garlic (as per my norm) and went a little heavier on the cayenne, the soup had just the right amount of heat and was absolutely delicious. I also threw in some chives at the end of the cooking, everything was great. I served it with bacon on the side and dinner rolls (recipe found on this site, Miss Betty's Super Quick Dinner Rolls).
