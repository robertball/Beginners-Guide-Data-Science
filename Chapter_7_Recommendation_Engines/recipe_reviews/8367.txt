As a cake designer and baker I found this recipe to be one I will use over and over again!  I have tested many and this tastes and looks like an authentic Italian buttercream...but with less work!

This is the same recipe I have, but she's right--it's all in the technique! I whipped it the full 10 minutes and it made a world of difference! Give it a try, it's well worth the extra time.

I have been using this recipe for a little while now on all my cakes. My family loves the taste. I dislike shortening based frostings. The fact that I can control the sugar is nice. I use a little more sugar for kids cakes and less for adults. You can flavor to your liking as well. Excellent!

Unless you like eating a stick of butter on your cake I would not make this frosting. I think there must be a typo, I added 1/2 butter to 1 cup sugar and 1 cup cream and this came out really well, I also added some vanilla essence to give it some flavour.

I TRIED THIS BECAUSE I WAS DESPERATE FOR A FROSTING THAT ISN'T TOO SWEET.  I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE THAT THE TEXTURE IS MARVELOUS, BUT IT DOES TASTE MORE LIKE BUTTER THAN FROSTING.  SUGGESTION:  MAKE WITH UNSALTED BUTTER ONLY.  WOULD THE SAME RECIPE WORK, CHANGING THE RATION OF BUTTER TO CREAM--LESS BUTTER, MORE CREAM?

I love this recipe. It's almost like very thick whipped cream. You absolutely must use unsalted butter, though. Otherwise it will taste like whipped butter, as many others have said.

This is a great recipe. NO RAW EGGS!  A huge plus since all Italian or Swiss buttercreams call for egg whites. But  the recipe could use improvements. 1. half a teaspoon(or more) of vanilla adds a lot of flavor. 2. Some of my tasters felt that there was too much of a "butter felling" in the texture; the method I used for correcting the texture was adding small amounts of extra confectioners sugar, no more than half a cup, to the frosting and whipping it for a couple of minutes longer. If the frosting became stiff you would have to 1 to 2 tablespoons of whipping cream. After adding the extra sugar the frosting became to sweet, so to tone down the sweetness, I slowly added pinches of salt to the frosting, a baker's secret. Be very careful not to add too much salt!

I had to add a LOT more sugar to this recipe. It was too buttery to spread on my cake. I ended up adding one bar of hot melted giradelli bittersweet chocolate and it came out great, but I felt like a mad scientist trying to get it to a spreadable consistency adding water, cocoa, sugar, and chocolate.

This has quite the name for itself!! mine tasted just like Butter, I was VERY disappointed, but then thats its taste, Right? Taking the amount of sweetness in your hands is a really good feature I liked about this recipe! I covered a 9inch layer cake and had Half the cream left!

OMG, this is the buttercream recipe that i've been looking for its like sweet, thick whipped cream. yum! to anyone who complains that this "doesnt taste like the store-bought stuff" or "all you can taste is butter"... It ISN"T SUPPOSED TO! if it tastes wrong, your doing something wrong. either that or you dont know what a true buttercream is supposed to taste like. Betty Crocker from the supermarket is NOT GOOD ICING. and this stuff is! Lost one star because the overall flavor is a bit bland, should have noted that this is an ICING BASE and you NEED TO ADD YOUR OWN FLAVORINGS if you want it to taste like chocolate or vanilla or whatever. Still, this i the icing i will be using on the cupcakes at my wedding. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!!

I had to review this.  Here's the scoop -- fresh out of the mixer, this is one of the most incredible whippy happy goodness icings I've ever eaten. It has an incredible fluffly texture and is rich and decadent.  I put a 1/2 tsp of almond extract for flavoring, and I couldn't keep the family away from it.

However, once the icing has been refrigerated, due to the high butter content, it is hard and the flavor does swing over to the "butter lightly flavored with sugar" taste.  Not to say that it's bad, but when cold, it is "peelable" off the cake.  The solution? Let it warm up to room temp before you serve the cake again, and voila, you have happy whippy goodness again.   

I think perhaps the difference in taste/texture after refrigeration is why you have the varied hate/love for this recipe.  As written is it really good and fluffy.  Great icing!  Its just not something I think is at its best when served cold.  I so wanna try this with a little bit of orange zest on a lightly orange flavored cake!  YUM!

I honestly don't understand how everyone seems to have a problem with this frosting. It is excellent. I do agree with some of the reviews that it is a base icing and flavor definitely needs to be added. After whipping for 10 minutes and even more for 4 minutes; it came out with perfect consistency. I cut the recipe in half and used unsalted butter. I also added an extra half cup of powdered sugar. Good luck to all those, I feel everyone should try it once.

It is absolutely delicious if you add more sugar.  As it is the frosting tasted too much like eating butter.  I tripled the sugar and it received adult raves at my daughter's birthday party.  I was also really impressed that it came out very white just like decorating frosting but with better flavor.

This recipe is very creamy, but it just tastes like pure butter.  I added about 1 1/2 extra cups of powdered sugar, and it still tasted too buttery to me, and my roommate and fiancé both agreed.

This was amazing!  I used it on some cupcakes.  Thanks to those who put in their own secrets, it did not come out tasting like butter.  I did 2 cups unsalted butter and added a tsp of vanilla extract and the full cup of sugar.  Came out smooth and tasted like whipped cream!  Thank you for sharing.  This is now my frosting of choice.  Highly recommend a stand alone mixer for this so you can move about while waiting for the butter to fluff.  it really does take 10 mins.

I had never made this kind of frosting. Usually I do Icing (milk, confection sugar, vinilla. Simple-I don't even use a recipe) I like the taste of the icing much better but that is no fault of this recipe. I needed frosting to go under Fondant because I find the Fodant by itself unappealing. At first I didn't think it was going to make the amount promised (2  9in cakes) but after whipping the butter for more than 10 minutes and adding the sugar and cream I had more than enough. I don't know how much sugar I added but it was more than a cup--I kept adding a little at a time to cover the overwhelming butter taste. I also added more cream so the extra sugar wouldn't weigh down the fluffyness ( I used confectionist sugar, I do not recommend regular sugar) It came out very light and fluffy. It is very rich, not something that I would want to eat a lot of. The cake came out beautiful and everyone exclaimed over the frosting so it was a hit. Although next time I would add vanilla. I think the trick is to add the sugar and cream to taste and not stick to the recipe and maybe add some flavor extract of your choice. I am sure I will use this again.

I really enjoyed this frosting.  You must use unsalted butter, and vanilla or some other flavoring.  For all the posters that complain about the buttery taste, it is called BUTTERcream for a reason; it is supposed to taste like butter.

I wish I could give this recipe 3.5 stars, but I'll round up because I learned some valuable lessons from this frosting.  It did end up tasting good (after adding a lot more sugar) and spread very nicely.  I followed the recipe precisely, and guess what?  It tasted like butter.  I love butter as much as the next person, but I don't want to smear a stick of it on my cake, and that's what it tasted like.  I ended up adding about 3x the amount of sugar the recipe called for.  I don't fault the recipe for that ... I understand that not everyone wants a sweet frosting (and some people may want to smear butter on their cakes).  So, what did I learn?  If I want a light and fluffy buttercream, make REAL Italian buttercream.  And, if I add a decent amount of heavy cream to my usual all-butter buttercream recipe (which I feel is way too heavy), I'll have a much lighter and better tasting frosting.  I probably won't use this exact receipe again, but I'll follow the techniques in my buttercream.

As some other posters have recommended, I did use unsalted butter  and whipped it for the full 10 minutes, probably more, and it still tasted like whipped butter.  I ended up adding about 4 times the recommended amount of sugar plus 2 tsp of vanilla and it was just ok.

This IS like "licking a stick of butter," as one reviewer wrote!  2 cups of butter is a lot of butter.  I would never recommend this recipe.  Was the "2 cups of butter" a typo?  It should be 2/3 cup of butter at most!

Used this on an apple cake recipe;  it got rave reviews from everyone who tried it.  My husband said, "This is SO creamy and not overly sweet-- must mean it's bad for me..."

I dind't care for this buttercream.  It was more like whipped butter than frosting.  I even added much more powdered sugar and it was still bearly sweet.

This is an easy recipe to follow. I only used 1 stick of butter, and about 1 Tbs of Heavy Cream and between 1/4 & 1/2 cup of powered sugar. It does have a strong butter flavor which is ok with my mom as she loves butter. I think it is too buttery and I would add more sugar if it was for me. It was for my mom for Mothers Day, so less sugar and more butter flavor this time.

If I could rate this with more stars I would! the first time I halved the recipe, thinking I'd have enough for 24 cupcakes... sadly I did not.  It iced about 12 (heavily) the only think I did differently than the recipe stated was I added about a teaspoon of vanilla.  This is my go to icing recipe from now on. The ten minute whipping is the key, and unsalted butter!

If you make this don't use salted butter otherwise it just tastes like whipped butter.  I actually ended up using about 3 cups of powdered sugar because otherwise it just tasted like butter.  I was aiming for a light buttercream frosting.  Next time I will make traditional buttercream frosting, then whip some cream and fold them together to get the lighter texture I want.  I ended up adding 2 TBSP. cocoa powder and 1/2 cup of powdered peanut butter to make give it a pleasant taste and mask some of the butter taste.

I was really excited for this recipe. 3 ingredients and easy instructions. I followed the instructions and ended up with a lumpy texture. That was fixable. But the flavor was WAY TOO BUTTERY! It tasted like I was eating a stick of butter. I tried again with  1 cup of butter and 6 cups of confectionars' sugar. I used the same amount of heavy whipping cream and added vanilla extract. That ended up being perfect!

This recipe is incredible & *exactly* what I was looking for.  It's a perfect marriage of buttercream and whipped cream icing.  I added 2 tsp of vanilla, but that is entirely optional.  Make sure to follow the steps & allow the frosting to whip fully.  Absolutely wonderful!

Anyone who has baked even brownies from a box must know you use Unsalted butter to bake or in sweet recipes.Imagine dipping a spoon in a tub of lard and eating it with sprinkled sugar on top-that's frosting with shortening in it, Gross. So like Paula Deen, I opt for BUTTER anytime!Great recipe.Cheers!

I've tried several buttercream recipes and this is my favorite. It would be hard to decorate with due to the light consistency, but it's perfect for an old fashioned cake or cupcake. I used 3 sticks of butter, 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream, and 3/4 cup of sugar. I added 1 tblsp of Wilton's vanilla extract.  I am going to try it some other flavors next. I think it could make a beautiful holiday cake if you added dried fruit to the top of the cake. FYI- You really need to whip the butter for the full 10 minutes.

This recipe was very delicious. My only problem with it is that it took me a couple of tries to get it right. Make sure you let the butter beat for a long time.

It came out too mushy using butter alone with the heavy whipping cream and 10X [confectioners' sugar]. I'm inclined to stick (no pun intended) to just butter, milk, 10x, and flavoring.  I've found it best to use equal amounts of butter AND shortening to avoid that buttery taste. IT WORKS PEOPLE!

This tasted more like butter than frosting.  I whipped the butter for more than 10 minutes and added at least 4 times the required amount of sugar and it still just tasted like whipped butter.  I definately will not be using this recipe again.

I used this frosting on a dark chocolate cake, and it was wonderful.  It's certainly not for those who want a quick fix, but the extra time and effort is worth it, as the final result is a lovely frosting.  I was worried that it wouldn't feel nice in my mouth since the consistency is that of whipped butter, but to avoid that, I just added some granulated sugar and about a teaspooon of flour to give it a grainy feel.  I did, however, have to add a wee bit more sugar than the recipe originally called for, but thats probably just due to my sweet tooth!  All in all, its a lovely recipe--great for any cake!

I absolutely LOVE this Buttercream Frosting!! This is a based Buttercream Frosting which allows you to add to your taste. In addition to the recipe I added 1 tsp of vanilla flavoring, 1 tsp of almond extract, and an additional cup of confectioners sugar. Absolutely D'licious and very light & fluffy!! I was able to frost 4 dozen cupcakes with a little frosting leftover. Perfect frosting!!!??

I accident, but that still didn’t mask the butter taste. From the reviews, it seems as though the issue may have been using salted vs. unsalted butter. If that really makes such a big difference then I wish the recipe would have specifically called for unsalted. Another problem I found with this frosting is that the fat content is so high that it is EXTREMELY rich. I couldn’t bare to eat more than just the teaspoon or two I had to taste for flavor. Only reason I’m giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because the texture is very smooth.

This tastes extremely buttery, so it's a bit much for my taste. I did add vanilla to see if I would like it more but I did not. I used 36% heavy cream, and that may be too heavy. The texture is lovely. I gave five stars because the recipe is exactly as described but, personally, it's just too rich for me.

This is the WORST recipe I’ve ever found on all recipes EVER.  This recipe didn’t specify unsalted butter.  I followed the directions exactly as printed and the mess in my Kitchen aid tastes nothing like frosting.  Maybe I’ll freeze it and serve it on pancakes...

The technique was amazing but the frosting recipe had WAY too much butter!! Second go around I used the same technique using 2 cups of butter only 6 oz of whipping cream, 1/2 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp of salt and 5 cups of confectioners' sugar and it turned out PERFECT!

I made this recipe, and must say I was certainly disappointed.  Looked easy enough, but the ratio of butter to sugar was way off....I followed the directions to a "T" and it still didn't taste good....consistency was way off and just didn't taste right.  Wasted a lot of good ingredients.  Can't figure out how so many gave it 5 stars....i did everything right.

Quick and easy way to  good frosting. I see some others here saying it taste more like butter than frosting. I didn't have that problem. I used unsalted butter, 1 1/2 cups of confectioners' sugar, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and it turned out great. Keep in mind, it's important to whip for the full 10 minutes. This is a good recipe, just needs a little adjusting.

I used 1 and 1/2 cups of butter-that was still too much.  I agree that it must be a typo. Great frosting, just use two sticks (one cup unsalted)   I flavored one with almond extract..was very good.

I have been searching for a light frosting that I could decorate with for my friend's wedding cake. She despises sweet frosting and this was it. Easy to make, easy to spread and held up well although I'm happy it wasn't a summer wedding with a lot of heat. I used unsalted butter, added a tsp of vanilla and didn't find the taste to be too buttery.

I can't figure out why there are so many good reviews for this recipe. I made it, as instructed, whipping the butter for ten minutes added the cream and then the sugar and it when I put some on my finger to taste it, it was as if I had bit into a stick of butter. I ended up using the entire container of cream and then adding several more cups of sugar before it was even remotely better. Then milk and more sugar once I ran out of cream. Should have stuck with what I know.

I made this frosting with my 4 year old nephews and it was very easy, but it just tasted like straight butter.  I used half of the recommended amount of butter and added lots more sugar and vanilla but it still did not take away from the butter taste.  I could not get my nephews or my husband to eat a full cookie with this frosting on it.

I am pretty sure I followed this recipe exact, but it did not work out for me. It had a runny consistency during the mixing process, but I told myself it would firm up after chilling. I was wrong. These were suppose to frost my daughters birthday cupcakes. The frosting (as the chill wore off) became runny. A disappointment. I won't be using this recipe again.

This frosting recipe worked for me, but you do have to add your own flavoring!!! I added vanilla flavoring at the first step when the butter was being whipped for 10 minutes. I also wanted a sweeter frosting so I added about a half pound of confectioner's sugar.

I followed this recipe exactly....but it turned out clumpy and curdled and it was VERY buttery...so I added more powdered sugar, cream, and some vanilla. It's still clumpy but it tastes good.

I wish I had read more than the first 3 reviews (which were favorable).  This frosting needs way more sugar.  I would recommend a whole 2 lb bag of confectioners sugar (at least - maybe more, I didn't test out this recommendation).  It was not nearly sweet enough.  I do think the whipping suggestion was good, though, hence 2 stars.  But I actually peeled the frosting off of my piece of birthday cake.

This is basically like spreading i can't believe its not butter on your cake. i had to add an extra cup and a half or so and some almond extract to make it palatable. then i spread it very thin on the cake so that it wouldn't be too overpowering. way too buttery

I'm a great baker and i used this frosting for a surprise party cake.  I went to my local baking supply store and found many things to make it perfect. Eating the cake was awesome because guess what the best part was? THE FROSTING!!

This recipe worked out very well for me.  I ave a Kitchenaid mixer and was able to drop it in and go.  Very easy.  I might use unsalted butter next time because the salt taste was a little too preminent.

It tasted like pure butter no matter how much extra whipped cream or sugar I added. Even my boyfriend, who will eat anything, disliked it. I was making a cake for a birthday at work tomorrow, and this frosting ruined the whole cake, and now I have nothing to bring in tomorrow.

Ultimately, on the cake, this frosting had a wonderfully light texture, but it was way too buttery for my family's tastes.  Because it's real butter, it doesn't leave a filmy residue in your mouth, but even with unsalted butter and more sugar than the recipe called for, it was just too much butter.

I don't bake many cakes---maybe three a year for our family birthdays---so when I do bake, I don't take shortcuts, and I don't mind the indulgence, but again, this recipe kind of "takes the cake," if you can pardon the pun.  It was difficult for me to enjoy, even once I got past the butter consistency, knowing how much butter and heavy cream I was eating.

Nice texture resulting in a pretty and very easy to use frosting, but agree with others in that it is just too buttery.  My husband described it as "a bit like licking a stick of butter", but he ate every last cupcake so who can complain.
