I loved this cake.  It's just like a cake we used to buy at Easter-time at a local bakery that has since gone out of business.  The lemon cream-cheese frosting was the perfect touch.

I had alot of trouble getting the yolks to blend well with the cake flour and then when I baked it, the yellow part of the cake was very dense and dry.  The white part was very good (angel food consistency) and the cream cheese lemon frosting was delicious.  We dipped strawberries in the extra frosty - yummy!

I made this cake for my mom when she was very ill, and she loved it. Unfortunately, it was her hand-written recipe that I had used, and I lost it after she died.  Yours is the closest taste and texture to hers that I’ve made, so I’m incredibly grateful to have found yours. Thank you for bringing back good memories.  This cake IS a lot of work, but it’s delicious and special.  I serve it with vanilla-flavored whipped cream and fresh fruit.

First, the Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting is wonderful.  However, the cake itself was not thrilling to me.  It was flat.  Either I over beat the eggs or something but it was not fluffy.  Second, I would recommend using a nonstick coating spray in the pan.  Especially if you do not have a nonstick tube pan.  It did not come out clean.  In fact, it broke.

I recognized that the egg yolks need to be beaten separately on high speed for maybe five minutes until they are very pale yellow in color. This will enable the folding in process to go very easily. Add the vanilla thoroughly to the half portion of egg whites before you add any flour. The Lemon Cream Cheese frosting is a must.

Nothing really special about this cake that made it worth the work involved. The yellow batter leaked out of my tube pan so if I make it  again I'll put the white batter down first then alternate batters.

I followed the recipe exactly.  This is a wonderful sponge cake with a much more fascinating flavor and texture than angel food cake.  I put no frosting or glaze on it and  finished it simply by sifting confectioner's sugar on the top.  I served it with fresh berries.  The cake was a hit with everyone, including children.

I loved this! Such a simple cake, and very pretty. I didn’t frost it—just dusted the top with powdered sugar and served with whipped cream and strawberries. I used orange zest instead of orange extract.
