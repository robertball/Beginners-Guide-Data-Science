The first time I made this cake was for a family gathering. Everyone loved it. Then I made it for a church gathering, and received several requests for the recipe. I make this cake often. It's so easy to make. It's so moist, and not too rich or sweet. Once I did not have German Sweet chocolate but I made it anyway. It was not as good. That really makes this cake delicious. I even tried it once with a chocolate glaze, but everyone in my family agreed that I should leave well enough alone.

I made this last week because company was coming over, and it is FANTASTIC.  So delicious, moist, and chocolately without being overpowering.  Here is what you should do to make it fabulous:
-Use yellow cake mix with pudding in the mix, plus the box of instant vanilla pudding.
-Stir cake mix, pudding mix, and mini chocolate chips together in large bowl.  Then add the eggs, oil, and milk and stir until blended.
-Grate 2/3 of a bar of German Sweet baking chocolate and mix this into the batter.  (I didn't sprinkle any on the finished cake).
The chips and grated chocolate won't sink if you follow the above directions.
Dust with some powdered sugar once the cake is cooled.
This is one of the best cake recipes I have ever used!!!  DELICIOUS.

This was wonderful.  My husband has raved over this cake.  I didn't have any of the sweet chocolate and it still turned out great. For the top I mixed together a small amount of Cocoa powder and powdered sugar, and it was great.

My husband's favorite chocolate chip cake recipe now!  Very moist and flavorful.  I made this as two 8" rounds for a birthday cake with buttercream frosting.  Perfect :)

HOLY COW, THIS CAKE IS GREAT!  I didn't have German chocolate to grate or powdered sugar to put on top or a bundt pan and it didn't matter - it was still a home run!  I did put the chips in with the dry ingredients so they wouldn't sink.

Great recipe!  I have been looking for a good chocolate chip cake recipe and so far this has been my favorite, plus you can't have easier directions!  I omitted the german chocolate, just as I didn't have any, and put in 1 cup of mini semi sweet chocolate chips.  I then made these as cupcakes, baked at 350 for exactly 20 minutes, and they were perfect.  Cheated and frosted with Betty Crocker's Triple Fudge Chip frosting, just as it was quick. Very tasty and moist. Got rave reviews

My family absolutely loves this cake. And it is soooo easy to put together.  I keep all of the ingredients in stock so I can make it for a quick dessert to take to friends or for a quick weeknight treat. I made it exactly as instructed.

Incredibly moist and delicious.  I made a chocolate glaze to drip over it instead of the powdered sugar.  Next time, I think I'll try a peanut butter glaze.  Loved this recipe, it is a keeper.

This cake was great! It was very moist and even better the next day. I didn't have any German sweet chocolate,so I just made it without and it was still great. I do recommend putting the chips in with the dry ingredients though because mine sank.

Great and easy! I didn't have the german chocolate, I just used semi sweet baking squares, and grated them. My husband and kids at it at record speed, and wanted to know when I would be making it again!

I grew up with my mother making a similar recipe, but it used water instead of milk. This recipe is the best one I have tried in a while. I made it according to the recipe with rave reviews from my family, including my picky boys. I made it again a couple days later (yes, my kids loved it that much) but just using a yellow cake mix, no chocolate chips, and buttercream frosting. That went over just as well! Thank you so much for this recipe, I will be making it again and again I'm sure!

I followed the recipe and it was delicious. One thing I cooked one hour and the outside was a bit crunchy so next time I will not cook the complete  hour.  Yummy.

This cake tastes great! I didn't change the recipe either. Perfect texture and sweetness! I made this for my family who are very picky when it comes to cakes and desserts and they loved it! It was quick and easy to make as well. This cake is full of flavor  so whoever said it lacks flavor probably missed some ingredients or likes to eat sugar straight out of the bag for dessert.

I used this recipie to make a molten chocolate chip cake/cupcakes and we loved it!!  Lots of flavor, and the only thing I left out was the grated chocolate since I was using Baker's chocolate for the molten portion.

Very moist, but doesn't beat my friend Susanne's chocolate chip cake recipe.

This is my "go-to" recipe when I decide to bring a dessert to any kind of get-together.  It's super easy to make and everyone always raves about it! Nice crusty outside and dense inside.  The pudding really makes it moist. I usually use 3 eggs and omit the German chocolate, cuz I never keep any around. Plus, I don't think the cake needs it.  Probably would be good, though.  5 stars!

I followed the recipe to a "T" right down to the German Sweet Chocolate.  That was a pain to grate, the little bits were staticy and bouncing all over the place.  I froze the chocolate before grating to make sure it was small enough to go through my sifter.

I did not have any sweet chocolate, but I made it anyway without it. It was very moist and yummy. My VERY picky 7 yr old daughter loved it. As did the rest of my family. Thanks!

I used a white cake mix b/c I didn't have yellow.  My husband loved it!  I am going to make it again this week using the ingredients listed.  Can't wait!
