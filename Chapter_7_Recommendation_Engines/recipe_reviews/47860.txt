Great comfort food for the fall.

I took the advise of some others to layer the ingredients, use mushroom soup with garlic, double the ham and cheese and to use milk not water.  I also cooked on high for 5 hours.

I modified this slightly.  I  eliminated the ham since I was making a full ham to go with these.  I also eliminated the onion.  I used the cream of mushroom soup & one full soup can of milk instead of water.  Along with the chedder cheese I added about 3/4 C of mozz. cheese & monteray jack that I had in the fridge wanting to use up.  I also added about 3 cloves of crused garlic.  Everyone loved them!  I just threw everything in the crock pot very early in the day & kept it on low for  about 5 hours then went to high for the last hour.  Will be making again & again.

I've made this several times now.  It doesn't seem to turn out in my slow cooker, but 1 1/2 hours at 325 in the oven does quite a nice job instead.  I usually add some mushrooms, and I have always been happy with the results.  Nice and creamy, very cheesy, freezes well too.

Outstanding.  The only thing I did differently was to layer the ingredients before adding the soup.

This is a great, easy recipe!  I used all the ingredients called for, but I did make one slight adjustment.  I cooked this for about 7 hours on low instead of high for 4 hours.  Turned out wonderful!

I have been making ham and scalloped potatoes for years and used milk and more cheddar cheese. I always found them a bit greasy. This was a great recipe...nice a creamy.

It was alright.  I only made a couple changes: Doubled the ham and used 1/8 teaspoon of salt.  My roommate and I felt the dish was not cheesy enough and lacked the kick other dishes from this site had.  I prefer the "Three Cheese Garlic Scalloped Potatoes" recipe to this one.  I did not enjoy the texture of the ham in this dish and wish it had been cooked separately.  I probably will not be making this again.

This was fantastic.  Three of us ate the entire thing in one sitting!  I didn't have time for the slow cooker so just mixed it all up and baked it at 350 for an hour.

This is very similiar to my recipe for slow cooker scalloped potatoes. My recipe is to butter the crockpot and layer half the potatoes, onions, seasonings, ham, and velveeta cheese. Repeat with second layer. Top with cream of chicken soup (or any other cream soup).  Sprinkle with papricka.   I cut the medium size potatoes in half before slicing thin.  Doing this reduces my cooking time to just less then 3 hours on high. Another tip is to soak the raw potatoes in 1 cup of water mixed with 1 teaspoon of cream of tartar to prevent the potatoes from browning, drain water before layering. This is a wonderfully delicious and easy dish.

I used 6 large potatoes, a 16 oz. pkg diced ham, cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, and milk instead of water. Cooked on low for 7 hours. Turned out awesome! Next time I might add a little bit of Tabasco to soup mixture for some heat. (I like everything a little spicy!) Also, the cheese tends to stick to the sides of the crockpot so it might be beneficial to spray it with non-stick cooking spray before putting everything in it.

I followed the advice of the others and layered the ingredients. I also doubled the ham and cheese and used milk instead of water.  Instead of chopped ham, I used two whole bone in ham slices (each one being a separate layer). The bone gives it more flavor.  I added a few cloves of chopped garlic to the chopped onion. I had two layers of potatoes, onion/garlic, ham slice and cheese (cheese being on top).  Then I poured the soup mixture over the top. I used the amount of salt, pepper and garlic powder called for.  Cooked on high for four hours and then turned to low until dinner time, about two hours.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!! My husband is not a big potato fan and he LOVED this dish as did my college age son. It was a bit watery but I turned it on high for about 20 minutes with the lid off prior to serving and that took care of it plus filled the house with a wonderful aroma! Reheated the leftovers in the crock pot the next day and it was even better! I will definitely make this again and won't change a thing from the above. I don't think it could possibly be improved upon!

I read some of the reviews on this before I made so I did a little bit of a change. I used milk in place of water and I did it with seasoned and browned pork chops. This smelled great while cooking and the pork chops came out nice and moist. The only thing I think I will pass on when making it next is the cheese as we found it didn't really enhance the flavor.

This was very good! I've made it twice now, both times with rave reviews. I followed the advice of another reviewer and cooked it in the oven at 325 for 1-1/2 hours. I used milk instead of water. I cooked it covered with foil until the last 15 minutes, sprinkled the top with shredded cheese, then seasoned bread crumbs over the cheese. It created a flavorful crunchy, cheesey topping. Yummy! I have also microwaved the sliced potatoes to shorten the cooking time. I am looking forward to the day when I have time to try it in the crockpot.

This was a delicious, warm meal for a cold night.  I used grated swiss cheese, skim milk instead of water and added a few fresh mushrooms.  Four hours on high was a little too much, but the potatoes did brown nicely on the sides of the crock, but would have burned if I hadn't turned it down.

This is delicious with or without cheese. But when I do add cheese, I use 2 cups and I always use milk, not water with this recipe. One other thing - leave out the salt. There is already plenty of sodium in the soup, the cheese and most certainly the ham. It's just not necessary to add more from the shaker. I have made this both in the slow cooker and in the oven (2 quart casserole dish, bake at 350 degrees covered for 1 hour, then uncovered for an additional 1/2 hour). Both ways come out yummy! Whichever method you use, layer the ingredients and be sure to slice your potatoes very thin. Oh, and I also don't peal the potatoes before slicing. I just clean them well and slice away. There is fiber and lots of nutrients in the skin. Enjoy!!

Definitely layer the ingredients, and try using thinly sliced polska kielbasa instead of the ham.  When making a similar oven recipe, I also layer in shredded cabbage for a touch of sweetness.

Read the reviews first then did the most recommeded, double ham and cheese, use milk, and layer. I also greased my crock with shortening to avoid crusties. Glad I did. Would recommend cutting the slices in half unless they are very thin to get them cooked well. Had some friends over and it was a hit! No leftovers!

My husband was begging for scalloped potatoes and suggested getting a box of them and adding ham. A box?!? Seriously?? I can't ever just leave a recipe alone and make it as is. So here's what I did:  par-boiled the potatoes( I only had a few hours for it to cook), doubled the ham (left over from Easter dinner) doubled the cheese,used garlic cream of shroom soup---I put garlic in EVERYthing----and threw some sour cream in. Sprayed the crock pot well with cooking spray,then cooked on low for 3 hours. The house smelled amazing, the potatoes were even better, and husband was pleased.

This was a great recipe for ham and potatoes.  Very creamy!!  I made an easy substitution and bought the Campbell's Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic and omitted the garlic powder.  It did take my potatoes quite a bit longer than 4 hours to cook though.  I will certainly make this again, but definately will add more ham.

Excellent! I substituted evaporated milk for the water. Instead of using the crockpot, I layered everything in a casserole dish. Covered it with foil and baked it in the oven at 350 for 1 hour. It was great and my whole family loved it. I will be making it again.

I have been married for 14 1/2 years and my husband has always said he does not like ham mixed with food.  But this dinner is the exception.  He loves it and so does my 4 year old.  The only thing I changed was I used cream of chicken instead - adds a little extra flavor.

I got this recipe from my friend & thought I'd try it.  My husband made it & found out it has to bake a little longer than what it says.  Thinner sliced potatoes would make a difference, too.  It was too salty to suit us, so next time, we'll cut out the salt.

This is a great and easy recipe.  I only had American cheese (instead of Cheddar) but it gave the potatoes a really creamy texture.  I also cooked it in the oven-- 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours.  Thanks Raquel!!

This is a recipe I turn to many times.  I do substitute milk for the water - I believe it makes a huge difference.  I often prefer to cook this in the oven for about 1.5 to 2 hours at 325 (higher than that tends to dry it out).

We liked this.  Other than layering the ingredients and using milk rather than water as other reviews say, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I would have rated it 5 stars but for the fact that mine ended up having too much liquid.  I cooked it longer in an attempt to dry it out a bit.  I will be re-heating it for dinner tonight and maybe it will be more solid now.  I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

My whole family just loved this recipe.   Its different and all ready when you need it.  I cooked 7 hours on low.  I changed the cream of mushroom to cream of celery  (only because that is what I had) and I used milk instead of water. This is a favorite recipe that I will use again and again

Oh my this is such a comforting meal, I forgot to put everything in the crockpot before work, so I layered everything in a casserole dish, baked for an hour covered and 30 minutes uncovered...it was execellent!!!!  For each layer I added sliced American cheese too!

Yum! I opted to bake this in the oven. Use milk instead of water and more shredded cheese. Cheddar cheese soup worked much better than cream of mushroom for us. Didn't spend time layering it, just mix everything together in a 9x13 dish, cover it with foil, & bake at 375 for an hour. For a finishing touch turn the broiler on and let it brown nicely on top. True comfort food. A meal everyone in the family loves!

Definitely making again! I used 2 cups cheese because I have a cheese-loving family (lots of Packer fans). My medium-sized crock pot (4-qt?) was too small so I put it in my 7-qt. It was nearly cooked in under 3 hours on high so I put it on low until halftime (2 hours). It got a crust on the bottom that was much loved.

Very good... added whole milk instead of water, omitted the salt, and added more cheese.  Definitely a good recipe to keep for quick meals with leftover ham!

I made this tonight in my 6 qt crock pot.  We loved it.  I made a 12 serving size and like clockwork...it was done in 4 hrs on high. I added real garlic in place of the garlic powder but pretty much followed the original recipe.  I'll be sure to make this again.

Double the amount of potatoes and ham. Use TWO cans of Cream Of Mushroom. Also add a package of Country Style gravy to the mushroom soup and water.   I always throw in Garlic Powder, Basil & Penzey's Black & Red (cayenne / black pepper). I never measure out the cheese - I just throw on Sharp Cheddar until I think it's enough (only for the last half hour of cooking).  Perfectly saucy (thickens up as it cools) and utterly delish.   3.5 - 4 hours on HIGH in the Crock pot. Before cooking, toss the potatoes in cup of water with a 1/2 tsp cream of tartar - to keep 'em from getting dark while cooking  *UPDATE* Today, I needed to use up 3/4 cup of Heavy Cream, and then added just short of 1 1/2 cups of water (in place of the 2 cups water).  This small change really upped the WOW factor!

The flavor was good, but nothing out of this world.  I used milk instead of water like many reviewers suggested.  I also didn't measure the cheese, but know I put more in then the 1 cup the recipe called for.  It could've used more ham.  My main problem was the potatoes did not get done in 4 hours.  After 5 hours, they still were not done.  I took them out of the crock pot, and transferred them to my oven.  After another 1/2 hour they were finally done.  I thought I cut the potatoes thin enough, but maybe not.

I made this recipe yesterday and it turned out great.  Everyone liked it.  I used milk instead of water and cooked it for 5 hours.  I will make this again soon.  The next time, I will use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and add a small can of sliced mushrooms.

We really like this.  I  did use milk instead of water, doubled the cheese, and a couple of cloves of minced garlic.  Also, I did it in two layers.  Great way to use up leftover ham.

I really like this recipe and have made it several times, with variations.   The recipe as is is good, I use milk instead of the water.  I have also made a variation with pork chops instead of ham.  I seasoned and browned the pork chops  (4) and layered them in between a couple of layers of the potatoes with the soup mixture mixed right into them.  That went about 5 hours and was delicious.  I also have made variations with mushrooms, herbs, etc. The recipe is good comfort food as is, not gourmet, just good eating!

This was awesome!! The only change I made was to microwave the potatoes (I had 4 large & 2 small white potatoes)for about 5 minutes before slicing into crock pot. I added some fresh sauteed white mushrooms and used leftover sliced deli ham and cooked it on low for about 7 hours. It is delicious and it will be a staple for the fall and winter months. I added a little extra water so there was extra "gravy" to spoon over everything at serving time. This recipe is great to use when you just have a few leftovers sitting around. Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband loved this soup! I did follow suggestions and doubled the ham and added milk instead of water. I also added more of the seasonings to give it a bolder flavor. (I used minced garlic instead of powder.) To add some veggies to the dish I added french style green beans near the end. (so they wouldn't over cook) I added extra milk to create a great creamy soup dish!

I used red potatoes, left out the onion, replaced the water with half n half and used Cream of Soup Base from this site instead of a canned soup. Added red pepper flakes for a little heat. Good comfort food.

I made this recipe but made the mistake of not thinly slicing the potatoes.  If anyone has ended up with a watery mixture because of having to cook it longer than the 4 hrs, this might be the problem.  If this happens to you, this is how to fix it, and as a result, you will still have an amazing thick cheesy comfort meal!  
You will need 1 cup of milk, 2 TBSP flour and 1-2 cups of shredded chedder cheese (depending on how cheesy you like it.

In a pan on low heat, whisk constantly milk and flour until thick and hot but not scolded or boiling (about 30 secs-1 min). Take off heat, and add anywhere between 1-2 cups of cheese.  It must be EXTREMELY thick (thicker than pancake batter) because it must stand up to the watered down mixture in the crock.  I added additional onion & garlic powders, and salt. Whisk for a minute until shredded cheese is melted.  Mix into ham and potatoes in crockpot. I like it very thick, so I let it sit for a bit to let the mixture thicken more. It's even better if you refrigerate overnight and heat the next day.  The flavors are even better and so much thicker!!

This is a great recipe!  It is perfect for running your crockpot instead of stove when the a/c is running in the summer.  I made this as a side and did not put the ham in it, and I used garlic instead of garlic powder.  It is in my rotation. Thank you! :)

Pretty good but I modified it as well: 1ts. salt 3/4ts. garlic 1.5c cheese 2TB butter 1/2c parmesan 1/2c sour cream and i used evaporated milk instead of water.  Next time I will follow my recipe but I will use green onions and I think with all of that- it will end up a 5 start recipe.

This is a very good basic recipe.  If you slice your potatoes thin and evenly, it won't take longer than 3 1/2 hours to get done.  I have the Pampered Chef slicer, which works really slick for getting these potatoes sliced.  As suggested by others, I did put in more ham, more cheese, used half and half instead of water, and used cream of celery soup.  This is ultimate comfort food!

I made the mistake of mixing red potatoes with a baking potato. As a result, the baking potato wasn't cooked. I had to re-cook the potatoes in the oven. Despite the minor setback, I'll make this again. I used cream of celery soup, fresh garlic, and milk instead of water.

I was very impressed with this recipe. Because it was potatos I expected it to be fairly bland. It had so much flavor! My husband and his 18 yr old brother couldn't get enough. I will definately make it again!

I really liked this and thought it was really simple to make. The only change I made was to omit the salt since the cream soups tend to have quite a bit to begin with. I didn't think it needed it either. I'll definitely do this again and may take the advice of the other reviewer who suggested using polish sausage in place of the ham.

Made this for Sunday dinner. Had it cook while we were at the Rangers game. I doubled the recipe and used extra cheese, subsituted milk for the water, and used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of celery. So I basically did the recommendations of everyone. I would say it was alright. The entire family said it was just ok. Not a one really liked it. I do not think I will ever make it again.

I just had to add a little more to this recipe.  Just a little more garlic powder, I doubled the ham, and added 2 more cups of cheese.  It turned out just fine for us.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe and a great way to have dinner ready and waiting for my family.  I was able to spend the day with some friends and my kids still had a dinner that they loved when I got home!  Perfect!!!
P.S.  The more cheese, the better!

I made these for Easter and everyone loved them…I made things easier for myself I bought simply potatoes with onions and used them, and I mixed the cheese, I had a partial bag of Swiss and sharp cheddar cheese and used both. Will make again. I love any recipe for a slow cooker just so easy!

This was good, but not as good as traditional scalloped potatoes with ham cooked in the oven, and prep time was about same.  I will revert back to my old recipe when making this again.

Easy, delicious, and fast (for a slow cooker anyway).  I am eating this right now, and I love it.  All of my potatoes where getting old and soft/wrinkly, but you would never know. I also didn't have any ham on had so I substituted an equal amount of bacon ends and pieces!

I was skeptical about making this because I was certain it was going to come out watery rather than creamy.  I was wrong!  It came out very creamy and very tasty.  :o)  I have to admit I didn't follow the called for amounts of potato, ham, and onion - I "eyeballed" the ratio to sauce amount.  I probably used about 2 cups of cheese and added a half soup can of milk. Sprinkled with chopped chives before serving.

I made this at Holiday shopping time and since I could cook this in a crockpot and leave for several hours.  It was great to come home tired from shopping and have some of this comfort food.  Family really thought it was great too.

I followed the recipe to the "T" and thought that it came out very bland. My son on the other hand liked it. I think I'll stay with my Nana's recipe but thanks for a new way to try them in the slowcooker.

Pretty good, I doubled the amount of ham and cheese, used the cream of roasted garlic mushroom soup, milk instead of water. Next time I would cut back to 1/4 cup of milk/water as it was a bit thin. I left the lid off the cooker and let it sit for a while on the warm setting and it thickened up nicely.  I browned some panko crumbs in a little butter and sprinked on top for a little texture.  Nice!

Awesome! Made this veggie by omitting ham. Subbed cream of celery (with milk); used cheddar/mozzarella mix and added a handful of cheddar to top. Baked in oven per another reviewers recommendation @ 325d for 1.5 hrs. The top was crunchy, golden, cheesy goodness! Matched w/ creamy potatoes inside the texture was rockin'. Will make again for sure!

I absolutely loved these!! I did make a few changes-I used about a cup of diced onions, 1 and 1/2 cups of shredded cheddar and monterey jack mixed, and also a can of celery soup instead of mushroom. I also added more ham than the recipe called for.. These turned out very tasty!! Howver, I did cook them for 5 hours on high instead of the 4 that the recipe called for...

I fixed this when my parents came for dinner.  They and my husband loved it, but my kids and I weren't really crazy about it.  (Usually my kids will eat anything with potatoes and cheese, but not this one.)  Very simple, and I may try it again, but not my favorite.

Very easy and tasty - my husband is a big fan of ham and scalloped potatoes so I just had to make this for him! I did tweak the recipe a bit. I more than doubled the amount of ham and used a whole vidalia onion layering it in the crock pot first along with light shredded cheddar cheese. I mixed 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup with an equal can of fat free half and half vs. water.  I used fresh minced garlic vs. powdered. I poured that over everything and let it go on high for 4 hours. Since it didn't seem creamy enough I added 4 oz. light cream cheese and another 1/2 cup of shredded cheese. I cooked it for another two hours and it thickend up and was a lot creamier. My husband asked for seconds so it's a definite winner!

I took some of the other suggestions and used milk instead of water and I also used 2 cloves crushed garlic instead of the garlic powder.  Gave it a really garlic taste!  If you are not so found of garlic I would maybe only try 1 clove.  Also added 3 times the amount of cheese called for.  This has become a regular recipe in our household.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this last night.  I planned on having enough for leftovers tonight...WRONG!  Hubby went back 2nds and was even picking from the tupperware container.  Definitely a keeper.  I used the red potatoes, extra sharp cheese, a whole onion and 21 spice blend (Costco very good).  I omitted the salt because I'm on dialysis and try to eliminate it when I can.  Thank you for a great recipe

Made this with some leftover turkey ham, and it was flavorful and creamy! Used the healthy request cream of chicken soup, and followed advice of previous reviewers by using 2 cups of ham and placing water with nonfat milk. Put a splash of Tabasco in, and only used 2 1/2 lbs of potatoes (I have a small crockpot). Cooked 2 hours on low, then 3 on high. It was perfect, with crusty parts on the bottom! Used nonstick spray before starting, so cleanup wasn't too bad.

I did layer as suggested; used cr of chicken soup, garlic and 1 cup milk; sprinkled a little  cheese over each layer and the rest on top.  Used glass lasagna pan so wasn't very thick and cooked fine in oven for 1 1/2 hours. Next time I will double the ham (not chopped, small slices so as to not disappear) but all else the same. Great comfort food meal.

My family loved this recipe!!! I did read a few of the other reviews, as I always do before trying any recipe from this site, and used some of the suggestions. I layerd the potaotes,cheese and onion mix and used polish kielbasa instead of ham. I also mixed the sauce with milk instead of water which made it very creamy!!!

This was easy and came out pretty good so I'm sure I'll make it again.  I doubled the ham and onions because it looked like it needed more, glad I did but with the extra ham I should have omitted the salt, will do that next time.  With the additions I could only fit about 2.5 pounds of potatoes in the crock pot.  I layered everything as others suggested and cooked on low overnight, about 9 hours.  It wasn't greasy like most scalloped potato recipes but the texture was different.  Not bad, just different.

Fantastic recipe.  I didn't have 4 hours until dinner so I cooked it for 1 hour @ 350 in the oven.  I also layered the ingredients.  It was great!!

I made this for Easter too.  It was very good!  I used 2 cups of cheese and replaced the water with nonfat milk.  I also omitted the ham since we had ham as part of the meal.  The best part of this is using the slow cooker so I didn't have to turn the oven on--a huge plus when living in Phoenix!

I loved this idea.  First time to try scalloped potatoes in a slow cooker and with a few changes it turned out to be one of the family's favorites.  I left out the cheese and garlic powder and put a full ham slice bone in on top of the potatoes as they cooked.  And added kernel corn on each layer. The flavour of the ham went through the potatoes.  I also put another spin on it by laying pork chops on top.  Both versions were absolutely stupendous.

Made this for dinner last night.  Used up all the potatoes I had before they went bad.  I also cut up a celery stalk, in addition to the onion.  I used the lower sodium cream of mushroom soup.  I followed other reviewers advice and used milk instead of water.  Didn't have only cheddar on hand, used cheddar and Colby mix.  And used 2 cups of leftover frozen Christmas ham.  Yum!  I felt Luke adding some frozen corn as it smelled so good. Vi cooked the corn separately, but added it in when I served it.  My toddler inhaled it.  I couldn't shovel it to him fast enough.  My 7 yr old is going through the "everything tastes gross" phase, so it was a battle to get him to eat it.  I'll only make this if I have the ingredients on hand.  Thanks for the comfort recipe.

It was okay, but I don't feel the need to make it again. It was very salty. I really think some more flavor is needed. Maybe a blend of cheese rather than plain cheddar. The cooking directions and texture were okay. My husband and I just found it bland.

I made this without ham, since I was bringing it to a friend's dinner where the main dish was ham. I took some of the other suggestions - used milk instead of water, doubled the cheese, layered the ingredients. Also cooked for about 6 hours on low before unplugging and bringing it to dinner, where it sat for another 1.5 hours on high. I was worried that the potatoes were still underdone, but they were just about right.... could have been a little bit more cooked, for my taste, but everyone else said they were great. And I sliced the potatoes really thin. I think next time I would add even more cheese, and fresh garlic. Thanks for the recipe - slow cooker recipes are the best for potlucks and dinners where everyone is pitching in.

This turned out wonderfully. I doubled the cheddar cheese and ham, and omitted the onion. Also, since I ran out of time-had to put into the oven at 350 for a little over an hour. Can't wait to actually do it now in the slow cooker! Big hit at our Bible study tonight!

Excellent recipe. Made this for Easter dinner. I added minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I did not have cream of mushroom on hand, so I used cream of potato soup with 1/2 cup of milk. I also added more cheese. The leftovers tasted just as yummy. This is a keeper!

Very good Easter meal! I used cream of celery since I didn't have cream of mushroom and used up cheddar, mont. jack, and mozz. I had left in the fridge. Sometimes I'll even add cream cheese or sour cream. Lots of room to be creative!

This recipe is the ultimate in family-friendly comfort food. I made this as written, and absolutely loved the results! I saw no need to add extra water...there was plenty of the soup mixture to cover all of the other ingredients. This came out perfectly creamy and yummy! The only change I made was to double the recipe and layer it in my slow cooker instead of mixing it all together...I put in a layer of potatoes, then a layer of the cheese/onion/ham mixture, and than a layer of the soup mix. I repeated this process and made about 4 layers altogether. It was super easy to make, and my family absolutely loved it! Thanks for sharing...this one is definitely going to be a regular in my meal rotation!

I love this recipe.  I used the ingredients listed but cooked them in the oven on 350 for 1&1/2 hours.  I put 1/2 the potatoes in a baking dish them put all the ham onions and cheese on top of the potatoes, then added the rest of the potatoes, mixed the garlic powder, salt and pepper with the cream of mushroom soup, poured it over the top of everything, covered and baked.  We love these potatoes.

Smelled awesome and had good flavor, but I don't know if anyone experienced what I did: the potatoes turned black in the crockpot.  It looked great until you spooned into the middle :( so I picked off the yummy cheese off the top and tossed the rest.   I will probably try this recipe in the oven instead of the crockpot.

This was a really good recipe.  The only thing I will do differently next time is not add the salt or a little less.  I think the ham added enough salt.  I used milk instead of water too, which I think made it almost to rich, so next time I will use half milk and half water. I also ended up putting in the oven for about an hour because my family was getting a little restless for dinner.  Other than that it was pretty good and I think that I am going to take it to my mothers for Easter dinner for a side dish.

This was good and easy.  A few tips I used from other reviewers: I doubled the onions, cheese and ham & used cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom & milk instead of water.  If I make again, I'll use 1 C cheddar and 1 C sharp cheddar.  This would make a good side dish too.  My sister already wants the recipe!

I would have given this a 5, but since I had to alter the recipe I gave it a 4. Instead of spending time peeling & slicing potatoes, I used a 32oz bag of frozen southern style hash brown potatoes. I also doubled the amount of ham & cheese & used cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom. I started out cooking it on high, but changed it to low after 2 1/2 hours - it would have burnt if I left it on high. With these changes, it was quite yummy and EASY!

I only gave this a 4 star due to having to make several changes. I did look at many reviews before making this and I'm glad I did. 

I like others doubled the amount of ham and cheese. I also added a 10.5 oz can of cheese soup and a 10.5 oz of cream of chicken soup. Due to Campbells soup being salty, I omitted the salt.

It turned out very well and I will fix again. For the reviews I read that said they had to cook longer to get the potatoes tender, it had to be due to them sliceing the potatoes to thick. I did slice them very thin and did not need any additional cooking time.

I read through all the reviews before making this and it turned out very well.  The suggestions to leave out salt, add more ham and cook longer helped to make this a very tasty dish.  It's definately worth making again.

This was my first time attempting homemade scalloped potatoes as I usually just add ham to the Betty Crocker box stuff and it was delicious! I did double it since we are big eaters. I used milk instead of water so itd be more creamy. My 14yr old is a pretty finicky eater and she really liked it. My husband said I'm a better cook than Betty Crocker..lol

Super easy to fix and tasted great!! I cooked on high in crockpot for 4hrs but will cook for 5 hours next time to make the potatoes a bit more creamy. I will also omit the salt, its not needed with the cheese and ham there is plenty of sodium. Also.used full can milk with the soup instead of water. Great recipe and my husband and daughters ages 3 and 5 loved it!!!

I made this in two 8" pans (cooked one, frozen one - cooking for only 2 people). Substituted milk for water and used 1 clove of garlic instead of powder. Left eveything else the same. Layered potatoes, ham, onion, cheese twice and poured soup mix over the top. Baked covered 325 degrees for 1-1/2 hours. Really good flavor. Will add more ham next time. Definitely a keeper recipe!

This was an average recipe. My sweet husband made it following the directions as printed. It was ready when I got home with our children. That aspect is always awesome with a slow cooker meal. As written, I feel it lacked flavor. My husband and I loaded it up with hot sauce. My kids ate it with BBQ sauce. I think more ham and more cheese might make a difference.

We really liked this!  Made 1/2 the recipe, using 1 cup cheese and 1 cup ham.  Next time I'll use all the soup/water combo and make sure some goes down the sides, had some issues with burning.  (Also used about 1 tsp dried onion flakes as husband does not care for discernible pieces of onion in his food.) 3 hours on HI would have been plenty. Next time I will leave out the extra salt too!

Absolutely Awesome.  This is a great way to use up potatoes that are sprouting.  Just slice up and whah lah you have a great side for the next couple of meals. I have made these with ham as a meal and without as a side dish.  Everything you need is just in your cupboard.

I have made this recipe a couple of times.  It is a great recipe for left over ham.  I add the ham, at least double what the recipe calls for,  when the potato's are close to being done.  I also double the sauce recipe.

My husband said this is one of his favorite meals.  I don't follow the measurements exact and it always turns out great.  We definitely like more cheese and I usually layer the ingredients.  Have also made this using frozen diced potatoes when in a time crunch and it turns out good but 4 hours on high makes them kind of mushy so would reduce the time.

My husband loved this and ate several large helpings. My kids thought it was okay. I did not like at all. I can never find potatoes of this kind to compare with the ones my mom makes. I am glad my hubby liked it though. It was too runny for my taste. I didn't really measure just guessed at ingredients so probably made a difference. at least everyone ate it, which is more than I can say for some recipes.

These were very delicious.  I added extra ham and cheese to mine and doubled the recipe as well.  I don't think I did a good job of dividing the soup mixture though because one pan was dry and the other had plenty of sauce.  I also spiced one up with Hot Shot and crushed peppers - they loved it!

This was a good recipe. It made plenty for my family of 5. The kids ate it, but they werent thrilled about it. I had leftover and I served it on butter toast the next day and I think it went over better like that! lol I will probably make it again, but for an adult crowd this time :)

Use 1/2 inch thick slices of ham and layer the ingredients.  Sliced onion is nicer and use milk not water for a heartier meal.

This is a great recipe, the only thing I did differently was used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom. Only because some in my family do not like mushrooms. I omitted the salt, figuring there was enough in the soup and ham. This is a very good, basic and easy recipe. It's obviously not fancy, gourmet food but very down-home, comfort kind of food!

I added 2 crowns of broccoli and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper.  We served it with brats soaked in beer for 24 hours.  It was a perfect meal.    Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Try it with the broccoli! ;)

Since I usually cook/bake for only myself, I need to half the recipes. This I did and I put it in my small cooker.  It was excellent. Good idea for ham leftovers.

Very good recipe.  I cooked it in the oven for 1 hour at 350 degrees in a 9x13 and it came out great.  It was a family hit.  Will definately make again.

Yum!  I used milk instead of water and doubled the ham and cheese.  I also took another reviewer's suggestion and layered the recipe.  I'll definitely be making this again soon.

This was great!  I made it with low-fat mushroom soup, fat-free cheddar cheese and I used non-fat milk instead of the water.  I also microwaved the potato slices and onions for about 10 minutes before doing the rest of the recipe.  I didn't have time for the slow cooker so I put it in a 8x11 dish sprayed with Pam and baked at 375 for about 35 minutes.  My husband was very pleased with the flavor and texture.. so this is definately a keeper!

Thanks for the recipe, but this was not for us.  I was able to save it by adding a can of potato soup and cheddar cheese soup, then put it all in another pan topped with more cheese and bacon bits until cheese was melted. With my revisions hubby came back for seconds but as written we did not care for it. I love slower cooker recipes so keep them coming!

This was a very good recipe.  I did have to make some changes because I realized while I was putting it together I did not have an onion or Cream of Mushroom soup.  Instead I used Cream of Chicken and a packet of Onion Soup mix seasoning.  I also used Red Potatoes and left the skin on.  I added milk instead of Water as mentioned in many other reviews.  My two year old loved this.  I will make it again.

a great and easy recipe, like other suggestions id did use half and half cream instead of milk, doubled the ham, and used a tex mex cheese blend and it up the wow factor for this dish. I think using a regular cheddar cheese would have been bland. Also used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom.

I will make this one of my favorites for sure.  I did make some minor changes.  I used 1 can of cheddar cheese soup and 1 can of cream of celery soup and 1 cup of milk instead of the cream of mushroom soup and water.  I also used 3 cups of ham and about 3 cups of shredded cheese, I used mexican blend....by doing these changes, especially the addition of more ham made for a meal in itself.  Also, my crockpot took longer to cook than the recipe stated, about 61/2 hours but worth waiting for.....YUMMO!!!

My family LOVED this recipe! I followed some of the other suggestions and used the Cream of Mushroom soup with garlic and still added the 1/2 tsp. garlic powder. We also double the amount of ham (cut into 1/4" cubes) and used 1-1/2 cups cheese. I cooked it on high for 5 hours. When putting it into the crockpot, it definitely helps to layer the potatoes, cheese/onion/ham mixture, and the soup as you do not want to stir this until the very end to prevent breaking up the potato slices.

I will definitely make this recipe again!!

Followed others advise and left this in the crock for about 6 hours - 3 hrs on high and then turned it down.  Great way to feed a crowd for not a lot of money and everyone was impressed.  We did double the cheese and ham which made it a hearty meal for the Bear's NFC Championship game - Go Bears!

i made this recipe for the first time as a side dish for our new year's day dinner... what a big mistake!  i had to triple the recipe so i used 2 cans of cream of broccli soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom.  we cooked them on high for nearly 8 hours and they still weren't done and the potatoes were sliced very thin.  they didn't taste good at all (maybe it was my choice of soup?) and i felt like my guests were choking them down.

This tasted good and was very easy.  However, I would use more cheese and another can of cream soup next time.  There just wasn't enough sauce for my taste.  Also, it was plenty salty even without added salt.  I'll use lower-sodium canned soups next time as well.  I used cream of potato soup.

This was very good.  I must say, though that I made changes as I thought would be good.  I hate to make reviews when I made changes from the original recipe, but it does seem to be such a good base to add your own tastes to.  I made the recipe MUCH larger and put in my large slow cooker.  I used both mushroom and cream of celery soup, velveeta, and shredded cheddar cheese.  Very good and adaptable recipe.  I was afraid of putting that much milk-based products in my slow cooker, but it worked out well.  The cheese burned a bit on the edges and side of cooker, but was good despite and turned out  better than I would have thought!! I also added some garlic cloves and heavy cream.  YUM!

This was nice and creamy.  I shouldn't have added the salt, however, because with the ham and soup, it was too salty for me.  Next time, I will wait until it's cooked to see if it needs any.  Otherwise, It was very, very good.

These were great! My crockpot is a bit weird, so I need to do some tweeking with the cooking time... They were a bit overdone, but still tasted wonderful. My husband absolutely raved about them! I can only imagine how much these will improve when I figure out just how long to cook them for! The only changes I made, after reading other reviews, was to substitute the water with one can of milk (using the cr. of mushroom soup can. I also added about a cup of mozzerella cheese, in addition to the cheddar, because it needed to be used, and sounded good. Thanks for a great recipe!

I didn't get any fresh out of the slow cooker, but I'm eating leftovers for lunch today.  It's very soupy.  I added some cornstarch last night and it helped some.  Next time I'll omit the water.  I also don't care for the mushroom soup, so I'll probably use cheddar or something.  I'd make it again though.  Easy to throw together and not bad tasting.

I've made this recipe for years with a few changes. I do not peel the potatoes just scrub well and slice thin. Then I slice the onion. I usually use 2 cans of soup (have used reduced fat and regular) and I do not add water. I usually use co-jack cheese and add more. A great way to use up ham!! I just layer it all in a crock and turn it on. It is awesome!!!

This is a really really good recipe.  My teenage daughter passed on going out with friends because of the smell coming from the slow cooker - she didn't want to miss out on the dinner it smelled so good!  I used sharp cheese - doubled it and the ham.  A bit on the salty side but all-in-all a very good recipe.   Will make again.

This was really good.  I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom. I was running short on time the morning I fixed this, so I used a bag of frozen southern style hashbrowns instead of regular potatoes and cooked it on low for about 6-7 hours.

These were the best.  I made a few changes-- I added an extra cup of cheddar cheese and a 1/4 lb of velveeta, I didn't have any onion so I used onion powder, I used milk in place of the water and I added alot more ham.  I'm not sure how much ham it added up to I just added until it had the amount we liked. I also diced my potatoes instead of slicing them.  Mine didn't burn on the bottom.  I cooked it on high for about 5 hrs and I stirred it twice.

This was very good and fairly easy (the potatoes are a little time-consuming).  I sliced the potatoes thinly, put it in the crockpot on high, and it was done in about 2 1/2 hours.  The stuff on the bottom got a little brown on high but my husband and I fought over it!

i made these with garlic jack cheese and maybe that was just too much garlic, but i didn't think this recipe was anything fabulous.  i will give it a try again with cheddar, though.

But as in other reviews i made some modifications.  I used 1 can milk and 1 of half and half. I lasted the potatoes ham onions and sliced some mushrooms and layered them on top of onions then added a thin layer sharp cheddar. For  5qt crock you can adjust for as big a casserole you want. I added more ham cause we had so much left from Easter.  I also lightly sauted 2 finely minced cloves garlic  added cream of mushroom soup the cream,milk and Swanson concentrated liquid chicken broth  (i don't have a problem w too much salt)  I don't add extra salt anywhere in recipe. I use white pepper when layering because its not as spicy as black pepper and adds a very unique delicious flavor. I preheated liquids because i was a little late getting  it all together due to shattered rt lower forearm and wouldn't you know im rt handed but love to cook. Lol  another tip preheat your crock while your prepping ingredients.  And to round off supper the last 5 to 10 minutes  i topped with baby spinach and and an Italian mixture of 5 grated cheeses. Oh so good and you'll learn  to love your spinach. And you have a complete meal. I gave recipe 5stars because basic recipe has great potential.

I don't think my slow cooker gets hot enough, I ended up putting this in the oven to cook the potatoes.  The mushroom soup gave it really weird taste for me.

I really really hate rating recipes low, but gosh these really didn't turn out. After half the cook time, the liquid was the consistency of water. I decided at that point to add a little half and half and flour. Still by the time they were done the liquid was still watery like. I let the potatoes cool down and the little bit of liquid soaked right in them and seemed to disappear. The potatoes almost tasted like boiled potatoes that came from a can. Some of the potatoes even browned tasting bitter or tinny tasting. My only change was leaving out the ham. That would not affect the liquid texture. If anything it may have helped with the potatoes not tasting too salty. I followed the directions otherwise. If I would have read some of the more critical reviews I would have read about the flavor issue and consistency of the liquid. Now, to create some sauce to see if I can give the potatoes some type of coating, flavor, or richness, I guess.

4 hours would not have been enough. It went 5 hours and potatoes were almost done.  I added more cheese, more black pepper, and more water to the recipe.  I needed the water as it looked like it was sticking (to a slow cooker liner) and not going to come out like I hoped.  I saw that someone cooked on low for 7, that might have been better, and using milk rather than water as someone else suggested.  I'd make it again - but plan to cook on low all day - and add a lot more cheese and try the milk.

Easy ingredients but needs a bit more. We cooked in the oven (350/90 minutes). Layered a 13X9 greased pan with 3 layers. Potatoes, soup mix, cheese/repeat. Top 3rd layer reversed soup/cheese so that cheese was on top. Did not add ham but put a layer of bacon over the top. Added A LOT more cheese then called for. Just took bag of preshredded cheese and layered medium-heavy on each layer. Turned out superb. Bacon was an awesome addition & the taste permeated throughout the dish even though we only put it on the top.  EASY Delicious recipe.

I made this for a potluck and everyone really enjoyed it.  I read many of the reviews and made a few modifications.  I added an additional cup of cheese and ham and I used only 1/2 of the soup and in it's place added a cream cheese and sour cream.   I also baked it in the oven - 325 degree for 1 1/2 hours and then kept it warm in the crackpot - due to time constraints.  Great recipe.  I will use again.

We love this, but we make it just a little differently. First, we have a 6 QT crockpot so this puts our potatoes in a thinner layer on the bottom of the dish. This means the potatoes cook a little faster. Also, I don't slice potatoes anymore in any scalloped potato recipe. instead I cube it up fairly small, like 1/2 inch to 1/4 inch pieces. I use cream of celery for allergy reasons but also it has good flavor. I also use fresh garlic, one extra large clove. I didn't have ham but I did have a big bag of bacon bits from Costco, and figured it would actually taste better that way. I added a 1/4 cup milk on top of the water and probably had an extra lb of potato in there too but the flavor was really spectacular. We occasionally cook a ring of (pre-cooked) sausage on top of these, poke it so the juices run and away we go!

I have been making this recipe since Campbell's Soup put out their original cookbook back in the 60's. I omit the cheese and I place a layer of potatoes, then onions, then ham and keep repeating layers. Then cover with soup mixture. As I do not have a slow cooker, I put it in A 2 QUART CASSEROLE DISH, COVER AND BAKE AT 375 FOR 1 HOUR.I THEN REMOVE COVER FOR THE REMAINING 1/2 HOUR. Any leftovers are really good fried the next day.

I use smoked ham slices and didn't measure anything.  I like lots of all of the ingredients.
I put everything into one bowl.  To ensure the potatoes got cooked, after I put it into the slow cooker bowl, I put it into the microwave for 15+ minutes and then into the slow cooker.  
Every drop was gone.  This is a keeper.

Followed recipe exactly, except used previous suggestion of the water/cream of tartar step to prevent browning of potatoes.  Smelled okay, but didn't turn out like I envisioned scalloped potatoes to be.  Will not make again.

Great base ~ made a couple of little additions. I added a tin of Cheddar Cheese soup to the mix and about 1/2 cup of water. I also added 1 Tbsp of garlic butter. TKX for the recipe.

I liked it, but I like a bunch of other scalloped potato recipes more than this one.  I'm thinking I'll just use my other ones and stick them in the crockpot, loved that aspect!

I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only thing I changed was I used onion powder instead of chopped because the kids won't eat it if they see it.  I will make it again but I will leave out the salt, they said it was too salty, I guess the ham or soup we used must have had salt also.  I may add a little extra water too because it was kinda dry and starting to stick to the pan after 3 hours. Other than that we really like it so we will try again with adjustments.

This was delicious! Like someone else had suggested, I cooked it in the oven at 325 for 1 1/2 hours. I also cut up 4 pieces of bacon and put it on the top (raw) before I baked it. Not that it needed it, I just love an excuse to eat bacon!  My husband and kids loved it!

I thought this was very good and easy!  I didn't have any cream of mushroom, so I used cream of chicken.  I didn't want ham, so I just left that out.  I also added some more cheese and used the 1 can of milk instead of water, like others did and it came out great!  I cooked them on low for about 5 hours.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks!

Tastes wonderful....but I followed the directions and put it on high for 4 hours, and the potatoes were still crunchy, at 6 hours they were perfect.  I also used milk instead of water.

This was  fantastic and EASY.  The only revisions I made was I used 2 cups of cheddar cheese, and I mixed everything up quite well before I turned it on.  I was concerned about there not being enough moisture, but it was perfect.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours, then turned it down to "keep warm" and had dinner an hour later.  Big hit with my family.

A great recipe.  I used onion powder instead of the real thing as I have a picky child who can spot a piece of onion that even the keenest onion hater would miss.(perhaps he will become some kind of phorensic detective in adult life).  In any case, this was the perfect family fare recipe.  Tasty and creamy and can even stand alone as a main dish.  The only thing I did was to leave the lid off on high for about 30 min. to thicken up the sauce a little.  The recipe also should say to slice the potatoes as thin as possible in order for every piece to be fully cooked.

Scalloped Potatoes and Ham is one of my favorite meals - so I was excited to try a new version, especially one I could make in the crockpot.  But, this version was not good - very salty and really not much flavor at all.  I used cream of potato soup instead of cream of mushroom because husband hates mushrooms, but I think the com would have made it even saltier.  I also added more cheese, as some of the other reviews said (and also liking my cheeseier), and it wasn't enough at all.  It didn't taste like there was any cheese in the whole thing.  I guess bottom line is that it didn't have any real flavor.

I made this dish tonight for dinner and it was absolutely delicious. My alterations were, using cream of chicken soup, subbing milk for water and using mozzarella in addition to the cheddar.  I will definitely make this dish again, simple to make and quite satisfying.

This was excellent! I made a few changes... I do not like cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of broccoli and I used a soup can of milk instead of the water. My husband and I couldn't get enough of it.

My family thought this was a very tasty dish. I used leftover Xmas ham that I had chopped and placed in the freezer, so it was very quick to throw this dish together. While we were away at basketball games, it was cooking. We were able to come home and sit down to a warm meal even though on the run most of the day. The only variation I chose was to use milk in place of the water. It was very creamy.

Good recipe - relatively quick and easy. I followed a couple of suggestions in previous reviews and my husband and I loved it. Use milk instead of water and the salt really isn't needed.

This was good, but not amazing.  If I do it again, I will  add more ham (ideally larger cubes instead of the thinly-sliced deli meat that I had on hand) and more cheese.

If I may tweak the recipe a tad, I used smoked Gouda cheese with a 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese to add some more flavors. You can't go wrong with this dish!

We love this recipe. I double everything but the potatoes, and use hickory flavored spiral sliced ham chopped up. I used milk instead of water and no salt ham is already salty enough. The hickory gives this dish an awesome flavor. The leftovers are terrific too and I usually hate leftovers.

I used milk instead, added a little more cheese and layered all the ingredients.  I used bacon instead of ham.  It was delicious.  Cooked on high for 5 hours and it was just right.  My family of 6 either loved it or tolerated it which is pretty high praise.

Looking for ways to use left over ham & stumbled across this recipe. No time for slow cooking so we tossed it in the oven and baked it at 350 for an hour as suggested by another reviewer. We also used milk instead of water and added a bit more cheese. The kids are already asking if we can make it again next week!

.. The kids & I thought it was ok. The hubby liked it, but he adds hot peppers to everything.  I didn't think it had enough flavor. We will try it again and throw some flavors in, cuz it was so easy to make. I am a crock pot cooking Fan. ! Thanks.

Yummy. Many different steps to prepare it, but worth it. The recipe called for minced onion and garlic powder. I changed that to sauteed yellow onion in butter, with fresh garlic.  I think that makes it taste more, authentic.   An added bonus, the house smells great!

This was so quick and easy and tasty. DH loved it, said it reminded him of being a kid when his mom used to make it. It is also pretty healthy for you, I am on a specific diet and it works well for it. Definitely would recommend and will make again.

This is a really great recipe......I used onion powder instead of onion and alos doubled the ham. I used a 26 oz can of cream of mushroom soup and about a cup of milk.  4 large baker potatoes.  The only problem I had was after 4 hours the potatoes were still a little firm.... Maybe I didnt give it enough time.  At the end I added some corn starch to thicken and it turned out good.  My husband said he couldnt eat anymore or he would burst. I think that it needs more like 6 hours on high stirring occassionaly or 6-8hours on low........otherwise awesome!!!!

I had ham left-over from Christmas dinner and used it in this recipe successfully.  The flavor was a little bland to my palate, but actually I think it tasted how scalloped potatoes with ham is supposed to taste.  My "meat and potatoes" husband loved it.

This recipe was great. I liked how easy it was as well as the taste. My kids also liked it!
I agree some other reviewers. I added more cheese and ham double. I used milk instead of water. 
I think my crockpot is not working correctly because the potatoes weren't cooked after 4 hours. Needs to be on low for longer.

For two reasons my Fiance just loved it and it had the right amount of moisture for the slow cooker. I did not have to add any more liquid like I normally have to to slow cooker recipes.  I did do the add in's that the other reviews remarked about. I added twice the ham, and used whole milk instead of the water. Also I added about twice or more of the cheese.

After reading other reviews, I changed this slightly.  I used 1 1/2 lbs of small russett potatoes, a 16oz pkg of diced ham and 2 cups of shredded cheddar.  I also used a can of cream of asparagus soup with about 1/3 c milk, instead of the cream of mushroom and water.  I added chopped fresh parsely, spinach and garlic, and substituted a shallot for the onion.  Most of these changes were because of what I had on hand.  It was delicious, but it did come out pretty salty so I will probably omit that next time.  A fantastic base recipe!

I would say this recipe deserves 4 stars only after changes have been made. I added extra ham, cheese, used heavy cream instead of water and added a few other spices(cayenne, garlic powder). I cooked for 5 hours on high in my crock pot and the potatoes were not even close to being done and they were watery.  I put them in a casserole dish minus the liquid and put some extra cheese on the top and finished them in the oven. It was pretty tasty after finishing in the oven, but very salty, so I would recommend not adding any extra salt. I may try this again in the oven but I would not ever make it again in the crock pot.

I read the previous reviews and so I was skeptical about the amounts in this recipe.  I decided to follow the recipe exactly (even weighed the potatoes on my kitchen scale) and indeed found it to be way off.  Either the potatoes need to be halved or the rest need to be doubled.  It was so dry and bland!  I did cook this is the oven at 350 for almost two hours instead of the crock pot, but that would not have changed the taste.  I gave this one star because it is edible, although not at all enjoyable.  We did give it try, but then threw it all out and ordered take out.

Very Good. I doubled the ham and added some butter pats. Also made in layers. This could be made in the oven when in a hurry. Tasty and i'd make again.

Very very good, although it needs a little more liquid than the recipe calls for.  I added a generous splash or two of milk and it turned out fine.

Very tasty.  I added more onion, cheese and ham as recommended, and instead of mushroom soup, added garlic mushroom soup.  I look for ease and this is right up there!  A definate repeat.

These potatoes were awesome! I baked them in the oven for about 2 hrs. and they came out great. I've used the cream of mushroom and also tried cream of onion... yum! Thank you for submitting it.

I made this as is minus the salt. It was a good side dish. I used the food processor to slice the potatoes so they were very thin but still took about five and a half hours to cook probably down to my crock pot. Thanks.

This recipe is so versatile! I prefer to use Cream of Celery soup and a 3/4 can of milk instead. I also add some Old Bay, and paprika. You could easily increase the liquid to make this a soup recipe.

My mother-in-law gave me this exact recipe when I was first married. It has been a long time favorite of mine. I use whatever cream soup I have on hand but cream of celery is my favorite. I also kind of just eyeball the cheese. I usually use closer to 2 cups. I usualy use leftover ham but I love it so much sometimes I just use lunchmeat. I even take this to work for potlucks and get many requests for the recipe.

Very good.  I took some of the reviewers' advice and doubled the onion and added half a can of cream of cheddar soup and it was delish.  Oh, and I baked it in the oven for about 1 1/2 hours at 350.  Only thing I'll try next time is adding more cheese.

This was a great recipe - I did make a few changes though - I used milk instead of water w/ the soup, and added both chopped onions and sliced fresh mushrooms.  Will make this again - so easy.

Not a bad recipe for a side dish - not as the main meal though!  I too used cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom.  And I added 4 cups of ham instead of 1.  Definitely omit the added salt.  I sliced my potatoes quite thinly and put my slow cooker on LOW  - I expected it to cook for more than 4 hours as other reviewers commented - but I guess I sliced these tatters just right - it was done in 4 hours!

disappointed.  We didn't care for the taste.  We are not fans of cream of mushroom soup.  It was not as cheesey and creamy as I would have liked.  Will not make again.

Tasted really good, but after 4 hours in the slow cooker, the potatoes were still half raw. I ended up putting them in the microwave to finish them off because I had people waiting to eat.

Loved this recipe! So did the picky kids. Made it as is the first time, and changed it a bit the second. Instead of cream of mushroom I used cheddar cheese soup, and velveeta instead of cheddar to please the kids! YUMMY!

this wasn't bad, i used velveeta instead of cheddar, smoked sausage instead of ham, and cream of celery soup instead of mushroom.  i used more cheese and sausage than the recipe called for.  i cooked this at 350 for a couple of hours in the oven. be sure to let it set for 10-15 minutes before serving so it's not so runny.

I used this recipe as a spring board for scalloped potatoes.  I used onion powder, twice the ham, extra cheese, and cream of potato soup.  It was tasty, and received pretty good reviews from the family.  My only complaint would be that it took so long to cook-I went way over the four hours.  I can say it's a great way to use up ham leftovers, and I'll probably make this agian soon.

This doesn't really even deserve a star at all but one is my lowest option.  The flavor was horrible.  My boyfriend asked me to make him this because it sounded like something his grandmother used to make when he was a child.  I was embarrased to even serve this to him.  I actually cried.  Will never make again.

THIS IS AN EXTREMELY EASY DISH! It's great for the whole family...I gave the recipe to my boyfriend's mom since she and her husband LOVES it! I do too! I added extra cup of cheese since I am a cheese freak. :) I will add a little more of water and add some more ham. And cross out salt since ham is salty. I used brown sugar ham and it taste so WONDERFUL. I cooked it for 4-5 hrs. Thanks for the recipe to share!!!

This dish is not a keeper for us. It was "ok" but my teenagers barely ate it. It was too cheesy and I omitted the salt. It was a bit greasy. I found this recipe was easy, my daughter put it together in the a.m. and we ate when I came home, but I am not trying this one again.

This was an "ok" recipe...the potatoes took longer than anticipated to get done, and my family wasn't thrilled with it at all.  The flavors were a good combination though, making a tasty sauce. I thought it would be good with the leftover ham from Christmas dinner, but will try something different next time.

Nice basic family meal.  I did it in the oven though as I didn't have all day - still tasted great.  My 3 yr old who doesn't like potatoes loved this one and asked to have it again the next day

Not sure what I did wrong with this recipe, but I had to leave it in the slow cooker for an extra 45 minutes in order to fully cook the potatoes. This recipe was OK, but not tops on our family's list.

This recipe is very easy and very delicious. I doubled it and used 2 lbs of kielbasa, 2 cans of cream of celery, 1 cup of milk, 4 cups of cheddar, more cheese is better, and 2 cups of onion. I layered as suggested by others. I cooked on low for 6 hours. It was a bit soupy but a few spoonfuls of instant potatoes took care of that. Will definitely make again and will be adding broccoli to my leftovers...

I made this, for the first time, yesterday it came out great! The only item I left out was the ham which I had on the side. I kind of questioned the only 1/2 cup of water added but followed the directions and this dish is probably better than the one I normally make in the oven.

This was great!! I made it for Easter so I didn’t want to put the ham in it since I was also cooking ham. I cannot handle onions so I excluded that also. I used exactly 3lbs white potatoes. I mixed a good amount of garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper into the mushroom soup then mixed that into the potatoes. Then added the cheese throughout the crockpot. I cooked it on low for 6 hrs (cut the potatoes thin) I never cook on high. I obviously added cheese on top towards the end. I’d say 30-40 mins depending on the type of cheese. This was really good!!

Mixed this recipe with the Betty Crocker recipe and used more of some ingredients.  Took advice from others to mix the potatoes, onions, and ham, and to spray the crock with Pam.  It still had some stuff stuck on the sides of the crock, but much less than it would have.  

Used milk instead of water with soup.  I minced 2 garlic cloves and added to the potato/onion mixture instead of using garlic powder, 1.5 cups ham, and went about 1.5-2 cups of cheese, because we love cheese.  I was afraid it wouldn't have the soup flavor throughout, so I stirred it a little after I poured the soup over the potatoes.  4.5 hours on high and it was amazing!  Will make again.  So happy to have found this comfort food recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Very bland! Like others, I used milk instead of water. added extra seasoning and extra cheese. The consistency was soupy, so had to cook forever. Cream of Mushroom just didn't work in this. Could be better with a can of Cheddar  Cheese soup, maybe. Would not make again.

Used cream of chicken & mushroom soup instead of plain cream of mushroom, added extra garlic and cooked on low for 7 hours (could have gone a little longer as I left my potato slices a little thicker).

I will surely make this again.  The only change I made was to sub out the cream soup with a homemade version made with butter, flour, garlic, onion, and cream.  I just prefer it over the canned variety, especially the lower sodium content.  Layered the ingredients as other readers suggested.

I increased the servings to 12 because cousin is home from college,,,,he eats all day! Leftovers were even better! I would add more cheese, perhaps a blend...Did not cook for the entire 4 hours. It was starting to burn at about 3 hours, 15 minutes. i also added a little more salt to my own portion. Overall, and from the college student, it was delicious!!!!!

I made a few adjustments. Heavy cream replaced water. 2 minced garlic cloves replaced the powder. Browned the ham before cutter by into cubes. Sautéed onions and garlic prior to mixing into potatoes.

This was delicious. I added more onion, sliced in the food processor along with the potato. Also added a couple of chopped jalapenos & pepper jack cheese. Cooked it for 5-6 hours. The small amount of leftovers reheated very well! I didn't add the ham as this was the side dish to some fish.

I made this for dinner tonight and I really liked it. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 was because of how heavy the dish was.  I guess I should have known but geesh, I ate a small amount and needed a nap! It would be great for the winter time for sure. After reading all the reviews, I doubled the ham and the cheese and substituted milk for water and cooked it on low iny crock pot for 7-8 hours. It was really thick and creamy and quite tasty. I will be making this again for sure... But not when it's 80 degrees out again!

Scalloped potatoes is a layered dish. So you do a layer of potatoes, a layer of cheese/meat/onion, another layer of potatoes, another layer of meat etc. Last layer should be potatoes.

If you like cheese on top, put that on the last 30 minutes or so. That way it melts, but doesn't dissolve into the sauce.

"put in the crock pot"  Which? The 1.5 quart, the 5 quart or the 10 quart? The 5 quart was perfect, and it makes 10 servings at least.

I do not use canned soup. Instead, I made a sauce of 4 cups of cashew milk, 2T mushroom powder, .5t salt, and garlic and onion powder to taste.  This is considerably more liquid that the recipe called for, but made a really rich creamy sauce.

I followed the directions except I doubled the ham. I would possibly reduce,if not omit the salt because of the ham. It was DELICIOUS!!! Great food for football game! Everyone can grab when they want it. Very tasty!!!

I doubled the ham and soup, low sodium mixed with milk. Doubled the cheese and added a brick of shredded home smoked cheddar. 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika, stirred well. Crock pot on high for four hours. Removed lid and cooked for two more hours to reduce and thicken the sauce. Good recipe.

This was amazingly delicious. I followed the basic recipe, but made some slight changes as per the comments. I used milk instead of water, added another cup of cheese, and added some paprika and lots of garlic salt. I wasn't able to make this in a crock pot since I'm at work for too long. I cooked it at 350 for two hours and it still wasn't done, so I turned it up to 375 and cooked it for another hour. Moral of the story:  it takes forever to cook potatoes in the oven so do it on the weekend, or use the crock pot if you can.

I liked the potential of this recipe as it wasn't as high in cheese, butter, etc. that make most potato dishes delicious. Unfortunately, we really didn't like it. 

Even with doubling the cheese and using milk instead of water - it came out pretty gross. It was not cheesy at all. 

I would not recommend it nor will I make it again.

We did not like this, but I think it would be good if we doubled the ham and cheese or used less potatoes.  3 pounds is too much potatoes.

Loved this recipe. Much lighter than traditional scalloped potatoes. I opted to bake this at 350 in the oven. Baked it for an hour in an 13x9 dish using 7-8 medium yellow/gold potatoes and a maple ham steak, diced. Stirred after an hour and cooked it for another 15 minutes to be sure potatoes were done. It didn't seem to have enough sauce so that is why I stirred it. In the end it proved to be a very nice and light, roasted-potatoes consistency, with a light sauce. Great flavor!

MADE GLUTEN FREE IT'S GREAT.  Just use an 18 oz can of gluten free cream of mushroom soup and a little milk, couple Tbsps.  Make sure your ham is GF and you're good to go.  I did find, as others did, that 4 hours in the crockpot didn't cut it.  Transferred to oven for the rest of the cooking.  If I'd started earlier the slow cooker would have been nice.  It was awesome and will do again!

This is definitely a family FAVORITE! They have talked it up so much that I am now making it for my in-laws. I love cooking with garlic so I tend to use both fresh as well as garlic powder and add a bit more cheese after everything is in the crock pot.

Overall satisfied..... I used cream of chicken because I didn't have cream of mushroom.... I added various seasonings that my family likes (Italian, chili powder, etc). Not something too write home about but definitely a great weeknight meal (make at lunch and serve for dinner)

Definitely just ok.  If I were to make it again I would make so many changes that I may as well look for a different recipe.  We found it to be under-seasoned and too soupy.

This was very good for an easy recipe but it would have been better with added spices (maybe minced garlic and paprika?)I started it off on high and my potatoes started to burn at the sides of the crockpot. I did use cooking spray before adding the ingredients but it helped only on the bottom. I used water as stated but later when everything started getting too thick and dry, I added a little milk. Also, I didn't add the ham and cheese at the start. I waited until about an hour before serving to add the ham, then a little later, slices of sharp cheddar cheese (I was in too much of a hurry to grate it). I read so many reviews where the cheese got lost in the mix so though this way would be better. I let it melt a bit, then stirred gently. This cheese was very yummy in it. I think it helped that I used sharp cheese since I didn't even put the 1 cup the recipe called for.

Absolutely delicious!  Only thing I changed was used milk instead of water.  Maybe use a little bit more ham next time.

Easy and delicious.  I didn't have any cream-o-anything soup, so I substituted milk for the cream soup and water.

Too much effort for a crock pot recipe. The ham burns on the bottom too. I would add that the Last hour or so.

Took longer than 4 hours to cook. I didn't see the instructions to layer until it was too late. Next time I'll use my large crock pot instead of my regular size one. I did substitute milk for water, cream of potato for cream of mushroom, and doubled the cheese.

My family gave this one a thumbs up and it was super easy to leave in the slow cooker. I cooked it on low (newer cooker which tends to run hotter than older models) and used Half & Half in place of the water. We were having ham slices so I put them across the top of the potatoes with just enough cooking time left to warm them nicely.

We absolutely love this recipe and it has been my only scalloped potatoes recipe I've used in the last two years. The only changes I made were I use fresh garlic rather than the powder and we love cheese so I add a hunk of Velveeta on top of the cheese listed. Other than that I follow it exactly as written and it turns out great every time!

Great tasting and easy to make! Thought it would take less time but took the whole 4 hours. If you need it done faster you could use your oven at 350 degrees.

I messed up and it still tastes great! I wasn't confident only 1 can of soup would be enough. I added a second can of soup. I also added a full can of milk and a half can of water. This batch is a bit more of a really chunky potato stew, but it's wonderful and wow. I'll have more faith in the recipe next time.

Also, I added a container of fresh sliced mushrooms, from the produce isle, and it really added to the yum.

Easy to follow instructions.  Used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of water. Used 1 more cup cheddar cheese. Baked on low for 7 hours. I bet this would taste better using no ham or with crunchy bacon.

Kid approved!  Thought I made enough for leftovers but this was devoured.  Made a few small changes to the recipe just to meet our family liking, layered with some extra ham and cheese.  So good and easy!

It's in the slowcooker as we speak. I read all the reviews and used many of the suggestions. My BIG tip is to use a apple peeler/corer! Makes quick work with peeling and slicking. I used 8 medium whites. The potato cores were sliced and frozen for future breakfast potato!

Sub List:
two cloves of garlic rather than powder
cream rather than water
1 cup of onion
double the ham (had spare bone in ham leftover in the freezer)
4 shitake mushrooms
added edam cheese to the cheddar (had some in the fridge)

As some others suggested, I added more cheddar cheese, land extra onion, added salt, and lots of pepper and garlic powder, and sprinkled some dried parsley and cheese on the top before i turned on the crockpot. This came out great.  Great recipe if you want a side dish without the fuss. Served with some fried chicken, and salad.  Delicious!!!!

I followed the recipe as written.  My husband and I both thought it was good, but nothing special.  It was a bit bland.  If I try this recipe again, I will definitely change by adding more cheese, spices and maybe a few other veggies.

Always looking for meals for crockpot. I made this (almost) exactly as written and LOVEEEED it. Used milk instead of water & added 1 T butter because I like my scalloped pots with butter in them for flavor. The only problem I had was my crockpot must be very hot on 'high' (it's only a yr old) because I had to turn it to 'low'. It had (really) stuck to the pot only part-way through. Hint: If you want to add flavor to something, add butter &/or cheese (adding cheese can also help 'cover up' any 'errors' or enhance a dish).  TASTED GREAATTT! I've never rated anything on here before but if it's based on a 5-star rating. That's what "I" give it for taste and ease. Just check your crockpot for best setting.

This was delicious. My Hubby loved it. He's the expert on scalloped potatoes and ham, I made it as directed, except I cooked it in crockpot on low for 6 to 7 hours. I couldn't put it together for the four hours, It was great! Awesome flavor.

I wanted to be sure everyone would like this so I halved the recipe (only the potatoes) and did take other reviewers suggestions and used milk instead of the water.  It was delicious!!!! Thanks for sharing, and I did use my crockpot on low for 4-5 hrs.

I had to make a few changes.  I put in 2 cups of hot water with a vegetable buillion cube disolved in it and dry wild mushrooms as I didn't have Condensed mushroom soup.  All of the kids loved this recipe!

Easy & yummy ... we had no leftovers.  I used cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom (just a personal preference), and used milk instead of water.  Next time I will let it cook a little longer, because in our crock pot 4 hours wasn't quite long enough, and some of the potatoes were still a little crunchy.

This recipe was very good, but I had problems (as did others) with it cooking in the crockpot.  I did end up putting it in the oven for 1 hour, after 4 hours in the crockpot.  I would add more cheese next time and maybe some garlic to give it some punch.  Overall, very good and provided several meals and great warmed up in the microwave (with the addition of a little milk).

These were totally awesome!  I did add tons more cheese and used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup mixed each with a can of skim milk though.  And I cooked my ham seperately.  I put them on low and went to work....came home about 9 hours later and some cheese had burnt to the sides of the crockpot but I LOVE that taste.  Next time I will put a timer on for about 7 hours tops!  I didn't have the liquid problem other reviews did either.  The soup turned the potatoes a carmel color, but they tasted phenomenal!  I will definitely be making these REAL soon.

This was very good and simple enough to make.... i adjusted to my family's preference and added garlic and used half and half instead of water for a creamier texture. I did cook it in the over at 350 for about hour and half and it was nice and brown. I will definately make again

This is a really nice recipe that I will definitely make again.  I gave it a 4 because as written, I didn't think it was cheesy enough.  I added a total of 3 cups of cheese.  It took longer to cook than I expected; maybe I sliced the potatoes too thick.  Next time I might make this a day ahead because it heats up very nicely.

This recipe was great.  I used it for a potluck at work and had nothing but compliments.  I did change 1 thing - insted of cream of mushroom soup, I used cream of onion soup and then omitted the onions.

I did not care for this.  I did not like the texture of the ham and it was just a bland taste for me. I doubled the amount of cheese, which helped a little. It was okay, but not something I will be making again.

My family eat the whole dish for dinner!!! I added 2 extra eggs and sauteed onions and x-tra cheese. But I found that I mine stuck to the bottom of the pan even with a spray of pam. I will cook it for ten less minutes next time as well. But over all a great dish.

I doubled the recipe, used 1can cr of mush, 1 cr of celery(both healthy recipe low fat sodium reduced). Used evap milk instead of water. Added 2 cloves garlic. Left out the ham. Realized at the last minute my slow cooker was broken so I dumped it into a 9x13 casserole and baked covered at 250 for 3 hours while our Easter ham cooked. It was ok but out of 20 people I had over 1/2 left. I prefer the 3 cheese garlic potatoes better.

Yummy, yummy! This is a great comfort food recipe. I used cream of celery with milk instead of water and increased the cheese (by a bunch!), using cheddar and mozzarella. My husband is not a fan of cheese in any form, and he loved this dish. I sliced the onion into rings and added blk pepper, a little bit of basil and finely chopped garlic (I never measure seasonings, so I don't know the exact qty). I will definitely be making this again when I have leftover ham.

We loved this recipe!  I've had a hard time finding the perfect scalloped potato recipe and was surprised that this is it.  I doubled the ham and cheese (used swiss), used some dehydrated onion flakes instead of fresh onion and didn't have any cream soups so made my own.  I brought 1 1/2 cups milk, 1 cup water, a chicken bouillon cube, salt, pepper, parsley and the garlic powder to a boil and stirred in 3 tablespoons flour mixed into half a cup of milk.  Let it boil for a couple of minutes and then poured it over the layered ham, potatoes and cheese.  Mine needed 3 hours to cook.  Next time I'll use 2 cups of the "soup" instead of 3.  Thanks for the great idea!

Delicious!! I did double, possibly triple the cheese, but I love cheese. And doubled the ham just like everyone suggested. Great base recipe though. My boyfriend and Best friend said it was the best scallop potatoes and ham they've ever had!! I will definately make it again

This was excellent but I did make changes to suit our tastes.  I added 1 cup of cheddar AND mozzarella cheese.  1 can of cream of mushroom AND celery soup.  1/2 cup of milk AND water.  I used a whole onion and 2 cups of ham.  Cooked on high 4 hours - was delicious.

Sorry but I did not like the flavor of this *at all.*  I didn't have to toss it, hence the 2, but didn't like it either.  It sounded promising since I'm a cheese lover and adding ham seemed like nice idea.  But the flavor was just wasn't there.  And I can't explain this part, since most reviews seem to say 4 hours wasn't enough, but after 3 hours mine was done and sticking to the sides.  Maybe my crock is just hot but haven't had this trouble with other stuff.  I did slice the potatoes thin, like it says.  Maybe that did it.

My family and I found this to be a yummy recipe with a few changes made.  I only used about 1/4 cup milk for the liquid and I added about a cup of cottage cheese as well as 4 slices of american cheese.  I also used 2 cups reduced fat cabot cheddar cheese and reduced fat mushroom soup.  I stirred about once an hour and cooked about 5 hours on high.  The result was creamy, comforting and tasty!

I increased the amount of ham and cheese and used milk instead of water. Came out fantastic! Will definitely be a staple during winter.

I made this after my husband requested "ham and cheesy potatoes." I ended up taking the advice of other reviews and used milk instead of water, added extra cheese (didn't really measure it) and used condensed cheese soup instead of mushroom (we don't like mushroom soup). It turned out pretty well - he ate it all up!

I used Sharp Cheddar Cheese and about 8 slices of American because the recipe called for too little cheese. I also added two cloves of fresh garlic and no salt. It was salty enough without the added salt. 

The sauce was runny so I had to add flour to it and instead of 4 hours I put it on 6. 4 hours was not long enough.

I was so looking forward to this recipe after all the great reviews, but I'm sorry to report that it was terrible.  The sauce was sort of chunky/congeled and not thick or creamy.  It was really terrible and I'll never make it again.

This was pretty good. I took the advice of others and microwaved the potatoes for about 5 min, but they STILL weren't cooked through after following the specified time (it took about an extra 2 hours).  Other than that, the dish was pretty good, nice and cheesy, but it could have had a little more flavoring to it.

delicious & creamy texture. Try slicing the potatoes with a veggie peeler for a super-thin scallop that cooks thoroughly but grabs onto the cheese sauce.

These were pretty good. I didn't use any soup, just a little whole milk and a little cream cheese. Could use a lot more ham. I recommend a french raclette cheese (melts like velvetta but it's a delicious real French cheese) and gruyere. Delicious taste but I might bake next time rather than slow cook. The potatoes got pretty mushy, however still delicious.

This was not what I expected at all. Next time I will use milk instead of the water. It was so gross with the water that the cheese never even melted (it just congealed on top of the potatoes). My husband did say that this was better the next day.

I used 7 or 8 potatoes, more like 2 cups of cheese (mozzarella and cheddar), maybe 1½ cups of ham (diced up into small pieces), cream of celery soup, and about ½ can of water and ½ can of milk. I didn't add any salt. I cooked it on low for about 5 hours and then high for 2 hours, and it wasn't quite cooked as much as I'd like it to be, but it was cooked enough to eat without complaints. :) I added a little slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken it a touch, but it wasn't watery or anything. Next time, I'll cook on high for 5 hours total. It was awesome! Thanks, Raquel, for a marvelous recipe... I'll even try it sometime without the ham!

After reading other reviews, I made some adjustments and found the recipe to be good.  Could use some spicing up though.  I used 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar, 2/3c water and a can of creamed corn (as I had run out of cr. of mush.)  I cooked it on high for 6-7 hours, the potatoes were perfect, not mushy but DONE.  Thanks, will make again!

I like how easy this was. I used canned sliced potatoes. 
Our teens liked it okay, but the overall feeling was that it was just a little boring.

I made this for a covered dish lunch at work today, and it turned out really good.  I gave it 4 stars b/c I think it needs some more cheese.  Next time (there WILL be a next time), I think I'll add a can of cheddar cheese soup or at least another cup of shredded cheddar.  :)

This is awesome! I had a crazy day and wasn't sure when dinner would ever get done and tried this recipe! I only added extra cheese over the top of it at the end of cooking time and my family went nuts over it! I did too! A major keeper! I also made BBQ chicken with the Southern Grilled Barbeque Ribs sauce and steamed carrots. Wonderful and easy as well as delicious! You gotta try the BBQ sauce as well with this side dish!! Perfect! Thank you!

this was awesome... I skipped the garlic powder and chopped up two cloves instead, and also skipped the salt b/c the ham was salty enough. I also added more cheese because I love cheesy scalloped potatos. It did take  longer than 4 hrs, it was more like 5, or 5 1/2 hrs. I used red potatos and left the skins on to save time.

This dish was absolutely delicious and so easy to make.  I modified slightly by using 2cups of Ham, adding Cheddar Cheese Soup, and not putting in salt.  I sliced the potatoes thin enough so that the cooking time was perfect.  Leftovers were even delicious the next day!

I tried this last night for dinner, and it was great.  Two out of 3 kids liked it, and asked for more, so that's all I need.  I did add an extra can of soup (cheddar) with milk, because it didn't seem creamy enough with just the cream of celery.  Excellent!

No salt and doubled recipe using 1 can crm/mushroom and 1 can crm/cheddar soups....My family of 6 really liked it and I love throwing it together in the a.m. and having a nice filling supper waiting when we get home.  I too cooked it on low for 7 hours....

My family really enjoyed this dish, and since it was so easy to put together, I gave it 5 stars.  I did read the reviews beforehand, so I also eliminated the salt and used lots of ham.  (After all, I'm trying to get rid of leftover ham, that's the purpose here!).  I don't like the flavor of mushroom soup either so I used cream of celery for it's blandness.  Didn't measure the cheese either, but it was quite generous.  Thanks for such an easy recipe, it's a keeper!

I gave this 4 stars.  My husband gave it 5 and went back for seconds!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used 2 cups of ham & shredded cheese.  I also cooked mine on low for about 7 hrs.  I will definitely be making this one again!

This recipe is not only delicious, but very simple and easy to make. The slow cooker does all the work, while you get to sit back and enjoy the final, delicious results!

I was expecting a lot more from all the great reviews, but my husband and I both thought this dish was just average.  We both agreed that I won't make it again.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either.

Oh My Goodness!!! This was fantastic.  I added more ham and left out the salt.  Also, I didn't cook it in the slow cooker.  I used a 9 x 13 glass pan and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.

I followed the directions to the letter, but this dish did not turn out the way I had hoped at all. It was watery and did not taste like classic scallopped potatoes.

Good, easy recipe.  But I didn't take a first bite and say "WOW!"  I'm sure I'll make it again some day but it just didn't make out "favorites" list.  By the way, I, too, omitted the salt.

I liked this recipe but I wasn't blown away or anything.  My son, who is very picky, just loved it!  I put a lot more ham in, maybe even doubled it and I cooked it on low for about 7-8 hours.  It's an easy dinner to throw in the crockpot and have ready at the end of the day!

Very tasty and easy to make.  Felt like it was missing something.  I will experiment with different seasonings next time I make it.  We decided we like these better than boxed potatoes. :)

I used a garlic seasoning,  just not the garlic powder just seemed to add a little more to it, regardless what a great easy dinner, can start it late in the morning/early afternoon and its ready for dinner.

I usually use my own recipe so I decided to use this one instead, for a change.  Unfortunately, I had to modify it a bit.  I used one whole onion by mistake but it didn't affect anything.  I used a slow cooker liner to prevent having to clean the crockpot.  That's a must!

Then I added an 8 oz. bag of cubed ham, used a 26 oz. can of mushroom soup, diluted it with a couple dashes of milk so it wouldn't come out soupy and used 2 cups of cheddar cheese.  It was done in 4 hours as promised but it was still a bit soupy so I left the lid off for about 30 minutes & it firmed up nice.

I couldn't taste the cheese, so next time I will omit it and it was a bit salty so I will omit that also.  This is a very good recipe & I'll use it again.

This tasted really good.  My only problem was that i did not care for the ham.  It was so easy.  I didn't change a thing, but in the future, i will make this without the ham.  I am glad that i had a ham to serve with it because it would not have been successful as an all-in-one casserole type meal.  Also, I was very pleased that the canned soup took on a taste that was not canned soup tasting.

I make pretty much this exact recipe except I do not add any water (or milk)...I do not dilute the cream of mushroom soup. I layer all other ingredients in the slow cooker, then spread the cream of mushroom soup over the top. That's it. Comes out perfect every time.

Seemed to take forever to cook in the crockpot so I finished it in the microwave. Needs additional cheese. It stayed very thin for a while but did thicken up at the end. I think I’d prefer to oven cook the next time.

while we liked the basic taste of the dish, it was soooo salty . I'll try it again but won't salt the potatoes at all to see if that helps. I've had potatoes without ham that were made this way and they were yummy. this was close but no cigar.

This pleased everyone in my family! It is a change from cheesy potatoes. I used 2 layers, doubled the ham. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.

We didn't like this one at all.  
  The potatoes didn't get done in the 4 hours so I put it in the oven until they were done.  
The consistency was terrible.  
  Sorry for the one star, but we just didn't like it.

So many ratings said it was too soupy ...so I nuked my potatoes in a steamer till partly cooked and got a good result in 3 hrs on high.  Slice your onions thin or finely chop them. I liked my use of Cream of Celery, [what I had in pantry].

This was a quick and easy version of scalloped potatoes.  Used cream of chicken soup, because that's what I had.  And since I didn't have any ham, I diced up some double smoke kielbassa.  I followed other's advice and layered the ingredients, and used milk instead of water. Everyone liked it.

I guess because I scaled this down for 2 people that I didn't quite get the right ratio as it was more soupy than expected.  However, my husband and I loved the flavor so now I have another soup recipe. :) I will use the left over ham from Christmas to make another slow cooker of this delicious "soup".

Like the other reviewers I layered the ingredients and doubled the ham and cheese.  I used half a sick of melted butter and a mixture of half and half and milk instead of water, and used about a cup instead of only a half cup.  Great meal for cold winter nights!

This was a great recipe. I liked it a lot. I followed the recipe as it was. I think next time I would add more ham but the flavor was great and the potatoes were not mushy. My husband liked it too. :-)

We loved it! I have a question. I am short on oven space at Christmas, so the slow cooker is ideal. However I get rattled with the side dishes. Is these any way to make ahead and reheat? Would welcome any suggestions.

1st attempt making this dish, went the oven route, 60 mins at 350 degrees. It was good but found it a little blah and maybe could be cooked longer. Any suggestions folks?? LJ

ive noticed some people had problems with this recipe.  Couple of tips... 1, know your slow cooker. Ive yet to see two different  slow cookers cook the same meal in the same amount of time.
2.  I don't much cook with salt .. you can always add salt at the table.  Ham comes a few ways, fresh, salt cured or smoked.  Go for the lower salt option, i prefer smoke cured.  and remember, you can always soak your ham the night before in your fridge in cold water to draw salt out. I don't believe Fresh would work for this recipe 3. Using Soup. canned soup can be salty and the lo salt versions, imho, are nasty. if salt doesn't bother you, then use the canned, but use at least a premium brand, bargain canned soup.. well, there's a reason its a bargain. I prefer the broccoli cheddar soup for this. 4. if you don't  want Soup -try the alternative, make a roux, with real butter, good flour and  real cream or half and half, and do not cook on high.  always cook on low when using real cream or half and half, too high a temp causes it to separate and/or sour. 5. layer your potatoes, onions etc.  6. you can never have too much cheese in scalloped potatoes. Don't be afraid to add more.
Lastly, every single recipe that i've ever used from this site, I've altered to my family's taste. Think about what you and your family like and adjust accordingly :) This is a great easy recipe, and just like all recipes, think it through :)

I've made this for the past two Thanksgivings and it was a hit. I did make a few changes. I doubled the cheese and didn't bother peeling the potatoes. I added a lot more garlic and black pepper. I used a little extra water in the soup because it was a little too thick and didn't mix well with all the potatoes. I added just a touch of salt and left out the ham because we were going to have plenty of protein with the turkey and because we felt it would add too much salt to the dish. The leftovers are usually among the first to disappear after Thanksgiving. I will continue to make this every Thanksgiving going forward, and maybe a few times in between.

I made this tonight. I didn't have enough time, so I popped it in the oven. I used cream of celery soup, fresh garlic and about 3 oz of velveeta cheese I had leftover in the fridge, along with the cheddar. My husband said it was "pretty tasty." I think I won't add as much milk next time.

I made this last night.  Instead of 1/2 cup of water and 1 cup of Ham, I did 1/2 cup of milk and 2 cups of Ham.  It was really tasty, I'll be making this one again for sure.

i had high hopes for this dish. It seemed to have everything we might like and tasted yummy after about two hours. At least the ham and sauce did....

After 6 hours on HIGH, I decided i was just gonna have to see how long it would take for the potatoes to get tender...."

17 hours later, on high no less, and the potatoes are still translucent brick slices.   

Needless to say, I shan't be making this in the slow cooker again, though I MAY try it in my cast iron dutch oven in the oven.

I read other reviews and doubled ham and cheese, and used milk instead of water. Was very delicious, but runny like a soup. Still tasted great. Will try again.

this was awesome.. took another viewer suggestion  and made in the oven  due to time crunch.. that's why I rated it 4.. use my pampered chef slicer.. my kids 9&5, gobbled this up and asked for seconds, my 5 yr old that turns her head away from everything, loved it the most, which is a bonus. definitely keeping this one in family recipe book.. maybe nxt time  in crockpot!!

I omitted the ham and served this as a side dish. I did add extra cheese...about 2 cups extra actually. I didn't  layer the ingredients, just put the sliced potatoes into the pot, mixed everything else in a bowl and poured over, then gave the whole thing a quick stir. Cooked on low for 7 hours, then removed the lid and cooked on high for another 30 minutes to allow it to thicken a bit. Delicious cheesy potato dish, thank you for posting :)

You can also cook this on Low for about 7.5 - 8 hours, if you're going to be gone/at work. I also used 1 can of Cream of Cheddar with either 1 can of Cream of Chicken OR Mushroom soup.  If you don't want "fresh/raw" Onion, You can always use Onion Powder for the flavor.  I've also seen it with sliced ham about 1/4 - 1/2" thick, as this is a lot easier than "cubing" the ham. the flavor is still there.

This was excellent and so very easy.  I'm wondering if temperatures vary from brands-to-brands of slow cookers.  I just followed the recipe and found it really DID take 4 hours on high to fully cook.

I wasn't sure what to do with my ham, but I knew I wanted to use my slow cooker. I used a bit more ham, and we loved it. I've recommended this to my co-workers, if they're looking for a great meal that's quick and easy to prepare. Thank you!

This is a great recipe! I have made it so many times and my kids/grandkids love it.  It's a perfect dish to take to a potluck supper at church.  I've used ham steaks, pork chops and chicken just to change it up - it's great with all three.  If you don't try it you are missing out.

We loved it with a few changes

Used cream instead of water, doubled the ham and cheese,
next time I will add a little flour or corn starch to thicken the water baked 
out of the potatoes

My dad is from Idaho and he always says he's never met a potato he didn't like but he didn't like these and asked me not to make them again. I think for us the Cream of Mushroom soup clashed with the cheese. I did add extra cheese (more than double) to try and save them but it didn't help. They did cook through with 2 hours on high and 3 on low.

An absolutely delicious recipe.  I made it for my Easter 2014 dinner (just the cats and I so I didn't want to cook up a whole, big ham).  I have to admit that I added 1 1/2 table spoons of Old Bay seasoning to the slow cooker but then I add Old Bay to just about everything.

Followed the recipe for the most part, but added about two cups more cheese; one cheddar, one mozz, one pepper jack. Added some fresh mushrooms and replaced water for milk. Great weeknight dish!

If you like typical homestyle scalloped potatoes and ham you will not like this!  No one in my household thought it was good.

I made this recipe according to the directions.  To make this more of a main course entrée, I would add more ham.  The flavoring also needs some perk.  Some cayenne pepper may do the trick.

Good flavor but the potatoes didn't cook! I used a mandolin to slice my potatoes very thinly and cooked on high for 4 hours and they were still crunchy. I put it on for about 1 1/2 hour longer and the potatoes were cooked through but the cheese had turned dark and crunchy on the sides. The flavor was very good. I probably added more onion since I used a full one sliced very thinly and added a little more salt after tasting it halfway through. I will probably make it again sometime.

Delicious!!  I added extra ham to make it more substantial for a main dish, also added a little extra milk in the slow cooker.

Yummy. Doubled the ham and cheese (at least) and no salt. It seemed dry so I added more milk, too much because it was soupy - finished it in the oven, lid off. So, easy on the extra milk and if you put it in the oven, stir frequently to keep it from sticking to the sides/bottom.

Actually 4.5...The only thing I'll change next time will be to add less (or no!) salt. Delicious, and the house smelled so good when I woke up...Thanks 'Mama'!

I made these in the oven (350 degrees for one hour) and decreased the amount of ham (used 1/2 cup). I filled the cream of mushroom can with milk in place of water. This was great and really easy to throw together.

These had an almost sour or bitter taste.  I made them twice because the first time I thought maybe i did something wrong so the second time i tried again today and they are turning out the same way.  I don't know what i'm doing wrong!

I made this dish exactly as called for, except that I added some minced garlic (personal preference).  I liked being able to use the slow cooker as I work long days & time to cook is limited.  We felt the flavor was a little on the bland side, even with the garlic, and my husband thought it was a better side dish than a main dish.  He was still hungry afterwards and made a sandwich.  I would suggest adding more meat & some spices to kick it up a notch.

This was easy to make and tasted pretty good. I am only giving it 3 stars because it would have been pretty bland had I not added a few more spices to it.

These were very good.  I have a 3 year old and 2 year old and they loved them.  Definitely should be used as a side dish- too rich for a main entree.  I added more cheese and used milk instead of water.  I also took other's recommendations and heated the potatoes and onions for 10 minutes in microwave before putting in crockpot.  Definitely a keeper!

It was good for a change, but the family agrees that that we would not want it on the rotation menu.

I have never made scalloped potatoes before.  They turned out fine, but it was kind of blah to us.  I am looking for a different kind of flavor..

This recipe was super simple to make and rather tasty. It sure smelled good while cooking it. It wasn't as good as my mom's homemade scalloped potatoes and ham, but it is a recipe I will make again.

Deciding at the last minute that I wanted to make this, I made it in the oven instead of the slow cooker.  For my size family, I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan.  I had Mexican cheese on hand instead of cheddar.  The only other change I made was I was very concerned about the amount of liquid.  We like creamy scalloped potatoes over the delicately sauced potatoes.  I ended up making 2 1/2 times the amount of sauce and it turned out very nice.  My family said to definitely make this again.

I substituted cream of mushroom with roasted garlic and was still a little bland.  I will probably make it again and try adding sour cream at the end.

This was so gross. Cheddar cheese and mushroom soup does not make the flavor of scalloped potatoes. It smelled good, but was just a soupy, greasy pot of YUCK. Sorry.

For 2 of us, I could have made 2/3 of this recipe and had plenty! It was good comfort food but I think I will make a few changes for next time. I think it would be good to add a bit more cheese and to include broccoli in the recipe (as opposed to having it as a side which is what I did). It also needed some spices and I would not add any salt as it was salty enough with the cream of mushroom soup in there.

These were pretty good.  I had to thicken the sauce before serving. I did add more cheese than the recipe called for and some additional seasonings to jazz them up a little.

VERY GOOD!
we added peas to this.
we used 1/3 american, 1/3 sharp white cheddar & 1/3 smoked gouda cheese.
the gouda really made this!

so easy!  we love to put something in the crock pot on a sunday afternoon & then relax until our dinner is ready.

this was ok...these were my changes...Doubled the Cheese using Colby Jack, onion powder about 1t.,2 cups of ham, cream of chicken soup, milk  instead of the water and omitted salt.  My version cooked about 6 hours on high...it had a good flavor not one of my favorites on this web sites tho, but would probably make it again.

Great Recipe..My Family Loved it!
I added more cheese (sharp cheddar) ~ We love cheese, I used Cream of Chicken and Cream of Mushroom, substituted milk for the water, a dish and a dash of a few of my own favorite spices. Layered it and turned out great! For left overs I layed it in a pyrex dish and baked it in the oven so that the top was golden and crisp. This is definitely a recipe that you can switch up and have fun with. Thanks for sharing

I exchanged milk for the water and added a handful of extra cheese.  I also used a crockpot bag to skip having to clean up a mess. My results were a little soupy BUT everyone loved it.  Even my picky son asked for it again.

I have made this recipe several times, and every time my potatoes are underdone, AND burnt to the side of the Crockpot. I have tried several of the suggested alterations, replacing water with milk, doubling cheese and ham. Every time I have made them the liquid evaporates before the end of the cooking time and I have to add more milk, or water, or soup mix (even tried sour cream once!).

I made this the other night because I didn't want the oven on (and it I got some free time), and this was great!!  My husband and son loved it, and leftovers were better yet!  I did add some garlic powder to the potatoes and onions, and added more milk with the soup, and of course added more cheese, and it was perfect.  Will be making this again!!

I made it as-is and it tasted good..my 2 yr. old liked it but my husband did not.  I used my pampered chef slicer on the thinnest setting to slice the potatoes and unfortunately since I did it the not before, the potatoes were brown by morning so I wouldn't recommend putting the dish together in advance.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I think it needed more flavor.  I followed some other reviewers' advice and added more ham and cheese, and used milk instead of water.  I would give this 2 stars, but my boyfriend liked it.  Thanks anyway.

Quick, easy, and tasty.  With the salt content of the soup and the ham it's not necessary to add any more salt.  Using a mandolin makes preparation even faster.

This was pretty darn good....I made it in the oven though, and also added cheese soup like everyone else.  Plus I used garlic cream of mushroom soup.

I agree with some of the others that it is good, just not as a main dish.  I actually thought that is was much better as leftovers.

This was pretty good...I think it needed a lot more salt.  I will prob do what others have suggested and use cheddar cheese soup next time for better flavor.  My house smelled wonderful while it was cooking!

This turned out very good.  I used 2 cups of ham and cheddar cheese soup (instead of cream of mushroom).  Although I tried to slice the potatoes thin, I had to cook it for an extra 1 hr on high.

 i put no extra salt and used cream of chicken
 i also layered the cheese(i do american/cheddar) and ham with the potatoes     a big hit in my home!!

I read the reviews before making this dish and doubled the ham, omitted the salt.  Cooked for 4 hours on high - stirred it twice. The flavor was great, but as a main dish it really needs even more ham than doubling(that's why I only gave 4 stars).  

Leftovers would be great with eggs for breakfast. I will make this again.

The only thing good about this recipe was the taste, and it was just 'fair'. I followed this recipe to the letter. After 4 hours on high the potatoes were still hard as rocks, I had to double the ham, it was dryer than the Sahara (it needed LIQUID of some kind)...I'm just glad I hadn't invited guests for dinner that night....after 5 hours we gave up and pitched it into the trash (Cooking ham that long in a crock pot is scary)

I did not find this dish very exciting.  The ratio of ham to potatoes is too low -needs a lot more ham.  Would prefer to have baked scalloped potatoes and ham as separate items the old fashioned way -baked!

Not as good as "funeral potatoes" but still full of flavor and easy to make.  Note...you may need to increase cheese by 1/3 cup.

Excellent!  I've been looking for a good scalloped potatoes and ham recipe and now I've finally found it!  I wasn't' sure at first because it really doesn't call for a lot of cheese and while it was cooking I just didn't see how it was going to come together, but when it did...wow!  Thank you!

The potato was a beautiful, tender texture but thats the only thing we liked about this. The flavour of the mushroom soup just didn't appeal to us and it was way too garlicky - sorry.

I used Cream of Celery instead of mushroom and cooked in the oven.  Woild not make again this way, but I might try it in the crock with Cheddar cheese soup for softer potatos and a more cheesy taste.

As a side dish this would be okay, but as a main dish it was just too much potatoes for me.  My 3 year old picked out the ham and didn't touch anything else.
