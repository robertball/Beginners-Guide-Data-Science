I love brining but I think it's important to mention when brining in a plastic bag or container, make sure that the plastic is FOOD GRADE!  You should NEVER, NEVER, EVER brine in a garbage bag or ordinary household bucket.  PCB's are not good for you.

A great brine.  I doubled the recipe for a 22 lb. turkey and used 1 gal. apple juice and 1 gal. vegetable broth instead of all broth.  I also used ground spices instead of dried.  I put the turkey in a clean plastic trash bag, then placed it in a large cooler. Next, I poured the brine in the bag and tied it closed.  I placed a gallon of frozen water in the cooler next to the bag to keep the whole thing cool while it marinated overnight.  Watch out for the cooking time on this one as a brined bird cooks much faster - especially if you're using a roasting bag (which I did).  My 22 lber cooked in only 2 1/2 hours!!

Cannot even describe how amazing this was.  My mom's turkeys have always been just okay, and so I decided to take charge for Easter dinner and make this.  It was my first turkey and no one could believe how incredibly juicy, tender, and moist it was.  I followed the recipe for the brine exactly, including just letting the bucket sit in a cool place overnight.  To cook it, I put an onion, carrot and celery stalk into the cavity.  It started breast side down in a 325 degree oven for 2 hours.  Then I turned it over and it took another 45 minutes or so to be done.  For the last 15 minutes I turned the oven up to 400 to finish browning and basted it with a little butter.  Did not cover it with foil, and otherwise didn't bother basting it.  The meat was literally falling off the bones it was so tender and the flavor went all through the meat.  It was seriously about as foolproof as you could get.  The only change I'll make next time is to either reduce the sea salt or substitute water for some of the vegetable broth.  It was just a touch on the salty side, I think because broth is often high in salt to begin with.  Don't be afraid to try this recipe, it really was that easy.  Cannot recommend it enough.. and ditto the other reviewers' comments on the drippings -- they make amazing gravy.

Perfect Brine both times I used this recipe!  The first time I used this recipe was two days before Thanksgiving 2010 and it turned out perfect,  The second time was one week later (turkeys were still on sale) and I used all fresh ingredients (tripled), plus two sliced garlic cloves, a sliced onion, celery with the green leaves/tops and peppercorns.  As my family likes a very slight citrus taste to our "bird", I added a quartered orange to the cavity of the bird during the brine.  Subbed 1/2 of the vegetable broth for apple juice and cut back the salt to 3/4 cup as the vegetable broth already had salt in it.....  Didn't see this tip amongst the many reviews, so I'm going to list it.  The vegetable/produce drawer makes a perfect spot to brine the turkey for a consistently cool temperture.  This is a great recipe ~ try it, I guarantee you won't be disappointed with the original recipe or my modifications.  Enjoy!

After using this recipe for our recent Thanksgiving get-together of three  families, I have been proclaimed the official turkey roaster.  12 out of 12 said it was the best turkey they ever tasted.  (My son said it was the best turkey he had in the past 5 years.  When I asked him whose turkey he had 5 years ago that was better he said that was merely as far back as his memory went!)  The most difficult part of this recipe was finding a bucket large enough to accommodate the turkey.  Then the bucket wouldn't fit into the fridge.  I didn't feel comfortable leaving it out all night, so I found a large cooler, placed the bucket in there and surrounded it with freezer packs.  It worked very well - it was still very cold the next morning.  After checking out several "brine" recipes, I didn't read of anyone actually stuffing the turkey so I wasn't certain whether the stuffing would end up too salty. I stuffed it anyway, but rinsed the turkey with cold water first.  It was excellent!  Try this once and you'll never go back to your regular recipe!

I've used this brine before and it was wonderful!  I'm using it again this year.  For the person who claimed it ruined her 18lb turkey: it must have been user error because brining is a chemical process.  Once the process has finished the salt is left in the brine solution not the bird.  Brining makes cooked meat moister by hydrating the cells of its muscle tissue before cooking, via the process of osmosis, and by allowing the cells to hold on to the water while they are cooked, via the process of denaturation. The brine surrounding the cells has a higher concentration of salt than the fluid within the cells, but the cell fluid has a higher concentration of other solutes. This leads salt ions to enter the cell via diffusion. The increased salinity of the cell fluid causes the cell to absorb water from the brine via osmosis. The salt introduced into the cell also denatures its proteins. The proteins coagulate, forming a matrix which traps water molecules and holds them during cooking. This prevents the meat from drying out, or dehydrating.

I brined my 24 lb turkey last year and it cooked uncovered in three hours. it was so tender and delicious that there were no leftovers.i make my own vegetable broth by cooking carrots,celery onions,parsley,tomatoes. wash and cut up vegeatables but do not peel. cook in enough water to cover for an hour. add salt, peppercorns and i use two cups of brown sugar or maple syrup. cool and strain. half of my kitchen sink is very deep and i put my turkey in the sink, cover with a 20lb bag of ice and pour cooled broth over. i marinate for two days, replenishing ice as needed. then rinse and dry. stuff with lemons and onions

* 5 STAR RECIPE!! * I use this brine for chicken, and it's outstanding! (I omit the Savory seasoning since I never can remember to buy it.)  I adjust the recipe to 4 servings for a 5lb. chicken, then place it into the largest rubbermaid container I own. Add seasonings mixed with two cans of vegetable broth. Fill to top of container with cold water making sure chicken is thoroughly soaking in brine. Cover, and let marinate for 24 hours in fridge.  Bake at 325 degrees for about 2-1/2 hours... FANTASTIC!! My very picky 7 year old loves this recipe!! As do the rest of us  :)

Made this for Christmas and my mother-in-law stated she wouldn't have deep fried turkey again.  I've cooked turkeys for 20 years and will never cook it any other way.  I baked it uncovered at 500 degrees until brown and then covered and baked at 350 degrees.  This turkey was the most beautiful brown glazed turkey you would ever see!  My husband actually took a picture of it!  I am making it again this weekend!  Thanks!

This was my first time brining a turkey, I will NEVER do it any other way from now on!  I used the recipe as called for except I was a little short on the Veg. broth so I topped it off with apple juice as suggested by previous posters.  I only had 14hrs for it to soak, and I wayyyyyy overcooked because I had accidently turned off the alarm on my temperature gauge (oops) but the turkey was still moist and very very tender.  It had such a nice flavor and the gravy from the drippings was good although a tad salty. I omitted the salt I normally put in my potatoes and it balanced. ^__^ Thanks for the recipe!!!!

My comment isnt on this recipe in particular, just a tip on brining in general.  Last year I brined for both Thanksgiving and Christmas, it they were the best birds Ive ever had.  My tip is this.....place bird in an oven roasting bag with brine ingredients, then place in a cooler with ice.  Slosh the bag around several times during the marinating process. This clears up MUCH needed refrigerator space during the crunch time before cooking!

I have been brining my thanksgiving turkeys for about 8 years now. Even with experimenting with different ingredients every year, I have never had a bad brine recipe! No matter what small changes you make with spices, or syrups or juices, you will always come out with a better turkey than if it was just cooked the old fashioned way. Hefty makes a one zip jumbo 2.5 gallon size bag that usually accomodates my turkeys, and I find the brine surrounds the bird better than if in a regular pot or container. Rotating the bird in the oven while cooking is important also, start with the breast down because the dark meat (underneath) needs to cook for a longer period than the top white meat (breast) flip over and finish roasting with the breast side up. Otherwise your top white meat may be drier as the dark meat takes an extra few minutes to reach the appropriate temp. Happy Thanksgiving!

We read all the reviews and took a little info from each review.  The turkey was a success!  We used 1/2 broth and 1/2 apple juice as suggested, but we added some red grape juice and broccoli broth from some steamed broccoli earlier in the day.   We added a cinnamon stick and some fresh rosemary.  **IMPORTANT NOTE:  We studied about the different types of salt to use(there were a lot of comments about the turkey being too salty).  If you substitute the sea salt for kosher - it is twice as strong and its as if you are doubling your salt content.  BE SURE to use sea salt and if you are using   KOSHER salt - cut the the amount in half. **
We used one full cup  of sea salt for a 22 lb. turkey and was perfect.  The gravy was also out of this world!

I had a 23lb turkey to begin with. I used 3 regular size cans of vegetable broth, 1 jug of apple juice, 1 cup of sea salt, 2 gallons of water, 1tbs paprika, 1tbs rosemary, and 1tbs thyme. After brining turkey overnight in a cooler I removed it, pat it dry with paper towels and made a mixture w/ 1/2 cup of butter garlic & onion powders. I put the butter between the skin and breast meat and all over the turkey. I then sprinkled the turkey with garlic powder, onion powder and paprika. Roasted the turkey upside down for 3 hours and it was golden brown. Super moist, full of flavor, and worth all the trouble. My family thought this was the best turkey in the world! My mother was bragging about it to her friends. Thanks for this wonderful recipe! It will be a continued tradition for my family!

I've brined many turkeys using various solutions, but never made gravy with the drippings as I do with a conventional roast turkey. The turkey tasted pretty good and was moist, but I thought the gravy tasted weird. Same with the stuffing. I was really looking forward to this based on the great reviews, but thought it was just OK.

Makes for an absolutely fabulous, juicy turkey.  I've been brining my Thanksgiving turkey for a few years now and will never make another turkey w/o brining.  I usually make a 14-16 pound bird.  I use fresh herbs in the brine (one sprig each of rosemary, thyme and sage, plus one cinnamon stick.  I remove these after brine has boiled).  When I'm ready to brine the turkey, I place the brine in one of those XL Ziploc bags (the huge ones used for storage, 10 gallon I believe), put the turkey in the bag in the brine, seal the bag, place the bag in a cooler in the garage and leave overnight.  I always start brining with the breast down, then flip it half way through.  There really isn't much effort involved and it makes a world of difference.  The leftovers are just as amazing, too!  Oh, and just a note, I've also used 1/2 gallon veggie broth and 1/2 gallon apple juice (veggie broth can be expensive) and it tastes just as amazing!!  I don't know why the previous reviewer had problems, perhaps she brined too long...the bird does not taste salty at all when brined properly.  You'll want to leave the bird in the brine anywhere from 12-24 hours or a good rule of thumb is 1 hour per pound.

I am a seasoned cook and wanted to try something different.  All my turkeys will be brined from now on!  This was wonderful!  Flavorful and did bake faster!  Used 1/2 Chicken Broth and 1/2 Apple juice and lowered the sale to 3/4 cup and the bird was not salty at all, very moist and flavorful!  Thank you for sharing!

I actually haven't used the brine yet, I am trying it in a few days on my Thanksgiving turkey but I did want to give others a tip if they are contemplating trying this. Instead of buying pre=made veggie broth try buying the concentrated 4 pack made by Knorr it's called homestyle stock. It yields exactly 16 cups (one gallon) of broth and it only costs about $3.50 for a four pack. Can't wait to try this brine!

The one and ONLY thing this recipe fails on is saying to use dry herbs... fresh herbs make ALL the difference in ANY recipe and this one is no exception...
I'll tell you what I have tried and I dare you to try it again with my alterations: Substitute 1/2 of the veg. broth with apple juice or apple cider, add a cup or so of white wine, add a couple juniper berries and allspice berries to give is (what Tyler Florence says) a holidy flavor (I got the berry idea from his brine recipe) and don't forget to use fresh herbs.  I stuff the bird with a sprig of rosemary, a sprig of thyme, lemons and onions and a couple orange slices and OMG! You won't be disapointed with my adjustments.

Great recipe! First time I ever brined a turkey! I used kosher salt instead of sea salt.  I also added 2 tbsp whole peppercorns, 5 bay leaves and I used fresh spices, sprigs of rosemary, sage and thyme.  I used 2 gallons of chicken vegetable broth, using the boxed broth from Campbells. When I cooked the turkey I did add a lemon, whole onion cut in half, 2 carrots, 2 ribs of celery and poultry seasoning to the cavity.  I also added an olive oil mixture combined with fresh herbs between the skin and meat.  This brining along with the olive/herb mixture made the turkey so moist it was unbelievable!  My guest at Thanksgiving said "I've cooked turkey's for 20 years and never had such a moist bird"...and it looked perfect to boot!

Regarding Step #2:  

Please be sure to use a Bucket and not a pot or other container.  The Bird must be Upright in order for the Brine to fill up around the bird and in the Cavity.    Good luck with the recipe!

The very best roasted turkey I ever made. It also makes the best gravy and lots of it. I highly recommend it. You won't be dissapointed it's worth trying.Instead of a cup of sea salt try useing 1/4 cup of Morton Tender Quick Cure its the best.Not so salty and keeps the meat moist.

This was delicious!  I was so worried because when I found this recipe, I had already purchased a honeysuckle turkey and it already had a salt solution (8%) injected in it.  After reading all over that I should not brine a turkey that already had this salt, i wasn't sure if I should brine.  This was my 1st time brining and I followed the recipe exactly but I could not find any savory seasoning.  I had a 14 lb turkey and I brined it for around 17-18 hours.  I read many reviews from this recipe and others and I think it's important to rinse the bird off REALLY well after brining it!  This should help the bird not taste as salty.  I rinsed it for about 10 minutes in cold water, inside the bird and out, then patted dry.  I didn't use any seasoning other than rubbing it with a little olive oil and some fresh ground pepper. If you use butter instead of Olive oil make sure you are not used a salted butter!! You can buy unsalted sticks! It cooked in 3 hours. It was SO moist and delicious. My dad was skeptical and he has cooked many years and has even brined himself. But when I told him I bought a honeysuckle he didn't think it would be good. It was SO GOOD!  Don't let the reviews fool you, YOU CAN BRINE even if the bird was injected. I would cut the salt down to 3/4 cup or half a cup and don't forget to rinse the bird after you brine! You could even sit the bird in cold water for 15 minutes before patting dry to cook. I will always be brining from now on. Thanks for great recipe!

This is my secret recipe. SO delicious and makes every difference when making a turkey. I sit smugly when my mother-in-law sets out her Christmas turkey...and it is no where NEAR as good as my Thanksgiving turkey! Thank you for giving me the one-up! :D

Tried this out on a chicke first so I'd know what I'd be getting for Thanksgiving and it's the best brine I've ever had.  As for methodology for brining, there is nothing better than one of those big ol' insulated drink coolers you can pick up at Walmart or Home Depot.  It is food grade, unlike plastic bags and buckets.  Can fit just about any size turkey in there.  Easy to clean.  Just use less water and throw in some ice cubes and stick outside in the cold with the top on.    It doesn't have to be as cold as in the fridge.  Bacteria and salt don't get along at all.  Just think of meats cured in salt during colonial days.  They didn't have refrigeration back then and it worked out just fine.  It will work for your turkey overnight outside in the cold too, unless you live down south.

I used this brine for the first time last year, and I am using it again this year.  Everyone raved about how great the turkey was!  I had a 26 pound turkey last year, and I increased everything by half (a gallon and a half veggie broth) and used regular kosher salt.  I also added a gallon of apple juice to the brine for a little sweetness.  My biggest challenge was finding a container large enough to hold a 26 pound bird - Ziploc XXXL bags (the kind they advertise to hold sports equipment in!) to the rescue - it's food safe and allowed me to "flip" my bird easily to make sure the brine was soaked up by all the areas of the bird.

Once you brine a turkey - especially with this recipe, you'll never go back to a non-brined turkey again.  And the bird does cook A LOT quicker, so just be aware and plan your serving time accordingly!

For those of you worried about the safety of brining a turkey in a non-food grade bucket or trash bag, a brining bag may be a better alternative.  I was unaware of brining bags until I stumbled upon them at Bed, Bath, & Beyond.  The bags I found were safe, inexpensive, spill-proof, and worked great.  When brining, I used half apple juice and half chicken broth, and fresh herbs.  I placed the turkey in the brining bag which I then placed in one of my refrigerator vegetable drawers and left for twelve hours.  I cooked the turkey using the Rosemary Roasted Turkey recipe from this site.  I’ve never brined a turkey before (or cooked one for that matter), but I think I always will from now on! :)

Made this brine with 1/2 veggie broth and 1/2 apple juice, and the rest followed exactly! This was AMAZING! I used it on my 19 pounder and put it in a 5 gallon bucket and stuck it in the fridge for 24 hours. I'm positive this made my turkey amazingly juicy. Tried to pass some turkey to my boyfriend and it was so juicy that it stuck to the plate. Made my first turkey amazing!

This was my first time making a brine (OMG), this is the most wonderful thing in the world. How did I not do this before!!!. I did change the spices a little, I used sage, thyme, basil, fresh ground pepper, kosher salt, brown sugar, chicken stock and water. I used two trash bags put together to brine in, and I sat the bags in the veggie crisper from my fridge. I brined in the bottom of fridge for 16 hours I removed my turkey and rinsed it well, I patted it dry and sat it back in my fridge directly on the rack put a pan under it to catch any drippings. This allowed for it to get really dry so the skin would turn really crisp when cooked, (I'm really glad I did that step). After 4 hrs back in the fridge I grilled mine over charcoal and oak wood using indirect heat for approx 4 hrs to a temp of (180). PS. I never added any more seasoning to the turkey no oil or butter it came out golden brown and very
very very moist and juicy, My family raved on how it was seasoned perfectly. Go figure!!!. I will be using brine on regular poultry also from now on. Thanks a lot. 10 plus stars!!!!!!. Update!!!11/23/07 DID EVERYTHING THE SAME THIS YEAR EXCEPT THIS TIME I USE A 10 GALLON FOOD SAFETY BAG TO BRINE IN.

I've found it easiest to put the turkey in my very large soup pot instead of a bucket or trash bag.  Then either sit the bucket in a cooler with ice packs in the garage or in the snow at Christmas time!

First time cooking a turkey!  I'm gutsy so I thought I'd experiment with brine my first time around.  I could not find any savory, and I was nervous about a cup of salt, and read that a few others had found it salty.  I omitted the savory and reduced to 1/2 cup of sea salt.  (I later realized a lot of people said they substituted chicken for vegetable broth and that could be a reason for the extra saltiness).  Anyway: I LOVED it. EVERYONE loved it.  It was succulent and juicy!!  I cooked my 13 pounder at 500 for 30 minutes uncovered then reduced to 350 for 2.5 hours tented with foil.  I also added chopped celery and carrots to the pan for cooking and the carrots were DELICIOUS.  Drippings make excellent gravy.  Thanks!!!

This recipe is incredible! I first used it a couple of years back and am now the family turkey "pro"! I would suggest only using food grade buckets and bags (like turkey bags)however.  Home Depot buckets and garbage bags are often made with post-consumer plastics (garbage!)and can be toxic.

I brined my Christmas goose with this recipe!  It was exceptional! I made my own vegetable broth using this recipe: http://vegetarian.allrecipes.com/az/WorldsGreatestVegetableBro.asp.  skimmed the veggies and use those for the stuffing and then used the broth for this brine.  Both the stuffing and the goose were raved over!  Second and Third helpings on Christmas day made sure there was no stuffing or goose left!

WOW! Great recipe. I first tried this recipe a couple years ago. I received so many compliments on Christmas Day. So moist and flavorful. No need to baste at all! I like a bit of sweetness in the brine, so I added 1/2 to 3/4 cup brown sugar. You could also try just plain white sugar, or for something extra special, some maple syrup! Try this!!

Not always a big turkey fan because it tends to be too dry, but this turned out really awesome. Will use this method from now on, exclusively. Wonderful! Thanks for sharing. Jazzy-girl

First off, this is a great recipe. When the turkey is stuffed with the Awesome Sausage, Apple and Cranberry Stuffing it is the king of all turkey recipes.   With that said, the easiest way I've found to brine the turkey is to buy two turkey bags from the grocery store. Place your turkey and the brine in the first bag and tie the top. Then, put the second bag around the first one in case spillage or ripping occurs from the first bag. Carry from the bottom and place the bag in the fridge and let sit over night. I've done this twice now and I find it's way easier than trying to find a cooler that fits in the fridge or trying to replace ice in a sink or something. Good luck!

EVERYONE LOVED IT!!  I made this for Thanksgiving Day. I admit I was extremely nervous trying something new on Thanksgiving. My husband thought I lost my mind when he saw me putting the turkey in the cooler on Tuesday. I did make a few changes that other people suggested. I used equal parts chicken broth and apple juice instead of vegetable broth, simply because that's all I had on hand. I cooked the chicken broth, seasonings, & salt along with fresh carrots, onions & celery for about an hour. I removed it from the heat and added the apple juice and let that cool down. I used a 5 gal "sports drink" cooler instead of a bucket. I put the turkey in wings first.  I added the brine and enough ice water to cover it. I let the bird soak for 2 days, checking it periodically and adding more ice to make sure it kept cold.  I cooked it breast side down at 325. Now some people said it cooked faster, but mine did not.  Not exactly sure what happened, so make sure you keep checking that thermometer.  My 21 lb'r took over 5 hours. Other than dinner being a liitle later than planned, it was amazing. It was well worth the wait.  It was incredibly moist...including the white meat. Oh, I did notice the stuffing was a tad bit salty, so make sure you don't add any salt when you're preparing it. I will use this recipe from now on. It was a huge hit.

I have not made a turkey in years!  So, when I saw this brine recipe and read the reviews, I knew I had to make it for Christmas.  My turkey was excellent!!  Like another reader, I was concerned about my turkey staying out all night, but when I took it out of the brine the turkey was very cold.  I followed the instructions except for the savory.  I live overseas and it was not available to me.  I also used half of the vegetable broth and the other half was apple juice.  I stuffed the turkey with celery leaves, onions, garlic, apples, and cranberries for added flavor.  I also followed another "fan" by baking my turkey uncovered for 30 minutes at 500 degrees and I cooked the turkey for the rest of the time at 350 until the temp read 180 degrees(which was about 2 hours and I also covered with foil).  I did not baste my turkey.  I oiled my pan and rubbed my turkey with olive oil before baking.  By the way, the gravy was excellent!  Thanks for the recipe and I will use this recipe again for sure!

I brined with your recipe last night. I thawed the turkey properly and followed all the directions and advice from reviews, made by own stock and added a cup of apple cider as well as a cup of holiday spiced wine. This is the very first time I used a brine and I was pretty scared after re reading the salty comments. I found that using a canning pot gave me enough room to put the brine and turkey back in the fridge for the night. It was perfect, not at all salty, meat was tender, juicy and it browned so beautifully with minimal basting, as you can see in my picture. It was a little extra work, but the results were worth every minute of it. Thank you for sharing your recipe, everyone loved the turkey, there was hardly anything left on the plate aside from the garnish!

Wow!  I used this recipe for a couple of 3 pound fryer chickens, and it worked great.  Really great for preparing the day before.  The amount of flavour surprised me, and the gravy was superb.  (although use water to thin your gravy, chicken stock made it a little salty)  I will definitely use this next time I make a chicken or turkey.  Also, I didn't have a pail, so I used my really huge stock pot.

I used this on the first Turkey I ever roasted and ended up with the juciest turkey I ever tasted. I can't believe everyone doesn't do this!

NOTE: I used chicken boullion instead of vegetable stock, just for the expense. Boullion cubes cost $3 around here, but a gallon of stock costs about $16. It still came out fine.

Even without the Savory, which I couldn't find, this made my turkey come out full of flavor and fall off the bone perfect!  I am a convert.  I am brining my turkeys from now on!1

I use a roasting bag when brining my turkeys and I brine from frozen.. its a great way to defrost the turkey and to keep th water cold.  I put the turkey and the brine in the roasting bag (after removing the plastic, rinsing the turkey and taking the gizzards etc. out).  I then take my cooler and fill it with ice and cold water and place the opening of the bag outside of the cooler and close the lid on the bag so the turkey doesn't slip to far into the water... have done this for 3 years now and have had the best compliments on my turkeys.. have tried many brine's and have yet come to a favorite.. just enjoy experimenting with them

I meant to review this after Thanksgiving. The brine was spectacular and the turkey came out great.  I even accidentally overcooked the turkey (my meat thermometer was apparently broken). It still came out juicy and got raves.

This is fabulous. I used a chicken instead of a turkey and it was super moist and tasty. My husband wouldn't stop raving about it.

Best turkey ever! I'll never make a turkey without brining it 1st! 
I had a 22lb turkey & used 1&1/2 of the ingredients. Be sure to use a 5 gallon paint bucket. It gives you more than enough room and makes clean up a breeze.

I added some crushed garlic and a couple of bay leaves and some peppercorns that I had seen on another site. very good. definitely worth the time to brine. I used the advice of a smart person and put the stockpot into a cooler with ice and covered it with a blanket. the ice lasted all day.

I had never heard of brining a turkey, so I was skeptical, thinking it would be salty.  Let me tell you, my 22 pound bird was so good that my adult kids said mine was WAY better than Gramma's!  I was floored by the flavor of the seasonings and the sea salt.  I used the broth from cans of green beans, etc. and made up the difference with water.  I placed the turkey in a stock pot, set it in a large cooler filled with frozen 2-liter water bottles and water to assure the consistent temperature. In no way was it "too salty", just full of juicy flavor.  I have too many favorite recipes to list from this site, but I guarantee this is number one on my list now.  I sure hope you will try it, because it really is fantastic.  I truly can't say enough good things about this recipe, but I sure thank the contributor!

This is one of the best brine solutions I've tried. It is especially great for smoking in a smoker(a twist on the T-Day Bird and a welcome surprise). I have made this many times for my pastor wife family for their holiday, even the bones left.Use a tall trash bag with the large pot or 5 gal. bucket to retain the solution, lessen air contact and spillage.

This was excellent and a big hit with our family!  I added about 3 cups of orange juice but couldn't tell if it made a difference or not since this is the first time I've tried it.  The gravy was absolutely wonderful and got rave reviews as well!

OK, so I was given the task for preparing the turkey this christmas and as you can tell I am writing this review as the turkey is brining.  So I got a little bit of a late start and will continue the review tomorrow.  So far I used the kosher salt, vegetable broth a pre mix of poultry spices and that's it.  I started the brine this morning and not to go into too much detail as to my mistakes, it looks as if I will have the turkey in the brine for about 5 hours.  As a bachelor I don't have a lot of the cooking utensils so I had to improvise.  I used a clean trash bag and the rubbermaid trash can that well for better words, used for trash of course I cleaned it out.  I put the turkey and the brine in the trash bag, then put the bag and the trash can in the fridge.  So far so good, I have been wanting to keep you up to date on how this will happen as I am not a cook and this recipe seems like it is idiot proof.  The only thing that I am worried about is it not being in the brine long enough, however I will let you know how it will turn out tomorrow.

WOW, I can't begin to tell you guys how good the turkey ended up even after brining the turkey for only 4-5 hours.  I would definitely recommend this recipe.  THe turkey did not end up too salty and the dark meat was almost too moist!!! if you can believe that.  

SO to sum it up I won't do a turkey without it!!

Turkey is a must at Thanksgiving- but this brine takes turkey to a whole new level. A great solution to flavoring the whole bird and not just the skin. Beyond that, you can still season and/or stuff the bird in your favorite way. The brine only serves to bring out natural flavors and keeps the meat very moist. Will do this again and again.

This was my first turkey ever and it was fantastic.  I was worried about my first turkey being too dry or lacking in flavor, but this turkey was definitely neither of those.  It was oh so tasty.  If I ever dare make another one, this will be the recipe I use.

I had never prepared a turkey in this manner.  It was wonderful.  My store did not have dried savory, only fresh, so I used a little less.  The only hard part was finding a 5 gal bucket, but a trip to Home Depot to buy a new paint bucket solved that problem.

Just wonderful! I used a frozen Butterball and worried it would be too salty since they're already preinjected but no worries! Makes a tremendous difference in the meat. Thanks Sheri! We'll do this again at Christmas!

My husband and I tried this brine last year and were so pleased with the results. We doubled the recipe for a 25 pound bird and fed 20 people with no leftovers the bird was picked clean. Can't wait to do it again this year.

Hey! This was the best turkey I ever ate!  The flavor was fantastic and the meat was very moist and tender--even though I cooked it longer than necessary. I only use small to medium turkey and I never stuff them except for some chopped onions and carrots.   Thanks!  My Mom was impressed!

I needed a LOT more vegetable broth to cover my 10 pound turkey in my 5 gallon cooking pot.  I had to get up in the middle of the night to turn the bird since 8 cans on top of what was called for didn't cover him.  Also I wish I had brined it for longer...now that I am reading up on this topic.

This is a standard brine recipe, and although I do not use this one I use Alton Browns Good Eats Roast Turkey one I have to say brining is a MUST...it is foolproof and guarantees you a delicious moist juicy turkey...normally my sister used to make the turkey and it was so dry so one year i took over and brined it and ever since then Ive been in charge of thanksgiving turkeys. TRY IT AND YOULL LOVE IT!

I also think you need to use a low sodium broth or cut the salt to 3/4 cup, otherwise it willbe a tad salty.

I have made this for the past two years for Thanksgiving and this year will be no exception.  It is by far the best Turkey I have ever had.  It does not dry out halfway through the meal and is even better as leftovers.  I soak the turkey in the brine for about 14 hours and then we grill it on the grill, that seals in the moisture and cooks it just right.  It also frees up the oven for those other essentials on Thanksgiving day!  This is worth it, you won't be disappointed!!!

The best brine recipe ever.  Just hosted a dinner and every guest stated it was the best turkey they had ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly as it is, and I used a brining bag instead of the bucket.

This is a REALLY great Brine recipe. That turkey was the moisest one I have ever eaten. It really spoiled me, so when I went to my cousin's house the next day for the big family dinner I didn't really like their turkey (even though it was perfectly fine) just because it wasn't outstanding. :)

I pretty much used this as a base recipe, because I did make a few changes to fit it more to me and my family's tastes. The only changes I made to this was I used a gallon of apple cider instead of vegetable broth (because I do not care for the taste of vegetable broth and did not want it to come out too salty). I also used fresh herbs instead of dry, kosher salt instead of sea, and added 4 smashed garlic cloves to the mix.

I brought the cider, salt, herbs, and garlic to a boil in a large stock pot in order to help the salt dissolve better and to infuse the cider with the spices. I then let it cool to room temperature, added the gallon of ice water and inserted the 15 lb turkey. We kept it in the fridge overnight and then roasted it using the "Homestyle Turkey, the Michigander Way" recipe (with a few modifications) and it was the BEST turkey I had ever eaten.

Thank you SO much for a GREAT brine recipe. I will continue to use this for many more holiday meals. I can't wait until Christmas now. ;)

Like a previous review, I had to double the recipe for a 21 lb turkey. I borrowed their suggestion and used 1 gallon of vegetable broth, and 1 gallon of apple juice. I used an XL ziplock storage bag because it is food safe, istead of a garbage bag. I placed it in a cooler packed with ice and put the cooler on the back porch. I brined it for about 22 hours because I read somewhere to brine it an hour per pound. I don't remember how long it took the turkey to cook, I cooked it uncovered, but when it was time to take it out of the oven, I had to sipher juices out of the pan in order to get it out! This was the juiciest turkey I've EVER had! I also served 2 fried turkeys, a ham, and a roast, and this turkey was a super hit! Although most people at my dinner loved fried turkey, they passed it up for the roasted one because it tasted so good! I will never cook another turkey without brining it first!

I made my first turkey ever using this brine recipe, and it turned out fantastic! I didn't have a bucket, so I used a turkey bag and it worked great. The turkey was completely submerged in all of the briny goodness. I roasted the turkey according to the directions given in Cooks' Illustrated The New Best Recipe cookbook. My fiance thought it was one of the best turkeys he'd ever eaten! I will certainly be using this recipe again!

For extra flavor add 1 half gallon apple juice and 1 half gallon cranberry juice,(or 1 gallon Ocean Spray CranApple juice) around 10 whole cloves, black pepper (to taste, but be careful), and brown sugar (2 cups packed) Also, by adding additional liquids (cranberry and apple juice) it is important to add an addotional cup of salt (2 total) Replace the ice water with 1 gallon water straight from the faucet. Boil all ingredients until the salt and sugar are completely dissolved and the cloves are releasing their oils. Remove from heat and let completely cool before brining the turkey. Also, with a strainer, remove the whole cloves before brining or you may find yourself biting into a clove which is not pleasant.

I did this brine on a turkey for thanksgiving 2010 it was great, I did add my own twist, I added 1/2 gallon vegtable stock and 1/2 gallon of apple cider and a cup of brown sugar. I did a twenty pound turkey and smoked it with hickory chips and chunks. My wife did one in the oven just regular and I smoked this one with the brine recipe. The smoked one disappeard as did the oven baked one but the brined and smoked was a way bigger hit. Thank you for this recipe

I have always had good luck with a flavourful turkey, but had never used a brine before.  This blew my family away....very moist with incredible flavour.

I am only giving it 4 stars because I changed it, but this is a really good base to start out with. But what is great about brine is that you can really do no wrong, this is because it is more about the moistness instead of the flavor. I mean it add flavor, but if you add orange juice, your turkey isn't going to taste like an orange, maybe only slightly. But I used half a gallon of vegetable broth, and the other half gallon I used apple juice like others. I also used less salt since others complained about saltiness. I didn't have savory, so I didn't use that, but I couldn't tell the difference. I also added some Samuel Adams beer. This Turkey came out so moist and golden. My bf said he thought that turkeys couldn't really look like that. Some said it was best turkey they ever had, and my sister who doesn't like turkey told me that she even enjoyed it

OMGosh.  We usually rotisserie our T-day turkey & it comes out tasty, but thought to try brining this year for the heck of it.  OMGosh.  You could cut the breast meat with a fork it was so tender, juicy, flavorful!  As mentioned, it also cooked faster on a rotisserie, so worked well it let it rest & rotate without heat the last 1/2 hr before carving.  Thank you!

MAKE SURE you do not use a BUTTERBALL, KOSHER, or self basting turkey.  It MUST be fresh and not already soaked in salt.  Butterball pre-brines their birds so you will have a salty mess.  Brining is for fresh brids with no other additives!  I added garlic, apple juice,  and mulling spices from William Sonoma.  Very Good! Start a day early, so you have time to remove the bird for a good overnight dry out with some salt on the skin.  this will make crispy skin.

Not to gloat, but I ROCKED the Thanksgiving table with this turkey! It was my first ever, and I don't need to look any further. After brining, I rubbed the bird down with melted butter, salted and peppered, then filled the cavity with a mixture of orange juice concentrate, cloves, 3 garlic cloves, celery salt, and onion powder (kind of an experiment). I'm not sure which, that or the brining, flavored the meat so beautifully. Regardless, it made the meat, even the white stuff, moist and chock-full of flavor. And the gravy? Don't get me started! Like I said, I'm the self-proclaimed hero, and everyone else agreed. Oh, and I roasted the bird in a Reynolds Turkey Bag and let it sit for 45 minutes before carving it.

I only have one problem with this recipe......My family drools when they smell me cooking the brine.  They know what is coming and they go CRAZY.  Oh yes,  and now I am the one volunteered to cook all the birds for our family functions.  This recipe makes a very moist and tasty bird.

It doesn't get any better than this.  This is the second year I've brined my turkey using this recipe.  Always rave reviews on how moist and flavorful it is.  This year, I used apple juice instead of broth and did notice that it browned faster than I was expecting at the beginning (my wing tips got a little burned!).  But I covered it up quickly and had a nice, golden turkey.  A friend of mine who also used the same recipe then deep-fried her turkey and she said the whole thing turned black!  It tasted great, though, but the sugars in the apple juice couldn't take the high temps of the oil.  I think next year I'll go back to broth.

I want to make sure everyone knows: NEVER BRINE A BASTED TURKEY LIKE A FROZEN BUTTERBALL OR JENNIE-O. It should to be a fresh turkey the frozen basted turkeys are in a solution so basically they have already been in a  brine. I do recommend the breast side down first use a V rack lined with heavy duty foil, poke hole to let the juices run through. Flip after and hour or 2 depending on the size of your bird. Anyway this brine is amazing!!!

I was only able to brine for about 8 hours due to so many things that got in the way of my holiday travel plans But those few hours were enough to make a difference. My boyfriend typically prefers dark meat but he enjoyed the white meat because it was the juiciest he had ever had. I used Poultry seasoning and savory, because buying the others separately was pricey. For the bag, I found a brining bag at Bed Bath and Beyond. I put the turkey in the bag, filled with liquid and sat it in a cooler with ice. I am anxious to try it again. Perhaps cutting down the amount for just a whole chicken  :)

Last year I used a granite-ware pot (the kind used for water bath canning) and put the turkey in with the brine on the bottom shelf of the fridge. Worked great!

A classic brine, one that I will use again and again. It's hard to find savory, and I've read that savory is close to both thyme and sage so not using it isn't going to hurt much. Use a low sodium broth. More and more stores are carrying low sodium product so you should be able to find it easily. All turkeys are brined so you don't want to go overboard on the salt content. Using a low sodium broth can help.

This was wonderful, I did do something most people don't.  I cooked the bird on the grill (in a heavy duty foil pan) Upside down (the legs and breast on the bottom) This brings all the juices to the breast and legs.  The breast meat just fell apart when I carved it, the flavor was wonderful.

This was unbeatable and so easy!!!  I thought it was kind of wasteful and excessive to use that much broth for a brine, so I just used water instead.  I also forgot to boil the spices into the brine (broth), but it still came out sooo juicy and delicious.  I bet boiling before placing the chicken (turkey) in the brine would make it more flavorful, but if you don't have time it works very well without doing that as well.  This could very well go on our weekly family menu!  :-)

This was truly wonderful. I ended up substituting apple juice for part of the broth, and added extra cold water to have enough for my container. I did not add any seasonings when I actually roasted it, but it tasted perfect. The broth was the same. 
I typically brine my turkeys in something less dramatic, and have had good success, but this was much better. I will continue with this brine in the future.

I made a "test run" utilizing the recipe and it was out of this world, very moist and flavorful.  I soaked the turkey in a 5 gallon bucket for approximatly 36 hours, then put it on the smoker, came off golden brown and tastey!!  Thanks!

I simmered chopped onions, carrots and celery along with the all spices on medium-low for a few hours to make the vegetable broth.  I was concerned about the bird tasting very salt but I was wrong, our turkey turned out wonderful!  The juciest ever!  We will definately be doing this to all our turkeys in the future!

My best turkey ever!  I improvised some by using approx. 1/2 gallon apple juice plus water instead of vegetable broth, and used the commercially blended "Poultry Seasoning".  I started the bird at 500 degrees for 20 minutes to brown, then down to 350 and covered the bird with foil until 180 degrees in the thigh. No one even wanted gravy!

this brine is amazing,  I never seem to have the dried herbs so I use ground and it seems to work fine.  I have thrown in some brown sugar to add something sweet.  I have been doing this brine for the past 2 years and I am blown away that the turkey never comes out dry or overly salty

Made this brine for smoking turkey legs and thighs.The flavor and tenderness was outstanding!! Very simple to make and a must for smoking turkey. Soaked the pieces for 4 hours and they came out great. I did add 3 tablespoons of minced garlic as well.

I made this last night and it was incredible!  I was told by two of the women guests that it was the best turkey they had ever had!!!!

The only thing I changed was to add 1 litre of apple juice and vegetable stock since I only had one box of the vegetable stock at home.  I also added fresh sage, fresh chives, fresh tarragon, fresh savory and fresh tyme as I have a herb garden that needed to be harvested.  

I will definitely do this again and again!!!!!

I brine with water and extra spices and it turns out moist and amazing. 1 gallon of broth that I have to throw away later seems like a waste to me.

Extra effort and expense, but worth it!  Everyone loved the moist and tasty turkey.  I've finally achieved a moist turkey!  Just be sure the turkey is well thawed before brining, roast the turkey until internal temperature of thigh is 165 degrees F and then check at the thigh to see if juices are running clear.  For my unstuffed 16lb turkey it took only 2.5 hours (at least 30 minutes faster than expected because of it having been brined for 9 hours).

A-MAZING! I always wanted to brine a turkey but was afraid of the "too salty" issue. I read a lot of reviews and decided to just do it! I decided to go the expense and use celtic sea salt (didn't want all that sodium.). I used 3/4 cup instead of the full cup. Brined a  20lb. turkey for 16 hours. I put it in the oven uncovered at 500 degrees for a 1/2 hour, then reduced the heat to 325. I checked it in 3 1/2 hours and it was more than done, but not in the least dried out. It was the juiciest turkey I have ever eaten. I used fresh herbs, but could not taste them at all. The gravy was perfect after adding the flour and water mixture. There was no need to season the gravy and it was outstanding in flavor. I also found the brining bag at Bed, Bath & Beyond and put the turkey ina cooler surrounded by ice. I will definitely be brining again next year.

Incredibly moist although my turkey didn't cook any faster.  I did use half vegetable broth, half apple juice) and kosher salt in place of sea salt.  I roasted my turkey as usual, with orange slices in the cavity and fresh basil under the skin.  Very moist, lots of compliments!

I got so many compliments on my first turkey! I will never cook a turkey without brining again. I might put a little less salt next year, but that's personal taste as the whole family loved it. Also, the leftovers were just as good and moist. I grilled our 16lb turkey and brined for 24 hours and it took a little over 3 hours to finish. I also put a little butter all over the outside during the last 30 minutes or so of cooking to get the skin nice and crispy.

What a flavorful bird! My first time ever brining/baking a turkey (not a fan btw) on thanksgiving and it was a success! My husband thought it had a distinctive taste to it because of the dried herbs he's not used to. Well, my daughter didn't comment on the taste....just enjoyed it. *** Since it was just the 3 of us, we got a 10 lb turkey.  We brined ours in a oven bag and placed it inside a small/fitted cooler. Baked it at 325 for 3.25 hours starting with breast side down first.

A good way to brine your turkey is in a large turkey sized baking bag inside your fryer pot.  You can use less brine and close the bag, dump ice on top, and put it in your garage instead of taking up room in your fridge.  I have been doing it this way for years.

awesome! I made my first turkey ever for thanksgiving last year with this recipe and I am now in charge of the turkey bc it was so great. I couldn't figure out how to fit a bucket in the fridge, so I just used my bottom crisper drawer and it worked great.

This was my first time using a brine.  I used this for my 20 lb turkey (doubled recipe) on Thanksgiving.  Everyone had their doubt and really did not think they would like the turkey BUT they LOVED IT.  We had 15 people eating and there was very little leftovers. 
Since I doubled the recipe I used 1 gallon chicken stock and 1 gallon of Apple Juice and 2 cups of sea salt.  I put the turkey in a big food grade bucket (found at Walmart) and kept it outside over night (cold enough to keep it cool).  I cooked it at 500 for 30 minutes then turned the temp down to 325 for 3 hours and it was perfect!!!!

Loved this recipe.  First attempt at brining and will never go back.  Although I did not use as much vegetable broth as it called for I think it still came out perfect.  Thank you for this recipe.

Excellent!  The turkey turned out so flavorful and juicy.  I looked at the recipe for vegetable broth and when I saw all the veggies it required, I decided it would be cheaper to use 2 packages of Knorr Spring Vegetable soup mix.  Use 1 gallon of water to 1 pack of dry soup mix.  After cooking on low for 2 hours, strain thoroughly.  I will use this recipe over and over again!  Try it, you will NOT be disappointed!!  You will get so many compliments!

This past Christmas was the first time I've ever brined a turkey...what a treat!  I had to cook 4 turkeys on different days this year, and each and every one turned out perfectly. I printed out copies of the recipe, because I knew after the first one that people would request the recipe the next time.  One of the turkeys cooked waaaay too quickly and was actually overcooked, but to my great surprise, it was still as moist and tender as could be, even though it was literally falling off the bone.  Both my sisters and 3 of my friends all tried it, and all were thrilled with the results.  I'll never cook another turkey (or chicken, for that matter), without brining it again. Thanks for a great recipe.

I used this for a turkey breast instead of a whole turkey and smoked it. The flavor was great, and it browned up nicely. I've brined other meats before and am always impressed by how flavorful the meat is without being too salty. This was nicely tender, and the leftovers tasted so good in turkey tetrazzini a few nights later!

Excellent way to prepare your turkey.  Initially, while boiling the brine, I thought the smell of it was horrible and wasn't sure if I wanted to finish.  BUT, I'm glad I did.  The aroma that came from the turkey while it cooked was fantasic and everyone commented on how flavorful it was.  I do recommend that when soaking the bird overnite, that you place the bucket in a cooler packed with ice.  We were too afraid to leave it out all night unrefridgerated.  It worked beautifully!  Happy Cooking!!

We have now used this twice with rotisserie chickens. I never have vegetable broth, though, so I've had to use chicken broth. It's still wonderful. I imagine it's perfect for turkey, too. I will never again cook a chicken or turkey without brining it, and this is my favorite brine so far.

I've used this brine for 3 years now going on a 4th. My Thanksgiving birds never tasted so good. I like to use half vegetable broth and half apple cider. It makes the most juiciest, flavorful bird with drippings to die for. Best gravy ever. I can't wait for Thanksgiving this year.

This is the second time we have brined a Turkey. My husband smoked the turkey and I made the brine, of course he got all the credit. When he asked me if he could buy vegetable broth by the gallon, I knew I better step in on this one. I made the broth with vegetables and fresh rosemary and thyme from the garden. Just the smell of the broth was heaven. The turkey was beautiful golden on the outside and juicy moist on the inside. The flavor of vegetable broth clearly comes through on this one. The turkey was picked clean, we didn't have anything left. I would highly suggest you make your own vegetable broth.

I used a variation of this for my bird this year to rave reviews.  People said they had never tasted a better bird, and I am inclined to agree!  I did half broth and half apple cider, mainly because I like a little sweetness, and because I only had 2 quarts of broth.  Also added 1/2 cup brown sugar, and skipped the savory, since I didn't have it, and used poultry seasoning instead.  It was SO good!  I then cooked it according to Alton Brown's recipe for a brined bird, with aromatics in the cavity, and with fresh sage and whole garlic cloves stuffed under the skin.  Delish!

Don't worry about the salt quantity...if you're nervous, use kosher salt. You will rinse the bird, and the salt just helps everything permeate the turkey's tissue.  

Like everyone says: started brining a couple years back, will never do it any other way. 

FYI, I have never tried otherwise, but most recipes say not to bring more than 12-15 hours.

People who say this is too salty more than likely used table salt, and not a course sea salt or kosher salt. Also 1 cup of sugar can be used to counter balance the salt. Also you must rinse the turkey when you take it out of the brine.

Love this simple brine recipe.  So Juciy everyone loves when I make this!  I have a small fridge with no room and I do not have a 5 gallon bucket... But I do have a 5 gal Igloo insulated drink cooler- Which worked perfectly for my 20lb turkey.

Very yummy!  I agree with the reviewer who said we shouldn't use anything other than food grade plastic to brine our turkey's.  One suggestion I wanted to make:  I use the pot from my (turkey) deep fryer to brine. It's big enough to hold a large turkey and we keep it out in the garage, adding ice to the brine if the temp gets too warm outside.  (We usually only make turkeys in the colder months, so it's rarely required.)

VERY moist and flavor full but to salty, hand felt a bit bloated later.  Many said it was the best turkey ever.

delish moist turkey! extra large freezer bag couldn't hold the weight (even when supported in a bucket) so had to transfer to a kitchen catcher garbage bag to save christmas... was worth the possiblity of non food grade plastic contaminates!

OUT OF THIS WORLD!! I made my first Thanksgiving dinner, because my mom had to work, 36 years ago. I wish I had known this then. I have never brined a turkey....I will never not brine one again. It made a picture perfect turkey inside and out. I will never cook a turkey any other way. I got sooooo many compliments on the looks of the bird and just how juicy it was. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful solution to the dry turkey sydrome we have all encountered. Gone are those days!

This recipe has made me the Offical Turkey Roaster for all turkey dinners.  The meat is so tender and juicy and the skin so crispy and tasty!   I usually add a few cloves of garlic as well.

I had a 14 lb turkey and used this recipe to brine it the day before cooking, I only brined it for 15 hrs.  I used a turkey cooking bag to brine it in and kept the bag in a cooler on our back porch (very cold weather here already).  The only thing I changed was instead of a gallon of broth, I used 4 cans of chicken low sodium broth and the remainder of the gallon with apple juice.  It was the 1st time I've brined a turkey and it came out fantastic!!! Over the years I avoid eating the white meat b/c it's always dry, but my husband even said the white meat was his favorite part of it all! It really did make a difference, I got many compliments over the turkey.  I will ALWAYS use this recipe before I cook another turkey again.  I may try cutting the 1 cup of sea salt down to 3/4 cup next time just to see what happens. The cooked turkey was not salty to the taste, however I did not add any salt for seasonings before cooking, but my fingers were a bit swollen in the morning! Great recipe.

Turkey turned out great!  Not sure what I've done wrong in the past but this time it was excellent.

On the subject of food grade plastics, I use a standard five gallon bucket from Home Depot and  I line it with one of those turkey size oven bags from Reynolds (for up to 24 lb turkeys).  Its a perfect fit.  Brine + ice goes in, then the turkey and then seal it with the lid that came with the bucket.

Started using a brine a few years ago and have never looked back.  Amazing turkey! For those like me who live in colder climate - I simply put it in a cooler and set on the patio overnight.  No fridge required!

This is a great brine. I added crushed rosemary, sage, thyme and garlic before heating. Very important to let the bring get COLD before placing the turkey in the brine. I used a fresh, free range turkey and it couln't have turned out better. Free range turkey is a little more expensive but well wort it. This was the second time I brined a turkey and will never go back to traditional turkey again.

What a pain to bathe a 25 pound turkey in a 5 gallon bucket, but ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT!!!  We had 15 people and they raved about the turkey being the best they ever had.  Even the white meat was moist and juicy.  This was my first time brining, but will now do it for whole chicken, turkey, and anything else I can think of!

I can't believe I forgot to review this!  I used this brine for our Thanksgiving turkey.  It was fantastic.  I had never brined a turkey before and now I will never do it any other way.  I don't think that the herbs added anything to it though.  But the turkey was so moist and fabulous.  I think next time I will leave out the herbs though.  Seemed like a waste because we couldn't taste them.  Thanks Sheri!

This was the BEST turkey I have ever made, or tasted.  I baked my turkey in a brown paper grocery bag ( a first for me, it's fantastic) and it was so tender and juicy you almost didn't even have to chew it!  It made tons of stock, so I had enough stock to make a huge batch of gravy.  The gravy was so good that one of my guests jokingly asked me if I had a straw so he could drink it!  When my guests took the first bite of turkey I heard a lot of ooh's and ah's.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, I will always make my turkey this way.

WOW - this was the moistest turkey I've ever eaten!  I've never brined before, which was quite difficult for a novice chef, but it worked great!  I must admit it was a little sweet, perhaps a bit too much Rosemary for my taste.  But the gravy was FABULOUS!  I got so many compliments on the gravy.

To cook I coated my 13 lb. turkey with Canola oil and baked at 500 for 30 minutes for a fabulous brown skin, then lowered to 350 for 2 1/2 hours.  YUMMMY!

I heard brining was great, and everyone is right. I did substitute some apple juice for some of the veg broth like another reviewer suggested, and wonder if thats why the turkey got so brown so quickly (the sugars. It also did get done way faster than normal, so I highly suggest using a thermometer to judge it. I roasted the turkey using the "Perfect Turkey" also on the site, just used this brine instead of that one. Great!

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving two years ago and won't use anything else.  As another subscriber suggested, I substituted apple cider for about half of the water and that lends a great flavor to the meat and the gravy.

I will never roast a turkey without a brine.  This is an easy, basic brine.   It will ensure a juicy, flavorful bird!  Brining drastically shortens oven time...  Use a good meat thermometer to indicate doneness.

I used this for just a turkey breast, around 6-8 pounds. I followed most of the directions except i used home-grown rosemary, about 3 long sprigs (I used the trailing rosemary not the shrub rosemary). What's nice about turkey breast is it completely submerses in the 2-gallon brine. While roasting I started taking internal temperature measurements after 1 1/2 hours and found out it was done 15 minutes later. I let the turkey stand for 15-20 minutes before carving. Unbelievably moist and tasty results! My father-in-law, who doesn't eat turkey, tried some and helped himself to another few slices! Now my mother-in-law wants the recipe. We plan on making her a holiday "bucket" containing all the ingredients (except for the turkey) and wrapping it up for Christmas. Thanks for the recipe, Sheri!

Cannot even describe how amazing this was. My mom's turkeys have always been just okay, and so I decided to take charge for Easter dinner and make this. It was my first turkey and no one could believe how incredibly juicy, tender, and moist it was. I followed the recipe for the brine exactly, including just letting the bucket sit in a cool place overnight. To cook it, I put an onion, carrot and celery stalk into the cavity. It started breast side down in a 325 degree oven for 2 hours. Then I turned it over and it took another 45 minutes or so to be done. For the last 15 minutes I turned the oven up to 400 to finish browning and basted it with a little butter. Did not cover it with foil, and otherwise didn't bother basting it. The meat was literally falling off the bones it was so tender and the flavor went all through the meat. It was seriously about as foolproof as you could get. The only change I'll make next time is to either reduce the sea salt or substitute water for some of the vegetable broth. It was just a touch on the salty side, I think because broth is often high in salt to begin with. Don't be afraid to try this recipe, it really was that easy. Cannot recommend it enough.. and ditto the other reviewers' comments on the drippings -- they make amazing gravy.

I had a turkey in my deep freeze, it had been there for quite awhile. I found this recipe hoping it would moisten the bird back up. (longer you have a bird in a deep freeze, more likely it is to dry out from being in there for a couple of years)

Not only did it bring moisture back into the bird, but it was the most juicy, tasty bird we had ever had! It made the best gravy too! This is a keeper. I will never cook another turkey without the brine ever again!

I'll ONLY eat a brined bird! Alton Brown, of "Good Eats" has a great segment if you've not seen it on the how and why, as well as safety aspects. This is a good brine recipe.

I use this brine every year for my holiday turkeys and also for chicken. My variation is as follows. I use chicken broth and apple juice and kosher salt. The trick is to simmer so the salt is fully dissolved. After brining, I follow "The World's Best Turkey" by Sarah on allrecipes.  I put garlic butter under the skin and inject my turkey with Tony Chachere's cajun butter.  An apple and onion in the cavity, into the turkey bag breast side down with a bottle of champagne.  Half way through flip the turkey over for an hour then remove the bag to brown the skin.  I have this down to a science and am not wavering. Haha.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I doubled this recipe because I had a huge turkey and wanted to make sure that I had enough to fully immerse the turkey in the brine. I used a storage box, but purchased a big food safe plastic bag, and put the brine, including the iced water, in the plastic bag, and set it in the box, which had a secured lid. Then, I put the whole thing on the deck on a below freezing night and the brine did not freeze. This worked very well, though I was initially concerned that the the brine may not all fit in the bag. Be careful when removing the turkey. The bottom of the bag busted as I removed the turkey and I had a real mess on my hands. The turkey flavor was moist and delicious. Turning such a huge turkey is NOT easy. I actually tore the turkey a bit when turning it because the meat was so tender.

This didn't work for us. The turkey didn't taste any more moist or juicier than when we used a turkey bag.  We even used the turkey bag to cook the brined bird just so it would be extra moist.  So disappointing.  We didn't overcook it either. The bird cooked a lot faster just like the recipe stated and we followed that time difference and took it out when it reached the correct temperature.  Can't figure out why we didn't have the same results as all the happy reviewers.  Did everyone else cook their turkeys the old fashioned way prior to brining and thought it was so great because it was juicer than the old way, but would have gotten the same result if they had just used a turkey bag? That is the only thing I can think of. Brining added so much time and money (given that vegetable stock cost $3 a carton) to our dinner for zero reward.

I have never brined before and was really nervous about it as I've been totally happy with making my bird traditionally... basting and turning the bird, cooking slowly for longer time, etc... to make a tender, juicy turkey. 

Well, this recipe was GREAT! I think I will be brining every turkey from now on! I DID reduce the salt from 1 cup to 3/4 because I was nervous about it and since I was brining a 23 pounder (doubled the recipe) I didn't have room for failure. I liked it with the reduced salt. It was NOT too salty. I brined for ten hours in a cooler. I also added onion powder and garlic to the mix. It turned out heavenly. One of the best Thanksgiving Turkeys I've ever made. The meat is light and literally flakes away from the bone. Amazing!

I just used this recipie for ideas. This is what I did; for the brine we used 4qt of broth, chopped chive, crushed peppercorn, and garlic. 22lb turkey. We cleaned out one of our coolers and put the turkey in that, just filled the rest with water after adding broth to cover the turkey. We soaked it for 2 days. Rinse well and pat dry. Put butter under the skin and rub all over turkey. In the cavity put 1 stick of butter, onion, garlic, celery and poltry seasoning. Bake at 400 uncovered for 30min then 350 for 2hrs covered. Its the BEST turkey EVER!!!

This recipe helped me make the best turkey I've ever made.  My Grandmother was an amazing cook and my dad and mom both said it was the most moist turkey they've ever had.  So that comment alone makes this recipe shine!

I used this brine recipe for my first turkey ever.  It was very good, and made a delicious gravy.  But I was hoping the turkey would have been a little more moist.  All the other reviews gave me high expectations.  Don't get me wrong, it was very good, but I was hoping for stellar and didn't get those results.  I will most likely use it again next year though, as I can't imagine a moister turkey using a different method.

Will never, never ever bake a turkey again without doing this critical step again! The turkey literally fell apart, and was so moist/juicy! Guests were full, and still going back for thirds. I wish I could rate this 10 stars.

This Brine was easy and helped my Turkey come out succulent and flavorful. I used a turkey oven bag placed inside a garbage bag to soak in over night,as to avoid BPA's.

I contacted a local restaurant (Applebees) and was able to get a 5 gallon condiment bucket. It's was a lifesaver, since I didn't want my turkey soaking in a questionable buckey :) Good Luck & Happy Turkey Day

I am making this as I write... The only thing so far I would change is to the directions.  In step one, where is says to add the spices and then boil.  I wasn't paying the greatest attention to the pot on the stove, and it boiled over a little.  All the spices were floating on the top, so I lost them all.  I added the spices back in right after I took the broth mixture off of heat.  That seemed to work better.  Otherwise, so far so good!

I gave this recipe to my Mother-In-Law to avoid another one of her dry turkeys. This was fabulous! It was the best turkey I've ever had, better than deep fried. Of course, I let her take all the credit.

We had the best turkey in the turkey frier with this brine.  We did 2 turkeys, one in the oven and one in the fryer and the brined turkey in the frier was the winner.  We used chicken broth because there was a sale on it and it turned out just as good as vegetable.

This certainly made a difference in how delicious the turkey was.  We made our own vegetable broth without any salt to keep down the cost of this and it worked out great.  We brined the turkey in the kitchen sink plugged overnight.  This way there was very little cleanup the next morning you just unplug the drain and you are done!

THIS TURKEY came out great. I actually used a turkey roasting bag to brine the turkey in, I put the turkey in the bag in a cooler on top of ice, with ice all around it, I didnt get it into the brine until about 2 am the night before, and threw it in the oven (after rinsing of course) about 10am, this turkey came out soooooooooo juicy and yummy! the only thing I changed was that I stuffed about 1/4 cup of butter, cut into slices under the skin of the turkey on top of the breast( by separating the skin from the breast gently beforehand). The only thing I did not have leftovers of WAS THE TURKEY!!!! everyone asked for the recipe and this turkey was soooooo good... thankyou very very much for a VERY good and SIMPLE recipe!!!

I used this to brine some cut up chicken I was going to be grilling.  I left it in for around 10 hours.  It was the best, juiciest grilled chicken my family and I have ever had.  I will use this again and again.  Thanks so much!

I've been deep frying turkeys for years now because I like how juicy the meat turns out. I heard about turkey brine recipes and thought I'd give it a shot. I brined my 16 pound turkey for 24hrs and then deep fried it. It turned out 10x's better. The meat was even more juicer than I thought it ever be. I will always brine/deep fry a turkey from now on.

Once you brine,you forever will! Turkey sized oven bags come two/box.  I use one for the brine bath (then put it inside my picnic cooler)and one to cook. 

This is easy and the gravy is sooooo good!  I even make the veg stock a day in advance (much cheaper than buying).

This was the first time I've been in charge of cooking the turkey - and it was a huge hit!!  Be warned that it does cook very quickly - and there will be NO leftovers!!!  Definitely recommend for all!

I doubled the recipe for an 18 pound turkey and placed it in the brine for 18 hours. Then  I cooked it at 475 for 2 hours, and it was hands down the best turkey I have ever had. The only difference is I substituted apple juice for the water.

I used half as much sea salt and it turned out great!  To cook my 12 lb turkey, I removed it from the brine and patted it dry.  I added 2 celery stalks and 2 carrots to the cavity, then layed it breast down in the roaster for 2 hours at 325 degrees.  Then I flipped it and cooked it at the same time with the stuffing at 350 degrees for an additional hour.  I then removed it and let it sit for 20 min. before slicing it.  For the gravy my mom took the drippings and added some flour and water, cooking it in a saucepan.

There is really no way to mess up a brine, in my opinion, as long as you have the fundamental ingredients of water and salt. All the extras just add to the flavor and that's why I gave this recipes 5 stars. I used the combo of spices and my bird turned out so juicy and flavorful. I didn't have vegetable broth (and didn't really want to spend the money on a gallon of it) so I used 4 oz. of apple cider and 12 oz. of cold water. I didn't exactly follow the directions to a tee because I was too lazy to boil everything and then bring it to room temperature -- I simply mixed everything together cold and started brining right away -- and it still turned out great. I also added a handful of peppercorns. Brining is definitely the way to go. I used a 13 lb. bird and a turkey brining bag that I got at Bed, Bath and Beyond. I was able to fit my bird in the bag standing on end inside a tall stock pot. I gathered the top of the bag with a rubber band to make sure the brine completely covered the top of the turkey. I didn't have to bother with flipping the turkey 1/2 way through because it was completely saturated from head (or, rather, neck?) to toe. My dad (who has been the turkey chef in the family, up until now) applauded me for the juiciest turkey breast he has ever tasted. The juices were literally dripping down the breast as he carved it. I am now a brining devotee and would never go without brining again!

For all of you charcoal grill fans, this brine is great. I have been cooking both Thanksgiving and Christmas turkeys on my Weber for the past few years and the results have been great. If you choose to cook your turkey on a Weber, watch it like a hawk! They really do cook faster (brined) than in an oven (un-brined). A digital thermometer is a must.  I usually take the bird off of the grill at about 170 degrees and let it rest for about 20-30 min. MmmmMmmm-good!

I used this recipie last year for our thanksgiving turkey, and was so happy to be able to locate it again.  No one in the family had ever had a brined turkey, and even grandma said it was one of the best that she ever had.  Try it out - it's not as labor intensive as it seems.

I used this for my first turkey ever, and all I can saw is WOW. The turkey was the mose tender, juicy, flavorful turkey I have ever had in my whole life. I will never make one without brining it first ever. When I took it out that morning and rinsed it, I used another recipe that calls for rubbing a stick of butter all over the turkey, using chicken/turkey stock, and basting every 30 minutes. Rubbing the softened stick of butter all over the turkey was a bit challenging, considering the turkey was cold, and butter hardens as it gets cold, but it was well worth the work. This was an awesome recipe.

I love roasted chicken, But I will never 'just' roast it again! Must admit, I didn't wait for the brine to cool completly or wait the 24 hours for it to sit in the fridge. Made a 5lb chicken. I lifted the skin from the breast area and put butter pats. I then stuffed the bird with garlic cloves which we made garlic bread to go with dinner. Even tho I didn't give it the time required, it was still heavenly. My kids usually only eat the breast. Last night there were no left overs. I mean they ate the whole thing. Afterward I was informed - I am not to cook it any other way. My bosses have spoken! I want to give this 6 stars!

I added some wine to the mix and my turkey came out PERFECT. It was so tender and flavorful. The meat literally fell off as soon as I took the turkey out of the oven. I stuffed my 16 pound turkey with onion quarters, garlic cloves and lemon quarters and cooked for about 3 hours.

Delicious! I tried this on a whole chicken, scaling the recipe down to 4 servings. It was not enough and I ended up with 2x the water called for. I let it soak in a large stew pot for 8 hours. It took about an hour at 325 in a convection oven. I cooked it beer-butt fashion, emptying the beer and using 1/2 can of the brine. it was really juicy and tender, and more flavorful. The skin was brown and crispy. Definately an improvement over the usual way of baking poultry. And it was not difficult in any way. I will try it on turkey next time. 
UPDATE: cooked an 18 lb turkey for thanksgiving, and wow! I did use 1/2 apple juice instead of all broth and similar spices on hand. At 300 the turkey would have been done in 2 hours...so I turned the heat down to 275 when the internal temp was 135 and it was done in 3 hours! the breast meat was REALLY MOIST...I found that amazing in such a large bird. Everyone at the table agreed it was a 5 star turkey!

I just realized that I had not yet reviewed this recipe. I too thought this was a lot of work for an OK turkey. While the turkey did stay very moist, the flavor was not at all better from my regular method. I would have rated this a "one star" had it not been for the moistness of the meat. I would not waste my time again with this one.

I soaked my turkey overnight in the brine.  It came out juicy, but I really can't  tell the difference between brining the turkey and the way I normally make  it. (butter, seasoning). I don't think it was worth all the trouble.

what a delicious way to prepare turkey!  I actually made a turkey breast only, but still wanted to try the brining process on a small scale.   I cooked and cooled the brine, then lined a large stockpot with a roasting bag.  I placed the breast in the bag, then filled and tied the bag.  It was perfect-- the stockpot kept it under control in the fridge, and the bag kept the turkey soaking in the juices.

This brine smelled so good while it boiled that I dipped rolls into it to eat.  It tasted so good.  That being said, the turkey ended up being way too salty.  We didn't even eat the leftover turkey because the salt was so overpowering.  The gravy was good, though.  If I cut way down on the salt next time, I think it will be perfect.

An easy recipe that gives awesome results.  I let the turkey breast sit for close to 24 hours.  The results were awesome - very moist without any basting.  The spices added a wonderful flavor to the bird.  My only complaint is that there were no leftovers - everyone loved it!

I loved this recipe!  It took a bit of time to prepare and cool but was well worth the effort.  Also, my husband had to help me pour everything into the bucket and then carry it outside so I would say this is a two person job.  The turkey was moist and juicy and I will definitely be brining again next year.  The gravy was spectacular!  Thanks so much.

I have never brined a turkey before so I tried it for Thanksgiving on a 30 lb. turkey. My store was out of dried rosemary so I tripled some fresh and used that instead. I let it soak for nearly 24 hours and then roasted as I normally would. The only problam I encountered was that the turkey finished cooking over an hour early! It was delicious and juicy and very easy to carve. The whole house smelled wonderful as it was baking. I will definitely do this again next year since it pretty much guarantees a great turkey. Thanks for the great recipe.

LOVE IT! I substitute 1/2 gallon of apple juice and 1/2 gallon chicken broth for the vegetable broth. This is the recipe I used to make my first turkey and I have never had a better turkey in my life - this recipe is IT for me!

People should remember to rinse and pat dry the turkey after taking it out of the brine.  I saw a comment that one person's was too salty.  That's the reason.

Incredible! I will never make a mother turkey and not use this recipe. The Savory is a little challenging to find but most natural foods stores have it. Try to find a turkey that hasn't been treated with solution for juiciness. Most frozen turkeys have been treated with a sodium solution to help retain moisture when cooked. If you do use a turkey that has had the solution, try to use low sodium stock if you plan to use the drippings for gravy otherwise it will be like tasty salt lick. Another tip: place the turkey breast side down for the first hour then turn it breast side up and continue cooking till done. Breast side down helps make the breast meat even more juicy.

I have used All Recipes for the last five years and this is my first time writing a review. I took a big chance on this recipe, it was my first turkey. It turned out amazing. Everyone and I mean everyone who tasted the bird talked about it for days. I have not seen white meat disappear so fast at Thanksgiving. It was a amazing. It didn't need any gravy. I will be making this again.

This was the best turkey I ever cooked!  The white meat was tender and moist, even a couple of days after I cooked it.  I will never cook a turkey again without brining it first!  Thanks for posting!!!

I think I made the mistake of letting the turkey sit in the brine too long and it came out very salty. The flavor was great, but I will definitely cut back on the time and see if that makes a differnce

Getting back to the turkey brine..... I posted a note before Thanksgiving stating I was going to alter the salt portion of the recipe, which I did.  It was helpful to use the 33% less sodium broth and I decreased the sea salt by 1/4 cup leaving a full 3/4 cup of salt to be used.
So here's what happened.... The turkey was doing great however I made the mistake of not putting a thermometer in the old bird.  I planned to cook the turkey for about 4 hours.  Well at the 3 hour mark it was at 180 degrees.... Holy you know what!!!!!  Someone turned up the temp without telling me and because I wasn't diligent about checking on the bird she heated up way to fast.  I pulled the turkey out and finished cooking everything else and had to "slightly" reheat the bird due to it setting out too long.....  I thought I really messed things up.
If it wasn't for the brine I think it would have been a disaster.  The bird was still moist and turned out pretty good despite the mishap.  It would have been much better had I kept an eye on it as well as the temp.  There is no doubt it would have been much better.
So the moral of the story is to brine for sure, use a thermometer (digital) and keep watch over the oven and the cargo inside.  The brine definitely cooks the turkey a bit faster.  My target temp was 160 degrees but over shot that a bit I'd say.

I've used this recipe three times now and love it! I passed it on to my mom and sister-in-law and they both use it now! I was reading the negative comments and I believe you honestly either had a bad turkey or didn't follow the directions properly because I have everyone rave about my turkey since I started making it like this! I stuff my turkey and make gravy out of the drippings and it is all amazing!!!

I have used this brine mulitple times and each time my turkey/chicken came out perfectly.  I also used the suggestion made to use apple cider instead of water.  How do I describe the gravy, WOW - there  isn't another word that I can come up with that says it better.  I have had friends asked me to make extra gravy.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone said that it was the best turkey they ever had. I let it brine for 2 nights. I also made my own vegetable broth using celery, carrots, and onions since I didn't have any in the pantry. The gravy was great too!. Super flavorful.

I have only made about two turkeys, the first was just buttered, I preferred this way more. Usually I find turkey dry, but this yielded a juicy turkey. I will make this again. Only downside was I had to spend like nearly 15 dollars on the ingredients, not including the turkey and I had to buy a food grade bucket, another $15. But the bucket has come in handy for other recipes.

Great turkey brine!  This was plenty of liquid for a 13 pound turkey that we had.  The only thing I did differently was instead of wasting good stock, I mainly used bouillon cubes and heated a small bowl in the microwave to get a concentrated solution of broth and mixed it in with the water.  I didn't see the need of heating it all up, everything dissolved perfectly.  Since I had a small bowl of water and bouillon heated up already, I added the dried herbs in the bowl of hot water to help their flavors to release before dumping all together.  This is such a great brine.  It really helps to make a nice juicy turkey!  My mom used this recipe for the first time to brine her turkey this past thanksgiving and everyone raved about it being the juiciest turkey they ever had.  Thanks for this great brine!  I will use again when making turkey!

I cut this recipe down to use on a chicken and substituted apple juice for some of the broth. The sugar in the juice gave it a beautiful brown color. Loved the flavor the seasonings added to the bird, and the gravy was extremely rich and flavorful.

Used this brine recipe for Thanksgiving this year. I had never brined a turkey before and I have to say that brining makes for the juiciest, most flavorful turkey I have ever made. Whether I roast my turkey or smoke it, I will never make turkey again without brining it first! The only changes I made (based on some of the reviewer's comments) was to use half broth and half apple cider. The addition of the apple cider added that little extra flavor that complemented the turkey just right. Will use this recipe again, I'm sure of it!

First time brining our bird and it was absolutely amazing.  So moist and tasty!  We won't go back to 'regular' turkey ever again!  We weren't quite able to brine for 1hr/lbs  We brined our 17lb bird for about 13 hours and it was still amazing!  Thanks for the great recipe :)

I made my first Thanksgiving turkey with this brine.  When I removed the turkey to the plater all the meat fell off the bone. It was absolutely the best turkey I ever had (sorry Grandma).  For gravy, I put all the drippings in a sauce pan and slowly added corn starch until it reached a consistency I was happy with. Again the best I ever had.  Thank you for the recipe.

to make life easier, I used a small portion of the broth, and all the dry ingredients, combined in a small saucepan, brought to a boil, then mixed with additional broth. Made creating concentrate to add to the liquid much quicker to bring to a boil and to cool, then combined, much faster than bringing a gallon of liquid to a boil. Just faster, which at holiday time, I appreciate all shortcuts that don't affect quality! Thanks for the recipe!

I've tried several brine packages and none have come out as good as this. I forgot to buy vegetable broth so I added carrots, onions and celery seed (also forgot the celery) to one gallon of water, the spices (I didn't measure just dumped and/or cut large branches from my plants)and salt. Boiled for a few minutes until veggies were tender then followed directions. Brined 14+ lb turkey for about 18 hrs and then followed parchment baking instructions from marthastewart.com. This is by far the BEST turkey I have ever made and one of the best that I have ever had.

I had to make some substitutes but it turn out okay. My family didn't seem to notice a bif different because they said that the breast was still dry. Maybe will try to foil the breast next time.

This was a pretty good one! I just made a whole turkey breast instead of the whole bird (which we never eat the dark meat anyway) and it was tender and yummy...

SOOOOOO good, what a difference on the taste of a turkey!!! Always will use a brine for now on when I make a turkey, no other way!! BUT just be aware I had a 25lb turkey and I started to cook it at 10am and it was done by 1:30 so it cooks alot faster.

used a 22 pound turkey. It was very moist as I too cooked it upside down. I should have doubled the spices as I could not really taste them

Could not stop eating the chicken and I overcooked by some time! I changed this recipe to a third of what it was for a chicken. I used approx. three teaspoons of poultry seasoning because that is what I had on hand plus the savory as that wasn't listed in the poultry seasoning ingredients. I used a roasting bag to brine the chicken in. I put the water in the bag and put it in the freezer for a few hours to get icy. You may want to put it in a container before putting in the freezer. Before putting in the fridge, I put the bag in a stock pot and displaced some of the liquid using a cup so that the chicken was completely covered. It turned out to be very delicious!

Oh. My. Goodness.  This was my first-ever thanksgiving turkey and it was a huge hit!  The turkey was so succulent and juicy and delicious I almost cried!  I think the veggie broth is the key here.  I've never had such delicious turkey.  The white meat was so juicy, it was unbelievable.  Rave reviews from everyone around the table.  Even stayed juicy when we went back for seconds.  The drippings made great gravy, but no one even needed it, the turkey was so amazing all on its own!  Dee-lish.    ONE bit of advice though: don't wait too late in the day to make your brine, or you will be up till midnight waiting for it to cool off!  We even put the pot outside in the freezing cold, and it still took forever to cool.  Live and learn!

I do not usually take the time to do reviews on here, although I use the site quite frequently.  I have to say that this recipe is an absolute must have!  I used this on my first attempted Thanksgiving turkey breast.  I had no idea what I was doing and ran across this recipe.  I used unsalted Vegetable stock to make sure that the turkey did not turn out too salty.  I could not find savory in the grocery store so I just added a little extra rosemary.  After brining the turkey for almost 24 hours, I just removed the turkey, patted it dry with a paper towel and brushed vegetable oil all over.   Cooked at 325 in the oven.  I debated whether not to use a roasting bag in the oven but decided not to.  I did use a roasting bag to put the turkey and brine into though.  It turned out so perfectly I was almost embarrassed!  I was afraid that my mother-in-law would think I was just "showing off"!  She raved about that turkey for hours after we ate.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  You made me look like a pro on my very first turkey!

I followed the recipe exactly.  The Turkey was Super moist & looked like it belonged in a magazine.  I did not notice a big difference in taste & the texture was a little strange for my liking.   My bother-in-law ate the turkey the following day & stated it was the best turkey he has ever tasted.  I'm giving 4 stars because of the texture....  I will give it another try.

OMG! Where have you been all this time! First bite and I almost fell out of my chair! Awesome recipe!! If you really want the full flavor, let your poultry (I did turkey legs and wings) sit in the brine for 24 hrs and then bake in the oven on 350 for 2hrs and you got some good eating! I am going to definately make this again and again!

This was great, the only thing I will change next time is to add less salt, it made the gravy very salty, but the turkey meat was outstanding.  I made a 22 lber so I doubled the batch and it covered the whole bird.

This turned out real nice, but wasn't enough of a difference to warrant the extra preparation I couple of days ahead of time. I went back to my old preparation the morning of. Old habits die hard.

This is my new turkey recipe! I use it every year now! Get rave reviews. I do cut back on the salt. I also cook this 1 day before. I carve my turkey and put it in broth in a pan (9x13). I have 17-20 people every year, and all I have to do with the turkey before dinner is put the pan in the oven to heat. It is moist and delish. The drippings make the BEST gravy! I take all the drippings and refigerate them. The oils harden on the top. I use that to make a roux to thicken the rest of the drippings. The gravey really is just the drippings, a little broth, and the roux to thicken. (I also strain it) Again, RAVE reviews! Try it it is really the best! -Thanks for this!

I've been cooking turkeys for thanksgiving for 20 years.  This was the first time I used a brine and I would never cook it without brining ever again.  I cooked a bone-in turkey breast, which is notorious for being dry.  Everyone commented on how juicy it was.  Very little effort for such a great result.  I brined the breast in a cooler with ice for the required amount of water- which melted and kept the bird cool so I didn't need to keep it in the fridge.  I'm sure you could do it with a whole turkey and a larger cooler.  Try this!

I think this improved the flavor but the comments were " Mom its not any juicer than your regular turkey" so I guess that the extra effort and work of brining it really didn't make a differance in the turkey.  I most likely will not do again...

I rated this a 4 but I will never brine again! I had a 22lb bird doubled the recipe but could not find a pot big enough. Turkey did cook faster. But it was a lot of work, and no one noticed a difference. Thanks anyway.

I dismembered the turkey as one would a chicken, and used only half the brine. Then baked the turkey in a roaster. Turned out very good.

Tasted awesome and the house smelled so good while it was baking.  I also added a ton of garlic and sliced onion to my brine. I just used all water and threw in several chicken bullion cubes to make up the broth part of the recipe. Soooo good and moist!

I may have done something wrong here.. but it didn't seem to change the flavour/texture of the turkey at all..  The turkey was good- but not much different than any other turkey I've ever made.  It was more hassle than it was worth for me.

Excellent!!  I roasted my turkey breast down using the Emilie Barnes method--the bird literally fell apart; the best bird yet!  I had to brine my 24 pounder in the roaster oven, since the poultry bag (both of them!) ripped apart (talk about messy).  I put the insert to the roaster oven on the garage floor (temps in the 20's), covered it well and let it brine; flipped it once, halfway through the brining time.  Turkey never tastes the same after it's been brined!  This recipe's a definite keeper.

I was a little hesitant with regard to the vegetable broth.  But let me tell you, I will NEVER use another recipe.  I made my first turkey EVER on Thanksgiving (I'm 36 yrs old!) and we used the same recipe again on Christmas Day.  Wouldn't change a thing!  I left it in a huge stock pot overnight in the frige in the garage.  Brought it in, drained it, did NOT pat it dry, stuffed it with a chopped onion and smothered it with butter under the skin and on the outside.  The juicy turkey I've EVER eaten and boy was it delicious.  I'm so far from being a chef but I was a hero on this one.  VERY easy to prepare and definitely worth trying.  You'll never use another!  :)

This made one excellent turkey!  I cut the vegetable broth in half and used one bottle of white wine instead.  I also added plenty of garlic.  Very good recipe!

Great brine... I used a "brine bag" which was just a huge ziplock. Made a wonderful turkey. It does make it cook about 30-45 min faster on a smoker.

Oh my goodness! I fixed this for Thanksgiving. Got rave reviews from all at our table. I substituted 1/2 of veggie stock with apple juice and cut back on the salt to 2/3C. because the turkey was a Norbest. I soaked it in the brine for approx. 10 hrs for a 14lb. bird. My search for a great Turkey receipe has finally ended. Thanks.

I love this recipe and technique. I over cooked the turkey by almost 20 minutes and the bird was still very moist and tender. This year I can hardly wait to see what a brined and properly cooked turkey is like.

This turned out AMAZING.  It was a bit of work to find a bucket big enough to hold the brine and turkey, but we managed and it was well worth it.  Our turkey turned out PERFECT.  It was extremely moist-my husband who never eats white meat was eating it-so was my dad.  It was the most juicy bird we've ever had.  I can't imagine ever doing another one without this!

great recipe! I'm only giving it 4 stars because I didn't necessarily taste the spices throughout the meat. Although it was VERY moist it almost seemed like the spices didn't do TOO much to it. I will definitely use again though! Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was my first time making a turkey and I decided on this recipe after looking at it for almost a year. I used this along with another recipe on the site and OMG this was the best turkey I ever had. It was so juicy, even the white meat which tends to be dry. Everyone raved over it. I will use this recipe from now on.

My turkey  turned out perfectly.  I was worried it would be too salty based on what others have said, but it was not at all.  Everyone kept asking how I prepared the turkey.  My brother who is an "unofficial" food critic actually said it was the best turkey he has ever had.  Note:  I soaked the turkey outside overnight in a cooler (when adding liquid, be sure to push down on turkey in solution to get an accurate gauge if you have enough liquid to cover, as the turkey will float in salt water-hold down with heavy object for full immersion overnight)  I then followed roasting instructions from :"Homestyle Turkey, the Michigander Way"(the one with vegetable broth).  I included all the salt from the roasting instructions, but, still, the turkey was not too salty.  It was PERFECT!

This turkey recipe was delicious. It was my first official Thanksgiving dinner and my first turkey that I ever brined. 

I had many compliments. However, adding to the recipe about what temperature to bake it at and what temperature the turkey should be when completly cooked are important suggestions that would have aided in my baking. These notes were missing and for rookies like myself, it would have been helpful.

Fantastic! Made it exactly as the recipe called for with an 18lb bird.  This was the first time I've brined a turkey, and it came out super moist and tender.  So much better than any injectable marinaide!     Instead of putting it in the fridge overnight, I sealed it in a stock pot and set it outside (25c here last night).  Roasted the  turkey in a 325 oven until the internal temp was 180, basting it every 45 minutes; came to about 4 hours in total.  While my plan is to use the turkey for sandwhiches and soup this week, I wouldn't hesitate to put the whole bird on my thanksgiving table.

great recipe. i brine for two days,( i use a 5 gallon or a 10 gallon water jug used for drinking water on construction sites) one night uncovered in roaster rack and pan in the refrigerator, then cook next day. put 1/2 inch water in pan and cook at 350 F. cook for one to two hours breast side down. this makes for awesome dark meat. then flip bird breast up and finish baking. no meat left behind! degrease the drippings for the best gravy. let turkey rest 30 minutes before carving to restore moisture.

Awesome! Used it to make a turkey breast this Thanksgiving.  I used vegtable broth and apple juice, it turned out excellent. Best turkey I ever made. I buttered the breast above and below the skin before baking and tenteted last half hour or so. I did cut back on the salt to about half of what the recipe called for.

I've never care for the turkey on thanksgiving because it's so dry and plain no matter what seasoning I've used. I would always just go for the ham every thanksgiving since it's more flavorful, but last year I decided to brine my turkey using this recipe and all I can say is "OMG!!!!". The turkey turned out super, SUPER juicy and FAB!! I didn't even care for the ham that year.
Here's what I did, I couldn't find any gallon vegetable broth so I used plain water(it was still great & juicy!!). I omitted the dried sage & savory, since I never have these 2 ingredients on hand. This year, I am doing the same thing again! Love it! Thank you for such a great recipe!!

Great flavors! I used my boyfriend's beer breweing bucket, worked great. The only thing I did differently was exclude savory because I couldn't find any and instead of veggie stalk I used a wine and herbs stock. I thought that added even more flavor. Also, I cooked the turkey breast side down for 3/4 of the time. Great results! Never had such moist breast meat.

Tried this for the first time, absolutely awesome. I even used a cheap supermarket bird that's been the freezer for a year. I also did what others suggested and used apple juice/stock, 50/50 mix. One of the best birds ever. Thanks for sharing.

I used this recipe to brine my Thanksgiving turkey and I will never cook another turkey without brining it again! I normally buy a fresh turkey but this year I purchased an inexpensive frozen turkey because I was feeding a large crowd and the sale price was too good to pass up. Since the turkey was 25 pounds, I brined it in a large food safe plastic bag and placed it in a cooler with ice.  I actually brined my turkey for 24 hours since it was such a large turkey.  Without a doubt, this was the best Thanksgiving turkey that I have ever cooked!  It was so tender and juicy and everyone complimented on how wonderfully flavorful it was.  This is a must use brine recipe!

I used a combination of chicken broth and apple juice and didn't use savory because I didn't have any.  I also didn't use as much salt.  Once cooked, the turkey drippings were the base for an awesome gravy.  This will be my brining recipe from now on.

BEST TURKEY EVER!This Christmas was my first time trying a turkey with a brine! My family has done nothing but rave about it! The gravy really was to die for! One small change that i made was that instead of dried herbs i used fresh. Soooooooo yummy! My family and i will be using this recipe from now on!

I made my first turkey on thanksgiving and it was amazing! I used the reviews of previous cooks and used regular salt instead of sea salt and used about 3/4 of a cup. It worked out great! The turkey was juicy and full of flavor! Definitely recommend using this brine recipe!

This was great! my turkey turned out perfect due to this brine! by the way...this was my first year making Thanksgiving at my house, by myself.
But regardless it was wonderful! Don't be afraid that the bird will be too salty, it won't! I brined my turkey for about 12 hours and it was perfect, when that carving knife went in for the first cut there was juice coming out, oozing out..of my turkey!!! And there was my satisfaction :) wouldn't have happened if not for the brining. Thank you!!

I'm a beginner cook.  1st time cooking for family.  1st recipe that I used from AllRecipes.COM. I shopped at the last minute and couldn't find a fresh turkey so I purchased two 6-7 pound roasting chickens.  This was without question the moisted bird I have ever cooked.  Wife complained it was too bland but the rest of my family really enjoyed.  I look forward to using this recipe on a turkey as it called for.

Brining works great, this is a fantastic recipe.  We brine and serve 3 turkeys at Thanksgiving, each with a different recipe.  This one hit our top 10.  We found a great container this year that made brining really easy.  It's called The Briner, you can find it on line.  It worked really well, trapping the birds below the brine surface. And we didn't use a heavy bowl to weigh it down!  I recommend this piece of food equipment to anyone who enjoys bringing, it's a must have!

I used this brine for my turkey this Thanksgiving.  This was the first time I had ever brined a turkey before.  What a difference!  My bird was juicy, flavorful and gorgeous.  After rinsing and drying off the turkey, all I did was pour melted butter, sprinkle salt and pepper and pop in the oven.  Tented for first half, uncovered last half.  I had tons of drippings which made the most delicious gravy.  I will never bake a turkey without brining first again.

First time brining a turkey and was a little nervous.  Followed this recipe exactly and the turkey was the best we've ever had.  I got so many compliments on it.  The white meat was so juicy and my turkey took 2 hours less time to cook.  I couldn't believe it!  All the great reviews were justified.  When I tasted the gravy I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.  I eneded up brining it in the same black speckled ware roasting pan I cooked it in.  Will never cook a turkey again without brining it.  Can't wait to brine a chicken next!

Outstanding. We followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. We used a stuffing bag to stuff the cavity with another outstanding recipe, Stacy Polcyn's "Awesome Sausage, Apple and Cranberry Stuffing". We cooked the 17 pound bird in a cooking bag for 3 1/2 hours (checking with an instant read thermometer every so often). The meat literally feel off the bone, and not one piece was dry! This is the best combination turkey-stuffing recipe we have ever had on Thanksgiving!

Amazing! I did butcher the recipe because I THOUGHT it said 1 gallon of chicken broth not vegetable broth. With that said, I accidently made 1 gallon of "Chicken Stock" for this recipe, used 2 cups of salt, and used 3T of each herb using fresh herbs. Also, I started to brine the fully frozen 16.55 lb turkey Monday afternoon. My bucket wasn't big enough so the turkey brined 12 hours side up and 12 hours side down until Wednesday night (48 hours total). Wednesday night, I discarded the turkey brine, thoroughly rinsed, dried with paper towels, covered with aluminum foil, and left it in the fridge until Thursday 12pm. Then, I continued cooking 325 degrees for 4 hours in a brown paper bag using "Perfect Turkey" ingredients. Super moist and not over seasoned even with the 2 cups of salt and fresh herbs. A definite keeper and will be my go to turkey brine recipe!

Ok so this was my very first time cooking Thanksgiving dinner and I was super nervous as the turkey process grosses me out!!! BUT I will do this recipe for every Thanksgiving from now on. We did our dinner last night and I will admit getting the turkey ready for cooking was a little difficult I can not fit a 5g bucket in my fridge on a good day let alone Thanksgiving day; so we did a cooler. For the mixture I did 1/2g Veggie broth and 1/2gallon of apple juice and the Brine mixture. Then placed the into a turkey plastic bag and put in the cooler with ice around it for about 15 hours and then cooked the turkey in the plastic bag(made for Turkeys) my boyfriend and his family said it was the best turkey they EVER HAD!!! I was pretty impressed with myself since it was the first time cooking a turkey. Its a long processes if your not a cook like me but worth it!!!!!! You can even buy already made brine mix. Everyone should do the turkey this way.

It just wasn't worth all the work and hassle. Baking a turkey in an oven bag is easier and tastes better. I wanted to try the brine method, but I would not do it again!

It was my first go at brining a turkey (or even cooking on!) and I used this recipe and instructions. I ended up using fresh and much more herbs than called for here and it turned out delicious.

This will be my third Thanksgiving using this brine. The turkey turned out moist and flavorful, and the gravy was delicious.  Best brine ever!
I make my own vegetable broth.

This was the first time using a brine and I regret not using it before. Another relative brought a deep pit turkey and it lost its moisture once it cooled down mine on the other hand was moist, juicy and full of flavor warm or cooled. This recipe will for always remain as a part of my turkey cooking process

I WILL NEVER DO THANKSGIVING TURKEY ANY OTHER WAY!!  Everyone raved about how good my turkey was this year!  I did use 1 gallon apple juice with the 1 gallon vegatable broth, but kept everything else the same.  I share any turkey leftovers with my mom and mother-in-law and my leftovers were still just as moist and delicious 3 days later!  Next year, I'm getting a bigger turkey (mine was 14lb this year) so I have more leftovers to enjoy.

So, so, so good!  The white meat on this turkey may have been more moist than the dark meat.  I don't like white meat, but that is all I ate off this turkey.  I put my turkey in the brine on Tues morning, and it was not thawed until Thurs morning.  Just make sure if you have a big bird, and a fridge that things are slow to thaw in, that you give your turkey several days to thaw.  I cooked my turkey uncovered on 325 for about 4 hours.

Will use this brine for every turkey and or chicken from here on out. Used this recipe for Thanksgiving 2010 and my bird was not only moist and every bite flavorful but it looked pictured perfect. The most beautiful and best tasting bird ever. I added some pepper corns and a couple of bay leaves.  Thank you for sharing!

Wow!  Fork-tender flavor-permeated turkey for Thanksgiving.  I brined it (10 lb.) in my cleaned-out sink from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m., adding ice to keep it at a cool temp.  This is a keeper/pass along recipe.  Thank you, Sheri.

I tried brining for the first time, and only had leftovers for one lunch meal.  My 13 yr old daughter declared it the best turkey she ever had in her whole life. I have to agree - it was so juicy and tasty, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I'm planning to do a turkey breast next time.

I made this for our family for Christmas dinner. Everyone who ate this turkey was amazed, and said it was the best turkey they ever had! It was flavorful and very moist. The leftovers were still very moist a few days later!! I will definitely make this again; I don’t think I would roast a turkey any other way now!! I did find the gravy a bit on the salty side, but put a raw potato in to soak up the extra salt, and it was fine.

THIS IS A Winner! I used this recipe for my first christmas turkey and it was a big hit! People who never eat turkey even loved it. I omitted the savory (I have no clue what it is) and used poulty seasoning. I also used half the vegetable broth and added apple juice.

This was my first brining attempt. My 20 lb. turkey was so tender and moist. I never received so many compliments before. The only con with this recipe is that there won't be any leftovers!

The brine was okay, but nothing that left us very impressed.  It really didn't do as much for the moistness of our turkey as I thought it would, and my turkey came out about as moist as it has in the past when I haven't used any brine.  The gravy was very tasty, though, and as other reviewers said, the drippings were key for a wonderful gravy!  I may try it again, if for nothing else than the tasty gravy that results.

I am not sure if it was this bring as I have never brined my turkey before, or if we had a bad bird, but our turkey did not taste good.  I have never had a bad bird from this specialty butcher before, so I am going to blame the brine.  It was not good and we paid $85.00 for the bird. Pretty disappointing.

THANK YOU SO MUCH - I thought I made the mistake of brining a kosher turkey, I was so worried that it was gonna be too salty but it was SO MOIST AND JUICY! I did not boil the brine though, I just stirred everything together AND I added a bottle of WHITE WINE. My 13 lb turkey was perfectly cooked in about 2 hours...roasted it for 45 min at 350, another 30 at 400 and flipped it over breast side up at 400 for 45 min and it was perfectly juicy & moist.

I brined a basic frozen Butterball and it was moist and not too salty.  First, I made my own vegetable broth, and did not add any salt to it.  A canned broth will already have a significant level of sodium,  I also cut down on the salt, and used about 2/3 cup.  I used fresh thyme and some dried rosemary, and added some apple cider.  The turkey came out very juicy and flavorful, and the gravy was also perfect with no added salt.

I followed this recipe to the letter,the only exception being I brined it for 24 hours and it could have brined longer. I put it in a Ziploc XL storage bag Tuesday night at 9pm and I drained the brine Wednesday night before Thanksgiving because I thought it might be too salty. I cooked it Thursday morning and my 12 lb. turkey was done in 2 1/2 hours in the roaster oven. It was delicious but I would brine it longer next time. 36-48 hours would not be too long at all, it wasn't overly salty in the least bit.

This is really good to brine a chicken.  I omit the orange and I add 2-3 TB of liquid smoke to the water.  It's fantastic and the bird only gets better after it's cooked.  Thanks for  such a good basic starting point.

I used this recipe to cook my very first turkey last year, for my family.  My father-in-law who is a very good cook and cooks the turkey for Thanksgiving Dinner said that it was the best flavored turkey he had ever had!  Unfortunately since this was the first turkey I'd cooked, I overcooked it and it was dry (to their standards) but it was still VERY good.  The gravy was a little saltier than I'm used to, but had very good flavor.

Superb!  I followed the recipe exactly the first time.  The turkey was delicious and very moist!    Modifications we have tried:   ---Add 1 tablespoon juniper berries.   ---Add zest from one orange, 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1 teaspoon juniper berries.   ---Use chicken broth and double the rosemary, and add lemon zest.   ----Add 1 teaspoon dried lavendar.   ----Add 2 teaspoons garlic powder, 1 teaspoon peppercorns and zest from one lemon.  Each of these combinations was wonderful.  The amount of salt and water seems to be perfect to push the moisture and flavors into the meat.    I have used this brine for turkey, chicken and pork, and have found it to be easy and delicious each time.

We've used this brine on our Thanksgiving turkey for the last two years and it is fantastic. We store it in the garage over night since it's cold enough and we never have room in the fridge at the holidays. We grill our turkey and it is the absolute best we've had.

This reciped is so awesome! this is our second year using it. this time i used fresh herbs and apple juice as suggested by others and found it to be so aromatic. then we rosted it according to recipe: Homestyle turkey, the Michigander way, also found on this site. when we started carving, it was almost laughable because everyone was oohing and awing over all the juices and i couldn't keep people's fingers off the bird. i later found my sister in law going to town eating the carcass! she said she just couldn't help herself! i was definitely the talk of the town!! thanks allrecipes!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I never made a turkey before and was very apprehensive.  However, brining it made it so extremely juicy and tasty. Instead of using vegetable stock, I used chicken stock. I also added a shot of tequila to the brine and I think it added some extra flavor.

Completely awesome. Made as shown. Soaked 14 hours. Definitely wash off the brine if you are going to make gravy! 
Used it with a free range turkey breast. None left!

I've never been a white meat lover, but I've switched. This was THE best breast I've ever tasted and it was from a frozen turkey. Simple to make. Let time do the work. I brined this one 15 hours for a 15 lb whole turkey.  Next year, I plan to buy the biggest breast I can find and brine only that. It took only 2 hrs and 20 minutes to cook and the skin was perfectly browned and crisp with no added butter or salt to the turkey.  I only added a light sprinkling of freshly ground black pepper.

This is the first time I tried brined a Turkey and it came out great.  Also if you are going to stuff the turkey I would cut down on the stuffing seasoning.  It came out a little salty for me but I don't like alot of salt, no one else complained about stuffing being saltly.  Thanks for sharing.

I was very excited about making my turkey with this brine because of all the reviews. I followed the recipe, except that I used chicken broth rather than vegetable broth. I also used 1/4 cup less sea salt since I ran out. I roasted the turkey (20 lb) in a bag with lemon, celery, onion and carrot stuffed in the cavity and around the bird. We oiled the outside with olive oil and pats of butter under the skin on the breast. We roasted the turkey in a convection oven for about 3.25 hours - until the temp of the thigh was 180. About an hour later when we carved the turkey for dinner, the meat was a little dry. The flavor was wonderful, but the white meat was dryer than when we just roast in a bag only. I don't think I did anything wrong and I understand the theory of brining, but it didn't work for us. It was a lot of extra work for the little difference we saw. Roasting in a bag has always worked for us and we'll stick to that. Thank you.

I had a HUGE turkey to cook on Thanksgiving (22 lbs.!!!) so I doubled the dry ingredients  in  the recipe. However, I took a cue from another reviewer and added 1 gallon of Apple Juice instead of the ice water. I also added all my apple peels from 4 Granny Smith and 2 MacIntosh apples from a pie I made. I did dump about 2 pounds (by measure) of ice into the holding container after I poured in the cool liquids.
I stuffed the Turkey with Rosemary, Sage,Thyme and 2 cut Lemons.

Instead of ice water, I used ice and put the covered bucket outside overnight. Everything else I followed the recipe and it turned out perfect. My mom, who had never heard of brining a turkey before, was amazed at the great taste!

This rocks!  I'll never do turkey any other way again.  Did an 8 pound breast and halved the recipe.  Substituted white wine for part of the water and used fresh herbs.  Even the leftovers that were frozen were spectacular the second time around.  I used homemade chicken stock and didn't find there was any problem with it being too salty.

I also doubled recipe & used 1 gal apple juice & 1 gal veggie broth that I made myself. (simmered onions, celery, & carrots that I then strained off) gound spices from a spice store were awesome.  I cooked two 22 # turkeys & the gravy is wonderful but I made sure to seperate off the fat. I did not think it was too salty. I also poured brine into 2 trash bags that I put turkeys in breast side down in a cooler with ice packed around for overnight.

This is a very nice brine recipe. It's the second I've tried. Stuffed my turkey with 5 apples sliced for flavoring the breast (cooked breast side down until ready for browning) and it came out great.

This was a great way to prepare a turkey. I used my sons 5 gallon stainless steel brew pot that he uses when he makes beer.It was just the right size for my 18 pound turkey.
The turkey came out moist and had a great flavor. This is the way I am going to continue to do it from now on.

I usually don't like turkey,  I was cooking it for my family of 33 people.  It was very moist.  But instead of buying all the herbs that I will only use very occasionally, I used Mrs. Dash.  Very good.  This year I will make my own vegetable broth, I spent over $10 in broth.  I will use this recipe again.
Thanks

I love this recipe. This is the second turkey I've make in 10 years. The first one was so dry and horrible that it turned me off to turkey for years. This recipe was easy, and delicious. The gravy was to die for and the bones made a fantastic broth (I froze). I used someone's idea to stuff the cavity with butter coated carrots, onion, celery and fresh sage in a butter soaked cheesecloth. Yum... We made turkey taquitos the next day and the turkey did not dry out in the frying process. I will make this recipe again!

I wanted to use this recipe to brine my turkey.  Brining is a new concept to me.  So, I bought my fourteen cans of vegetable broth...but didn't have a five-gallon container, and if I did have one, would not have the room in the refrigerator.  What is that they say about 'plan ahead'.  Oh, well.  UPDATE:  Thanksgiving 2007:  This year I did use this recipe to brine my turkey.  My review is mixed...also my firt year using a thermometer.  The turkey tested at 180 degrees...but my turkey-roasting experience tells me that it would have been better if roasted a little longer.  So I can't really review the recipe with all the other variables involved.  My gravy was very salty, and after trying to add enough liquid to compensate for the saltiness, didn't have a good, rich, roast turkey flavor.

Great idea for a brine.  I made the vegie stock out of vegie bouillon cubes and omitted the salt altogether. I used fresh rosemary, dry sage, fresh thyme and omitted the savory as I didn't have any.  I added fresh garlic, onions, and an orange cut in half.  I kept the turkey in the bine for 48 hours and then stuffed the turkey with the spices, onions, garlic and orange from the brine.  I also infused the turkey with sage and garlic butter.  I always put sage butter in between the skin and the turkey breast cover the turkey in olive oil and season the outside with salt, pepper, sage, garlic and poultry seasoning and cooked the turkey in a bag. It was moist and flavorful.  The gravy was wonderfully seasoned. I will use this brine again!

This was easier than I thought.  I 1 and a half times the recipe for a 19 pound turkey. I double garbage bagged the turkey and put the brine with it and kept it in a cooler in the garage..stayed cold and there was no clean up.  The turkey stayed moist but there weren't many dripping to make gravy out of.  I just had to add some chicken stock.  What drippings there were made for a bit salty gravy.  But no one seemed to mind, as the turkey was so great!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I also found the perfect bucket to fit both the turkey and the refrigerator. I used an oval shapped bucket that I bought cat litter in. Of course I cleaned it thouroughly but it sure looked funny putting that bucket in my refrigerator! I used 1/2 apple juice as suggested by others. I also turned the oven up to 500 for the first 30 minutes. But that was a little too long at that heat because the skin turned black on top. I tented it with foil and cooked it for the remaining time at 350. My 19 lb turkey took about 3 1/2 hours. It was the best turkey I have ever made. I will most definately do it this way again.

This was my second time at making a turkey, and I'm giving this three stars because my turkey did turn out very moist and tasty, but it wasn't any better than my Mom's turkey's and she doesn't soak her's in brine.  So, I'm not sure if the brine helped or not.

Have been using this for a few years. Perfectly delicious moist turkey every time. I always buy the cheap store variety of turkey and this makes the best! The first lesson I learned was sea salt is NOT table salt. Really good!

GREAT smoked, cut the salt in half.

We have used this receipt for 3  years and have found it to be the best "standard" turkey brine out there.  It is far better than the orange or apple based brine or any brown sugar based brine (full disclosure i may add apple juice this time).  I do my self, and recommend you cut the salt in half.  The first time i used the brine and the recommended amount of salt, it was almost too salty.

Additionally i smoke the turkey after the brining process.  If you have never tried this, trust me it's easy and there is a lot of help online.   I smoke the neck and giblets and use this for the base of my gravy by boiling for an hour or so before pulling the turkey.  I use a drop in blender to blend one smoked giblet into the gravy.  I cant tell you how much flavor this adds to your gravy.   (Im now hungry after writing this)

I've used this brine for several years now.  I go a little heavier on the sage and the thyme but otherwise, I follow it exactly and the turkey is always incredibly juicy and well-flavored.  Thanks!

Best turkey I've ever had! Very moist and flavorful (was not  salty at all). The family loved it. I followed the recipe exactly. I couldn't find savory in any of grocery stores but McCormick has a recipe online (link below) for a savory spice and I just happened to have all the spices in my  cupboard. Will definitely be making again. My turkey was 16lbs.

I used this brine last year and it was wonderful.  This year I will double/triple the added spices, and try using 1/2 apple cider with the vegetable broth.  It helps make a very moist and especially flavorful turkey.

Have used this brine for the past 2 years for our Thanksgiving turkeys and I'll never go back to just tossing a bird in the oven again.  Simple recipe, deliciously moist bird... would give more than 5 stars if possible!  Thanks for sharing!!

This was mine and my boyfriend's first attempt at brining and WOW! It came out beautifully. We're all a dark meat family and found we all ate more white meat since it was so juicy and flavorful. We cook some stuffing inside the bird and it was AMAZING, too. Unfortunately the only ingredient  we couldn't find here in central Texas was savory but it was still perfect. I highly recommend trying this. I'm looking forward to brining a chicken some time soon now.

I have used this brine  for the past 3 years  as written and have shared it with friends because it makes such a difference. After brining I use a turkey bag to bake it in, cutting open the top for the last hour. The bag reserves all the juices and drippings and reduces the cooking time by almost an hour on a large (23 lbs) bird.

Suggestion:  Bags can tear, so I brine my larger turkeys (20+ pounds) in my canner.  it's cold out (January), so I just screw the lid onto the canner and place it on my balcony.   We're on the 14th floor, so the only critters I worry about are the house finches :-)

I followed another reviewers advice and did half of the ingredients on this recipe and half of the citrus brine recipe on this site. It was the BEST turkey I have ever tasted. I cooked it in a oven bag and when done I took it out of oven, left it in bag and left it rest for at least 20 minutes. DELISH!

I made this for this year's Xmas and all the guests loved it! The preparation was easy and it was not a problem getting the ingredients. I put the bird overnight in a 3 gallon bucket due to little storage place in the fridge, and around midnight I turned it upside down so the other side could brine. I cooked it for more than 2.20 hrs. (Around 4 hrs. ) checking on it continously. I will be repeating this recipe for sure.

This was my first time cooking a turkey,and did so, on Christmas under the watchful eye of seasoned turkey cookers of my mother and mother in law. I NAILED it with this brine and the "perfect" turkey recipe also on this site. (note the perfect turkey recipe has a brine mixture I didn't follow, I just picked up at the cooking process)
First, My turkey was 16lbs. We made the recipe according to plan but I hesitated and added only 3/4 cup of salt and used fresh rosemary and thyme because I had it. I used an extra tetra pack of veg broth as well just to cover the bird. I  made the brine and let it sit for a couple hours to reach room temp then we placed everything into a Coleman Cooler and topped it with 3 ziploc bags of ice. It stayed outside on the patio and remained between 2-4 degrees for almost 24 hours.

After brining, i rinsed it well, placed it in the roasted and continued on with the "perfect turkey"recipe. 

This turkey was so moist and delicious. I am incredibly happy and will never not brine a turkey again.

Because I use a bag to cook my turkey and the box comes with two bags, I used the extra bag for the brine and placed it in the bottom drawer of my fridge. When it was time to cook, I moved the turkey to the other bag for cooking.

This made the best turkey I have ever had! The only change I made was substituting the vegetable broth for beef broth because I didn't have any.  I used a 19 lb turkey and baked it at 350 for 3 1/2 hours.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I followed the suggestion of half apple juice-half vegetable broth. I use the unsalted vegetable broth. This will be my third or fourth year using this recipe. I stuff the inside of the turkey with slices of apples, oranges, celery and onion prior to cooking. Makes for a beautiful and very flavorful bird!

This is a great brine! I added 2 lemons and 2 oranges cut into 1/8 pieces, squeezed and dropped in with all the other ingredients. I've used this brine for the past 3 years! I also wash out a large cooler to brine the turkey in and stay away from plastic bags. Another great tip, if I may, is to cook the turkey breast side down for at least the first 1-2 hours. I know it's unconventional but the gravity sends the juices right to the breats when it's breast down to start!!

I have been cooking turkeys for years and for the first time I made this brine and soaked the 20 pound turkey in it for about 12 hours. Everyone raved about the moistness of the turkey. I will definitely use it again for cooking my turkey or any other meat I wish to have come out juicy. My girlfriend also marinates her pork loin roasts in a brine like this. She said they also come out juicy. not dry like before.

This resulted in the most delicious, moist, wonderful Thanksgiving turkey I’ve ever made in my near 30 years of roasting turkeys.  Even the breast meat melted in our mouths!  I also use this brine for the whole chickens I get from our CSA.  I brine the chickens before I put them in the freezer.  Makes even pastured free range hens come out incredibly moist, tender and flavorful.  The faster cooking time is definitely a bonus!

I used this brine in conjunction with Chef John's Roast Turkey & Gravy recipe.  The bird cooked perfectly, looked spectacular and gave rave reviews all around from the 17 guests we had!  Most of the guests even commented that it was the "best turkey they ever had!"  This was the first time I brined a turkey and it will definitely not be the last!

This was truly incredible. Did half stock half apple juice, 2 cups sea salt and lots of fresh sage, rosemary, and thyme. Brined for over 24 hours. I was shocked. Amazing!

Awesome recipe! I do not have savory available in my location, so I just omit and it still comes out yummy.  I added a lemon just because. I halved the recipe for a 7lb turkey breast -  Helpful hint:   added a 1/2 gallon pitcher of ice instead of waiting to come to room temp. Then add 1/2 gallon of water. Saves several hours.

This brine worked so well! My turkey was so juicy!! Only complaint: The drippings were so salty, I couldn't use them to make gravy it was that salty, so I'm glad I had picked up a packet to make gravy, cause "scratch" gravy wasn't happening. But I will for sure use this brine again!

Brining is a great way to cook a turkey.   My nephew hates turkey but he loves mine and asks for seconds.   It's juicier than deep frying and more flavorful.    Great recipe!

I didn't have Savory, but it was excellent anyway.  I put my 13.75 lbs Turkey in a roaster at 325 degrees before Church Easter Sunday.  Two hours later when we returned it was done.  Also, I did throw it in a 425 degree oven for 15 minutes just to brown the skin.  I'm going to do all my turkeys this way.  So easy and delicious.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year and had never brined a turkey before.  I cooked the turkey using the easy crockpot recipe (w/dried onion soup).   Both birds were delicious.  After reading previous reviews, I realized I hadn't saved the brine broth for the gravy.  Duh!  I'll try that next time.  Anyway, five stars for this one!

This was the first time I've brined a turkey & I'll never make another without this step!  This recipe was foolproof.  I had to use my cooler since I didn't have room in my fridge.  I'm following this recipe again for Christmas.  It must be good, my MIL actually raved about it! lol

Great brine.  I needed a little more, so I followed others suggestions and added some cider.  I will make it exactly the same way again!  I put a turkey bag in a bowl, poured in brine, placed the turkey in it, and tied the bag up.  Then I placed the bag with the turkey in a cooler of ice and water and I left it about 24 hours.  We rinsed it well, and then stuffed it and baked it.  I will ALWAYS use this brine for turkeys.

Delicious flavor. Tender & juicy. 
Note that "Broth" and "Bouillon" are NOT the same thing. Bouillon's first ingredient is SALT. Broth is simply the flavored water that is strained off after cooking vegetables or poultry. If anyone is worried about brine being too salty, you may reduce the amount of sea salt by the amount of 'bouillon' that is used. (tsp for tsp)It is not too salty if you adjust the seasonings this way.

I have used this brine recipe for the past 3 Thanksgiving dinners and have had rave reviews every year.  I love that the turkey ALWAYS turns out moist and yummy ... and I don't have to baste.  Makes for phenomenal gravy ... and lots of compliments!  Thanks for sharing!

I used this brine for our thanksgiving turkey.  My mom liked it so much that she insisted we make another turkey for her birthday two weeks later.  I am now the official thanksgiving chef of the family for the rest of my life because everyone loved this turkey so much.

Simple and great with precise instructions.  This is the second time I've used this brine and it's safe to say I will use it again and again.

I had never brined a turkey, but decided to give it a try this Thanksgiving. Best cooking decision I have ever made! Not only was it easy, but that was the best turkey I have ever made. My family is still talking about it and now want me to make one for Christmas! Other reviews talk about how great the gravy tastes and they weren't lying! Use this recipe with confidence!

Used this for our turkey and will be using it for a chicken as well.  The gravy was amazing and the meat was the best we have ever had.  There were no left-overs this year!

We made some minor modifications, or major I guess :)  We did kosher salt rub, 3 cans chicken broth, used a turkey baking bag for overnight.  The next morning we patted dry, bathed in butter.  This is by far one of the yummiest turkeys ever, but warning: my 17 lb turkey cooked in 2.5 hours!  One hour faster then it was suppose to, not sure why but I thought I'd share.

Turkey definitely came out moister than roasting without it! I did not want to purchase that much veggie broth so I skipped that part and it was fine.  Onion and celery were added to turkey before placing in oven bag and was great!

This made for the best bird I have made ever!! I left the bird in the brine for two days and cut back on the salt. However, I agree that the drippings made a for a very salty gravy. That aside, the bird was moist, very juicy and tasty. Will be brining every year from now on.

Wow!  This was a fabulous way to make turkey.  I used coarse kosher salt and added unsweetened apple juice.  Just right!  I put the bird in a doubled turkey-sized bag and placed it in a cooler outside to work its magic.  And did it...I'd never make another turkey without a brine.  And yes...the gravy was delish.  Roasting time was amazing.  My 22 pounder was up to temp in under 4 hours.

EXCELLENT FLAVOR! My first time brining a turkey and it came out tender, juicy, and flavorful. I also followed other reviewers suggestions and used 1/2 veg broth and 1/2 apple juice. Before cooking I added 2 celery stalks, 1 onion, 1 lime, 1 lemon, and herbs. My 17 lb bird cooked in 3.5 hours.

Fabulous!   This was my first attempt at brining.  I took the advise of another reviewer and used 1/2 stock and 1/2 apple juice.  I also made some herb butter using cold butter, sage and rosembary to push up under skin prior to cooking.  The breast was so tender it was easily cut with a fork.  Will use again and agian.

I kind of want to rate this a four, but because it did exactly what the recipe said it would, I will rate it a five.  My turkey was very moist, and my gravy was to die for (and it was my first time ever making gravy).  My turkey just didn't have a lot of flavor, it simply tasted like turkey.  I had hoped the spices (I doubled them) would add some flavor.  I didn't brine for the full time, because Paula Dean says you should never brine a bird for more than 10 hours, because it changes the texture of the bird and makes it very mushy.  Maybe I will do it once, just to see if it does.

I used this for my Xmas turkey today.  I was skeptical that this could make the turkey better than the other birds I made.  This blew it away!  I can't believe I didn't know to do this before. It was my first Xmas with the inlaws and I was hosting.  Everyone loved the turkey.  You could even taste the seasonings in the meat.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Your turkey will make others' jealous!

I used this brine for our Thanksgiving Turkey and it was the best turkey I ever made.  The white meat was so moist and flavorful.  I had rave reviews from everyone.  This is going to be a traditional step to any turkey I make.

I used this brine on my thanksgiving turkey this year and it was simply fantastic. It was my turn to cook the holiday bird this year and I wasn't optomistic about it at all. It had been my experience that turkey always came out dry, so I was on a mission to fix that. I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out to be the best turkey EVER!! I'm now in charge of the turkey every year. Thanks All Recipes!

We did this recipe this thanksgiving and we were so happy with it. I did however do as some others suggested and use half the broth and then used other half apple juice. Only did that cause I need lower sodium. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

EVERYONE (18 people) at our Thanksgiving dinner raved about the turkey after I used this brining recipe!I've tried other brining recipes before but they made the turkey too salty.  This was perfection, moist flavorful...I'll never make another turkey without it.

The turkey tasted great.  Not salty at all like some of the reviews say.  I added garlic to mine.  Although I did read that the turkey cooks faster when brined this was not true for me.  Great recipe!!

My first time brining a turkey and I will never cook  another without using this recipe.  It was the best ever and got raves on how good and tender it was.  My brother-in-law loves turkey skin and he couldn't get enough.

I used this for my BIRTHDAY TURKEY on November 27th! Could not find VEGETABLE BROTH so substituted with CHICKEN BROTH.  Way good! Best bird I have ever baked. For the actual BRINING PROCESS I used a PLAYMATE COOLER...tight fit-but got a 20 pound Tom inside!  Thanks for pOSTING this---well worth the long wait and little effort.

I will never cook a turkey without brining first what a magor diffenence this made. This was the first brine I have ever made it was easy and very tasty. I added peppercorns bay leaf and white wine 1/2 cup sugar and used only 1/2 gallon water my stock was unsalted wanted to be sure the salt water ratio was right. Turkey was 16lbs cooked on 500 for 30min then 350 for 2 1/2 hours. It was the most Moist tender juicy flavorfull bird I have ever made!

After reading the rave reviews, I headed out for a 5 gal bucket and brined our turkey.  It was the best turkey I have ever cooked and the gravy was incredible!  This is the ONLY way to do a Thanksgiving turkey.  I lined the bucket with one of those bags you use to cook the turkey in and twist tied it closed while the turkey brined in our garage overnight.  Thanks for the outstanding recipe!

We used this brine for our turkey and the meat was literally falling off the bone after cooking. My husband said he thought it was the best turkey that he'd ever had. We didn't have a 5 gallon bucket so we had to soak everything in a sealed turkey bag, which was pretty scary...next year we'll buy a bucket :)

Just served this turkey for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone concluded it was the best ever! So moist and tender it melted in your mouth.   I doubled the recipe for my 23# turkey and followed it precisely except cut the salt in half. I used all fresh herbs. I did not stuff the turkey this year (a first), but put the remaining herbs in the cavity. The only other difference - I cooked the turkey for 3-1/2 hours on 325F covered in foil; then 1 hour at 350F (until the meat thermometer reached 180 degrees); then 1/2 hour without foil to brown.   Excellent!!! Can't see ever using another recipe!

I will never again make a turkey without using this brining recipe!  It's delicious; moist, perfectly browned and cooks faster than a turkey that isn't brined at all.  Yummy!

You have to try this recipe! My husband is not a big fan of turkey unless it is fried so consequently I have never made one. But I was determined to make one for Christmas this year and heard about brining from a friend. I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and did half vegetable broth and half apple juice. I also put a celery stalk, carrot and onion in the cavity as suggested by VACookie and baked it the was they suggested. It was wonderful!

Excellent recipe for brining turkey (or chicken for that matter).  I used 4 cups of chicken broth and topped up with water in place of the vegetable broth - but left all the other ingredients the same.  The end result was deliciously moist Christmas turkey which I grilled on the BBQ.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I will NOT make a turkey ANY OTHER WAY!  This brine makes for an exceptionally flavorful, moist turkey.  The meat stays moist for days which is perfect for those post-Thanksgiving sandwiches.

I'm a believer! I read all the fab reviews and decided to try it myself. It came out great! My entire family complemented the taste and moistness of the turkey. I will definitiely use this over and over for my turkey and I would highly recommend. By the way, I read one review that said the recipe could be a little salty so I used low sodium vegetable broth and it came out very well.

I've learned that the brine method is the only way to go the past few years- and this simple recipe was wonderful.  Had a hard time finding savory- but it was worth it...   Also, I used 50% apple juice as a substitute for vegetable broth like others had recommended.   Then, used the "Perfect Turkey" recipe on this site by Shelly White.  Only made two changes. I covered my 12 pound turkey for the first 90 minutes.  Took foil off and roasted to 150 degrees...  Flipped turkey and cooked uncovered til 180 degrees.  My total cooking time was about 2.5 hours (the brine process REALLY speeds up the cooking, so watch your bird carefully!!!). And, I poured 2 cups of apple juice over the turkey instead of the 1 cup of wine. Best turkey ever.

For Thanksgiving, I combined this recipe with another I found in a Grilling Recipe book and added 1 cup maple syrup and 1 cup cider.  Once cooled, my 13.5 lb. turkey was then brined in this solution for 24 hrs.  I then rubbed herbed butter under the skin and placed the turkey in a roasting pan. After smoke/grilling for 4 hrs. (temp ranged between 200-250 degrees & I used a meat thermometer) over coals & soaked apple wood chips, the result was the best tasting and juiciest turkey I've ever had.  I plan to cook another turkey this way for Christmas.

Used low sodium broth----what a great brine recipe!  I used a bag inside of a cooler with ice in a cold garage overnight and made sure I rinsed the bird well since I am not a big fan of salt....was absolutely not too salty!  I also added whole peppercorns to the mix.

My Step Dad told me this was the best turkey he had ever eaten. He doesn't give comments like that out very often. I changed thins up just a little. I used half vegetable broth and half apple juice. I also added some garlic which I'm a big fan of.  I'll use this one again. I plan to give it a try with chicken and cornish game hens too.

The turkey came out very moist, but salty.  Think the lower-cost grocery store frozen turkeys already have salt in them.  Plan to brine again, but I'll read the turkey package more carefully next time!  Stuffing was very moist (all that liquid in the turkey I guess) -- I prefer stuffing a little drier, but others raved about it

This brine worked like a charm.  I used a fresh young turkey, Butterball brand and the meat was moist and tasty.  We used an 18lb turkey and I lowered the salt to 3/4 cup, however 1 cup would have been just fine.

This was the first time I ever brined a turkey and it came out great!  I followed the recipe as shown omitting savory because I didn't have any and couldn't find any.  I let it sit in a huge bag in the ice chest overnight.  The whole house smelled fantastic when it was cooking and both my husband and son said it was the best turkey I've ever made.  Will definitely use this again.

To the lady below that asked about the Butterball... I have done several fresh Butterball turkeys in a brine and they come out great. I wouldn't go over 1 1/2 days in the brine though. Some brines will go as long as 3 days... stick to 24-28 hrs. you should be fine!!!

Wonderful! I will make this time and again. I only had an eight pound turkey breast so I cut the recipe in half. I did add a full half cup of honey to the brine. We smoked the breast and it was a beautiful golden color and the texture and taste was so good. Thanks!

Amazing! I wanted to brine one boneless skinless chicken breast, so I cut this down to one serving and followed the recipe. After 24 hours, I pulled it out to cook it and although the internal temp almost reached 190(I wasn't paying attention) it was still completely juicy and flavorful! I will use this every time I want a juicy piece of meat. The flavor was so good I didn't need to add any seasoning. Oh, I diced up the chicken, layered it on top of box stuffing, topped it with mashed potatoes and turkey gravy and it was a little Thanksgiving bowl of goodness. In July. :) I highly recommend this anyway you end up using your chicken!

At first I thought, "Really. What's the big deal? How good can it be!?!" Well, it really IS a big deal. It was soooo moist. My family went CRAZY over this! I will never make turkey any other way!!! Even my husband, who doesn't say much, raved about it!

I've been brining my turkeys for 6 years now, but thought I'd try a new brine recipe for a change. This is turns out a perfect bird! I did use fresh herbs, but omitted the savory. Also placed fresh whole carrots, celery, parsley, thyme, rosemary and sage in cavity before roasting. Excellent flavor, very juicy and tender!

IT'S A HIT!  I used this for my 2008 Thanksgiving.  It was my first time cooking  a Holiday dinner.  Though I used a turkey breast-I used this brine, topping it off with a half-gallon of apple cider.  The turkey breast was a dream-it got rave reviews.  Yes-I will use it again.

I wanted to love this...but, for all the work of finding a container big enough, etc, etc, it just didn't seem to make a difference in my turkey.  I saw several instances of tv cooks using a brine in this year's Thanksgiving turkey recipes, so thought I'd give it a try.   My turkey was good... moist and delicious. I just thought it tasted as good... moist and delicious as every other year that I've just cooked in a cooking bag. My dad mentioned (after) that most frozen turkeys are already brined... I didn't check, so maybe that was my case.  At any rate, for the hassle of it, I doubt I'll brine a turkey or chicken ever again...

I followed the advice of others and cut the salt in half, and this worked great.  My icemaker isn't working so I only added really cold water instead of ice water.  I put it in a cooler as someone else suggested (being the only thing large enough to fit the bird.) and put that in the fridge.  I brined it for 24 hours before cooking.  My turkey was fully cooked in only 2 hours when it should have taken almost 3!  Not sure if the brining make it cook faster or the roasting pan I used.  As a result my bird didn't get as brown as I would have liked, because I didn't want to overcook it.  But it tasted great and was not at all dry.  I will never make a turkey without brining it again.

This was my first thanksgiving with a family of my own and cooking by myself. Let me just say I blew all of my more experienced relatives out of the water with this method! So juicy and so delicious! Even the white meat was juicy and I used to hate the white meat every year because it was always so dry. Everyone wants me to cook the turkeys from now on! Thank you so much for this recipe! NO LEFTOVERS!

This was the first time I'd used a brine.It will be the ONLY way I cook a turkey. The best bird my father ever ate!! The only thing I did different was use 4 tbsp of poultry seasoning instead of the 4 different ones listed. Gravy was excellent. Thanks so much for sharing this recipes!!

This was absolutely the most fantastic turkey I have EVER had.  I've been cooking the bird for 10 years now and this year everyone absolutely raved over it.  I did do half broth and half apple juice though.  I cooked a 24 pound bird for 18 people and there wasn't a morsel of the meat left.  The entire bird was picked absolutely clean.  Everyone wanted to know my secret!  You made me look like a star!!

The turkey was delicous without any dry spots! One hint I did want to give...I used a cooler (you know the kind used for picnics) It solves the refrigeration problem.  If that doesn't work use a rubbermaid tote!

"The best white meat I've ever had," according to my brother. Very moist and flavorful. I roasted two 15-pound turkeys for Thanksgiving this year (big family!). The one done in my (gas) oven was perfect in about three hours, while the one in my sister's (electric) oven was a little over-done in the same time (but still tasty) -- use a good thermometer. So delicious, my other sister even tried to take the credit!

next time I will add more salt, I brined it for 18 hours and it was not salty just plain turkey meat.... I did add three cloves of garlic and fresh tyme, so the turkey smelled good I would add 2 cups of salt instead of one or brine it for 2 days.

This made my turkey juicier than I thought possible.  Great taste to the meat.  Gravy was really salty-I diluted with extra chicken broth.

BRINED A 14.5 LB BUTTERBALL OVERNIGHT &DID NOT CHANGE ANYTHING.  TURKEY WHITE MEAT WAS MOIST AND DELICIOUS WITH A GOOD FLAVOR. WILL DEFINITELY USE AGAIN.  HOWEVER, I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE GRAVY.  I DID NOT HAVE ANY DRIPPINGS TO MAKE THE GRAVY!  IS THIS THE WAY IT IS?  LUCKY FOR ME THAT I WAS COURIOUS ABOUT THE "MAKE-AHEAD TURKEY GRAVY" AND MADE IT USING THE 3 TURKEY LEG THAT I HAD ON HAND.  THIS, MY FRIENDS, SAVED MY LIFE!  THANKS TO SUE1956 AND SHERI GAILEY FOR MAKING OUR THANKSGIVING ESPECIALLY DELICIOUS.  PEGGY

I have brined before, but every year I stress all night while it is brining...just a worry about how the turkey will take to it. This year I used this recipe and my fiance could NOT believe how moist the turkey was. He thought I was crazy when I started brining the night before, he had never even heard of it....my turkey was done 2 hours before we were supposed to eat and when we cut into it it was WONDERFUL.  All I did was cover it in butter, and place butter under the skin and bake at 330.  Didn't have to do anything else.  The flavor and moist factor were perfect.

Yes, it was slightly more moist than it might have been without the brining, but it didn't change the flavor of the meat much if it all. I was so excited to give this a try, but I'm not sure it was really worth the extra work.

This recipe was out of this world!  I have only made the Thanksgiving turkey two other times in my life, and they never turned out this good.  We had a hard time fitting a 5-gallon bucket in the fridge, so we simply put it in the car overnight since the temp. was in the upper 20's and lower 30's.  Our 12lb. bird was done in a little over 3 hrs and it made some of the best gravy I've ever had.  Thanks for this one - it's a keeper.

This was my first time brining, and now I will always do it.  So worth the extra step, the breast meat was so tender and juicy you could cut it with the side of your fork!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was excellent.  I bought two extra turkeys on sale in December and had the butcher saw them in half.  I used a quarter of the recipe in a two gallon freezer bag with the 8 lb thawed half.  I refrigerated it for 24 hours, turning it 3 times.  I roasted it breast down and turned the heat up flipped it until it was crispy brown.  It was moist and delicious.  Mine did NOT cook faster than normal as some others have noted.  It's a mystery.

Awesome!  Usually when it's just my husband and I, we just make 2 turkey legs but with family coming I needed to make a whole turkey.  I had visions of dry turkey dancing in my head and decided to try this and it was great!  Super easy and the white meat was super moist.  Thanks!

I made my Christmas Day turkey this way. Everyone enjoyed it. The turkey was moist and had just the right ammount of flavor for me. I made Turkey Noodle Soup with the leftovers yesterday using Elaine Bickford's recipe from this site. Both were delicious!

I used this brine to cook my first Thanksgiving turkey this year.  I didn't use the savory because the store was out of it - but the turkey turned out fantastic!  I got rave reviews - not sure if it was because it was my first turkey or they really liked it, but I'm willing to bet a million bucks it's because they really liked it!  Super moist and juicy!

Oh my goodness! I didn't realize my mother's turkey has alwats been so dry! My husband was the one roasting the turkey this year and I have never tasted one that was so moist, flavorful, and completely incredible. I know it sounds like I'm being silly, but nothing but the truth has been stated!! Most highly reccomend!!

I followed the recipe and added apple juice and garlic.  I had to use a bucket and covered it with ice overnight.  The turkey was great!!!  BUT, I dont think I would go to the same trouble again.

Absolutely delicious!  I used fresh herbs; boiled along with the vegetables to make stock.  I used my roaster (which makes basting so much easier).  Next time I will roast breast-side down.  Lots of drippings for the most delicious gravy ever!  I will never roast another turkey without this brine.

I was a bit dissapointed with the results. While the turkey did turn out to be great, it was really not much different from the results I have without brine. Maybe I just rinsed it too well?? The only thing different was that the stock did make an excellent gravy.

Pros: JUICY, delicious... no leftovers

Cons: Every one thought I bought the turkey...no leftovers :(

I had never brined a turkey before, so it was a bit of an adventure.  Lots of lifting a heavy bird in gallons of liquid and serious fuss when we had a heat wave and needed to overnight the turkey, brine in all, in the fridge.  Was it worth it?  Oh, yes.   This brine made the turkey a juicy, flavorful bird to rival any other in Thanksgiving memory.   I also like that it has the basics--good salt to liquid ration with thoughtful step-step instructions--but leaves a lot of room for future experimentation with wine, fruit juice and different spices.   I will make some version of this recipe for years to come.

THIS WAS AN ABSOLUTE HIT. THE TURKEY WAS MOIST AND JUICY. MY 4YR OLD ASKED ME IF I COULD MAKE THE TURKEY LIKE THIS AGAIN NEXT YEAR. I DID SUBSTITUTE WHITE WINE FOR SOME OF THE COLD WATER. GRAVY FROM THE DRIPPINGS ALSO TURNED OUT GREAT AND FULL OF FLAVOR. THANK YOU!

I made a vegetable stock with a gallon of water and chunky vegetables.  I cut up potatoes, celery, onions, carrots, and cauliflower.  I boiled them in the water with the salt and spices.  Our turkey was juicy and tender.

Ok like I am a super star in my family now.  Everybody loved it.  The white meat was gone before the dark meat.  That is unheard of.  The white meat was extremely juicy and flavorful.  This was sooooo easy.  By the way I didnt have veggie broth so I justed 2 1/2 large cans of chicken broth.  I also didnt have very much sea salt but I figured since the broth is salty anyways it would be ok.  So yeah this recipe rocks and anytime I ever make turkey this will be the way I prep the turkey.  I cooked it using the Safeway 2 hour turkey method.

Turkey was very tender & juicy.  Beware that the drippings are very salty...take into account when making your gravy.

I followed this recipe exactly for Thanksgiving and the turkey came out ok.  Despite all the rave reviews I thought it was alot of work for the end result.  It was not better than our locally raised turkeys from Plainville farms that we get fresh every year. I guess we're just spoiled! They use no hormones or antibiotics.  They're delicious the way they are.  No brining needed!

I used chicken stock instead of veggie and beefed up the amount of spices for my big bird. The turkey turned out great. I used the Rosemary Roasted Turkey recipe on this site.

I made a very rich, homemade vegetable broth, cut the salt in half (for fear of it being too salty...which it wasn't but I did remember to rinse the brine off the bird before smoking it)  & added a bottle of apple juice. Put it all in a huge pot that fit right down inside our roll-around cooler, which we kept out in our garage. Poifect! ;o) The turkey was very tasty but general consensus was that the fryed turkey had more flavor & was juicier.

Second year to do this...sans the savoury. Moist and delicious...
Used a gallon of apple juice with homemade vegetable broth. I also used regular salt. Left it outside for 14 hrs. soaking in a huge bucket.
Will do this every year!

I had very high expectations for the turkey after reading all of the reviews.  I don't know if we overcooked our turkey or what (it was the first we ever made), but we thought the taste was just about equal to every other turkey we had.  I would probably try something different next time.

I veered away from my usual brine recipe & used this one. My Turkey wasn't as moist it usually is. The flavor of the brine was great though. I am stuck in the middle with this one.

This made my first Thanksgiving away from home a huge success! I used chicken broth instead of veggie, added a cup of splenda, and left out the sage and savory. The turkey was wonderfully tender and juicy, even better than my Mom's! (but don't tell her I said that...)

one of the best ways that I have found to get a flavorful, moist turkey without having to parboil it. Especially good for a large, mine was 15.5 pounds, bird that gets brined at low temperatures.

This was awesome.  What more can I say, not a dish I'll make all the time cause hubby has to watch salt intake.  But it makes for a very moist juicy bird, and our guest loved it.

This was my first year brining a turkey and it turned out fabulous. I did use half vegetable broth and half apple cider instead of just vegetable broth. The meat was just so tender and carving had never been easier. Everyone raved about how juicy the turkey was and I was already begged to do the same turkey for Christmas dinner too!

A good overnight brine and cooking to the right temperature with a probe are keys to an outstanding turkey. This brine is very good and as simple as most. I added an 1/2 cup of sugar and then I used 1/2 gallon of unsweetened apple juice. Everyone who ate this baked turkey said it was the best they ever ate.

I used this for a turkey breast for Chrismtas dinner.  I will never prepare turkey any other way from now on.  This was wonderful.  The meat was so juicy and tender, and above all, very flavorful.  You will not be disappointed using this brine.

AWESOME - and very forgiving! Just did a turkey breast, left it in the oven too long and it was STILL moist, tender and delicious - also didn't have Savory and gravy was great too which is very unexpected when only roasting the breast

Made no changes except that I only soaked turkey for about 12 hours.  Made a delicious turkey and I will definitely do this from now on.

This was exceptional both times I used it.  The turkey was moist and FULL of flavor!  The drippings made for a gravy that was as good as Mom's.

This was my first time EVER making a turkey. I scoured the internet for brining recipes and most of called for either brown sugar or apple juice. I don’t care for sweet meat, I prefer savory, so I was super excited to find this recipe. I read the reviews and followed several tips. 

First off, my turkey was 23 lbs. I used fresh herbs (excluding savory as I had no idea what that was). I used the entire gallon of veggie broth, but cut the salt back to 3/4 cup. I added in 2 largely chopped sweet onions, peppercorns, 9 cloves of garlic, and the gallon of ice water. I let the turkey marinate in a large bucket I’m the fridge for 24 hours.

To cook it, I preheated the oven to 325 degrees, started the turkey off breast down. After two hours, I flipped the turkey and cooked for another hour. By then it had reached an internal temp of 180 degrees (it only needs to be 165, but the turkey was still super juicy even with slightly over cooking). I then cranked up the heat to 400 degrees, basted the turkey with butter, and cooked another 15 minutes. It turned out perfectly Golden. The turkey was so flavorful and moist!! I’m not a turkey fan, but this was delicious!! My entire family loved it, including my super picky eaters!! 

This recipe is an absolute repeat!!! I might even try it on chicken for regular weeknight dinners. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!

This is the best brine recipe we have ever used. We use a 5 gallon brine bucket for our 24 lb turkey. We make sure the cavity of the turkey is filled and the breast meat is well covered because not all of the liquid fits. We have used the recipe now for 3 years and the turkey is never dried out and the meat is extremely flavorful.

I’ve made this a few times now and the family loves it. It works great as is, but I’ve also added a whole lemon and two tablespoons of whole peppercorns to the brine.

Have been making this brine for years! I love it! Juiciest yummiest turkey ever. Will never not brine my turkey! The only thing I do different is add sliced oranges to the brine, otherwise it by itself is still amazing!

This is a great recipe as the proportions are correct.  So, I start here every year.  Most Helpful hint:  For the salt, 1 cup of sea salt (or table salt) is equal to 1 1/4 cups of Morten's Kosher OR 3/4 cup of Diamond Crystal Kosher.  In addition to the stated herbs, I add a T of Whole Peppercorns and a T of Allspice Berries.  Sometimes I swap out 3 times the herbs fresh instead of dried.  2019 version also had some leek tops and parsley stems.  Basically, use up those trimmed vege bits and throw them into the brine pot too :)

My husband and I use this recipe for brining smoked turkey breast.  We brine the 8 to 10 pound breast for about 8 hours in a bowl in the refrigerator.  Then he puts it on the grill to smoke.  Sometimes he uses fruits tree chips to increase the smoke flavor.  Our family raves!  They are moist and flavorful.  Everything a turkey breast should be!

Have used this recipe for the past few years. We did a taste test last year and made one turkey unbrined and the other brined and the brined turkey was the clear winner. I recommend and use the suggestion to add 1/2 gallon of apple juice. 5 stars.

Delicious, but adjust the salt. Used on a 12-pound turkey, placed in a scrubbed-out cooler overnight. Even after rinsing the brine prior to cooking, the meat was quite salty, although delicious and juicy. Will try again for the actual holiday using either no salt, or getting low-sodium broth. The comment about cooking faster held true: I used a baking bag for the turkey, and rubbed the skin with butter prior to placing in the bag. The turkey registered 300 degrees after 2.5 hours, so my guess is a 12-pound, brined turkey actually takes about 2 hours when using a bag to cook.

I have made roasted turkeys, deep fried turkeys, and my favorite, smoked turkeys. There are endless ways for a turkey to be prepared.
With that said, this brine will be one more addition to my turkey arsenal.
This time I oven roasted it, but I'm thinking next time I might try a little apple smoke...

If you cook the bird right, this brine is perfect. Savory and juicy results. I have had trouble finding the perfect amount of brine. The grocery store either has containers that have way too much or too little in too many cans.

I’ve used this recipe twice so far. Once on a really expensive turkey from the butcher shop and once on a cheap generic turkey on clearance after the holiday.  In both cases the turkey came out amazing and extremely well flavored and moist.  Now I will brine my turkey’s with this recipe every time.

This is the best brine ever!  The first time I made the turkey for my extended family, our usual carver for the family bird said that he had never seen the meat so tender and juicy.  The meat fell off of the bone.  I quickly became the turkey cook for the Thanksgiving Day celebration.  I've been using this recipe for T-day and X-mas for a couple of years and everyone loves it!  The meat is juicy and flavorful!

This was fantastic! This turkey squirts when you slice it, that’s how juicy it is. I use a thermometer and don’t overlook it and let it rest at least 30 min. Super flavorful.i have made this the last 5 years and my husband says no other turkey is as good as yours! ( this one )

I had a 13.5 lb. turkey and I left it to brine for about 48 hrs. Next time I would add another day or two for brining because the deeper meat on the breast didn’t have enough flavor but for the most part the flavor I got was AMAZING! It was juicy and so yummy. I think I’d also try roasting longer at a lower temp because the legs and wings could have been a little more tender. But overall the flavor was to die for!!

If you don’t have a pot or bag use a clean 5 gallon bucket. Chicken broth works just as well.

This was a great herb combination, although I used fresh herbs from my garden. I wanted to give the brine a little more character, so I also added lemon juice, honey and sugar to the brine as well as peppercorns. I roasted the turkey breast on a rack and poured chicken stock in the pan. The gravy from the pan juices was spectacular.

I had to substitute a few things as this was a last minute recipe grab.  I used kosher salt instead of sea salt.  I used dried rosemary thyme and sage.  I also added a liter of ginger ale to sweeten the brine. I bribed it partially frozen from Tuesday to Thursday morning. I roasted it with an apple in the cavity and there were literally no drippings in the pan. We were able to cut through the Turkey with a plastic fork! So good!

This was a GREAT turkey brine!!! Quick context: I made this brine for a turkey that I was preparing FOR MY IN-LAWS!!!!! So you could imagine the pressure. Anyway, it turned out FABULOUS!!! The family loved it and better yet, the gravy from the turkey drippings was packed with flavor.

So many things can go wrong with a turkey... undercooking, burned skin, overcooking dry. This brine doesn’t prevent any cooking errors. What this brine does is make the turkey moist, moist, moist. Like, I didn’t realize turkey could turn out this moist. I used a frozen cheap 14 lb turkey and soaked in brine for about 15hrs. This was by far the best turkey I have ever made, including rotisserie which was good. I achieved this by nailing the cook time, using herb butter, and covering with foil at the right time to protect my skin; however, none of that produces moisture and all credit goes to this brine. I am definitely a believer in brines now and can’t wait to try this with rotisserie chicken and turkey!

When I saw the recipe uses herbs I had to try it. I had a 21 pounder. I made it on Tuesday, roasted in on Wednesday using the foil method, after 3-1/2 hours it was done!  Let it cooled completely, sliced it, wrapped it in foil and kept it the refrigerator till Thanksgiving Day. Reheated the packages in a 350 degree oven.  It was the most delicious turkey I ever made!  A definite hit at our home.

This was easy and helped the turkey cook faster (14 minutes/pound). I will definitely do this again next year! I did follow the suggestion of 1/2 vegetable broth and 1/2 apple juice. I used unsalted butter flavored with fresh sage and rosemary  (from How to Roast a Turkey recipe on this site) and black pepper when coating the turkey skin before roasting. Plenty of salt in the brine, as others have said, so no need to add anymore salt when baking.

I'm not a big fan of turkey, but make it for family for Thanksgiving.  I had heard of brining and how much of a difference it makes, but I was skeptical.  WOW...what a huge difference it did make!  It made me a fan of turkey!  Even the white meat was moist!  I had a 13.5 lb turkey and brined it in the bucket that our electric ice cream maker uses.  It was the perfect size.  I then baked the turkey in an old fashioned turkey roaster, part-time with the lid on (until it reached about 140 degrees) and then the rest of the time with the lid off to brown the skin.  THANK YOU SO MUCH for making me a believer!

Great recipe! My turkey turned out very moist. The white meat really surprised me how moist and juicy it was. The gravy I made from the drippings was delicious. This was the best turkey I have ever cooked. The vegetable stock I used was "Better than Bouillon". I thought the bouillon stock was salty when I made as directed, so I reduced the salt in the recipe from 1 cup to 3/4 cup. The brine flavored thoroughly through all the meat. I wasn't able to find the spice Savory,  so I prepared the brine without it. Maybe it was a blessing not to have the spice Savory, because when I looked up the ingredients in Savory,  some varieties contained nutmeg and cinnamon. These are flavor notes that I would not want my turkey,  and definitely not want my gravy to taste like. My family loved the turkey this Thanksgiving

I liked this brine recipe. Turkey came out flavorful and delicious. I shopped to late for the dried savory and couldn't find it at 3 grocery stores near me. So, I used marjoram to replace it. I dont think my palate is sophisticated enough to notice a difference. But I haven't had this brine with dried savory either.

This is the only turkey recipe I will ever use from now on. I followed the recipe almost exactly as written (only exchanged the dried herbs for fresh) and it was the most tender and flavorful turkey I’ve ever had. It was a hit and everyone raved about it. I can’t wait to make it again on Christmas!

Easy brine, I had to make a little extra as it wasn't quite enough for my 15lb bird.  
I have used this recipe before and the drippings make the gravy absolutely to die for.  I also add a little of the drippings to the stuffing in place of some of the broth.  SO GOOD!

Wow this was the BEST turkey we’ve ever had. We’ve never brined anything, and we really didnt know what we were doing. We tried 3 different containers and finally had to add about 6 cups more water to cover turkey. We were worried the flavor would be diluted. It was very flavorful! We cooked the turkey in an oven bag and it came out moist, perfectly seasoned and made the best stuffing and gravy too. Really great!

This was a great and easy recipe for turkey brine that  kept the turkey moist and gave it great flavor. The only thing I did differently was to add some onion powder.

This turned out great. I have done it a couple of times and the Turkey was delicious. The only tweak I found to make it to my liking was to halve the qty of salt.

Great brine!

I did not have any vegetable broth so I put a gallon of water in a stock pot and added onions, carrots, celery, garlic and a can of tomato paste, brought to a boil and then reduced to a very low boil for an hour - pureed the veggies - added herbs/spices however did not have the Savory used Garam Masala as a sub.  I only added about 2 cups of cold water and about 3-4 cups of orange juice to cover the bird in the large stock pot - I let the turkey brine close to 48 hrs in the garage (New Years day).  I stuffed the bird with quartered onion, carrot, celery, green apple and 3 cloves of garlic.

Note: in the video I seem to remember they showed rinsing the turkey but the instructions did not state this - I rinsed my turkey as other reviews stated possibly too salty. 

The meat was juicy and flavourful through out the bird.

This turned out wonderfully. My tip which works like a charm is to use an extra large cooler to brine in. I make the brine, add the bird and cover with two to three bags of ice. Keeps it cool and is large enough to house it. Might have to add something to make sure the bird is kept completely submerged.

I made a few changes.  I use a very high quality vegetable base, a gallon of apple juice and tangelos along with Kosher salt.  Boiled it, cooled it down and then I put my turkey into my chest cooler.  It's been in there now for about 12 hours; ice still not melted.  When I cook it, I smother the OUTSIDE of the turkey with fresh Rosemary, Basil, Thyme and Sage.  I slow roast and baste it and the house smells divine!  The fresh herbs form a crust on the skin that is unreal....(you baste every 30 minutes)

Delicious brine! Made it for the Thanksgiving Turkey this year and the bird came out amazing. Got a lot of compliments about how juicy and flavorful it was. I am now making the same brine for my Christmas Turkey and I’m sure my company will be making the same comments!

This was the best turkey I've ever made, and I've been making them for more than 50 years.  I love this brine and will continue to always brine my turkeys.  I followed the recipe except I used apple juice and vegetable juice for the liquid.  It's really that good.

This is a winner. Our guests gave the flavor of the turkey a big thumbs' up. No additional seasoning was necessary for the gravy. Only "miss" was that I could not find savory at the last minute anywhere! I can only imagine how much better this will be next year when I buy the savory in advance.

This is the 2nd time I followed recipe as is and was again very impressed with the results.  After brining I added some broth and apple juice to pan and placed this 19# gobbler on smoker at 300 degrees for about three hours.  Super moist and super fantastic.  Many compliments. I won’t hesitate to use again.

Absolutely perfect!!!  You could really taste all the flavors come through in the bird.  Brining did cut the cook time down significantly so gotta watch your thermometer!!

The turkey had great flavor but be careful ours cooked much faster. I’ve read since that brining shortens cooking time. Our 23lb bird cooked in 3:45 at 325deg so just keep an eye on it.

Perfect as is, with others suggestions to cut with apple juice. I needed the boiled mixture to come  to room temp quick so I set the pot in a  cool water bath in my kitchen sink. I bought an Xlarge oven bag to brine in and put that bag with the turkey and the brine In a bucket and tied it shut and kept in fridge for  just about 27 hours.  Also Everyone was wild over the gravy....

Fantastic! This was my first time brining a turkey, and it’s the best turkey we’ve had. I followed the recipe exactly; brined for about 20 hours, then took it out of the brine to dry overnight for a crisper skin. Thanks for a great recipe!

First time to try brine. I halved the recipe because I was using 2 turkey breast. Store was out of  or did not carry savory. But used exact recipe otherwise! I was Fabulous! I will never use my old tried and true method(which was good). This added so much flavor and it was so moist! I highly recommend it!

Ok, this is  long, but I will try to be short
First time brining. Great Recipe! here are my suggestions.
1. If the bird is self basting /injected with soduim, use less salt including choosing No/low sodium broth (I like veggie). I only used a few pinches of kosher salt.
2. The herbs suggested, use fresh; the market has it all in packet for you. I pulled off a few of each and place them in the mixture. use the rest to place in the bird with onion.
3. 1/2 Gal of broth and 1/2 Gal apple juice (balances out the salt I think)
4 (optional).Spatchcock/Butterflied Bird (cut out backbone)
 If you do, Make sure you have a  wide and large enough baking sheet but you sacrifice on the gravy. That didn't go too smooth for me.  you will have a smoky kitchen.
5. Gravy, Full of flavor..I think the fresh herbs was the game changer.

Tasty! Just be careful, as stated the turkey cooks WAY faster than normal! Almost burned my bird using the normal cooking time in a fryer. But even with the bird WAY too hot and really dark, it was moist and delicious inside. Will use this again, just pull the bird earlier and check it's temp frequently...

This was very very good! I usually never follow recipes to the T because we are from New Orleans and of course I think we know better than everyone when it comes to food. But, since I am no expert in turkeys, I decided I needed to follow it step by step to ensure I didn’t mess it up. I brined it for about 18 hours, it was a 13 pound turkey, and it took about 3 hours to cook. I took it out every 45 min to baste with real butter salt free, perfect color. One thing, I did use  marjoram as a substitute for savory because they didn’t have any at the store. I brined in large pot. I did not cover with foil, in case anyone wanted a little more detail!

I’ve made this twice, the first time the turkey was great! The gravy was very salty but I also did not pat dry the turkey after pulling it out of the brine. The second time I made this I made sure to dry the turkey well and the gravy is really good! I also cooked the turkey in a Reynolds bag which with the help of the brine made for a very moist turkey! Seriously the best turkey I have ever had!

Best turkey I've ever had. I omitted the savory (couldn't find it in the supermarket). So incredibly moist and flavorful. You know a turkey's good when the leftovers are gone the very next day.

I bought a cheap frozen 4.5kg turkey from Sainsbury's supermarket in the new year to try this recipe out and I'm amazed with the results. I've brined turkeys before in Christmas flavour spices and they've been good, but this one was the best, transforming a cheap turkey into a triumph. As I'm in the UK, I wasn't sure what was meant by vegetable broth, soup maybe? Anyway, I used Marigold Organic Vegetable bouillon instead, 1/2 cup Maldon sea salt as the bouillon is salty and fresh herbs, I also added 6 cut clementines that were hanging around in the fruit bowl since Christmas. I partially defrosted the turkey, removed the giblets and placed it in a large bucket with all the ingredients then left it in a freezing conservatory for 24 hours to brine.
It cooked at 160 degrees celcius in a fan oven and using a digital meat thermometer, it reached 74degrees celcius in less than 2 1/2 hours, much faster than usual and the aroma was fantastic. The meat was juicy and full of flavour, falling off the bone, but in no way was it dry, AMAZING!!!! If this can transform a cheap frozen turkey, imagine what it could do to a free range bronze turkey. I won't use any other recipe now I've found this one, thank you to the person who shared it.

I added 2 tablespoons of granulated garlic to the brine - next time I'll probably double that, since I LOVE GARLIC, but 2 Tbs works well.

Also, at the end of the post, there is a recommendation to cook food in aluminum foil to preserve moisture, etc.  Recent studies have shown that unhealthy amounts of elemental Aluminum will leach into your food when you do this, so it is now highly un-recommended.

Excellent recipe!  My first time cooking a turkey and It was very moist and perfectly salted.  Word of caution though- using a oven turkey bag to brine the turkey in is a bad idea.  It doesn't support the weight.  1/2 my brine ended up all over my kitchen floor and cabinets making a huge mess.

This was a good starting point for a brine. I brine my bird every year and wanted to see what was out there. I changed it by a 1 Tbsp allspice and adding 1/4 cup orange juice. I also only used half of the thyme and half the salt the recipe called for, since thyme is one of my least favorite seasonings and you don't need that much salt to brine (your not pickling). This was the best bird so far, and I've been brining for 10+ years. I BRINE MY BIRD FOR 48 HOURS... THIS MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN FLAVOR AND MOIST WHITE MEAT.

Turkey turned out tasty and juicy. I only used thyme, rosemary and bay leaves with the salt and stock because that's what I had on hand.  You could probably reduce the salt and get the same taste. Will try that next time.

I brine every year and am always looking for the perfect Turkey Brine Recipe.  Well, this year (2016) I found it!  This recipe is fabulous.  We cook a very large turkey breast each year rather than a whole turkey, as no one in our family likes the dark meat.   I did not put the Savory in the brine because I did not have any and the local grocery store I went to does not carry it.  I will include it next year.   I have 3 perfect containers to brine turkey breasts in, and I have cooked 2 or 3 turkey breasts for Thanksgiving, depending on the size of the crowd each year.  They are  round plastic containers with lids.  The containers are 10" tall and 8.5" in diameter.  The turkey breasts fit in the containers standing on end.  I cut the brine recipe in half due to the size of the container.  Our 10.5 lb. turkey breast and half of the brine recipe filled the container and submerged the turkey breast completely.  I brined for 24 hours, drained the turkey, patted it dry, oiled the skin, sprinkled it with pepper and garlic powder, and roasted it at 325 degrees.   I did not tent the turkey with foil.  As the recipe notes, a brined turkey cooks more quickly than a non-brined turkey.  I used a digital thermometer and took the turkey out of the oven when the thermometer registered about 155-160 degrees (165 degrees is recommended for poultry).   After taking the turkey breast out of the oven, I tented it with foil and let it rest for about 30 minutes.  The temp did come up to 165 degrees

I followed another reviewer 's suggestion to substitute some of the vegetable broth with apple cider.  After brining,  I made a herbed butter using fresh rosemary and thyme and rubbed it all under the skin of the turkey before baking. The turkey turned out fantastic.  So delicious and moist. And the turkey drippings were phenomenal for the gravy. Although the drippings were too salty to use alone, I mixed them with my leftover chicken broth for my gravy. The best gravy I've ever made, hands down.

THANK YOU! The best Turkey among 4 others! My husband texted me later that night when I was shopping Black Friday - he took the time to thank me for the BEST TURKEY EVER!
I followed the recipe except I didn't have SAVORY. 
I didn't add all the water that was suggested, I mostly poured the vegetable broth in the bucket over the turkey and then added water/ice  just enough to cover the turkey-it probably 1/2 gal. 
When cooking the turkey -PLACE BREAST side DOWN 
I used a large electric roasting oven -SECRET FOR JUICY TURKEY - DON'T OPEN THE LID. I had a 18lb turkey. I set cooking temp to 350 for 4 hours. then I opened the lid and tested the temp of the breast. It was at 170, so I turned the temp of the roaster down to 200 and let it "simmer" for about 4 more hours.  THE MEAT FELL OFF THE BONE. When I tried to pick it up the breast and thighs just fell off the bone. It was so awesome, no carving through tuff turkey breast. The secret to the "steaming" the turkey is add 1 carton of chicken/vegetable broth to the bottom of the pan to cook and steam the turkey. (I actually started cooking the turkey at midnight so it was ready for NOON dinner the next day. GOT MANY COMPLIMENTS on the juicy and great taste of the bird.

Bought kosher turkey which supposedly had some salt in it. Washed it and kept in the water for 10-15 minutes. Brine for a day and washed the turkey after. Stuffed with quartered 1 lemon and 2 oranges (second just cut in half) (some reviews suggested also adding sprig of thyme and rosemary and onion-didn't do it though) 1/4 cup of butter put under the skin and on the skin. Cut up some carrots, one parsnip, one onion, some celery and placed it on the bottom of the pan; added 16oz of chicken broth.

Turkey should have the wings tucked under. And the neck folded so no air can come in.

15 pounds (it was almost 16 pounds) roasted in conviction oven for 4 hours.. Covered for 2.5hrs and uncovered for 1.5hr in 325 degrees

Didn't baste except right after removing foil in the middle of cooking

I didn't realize what a difference brining makes to a turkey! Wow!! It's so easy to do and the flavor is just wonderful.  I'll never again roast a turkey without brining.  Thank you for a simple, yet tasty brine recipe.  If you soak the turkey in plain water for half an hour before roasting, the gravy will be fine.  I also cooked the stuffing separately since it's easier to serve it.

My first turkey for this Thanksgiving and I used everything except the savory because I didn't have any and substituted salt listed for regular table salt (although I think I would have preferred that listed but I didn't have any in hand)  I had a small turkey so used less water and I skipped the ice water; otherwise I used the other ingredients as listed, I let it soke up the ingredients over night in frig covered with foil, then poured off the liquids after about 12 hours and pat dry the turkey the next morning and immediately back in frig till the next day to dry out (still covered in foil). Rubbed the bird down with olive oil the following morning, let it get room temperature and, cooked  on a high temperature of 450 for 30 minutes, then lowered the temperature to 325, basted it with melted butter every 20 minutes till done, cooking it till thermometer said 5 degrees before done. Let it sit another 30 minutes on the counter and thermometer said it was done for its weight because it kept raising . It came out perfect!  Cooked done,crispy  brown outside and moist tender inside.

First time thanksgiving dinner when I did all the cooking and I used this recipe. I didn't want dry bland turkey. Turkey was moist, but I wouldn't say this enhanced the flavor much. I would try again maybe using more seasonings and or different ones. Otherwise good

OH MY GOSH!!!! I have never had a turkey turn out so moist.  Everyone loved it!  The left overs lasted 2 days.  No long enough in my book, I'm going to brine another turkey just for the left overs.  Absolutely delicious!!!!!

Used 15lb turkey. Made with half broth and half apple juice as suggested by others. Placed in a pot in fridge for about 24 hours. Rinsed and dried. Placed in fridge uncovered about 12 hours. Stuffed with veggies and herbs. Baked breast side down for two hours turned over and finished baking about one more hour. Broiled on low about 10 minutes to brown skin. The white meat was so juicy. Family loved this turkey.

Substitute half the vegetable broth for apple juice or orange juice 64 oz.  Make your own savory with garlic powder, cinnamon, paprika, oregano, ginger, and black or white ground pepper.  I throw in Cayenne pepper too.  For savory up to you how you like it, if you have these items in your spice rack don't pay the prices for a bottle.  You can brine up to 12 hours.  One year I forgot it up to 24 hours, but a little salty.  I smoke the turkey with this brine and it comes out excellent.  Also have thrown a couple chickens into the brine after turkey is done for follow on meals.  This brine is excellent for smoking.  Don't know about cooking in oven, as after smoking and tasting meat that melts in your mouth will never go back to oven again.

I  made this 1.5 days before Thanksgiving on a 9.5lb turkey. OMG!! Hands down, best turkey I have ever had! It was extremely juicy, and packed full of flavor!! Before I put it in the oven, I used a cup of butter with a combo of spices and slathered the turkey. I used a roasting pan with a lid until it reached 170 degrees (approx. 3 hours). Once I removed the lid, I slathered it with melted butter and EVOO and continued to cook for about 25-30 min until it browned up. I allowed the turkey to rest for an hour. Once we cut into it, you could see how juicy it was!! That's the first time we polished a whole turkey!!  I will definitely make this again, soon! So,sooo good!!

I made no changes and used this brine for a 20 pound turkey.  After we brined the turkey for approximately 24 hours, we smoked the turkey on the grill and it was amazing.  Juicy and tasty.  We used a dry rub from one of our local barbecue establishments, Fox Brothers Barbecue, and we were really happy with the finished product.

I had never brined a turkey before, and it turned out awesome. My 13lb. turkey was in the brine for 12 hours, then I cooked it in a bag with a jonathan apple in the cavity,  and celery and onions in the bag. I seasoned the turkey inside and out with black pepper, paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder. The drippings were made a perfect gravy, no extra seasoning needed!

I've been using this recipe for more than 10 years--both for oven roasting and deep frying turkey.  I usually put the turkey in a brining bag that you can buy at the grocery store, especially around the holidays.  I put the bag in a tall-sided plastic tub that will fit on the bottom shelf of my refrig before placing the turkey and pouring the brine over it.  Don't put the bag in anything like a cake pan with low sides, the bag will burst open and the brine will go all over your floor and your refrig if you make it that far.  I guess the savory is the same thing as "Summer Savory" which is what I use.  Summer Savory used to be hard to find so I had to order it by mail (or online now).  Now they carry Summer Savory at our local grocery store so I guess this recipe has spread.  The only brand I've used is Spice Islands, but only because that's what's available.  I make this sized batch of brine for every sized turkey---Usually 22  pounds or less.  Using the bag and the tub the turkey isn't always completely submerged so I put it in breast side down over night then flip the next morning.  I've forgotten to flip it and the turkey came out just fine anyway.  I've used every kind of salt there is, from cheap store brand iodized salt in the little cardboard "barrels" with the pour spout to less cheap hand-harvested sea salt from Ile de Re, France.  It doesn't seem to make a bit of difference which you use.  It takes a lot longer for the brine to cool after boiling than you might thin

This makes an amazing turkey! I'm fairly new to the turkey cooking world and struggled last year with timing my turkey. After much searching and comparing and googling I settled this year on rubbing some safflower oil on the outside of the patted dry 20 lb bird and starting out at 500 degrees on the lowest rack in the oven for 30 minutes. I did need to cover the wing tips with foil at about 20 minutes. Then I dropped the temp to 350 and roasted it for about 2 hours until the little pop up timer popped. I basted it with the juices a couple times throughout cooking. It came out looking sooo beautiful and the 8 attacked as soon as my back was turned. It was juicy and flavorful and not underdone (like last year's near disaster) hopefully this helps someone with temp and times!

Started using this recipe for thanksgiving a few years ago. I have been cooking thanksgiving dinner for 20 years and my husband asked that I never make a turkey without this brining recipe again. It was excellent!  I stuffed the turkey and the stuffing came out great as well. I suggest rinsing the turkey and patting dry prior to baking so that the stuffing and drippings for gravy aren't too salty. Thanks for this resize!!!!

Love this recipe and it makes a great turkey if you do it right. best turkey that I have ever had, also to the person that said it ruined their 18lb turkey you are lying because your turkey wont become salty from the brine, the salt stays outside the turkey the mixture just makes the turkey juicer and moist so it doesn't dry out while cooking, the only way for it to get "too salty" is if you added salt afterwards.

Super MOIST turkey and so tasty too. Here is how I did it. Followed the recipe but didn't have veg broth so substituted chicken broth. Added 1 tablespoon of celery seed.
For the baking part, I oiled the turkey sprinkled the same seasonings over the turkey and placed in the turkey size cooking bag. It was the moistest and best turkey I have every had, some friends commented on how their grandma has to learn how I do it.

I use brining always, but my nephew taught me a trick last year. I cut up the turkey (breasts, legs, thighs, wings( and then brine them in your choice of brine. Cooking dark and white meats in separate baking dishes allows each to cook to the perfect level of "doneness". Use your meat thermometer. It is also the easiest way to carve after coming out of the oven. Just slice and you are done! Use the juices for gravy!

Couldn't find Savory, so I just used Italian Seasoning. Also used a gallon of apple juice instead of ice water. Let it sit (frozen) for a day on the counter, then put it in the fridge for a week while it slowly thawed out. This was the most moist turkey I've ever experienced -- the meat fell off the bones when we served! Makes excellent gravy, and the soup I made with the carcass afterward is TO DIE FOR.

This was really good and really easy, however, it made the turkey and gravy quite salty. Next time I'll reduce the salt by a third and see where that gets me.

Made the brine exactly as it is printed. It was excellent!  
Had requests for the recipe and have printed copies to hand out!
 The turkey was so moist and flavorful! 

The gravy I made with the drippings in pan after cooking was delicious! 

Going to cut recipe in half and try it with just a whole turkey breast this weekend!  
Give it a try.,it will not disappoint!

This is my favorite brine recipe and I have used it at least three times. When ready to cook, we place the turkey, breast side up in a roasting pan and cover the turkey with apple smoked bacon.  then cook covered until the last 30 minutes. Drippings make the only gravy I like.

Used this recipe with minor changes. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth because I buy a big container of powdered chicken bullion at Costco. The other change was that I omitted the savory because my grocery store did not have any on the shelf. The turkey was cooked using Homestyle Turkey the Michigander Way recipe from this site. AMAZING and DELICIOUS!

This was my first brining attempt and I must say this was a huge hit!  I had a 32 lb turkey so I doubled the recipe.  I used the XL Ziploc bags and stored turkey in a cooler with ice and left it in the garage overnight.  I replenished the ice a couple of times and brined a total of about about 25 hours ( it was a LARGE bird)!  Be sure to rinse and dry the turkey thoroughly after taking it out of the brine.  I put pats of butter under the skin, covered the breast with foil for the first few hours then removed the foil to let the breast brown and it came out beautiful and so juicy!  My family just raved about it.  Looks like I will be using this every year!

YUM!!  Our turkey was delicious!  So moist!!  We made it as per the recipe; no changes other than we brined it for about 16-18 hours.  Also, as per the directions, it did cook much more quickly than anticipated.  Our 19 lb. turkey was finished in 3 1/2 hours.  It was so yummy, I didn't offer anyone leftovers!  Wanted them all for myself!

I  had an 18 lb bird so I added more salt and more water to it. I also added orange slices to the brine. After that, I cooked it with this brine using the following recipe:

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/43655/perfect-turkey/?internalSource=recipe%20hub&referringId=975&referringContentType=recipe%20hub#recipe-toolbar

The result was the best turkey I've ever had. Juicy, tasty and all around perfect. I didn't have any white whine on me in the other recipe so I chose to substitute it with grape juice. I also chose to cover the bird in tin foil for the majority of the time in the oven.

This was my first turkey. I had a 19lb turkey and read over the good and bad reviews. I was worried that my turkey would turn out salty because of some reviews. I did add and change the recipe a bit. But my turkey was a hit it and was very juicy, my family voted it best turkey they've ever had. But to me it lacked flavor but it was juicy. Drippings were not salty. I only put in 1/2 a cup of Kosher salt and 1 carton of UNSALTED vegetable broth, I added garlic and 2 sliced oranges. But kept everything else the same. And I rinsed it out pretty good before cooking.  Next time I will double spices and maybe put 3/4cup of salt.

The turkey was great. Very moist and tender. We were cutting it with a fork. One of my sons asked me what was wrong with the turkey, it's so soft. My ex asked the same question. I kept telling them I put it in a brine and I got blank looks. My youngest told them to just shut up and eat the turkey, it's just moist. Once I explained the science behind it everything was fine. I was told to always make turkey this way. I did the 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 apple juice. I didn't stuff it but I will the next time. Now to look up how to make turkey broth.

This was my first time brining and using a fresh turkey for Thanksgiving; it was wonderful! I miscalculated and didn't have enough vegetable broth so I followed one of the suggestions to use half vegetable broth and half apple juice; I put the turkey into an oven bag in my Nesco 18 Qt Roaster; it cooked in about 2 hours! It was 9 lbs. I will definitely use again!! Everyone loved the turkey!! Very moist and juicy!!

I have used this brine recipe over the past several years, with superb results. Some reviewers say the turkey is too salty. One way to reduce the saltiness is to thoroughly rinse the turkey under running water before patting it dry and preparing it for roasting.

I adjusted a few things. I followed the recipe except that  I use 1 gallon of apple juice and 1 gallon of vegetable broth.  I also add 1 cup of brown sugar.  I marinade in a cooler full of ice overnight.

Will now continue to ALWAYS brine my turkeys! So many compliments about flavorful and juiciness of turkey. I also now brine my whole chickens before cooking as well. So much funniness.

I must preface this by saying I'm a turkey novice -- I've never cooked an entire turkey before, and this got rave reviews for my Friendsgiving this past Saturday. 

I made a few modifications to the recipe:
- used ¾ cup table salt instead of 1 cup sea salt 
- added 32 oz apple cider in place of veg stock
- added 1 peeled orange, fennel greens, 1 bay leaf, and 1 Tbsp minced garlic to brine when boiling
- stuffed the turkey with a quartered orange, ¼ onion, celery (with greens), 3 whole peeled garlic cloves, and fennel after brining
- rubbed skin with butter before going into the oven

It was just a tad salty for my taste, and I cut the salt back pretty significantly (by omitting 1/4 c salt AND replacing 1 of the containers of veg stock with apple cider), which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I brined our 14 lb turkey for 2 days in the refrigerator. The meat was very tender and moist compared to the turkeys I am used to eating. 

I will use the recipe again for sure. In fact, I might even start brining another turkey tonight. But I may even cut back the salt to a 1/2 cup. I guess it really depends on the size of the bird and how long you brine it.

The turkey turned out great with the brine recipe. The only thing I didn't read about in previous reviews or mention here, is that the gravy made from the broth was very very salty. I made the gravy and it was so salty. So I would say to rinse the bird after you take it out of the brine.

As many who posted, I am a first time "briner". I very pleased with the way it turned out. Since I used chicken broth, I cut the Kosher Salt to 1/2 cup. I added a half of a leftover onion and one large carrot to the brine when I boiled it. Before I stuck the turkey in the oven I rubbed a little canola oil (as recommended by Alton Brown) and placed a stick of butter in the cavity (my own after thought). Cooked it uncovered at 500 for 30 minutes then 350 for 2 hours for this 16lb bird. Thanks for the recipe and all who posted their reviews. ????

I have used this recipe twice and loved it both times. The turkey was moist and delicious. The gravy was as good as ever.

Thank  you for sharing this brine.  We love poultry, but couldn't find a brine that tasted like turkey when I was finished.  This was great!  We don't like the sugar & booze.  This is just fantastic, well seasoned & really moist.  Didn't  make the gravy as my husband & I both eat a low fat diet.  Really glad I made it.  I will use for all my poultry.

A quick and simple brining recipe! I used a roasting bag rather than a bucket and brined the turkey overnight in the fridge. I've found that when you brine a turkey you don't need to use a bag to roast it in, as the brine keeps the moisture inside. I honestly would rather not use a bag because it makes the skin rubbery.

I used this for a turkey breast.  I made a turkey and sausage gumbo, but I like to roast the turkey first before adding it to the gumbo.  I adjusted the recipe to 5 servings, and had plenty to cover the breast in a gallon sized Ziploc baggie overnight.  I didn't have any savory in my spice cabinet, so I substituted in some poultry seasoning.  I also added a few whole black peppercorns to the brine while it boiled.  I baked off the breast as normal, and it was really tasty.  In fact, while hubby and I were picking the meat off the bone, he was shoveling in it.  I couldn't fuss at him, cause I was doing the same thing!  This is the first turkey in a while where my husband ate the leftover, so that's a great compliment (usually I freeze the cooked meat to use later...not on this bird!).  This is a definite keeper, and I will be trying this out when I roast chickens!

I used this brine with a 16.5 lb turkey for Thanksgiving this year.  While the turkey was flavorful and delicious I took away a star because prepping and cooking it was trickier than I expected and the meat had a softer (mushy?) texture I found unappealing.  The turkey did cook faster than  expected, the wings in particular browned in less than an hour so you may want to put foil over the wings and legs while the breast cooks.  While it tasted great, I don't think I'll be doing this recipe again.  It was very time consuming and difficult to execute.  I used an XXL Ziploc storage bag (which is food safe) to brine the turkey and placed it in a cooler with ice because the whole thing was not going to fit in my fridge.  I'm going back to stuffing my bird with citrus and fresh herbs, much easier and less time consuming with delicious results.

This is a amazing recipe. The turkey is moist and flavorful. It was such a hit with the family that I making a second turkey for Christmas. I will stuff the second turkey with celery and apples... This was my first time trying brine. It is well worth the extra time and effort.

The best ever except I used chicken stock, and didn't refrigerate overnight. Cooked for 90minutes 13lbs. Turkey added ctr a seasoning to the top by brushing on.

I cooked one of my best turkeys using this brine recipe for Thanksgiving this year.  I brined it overnight, used some of the brining solution in the bottom of the pan, and put apricot jam under the skin of my turkey.  I roasted breast-side down and flipped the bird two-thirds through the cooking process.  My turkey was unstuffed.  I used the brine in the bottom of the pan to baste the turkey every 30-45 minutes.  Turned out fantastic!  To keep things simple, I also roasted potatoes, carrots, pearl onions, and brussel sprouts rather than making the myriad of traditional recipes which my family doesn't care for, and served with a simple salad of greens, grapes, and pommegranites dressed with poppyseed dressing.  Cranberry sauce by TJs and gravy made with a roux of butter and flour plus all the defatted and deglazed turkey drippings with a touch of white wine.  Followed up with a homemade pumpkin pie.  It's been requested for an apple pie in addition to all of this next year!  Bon Appetit!

Great recipe and super easy to make. As another user points out, round drink coolers similar to those you might see on the sidelines at sporting events are perfect for the brine, almost if they were made specifically for the purpose. Food grade plastic and very easy to clean-up. The flavor imparted by the brine is mild yet distinct and not the least bit salty. Even the driest portions of breast meat come out moist and tender. I did as other users suggested and used 1/2 gal. vegetable broth and 1/2 gallon apple juice with great results. This recipe is a definite keeper and one I will use again.

I've used this recipe the last 4 years and it's fantastic. After cleaning and drying we fill the cavity with lemon and fresh thyme, rosemary, sage. 22-23 lb turkey cooks at 350 for 2:45 in an oven bag and is perfectly done, not dry. The drippings make great gravy, we didn't think it was too salty.

Used this a few times now.  Always produces a moist turkey.   I always brine in the refrigerator, never a cooler.  If the fridges are all full (I have 3) then I remove other items and place them in the cooler - the bird gets priority!

This recipe made me look like a ROCKSTAR!!!! It made a complete difference in the moisture of the meat. My 15 guests were blown away at how tasty it was, compared to the normal butterball (which is good), but brining is a game changer.
Thank You!!

I have brined many turkeys, but last Thanksgiving's turkey was the best I've had in my life. I couldn't tell much difference in the other turkeys i brined. All were grilled. So, this turkey was brined, then grilled to perfection. I don't even like turkey that much, but this will make me a changed person. Sorry I don't have a photo.

I tried this recipe for our Christmas turkey.  It was the first I've ever brined. I added a few more things like onions and celery.  It was the moistest, best-taking turkey I've ever cooked.  I always thought brining involved just putting a turkey in salt water. What I ended with was basically vegetable soup stock.  Unbelievably good!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used this on my very first turkey I've ever baked/roasted and it turned out so moist and delicious!  I followed the recipe pretty exact except for adding 'savory' wasn't sure that was, so didn't add.  I also used fresh rosemary vs the dried.  I let it set for almost 2 full days.  I will always brine my turkey!  I got lots of compliments on it.  I used this brine along with baking upside from the 'Perfect Turkey' recipe, I can't recommend enough!

This truly was an easy recipe, moist and very delicious.  I used a roasting oven and it turned out great!  The brine smells wonderful too.

I have never brined a turkey before so was not sure what to expect. It made my turkey so moist!! I will never fix turkey any other way. The only thing I did not really care for was the strong rosemary flavor so will use less next time.

Excellent brine. I used a brown n bag to brine the bird and placed it in the cooler packed with ice. Saved me the space in my small refrigerator. I used this with a fresh turkey and then roasted it in a Nesco roaster. Delish.

This recipe was my  first attempt at brining.I have used this brine also for the last 3 Thanksgivings; did not change a thing for a 14lb bird, except used anothers advice and used half gallon of apple juice and cooked it in a countertop roaster. The bird literally has fallen apart(splt at the dressing) as we try to take out of the roaster. I will never use another. My guest always rave about my turkey days later... Thank you SO much for such an easy and delicious recipe.

Made the brine last year for our Thanksgiving turkey and it was the most moist, delicious turkey I've ever made.  Even the left overs remained moist.  I'll be using this brine for years to come!

This makes a very juicy and flavorful turkey! I made it with a bone-in turkey breast and marinated it in a Ziploc L bag. They are food safe and much cheaper than a brining bag, $1 per bag verses $6. Low sodium broth and 1/3 cup of salt was plenty for us, however, I did half all of the other ingredients because a bone-in breast weighs about half as much as a full turkey.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year, and it was a huge hit! (Did everything the same minus the savory, which I didn't have on hand.) Haven't stopped thinking about it since (even dreaming about turkey), so making it for New Year's dinner tomorrow...off to pop it in the refrig now. Thanks for the great recipe.

I used this recipe my first time brining a turkey.  I followed the directions exactly and had mixed results.  The turkey was extremely juicy...great, but the wings were too salty, inedibly salty.  Also, I wasn't in love with the flavor, but I did receive many compliments.  So, I will try it once again because this recipe has such rave reviews I think it deserves another shot.  I'm hopeful my second time will yield better results.

First time at brining a turkey, it was simple but alittle time consuming making the vegetable stock, the end result was well worth it. Important to remember brining shortens the bake time.  I did an 8lb. turkey in 3 hours!  I was planning on 4 hours....The turkey was moist and very flavorful. I will do this again definitley.

First time brining. Best and moist Turkey ever! Did not have a food bucket, so I used a large pot. About 3 inches of the turkey stuck out, so after 8 hours I had to flip it in the morning for 3 hours. Next time I would try it in a cooler or a food bucket. Will always use this recipe now!

I made this for the first time last year at Thanksgiving. My mother usually makes the turkey but hers always turns out dry. Everyone raved how delicious and moist my turkey was. Nobody even touched the gravy! I have since been voted to make the turkey every year. I followed the recipe to a T. I put the turkey in an (un-scented) trash bag with the brine then put the bag in a large cooler and covered with ice. Keep an eye for the pop up on your bird to tell you when it is done. A brined turkey doesn't take as long to cook.

One word describes this recipe....INCREDIBLE. I studied every comment on this recipe before I decided to try it.  I made a trip to Lowes and bought a 5 gallon plastic bucket (Home Depot sells them also) to brine the bird in.  I had a 22 lb turkey and I left it in the brine it for 2 days.  The meat was so moist and did not dry out at all.  I could not find savory, which is one of the ingredients for the brine so I concoction of things that were already in my pantry.  Try it, it will not regret it!!!

Awesome!!! Incredible flavor!!! I've never been fond of turkey but this was like no other turkey. It was so moist that while carving we had to pour the juice off the platter. I didn't heed the warning that brined turkeys cook faster so it cooked longer than it should have but it was still awesome. I'm looking forward to the making it again.

Two words.  Best.  Gravy. Ever.  OKAY, that's THREE words, but you get the point!  Aside from wrapping the entire turkey in bacon (drool..) this made the most flavorful turkey I've ever roasted.  Yum!

We all loved it. I used the brine to make my very 1st turkey. Everyone raved. I couldn't find a large enough bucket to sit the turkey in overnight so I had to improvise. And with that, I had to add more liquid. I also used the apple juice along with the veg. stock. It turned out so juicy and delicious! I would definitely use this brine again! (And I look forward to it)

This was sooooo good! This was my first time to brine a turkey and it was wonderful. I will NEVER cook another turkey with out doing this first! Only thing I did not use was the savory, only because I had none and the small town I live in does not carry it......ohhhh my husband loved it. This man doesn't like turkey but was ready for the Christmas one to be cooked :)

Wonderful brine! We used beef broth on accident, and although I would have preferred vegetable broth, it turned out great.  Very tender and juicy! Thank you for the recipe!

This is great!  I had never heard of "brining" & just happened upon this when searching for turkey recipes.  It takes a little more time, but it is well worth it!  My turkey was moist & delicious & I had compliments from all my guests.  I used half a gallon apple juice with half a gallon vegetable broth. I was practically out of salt & used less than half a cup, but it was fine, although it could have used a bit more.  I baked a 16-lb turkey in a roasting bag for 3 - 3 1/2 hours.  It was YUMMY!

This Brine made my Turkey taste fantastic. It was the first time I've ever cooked a turkey, and it was still the best turkey I've ever eaten. Every really enjoyed it on Thanksgiving.  I didn't add any savory or use vegetable stock. I did add some brown sugar, and used chicken stock and kosher salt instead. The 12lbs. turkey brined in the fridge for about 36 hours. I'll never not use this again.

Absolutely wonderful!!!  I'm not a fan of white meat, but I am now. It was so moist & flavorful.  My guests all wanted the recipe.  The only thing I added to the brine was a little fresh garlic & some pepper.  Good stuff!

Excellent.  Just excellent.  I tried this for the first time on Thanksgiving, and it made very tasty, very moist turkey -- even the usually dry white meat.   Even days later the turkey is juicy and delicious.

I used this recipe (minus the Savory - couldn't find it) for a 21lb. turkey.  I brined the turkey thawed, for about 18 hours.  This recipe is hands-down the BEST brining recipe out there.  Our turkey turned out perfect.  Everyone agreed that this year's turkey was the best they had ever eaten.  I let the turkey sit for about 30 minutes before carving it, and the juices were just over-flowing.  Three days later, and the turkey is as tasty as it was the first day.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

A++  My guests loved my turkey because it was juicy, tender and great tasting!  My cousin's husband said, he doesn't normally eat turkey but on Thanksgiving Day at my house, he had seconds and took some of the leftover turkey home!  Excellent brine!

I tried this brine for Thanksgiving. I used a large roasting bag and a cooler to set it in. This was by far the juiciest turkey I have ever made. The biggest benefit though might have been the spectacular gravy the drippings helped me make. Even my extremely critical mother in-law had to admit it was amazing.

This was wonderful.  Family that doesn't eat turkey ate my turkey, in fact we ran out!  I did cut the salt down to 3/4 cup because there was salt added to my turkey.  I'm going to use this on some chickens in the very near future!  BTW I couldn't find the savory so I used poultry seasoning as a replacement.

This is it folks, the only brine recipe you will ever need!  The turnkey was brilliant!  Falling off the bone!  I do believe you should NOT put this in a plastic bucket though.  BPA's and such are so not good for you.  Purchase an inexpensive very large pot to soak your bird in.  It's worth it.  But do make this recipe!

I have only used the Williams & Sonoma brand of brine.  This recipe beats theirs by far!  Our turkey was the best I have ever had.  The only change I made was to substitute garlic powder for the rosemary, as I am not a fan of rosemary.  GREAT BRINE = GREAT FLAVOR & MOIST MOIST MOIST. Thank you.

This was amazing!! I will ALWAYS brine my birds in the future. The meat was soooo flavorful and the flavors were all the way through the meat. I combined this method with a few others on this website. I used the Rosemary Roasted Turkey recipe for seasoning after brining but instead of olive oil I used butter and then stuffed the bird. I poured chicken stock and white wine in the bottom of the roasting pan, used and roasting rack, I tented the bird for the first 2.5 hours and basted every 30 mins.

Great recipe! I had a smaller turkey so I halved everything... I also had no vegetable broth so I substituted chicken broth. Turned out great! Juiciest turkey we have ever had! The gravy was great... just had to thicken it and the seasoning was perfect! Will have to do from this holiday out!

We always brine pork chops but this was our first time with a turkey.  WOW.  It was ridiculously moist and delicious.  THANK YOU SO MUCH! Oh, I went to my grocery store's bakery and they gave me an empty frosting bucket and knew EXACTLY what I needed it for!  Apparently, brining is on the rise and I hope everyone had this recipe!

Wow - this will be my new favorite Thanksgiving recipe.   I changed it a little bit - didn't have enough vegetable stock, so I substituted half apple cider.  I also used a 6 lb whole turkey breast and roasted in an oven bag for about 1 1/2 hrs.   PERFECT - incredibly tender and flavorful!

Growing up I always didn't like turkey because I always thought it was to dry, but we decided to try this and cook it on the grill. I now love turkey and decided that I would not cook a ham at Thanksgiving anymore and we even made a turkey at Christmas last year because it was so good.

Use a gourmet sea salt like Sal del Mar to really make this brine zesty!

Turned out great!  Tender, juicy and a nice flavor to go with all the traditional Thanksgiving dishes!  We've brined our turkey the past few holidays and will always do so...its SO much better than any other way we've ever tried.

This brine was super easy to make and made our turkey taste so good!  We let the turkey drain really well and then fried it.  It's normally really moist but this time it was fabulous!

This is a wonderful brine! I made a small tweak. During the roasting process, I baste the bird with butter that has been warmed on the stove with rubbing sage mixed in. Oh my gosh. I will never cook an unbrined bird again.

This method is fantastic! I tried this recipe for the first time for a New Year's Day dinner this year, and after cooking turkeys for MANY years, produced the best tasting turkey ever. Exceptionally moist, perfectly seasoned without a lot of extra work or expense! I found finding space in my fridge for the container a bit cumbersome, but in the end was more than well worth the effort. I used the recommended amount of salt, and did not find the finished turkey at all salty. I also reduced the overall cooking time, but found that it still took the same time as it would have without brining it. Thanks for sharing the recipe - it's on my "permanent keep" list!

I brined the turkey overnight and it turned a cheapo .67 cent/lb turkey into a masterpiece. The turkey did finish about 30 minutes early and the popout button did not go off. I tested the bird with a meat thermometer plunged into the thigh looking for 160+ degrees. The white meat was running with juices. Everyone loved this turkey. Thanks.

This worked well. Gave the turkey a great flavor. Used others advice and put the turkey in an oven bag with the brine, then put it in a (food grade) bucket, covered it with ice, sealed the bucket and left it in the garage overnight. Came out great, and was super easy. Thanks for the recipe!

I also doubled the recipe and used fresh herbs, and 1/2 apple cider & 1/2 homemade Vegetable Broth.       We cooked a 20 lb turkey on the Weber BBQ and it took approx 3 - 3 1/2 hours to cook.    This was the BEST turkey ever!!!    I also brined the turkey neck and put it on the BBQ before we put the turkey on.....all I can say is I now have an appreciation for the the neck!   WOW!  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

My first time aver brining a Turkey, and this turned out excellent. The whole turkey was so flavorful and juicy. My mother in law even commented on how moist and good it was which is probably the first compliment on my cooking in 11 years.

Used this recipe at Thanksgiving and it was awesome!  I used a cooler with a clean plastic trash bag like a previous reviewer did.  I will leave it in longer next time since I only left it in the brine 9 hours.  This will be used at Christmas again this year and for Thanksgiving next year!  Way to knock it out of the park on this one.

I used this recipe this year for Thanksgiving.  The only change I made was I used 1/2 gal of vegetable broth and 1/2 gal of chicken broth, only because that is what I had on hand.  It was the juciest turkey I have ever made.  Awesome recipe.

I loved this recipe! This was the first time I have ever brined a turkey and will be using this recipe going forward. I had a 14 lb turkey which fit into my stainless steel stock pot perfectly; therefore, I didn't have to use a 5 gallon bucket as others suggested. It was cold outside so I left it on my back porch overnight. I used 6 cans of the veggie broth and all the other ingredients with the exception of the savory and I used 1/2 the salt. Needless to say, my turkey was JUICY and very tasty, it wasn't salty at all. I also put a stick of celery and an onion in the inside, put it in a turkey bag and the meat off the bones!!! It was pretty and brown, I also rubbed some butter on the skin as well. I got plenty of compliments. Will definiately use this recipe again. Thanks soooooo much.

We are converted!  We will never make our Tgiving turkey another way.  Next time, I need to make sure that I don't add additional salt to my drippings gravy since the brine made it salty.

This was very good. I have never tried brining the turkey before. I was pleased with it. It was very juicy and tender. I thought I bought enough veggie broth to equal a gallon but turned out there were only 1 2/3 cups in the can that said there were 2 cups. I topped it off with apple juice and a dash of extra sea salt. I will use this recipe every year from now on.

Great recipe.  Added flavor to bird and made the meat juicy and tender.  Followed recipe as written; removed from brine; rinsed (just a little) and then fried.  Best turkey we've ever made- the whole family commented how great it was.

I also doubled this recipe for a 20# bird.  I also added 1 gal of apple juice instead of water and 1 bottle of 2005 Caillaubert Ugni-Blanc/Colombard, and 1T smashed peppercorns, brined 24 hours.  Placed, fresh Rosemary, Sage, Thyme and dried bay leaves in the cavity.  Then grilled it on a 300deg gas grill (no flame under bird) with a water pan over the flame and Mesquite wood ships to 170deg rotating the pan and basting every 30 minutes.  Perfectly browned, best turkey I have done in 25 years, a big hit!

I used this recipe to make my first turkey and everybody LOVED IT.  My mom really did most of the cooking... I just made the brine and soaked it (I wasn't about to put my hand inside a raw bird and pull out its innards) but she absolutely loved it.  It was her first time making a brined turkey and like many other reviewers said, this is the ONLY way to make a turkey.  It was moist and flavorful.  I even ate some of the dark meat (which I don't usually touch).  She called me this morning and asked me to print off copies of this recipe because she was bragging to everyone at work how wonderful it was.  Thanks so much for this recipe!  Also, I didn't think it was salty at all.  The stuffing was not too salty either.  Next time, I think I will add more of the spices though, because I would have liked more of the herb flavor in the meat.  FANTASTIC!!!

This was my first experience with brining a turkey for Thanksgiving. I didn't use the sage, and I used only 1/2 Tablespoon of rosemary because I don't really like rosemary. The turkey was a little salty--but in a good way. I loved it and my guests loved it too. The turkey was moist and the gravy and dressing used with drippings turned out super tasty.

i double bagged and brined my 18 lb turkey in the reynolds wrap oven bag and it leaked!!. luckily i had chosen to empty out the bottom drawer of my fridge (the drawers for veggies/fruits) and stuck the bag in there, otherwise there would have been liquids all over the inside of my fridge instead of contained inside the bottom drawer.

This was an excellent brine!  I do prefer the much simpler salt and water recipe, but if I have the time this is great.  I didn't use the savory, but added a bay leaf.  I use a large pot that I bought from a warehouse club.  I didn't have room in my fridge, but kept adding ice and since it's winter, kept it outside on our 2nd floor balcony out of the sun.

Awesome! I made my first roasted turkey last week and this recipe made the turkey the best turkey I have ever tasted. The only thing I did different was use chicken stock instead of vegetable stock, but still turned out great!! You will never make your turkey any other way after trying this recipe.

I used this brine two years ago for Thanksgiving, and everyone raved about how great the turkey was.  This year, I couldn't find where I stashed the print-out I used, and ended up using another brine--different ingredients.  It was good, too, but this is the stand-out recipe, the one everyone talks about.  I'm using it tonight on a pair of chickens for my son's birthday (by his request).  Thank you!  I have it marked, now, so I won't lose it again!

The brine worrked a treat! This was my first attempt at a turkey. Eveyone commented on how beautifully flavoured the turkey was and how juicy. I subsituted savory for marjoram. Had the turkey soaking for about 18 hours and cooked the turkey (6kg) for 3 hours on the Webber.

I didn't decide to try to brine my fresh turkey until about four hours before I started roasting. This helped make a juicy bird, but I will begin the night before next time.

This produced a very juicy bird. I used apple juice for half of the broth. It almost tasted like the bird was pickled or something. Someone also said that it had a slightly different texture, more rubbery. I didn't notice this and thought that the meat was very tender ad juicy.

We used this and the turkey fryer and it came out very good.  I have always read that this makes the turkey cook faster, but I wasn't sure about the fryer.  Next time we will fry the turkey for a shorter amount of time.

The turkey was very moist.  I couldn't really taste the spices in the meat but it made the best gravy ever!  Veggie broth was too expensive so made my own like other reviewers suggested:  tomatoes, celery, onions, carrots & parsley.  It was in the 30s outside so I put brine (including veggies from the broth) & the 20lb turkey in a cooler on the balcony for about 24 hrs.  Turkey still took 8 hrs to cook.  Will definitely use this for all poultry in the future.  Thanks for sharing!

The best turkey ever!!!!  I used 1/2 gallon of vegetable stock and 1/2 gallon of apple juice.  Everything else was the same.  It made the juciest turkey and the best gravy.  It did not cut my cooking time as stated in the recipe and other reviews...Thanksgiving was still on time though.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Mmm... Definitely made the white-breast meat more edible. My wife and I varied it by substituting vegetable broth with white cranberry juice. We also added 1 pack of peach jello and sliced oranges to provide extra citric sweetness. Oven roasting took much longer than in past (> 1.5 hrs, 375 deg). It took about 2.5 hrs. We used an electronic thermometer ($25, Oregon Scientific) to accurately cook the meat.

My turkey was dry.  I didn't overcook, but it just did not work for me.  I was really hoping for a juicy turkey, this was not it.  The taste was decent though so instead of one star I give it two.  Turkey sandwich with plenty of mayo should cover up the dryness a bit.

This is the first time I have brined a turkey so I was a little nervous about it. But it turned out excellent! The meat was so moist and it literally just fell off the turkey! I didn't have enough fridge space, so I put the brine in a clean garbage bag inside of a cooler and put it in my garage for the night (we live in ND!). I had to turn the turkey about half way thru the night to brine the other side. After rinsing in the morning, all I did was slather it with butter and pepper. It was great and got rave reviews! Will definitely do every year!

Even substituting a mix of chicken stock, apple juice and wine for the veggie stock, this brine produced only a very subtle flavor, I think I was hoping for something a bit stronger. It did, however, do a wonderful job of keeping the turkey nice and moist. May try increasing the amount of herbs next time.

This brine recipe was AWESOME! The turkey turned out so juicey. This was my first time brining a turkey, normally I just butter really well, and throw some veggies and an apple in the cavity, not anymore! PERFECT!

Amazing. I even accidentally overcooked my turkey (while repairing a cut finger!!) and it was still moist. So good. If you haven't tried brining a turkey (or chicken.. whatever!) do it.. you'll be surprised at the difference!
