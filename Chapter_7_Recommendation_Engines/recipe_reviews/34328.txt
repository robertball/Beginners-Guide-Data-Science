This is so wonderful and quite easy to make.  I doubled the vanilla and chose not to add the pecans.  Instead of stirring in the milk I put the cooled mixture in my blender, added the milk and vanilla and whipped it for about 3 minutes.  Creamy, smooth and delicious! My sister requested caramel sauce for our July 4th get together and I can't wait to share this one!  (I have the container taped shut to keep me out of it!)

This sauce was very delicious.  I made some without nuts and some with nuts to serve at a sundae party.  It was a big hit.  Warning:  Be sure not to add the milk until after the other ingredients are cooked.  I added the milk too soon for one batch, and the sauce curdled.  It still tasted great, but had a funny texture.

This was SO good!!  Oh my gosh, it was good!  Wonderful!  The best caramel-y sauce I've ever had!  And SO EASY!  I needed to use up some evaporated milk (a cup, exactly!) and some large marshmallows left over from S'mores this summer so I made this to top Cheesecake Bars from this site.  It is yummy on those!  I'm sure it would be great on ice cream too.  I used walnuts instead of pecans, just because that's what I had.  Will have to try pecans next time.  When I was stirring in the evap milk at the end, it didn't look like it would incorporate at first, so I got out the ol' whisk and that did the trick.  This would be delicious without the nuts as well.  This was so good I had to eat a few spoonfuls as I was putting it away!

This is the absolute best caramel sauce I have ever tasted! I made it to go over Caramel Macchiato Cheesecake (also found on this site) and I omitted the nuts. I used the remainder on ice cream and talk about good! Yum, Yum! -19/09/07 *Update: 16/10/09 - I have made this recipe countless times since I first found it and I have had trouble on occasions with the brown sugar not melting completely. When this happens I just pour the finished sauce into my blender and let it run for a minute - smooth sauce! This truly is the best caramel sauce I have come across and I use it for almost any recipe which calls for caramel topping. It is also great with some peanut butter blended in as well - but not too much to overpower the caramel flavour (just eyeball it) It thickens up a great deal with PB in it but is so delicious either way!

I have to admit I was a tad disspointed in the outcome of this. When I read the ingredients with the pecans, marshmallows, etc. and I saw the picture I thought this was going to be a thick and gooey ice cream topping. It appears to just sit on top of the ice cream in the picture. Anyway, it does taste like a melted praline candy, but it is very "soupy." It is good but really sweet, but so are pralines. I just wished it was much thicker. But, this would make a nice change to a regular caramel sauce on cheesecakes or other desserts where a thick dessert sauce is not neccessary.

Our favorite restaurant serves a fabulous bread pudding with a caramel/praline-type sauce. My own bread pudding is my hubby's favorite but he was not too happy with my sauce. This sundae topping duplicates the taste of the one in the restaurant.  OH MY MY MY...this is off the charts!  Many, many thanks for a fantastic recipe which is in my permanent recipe file!

I made half this recipe exactly as written.  The flavor is very good, but my sauce turned out quite thin.  I had difficulty while stirring in the evaporated milk.  There seemed to be a crusty coating on the bottom on my pan that just wouldn’t incorporate into the sauce.  So to remedy that I put the sauce back over low heat and that enabled me to get my sauce totally combined.  The flavor of this is excellent, but I wished it had been a little thicker.  I’d also be tempted to add more pecans.  I’d make this again and maybe cut back a little on the evaporated milk in the hopes of getting a thicker sauce.

Excellent recipe - a bit grainy before milk was added but I used the electric mixer and it turned out lovely and smooth.  Added a splash of rum....yummm!

Wow is this good!!!  I wasn't sure how it would turn out because it was so gritty.  Then I added the milk and vanilla and used my electric mixer and it smoothed right out.  SOOOOO yummmy!  Thanks for sharing this recipe! :)

This is SSSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOO good.  Even though mine didn't turn out, it was really runny (all my fault), I poured it over my vanilla ice cream and it was absolutely delicious.  Even better than the store bought caramel.  I probably could've just drank the rest MMMMMMMMMMM.

This sauce was fabulous! I omitted the nuts and served it warm over a blondie brownie with vanilla ice cream. It was a big hit with both adults and kids.

It hard to rate this since I used 3/4 cup of fluff instead of marshmallows. Not sure if my issues I had were because of that or not. But taste it is delicious! It is a little thin but just perfect for topping a cake bread pudding or ice cream would never call it runny! But it isn't thick enough to dip an apple into.  It might be thicker if I didn't use fluff?The other thing I did differently is after I added the milk it does look like it seizes but I kept it on warm and just stirred with the whisk for about 10 minutes and it turned smooth and yummy!

I really enjoyed this topping.  I made it 3 times before it turned out right.  The first time, I couldn't get it to boil and ended up overcooking.  The second time, I didn't boil long enough and lacked enough caramel flavor.  The third time, I was able to boil for 2 minutes and added the milk immediately, rather than wait 5 minutes and it turned out great.  Good flavor and texture.

DEE-licious! Like gourmet caramel sauce from a fine restaurant. I used walnuts rather than pecans and it was perfect!

This tasted really good -- however -- I had quite a bit of trouble with the recipe.  I cooked my brown sugar/syrup mixture according to the recipe, cooled 5 minutes and then poured in the evaporated milk.  I blended, and blended...and blended some more and it never came together.  Not wanting to throw away this pecan sugary goodness I put it back on the stove in hopes that it could be saved.  I turned it on med/high heat and let the chunky sugar pieces dissolve.  Then, it was too runny :o(  I threw six more marshmallows into the mix and finally, caramel-y, pecan goodness.  I give it a four for taste and a two for an easy to follow recipe.

The only drawback was having to use the blender to blend the sauce after adding the evaporated milk. I used rum instead of vanilla and this is truly delicious. I'm drizzling it overtop fudgy brownies served with vanilla ice cream.

Wow. This is soooo creamy, buttery, caramelly, and yummy! I didn't have any large marshmallows, only mini ones, so I used 6 mini marshmallows for 1 large marshmallow for a total of 96 mini marshmallows! Not sure if that is right or not, but it was very good!

Fantastic! Seriously, this may be my favorite recipe of all-time. I had to make a few interesting changes based on what I had and what was available... first, I didn't have large marshmallows so I substituted with the little ones, estimating that a scant 1/3 cup would equal 1 large marshmallow. Second, my food co-op doesn't carry corn syrup but they gave me some brown rice syrup that you can substitute (worked like a charm and its so much healthier and tastes way better). Third, I did not add the vanilla. Note: you need pay really close attention when making this to get the boiling and stirring just right... I used a wisk when I added the evaporated milk and that worked well, you have to stir for a long time to get it smooth... just keep going! I've used it in the following ways: punch 15 holes in a chocolate cake and pour over the top while still warm, add a few spoons to a cup of hot apple cider (fresh is best!), over pancakes with cooked apples, coffee, and of course ice cream. Really, I cannot say enough good things about this one, I'm a caramel junkie and this recipe takes the cake... thank you so much for sharing!

Excellent! I used part of this for the CARAMEL APPLE BARS II, also from the AR website, and the other part as topping for a huge bowl of Schwan's vanilla ice cream (our family fave). I did have to return the pan to a low heat after adding the evapo milk, just to get the suagr clumps to dissolve, but it was worth the trouble for sure.

Letting this cool for 5 minutes before adding milk is a mistake in my opinion. It got kinda stiff for me and when adding the milk later it turns into a soupy mess meaning you have to add more marshmallows. I thought hey I can do this, maybe others just did something wrong. Nah. To be such a simple recipe, it doesn't come together correctly. I have never rated anything low as fare as preparing anything goes but I have to rate it a 1. But the taste is alright, I expected more from the reviews which is why I chose to try this. So I give it a 2 for taste. Not as rich as I was hoping for. Just not what I was looking for so I will look for a different recipe that meets my expectations.

This recipe is pretty easy, you have to make sure that the sugar is melted pretty well. Just follow the directions to the mark. For an added treat add some rum flavoring. I made this for our public school, for Bananas Foster on Fat Tuesday Feburary 20, 2007. **very good sauce**

This is a fabulous topping and was very easy to make.  As usual, I read all the reviews first.  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't have any trouble with it being grainy and too thin.  I added the milk a little at a time as one reviewer suggested and that worked perfectly.  The taste was excellent - I don't like a really strong caramel flavor and this was perfect.  Great Christmas gifts!

Great recipe! Other reviewers complained that it was too runny and hard to mix in milk. I found that if you only use a 5 ounce can of evaporated milk and whisk the milk in slowly, adding just a little at a time; the milk blends in easily and the consistency is perfect! Like many others, I omitted the pecans.

I have been on a caramel kick this Christmas and decided to try this caramel sauce.  I doubled this receipe and added the milk hot as a reviewer suggested.  It just didn't taste like caramel and was too runny.  Added more marshmallows and recooked it.  Turned out much better but not a keeper for me.  I'll fiddle around with caramel sauce until I find the perfect mix - and I'll share it!

Perfect just the way it is! I didn't change a thing. I had no need for a blender. I just constantly stirred with my whisk until it was smooth. I think it's better when cooled so that it's thicker and better on top of ice cream.

This is now my "go to" caramel sauce.  It was very quick and easy to make, had a wonderful creamy consistency and was a beautiful glaze for my pumpkin cheesecake.  I had left-over cream in my fridge which I used in place of the canned milk.  This rich, delicious sauce is makes a great topping for a variety of desserts.

Where is the 10 star button for this one??? This is sooo good!  I made this several times.  I even put it in jars to give as gifts.  I never put the nuts in it just in case of allergies.  I had no problem with it being thin or anything.  I add the evaporated milk right away carefully.  First time I did it by accident and since it came out so good I do it the same all the time.  Very yummy and I can't stop eating it

Very very delicious!  Wish it was a bit thicker, but followed everyones advice about using a wisk to blend it in.  Used fat free evaporated milk to save on calories.  Love the taste and will put in on top of apple ice cream I just made!

I had some trouble with this. I followed it exactly as written and when I went to stir in the evaporated milk, the mixture just hardened and I couldn't get the milk stirred in properly. I tried an immersion blender and that wouldn't work either. So, I put it back on low heat for a few minutes and it turned into a perfect consistency. In any case, it tastes delicious, so even though I had troubles, I will try to make it again.

This sauce is out of this world. I was making better than sex cake II form this site but I didnt have any caramel topping so my husband whipped this up and left out the pecans. Nothing short of fantastic. He had no problems with mixing the milk in after it was cool. I will never buy that jarred sundae topping again.

I did not have marshmallows so I used a jar of marshmallow creme.  The mixture was so thick and gooey I had a hard time deciding if it was boiling or not, so I may have undercooked it.  It turned out lighter than the photo so I probably didn't need the full jar of MM creme but it tastes delicious.  If you have heavy cream, there's a recipe under Sticky Date Pudding on this site that just calls for cream, brown sugar and butter.  It tastes just like this but is easier to make.

I used this sauce to go with the Chocolate Caramel Cheesecake from this site (I had forgotten the caramels). I didn't have marshmallows but it turned out wonderfully anyways. I doubled the pecans. I can't wait to try it on ice cream! Thank you Bea!

I don't know if I did something wrong....but this tasted more like brown sugar sauce.  Also, I only put in half the amount of milk suggested and it was still runny.  Sorry, not a keeper.

I was skeptical while I was cooking this, but it came out absolutely delicious. We poured it over apple pie and it was just scrumptious!
