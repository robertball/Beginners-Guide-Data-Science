I did a test batch of this (since the ingredients are very common and inexpensive), in anticipation of doing baked goodie tins for Christmas, and it turned out well.  I ran out of honey  while mixing up an earlier recipe, so I was forced to add 2 tbsp extra of corn syrup to substitute, but I have since bought honey and fully intend to use it when I make the next batch for gifts.  I used 1 tsp of baking soda, but I am thinking of splitting the difference on the next batch., which will also be coated in chocolate.   I also think I got it a second overdone, but that is the exact reason I wanted to make a test batch.  Candy is tricky and I wanted to have a little experience before I made things to give away to family.  Great recipe and very easy.  I don't usually watch the videos, but I absolutely did for this just to make sure I got it right.  I love Crunchie bars and was excited to try to make something similar at home with few ingredients.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. I found the video very helpful as I didn't quite know the stages of this candy. A candy thermometer is important as it took some time to reach 300F from a medium heat. This turned out just like John's photo. Quite attractive and very airy. It tastes good but just not my type of candy.

Simple recipe, clearly put. I used golden syrup (as per recipe suggestion) and farmer's market honey – the kinda stuff that comes in a twist-top Ball jar you get when going apple picking. I used a scant teaspoon of baking soda, I'd wager it came out to 1.25tsp? The flavor for me was spot on: a light cooked honey taste reminiscent of the crusty bits of a honey cake. I will make this again and will maybe experiment with other flavors.

This really is a fun candy to make, and as a fan of Crunchy Bars, I love this stuff! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautifully!  I went by colour rather than temperature, I just waited for that beautiful golden colour before adding the soda. I recommend you make sure everything is ready and you can immediately pour the candy into its dish. After a very quick whisk, as it begins to harden immediately, and to keep the big bubbles intact, you don’t want to touch it once it hits the dish.

I just made it with Morena sugar and substituted more honey for the syrup. Delicious! Next time I will make a double batch.

Great easy recipe, very delicately flavored of caramelized honey. I coated mine in tempered dark chocolate to gift to a friend, and will be making this for the holidays too.

I substituted water for coffee, and it turned out amazing! Definitely gonna try again with matcha and some fruit juice to see what flavors can be made.
Update: I tried with 1 teaspoon matcha dissolved in 2 tablespoons water. The color turned to yellowish green. The crunchiness is still amazing but the bubbles are somewhat grainy. The matcha flavor is definitely there. Next will be beet puree.

I've made this several times.  It comes out airy and crunchy.  The only negative is that once you get past the initial crunchiness, it sticks to your teeth - didn't work out so great when I took it to an event with a lot of older folks without their own teeth.
