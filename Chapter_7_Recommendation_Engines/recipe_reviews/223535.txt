This was so delicious! I was worried it would be dry but it was great. My husband loved it, and it is definitely going in the rotation!

It was delicious! My husband suggested using mint in place of the basil every now and then.

This was a quick and easy side to make for husbands lunch for work and during the summer. I did add more of the tomatoes but other than that I found it to be fine as is.

I really enjoyed this. I was looking for something quick and meatless for my "Meatless Monday" when I got home from the gym and found this recipe. I didn't have any tomatoes on hand and added some red onion but other than that pretty much exactly as shown.  I didn't even wait the full hour before having it because I was starving and it was still amazing!  I will definitely be making this again.

Easy, healthy, and cheap. Next time I'd add bell peppers or onion for a little  more flavor variety.

I could eat this once a week but my husband isn’t a chick pea fan unless they’re in hummus. Easy to creat variations from this recipe, but try it as written first.

This recipe is now my favorite.  We eat a lot of bean salads - all of them from All Recipes.  This one is  so very tasty, light, and easy.  I will put a bit less honey in it the next time I make it.  I also used rice wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  I also left out the feta cheese - I don't care for cheese in my salads.

We love this recipe. We often add chopped cucumber and we like to change it up by adding a bit of chopped mint sometimes.

Very nice. However I added a few more tomatoes and sprinkled curry powder on it. Picked up the flavor considerably.

I make this all the time in warm weather and my husband and I love it! You don't even need the feta for it to be delicious. And we only use 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil. Anyone who likes bean salads will LOVE this!

The only changes I made to this recipe was that I added a cup of couscous and since I didn't have red wine vinegar I added a 1/4c of rice vinegar and 1/4c of red wine. The end result was amazing! This has become one of my favorite recipes!
