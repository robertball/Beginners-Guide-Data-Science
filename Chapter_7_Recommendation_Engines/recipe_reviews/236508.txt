This one's a winner! Very fresh and bright flavor. The chipotles are a perfect addition! My chicken breasts were rather large, so I used 3 instead of 4. Instead of 2 cans of chicken broth (29oz) I just used 1 carton (32oz) which worked out great because this soup is pretty hearty. I ended up using 3 chipotle peppers, minced with 2 tbsp adobo sauce (about half the can). This made the soup about a medium spicyness.  Trying to use only the leaves of the cilantro is kind of a hassle, but I ended up using the leaves as best I could, with some stems too. One bunch seems like a lot, but the bunch I had was small-medium size, so it worked out well. I recommended starting out with half a bunch if yours is large, then adding more in if necessary.  Also, it's not really necessary to dirty a bowl just to mix the cilantro and tomato. Just throw it into the pot at the same time. The only addition I needed to make was a bit of salt to really bring out the flavors.  Such a simple recipe, but SO good! I can't wait to have this for lunch tomorrow! EDIT TO ADD:  This makes 4 HUGE servings! You could easily get 6 smaller servings.

The soup was delicious! :-) However, I don't like thin soup. So, I did tweak the recipe just a tad. I added flour to thicken it, and make the soup more filling. I also used 2 cans of diced tomatoes, instead of fresh ones. (I was pressed for time.) The chipotle flavor was amazing...especially with pepper jack cheese tortilla chips, and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich!!! ;-)

All of the reviews on this were positive, so I decided to make this soup! This was my first time working with canned chipotle peppers. I have to say...I wasn't a fan of the favor in this one. I've used chipotle seasoning for chicken recently and enjoyed it, but didn't find the same flavors in the canned chipotle peppers. !
