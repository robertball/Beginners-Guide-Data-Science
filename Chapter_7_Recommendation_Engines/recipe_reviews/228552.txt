LOVED this recipe. We left off the pecans and doubled the apples, but everything else was exactly as written. PERFECT! Tasted like french toast and bread pudding combo. Brought it to a work brunch and ended up giving out the recipe to all. Will never make "overnight french toast" any other way. Thx!

hmmmm how to review.I did have to sub almonds for the pecans other than that stayed true to the recipe. This would make an excellent bread pudding. That being said, it is WAY too sweet for french toast in our household. Thanks for sharing

I followed the recipe a week ago to test it before serving it to friends. We liked it, but it needed a few small changes for New Years Day brunch. The first time round there wasn't enough wet ingredients for the top layer of bread, which ended up dry and crunchy.  For my guests I added two additional eggs, sprinkled a little nutmeg between the layers of bread, and some on top too. Most importantly, I dipped the bread in the egg mixture before adding it to the casserole dish, to be sure the top layer was not dried out.  It came out perfect - moist, tasty, and beautiful. Our guests raved about the food, and everyone went for seconds - the most sincere food compliment I know.

I'm glad that I added this to our Easter Brunch.  I kept the nuts off because kids don't always like them.  I used one apple and pared off thin slices with the potato peeler to cover the entire bottom of the pan. After putting everything in the pan and topping with the egg mixture I thought it looked a bit dry (my eggs may have been a bit small), so I poured a bit of cream over the top of the dry areas.  I may add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the egg mixture next time, but it was delicious as written.  Thank you for posting the recipe.

Excellent. Made the night before (took 10 mins). My french bread was extra thick so I added 8 eggs, keeping the milk the same. Crushed pecans made this awesome. Next time I will double the sauce. Great recipe; thank you so much for sharing.

This is a delicious recipe!   I added a little more apple to make it pretty and just put one layer of bread instead of two but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  To me it is perfect.  The bread was a little crunchy on top but sweet and moist on bottom - perfect.  You can easily flip it over onto a plate when it's done to show the apples and nuts and make it beautiful, or just flip each portion out onto the plate when you serve.  I will be making this often.

Delicious! I chopped my apples, but that was my only change. I think next time I may add some cinnamon to either the apples or the egg mixture, just to bring out all the flavors a little more. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made this for company and it was a huge hit. I did make a few minor changes. I was out of almond extract so just used vanilla extract in its place. I also sprinkled the apples with cinnamon (approx. 1 1/2 tsp) and added 1 tsp cinnamon to the egg mixture. I added 2 extra eggs and dipped the bread before layering it and poured the extra egg mixture on top. It was perfect. This one is a keeper!

Made this for Christmas morning exactly per the recipe without any alterations and it was delicious!  The caramel didn't get hard as some reviewers mentioned.  It was perfect and gooey.  Will become a Christmas breakfast tradition.

This is a special treat every once in awhile. If you don't wait the hour the top gets crunchy which is a nice contrast to the rest. It's great either way.

Ok, I know it is not fair to rate a recipe if you don't make it exactly, BUT I was on vacation and forgot my recipe card and this was the closest thing I could find to the caramel French toast I make for my stepfather and he was looking forward to having it.  That said, I made it without the apples and nuts and I am adding my review in case there is anyone else out there who would simply like to indulge in caramel French toast.  After looking at many recipes, I knew this one would make a great caramel base, and it did.  Very sweet, very indulgent, very good!  I think I miscounted my bread slices and didn't want it dry so I added more egg and milk...don't  get distracted while counting bread slices, lol.

VERY GOOD!   I used an 8 x 8 glass baking dish and cut the recipe in half.  I tore the bread into large pieces so it I could cut it into squares to serve.  My only addition was to sprinkle the top with cinnamon prior to baking.   Made the night before and refrigerated made this an easy breakfast to pop in the oven.  Thank you mikeandjenn for sharing!  We really enjoyed it!

We loved this! I made this for an office breakfast, and it was a complete hit. I prepared it the night before and put it in the oven the next morning. I left out the pecans because of allergies, but I am sure those would make it even better. I did double the caramel sauce part of the recipe and added an additional egg. Have made it again for teenage boys since then.

Fantastic! Super easy, and very tasty! I used Texas Toast (thicker slices), and let soak for 1 hour before baking. Teen boys gobbled it up!

BIG FAN of this recipe!  The only change I made was to exclude the 1/2 tsp of salt, as my butter was salted.  Really, I would not change a thing.  Everyone loved it, and this will be something I make over and over again.  So simple, and a winner.

I own a bed & breakfast and this is a favorite of my guests. I sauteed the apples in a little water and added cinnamon and a sprinkle of sugar while they cooked. Delicious.

I liked this recipe. I used more apples and didn`t use pecan. Next time I will probably add spices (cinnamon, nutmeg) to the apples or syrup. This is a good and interesting breakfast recipe. Definitely will make this again.
