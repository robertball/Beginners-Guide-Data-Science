Oh my god you just brought back such good memories of my childhood with this recipe. I probably would have never found this. I remember eating this when I was about 7-8 years old. My mom would buy it for me after school. I remember the texture of the sauce (which must be the bread crumbs) however I dont remember the anchovies part. They probably just gave me a plainer version since I was little. Either way. I can not wait to try this and now I may even fly up north to get some from that same bakery! thankyou so much for posting this. Oh and one more thing. I remember parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. Is that part of the recipe?

Amazing,Amazing,Amazing! Best Recipe I've ever tried for Pizza. This is a great recipe for those who like a thick, soft, spongy dough. I  followed the recipe for the dough (refridgerated 24hrs though), and then made my own variety of pizza (pesto, tomato and red onion). I spread a little olive oil in a cast iron skillet, laid the dough in and pressed it to make big crusts. Baked at 500 for 10 minutes.

This one is fantastic, the only limits are your ideas for toppings. I have never enjoyed a homemade pizza any more.
