My husband suggested a Pinot Noir for the red wine as it wouldn't overwhelm the flavors, and it was a perfect choice! This dish was SO yummy. I would recommend pouring some of the leftover butter sauce that's in the skillet over rice. It made the rice taste like risotto!

I have been trying to like chicken thighs because they are more affordable than chicken breasts but they never came out this tasty. I think I was doing it wrong perhaps even eating undercooked chicken because I thought that's just how it is. This method works perfectly. I used the 50 minute cooking time and they had actually crispy skin and were both moist and entirely cooked through. You may use significantly less butter to make this but may have to make up the liquid with and extra 1/2 cup or so of stock. I used about 3 tbsps of butter. I didn't notice the missing 5 tbsps at all. Thanks for this recipe--I didn't just learn a new recipe but a better technique that feels like an accomplishment.

I only used 3/4 stick of butter and skipped sugar and salt and the juice turned out great. I would make it again.

Followed recipe exactly- The butter sauce was delicious, but the rest was an EPIC fail. Soupy, greasy, and the thighs were overcooked.

This is absolutely delicious! I used the sauce recipe as shown for 6 servings but I only used 4 thighs. Made jasmine rice and green beans to go with it and my husband loved it! Used a bit of the sauce on the rice.. this is a keeper for sure.
