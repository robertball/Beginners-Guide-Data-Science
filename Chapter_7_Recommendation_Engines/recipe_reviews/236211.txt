these  turned out really good. however I did not have enough  black pepper  or any cayenne so I used a bit of crushed red pepper, used seasoning salt instead & added Parmesan cheese.  I completely forgot about the cornmeal so I didn't use any of that. I've never made onion straws/strings/rings before but these were easy, tasty & even smells great

Loved these!  I pretty much went exactly by the recipe except used milk with a little vinegar added for the buttermilk, since I didn't have any.  Also I added a bit of garlic powder to the breading mixture.  These were so yummy and soaking them in the milk mixture really brought out the sweetness in the onion when you ate them with the crunchy breading.  I just used some regular yellow/white onions and they were perfect.  I served these on top of some mini burgers and we also ate some on the side.  They are very addicting!  Thank you for the recipe!  I will be making again and again!

Fantastic!  Works for mushrooms too!  The thinner the slices, the more flour mixture you will need.  One suggestion: remove onions from buttermilk and let come to room temperature so that you arent dropping the temp of the oil as fast.  I had to wait several minutes between batches for the oil to get back to 400.

It was good, although I did end up substituting some spices. All in all, I would recommend not putting in nearly so much salt as the recipe calls for, because it leaves a very salty aftertaste.

Made these tonight for ds and myself.  Followed the recipe as written as far as the ingredients go. The only thing I did differently was to give them a second dip in the buttermilk and a second dredge in the flour. These were so crisp and very tasty. I will definitely be making these again. Yummy!

Did not have any cornmeal, but these turned out great.  Served them up at a July 4th party and they were a big hit.
