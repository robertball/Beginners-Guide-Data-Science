This was so simple to make and absolutely delicious!  I couldn't believe how good it was!  The only thing I did differently was to turn on the broiler for about a minute and a half at the end of baking.  This roasted the pecans and they just melted in our mouths!

Wow, I was amazed at how perfect these turned out!!  I gave them out to several people as gifts and they have been raving about them since!  They were easy to place in containers and didn't crumble.  I personally did not think they were too rich, the chocolate teddy graham crust is what made them so awesome!   DELICIOUS!!

These are way to rich.  I would suggest 1) using regular grahams crushed 2) omitting the 6 crushed candy bars and 3) only use about 3.5 to 4 ounces of the toffee baking bits.  I found it hard to "evenly" spread a can of condensed milk too.

I submitted this recipe.  I thought I would add that I now bake for 25 minutes and prefer the end result. Thanks for all the great reviews:)

to "evenly spread" the sweetened condensed milk you have to drizzle it over the whole thing.

I used a package of regular graham crackers and I didn't add the heath-type bars.  It was very easy to make and tasted fabulous.  It's a new twist on magic cookie bars.

Delicious!!  Changed a few things.....baked at 350 instead of 325 and for 25 instead of 20 minutes.  It was a huge hit.
