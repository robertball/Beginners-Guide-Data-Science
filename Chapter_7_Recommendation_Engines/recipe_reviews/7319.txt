Ladies BEWARE!!! I followed this recipe to the T! I ended up with a oven full of spill over chocolate cake and smoke detectors blaring at midnight. This is the LAST time I get a recipe off line. Use your best judgement!

This cake recipe was awful.  The cake was red with brown chunks throughout batter.  The cake was chewy and it did not taste like chocolate cake.  It tasted like red spotted vanilla cake.  Don't waste your time with this recipe.

This was a really good chocolate cake, very moist and delicious.  My whole family loved it.

I added a 1/2 cup of cocoa powder to this recipe and it turned out great.  For those of you who had problems with the chocolate clumping up, make sure all of your ingredients are room temp and you will have no problems.

Very easy to make and tasted great! Though I recommend going a little heavier on the chocolate if you're looking for that "decadent" chocolate flavor. I will use this recipe again.

Im only giving this recipe 4 stars because of the taste.  It is rather good not to sweet, not to choclatey, which brings me to wonder where the "double" chocolate cake name comes from.  However I would like to note this recipe is a "gummy/sticky" cake. when cooling it on the racks it stuck to them rather badly because of the sticky texture. And for anyone who owns a train cake mold for their little train lover, I will suggest this recipe, however do not fill over 3/4 full as it will rise to much, giving a fluffy bottom to your little train :) ALL AROUND 4 STARS THOUGH!!!

I do not care for a dark chocolate cake so this was great.   Also, one of the best one bowl cakes I have found - most of them use shortening. Another plus for this cake is that it does not use too much baking soda.   Please, please have all your ingredients at room temperature otherwise you will have lumps of butter and chocolate.   I do empathize with newer bakers because they probably did not realize that this is an absolute necessity (especially for one bowl cakes).  This cake does work!!!

This was just okay.  I made these in cupcake form instead of the cake.  I took them out and the middles totally fell.  Even after letting them cool for about an hour, I couldn't frost them without them falling apart.  Although their appearance was a disaster, they were pretty good.

Awesome cake. Those of you that got red with brown lumps, or all over the oven batter, Just leave out the food coloring and it turns out great. I've made this cake 4 times without a single problem. And I did not use the food coloring.

do not waste your time, this made an awful mess in the bottom of the oven and came out mushy, the liquid/dry measurements are way off.  I bake all of the time, and this was a big shock because I have never had a disaster like this one!

I did not care for this cake. I ended up with a red batter with chunks of butter or chocolate. I couldn't believe how much flour you need to put in; You should put in A LOT more.

Taste nice, but did not rise very much.   Overall a not too bad mix for a quick chocolate cake.
