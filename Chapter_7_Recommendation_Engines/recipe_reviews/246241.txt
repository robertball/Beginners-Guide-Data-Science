I ommited the package of gravy. I browned meat with fresh onions & garlic in few tabs butter. Used 1 cup beef broth,about 1/4 cup Korean Barbecue Sauce, little bit steak sauce,  1 cap marsala cooking wine and cornstarch for thickening. Came out delicious!

I made this exactly as directed but no Dutch oven.  Poured beef mixture over egg noodles and served with Italian seasoned red potatoes.  It was out of this world according to my husband and I enjoyed it very much as well.  Will definitely be making again. Next time,  I will add more liquid to increase the amount of gravy.

I only made half the amount because I cook for just two people. Based on other reviews I read, I still made the full amount of gravy, but it was too much for half the recipe. I did not care for the flavor of the gravy mix, so next time I will just thicken the cooked down rich broth. I agree with other reviewers who did not brown the meat for so long. I only browned it until all the outer edges were brown, maybe 5 minutes before adding the broth and braising it the rest of the cook time. I used sirloin tips and they came out very tender.

I wouldn't cook the beef on high, the meat brings to burn. I have a gas stove and I cooked the beef in between medium high and medium but it still turned out tough. I wouldn't cook it for so long. The taste was great, just the beef cooked for too long.

Made this for New Years Eve...delicious! The only thing I'll change for next time will to omit the salt and use a lower sodium beef broth. Other then that it was perfect!

My family wasn't too crazy about this. The meat was tender but I think it was the brown gravy mix flavor that they didn't care for.

We loved this recipe! My only suggestion is to double the gravy because who doesn't love gravy?

Winner winner dinner in my house! The only change I would make is more gravy because my family LOVES to drown food in gravy & sauce. Served it over rice.
