Apple Sandwich Haiku: "Cute after-school snack.(Although mine was for breakfast.) Bit messy to eat." In the end, I think I'd be OK w/ regular apple slices smeared w/ peanut butter and maybe sprinkled w/ a little granola for crunch, but this was still a fun recipe to try. Used a pouch of Larabar's cinnamon "Renola", and honey-roasted PB ground at Whole Foods, along w/ a chubby Gala. Didn't really measure, but I'm sure I hovered around the 1/4 c and 1/2 c called for. My daughter and I agreed that it was a little messy to pick up sandwich-style and eat, but as one would expect w/ this ingredient combination, the taste was delicious.
