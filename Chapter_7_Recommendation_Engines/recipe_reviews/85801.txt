Very very very good! There is this Cuban style place here in Corpus Christi called Havana Club and they serve tapas. Well, the food there is amazing and prepared by this awesome chef. They have arroz con pollo as one of the tapas, and it is my favorite thing to get there. It is so full of flavor like authentic arroz con pollo. Well, I found this recipe hoping to make it myself, and suprisingly it was very similar. Same great flavor and everything, except for this one had peas. I think the peas add a nice touch though. This is a very good recipe to make authentic arroz con pollo, so I suggest everyone give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.

Delicious! My hubby loved it also and said it's the best of my many attempts at making Arroz con Pollo.  I've been trying to duplicate the Arroz con Pollo that my friend's father made many years ago (he was Puerto Rican and made absolutely the best!). This wasn't quite it, but it was delicious nonetheless.  The only drawback was that, with the chicken just sitting on top of the flavorful rice, the chicken had no flavor.  I recall that my friend's father simmered his on the stovetop with the chicken mixed in among the rice and flavorings so the chicken absorbed some flavor.  I used frozen peas, thawed, instead of fresh peas.  My husband asked what the "crunchy things" were - it was rice that needed more liquid, so next time I'll increase the amount of chicken broth.  The rice would even be great without the chicken! Just the right amount of spiciness. Thanks so much!

This recipe was really yummy! I made a few changes and will make a few additional changes the next time I make it. I don't have a dutch oven so I let all the ingredients boil on the stove top and then added it to a casserole dish and then finally added the chicken back in. Also, I used chicken broth instead of water at the end. Next time I will incorporate the peas, pimentos, and olives into the rice (just my prefernce) instead of putting it on top. Also next time I will marinate the chicken (maybe in Mojo) before browning it. The chicken was cooked perfectly but lacking some flavor. Overall it was really good!

So fake, I don't know if this is Cuban or Brazilian, but definitely not Mexican with all those peppers and olives....maybe Texmex.

This is really really good!!! Just remember it does get a little "thick" adding a little chicken stock should do the trick. Really good

Soooo good! Eating leftovers right now! Hubby and brother-in-law (both fussy eaters) liked it too:) I made a few alterations to suit our tastes, and it was exactly what I was hoping for.    The alterations I made were:  (1) I substituted boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of the skin-on chicken thighs because my husband and I don't like dark meat (therefore I put the chicken into the rice instead of on the top of it before baking as I didn't want it to dry out) and  (2) I put a little less than half of the tomatoes called for and replaced with a proportionate amount of extra chicken broth so that the rice had enough liquid to cook.  The full amount of the tomatoes called for looked like it would be too much...   Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Was just the right amount of spicy (we like medium spicy food). Will make again and again.

This was excellent.  I used only 2 or 3 tablespoons of olive oil to sear the chicken, which I had seasoned first with Creole seasoning.  I added 1/2 teaspoon paprika and a little parsley, 3 cloves garlic and substitued tumeric for saffron.  I used 1 cup frozen peas and 1/2 cup wine in lieu of water.  Delicious.

Made this last night. I left out the jalapenos because the kids do not like hot. I did have a hot pepper that I cooked with the onions. I also added a can of pink beans instead of peas. This was a big hit. I would make it again.

This was delicious! The only thing I did differently was use a package of yellow rice that already had the seasoning in it instead of the white rice, salt, pepper, and saffron threads. I also used a jar of pimentos and olives that were already chopped. My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe.

I used Jasmine Rice instead of long grain rice. Rice was so overcooked. Be careful so as not to make the same mistake I did :(

I did not care for this recipe. I have had spanish rice before and it was never this odd tasting. I found this recipe to be a dissappointment and here is why: The whole tomatoes. The whole tomatoes ruined the dish for me, making it very tomato-ey which did not taste good. Also there was no specifics on how to season the chicken. I know that the seasoned chicken is a major part of the flavour and was dissapointed. overall a bad recipe for spanish rice if you are looking for an authentic taste.

This is a great recipe for a cold day, but not heavy. I like to use white wine instead of water and prefer to simmer everything on the stovetop instead of transferring to the oven. It's also good with crab instead of chicken -- even the "fake" crabmeat is good for a lighter alternative.

Absolutely great recipe! I ended up using curcuma instead of saffron (didn't find any that night) and added a bit of cumin to the rice. The chicken I mixed in with the rice instead of leaving it at the top and this meant a lovely flavor to the meat, too. While the dish was in the oven I added about a bottle of beer to it, for some authentic taste. Before serving, I generously added dashes of Maggi seasoning sauce (google it, it's too complicated to describe; I've been told by a Cuban friend that they use it a lot at home). It worked out just fine and got rave reviews from my guests who'd tasted the real thing before!

Fabulous flavor and super easy preparation!  I was on a small cooking frenzy today and also make the "corned beef for sandwiches" recipe from this site.  When that meat was done, I threw cabbage, potatoes and carrots in the cooking broth while the meat set-up wrapped in foil.  Well dinner tonight was a cross cultural event.  We has this wonderful arroz con pollo, but the side dish of vegetables was the cabbage, carrots and potatoes from the corned beef!  Anyhow, it all tasted great!  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

I followed this recipe down to a tee and it was delicious.  The rice had a lot of great flavor.  As the chicken rests on top of the rice for cooking, it didn't have a lot of flavor but I really liked the skin's texture.  I think next time I repeat this dish (and I will), I will brine or marinate the chicken for extra flavor.

My family loves this recipe - I make it every other week!  For more flavor, I add a packet of Sazon seasoning and a few drops of Maggi while cooking the rice and I add capers with the olives,etc. at the end.  AMAZING and AUTHENTIC!

Tried to make as posted, found it to be too dry and had to add an extra cup of chicken broth.  Chicken was pretty flavorless; likely a simple marinade would solve this. Also, would most likely omit the green olives next time - too salty and did not leave a desireable flavor pairing with all the other ingredients.

This is fantastic as is, but the second time I made it I added a diced seeded jalapeno when I added the rice and I used white wine in place of the 1/2 cup of water.

Very good. A little too salty for my taste, so next time I will reduce the amount. I used skinless thighs.

After living in So. Florida for over 20 years I've had several homemade Chicken and Rice dishes and this one is up there with them.  I did add some additional seasoning and I used left over chicken from the night before.  I pulled the meat from the bone and just added it to the rice mixture before putting it in the oven.  For this reason I did not have to cook it as long and it was very easy to make.  Everyone loved it.  It's a keeper.

Made this for the first time tonight. My husband loved it! The chicken was so tender you could shred it with a spoon! Make sure to remember that you are only browning the chicken in the first step, not cooking it thru.
