OMG, I looove this this cheese ball!!! I make cheese balls all the time for parties because they are easy and who doesn't like cheese! :) This is by far the best cheese ball recipe I have found.   If your not familliar with caraway seeds, they are very flavorful and are similar to the flavor of rye bread. I used extra virgin olive oil & some cabernet I had instead of the sherry. I also added an extra TSP of caraway seeds inside of the ball and rolled it as I always do in a mixture of walnuts and fresh chopped parsley. I made mine for a halloween party so I also added a few drops of red dye which gave it a fancy port-wine look.   This cheese ball got devoured at my party and received many compliments. Delicious! Thank you!!! :) ;)

This was very well-received. I halved the recipe but used 8 oz. cream cheese and 10 oz. sharp cheddar that I grated myself, and I omitted the oil. I also rolled it in a combo of caraway and walnuts, because I ran out of caraway seeds, but I wish I'd had enough of them because the way it looks in the picture above is so unique. I would definitely make this tasty cheeseball again, or I would run with the idea of adding caraway seeds to my usual recipe. Thank you!

I made several different cheese balls for a large holiday party and this one went FAST!  Yesterday, I made this again and didn't have Dijon, so I used horseradish..very tasty. I also used a mix of caraway and parsley to roll it in, just for color. Thanks for sharing!

This was good.  I put an extra teaspoon of caraway inside the cheese ball, but thougt rolling it in more caraway would be too intense so instead I rolled it in chopped nuts and parsley.  Good flavor and very easy to put together.

This was an easy, unique, and delicious cheese ball. Very rustic in flavor; if you are ambivalent about caraway, though, this is not for you! The flavor is intense. I think next time I would use a very sweet ruby port instead of the sherry.

This was my first attempt at making a cheese ball. (Always wondered how they were done.) I found this to be a very easy recipe and it turned out really well. The cheese ball received numerous compliments as well.

Fantastic!  Great recommendation.  I'd never made a cheese ball before either, did put a bit of extra Caraway into it, and made it at Thanksgiving.  Everyone ate so much they almost didn't eat any turkey!

This was very popular with the guests that liked Caraway seeds.  I did modify it a bit by putting only 2 tbsp of caraway and 1 tbsp of poppy seeds around the ball.  But this is a very very good ball of cheese.

I made this to put in my son's birthday food basket.  I didn't have any dry sherry but I did add pinot grigio, a dry white wine.  I also had some poppy seeds which I added a tsp. to the coating.

This came out quite well. Definitely popular at the party and I'll be making it again.  The only change I made was using ruby port instead of sherry.
