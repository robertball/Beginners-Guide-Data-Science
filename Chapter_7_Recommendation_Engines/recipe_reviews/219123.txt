Good recipe, but don't be too heavy handed with the thyme.  We followed the recipe - substituting garlic powder for fresh garlic and we liked it, but when we make it again we won't put any thyme at all and it won't be missed.

These were amazing!!!!!  I added the bread crumb/cheese mixture right from the beginning and it formed a nice crunchy crust on top (and unfortunately burned a little on the bottom).  Next time I'm going to turn the heat down on it a bit and see what happens.

This was a good, solid recipe.  I used real butter because I am a butter snob and probably 1/2 t. of rosemary instead of 1 t. (did not measure).  I also added a little salt.  The cooking time was longer for me - probably a full hour - even though I used a food processor to slice the potatoes thinly.  My family enjoyed the dish.

Really good recipe! Just for something different, I added some ham, and some french fried onion the last 20 minutes of cooking.

Creamy! I added 1# Ham steak and used basil instead of thyme, I also used a provolone/mozz blend in place of cheddar. I'll be making this again and again.

Nice concept, but needed tweaking ... maybe just for our taste. Potatoes needed much more time, too al dente as written.

Have made better scalloped potatoes with more of a cheesy creamy sauce.

Best ones I've made so far. Didn't have to make any changes.
*Update: Really great recipe - have tried it a couple times now, both as is, and by experimenting a little. Last time, I used Herb & Garlic shredded cheese with a touch of Philly instead of cheddar, used parsley flakes instead of thyme, and omitted the garlic & onion. It was truly delicious. The ONLY thing I'm trying to figure out with this recipe is how to make the cheese not so 'burnt' like on the top (we prefer a more gooey texture than a golden crust).

By far my favorite scalloped potato recipe. I use butter instead of margarine and add garlic.... so yummy!

Best scalloped potatoes I have ever had... They were so delicious. All the right falvours together mad for a side dish that turned into the main course for most!!!!! Loved it!
