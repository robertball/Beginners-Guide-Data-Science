This is a definite keeper! Although I served this as a side dish with chicken, it would easily stand alone as a main course. I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8 casserole dish.

I changed it by adding 2 grilled chicken breasts as well. My husband says it wasn't cheesy enough for him. I think it needed more flavor-maybe some garlic and rosemary would have been good. A good start though:)

this was delicious, a little time consuming but good. I added about a cup more cheese by the way.

Delicious! I topped with some panko crumbs mixed with melted butter (a little trick I learned from "Chef John's Mac & Cheese" from this website). 
I also used more Parmesan cheese on the bottom. I made a Parmesan basket with coursly grated Parmigiano Reggiano, a little trick I learned on a Princess cruise last week.

Great recipe!! I made it almost exactly as it's written- only very small changes- used macaroni instead of penne and yellow instead of white cheddar. I thought it was excellent and have been eating leftovers for lunches. My husband wasn't real crazy about the thyme, but that's a personal flavor issue. He said other than that, it was delicious! We both really liked the bacon and I believe including the bacon drippings in the sauce made the whole meal meld together well-- the bacon flavor really added something to traditional mac and cheese! It did take me about an hour, even before baking, but it tasted great in the end. Thanks for the great recipe!

Had bacon to use and found this recipe.  I chose this over the other bacon mac recipes because the onions are fried in the bacon fat, which makes sense to me, especially if you want to add more bacon flavor aside from the crumbled bacon itself.  Came out rather good!  I think it might also be good with smoked cheese and sun-dried tomatoes.

Loved by our family. I added green peppers and topped with crushed croutons. Definitely will make this again.

This is an excellent recipe.  I made some modifications for my family's  Thanksgiving meal:

- Used 1 lb hot sausage instead of bacon
- Along with the white cheddar, I added some fresh shredded Parmesan cheese and shredded italian mix
- Topped with about 3/4 cup panko mixed with: smoked paprika, garlic powder, cumin, sage, and grated parmesan
- Instead of thyme, I seasoned with smoked paprika, sage, cumin, and garlic powder.  I did not add any salt because of the amount of salt both in the sausage and cheese.

It was DELICIOUS!

I've tried out a few bacon-onion mac & cheeses. This was pretty good. I like mine to be a bit more zippy, so I think next time I would add mustard (I like dijon, but you could also add just mustard powder too). I did use less bacon than called for, but next time I would use more. I also just left the bacon in the whole time the sauce was cooking and it was fine.
