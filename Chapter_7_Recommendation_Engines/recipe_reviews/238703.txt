I love Panera chocolate duet cookies!  These are not exact but pretty darn good.  I made my first batch following directions but when they came out of the oven they were flat and I knew they needed to be a little more cookies.  I scooped out almost a 1/4 of dough for each cookie and baked them 14-15 minutes and they were perfect!

The texture was good, but the chocolate flavor was lacking.  There needs to be melted chocolate in the dough to achieve the chocolate flavor of the Chocolate Duet Cookie (it's a component of the Panera cookie, per the published ingredients).

Make sure you use DARK cocoa powder for this recipe. It makes for a much richer cookie in appearance and taste. I used Hershey's cocoa special dark.

We thought these were a cross between a cookie and a brownie.  I used quite a bit less white chocolate chips and increased the chocolate chips, just a personal preference.   They were delightful little chocolate morsels.
