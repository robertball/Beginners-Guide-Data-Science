The pork was VERY tender, and while I thought the sauerkraut was a little too dominant, my boyfriend absolutely loved it. He ate about the biggest helping of this I've ever seen him eat. If I made it again I'd use more apple and less kraut. Though since the recipe is called Kraut Special, I should've been expecting that.

Excellent...but don't forget some salt and pepper. That tea does something wonderful to this dish.

This was so easy and so tasty!  I actually didn't have enough time to do it in a slow cooker, so I put everything in a dutch oven and cooked at 400 for about 30 minutes (til the meat thermometer registered 145 degrees).  The whole family enjoyed it!

This afternoon, I took some of the leftovers, added chicken broth and a spoonful of brown sugar and voila!  a delicious warming soup!

I actually have an apple peeler that I use, which makes the apples sliced instead of diced. Likewise with the onions. Strips are nicer as you bite! The recipe somehow converted to everything being diced. I dont dice anything!

Excellent dish for the New Years tradition.  No peach flavored tea so used some Craisins.  Also added some thyme to flavor the pork.  Had to go out to store to get apples so added after first 2 hours of cooking and cooked to perfection.  The juices of apple and craisins really added some great taste.

This was a good one. I did skip the tea and instead subbed in a tablespoon or two of peach jam.  I thought the tea would have been just too much liquid but the peach, apple, onion add a nice complexity to the sauerkraut.  This is a keeper.

Super easy set up and while I usually shy away from sweet + pork dishes, this one had a great balance. Delicious.

Oh wow this is so incredibly easy and delicious.  My picky eater boyfriend also just LOVED it.  I cut the onions up in a "large dice", more like chunks, and cut the apples in slices.  I forgot to peel them and they were wonderful even with the peel.  I used Diet Snapple Peach Tea.  Really delish.

Love this recipe! It's a nice twist to a classic meal. The tea and sugar takes the bite out of the sauerkraut but still maintains enough sauerkraut taste. I eyeballed most of the ingredients with a 4+ pound roast which filled my crockpot to the brim. Everything turned out great! Served over homemade mashed potatoes.

The pork did turn out well, nice and tender.  However the sauerkraut was too strong and overpowered everything else.  I did make sure to drain the sauerkraut before adding to the slow cooker, but it probably would be good to also rinse it.  Additionally, Bavarian sauerkraut (milder, sweeter, and has caraway seeds) would be better than plain/regular sauerkraut.

So simple and so good!  I will be putting this in the menu rotation as we love pork chops and this is a yummy way to fix them.  I was not able to to find peach ice tea so I used a mango/orange drink.  It was good, but would be better with the tea.  Next time I will brew some as I have peach tea.

Loved the sauerkraut this way! The pork turned out slightly overcooked but it was because our slow cooker seems to get too hot on high. We will definitely do it again but will cut back to low after three hours.  With leftovers, we made South Philly Italian style pork sandwiches with broccoli rabe, provolone, and long hots. Outstanding!

This worked great!  I always have trouble with pork that comes out dry.  This pork was juicy and the peach tea and sauerkraut gave it a sweet and sour flavor.  I drained the sauerkraut a bit but not all the way.  One suggestion, make sure the pork roast does not have too much marbling of fat thru it.  Trim it up before you put it in the crock pot.

I followed the recipe exactly and did not enjoy the kraut at all.  The pork was delicious but the kraut was TOO sweet for my taste.  I even halved the sugar and it was still too sweet.  Perhaps I'm just used to more sour sauerkraut.
