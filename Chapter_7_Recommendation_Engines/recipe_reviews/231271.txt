I tried this recipe for dinner, but made one change.  I didn't have angel hair pasta, so I used whole grain linguine.  It was great! 
My husband doesn't normally care for dishes containing pasta - but he had 2 helpings of this one and wanted to know when I was going to make it again.  Thanks for sharing!!

I liked the creaminess of this dish, although it could use a little more seasoning. I would make this again, adding some seasonings, maybe garlic salt?

Nice cheesy comfort food .  I realized at last minute that I didn't have any cream of chicken so I used cream of celery instead. Husband said to give it 5 stars.

I used elbow macaroni and added a little hot sauce/dijon mustard. One can of cream of chicken soup was plenty for me--honestly, because that was all I had on hand. I also mixed the cheese into the casserole ingredients as well as sprinkling a good amount on top. (I don't usually measure the cheese only because......we'll, I'm not a cheese measurer.) I actually mixed all the ingredients together and dumped it into my crockpot right before I left for work. A couple hours in the crockpot was plenty to heat the ingredients through and melt the cheese. This is a great way to make shortcut macaroni and cheese. NO leftovers.

It tasted ok. Nothing great. Rather bland.  Sorry, but it isn't something I'll make again.

Wonderful, satisfying and filling. Very much comfort food. I made very few changes just to please my own tastes. But it would be perfect as is. I threw in some paprika, some dried chive instead of onion, used one can cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom, extra Worcestershire. Loved it. It was our New Year's Eve dinner.
