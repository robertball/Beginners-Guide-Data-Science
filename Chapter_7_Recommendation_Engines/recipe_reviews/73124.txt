I made this last week, and I decided after contemplation, that it would be simpler for me to do the entire recipe in an electric skillet, and boy was I right. :)  I browned the patties and then added the soups, etc, and let it all simmer covered for about 15-20 minutes.  It was so easy, and so good, though a bit salty.  Next time, I will only use half of the onion soup mix, and low sodium soup.  I only had one dirty pan to clean, so to me, it was awesome this way. :)

Excellent recipe. My husband loves this meal. The only change I would make is to use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken. Both hubby and I didnt care for the recipe when I used the cream of chicken (didnt taste like salisbury steak). Added chopped onion to the mixture for added flavor and use ground SIRLOIN--it's the best. Also, Country Crock now makes mashed potatoes you can buy in the refridgerator isle of the grocery store, they are kind of expensive, but they are sooo good. Makes the meal even easier since you can microwave them! Goes great with the salisbury steak!

This recipe was really easy and very tasty.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it was a bit salty.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I will use low sodium soup and quarter some potatoes to help with that.  I browned the hamburger patties the night before.  Then the next morning threw it all in the crockpot and was off to work.  Thanks for the post.

This is fantastic salisbury steak.  By far the best I've ever had.  I cut the recipe in half and only made 4 patties.  I omitted cream of chicken soup and substituted a jar of beef gravy.  I also added an entire package of sliced baby portobello mushrooms.  The sauce turned out wonderful but the patties were even better!  Served with egg noodles and green beans.  Thanks!

What a great recipe! I used extra lean ground beef and beefy onion soup mix along with the Italian breadcrumbs and milk to make the patties. For the sauce I used two cans of reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup mixed with the whole packet of au jus and water... came out perfect, not too salty. My two boys and my husband really ate this up! Thanks for a keeper!

I have been cooking for 35+ years and this was fabulous!  My husband and kids (who are very picky) cleared their plates and said I could make this "Anytime"!  I made mashed potatoes to go with this dinner - yum!  I used 1/2 of the dry onion/mushroom soup mix so it would not be too salty.  But it is MUCH BETTER with the CREAM OF CHICKEN then the Cream of Mushroom!!!  It may sound strange, but once you add the Dry Au Jus Mix to the Cream of Chicken, it turns it to a beef flavor, not chicken.  Instead of water I also added Chicken Broth.  Beef broth would make it too "beefy".  This gave it a very nice, smooth flavor.  I also added a Jar of Mushrooms (drained).  This is the 3rd time I've made it in a month!!  Very unusual for my household.  I also like it because it is so easy.  Don't over mix your beef mixture, that will make it tough.  If you handle with care, it will not fall apart.  I love it when I find recipes that are wonderful and cooked in slow cooker/crock pot.  =)

This was an excellent recipe.  This was a huge hit, everyone loved it.  I did not have aujus mix used 2 beef boulion cubes instead.  I did use the cream of chicken soup will try cream of mushroom next time.  Just because we like the mushrooms and that flavor.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Like other reviewers I changed up the recipe a little.  I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, used beef broth instead water, used gravy mix instead of aujus mix and added a few "glugs" of worchestershire sauce.  All 3 kids and hubby loved it and it was easy to make. Will make again.

I'd give this 5 stars except that I made so many changes. This is definitely a keeper! I read one reviewer that was annoyed at everyone posting their changes to the recipe but I have to say I find those reviews helpful and I'm glad people write down what they changed. I cut it in half since only two of us were eating it so I also only used 1/2 packet of onion soup mix. I added sliced mushrooms and onions. I used 1 can of low sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of the 2 cans of cream of chicken. I didn't have a packet of Au Jus mix so I used a can of low sodium beef broth. I added Worcestershire sauce to the meat. And I added my own secret weapon for gravy - Gravy Master. I love the flavor it adds to gravy! I served it with mashed potatoes and the gravy was So good the mashed potatoes were really only there as a reason to eat more of the gravy. I always thought Salisbury Steak was a lot of work. This recipe made it a snap - even on a work night. Thanks!

We made this last night and it was very good.  I made a few minor changes.  Due to the other reviews regarding the saltiness of the meal, I used half the italian bread crumbs and half plain.  I also used 1-1/2 cup water and added about 1/4 cup red cooking wine.  We didn't think it was too salty...nowhere near too salty, but I could see how others might.  Guess it depends on how much you like salt.  We made it with garlic mashed potatoes and the gravy was great over that as well.  We ate the leftovers today as sandwiches.  Very good.  We will make again.

This sounds wonderful, can't wait to try it.  Just a note for those who didn't want to use Cream of Chicken soup...I'm not big on the taste of Cream of Mushroom soup in dishes (seems like when I use Cream of Mushroom or Cream of Celery that's all I can taste).  I've discovered Cream of Onion soup which gives you another layer of onion flavor and the creaminess you're looking for but doesn't dominate with the mushroom or celery flavor.  It also works great when you're making meat free recipies.  Hope that helps someone, it did me.

This was very good.  We froze the leftovers and used our vacuum saver....and the leftovers were just as good.  Prep Time did take a little bit longer, but everything was great.  (As another reviewer said...you do have to use lean meat.)  Thanks for the post.

This is my favorite recipe from this site. I love meals that give you the feeling of down home cooking. And this one does. Great with old fashioned mash potatoes. And I made this for my sister when she was going through chemo and had no appetite. She is now healthy and makes it for herself and family. We both get requests for the recipe. Don't change a thing if you make it and you will be very pleased with the results.

I make this recipe a lot, but I double it to feed my large family.  Because I found it a bit too salty, I reduced the onion soup mix and the au jus mix by half.  It's still good, and brings the saltiness down to an acceptable level for me.  The recipe freezes very well, and if I'm in a rush I don't use the slow cooker, putting the patties & gravy in a baking pan and baking it in the oven at 350* for about an hour.  It's good that way too!
One other thing, I've found it helpful to brown the patties and then remove them from the pan, put them on a layer of paper towels, and let the grease drain for a few minutes before continuing on with the recipe.

i absolutely LOVE this recipe. i have made this about 6 times now. salisbury steak is one of my favorite meals in the world and this always hits the spot. i never make a recipe word for word and this time was no different! i live in OK and never have found an au jus mix so i just get about 4 beef bullion cubes and heat that up with the water, until the bullion has disolved and i also add A LOT of worcestershire sauce (thats the one thing this recipe is lacking!). i also switch the cream of chicken soup to cream of mushroom soup. if i remember i try and add a small can of mushrooms. this time i added 1/2 of an onion and it was great.  this serves 8? man i could eat this whole meal by myself!! ha

Thanks for a creative way to make great salisbury steak! I'm a "temporary" at-home dad, so I felt obligated to make some manly changes of my own: I used frozen hamburger patties (don't judge me), sub'd one can of cream of mushroom with the cream of chicken, and used a packet of beef stew seasoning because I didn't have au jus mix. Not even sure if it's still considered salisbury steak, but it was GREAT...green beans and mac'n'cheese rounded out the meal. If it came out too greasy for anyone, blame it on their choice of fatty ground beef--it's NOT the recipe's fault, sheesh...

For everyone that is saying that it is salty just make your own onion soup mix leaving out the salt. It is very easy and you can get the recipe just by googling it.

Add a few T worcestershire for good salisbury flavor; plain breadcrumbs and real onions instead of onion soup mix made this recipe just right and not too salty at all (as i read in other reviews).  i used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken and swapped one small can of beef consumme for the packet dry au jus and water combo.  Delicious! Making mashed potatoes right now... Will definitely make this again.

This was soooo great! Used the recipe as a model and took some others advice. Here is what made my daughter who doesn't eat beef unless it's in tomato sauce, eat 2 of these burgers!!!! I only used a little of the onion soup and just the powder and put in half a fresh onion finely chopped. Omitted the flour, because i forgot! and used cream of mushroom.Browned the meat on the stovetop and covered with gravy covered the pan and threw it in the oven for about 90 mins on 325*. So stinking good!! My husband said "i didn't know salisbury steak could be made thought it was just a frozen dinner"! HAHA! Thanks for the great base recipe!!! yum!!!

This recipe is our "go-to" for busy days. I've also used cream of celery, cream of asparagus, and cream of mushroom soup, in different combinations, all very tasty. To deal with the draining of fat from the ground beef, I cut up some potatotes and place on bottom of the slow cooker, then put the patties in a pyramid on top -- no sitting in a puddle of grease!

This same recipe can be made in one hour in the oven. I place the patties in a large cake pan, pour the soup mix (without the onion soup) on top, add parsley, onions....surround it with sliced potatoes and bake....the burger bakes in the oven. No need to brown it.

I made this for the first time and really enjoyed it.
I cooked it with half ground chuck and half ground sirloin. I did have to every once in a while take the lid off the crock pot and "skim" off the fat while it was cooking. I  too changed the cream of chicken to cream of mushroom and used a jar of au jus gravy instead of the mix. I will be making this often, the family really enjoyed it,, served it with mashpotatoes and green beans.

Recipe re-calculated for 4 servings.  I only scanned the recipe and did not see that it called for using a slow cooker...MY bad! Too close to dinner time to back out so used electric skillet, only had mushroom soup and used less than 1/4 packet of dry soup mix. Completed all in under 30 minutes.  Gravy was sinful over mashed potatoes! Totally deelish.  DH took it to work for his lunch and called home to tell me the aroma from reheating it in office nuker prompted a couple requests for the recipe.  Happy to oblige!  VERY good!  TY!!

I make this all the time - my family's favorite meal!  The only change I made was to substitute 2 cans of beef gravy instead of cream of chicken soup and I add 4-5 shakes of worcestershire sauce.  Tender and delicious, great with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli!

i used 1 jar of beef gravy instead of the au jux mix and water and low sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of crm of chicken.  i also threw in a few small whole onions, some baby carrots and about 8 small red potatoes (washed, skins on) at the beginning of cooking.  cooked it for 4 to 5 hours on low and everything came out perfect!  i didn't have to make anything extra, it was all in the slow cooker!  will definitely make this again!!

I thought the gravy was WAY too salty, half a packet of the dry au jus mix would help cut back on the salt.  The fat from the beef was difficult to separate from the gravy so I don't think I'll do this recipe in the slow cooker, it just isn't necessary and doesn't work out too well.  I also didn't like the looks of the dry onions in the beef, I will use real onion next time with some spices in place of the dry onion soup mix.**I made this again and omitted the au jus mix completely, used a leaner meat and pounded the dry onion soup mix so the bits of onion would be smaller and it was perfect!

I too used mushroom soup because it made more sense than cream of chicken and added 8 oz of mushrooms.  I was home, so I baked it in the oven at 300 for 1 1/2 - 2 hours.  My husband said this one is a keeper.

this was my first time to make salisbury steak and i was very impressed with how easy it was. i read other reviews and tips first, and since i didn't have all the exact ingredients, make a few substitutions and also cooked it on the stovetop rather than in the slow cooker and it still turned out great! i cut the recipe in half, using only half the onion soup packet. i didn't have the au jus or the cream soup, so instead i used a can of mushroom gravy and a dry packet of brown gravy (reduced sodium). since i forgot to half it and added the full packet of gravy mix i went ahead and added the full amount of water- so i had extra sauce which is never a bad thing! I also added fresh sliced mushrooms after browning the meat, when i added the gravies. Mine didn't turn out too salty the way i made it. thank you for such a versatile and delicious recipe :) it will be a new staple in our house!

I have never reviewed a recipe before (and I have been using this site for a long time).  This was so good.  I didn't change a thing except I grilled the salisbury steaks and used a low sodium soup; and then put gravy and steaks in a crock pot.  I served it with mashed potatoes.  My picky eater loved it!

Excellent!! The entire family loved it! I could not find dry au jus so I used a packet of brown gravy mix instead. It didn't seem to affect the outcome at all because it was delicious!! This will become a regular in our house for sure! I did not think it was too salty, and had no problems at all with it. I would definitely recommend! YUM!

Tasty, easy, economical but way TOO much sodium! Next time I will use dried onion instead of onion soup mix and omit the au jus mix. I also make home made cream of ??? soups that are much lower in sodium than the canned.  Fresh sliced mushrooms would be good in this sauce also.

Loved it!  Best Salisbury Steak I've had!!  Make patties night before and cuts the time even more!!  Easy with some modifications:   1 can low sodium cream of mushroom soup, one can golden mushroom soup, and fresh sliced (thick) mushrooms, makes 8-10 medium/small patties.  Suggestion...cook on low for 6-8 hours.  Served with brown rice and asparagas!!

My husband and my children have voted to have this recipe included in my monthly menu!

To reduce the saltiness I try to use low sodium onion soup mix or if I'm out of that I just use half of the regular au jus mix, it seems to balance out pretty well.  It can be pretty salty with both the onion soup mix and the au jus mix in the amount listed in the recipe, my husband LOVES it salty but the kids and I like it just a tad less so.

So glad I was able to find this recipe again! Like some other reviewers I substituted mushroom soup for the chicken and added sautéed mushrooms and caramelized onions to the gravy. I also used a jar of prepared beef gravy instead of the au jus mix and water. I know I made a lot of changes but this recipe was a great jumping off point and I imagine it's pretty tasty made as written.

Nice, easy comfort food for a brisk, fall evening.  My family, not being big on onions, felt that the onion soup mix was a bit overwhelming, so I would cut that down next time.  Other than that, this was enjoyed over mashed potatoes. Some fresh mushrooms near the end of cooking would be a nice addition.

3.5 stars.  According to my boyfriend, though he said this recipe was good, this recipe would also have potential to taste more like Salisbury steak if a few modifications were made.

I followed the recipe exactly as instructed.  As the steaks were being cooked in the Crockpot, I read a few reviews and later agreed that the sauce/gravy would taste better if a cream of mushroom was used instead of condensed chicken soup.  To offset the saltiness, I added 1 chopped onion to the gravy mixture.  In the future, with cream of mushroom soup being used, I would add fresh mushrooms to the Crockpot mix as well.

I served mine with roasted bell peppers and mash potatoes.  The gravy goes very well with the mash potatoes too!

I followed to a T, Exactly to a T. I really don't have anything to moan about other then it was really good, but could use a soup mix with less salt. I will go with what a friend suggested the next time by using the Beefy Soup Mix instead of the onion as directed in the recipe. But the meat was tender, flavorful, the gravy mix was really good. The recipe was fairly easy to follow. And the family was happy, 1 kid ate 3 all to herself. And preferred me to make this instead of meatloaf. Thank you, will totally make again.

I used cube steak and no breadcrumbs or milk.  Instead of mixing anything into the cube steak, I left that as is and added 1/2 packet of onion soup mix (didn't use the whole thing because of the concern of it being too salty) to 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken (both cream soups were reduced sodium) + packet of au jus mix and water.  I let it cook on low for 10 hours and it was fall-apart tender.  Delicious and just salty enough.

FINALLY, a good salisbury steak recipe that is straight out of the pantry.  I will NEVER buy a frozen meal again!  This turned out wonderful and since I was in a pinch I just simmered on the stove and it turned out wonderful!!!  Simply bc I used what was on hand, I used brown gravy pkg instead of au jus, and omitted onion soup mix, just added onion powder.  I am so happy for this recipe, I LOVE this kind of meal and I can't believe this turned out so good with plain old ground beef!!  *****

This is the first time I have tried a recipe that had not been reviewed. I am happy to report that this is NOT your TV dinner version of Salisbury Steak! We all enjoyed this for dinner, and I will certainly make this again! It is very easy to prepare, and is wonderful with mashed potatoes and green beans.

I made my own seasoned bread crumbs and only because I did not have cream of chicken soup, I used Cream of Mushroom. I did add some sliced fresh onion, fresh minced garlic and fresh sliced mushrooms to beef up the gravy a bit--I just sauteed the vegetables with a little butter and scraped up what I could of the pan drippings before adding it to the crockpot. The boys thought this was quite good. I served this with rice pilaf and roasted garlic broccoli. I'd make this again.

I have made this twice.  Once using cream of chicken soup and once using cream of mushroom soup.  We like the mushroom better. I too think this is salty but it is still great.  Next time I buy the dry onion soup I will try to find one with less sodium.  This will probably help.  i diluted the sauce by adding more water than was called for and I think this also helped decrease the saltiness.

This was a HUGE hit in my house!  It was my first attempt at salisbury steak and everyone loved it!  My 15 year old had seconds and made me promise to save the leftovers for him tomorrow.  I added a jar of sliced mushrooms and used cream of mushroom soup.  I goofed and forgot to buy au jus mix, so I used beef broth and added beef bouillon granules for some color.  It was great, thanks Tesslynn!

Edited 3/29/12 - I've made this SO many times now, and my boyfriend asked for it tonight for his birthday dinner.  A HUGE hit in my house, and super easy to make.  Thanks again!!

I have been making this for a few years now and it is so easy and simple yet so delicious. There's only 2 of us so I cut the recipe in half and I use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken soup. I also substitute 1 beef bouillon cube for the au jus mix. After cooking in the crock pot for 3 hours I add sliced fresh onions. During the last half hour I add fresh sliced mushrooms. A great meal served with mashed potatoes and green beans.

The first time I made this recipe my family found it too salty even though I used Healthy Request Cream of Chicken Soup which is less salty. I think the saltiness came from the dry mixes so I cut out the onion soup mix and added sliced vidalia onion and Healthy Choice Cream of Mushroom Soup for an onion flavor and 1/2 can of low sodium MSG free beef broth for the beef flavor. I still added the milk and this turned out delicious. I have a problem with MSG so those are better choices for me. I would highly reccommend this recipe with those changes for someone with migraine headaches that needs to avoid MSG. I will make this over and over. It is good with mashed potatoes and egg noodles. For those on a low cholesterol diet it can be served over "NO YOLKS" egg noodles and the Salisbury Steak could probably be made with ground turkey, however I have never tried it. I should pass this on to my mother-in-law because she makes everything with ground turkey since my father-in-law's heart attack.

I made this according to directions except I reduced the amount of Au Jus because others said the gravy was too salty. Boy, were they right! The gravy was very salty but I used a small amount on egg noodles and it was fine. I had tasted the meat after it was floured and browned in a skillet. The meat was delicious, however after cooking it for four hours in the crockpot the texture and taste of the meat changed so much and I did not like it at all.

Wasn't bad but wasn't great; just okay. Basically tastes like a meatball. I'm not sure if i'll make again.

Just like TrishDish, I also used an electric skillet. I think 4 or 5 hours in the slow cooker would definitely dry out the lean ground beef.  Also using low sodium soup is the only way to go.  I have gotten into the habit of using garlic powder, onion powder and/or garlic salt.  Campbell's Soup up here in Canada still makes 25% less sodium soups, but they still contain a rather high sodium content.  Instead of chicken soup, I used Knorr OXO Chicken bouillon which is also available in low sodium.  About 560ml which is just over 2 cups of water with the bouillon sachets and adding garlic powder, and onion powder along with a couple of garlic cloves.  Used some Canada Corn Starch to thicken it, and it is fantastic. I'm glad to hear that my American friends are using lower sodium  and becoming healthier.

We tried making it in the skillet per an earlier suggestion and it worked great. Kids loved it. Added an egg to the meat and cut out the flour because it wasn't necessary.

I just had to post a review on here about this recipe, cause I know how important the reviews are when it comes to picking a recipe. Well, this recipe was awsome. Couldn't have been better. I am on the Atkins diet, or was....I made the Salisbury Steak for my husband, becuase I "thought" I hated Salisbury Steak, but boy was I wrong! I have only had Saisbury Steak in a box, frozen. This recipe is so far from that. I just loved it. My husband said it was the best meal I have cooked in a while and wants it again. I told all my family about it and gave the recipe out 3 times already! Thanks so much Tesslynn! God Bless!

I fixed this recipe lastnight after seeing it on pinterest. I read the other reviews before I fixed it. I only used a half of a pack of the onion soup mix. I also used the low sodium soup and I added the beef broth to my mixture. I also used cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken. Something just seems kind of odd about having chunks of chicken in a salisbury steak. Also, I sauteed some onions in a skillet and added those to the crockpot as well. One more thing I did, I did't fry up the patties in flour, my husband said he didn't want them 'crunchy' so I just fixed them like I would a hamburger and cooked them fully before putting them in the crockpot. I'll definately be making this recipe again!! And thanks to all the ones who had previously put a review up about the recipe so I would know to make some changes as well!

This recipe was great!! I made a small change because I do not eat red meat. I made this with ground turkey and used my electric frying pan. The only thing I would change is I would double the amount of sauce when making it this way so that it does not all cook down. I will be using this recipe more!!

Now THIS is comfort food!
I mixed the milk and breadcrumbs together first to make a panade.  I didn't have Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, so I added 1 tsp dried Italian seasoning to my plain breadcrumbs.  Substituted 3/4 cup Johnny's French Dip Au Jus concentrate for the packet mix and omitted the water.
YUM!

Absolutely loved it. The whole family thought it was great. I did substitute a dry gravy packet for the au jus mix and plain bread cubed up with a few dashes of Italian seasoning (because that is what I had on hand) and it turned out wonderful. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!!

Used cream mush soup instead of Cream of chick (all I had at home) and will continue to use!  Then only thing I will do different next time is make the patties into MEATBALLS!  The presentation of the "patties" shrunk and looked like blobs! Still tasted great though.  I also quatered red potatoes and cooked high one hour to soften them, then back to low rest of time

I used low salt onion and chicken soup and instant gravy powder instead of the packet of dry au jus. Added a teaspoon of very lightly crushed peppercorns and stirred a tablespoon of light sour cream through a few minutes before serving. In a word: YUM! This was delicious, the meat was amazingly tender and the sauce over mashed potato was incredible. Might try it with cream of mushroom next time for something different, but will be hard to beat. This is Definitely going to be a regular winter meal!!

I have been making this for a couple years now and am just now reviewing.  This is a great recipe!  However, over the years I have found I prefer cream of mushroom soup over the cream of chicken.  I also concur with several other reviewers that this recipe is salty.  By replacing ingredients with the low sodium counterparts, it eliminates the problem without sacrificing taste.  Enjoy!

This is a great recipe!  I prepared on stovetop as recommended by others.  Just keep tasting that gravy and adjust to your own personal taste as to thickness, saltiness, etc.  I used beefy mushroom soup, replaced the water with beef broth, and deglazed the pan with red wine after frying the burgers.  Yummy!

This is an excellent crock pot recipe. I would rate it up there with pot roast and beef stew as one of the best recipes for using beef in the slow cooker. You really don’t need to change it to get good results, but I did make two minor tweaks: I used 2 cans of lower sodium cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic, and I added a package of fresh sliced mushrooms. I thought the mushrooms really added a lot to the recipe. Was fantastic served over garlic mashed potatoes!

I don't like changing people's recipes, especially when they are this good - but this has way too much sodium for us older folks. To modify it I omitted the onion soup and substituted chopped onion, used lower sodium soup, and instead of the au jus packet substitued a Herb ox sodium free beef boullion packet.  Delcious! Thanks for the recipe!

I was so excited for this meal and when I came home, the house smelled so wonderful...but the meat was not very appealing.  The gravy mixture was good, went well with mashed potatoes, but the meat was very disappointing.

I did it as you see the recipe all but used half ck soup half mushroom not as strong or salty.I only used about 1/2 -3/4 pkg soup mix. The gravy is a little light colored but I hate the dark gravy in the jars so I added a few drops of gravy master browning sauce to change the color but not the taste like the dark brown gravy mix does.Also added sauted fresh button Mushroom just before serving. Fantastic taste

Delicious!!!!  I browned my patties the night before as others had suggested.  My husband kept telling me that dinner smelled wonderful.  It broke my heart to tell him he had to wait until tomorrow.  I knew the next day would be busy, so I popped a couple of huge baked potatoes in the oven on delay start and started the crock pot.  The house smelled wonderful when I got home.   The only change I made was using Beefy mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken.  I also added a handful of fresh mushrooms as well.  Wonderful dish, I will be making this one again soon.

I only gave it 3 stars because the sodium count is over the top. I followed others' suggestion and used low sodium mushroom soup, and my own salt-free  home-made dry onion soup mix.  It was delicious and I liked making it in the slow cooker.

Yum~Yum. Made exactly as directed , hubby devoured it!Leftovers were even better the next day. This one is a keeper for my weekly menu. For those not liking the salty taste.....throw in a raw  quartered potato for the last couple hours...it will soak up the saltiness.

Excellent. I used 3 tsp of Dried Brown Gravy Mix instead of a packet of dry au jus mix. I cooked it in my trusty old crockpot for 6-8 hours on low. Served it with a Broccoli Salad and hot biscuits. Wonderful.

I had to tweak it a bit. Instead of cream of chicken I used one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of mushroom with garlic soup. It gave the sauce a much better flavor.  Sometimes I throw in some extra mushrooms if I have them. I make this all the time and it’s a hit with everyone in my house, from my 90 year old grandmother to my toddler.

Ended up with Cream of Mushroom soup instead.  Couldn't find Au Jus packets so I used Au Jus gravy and didn't add the water in to make the gravy.  Worked out just fine.  This recipe will be back in the future.

I love this recipe. The meat patties have such delicious flavor and the whole thing is so easy to throw together. The only suggestion that I have is to use low-sodium cream of chicken soup. It's great with the regular soup, but using the low-sodium soup will make it a little less salty and a smidgen healthier. Thanks for the great recipe!

I had to adapt this for food allergy reasons and to reduce the sodium and fat.  I made homemade cream of mushroom soup with no sodium added beef broth.  I used skim milk to reduce the fat.  I used (1) no sodium added bouillon packet and added no sodium added broth instead of water.  I browned the patties and baked them (covered) in the oven for 350 F for one hour.  Absolutely delicious!  DH wants this for his birthday dinner.

This recipe came out GREAT! I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception that I added a few glugs of Worcestershire sauce to the meat, and added some sliced mushrooms when I put the patties in the crock pot. Soooo good with mashed potatoes and broccoli! :-)

Loved this recipe.  Hubby said it was a "keeper". As others suggested, I used both cream of chicken soup and mushroom soup.  I added a teaspoon of chopped garlic to the soup mixture and because I like my beef gravy dark, I added a few shakes of kitchen bouquet too.  In addition to the onion soup mix, I added a chopped onion to the meat patties.  I like getting a nice bite of onion in my salisbury steak.  There are only 2 of us, so the first night we had mashed potatoes.  Served it with rice the second night.  Yummy both ways.

This was so easy to make and was fabulous.  The gravy was amazing and if you want to win over your man's heart (or stomach) than make this and serve with mashed potatoes.

Really enjoy this meal.  I had been looking for a Salisbury Steak recipe for a long time and this is super easy to throw together.  So far everyone I've made it for loves it and there's rarely leftovers.

This recipe was amazing.  I substituted the water for beef broth and added a whole package of slice mushrooms.  I was never a big fan of salisbury steak but my husband was so I would buy him the frozen Encore ones.  After making this I am a fan of salisbury steak and my husban will never let me buy the frozen ones again!!!  I will be making this again tonight for dinner and Im doubeling to make sure there is leftovers!!!!!!!!

I love this recipe!  I've made it twice.  The first time, I thought it was delicious but it was a bit salty for my taste.  The second time, I used low sodium mushroom soup and only used half the pack of onion soup mix and au jus mix.  I like it much better this way.  This is a keeper and it will become a regular in my house!

I made this for dinner last night and it was delicious. I didn't change a thing and the flavor was perfect. Just as other reviewers mentioned it was a little salty. I made home made mashed potatoes which minimized the impact of the extra sodium. Next time perhaps I'll use a few lower sodium ingredients. I will definitely make this again, maybe I'll try it with cream of mushroom soup just to see what the difference in flavor is, but it's pretty perfect the way it is.

I can't get over how fabulous this recipe is.  I made smaller, meat"ovals" instead of the bigger steak size and that was a big plus for my family, as we are not big meatloaf or salisbury steak eaters.  In fact, they were so delicious, I've had requests for them over and over!  First time I made it I used brown gravy instead of the Au Jus, but both were terrific.

Everything came together really quickly, not too difficult. Browned meat the night before and put everything in the pot the night before and put it in the fridge overnight and had my husband put it on in the middle of the day, since it only tood 4-5 hours. It was a little salty for my taste, but husband loved it, even saved the leftovers! Might try either low sodium cream of chicken or cream of mushroom soup next time, because there will be a next time. Adding this to our dinner rotation.

FANTASTIC!!! Halved the recipe, followed the proportions exactly, made instant mashed potatoes to go with. THIS IS PERFECT! Used cream of MUSHROOM soup as suggested by another reviewer as well as coarsley chopping a small sweet onion, used 1/2 onion soup mix in the meat, 1/2 in the gravy mix, skipped the au jous mix & it was great. I will be making this again and again and again and again! Extra sauce makes great gravy & put the browned patties on low for 4 hours.  **I've made this several times now & had to use Cr of Chicken, didn't turn out as well. Still good, but not GREAT.**

My family loved this. I took TrishDish's idea of cooking it in an electric skillet and it worked great! I used ground turkey, cream of muschroom soup and a brown gravy packet because that's what I had on hand. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans. Total comfort food.  I will definitely make this again.

This was great!!  I took some of the tips in the reviews.  First, I increased the recipe by half because I cook for teenage boys.   I used beefy onion soup mix in the meat, only 1 packet even though I used 3 lbs of meat.  I also used 2 cans of cream of mushroom, 1 can of golden mushroom, but only the 1 packet of au jus.  I also sauted 1 pound of sliced baby bellas and I med onion,  chopped, and added that to the sauce, also.  It was fabulous!!  The meat was so tender and juicy.  It was not at all too salty made this way.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

If you make it for four make sure you only use half the envelope of soup mix! Very salty because of that mistake. 

Overall though, very easy to make and very tasty.

This was fabulous!!!  I made half the recipe and was very concerned after reading the reviews that it was too salty, as I really have to watch my salt intake; I did use the cream of chicken soup low sodium.  I also took 10 oz. of baby portabella mushrooms and sauteed them with about a 1/3 cup chopped onion and mixed that with the soup/au jus mix.  Absolutely wonderful.  Tasted EXACTLY like golden mushroom soup, but only better.  This is a terrific recipe and was not too salty at all with the above changes.  Served over noodles along with some buttered peas on the side.  Thank you Tesslynn for a wonderful recipe.

Followed recipe exactly. Was very good - flavor, ease of prep. Next time, I might saute up some mushrooms and onion to add to the gravy at the end. Only thing that could improve it.

This is probably one of my all time favorite recipes that I've found on allrecipes. I normally don't like salisbury steak because of the texture. But made into a hamburger type form, I figured I would give this a try. The only thing I changed was I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. The meat was so tender and juicy and the gravy was delicious over mashed potatoes. My family loved it!!!

The gravy to this was wonderful! My family really enjoyed this recipe. I think I will play around with the meat part. I used cream of chicken/mushroom soup. (I like this combo) Thanks for the recipe, This one is the best in a few salisbury steak recipes I have tried.

Lets start off with the aroma in house when coming home from work... OMG. My sister in law and I both tried this recipe and by far was one the best we have ever gotten from allrecipes.  We used 1/2 packet of onion soup mix in the meat mixture and 2 can of low sodium cream of mushroom soup, 3/4 cup of milk and a 1/4 cup of water that we added to the au jus mixture. We also sliced up a medium  onion and added sliced mushroom to it!  Even my nieces and nephew cleaned their dishes and asked for more. Both our husbands raved about it and it is now a keeper for both of us.

This was fabulous.   I used, as others suggested, Cream of Mushroom soup in place of Chicken soup and a beef bouillion cub in place fo au jus mix.   My hubby loved it and thought it was even better when he heated up leftovers.

This was VERY good!  I only had 1 lb. ground beef so I halved the meat mixture ingredients but kept the sauce the same amount as I used it for a gravy.  My original thought was that the meat patties would fall apart in the slow cooker, but they held up VERY well, and were very firm at the end of the cooking process.  I browned them on our grill pan for nice taste and nice grill marks.  For the gravy, I couldn't imagine cooking hamburger in cream of chicken soup so I used 1 can brown gravy and 1 can cream of mushroom.  Very yummy, although I could not taste the au jus packet.  I may leave it out next time as I didn't really find it necessary.  Thanks fr a great base recipe, I will make these again.

Really good! I used one can of cream of mushroom, and one can of the cream of chicken, which the gravy came out great. I also had to use stuffing mix instead of plain italian bread crumbs, but it worked well.

I love this recipe! I did use my own cream of soup mixes and bouillon for the au jus, cause I just didn't have any. It was great! Have made several times, once in the crockpot and several times stovetop. Only takes about 20 minutes to shortcut on stove. It is so good! Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good and hearty. I also thought it bordered on being too salty--and I'm the one that everyone hides the salt shaker from, so that's really saying something coming from me! I used 1 can cream of chicken soup and 1 can reduced sodium cream of mushroom. I also shook some garlic salt into the meat, but will not do that again next time. I will also be sure to use reduced sodium soups next time. Overall very good.

These were really tasty. I seen a lot of reviews saying that it was to salty so I used the reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken (thought mushroom would be better). Also I didn't have any au jus packets so I used  a brown gravy packet. It came out delicious. I also used half ground beef and half ground turkey. And I left out the milk since I was out. This was a quick and easy recipe. I will make it again.

This turned out way better than I imagined!  I used half ground beef and half ground turkey. Garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and pepper to season the meat instead of the onion soup and cream of mushroom instead of the chicken soup. 
Turned out excellent. Will make again for sure! 
Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

This is always good. I added chopped onion for more flavor but I think next time I will just add a light tsp of onion powder. I had more than 2lbs of hamburger but one package of onion soup mix and one package of Knorr Au jus was still salty enough.  Subbed  chicken broth  for water and at the end added 2 tsp. kitchen bouquet for darker gravy.

This was very very good. I didn't find it too salty at all, like some other reviews stated. I used cream of mushroom instead of chicken (can't quite understand the concept of using chicken soup with a beef recipe) and I used a packet of dry beef gravy instead of the au ju because that is what I had on hand. Also sliced an onion and placed on top of the steaks. Turned out yummy! Thanks for the great recipe!

Sorry :-( did not enjoy this recipe at all!!  The patties were very dry (maybe I made them a little too thick) and certainly did not enjoy the flavor.

Everyone in my family loved this recipe! Who knew you could make salibury steak in a slow cooker?!  My slow cooker rarely saw the light of day until I found allrecipes.  Now I use it all the time because of great recipes like this one.  I, too, used low sodium soup and we didn't find it too salty at all.  Also, when I divided the meat into 8, I thought the patties were a little too thick so I redivided it into 10 and they were just right.

This is so good! Serve with mashed potatoes and you have a very filling meal. The gravy is a little salty, but overall this recipe is fabulous. I even passed it on to my mom!

MY HOLY GRAIL comfort food dinner. I make this for family, sometimes on holidays, and everyone it impressed. So flavorful and savory. Super easy! It’s my go to and my secret weapon for family gatherings. Served with mashed potatoes and it will compliment the salty yummy gravy.

I doubled the recipe (big family),  I did substitute the water for beef broth, I used beefy onion soup mix and used cream of mushroom soup. 4 hours not needed. I wish the gravy was thicker but the flavor is outstanding!  Next time I will add actual onion and mushrooms. Served with choice of egg noodles or mashed potatoes, steamed veggies and sourdough bread.   It was a big hit from young to old!

THE BEST RECIPE EVER! 5 stars in my opinion! The only change I made was... one can cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom. Was not to salty in our opinion, as other reviewers stated. Cooked in a electric skillet and placed a slice of onion on top of each while it simmered. Served with mashed potatoes, fire roasted corn and yeast rolls!  Thanks for a great recipe!

After I took the hamburger patties out of the skillet, I semi-cooked about half a white onion and portabella mushrooms. I mixed them in with the gravy sauce (which I doubled) and poured it all over the hamburger patties. Cooked for 5 to 6 hours...and it was perfect.

I was expecting more from a 4.5 star recipe and though good, it wasn't great ...  The hubster noted it was rather bland which was the general consensus around our dinner table.  Thank you for the submission TessLynn as I always enjoy trying different recipes.

This is a very good recipe. I gave it four stars because I did make some changes. First I scaled it down to four servings. Instead of the onion soup mix I used 1 tablespoon dried chopped onion. (Not a fan of onion soup mix unless it is being used for the famous dip. Too salty.) Used one can of heart healthy cream of mushroom soup and half the amount of the au jus. Also, because of a time issue I cooked this up very nicely in my electric frying pan. Very good and will make it again. Guest worthy!  Thank you TESSLYNN for this recipe.

It was an easy recipe to throw together & everyone liked it...what more can I say?  I did use the healthy version of the cream soup, and also used 1 cream of chicken & 1 cream of mushroom.  I also added a can of drained mushrooms to the gravy.  Served with instant garlic mashed potatoes, and it was a hit.  Thank you!

I made this with NO CHANGES, followed the directions to the TEE and it was really really good!!! The two cans of condensed cream of chicken soup mixed with the au jus made a delicious gravy, I used one packet of onion soup mix it wasn't too salty, served with mashed potatoes corn and biscuits for a hearty tasty American meal! No changes needed

Yes a slight bit salty.  Only change I made was to double the gravy. Don't change it and screw it up. Excellent recipe as prescribed.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was simple and easy to make.  The only thing I changed was to cook the beef patties first (because of comments about the grease) and then stack them in the slow cooker as instructed.  My extremely picky 9 year old grandson ate 1 1/2 servings.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans!  Will make this again!  Thanks for the recipe.  Oh, also used 1 can cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of celery soup because that's all I happened to have on hand.

If you want a simple, affordable, easy, delicious recipe for Salisbury steak, this is it! The only change I make is cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken. You can use different onion soup mixes (like mushroom-onion) to vary it a little too. Chop potatoes and toss them in as well for a nice side dish. Perfect recipe.

This was a great main dish! I did use the cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom like everyone else is suggesting, because no one in my family cares for mushroom. I kept all other ingredients in the recipe the same, aside from adding a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. I also decided to cook this in a large deep skillet instead of the slow cooker, and once the meat was browned, I poured the sauce in, turned the heat down to a simmer, and covered it to cook for 15 minutes, flipping the patties once and stirring the sauce a few times. Went great with a side of mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. Next time I will make this the same way, but use fresh minced onion instead of the soup mix. It was just too salty for my taste. The cream of chicken and au jus does make a delicious sauce though.

I loved it! So easy and delish! I'm thinking about the cream of mushroom variation next time but this meal was great. I made mashed potatoes and vegetables with it. Amazing and once everyone was ready to eat it took about 20 mins for the sides. Try it!

The gravy was very, very salty.  My best guess is the Lawry's Au Jus mix I used. I admit, I did not look to see how much was in the packet - just threw the whole thing in. 

Perhaps next time I will cut this in 1/2, or perhaps skip it and substitute low sodium beef broth for the water & Au Jus packet.  

I did like the way the beef itself turned out!  I served it on a thick slice of toasted French bread.  I think next time I will saute some onions & mushrooms to go with it.

this had quickly become my most requested meal by the family. It's delicious! Really no modifications here. Just substitute cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken (this seems like a no brainier to me - and I don't even like mushroom!) and I usually slice up an onion and place a whole slice on the top of each patty in the slow cooker. Gets super tender and tasty! Serve with mashed potatoes and enjoy!

Have made this recipe so many times I now turn it into two meals, night one serve over mashed  potatoes, night two I reserve some of the sauce mixture instead of adding it all to the crockpot, cut up the leftover steak patties and toss everything with cooked egg noodles. I love making " 2 for 1 " meals to save time. I usually make meal two while I am cleaning up from meal one so it is done and out of the way, then just reheat in the oven the next night and serve with a vegetable.  This recipe is on the salty side so just have to tweak it a bit.

Made this a few wks ago and it was deliciously amazing. My bf and I devoured it. Instead of using the cream of chicken, I used low sodium cream of mushroom that was recommended in one of the other reviews I read. Everything turned out delicious though a bit salty so I added more water to the sauce mix and I will use less onion soup mix tonight when I make it again  =)  My mouth is watering just thinking about it . I made them over buttered egg noodles, just cooked them and drained them and threw them in the crockpot after the steaks were done and tossed them all around together. We ate them with green beans and corn! Very good dish and recipe thanks for sharing

This was NOT salty at all. I used 93/7 ground beef and didn't change a thing. I used the cream of chicken and whisked the au jus mixture until smooth before throwing it over the patties. I did flash fry them first with flour as well. We put this over rice and the sauce was delicious. I will definitely be making this again.

I made it exactly as written and it was delicious. I don't like a whole lot of things in the crock pot but this is the exception.  This is one of my son's favorite meals.

Absolutely AMAZING. Made this for my boyfriend and he ate every bite. Definitely added to my "Favorites" and will cook many many many more times. I used only one can of the Cream of Mushroom soup. Turned out great, not too salty at all. Boyfriend agreed.

This was amazing.  I scaled this down to half and did what everyone else suggested and used cream of mushroom.  I also added baby portobello mushrooms and worcestershire sauce. I cooked the meat with flour first as suggested then cooked on high for 3 hours.  The meat was not dry,  very moist and not salty at all.  For those who felt the meat broke apart, I suggest you break off a small piece of meat and fry it first then you can see how it holds up.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for. Fantastic! I see many possibilities for this basic recipe. Making meatballs instead and serving with noodles, substituting cream of mushroom soup and adding mushrooms, using cream of celery soup adding potato wedges at the later stage of cooking. Either way, this was really, really good as is.

This recipes is delicious as written.  It is simple and a family favorite.  My picky toddler will eat it and my husband gobbles it down.  It is easily adjusted to a skillet meal over the crock pot if you're in a hurry.  I was very intrigued when mixing au jus with cream of CHICKEN.  It seems a bit odd, but turns out to be a delicious sauce.  Matches extremely well with mashed potatoes and makes enough 'sauce' to go over the potatoes as well.  This recipe is in my regular rotation!

This is an awsome recipe!!I would have given 4 1/2 but couldnt get the 1/2 star on there. first time giving a review ;)I had to change a couple things. I could not use chicken soup with beef so use  beefy mushroom and cream of mushroom,and 1/2 a pkt of Au Jus mix just beacuse I thought it might be too salty. it turned out sooooo good it will be a regular in our house!!

This was great.  Used cream of celery because I didn't have cream of chicken, and beef broth in place of water.  I also didn't have au jus or onion soup mix, so I used a powdered wine and herb marinade in both the meat and the gravy.  Added onions.  Didn't bother to use oil for the patties as they make plenty of their own.  Served with mashed red potatoes and broccoli.
Thanks for sharing!

I think this is a really nice solid recipe.  Very hassle free and very convenient to make.  I'm doing something very rare here and rating the recipe exactly how it was presented because that is how I made it.  I don't see how people can change or substitute the entire recipe then still give it 5 stars?  It's not the same recipe, very deceitful to do that.  Thank you for submitting a nice recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I tweaked this one a bit to suit our preferences by doing the following:  I substituted cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken (I detest those odd little pink chicken bits!), added a can of sliced mushrooms and one half of a large yellow onion, thinly sliced, right at the beginning of cooking, and threw in a few drops of Kitchen Bouquet to darken the gravy.  I also cooked it an hour longer than directed in the recipe.  We found the meat extremely tender, the gravy absolutely delicious---we didn't find it too salty at all.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing, Tesslynn.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  Instead of using a slow cooker, I browned it in a pan and then baked it.  It got the seal of approval from the family.  Will definitely make again!  I did use one part of cream of golden mushroom and one part cream of chicken.

Loved this!!  A definite add to my meal rotation.  I didn't have the au jus mix so I used beef bullion.  I crushed one up and mixed it in the meat and crushed the other one up and mixed it into the soup mixer.  So Good!!

This is my husband's new favorite! We didn't change the recipe, I just somehow made more, smaller patties, which seemed to stretch the meal out into leftovers, so it was a win!

This is your grandma's Salisbury steak recipe,  not that freezer section . My bf LOVES this recipe. He always comes home from work saying how all his co workers loved how it smelled and asks what he has. I use all the ingredients as stated, expect I buy family packs of gr. Beef and just spilt it in two, so I probably use about 3 lbs of meat instead of two which I think lessens the salty taste, but it can be salty if you don't use that much meat. My gravy always turns out a little runny and I have to play with it to thicken it up some. I drain the patties before adding to the slow cooker. This could be done in just a pan, your basically frying burgers then letting it soak in the slow cooker for 5 hours. It doesn't really need to go into one, but I'm a stay at home wife for now so I can start dinner and then clean or whatever and come back hours later, make a few sides and dinners done. It takes me about an hour to prep and cook everything, but again, I'm not in a rush so after I make the patties I throw them in the fridge for 20 mins like you would if bbqing. I serve with brussel sprouts or broccoli, a salad or corn, and potatoes or r biscuits.  You kinda need the potatoes or biscuits to soak up the awesome gravy. And I like the color the other veggies gives to the plate. 

I think adding mushrooms to this would be awesome. Enjoy! This is one recipe you won't regret making. I've shared with friends and everyone LOVES it. Easy, especially if you don't add the slow cooker.

I made this recipe tonight for my husband who absolutely loves anything that even resembles salisbury steak and we all loved it. I did make a few changes though. Instead of cream of chicken, I used cream of onion, three cans instead of two. My husband likes gravy! I also used two packets of au juice mix and a little extra water to thin it just a tad more. This was really tasty, really easy, and really satisgying! Will become one of my mainstay recipes.

There are a few different ways that I know how to use ground beef, but usually it's the same old stuff. This recipe is fairly simple and with a side dish of garlic mashed potatoes along with broccoli or asparagus, it is so GOOD!!

Made this last night...didn't have time to do in the crock pot...but took a shortcut in the oven.  It was delicious - my boys ate 3 each.  I will add this to a regular rotation.  Excellent - will try in the crock pot next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Served with hash browns and salad.

Really enjoyed this!  Made as recipe called only adding sauté onions and mushrooms on top of the burgers. Also took advise of another review and cut a potato up and placed on bottom of crock pot to absorb the grease!  Worked great!  Thanks for sharing!  The gravy did taste salty before I cooked it but was fine after cooking

not bad, just more work than anticipated, very salty.  For the amount of work and dirty dishes it was, I wouldn't make it again.

This was fabulous! I didn't have time to put in the slow cooker so I cooked everything on the stove and it turned out great! Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is so quick and easy, not to mention TO. DIE. FOR. The gravy is very rich. The 5 hours in the crockpot really isn't necessary. By the time you dredge the patties in flour and fry the outside, the meat is pretty much done. I'd say an hour in a good, preheated crock and you're ready to eat! Seriously, it's delicious!

My mom use to make something like this with just hamburgers so it took me back. To make it healthier I used about 1/3 cup oatmeal instead of bread crumbs & through in some oregano, garlic, basil, black pepper, & red pepper flakes along w/ an egg & the milk.  Also, I added about 1/4 to 1/3 cup shredded onion instead of the onion soup mix.  I cooked it all in an electric skillet like someone else suggested. The meat was good but the gravy was a bit too salty even though I used reduced sodium cream of chicken. The next time I make I'm not going to put the whole packet of beef mix in the soup & see how that comes out.  Everyone seemed to like it.

I enjoyed the texture of the meat, lots of flavour.Found this too salty for my taste. It does work very well in the slow cooker. I'll still experiment - I love my slow cooker.

Don Rioux - Thanks for sharimg !!

This was easy to make and delicious! My picky daughter didn't mind leftovers the next night, and that's saying something. If it was more than just the two of us, there probably wouldn't have been leftovers. I followed others' advice and used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. When making the gravy, be sure to stir the au jus mix into the soup until it's thoroughly mixed and creamy. When it's ready to eat, you won't mind that extra moment of stirring. I'll definitely make this again!

Absolutely deliciouss!!  Used one cream of mushroom and one cream of mushroom and chicken.  The gravy has a slightly processed taste will work on it.  Maybe deleting the dry au jus mix and just using some cornstarch and beef boullion seasoning instead.  But I'd still make it again using the au jus mix if that didn't work out.  My family loved this.  UPDATE:  made again and left out the dry au jus mix.  Used 1 can of cream of mushroom & chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom.  Added like 2 cups beef broth in place of water with 2 beef bouillon cubes (mashed with a meat mallet in a small plastic bag).  When it was done I removed the meat and added a little cornstarch mixed with water to thicken the gravy.  It was really tasty without a processed taste.  I also added 2 drained cans of mushroom slices to the gravy.  Put the steak patties back in the gravy and served over mashed potatoes.  Wonderful recipe.  My whole family loves this meal.

i'd been craving salisbury steak and this recipe appeared in my inbox around the same time i'd been hunting for one.  i was excited to make it!

while i really liked the flavor (i used cream of mushroom and brown gravy as suggested by other reviewers), i cannot give this recipe 5 stars.  minus 1 star for the oil sitting on top of everything and minus another star for the texture of the patties.  it was just weird.

don't think i'll make this again.

OMGoodness....This is wonderful.. I used beef stock in place of the water called for, beefy onion soup mix, sliced onions and golden mushroom soup. Didn't think my husband would eat it if he knew there was cream of chicken soup in it.. So delish....Wait until he finds out that he is eating cauliflower in his mashed potatoes.lol

This was awesome!  Thank you so much for sharing!  Honestly, my family LOVED it, and they are very picky eaters!  It's very difficult for me to find different ways to make dinner with the "same ole' thing" and this was great!  The only thing I changed was I used 2 cans of condensed cream of mushroom soup.  I will make this again for them!

THis was really good. I usually stay away from crock pot recipes that have you brown/cook a component first but this was really no trouble. I took the advice of others and used mushroom soup instead of the chicken and I have no complaints! Everyone loved it and I think I'll make it again soon.

Incredibly salty (though still yummy)!  I would suggest using some low sodium soup to balance the salt, if you can find it.  I've also used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup in substitute of 1 can of cream of chicken.  This really is a decent recipe over all but, even as someone who adores salt,  I thought the original recipe was too much.

This was delicious, and made a large amount of food, which is good when you have growing boys!  However, I did make some changes.  I used 1 cream of chicken, and 1 cream of mushroom...this gave it a more traditional flavor.  I reccomend using low-sodium ingredients, if you can, or it becomes too salty.

The flavor was good, but be careful not to leave it in the crock pot too long - it makes the texture a bit mealy.

Very good and easy! My husband and all 3 boys loved it!

The only thing I did different was purely because I only had 1 can of soup - I made the recipe as directed but replaced my missing can of soup with milk and a package of mushrooms. Sooo good! Served over mashed potatoes! This is a fantastic easy and hearty meal!

Very salty even with low sodium soup.  I really liked recipes with fresh mushrooms and mushroom soup better than this one.  It's not bad though.

I have to admit that I have never liked salisbury steak, but decided to make it myself with this recipe and found myself a winner! This is a true 5 star rating as I changed nothing in the recipe.

Good, easy recipe ! Only change made was I used pre- made frozen meatballs, they were 'home style' so that could have been the problem. Taste was a little off, but still good. Will make again, using the patties, as stated. Thanks for sharing !

Very tasty salisbury steak! I followed the recipe and it turned out wonderful. The only change I made was using 2 cans cream of mushroom soup (instead of cream of chicken). Delish  : )

So good! I halved the recipe and used a can of cream of mushroom soup (99% fat free) in place of the chicken soup. I also added a splash of worcestershire and chicken broth to the gravy. This came out perfect! We served this with some boiled baby carrots and they tasted wonderful in the gravy. I will definitely be making this again.

I made this last week, a little skeptical I must say, but it was wonderful.  There were a couple things I had to change because I didn't have those particular things on had:  1) used cream of mushroom soup; 2) used beefy onion dry soup mix; 3) had to make a quick beef broth because did not have dry au jus mix.  But all of those things worked just as well.  And there was plenty of gravy in the crockpot to smother the mashed potatoes!  : )  This is a must stay recipe with the family now!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My husband really liked this dish -- would have given it 4 stars.  However, I just felt it was average.  To me it was salty.  I did substitute Cream of Mushroom soup for the Cream of Chicken.  Make again?? Probably not -- too many other recipes out there that are much better.

This was wonderful! All 4 kids said this was a definite do again! Did the recipe exactly as written, with the cream of chicken soup, since husband and 2 kids do not like mushrooms. I did chop up a whole onion and add it to the gravy before pouring it on the patties in the crock pot. Yummy!!!

I did what many other posters recommended and used cream of mushroom.  Other than that I copied the recipe to a 't'.  Great tasting recipe that will be made again.

Fabulous recipe, but I agree with the other reviewers - very salty!  I made a few changes to help with that...used onion flakes instead of onion soup mix, low-sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, and I whipped this all up in my electric skillet rather than the slow cooker to speed up cooking time on my busy weeknight.  Once the patties were browned in the skillet I added in the cream of mushroom, au jus, and water and let it all simmer for about 20 minutes with the lid on, and it was terrific.  Served with egg noodles, although next time I'll be serving it with mashed potatoes to soak up that gravy goodness!

This would have been great if it wasn't so salty.  I am a very big salt user but it was even too much for me.  I followed the recipe exactly besides I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  I think the salt must have come from the dry Au Jus mix because I didn't add any salt at all. I will look for something to substitute and give it another try.

As is this might have been pretty salty, but I subbed in a can of beef broth for one of the cans of chicken soup.  Also diced up half a medium white onion and sauteed that in the the frond from frying the patties.  Deglazed with gravy mixture, then poured over the arranged patties in the crock pot.  Excellent recipe.  Very tender, flavorsome comfort food.

I can't remember if I ever rated this recipe, but it deserves it even if I have.  I printed this a few years ago and I make it ALL the time.  It is so delicious and easy to prepare.  Hubby and my 1 year old daughter loves it too!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

A wonderful starter recipe for someone who has never made Salisbury Steak before. We made this last night with just a few changes. I added sauteed mushrooms, onions and garlic to the gravy which I made with low sodium beef broth instead of the au jus mix and water. I also went for one can of cream of mushroom soup, because honestly, chicken didn't sound too good. We served it with sour cream and cheddar mashed potatoes and roasted green beans with onions and garlic.

Very easy, but just wasn't crazy about how the "steaks" turned out.  As someone else posted, kind of reminded me of meatloaf.  I think I may give this one another shot because my husband and daughter liked it.  Think will do on the stove top though and not cook as long and go from there.  Gravy was very good though.

What a wonderful thing to do to ground beef!  Due to my own error, I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom soup (I only bought 1 can of chicken and thankfully had the mushroom in stock). It was still great with the cream of mushroom soup. My only complaint is that it may be a tad bit too salty for some.  If sodium is a concern I would try 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of reduced sodium cream of chicken or mushroom. Thanks for the recipe!

I was very pleased with the outcome of this. I've never actually made homemade Salisbury steak and the family loved it. I did do a few changes to use up what I had at home. I used a jar of beef gravy in place of the chix soup and I used beef broth in place of the water, because I had some broth opened from another meal. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good. I made some slight alterations; onion/mushroom soup mix, cream of mushroom soup instead of cr. of chicken (it didnt make sense to me) and I used a mushroom gravy mix instead of au jus mix. I also used 1/2c water and 1/4c red wine, and added a drained can of mushrooms and some italian seasoning. It was great--a tiny bit salty, so next time I am going to try one can of reduced sodium soup and one regular. It was very tasty and my husband loved it. A keeper!

So awesome! I used 1 lb ground beef, 2 tblsp onion soup mix, 1 tblsp worcheshire sauce, and exactly half of all other ingredients for meat mixture. For the sauce, I used 1 jar beef gravy, 1 packet au jus mix, and about 1/2 cup water. I put in a casserole dish with diced potatoes, covered, for 1 hour @ 350. Came out perfect!!!

First, let me start by saying my husband and I are not big salisbury steak fans.  However, after looking at the ingredients, I thought I'd give it a try.  It's definitely a keeper!  The only things I did differently were use cream of mushroom, instead of the chicken, and I used a 1 tsp of beef bouillon in place of the au jus packet.  I cannot wait to share this recipe with my friends!  So good, and oh, so easy!

This is a delicious and easy way to make a great dinner.  I read the reviews and decided to use low sodium cream of mushroom soup, beef broth instead of water, and it was just fine. I also added some fresh mushrooms. The aroma in my house was wonderful while this dish was cooking!  I served it over some mashed potatoes and had a great comfort food dinner!

Excellent!  My 8 yr old, who is a hard customer, loved it!  I think I will add another packet of the au jus next time for additional seasoning in the patties, because although the gravy was perfect, the meat patties themselves were a bit bland. I served with rice.

This was easy and delicious.  Wasn't sure what was meant by stacking patties "pyramid style" but in my oval slow cooker I had room to make 2 stacks of 4 patties each - in a pinwheel pattern.  I will make this again and share the recipe with friends - it is true that the gravy is delicious with mashed potatoes, probably also good with rice.

Very tasty!  Does make a large quantity so I cut it in 1/2.  The gravy is great on smashed red potatoes.  It can be a little salty so try using reduced sodium soup.

I have to give this a low rating becuase the person who added it, didn't give an importnat detail. You have to skim the fat/grease off, to have any decent gravy, even then it's not good.

The Salisbury Steak turns out great, but the gravy is worthless. Because of the fact that you "quickly brown" the steaks, the fat/grease cooks off into the gravy. You have to have a skimmer, to remove the fat/grease. I would recommned cooking the steak, but fixing gravy on the stove.

I thought this was pretty good, and very easy to make.  It didn't taste like TV dinner salisbury steaks, which is what I was craving (I don't care who you are...those are good!), but they were still very tasty.  They were definitely salty, though...and I LOVE salty food!  I second all the reviews saying to use low-sodium soups.  I also found that my 2 tablespoons of oil was pretty much absorbed by the first two steaks, so I used non-stick spray for the rest, and it worked quite well!  I think I'll skip the oil altogether in the future and just use the spray.  (By the way, I didn't have time to wait 4 or 5 hours, so after browning the steaks in a skillet, I put everything in a 9x13-inch pan and baked in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.)

Awesome!! I doubled this recipe & took 1/2 to a friend who just had a baby. Both families loved this! I was a little worried about using cream of chicken soup with the ground beef, but the gravy is so good, we were sopping it up with french rolls! I served this with next day mashed potatoes ( I substituted onion & chive cream cheese for the plain) and corn on the cob. Even my 11 year old ( the picky eater) asked for seconds!! I have made this 2 times since and will continue to add it to my menu. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is delicious!  I gave our leftovers to my husband's 85 year old grandmother and she raved about it.  She's always asking me when I'm going to make it again.  I didn't change anything to the original recipe.  My whole family, including a super-picky 4 year old loves this!

Very yummy!  Followed the recipe to the t and it came out great.  As for being on the salty side, yes, but I found it just fine.  If you were sensitive or don't care for the saltiness, you could easily use low sodium soup, less onion soup mix (1/2 packet).  My four and six year old gobbled this up!

I did make some changes, but all the basics came from here - thanks so much! Used cream of mushroom soup, and subbed 1/4 cup of red wine for some of the water. Added a can of drained mushrooms, and used chicken gravy mix instead. Prepped slow cooker with quick 'spray' of oil; after frying patties, I covered them with thinly sliced onion, and then poured liquids on top. Truly wonderful flavour, with mashed potatoes & french bread. Got kiss from hubby for this one!

These were even better than the "name brand".  I was very skeptical about the combination of the soup and Au Jus mix....boy was I glad I tried this.  The only thing I will do differently is make the patties thinner, mine kind of came out like mini oval meat balls.  Didn't look great, but it sure did taste awesome!   Thanks for sharing!.....I have started making this wil ground turkey instead of beef and it is just a good!  It is in my all the time menu!

I have made this many times now without the crock and with slight variation to Tesslynn's recipe.  It has become a regular on our family menu and gets requested by both my husband and kids.  
Recipe changes - We use 2 lbs. of ground turkey instead of beef,  substitute one of the cans of condensed cream of chicken soup with condensed cream of mushroom soup, and changed liquids to 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup of skim milk.
Cooking changes - I moved recently and chucked out the old crock pot so I have an alternative that's pretty easy.  Oven at 350.  Mix ingredients, make patties, and dredge in flour.  Then I place them on a cookie sheet covered with foil and sprayed with cooking spray (easy clean-up).  Cook at 350 for 45 minutes, turning after the first 30 minutes.  In stock pot, mix together the cream of mushroom soup, au jus mix, and water/milk. Heat till warm.  Place patties in the soup and mix.  Cook on Low for 15 minutes.
We have it with rice or mashed potatoes and a good veg.

Main reason for only 3 stars - the gravy was way to salty!  Patties are workable as is, but I do recommend making sure they're not made to thick. I did alter the recipe using 3 1/2 lbs of meat and mine ended up shrinking and puffing up to about a inch in thickness, even though they were a 1/2 inch when I started.  The whole time while eating I was thinking about how much better they would be if not so thick (my doing though) and if the gravy wasn't so darn salty! Even though I will definitely have to tweak this recipe to get it right, it is still worth trying again.  There's potential, but as is sorry, no.

Delicious!!  I followed the recommendation of everyone using low sodium cream of chicken and 1/2 of the onion mix.  I actually could have used more salty flavor to it.  I will make again with the regular cream of chicken.  Family agreed can make again, even at least once a month which means it’s a winner!!  Only one to say they prefer the frozen kind is my child who doesn’t do too well with change.  He said it was good but preferred the frozen one.

My favorite comfort food type of dish! I have substituted the cream of chicken for cream of mushroom, and water for beef broth. Both are great options. I also add mushrooms to the slow cooker.

I recommend 90/10 beef.  I also used a packet of brown gravy instead of the Au jus.  And instead of seasoned breadcrumbs, I used Panko with my own seasonings.  Family already wants to know when I’m making it again ??

I made it EXACTLY as the recipe says. I used 2.25 lbs of meat. It could be absolutely delicious but it is way way way too salty & I love salt but this was just too much. I did not add any salt to it. I would like to try it again but I have to do something to make it less salty. Maybe use only half of the onion soup mix packet & half of the au jus mix?  Maybe one can of the soup mixed with a little milk instead of two cans? I’m not sure what to do but I’d like to figure it out because it is tasty except for the extreme saltiness of it.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight. It was out of this world. It didn’t have high expectations. It’s what my mom wanted for her birthday. So I looked at All Recipes and selected this recipe as it looked the easiest.  I used an electric skillet as did another reviewer rather than a crock pot. Also, a couple reviewers mentioned the saltyness. To avoid that issue I used low sodium soup. That did the trick!  Every person raved about how good the meal was. I served the pattie on top of mashed potatoes and served fresh green beans.

Easy to make, used 2 cans of mushroom soup instead of chicken, beef bullions instead of augi.  Not salty at all.  Everyone love it was a big hit.

Very tasty and easy recipe. I prepared the meat and sauce the night before and put it in the crock pot in the morning after refrigerating overnight. Cooked about 6 hours. Very tender and flavorful. Next time I will use half of the onion soup mix. A little too salty, but otherwise a winner. Thanks!!

I'm 72 and live alone now. I have been cooking for 50 years because I love good food, and that's what I find on All Recipes site. Some recipes have many ingredients and steps, but gives you fantastic results, while other recipes have a lot fewer ingredients and steps, and give you fantastic results. This recipe was soooo easy and soooo good. The only thing I did different, was to add sliced cremini mushrooms. I don't like people giving ratings when they've changed the recipe. I am not doing that. I gave a 5 star rating on the recipe when it was done. Then I added mushrooms because I love them so much and had some on hand. Thanks for sharing this one.

Based on other feedback I decided to eliminate onion soup mix altogether (not big onion fans anyways). It was delicious! Spouse and friends for dinner....big hit! Will definitely do this again soon.

This was the best Salisbury steak I’ve ever had. 
My family loved it. Very easy!
I used cream of mushroom soup and beef broth!
Would definitely make again.

My kids love this recipe! I use extra lean ground beef, and instead of cream of chicken (which doesn’t sound good when thinking of Salisbury steak) I used low sodium cream of mushroom soup with all the other ingredients being the same as mentioned in recipe and it always turns out amazing!! Except I cook some egg noodles to eat with the Salisbury steak not mashed potatoes. It’s a great, delicious, quick dinner! Thanks for the recipe I will be cooking forever as well as passing down to my kids!

After reading the reviews, I used plain breadcrumbs instead of seasoned.  I also used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken soups. It turned out great.  Will definitely make again.  Great flavor and good portion size.

I followed other reviewers advice and made this on the stovetop and with cream of mushroom soup. I also added a package of button mushrooms. I thought it was a tasty meal, my husband loved it!  I will make it again.

We’ve made this multiple times and it’s amazing! If I don’t have time to do it in the crock pot, I bake it in the oven 350 for 45-50 min and it’s just as good! I serve with simple brand mashed potatoes, mushrooms and green beans and always have clean plates!

Yum! Comfort food. Serve over rice or mashed potatoes. I made minor adjustments like adding eggs to ground beef mixture but I don’t know if that mattered. The steaks were very tender and gravy very flavorful (I used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom).

Instead of 2 cans of cream of chicken, I replaced it with 1 can of cream of mushroom and used 2 packets of onion soup mix. It was very good with the gravy over some garlic and Parmesan mashed potatoes. A perfect meal for a cold night when you want some comfort food to fill you up!

I made this a few weeks ago and my family is already asking me to make it again! I followed the recipe and it turned out so yummy. I saw some one made it with cream of mushroom soup and I am going to try that tomorrow to see how it is. Hopefully it is just as yummy. Thanks for a great slow cooker recipe that wasnt chicken.

Wonderfully delicious!  I was excited to make this after reading the reviews, but I didn't have all the ingredients.  So after studying the reviews, I tried one of the suggestions that worked wonderfully.  I used low-sodium Cream of Mushroom soup instead of Cream of Chicken soup and added 2 tsp Worcestershire Sauce, 1 tsp Gravy Master and 1 cup beef broth (I wanted extra for gravy) as a substitute for Au Jus mix.  I let it simmer in a crock pot for 5 hours and the gravy was incredible with garlic mashed potatoes and mixed veggies.  I also noticed a pressure cooker recipe that cooks the meat and gravy for 15min on high pressure with a 10 min natural release that I'm looking forward to trying. I'm confident this will be served many more times to come!

Delicious. The only thing I recommend doing is trying to find low sodium versions of the soups as this was a tad salty. Not enough to remove a star but those watching that sort of thing might want to take note. Do not skip on browning the patties before putting in crock pot. Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is amazing! It was so easy to make and absolutely delicious. The only thing I added was sautéed mushrooms into the crockpot to cook with the meat. I completely browned the meat to where I did not see any pink, then cooked on low for 3 hours. The one thing I will change next time is that making it into 8 patties made them very thick like burgers. So next time I will make them smaller and come out with 12.

This turned out superb.  Hubby loved it and wants me to make it again, with my minor changes.  I had about 1/2 small carton of mushrooms (mixed varieties) which I added to the pot along with a can of cream of mushroom soup - I wanted lots of sauce.  A tad more liquid was added to make up for the added 2nd can of soup.  I think the addition of the soup, mushrooms, and water help with the saltiness of the Au jus mix.  This is a definite keeper.

I follow the recipe as it is written because making changes to it means that you are not rating this recipe... That being said, I like this one and it turned out great for us. My daughter and I both liked it and we will make it again. I used ground chuck for the meat and it turned out wonderful, very tasty and the gravy was very good as well.  It cooked in my slow cooker for only 3.5 hours before it was done, but that might just be the difference in the slow cooker used by the submitter.

We could not find regular cream of chicken so we used cream of chicken and mushroom instead. Also because my husband loves mushrooms we added a small can of mushrooms to the gravy and it turned out amazing. Will definitely be making this again.

Wonderful recipe. Even my picky family loved them.Easy, with the slow-cooker being a help. The recipe calls for browning these before placing in the cooker. I fully agree!. Using very lean meat, requires locking in any juices within before finishing off. Thank you for this one. It is saved to my collections.

Consensus was that this was a keeper! I followed directions from previous reviews - 1/2 the onion soup, can low sodium cream chicken, can low sodium cream shroom; browned patties in cast iron cooker, tossed soups and au jus in and cooked ~15 minutes until meat was cooked through. It was fantastic!

I have made this multiple times now. The recipe as shown is solid and a wonderful meal. I have also done variations of the recipe. Once replacing one of the cream of chicken with cream of mushroom and another time placing the patties on top of a bed of sliced onions in the slow cooker. Both turned out nicely. This is a great recipe that can be modified in so many ways to suit your tastes.

This was flavorful and delicious. I did make a few changes to suit my tastes though.

*Plain bread crumbs instead of seasoned.
*Cream of mushroom instead of chicken. 
*Brown gravy mix, in place of the au jus.
*Fresh sliced mushrooms.

I will note that I cut the recipe in half, since it's just my Husband and I- and it was still a lot of food. It made two decent sized patties each, and neither of us could start on the second one. They are very filling. Some may want to consider cutting this down more to avoid wasting food.

Since a lot of the reviewers were saying that it was super salty, I tried to cut back on the sodium by using less of the onion soup and I even used only one can of reduced sodium cream of chicken soup.  Husband really liked it as well; the only criticism he had was that the next time I make it I should put mushrooms in it (since that is typical in salisbury steak) and I agree. So rather than cream of chicken, I would use cream of mushroom.

This was delicious and easy!  I've made this twice so far, and it is now on my favorite recipe list.  

Try adding chopped green peppers in the patties.  It adds a nice flavor in addition to the onions.

I LOVED this dish!  You know how reviews always start with "I didn't change a thing" and then the next word is "except"?  I. DIDN'T. CHANGE. A. THING.  :)  This recipe is absolutely wonderful exactly as it's written out here.  Clear directions, easy to follow, and delicious!  Other reviewers have cautioned about the salty flavor.  I will say this:  I'm from the South, where we use salt liberally, so I found it PERFECT.  It certainly did not need any more salt added, but I thought it was perfect the way it was.  If you have a bit of a lower tolerance for salt, then you might want to do as others have suggested and halve the onion mix to help with that.  I think this is a delicious, savory, rich recipe, and I will absolutely make it again!  Thank you for posting this one!

I used 1/2 cup of oatmeal with a tsp of Italian seasoning because I did not have Italian bread crumbs.  Also used cream of mushroom soup as I did not have cream of chicken.  Also had to substitute brown gravy mix for the au jus mix.  I cooked it on the stove and it turned out great.  Family absolutely loved it.

We were able to get more than eight patties because we made them a bit smaller, and used one can of cream of cicken, plus one can of cream of mushroom soup. we also followed the recommendations of another cook to use Brown gravy instead of au juse for the gravy sauce. We also browned the patties in some reserved clear bacon grease saved over from breakfast. A savory change, and were able to serve 6 people two small Salisbury steak patties, mashed potatoes, gravy, and a side of vegetables each. Everyone cleaned their plates completely and the three teenagers asked me to make it again soon. Great, easy dinner with

WOW! This one is my personal favorite, and my chef husband was even impressed. I did switch it up a bit, I used one can of cream of mushroom, one can beef broth and subsititued beef broth instead of water. Awesome recipe.

My wife and son LOVED it.  They are picky eaters and although I've been making Salsbury Steak for ages, this has become the new recipe for our home.  I did go with Cream  of Mushroom soup, as I thought it would go better with it.  Definitely recommend the low sodium soup, whichever you choose, as it will be fairly salty otherwise.

Very easy to make, the meat was very moist and full of flavor. I didn't change any of the ingredients. I also agree it was on the salty side. I will definitely make it again, just cut the aujus mix in half next time.

I halved this recipe for just the two of us, but should have kept the full package of au jus mix with the full amount of water for gravy with maybe 2 cans of condensed soup (we love gravy).  I made the 1 lb. of ground beef into 3 patties but there wasn't nearly enough gravy for mashed potatoes and the patties.  My SO liked it and it was easy and very good and I will make it again soon with a few changes.   Thanx TessLynn for sharing!

Tried it! Loved it!i did however make a few tweaks due to my experimental nature, no disrespect to the original cook.
I did not have any au jus mix or cream of chicken so I used cream of mushroom and brown gravy dry mix i think Salisbury steak should have mushrooms. Yumm 
As for the meat i am a hunter and i had a lot of ground deer meat this recipe made a great new way to cook deer OMG !! So exciting!!

My late mother-in-law was a fabulous cook and always made her Salisbury steak with cubed steak, remember them? the tenderized little steaks you used to be able to buy back when grocery stores actually had butchers.  This recipe runs a close second to her's except for the meat cut. Very good flavor!

Tasty, but salty. I love my slow cooker for certain applications, but there are times when it's absolutely unnecessary.  In this case, it's not a time-saver.

Similarly, my granddad taught me this recipe but we use spicy breakfast sausage (half hamburger, half sausage), an egg in lieu of milk, and plain bread crumbs.  Less salt but more flavor.  Also, try Cream of Mushroom with fresh mushrooms.

This is a great recipe! I used beefy onion soup mix, and cream of chicken with mushroom soup because I didn't have what was specifically mentioned on hand and it still turned out great. Very flavorful! I haven't been a fan of Salisbury Steak since my grade school days with the nasty school lunch variety, but I'm now a convert! Thanks for sharing!

a very fast and easy dish to make. i really enjoy slow cooker dishes because they pretty much do all the dirty work for you. i didnt have the au jus mix (or whatever its called) so i substituted turkey gravy mix. and might i say, it turned out pretty great! also, i made my own additions like a splash of red wine vinegar and paprika and sage. near the end of cooking time, i sauteed a few chopped mushrooms and added them to the slow cooker----a wonderful addition if i do say so myself. next time i will add fresh garlic, herbs and butter to the sauce mixture!

Reminds me of the salsbury steak I used to have as a child, only better because it's homemade... I did go with the lower sodium cream of chicken soup and it was perfect. I also made it in a pan because I didn't have the time to wait for the slow cooker, I simmered it for about a half hour after adding the gravy (it didn't have to go that long). A good quick weeknight dinner and the kids loved it.

Very easy, quite good.  The only ingredient I changed was the cream of chicken soup--there was just no way I could bring myself to use it.  It just didn't make any sense to me.  I used cream of mushroom.  I made half the recipe, which was perfect for us.  I feel like it is missing something.  Next time I make it, and I do plan on making it again, I think I have to add something.  Not sure what.  Black pepper, for one thing.  I just feel like it needs a bit more flavor.  But we did like it.  Thanks for sharing.

5 stars for flavor! However, I had an epic senior moment and screwed up the recipe...let's just leave it at that. Still delicious flavor, in spite of me. :)

My family loved this recipe! I used one can of cream of mushroom & one can of cream of chicken. Added sliced mushrooms & half an onion & subbed beef broth for the water. It was great. Will definitely be adding this recipe into my weeknight rotation. Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

A big hit at our house! Used electric frying pan instead of crock pot..just kept on low. Cream of Mushroom soup as that's what I had. Added some onion to patty mix and fresh mushrooms towards end of cooking time. Cooked baby potatoes in with the patties. This is a keeper.

Great RECIPE!! Much like everyone who mentioned gave a review on this recipe it is a little on the salty side, would recommend different substutues to lower the sodium count. Paired w/ mashed potatoes and corn.

This was the most wonderful Salisbury steak ever. My husband who is not a big Salisbury steak lover, absolutely loved this recipe. If you use the exact pounds of ground beef, it is not too salty. I thought it was perfect and rounded out the meal with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. DELISH!!!!!! I love the cream of chicken with the packet of au jus. The gravy had the perfect beefy flavor. I added the entire packet of lipton onion soup mix, with some fine cut chopped onions to the beef mixture. I did use 1lb of ground chuck and 1lb of ground sirloin. If you cannot find ground sirloin, use 93% lean ground beef. I also added more water to my soup mix. I think that helped with the saltiness. I cut up some fresh onions and let it cook. Perfect Salisbury steak. Just add more water to your soup mix and it will not be too salty and absolutely perfect.

It was easy to put everything together and leaving it in the crock pot was the best part! Served over hot rice. Then it started to bring back memories of my elementary school days and the awful cafeteria food served for lunch! It was more like meatloaf rather than Salisbury steak.

I never leave reviews but I made this tonight and the only thing I changed from the original recipe was the cream of mushroom soup and my family loved this. The gravy was awesome!  I will definitely be making this again.  My husband is already asking for this gravy for when he makes fried chicken

One word.  Yum.   OK more than one word--easy as heck to make, and I do agree with others that it is a bit on the salty side, so you might want to heed the advise of using lower sodium cream of chicken soup or lower sodium au jus, but this is a wonderful recipe and a perfect example of why I use allrecipes.com like a cooking Bible (no, I don't work for them :)).  No, the recipe didn't make ground beef taste like prime rib, it just made it taste like good comfort food.  You might want to double the gravy for the mashed potatoes which invariably must be served with it.  Thanks Tess for sharing

This was awesome! My husband raved about it for days. I used a packet of brown gravy mix in place of the au jus since that is what we had on hand. Otherwise made everything as directed. Wie will add this to the regular meal rotation.

This was delish- I added 2 envelopes of McCormick brown gravy mix instead of the au ju, and added Worcester.  Plenty beefy enuff. Love, love, loved it. Other than that I followed the recipe--a keeper.  I think you could do this in the oven, too instead of slow cooker.  I will make this again and add to regular rotation. Tasted great and very much like Salisbury steak.  Use the cream of chicken just like the recipe.  I think the Worchester added a more beefy flavor too.

This was such a hit at my house! Took very little time to prepare, and tasted great! Made with mashed potatoes and green beans. Very filling! Had my husbands friend over for dinner and he had 3 helpings of it! I'm not sure how he was able to move after eating all that! Also wonderful leftover with toast underneath. This might be a weekly meal in our house now.

I forgot I had this recipe saved! I was craving some Salisbury steak and found this in my favorites and now I know why I saved it! I had all the ingredients so I made it tonight and I’ll definitely be making it again! I cut the recipe in half since it’s just me and my hubby, and I only made two slight changes to the gravy: I used cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken, and I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. If splitting in half though double the gravy because we almost ran out and I like to have extra. Served over buttered egg noodles. So easy and simple!

I'll definitely make this again!  I did have to tweak it though because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I had to use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. I had to make my own Onion Soup Mix by using a recipe I found on here.  It called for 2 tbsp of beef bullion but I only had cubes.  I found that 1 cube was equivalent to 1 tsp but I thought 6 tsp was way too much so I only used 4 cubes.  I also didn't have dried onion so I just used raw onion.  I also had to substitute a packet of Au Jus with a packet of brown gravy mix and I had some mushrooms that needed to be used so I threw those in too.  It was delicious!  We served it over mashed potatoes.  Yum!

I used the heart healthy soups and Knorr au jus and onion soup mix were the lowest in sodium cutting thousands of potential MG out.  After cooking some quartered potatoes in there it was not even close to salty.

Also, mix the water and au jus before adding the soup.  I did use cream of mushroom and a mixer.  I will try the gravy packet next time.

This was a great recipe and full of flavor!! Like other reviewers stated, was a bit salty. Would definitely recommend cutting down on the amount of sodium where you can whilst making this. I will be making this again in the near future!

Super yummy this is one of my favorites! I adjusted a few things, substituted the Italian Bread crumbs with Ritz Crackers and Cream of Chicken with Cream of Mushroom. I used low sodium soup which helped to cut down on the salt. Plus the electric skillet is much quicker and easy clean up vs a crockpot

I just made this for the first time and we all LOVED it! I was out of potatoes so we made rice and noodles as we all like different things and the gravy was absolutely marvelous! I will definitely put this into our monthly rotation!

The first time I made this, my husband and I loved it. I make it quite often. He likes lots of gravy, so I double the soup, water and gravy packet. It is so wonderful served over mashed potatoes!!

WOW!  My kids LOVED this and my kids hate EVERYTHING!  I too cooked the recipe in a stove-top covered skillet... 30 mins and it was fabulous.  Serviced over top of mashed potatoes with broccoli.  I'm telling you, it's comfort food at it's best.  Will definitely make this again.  PS  I used cream of celery soup but any cream soup would be delicious.

Very good and tender! I added garlic powder, salt and pepper to the meat mixture.  The sauce was very good too! My family enjoyed this yummy meal. I served the Salisbury steak with mashed potatoes,  broccoli and homemade blueberry muffins. I will be sure to make this recipe again soon!

I made this recipe 3 weeks ago and it was very good. It's only me and my husband so I froze about half (what was left over) and last week I pulled it out of the freezer to thaw. The next day I put it in a casserole dish and popped it in the oven for 45 minutes and it was still very good. The hubby loved it so this will be a keeper in my house. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This recipe was definitely a success! I cooked it without changing anything and it came out great. My husband loved it! I cooked it with mashed potatoes and the gravy was perfect! I didn't think it was too salty and adding the au jus to the cream of chicken soup gave the gravy a beef flavor. We'll definitely be making this again.

I used only 1 lb beef. I used regular bread crumbs with italian seasoning from my spice rack. Everything turned out fine. I only slow cooked it for like 2 hours and high cooked it for 20 minutes.

This recipe is great! I was concerned about the gravy having a chicken flavor using cream of chicken and not cream of mushroom as other suggested but the steaks came out AWESOME and the gravy was SUPERB! The steaks were even juicy and I used regular ground beef...I will definitely cook this again SOON!!! P.S. I forgot all about taking a photo because after the first bite we were going back for more!!!

This is one of my "go to" recipes for an easy weeknight meal.  My kids and husband love it.  I have used it as a slow cooker recipe and an oven recipe.  I know that I lose some big flavor by skipping the browning step, but less dirty dishes and less time mean a lot in my household (we have 5 kids, 5 years old and under).  This recipe has such big flavors we don't miss out. Using the oven method I simply assemble the patties and arrange them in a baking dish, cover with sauce and bake for one hour on 375.  Both ways are amazing.

This was amazing!! I had every intention of cooking it in the slow cooker. That's why I picked it to try. But, I decided to fix it with only about 3 hours. So, I followed the directions for the meat, browned them then put them in a single layer in a casserole dish. For the gravy I added 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce and 1 tsp dry mustard and poured it over the steaks. I baked it on 350 for a little over an hour. My whole family loved it. This has been one of my sons favorite dishes and he couldn't stop talking about it. The gravy was perfect. The steaks were perfect. So, we will definitely fix this again.

Very good, however, VERY salty!  I used Cream of Mushroom instead of Cream of Chicken, and I doubled the gravy part.  Next time I will use low sodium onion soup mix and condensed soup.

Delicious- very highly recommend. The only change I made was according to some other reviews that suggested cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.

My family loved this one and it was so much easier than others I have found. I did use a can of cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken and I drained a can of French onion and added the onions.

This is my second time making it..I mix have ground beff and half Turkey.The first time.
My family didn't even notice it. I have a very picky family and they loved it.This time I am just using ground beef because that is all I have on hand and this time instead of using two cans of brown gravy which I did the first time this time I'm only using 2 cans of French onion and I have to admit I forgot to put in the cream of chicken so well I don't have any on hand some to see how it comes out. it should be very good though. what a great recipe

Our whole family loved this dish.  I think the key is to use a very low fat beef as it cooks the majority of the time in the crock pot.  After browning the patties, I used the paper towel method to "squeeze" out some of the grease.  It was a hit with my family! I might try making it 1/2 with ground turkey or chicken.  I do agree that less onion soup mix is needed.  I bet the other powdered mix has a high sodium content.

I changed the soup to 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom.  It was tasty, but very salty, I added milk to the gravy while it was cooking and that helped, maybe lower sodium soup would work best next time.  Overall good find!!

I followed a review that was posted by another individual, and used Cream of Mushroom soup.  I also added some chopped baby bella mushrooms. EVERYONE gobbled it down.  Thanks for the recipe! Yum.

Simply delicious. no more boxed  processed meat for this one.
UPDATE...I made this gluten free. all from giant eagle. left out onion soup packet, and used brown gravy packet instead of Au Jus

all gluten free  
(bread crumbs, cream of mushroom soup, flour, mc cormicks brown gravy,) wow so good, you could not tell it was gluten free.

Simple to make, filling, tasty.  That's a pretty good combination!  I was too lazy to flour and brown the patties so I just made them up and layered them in the slow cooker.  Added an egg to the patty mix and omitted the milk.  Threw some black pepper and some minced garlic into the sauce.  My husband loved it served over buttered noodles with green beans.  Would be really good with crushed / mashed potatoes, too.  Thanks for this good recipe!!

Followed recipe to the letter. It is salty but good. Will cut down on salt where I can. I'll definitely make this again. Kids really liked it.

I am giving it 5 stars because my husband and mom loved it. I was sick unfortunately and didn't get to enjoy it. My husband is a huge fan of Salisbury Steak and he said this was the best he had ever eaten.  I did go with 2 cans cream of mushroom soup and at the end I thickened it with a little corn starch. Other than that did everything else as the recipe called for.

Was very easy to make. Those who are sensitive to salt will find this salty. I made everything the night before and put it the crock pot with out turning it on and sealed it  Turned the crock pot on the next day making it for supper.

Loved this recipe! I ended up using 2.25 lbs of ground beef, 2 cans of cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, beefy onion soup mix & added a can of beefy mushroom soup. I also added about 1/14 cup water so it wasn't too salty.  This made 9 good size patties & 1 small patty that was perfect for my 2 year old. I will difenatly be making this again!

We don't eat beef so I substituted ground beef with turkey. Instead of the Au jus mix, I used another onion packet. Also added sliced mushrooms. It was delicious!!!!! I might use one low sodium cream if chicken to cut down the salt.

Very very tasty. Just a bit salty. Halve the onion soup mix or use a low sodium version. Inlaws, wife, and baby loved it with sides of mashed potatoes and mixed veggies.

This has great flavor by VERY salty.  Cut back on the Au Jus packet or put in a jar of gravy instead.  We actually had to throw away all the leftovers because everyone in my house hated the saltiness.

Great recipe fiance and I both loved it! Tweaked the recipe a little added some caramelized onions and sauteed garlic to the ground beef, onion soup mix and milk. Was a little bit salty, will still definitely make this recipe again but next time I will add cream of mushroom soup and some peppercorns for a bit of a kick. Thanks!

Served it with sweet rice instead of regular rice.  Was a hit!  Sweetness contrasted nicely with the beef flavoring

Wasn't able to comment the first time I made it. Making it again this week by request. I too thought it was a bit salty. That would be because of the onion soup mix and the au jus mix. Both have great flavor and lots of sodium. This time I am leaving out the onion soup mix and adding my own herbs and spices without the added sodium. Also using crm. of mushroom. I will share how it turns out later in the week!

I made this last night for all the family who are visiting from Texas.  It was a huge hit. I made garlic mashed potatoes to go with the gravy.  My husband especially loved the gravy.  I put one beaten egg in the meat mixture to add the flavor and stick the meat together.   I also bought heart healthy soup which reduces sodium.    This is a keeper for sure.  Thank you.

We didn't feel it tasted like Salisbury steak, it was more like a meatloaf patty.The patty was moist and good. I cooked 4 hours on low.  Will make this again.

I made this recipe using creamed mushroom soup if I didn't have chicken soup. Cooked the patties in skillet, then drained the fat and added the soup mixture. Didn't transfer to slow cooker; just cooked on low heat in skillet for about 15 mins. Turned out great! Very tasty recipe.

This recipe is my substitution for meat loaf.  My husband and I love it!
I did switch to cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken soup.  We just like it better.  I also put it in the oven at 350 for about a hour and fifteen mins.  It is yummy, especially the gravy.  Man, put that gravy over the meat and potatoes. It is sooooo delicious.

Previous reviews were very helpful. I halved the recipe as I was making it just for me. I agree that it was a tad bit salty, but not overpowering. Low sodium ingredients would certainly take care of that I think. Overall a very tasty and hearty meal.

I was hesitant about chicken soup with beef, but I decided to go ahead and try it. After reading some of the reviews saying it was too salty I used two packages of dry brown gravy mix instead of the Au Jus- which does tend to be salty. That was the only change I made and it was absolutely wonderful! I highly recommend this recipe!

We love this.  I even do a fast version of this by frying up the patties and adding the gravy and letting it simmer on the stove for 30 minutes.  Just as good.

Excellent recipe and goes together fast.  I did "swap out" the cream of chicken soup for beefy mushroom soup.  My husband said it was a "keeper".

Simple recipe.  My husband made it all by himself!  It is absolutely delicious.  He made the entire recipe which was enough food for 4 meals for us.

OMGoodness this was amazing! My husband used bread to sop up all the gravy, and my very picky son even ate every bite! I made a couple minor changes. I used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of mushroom. I also added about a teaspoon each of garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper to the sauce before pouring it over the meat. The taste is so similar to the yummy boxed version from the freezer, but is so much better for you! This will become a regular in our house!

Really great.  Kids loved them.  Serve them over mashed potatoes.  Use one can of cream of mushroom soup, one far of beef gravy.  Then at the end, skim off the grease and add an additional can of beef gravy.

Made this last night and it was excellent!  I did not use the crock pot but cooked it on top of the stove for 30 mins.  My husband said I could make this anytime!

I cooked this recipe EXACTLY as it states. I made absolutely no changes. It was absolutely to die for. My husband was in love and so was I. I know some people are saying it was really salty but personally I didn't catch that at all. I asked my husband as well and he said it didn't taste too salty to him either. Either way, it was absolutely delightful and pretty easy to make. I made mashed potatoes for a side and there was plenty of gravy left for the potatoes! Thanks for this one! I'll definitely be cooking it again!

I've made this recipe several times but omit the Au Jus packet and instead of using cream of chicken, I use 2 cans of condensed golden mushroom soup with one can of water. Also, in the very last hour of cooking time I add 2 small cans of drained sliced mushrooms to the sauce. Goes great with mash potatoes and a veggie.

Loved this recipe! Good comfort food for fall. I did halve the onion soup mix, and used healthy request soup so I wouldn't feel so guilty.

I did what you should not do on a recipe....modify before you try as is. But it turned out great. Used golden mushroom soup instead of chicken. Put hidden valley ranch dressing mix in meat instead of onion soup and put half a packet of onion soup in with golden mushroom soup. Excellent.

Great Recipe! Easy, no-fuss dinner. All I had was condensed Golden Mushroom soup, so I used that instead of the cream of chicken. Also, I had no au jus mix, so I put a few dashes of Worcestishire Sauce, onion powder and diced onions/mushroms. Served with mashed potatoes and peas/carrots. Turn out great. Hubby and baby ate it all! :-)

I thought these were very tasty and easy to put together.   My husband had cooked it in a stovetop but will definitely use the slow cooker the next time for that moist consistency.

I love all the suggestions about changing the recipe.  Because I know the taste my family likes most and if I can substitute something that I know they would like better I will.  And I might not have thought of it unless someone else suggested it first. Thanks

I just recently tried this recipe and the family loved it. They did suggest that the next time we make it we should use roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup and add bacon bits to the ground beef.

This is amazing comfort food.   Made it as stated, using Knorr French onion soup mix and forming 6 patties rather than 8.  My husband and I loved it!   Added lots of fresh ground pepper to the flour. Yum.

Used 3 lbs of g/b to help with the saltiness others described.  Cooked on the stove.  Browned the meat, then added the rest.  Covered and simmered for 15-20 min.  Delicious gravy.

Wonderful, we loved it. I'm always looking to save time, and this is certainly a time saver, and a GREAT idea. I think though that the grease issue may turn some people off -- it should be stressed... you must use VERY LEAN meat, or, as i do, ground turkey.  I mix a couple of spoonfuls of the onion soup mix in my ground turkey, I add onion and sometimes peppers.  I don't use cream of chicken, I try to stick with a beef flavor all around.. and I always add mushrooms to the sauce.. try it with a can of golden mushroom, whats' left of the onion soup mix and a bit of brown gravy mix. ... and dont forget to taste the sauce, if its too salty thin it out and then thicken with cornstarch, or do as I do, use lo or no salt options :) - This is a wonderful and delicious dish, but do think about you and your familys' tastes and adjust accordingly :) Thanks for a wonderful recipe Tesslynn :) We love it here!

A wonderful recipe. I make two slight adjustments. Instead of two cans condensed cream of chicken soup I use one cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom. I also replace the dry onion soup mix with an envelope of dry onion & mushroom soup mix. We've had this a number of times and thoroughly enjoy it.

Very, very easy and very good. It was slightly salty, but extremely flavorful. My very picky nine year old daughter finished her plate. I am quite picky myself and I had seconds. I used about 1.5 pounds of ground beef instead of two. 4 hours was plenty of time in the slow cooker. I cannot stress how simple this recipe was. A definite kid pleaser!!!

Delicious and very simple!  I switched out the cream of chicken soup with cream of mushroom since many reviewers suggested, and I'm really glad I did. Reminded me of the recipe from my childhood. It was given the thumbs up from the family, so I will be making this again!

Loved this recipe. I used venison and also added an egg to the meat mixture. I used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom instead of two cans of cream of mushroom. I also sliced a sweet onion to put in the sauce. It was amazing. The gravy was perfect! I will make this again for sure.

Great way to cook hamburger steaks.  Because we did not have access to a packet of gravy mix, we made our own: twist of fresh grated pepper, 1/2 cube vege bouillon, 1 cube beef bouillon, onion and garlic powder (1/4 tsp each), 2 tablespoon flour, 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch, 1 tablespoon catsup.  Will remember next time to make the hamburger steaks SMALLER, as they did not shrink much during cooking and were quite fat.  Good gravy - used fat free half and half in place of water.  Brown the hamburgers, added the soup and gravy and cream; covered and cooked at 180 degrees for 4 hours in the oven.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this tonight and it was a big hit. I did use half the onion soup mix as recommended by others. I used 1 can of golden cream of mushrooms and 1 cream of chicken. I also cooked on stove top and let it simmer for about an hour. I was pleased how tender the steaks turned out. Will make again.

My whole family likes it.  I didn't put the patties in the slow cooker, instead, I cooked them on the stovetop.  I also cut down the dry onion soup to half.

My husband made this a couple of weeks ago (he has recently had a desire to learn he to cook since I have been sick) we substituted the cream of chicken soup for cream of mushroom soup and  added 3/4 cup red wine (or you could use white wine) this was scrumptious. We served it over rice. We are fixing it again tomorrow.

This is a great dish. I have a lot of picky eaters in my house, and they all love this. Although in my opinion it needed some garlic to it. I add about a tablespoon of dried minced garlic to the meat mixture at the same time as everything else.

We have had these several times; once even for company. They are delicious! I did not cook them in a crock pot...just put them on top of the stove on low for several hours and it turned out very well. Served them with cheesy hash-brown casserole and roasted Brussels sprouts...everyone really enjoyed the meal.

I was a little leery when reading the ingredients but I trusted the reviews.  I did everything as it called for, incl using the cream of chicken.  I do NOT enjoy mushrooms so I wasn't even tempted to sub the cream of mushroom soup. However, it was very good.  You would've never known that cream of chicken was used in this recipe. It was creamy, smooth, still beefy and good.  It all cooks together wonderfully. I did add 1/2 of a sweet onion in the gravy(this was the only change I made)... it didn't hurt it but honestly, it didn't need it. The onion soup mix in the meat is enough and cooks in w/ the the gravy.  I added pepper while browning the patties and a good dose of it in the gravy to suit my taste.

Like other reviewers, I used cream of mushroom soup. Instead of the au jus and water, I used 1 can of French Onion soup. I also added fresh sliced mushrooms to the slow cooker in the last hour. This is absolutely delicious! It's a favorite for my boyfriend and I've made it 4 or 5 times now. Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone cleaned their plates!  Even the 4 and 6 year olds :).  I used 2 cans of progresso recipe starters ( garlic and mushroom) and a beef flavoring packet with a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce.  Used sirloin and it just melted in your mouth, adding mushrooms would be awesome!

This is my picky husband's favorite recipe! I do have to make a few ajustments but not many. Changing the cream of chicken to reduced sodium cream of mushroom is a must! And if you like lots of mushrooms you can throw in a can or fresh if you like. I also add a full cup of water and sometimes even a little more to thin out the gravy out. Other then that this recipe is perfect. We serve it over pasta and it'amazing! Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone loved this and that includes kiddos! I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I switched out the cream of chicken soup for a can of golden mushroom and a can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic. Very very good!

Good, but I agree with another reviewer that said it was easier to cook the recipe on the stove or in an electric skillet and let it simmer for 10 minutes. Turned out fine and I made a 12 steaks by doubling the ground beef.  It was perfect and not too salty.  If you are only making 2 pounds of ground beef, cut the soup and dry soup mixes in half to avoid an over salty dish.

Easy to make and was well -received by my family.  I found the salt and strong flavor from the soup mix to be somewhat overwhelming for my individual taste- if you double the recipe, this is not an issue.  Perhaps, for those who dislike so much sodium flavor, try cutting back in the soup mix amount or find a low-sodium alternative.  I also added freshly-chopped onions, which enhanced the texture and subtle flavor.  While I personally do not care for the flour and frying, which makes the meat feel dense and somewhat "pasty" to me, my family devoured all of this and remarked over and over about how much they loved it.  All in all a decent recipe for a meal that is very filling and relatively easy to make, frying excluded.

This is so good, and nice to come home to dinner.  I did think it was a bit too salty.  Next time (there definately will be a next time), I will use low sodium soup to help with that.

This was waaay too salty for my taste! I think it's the au jus mix. If I try this again, I would substitute beef stock or broth for the au jus.

Super easy and super good. I didn't even bother to brown them and they came out great...yummy with some home made mashed potatoes. Kids loved it too! I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken. Everything else was the same.

I really like this recipe. But like some of the other reviews say, I too decided to tweak this a little bit on my second go-round. I omitted one of the cans of cream of chicken and added one can of cream of mushroom. I omitted the plain dry onion soup mix and use the dry onion & mushroom mix Lipton makes. And I add sliced onions and mushrooms a little more than half-way through the cooking process. I love it!

Great recipe! Easy,delicious My family really liked this. I used a packet of brown gravy mix in mine. I served it over Farfalle pasta.Next time I make this, I think i will make the whole thing in my electric skillet as another reviewer suggested and i would add sliced onions and fresh mushrooms for the sauce.

I thought this recipe is pretty good, but the gravy/sauce was not really my taste.  It would have been pretty good with egg noodles as a sauce, but for mashed potatoes it was not the best.  I do like the slow cooker idea and the meat was very moist.  Next time I will use cooking method, but will add cream of mushroom soup to sauce.

Great meal.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken as suggested by another review.  I also added a cup and a half of water to my gravy because I thought the gravy was too thick to cook that long.  I also added a bayleaf and a few sprinkles of garlic powder... and fresh cracked black pepper.  
Being that I work full time, mine cooked for 8 hours, instead of 5 on low.  It turned out wonderfully tender.  My family LOVED it.

Loved it!  Used low sodium chicken soup and only half of the onion soup mix. Added a dash of Worcestershire to the gravy. Cooked on stovetop to save time and dishes.

Very good and very easy! I halved this recipe and based on feedback, used mushroon soup. I didn't have any seasoned bread crumbs but did have some instant potato mix so used that instead. Also, didn't have time for the slow cooker so did it stove top. Came out great! Served with egg noodles and broccoli. Yum!! Will definitely make again.

This was just excellent.  It was nice and moist and tasty.  Just try to get sodium reduced soups if you can find them.   I also added garlic and of course ground pepper as I thought it should have some spice to it.  Don't add any salt though.

we enjoyed this dish, but it was a bit salty.  Not sure how to reduce the salt as it is in the au jus and onion soup mix.

This was amazing! I didn't think it was too salty at all!  I halved the recipe, using the full packet of onion soup mix and two cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of just one.  I also threw in a container full of sliced mushrooms, cooked for 10 hours on low and it turned out wonderfully!  I might try using gravy mix instead of au jus next time, just because I wanted to have thicker gravy (that or use cornstarch).  Thanks for the recipe-I'll make this again soon!

Made meatballs instead of patties...had to scale down a bit on the meat..used only a pound and a half ground round, with only half of a package of Beefy Onion dry soup mix as well as added a few good dashes of Spicy Monterey Steak seasoning and an egg - Kept the sauce same.  It's a Keeper !!

i am not a person who enjoys ground beef--neither eating it or even worse: touching it! But I made this today and it was really quite great. everyone ate it, and liked it. yes, it is a bit salty, so what i did was added no salt to the mashed potatoes and that kinda balanced it out a bit. i would make it again. i cant believe how easy and foolproof it is!!!

Ok i read the reviews and i thought about not adding all the soup mix because i was scared it would be to salty...well then i decided  just make it the way it was wrote...I am sooo glad i did! My husbands words "this tastes like a hungryman dinner! the kids asked me if we could have it again tomorrow...thanks for the share!
OK i had to re-rate this a little..I have made it once and my daughter made it last night. Mine turned out like i said above and hers turned out like everyone else said...to salty. but we kinda picked this apart and the best i can figure it is the aju sauce that is causing the salty flavor so next time I will cut back just a bit and see if that helps! BUT YUM YUM YUM!!!

This was very good a keeper for sure. I omitted the aus jus and used 2 cans of beef gravy with sodium reduced cream of mushroom soup with some worcestershire sauce. When frying I didn't use the flour and it fed 5 adults 3 kids. Awesome.

This is really delicious, I did make a few changes: used ground turkey instead of beef, used cream of mushroom soup vs. cream of chicken, and panko bread crumbs vs. Italian, and added a few dashes of Worcester sauce.  But really good and super easy.

Hubby and I both liked this recipe.  The only change I made was to use cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken soup.  The next time I make this recipe, I think I'll use lower-sodium ingredients as it came out just a bit too salty.  That said, it still tasted fabulous, and I'll definitely make it again.

I made this for dinner a few nights ago, and we weren't impressed with the results at all. The consistency and texture of the beef was kind of gross - but I generally don't like 'fillers' like bread crumbs in my meat - and the sauce was really thick and tasted like nothing but canned soup. We probably won't make this again.

This Recipe is awesome, husband loved it as did coworkers with the leftovers, only made slight changes instead of onion soup mix, used 1 package brown gravy mix, and instead of the cream of chicken soup, used cream of mushroom, and added fresh sliced mushrooms. Will make often. TY

Just took this out of the slow cooker and it is DELICIOUS!
The only change I made was: I added some black pepper and a few dashes of Worchester Sauce.
Thank you for a wonderful recipe   :)

Yummy!  I
used ground sirloin and  added sauteed mushrooms and onions.  I also simmered it on the stove top about an hour and a half instead of using the crockpot.  Rave reviews!

I took into account all of the other reviews before I made this recipe and used a couple of other peoples revisions.  My husband said "Don't ever lose this recipe," because this is the best Salisbury Steak he has ever had!  I supplemented the Onion Soup w/ Beefy Onion Soup packet.   I supplemented one can of Cream of Chicken Soup w/ Cream of Mushroom Soup.  I added one tbsp. of minced garlic in olive oil to the gravy and used 1/4 cup of merlot and 1/2 cup of beef broth instead of the water!  I also added sliced Portabello Mushrooms in the last thirty minutes of cook time!  This was EXCELLENT!!!!!  I'll be making this recipe the rest of my life!

This was really easy and very tasty.  I never quite follow a recipe (even my own) and this one is very versatile.  Herbs are an easy addition to the meat mixture to change it up a a bit.  I also added cayenne pepper because we seem to love it in so many things.  Also I subbed mushroom gravy mix for the au jus as that is what I had on hand.  Quick tip...if you are trying to watch carbs as we do...omit the flour and milk and just add a couple of eggs.  Also I freeze leftover whole wheat buns and bread and just pop them in the toaster after defrosting to make homemade whole grain bread crumbs.  Cheap and easy!

5 star with several reviewers input - after reading a lot of reviewers say too salty and why use cr. of chx with beef? Here's how to turn this 4 star into 5 stars:  (1) use 1/2 pkt dry onion soup mix (I had Lipton mushroom and onion soup mix and it was great); (2) I used Pacific's Portabello ready to serve cream of mushroom soup in a 32 oz. box and I added the whole thing and omitted the water; (3) added 1 cup of dehydrated mushrooms that gave it a rich flavor; (4) added 2 cloves minced garlic to meatballs (5) omitted bread crumbs - don't need it to stay together and don't need extra salt or carbs.  I also saved the step and didn't brown my meat, eliminating the flour and oil.  Served with mashed potatoes and the gravy and fresh green beans with mushrooms from this site.  Awesome meal and great to see my NC mtn hubby so satisfied with a heathly meal.

This was excellent.  Used cream of mushroom soup.  Gravy was excellent on noodles.

Very Yummy! Following advice, I used a low sodium cream of mushroom soup and added quartered potatoes to reduce the salt. I then added sliced baby bella mushrooms about 1 hour prior to serving. So delicious, it reminded me of the TV dinners I used to eat like crazy as a kid!

My steaks fell apart in the cooker.  Perhaps I should have added an egg to the mixture.  Nevertheless, the meal was good by serving it as a hearty meat-filled gravy over mashed potatoes.

The whole family raved of the yummyness. The only thing i changed was, I used cream of mushroom soup. Also, I sliced some carrots and mushrooms and threw them in.

This recipe was just OK.  The beef was too dense and needed more bread crumbs and milk.  the gravy was good but I did change it to low sodium cream of mushroom soup after reading the reviews.  I'll make the gravy portion of this recipe again but not the beef.

Oh this is money. My family loved it so much. I made a few changes and I think I'm gonna do a little more but why not have fun with your food? The onion soup mix was the onion/mushroom. I used plain bread crumbs and seasoned it with onion powder, garlic powder, thyme, parsley, sage, salt, and pepper. I used sliced mushrooms, cream of mushroom soup, and beef broth. I didn't put this in my slow cooker I had ran out of time so I pan fried the patties made the gravy and let it stew in the pan for bout an hour. The gravy was perfect and the patties were incredibly moist. What I would do different is put the au ju mix back in the recipe (I shied away reading that this meal was salty) and add sliced onions. I think this recipe should taste more beefy and savory. Amazing meal!

Great flavor. It is a bit salty, but if you top potatoes or noodles, it helps. I also like salty things, though.

Really tasty as written! Very much a comfort food type recipe.  I added red potatoes piled under the meat, cut up in small cubes, and they cooked perfectly.  Went well with collard greens on the side.  Everyone in the family loved this dish, and fought over leftovers the next day!  Thanks for posting.

Very good!  I added sauteed mushrooms and onions to the gravy mix and I also substituted cream of mushroom soup because that is what I had in the cabinet.

This was very good.  I cut the recipe in half.  I  added a package of sliced Baby Bella mushrooms.  Next time I will use 2 cans of mushroom soup and double the au jus and water to have more gravy.  We really enjoyed this.

The sauce was so simple and super delicious! I found that I had too much meat going on and worried that these steaks would not cook completely in time...I'll just half the ground beef next time & make the patties thinner. Still, it's a keeper, thanks!

Wonderful!  I made a slight change - omitted the water and used beef broth instead as I had some in the fridge that needed to be used up.  I also did everything on the stove and it was fantastic.  However, after setting in the pan a half hour after dinner the gravy was very salty as compared to eating it right away.

I wanted a new slow cooker recipe and this fit the bill.  I wasn't blown away by the flavor, but I think I'll try it again with ground turkey and different seasonings.  This was a good base recipe to give me ideas.

I made the patties exactyly like the recipe said, removed them from my electric skillet then sauted some onion garlic and mushrooms. I took some beef boulion and mixed it with hot water to disolve, mixed some cream of mushroom soup with it, poured 1/2 in tthe skillet with the mushrooms and onion mixed it up placed the patties on top of that and poured the rest of the "gravy" over the patties. Let it simmer for about 30 minutes (enough time to make mashed potatoes) and they loved it!

I used a pound of ground beef and a pound of ground sirloin for more flavor. I cut back on onion soup mix as other suggested. I also did everything in a skillet on the stovetop. Taste great! I would definitely make it again.

Tasty!  I didn't have time for the slow cooker so just browned on the stove (both sides), dumped the grease and then added in the 'gravy' and let them simmer for 20 or so minutes.  Definitely salty but not overly so.  I used reduced sodium cream of mush.  I never though of adding au jus as a gravy.  We enjoyed!

The au jus mix is overpowering..  The breadcrumbs and flour combination are too much, making the meat mealy.  This is very high sodium.  I wouldn't make it again.

VERY tasty - I DID think it was a bit salty, as others have said - however, my husband thought it was perfect. Next time I'm compromising with low-sodium cream of chicken. Very flavorful and very tender steaks! Thanks for the recipe!

This was easy and delicious though I made changes because I didn't have some of the stuff on hand.  Instead of onion soup mix, I diced up finely one onion, added celery seed, pepper and a teaspoon of sugar to the ground beef.  Instead of the au jus and cream of chicken, I used a can of cream of golden mushroom soup and that made a very nice gravy.  Our new family favourite.

As some suggested, I used 1 can Golden Mushroom and 1 can Cream of Mushroom soups instead of the chicken soup.  VERY SALTY.  Husband hated it.  I would only make it again in emergencies if I was stuck on a deserted island with only these ingredients.

I thought this was great so did my husband and 7 year old.  I took the advise of others and I used low sodium cream soup to cut down on the salt.  I used roasted garlic bread crumbs too.  I used one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of golden mushroom soup.  I think it made richer gravy.  Great weeknight meal!!

Very good and easy. Sometimes you just want some comfort food, and this recipe fills the bill, especially if you don't want to have to throw it together after coming home from work.

Instead of using the slow cooker, I cooked the salisbury steak in a skillet. I followed the directions in the recipe. The only adjustments I made was by adding one can of cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic to the recipe. I browned the patties first, added the soup and au jus mixture and let it simmer for 40 minutes. Delicious!!!!

I took advice of others since we are not big cream of chicken or mushroom lovers... added a jar of beer gravy instead... I also did this with deer cube steaks -- the meat is already lien & they came out very tender - would do again..

We LOVED this recipe.  Even our 17 month old ate an entire patty with mashed potatoes.  It's a great twist for ground beef.  It seems like all we ever use ground beef for is hamburgers or pasta dishes, so this is definitely a good change of pace.  In fact, we've fixed it twice in the last 2 weeks.  We didn't change a thing.  It's quite easy as well.  Hope you try it!

This was GREAT!  My husband and two young children loved it!  I ran out of time to do it in the crock pot, so after I browned the patties in a skillet, I drained the excess oil, returned the patties to the skillet, poured the mixed sauce ingredients over them and simmered, covered, for about 30 minutes, or until no longer pink.  Served over mashed potatoes.  This would be a great week night recipe too!

Easy.  Tasty.  Salty.  But to be expected with all the processed mixes.  Opt for low sodium options if possible.

I halved the recipe and it came out great.  It was a little on the salty side, so I would suggest lower sodium soup.

Really good, family liked it...was missing something...next time I will add a tablespoon of minced garlic and some pepper...it tasted a little bland to me.  I added a beef bouillon like another reviewer did because I didn't have au jus mix.  I also used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken.  Will make again...great with mashed potatoes because there is plenty of gravy!

Awesome recipe, I did take some reviewers advice and use cream of mushroom soup since I do like it much better.  I also made this a second time, and that time I cooked a package of sliced mushrooms in butter and bits of the hamburger grease and spooned them on top of the patties, that I had layered in a casserole dish.  Then I added a package of brown gravy mix to the cream of mushroom soup sauce to darken and beef it up a bit, covered and cooked it for little over an hour at 350.  My family really liked the changes, and to me it was much easier than using the crock pot.  But when I'm working overtime I could sure see putting it back in the crock pot.  This will sure be a regular on my table. TY for this recipe!

This was very easy and a nice quick and hearty meal.  My husband did comment on the consistency of the meat patties, as some of them fell apart in the slow cooker.  I'm not sure what can be done to bind them better, but I will investigate for next time.

I made this for a house full of family.  All the plates were cleaned and the kids even ate it.  The reason it got 4 stars, though, is I found it way too salty.  Most in my family didn't agree, but I am sensitive to the salt.   I increased the meat to 3# of meat, but still used just one packet of the onion soup mix - so I thought this would help decrease the salty taste.  I would have enjoyed chopping fresh onions instead of the onion soup mix, I think.  Or, next time I will try the potatoes that other viewers mentioned.   I did increase the sauce, since I used 3# of meat.  I had to mix both cr. of chicken and cr. of mushroom - since that was what was in the cupboard.  I also added a small can of mushrooms and more water.  The sauce was yummy.

Delicious! Great base recipe... Used pre-made chopped sirloin patties (just cause I had them)...dredged in flour with granulated garlic, pepper and mrs dash. Fried up some chopped onion in the pan after browning the patties (thought the onion soup powder would make it too salty). Didn't have au jus, so substituted a packet of roast gravy with 2 cans of mushroom soup and a can of mushroom pieces. Perfect with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli on a cold, stormy day!

My family loved this comfort meal.  My only change will be to use reduced sodium soups. It was a little too salty for our tastes and that is without adding any additional salt to the recipe.  It will definitely be in my rotation though!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because the first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it was too salty and I wasn't fond of the cream of chicken flavor.  The second time I made it, it was fantastic and now my favorite dinner.  To make this a 5 star recipe I used a packet of brown gravy mix instead of au jus and substituted low sodium beef broth for the water, I also used low sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  I used 4% fat beef and it held together very well, you could even use 7% fat.  This was soo incredibly good the second time around with the alterations made.

I usually don't make Salisbury steaks but I saw this recipe and decided to try it. It was very,very good,my mother kept going on and on,I never heard of 'slow cooking a Salisbury steak!' but I did and we all liked how it turned out,the only two changes that I did to it was I added garlic powder when I made the patties and I used beef broth instead of water,yum!

Awesome!  So easy to put together, I just browned the beef in the evening, and the next morning threw it all the crockpot before work.  Came home to a hot meal and a great smelling apartment!

This was an excellent recipe! You definetly need to use lean ground beef. The only changes I made was to use beef broth instead of water and I also used the low salt version of the cream of mushroom soup. This is one my family said to make again quickly!

This is one of my favorite new recipes!!!  I have made it twice, and stuck a bit more to the recipe the second time which worked out better.  The first time I thought I'd be fancy and make my own gravy using a roux and beef stock.  Well, I didn't have nearly enough gravy, so next time I stuck to the recipe and it was much better.  I also don't use my crock pot, but brown it in a cast iron skillet and then put in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes, then lower the temperature and do another 20-30 minutes.  Always so tender!

Good home-cookin' recipe.  Nice beefy flavor.  Used low-sodium cream of chicken soup to reduce salty flavor.  Still pretty salty but no one complained.

This recipe was good.  I made a few changes; I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken and used low sodium beef broth in place of au jus.  I didn't think it was too salty, maybe this was due to the low sodium broth.  I added corn starch to the gravy and it thickened up and looked great.  I don't think this recipe is going to wow anyone, but it is good.

Very good.  There was quite a bit of grease in the gravy when it was done, so next time I'm going to use 93% lean hamburger.

This was so easy and very tasty, we did not find it too salty...but it is salisbury steak, so you have to expect some saltiness. Made some mashed potatoes and had 2 full meals out of it. It's always good when you look forward to left-overs!!

My husband didn't want me to make it.  He called it mystery meat in slop.  I made it anyway and he loved it!  I made it for my step daughter who hates it and she went back for seconds! I prefer to make it in the electric skillet.  The crock pot burnt part of it and the gravy had to be altered afterwards.

We loved this recipe.  I used one lb. of hamb. and browned it in a hot skillet.  Then I drained off the grease.  I made my own gravy from the drippings. ( No soup and no au jus packet).  I used one TB. of dry onion soup mix.  It was delicious and I will make it again.  It was not too salty.  I love having things ready in the slow cooker!

I have been using this recipe for awhile now and I think it is the best Salisbury Steak recipe I have ever tried. I make it with Ground Turkey and I add Mushrooms. One time I substituted Brown Gravy for the Au Jus since I was out and it came out delicious!

This will be one to make because it is so flavorful and simple.  I was suprised how good it really came out because it didn't look like it would be that good at first.  I made mashed po-tats on the side and the gravy was perfect.  The only change I made was that I didn't use a whole packet of the soup mix because I didn't want it to be too salty.

Be sure to make the patties pretty thin. They swell up alot after absorbing the gravy and will take twice as long to cook all the way through. It is salty but not unbearably so. Overall pretty good.

This was a good recipe. I didn't use the crockpot. I used an electric skillet, turned out great. I did add another package of au jus mix (followed the directions on the back of the package) This cut down on the salteness of the sauce a little.
My kids didn't like the onion because the meat cooked faster in the skillet the onion stayed a little hard. 
Other than that this recipe was a keeper.

This was excellent!  We like our food a bit salty, but I did use low sodium soup and it was perfect.  For extra gravy I added one extra can of soup...substituted 2 packages brown gravy mix for the 1 package of au jus and 1 extra cup of water...it was perfect.

This was a fun, easy recipe.  I appreciated the advice of the other reviewers and halved the onion soup mix and used low sodium chicken soup.  Next time, I will try adding potatoes and/or fresh mushrooms.  This one is a keeper!

These are easy and taste great. I agree with other reviewers - double the gravy so you have plenty for mashed potatoes! My son, who loves the frozen dinner salisbury steaks, has been converted to home made now.

Great recipe, just make sure and use low sodium soups or the salt is a bit much.  I add sauteed portabella mushrooms toward the end.

This is one of my husband's favorite recipes! (Or it was, before he started eating healthier!) Everyone in my family likes it. It is definitely very salty, but we like it that way. I add pepper to the ground beef mixture. I have used substitutes with good results, like cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken, or a can of beef consumme instead of the au jus mix & water. Use the leanest meat you can afford! I usually use 85/15, and find it is easy to spoon most of the grease off the top with a spoon. I always serve it with mashed potatoes.

I hated the flavor of the meat.. the gravy sauce was good with mashed potatoes.  The rest of the family loved it.. so we'll go 3 stars!

This recipe is very easy to make.  Using a slow cooker makes it convenient.
Add mashed potatoes and broccoli casserole, you have a wonderful meal.

I did as others suggested and used low sodium soup, and added red cooking wine and worchestershire sauce to the gravy mix. It was excellent!!!! I also made some "make ahead mashed potatoes", and put them in the oven about an hour before serving. The whole family ate it all up. No leftovers for me to take to work! Thank you!!!

i followed the recipe exactly - result -good flavor but way too salty, hence the 4 stars.  read other reviews before you make this so that you can fix this problem - perhaps using the low sodium cream of chix soup and perhaps 1/2 italian, 1/2 regular bread crumbs as suggested by others. next time i'll also add another can of soup to make more gravy.

I'm really sensitive to salty foods so I was careful when reading reviews and used low sodium chicken soup (x2).  It was great!  I didn't change this recipe other than that but might add a few 'glugs' of worcestershire sauce as someone else said, and used low sodium chicken soup as previously suggested.  The 'steaks' were huge.  I would probably make 10 instead of 8 patties next time.  Served this over mashed potatoes.  The color of the sauce was funny until around the third hour, then it turned into the dark rich colored gravy that I was expecting.  Great meal - the sauce is great.

Very yummy - the husband and kids eat it up.  Like some of the other reviewers, I find it cooks up in about 2 to 3 hours.  I add a little Vouvre wine and it adds a nice flavor.

As a salisbury steak lover, I thought this recipe surpassed any frozen variation! I followed this recipe nearly exactly, except I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken soup. I have added this recipe to the keeper pile!

This is a very tasty recipe for salisbury steak, but it's a little too salty for our tastes.  I will look for a similar recipe that doesn't use such a high level of salt from prepared seasoning packets.  I recommend using low sodium soup at least.

I used the beef broth as suggested in one of the reviews. But  I won't add it the next time I do it.  It made it too salty.  I still rated this 5 stars because the flavor is wonderful.  I'm pleased to have found such an easy, no hassle recipe.  I will make this again next week without the broth.

My mother-in-law makes a similar dish.  I made this for my husband and he says it's better than mom's. I used cream of mushroom and the leanest ground beef I could find. This is a must over mashed potatoes. Comfort food at it's best.

My family really enjoyed this recipie.  I made two changes, I used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom.  I also added 1/2 pound of extra meat so that it would not be as salty.  It turned out perfect.  I used the leanest meat I could find to keep from being to gressy.

This was excellent and will go into my regular recipe rotation.  My kids loved it and I liked it, too.  However, I can see how this has the possibility to become too salty, so I used the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and used low sodium soup.  It came out great and the gravy was good for a side of noodles.

When asked for the recipe you know it's a hit.  I prepared this recipe along with my turkey at Thanksgiving and it went over better than the turkey.  It was also so easy to prepare. I used another persons hint and added an extra cup of water and it turned out great.  Thanks.

Delicious!  I halved the recipe and made 5 patties.  Only real changes I made were to used canned beef gravy instead of the cream of chicken soup and I added a 1/4 cup more water than the halved recipe called for.  Very tasty - way better than frozen - and the extra gravy was great on instant mashed potatoes.  Also served with veggies.  Easy, tasty dinner idea - and great comfort food!!

UPDATE: Made again using condensed French Onion soup - again, very good, although the sauce was thinner.

I was worried that this would end up tasting like hamburger, but it actually had quite a decent steak-y taste. The 2 things that let it down were - 1. the sauce was SO salty. 2. The meat was a little bland (could have done with some garlic, onion powder etc etc). I would make it again but with some modification. Oh, I don't have a slow cooker, so I baked it, covered, in the oven for an hour.

My family loved this recipe!!!  My computer wasn't working at the time so I couldn't get at the recipe but I was able to remember everything pretty well.  I did add 2 cups of water, OOPS but it still turned out great and there was lots of leftover gravy for mashed potatoes.  I will definately be making this one again!

According to my husband, this receipe was good, but a bit salty...even though I added 1/4 cup more water, & used low sodium soup. I'm not normally a salisbury steak fan, so I don't have anything to compare it to. For some reason the gravy was pretty oily even though I used lean ground beef.  Not sure if that's normal either, but overall, it was decent.

I think the recipe as written is delicious, but is a little too salty for my liking. I have made this recipe twice. The first time I followed recommendations from some reviews, and substituted a can of onion soup for one of the cans of cream of chicken and omitted the onion soup packet. The second time, I followed the recipe as written. I preferred the recipe with the substitutions. Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe.  It is sooooo easy.  My husband likes it served with egg noodles and always requests that I make extra gravy.  I first made it at home but then made it a regular when on the road in the motorhome.  Great for the camping trips because it doesn't take a lot of time.  Just put it in the slow cooker and walla!  A delicious meal 4 to 5 hours later.   EASY and DELICIOUS.

Made it for a 70s themed party and it was the hit of the party! Every single person asked for the recipe.  I made it just like the instructions, except I added fresh onions to the gravy.  Once I had browned the patties I just used the same pan to brown some sliced onions and then added them to the pot.

Easy and fantastic! I almost switched out the cream of chicken to cream of mushroom soup but opted to stick with recipe as written first time through. Other reviews referenced it being too salty, but when served with potatoes I found I didn’t have to salt the potatoes and it was great. Recommend keeping some type of potatoes involved as a side for that reason. I may try it with cream of mushroom soup next time and may add fresh mushrooms as well. I even think the sauce could be used over stew meat for a stroganoff . Will definitely make again-

I made these in the pan instead of slow cooker. Also added mushrooms and frozen green peas toward the end when the soup was cooking. Didn't have the aux jus mix so I just used beef broth and a dash of Worcestshire.

Very good but beware of the Au Jus mix.  It is VERY salty.  I ended up toning my gravy down with some sour cream. Delicious with mashed potatoes

I only had a packet of beef gravy, so used that, added granulated garlic & coarse pepper to b urger mix.
When made the gravy, again, added granulated garlic & pepper, a scoop of better than beef (bullion), a few dashes of worchestershire .   I sliced an onion & put pver burgers in crock pot, then added gravy.  Turned out great.  Have made it like this 3-4 times.

Very good and easy. I will be quadrupling the sauce next time since it seemed to "cook off" and I love it over the Salisbury steak and rice. Also, my patties took longer than 5 hours on low to cook. That could have been because they were thicker (?) but don't know. I will most definitely be making this again!

This turned out great and really does taste like Salisbury Steak. Only suggestion I would make is that if you have several people in the house that love gravy then I would double the contents for the gravy. Otherwise a great recipe that doesn’t take a whole lot of prep and time to make.

Omg! This was soooooo good! I made it last night and it was Amazing. I read the previous comments about it being too salty and took notes. I only used 2/3 packet of onion soup. And instead of the cream of mushroom or cream of chicken, I used I jar of Heinz brown gravy mixed with the au jus packet and water for the gravy. Not at all salty. So delicious.  I will definitely be making this again. Restaurant quality for sure.

I paired this with wide egg noodles and I didn’t have any brown gravy mix so I used a little bit of Ajou mixed with water and better than Bouillon beef and the secret ingredient was I added white pepper?...absolutely delish and comfort food at it finest!

This recipe was delicious! Definitely took over 15 minutes of prep time, however- closer to 30 minutes. I substituted cream of mushroom soup for the chicken soup, and used Italian chicken seasoning instead of the bread crumbs. The Salisbury steak came out so moist and soft after 4h 15m in my slow cooker.

This was DELICIOUS!  Made this the other night and my family and I LOVED it.  The gravy is what was really, really put it over the top.  I was eating it with a spoon by itself afterwards.  Definitely serve with mashed potatoes or something else that is good to serve gravy over because you don't want to let any drop go to waste.  Will be making this again and again for sure!

Good, easy recipe but only earned 3 stars from me because it is way, way too salty. May try again using jarred gravy that I am familiar with.

After reading reviews I decided to use half the package of French onion soup mix in the meat and half in the gravy. I also made it in an electric skillet as suggested by another reviewer. I liked the flavor of the meat but didn’t care much for the gravy. It tasted too much like cream of mushroom soup and not beefy. I made a few meatballs and baked them in the oven as one grandchild cannot have dairy. I forgot about them and overcooked them but want to try that again sometime.

Holy smokes! This was sooooo good!!! And simple! I made it with homemade mashed potatoes and butter carrots. The whole family loved it, which includes four year old twins who are very quick to offer their opinions on meals. Kudos to whoever created this dish.

Surprisingly tasty! Couldn’t give it 5 stars since I felt like it was so full of high-sodium soups and mixes. But if I went on taste alone, this is pretty yummy!

This recipe is perfect! I was worried about it being too salty, but it wasn't. Instead of the crock pot, I seared it in my cast iron skillet, poured the gravy on top, covered with foil and baked it in the oven at 350 for an hour. PERFECT!

Amazing!  I, myself,  and my family loved it. First time I have ever made Salisbury steak homemade and I will not be fixing it any other way from now on.  I, like a few others,  comes this on the stove and  didn't usea crock pot. Turned out wonderful.  The only con, like others have mentioned,  It was a tad bit salty. But other than that,  I recommend it 100%. Very good.

My family loved it! I used golden mushroom soup instead of the creamy chicken.  I also put fresh cut mushrooms on top before closing the lid to crock pot. Went outside to work for the day and came back to a wonderful dinner. I served over mash potatoes.

I have made this many times. I use ground turkey instead of beef and it turns out perfect every time. I don't dredge the patties in flour as I've found they brown just fine without it (didn't have flour one time). I also add sliced onions on the bottom, between the layers or patties, and on top. I love this recipe.

This was surprisingly delish - I like to make comfort foods in fall and winter on occasion- this year I got an early start ;/  but it was worth a bit of calories. My husband and son loved it too !  It made exactly 8 decent size parties , they were very flavorful with the onion mix - so if you're not such a fan of that , you may want to 1/2 it . I def will make this again !

I love this recipe and will recommend it! It was so good! Maybe less milk next time, as the patties were not staying together well. Making it part of my go to set of recipes!

My husband and son loved this dish! I followed the recipes exactly and cooked on low for five hours. Served with homemade mashed potatoes and sweet peas and it was a hit. I forgot to take a picture, however, I will definitely make again so a picture for sure next time.

Super easy. Followed recipe but also sautéed 1 medium Yellow Onion, 8 oz. Baby Bell Mushrooms,  2 Cloves Garlic. Added all together and followed directions from there. Served with Salad and Fresh French Bread. 
Was a wonderful cozy dinner for a cold Fall night. 
Will repeat the same way for guests this Winter.

My husband loved it, but says it’s too salty. 2nd day was even saltier. I added canned mushrooms to the mix. Warning: If you’re like me and do not like hamburger, do t make this, it’s more like meatloaf than Salisbury steak.

This is a good recipe. It's easy to make  though I used a big skillet instead of a crock pot. I wonder if making a meatloaf and the gravy would even easier. (I'm retired and am always looking for ways to make a meal less work :) )

This recipe was very easy and delivered on flavor. If I were to make it again, I would substitute on of the cans of Cream of Chicken with Cream of Mushroom and add a cup of thinly sliced mushrooms.

I used 1 and 1/2 lb of hamburger for 3 people.
I added sliced Portobello mushrooms to the bottom of the slow cooker and placed the patties on top. I used Low Sodium cream of chicken soup.  Deep rich flavor. Great dish for Sunday dinner.

Great recipe with some changes. It was salty even though I used low sodium soup. Next time I will use half of the onion soup mix. It was just fine with cream of chicken but will try cream of mushroom next time. Add some Worcestershire.

Not sure what I did wrong, but after 7 hours in crock pot on low, meat was still slightly raw looking inside. The taste of the gravy was good.

Only gave four stars because I modified it to our taste. 1/2 of soup mix, beef broth for water, low sodium soup. Cooked 4.5 hours and will freeze half.

I made this for my family and they loved it! My wife is hard to please and she thought it was great! I had to use a French Onion Dip mix packet instead of the soup packet but otherwise, I stuck to the recipe. My wife has asked me to fashion the patties into meatballs next time, so I'll probably do that to keep her happy. Very satisfying meal.

I made it in the electric skillet since it was too late to use the crock pot. I only used half of the onion soup mix, and I used half and half of the  bread crumbs, plain and Italian. I did not have any au jus mix. But I had some liquid that I used instead. I also added the Worcestershire sauce to the hamburger. It was not salty, I even used the cream of chicken soup. I served it over noodles, and my husband thought it was good also. I made 6 big patties, so we have enough for the next two nights! I will make it again!

I used only beef broth instead of milk as we had a guest with lactose intolerance. I used a whole can as well as we used an instant pot and needed the liquid for pressure and only half cup of water instead. in the instant pot we did it for 30 minutes and a 10 minute natural release and it turned out great still very juicy and had great flavor.

I used the quick skillet version used a half pack of onion soup since everyone said a full pack was too salty. Me and my wife really enjoyed it with string beans and white rice.

I made this last night for dinner. We loved it. Delicious recipe. Because you use 85/15  ground beef, the end product is not too greasy and when cutting into it, it will crumble nicely,not clumpy chunks. WILL DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN. I always make homemade mashed potatoes, never instant. Also had asparagus with meal. Really good.

Absolutely delicious.  I didn't have regular onion soup mix, so I used beefy onion soup mix. Also, you should use lower fat content hamburger. I used 73% and it had alot of grease. But the taste was amazingly good. Awesome recipe. Family loved it too. Will be a regular meal in our home.

I have to say, this was really good, and even better the next day as leftovers.  I didn't change a thing except to add some pepper to the flour before frying.  I will definitely make this again.

This was really delicious and so easy,; I loved that it called for ingredients that are usually on hand in the pantry. !  I substituted red wine for the water and, because I hadn’t planned ahead, popped it in the oven rather than the crock pot. Using a covered baking dish, it took about 30 minutes to cook.

We did not have a package of Au jus(sp).   I used regular brown gravy mix.  Work out great.  I cut back the portions a little bit to yield 6 patties and split the finished potion in two.  The second half is in the freezer for a meal next week.

First of all the recipe is very very good. I followed the recipe to the T and it was easy. Some said it was salty not sure what they did. The meat and gravy was not salty at all. My husband loved loved it. Thank you for this great great recipe. I would not change a thing, oh except make more!!! I served it was mashed potatoes and asparagus.

I adjusted the ingredients by half as I only had one pound of ground bear meat, so I made four patties. If I didn't tell you it was bear, you would have sworn it was beef. lol. It was very good and I'm sure we will have it again. Like one of the other reviewers, I made garlic mashed potatoes to go with the gravy and a garden salad.

My only changes were using a good T of beef onion soup mix in meat and 1 Tbsp of  worstershire in soups.  Only golden mushroom.  Baked in oven for 90 min.  Used 1.14 lbs of sirloin, had 4 large patties.  Froze 2 and sauce for another meal.  Thank u for the beginning of a great dish and added it to company rotation.

Instead of adding 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, I just added 1 and substituted 1 can of cream of mushroom to cut down on the salt as others had recommended. 
My husband went back for thirds he enjoyed this meal so much. Adding it to my arsenal.

I only needed to make a serving for 4, so I used 1 lb ground beef and about half of all the ingredients, except I did use the entire au jus mix for the gravy. This was loved by all my family including my picky 1 year old.  I also started it late so I had the dish in the crock pot for an hour and a half on high, then turned it down to low. It was ready in about 2 1/2-3 hours

I halved the recipe, since there are only 4 of us, but, after the fact, I should have made the entire batch and frozen half of it for later. Anyway, had it not been for my error, it would have been so much better. I used the whole package of AuJus Gravy mix instead of halving it.  The meat and gravy was a bit salty, but not unbearable. I will save this and definitely make it again.

Delicious!! I didn’t use slow cooker or au jus packet. Instead I used 2 cans of beefy mushroom soup. I made in a pan.

This is an easy recipe and easily adjusted to the cook's taste.  I, for instance, used golden mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  Also, didn't use the entire package of dry onion soup mix.

This is a good recipe as written.  In general, the use of french onion soup packages and canned soup elevates the sodium levels.  I wish some smart person would come up with a good tasting recipe that replaces the packages and cans of high sodium ingredients.

My family liked this. The gravy was good on mashed potatoes too. The only thing I did different was I added a small can of cream of chicken soup with the one it called for and a little more water. I wanted to be sure it was enough gravy for potatoes too. There was plenty of gravy left over. No need to add any more soup. Very convenient to use the slow cooker. Thanks for this recipe. It is a keeper.

Delicious! Really does taste like the premade kinds, but is homemade!! Notes: I used one cream of chicken and one cream of celery (what I had on hand) and I used a brown gravy packet instead of au jus. Be sure to make the patties thin enough to cook through in the allotted time and are completely covered by sauce in crock.

This recipe for Salisbury Steak is amazing !!!!  
It was very easy and the meat is so tender, you can cut it with a fork.  The gravy is thick and tastes awesome !!!!  I highly recommend this recipe.

Very good, but I took the suggestion to just cook it on the stove top.  I only made 6 servings, so I used only 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, a beef boullion cube, gravy mix (I didn't have an aujus packet) and about 3 cups of water and let the gravy and hamburger patties simmer together.  I under salted the mashed potatoes that I served them with and the dish wasn't too salty.  I think the trick to the saltiness is the water content (or lack thereof).

This was a delicious meal!  It was easy to make, and although I had to make my own au jus mix because I didn't have any premixed on hand, I made more than I needed for this recipe so that the next time I make it I have all my seasonings ready. Plus, I saved money making my own because we all know those premixed packets (even the store brand) are way over priced. Mashed potatoes and corn are awesome side dishes to fo with it.  Thanks for this recipe!

I love making this for my family, everyone raved about how delicious it is. I usually pair this with a potato dish of sort and mixed veggies. I've made this several times, sometimes I use cream of mushroom soup cause that's what I have on hand.

I used the cream of mushroom soup as some other reviewers suggested. I was short on time so I used the high setting for 1.5 hours. I  anticipated 2 hours, but I checked the internal temperature at 1.5 hours and they were ready. Delicious 2 days in a row!

Very simple and delicious. I substituted cream of mushroom for the chicken and added a few more mushrooms. I'll definitely make again.

Great dish...a little salty because of the Au Jus and Cream of chicken soup.  Go with low salt ingredients.

Absolutely delicious and easy!  I followed the suggestions of a few other reviewers  and used ground sirloin and cream of mushroom soup (low sodium) and it came out perfect. A very savory dish and super easy to make. I highly recommend this dish!

I agree with some of the posts way too salty. This time I used reduced sodium soup and left out the packet of au jus (pure salt in a packet) I doctored it up with a little liquid smoke and some other spices. I grilled them in a grill pan the night before, to give them some grill marks,  then to the crock pot and gravy he next day. Very tasty definitely a redo - Just Dale ;>)

Just too heavy of a meal. Both of us felt disgusting afterwards. Taste was decent but if I made it again I would definitely not use both packets of seasoning. I would cut out the onion mix and use fresh onions instead.

If I would have followed this as written I would have rated it a 4 but based on other reviews I used low sodium one cream of mushroom and one low sodium cream of chicken and it was definately perfect so I’m eating it a 5. I’m afraid if I wouldn’t have used low sodium it would be too salty as many others mentioned.   Easy to fix, and super tasty!

This is good but way too salty, even after using low sodium soup. I’ll probably halve the onion soup next time and switch the soup to cream of mushroom.

This is super easy to make and so yummy.  The first time I made it I only had ground venison on hand.  Gave it a great flavor and it was very lean.  I made with lean ground beef the next time and it was greasy but so good.  I always try the recipes just as they are written the first time but do read the reviews too for any helpful hints.

The gravy was awful.  I ended up dumping it out part way through and using jarred beef gravy.  Then it came out really good.

I followed the recipe to a T. Mine came out hard as rocks. They weren't terrible but I didn't think they were great either.  The family was not interested in the leftovers. I don't think I will make it again.

Made this tonight and it was absolutely delicious. Campbell's now makes a cream of chicken and mushroom soup combination which I used in place of the regular cream of chicken soup. I do agree with most reviews that it was on the salty side, so next time I will make my own dry onion soup mix from the recipe on this site. Much less sodium than store bought. Otherwise a home-run. ??

I followed the exact recipe and found that the gravy was too salty.  The ground beef patties were very tender but I did not like the addition of the onion soup mix to the ground beef.  In the future, I would probably try it without the soup mix and with low-sodium cream of chicken soup.

This is a go to recipe for us when we need something in the crock pot on busy nights. I added sliced mushrooms because I love them. I also used only half of the onion soup and chose low sodium soup.

So this is the first receipe I'm leaving a review for because it was highly approved by my picky 8 year old! I followed this recipe to a T, except I made 6 patties instead of 8 and I diced up potatoes and threw them in. It was really good!! I will agree that it's a tad bit salty, and I may use the cream of mushroom instead. Really enjoyed this!

I made this and followed the recipe, and I will not make this version again. It was very bland, but more importantly the gravy was more oil rather than gravy.

I will make the dish again, but definitely adding more herbs and spices to give it flavor, and probably try incorporating a different gravy in order to cut down on the sodium and oil.

We just did not like the meat... I did increase the sauce and tossed it in some egg noodles. The egg noodles with the sauce was delicious, the meat was not so much.

Salisbury Steak reminds me of many meals my Mother used to make growing up.  As a child, I hated hamburgers but loved Salisbury Steak.  Wanting to go an easier route to make this great meal, the slow cooker was on point.  Hands down the best flavor combinations in this recipe.  I do make some alterations such as adding some pearl onions and mushrooms to the gravy sauce.  I also add mushrooms into the Salisbury Steak which is a huge hit with my husband.  He begs me to make "Gravy Burgers" all the time (it's what he calls them)

My guilty pleasure was once to buy the frozen Salisbury steak dinner I remembered as a child until I found this recipe. It is delicious but without the added chemicals and salts of prepared frozen foods.

So simple but so delicious. The steaks were fall-apart tender and so full of comforting homemade flavor. My husband loved it and wants it added to our favorites. My only issue is that, as some other reviewers noted, it is rather salty even though I scaled back a bit on the dry soup mix and au jus mix. Next time I'll use reduced-sodium cream of chicken soup and hop that helps. Otherwise this was a winner - and a keeper.

This was delicious and it is ready to go in the crock-pot this morning when my kids get up. I have to leave the house every morning at 4 am, so it is too early to put in the dinner. I prepare the night before and the kids put it in. They love this recipe and I did add Worcestershire sauce to the recipe that makes it really yummy!

Made this last week; excellent base recipe. Made a few changes going in. Halved the recipe, and ended up using 1 can golden mushroom soup instead of the suggested cream soup. Also added some chopped onion and sliced fresh mushrooms. Was worried about saltiness because I didn’t use low-sodium soup, but this turned out perfect for our taste. Served with mashed potatoes and peas. I’m making it again this week at my daughter’s request.

of course I will make it again...delicious gravy over mashed potatoes. Husband loved it too. Yes I always make changes but the basic recipe was followed by the skillet method and using jars of purchased gravy....I did not use the soups  but did use the suggestion as noted below the recipe

I made this recipe verbatim (which is something I rarely do). I was less than impressed. There was surprisingly little flavor. The meat texture was dry and the gravy thin. I will not make this again.

My husband is cooking illiterate. I left him all the ingredients and the recipe. Smelled delicious as soon as I walked in the house and the tastebuds were very happy! So much so that when I bought the leftovers to work, everyone tried and I had to immediately print out the recipe. He takes all the credit.

I've been cooking this dish for the past year or so and my family loves it. I don't find the gravy too salty since I serve it over plain rice. It balances out perfectly. I don't change anything either. It's perfect just the way it is.

Super easy Recipe. You can easily do this in a pot or skillet if you wanted to. I used the crock pot because it was convenient for me. I wish i had a photo but it went so fast i didn't get one in time lol. My family loved it.

It’s very rare that all four of my kids and husband all like the same recipe but they all lived this! I served it over mashed potatoes and with a steamed veggie! It’s become a staple in our house. The only change we prefer is cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken soup. Yum!

This is the best salisbury steak I have ever had and so good with mashed potatoes. I am on a sodium restricted diet so  so I made my own cream of chicken soup (use no sodium stock) and onion soup (use no sodium bouillon & add 1/2 tsp seasoning salt) from this website and au jus mix (no sodium bouillon & add 1/2 tsp of seasoning salt) from another website.

Delicious. I hadn’t had Salisbury steak since high school — and that was a long time ago.  This recipe scratched an itch that I didn’t realize I had. 

I changed a couple things. I swapped out one can of cream of chicken for a can of cream of mushroom. I also processed the soup mix into a finer mixture in the food processor because I worried the large slivers of dehydrated onion would make for a less cohesive patty. 

I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed green beans. Smiles all around the table!

So I can't cook but the recipe is super easy! I've probably cooked a handful of times in the past three years for my boyfriend and this is the only thing I've made that he keeps asking for more! I did substitute the cream of mushroom with cream of mushroom and chicken to kind of have next of both the recipe and the reviews.

This was fantastic! I also cooked it completely in a skillet. Once I was done browning the patties, I pulled them out and mixed the gravy ingredients in the used skillet and put the patties back in to cook in the simmering gravy. I also added a container of fresh mushrooms to cook in tut gravy. This is one of the best things I’ve made from AR. Serve it with mashed potatoes - yum!!

Husband raved about this, so will definitely cook again. Only changes I made to original recipe are: no oil, used 3 well tbsp of onion soup mix, and used 2 cans low sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. Cooked just under 5 hours on Low. Served with packaged mashed potatoes (found in refrigerated deli dinner section of store) and Steamers corn, which made it an easy meal. Not too salty for us, and we usually omit or reduce salt on everything we cook. Thanks for this great recipe!

My family loved it. I didn't have any Italian breadcrumbs so I used regular and added 1 1/2 tsps of Italian seasoning. I used 2 bullion cubes instead of the au jus. I also used cream of chicken and herbs soup. I will definately make it again.

My kids and husband loved this recipe. It is a little too salty. My husband requested it again tonight so I am going to try to cut the onion soup down. Other than that it gets two thumbs up from me, if my picky kids will eat it it's gotta be good.

This was a hit in our house! I cut the recipe in half and since other reviews noted the salt content, I used lower sodium options. I did use cream of mushroom instead also used a bunch of fresh mushrooms. The steaks were a teeny bit dry, but the gravy helped. I might try a little less bread crumbs next time. I served with homemade mashed potatoes and fresh corn I cut off the cob. Delicious and my kid asked for seconds!

I've made this numerous times because my husband just loves it and it's so easy for the delicious results you get.   I usually halve the recipe because it's just two of us but I always make the full recipe of gravy using cream of mushroom soup.  Tonight I only had one can of cream of mushroom soup so I used a can of French Onion soup with it and that was very, very good too.  In fact, I may start using one can of each from now on, it was that good.  You won't be sorry either way.  It's so good!  Update: You really should be out of the house while this is cooking because, just 1 hr. into the cooking time, the aroma makes you so hungry!

Not a big fan of this one. I used low sodium soup which actually made it kind of bland. I much prefer the Kelly Berenger Salisbury Steak recipe.

this was delicious as is! my son and husband ate it up! I only made a couple modifications so I could make it in my Instant Pot. first, I seared the patties right in the instant pot then stacked in a circle (2 layers of 4 patties). I added an extra 3/4 cup of broth to the gravy (I used water for the original portion) and also added some worshtershire sauce to make sure the gravy wasn't watered down. poured this on top of the patties and then pressure cooker for 15 minutes with a 10 minutes natural release. turned out AMAZING and the gravy was still thick and flavorful. my hubs said I can make it weekly if I'd like!

I thought that the sauce in this recipe was so delicious. I am always looking for ways to dress up hamburger meat. Very easy to prepare and I love crockpot cooking.

I made this for dinner and I made a few changes after looking at the reviews. I added onions that were pulped in the blender. I didn't use onion soup mix. instead of chicken soup I added brown gravy mix. Very easy to make.

Like others have suggested I used cream of mushroom soup. I also used half of the onion mix and even with that it was a bit too much salt. It was pretty good and I'll be making it again.

I use cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken soup, and use low-sodium beef broth instead of water when ever I make this recipe. I have had MANY requests for the recipe from friends and family. Delicious and Easy!

Definitely easy and delicious! I added mushrooms and onions to the crockpot as well and that made it even better. Mashed potatoes are of course tasty on the side too. I will be making this again that's for sure!

Simply the easiest, convenient and fuss-free recipe I've tried, that consistently comes out delicious.  My family adores this and has asked me to make it over and over.  I do not change anything about the recipe because it doesn't need any "punching-up."  It's just plain great!

Best comfort food! It’s turned out a bit salty for my family so I add double the amount of water. I also use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.

The meat itself needed more spices to keep it from tasting like a hamburger patty. I think I'll try adding some Worcestershire sauce to the next batch. I did use low sodium cream of chicken soup and didn't have the problem with saltiness that many reviewers complained about.

I made this dish several times and realized that I never wrote a review. We had this for dinner tonight and it was wonderful as usual!
I didn't have any Au Jus mix on hand; so I found a recipe to put one together and it worked!
Great recipe! Thank You!!

Unbelievable! My entire family loved it and couldn't stop raving how good it was while they were eating it, haha. The only addition I made was to throw a chopped up yellow onion in with the gravy/topping. It came out perfectly and even the leftovers were AMAZING!! My family said they want it once per week, haha.

My family really liked this. I made it in the oven as I was pressed for time and used cream of mushroom soup as that was what I had. We all went back for seconds and the sauce was delicious.

I used 1 can of golden mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken and mushroom and added 1 large can of mushrooms and used the juice and added water to make 3/4 cup liquid. I also added 1 tsp. sugar to counteract the saltiness and some dried parsley for color. I'm a recipe tweaker!

I made this with one modification; used pre-made frozen meatballs and it was served over rice. The house smelled like stroganoff was perfectly seasoned (not too salty either)...will make again!

It was on the salty side. I would just saute some onions next time I make this then add to the ground beef rather than using the "onion soup mix". I like salt but this was even salty to me. I'm sure that the soup mix was the culprit.

This was a yummy, simple dish. I didn’t use the dry onion soup mix, but substituted onion powder, salt, and pepper. Then for the sauce I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and added a splash of Worcestershire sauce. Great with mashed potatoes and collard greens.

My husband devoured it, and he "doesn't like" Salisbury steak. No leftovers, will definitely make again

This recipe is awesome as shown, but I made a few additions that just made it  even more FANTABULOUS!  

I added 1 whole egg to the ground beef mixture, it helps to hold the patties together better. 

I made my own mashed potatoes (skins on, sour cream added during whipping) and caramelized onions w/sliced mushrooms. 

I served the salisbury steak on top of a couple scoops of mashed potatoes, then topped it with the caramelized onions and mushrooms. 

I plan to add either some chives, green onions, or garlic to the mashed potatoes next time!

Only changes I made were to use beef broth rather than the bouillon and I used cream of mushroom soup rather than chicken. It was great, the entire family loved it and leftovers made great sandwiches.

Very tasty recipe. I used golden mushroom soup and beef and onion gravy and a small can of mushrooms that I had on hand. The patties I added a little Worchestershire sauce and steak seasoning to add some flavor to the meat. Never made salisbury steak before because it's not one of my hubby's favorites, but even he liked it.

This was good. Substituted reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup and used less au jus mix and it was still too salty. Added 2 cups water which helped. :)

I thought it was a tad too salty. I used 1 cream chicken and 1 cream mushroom because I only had one of each.

Very good.  Super crazy easy.  Used mushroom-based soup instead of chicken because that seemed to make more sense to me.  And it didn't need the full 4 1/2 hours in the crockpot, even on low.

I put quartered red potatoes in the bottom of the cooker before adding the meat. Used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of mushroom because that's what I had on hand. Didn't use au juice mix. My family loved it! I might try adding peeled, whole carrots cut up next time.

Oh my gosh, these are so awesome!  The only way I deferred from the recipe was I used a jar of beef gravy mixed with the cream of chicken soup instead of the au jus mix. Served over mashed potatoes. Loved it!

really easy to make, my only issue with it was that it had too much of an onion flavor which overpowered the steak.

I was worried making this only because it is one of my bf's favorites and I didn't want to hear about me always "trying something new when the original is fine the way it is." and I admit that I was hesitant when I read what the sauce was made from but I have to say it turned out great ! He enjoyed it so much that I shared this recipe with the relatives right after dinner. I'm only giving 4 stars because it is a bit salty for me but I'm not much of a salt 'eater'. I definitely recommend this and it will become one of my "go to recipes" !

This was so easy and delicious! I used low sodium chicken soup and I think it was the perfect amount of saltiness. I used ground sirloin. I topped it with Fried Onions (the type you use for green bean casserole). They added a nice onion flavor and texture.

When it comes to rating any recipe that I make from here, I make it exactly as directed.  I make no alterations hence my rating is purely about the recipe provided.   The aroma of the Salisbury steak cooking in my crockpot was truly a yummy tummy growling experience.   The flavor was very good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the salt content was too high.  I had left overs which I covered with the sauce and that made the steaks absorb even more of the salty flavor.  So based purely on the recipe as is, I would highly recommend it but I would suggest using low sodium cream of chicken soup.

Great recipe!! I made a few changes...instead of water I used Beef Broth- and almost 3/4 of a can. I mixed it into the cream of mushroom soup mixture. The reason I added more than the recipe was to produce more gravy. The other change is I made was I used Beefy Onion soup mix instead of just onion, I've found doing that with other beef dishes, it really enhances the taste. I added salt, which it could have done without as it was salty enough on its own, it tasted perfect like that to me & my husband, but the kids said 'too salty'. Served it with mashed potatoes & corn & it was a huge hit!!

We LOVE this dish.  The neighborhood kids beg for this when they stay the night.  We add carrots and potatos to the bottom of the crockpot unless we double the recipe then we toss the steaks over wide noodles.  Great dish for a busy week with a salad.

Loooove this recipe, i have made some simple alterations for convience and to cut down on sodium-
1. I cut out the onion soup mix & breadcrumbs and simply season the flour before dredging patties (I usually use an italian blend)
2. I use frozen burger patties,  dredge and then brown. 
3. The family also loves it when I throw in sliced mushrooms

SO GOOD! After putting the browned meat in the crockpot, I sautéed onions in the same pan & added garlic at the end. All went into crockpot after deglazing pan. Added Worchestershire sauce to the soup mixture. Husband is still talking about how much he liked it!

We only had 1 can of cream of chicken soup in the house. We used it and 1 can cream of mushroom. Cooked it on low for 4 hours in a casserole crock pot. That is the cake pan shaped one. I accidentally made 2 patties a little thicker. This is absolutely delicious. There is so much flavor and the gravy was outstanding too.

This recipe put the "C" in Comfort food!  My family loves this recipe.  The only change I made was making the recipe on the stove top.  I browned the meat according to the recipe and poured the soup/au jus mixture on top of the patties, covered the skillet, and simmered for 25 minutes (so good) and, as another reviewer commented, only 1 pan to clean up.

This is very good, but way too salty for our tastes. I'll use some lower sodium ingredients next time. And I made it in an electric skillet too. Turned out great!

Subbed the chicken soup for condensed mushroom: 10/10. Makes enough to feed the family.

Added 4 tins of Cream of mushroom soup, as we can't get those bigger cans. Not cream of Chicken.   Used Lawyer's  Seasoning salt, not too much fresh ground pepper and used not too much salt.  Did use the kind you grind up.
Made more hamburgers, everything gone between hubby and Grandson and myself, by next day.  Only 2 burgers left.   Tonight I made a lot more hamburgers. Family loves this recipe.
We'll see how many burgers are left tomorrow after supper.

Used my Crockpot.  5 hrs.

This was amazing! My husband loved it. This was my first time making it from scratch. Usually I buy the frozen dinner ones. The only thing I did differently was to use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. I am not a big fan of cream of chicken soup. It turned out great. Thank you so much for the recipe using "real" meat. Will make again!

Great recipe, thank you for sharing!  I wanted to use what I had available so I adjusted some of the ingredients.  I ended up making my own dry onion soup mix, didn’t have dry au jus mix so I used low sodium beef broth.  No cream of chicken soup, instead I used cream of mushroom soup.  I also caramelized 1 large yellow onion and added it to gravy.  The consistency of the gravy was good so I didn’t need to use the 1/4 cup of flour.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Delicious!  My husband commented on how good it was  at least 3 times during dinner .  I had time to cook in my skillet instead of the crockpot and it worked great.  Added a can of mushrooms and half of an onion, sliced, and it was delicious!

This was awesome. I made some minor adjustments but this is fabulous.

I had fresh au jus on hand from a previous meal, and replaced the cream of chicken with cream of mushroom soup.

Otherwise did everything as instructed. It was perfect over mashed potatoes.

Perfectly awful!  Did not add salt. The salt taste was overwhelming. Could not eat it. Otherwise its hamburger with gravy poured over it. Won't make this again.

I have made this twice. The first time I made it exactly as the original recipe, but found it too salty for my tastes. After looking at the other reviews, I made it a second time but used reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken soup. These 2 minor changes changed a very good base recipe into a stellar recipe, at least as far as my household is concerned. 4 stars for the original recipe.....and 5 stars for the slightly modifed recipe!

Big miss with my family, even my toddler did not enjoy it. I personally found it very lacking in seasoning and my husband just did not like the taste at all. My daughter ate one bite and then the rest she removed from her plate, even the mashed potatoes that had some of the gravy on them were removed from her plate (she's can't really communicate her dislike in food yet, so we know when something is shoved to the corner of her high chair tray she doesn't like it). This recipe is incredibly easy to make and I do plan on trying my hand at something similar in the future, just with very different seasonings and gravy choices.

This turned out great. The only change I made was to add mushrooms. My husband asked me keep the recipe after being a skeptic when I told him what I was making for dinner. Even my 2 yr old son ate the meat, which he normally doesn't do.

Really simple and delicious. I added a tiny bit of Worcester sauce into the "gravy". Oh, and I also used the cream of mushroom soup instead as another Review  suggested.

I  love this recipe.  I have to down size now since my kids don't live with us anymore, so I make the recipe for 8 and I freeze 4 of the burgers after I fry them and attach a copy of the recipe. When I'm having a busy day, I just take out the frozen patties and add all the ingredients to my slow cooker and I have a wonderful meal hours later.  It's also wonderful when we have company for the full recipe.

Used home made onion soup mix  and had to finish off for 20 minutes in oven at 325 to have meat cook thoroughly. This was after 5.5 hours in crock pot.  Tasted great everyone loved it. I will cook a little longer during browning step to get more of fat from the meat.  But great recipe we will be making often

Very tasty.  'Gravy' was very thin and watery though.  Removed meat and thicken with a slurry.  Perfect.  Will make again, but omit water next time.

Excellent dish!  Made as stated, just be sure to use very lean meat else gravy gets too greasy. So easy to prepare, will serve this often.

Easy and totally delicious!  The only change I made was to substitute brown gravy mix for the au jus, as that's what I had on hand.  It made it a little peppery but still delicious!

This turned out so much better than I expected.  Really tasty.  Two mistakes I made that will be of use to you I hope - 1) Use at least 85% ground beef.  I used 80% and got way to much grease in the sauce. 2) Make the patties fairly flat.  Mine swelled up to look like round balls in the cooking process.

I doubled this recipe, but stuck with one pack on onion soup mix to cut down on the salt. It turned out great, my family and I loved it. Yum!

I thought the chicken soup was an odd choice, so I swapped it for mushroom soup. I could also see how it would be way too salty with given ingredients depending on your tastes - so for those who haven't made this yet, remember you can always add but not take away. I ended up with twice as much gravy as I really needed, but I think that might just be my husband and my preference. Otherwise, it was great! This is now my go-to salisbury steak recipe. 
Enjoyed last night with brown rice, steamed broccoli, and I had some portobello mushrooms in the fridge, so I threw them in at the end just to get coated with the gravy.

Holy saltiness batman.  I like the basic concept of the recipe, easy way to get a hearty beefy dinner.  However, way too salty.  If I can find low sodium versions of coc soup, dry onion soup mix, & au jus, I'll try again.

Used cream of mushroom soup, did not brown patties - just put them straight in the slow cooker. Cut recipe in half to fit cooker and meet our needs. Will cook again.

I was a bit dubious about this recipe as I had never cooked hamburger in a crockpot before.  This was a  great dish to start with.  It was a whole family hit!  Even my picky 7-year -old loved it.  This dish is a bit salty so you may want to use low-sodium soup.

I made a homemade au jus mix as opposed to a store-bought mix just to keep the chemicles to a minimum  but that is the only change that I made.

I made this for my family last night and they loved it! I love how simple the gravy is and how you just toss it in the crock pot and forget about it. I made the recipe just as it says, but I am a big mushroom and onion lover and added those in between the patties in the crock pot to cook with it all. Turned out wonderful on top of a mound of mashed potatoes!  Absolutely a keeper! Thanks for sharing! :)

This is a great recipe. Make it as directed by the recipe! If you make it with condensed mushroom soup, it is not the same recipe. I have made this several times and it comes out very good. I have tweaked it to my liking only after following the original recipe. I now use chicken broth instead of the water and I add fresh sliced mushrooms and green peppers near the end.

I had been craving this for some time but my husband is allergic to mushrooms so I couldn't make the "original". This one is so good and so easy! There really isn't anything that I can think of that I'd change about it. it is salty but not to much, with mashed potatoes it's perfect!

My family loved this recipe.  As some others suggested, I didn't use water.  Instead, I used all beef stock, which made the gravy richer.  Also, it didn't take as long to cook as the recipe indicates, but slowly simmering does improve the flavor of the meat.  I will definitely cook this again.

I have made this four times now; always a hit. I did not dredge in floor and I made the patties with half beef, half hot sausage.  I browned on both sides, and doubled the cream of mushroom soup, added more onion, and dry onion soup mix to the gravy.  EASY and terrific.  I even served it for company who raves over it. Thank you for this recipe!

This turned out with great flavor...... I wish the gravy had a deeper color to it even though I missed the dredging the patties in flour. I used cream of chicken with mushroom soup and beefy onion soup mix. At the end I added canned mushrooms for the extra touch.

This was delicious!!!  Everyone in my family devoured it.  I was a little skeptical about cream of chicken soup combined with beef gravy so I cut back to one can of cream of chicken and added a little more water as it was simmering & looked to be getting too thick.  And the end result were delicious. I will definitely make this again

The only Salisbury Steak I can get my 18year old to eat and asks for more.  It was a big hit with everyone at our dinner table except for the picky 3year old.

Great recipe! I did substitute cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. I also added sliced baby Bella mushrooms & thinly sliced onions and served with buttered No Yolk noodles & steamed broccoli. My 4 year old loved it!

This  turned out great. I didn't put in the full amount of Aujus the first time, and thought it worked well. Will  definately make again. I made a double batch of the steaks for the freezer, so now I just have to make the "gravy" when I want to make this.

It tasted good, but it just didn't taste like classic salisbury steak.
I did have to change a couple of things.
Had to use crushed up crackers b/c I didn't have breadcrumbs. I added in some Italian seasoning with it.
I also used beef stock instead of water to give it more flavor.
It was a little salty according to my husband, but I thought it was fine. Pair it with some underseasoned mashed potatoes or white rice and it should help reduce the saltiness if it bothers you.
I also cooked this for around 7 hours, just because I had a free moment to get all of it done and in to the pot.
I'll make this again, but will change it a little more to try out different flavors. Like using cream of mushroom, maybe adding in an onion and peppers too.

Loved this dish, and my 12 year old had 3 helpings!  He has asked for it every night since.  I didn't deviate from the recipe at all and felt that it was perfect as is.  Salisbury steak is something I grew up eating and loving so much...this is a callback to the recipe my mom always made. Yum!

Minimum amount of ingredients with easy instructions. The steaks have a very good taste, but may be a little salty for some; in which case I would suggest a "low sodium" soup. I have also tried using cream of mushroom which works as well. Overall my family enjoys the meal and has made frequent requests for it. Just one thing to note, there will be a lot of grease that you may want to spoon or siphon out prior to serving.

A winner!  My boy never finishes his plate but he went back for seconds.  We have a few food in intolerances so I had to substitute a few things but well worth it.  Prepared the meatballs the night before.  Flavors had mingled well.  The house smelled great when we got home!

Generally I don't say anything if I have nothing nice to say, but I wanted to warn everyone, no offense to the creator, but this recipe is extremely slimy and VERY salty. If you do not mind thick slimy gravy with lots of salt, ignore my comment.

Sorry author!

I didn't change a thing. My only tip is to be sure to check the sodium content on the 
Au jus mix. There are some with a lot of sodium and then the dish is too salty.

I followed a few other reviewers and made a few changes: I used reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup (since a few people said this was really salty), I used half of a package of au jus  seasoning (same reason), and included a can of sliced mushrooms.  Turned out yummy! Served over mashed potatoes.

This is my second time making this dish. The first time I used cream of mushroom soup and it was outstanding! The second time I used the cream of chicken which added a different flavor obviously. It was still a great dish.  I will continue to use the cream of mushroom instead of the cream of chicken. Awesome and easy. 4 stars....

I am trying to teach my teenagers how to cook, I feel like the slow cooker is a good way to go, we did change the recipe to match what we had on hand and I don't use onion soup mix  anymore due to my husband's blood pressure.   This is a really good recipe, I like how it is pretty forgiving and everyone loved it, (even the picky ones, lol) I thought it was kind of like mini meat loaves.  Thanks a lot.

I substituted the cream of chicken with cream of mushroom, used a beefy onion packet, added the leftover to the gravy, added Worcestershire sauce, pepper, and Country Bob's steak sauce to the patties. Although it was a little salty they came out AMAZING!  I will look for low sodium ingredients next time.

This was GREAT!! My only problem with it is that my wife was late getting home that evening and I almost "sampled" the gravy to where there was hardly any left! Next time I'll double the gravy recipe. Served the Salisbury steak over grits and topped it off with gravy. Excellent. A definite keeper.

decided to try this recipe and was very pleased! simple and quick to prep and the slow cooker does all the rest! the Au Jus mix I got was a store brand and was a bit heavy on the salty side, but other than that,  the meat patties were very flavorful, tender and juicy! served with mashed potatoes and fresh mixed vegetables!

LOVE this recipe. It's simple and easy. I actually mixed the a jus soup powder with the meat instead of putting it around with the cream of chicken soup, and it turned our very flavorful. I also used venison instead of beef. Definitely turned out great and will be a family favorite!!

Love this recipe, I took some advice from other comments and used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and added chopped onions and white mushrooms about an hour before it was ready and it came out great!

I read just about all of the reviews. I used one can of cream of mushroom because it was all I had. After pouring the cream of mushroom out I filled the can with water and added that to the gravy mix. I used 1 au jus packet and about half a cup of beef broth. I read that it was salty so I added an addition 1/4 cup water. I also added a tablespoon of  worcestershire as well.  I didn't use a crockpot because I didn't have time. I cook it on the stove for an hour on low heat. My family loved it. I love reading all of the reveiws to see the tips others give and how they made it their own. I serve it with sticky rice and crescent rolls.

I added some of my own seasonings to the hamburger. I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken and I also used brown gravy mix instead of what they asked for. Also with hamburger instead of just onion soup mix mine had crushed up mushrooms in it. My family loved it!! There is even ladies at my husbands work is asking for the recipe . It was quick and easy. Mine was done in 4 hrs.

I made this and it was delicious.
The only thing I did different was add both dry gravy mix and Au jus. I also added some dry ground mustard to the ground beef mixture.

Simple and delicious!  I made two changes.  First, I use cream of mushroom rather than cream of chicken and I make it in the skillet instead of the crock pot.  Once I have browned the steaks, I pour in the gravy and simmer covered for 20-30 minutes.  This is a great week night meal.

This is a delicious recipe! From reading previous reviews I switched out the cream of chicken soup for cream of mushroom soup and added fresh sliced mushrooms. Also skipped adding the Au Jus mix and added a few more spices to the meat. Cooked it as written besides cooked it on high for two hours. Turned out amazing! I will be making this so much now!

Eight "steaks" from heaven. So delicious. Afterwards, I repurposed the leftovers into some nice twice-baked potatoes in place of the bacon. Oiiii, I should post that recipe.

I changed a few things
1. I used crime of Mushroom instead of crime of Chick soup. 

2. I used 3/4 cup white wine instead of water. 

It all came out great!

My New Years resolution was to make some of the recipes I have saved and this was the first one. So happy I tried this one first.  My family loved it.  So easy to prepare.  Took about 10 minutes to prepare and brown the patties before I threw it all together and forgot about it for the next 5 hours.  For something so easy, it tasted like a dish served out of a five star  restaurant.  Definitely will be adding this to my regular rotation.

I would absolutely make again!! I added 16oz of sliced mushrooms when I sautéed the onions... because short ribs are always better with mushrooms.

This was super simple and incredibly tasty! I was a little worried about the hamburger grease on top of the sauce but I just skimmed it as best I could.

I started making this recipe and just before I put the patties in the flour, I realized no one was going to be home. I put the hamburger mixture in a sealed container in the refrigerator overnight and made it to the next day. The only thing I changed was I did not add salt because I seen other reviews said it was too salty. I don't know if letting the hamburger marinate overnight made a difference or not but this recipe was fantastic! My family loved it! This will be one of our regular dishes from now on.

Did not dredge or pre-fry these. I only had one can of cream of chicken soup, so subbed in some evaporated milk with some fresh mushrooms. Kids ate all of it. Served with roasted new potatoes and roasted broccoli. I found it to be bit too salty and think it would be fine with plain burgers made with just fresh onion. Will make this again that way.

It turned out very tender and tasty. However, I agree with other comments that it was too salty. I definitely will use low sodium ingredients next time!

Excellent dish and easy to make.  I revised this a bit, using 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup instead of the chicken soup.  The flavor is everything you want in a good home cooked comfort meal.  And yes, mashed potatoes are a MUST with this!

This was a really nice change! I could have browned the burger a little more, but the recipe is really simple and great with some mashed potatoes and veggies! Tastes best with quality burger!

This was SOOO good and easy to make. But do not add any additional salt in my opinion, the Liptons soup has enough.  Also, I made Au ju instead of  the packet. Also, I followed other recommendations and put in fresh mushrooms and I diced up 1/2 and onion.

This was very good. I followed the recipe but followed the advise of being too salty so used 1 can salt free cream of chicken and 1 regular. It was almost too salty for me but I don't use a lot of salt. I put sliced mushrooms on the bottom and in between the layers. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and heated a can of cream corn with can of kernel corn. I only had one Salisbury and my hubby and son devoured the rest. Will make again.

This recipe is AMAZING!  The only exception I made was to use 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom soup (I buy organic gluten-free soups--I find them less salty).  I also used the beefy onion soup mix.  I also used ground sirloin.  When my kids asked what was for dinner, I said Salisbury Steak, and they gave the sad face thinking it was the frozen stuff.  After tasting it, I got high fives from them.  The sauce really makes it amazing.  Make this recipe -- you won't be disappointed!

Not sure the 5 star works because I used cream of Mushroom soup.  But the result was so GOOD.  I also added  half onion and 1/2 cup of mushrooms that had to be used.  The 'burgers' were very good - had to use a cracked egg that I broke getting the mushrooms and onion out of frig so cut back to 1T milk and the cracked egg.  Next time I make this I will make the meat patties 'flatter' not so thick.  For me the gravy was too thick so I added more liquid (beef broth/water) - Served with mashed potatoes.  Very happy with the overall recipe - will use it again.  Really liked the flavors better with the left-overs. The last thing - didn't use the slow cooker used my small electric fry pan on lowest setting for 45 min.

First time making this recipe. Overall it was easy to make and a delicious addition to my week night meals.  After reading the reviews regarding the recipe coming out to salty I decided to add about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar to help cut through some of the saltiness. This definitely helped and did not make it sweet. My husband loved it and did not think it was to salty. My mom, who eats very little salt still thought it was a little to salty.  When I make this again, I will use low sodium products to help offset the saltiness. Cook time in my crockpot was dead on and the meat was fork tender. Served it with mashed taters. So good.

This is an excellent slow cooker recipe!  I would definitely make it again.....I did add a can of mushrooms and some extra onions and would do that again.  I think I would decrease the amount of onion soup mix to cut back the salt.

I used half a packet of brown gravy mix instead of the au jus and I used crushed Italian croutons instead of bread crumbs. Turned out great. I should have cooked it the full 5 hours because at just over 4 hours they were still a tiny bit pink. Next time I will add flour to the sauce mix to thicken it and make it into gravy.

Made this for the first time today. The meat was nice and tender but the entire dish overall was a little bland. Now, to be fair, I did not have seasoned bread crumbs, only plain so I should have added more seasoning to the meat to compensate. Otherwise, the only change was that I added 8oz of fresh mushrooms to the slowcooker. Using seasoned bread crumbs next time might help the meat a little, but I'm going to read some more reviews and try to figure out how best to help the sauce/gravy to be more flavorful.

So good! I used 4 small cans of Golden Mushroom Soup, instead of cream of chicken. And I put mine in the oven and 375 for 30-40 minutes after cooking on the stove top, like in the directions. I decided not to use this in the slow cooker. Served with mashed potatoes and corn/french green beans (I had some left in each bag so I mixed them). The kids loved it. Even my 13 year old daughter who is not a fan of Salisbury Steak.

My husband absolutely loves when I cook this! The only change I made was using low sodium cream of chicken soup. I've made it both ways, and I think the low sodium soup suits me better, but it was awesome either way!

I've made this recipe numerous times, and each time, it's been an absolute hit. I did, however, change it up a bit by substituting one can of cream of chicken soup with a can of golden mushroom soup just to give it a little change of taste. The left overs are always great the next day either over mashed potatoes or sour dough bread.

I made it exactly as the recipe and it was so so so salty! The meat was OK but I threw out the sauce.

I made some changes to this recipe but was thrilled with the result. I made it in an electric skillet as someone in a previous review did. I also used cream of mushroom soup and beef stock as my liquid and added a handful of fresh sliced mushrooms. It was wonderful and I would definitely make again. It was a hit with my family of 6.

Rather than the packet of au jus powder, I added a can of french onion soup.  It turned out amazing!!

This was delicious! So easy and great flavor. I sliced some mushrooms and added them with the gravy. I also only had onion gravy mix (not soup) and it turned out so well! I will probably sub broth instead of water next time, but wow was this good! Served over mashed potatoes and with green beans and corn.

This recipe is great! A copycat to one I found where the only difference is cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  It is salty, and for that reason I halve the au jus amount.  I am surprised people think it's the meat patties that are salty, I thought the gravy was.  Using less au jus made it less salty but still savory.

My whole family loves this recipe. I saute mushrooms garlic and onion in the slow cooker before I put the patties in. Instead of the cream of chicken I used cream of mushroom otherwise it's too salty. To fix the salty cream of chicken I add extra milk and water.

The only thing I changed was what the others suggested and was I cut the onion soup mix in half. Otherwise it was very easy and very delicious! Will definitely be making again!

I added 8oz of fresh mushrooms and 6oz can of Grogrio's Mushroom and Steak Sauce just to have a richer gravy.  The steak was done at 3 1/2 hrs in my crock-pot.

Great and easy recipe, my husband said it was better than his mothers! I also cook it on the electric stove as apposed to the slow cooker. It was much simpler and came out great. The dish is a bit salty. I will definitely go low sodium next time. Highly recommended.

I gave this recipe 5 stars even though I made changes based on personal likes and dislikes.   For the meat mixture I followed this recipe, as written with the exception of dredging the meat through flour.   I am working on cutting grains and didn't feel it was a necessary step.  I also replaced the onion soup mix for Beef flavor onion soup mix.  After the meat was done I sauteed an onion and a package of fresh baby portabellas (sliced).   For the gravy mix I used 1 jar of beef gravy and a packet of au jus gravy mix with 3/4 Cup water.   

This recipe was super easy and simply delicious.   I am sure it is equally delish as written, however I am not a fan of cream soups.  If you are looking for an easy meal that is full of flavor give this one a try, you won't be disappointed.

Loved this dish, but agree with other reviews that it can be very salty.  I typically try to find low sodium soup to help with that.  I have switched between mushroom and chicken soup and both come out great.

This was a huge success! I only give it four stars instead of five because the patty was a tad bit dry and it was a little too salty. I will look for a way to reduce the salt next time. But I will definitely be making this again! My husband liked it so much that I have a feeling it is one of our new dinner staples.

This is he second time I made this. The first time I made exactly according to the directions and it was very good. The second time, I used the dry beef and onion soup mix. It turned out tastier than before. I just thought it might add a little more beef flavor. So simple to make and VERY TASTY.

my husband LOVED this and it was super easy to make. I only used a little over a lb of meat because it was just the two of us (and there will still be a couple of meals) and couldn't really figure out how to half the recipe (what else would I use the packets for?) so it was a bit salty for me but that was my doing by messing with the measurements of things :) 

we paired it with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus.

I loved the gravy it makes especially.  My husband loves salty food, so that part worked out well for us.  The meat turned out a little tough and dense. I read in another review I might have over mixed it.  Does anyone know if adding an egg would keep it a little less dense/tough?

My family loved this! I also used cream of mushroom, but am going to try cream of chicken next time as this will definitely be in our "go to" rotation!

After reading other reviews, I substituted beef broth for the water.  Otherwise, I made the recipe as is.  The patties were delicious, but the gravy was far too rich and 2 of the 3 of us had a hard time getting it down.  Next time I'll stick with water and I may only use half of the Au Jus packet.

Taste was excellent but my patties turned to mush so we had salisbury mush with mashed potatoes. Would love to make this again with not mush patties. Any advice would be great.

I was fine EXCEPT for the onion soup saltiness !  How I wish I had taken or had time to read the reviews...I made it according to recipe.  SO..I added potatoes and am hoping it will turn out better.  I am not used to cooking with all these pre-made items...and it is a real learning curve for me.  No more soup packets for me - or at least I will cut the amount in half like others did before me.

We really liked this as is the first time I made it.  Yesterday I made the sauce and put it in the slow cooker with frozen cooked meatballs instead of the patties.  I put it all in about 2:30 on high for an hour, then switched it to low for a couple of hours.  It was delicious with the meatballs and so easy.  It is a bit salty, but it's better when served over noodles or rice.

I did check out a bunch of the reviews before I started.  unfortunately I did not have 4 to 5 hours to cook this so I did what another reviewer suggested and made it on the skillet.  It was too salty and it took me some finagling with the sauce by adding some half and half and water in order to calm the saltiness down.  Thanks anyway for the recipe because I always like to at least try something different!

This was a easy simple recipe  to make,I made a few changes (due to all the Salty taste reviews) to it. I used real chopped onions,beef gravy,worth shire sauce,brown gravy and creme of mushroom soup  low sodium. It turned out great especially the gravy. Served it with garlic mash potatoes and snap beans,delicious!

The family was Crazy about this recipe. Lots of flavor and goes together very easily. I finished it up in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes. My husband swears it was even better heated up the next night for a left over meal.

I used 1/2 pkg of the onion soup mix.  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom instead of chicken.  Added 1/2 jar of gravy mix instead of aux jus and a couple of glugs of worcestershire sauce  and 1/2 cup of red wine.  We are big fans of mushroom and a lot of fresh sliced baby bella mushrooms.  I browned the hamburger and mushrooms in a pan and then added the sauce.  Braised them in the sauce for about an hour.  I served this over egg noodles; reminded me of the salsbury steak from my childhood. Great recipe.  My husband and I loved it and the leftovers two days later were even better.

Great recipe. Actually made with about 2.7 lbs of ground sirloin (90/10). Enough for 11 patties. There was plenty of sauce. As other suggested, used a low sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken. Other than that, followed recipe. Will make again!!

I made this tonight for my boyfriend and myself and we enjoyed it, but it was a little too salty. I took the advice of others and used lower sodium cream of chicken soup, but I'm not sure it helped with the saltiness. I would definitely make this again because it was easy to throw together and it was tasty. I think next time I might omit the au jus mix or the dry onion soup and see if that helps with the saltiness. Thanks for the recipe!

One more for the weekly dinner rotation!  The individual “steaks” came out very moist and tender unlike other recipes.  The sauce was just perfect.  I personally would not change a thing.  I could see some people that are on low sodium diet finding that this is a little salty.  But then again, it is what it is.  The preparation was spot on, and the taste….. yummmmm.  When my kids and I came into the house, with little more than an hour for the meal to cook, the reaction from my two boys was instantaneous: “Wow Dad!  You disk smells so good!”  Now you can’t put a price on that one.

This was very good.  I do believe the salt content was way too high but I think we know what the Culprit is here.  Onion soup has 590 grams of sodium and au jus has 360.  I did not add any extra salt and did use over a cup of water to bring the salt down.  I think next time I will only use 1/2 the packet on each and that should help.  It was very good and I will make it again.

I made this tonight, the only change being that I added a bit of fresh ground pepper to the gravy mix to even out the salty flavor from the soup. It was a hit, even my 9 month old loved it!

This was very good and flavorful.   I halfed the onion soup mix and added mushrooms and measured out the liquid from the mushrooms  and topped off with water  instead of just water.  Made a nice gravy.  I will definately make this again.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I swapped out half of the beef hamburger for bison hamburger, it always makes a beef meal even better.

This recipe was really good. But i did read other reviews and I did change it slightly, and I'm happy I did. I used Lipton beefy onion soup packet, and cream of mushroom instead of the chicken. I also added 1 cup of water instead of 3/4 cup to the gravy since people complained about it being too salty. It turned out perfect!

I will give this recipe a 3. It  has potential on being great, but I found it incredibly salty. I did use cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of  chicken. It is a great idea, but needs a bit of tweaking. It's either the Onion Soup Mix or the Au Jus that has to go to bring down the salt content ... But I am just not to sure of which one yet!

I stuck to the recipe, used lean beef, and I think I made the patties too thick. Would be really curious to do this as meatballs over egg noodles. Kids were just meh but DH and Gma liked it.

I served it over boiled, sliced, red potatoes. Also, you can cook it on high for two hours instead of on low for so long. We loved it!

I have to agree with others about it being too salty. The flavor though was amazing! I think I'll use low sodium soup next time like others had suggested. I can't complain too much. My picky teenager liked it :-)  I used beef broth in place of the water which may have contributed to the saltiness. Maybe also cook them a bit more. They were cooked through, just some were pink in the middle. Will be making these again for sure.

Quite good, I used fresh baby bella mushrooms and sliced up a large onion to cook with the patties. Also for my gravy I used a jar of beef gravy, beef stock and 2 small cans of cream of mushroom soup. Great over rice, thanks for the recipe and helpful reviews.

We use this recipe all the time. Do not skip on the bread crumbs or the steaks will be way too hard. We like to add in onions and garlic to the steaks as well. Only downside is I always find the end result somewhat greasy and salty so beware if you're sensitive to salty foods. It's very forgiving to don't be afraid to tinker with the meat. That's what she said.

This a melt in your mouth salisbury steak! Oooh so good, my husband loves it! Its so creamy! 

I made half of the recipe, I followed it exactly as is. I used Lipton onion soup/dip mix and I added 1 potato cut in cubes, and then pour the sauce mixture over the patties and the potato cubes. Slow cooker on low for 4 hours. And it came out amazing! So creamy and flavorful, and its not salty at all! It was just right for me and my husband!

Delicious, yes, healthy choice for dinner, not so sure. My family loves the flavour of this dish, but struggle with the overall healthiness of the dish. I know it is not touted as being a healthy choice, but I do look for ways to cut down on the sale particularly. I do not like to have to brown first, they slow cooker, but it does turn out delicious over mashed potatoes and makes a great winter, or rainy day dish. Definitely needs some fresh veggies or a salad to lighten a bit.

Made this for the first time and loved it. I followed a few suggestions from other reviews and used low fat cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken and also replaced beef consumate instead of dry au jus mix. I also added 2 cans of mushrooms stems and pieces. Would love to have tried in crock pot but so pressed for time, I just did everything stove top.

I made in the skillet. Browned both sides, added two large diced potatoes and an extra 1/4 cup water and let simmer for almost an hour. Goodness it was delicious. The potatoes an water helped soak up the salt.

used cream of mushroom soup , other than that as is, and cooked in  covered skillet for 30 minutes at low heat after patties brown as another did and it turned out awesome! My husbands new favorite already made this twice. Served over smashed potatoes ( caulifower) for a lighter meal.

It's a winner for the Hubby, so I'll be making it again. I found it to be OK. To combat saltiness, I used reduced sodium mushroom soup; it must have worked, because neither of us found it too salty. I was concerned about the relatively 'short' cooking time (5 hrs), especially since this was my first ground-beef-patty crock pot meal. I got around it by making the patties the day before and freezing (this also made early morning assembly much easier). I took them out, coated in flour, and browned. They went into the crock pot still frozen inside. 9 hrs later, they were perfectly done and still shaped like beef patties.

As other reviewers said, a tad salty, but it was still outstanding! I think I'll decrease the water or omit next time as sauce was too runny. I used cream of mushroom and was so tasty.

This was great! Only change that I made was to sub one of the 2 cans of cream of chicken for cream of mushroom... So one cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom. Taste exactly what Salisbury steak should taste like.. Very flavorful!. Try using a lighter meat so your gravy won't be so greasy or you can scoop out the grease at the top  before serving. I used ground sirloin and it came out perfect! Thanks so much

Great do-ahead meal.  Add mushrooms to the gravy. Make mashed potatoes ahead and keep them warm in another crockpot.  Great meal to have ready and waiting at halftime.

It turned out great. Hard to mess this up. Had no milk so used water,  used beef bullion instead of the jus, and mushroom soup. Also used 97% lean Chopped Sirloin. Thanks for the tips.

Excellent Recipe!  Have not had this dish since I was a kid - had my adult daughter and her family over for dinner and it was  a complete winner!  Based on comments from others,  I made two changes. One can of cream of chicken soup and one can of reduce sodium cream of mushroom soup.  I also added some fresh sliced mushrooms. Other than that I followed the recipe as is and it was fabulous!  A definite keeper in this family -  thanks for the great post!

Made it today. It was so good. To cut down on the salt I used 1.5 tablespoons of a salt free seasoning that had a lot of onions in it. I also used healthy request cream of mushroom soup. I also halved the recipe since it's just the two of us. It's a recipe I will keep in mind when my kids visit.

No leftovers! I used 3 pounds extra lean ground turkey, adding one egg. Also added 1/2 cup gluten free bread crumbs (made my own).  I used beefy onion soup and unsweetened almond milk in lieu of milk.
For gravy, I used 2 cans cream of mushroom soup and 1 pack au jus, adding 1 cup water
Started using almond flour but then decided to use regular flour since almond flour doesn't thicken like regular flour and the recipe wasn't going to be gluten free.
I also added sliced mushrooms about an hour before turing the crock pot off
Everyone loved it!

quick and easy, threw it together in less than 10 min over lunch.  I used a low-sodium cream of chicken soup and it was perfect.  Meat was very tender and gravy was thick and yummy.  Was a perfect pairing with mashed potatoes.

We have a family camping tradition of eating canned meatballs with potatoes and vegetables, it is better than you think but I could not get over the poor nutritional content! I made this recipe and the kids said it tastes just like our tradition.  I make a double recipe (except the sauce), brown them all in the frying pan but then freeze half of the meatballs for another day.  Later I would defrost overnight, mix up the sauce in the morning and another meal will be ready by dinner. Delicious.  My kids request this often.

This was very good.  I used a package of dry brown gravy as I did not have a package of Au Jus.  I also added a can of mushrooms.  This was even better the second day after being in the gravy all night.

Simple and delicious.  I was a little concerned at the start because the "Gravy" was yellow as mustard and stayed that way for quite some time.  But at the end, it was brown and amazingly delicious!  Great simple recipe.  Will make again.

Perhaps it was the onion soup, au ju, and soup that caused this dish to be way too salty. I did change chicken soup to mushroom.  I also did not like the texture of the meat.

This is by far a comfort food. So delicious. The only thing I dont like is that it is a bit salty. But I could probably use low sodium cream of chicken. I would definitely make this again!

I made this exactly as the recipe called. It was a hit!  I want to make this again, but  use mushroom soup and fresh mushrooms instead of chicken soup. It wasn't salty at all, as someone had stated.  The recipe doesn't call for salt,  as there is plenty in the soups.

My family is used to the frozen, in-a-box version of Salisbury steaks. After making this, the frozen kind is now abandoned. It's so flavorful! Awesome with mashed potatoes.

This is my go to recipe that I make once a week!  I tweeked it just a bit:
I use ground turkey.

And, for the gravy - my family likes LOTS of gravy I use:

2 cans cream of mushroom soup
3 envelopes of turkey gravy mixed with 3 cups water

thats my tweek!

I think the secret to this recipe is dredging the patties in flour -  doing that just makes the patties so moist!

This was really good. It cooked fast, was easy to make, and was easy to clean up. I love salisbury steak and this definitely satisfied my craving with out being really unhealthy. I made some egg noodles to go with it and there was enough gravy to cover the noodle and steak. I did not need to add any thing to it and was great as is.

Made this along with some red skinned mashed potatoes.  Very easy and tasty. My family enjoyed it very much!  I used 1 can each cream of mushroom and cream of chicken. Used some of the sauce as gravy for the potatoes.  I also cooked them on the stove a little longer since I didn't have the time  to spare. In the slow cooker. Will definitely make this again!

I have made this several time and I'm making it again tonight. My husband and I love it! I don't use a crockpot, I make it on the stove top in a frying pan.  I add a large, soft, beef boullion cube to the water instead of an au-jus packet and it works just fine.

I completely flubbed this recipe.  I mixed 1# ground beef with half a packet of onions soup mix, made in to 4 patties, seared in skillet, put in slow cooker, mixed 1 can of soup with 3/4 packet of au jus mix and some water and poured over steaks and cooked on high for about 3 hours. Husband and 5 year old really liked it!!!

This was very good and quite easy and so moist.  My kids and husband liked it too and my oldest asked for seconds.
I did use low fat cream of mushroom soup and for the au jus I used a pkg of beef Oxo.  I added garlic salt and pepper to the extra lean ground beef and more beef broth to the sauce for more beef flavour and it was still thick yummy gravy.
I will definitely make this again.

I doubled this and made 1 recipe in the skillet for dinner and the other in the freezer for a crockpot meal down the road. * used Knorr Au Jus (lots less sodium than the store brand or McCormick's) and Golden Mushroom soup, because we had it on hand.  It was delish -- and now I've cooked once and will get to eat it twice :)

This was a little on the salty side for me.  I used 1.5 lbs of beef and soup with low fat and less salt.  It turned out to be a favorite of the family.

Although I have been a browser for years this is my first review.  This is an easy fantastic meal that I cook 2 or 3 times a month.  There are only two of us but I make the entire recipe with 1 1/2 lbs of beef so we can have leftovers and a quick lunch.  Like others I do use cream of mushroom rather than cream of chicken and I also add a box of baby bellas. The extra gravy is great on toasted bread too.  If you have teenage boys or young men in your house do not expect the ratio of one serving to be enough for them.  When the grand kids are here they eat it up.

Who doesn't love quick prep and throwing supper in the crock pot??? This recipe is perfect as is! 5 stars for ease AND taste. I enjoy cooking for my family, especially my hubby and he LOVES this. The first time I made it, my picky step daughter said it was her favorite. Score! This second time making it the only thing I changed was the addition of fresh chopped mushrooms and onion slices. Served with smashed red potatoes and peas. Perfect chilly night supper! Thanks for the recipe TESSLYNN!

Just for a preference, next time I make this (and I will...hubby loved it) I'll double the gravy ingredients because it didn't leave enough to use for meat and potatoes x's 8.  Other then that option everything was perfect...meat tasted exactly like salisbury and was perfectly seasoned.
*It was such a good meal, I made this is my very first recipe review.

This was delicious, as is. And the house smelled fabulous when we walked in the door after a long day skiing. (Upstate NY). Served it with cooked egg noodles and a big loaf of crusty bread. EVEN THE FIVE YEAR OLD ATE IT.

We've had this just as the recipe goes, but we made it ourselves with half venison and half beef, and it was good both ways, but if you like venison, it really kicked it up! A+++ on this recipe, either way.

I've made this twice now and love how easy it is to make with the slow cooker. I was impressed with how tender and juicy the paddies were and the gravy was wonderful over mashed potatoes. This is a keeper. I made it just like the recipe said the first time and added mushroom with the second batch. Gravy was a little salty but with the potatoes it was fine. Everyone loved the dish. Best salisbury steak I have ever had!

I made this last night for dinner. I put it together on my lunch hour. I read a lot of the reviews before hand, some said it was too salty and some greasy. I added half of the packet of onion soup mix and also chicken broth instead of water. I put on the crock pot and it cooked for about 4-5 hours. It was very salty even with half the packet of mix, so I added water. It turned out to be very greasy. Next time I make this I'll use a leaner meat, then it should be better!

Very yummy, I only did one thing a little different and that was adding a little bit of water after it cooked awhile, when I had tasted the gravy it was salty and adding the water helped balance it out. I did add caramelized onions as well.

Great comfort food!  I served this with mashed potatoes and corn.  I also broke out the ole' TV trays and put on some black and white re-runs of The Andy Griffith Show while we chowed down.   Felt like Saturday night way back in the day when I was a girl and mom made TV dinners instead of cooking.   But these Salisbury steaks are way better than anything you'll find in the grocers freezer.

I have several slow cookers and one of them is a non stick aluminum type, so I could brown the patties and add the ingredients all in one cooker.  My family and myself loved this!  I made mashed potatoes to go with it.

It called for way to much bread crumbs. Cream of chicken does not go with meat at all, very salty. I made the leftovers with mushrooms and a savory gravy and it helped a lot. If I make this again it will made with a brown gravy and plain bread crumbs also real onions not dried onions.

This is a great recipe!  I have made it for years, but had not made it in over a year.  I have had others tell me it was too salty, so I have added another pound of meat (total 3 lbs) and kept the other ingredients the same.  I do however swap the cream of chicken soup for one can cream of celery and one can cream of mushroom.  I also love mushrooms, so I add at 2 packages of freshly slides Baby Bella mushrooms to the top of the crockpot.  Yesterday I made this and put the patties in the crockpot for about 30 min, as I was making the gravy and slicing mushrooms.  When I was ready to add gravy, I noticed a great deal of grease, even though I had drained on paper towels prior to placing them in the crockpot.  I took the patties out, drained the grease, and rebuilt the pyramid.  Smothered with gravy. And completely covered the top of crockpot with 24 oz. mushroom.  Cooked on high for 5 hours...Fabo!!  (Seeing all the grease at the bottom reminded me how the gravy seems oily in the past.  Definitely remember to cook in crockpot for 30 min alone, drain fat, then add gravy.  The gravy looked great in the crockpot with the mushrooms...no greasy spots.)

Made as directed and my entire family LOVED it.  Sort of odd to put these in a slow cooker but it actually turned out perfectly.  Since I've made this, I've also tried other versions.  Each time my family says its not the same and that THIS recipe was better.  Guess I'll keep this one around for a while.

I followed the suggestion to make it all in an electric skillet and it worked wonders. It was a quick easy meal. I also following the advise to cut out salt. I used reduced sodium soups and I am glad I did. It was a hit. We will be making it again.

My family loved my version which I got inspiration from this recipe. I totally worked with what I had and it was done with mashed potatoes and fresh salad  in 1hr. I mixed 1 lb. of 93% lean hamburger with two eggs, approx. 1/4 c. milk,  1-1 1/2 c. of smashed up dressing crumbs, pepper in my kitchen Aid mixer. I snuck in some leftover chopped asparagus from XMAS eve. Get the consistancy like you would for  hamberger patties or meatloaf. I formed them  into patties and coated with flower and pepper and fried in large deep skillet in conolla oil. I mixed together in sepparte bowl 1 large (the family size) can of cream of mushroom soup along with 1 packet of beef au-juce powder and about 3/4 c. of milk and 1/4 c. of water. This will be the gravy so get it to your likening. I then pourd it over patties. Turned it down to medium low and let it simmer while I cooked the potatoes with skins on. I added garlic and butter to the potatoes and again used the Kitchen aid-mixer to whip them up. Yummy  My version made 8 large 1/2 inch patties.

This was delicious! So easy to make. I made it in a skillet on the stove, because I didnt have time for the slow cooker. 
I added a can of mushrooms. Next time i think ill use crm mush soup instead of crm ckn. It was easy to make and yummy tho. Definitely a keeper

Love it! Thanks!  I have made this twice now using a mixture of 1/2 ground beef mixed with 1/2 ground venison. We prefer getting our venison mixed with ground beef from the butcher, since venison alone is too lean.  This was a fantastic recipe for venison meat, since being the wife of a deer hunter, I don't have much choice; I must use up the meat.  I didn't change anything else, and it was fantastic both tries. It's unusual to find a recipe that works so well with the venison.  Thanks again!!

The hubby and kids loved it, I used low sodium stuff and it was a tad bland for my liking. Smelled wonderful cooking! Definitely something I would make again, I think  I would add a bit more seasoning of some kind but definitely a keeper!

Will make again.  Used 2lbs of beef/pork mix and used crushed crackers instead of bread crumbs.  Instead of 8 big patties, I made 16 smaller ones- more like meatballs and then flattened them.  And I used brown gravy mix instead of the au jus mix because I didn't have any of that.  The cream of chicken made a good gravy.  Cooked 5 hours in the crock pot.    Tasted great (especially with the mashed potatoes I made to go with this).  Tasted even better the next day.Thanks for the recipe.

As others have mentioned, this was a hair on the salty side, but otherwise no complaints. I'd thought that the cream of chicken soup would be totally out of place and almost subbed in cream of mushroom soup instead, but I'm glad I didn't. The flavor was spot on as written. I think swapping one or two of the processed ingredients for their low sodium versions would cure the salt problem and make this outstanding.

I have made this several times. I have made it with cr. of chicken.... and cr. of mushroom. Stick to the recipe, the cream of chicken is much better. It is a fantastic dinner... one of the best I've ever had.  I did use the Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Thanks for this recipe!!!

I made the receipe as stated and the dish turned out wonderful.   I did make one minor change instead of using water, I substituted beef broth. and I also served it with homemade mashed potatoes.  I think I'm going to I use this recipe as a base for a freezer meal.  My family really enjoyed it they left me clean plates.

My family found this way too salty and the meat patties were too solid.

This was yummy! Lower rating because it was too salty for my taste. You may want to try find low sodium ingredients or add potatoes to take some of the salt away.

A solid recipe that I made according to the directions with only one change, I used Knorr Au Jus mix which has a lot less sodium than the regular brand.   Am making it again tonight.

Good flavor and texture but way too salty. I even used half the onion soup mix and made half of the condensed soup  lower sodium as suggested in the reviews. Next time I make it, I will modify the sodium even more  by using even less of the soup packet and use all lower sodium condensed soup. Also, in order to keep the onion flavor, I will add some caramelized onions to the gravy. Finally, I browned the steaks as instructed but instead of using a crockpot, I  baked mine in the oven at 350 until the meat thermometer read 165 F. They held together well and were firm yet moist.

So I thought this was gonna be super gross, because when it was done cooking it kind of turned Mushy and looked really greasy. But I made some mashed potatoes and slopped the steak on top, and it was delicious! My husband really loved it. The only reason why am not giving it  five stars is because the patties fell apart, and it was a little bit greasier than the foods I usually feel comfortable eating. Probably will make again tho.

Used a couple of the tweaks suggested such as beef broth instead of water and adding potatoes. Also added onion to the beef mixture. Turned out GREAT!

This recipe is so yummy and easy!  I actually used this recipe to make Shepherd's Pie. I just brown the meat instead of making pattys and use the same seasoning and gravy recipe. Then layer it with mashed potatoes and veggies and bake it... if you really want to lose your mind- make the Shepherd's Pie with the potatoes on bottom and biscuit on top! Call it a Shepherd's Pot Pie! So many calories  - but so so good!

THIS WAS A BIG HIT AT MY DINNER PARTY LAST NIGHT! My husband was super dubious over the entire concept of Salisbury Steak. He watched as I prepared the patties and he kept saying, "how is this different than meatloaf or burger patties?" I told him to be patient. His tone changed once he took his first bite! I think the entire party of 8 gave a collaborative "nomnom" with the meal. 

I looked through the comments about the Au Jus being too salty, so I chickened out and used brown gravy packets.

I do have to say, the crockpot was FILLED with grease after they were cooked. I took the patties out and placed them in a casserole dish and put them in the oven for about 30 minutes to "dry out". I had to get as much of the grease out of the gravy as possible.  I ended up transferring the gravy to a skillet and with the magic of cornstarch, made a nice hearty gravy. OH and I also used Cream of Mushroom and sauteed mushrooms in the gravy.

I WILL DEFINITELY BE MAKING THIS AGAIN!!! 
-ps- i served this with the slow cooker mashed potatoes and cream cheese corn. dessert was a New York Cheesecake with Strawberry Sauce. all recipes found here.

I did not have time for a slow cooker so followed TrishDish's directions and cooked in skillet and simmered.  Awesome!  Halfed the recipe except did 2 cans of cream of mushroom to have extra gravy.  Served with Knorr's beef stroganoff noodles --good stuff!

This is a great recipe! Even my picky 7 and 3 year old loved it! I was a bit skeptical about using cream of chicken, but as another review has stated, the au jus packet flavors it nicely. The only change I made to the recipe was, I threw in a pack of baby portobello mushrooms, and 1/2 of a large sliced onion. I served with red skin mashed potatoes and glazed carrots.

This is delicious!  With that said, I did "tweek" it a bit.  I omit the onion soup mix and slice a large onion and add it on top of the gravy once all  in the crock pot.  I also use cream of mushroom soup to replace one can of the cream of chicken soup.  I like to add fresh mushrooms to it also! I like to mix in some dried thyme and worcestershire to the meat mixture.   My family loves this.  We have it with mashed potatoes and corn!

Great recipe and great flavor.  Very easy to make and the entire family loved it.  The only thing I would have done different is make the patties thinner and smaller.  The 8 patties made were pretty thick and a lot of food for the kids.  I think next time I will make ten smaller and thinner patties.  Other than that, "Outstanding."

Good!  I cooked it meat on stove top, then transferred to crockpot on low. Heated soup milk and added a spoon full of sour cream, hmm.  Added that to crockpot over hamburber. No complaints here.

The flavor of the meat was very good.  I did make a few changes after reading some of the reviews.  I used cream of mushroom low sodium and beefy onion soup mix and also added a full package of sliced fresh mushrooms.

Great recipe! I always thought salisbury steak was gross until I tried this recipe.   To lighten it up, I used low sodium chicken soup, and I used 1 lb of ground turkey and 1 lb of ground beef (instead of 2 lbs of ground beef).  Very flavorful!

made this for family coming into town, doubled the batch and it was probably the best Salisbury steak I've ever had! I accidentally used three cans of soup instead of four but it was still awesome. This was immediately added to the recipe box!

Great blend of flavors. I followed the recipe exactly. Have made it many times and my son who is a very picky eater loves it served with garlic mashed potatoes.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it tasted great.  The sauce turns into a perfect gravy topping for mashed potatoes. 

A few things worth mentioning: 

1) The patties shrink. I would say make 6 patties to feed 6 people. 

2) This recipe has quite a bit of sodium. I'll use low sodium soup and maybe try cream of mushroom next time. 

Bottom line, this recipe (or a variation of)  will probably be a monthly staple in our home.

I read several reviews so I kind of knew what to expect with a couple things, such as this recipe is a bit salty. I did use low sodium soup but there is no choice for low sodium onion soup mix and au jus sauce. Overall this was very easy to make and it's very tasty. The next time I make this I will use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. Not that the cream of chicken soup made it bad but it would be nice to try the flavors  with cream of mushroom.

Super easy!!!!..... I didn't have ground beef so I used hamburger patties and it came out excellent..... The gravy was delicious I was skeptical at first about using cream of  chicken but that was all I had in the pantry and I'm glad I loved it.... Will be making again thanks for the recipe!!!!!

Found this recipe for dinner inspiration but cut it in half since I was only cooking for two. I followed others advice and only used a packet of au jus mix. I used half of it with the meat mix and half with the sauce (using cream of mushroom). I also added sliced mushrooms. It turned out so good! I made a side of mashed cauliflower that I didn't salt (only added butter and milk). The sauce went really well with it!

This came out perfect! Next time I will double it because everyone wanted seconds and I like to make enough for leftovers for lunch the next day however this did feed my family of four that eats well (two teenage growing boys with a fast metabolism) This really wasn't salty as some people suggested but then again we like a little salt to our food and I know my mom never salts her food and she tasted it and thought it was a tad bit on the salty side. For those who think it's too salty I would suggest you putting a potato in it not to eat but to absorb some of that saltiness but again to me it was perfect! I feel as if I hit the jackpot with this recipe cuz my whole family loves it.

I agree with the other reviews when it's a little on the salty side. I would add a teaspoon of sugar to the cream of mushroom mix to cut the saltiness. Other then that it's very good, I will be making it again.

Like others reviews I used 2 cans cr. of mushroom instead of cr. of chicken and a few shakes of Worcestershire Sauce.  Didn't serve with mashed potatoes... (Kids don't like them) but I served with French bread, a salad and apples.  Husband LOVED it and all three of our kids liked it as well.  Hard to find a meal everyone likes.

I loved this recipe. I cooked in the frying pan. I browned mushrooms till golden and removed. Then I added patties and browned them on both sides. I used golden mushroom soup 2 cans and mixed it with  water and su ju package. Mixed it up well and poured over patties. Put a cover and cooked until done around 20 minutes. Yummy we loved it.

Just made this for the family tonight. Everyone really loved it. I took the advise of some of the reviewers and only used half a packet of onion soup, I also added an egg to the meat mix to help bind it up. We will make this again for sure.

A new family favorite.  It is salty, but it's really good and doesn't take all day in the slow cooker.  Everyone loves the gravy.  Thanks for submitting this fabulous weekday dinner recipe!

I always make the recipe as-is the first time. I loved it. I made it with rice. The sauce was delicious and the "Salisbury steaks" were very tender and flavorful. This recipe is a keeper, for sure.

I thought this recipe had great flavor and the beef had a great texture.  I will definitely make this dish again.  It did not taste too salty for me.  I followed the recipe as written except I halved the recipe.

OMG I've made this recipe twice and the only thing I changed was using ground turkey instead of ground beef and I bake it in the oven for at until the patties are no longer pink in the middle. MY family really enjoys this recipe

Made this over the weekend.   LOVED the gravy.  But I think cooking the patties in the crockpot made them too dry.  I think I'll try cooking everything in the same skillet next time, like others have posted to do.   My kids didn't like it (ages 9 and 12)....  They are normally very open minded and will try anything.   But they said it tasted like "cafeteria food".  Haha!  I certainly don't want that!   Overall, not bad, but not great.

I found this dish as it is a wonderful meal and have made it a couple of times. Not only that without the ajous mix and the water this makes an excellent meatloaf as well.

This was great. I made it in my Instapot Duo 60 on high pressure for 30 minutes and it turned out perfect. I doubled the water and the sauce still turned out great.

This was the best!  So when I was writing out my shopping list I somehow forgot the au jus mix.  Since I had already started mixing everything, I used 2 packs of sazon instead.   Patties fell apart a bit but no biggie, didn't change the taste any =)  Since I added the sazon, it gave my end result gravy a bit of a reddish color.  I added a bit of browning sauce and was good to go.  Made a meal with mashed potatoes and green beans.

Tastes great but takes way longer than 4-5 hours on low. Way longer. I had to break the patties apart just to get them done, so basically it was a stew. Flavor was great though and you can't beat that gravy.

I really enjoyed this! Mixed pepper with the flour before dredging the meat. Instead of water I used beef broth and added fresh sliced mushrooms as well. Gravy worked excellent served over mashed potatoes.

This was very tasty!  Great comfort food.  The leftovers were even better.  I did use cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken soup, and mine was was not salty at all.  I also recommend making the patties thinner 1/2" or less. Otherwise, they may still be pink inside after 5 hours.  I expected mine to shrink a lot but they didn't (possibly due to the low fat beef I use).

This is a great recipe.  I made up three batches and froze two.  I did use the crockpot and it was perfect. My family told me it was a little rich so I didn't add the onion soup mix and decided to just put onions in the meat.  I also used half ground beef and half ground turkey.  TBA on how it turns out.

Have made this recipe several times. Have used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup condensed. Both turn out  great. I normally add extra mushrooms. This is one of the best recipes I have tried.

It was to salty for my taste. Adjust the packet mix and use low sodium soup and I'd make it again.

This recipe is soooo good and very easy. I took the suggestions from other comments and I did not cook it in the slow cooker because I wanted a quick 30 minute meal and this is it! PERFECT! Even my picky teenager loved it. I have made it numerous times with home made ground turkey patties and store bought Butterball Turkey patties. Either way you decide to make it; it is very good! I highly recommend it for a quick and delicious 30 minute meal.

Took the advice of Tracy and Dave M.   I used 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom and even added a jar of mushroom pieces.  The added mushrooms really gave it a nice little extra flavor.  Next time we'll use sirloin and add chopped onions as they suggested.  But overall the meal was delicious. Meat was tender and was loaded with flavor.

I will definitely make this again! I like the all-natural route, when I can, so I made my own cream of beef soup and onion soup mix. Would be tasty with the store-bought items, though, and super easy. Thanks!

I used my electric skillet to brown the patties and then simmer them. The recipe was followed with any changes.
This is a keeper, and oh yes, will make this again and again.

Fabulous! Can't rave enough! My partner asked me to make it once a week. In fact, we're having it again tomorrow. Perfect, perfect, perfect! Wish I had added mushrooms as suggested but forgot them when I was at the store. Adding them next time though! Regardless, still so good (and easy)! Yum!

I made this the other day after I got home from work. It was very good and didn't take long to throw together. I didn't use my slow cooker to make it though. I just cooked it up in a skillet on the stove and it still turned out excellent.

OK let me start by saying I love when people post their changes!  I've never followed a recipe word for word in my life - I'm more of a "by instinct" cook anyway.  All recipes are just a starting point for me.  And I hardly ever use processed or instant mixes if I can help it.
With that, here are my changes:
I used 94% lean beef, and used only half a packet of onion soup mix, with panko instead of bread crumbs (no additives!) and a tablespoon worchestershire.  I cooked the patties with chopped onions, then drained on paper towels.  To the pan I added mushrooms, covered 2 min, 2 tbsp flour,  1 tbsp worchestershire, 1/4 c merlot and a whole box of beef broth, a chicken bouillon cube and 1 tsp salt + 1/2 tsp pepper. I reduced, then added 1/2 cup milk, premixed with a 1 tbsp flour to thicken. You might want to add salt and pepper to taste later, so you control your own saltiness. It also makes plenty of extra gravy!
I put the patties into the crockpot, poured the homemede sauce over the top, and let cook on low for 5 hours.  We served this with garlic mashed potatoes and cooked baby carrots.
It was a little legthier prep this way, but wow oh wow, was it amazing.  Hubs and kids (and picky eater friend) gobbled up every bite! Next time I will skip the crockpot altogether and just finish it in the oven while I make the potatoes and carrots.

I made this but used 3 tablespoons of Mrs Dash Onion & Herb Medley , 2 tablespoons of dehydrated onion flakes and1 teaspoon of onion powder instead of the onion soup mix.  I also added 1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce, 1 tablespoon of low sodium catsup and 2 ounces of water instead of the milk. After browning the patties I added mushroom soup mix (enough to make 4 servings) and 3 cups of water. Let it all simmer on top of the stove for 45 minutes. Stirred it 2-3 times only. Sauteed sliced and onions and mushrooms and threw them in at the end. YUM!

Salty. Gravy a little thick. I adjusted the servings to 4.  But, it was really good!
I just didn't put much spice in the mash potatoes & stacked 'Mashed Potatoes-Gravy-Patty-Gravy' like the picture. Eating together diluted the taste of salt as a balance.
I'd add water & reduce either the McCormick Au Ju or the Lipton Onion Soup Mix ~ Or Both ~ Depending on what's creating the salty taste.
But, everyone ate & everyone enjoyed. Very Good.

Very good recipe - used bison and ground beef both, had cream of mushroom soup so used that. Used gravy mix because I didn't have any onion soup mix - turned out great. I overcooked it by an hour or so but with all the gravy they didn't really dry out. Thanks!

I made this with cream of mushroom condensed soup (reduced sodium) in place of the cream of chicken and added 3 medium sized Crimini mushrooms, sliced.  It was a simple meal to prepare and the "steaks" had a nice consistency but overall it was a bit too salty for our family's taste. I will most likely try to modify the recipe further (possibly replacing the au jus?) to balance the flavor.

OMG!  This is  delicious!!  Hubby loved it as well.  The only thing I did different is use regular brown gravy mix and toss in a can of sliced mushrooms.  You gotta try this recipe!

This was a winner!!  Husband and boys loved it and had second helpings. The gravy seemed thick when preparing but thinned out upon cooking.  Delicious!

For the gravy I used one jar of beef gravy with one can golden mushroom and one can of regular mushroom soup.   I like a lot of gravy for pasta or mash potatoes.  Also added to the gravy sauteed  onions  and 8 ounces of portabella mushrooms after browning the beef patties .  In addition to the other ingredients of the beef I added a small amount of Parmesan shredded cheese and and used for 5 shakes of Worcestershire sauce in the beef.
Delicious!

I made this exactly as instructed. It was super easy and delicious. My daughter said it reminded her of chicken fried steak. She was actually the only one that didn't like it. But I'm giving it 5 stars because my picky 2 year old and myself and my husband enjoyed it. I probably won't make any changes to it when I make it again.

I did add a can of mushroom soup also.

I thought it is a great and fast recipe ! I did make it in a electric skillet and it worked out great. I did add half teaspoon of onion & garlic powder and a half tablespoon of Italian seasoning. It will be served again.

VERY GOOD!!  Followed recipe other than used butter instead of vegetable oil and added 4 ounce can of mushroom stems & pieces about mid-way through cooking cycle.  Only reason for 4 versus 5 star is--as others have stated--is its extreme saltiness.  Next time I make this (which I definitely will), I'll add beef broth to the mix to cut down on salty taste and make the gravy more consistent.  Definitely a keeper!

I used 1lbs ground turkey and 1lbs lean ground beef. I didn't see everyone's reviews saying it was salty until it was cooking.  The steaks didn't taste too salty; the gravy was the salty part, which was slightly noticable with mashed potatoes and very noticeable with bread. I WILL make this again, but will use reduced sodium cream of chicken soup and if that doesn't reduce the salt, I'll half the au jus packet. Everyone loved it!!!

I hated Salisbury Steak as a child so when I became an adult this dish was definitely out of the question but up pops this recipe, I felt like I was on Masterchef  a clean plate favorite... Of course I had to put a lil sas to it...I added a dash of garlic powder and substituted cream of onion soup (1) can and used dry beef and mushroom gravy and instead of cooking it in the slow cooker, I prepared it on top of the stove other then that I stuck to the original recipe

I was super hesitant after some of the reviews. Just about the saltiness.  I made the recipe and made NO changes. I wanted to give it a fair shake as-is. I am so glad that I didn't!  This is an amazing recipe! The recipe is very simple and the prep time is minimal which is what I needed.  My husband and son loved it! The taste is perfect.  The gravy is to die for! I will use this gravy for my roasts from here on out. It's that good. Make it!  You won't regret it!

I halved the amount of meat (just DH and I), but wish I would have made the full recipe- it's that good!! I did not use the onion soup mix, but used minced dried onions. Kept everything else the same, and I was very impressed. Yes, it's a bit more work (browning the patties first) than just throwing everything into the crock pot, but well worth the extra effort!!

This recipe was very good!  A big hit in my house.  I had to tweek it some by adding  a whole purple onion, sliced baby Bella mushrooms, and my favorite seasonings.  I also used 2 packages of Au Ju and a extra can of water to dilute the salt.  OMG, did this come out good!

I made this dish for meal prep. It was delicious but I did make a few changes. As everyone stated that the dish came out salty I tried to avoid that. I used ground chuck as I am not a fan of lean meat.To the flour dredge I mixed in garlic and onion powder and cooked them with canola oil  (no reason honestly-it was the 1st one I picked up). I only used half of the au jus mix and instead of water I used unsalted beef broth for more flavor. I let them cook on high in my Crockpot for about an hour and the rest on low bc after a long day of grocery shopping and cooking I wanted to speed up the process. I made smashed garlic potatoes with yellow gold potatoes as the side and used a bit of the sauce from the Crockpot as gravy. VERY TASTY although I'd advise you not to eat this in public as you may fall into a sleep coma. I think next time that I try this recipe I will used one pound ground chuck and one pound sirloin for a WOW factor...

It was delicious!! The entire family loved/liked it , and this is a great thing with 6 different peoples taste buds !! I had a little over 2 1/2 lbs of ground beef so I added extra milk and bread crumbs, perfect! And extra water to gravy sauce . This probably helped with some reviews saying it was to salty! Definitely will make again!

First time I've reviewed a recipe here! I've been eye-balling this recipe for weeks and decided it had to be tried. Read all the reviews first, then checked the pantry. Dry au jus gravy mix - check! Cream of chicken or cream of mushroom - non to be found, BUT found a can of cream of chicken with mushroom (best of both worlds)! 

Since I was cooking for two I used 1 lb of lean ground beef. Left out the dry onion soup mix (can't stand the stuff and never buy it) but added ~1/4 cup finely diced Vidalia onion. Browned the beef patties, removed from the skillet and added the cream of chicken with mushroom soup, 1 cup water and the whole packet of au jus gravy; stirred until fully combined and put the beef patties back in the skillet.  Spooned the gravy over the patties, lowered the heat and covered with a lid. Left it to cook for 20 minutes, turned the patties over and cooked for 30 minutes more.  Homemade mashed potatoes and steamed baby carrots on the side.  Hunny told me after dinner "don't make this again - TONIGHT - but definitely keep this recipe"!

This is so good! I did not use dry onion soup mix, instead I chopped fresh onion. As suggested I used cream of mushroom soup. I also sauted portabella mushroom slices and placed them on top. I cooked these on low all day and they turned out great! I will be doing this again for sure!

I followed another reviewers advice and just made the whole dish in my electric skillet.  I used 3 pounds of hamburger so I doubled the onion soup mix.  Also, I only had one can of cream of chicken on hand so I included one can of cream of mushroom as well.  It was absolutely wonderful.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  I think I may add some mushrooms to it next time as well.

I made this really close to the recipe. My only change was that I since I didn't have ground beef on hand (I know! shameful!)but I had lots of ground turkey - so I substituted it. Plus, I added a can of mushroom stems and pieces on top of the steaks before adding the gravy mixture. Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter. My husband wolfed his down before I was barely three bites into mine! I was concerned about the sodium content, but apparently I was the only one. The turkey was good, but I think I would have preferred the ground beef version. I agree with other reviewer that next time (of which there will be many) I will be more creative and try to cut the sodium; use cream of mushroom soup instead; try making the recipe entirely on top of the stove or try even baking it for a bit if I haven't planned ahead. Regardless, we really liked it and my husband had the leftovers portioned into take-out containers for his lunches for the next couple of days before I was even finished with my dinner. High praise, indeed!

I make this recipe often because it's a big hit with my family.  I tried using cream of mushroom soup once and it was just as good. I added mushrooms and it made it fantastic. I was thinking about experimenting with chicken instead of ground beef to see how well it tastes.

Very good. Liked the way the burgers stay together.
Thought next time I might try the Beefy Mushroom Soup instead of the Cream of Chicken.
But good just the way it is. Makes great gravy.

I noticed objections to salt, so Instead of the packaged dry soup mix and au jus ,   I used the recipes for the same that I found right here on All recipes.com, minus the salt..then salt to taste at serving.

All the basics are there.  Used Cream of Mushroom instead of chicken and used a covered fry pan instead of slow cooker - have been making this dish for at least 15 years and it is definitely a keeper. The slower the cooking the better the gravy - but don't forget to stir regularly.  Add button mushrooms for that beef bourginon style. Mari

Not much of a canned soup fan. I will make it again, using fresh homemade dry onion soup mix and fresh homemade mushroom soup. That will also help with the saltiness. And those recipes are right here on this site!

After reading um-teen reviews, I decided to follow other reviewers' suggestions and my own intuition and omit the processed items and make this slow cooker dish. I sautéed an onion instead of using the onion soup mix. I made a roux and used it with sautéed mushroom as the basis for the gravy. Salisbury steak is classically served with onion gravy, so I sliced an onion very thinly and sweated it before adding it to the mix for the slow cooker. The meat was tasty, I had decreased the bread crumbs per other reviewers and served it over Chef John's mashed potatoes. My rendition was 5 stars but I had so modified the recipe that I had to give the original just 3 stars. This is the reason that I read the reviews on Allrecipes site before cooking. Thanks for the original idea Tesslynn.

Cooked high for first 1.5 hours.  Did a lb each of ground pork and ground chuck, pork costs half as much.  Added one chopped onion , and last hour and a half added 4 chopped potatoes.  Should have added mushrooms to it too, but will do next time.  Thanks, kid is loving this recipe.

This is such a hit in my house! My son loves it and requested it be his birthday dinner tonight. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the sodium.I use low sodium cream of chicken and soup mix.

This recipe is a keeper!  I made the recipe as is - except, didn't have time for the slow cooker.  Instead, I covered lightly with foil and cooked in the oven at 300 degrees (F) until the beef was done.  The leftovers were just as good.

Wow! This is a fantastic recipe. I did use Cream of Mushroom (I didn't mean to alter the recipe... must have just seen "Cream of" and defaulted to mushroom since it is Salisbury Steak). 

Anyway, the CoM I used was low sodium, so the recipe wasn't too salty for me. I neglected to use the flour when I browned the patties, and cooked everything for about 4.5 hours. The meat was incredibly flavorful, tender... just fantastic. I ended up with so much gravy I put a bit aside to freeze and use later. 

Also added one yellow onion - perfect! 

Thank you SO MUCH, Tesslynn, for sharing! :)

i baked this covered at 350 for 1 hour because I wanted to try it and did not have time for the crock pot. Otherwise I followed the recipie exactly. It was so easy too. No choping or dicing. Just assemble and throw in oven. I loved it and so did my family! None of us found it to salty as after reading the reviews I warned everyone to taste before using salt(as they should always anyway). I will make this many times. No changes.

I'll use low sodium cream of mushroom next time instead of the cream of chicken, otherwise delicious. Good that it can be quick on the stovetop or in the crock pot for more time

Instead of onion soup I used beef bouillon with some minced up onions to reduce the sodium levels.  I usually double the sauce because we serve it over mashed potatoes, too.  This is a staple in my house; everyone loves it!

This was so good! I will be making it again. I actually didn't use the slow cooker. I ended up letting those babies simmer in the gravy while I made the potatoes. It was fabulous!

This recipe is amazing!  I've been making it for almost 2 years now and I actually crave this!  I usually make it in the electric skillet and skip the crockpot, it's relatively quick and easy.  It is so good with mashed potatoes using the sauce as a gravy!  A lot of times I halve this recipe because I make it for just my husband, 2 year old, and me.  When I halve it, I will use the rest of the dry mixes and can of chicken soup to make extra gravy.  Delicious!

This one is great, as long as you make the meat patties a bit on the thin side & brown it for a bit longer than you normally might for a slow cooker recipe.

The gravy was out-of-this-world delicious!

I made the recipe almost as is. I only had one can of cream of mushroom soup on hand so I used a can of that and a can of cream of chicken and it tasted fine, I might try both cream of mushroom next time since that is what everyone is liking better. I didn't get the low sodium soup and it was very salty. I highly suggest low sodium soup. But it was overall a great recipe!

Delicious! My boyfriend was a huge fan. We used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken & it was so yummy. Super tender and flavorful. The gravy mix separated but we mixed it real good before pouring onto our plates. Couldn't get enough!! Recommend cooking as close to 5 hours as you can so the meat isn't pink.

this rating is really for the meat, because I did the sauce differently.  We really liked this.  The meat turned out very tender and moist.  I put carrots, mushrooms and potatoes in the bottom under the meat to make it a meal and added frozen peas to the top for the last half hour.  Because we don't like creamy sauces or "cream of" soups I used one can beef broth, one can water and one package of gravy mix instead.  Turned out very well.  Was a lot of liquid and was not as thick or flavorful as it could have been, so next time I might omit the water.  Thought this might be helpful for anyone else who likes salisbury steak but not creamy gravy.

Not sure what I did wrong. Followed the instructions but the gravy that was cooking with the meat turned out really oily. Besides that, it was good.

I tend to like a lot of salt, and I thought this was too salty. That's why I only gave 4 stars. Other than that, this is definitely a 5 star meal!

I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I used cube steak instead of ground beef and did not brown beforehand.
I mixed the onion mix and bread crumbs together; dredged the steaks; and tried to pyramid them in my slow cooker.
Then I mixed one can cream of chicken, one can cream of mushroom and the au jus together. I don't remember if I added the water or not (oops!). Poured everything over the steaks and cooked on low all day while we were at work.
House smelled AMAZING when we got home. Steaks were super tender and flavorful.

We ate without any sides, but there was plenty of gravy to have had some with mashed potatoes, rice or noodles. That might also have helped it seem less salty.

I will definitely try again. Maybe trying to find low sodium soups or mixes or adding a bit more water.

Just made it. Did the single pan following the normal recipe. Used soup mixed with a little milk, not water. After browning, pour soup over and medium simmer for 15 or 20 minutes. Kids really liked it a lot.

OMG my family raved about this recipe!!!! It was so good and so simple to make.  Thank you so much Tesslynn for sharing this recipe.  My father was licking the plate after I brought it to him and he was almost upset when it was all gone. I added fresh diced onion pieces in with the gravy it was a big hit!!!

Made this  recipe with only 1 change- I only used half of the onion soup mix  as the  other reviewers complained about it being too salty. However, after having made this already I think it would have been ok to use the whole pack. Everything else I did exactly as stated. It...was...AMAZING!!!  Made it for my husband, daughter and in laws and they ALL loved it. Me too! I love this recipe and will definitely be making it again. I highly recommend it. Also, the chicken soup works great- do NOT change it. Recipe is great as is.

To be fair I only used the basic recipe as a guide since I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. And I only made 4 servings. Used beef broth for the water and added a teaspoon of kitchen bouquet for the au jus. I used mushroom soup and buffalo chicken fry steak.  chopped half an onion very coarsely and put it in as well.  It was really good and tender and my husband liked it.

Absolutely perfect just as written. Followed the recipe exactly. The baby, the boy and I all loved it.  Served it over pasta, with Honey Roasted Carrots on the side, also from this site.  We gave everything 5 stars!  I love when that happens!!!  :)

Have made this a number of times using about 3 lbs. of ground beef.  Use chicken stock in place of water and chicken/mushroom soups.  Only downfall is trying to find "low sodium" everything because it is very salty, right on the verge of being too much.  Great served with mashed potatoes.

Made this today and it was a hit with the family. I made some of the suggested modifications, replaced one of the vans of cream of chicken with cream of onion and used beef broth and a bit of Worcestershire instead of au jus. I also added cubed potatoes the last couple of hours of cooking time. There was more prep work involved than what I would normally do for a slow cooker meal. For that reason I wouldnt recommend it for a weeknight dinner if you're short on time.  Overall very food and super simple. Will make this one again.

The sauce was good and the recipe was easy, but the meat came out as hard as a rock. Had trouble chewing it it was so tough. I think next time I may try the same recipe but cook it for a less amount of time.

This wasn't bad, and I did not find it overly salty as many did.  I do think it would be better and more flavorful with cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, and that I would like to use fresh mushrooms as well.  A heavy dash of Worcestershire sauce will do it well, too.

This was delicious! I did make a change, just because I didn't have dry onion soup mix and I live an hour from the nearest grocery store. I just used minced onion to season the patties to substitute for the soup mix. Next time I will just throw some real onion in there. It was so delicious without the dry onion soup mix I just don't see the need to bother. This is one of those that is so good it's hard to mess up!

I tried this with 1 lb of ground chicken, cream of chicken soup and chicken broth (adjust both for creaminess and to cover meat) added to the crockpot and a little Kitchen Bouquet, to darken it a bit to give it that "beefy" look and gosh-a-mighty...was it good. Even better the next day!

I saw a lot say it was salty and by itself it was , however if you take some potatoes and boil them for 25 to 30 mins. Drain the potatoes, and then mash them up really good, and serve the steak over the potatoes and eat them mixes together, you wont need low sodium anything. If you dont add any seasonings to the potatoes it makes the soups perfect mixed in the potatoes. This was an absolute favorite, my picky eater even asked for it to be served up for her lunch the next day.

Soooo good. Used ground sirloin. There is no need to use a slow cooker and wait 5 hours for dinner. This can easily be thrown together in electric skillet and be done in 30 minutes. I actually think it tastes better this way and you don't need to coat meat in flour if doing it with skillet. I set skillet to 350 and then turn it down after meats browned. Just brown meat on each side and then add everything else. I add a big can of chopped mushrooms and double the water to make more sauce. My 3 year old said it's his favorite :)

My daughter and I absolutely loved this recipe. If I wasn't the one to cook this dish, I wouldn't knew this was ground Turkey!!! The ingredients are bursting with flavor all the way through every bite. The ingredients used also complements and pair amazingly. I did not have to alter or change anything about this recipe. This is the perfect dish for ground Turkey. Tasted exactly like Salisbury steak for us. Thanks for posted recipe: ) :)

Exceptional easy keep and make many more times. Used mushroom soup and cooked in cast iron skillet.  I'm sure either soup, and crock pot or stove top provide an easy to make delicious meal for your family.  This is the cat's meow.  It's just that good.

Pretty good recipe. I did what someone in the comments suggested and used cream of mushroom instead of chicken soup. Couldn't find Au Jus mix, so I replaced it with brown gravy mix. The consistency of the meat was a bit weird. Thinking the cooking time may have been a tad too long. Made mashed potatoes with it, which I think is necessary.

If you can't eat beef like me here is an alternative, I use 1/2lb of ground pork and 1/2lb sausage meat instead of beef follow the recipe except for dry au jus mix I used a couple of liquid browning. It came out amazing and the family loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

The "meat and potatoes" lovers in my family liked this one. First time I made it, it was a touch too salty. Next time I opted for low sodium ingredients and that made a difference. I also opted for cream of mushroom soup over cream of chicken.

I simply want to ask a question, sorry.  I'm trying this recipe but I found the meat kept falling apart when browning it.  Why?  1/2 of the patties broke up.  It seems a fairly dry mixture even with the bit of milk.

I made this recipe exactly as written. I gave it a 4 because it was very salty, and the sauce wasn't very beef gravy-like. I will definitely change the cream of chicken to cream of mushroom next time. The recipe is really easy, and a good quick meal. Thank you for the recipe

Absolutely fantastic.  Like a previous poster mentioned, instead of using the crock pot, I did this in a "chicken fryer" pan.  It was incredible.

Amazingly Good! Little salty but working on improving! Goes great with Mashed Potatoes or Rice! I also added extra can of cream of chicken soup for more gravy!

Great Dinner!! Made this 2x. Used 3lbs lean beef, 1lb ground pork. Also, low salt soup. Family loved this!! A winner. Flour also thickens the gravy. Enjoy!!

This recipe is so good.  I made it for the first time and everybody loved.  I gave my aunt some and she wants me to give the recipe to her daughter.  I didn't change anything in the recipe and I found it just right.  No body complained of it being to salty.  Before the week was over I had to make it again.

This is a very good slow-cooker meal and it is very flexible for substitutions. I used one lb. of ground beef and one lb. of ground pork for the meat. Also sub'd half a cup of chopped onion instead of the dry onion soup to reduce the sodium content. For the gravy I used one can of cream of chicken and one can cream of mushroom along with the water and au jus packet. The gravy just calls for lots of mashed potatoes . Very good and easy!

We had this recipe tonight and the whole family thought it was awesome! Not too salty for us. We used 98% fat free cream of chicken soup. We also threw in some red baby potatoes. I did cook it for 3-4 hours on high and it came out fine. We will definitely do this one again!

This was very easy to make. I was worried that it was gonna taste salty based on all the other reviews, but it wasn't salty at all, I broke up the patty and mixed it with mashed potatoes, it was delicious! There was a lot of grease, so after cooking I sat the patties in a dish lined with paper towel for a while. It seemed to help. It was a really good meal, that I plan on making again.

I used a mushroom and onion soup mix bc I'm not the biggest fan of onions.   I also used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom.   I also skipped dredging the patties in flour but it may have been better if I did.   But overall it was awesome !!    The entire family loved it.    I will make this many times again.   I highly recommended this.   And it only took 15 mins of prep.  Even better for a busy mom like me.

We should've been told to cook patties almost all the way bc I kept having to skim LOTS of grease off the top after about 2 hours of cooking. Had to send hubby for another can of soup bc I lost so much removing grease. That defeated my purpose of cooking in a crock pot-not having to keep messing with it. Had I not been home to do this, it would've been ruined. After all of that, I it was very tasty.

Other than being a bit salty, this was great! We have dairy allergies so I substituted golden mushroom soup for the cream of chicken and rice milk. Next time I will use either half the au jus packet or none to help keep the saltiness down.

These were so good!  Didn't make any changes. Will use a leaner meat next time (used 80/20) for less 'greasy' gravy.  But other then that, so yummy!

We had this for dinner tonight and it is delicious!  A lot of clean up, but I would not change it.  Doing it this way, the grease from the hamburger does not go to the crockpot.  We followed the recipe to the letter.  This is comfort food at its finest.

Loved it! The only thing I changed was Cream of Mushroom in place of the chicken. Only 3/4 pack of the Lipton Onion Soup mix. Even my son who hates everything asked for more.

This is a great meal!  Made for company and they LOVED it!  I did only use 1/2 the onion soup mix as some reviews said it was too salty.  Other than that the only change I made was adding mushrooms after adding the soup mix to the crockpot.  Will definitely make again!

This turned out surprisingly good.  It looked a mess when I first put it together.  I used cream of mushroom soup because I thought it would go better with the beef and only cooked in the slow cooker 4 hours.

My family loved this recipe! Easy to make and total comfort food. I didn't have 2 cans of condensed cream of chicken, only one so I subbed with cream of mushroom which I did have on hand. As others have stated, it is salty, so buy low sodium where you can and no need to add in salt. Will be made again for sure! Thanks :)

I made this awhile back and just getting to a review. I'm a picky eater, my roommate is not so I knew he would definitely like it. We both really enjoyed it. I see complaints about "too salty" but I didn't have any problems. I loved how the hamburger came out almost like the salisbury steak I remember as a kid. Of course, we ate it over mashed taters so maybe that's why it didn't seem salty. Making it again tonight.

Absolutely loved this! It was super easy and yummy. Reminded me of meatloaf. It was hard for me to find low sodium cream of chicken soup, but I think it's just too salty otherwise.

This was really good....my family loved it.  I used panko bread crumbs because that's what I had.   Served it over mashies.  The texture of the cooked patties was very moist and fine...not mealy like regular burgers.   The proof was in the leftovers......there were none.  3 people, entire recipe, all gone!

This is a great recipe.  I made it exactly as the directions said.  I didn't find it too salty at all.  Very easy to make and the kids all wanted seconds. I will probably double the gravy next time I make it to have more to put over rice.

Excellent.  Followed the recipe with no modifications.   May add mushrooms the next time.  Not too salty.   Not sure where the dark brown gravy came form in the photo.

My husband absolutely raved that this was the best Salisbury steak he has ever had! Other cooks reiterated how salty it was so I made sure to use low sodium options everywhere. The worst is that I just could not get my hands on any au jus. I can't wait to make it again, I know it will be even better. I procrastinated until it was too late to make it in the slow cooker and made it in an electric skillet and put it on low to cook for about an hour. Delicious gravy!

This was the first time I made Salisbury steak in my house and this recipe was a big hit, even with my picky kids. I stayed very close to the original recipe, only adding a small can of mushroom and 1/4 cup diced onions to the mix.  Also I only used 1 1/2 lbs of lean ground beef in stead of two lbs., but kept the amount of bread crumbs, onion soup mix, and water the same.  The result was fabulous, lots of tasty gravy and 6 good sized beef patties.  I did not think it was overly salty, but I did use the reduced sodium and fat cream of chicken soup.  It was so good served over homemade mashed potatoes with a side of peas and 7 up biscuits.  I will definitely be adding this recipe to the rotation.

very flavorful. Use low sodium everything though! Used onion soup recipe from sight. Would serve over mashed pots instead of noodles next time. Cook in electric skillet for 20 mins.

This is very good, although I'm glad I read the reviews and only used 1/2 packet of soup mix because it was still very salty.  I may cut back on the au just mix next time as well.  I added some mushrooms since my hubby likes them.  Also forgot this was a crockpot recipe and when I got home from work there was no time for that, so I just simmered it on the stove for about 25 mins and it worked out fine.  Will be making again!

This recipe was delicious! I made the modification of using Cream of Mushroom soup in lieu of the chicken broth. I also used Angus grass fed ground beef 94% lean and it turned out great. The meat was thick and juicy, not "crumbly". The soup made a nice gravy and I served with white rice. My partner and my 11 year old daughter loved this!

My boyfriend loves Salisbury steak ... The frozen dinner kind. He absolutely loved this! Said it was the best thing yet that I've cooked for him. Although I believe I have cooked many other things better, lol but he really loved this. I thought it was ok but then again, I'm not a big Salisbury steak fan.

As stated by another, it is very salty - that is because of the Au Jus prepacked, but even making it with 'made from scratch' Au Jus it is still a bit too salty. Salt lovers will give this 5 stars. Still, it is made in a slow cooker so you can walk away from it and let it cook slowly without a problem. Simply add flour or cornstarch for thicker gravy.

Very easy and tasty recipe. I used cream of mushroom only because it made more sense to me, versus cream of chicken. Nice flavor and easy to put together. I reduced the beef by half (but kept onion soup mix the same) since it was just myself, my husband and daughter, and still made 6 patties. served over mashed potatoes- excellent dinner!

This was pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly even though I was planning on getting reduced sodium ingredients based on other reviews and then forgot.  Next time I will buy the low sodium b/c it is a bit too salty otherwise.  My kids thought they were like mini meat loafs and preferred to scrape off the gravy (which I love!) and put ketchup on them!  Maybe I will add fresh mushrooms to it next time.

Super easy! A nice "stick to your ribs" comfort dish that does all the work for you on a cold day, It was so nice and fast to just add pasta and a veggie.  I went with the cream of mushroom over the cream of chicken as my preference. This is a keeper.

We loved this.  I have remade it several times.  I do cook it in an electric skillet on low for a couple of hours.  I use the leftover steaks and gravy for shepherd pie.  Thanks for the recipe.

Loved it!!  I used cream of mushroom soup, instead of cream of chicken.
My picky eaters even loved it.  Will make again!

This is a great recipe. The only changes I made was to use 1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. ground pork and to replace the cream of chicken soup with golden mushroom.

This was my first time making salisubry steak, and it was delicious! It was a little thin in the sauce so I thickened it a little with some cornstarch, and it made a perfect gravy to go over the mashed potatoes. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Tasted wonderful.  I used cream of mushroom (didn't have cream of chicken)  Made mistake of using beef boulion granules (didn't have  au jus).  Simple; and so tasty.  Thank you for sharing.

Made this tonight and hubby liked it as well.  I had to use beef boullion as I did not have aujus mix and thought it was a bit salty.  Also a little strong on the onion so when I make it again, and I will, I will adjust the those two ingredients.

As always made this EXACTLY to recipe for the first time (wish everyone would do this)  It was just OK.  Sent hubby to get ground beef and he got 85% lean.  gravy had grease floating on top.  Next time I will get 95-97% lean.  Meat patties a little bland, needed something, not sure what.  Will try again with a few tweaks and leaner ground beef.  Gravy had a good taste, may try gravy with round steak for swiss steak.

This is very delicious. I didn't salt the rice we had with this, because the gravy was a little salty. This is a keeper.

I have made this recipe twice, the first time it was too salty and the second time I used "heart Healthy" Cream of Chicken Soup to reduce the salt.  My husband liked it both times.

Winner winner beefy dinner! I did find this on the salty side but I'm sure there are ways to cut this down (lower sodium soups, use something else other than the onion soup mix in the meat, etc.) if you are watching your salt intake, but my family said DELICIOUS! The only change I made was to use one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom as I only had one can of the cream of chicken. Great this way, so I think I will make it this way from now on! Very easy...get the meat and sauce in the crock pot, set your time and temperature, then walk away until dinner time!

Ended up being way too salty for my taste. I would have rated it a 3 based on that, but my husband really liked it & thought it deserved a 5, so compromised at a 4. Easy to make though. Added 1 tsp of mustard powder and 1 tsp of garlic powder after 2nd time made because hubby requested to make this again. Still too salty for my taste.

Really great flavor!  Even though I used extra-lean ground beef, there was still quite a bit of oil in the slow cooker when this finished cooking.  Also, as previous reviewers have mentioned, in the future I'd like to find a way to reduce the amount of sodium.

This was a hit at my house. My son, who was determined not to like it, loved it! I'm making it again tonight. The only change I made was because I didn't have Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Instead, I added my plain bread crumbs and an envelope of Italian dressing mix. I served it with mashed potatoes and it was scrumptious!

Delicious recipe.  Easy to prepare, wonderful served with mashed potatoes.  Didn't change a thing.  Some said it was too salty so I opted not to use any salt in the mashed potatoes to counter that.  Seemed perfect to me.

This dish was excellent! My family loved it! I couldn't get my 2 year old to eat it but that's not saying much... I will definitely be making this one again. I used cream of mushroom soup because that was all I had. And only 1 1/2 lbs of meat. But we had extra sauce which was nice because we wanted to lick our plates clean.

Was good but meat was way too salty. Tried it a second time with cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. Also i left out the onion soup mix and added 1 cup finely chopped onion and a clove of minced garlic to meat. My family loved it! Was great with mashed poetatoes! I love cooking in the crock pot and will make this recipe again!

This was really good. Served it over egg noodles and I did half the onion soup mix at the suggestion of others and added some mushrooms that we had on hand.

I made it exactly as written, but just half of the recipe.  The burgers were the density of the Salisbury steak I had in frozen dinners as a kid, so to me they are perfect.

Had it with Bob Evans mashed potatoes.  Next time I might put some Worcestershire in with the ground sirloin, but I have no complaints as is.

Made this exactly as written except I halved it and it turned out great!  Not too salty at all...  Started it out on high for about 30 minutes, then turned to low and after 3 hrs. it was done!

My husband loves anything with hamburger and loved this recipe. He asks me to make it when company comes because everyone gets full and satisfied. Make with mashed potatoes and a vegetable. The gravy is
wonderful on the potatoes. Followed the recipe exactly and turned perfect. I will experiment and try other soups but we love it the way
the recipe is written. You won't be disappointed if your family
loves hamburger, mashed potatoes and gravy.

I made this dish for my family and they absolutely loved it! Instead of 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, I used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom. I added 1 envelope Lipton onion soup as well as 1 envelope Lipton onion mushroom soup mix to the ground beef mixture and about a tablespoon extra breadcrumbs. I went a bit further and chopped up 2 medium onions and added 20 ounces of fresh sliced portobello mushrooms. Last but not least, I double dredged the patties before searing off and added a full cup of water. The gravy turned out just lovely and the patties were very moist and flavorful! A definite keeper!

I tried the recipe last night.  I used only half the dry au jus packet, half the dry onion soup mix, 1/4 cup of Italan bread crumbs and 1/4 cup of pinko bread crumbs.  It was DELICIOUS!  The family loved it.

I hate ground beef recipes but the rest of the family likes it so I looked for something new to do besides meatballs, burgars or meatloaf.  We loved it!  We'll be making this again soon.

Very,very good.  I used only cream of mushroom soup and added mushrooms. Meat was tasty and moist, yet firm. I used only cooking spray in skillet, and did not dredge the meat in flour.  i'll make this again!  Kitchen Witch

This was very good!  Even my pickiest eater liked it, and everyone asked me to make it again.  If you have one of the new slow cookers (the ones that run hot), you probably don't need 5 hours in the slow cooker.  Mine were done in about 3 hours.  It also makes a huge batch - cutting in in half would have fed my family of 5.  

The only reason I'm taking a star off this recipe is that it's very salty.  I made some adjustments after reading the review, but it was still pretty salty.  Next time, I'll probably use low sodium soups, and low sodium beef broth in place of the au jus mix.

My family loved this. I did cook it on top of the stove for times sake.
I only gave it 4 stars since I did follow some of the changes others made. I added some worchestershire sauce and used cream of mushroom soup. Everyone said that they would eat more but were too full.
Definitely on the meal rotation. Oh I also, didn't use the oil or flour.
My daughter can't have very much fat due to gall bladder issues and with the changes she had no problems.

We very much enjoyed this.My daughter said it smelled like Ikea meatballs, which gave me the idea to use lingonberry sauce in it (or could use cranberry sauce)which gave it a nice tangy taste if you like that sort of thing. (Use to taste start with a little and see how you like it)
I know some people don't like it when food alterations are posted, however I always like it when I find some changes or substitutions as it give me ideas sometimes I make it exactly as show and sometimes I venture out a little bit. 
Thank you for posting this recipe without this post I would have never have thought of making this to begin with. Now I have a keeper that my 18 year old loves.

I've made this recipe only 3 times in the past year . . . because if I made it more often, I'd be the size of a small whale!  Followed the recipe as written, no subs, and it is excellent.  I could eat half of it myself.  Just call me Salisbury Chubby!  Thank you, Tesslynn.

Too salty for my taste, will be making my own onion soup mix from now on. Kids liked it-said it tasted just like school-not sure if that's a good thing, but would make again.

I made this recipe as written and my family of 5 all enjoyed it! I gave it 4 stars only because it is a little too salty alone but with mashed potatoes it's perfect.  The gravy did not have a chicken flavor from the cream of chicken soup about which other reviewers had been concerned.  I will definitely make it again.

This was fantastic!  I cut the recipe in half for the first try and oh what a mistake.  Four patties for 3 people . . . My adult son and husband were a little perturbed with me since there wasn't enough for seconds.  Give this a try!

My husband loved this! The plan was to cook exactly by the recipe but due to time and ingredient availability I ended up changing it a bit. As per other reviews, I used cr. of mushroom instead of cr. of chicken because that's what I had on hand. I also could not find the au jus mix (I may not have known where to look) so I used brown gravy mix exactly as it said to use the au jus mix. All other ingredients stayed the same. I made this for 4 instead of 8 and due to forgetting to put it in the crock pot, I ended up cooking it in a skillet. Things just don't always go as planned. It tasted great and was easy enough to make. I'm making it again tonight and I think the only thing I will change is crunching up the onion soup mix so it's a bit finer. I wasn't a fan of crunching into the dried onion bits in my meat. The flavor was good, I just didn't like the texture. Loved how tender it turned out and both my 2 year old and husband ate every bit. Definitely recommend trying this recipe. (even if I didn't follow it exactly)

I cooked sliced mushrooms and chopped onions in the residual fat from the meat drippings and added to the crock pot. I used 1 can of soup instead of 2 and it was delicious!

I made this for dinner tonight and was so impressed! It was so good.  I figured it was going to be with all the great reviews.  I loved how super easy it was.  I followed the recipe but went with other reviews and did cream of mushroom soup ( reduced sodium) and added fresh mushrooms.  I will defiantly be making again.  Lots left over so going to freeze it and have another time!

Made this for the first time this evening and the entire family enjoyed it! Very easy to make. Because my Crockpot seems to run "hot", even on it's lowest setting, I had to add some flour to "thicken" the gravy after I removed the meat from the Crockpot. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

I loved this recipe! It was easy and tasty! I agree it was a little on the salty side. Maybe add a small potato to soak up the salt.

So yummy! Did exactly as recipe called and family of boys loved. Au Jus mix gave it a wonderful tasting gravy. Mashed potatoes are a must. If contimplating, just try. You won't be disappointed!

I've been wanting to make this for quite a while, but couldn't find an au jus gravy packet at the grocery yesterday, so was forced to get the bottled au jus and a packet of slow cooker pot roast. I added minced onions and worcestershire. This is just a terrific dinner. Sour creamy mashed potatoes and corn finished this dish. mmmmmm!!!

i gave this 5 stars, but i changed it quite a bit.  i was only cooking for two (one being a toddler), so reduced amts quite a bit.  i was also concerned about prev reviews saying it was too salty.  I didn't have enough time for the slow cooker, so excited about a prev reviewer's comment that an electric skillet worked, i went with that idea.  here's what i did:  used 1/2 lb gr turkey & did step 1.  then, right into the pan the meat was in, i added thin chunks red potato, carrot, celery.  i let that cook a bit.  added maybe a cup of crm of mushroom soup, 1/4 cup water, and about a tsp of au jus base.  i simmered that for awhile till the veggies were close to done, added some canned peas and froz corn  (though i steamed the corn in the microwave first).  let it cook for a bit.  i served with homemade red skinned mashed potatoes.  absolutely divine!  not salty at all.. sorry i didn't list how much of everything i used, that's what kind of cook i am: i frequently have to reduce amts, so i just add as much/little as it needs.  you could do whatever you wanted with this!

Made this for my family tonight for the first time.  Went over very well.  I didn't realize until it was cooking in the slow cooker already that I had forgotten the milk when mixing the meat.  Didn't seem to make a difference in taste, I just thought the patties were a bit dry, but my husband and son didn't think they were dry at all.  We served it over a bit of brown rice with a spinach salad on the side.  I will definitely make this again and I am marking the recipe as a "favorite".

Delicous! I couldn't find the au jus mix at my local market so I used brown gravy mix instead. Also chose to use cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken. Just sounded more of a fit. I added a small can of mushrooms and used the beefy onion soup mix. This was delicious!! Will be a regular, not too salty as others had said.

Another beauty crockpot recipe that I have made many times.  It is so warm and comforting.  I have served it with broad noodles and rice as well as mashed pots.  I now keep the dry AuJus mix on hand because it is quick to throw together in the morning.  Success also with mushroom soup as well as chicken.  The gravy is terrific and I always double it so we have lots!

This is an awesome recipe for someone who is looking for a hearty meal that is fast and easy! It has become a family favorite for sure! As some other reviewers mentioned, it might be a bit salty for some people's liking, but I served it with rice and it really cut back how salty it tasted. 

I made  a few minor modifications that I think really help to make this recipe awesome: 
- I used bisquick instead of flower to coat the burgers.
-Instead of 2 cans of cream of chicken I did one can of the cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. 
- Added sliced mushrooms, 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 of a large onion cut into slivers into the gravy mixture. 

With these few modifications, it comes out perfectly to my likely for hamburger steak! Hope you all enjoy!

This recipe is awesome!!!  I made this last night for dinner and my family loved it.  It was easy and I followed it exactly, only cooking in slow cooker for 4 hours on low, and it turned out perfectly.  The gravy was perfect over home made mashed potatoes.  Served with green beans and garlic buttered french bread.  I will serve this again and again.

My husband, 11 year old & mom gave it 4 stars, so I say it was a success. I wasn't as thrilled with it. Next time I would add a bunch of black pepper, maybe some worchesire sauce. Not sure. I thought the gravy was a little blah, however, the boys ranked it higher then most meals.

my husband loved the flavor here!  next time i will be making the following changes: 1) 1 lb. hamburger + 1 med. onion + 1/4 cup bread crumbs + 1/4 cup flour mixed together and browned.  2) To save on some fat and salt, i will be omitting the onion soup mix and vegetable oil.  3) the gravy will be unchanged, as we all loved it: 1 package fresh mushrooms browned in hamburger drippings, 2 cans condensed cream of chicken, 1 oz. dry au jus mix, and 3/4 cup water.  4)  the patties were good but an unneccessary step, so to save time i won't be pattying.  then after thoroughly browning the hamburger and putting the gravy together, the slowcooker is unneccessary.  Simply pour over potatoes and enjoy!

I made this recipe for the first time tonight and my husband and I loved it! I didn't change anything from the recipe, only cooked it on high in the crock pot for the first 45 minutes to an hour then let it go on low for about 3 hours. Very easy to put together and I served it with white rice and a veggie. The clean up is a breeze. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a hearty and comforting meal!

Fantastic!  My super picky husband even loved it and is requesting again and again!  Thanks for this recipe!  (As other reviewers suggested, I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken.)

I made a few changes, but it was fabulous, so I have to share! I couldnt find dry au jus @ my local store so I used dry beefy onion soup mix.  I couldnt get myself to use crm of ckn soup, so I used cream of mushroom instead with an equal amount of beef gravy.  Also sliced up about 10oz of fresh mushrooms. AMAZING!  I will never buy pre-made salisbury steaks again!

This had great flavor! The only change I made was I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can for cream of chicken. I also added fresh mushrooms but that was only because I had some in the fridge that needed to be used. I think the next time I will try and mix in some ground turkey with the ground beef to cut back on the fat.

This was pretty good.  I followed a few of the suggestions and used cream of mushroom soup which I like better.  I also added some sliced mushrooms to the mix and they came out delicious.  The meat was a little bland and kinda just tasted like hamburger but the gravy made up for it.  I served it with mashed potatoes and my husband and I really enjoyed it.

This was an easy, delicious dinner.  I actually made it slightly different because I just didn't feel like preparing it in the morning for the slow cooker.  I used my pressure cooker!  I followed the recipe up until it was time to add the soup and au jus.  I layered them in a pyramid in the pressure cooker, mixed 2 cans of cream of mushroom and 1 cup of beef broth together, and poured it over the beef patties.  Set the pressure cooker to high and cooked for 10 mintues, followed by a quick release.  Served over egg noodles with the sauce.  Kids and husband ate it up.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The first time I made it it was very salty...The second time I used Healthy Choice Campbells soup, omitted the au jus & water and used the equivelant amount of beef broth and WOW! I think most of the salt was from the au jus mix. Definately one of my favorite recipes!

Excellent. I only changed the recipe a little by adding a cup of chopped onion. Make sure to let it cool a bit before eating so the sauce thickens. Even better the next day.

This recipe was great by far for my family of very picky eaters. Three of my six children don't like anything ground beef and they were asking for seconds. I used cream of mushroom soup in place of the cream of chicken and now it's part of our regular menu.

Surprisingly good - I improvised a little...added 1 clove garlic; used cream of mushroom and cream of celery soup and packet of hunter sauce mix because it's what I had on hand. I will make this again.

This was great!  Did a few changes.  Cooked in my electric skillet instead of the crock pot.  I used ground turkey;added 2 eggs to make sure the paddies would hold together; used an off-brand onion soup mix (lower sodium) than Lipton's brand.  I also used golden mushroom soup (low sodium) and Heinz brown mushroom gravy.  After browning the paddies, I sauteed a sweet onion in drippings.  Simmered all in the electric skillet for 45 min. to an hour.  It dish was a huge hit!  Served with garlic roasted potatoes, french style green beans and corn bread muffins.

Easy and delicious!!!!  I modified this slightly.  I used one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of golden mushroom soup.  I also added one can of sliced mushrooms and 1 small diced onion, which I sauteed in the pan with a little more oil after I browned the meat.  This is a great meal that can be served to company!

I made this for the first time to serve to my brother and sister-in-law on their first visit to our new home.  They raved about it!  It was truly delicious; the gravy was wonderful over the mashed potatoes.  I even forgot to flour the patties before I browned them and they still kept their shape in the slow cooker.  I will make this again and again. Marge Kearney

I did this one up for our potluck/rehersal dinner.  To cut the salt I used low sodium soup mix and 3/4c of low sodium beef stock.  It was perfect.

I didn't care for this-I followed others tips, using Cream Of Mushroom soup, adding some sliced mushrooms and onion....the gravy was excellent, but the "salisbury steaks" just tasted like hamburgers submerged in gravy.

I was disapointed in this recipe. My husband is a hamburger fanatic....anything with hamburger and he usually LOVES it.  He took one bite and frowned and tried one more for good measure.  He would not eat anymore.  I ate mine, but sure wasn't thrilled.  So, I was left with 6 patties of not very good hamburger steaks.  The gravy, however, was good.  Wouldn't recommend this one to anyone.

Excellent and easy receipe. Everyone loved it and asked for more! I only gave it four stars because my 8 yr old said it didn't really taste like the Banquet Salisbury Steak, but he said it was still good!

This was pretty danged good, the only problem is I didnt have lean beef on hand so I used 73/23 beef and it came out pretty greasy.  I took the sausce and put in a bowl and put in the freezer for a few minutes and the grease firmed up enough to scoop it out, the heated the sauce in the microwave the poured back in with the meat.   So be sure to use lean beef.

So good! I followed the advice of another review and cooked it in a skillet to save time. Also added carmelized onions and mushrooms.

This is the first salisbury steak recipe I've tried that actually tastes...well, like salisbury steak! Next time I make it I will definitely use low-sodium soup and add mushrooms, as the original recipe was too salty for my taste. Yum!

I too had a problem with this meal being way too salty, but that might be because I had to sub 1 can of golden mushroom soup (I've never used it before so I don't know if it's generally salty).  I don't normally mind some salt but this was too much for even me.  I did like the meat patties though, those came out like I would expect of Salisbury Steak, so I will try again and not stray from the original recipe and then re-rate if I get different results.  I also tried the 1/4 of red wine, didn't care for it, so will leave that out next time too (didn't factor that into my rating).  Oh, I tried the trick with the peeled, quartered potato to absorb some of the saltiness, it worked... at least it wasn't AS salty after it sat in there a while.

Wow, this is a great and simple recipe. The only thing I did different was I could not find packets of dry au jus mix so I used a can of au jus and eliminated the water and it turned out great.   The cream of chicken soup worked well and it tasted like restaurant quality Salisbury steak.  The liquid made excellent gravy and tasted fantastic on the mashed potatoes I served with the meal.   Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Extremely good! I will be putting this into my regular meal rotation! Only changes I made were doing one can of the cream of chicken soup and for the other I used cream of mushrom. I also just used garlic and herb breadcrumbs because thats what I had on hand. Soooooo....Good! This time I served it with noodles but next time I definitely will go with mashed potatoes with that gravy!

Very good!  Reminded me of the salisbury steak that my grandma used to make!  All of my kids really liked it.  Served it over egg noodles.  I did add only one can of the cream of chicken soup and then added golden mushroom.

We really like this. Have made it many times and shared with others who have as well. The only criticism is that it is kind of salty so don't add any.

DELICIOUS!! I followed a few other reviews and used 1 can cream mushroom & 1 can golden mushroom soup. Also, browned in electric skillet, added rest of ingredients and cooked in same skillet on low/simmer temp for almost 4 hours. This is a seriously good recipe. Thank you.

Easy and good.  The only changes I made were to use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and to leave out the au jus because I didn't have any.  Also, lean ground beef is key.

It was ok.  More like personal size meatloafs.  Just didn't have that salisbury steak flavor I was hoping for.  The gravy was excellent and it cooked nicely in the crock pot.

this is a great recipe which I have made numerous times.  It's one of those my family asks for.  I have made a couple of changes for us though, over the past few months.  I took out the bread crumbs but use an italian seasoning mix added to almond flour (this makes it have fewer carbs).  Sometimes I use cream of mushroom soup rather than cream of chicken...it's always a great meal.  Thanks for this recipe!!

Came out great, the meat was not dry at all. I followed the others and added sauteed baby bella mushrooms for the last half hour. Also, I used 2 cans of reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup and served it with egg noodles. This will definitely be an add on to our weeknight supper menu.

This turned out excellent! I have a carnivore for a husband and two small children and this was a hit. I used the two cans of cream of mushroom low sodium, and I used beefy onion soup mix for the onion soup mix and the aus ju mix. I added 1 cup of water instead of 3/4. Then added 1/2 a chopped fresh onion on the top. This was easy and we will make it again!

This recipe is great. Very quick prep time to get into crockpot. I didn't change anything about the recipe and my family just gobbles them up. Serve with mash potatoes or egg noodles. Delicious!

Love this recipe!!  I did, however sdd 2 grated cloves of garlic and a few dashes of worcheshire sauce to the soup mixture.  Instead of the Au Jus mix and water I substituted chicken broth (what I had on hand).  Great tasting and very easy.  Will definitely be in the monthly rotation!

It was decent.  Although my girls (ages 12 & 6) tried it neither cared for this recipe.  My hubby & I thought is was pretty good.  I am having the leftovers today as I don't like to throw out food.  I probably won't make again.

Very easy to make.  Put in the slow cooker in the morning and done when I get off work.  Tasted great...had mashed potatoes and peas to top it off.  Great meal for everyone to enjoy.

My family loved this.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and added a can of mushrooms as well. Very easy and very good.  My daughter said it was her new fav meal.

I had to add more bread crumbs and milk to make the patties what they needed to be. This could of had something to do with using 70/30 ground beef instead of a leaner one, but hey I'm an el-cheapo. I also omitted the flour and vegetable oil really didn't see a need for it with the type of meat I used. I cooked my patties in the pan a bit longer since they have a fair amount of fat in them. I wasn't sure about the gravy but after 4 hours of cooking with the patties it was quite pleasant. We enjoyed it served over rice. All in all I tweaked it a bit for what I had on hand and will use this method again. Thx for the recipe!!

This was good! I used two cans of reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken. The only thing I will change differently next time is to make the hamburger patties thinner.

Made this yesterday served over mashed taters and green beans as a side. I added my own touches which included sliced onions and mushrooms. I also used cream of mushroom soup and instead of just onion soup I used mushroom/onion dried soup mixed. This is a winner.

Finally another recipe that the whole family likes. I only made one change since some people felt it was a bit salty I didn't add the soup mix and instead added some dried onions I had and it turned out perfect. They all liked the gravy and that's saying alot since I don't have gravy lovers.

This was super easy - but a word of caution. I found it to be super salty as well.  My suggestion would be to use the lowest sodium soup and mix you can find, otherwise it will be way too salty. Other than this, I would have given it 5 stars. I was so amazed at the Salisbury taste and how easy it was.

For a much more simpler meal, I bypassed making the patties myself.  Six frozen 1/4 lb. patties, two cans cream of chicken, one package of dry au jus mix, and water. In the crock pot on low for seven hours. Great salisbury steak. Thank you for the recipe. (I did forget the onion I wanted to put in the bottom of the crock pot)

This was just okay.  My three-year-old loved it and asked for seconds, but I found it way too salty and the flavor reminiscent of a salisbury steak TV dinner.

This recipe is very good!!! I used one pound ground venison and one pound ground beef and it came out very tasty,and the gravy is to die for!! The recipe is pretty much fool proof, you won't be disappointed.

I followed this recipe with the exception of using 2 cans of the reduced fat/sodium cream of chicken soup and adding some sliced sauteed onions.  Our family did not find it too salty at all and we enjoyed the meal very much with some mashed potatoes, green beans and dinner rolls.  I will definitely be making this recipe again in the future.

My 10 year old son who deems himself a Salisbury steak expert asked me never make this recipe again. He rated it two stars for flavor and one star for "after effects." Even with reduced sodium soup the recipe remains too salty.  In addition, the meat takes on an odd flavor, in my opinion.

Very good! I only used one can of the cream of chicken soup because I thought it might be too much chicken flavor, but I didn't have enough gravy. Next time I think I will use 2 cans, but use 2 packets of the au jus. Very moist and flavorful patties. My husband said it was not like Salisbury Steak- but he really liked it!

This was very easy to make. Family was skeptical to eat it (i.e. anticipated lack of flavour) however, turned out fantastic. Was so good, they went back for seconds and demanded that there be enough for leftovers for lunch the following day. Instead of Cream of Chicken soup, I substituted Cream of Mushroom soup along with one can of stems and pieces mushrooms and one can of sliced mushrooms. Made garlic mashed potatoes and French-style green beans. Now this is a dish the family wants at least every week, if not two weeks. We have a winner here..(cooked best on Low...IMHO).

Very tasty!  I liked the meat mixture.  I used low sodium soup, only 1/2 package of the au jus mix and added some kitchen bouquet to make the gravy look darker.  I also added quartered potatoes and cooked on top of the stove covered for about an hour & a half.  Easy to make and the leftovers are great!  This isn't a real salisbury steak recipe to me but an excellent recipe for something different.  Will make again.

Hmmm. This was good, just not great (or what I am looking for in a salisbury steak recipe). It is sure easy to prepare though.... I think I like salisbury steak by Kelly Berenger a little better and will stick with that recipe when the craving calls. I like the fact that this recipe takes advantage of the slow cooker (I LOVE using mine!). Kelly's recipe uses the stovetop, but I like her gravy recipe better (it is tangy - which I prefer over savory). Perhaps I could combine the two? Instead of using cream of chicken soup/au jus mix, I could prepare the gravy from Kelly's recipe, but make the patties as directed here and cook in the sc??? Overall, good, just not "tickle my taste buds good." Served with mashed potatoes, peas, crescent rolls and the rest of the gravy to drizzle over the meat and potatoes (yum-o). One note: be sure to use LEAN beef! I used ground chuck (I bought a 5 lb. tube of it b/c it was on sale - being jobless, I am pinching pennies right now...). I had to use my turkey baster to remove a LOT of grease, but luckily it was easy to do since the oil separated and rose to the top. It was time consuming though and not recommended if you can afford the leaner stuff! Thanks for sharing, TESSLYNN :)

I prefer my stove top recipe to this one.  However this makes dinner easy on a busy day.

I thought this was a great 'base' recipe- I used it as a guide- because I wanted salisbury steak- but had what I had in the kitchen- lol.  I used ground turkey- and a can of french onion soup instead of the packet (I didn't have the packet)- and extra bread crumbs to absorb the extra soup- mixed that all together for the patties- and added some leftover fresh mushrooms that neeeded to be used.  Then I put them in the slow cooker- and mixed a can of mushroom soup with a jar of beef gravy and poured it over the top and went away.  I served this over mashed potatoes and it was DELICIOUS!  Fabulous comfort food!!!

The salisbury steak was phenomenal!!!!!  I made some substitutions in the recipe due to food allergies in the family, but it sure did not impact the great flavor of these steaks.  I will definitely make again because my husband is a meat and potatoes type guy.  These really hit the spot.  Thanks for sharing.

An excellent dish!  I read all the reviews and tweaked this one to perfection.  You must use the leanest ground beef available.  To decrease the salty flavor I first sprayed my roaster/crockpot with PAM then covered the bottom with thin potatoe slices.  I used lower sodium cream of mushroom 1 can and cream of chicken 1 can in the sauce mixture.  When blending the ground beef with the dry ingredients you need to use your hands and "over blend" until the mixture no longer looks like ground beef but beef "paste".  The rest of the recipe was as written and it could not have been more delicious.  This one is definitely going into my rotation.  Thank you so much for this post.

Great! So that the dish would not be too salty, I followed the advice of others and used 1/2 pkg. of the onion soup mix, cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken soup and brown gravy mix instead of au jus mix. The leaner the ground beef the better. Will make again.

I have cooked this several times, it's one of my favorites.  The first time I did find the gravy to be a bit salty, so the subsequent times I made it I cut the au jus powder I added in half.  I don't think the soups are making the recipe too salty, I think the au jus packet is the culpret.  This recipe tastes good to me no matter what soup I use, currently it's cooking with one can of cream of mushroom and one cream of chicken.  My whole family loves this recipe, even my picky kids.  Great comfort food!  I do add a bunch of baby carrots to the bottom of my crock to add a vegetable to my meal.  Turns out great!

Very easy and TASTY.  My 3 yr old granddaughter had a blast helping me find the ingredients at the grocery and helping combine all the ingredients and form the patties.  Her new favorite word is au jus!

This was wonderful. I did use the cream of mushroom rather than cream of chicken, and I cooked it in my electric skillet, it only took about 20 min.  I would make more gravy next time.  Also, I mixed my flour in with the burger instead of dredging in flour and it turned out great. Can't wait to have it again.

This recipe was very easy and tasty.  I am only giving it 4 stars due to the fact that it was way too salty for our taste.  I used the cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken as suggested.  And served over egg noodles.  I would sugesst doubling the gravy though.  I'll be making this again, but maybe cutting the onion soup mix in half.

Very good.  For personal preferences only, I added minced onion and garlic powder to the patties and dredged them in flour before browning.  It is a good idea to double the gravy if your family likes it as much as mine.

Excellent!  I did add some onions.  I couldn't find au jus mix, so in place of that I omitted the water and added beef broth.  I didn't have two cans of cream of chicken, only one, so I did one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom.  This was excellent served with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.

I won't be using this recipe again. I did not care for the taste of the seasonings in the meat nor the creamy soup gravy. I thought this dish was more like a stroganoff and I don't care for that type of dish. Additionally, I felt the combination of ingredients gave an "aftertaste" I didn't like.

I really liked this but only gave 4 stars because I made it as is and I thought it was a bit salty. Next time I will still follow the recipe but will use lower sodium soup mixes to cut the saltiness. Also, I would have liked more gravy so I may add a little more water. Good dinner to have waiting when you get home from work though!

Excellent! I made very few changes. I used 2 can cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken soup, added fresh mushrooms and a splash of red wine. Also, for those complaining about the salt, don't use Lipton Onion Soup Mix (for this or any other recipe). It is way too salty. Campbells or the store brand onion soups are much less salty and just as good.

I gave this 4 stars because it was salty. I read the reviews so I was tasting as I went along. I added the Au Jus mix and 1 can of cream of mushroom because it sounded better. I let it cook for about 2 hours and tasted the gravy and found it to be VERY salty. So I added some basic beef stock and garlic powder and let it cook. I tasted it again and found it to be lacking a little something so I added some Kitchen Boquet, It then tasted more like I wanted. After it was all said and done I found the meat to be tender and juicy and the gravy was good served with mashed potatoes.

I was not overly impressed with this recipe. I put my picture on line. I used fresh mushrooms and added just a little more water maybe half to a whole cup for extra broth and added a beef boullion. I thought that it looked great but the taste just wasnt there. I will be trying this recipe again with other ground meats like a ground brisket or something, I just dont think hamburger is the right meat for this recipe

I made this for the first time today and it was delicious.  I did change the recipe a little--I couldn't find powdered au jus, so subbed a 2ish oz packet of brown gravy mix.  I added 2 cans of water (the can from the condensed, and low-sodium! soup) to make more gravy and it turned out wonderful.  I must say that the 15 min prep time is a little optimistic--to really brown the patties in the skillet alone takes more time than that.

This was very good.  I have to agree with other reviewers that this was salty.  My DW never noticed.  Low sodium soups next time.  I used one can cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom.  I also used 1 lbs of ground beef and adjusted the breadcrumbs, soup mix and milk since there are just 2 of us.  The gravy is very good with mashed potatoes.

I loved this recipe. I didnt feel like waiting on it in the slowcooker, so I browned the meat on both side in the skillet,then I placed it on a cookie sheet in the oven on 375 for 20 min.  In the skillet where I browned my meat, I added the can cream and chicken, and broth (instead of packet dry au jus mix & water) and simmered until meat was cooked.  Then I placed the meat back in the skillet to get it covered in the gravy.  I served with green beans and rotini noodles.  Only thing I suggest is doubling the sauce.  Awesome recipe.

this recipe was indeed simple and a big hit with the family. however, i agree with several other reviewers that it was a bit too salty. i couldn't eat the gravy on my second helping. so i suggest doing whatever you can to reduce the saltiness. others have suggested cutting the au jus, onion soup mix and bread crumb portions in half. also, i used low sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.

This receipe was delicious.  I had to improvise a little since I did not have all the ingredients and really wanted to make it.  Instead of the onion soup mix, I used minced onion and put it in the food processor with seasoned bread cubes (did not have seasoned bread crumbs)and ground it up real fine like bread crumbs.  I also used a package of brown gravey mix...did not have the au jus mix.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken and a can of chicken broth...some in the meatball mixture and some in the "gravy" mixture.  Used large fresh mushrooms in between the layers of the patties so the patties would be separated. It turned out wonderful!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Delish!!  I used the recipe exactly except subbed brown gravy for the au jus because that is what has the high salt content.  I even made extra gravy for later.  One of my favorite meals!

Very good! This was my first crock pot meal I made. I cut in half becuase it is just me and my bf and I have a small pot . I used cream of mushroom soup and added a little more breadcrumbs and cooked on high. It was a tad salty. The gravy had to be mixed a couple times in the crock pot because it was seperating and had a little to much fat. Next time I'll use a lower fat soup mix. Boyfriend said it was very good and I liked it a lot.

Unbelievable!  I got moans and groans from the minute "Salisbury Steak" appeared on the weeks menu...but they all loved it and agreed they hope we have it again.  I took the tip from another reviewer and added a package of baby portabello mushrooms...excellent.  Only reason its not a 5 is it was a tad on the salty side for me.

This was a pretty good recipe, but I would agree with other reviewers, it was waaaaayyy to salty. I used low fat, low sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and it still didn't help. It was too salty from the onion soup mix. I think next time I will cut the amount in half. I also added fresh mushrooms. Otherwise it was pretty tasty.

I though this was awesome but I did have to change a few things. I did not have the dry packet of au jus but I did have the concentrate, so I replaced the milk for that. Instead of using cream of chick I used golden mushroom soup. It turned out SO good, I could have drank that gravy it made :-D

This is just really yummy. The steaks are tender and not too salty in my opinion. I didn't have cream o chicken, so I used 1 can cream o mushroom and 1 can cream o celery (both fat free). I used a fattier 80% lean ground beef cause it's all I had and it turned out great. I'm sure w/ the leaner meat it would be even better! Made nice gravy too! Will definitely make again!

the steak was really tender but i thought it was waaaaaaay too salty when combined with the gravy. my boyfriend didn't mind it too much (that's why i'm giving it a 4 star rating) but i found it a little hard to swallow. i think i'm going to use low sodium cream soups next time and also add a chopped onion to the meat mixture to help tone down the saltiness and further increase the tenderness.

This is an excellent recipe! Simple, easy and delicious. Followed recipe exactly, except that I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.I cooked on low for 4 hours and it was ready....(my slow cooker is hot)The only thing I'll do differently next time is that I'll add some fresh sliced mushrooms. I served this with Country Crock Loaded Mashed Potatoes and my BF just loved it!Thanks for the recipe.

This was phenominal!! My husband and 1 year old gobbled it up. It can cooked on the stove-top, just as easily as the crockpot. It also freezes wonderfully. As other posters stated, I used brown gravy and cream of mushroom soup. Will use more soup in the future as my husband LOVED the gravy it made.

This is very good and "a keeper" according to my husband who loves comfort food.  I cut the recipe in half as I was cooking for two, I browned the patties in a cast iron deep sided skillet, and left them there to simmer in the gravy on the stovetop while I prepared mashed potatoes to serve w/ the steaks.  It worked perfectly on the stovetop.  The recipe is a little on the salty side for me, but my husband thought it was fine.  I will be making this again with low sodium ingredients.

This was fantastic!  I made the following changes:
 Swapped au jus concentrate for milk for a beefier flavor in the beef mix.
 Instead of dry au jus, swapped a beef gravy packet in the sauce.
  Added a can of sliced mushrooms and used mushroom soup.

This was delicious.  This is a perfect fall day dinner!

LOVE IT!!   My 8 year old son even took it for his lunch at school the next day.  The only changes I did were to use cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, simply because that is what I had, & I got 10 patties instead of 8.  For sure will do this one again.

OMG!!!  This is the BEST recipe I've ever had for Salisbury Steaks...so tender, so juicy, so delicious.  My daughter LOVED them.  She even said I should cook for the President!!!  LOL!!!  Give this recipe a try. Just the aroma will make your mouth water.  I've never had this combo of gravy the way this was made, but I must say, it was absolutely wonderful.  This will definitely be a regular in our home.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!!!

We loved this recipe.  I followed it precisely with the exception of a couple of changes.  I didn't use the full envelope of onion soup mix, instead I used 1/2 an envelope of Garlic Herb mix & I also added a package of sliced fresh mushrooms.  DELICIOUS!

Yummy!!!I did use the low sodium cream of mushroom soup ,did cut 4 potatoes, and sliced a onion around the meat as sugessted.Four of the patties went into the freezer for another meal which would be good over egg noodles for that's what the kids like. Definately will make this again.

This was so easy, and my whole family loved it.  Instead of ground beef, we used ground turkey.  It still tasted fabulous.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks!

I made this for the first time for the kids' dinner, as I was going out to dinner with the wife.  However, after I had taken a taste of the salisbury steak, along with some of the rice topped with the gravy, I didn't want to go out for dinner.  I didn't have a choice though, since it was pretty much all gone.  I will definitely make again.

This was very easy to make.  I used two cans of Cream of Mushroom soup instead of the Cream of Chicken soup. This recipe is a keeper.  My whole family enjoyed it.

My family loved this recipe.  I used low sodium soup as others suggested and it turned out wonderful.  Next time I think I will try to make it with turkey burger instead of beef.  Just to make it a little more healthy.  Great gravy with it.

This is the best salisbury steak recipe ever!!  My husband and my little girl loved it.  I am going to try the base meat recipe and make meatballs out of it, saute them and put them in the slow cooker with spaghetti sauce.  I'm sure it will be wonderful!  Thank you for sharing!

My family loved this. Perfect comfort food with a side of mashed potatoes. After reading reviews i made a few changes. I used onion salt instead of onion soup mix to control the saltiness i read about. I also used cream of mushroom (low sodium) and brown gravy mix as others suggest. Very easy...Family Favorite! Thank you.

This rates high on the comfort food scale.  The family really loved it. 
It was just a tad bit salty so I will substitute one of the cans of soup with a low sodium variety next time.  I only had one can of cream of chicken soup so I used one can of cream of mushroom soup with it. I also added some Worcestershire sauce to the meat for more flavor.

This meat turned out very tender and juicy.  I didn't have any au jus, so I used a packet of brown gravy.  My husband absolutely thought it was delicious.  Will definitely make it again.

Love it! My husband is as picky as a five year old, and he now wants me to make this as often as I can stand it! 
- One change: I replaced the onion soup mix with some salt, pepper, garlic salt and about a third of an onion, chopped. I also just noticed this recipe says 2 cans of soup - and I only added one on accident - it tasted just fine without the 2nd can!

This is really good & really easy.  I did use one can cream of mushroom soup & one can cream of chicken with herbs & it was delicious.  I may add some sliced mushrooms next time.  Also, this is a bit salty, so I recommend using at least one can of reduced sodium soup.  I will definitely me making this again.  It's a down home cooking/comfort food.

This was really really good. I took the hint from another poster and added carrots and potatoes to the bottom of the pot. I only had 1 lb of ground beef so I halved that part of the recipe but made the normal amount of the sauce and added some extra water.  Will be making this again.

It was ok. It was lacking something to make it great. I used healthy choice soups for less sodium but you couldn't tell. There was still plenty of salt.

I've made this twice. Once with Ground Turkey, and the second with Ground Beef.  My picky husband liked it. I thought it was a bit bland and was missing kick to it.

Doubled the gravy and used cream of mushroom soup mix instead of chicken.  Was a huge hit!  Thanks for sharing!

This was so good and easy! I followed the recipe except I substituted ground turkey and my dad and husband couldn't even tell. I also only used 1 lb of meat but the same amount of gravy called for in the recipe, so definitely double the gravy if you are using 2 lbs of meat and want some for potatoes!

These were really good. I can see how people think they are too salty. Make sure you taste them before adding any salt to your plate. The gravy was great. I will be making again.

Really liked this - hubby said to keep recipe. I used the low sodium soup and the salt amount was fine. On atkins so I omitted using the flour to cut down on some of the carbs.

I attempted to make this recipe, but found out the hard way that my slow cooker was broken. So, I had to heat it in a skillet last minute. The only other changes I made were: I used plain bread crumbs because of the other reviewers comments about how salty it was tasting, and I used brown gravy mix in the place of au jus ( just for personal preference ). I really thought the flavor was good and will use this recipe if I make Salisbury steak again.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I took the advice of other users and modified my recipe. I used 2 cans cream of mushroom (low sodium) and used brown gravy mix instead of the au jus. My family loved it! This one will definately be a keeper.

I tried it with ground turkey and thought it might taste better with ground beef.  It was salty so I would use low sodium chicken soup instead.  It was tasty though.

Very nice recipe... however, it is quite salty, so be careful if you are sensitive to that.  We love it, the gravy is flavorful.  Works well with white rice if you aren't up for mashed potatoes.  My 1 1/2 year old inhales it.  Thanks so much!

Hubby loved it.  I'm not a big fan but I have to agree that the gravy is to die for.  I made double the gravy and I would make it again to serve with mashed potatoes - great for someone like me who can't for the life of me make a good gravy!

I came across this recipe when looking for a Salisbury steak recipe for cube steaks. This sounded good so decided to use the gravy part of the recipe with them and I'm glad i did. After browning my cube steaks i put them in the crockpot with the cream of chicken soup mixture.  It's excellent.

More like a 3.5 - family ate it without complaint, but no compliments either.  A bit too salty in spite of using low sodium soup.  Will make rarely if ever.

Instead of slow cooking I pan seared the meat until cooked and made the sauce seperately. Everyone in my family loved it which says alot since my 2 year old is a picky eater!

This was really good. I didn't make it in the crockpot though because my isn't large enough. About the only thing I would change would be maybe a low salt soup because it was on the salty side- for my taste. Everyone loved it!

Soooo good!  I was looking for something quick and easy and this was perfect...it cooked all day and when my sons football practice was done we were ready to eat!  It is definately more of a fall winter food, but really good anytime!  I loved the gravy and may try to double it next time!  I did add mushrooms just for something additional.  I served it with redskinned garlic mashed potatoes (which I thought I got off this site, but now I can't find the recipe), my whole family loved it!  This will definately be a favorite this winter!

Hi, I pick this together this morning for our dinner tonight. About 3 hours  before dinner I put in some peeled potatoes. My husband and I really really enjoyed this meal. I thought the gravy was great. I have made Salisbury Steak before but this recipe had much better flavor. My husband said to make sure I keep this recipe. Thank you. Sincerely, Judy

I also did a few variations to the recipe...I used garlic cream of mushroom, and added onions and mushrooms to the soup when cooking.  It was good, but I think I was just expecting something a little different.  If I make it again, I will use the cream of chicken soup instead...maybe the garlic cream of mushroom soup just messed up the taste.

Very nice taste and texture.  I did make some adjustmenst based on the # of people I was cooking for (2 adults and 1 small child).  I only did 1# of hamburger but added the entire envelope of soup mix but halved the rest of the steak ingredients.  I didn't have cream of chicken on hand so used cream of mushroom soup.  I still added the entire envelope of au jus mix.  I did however, throw in a diced potato to absorb the extra saltiness and also sliced some portabellas and added to the sauce in addition to also adding some minced dried onion.  Quite tasty but my version was still a little salty-will make as stated next time.

Good basic recipe if you like cream of mushroom/onion soup recipes. I added some garlic and fresh ground pepper and a dask of worchestershire sauce to the ground beef mixture.

This was very tasty.  I am sorry to admit that I did not have any cream of chicken soup, so I had to use cream of celery soup.  It was still good though!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!:)

This was pretty good. The thing I've noticed is that most recipes with canned soup tend to taste alike. Husband liked it. It probably is five stars but I'm trying to get away from the canned soup flavor.

If you are looking for the best Salisbury steak recipe, this is ABSOLUTELY IT!!!  So good, sooo easy to make.  And very easy to adjust fat content by using 95% lean beef, 1% or skim milk, and one can of low fat cream of chicken and one regular instead of 2 regular.  Have made it at least 10 times.  Me and my family LOVE this recipe!!

I used low sodium beef broth in place of the dry au jus mix and instead of the onion soup mix I used veg.
In place of theI Italian seasoned bread 
crumbs i used just plain bread crumbs.I did not use milk in the recipe.this was so good!
I loved it.very delicious.

Great crock pot recipe! Was going to substitute water w/ beef broth but it would have been way too salty. Used 1 can cr. of chicken & 1 can cr. of mushroom. Served w/ baked mac & cheese and roasted asparagus.

This was very good. I used brown gravy mix instead of au jus mix, other than that followed recipe exactly. I served this with mashed potatoes and sweet dinner rolls.

Very good.  The whole family enjoyed.  Very easy to make.  Followed directions to a "T".  We did not think it was salty at all.  Next time I will add mushrooms.  Made with Jo's Rosemary Bread and Skin-on Savory Mashed Potatoes from this site.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this per the recipe, except I doubled the gravy.  Hubby thought it was fine, 11 yr old thought it OK, but the 14 yr old, who inhales anything I place in front of him, thought it too salty and wouldn't eat it.  I felt it was a little salty for my taste, but I ate it.  I think it was the combination of the onion soup mix (which is salty to begin with) and the au jus mix (again salty. Don't think I'll be making this again.

I think its good, and my husband kept saying how good it was with every bite, he just loved it.  I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, and beef broth in place of water.  It cooked from probably close to 8 hours and i swear it didn't look done inside so i stuck the in the microwave for about 4 minutes and they looked better. I will make this again.

This was delicious! I'm like so many other people, whenever I think salisbury steak, I think about the kind in your grocer's freezer. And I would NEVER order this out in a restaurant! I used low sodium cream of mushroom soup. That is the only change I made. The meat was very tasty, and the sauce excellent. And it is great with mashed potatoes.

If you like to use a slow cooker and you want an easy, delicious meal, this is the recipe for you. My entire family loved it. It just took minutes to prepare and the meat is juicy and flavorful. This recipe is a usual at our house.

This recipe is great... very easy and fast in the a.m. before work!  Make sure you use very lean beef...like gound sirloin, or extra lean Gound beef...otherwise gravy gets greasy.  Try it, you'll like it...

I've made this a few times.  My family loves it and the gravy is great over noodles or mashed potatoes.  I add in sliced mushrooms with mine.  Also, make sure you use lean ground beef - I just grabbed what I had in the freezer and it did get a bit too greasy the first time I made it.  Live and learn!

I thought that the sauce this made was fine, not too salty, but the meat was extremely salty. I only had 1 1/2 pounds of hamburger, so perhaps that is why. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will either use more meat or less onion soup mix. It would probably work to use regular breadcrumbs instead of the seasoned ones and just add in some spices (just no salt).

Good flavor. My only concern was that the meat was still pink. I did cook for the recommended time period. Maybe my patties were too thick?? I will make again, I just plan to cook a little longer.

I made this last week and my husband ohh and ahhed over it.  I thought it was ok (but I am not a huge fan of ground meat) and it made a huge amount for the two of us.  I don't have a crock pot so I just cooked it on 200 for a few hours in a pot.  I served with mashed potatoes and the gravy was very good.

I love the convenience of this ~ and the meat was nice and tender. I used one can of low sodium cream of chicken soup and one can of regular cream of chicken and mushroom because that is all I had. It was pretty salty, but tolerable.  I served it with hot bread, mashed potatoes, and mixed vegetables. I don't know if I'll fix it again or not... only one kid out of three liked it. I liked it but husband hated it. He's so picky though ~ he doesn't count!! :-)

This recipe was awesome! I have some very picky children who loved this. I added the extra water like others had suggested, however the next time I make it I will not. I did not find it too salty(and I do not like meals salty!). I would prefer to have the gravy a little thicker so I think I would stay with the recommended amount of water that the recipe calls for.
