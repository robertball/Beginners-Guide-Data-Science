I made this last night and it was delicious !  It went very well with the broiled tilapia parmesan from allrecipes.com.  The only changes I made were to add a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper and also to put in a bit more  garlic and red pepper flakes than the recipe calls for.  Definitely a quick, easy, healthy side dish.  Will make again for sure!

Given that it's that time of year, I was able to use my garden fresh tomatoes rather than the canned (not that  there's anything sub-par about canned tomatoes).  And in keeping with the 'Tuscan' in the recipes's name, I chose to use fresh Italian parsley instead of cilantro and an imported Ricotta Salata for the feta. Just a few ingredients, but of good quality. Simple preparation, ready to serve in minutes and delicious.  My kind of dish.

The only recipe change I made was to use fresh tomatoes instead of canned. I let the simmered mixture cool before adding the feta and cilantro. This was a light but really filling lunch (had it with a slice of crusty bread). Thanks,  ScooterMom!

I finally got around to making this; have had the recipe stored away for a long time.  I'm glad I fixed it because it is really, really good.  I'm not real sure how I want to eat this; as a side, over pasta, or main dish.  I noticed that one reviewer had eaten it cold as a salad but I would think the beans would make it too starchy.  Anyway, it's delicious!

Very good light side dish for summer time.  It reminds me a lot of the restaurant dish at Houlihann's.  I made it without the feta and used cayenne pepper instead of red peppper flakes, and I enjoyed it very much.  Love the spice with the freshness of the cilantro!

I ate this two ways -- once as a warm dish like the recipe said and once as a cold salad for lunch. Both ways were great. I'm not a fan of cilantro so I substituted curly leaf parsley.

I made this as-written except that I used 6 oz. feta.  It was very flavorful.

Really good quick meal lean with protein hit. Definitely do the red pepper flakes if you like spicy sooo good. I have also used basil when I didnâ€™t have cilantro.  Make with a piece of wheat toast!

What a tasty easy dish, that can be a main dish or a side dish. Love it simple with bread and wine.

This is a great base recipe to experiment with. I used 1 can of cannellini beans and 1 can of Great Northern whites. I also used a 28oz can of diced to make it more liquid (I wanted to pour it over pasta.  I used appx 1 tbsp Old World minced garlic instead of fresh. Pinch of dried basil, dried rosemary and a small bunch of fresh chopped purple basil.
Salted and black peppered to taste. 
Most of the changes I made were due to my bare cupboard. Using what I had, it came out fantastic!

A lovely side dish -- quick and easy. Use fresh tomatoes rather than canned and add parsley rather than cilantro to make it five-star worthy. I used canned tomatoes and I enjoyed it very much but I can only imagine how great it must be with fresh summer tomatoes. Definitely something I will make again. Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty, quick and so easy to put together.  I love Feta but used Parmesean instead for my taste.  Really liked it with a little extra garlic and I used fresh tomatoes.

Nice summer dinner!  I turned this into a whole new dish by serving it over buttery, garlicky angel hair pasta.
