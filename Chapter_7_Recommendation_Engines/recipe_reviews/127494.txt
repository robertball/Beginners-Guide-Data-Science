This pate is one of the best dips I've ever had.  I sauteed the mushroom ingredients on low, because when cooking with pure butter it burns easily, so I wanted to be careful.  I added a splash of white wine, and I slowly cooked the mushrooms for about 45 mins.  I also didn't feel like roasting the garlic (it was too hot out), so I added minced garlic to the mushrooms.  Next time I'll try it with roast garlic, but it was still fantastic.  VERY gourmet, and perfect for a classy event, or wine tasting.

crazy good! and someday i want to make it exactly as written. however ... i had some shrooms in the fridge that i needed to use up and this recipe caught my eye -- must have been the word "exotic." mine were not, but thought i could sub anyway. oh, wait. walnuts? didn't have any of those either. no shallots. i used regular onions, white and baby bella mushrooms, elephant garlic, all the fresh herbs listed plus sage. for the walnuts -- and this is REALLY nuts! -- i used old-fashioned peanut butter! i made just a little in case it was inedible, but here i sit with my "woven wheat crackers" (didn't have french bread!) chowing down like crazy! thanks for the "exotic" inspiration!!

I added dry white wine and a lil extra butter when I cooked the mushrooms down.  Then I  added a couple tablespoons of finely grated parmesan when I mixed everything together.  Delicious!  This is definitely something I plan on making again.

Ok, I did not care for this recipe and I LOVE all of the ingrediants.  The mushroom mixture was great until I added the walnuts.  Even thou I thought that it was not good, I still brought it to the party hoping that it was just my taste buds.  No one had more than one bite.

I can't even figure out how to fix it.  I really want to give it one star but that would give it a very low star rating and deter other people from trying it out on there own.  Maybe it was me...but I don't think so.  Look at my other reviews and see that I am usually a very possitve reviewer.

Thanks for the recipe.

An unusual and warm nutty pate. I added a dash of balsamic vinegar, and worcestorshire sauce when the mushrooms were sauteed. I used only button as it had no others in stock , but it still came out great . Used  fresh sage too.  Also put in a few frops of lemon juice as i was purreing it in the food processor.

Amazing! I was blown away, and no one could stop eating it. I often collect wild mushrooms (not for beginners) and am always looking for creative ways to prepare them. This recipe has the potential for endless variations of different nuts and mushrooms, all delicious!

A word about mushrooms: 1-wipe clean with a paper towel to remove any debris. 2-discard the stem, it is "tougher" than the cap and may produce a gritty texture in the finished product. 3-initially cook on med-high heat with butter and oil (adding oil increases the smoke point and keeps the butter from burning) to caramelize the mushrooms, (just like caramelized onions, they taste better). Then lower the heat and add non-salted flavored liquid (wine, sherry, etc) and water as necessary to tenderize and finish cooking.  

I would also like to clarify the amount of walnuts, I believe it is 1 cup of whole walnuts, not chopped, or diced, so adjust accordingly and use a smaller amount of chopped or diced. Take care not to burn the walnuts!

This was just okay. It tasted very mushroomy, which I like, but others said it tasted "dirty" to them. It does have a very earthy flavor. The exotic mushrooms aren't cheap and this took some time to put together. Just wasn't good enough to warrant the expense and effort.

I thought this was excellent. The roasted garlic is great - really brings out the woody mushroom flavor. I followed the recipe exactly and molded my pate in a plastic-lined ramekin.  I served this with a sesame baguette and sliced green apples. We all loved it. Thanks!

I loved this recipe! I'm Vegan and made a couple of modifications (Vegan butter and roasted pine nuts, cause I burned the Walnuts). Eveyone at my party liked it, and asked for the recipe. So good... thanks for sharing!

Too good! I am just not sure about the need to chill. It tasted perfect to me, I put in the refrigerator, then I couldnt find it. I called my wife whom is a good finder of all things lost, but she had stolen it! She tasted it, thought it would make a good lunch, took it to work and made lunch of it for two days. It is a great recipe. But be careful when chilling.

I sautéed mushrooms separately to brown, added splash of port and reduced.  I also blended in some cream cheese.  Oh yum.  Cream cheese isn't necessary, but I'm a cream cheese lover.

This was outstanding. I made half the recipe for the four of us.   We all really liked it. I roasted my garlic in the oven with the dessert I was baking for dinner.  I froze the rest of the roasted garlic because I know I will be making this again.

Perfection!!!  I'm addicted to this pate, as is everyone I've made it for.  I would not change a single ingredient.
Of course, MLM.

I was attracted to this recipe as it adhered to my post 10 day detox diet plan.  Bonus points for healthy fats.  It will be great to serve at my Christmas dinner party.  Unfortunately I missed the "roasted"  adjective before "garlic".  The pate turned out very well despite this, but will try to roast my own garlic for next time.  The other thing I want to try is to use truffle flavored olive oil next time.

I would rate this recipe a 5+.  I made it as directed and my guests raved about it.   If I were to make any changes,  I may add a tbsp or two of brandy about 5 minutes before the mushrooms were finished cooking.

I made this exactly as written and I found it to be way too rich.  I thought that was a lot of butter, but I stuck with the recipe, and whooeee it's a lot of butter! 
  

After tasting the finished product, I was able to salvage it, and ended up with something I would actually give 4+ stars to.  I cut in about a cup of sour cream.  Yes, you read that correctly, I added sour cream to REDUCE the richness, that's how rich this recipe was.  Then I added a bit of garlic powder and salt to punch it up a bit and it ended up being quite good.

absolutely spectacular dish!  Great hot or cold.  My kids love this dish when I put it inside of puft pastry and bake it until its golden brown.  I have used both walnuts and pecans, they both work.
For those of you not liking the earthy taste or getting dirt taste, you must wash not just wipe the mushrooms.  Also we sauteed the mushrooms for a very long time to bring out the natural sweetness.  Low and slow produces amazing results.

I used crimini mushrooms which are quite meaty but don't have the flavor of the mushrooms in original recipe so added a touch of worcestershire and balsamic at the end. The consistency and texture is great. I will make again but next time will double the parsley/other herbs, and skip toasting the walnuts.  Using this spread on baguettes and sandwiches for vegetarian family.

Very good! Im vegan so i had to modify the ingredients but it turned out fabulous. I also added almond pulp (from making almond milk) the texture is smooth like a liver pâté. Hubby liked it too, he couldn't stop eating it. Will make this again but will make sure to use the variety of mushrooms asked for in the recipe. I only had button mushrooms on hand.

We used minced garlic instead of roasted puree, added white wine while sauteeing, lemon juice, and parmesan and it came out delicious. Also, used a combination of olive oil and butter instead of all butter, and garlic sea salt instead of normal salt. Such a great appetizer! Doesn't taste too mushroom-y, almost tastes meaty.

Enjoyed the taste immensely...will be even better when I have all the mushroom varieties.  Only had crimini mushrooms, just shy of 1 cup walnuts so  added almonds, only had freezed-dried shallots, dried parsley and thyme.  So, added a wee bit of chardonnay to compensate for the dried goods and processed it in my  mini-prep processor (it got pretty full).  Was short on time so put it in the  freezer for about 10 minutes to quickly cool it.  Even with all the drawbacks, it was tasty and everyone enjoyed it.  Will try it again with correct ingredients and sitting time...am sure it will be over the top!

Nice thing about this recipe is that it's easy to tweak.  I increased mushroom qty to 1lb, used whatever I had on hand.  Reduced butter to 1/4c +1tblspn.  Increased roasted garlic paste, shallot/onion, salt, pepper, herbs. Important not to overbrown walnut, but next time think I'll try almonds or almond meal.  Will definitely try adding wine, marsala, brandy reducing mushroom mix.  Tried lemon juice but thought it was insignifcant to taste.

Great earthy paté! If it feels "dirty", you may be forgetting to clean your portobello properly (never forget to scoop the gills out!) I really didn't find it that difficult or time consuming. Before I put it in my ramekin, after it was oiled, I added a tonne of fresh cracked pepper, chunky kosher sea salt, thyme and a spring of parsley and it came out gorgeously.

I am *not* a mushroom person (it's the texture - I like the flavor) but really wanted a good vegetarian pate to put out at my upcoming "pate raid" party. This was fantastic.  I would say it was a 3-star when I combined the walnut mixture and mushrooms, but then I got crazy and added about 1 T. of half and half. Took it way, way up in my opinion.  I also added just a little bit of lemon juice while sauteeing the mushrooms to counter the earthiness, but I was very conservative (since I don't cook with mushrooms too much, I wasn't sure how it would work).  Not sure if the lemon juice is registering in the final product, but it's fantastic.

I've made this often and it's perfect just as it is.  The thyme is a crucial element - it really brings out the flavor of the mushrooms.  I've also occasionally changed it up (depending on my guests' palates) by adding a tablespoon of brandy, 3 oz of cream cheese and a dash or two of hot sauce.

This is delicious and I would not change a thing! Definitely a wonderful appetizer for guests but we like finding low calories treats and this fits the bill!

This is unbelievably delicious!  I didn't think I liked mushrooms,  or pate.   I can't get enough of this!   Because I'm vegan, I substituted Smart Balance Organic Vegan Buttery Spread.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of extra garlic.   Since Mushrooms are so good for us, I'm thrilled to finally have a way to get mushrooms in my diet that I truly love!  Thank you for posting this!

This was very good. A great dish to take to a party because it's ready to go. I roasted a bulb of garlic because I couldn't  find the puree. Also, I added a little wine but I think I had to cook it longer to get the liquid out. Serve with toasted french bread and it was delicious!

This was great! I used half fresh button mushrooms and half reconstituted shiitakes. My friend at Book Club is Vegan, so I substituted the olive oil plant-based butter. Dish is fantastic, let it warm to room temp

This was delightful, but I think it has far too much fat in the recipe. If I make it again, I will cut the butter in half and omit the olive oil completely. I also added about an extra cup of chopped walnuts to the mixture after blending, which I think helped a lot with the texture. I made this as a vegetarian accompaniment/alternative to the foie gras being served at a somewhat formal dinner.

Amazing! I was lucky to get some wild mushrooms from a very knowledgable mushroom forager neighbor. I used them. This was absolutely fantastic! I put it with goat cheese on sourdough toasts. I did use pine nuts since I burned my walnuts! Dang. Watch them closely! Thank you so much for the recipe!!

I made this using coconut oil instead of buttter as I’m on an exclusion diet, but it worked out fine.  I have a feeling you could make this using just about combination of mushrooms and herbs.  Delicious - and filling!

Loved it. I like to add some cream sherry at the end of the mushroom cooking time to reduce it down. It also freezes well.

Made a vegan spread of this; which is really quite good. Thought to make this for others that aren't quite so food sensitive BUT sure would be nice to have the amount recipe makes & serving number info. Calories are for what amount?

This was super easy to vegan-ize, just switched the butter for a good quality vegan vegetable butter.  The flavor and texture were spot on perfect.  As good or better than anything I've had at 5 star restaurants in Los Angeles.  Will make again and again.  I used a ceramic ramekin first time and it was a bit difficult to get out, so the next time I lined it with plastic wrap and it popped right out.

Add some dry white wine next time and see

I just made for a Christmas lunch I am having this weekend. I like having a veg appetiser on my list as there is always one or two vegetarian guests when I invite a crowd. I used button mushrooms (because that is all that is available here) and dried thyme. I also sprinkled some red chilli flakes because I love the taste. Made enough to fill two ramekins + a bit left over. Very very tasty. Though you might have to put it out for an hour or so before serving.

When the Hubby & I were living/working in Tesuque, NM., one of our clients was given a huge amount of giant portabello mushrooms and they sent some home with us. At that time, neither one of us liked mushrooms but seeing that we'd been invited to a going away party & everyone should bring a dish...I decided to see if I could come up with something using these mushrooms. Voilà! Found this recipe. Made it with only the portobello's yet it was just fantastic and only lasted about 20 mins. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was fabulous! I'm vegan so I used olive oil instead of butter, and because it was what was available, cremini, shitake, and white button mushrooms. I put them in three small Pyrex dishes (sprayed with PAM), and they came out somewhat easily. I love that you can make this ahead - I'm eating leftovers on Day 3 and it keeps getting better!

This is so delicious.  But garnish to add to the presentation.  By itself it is not that appealing .  I recommend a bed of parsley and sliced fresh mushrooms to give it a more appetizing presentation.  I didn't have walnuts so I used pecans and that worked well.  Next time I will try walnuts.  My daughter, who hates mushrooms, loved it.

This was delicious.  I did not have enough shiitakes so I added a few dried reconstituted Porcini.  If I were making it again, I would cut back on the walnuts just a bit.  I feel like they overwhelm the mushrooms just a bit too much for my taste.

I made a couple of changes.  Used  truffle oil as I love the taste and smoked garlic instead of roasted ones. It was really good until I added the walnut to it. The walnut was overpowering and I could barely taste the mushroom anymore. Next round, I'd omit the walnut. Texture was good though. Would make again... without the nuts.

This was an awesome recipe! I searched for " exotic mushroom recipes" on Google and came across this one. I was hooked as soon as i read it and it turned out wonderfully whne I came home from a mushroom festival with the required mushrooms. I'm now a fan of yours for your great taste in food recipes!
