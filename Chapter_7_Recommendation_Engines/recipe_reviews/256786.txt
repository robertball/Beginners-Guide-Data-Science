Who would have thought Guacamole Seasoning would be the star in this dip! It added all the right flavors and brought everything together wonderfully! Only thing I changed is I know I used more corned beef than called for but did not measure how much. This was a hit at a party and will be a regular hit in my house!

As Bibi and Marianne, I used leftover Mauigirl's braised corned beef from our St. Paddy's Day feast and as Lizzie wrote, who would have thought the guacamole seasoning would work with a corned beef dip, yet it did! I made half the recipe as it's just the two of us and we were leaving on vacation, so I didn't want it to go to waste. The little that was left, I smeared on a Sandwich Thin for lunch the next day. Delicious. I also served with toasted rye points. Maybe next time I'll add a few shakes of hot sauce for extra flavor and a little punch.

This dip is tasty, but a bit bland for us Texans, lol!  I used leftover Braised Corned Beef and all other ingredients as directed.  I recommend a rye cracker, or another type of cracker with substance and a contrasting flavor.  Thanks for the idea!

This is my favorite of all the McCormick dips I've made!  I used some of my leftover corned beef from mauigirl's Braised Corned Beef from this site, and I'm sure that helped out a lot!  The seasoning is just right on for me!  I can't wait to share this one with my family!  Yum!  Thanks, McCormick!
