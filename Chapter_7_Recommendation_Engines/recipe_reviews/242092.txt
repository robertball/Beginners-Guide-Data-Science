I really don't know how to rate this recipe knowing that the kitchen approved version using a whisk won't work, believe me, you would be whisking for days on end with still a grainy confectioners sugar. The personal recipes version states to "Mix the two until powder forms" but didn't state what to mix it in. As for the kitchen approved recipe I would give it one star for the simple reason the whisk won't work.  I did a test run  in a mini food processor which still resulted in grainy confectioners sugar. Lastly I used my single serve blender and the result was a 5 star perfect powdery confectioners sugar or powdered sugar as it's also known. *Update* The kitchen approved version has been updated to reflect the proper way to make the sugar and I highly suggest using a blender.

This worked great but it needs to state that you need a high power blender I used the nutr-bullet blender and it turned out great it has to grind to a fine powder which mine did thanks for sharing

I ran out of confectioners sugar to make glazed brownies and just had about 1/2 cup left.   I made this and it  turned out great.   This is so good to know just for this reason.  I did blend it in a small Tribest blender and it came out fine!
