A nice take on hot chocolate! I planned this for an evening with my grown daughters while on vacation,  and we loved it.  The red wine is subtle, yet noticeable and delicious. We had no half & half, but used a combination of heavy cream and unsweetened vanilla almond milk for the base, and a chopped Ghirardelli 100% cocoa baking bar.
