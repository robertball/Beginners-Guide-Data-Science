I will make it again but with major revisions. Followed the recipe and ended with raw eggs and burnt toast. Second go was better but third try- melt butter, add egg immediately. Flip egg and toast together, add avocado and cheese (Havarti), and cook for 2 min. MUCH BETTER!!!!!!

I replaced the cheese with grated sharp cheddar because itâ€™s what I had, and I used more avacado slices. Made just one, and it was delicious!  I often make this egg/bread recipe

Ended up with raw egg and burnt toast.

Recommended changes: after cracking the egg over avocado, cook 2 mins and then flip over to side without avocado so your egg won't be raw.
