I made HALF a recipe and it made more than enough for 6 as an entree.  I doubled the kale and squeezed the juice from a lemon into the dish after tasting.  This dish would be good with some feta sprinkled on top.  Thank you for sharing.

My whole family loved this recipe. I doubled the cayenne pepper but nothing else. One trick to easily remove the tough stem of the kale is to grab the thickest end of the stem with one hand, circle your index finger and thumb of your other hand around the stem and pull down. The leaves will easily be removed in two long pieces - no knives needed!

I liked this recipe. It is a Great base. If you are the only one eating from the pot, you are going to want to go ahead and set at least half aside to freeze.  The salsa added a surprising amount of depth although next time I will not use store bought salsa.  I made the recipe as directed and it was better the next day, but not awesome.  one night for leftovers I pulled a couple cups out and I added adobo sauce, cumin and cilantro for a more southwestern flavor and another night I added turmeric, curry powder and paste and ginger for a mid-east vibe.  Both were excellent...I will use the recipe as a guide for other dishes in the future.

This was really really good! Can't believe no one has rated it yet. The ingredients seem a bit odd, especially the salsa, but it all works. I used some Farro in addition to the lentils to add some texture, about 1/4 cup. Otherwise followed the recipe pretty much as written.
Overall a  nice vegetarian alternative. Thank you to whoever posted this one. It's a keeper.

Excellent recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used chicken broth in place of vegetable broth. I must admit, I wasn't sure how this would taste, I don't particularly care for lentils. But now I do! I will use this recipe as one of my regulars now. Even Husband and 3 kids liked it! PS. Remember when using kale, run your knife along the edge of the stem and cut the leaves off the stem. Do not eat the stem, that is the bitter part!

So GOod!! And so easy! I used half lentils half navy beans (soak the beans before you add them, maybe even cook a few minutes before adding since they take longer than the lentils) and the flavor was delicious. I also doubled the kale to get more greens in. For a little extra flavor I chopped some fresh cilantro and added that when I added the kale. Such a great recipe, I will be making this a lot! (Even my football playing boyfriend raved about it) =}

I have kale in my garden and found this recipe to use it for.  I love it.  I really didn't think this would be good.  It just didn't sound exciting, but it is delicious.  I used 4 c. vegetable broth and 2 cups beef because I had it leftover from something else.  I won't use beef broth the next time.  It is too salty.  I didn't taste before adding additionaly salt which was a mistake.

For next time:  all vegetable broth, a mild salsa so I can add cayenne.  Oh, and much more kale!

Nummy!  Added more lentils for a thicker consistency.  Made my own salsa to add.  Liked as toppings:  Feta cheese, sour cream and/or Greek yogurt.  Makes a lot! Suggestions for leftovers are:  stuff an omelet with it;  enchiladas;  stuffed pitas;  breakfast burrito;  stuffed bell peppers.  Goes well with so many things.  It's a keeper!

This is so easy to make, inexpensive, healthy, and delicious! I did not change anything, and don't believe anything needs to be changed. Will certainly make again, and can forsee this becoming a regular part of our family meal rotation!!!

This is a very nice recipe! I used my pressure cooker - I sautéed the vegetables in the pot and added everything except the seasoning and kale. Cook for 8 minutes at high pressure (I actually did 10 minutes and that was a bit too long). Add the seasoning and kale and cook, without pressure, for a few minutes until it's all done. I added a little oregano and cumin, but that really depends on the salsa and broth you use. Super quick, easy and very delicious. The kale-phobic man of the house said it was good and ate the bowlful. I will make this often and it will be fun to try it with different salsas. Thank you very much!

Pretty good on its own, better inside warmed tortillas like a burrito or served with flatbread.

I was looking for a soup recipe that used both kale and lentils.  Typically I like to use recipes that have MANY reviews, the higher starred the better obviously.  I am so glad I took a chance on this recipe - it is extremely easy to make and tasty.  I did choose to use chicken broth vs. vegetable broth and I cut my carrots rather than shredded them. I also omitted the spices, because frankly, I forgot to put them in.  Thanks to the store bought salsa, I didn't miss them.   In my estimation, it makes way more than 6 servings (as other reviewers have expressed) but that is just fine because I shared it with my neighbor,  and my mother-in-law, and of course my husband and they all gushed over it.  The real test may be my 13 and 15 year old kiddos, but I honestly don't care if they like it or not because I am happy to eat the left-overs all on my own!  Will def be making this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Props to this recipe for being yummy, filling , and cheap to make. The only thing I added was more chicken broth because the lentils kept absorbing the liquid. One thing I noted is that my lentils were still a little too firm. I wonder if the tomatoes in the salsa halted their cooking? I don't know. But they were still good. And so simple to make . Next time I will double the kale. I served with homemade cornbread and it kept me full for like 5 hours which is a feat.

I didn't care for this recipe that much - I felt like the salsa overtook the other ingredients and it just wasn't the best.  I'm sure with modifications it would be better -- perhaps omitting the salsa altogether and using fresh ingredients (tomatoes, cilantro, etc) in its place.

This is a great vegan recipe.  Many of my friends are vegan and now I have a new recipe for dinner parties in my file.  I thought the cayenne really contributed to depth of flavor.  The salsa and the broth already had enough salt, so I skipped it in favor of a generous dose of black pepper.  After reading others' reviews, I will add some ground beef, sweet potato, and sour cream next time I make it for myself, to turn it into more of a chili.

WOO HOO!  First time trying lentils!  I wasn't too sure about this.  The salsa was throwing me off.  The flavors really came together though.  Made exactly as writted except used lower sodium chicken broth.  Others have said this was a soup, but mine turned out as pictured.  Kinda of thick and hearty.  Yummy!!!

I had no carrots, used green beans and corn. Only had 1/4 jar salsa, so I added a few dollops of jarred spaghetti sauce. WOW it was fantastic! I see lots of peeps had to morph ingredients and still came out w/ a great dish even tho it was not the original. Thank you for this great recipe!  2nd time followed recipe and added green beans & squash. Thanks again!

I added 1 cup of each: shredded parsnips, diced celery and cubed sweet potato. I used a little more olive oil to accommodate the extra veggies. I also increased the chicken broth to 8 cups. Great flavor and depth! Tasty recipe! The kale looks beautiful in this dish.

We didn't have regular salsa, so I used a peach-flavored variety.  It tasted great and we each ate several helpings.  We never knew lentils and kale could be so delicious.  We will definitely make this again.

It was good but I had to change a couple of things.  I didn’t have salsa so added some strained tomatoes with herbs. I was also trying to make it lowsalt so it was lacking a bit of flavour at first so I added a Middle East blend (paprika, cayenne, turmeric etc) that I have to round it out.  
I did it in the Instant Pot and it was perfect in 30 minutes.  
Next time I’ll add more vegetables.

This was ok.  I think the 'Lentils and Spinach' recipe on this site is better.  I ate it but I wouldn't make it again - just a little bland.

This was fantastic! It made a huge batch so I put half into lunch size portions and froze. A great combination of flavor. I added mushrooms and substituted diced canned tomatoes for the salsa. I sprinkled a dash or two of franks red hot sauce on begire serving . Titally hit the  spot on a cold stormy day!

I halved the recipe because it is just my husband and I. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written. It was excellent. My husband said it's definitely a keeper!

the first time I made this , I closely follow the recipe, and while I liked it a lot my wife thought it was too spicy.
I changed it up a bit. Instead of using salsa I used a 12 ounce can petite diced tomatoes and 1 tablespoon of chili powder. the only other spices I put in 1 teaspoon of ginger, 1 teaspoon of curry powder and a half teaspoon cumin. that seemed to be more acceptable to my wife's stomach and makes for a nice taste.
Good recipe though.

I used my own homemade salsa, but otherwise followed the recipe.  This made a good tasty soup, and an interesting variation from the lentil soup I usually make.

Instead of throwing out that bag of lentils I had in my cabinet for too long  I decided to look for a recipe  to finally use them .  When I came across  this recipe I realized I had all of the ingredients on hand.  I was a little bit afraid when reading the ingredients ... I just wasn't sure what it would taste like but   After making this recipe  I agree with the name of the soup - it truly was amazing.  The only thing I had to change  was, because I only had 12 ounces of salsa I used half a can of rotel that I had on hand.   And I used  a spinach / kale mix instead of just simply kale, but  I don't think either change would have changed the taste at all .   I must say the soup is a hearty, thick, rich,  very filling and delicious meal.  I thank you for this recipe , I truly enjoyed it –I can't wait to make it again!

This recipe was amazing! My only criticism is that it was a little salty (most likely from the salsa).  I cut the recipe in half, because I know how lentils tend to "grow" as they cook.  Being vegetarian, I ate this as my main entree and had sufficient leftovers.  I did follow someone's suggestion to add sweet potato and that made the dish even more delicious.  For those of you who suffer with digestive issues from lentils, boil your lentils for 3 minutes before soaking them.  Then let them soak overnight, allowing them to ferment.  Add 1/8 t. baking soda to the water before you cook them and it will make them almost gas-free for your tummy.

Very very easy, and surprisingly tasty.   Used chicken broth (not low sodium), and Pace mild salsa.  Next time use medium salsa.  Used brown lentils, but should have realized that they usually take a long time to become tender, and that the 45 mins was not long enough.  Even after cooking for an extra 30 mins, still not as soft as I would have liked.  Sooo, next time use a different lentil.  Also used the whole head of garlic.

Very tasty! I wanted an easy recipe that used kale for more than just a salad. The flavor was very good, and my husband also enjoyed it. The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars was because there were too many lentils. There are way more than six servings in this recipe! Next time I will probably cut the amount of lentils in half and add some chicken. The other thing to note: it took closer to an hour (not 45 mins) for the lentils to soften in the recipe.

Just whipped this up for my rainy day lunch. Yummy and sooooo easy. I used less kale, and added a squirt of lemon and a small chopped potato (just because that's how I like my lentil soup.) Recommend!

Maybe not amazing, but good.  My husband and I each rated it a 4, while my mother rated it a 3.  Made it as directed, except used chicken broth as opposed to vegetable broth.  Served it on rice which was good as it cut the heat quite a bit and made it more interesting.  I liked the suggestion of one reviewer to season it with curry as opposed to the cumin.  If I make it again, I think that I will try the curry to give it an Indian flair.

Yummmm! We are not of the the vegetarian flavor and used chicken stock.  Also I used hot chunky salsa which was definitely enough seasoning (I didn't need salt, pepper,  or cayenne).   I only used half the amount of  lentils. Next time I will use a bunch and a half of kael.  In general, I amped up the veggies.

This was GREAT! I loved it! I halved the recipe and it was enough for me for
two meals+. It was a little spicy. So next time I'll try mild instead of medium 
salsa and omit the pepper. I'm making it again tonight. Healthy, easy and delicious.

Very Yummy.  We loved it!  I used a different broth - 1/2 chicken & 1/2 turkey.  I also was low on chunky style salsa (under 1/2 a jar) so I added a 16 oz can of diced garlic & onion tomatoes with juice to the dish and it turned out great!

i made this recipe very close to how it is written. I bought matchstick carrots that were already cut up instead of shredding them myself.  I used a red onion-because I like red onion. I also found organic "baby kale" that was packaged like ready to eat salad. I used orange lentils because they were prettier than the green/brown ones, but I don't think it would matter. I added spinach too, because I needed to use it up.  This was such a surprise!  My eleven year old loved it and I loved it.  We are the only ones to try it so far. Too bad it was 97 degrees outside today - it will make a great cooler weather meal- I will make this next month! It did make a ton, but my daughter and I will take it to school for lunch tomorrow.

My neighbors and I really loved this dish- even without the salsa (I was a bit chicken to try that). We ate it for three days because we had so much!  Very filling and healthy-feeling. Next time I will use leftovers to try some lentil burgers and might also try a Peach-Mango salsa- thought that might add a nice twist!

Very good!  What a nice, healthy and tasty recipe. I halved the recipe, chopped baby carrots, chicken broth and red lentils.  Also didn't have to cook the lentils more than 25 minutes.  I also added cannellini beans at the end with some browned Wegmans apple chicken sausage. Delish!

Very easy and delicious. I added some ginger and chili powder too. Next time I would use more kale for my own taste (or substitute with more spinach but that's just because some family members don't enjoy the kale texture).

I made half the amount as recommended by another reviewer, and it was enough for about 5 large servings. I didn't have salsa on hand and substituted an equal amount of Bertolli italian sausage pasta sauce. It was delicious!

Delicious! My whole family loved it. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, but only because that is what I already had. We served over jasmine rice with sour cream and cilantro, with some naan on the side. It was a wonderful dinner.

It is so easy to make, very nutritious and delicious!  I make it almost exactly the way it is, except that I add some more stock if it gets too thick.
I love this recipe!

I left out the cayenne, I felt it was plenty spicy enough from the medium salsa I used. My husband and son both like spicy, so I had them just add hot sauce to it at the table and they were pleased. Oh and I doubled the kale. Very good recipe! Served it with the vegan agave corn muffins on this site as well.

Loved it!!!  I didn't have enough lentils, so I used what I had & finished the rest off with Barley!  Really wanted some sweet potatoes so cubed up a large sweet potato & added that!  Took up another persons suggestion with topping it off with Feta!!  Used my own jar of homemade salsa from green tomatoes!  Will definitely make this one again!!!  Yummy!!!

Really delicious.  We didn't change anything about the recipe.  I didn't realize this was going to be a soup (the 6 cups of broth should have tipped me off).  It was even better the second day!

This is an AMAZING recipe for many reasons! First it is DELICIOUS, second, it's EASY and third, it's NUTRICIOUS! I loved it!!! I did use 3 different kinds of salsa, 2 of which came from Trader Joe's. But I will make this again and again because of above reasons, and I would highly recommend it!!! THank You!!!

I really liked this.  Scooped out a portion for my six-year-old before adding the kale, as he hates it.  The rest of us inhaled it as written.

I thought it would be bland but the salsa gives it a lot of taste.  Excellent, will do it again!

This recipe is so easy, sooo good!  I double it, and freeze a bunch.  I even send it in my son's lunch to MIDDLE SCHOOL! He loves it too! I added portabello mushrooms to my recipe.
