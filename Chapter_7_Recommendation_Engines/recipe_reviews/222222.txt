I look for recipes that are quick, easy and have a lot of flavor (because I don't really like to cook) and this recipe hit all the high notes!  Took it to a potluck dinner and it got rave reviews.kudos to the creator.

I thought this was just a little to sweet. I would recommend starting with half the sugar and then tasting and adding as you go. Because I thought it was to sweet I added some extra vinegar and onion. I really liked the crunch of the peanuts. My family didn't really like this but I thought it was okay, just could use less sugar.

I took this salad to a church potluck and there was just a small amount left to bring home! I did cut back on the sugar as others suggested, I also added some ground black pepper and I used sunflower kernels. Next time I will add more onion I think. Great recipe and oh so easy!

Such a simple recipe and great for bringing to a potluck.  Looks like I spent hours chopping, but it probably took less than 5 minutes to throw it all together.  I did it the night before, and everything blended wonderfully by lunch the next day.  They didn't have bagged coleslaw at my store, so I found another chopped spring mix that had red and green cabbage, romaine, carrots, and green onions.  I will definitely remember this for the next time I need to bring something on short notice.

This is such a great tasty, crunchy salad!  I make it as a side dish, but I often find myself getting a bowl to snack on or to eat on its own for a light meal.  I am eating low carb, so I substitute Splenda for the sugar.  Delicious!

So simple and delicious!  I substituted a portion of the oil with 1/3 cup of Toasted Sesame Oil and reduced sugar to 1/4 cup.  I needed a quick recipe for a party and it was a huge hit.

I loved this salad and so did my guests!  I used fresh cabbage and fresh carrots (cut them up myself). I didn't have poppy seeds so I omitted them and I left out onion due to a picky soon to be husband.   I used a little less sugar and a few extra shakes of red wine vinegar. The recipe was delicious!!  I will make it again!

Oh my! I made this at the last minute for New Year's party as one attendee is vegan and it was a huge success with her and everyone else! I will admit to changing some ingredients so I could use what I had. Substituted sunflower seeds for nuts, and frozen edamame for peas, and used rice vinegar. Used half the suggested amount of sugar. Only change I would make would be less oil. Highly recommend and will make again!

I took this to a potluck.  It was quick and easy, and that was what I needed.  I didn't really care for the dressing, I thought it tasted too much of oil rather than a good tangy/sweet balance that I would have expected from the ingredient list.
