I had the cranberry sauce, mandarin oranges and pineapple on hand, so I thought that I'd make this for Thanksgiving.  I did cut the ground cinnamon to 3/4 of a tablespoon because one whole tablespoon looked like too much for the volume...and that was a good call.  I also added one cup of chopped walnuts and a few sliced green grapes and that took this recipe right to "excellent!"  Everyone loved it and had seconds.  Keeping this recipe for future holidays!

Wow! This was SO good, and so very, very easy! I made it the night before our Christmas dinner, so the flavors could meld. I absolutely loved it, as did everyone else! Definitely will make this again (and again, and again....)!

I made this for the first time, recently, and had lots of compliments on it.  One friend commented that it doesn't have the tartness that many cranberry recipes have.  she really like it.
