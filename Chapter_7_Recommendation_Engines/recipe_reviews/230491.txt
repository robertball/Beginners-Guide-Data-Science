For taste, I would give this a four and a half. Very good. The directions leave a lot to be desired, though, so I am bumping it down to a three. What are the approximate dimensions of the logs? After the first baking and cutting, do you put the cookies on the pan cut side up or not? The baking time is pretty vague for the second baking.   I have been baking for sixty years, have made biscotti a few times (although it is not one of my regulars) so I figured this stuff out, but a novice would have difficulty with these directions. As for the cookie itself, next time I will not put in the mint chocolate chips. If  I add anything, it will be candy cane Kisses that I chop up. Biscotti is labor intensive, but these are worth a try.

Fab, fab, fab!  I made this biscotti and it turned out so pretty and tasty.  I like to make just one goodie for my food gifts so I used some peppermint sugar and almonds as well as the candy canes for dipping.  When I first tried cutting the logs I thought Oh No, they are going to crumble.  I let them cool as couple of minutes and used a spatula to cut the slices and that worked really well.  If you like peppermint and chocolate you will absolutely love these.

I didn't have peppermint extract, so I used one drop of peppermint oil per batch and doubled the recipe. It has been renamed "Christmas Crack" in my house.  People beg for this biscotti!

I followed this recipe exactly. I am not sure where I went wrong but my biscotti was crumbly. However, the crumbs were delicious! I will try this again to see if I can perfect it because they are too yummy to give up on!

I made it exactly as written. The instructions were a little vague on the second baking so I added 5 min and flipped them half way thru. They are fantastic. Great for dunking in coffee. Flavor was wonderful.

I made smaller logs and got 7. yield- 9 dz. cookies. I didn't have chocolate liquor so I added coffee  and didn't put the peppermint extract in. White chocolate dipped with crushed peppermint....yes a hit!!! Thank you

Love it! I couldn't find Godiva Original so I used Godiva Double Chocolate. Also, I used the chocolate/mint candy canes and Andes candies.  Will definitely make again.
