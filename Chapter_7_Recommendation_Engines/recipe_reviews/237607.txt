The flavor of the marinated fish was overwhelmed by the garlic, onion and cilantro. I like my ceviche  less cluttered.

Yum. This was very good. Glad to find a new way to eat Halibut. I didn't change a thing.

This stuff is fantastic. I don't know if I got zealous with a few of the spices or not, but this turned out refreshing, spicy, and full-flavored. Just fantastic. I'm not a fan of jalapenos, but the one pepper I put in this, chopped finely, added an excellent level of heat--subtle to start and building gently.

I added some finely diced cucumber, subbed red bell pepper for green, and gave it a squeezeof fresh lemon juice. I served these with Triscuit Wasabi and Soy Thin Crisps. They were a good match for the ceviche'. I used flounder. Can't wait to do this with shrimp and scallops.

I used fresh tuna. Add tomatoes and cucumber on the side for freshness.
