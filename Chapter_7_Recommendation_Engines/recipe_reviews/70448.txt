I made this for my little brother and I last night when we were both starved. He took one bite and then snatched the cup out of my hands! Afterwards he asked "are you a chef? how do you make such good stuff?" :) It's very very good and super easy, not to mention filling! I only used four crackers in each of ours and it was plenty, although I used a teensy bit more butter. Super recipe!

This is a simple, delicious "comfort food."  I used club crackers, and agree that 7 is way too many for one egg; next time, I'll try it with less.  Also, like a previous reviewer, I used a poached egg, as it's far easier to just scoop right out of the water and plop onto your prepared crackers without the hassle of peeling the shell.  I can see many ways this could be jazzed up...but for me, the flavours combine perfectly "as is."  Thanks for a filling, yummy cup of comfort!

Mmm, I remember these from my childhood.  I've also made them myself once or twice since I graduated college.  I do a couple of things differently, which I'll submit here for others to experiment with if they please:  One, I grease the sides of the cup with butter instead of mixing it with the other ingredients.  Two, I layer the eggs with bread torn into small pieces instead of crackers.  You can also add shredded cheese layers, breakfast meats, sauteed onions, etc.  The possibilities are really endless.

Thank you, Majikman!
We used to call these "Gramma's Eggs" because my maternal Grandmother used to make these -- especially when I was sick or needed comfort -- except she used one slice of buttered bread per egg torn or cut into pieces. instead of the crackers.  

Instead of peeling the eggs, we cracked them open (with a knife) and then scooped out the insides with a spoon into the cup. 

I found that three minutes was not enough (my whites were still a little runny), so I think I will cook them for four or five minutes next time.  (Not enough to "ding" the recipe if the stove is slow.)

Thanks again!

I loved this & then wanted my husband to try it. He didn't want to but then did, & he loved it too! I too used club crackers but will try it w/ saltines sometime. This would be great for breakfast on a camping trip.

My mom used to make this for us kids when we were sick.  It was so yummy!  I regretted not ever getting it from her.  I'm so glad this recipe was here!  I poached the eggs in about 3" of water, though, so as not to fuss with the eggshell.  Although Mom always used Saltines, all I had on hand were the 12-grain wheat crackers from Trader Joe's (I guess the equivalent would be Ritz's) -- excellent!

I have never tried this with crackers. My grandfather made soft boiled eggs everyday for breakfast. He had the timing down to a science. Could make coffee, turn on radio, putter around and his eggs were perfect. Runny yolk, NOT runny whites. He always ate them in a coffee mug.He cooked the eggs in a small saucepan and just before the eggs were done, he would put some butter in the cup and place it in the saucepan to melt the butter, then scoop the perfectly cooked eggs into the cup. A little S + P, quick mix. He has been gone many years, I'm now 59 and that is absolutely the only way I eat my soft boiled eggs. But sadly I have never been able to get the timing right. Always have a piece of buttered toast ready to break up into cup to soak up and hide the runny white.

Boiling for three minutes (I went for 4) will cause the shell to collapse into itself.  Then you'll have to try and save what you can from the whites still stuck to the shattered shell.  This was a disaster.  I see others poached their eggs.  Smart!   I am sure almost no one boiled their eggs for 3 minutes.

I've had something similar to this except we poached our eggs in evaporated milk and then poured the whole egg-milk mixture over crushed cornflakes! Not an empty plate in the house!

I used to eat this type of egg when I was little and now make it for my own girls.  I boil my eggs for 4 minutes though for my personal doneness.  Also, instead of peeling I hold the egg in a paper towel and use a knife to crack it open and scoop out the egg.  Much easier.  Enjoy!

My family has been making these for YEARS.  I generally add a sprinkly of the grated Mexican blend cheese to mine.  However, 7 crackers per cup is WAY to much cracker for one egg.  Just about anything can be added to this, Fritos are a fun change, and adding a bit of chili can be good also.

I used yard eggs, torn up pieces of buttered toast bread and sprinkled some shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top and WOW!!!  I find it easier to make over easy eggs in the pan instead of boiling and peeling.  It's faster and the outcome is the same.  I will try it the way it is suggested next time.

Never knew a recipe for this existed. Thought it was just something my father dreamed up 75 years ago. If he was sick, it was always what he wanted when nothing else sounded good and he always put a lot of pepper on top. I need to revive this in my family.

My mom used to make egg in a cup in the microwave with butter and no crackers, but I decided to give this a try 'cause it sounded great.  Turns out I really didn't like the crackers - they just turned to mush.  Next time I'll stick with Mom's method!

Was so excited to try this, but my whites were too runny after 5 or so minutes of boiling so tried to finish with a few secs in the microwave but things firmed up too fast. The soft boiled egg must be an art form! I'd like to try again using another method.

I've been making these eggs for over 50 years, I boil them for 3 min., take them out of the water and let cool for 1 min, crack them in half and scoop them out of the shell over toast that I have torn up. I never thought of crackers but may give it a try.  My Mom used to butter the toast before putting the eggs on them, but I just leave it plain.

I made this a while ago, but forgot to write my review until I ran across my printout of the recipe again. This was a pretty unusual recipe, and new to me. I thought it was pretty good, and had both helpings for myself. I'm not familiar with soft-boiled eggs, but the yolks were indeed runny, so I guess I did okay. But peeling them was quite tedious for such a little task - maybe there's a secret technique that makes it easier. I'd be up for making this again, should this recipe pop into my head sometime.

Seemed strange to me but decided to try it just now for breakfast.  Did not use as many crackers but find that the crackers do turn to mush and give the whole mixture a strange flavor.

This hit the spot while recovering from a stomach bug.  I don't have nostalgic memories of this recipe like many reviewers, so I can't say it was 'delicious', but it was tasty and simple and I will keep this one on hand.  I only used 5 crackers for one egg, but will stick to 4 like other reviewers next time.

This was surprisingly good.  I eat eggs every day for breakfast and will be adding this to my recipe box.  As someone else mentioned, I cracked my eggs into about 2-3" simmering water and poached them for 3 minutes.  Scooped out with a slotted spoon right into the cup.  I used 4 saltines as suggested and it was perfect!

The ratio of saltines to egg makes for a very dry dish in this recipe. I prefer my bowl to be more egg than cracker. My mother made these when we were little (and I'm 64 now!) I got tired of cracking soft-boiled eggs and have begun to just poach 2 eggs and cut into 6 to 8 crushed saltines. No butter necessary.

Who knew crackers and egg would be so good. I've had it two days in a row, but with only 4 crackers for one egg, poached.  I am not a breakfast person, but must eat with my meds.  This goes down easy! This is the answer when you've run out of bread!

My wife has been making this for me for many years now and it's great.... really tasty and fills you up; great for breakfast.  I'd give it 5 stars and the trick is to not cook the eggs to much; leave them with some runny yolk to mix with the crackers.

I used to have this as a kid, but we would butter bread and cut it into little squares and then put it in the cup with the egg over it,  the butter on the bread replaced the extra butter, we added a little salt and pepper.. YUMMY!! That would be my breakfast before going to school, held me over till my first school break lol.

My grandmother made this with animal crackers.  It gave a sweetness to balance the egg as she salted it.  YYYYUMMMY!

LOVE this!  This is food from childhood, we ate it (and still do!) with Ritz crackers, SO yummy! We also use poached eggs, much easier than dealing with peeling a soft-boiled egg. Thanks for the memory, this may be dinner tonight. :)

Once a week I treat myself to an egg. My mom would make something similar for my two brothers but with bread. Now that I finally love eggs I decided to try this with Ritz crackers and boy, this really was a treat! Poached eggs are my fav, which worked very well with this recipe. YUMMO and thanks!
