I made this twice for potlucks and both my husband and I liked it a lot.  Although I did use less noodles than recipe called for - the veggie to noodle ratio seemed off to me.  Also, the second time I made it, I used more feta and liked it better that way.  My husband liked it just fine the first way.  Of course, kids only ate the noodles and an occasional bell pepper piece.  Also, for the bell peppers, I only used red bell peppers.  I recommend it.

Vey good, light recipe. I halved the recipe  and used yellow squash instead of eggplant and red pepper instead of green. I also used cherry tomatoes. To make it more healthy I used Barilla Pasta Plus, Kraft Low Fat Zesty dressing (only 1/2 cup needed) and reduced fat tomato & basil feta.

This recipe was very good. I accidentally replaced the bell pepper with a poblano, but it didnt really change much. I used a yellow zucchini, which stayed kind of crunchy and nutty- very good. For the dressing, i used half fat free italian and half fat free honey dijon. The whole thing, therefore, had a nice, sweet taste, nicely accented by the sharp taste of the feta cheese. I recommend this for a hot summer night, or for a potluck. Very pretty presentation.

Such an easy recipe! Sometimes I either add more vegetables (broccoli, squash, asparagus, etc.) or less pasta to balance out the portions. Great as is.

I am always looking for Vegetarian recipes for my Veggie daughter. My family loved this. It was fairly easy and quick to make, although I highly recommend leaving enough time to serve it cold. I envision changing the vegetables to whatever is in season. I used a red pepper and red onion because that is what I had on hand. I had to make a homemade dressing because my Italian has anchovies (not vegetarian!). Will definitely make this again!

I used a red pepper instead of green, only 1/2 cup fat free Italian dressing, and about 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil.  I had to roast the veggies longer than indicated, and turned the oven up at the end.  Overall an easy tasty dish, easy to make early in the day for dinner that night.

This was really good with the following changes: I halved the amount of pasta and used whole wheat pasta, omitted the feta (used a couple tablespoons of fresh parm sprinkled over the top) and used 1/3 of the amount of salad dressing. Everyone raved.

This was great.  I used red and orange bell peppers rather than the egg plant plus yellow and green zucchini, rough chopped kalamata olives and sun dried tomatoes. Also added an herbed vegan faux feta cheese (made with tofu). Used Tinkyada rice pasta rotini noodles. TASTY vegan gluten free dish was a BIG hit. Also just made a home vinaigrette rather than the Italian dressing.

Pasta salads are such a versatile side dish for summer meals. I used whole wheat pasta and a "light" bottled dressin to reduce the fat. Everyone loved the addition of oven roasted vegetables. Tasty and colorful. I recommend this for your next al fresca meal.

Excellent other than I would not use eggplant next time.
My 17 year old son gobbled it up and I made it primarily for my vegetarian daughter

This really good with a few suggestions. Reduce pasta by half or more. I subbed bellini mushrooms for squash, and roasted it at 425 for 20 min then reduced to 375 and put chicken breasts in oven to roast in sep pan for 30 min.  Stirred veggies every 10 min or so. Then tossed with splash of red wine vinegar and chopped fresh basil, (instead of It dressing),  thyme and scallions, tomatoes and mini penne ... It was so good my Hubbie didnt notice the eggplant.

I didn't have zucchini or feta, but did add mushrooms and broccoli. I cut back on the dressing amount. Tasted better after being in the fridge 2 hours.

I really loved this recipe but no one else did. Everyone picked out the veggies and only ate the noodles. Soory!

Delicious! Got rave reviews from a luncheon I hosted. I only used one eggplant and added some yellow squash with the zucchini. Thanks!

It was good, but we thought the italian salad dressing was a bit strong.

I made this as a side dish for my family... They loved it! I had my son crying while I was shopping for the ingredients so I was obviously in a hurry to leave the store and I grabbed "wheat rotini" by accident. I didn't even realize but it was still great! It would have been so much better if it wasn't wheat though :( highly recommend :) thank you thank you!

I made this for the family this evening and doubled the recipe since I had 6 adults to feed and I had plenty of rotini pasta.  I had some green peppers, tomatoes and eggplant from our garden that were amazing in this.  I didn't have any zucchini so I omitted it.  I used freshly grated Parmesan cheese rather than feta and balsamic vinaigrette in place of the Italian dressing since that is what I had on hand and it turned out just fine.  This was a hit with the family, I will make it again for sure.

I enjoyed this salad.  Only change made was to sub 1/2" cubes of jack cheese for feta.  Next time would peel eggplant.

Excellent exactly as is! Dressing is just enough but still light. Refreshing way to use those veggies from your garden or farmers market. Will make again!

VERY good.  More pasta than I thought it would be but still good.  Have made it a couple of times.
