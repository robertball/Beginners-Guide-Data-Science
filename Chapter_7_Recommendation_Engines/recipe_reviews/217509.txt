I almost didn't make this because it called for 7/8 cup of water.  Silly me 8)  I just made it a scant cup of boiling water.  This recipe is a keeper!  Everybody enjoyed it this Easter morning.

The bread was easy to make and came out nice with just a hint of sweetness. It was great hot out of the oven with melted butter and honey drizzled on it.

This is such a treat to make and to eat!! As I was mixing the bread, it smelt so wonderful and I looked forward to baking it. When 15 mins was up and I opened the oven door, the fantastic aroma once again mesmerized me. Finally, the taste... Heavenly! How could something so simple to put together taste so great?!! Thank you for a wonderful recipe! I will definitely be making this again soon!! FYI: I needed to use a little more than a cup of water for the mixture to form a dough. I forgot to mention that they even look so pretty! This recipe is simply fantastic!! Ahhhh!!!!

A quick flat bread that can be served for breakfast or any other meal.  It is great served with applebutter, honey or jam.  It is so good when it is right out of the oven

This was my first attempt at a flat bread and since hubby was reading the recipe to me, (we) added the butter into the liquid:) I scaled it for 4 servings since I wasn't sure of how it would turn out and wished I'd made more however since it was so easy it can be made from scratch any time we want more! Absolutely loved the results, shared recipe with my daughter and will be making another batch to go with the roasted chicken, a bit of tarragon and mayo. Can't think of another recipe as east as this one... Thanks for sharing!

I wanted to make a whole wheat flat bread for mana'ish and though this is a sweeter bread, it worked perfectly! I also ate some dipped in honey and honestly, this is a wonderful bread just to eat because you want something to snack on. I highly recommend it--perfect blend of taste and small time investment.

Followed recipe and while mixing it turn out really dry with only 7/8 of a cup of water. Ended up turning it into a bread. Added two eggs and enough water to moisten into a bread batter. Greased and floured a bread pan and baked at 350 for 60 minutes. Final thoughts: Might consider using half of the baking powder (1/2 teaspoon) and adding a (1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. Will probably use milk in place of water (1 cup or more). This will probably bring more moisture to the bread. Never made flat bread before. maybe I didn't make it right.

We loved this recipe.  The children said it had more flavor when it was cold.

Delicious bread that only takes a few minutes to make.  It was perfect with the roast beef dinner I was making.  I really enjoyed the flavors and texture.  I did shape my dough about an inch thick instead of 1/4 inch thick and cut it into chunks.  I will certainly be making this bread often.  Thank you BOLTONLANE for sharing this wonderful recipe.
