Absolutely delicious and soooo easy! My husband, a firefighter, has had many an irish soda bread over the years and rated this one right at the top!  I used a 9" cake pan instead of a springform and it came out beautifully!  Actual baking time was closer to 50-55 minutes, but otherwise a wonderful recipe!!

I have never had this bread before. I am so glad allrecipes featured it, or I would never have known about it. It was delicious! I made it for St. Patrick's Day along with corned beef and some slaw. Oh my, was it good! The flavor and texture were terrific. My whole family loved it. The bread turned out beautifully. I should have taken a picture and posted it, because it looked like something you would buy from a bakery. It was also very easy to make, so it definitely deserves 5 stars!

The top was very much done, but the toothpick never came out clean from the middle.  I wasn't thrilled with the end result.

A winner! I followed the recipe exactly and found the new love of my life! My husband and our dear neighbor were so complimentary, I'll surely make it again. This was soda bread was a perfect pairing for the corned beef and cabbage dinner last night. Thank you, Macomb!

This was so very delicious...perhaps the BEST Irish Soda Bread I've eaten. Completely perplexed by comments that it was dry...this was hands-down the softest and moistest Irish Soda Bread I have ever made/eaten.

Hands down the best soda bread I've had/made!  Moist, flavorful and super easy.  Can't wait to toast the leftovers for breakfast!

I add 2/3 cup of wheat germ and one extra egg (3 eggs) in total. The extra egg made it much easier to stir up when all of the ingredients were in the same bowl. I also had to add another 10 to 15 minutes to the baking time. The old batter was simply TOO DRY to stir. I really liked this recipe and it was my very first time making Irish Soda bread, too. This bread was great and I received plenty of compliments. Thanks Macomb!

One of the best Irish Soda breads I have had the pleasure to eat. The sour cream makes it more moist than others out there. Definitely will be a staple on our table when the occasion arises.

These Half-Irish Eyes Are Smilen'!

I was very impressed with how this simple recipe made such a beautiful loaf of bread. I didn't have carraway seeds :/ I think they make a big difference..BUT I HAVE 'em now :)side notes: I prefer light raisins and GO easy very on the salt. ;) HAPPY ST. PAT's bakers!

This is certainly one of the better soda breads on this site but much too sweet for us......Irish bread really should be more savory at least that is what I grew up with  We have to suit our own tastes and seeing I was weaned on the stuff have formed some pretty opinions. Anyway please try this and adjust sweetness to taste.    Thanks....everyone should try this at least once.

This was pretty good Irish Soda Bread.  I wouldn't call it great.  I think it really needs to be authentic with the buttermilk instead of the sour cream.  We used a cast iron skillet in the oven since I didn't have spring form pans handy.  The cast iron gave it a more crisper texture, which we liked.  We may do it again, but will tweak it to our tastes.

Made it exactly as directed and it was absolutely perfect!  My family was very pleased.  It was easy to prepare, from bowl, to pan, to oven.  Will be making this a lot in the future!

I used half golden raisins and half currants.  Seemed like it was a tad dry and didn't want to pull together but I added a tad bit of coconut milk to help.  Turned out beautifully.

Absolutely will make this again, even as a breakfast bread. It baked up moist and sweet with a lovely golden color. I cut back 1 T of the caraway and added a smidge of cinnamon. Was a hit with our "bangers & mash" for St. Patrick's Day!

This  bread is delicious the day it is made, but mine turns hard as a rock on the second day.  Does anyone want to comment on this?  (I'm thinking I should have sifted the flour before adding it...)  Help!
