I'm a little confused about the ingredients... what is meant by the " 1 (1 ounce) square gallon coffee ice cream, softened on microwave's defrost setting for 1 minute " ? 

Would love to make this for summer events though.

This was pretty good. I made this for some friends that we had over for dinner. It was very simple to prepare. I am not sure about how necessary the sauce is though. I just used a gallon of coffee flavored ice cream- and it worked great!

I used Ghirardelli 60% cocoa chocolate in the ice cream rather than bittersweet, which was very good.  This is much easier than a traditional Tiramisu, while still retaining much of what makes Tiramisu so delicious.  

But most importantly, I would make twice the sauce - the sauce is exquisite and really makes the dessert, in my opinion.

Don't skip the Sauce!  It is the best part!  Everyone at my dinner party loved it, and my husband could not wait for the next evening to eat what was left over!  Next time I am going to soak the lady fingers, since I like them to have a stronger flavor.  Since they are frozen, I do not think the texture would be soggy.

Nothing special.  It was good simply because it's ice cream.  Not worth the time it takes to make or for that matter find the ingredidents.  Wont make it again.
