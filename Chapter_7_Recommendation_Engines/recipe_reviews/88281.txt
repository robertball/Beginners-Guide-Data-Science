I thought it was good and smelled awesome cooking. I did everyone the same. The only problem I had was it wouldn't cook, I probably cooked it for a half hour more. I think next time I would cook it at 375 instead of 350. It just was so pink and mushy. It got really frustrating since my sides were already done.

My Family called this the "Best Meatloaf Ever!!!". It's really good especially with the Spruced Up Mashed Potatoes(provided by another contributor). If you can find a restaurant near you that makes frsh salsa every day, or you like to make your own salsa, that will make the meatloaf even better! Highest recommendation.

When I try recipes, I always ask my husband what he thinks--he is a real picky eater!!  He really liked this, especially because it is not mushy when cooked up.  It has substance to it.  I also liked it but did cook it a few minutes longer.  I was also darker in color than the picture.  Good recipe!!

This turned out really good. My oldest daughter swears that meatloaf is awful but she actually liked this kind. It was very moist and flavorful. Just waiting on how it re-heats for my fiancee. But I will use this again!! (I did add a little more garlic, minced onion and italian seasoning. I used ground beef and cooked it at 375 for about 45 min.)

Easy and yummy. The salsa makes it moist and spicy. I substitute ½ cup of parmesan cheese for the cheddar cheese. It gives it a smokier flavor. My husband, who has never liked my previous meatloaves, gobbles this one up.

Very tasty, but I would add about a 1/4 (or more) salsa next time.  Perhaps some jalapeños or chilies, too.

I followed the suggestion to add a glaze partway thru and to up the temp to 375 halfway. It was great! I used ground turkey and added nopales. Yum.

It was very moist and a lot of flavor!! Cooked for 35 mins only because I used lean ground beef.

It was really good and super easy. However, I used corn flakes instead of bread crumbs. Will definitely cook this again.

Meatloaf is a favourite with our family.  This recipe? Excellent flavour and texture. I cooked it at 375 for 45 minutes then coated the top with a ketchup and brown sugar glaze (1/4)cup ketchup & 1 Tbs brown sugar) served with mashed garlic potatoes.  Company raved.  Thanks for the salsa twist in this one.

I've been using a similar recipe for the better part of two decades. The only differences are that I use ground up tortilla chips or taco shells that I usually have leftover instead of bread crumbs, and instead of putting the cheese inside I sprinkle it on top during the last 10 minutes or so...just long enough to melt nicely.Add a little salsa and sour cream on the side and you have Taco Meatloaf. Yum!

I wanted to try this recipe because we make our own homeade salsa every summer. I wasn't sure about salsa in meatloaf, but, This was the BEST RECIPE EVER. It tasted like gourmet meatloaf but was quick and easy. I substituted cheddar cheese for parmesan cheese and used ritz crackers and italian seasoning rather than bread crumbs. After it was done, I added a small amount of salsa and fresh cilantro on top for five more minutes in the oven. I recommend this to anyone and will cook again soon.

A lot of the success of this recipe is in the salsa. If you get junky salsa because it's "just going into a meatloaf." It will taste like junky salsa.  Dry your breadcrumbs before you make it and that will solve part of the soggy texture issue. I use raw dry oatmeal instead. It makes it healthier and gives it a nice texture. Don't use cheese 'products' or it will get soft. Real cheese keeps it firmer and switching around your cheeses allows a nice change in flavors. If you have a draining pan,use it because when cheddar melts it gets oily. As other reviewers have noted, be sure to use very lean ground beef! It gets 3 or 4 stars because if it were my recipe, I would have added some other dry spices such as onion, garlic powder, a bit of chili powder and cumin and some more green chili's.

This was such a nice twist on meatloaf that my family really enjoyed.  I actually baked it in a muffin pan and made "meatloaffins" so it got done a little quicker.  I had no problems with it being too soggy/wet like other people reported.

I made this with ground turkey and was sure my husband was going to hate it, but he was very pleasantly surprised.  This is so flavorful and moist not to mention easy to throw together.  This will definitely be something I make again and again!

This was fantastic - though it sounds strange to add salsa, it actually made a very moist and tasty meatloaf. Other reviewers said that the loaf comes out messy, but if you shape it into a loaf and bake it free standing, instead of in a loaf pan, the juices will not collect on top.

I've invented a similar recipe on my own in the past-using crushed old tortilla chips that I wanted to use up, instead of bread crumbs and a little cumin and a can of green chilies. We ate it as meatloaf the first night, with some mexican rice, and then use to leftovers for burito fillings the next day.

Similar to one I made with chili sauce.  I forgot the salsa had all the onion chunks in it and sure enough my son sat there picking them out.  He wants me to go back to chili sauce.  He did like this more than one with onion soup though.  Well all liked it.  I substituted oatmeal and used a full cup salsa.  What I didn't get was the purpose of the cheese.  It wasn't noticable so a waste.  I think I would try putting a layer of cheese in the middle for an interesting effect or on top.  I always top mine with ketchup, brown sugar and honey mustard which I usually put on about 15 min near the end.  I also did 375 at 1 hour as others suggested.  It was not as firm as a meatloaf should be but neither was my chili sauce one.  Not sure how to change that as I also used 2 eggs this time.  The colour wasn't a problem - not that pink.  So, yes it was tastey and the biggest suggestion would be do something diff with the cheese or leave it out.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever made!!!!!
Just a few changes...
I used a 20 oz pkg ground turkey (93%).
I left out the cheese, for less fat and never missed it.  I also used plain bread crumbs and would again.
For the salsa I used Santa Barbra mild.
Other than that I followed the recipe.  :-)

Wanna know how turn turkey into a delicious meal that your family will LOVE? Use this recipe! I was just looking for a change from my old regular ketchup based meatloaf recipe and decided to try this one. The only thing I didn't have on hand were the breadcrumbs, so I just crushed up some croutons that I had sitting in the pantry. I still love my old ketchup meatloaf recipe, but I plan on using this salsa version more often. Thanks Ms. Tinkerbell!

I am a huge meatloaf fan so I thought this would be really good. However I did not like it. I hated the texture of it. The only reason I'm giving it a 3 stars is because my husband liked it.

Solid flavor. I ground my own from chuck after trimming 80% of the fat off. I also recomend using spicy salsa.

the best meatloaf i have had. Unfortunately, my son didn't want to try it - the dry meatloaf memory is stuck in his head. I will make this again - even if for me. I didn't make any changes in this recipe, liked it the way it was created.

My husband's favorite meatloaf. I found a salsa that is spicy enough for him, yet I like it too. I think that is the key to this recipe.

The thickness of the salsa and the leanness of the meat probably determine how high or long you need to cook the meatloaf.  My timing was a tad bit different than the recipe, but I kept an eye on it, so it was fine.  This meatloaf turned out great.  I used pepper jack cheese because that was all I had, and it was excellent!

Super good. I was a bit skeptical -- never thought of this combination for meatloaf. I rarely stray from my regular meatloaf recipe passed down from my mother, but I had all the ingredients on hand so decided to give this a try. Very tasty! I even overcooked it by about 15 minutes because I had gone out for a walk, and had forgotten to wait until it was finished. It was still moist, with just a little crust around the outside. I'll make this again for sure. Thanks!

This recipe inspired me to make meat loaf for the first time. I made it with lean ground beef and added onions and jalapenos.
I liked the flavour, but not the texture. I think next time I will only put cheese on top, instead of mixing it in.

This is a great recipe for first time meatloaf makers though, easy, tasty and lots of opportunity to tweak it to satisfy personal preferences.

I dont care for meatloaf too much but my boyfriend wanted some so I tried this one out. I used Ro-Tel (the hot  one and drained it)instead of the salsa, I also added 1 chopped jalapeno and fresh onion.Thew in a little extra cheese too. We dont mind things spicy.
WOW it was great this is now on the menu at our house!

I do the same recipe and it's great.  I use Rotel tomatoes that are medium spice to give it a little kick.

This is so good and super easy to make. I used ground turkey (97% lean) and used grated parmesan instead of cheddar. I added more salsa and used about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs (that was all I had). I probably make this recipe once a month.

Super easy, super good.  The salsa makes it so you don't have to prep any vegetables plus adds another level of flavor.  I have made this 6 or 8 times over 2 years.  Great recipes.  No mods needed.

This meatloaf was easy and delicious!  To make this a little more "south of the border" I used plain breadcrubs and seasoned my meat with Penzey's bold taco, cumin, and onion powder.  I subed cilantro for the parsley, and topped the loaf with more salsa.  Yummy stuff!  A truly versitile recipe, thanks for sharing with us.

Made exactly as recipe states, leaving it in the oven for 1 hour. Very moist and good. It is a staple in our household menu list.

We all enjoyed it. Salsa is such a great idea. I would have never thought of it, but it has everything in it! Adds tons of veggies for the kids. Great way to sneak them in, and it is sooo moist. Everyone loved it.

Delicious! My husband & son-6 yrs old loved it. I did too & am not a meatloaf fan. I used a veal/beef/pork combo pack w/ mild salsa for my son. Next time I might try parmesean cheese. Will definitely be in the rotation

I never would have thought of using salsa with meatloaf.  This was outstanding!  I ate it with dinner rolls and garlic seaoned potatoes.  My next batch i'll add hot salsa! My daughter (LOL) said " daddy this don't look good", then added ketchup and said "now that's better".....she had two servings!

Sooooo good.  I used a parm/reggiano blend instead of cheddar, as it was all I had on hand.  Used lean ground beef. Baked at 375 instead of 350, and halfway through I topped with more salsa.  Added a chopped green pepper and half an onion.  Next time will omit the salt, as the salsa and cheese I used was enough.  Plan to make this over and over and over again.

I think using ground sirloin is a key.  I used fresh garlic instead of minced in a jar, and the taste and consistency was wonderful.  It cooked fully in 1 hour.  Thanks for this recipe!

I baked a one pound meatloaf using this recipe just for my husband and me.  There were no leftovers!  Hubby couldn't stop eating it and he's not a big turkey fan.  I didn't have any salsa, so I substituted a can of Rotel tomatoes and an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce.  I doubled the recipe and put one meatloaf in the freezer to bake another day.  I also whipped up the topping found in the Turkey Veggie Meatloaf Cups recipe to go over the top  and it added the perfect zing.  The meatloaf was juicy and delicious.  This one's a keeper.  Thanks!

I did this in the crockpot, and changed up some of the ingredients.  I used 3 pounds of ground sirloin, 3 palmfulls of chili powder, a couple of tablespoons each of cumin and coriander, skipped the cheddar altogether, and added an egg and 1 whole cup of italian breadcrumbs and about a cup of salsa.  Mix to desired consisistency, but don't make it too soft or it will fall apart.  If these measurements don't work for you, add either more breadcrumbs to dry it out, or more salsa to moisten.  Add another half-cup to the top of the meatloaf, covering the whole meatloaf (you can use more if you like) and cook on low in the crockpot for 3-4 hours.  I made it with rice and beans, but something like green beans and mashed potatos would be good too.  We'll have enough leftovers to freeze.

Thanks to other reviewers I upped the temperature.  This cooked to perfection (160 degrees internal) at 400 degrees for 45 mins.  We loved this meatloaf and you won't be dissapointed.

Simple to make! The meatloaf tastes very good, but I prefer a bit more flavor so I set aside additional salsa and sour cream to put on the meatloaf after serving on plates.  Next time I will be adding chopped onions to the recipe too!

YUM!  This was my first attempt at meat loaf and I'd say it was a complete success.  Definitely no need to try another recipe.  It's no "gourmet" fare, but really, who wants gourmet all the time anyway??  This was hearty and hit the spot, and so ridiculously easy to make.  I didn't even measure, just added the amounts that looked right and it was perfect.  Also didn't have italian breadcrumbs so subbed cornflakes mixed with italian seasonings. Will make this again.. soon!

This was delicous. I'm not a huge meatloaf lover and either are my kids but everyone took seconds and thirds of this recipe.  Except for using a meatloaf mix (ground beef, veal and pork) I followed this recipe just as it was written.  I doubled the recipe and did have to cook it much longer.  I baked it at 375 for 1 1/2 hours.  Great meatloaf!!

Great Easy recipe!  I did put about 1/2 cup of salsa over the top of the loaf for extra flavor (we like sauce with our meatloaf!) Its great because really you don't need to measure its kind of an "eyeball it" kind of recipe Thanks!!

I used garlic ritz crackers and a can of rotel, but other than that followed the directions, and I love this stuff! My boyfriend shuddered when I told him I was making meatloaf, but bit the bullet and tried it and has asked me to make it again! Its so juicy and flavorful and so un-meatloaf like!!

I made with ground turkey and a spicy green chile salsa. Very good, although i ended up adding about twice as much bread crumbs, and a mexican cheese blend. I also cooked some garlic, onion, and jalapenos together and added to ground meat. About a tsp of cumin was added, as well as more cheese on top of loaf. Cooked at 375 in a loaf pan (dark coated) for about 45 minutes. Served with horseradish sweet potatoes and green beans.  I added more salsa on top, my husband used the traditional ketchup.

The only changes I made was to use three slices of fresh bread and a teaspoon each of oregano and basil in place of the bread crumbs. I used ground turkey, and it turned out fantastic. Moist and flavourful. Will be making it again!

This meatloaf is very good! I added one cup of the cheese and also had to cook a little longer as I had used ground turkey instead of the sirloin. It was moist and flavorful. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe Tink!

Very good! Instead of bread crumbs I used Pepper Jack flavored Cheez-its, and I cooked it on top of a pan filled with water to make more moist. The boys in this house killed it! Which means, Yummy!!

I didn't grow up with meatloaf, my mom never made it because she didn't like it. My husband requested meatloaf one night and I decided to look up a unique recipe. This is my go to meatloaf recipe- I have never made any other kind because everyone raves when I make this one. I use ground turkey instead of the ground beef and it turns out great, I do have too cook it a few minutes longer though. Thanks for a great recipe!

We made this as written other than adding a little extra cheese and bread crumbs.  It is an odd combination of flavors.  My nine year old rated it 0 stars and my husband said he'd be happy to never eat it again.  My toddler did like it, however.  If I were to make it again (which is highly unlikely), I'd use less garlic and more cheese.

I felt like this was the best meatloaf I ever made! It came out so tender. Great for leftover salsa. I mixed ketchup brown sugar and dried mustard for the topping, just used to it that way. It came out really good!

I have made this a few times and we love it.  Besides the cheese, I cook as directed and it turns out great every time.  Also, I use ground turkey because we don't eat beef or pork so I wouldn't know the difference in flavor.  I like how the salsa gives it flavor but doesn't overpower it.  I make it with green beans and mashed potatoes (common menu for me growing up) and there is always some leftover for lunch the next day and that's it.

WOW! This is our go-to meatloaf recipe from now on! I followed the recipe, but added a bit more medium spice salsa and minced garlic from the jar (didn't need as much), and the flavor was fantastic! Hubby wasn't hungry but when I gave him a bite, he dove in for two huge pieces!

This was an excellent recipe. I did add a small onion (chopped)and a little dried cilantro, otherwise just followed the recipe as it written. My grandson who is three years old, ate two fairly large slices. This will be my favorite meatloaf recipe in the future. Something that should be noted; It took 80 minutes to cook this (to 160 degrees)at the recommended temp.

An extremely tasty recipe.  For a little extra spice, I added one Jalapeno pepper to this recipe and 1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro.  I also spread a thin layer of ketchup across the top for a glaze.  My husband loved it.  His favorite meat loaf ever!

Tasty enough, but super easy - no chopping involved!  I used ground turkey, baked at 375, and covered the top halfway through with a little spicy barbecue sauce.  Don't think I made any other changes.  ETA:  I just made this again after a year, and am not sure why I waited so long!  Used bison this time and it was a bit mushy, but that might be because I baked at 350.  Flavor was great though and it's still crazy easy.

this is the best meatloaf I have ever made/tasted!!!  ended up using ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs 'cause that's all I had on hand.  there wasn't a crumb left - hubby, daughter and I finished it the same night I made it for dinner . . . absolutely scrumptious =)

I didn't have any loaf pans, so I made meatloaf balls instead.  I simply lined a cookie sheet with aluminum foil (sprayed with no-stick cooking spray) and placed the meatloaf balls about 1-2 inches apart.  The only thing that everyone requested was some sort of sauce to put on top...

This was really good, I stuffed it with sharp cheddar cheese. Use low fat meat, maybe crunch up tortilla chips. The salsa gave it a nice kick. I would put another egg in it, maybe add cilantro and some other ethnic seasonings.

This was really good and easy, I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs, so I crushed some seasoned crutons up and used those, same thing really. I don't think that 1 lb of meat would serve 6 people though, not in my family, more like 4 servings. I will be making this again, really liked it.

this was a simple and quick easy recipe.
with how easy it is to make it is just to tempting to add to it.
I added ounions peppers mushrooms and a spicy bbq sause called famous daves devels spit.
this adds excelent flavor without masking the flavor of the meat loaf just wait 20 min then baste it and return it to finish cooking.
if you like it a little spicer then baste it before cooking and during cooking.

I tried this as a change to the "same ol'" meatloaf. My husband liked it but I thought it was a little sour for my liking. I also thought it was too mushy. If I make it again, I think I will reduce the cheese.

Tasted great, would make again.  I subbed parmesan cheese for cheddar and I think it made it a little too salty.  I would probably decrease the amount of cheese next time.

I love this meatloaf. It reminded me of my dad's meatloaf and he was a master chef. I did put a sauce on meatloaf before putting in the oven. Ketchup, with hot sauce and brown sugar, yummy. The salsa cuts out all the chopping of vegies. I make this meatloaf about once a month. Thanks

Nice easy recipe.  Kids seemed to like it, which is always  good.  Used ground turkey and topped with a spicy ketchup glaze the last 15 minutes. (Brown sugar, red pepper, ketchup and dried mustard)  May use a tad more salsa next time to up the flavor, and this time I used parmesan but,  I think I will try the cheddar , which is probably a good idea since I use lean turkey.  I always let the meatloaf rest for about 5 or ten minutes before cutting into it to let the juices calm down so it doesn't dry out.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good. I didn't have enough bread crumbs, so I added some oatmeal to make up the difference. The salsa I had was a little spicy, so I added replaced a little bit with ketchup.

I used this as a base. I used ground turkey instead of beef, cooked rice instead of breadcrumbs, and I brushed some taco sauce on the top only because I had it on hand. I took 1 star away because of the temp change. Cooked at 375 as suggested by reviews. A very flavorful and moist meatloaf. Glad I tried it. Served with roasted potatoes, carrrots, and onions with cumin, olive oil, dried cilantro, and garlic powder

I am a very beginner cook and this was so easy. Next time I will either try and chunkier salsa or add some onions but it was very tasty!

I'm not a big fan of meatloaf, but my husband is, and this is a winner every time.  I had to cook it a little longer the first time I made it, so like other reviewers, I increased the temp to 375 degrees, and it came out great.  Even I love to eat it!

It was just a normal Meatloaf recipe.  I was expecting a bit more of a different taste from the Salsa, but it just tasted like plain old meatloaf.  It wasn't bad - just ordinary.

Oh my goodness, my family loved this meat loaf. I used Mango/Peach Salsa and if I could give it 10 stars I would. I always have to make double. Note: It freezes very well uncooked. Try it you will love this meat loaf and I have made many, this is my favorite!!!!!!! Enjoy and thank you for the person who posted the recipe...

I have made this meatloaf many times and it is absolutely delicious as is, no changes needed which is very rare.  I have made this for many people and have had nothing but rave reviews and many requests for the recipe.  I did increase the oven temp to 375 because 350 just took too long, but other than that you can make this exactly as written.  5 stars all the way.

Loved this recipe. So different from traditional "ketchup-filled" meatloaf. My family loved it and I will definitely make this one again! I cooked it on 375 for 40 minutes so the top of the meatloaf was good and brown with crunchy edges.

It wasn't a bad meatloaf- not the end all be all (otherwise I'd give it 5 stars), but tasty.  And super super easy.  My husband actually said it was good and asked if it was a new recipe.  It was very moist, but not too moist.

This was so easy and a big hit with the kids. Like other reviewers I added a bit more fresh salsa, it made a big difference. I also used Rotel diced tomatoes with cilantro and green chiles which added a nice kick. I would double this recipe next time for yummy leftovers.

This  is great. I buy the 3 lb pkg of ground turkey and make 3 loaves at a time.  Plenty of leftovers and it freezes nicely too.  My entire family loves this one. I agree that sometimes it takes longer to cook the middle then is stated in the recipe.

This was good, but nothing special.  It was cheap and quick to make, so I might make it again, but not if I'm trying to impress anyone.  I added diced onion to it, but I don't think that was enough.  More salsa might have helped.

This meatloaf was very good.  It was not hard, like some are, but was very moist.  The only thing is you really need a lot of salsa, possibly double the amount.  I used a peach mango salsa, and it was really good.  Also, I think extra cheese will add some nice flavor to it.  I will make this again.

This recipe was very good and so easy to make, much easier than traditional meatloaf.  The leftovers were even better the next day.  The only thing that I would do differently is use more salsa and put more cheese on the top when almost done to melt.  My husband still had to put ketchup on his, though.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made it exactly to spec, and it turned out quite tasty.  I recommend using extra lean beef or ground turkey to reduce the fat - between the cheese and the beef I had to "drain" it twice while cooking.

This was a very good meatloaf recipe, moist and flavorful-To make it a bit healthier I used ground turkey and it came out just as good if I would have used ground beef.  I also added minced onion to the recipe because I like the onion taste.I also added some ketchup to the top at the end of cooking for some added flavor

My family adored this meatloaf.  The only change I made was to add a packet of dry ranch dressing. Also brought the salsa to the table for dipping. It was so moist and flavorful and sadly there are no leftovers for a sandwich tomorrow!

I followed to the letter, except I baked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees and then turned up the heat to 375 for another 15 minutes.  Not the most attractive item, but very tasty.  I think for those who say it is bland, they might want to add a spicier salsa.  Ours was very good!

A very good alterative to "regular" meatloaf. I put a glaze of BBQ sauce on top while it cooked.

I opted for the turkey, for my daughter's calorie sake. Newman's own Medium Pineapple salsa, so as not too hot for the young ones. Wow! This is the first meatloaf I don't feel the need for some ketchup/brown sugar/mustard type topping, or hot sauce or peppers. I will make this again, and try some hotter stuff that isn't for kids, but again, the recipe as it is, Good! Gary

Would make it again but I think I would kick this one up a notch by using a very good Hot Salsa because of the cheese.  Maybe some sour cream on the side.  The measurements were right on the mark.  Not too dry, not too mushy for our tastes. I served it with baked potato and corn on the cob.  Oh, I did use a can of tomato sauce to pour over the top before putting it in the oven.  Sprinkled some dry parsley on the top to make it look pretty.  Thanks submitter.

great.  This is the easiest meatloaf ever, because you don't have to even cut up the onion (it is in the salsa).

Wow, what an easy yummy recipe. I used ground turkey since that is what I had. The flavors were just right for us. We all loved it. Will make with ground beef and ground turkey. Thanks for the keeper!

The salsa was a flavorful addition. I also added corn kernels for a bit of sweetness, and Scotch bonnet pepper sauce for an extra kick. I am not a fan of meatloaf but this was tasty!

Made this last night for me and my husband and we both loved it!  I chopped up some jalapenos and threw those in along with a few other spices just to add more flavor.  Will def be making this again and again!!

Awesome. I added picante because i did not have any salsa. I will no longer be using the meatloaf seasoning packs. I did add 1/2 cup of onion and green bell pepper.

This was a nice variation of standard meatloaf. Since we like pork in our meat loaf (2 parts beef to 1 part ground pork) I added 1/2 lb unseasoned ground pork. The pork also compensated for the dryness of using just ground sirloin. Since it contained salsa I added some Latin spices and served it with spicy hot Mexican rice and whole kernel corn with sauteed onion and serrano peppers.

Used ground lamb because that's what I had...  Also used Panko w/Italian seasonings for the same reason.  It was DELICIOUS.  Did cook @ 375 for a little longer but NO Complaints.  Thanks for a really good meal!

This was a fantastic hit with my family.  Even the little ones ate seconds and thirds!  I'll make this again; in fact, it's my new favorite and I might never make my "old" meatloaf again.

Great recipe when you haven't made it to the market and want something substantial for dinner with what you have on hand.  That being said - this was only all right.  I made it with turkey, which may have been the problem in itself.  But I think I will be moving on to find a better meatloaf recipe...

This was very good. I can't get Italian seasoned breadcrumbs here so I added 1t of Italian seasoning to the mix. I ended up cooking it for just over an hour at the temperature suggested. My family thoroughly enjoyed this. Many Thanks Tinkerbell15.

This was a great receipe and quick to prepare.  I did not add the cheese.  The last 20 minutes of baking I added salsa on the top of the loaf.  Everyone loved it.

I tried this meatloaf last night and it was excellent. I didn't use parsley and I used garlic salt instead of garlic cloves but it still tasted fantastic.

I am always looking for different meatloaf recipes...gives me ideas on what I can put into a meatloaf. I loved this recipe! I used ground turkey and egg whites. I also didnt use the cheese. But I added garlic power instead of the cloves and onion powder and used spicy salsa. I also put in some grated parmesan cheese. YUM! Thanks for the salsa idea!

I would call this 'ok'.  I made it exactly as written and I had a little trouble with mine falling apart when I sliced it.  Also, with the addition of the salsa, it made the meat a reddish color, which made me think it wasn't cooked all the way through.  Even though the meat thermometer read the correct temp and I knew it was cooked thoroughly, it still made me feel weird eating it.

Don't be put off by the crazy 60's looking pink meat! I hesitated to make this because of its look; however, I finally made it and boy, is it GOOD.  This is now the only meatloaf I will ever eat.  A nice spin on an otherwise dull standard.  Enjoy it!

Wow. This is awesome. I have tried probably 15 different meatloaf recipes in search of the perfect one- this one is PERFECT. It is delicious and even the kids loved it! I didn't change a thing. I also love how it actually stays in form and doesn't fall apart like all the other recipes I've tried.

It was right in front of me all along.   Salsa.  who would have thought?  I have owned and operated a restraunt and pride myself with coming up with new and exciting recipes but i could kick myself for not trying this before!  My kids hated meatloaf until last night.  I tried this recipe and guess what.  there were no leftovers!  there has always been leftovers in the past!   One thing though.  I did cook it at 375 for 50 to 55 minutes because the center was still pink.  Great recipe.  I will definitely be making this a lot more!

Fabulous!  I used ground turkey, home made salsa, and 1 tsp mediterranean seasoning, and shaped into 6 mini loaves, and they came out perfect.  Will make this again, thanks for the easy recipe!

Absolutely wonderful.  I have made this three times now, and it has turned out moist and tasty each time.  I use chunky salsa (from the store) and stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs and we love it!

This is a great recipe.  We used Hot Salsa and it gave it more flavor then the first time I made it. Also I used ground Turkey and it was still fantastic. I also sprinkled cheese on the top with a thin layer of the salsa.

Simple, moist, yummy meatloaf. Baked at 375 for 50 minutes. My husband, who is very picky about his meatloaf, liked the "kick" that was gotten by adding a 1/2 can of chopped green chilies. My oldest daughter used the leftovers to make tacos and said they were great too. Served with Mexican Rice. A delicious twist on traditional meatloaf that is now in my families rotation-thanks!

As is typical for me I read a dozen or so reviews before preparing the dish. This was a really good and quite unique version that I will continue to make. I followed a couple of reviewer's tips and added a chopped jalapeno and subbed in shredded Mexican cheese. I upped the temp to 375 and cooked it for 45 minutes then flipped on the broiler for about 5 minutes. It was wonderful. Just be careful not to over-handle the beef as you mix the ingredients ... can make the dish mushy.

I can't believe I'm giving Meatloaf 5 stars.  I've had my favorite meatloaf recipe I've used for years but reading this it sounded interesting.  What a wonderful new twist to meatloaf.  LOVED IT!  I added 1 jalapeno (seeded and diced) and added another 1/2 cup cheese a few minutes before it was done to melt on the top.  Also -  used pepperjack cheese instead of cheddar.  Everyone really needs to try this meatloaf recipe.

I made this pretty much as is and it turned out great!  Nice and juicy with great flavor!  I did have to cook it a little longer to get it done.  I also couldn't help but slather 1/4 C Ketchup, 1 T Brown Sugar, a splash of W sauce and a dash of Ceyanne, during the last 10 minutes or so. And there is no way this serves 6 people.  3 servings is a much closer estimate.  Thanks for the recipe Tink!

Come on people....why does everyone have to add and delete from a recipe???? This was a very good loaf as directed. Change it as you wish but it is as good as it is listed!!! Try it once as listed and then make changes. Thanks Tink

OMG! This was the best Meatloaf I have ever tried. I did take some of other members suggestions. I Add a 1/2 c of diced Onion, use Parmesan Cheese instead of cheddar, added 1 diced Peperoncini chili and 3 splashes of Tabasco Sauce topped off with some ketchup. Yes it was a little spicy but that's how I like things, but it wasn't too spicy just right. I upped the temp to 375 and it took a little bit over an hour to cook to internal temp of 160. I have digital thermometer and took it out when it 157 and let it sit on the counter while I was making the potatoes and by the time I was ready to cut it the internal temperature was 164.

MY HUSBAND ISN'T EASY TO PLEASE WHEN IT COMES TO MEATLOAF, USUALLY KETCHUP HAS TO BE PUT ON IT FOR HIM TO BE SATISFIED. AND I'M VERY CRITICAL OF MY OWN COOKING IF A RECIPE DOESN'T COME OUT THE WAY I THINK IT SHOULD, BUT THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE. I DID HAVE TO COOK IT LONGER THAN IT SAID, BUT WHEN IT REACHED 160 DEGREES, I TOOK IT OUT AND IT WAS SOOOO MOIST. THAT WAS THE BEST MEATLOAF I THINK I EVER HAD, AND I'VE HAD A LOT OF MEATLOAF. I DID MIX IT UP, PUT IT IN THE BAKING PAN AND PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE FOR ABOUT 1 1/2 HRS. BEFORE I COOKED IT. I WANTED THE FLAVORS TO BLEND.

The only change I did was substitute the cheddar cheese for Parmesean cheese. Other than that this was very easy and tasted great. I too added a ketchup glaze across the top. All four of my kids loved it!

This was good! We used ground venison instead of beef, and it still turned out juicy and yummy. It smelled great while cooking, too.

Yummy. I've made this before but I changed the recipe quite a bit this time because I'm on a diet. Instead of ground beef, I used ground turkey. I also added in mostly fresh salsa (nice chunks of onions and jalapenos in it), and 1 tablespoon pace salsa for more flavor. I grated onion (only a little) and one zucchini then replaced the bread crumbs with finely crumbled whole wheat bread. I used an egg white instead of a whole egg. I didn't expect it to turn out all that great but it was delicious! didn't need any cheese at all. :)

I used lean ground beef and turned it up to 375@, and cooked it for 45 minutes. Also I added three eggs and 1 and 1/2 lbs. beef. Used V-8 spicy instead of salsa, made two big loaves. Saving one for tomorrow's meal. Thanks DrIgis..

This has become a really yummy staple for my home. I like to use a hot salsa and add onion powder for a little kick.  If I'm out of breadcrumbs, I just crumble up some crackers and add Italian seasoning.  Turns out great!

I was not a fan of this. However, my husband absolutely loved it. I thought the salsa made it have a weird consistency, maybe if I had used 1.5 lbs of beef instead of 1 lb. Also, I used American cheese because that was all I had on hand.

This is an excellent meatloaf. The salsa keeps it nice and moist and flavourful. I like to bake it about 40 min followed by broiling it for 10 min to make it nice and golden brown.

Very easy recipe!! I followed the recipe exactly! I had five people to feed, so I doubled the ingredients. Then I stirred everything with a large wooden spoon and I spread it out "loaf-styled" into a 13x9" pan. I agree with others' that it smelled WONDERFUL while baking!! I used 80% lean ground beef, and boy was it greasy. I had to drain it twice!! (My fault for not using lean!) It was nice to have a change, and my family was eager to try it, yet only one person raved over the taste. I didn't care for the "moist" meatloaf, and I thought the taste was a little bland. I prefer my meatloaf basic with ketchup, brown sugar and crackers.

This is one of the tastiest meatloaf recipes I've ever come across!  Meatloaf is one of my husband's all time favorite foods, and he loved this one.  It was very flavorful, and the minced garlic added zing.  I made it with ground beef as suggested, and used medium-hot salsa.  I doubled the ingredients to make a larger loaf because I knew it would quickly get gobbled up!  I baked it in an 11"x7" pan, at 375 degrees for one hour.  It came out perfectly!

I used ground turkey instead of beef and doubled the entire recipe. Hubby liked it, but mentioned that it seemed as if most of the flavor from the salsa had cooked its way out. Next time, I'll throw in a packet of taco seasoning. I also used a very chunky salsa as reviewers recommended. I'll make this again.

Truly easy to make and so moist and tasty!  Normally, I don't like meatloaf, but this had so much flavor.  I used ground turkey and added an extra 1/4 cup of salsa and a tablespoon of diced chiles and the whole family loved it.  This will be a regular on our dinner menus.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I loved this.  My husband thought the garlic was over powering but I thought it was goreous.  I made it with turkey mince.  A real crowd pleaser.

I used ground turkey for this and it worked out well.  I liked it a lot and thought the cheese was an interesting touch.  I agree that it's a bit on the soft side, but I had no problem forming it nor getting it cooked through -- it just ended up being fairly moist by time it was done. (If people are using ground beef I can see a problem -- turkey is less fatty, but then, so is sirloin as the recipe calls for.)  I've had many similar meatloaves and this one wasn't quite as tangy, and I almost downgraded it for that, but then realized I still liked it very much.  (And perhaps this is a better "Mexican" version for those who don't like it quite as tangy.)

Interesting approach to meatloaf, but pretty good none the less.  Extremely easy even for the bachelor and better than the frozen section!

This did not disappoint!  My husband, a ketchup lover said he didn't need it.  Mixed everything the night before so I only had to shape it and bake.  Followed ingredients exactly.  I shaped it free standing like half of a basketball and baked in the NuWave Oven.  It was perfect and the flavors and texture were amazing. Definitely one of the best!  Thank you Tinkerbell15!

FANTASTIC! I will never go back to standard bland meatloaf. I altered the recipe to my taste by adding extra onion, extra diced green pepper, roasted jalapenos and CRUSHED ORGANINC CORN CHIPS in addition to the breadcrumbs. The corn chips give a more mexican taste which I love. Oh and I brushed ketchup on the top for extra flavor. I'm a substitute teacher and I will bring this with me for easy lunches to go!!

One of my favorite quick dishes to make.  Meatloaf is easy comfort food, and this dish is delicious and amazingly easy, hence the 5 stars for the simplicity and flavor it produces.  The salsa can hinder the cooking time, and make the meatloaf mushy, so don't decide to add more.  What's great is all the different salsas you can use, and your onions, tomatoes, etc are already in the salsa, skipping chopping time!

My family absolutely LOVES this meatloaf.  I make it almost exactly as the recipe indicates and it is perfect EVERY time.  I make sure to use chunky salsa (I tried restaurant style and it was too soupy) and I increase it just a smidgen.  It is a favorite in this household!

Loved this recipe! I didn't have italian bread crumbs, so I substituted with panko and used pepper jack cheese and a spicy Cowboy Caviar salsa from Trader Joes...outstanding! As others commented, had to cook 10 min extra. Will save this recipe for sure!

This is the Best Meatloaf Ever !!!. My daughter does not like Meatloaf and is a very picky eater. I convinced her to try a piece.....  2 pieces later she says " I Love It - thumbs up !!" 
Moist and full of flavor - I added onion and a green pepper to add to the taco flavor. Really came out fantastic.

This is a great recipe. I love that it is customizable, depending on what kind of salsa you want to use. I made mine with ground pork and salsa verde. I replaced the parsley with fresh cilantro and used a Mexican four cheese blend instead of cheddar. I will definitely make this again!

My husband and I made this today it was delicious 10 out of 10 we would recommend this as very successful, different alternative to plain meatloaf, I was a little skeptical as there were no onions, but they were not needed with the amount of garlic this recipe will be a keeper for me and my family. love it

This is good but to make it even better, instead of using Italian bread crumbs, use your favorite flavor of crushed up Doritos or other brand of flavored tortilla chips! Excellent!

Easy and had most of the ingredients on hand.  Used 94/6 ground beef and 2% Shredded Cheddar Cheese.  Fresh parsley or cilantro would improve the flavor, which was a little bland due to the leaner ingredients.  Did not have loaf pan, but shaped it into a loaf on a sheet of foil, then "built" sides by crumpling the 4 corners up. Bake time was a full hour and I upped the oven temp to 375 halfway through.  Will make this one again.

This meatloaf was DELICIOUS.  I cooked it at 375 for 50 minutes.  Turned out fabulous and full of flavor.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a tasty and practical way to use up odds and ends in the fridge. I attempted to make mini loaves, but they look more like giant meatballs.

Very easy to make.  I used ground chuck and did have to drain a little grease at the end.  It cooked in 45 minutes. Good meatloaf, but just meatloaf.  Nothing special.  Not spicy enough for my husband.

Wow.  this was easy and now a favorite.  Followed recipe exactly, except doubled it and cooked two loafs which each had extra .1 lb extra ground beef.

This was excellent...tasty and very moist.  I added more garlic (we're a garlic loving family), a bit more salsa, some leftover onion I had in the fridge, a little more cheese & some jalapenos...delish! Has definitely been added to the rotation, especially since we always have all the ingredients on hand!

This was delicious!  I followed other raters' tips and baked it at 375 for 45 minutes, and it came out perfectly.  I was nervous about serving meatloaf without a sauce on top, but the flavors are so good, it wasn't missed by anyone!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very delish and simple to prepare. I add about  1-2 tblspns of chopped chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and I pour enchilada sauce on the last 10 min of cooking and serve w additional enchi sauce. A BIG HIT in my house. For the side I found the spiced potato recipe on here goes well!

This was so easy to make.  The ingredients are basic things I keep on hand all the time so I loved that about it!  I made it exactly as it is written and I thought it was great!  It was moist and flavorful.  It was the first meatloaf recipe my kids didn't drown in ketchup so if it were up to me alone I would give it 5 stars but my family said it was just okay so I'm giving it 4 stars.

I thought the salsa idea, to replace the typical onion, green pepper, and tomato sauce, was a good one.  The meatloaf turned out to be very tasty, and my family enjoyed it.  I think I would avoid using salsa with a lot of cilantro, however.  Thanks for the recipe.

It may not be fair for me to give this rating as I used ground chicken instead of beef. My party of 7 disliked this dish. It was too dry and they all thought this would have been better if made with beef. So don't try this with chicken.

Great easy to make meatloaf! I made it with parmesan as one of the other folks suggested. We had leftover venison, so I made with half venison, half hamburger. Great! Salsa makes it very tangy and delicious!

Except for baking this for 1 hour instead of 45 mins, I made this exactly as written. My family loved it, even my picky eater daughter who thought it was the best meatloaf ever, especially since it has no onions (which she hates). I didn't think I would like it because of the salsa, but it was really good. Leftovers for sandwiches were good too. Thanks Tinkerbell15.

This meatloaf was absolutely fabulous.  Added the ketchup and brown sugar to the top like someone mentioned.  Baked at 350 for a whole hour.......45 mins just wasn't enough for mine to be all the way cooked.  We now have a new favorite meatloaf recipe!

I used ground turkey, red onions, celery, fresh spinach, broken up crackers instead of bread crumbs, 2 eggs and I forgot to add the cheese . . . it was DELICIOUS!!  I probably put more salsa in than 1/2 cup and I also topped with salsa during last 15 minutes. I cooked it at 375 for 50 minutes.  Even my picky 3 & 5 year old boys loved it . . . I will definitely make again . . . LOVED IT!!!

I've never been a big fan of meatloaf, but this was FANTASTIC!! I agree with a lot of other reviews that it did need to stay in the oven for about another 20+ minutes. I also added a half a Jalepeno for a little spice. It was very moist. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

Excellent! I used 93% lean ground turkey and 3/4 cup fresh salsa with Parmesan because I didn't have cheddar. It turned out very moist and tasty. We ate it plain, with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you!

I followed this recipe to the letter except I used ground turkey instead of beef and it was not good. It turned out dry and bland. Husband hated the fact that he bit into chunks of onions and peppers from the salsa. Also, you can't put ketchup on turkey meatloaf.

Definitely my all time favorite meatloaf recipe!  Followed the directions exactly and it was wonderful.  Very easy to make.  Added a little leftover spaghetti sauce on the top while cooking.

Not bad. I've made it with both turkey and beef, and I think the turkey fits the recipe better. I prefer a more Italian style meatloaf, but my husband liked this, and it couldn't have been easier to make, so it's a keeper.

This was easy to make but did not have great flavor.  However, I am pretty picky when it comes to meatloaf.  We ate it, but I would not make it again.

I made this with venison since I can't eat beef.  My husband and I do not like the traditional meatloaf, but loved this.

The best meatloaf I have ever had. I had to use egg beaters and plain breadcrumbs, but I added quite a bit of generic italian seasoning to make up for it. Seriously, this was super easy and both my husband and I loved it. I made it yesterday for lunch and we are having it again tonight. Thank you for this easy gem of a meal!

Nice meatloaf Tinkerbell. I added chopped onion to the ground turkey I used and instead of incorporating the cheese into the mix, I did the pinwheel method. I also topped the loaf with additional salsa. Moist and flavorful. Thank you!

This was good--but a little too garliky.  It may have been because I used the jarred garlic which may be a little stronger.  Will use again but might lessen the amount of garlic.

This meatloaf was easy to prepare and very tasty.  Because we like the taste of red bell pepper, I added one chopped red bell pepper to the recipe.  It turned out great.  Wonderful flavor!

I have made this recipe several times now and it is a hit! I've never found a good recipe for meatloaf without ketchup and was so happy to find this one. I've made it with hamburger, turkey and pork depending on what's in the fridge and it always turns out GREAT!!!

Made it just like the recipe except I didn't have any Italian bread crumbs so I used plain and added Italian seasoning, and I think I overdid it.  But otherwise it was good, and only took 1 lb. of meat which is a big plus for a pair of empty-nesters.  Will be making it again.

Delicious!! A family favorite. I often use ground turkey;  and my adjustments are: use 3/4 of a jar of picante sauce/salsa,  add more cheese (maybe double!), and often add chopped onions, as well as add extra clove of garlic! The extra sauce really adds to the moistness!

Great recipe!! I wanted individual portions, so I made it in a (greased) muffin tin. I also needed it to be gluten free, so I crushed up tortilla chips for the bread crumbs & it tasted great!!

This was delicious.  I didn't have enough Italian style bread crumbs so I used crushed tortilla chips.  Just threw them in a plastic bag and used my rolling pin for no mess.  The corn flavor was great with the salsa and shredded mexican style cheese I used .  I actually made a 4 lb meatloaf, using half ground turkey and half 90% ground beef and there was almost no grease.  Cooked it in a 9x13 pan.  Can't wait to make leftover meatloaf sandwiches with some avocado on top!

I love this meatloaf, l used Ritz cracker and l skipped the cheese. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9 by 13 pan for
1 hrs 10 minutes. This meatloaf freezes well.  It is so moist and tender. CFC

I made this and it was delicious! One of the best meatloaf recipes ever. I also cooked it at 375 and added an extra clove of garlic. Yum!

This was pretty good, and very easy, since I had some fresh salsa on hand.  I thought it had way too much garlic, though, so if I make it again I will probably cut the garlic in half.

I made a topping based on another review with ketchup and brown suger and it just made too much.
Easy to make and easy to change to your liking.

This is the only meatloaf I make.  Changes:  I add two patties of sausage to the mix.  I used a pineapple salsa that was amazing.  I also formed into a loaf and baked in a 13 x 9 pan instead of using a loaf pan.  It doesn't need any sauce on top (my husband prefers no sauce and it really doesn't need it).  I used Club crackers instead of bread crumbs.  You can improvise to suit your own tastes.  I really like this meatloaf!

I love this recipe. My mother is still a great cook but never made meatloaf at home. I tried for years to make meatloaf and always failed. My kids would beg me not to try it again. Until I came across this recipe a couple years back. Never fails and everyone loves it. Tasty, moist, delicious.

Yum! So good! I omitted the cheese (didn't have any) and parsley. I added a packet of sazon, onion powder, and garlic powder , and topped with ketchup! Had this with a side of mashed potatoes and green beans. I will definitely make this again.

I didn't have Italian seasoned bread crumbs so I used tortilla chips crushed as another reviewer suggested. I did add Italian seasoning. I thought it was rather bland and would spice it up more next time. I didn't have any issues with cooking it at 350 for an hour.

Very moist and flavorful.  I used ground round, doubled the recipe ( we like leftover meatloaf,) added a finely chopped jalapeño for more additional taste.
I did bake this at 375 for close to an hour. I would definitely make this again. There are so many additions you can add to make this perfect for your family.

DELICIOUS!!!!! I was doubtful but since I had all the ingredients on hand I decided to make it and it is the best meatloaf...I made a few minor adjustments such as cooking uncovered for 20 minutes then added 1/4 cup BBQ sauce then cover with foil for the remainder of the time and it turned out moist and OUTSTANDING. My husband does not like meatloaf but he loved it.

I make this  recipe quite a bit. Everyone loves it. I have cooked it both ways with beef or turkey. I also use hot salsa. 
If I use turkey sometimes I omit the egg if it's too moist. 
10 minutes before cooked I put some salsa on the top of meatloaf.  I also have family members that are celiac instead of regular bread crumbs I use gluten free bread crumbs and its delicious.

Takes about 1 to 1 1/4 hours to get done.  I used mild mango salsa at 3/4 cups since I used bison.  It would probably be best to use the double pan due to lots of juices.  I used panko crumbs and Italian herbs.

I've been following this recipe for years and we love it.  The original recipe is a definite 5 star, my way is just gluten free and fresher.  Recently, with a change in my diet, Ive started making it as follows: half ground pork and half lean ground beef mixed together. I also chop up 2 large tomatoes, half a medium red onion, a jalapeno with or without seeds, chives and cilantro then toss in a bowl with Kosher salt, ground black pepper and Cumin for the salsa base.  Add meat, 1 large egg, and instant oats (instead of bread crumbs) to the salsa.  Mix well and cook as instructed.  I don't add the cheese anymore because it feels like over kill with all the flavors already present. Top with fat free sour cream and chives.

Made this last night, and my husband and I loved it!  It was moist and delicious.  I used ground turkey, and mild cheddar.  Next time I think I will use sharp cheese, and add a little extra cheese and salsa.  Delicious!

This was a really good meatloaf. It was moist and had a good taste. My family liked it. I already have a great meatloaf recipe, but this was just as good!

This was very tasty, cooked beautifully even though I forgot the cheese. I used three kinds of salsas, cleaning out the refrigerator, dark rye bread for the crumbs with extra Italian seasoning to compensate for the lack of seasoned bread crumbs. A forgiving meatloaf that was juicy yet held together well. I'll be making it again and I won't wait until the refrigerator needs cleaning.

I divided the meat mixture into four parts and cooked them as mini meatloaves at 425. This cuts the cooking time in half. I found the meatloaf a bit bland, but I think this is the function of the salsa that I choose, which was a medium green chili based salsa. I think I will try a spicier, tomato based salsa next time.

I made some changes to this,, started with the basic, but added some chopped onion, I didn't feel that the salsa had enough in it.I didn't have any Italian bread crumbs,, dried 2 slices of bread, cut into cubes instead, used Italian seasoning with it. I also used Garlic powder instead of minced, Came out great, not mushy and not too dry. I used reg. lean ground beef. Will make again.

Tried this recipe today as printed but did add some chopped onion as my husband likes onion.  I have always had a favorite meatloaf recipe that I used but this is my new favorite.  I used chunky mild salsa & it made it so flavorful!!  Will  definitely make again.  Smelled great while baking too.

Can I just say I did not have high hopes, not because it did not sound good, but because I have been so disappointed in the past with recipes claiming to be the best ever....It was amazing...I did make minor changes...I used oats instead of bread crumbs and I added a small finely chopped onion as well as half a greenpepper also chopped fine.  I cooked in  9x13 pan freestyle and cooked on 350 degrees for about an hour....Perfect...can not wait to make now on a regular rotation instead of only 2 times a year....Truly the only recipe for meatloaf you'll ever need.

I made this recipe with Bison and it was delicious! I added an additional 1/2 cup salsa because Bison can tend to cook a bit drier because it is so lean. It was perfect! Very moist, and delicious with just the right textures!

I tried this recipe tonite using garlic flavored tomato sauce instead of the salsa and mozzarella cheese instead of the cheddar cheese.
I put half of the 8 oz can in the meatloaf along with some finely chopped onions and baked it 40 minutes. Then I put the other half of the can on top of the meatloaf with around 1/4 cup of grated mozzarella cheese on top of this. Then baked another 15 minutes. It was very good and easy to prepare. My husband and I loved it.

I made this last night and it was delicious.  I used a medium salsa and had the right amount of kick to it.  I also added a little more salsa and garlic.  I agree that cooking it a little longer at 350 for 60 minutes turned out perfect.  Served it with Spanish rice and enjoyed our dinner. My husband liked it a lot! A definite keeper and passing it on to a few friends.

Changes I made: I used 1/4 more salsa and I baked on 375 for 40 minutes. It came out perfect. I drained it before serving to remove the grease. 

This meatloaf was very good. I am not a huge fan of meatloaf but decided to try it. I think from now on I will make this instead of the ketchup drowned meatloaf recipe I am use to making.

Good.  Followed the recipe exactly except for using ground turkey.  Having said that, I shouldn't have probably upped the oven temperature and cooked it longer as per previously reviewers but it will still good.

OMG, is all my cousin said when she tried this meatloaf.. I followed this recipe as is except using ground turkey instead of beef. I also put the ketchup glaze as another reviewer suggested. Baked it at 375 for 45-50min. It was 5 stars for sure. Thanks for this delicious recipe, I know that I will be making this again.

This is a great meatloaf.  Made it exactly as written.  Cooked it in 350 oven for 1 hour.  I added a glaze made it with 1/4 cup ketchup, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and a couple dashes of worcestershire sauce.  Put it on in the last 10 min.  Made this with mashed potatoes and roasted veggies.  It was awesome.  Thanks for sharing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was a nice change from the same old meatloaf. I used PepperJack cheese instead of cheddar and just before it was done I spread salsa and grated pepperjack cheese on top. I always bake my meatloaf in a shallow pan, like a pie pan or glass rectangular baking dish. I think it bakes more evenly.

I have been making my meatloaf like this for 30 years (ever since I was introduced to salsa) & and its truly awesome!  You can make any meatloaf recipe & add salsa.
I also put it on top before baking instead of catsup.  Don't add the cheese. Personal preference.

Certainly had a good taste.  I used ground turkey and baked it at 375 degree for 45 minutes and came out perfectly cooked.  The texture was softer than what I'm used to in a meatloaf, but that's probably because I used ground turkey for the first time.  I suppose oven temps can vary, but from some other reviews I've read, it does appear the 375 degree oven is best for this recipe.

This came out super moist! Side of rice. Next time we are going to find some kind of glaze on the top for more flavour, and with scalloped potatoes!

I made this tonight for dinner, everyone loved it.  I substituted ground beef for ground turkey & added italian seasoning instead of parsley because we like lots of spice.  Would make it again

I made this with ground turkey..and it was great.  My other styles of meatloaf can be a bit dry but not this one.  Even though I cook with porpane( which hotter) I did add about 15minutes to the time.  Gonna try 375 next time.

Love meatloaf as a comfort food!  This recipe was great.  I used really hot salsa, which gave it a great flavor, but needed sour cream on the top to cut some of the spice.  I added just a bit of cheese on the top before I pulled it out of the oven.  Served this with 1/2 a baked potato and it was a delicious dinner!

FANTASTIC!  I will never make meatloaf any other way! I use ground turkey, adding 1 tbspn chopped up ancho pepper for some added heat and did add a ketchup glaze/sauce to it 1/2 way thru cooking. Super supper with mashed potato's & a salad.

I doubled the recipe using ground turkey, and used fresh salsa in the mix with jarred chunky salsa as a glaze. I used a little extra bread crumbs and 3 eggs to try to avoid "mush" in the middle, and it worked. Also, baked at a higher temp (375) for 45 mins. Two loaves fed 4 adults and a teenager with about a half a loaf to spare. I would have been happier with a sauce/gravy, though, rather than just a glaze. Moist as it was, it felt like it was missing something, esp. with the mashed potatoes. Overall, tho', very tasty; nice change from the usual meatloaf fare and healthier, too. Will definitely make again! (Gravy suggestions welcome!)

Alas!  I finally found a meatloaf the kids like.  I have tried other recipes, but have never repeated one.  I will definitely make this one again.

I used ground turkey for this meat loaf as I always do and my family enjoyed it. I on the other hand did not care for it. it did not taste spectacular to me. it was moist but not overly flavorful like when I an parmesan cheese.

Really tasty and really easy to make. I should've used leaner beef, because it turned out a bit greasy (I used 12% fat meat).

This is a great meatloaf!!!  I had about a pound and a half of meat, so I adjusted it a bit.  I cooked the second half at 370, but it was not mushy and it had a great taste.  I think the type of salsa may make the difference.  I used chunky. It is so easy, and my husband loved it.  I think next time I am going to double everything so there for later ;-) Thanks!

I made this last night for dinner...yum!  I can't make anything without tweaking the recipe, but with this one, I just followed the other readers advice and threw in some Italian seasoning blend as well as topped the meatloaf with a layer of more salsa.  Hubby said he liked it and would like me to make it again, but without the layer of salsa on top.  He said it was a little too "salsa-y".  Great recipe for a change of pace on the regular old meatloaf!  Having it for lunch to day and I can't wait!

I made this up and since I cant help but tweak things I used taco seasoning instead of salsa (not quiet as moist) onion and I snuck in some grated carrot for mr fussy. I also kept back a 1/4 of cheese and used it in extra breadcrumbs on top. Every one enjoyed

This was my first meatloaf, and I have to say it came out wonderfully.  This is now a household favorite.  I use ground turkey , and it comes out lightly crispy on the top and moist on the inside.  Thank you!

Simple to make! Helps if you have a kitchen aide mixer. Just put it in the oven when you're ready.
