These are delicious! They are moist and have an intense chocolate taste. I omitted the stevia and they were sweet enough. There wasn't enough batter to pour in a 9x13" pan though, so I just used a 8x8" pan. I cooked only 20 min, since by then, the batter was pulling away from the pan and a toothpick inserted in the center came out clean.

I'm sorry to say, but your recipe was VERY misleading. I did what you suggested, omitted the sugar and doubled the stevia. It was WAAAAAYY  to sweet! different stevias are different concentrates. It probably would've been good if I used half the (concentrate) stevia, no sugar, and about 1/2 C. honey, then maybe sprinkle the top with powdered sugar. I hope this helps. (please do not double the stevia - BAD IDEA)

This brownie recipe still turned out great despite my attempt to make it healthier.  I substituted 1:1 the vegetable oil for no-sugar added apple sauce and only put in 1/2 cup of sugar.  Also sprinkled some almond slivers on top and used extra dark Hershey's cocoa powder.  My best sort-of-healthy chocolate desert!

Best vegan brownies I've tried. I used 1/3 cup oil and 1/3 cup of apple sauce as suggested by other reviewers. I added almond and peanuts since I really love chocolate with nuts. It turned very good. Would definitely make it again.

What type of stevia powder do you use? It must be 90% fillers. With Trader Joe's stevia powder, 1/8 teaspoon sweetens a gallon of sun tea and I've never used more than 1/4 teaspoon in any baked item I've made.

Wonderful emergency brownie recipe.... few ingredients that are always in the pantry! Thank you :-) [omitted the stevia and they were sweet enough]

OMG...Better, no, no, no Best Brownies. I almost chomped my fingers off when I finished mixing the batter, lol. I did not have stevia so I just completely skipped it, & as someone mentioned, it was perfectly sweet. I also used only 1/3 cup veg oil and used unsweetened apple sauce for the other 1/3 cup. I used 1/2 cup Vanilla soy milk and 1/3 soy creamer (ran out of soy milk) and out of habit I threw in 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp instant coffee. My entire fam LOVED it. By far, the best brownies, we have made! Thanks for sharing.

Pretty good!  I altered the recipe just slightly to my tastes, but this came out pretty yum for sure! Great basic recipe with a lot of potential for tweaking! =)

Umm  this was not liked by our family at all. We were all very disappointed! It is a good try though. If I ever make it again I will need to play with it.

Best vegan brownies I've tried. I made them in the toaster oven, added walnuts and left out the stevia and they were great.

Delicious...and I even added peanut butter! Will definitely keep handy. Substituted Splenda for stevia powder and sugar and it turned out great! Less guilt, and curbs the craving!

Yum!  I omitted the stevia powder and replaced half the oil with unsweetened applesauce.  I baked them in deep 8" pie plate and baked until a toothpick stuck in the center came out with just a bit of batter on it (my thought is that the trick to making these taste their best is to underbake by just a smidge).  I cut into triangles, drizzled melted dark chocolate on top, and sprinkled with cinnamon.  Very dense and rich!

Great recipe. But, it should be clarified that white sugar is NOT vegan. White sugar is refined with animal bone char. So, for the recipe to be called vegan, it should call for unrefined sugar.

Perfect for that time of month when you NEED brownies but don't have any brownie mix. I had everything I needed in my pantry. I used 2% instead of soy as that is all I had. As suggested, I left out the stevia and it was sweet enough for me. Some people might find it a little bitter, but I love dark bittersweet chocolate. All in all, very good recipe when you need to make brownies in a flash.

This is a very good recipe, I omitted the stevia powder because I had none to use. I used almond milk instead of soy and sunflower oil instead of vegetable.  Other than that this produced a rich, chocolatey, moist brownie that stood well covered on the counter. My husband loved them. Will make this often, thanks!

I replaced sugar with xylitol exactly. Omitted stevia. Replaced vegetable oil with slightly warmed 1/3 cup coconut oil and 1/3 applesauce (per another reviewer's suggestion). Used almond milk instead of soy and gluten free flour instead of all purpose. They were pretty good, a little chewier then I thought. Next time I'll add chopped almonds.

It was gorgeous, an authentic chocolate brownie taste, and springy sponge- you could also use as a cake! 
I made a slight alteration, and used about 2/3 cup of sugar and 1/3 sweetener.
It was lovely and to be honest, nobody guessed it was vegan!

This recipe was quick and easy, but that's about it. Wasn't very tasty and certainly did not resemble brownies. Might be good for vegans, but I would assume there are better vegan brownies out there.
