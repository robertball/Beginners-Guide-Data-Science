Possibly could use a bit more mixture, it feels like I'm eating more pastry than filling! But otherwise they look good :)

This is the second time that I have made this recipe. I make it in a muffin tin instead of as a cookie. I use my hands to press the dough into the muffin tins and I don't roll it at all. The recipe makes just enough for 12 . It is a soft dough so you don't need to set aside much for the tiny top crust. I did not add rum and increased the sugar by a quarter of a cup. Halfway through the baking, I put on an egg wash. I baked them at 350 for around 25 minutes. But, you should check yours as they bake. I used a jar of Crosse and Blackwell Mincemeat from the supermarket. My husband loves them!
