I made this cake with fresh tangerine juice that I squeezed and instead of lemon extract I used Grand Marnier.  This cake is the best, very moist. I did have to bake a little longer than 40 minutes. I will definately bake this again.

I think that the "white sugar" in the 
frosting was meant to have said powdered 
sugar.

My husband and I just LOVE these as cupcakes. I did have to cook them longer 
than stated. I cook them at 350 F for about 18-21 minutes. The white sugar was 
fine. It's a "drizzle", not a frosting. I also used tangelo juice.

I have a recipe called Tangerine Orange Bundt Cake that is identical to this, it's my husband's favorite, and I've been making it for years.  I have a tangerine tree in the backyard that is overflowing with fruit right now, so it's a perfect time to make this decadent cake.  I'm sure you could make it with fresh oranges, but tangerine juice will take it over the top.  I squeezed 4 medium-sized tangerines, and baked the cake for 50 minutes.  Use a toothpick to poke holes all around the top of the cake, and be patient in pouring the syrup over the top of the cake.  Let it soak it, and then repeat until it's all gone.  This is what will make your cake so moist it'll nearly melt in your mouth.

I used tangelo juice and substituted Grand Marnier for the lemon extract.  I also added 2 teaspoons of Grand Marnier to the glaze.  Brush the glaze on in stages allowing the cake to absorb it slowly. Recipe makes 6 mini-bundt cakes plus 8 muffins.  Freezes well.

These were GREAT! My family wouldn't stop eating them!  I used fresh squeezed tangelo juice for this recipe.  I think it gave it great flavor.  The batter made 4 mini bundt cake pans sprayed with pam plus 10 mini muffins.  I did take the mini muffins out sooner than the other cakes.  I also used the tangelo juice with "powdered" sugar and not granulated sugar as a glaze.  I brushed this on after they cooled and popped the cakes out of their pans.  Next time I will grease and flour the mini bundt pans to get a better release.  The small amount of overflow batter on the edges of the panx made them a bit tougher to get out (it took some time, but I did).  Will definately make these again since they were light, moist and very tasty!

Excellent as cupcakes.  A great way to use up the tangerines we recently bought on our way home from Florida.  I baked them at 350 for 13 minutes and they came out perfect.  I'll definately make this again.

This cake was a wonderful addition to my dessert files. I served it to a group of our friends and, while I thought it was a bit dry at times, they just loved it. I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe turned out excellent!  Very moist and very orangie.  I used vanilla pudding instead of lemon pudding and vanilla extract instead of lemon extract.  I also added 1 tablespoon of orange zest to both the cake batter and the glaze.  I infused the cake with the orange glaze by taking the cake out of the bundt pan to cool, then pouring half of the glace into the bottom of the bundt pan and returning the cake back into the pan, this soaked the top of the cake in glaze.  I then poured the rest of the glaze on the bottom of the cake and down the edges while it was still in the bundt pan and let the cake soak it up.  After removing the cake I decided to create another orange icing by combining 1 cup icing sugar with a few tablespoons of tangerine juice, milk and a pinch of vanilla extract.  I then poured this into a sandwich baggie, snipped off an edge and piped it along the top of the cake in streaks (see picture).  The orange white icing looked great on the cake and tasted wonderful in combination with the orange glaze.

By using the vanilla pudding and extract instead of lemon, and by adding orange zest to both the cake batter and glaze, this gave the cake a very distinct orange flavour.

I made a bundt cake out of this and it turned out moist and light.  Good overall, but it reminded me too much of those mini cakes called "Lemon Blossoms". I believe I saw Paula Deen some too.  I followed the ingredients & instructions---only difference being that I used fresh tangelo juice (since I couldn't find any tangerines).  The drizzle was good and helped to keep the cake extra moist. I think, next time, I'll make a glaze similar to the one you would put on Lemon Blossoms (using powdered sugar &  fresh tangerine/citrus juice), drizzle it over the top, and then let it set.  I'll also try using some Grand Marnier like other reviews did.  Thanks for sharing this simple recipe!

tried this recipe today. followed directions. Just didn't find it any more moist than the cake mix suggests. I would try again with orange cake mix and orange extract for more orange flavor.
may also use confectioner sugar instead of white.

This tasted more like a lemon cake than an orange one, even after using 1 1/2 tsp. of orange extract instead of lemon. If your looking for a true orange cake, this is not the one for you. I would call it a citrus cake. I think the cake was nice. It was moist and the glaze had a nice bright flavor that imo made the cake. The bake time is a bit off and I had to bake this cake for 55 min. (using a bundt pan). Would be a nice spring time cake. :)

Did not use tangerine juice per say, but was delicious. Make sure to poke holes in top of cake for icing to run into.

This was delicious and very easy! I only used about 1/2 of the glaze, which I had to brush on. Will definitely make again.

I followed this recipe almost to the letter and it turned out great!  (The only difference in mine was I used tangelo juice instead of orange or tangerine juice.)  Instead of a cake I did cupcakes to put in Christmas goodie baskets and everyone asked for the recipe.

I tried this recipe on 02/14/11 and it was fantastic!  My cupcakes were so moist and even better the next day.  My 3.5 year old son would eat 2 cupcakes at at a time; I had to put the cupcakes out of his reach.  He absolutely loved them!  And the glaze was okay, I totally understood that it's a glaze not a frosting.  Leslie, thanks for sharing your delicious recipe!

Very refreshing.  I had to use satsuma juice, though.  The glaze was just right to top it off.

They made light and lovely cupcakes! But, if you do cupcakes, I would use a different frosting and not this glaze. Just make your own by folding the glaze into whipped cream. Tint it slightly for a light color and sprinkle on grated orange peel. Everyone loved these cupcakes the best out of the three types I served on a platter.

This cake was delicious! I could not find tangerine juice at the store and didn't have enough tangerines on hand so I used a good quality orange juice instead.  I did take another reviewer's advice and used orange extract instead of lemon. Also I don't know where people are find 18 oz cake mixes but I used a 15 oz box and it worked great.  I also topped the cake with a small amount of frosting made from 1 cup of powdered sugar, 1 8 oz brick of softened cream cheese, 1 teaspoon of vanilla bean paste and a 3-4 teaspoons of the orange juice to taste.  Will definitely make this very moist cake again!

The flavor was amazing. I tried to glaze my cupcakes a bit early and they sank in the middle but overall the taste was really good. I’ll definitely try them again.

Really easy and a crowd pleaser.   I've found that adults often prefer the cake when I substitute sour cream for the lemon pudding, and children prefer the recipe as-is.       I've also discovered that  some people prefer icing.  I have made icing instead of this recipe's glaze, and I have offered the cake with both the glaze and icing-- it has always been a pleasant surprise that this is not overkill, but it really quite popular.    For the icing, I simply whip 1/2 cup room temp butter, 8 oz room temp cream cheese,   and 4 c confectioner's sugar.     At the end, I add 3T tangerine juice and the zest of 1/2 tangerine.
