I've made this twice now and both times, they came out wonderful! I didn't have Marsala wine (or any wine for that matter) so I substituted 1 Tbsp lemon juice, 1 Tbsp water for the first attempt; then I tried it with 2 Tbsp of milk for the second. They came out the same each time. I would recommend getting 2 baking mats when baking the shells. I had trouble spreading the batter on sheets that just came out of the oven. The batter just wouldn't spread. So use 2 mats, or wait 5-10 mins for the first to cool completely.

I love this! It’s easier and healthier than the real cannoli. My husband is from Sicily but he survived this video  and he likes the healthier shells. Although in Sicily we also add a bit of cacao powder to the original dough, so you could add just a bit to this as well to get a darker brown shell, if that’s what you like.
