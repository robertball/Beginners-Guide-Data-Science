I have been using a recipe almost identical to this one for 25 years ! 
I put a pork roast into my crock pot and add the sauce( without cooking first) and cook on low until the roast
is tender but not falling apart. Add some cilantro-cook 15 min. more. Serve as a burrito filling, etc. Also excellent with scrambled eggs! I use fewer chilis, but I'm a wimp! First class recipe.

My family absolutely loved this, I wouldn't change a thing. I used canned tomatillos and tomatoes as that's what I had on hand. The sauce is very versatile and it would be a great topping for smothered burritos.  4/25/06- I had to edit the review to add that I made the sauce and poured over boneless pork chops in a slow cooker for 8 hours on low, then shredded the meat and served as tacos...AWESOME!  Family loves the recipe both ways.

Pretty good.  A little sweet for my tastes.  Instead of cooking it in 2 separate pans, I cooked the pork in a cast iron skillet, removed it when done, and added the ingredients for the sauce to the skillet.

Wonderful recipe. I put six pork chops in a slow cooker with the sauce and cooked for about six hours. The meat just fell apart and became a wonderful filler for tortillas. For the sauce I used one can of tomatillas, one jar of salsa verde, and one can of diced tomatoes as the base.  Now a favorite in my home.

This was good, but I think would be better done in the crockpot so the meat is more tender.  The sauce is excellent and has the perfect amount of spice.  Will definitely be making this again.  I might try with beef and use for taco filling.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good, pretty easy, and quick. The pork was still a little tough. It would be better if it were cooked longer. I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh, more garlic powder, and some onion flakes. Also, I used vegetable oil instead of the pork fat, which was easier and did not seem to change the taste. I used 3 chipotles and no fresh jalepenos, which resulted in hot lips and warm mouths, but no fire breath. Served it with refried beans, rice and warm flour tortillas plus toppings (sour cream, onions, etc.). My husband loved it!

Outstanding! The only change I made was to use a small can of sliced mild jalapenos, and a shake of red pepper flakes (I can't bring myself to prepare fresh chiles since I got chile juice in my eye a few years ago). The tomatillo sauce, though amazingly delicious, was still a little too spicy for me but Husband thought it was just right. I'm going to make this again but with strips of chicken breast. Fantastic recipe! Thanks so much!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because I read the reviews and actually made this with a bit of trepidation. I wasn't sure what to expect. I used tomatillos and jalapenos from my garden, but when I went to go get a tomato, it just wasn't quite ripe enough, so I used part of a can of diced, fire roasted tomatoes instead. I also threw in a tiny orange pepper that I pillaged from the garden, just for variety. I really wasn't sure what to expect. I gave my husband the first plate with a heated flour tortilla and he DEVOURED it! So I took a nibble and this is so freaking good!!! Thanks for submitting this most awesome recipe!

Fast and easy, a delicious meal.  I added one large green bell pepper, in slices, to the pan to simmer with the meat and sauce and it came out great!

WOW, This is a great recipe. I've made it twice, once for my boyfriend, and once for a dinner party. Everyone loved it, and I'm in southern New Mexico which means we know our mexican food. A native mexican from Sonora raved about it!

This is a great recipe.  I served it in tortillas.  The only down-side to this recipe is having to handle the sticky tomatillos.

This was incredible!  I used a pork roast instead, put it all in the crock pot and let it simmer all day.  I didn't have the jalepeno or red chile peppers, I chopped a half a green pepper instead, and a small red onion chopped.   I also added cumin to the seasoning.  After I dished it up, I topped with shredded pepper jack cheese, sour cream, then served with warm tortillas.  Absolutely divine!  My hubby has asked me to make this every week.  Can Do!

This was delicious, and easy to make on a weeknight.  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of a fresh one.  Also did not add the red peppers as we cannot handle too much spice.  I think I will add some onion next time to the tomatillo mixture.  Served over white rice with cilantro and black beans.  Will make again.

I followed the recipe and advice to cook this in a crockpot. The meat was delicious, but the sauce was very runny. I don't know what I did wrong. Also, some reviewers said this was sweet - my wasn't sweet and I'm not sure where the sweet taste could come from.

Fantastic and authentic!  Since my honey likes 'build your own taco' style I cubed the meat - I also added just a touch of water to the veggies at first and then drained it off later to keep them from burning, they then cooked perfectly.  We LOVED it!  I used Cisneros tomatillos which are HUGE and even with that variable it still turned out excellent.  I served the pork w/help yourself condiments of chopped green onion, chopped tomato, guacamole, cilantro & jack and cheddar cheeses.We will have this one often, it was a big hit!

My whole family loved this recipe, including picky teenager!  I left out the red hot peppers, so the "heat" was adjustable for everyone's taste by adding their own red pepper flakes.  Next time I will try doubling the sauce recipe because it was good ladled over rice/black beans with cheese on the side.

Pretty good.  I don't think it was necessary to pre-cook the sauce.  It came out fine straight from the food processor to the pan.  I loved how quick this dish was.  That's a plus.  I didn't put in all the jalepeno's either... that would have been too hot.  Overall pretty good!  Thanks for the receipe.

Not an amazing recipe but still good.  The lime taste was a bit overwhelming, so I will probably cut back on the amount of juice next time.

I omitted 2 red peppers, and only used half of the jalapenos. I enjoy spicy things while my husband doesn't. I thought that it was WAY to spicy and had very sour flavor. My husband really liked it though. I also enjoy tomatillos- but this recipe just didn't work for me. My hubby really enjoyed it- he actually asked for me to cook it again. After dumping a bunch of salt on the finished product it tasted better to me... but then I felt guilty for eating it because I was sure my blood pressure would rise :) Not sure if the tomatillos were bad or what. Prob. will not make again. Thanks for the recipe though. I hope other enjoy!

I had such high hopes for this recipe.  I went to the store and bought special ingredients for it and everything.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.  My husband's comment was "What is this? Tomato sauce?" :(  I noticed the sauce got better the longer it simmered (I simmered mine on the stove for a couple of hours), but still was missing something.  The meat was tasty though. Oh well, I might try it again, but shred it and use it for tacos or burritos with extras like sour cream and cheese.

This was really good! Slightly warm but that's how we like 'em.  I may have used the wrong dried green chilis....the recipe said "green sauce" but when it all went in the blender, it turned a light red color.  One tomato with all the tomatillos was not the cause of the color change, I don't think. Must have been the peppers. This would be good wrapped in flour tortillas or served over white rice.  Kids dipped thier chips in the sauce.

Very easy and pretty quick. I used pork tenderloins cut up into medallions for the "chops";worked very well. This made about 1-1/4 cups of THICK and SPICY "chili sauce" (I only used 1 jalapeno and only 2 dried chilis) that would be great mixed in plain rice and beans. We opted to serve just with a salad with creamy dressing (to help put out the fire on our palettes) for a healthy,low-carb dinner. Was too spicy for most young children but, I would make again.

This is just such an excellent recipe.  I had some leftover smoked pork shoulder that I used insead of the pork chops and, being a homesick Texan, I had to add a couple more serranos and a handful of fresh cilantro, but that was. You must try this recipe. Thank you so much Chriszee!

I found this to be a very good recipe but the previous chile con carne that I have had was RED and left your nose dripping with every bite (I know, ew)... So I added about6-7 more red chiles and an extra jalapeno, not seeded, and a chipotle pepper. Excellent recipe.

This was delicious! I took advice from some of the commenters and used the slow cooker on this one -- 1.5 hours on high and another 5-6 on low. I made a few substitutions with what I had on hand. I only had about 4 tomatillos so I substituted the rest with tomatoes and a roasted anaheim chili. I'm not a fan of seasoning salt, so I just left it out on this one. It was still great! The meat just fell apart in the slow cooker. I would definitely try this one again.

I agree that this was very easy, very good and in addition, authentic! Considering that everyone has a different palate, I didn't find this very spicy so next time may leave the Jalapenos seeded.

I cooked lean, thick pork chops in the crock pot all day, using two jars of green salsa as my sauce base, since tomatillos-fresh or canned-are unavailable in my part of the world.  I used the juice from almost 2 limes and close to two tomatoes.  I included only one fresh jalapeno pepper within the sauce, but put out a jar of pickled, sliced jalapenos for people to use in the burrito bar I created from this WONDERFUL recipe.  I ommitted the red peppers from the sauce, again making them available elsewhere, to allow diners to choose their own heat level.  I separated the meat with a fork when done, mixing it with the sauce.  The meat was very flavorful and oh so tender.  It was a hit!

This was a super easy recipe and the spicy fans in this house loved it.  Just remember to minimize touching the peppers!

Very good.  Perhaps the easiest Mexican Dish you will ever make.  I grill the pork first to give a little charcoal flavor.

We tried this and thought is was awesome.  My husband and I love spicy food and we ate this up.  I followed another reviewers comment and didn't precook the sauce, mine also turned out fine.  I also only used 1 1/2 dried chilis and that was plenty.  We served it in flour tortillas.  Delicious!

Great recipe, but it is HOT!  I used chipotles for the "dried red chilis."  Ii you opt for this route, cut the number of chilis used by at least half. Also, remember to wear gloves when handling chilis -- my fingers burned for some time after cutting up the peppers!

This is a great recipe.  It is simple to make too.  My husband really liked it.  And if he did then it has to be good.  Can't wait to try it with chicken.

My husband & son loved this dish.  Had a nice flavor, but I probably wont fix again unless they ask for it.  If you like tomatillos, then you will love this recipe.  Too green tasting for me.  Thanks anyway...........Have a great day!!

Not horrible, but not great either.  Much sweeter than i expected and i thought there would be more sauce to serve over rice.  Husband said it would be ok in a tortilla, but i have better meat marinades for that purpose.  I did not have to throw it away, but i wont make again.  The only change I made was to use a can of mexican spiced tomatos instead of a freash one.

Pretty good. The tomatillos makes the texture a little mealy for my taste so maybe less of that, but otherwise very good sauce.
