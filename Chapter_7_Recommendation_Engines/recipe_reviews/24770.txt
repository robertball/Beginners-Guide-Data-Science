I actually wanted a sauce to serve over asparagus and this was perfect.  I took one of the reviewers suggestions and only used 4T butter, 2T lemon juice, half the salt and pepper and less Italian seasoning than the recipe called for.  It was absolutely delicious.

Great way to add a little zing to veggies. I make these with just the carrots - no potatoes.

Very good recipe! I agree that 6 T. of butter was too much... next time I'll reduce that. My main problem with this is that I really didn't care for lemon with potatoes. Just kind of a strange combination of flavors to me. But I loved the seasoned butter with the carrots, so next time around I'll skip the spuds and mix the carrots with other veggies. Zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower... I think they'd all be great. Also looking forward to trying this with fresh herbs from the garden this summer. Thanks, Mikki!

Great potential! I used the amt of potatoes/carrots required AND I added 1 small head of broccoli chopped and a small sliced zuchinni and there was still a pool of butter at the bottom of my dish. The taste is very good but next time, I will use only 3-4 TBLS butter, 2 TBLS lemon juice, half the salt and half the italian seasoning to the same amt of veggies and all should be fine. These would be great with seafood! Will make these again!

This was a good recipe....helped me eat my carrots....LOL! I did make a few changes. First, I reduced the amount of butter and lemon juice, and did not add the italian seasoning (I don't really care for it). I boiled the carrots (because I don't have a steamer), then added the butter, lemon pepper (as suggested by another user), lemon juice, and salt, then mixed them all in one pot. They were really good. A keeper!

I thought these vegetables were good. Next time I will use a little less lemon, and more salt. I used my wok to steam my vegetables, and it was a lot less work.

Very delicious! I love anything lemon! I refused to buy Italian Seasoning so instead I searched for the recipe on this site. It was simple to make since I had all of the spices (okay, all but one) and it tasted great. The potatoes were too soft and next time I won't cook them quite as long.

I added a dash of lemon pepper instead of the plain black pepper.  It was a great recipe.  I loved it.  Great way to get more carrots into your diet when they are not your favorate.

Wow, this was really good! I really liked the addition of Italian seasoning to this, gave it that 'umph' that made it 5 star. I did 1/2 the recipe to make 3 servings. One critique, I liked the Italian seasoning but might not add that much black pepper next time, personal taste (: But I will definately make again! Thanks!

Very tasty.  The carrots and the potatoes will be unevenly sofgt if you steam them together - my suggestion is to steam them separatey and then reheat briefly in the oven.  Greens beans and zucchini would be good in this too.

This was very good and EASY!  My 4 and 2 yr old ate them up.  I did cook the carrots first so they could get cooked then added some red potatoes which doesn't take long.  They have a butter flavor with some zest.  Good summer recipe.

My husband and I were looking for a way to spice up some veggies with ingredients we had around the house.  This was exactly what we were looking for and turned out better than we expected.  The butter, lemon juice, and spices added a unique twist to normal veggies and this recipe is definitely a keeper!

These were good, although I didn't have enough time at th end to cook them a bit more in the butter.  It would have been better if I had made them a bit crunchy especially the potatoes.  Next time.

I thought this was amazing!!  The flavor is wonderful and I didn't think it was too much lemon juice.  If you are trying to eat "heart healthy," you could definitely use 3-4 tablespoons of margarine instead of 6 tbsp butter.

this recipe has great potential.  i found the lemon juice a little too overwelming; it seemed to take away from the flavor of the vegetables.  i will definitely try this recipe again, but with less lemon juice and less Italian seasonings.
