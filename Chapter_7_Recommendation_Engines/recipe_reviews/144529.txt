I wasn't sure how to cook beets on the grill, but the foil packet and timing was perfect. I actually had some fancy-schmancy blood-orange infused olive oil a friend had given me, so I sliced the beets in thin circles (and I also sliced a yam to go with it). I placed the beets in a Ziplock and drizzled some of that oil into it, and shook some coarse into it too -- shook it up, and then placed in a foil pouch for the grill. I did the same to the yam, but kept it separate, assuming it would need less time on the grill. The yam was done in 20, the beets in 30. Once off the grill, we combined them together on everyone's plate. To-die for!!

This was a good menu addition for vegetables to grill while camping.  I did add a bit of sugar to the packs so that it would really caramelize with the butter and add a bit more to the kid appeal factor.  Everyone enjoyed them.  Thank you for sharing this  recipe.

If you like beets, this is a great recipe!  Very easy to do, with great results.  My husband (a big beet fan) raved.  We followed the recipe, just w/ less beets, since we only had 3.  I was skeptical about not needing to peel them, but went ahead & just scrubbed 'em well - and there really was no need to peel them.  Yum.  Thanks!

A nice, easy way to cook beets.  Just watch the heat because the can burn easily.

The timing was off a bit for me but the beets I had may have been a bit larger.The beets I had were about the size of a small orange and they took between 45 and 60 minutes. Make sure you turn them quite often or they tend to burn. I really liked this recipe and I liked that I didn't have to peel them. I will keep this recipe, especially when I go camping.Thanks for sharing this one.

I've made these twice.  The only thing I do differently is peel the beets.  These really are outstanding, and neither my husband nor I are big beet fans otherwise.

I had some left over beets from doing my yearly pickling. They were already cooked so I tossed some XV Olive oil and a table spoon of butter in a frying pan added the beets, let them simmer for a few minutes and tossed in about 1/2 cup of bacon bits, a few more minutes in the pan to meld the flavors together and it was amazing. Even my grand children and husband ate them and NONE of them will eat the pickled beets.

Try it you will like it.

Beets on the Grill Haiku: "Very new for me, to eat beets not 'from a can', I'd do this again!" My beets were monstrously huge, so I used two, and cut them into quarters so they would be done in 30 min., alongside the chicken that I was already grilling. Flipped the foil-wrapped beets a few times to ensure even cooking. I loved them, daughter liked, husband hated, baby somewhere in b/t, but I think alot of it is just vegetable preference; beets are just beet-y, no matter how you prepare them, but I found this way to be fun, easy, and efficient enough, since I was already running the grill.

These were great! I love the grill and will try to cook just about anything on it. lol.....however i peeled and boiled them for a bit before using the grill.  It just cut down on time a bit and made sure they were not too crunchy.

Love, love, love beets and grilling them brings out their natural sweetness. Delicious! As other reviewers have mentioned I tend to use olive oil instead of butter.

I diced the beets, added toasted sesame oil (I didn't have butter on hand), sprinkled with salt and pepper and put 2 sprigs of fresh parsley and 2 sprigs of rosemary in the foil packet. It turned out great and the whole family loved them, including a 10-year-old and 12-year-old.

Great..  I added garlic (but add garlic to everything).  I also peeled them ahead of time and added some time at the end opening up the foil to get them a little charred.  My wife says it reminds her of grilled corn??

Another time I marinated these in balsamic vinegar overnight and topped with goat cheese. Not worth it but does switch the flavor up a bit.

Fantastic. We added the greens also. We ate the skins and all. They are very very thin and have nutrients so why not. We like the roasted taste very much. My teens loved them.

My husband is in love with doing beets on the grill now. Since I had two softball sized beets I ended up cutting them into huge chunks and I added some chopped peeled carrots.  I'm not a huge fan of beets but I even had to say these were pretty good! I just made sure I kept flipping the packet so they wouldn't burn. Next time I might try adding some of the different herbs as other reviewers have stated.

"These are the best beets I've ever had."  That's a quote from the folks who ate them after I cooked. (Sorry, I enjoy growing them and don't mind cooking them, but I'll pass.) I used garlic infused cooking spray, butter, salt & pepper.  I sliced them, but kept the slices thick - 3/8 inch, probably.  Well cooked at exactly 30 minutes with frequent turning.

I did these beets with a double layer of foil on the grill.  I accidentally left them on for FOUR hours !!!  They are absolutely delicious!  This has to be a foolproof recipe!  I used EVOO.  The heat was on low for about 2 hours, but it still read 400 degrees.

Wonderful!  I uses"sweet beets" that I got at the local farmers market.  Next time I will try olive oil instead of butter and add a potato, turnip, and carrot.  Yum.

Absolutely fantastic!  Used Parkay butter spray, salt, pepper, and garlic powder, wrapped my smallish sized beets in foil and threw it on the grill, indirect heat for 50 minutes.

Great way to prepare beets.  I'm the only one in my family that will eat beets.  Therefore, I enjoyed the entire bunch!  So delicious just seasoned with the butter, s/p.  Thanks Mottsbela for sharing.

To me this is an awesome way to make beets in summer, you don't need to heat up your kitchen.  They came out great on the grill. I use half the grill for the beets and grilled spaghetti squash on the other side.  I'll definitely do this again.

What a great way to cook beets. No fuss and no red stained hands from peeling!  While the peels were completely edible, I think I would have preferred this dish if it didn't have the skin on.

I nixed the butter and just sprayed both beets and foil.  The grilling adds a delicious smokiness and is perfect for bringing out the beets' natural earthy sweetness.

I love beets. Didn't believe this simple beet recipe would work. Decided to trust all these favorable reviews. Nothing fancy just sprayed PAM on foil, wrapped and roasted at about 500 on my gas grill. Seasoned with sea salt and my-oh-my was I impressed.

This recipe was excellent! I used golden beets, peeled them and olive oil rather than butter.  Timing was perfect, the beets were tender and flavorful! The kitchen stayed cool and I was grilling anyway so this was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!

Since we are experimenting with grilling all our veggies lately, I typed in "grilled beets", not actually expecting to find any recipes.  I am so glad I did! Tossed sliced beets with Trader Joes's garlic oil, sprinkled with sea salt, wrapped in foil, and put on the grill for 20 minutes. Simple and delicious!

I've never made fresh beets and this seemed to be the perfect recipe! Very easy to make but my beets were large and took quite a bit of time on the grill (probably an hour to get soft).

This is the only way I cook beets! Sometimes I use butter, sometimes oil...I happen to sprinkle mine with herbs, particularly Penzey’s Mural of Flavor which is my go to herb when I don’t know what to add. And it tastes Awesome on the grilled beets!

This works perfectly well if you have beets of similar size and are using the grill anyway. It isn't any different than doing it in the oven.

Best way to make beets!  Used olive oil instead of butter.  Also works great in oven when grilling season is over.

I had a bunch of four medium sized beets, had them on the grill about 30 minutes and they were cooked.  Added Feta cheese to them after taking them off and unwrapping slightly -- then quickly closed up again until serving time, the feta made a nice compliment to the sweet of the beets.  Will def do this again!

It took less time to cook when it was chopped into cubes first.  I added other vegetables like potatoes, zucchini, etc. to the foil package before cooking. I liked it better having a variety of vegetables instead of just the beets. Old Bay seasoning was good on it too.

Delicious!! so easy and worry free. Neither my husband nor I had ever had fresh beets. We grew up on those canned beets. Ugh!! I wish we had tried fresh long ago.
Depending on size can take longer than recipe states. worth the wait.
