I make a very similar salad with the addition of pitted Kalamata olives, sliced or any sliced black olive of your choice.  Drizzle the dressing on the salad just before serving so that the fennel remains crisp and crunchy.  This is a very textural combination of crunchy fennel and soft, juicy citrus segments with the smooth oily dressing.  I usually serve this at our family Thanksgiving meal.  It really compliments turkey or any poultry.  Thanks for including this recipe.

Excellent recipe. My father loves this and he's a picky eater (one the the few salads he'll eat).

I didn't like this one.  I prefer my fennel salad to be more vinegary as opposed to sweet.  This one was sweet and I didn't like it.  I prefer olives/capers instead of oranges.  Just personal taste though, but thanks for the recipe.  I picked out the oranges from the salad and drizzled it with lemon juice and added capers.

I didn't know what to expect. It's a light and simple salad, but not one I see myself repeating.

Hubby and I really enjoyed this!  It was a easy and tasty way to use fennel.
