This was a fantastic recipe!  It was easy, tasty, and colorful.  I only made a few changes, regarding sweetness.  I reduced the soy sauce to two teaspoons, because I felt it to be too overpowering.  Also, I added about a teaspoon or so of white sugar (again, because of the soy sauce), and a few spoons of extra mayo.  For color...  I was definitely not shy with the dill, I added quite a bit extra.

I was disappointed with this recipe. Soy sauce does not go well with this dressing. It's too salty and smell !

This dressing was easy and delicious.  I used only 1 T of soy sauce and a little less dill.  Was great over greens w/ dried cranberries and walnuts!

Excellent recipe! Although I was not brave enough to add the entire 2 TBS of soy sauce.  I added only 1 tsp.  As good as any restaraunt dressing, and so easy to prepare! Can't beat that.  Next time for more kick will probably use a dijon mustard.

I made this today to accompany my cajun chicken, swiss, and bacon sandwich and it was delicious!  I mixed creole mustard and yellow mustard together for a great combination. I will definately try this again.

I used this on a spinach salad and it was very good.  I used some leftover sauce on my chicken and it was great with that as well.  I even left out the mayo to cut out the fat and it still worked well.

I used only 1/4 cup light mayonnaise and no soy sauce.  This was delicious.  My 4-year-old used it as a dipping sauce for her chicken nuggets.  The dill gives is a nice look.

Do yourself a favor and skip this one. I like soy sauce, but amount in this recipe (2 T) was completely overpowering. A lot of doctoring didn't help much. Also, I don't think dill goes well with the other ingredients.

This dressing was so easy and it is the only one that I have found that tastes like restaurant quality.  The consistency is perfect...not to thick or to thin.

I used this as a pasta sauce and tossed with bow ties and chicken and my boyfriend has been begging me to make it for him again ever since. I reccommend using fresh dill, because when I did it turned out simply divine.

Very tangy!  I huge hit at a group dinner.  I used a little less soy sauce (not a big fan) -- pretty healthy, too! Definitely recommended for honey-mustard fans everywhere.

My husband took me out to dinner one night. I tried the house dressing which was a Honey Mustard. Loved it so much I purchased a bottle at the food store. Didn't taste the same. Made this dressing for our dinner salad tonight, it was a big hit with the family. Thanks so much for posting your recipe!

I used this as a dipping sauce for homemade chicken tenders. Wonderful although not as thick as regular dipping sauce, but just as flavorful.  I will use the remaining sauce as a dressing.  Excellent light consistency.

Made this tonight to use as a dipping sauce for an Alice Chicken recipe from this site.  The two were amazing together.  Even my husband raved about it and said this was a keeper.  I did not add the dill but used everything else.  Will definitely be using this dressing everytime I make the Alice Chicken.

Delicious, fast, and appetizing. The dill is great with this. Used dijon mustard for extra flavor and used 1 TB of soy. Really like this - will be one of my regular dressings. Thanks for sharing!

I usually buy the Clemente Jaques Honey-mustard dressing, I think it has been discontinued, could not find it anywhere. So I searched for an easy no fuss recipe. Had some friends over for lunch, and this dressing was a home run...used it over a spinach, mandarin, cucumber, red onion salad. both of my girlfriends wrote down this recipe.

Have I reviewed this yet? Even so, it's good enough to review twice. I've tried to find something similar to a favorite salad I have at a local restaurant and this is it! SO good -- I had never made honey-mustard dressing and had no idea that I would put soy sauce in it, but it is perfect. The salad I love is a spinach salad with bacon, and this dressing is wonderful with it.

OMG you MUST use this for BBQ chicken!  BF made this to use as a marinade/sauce for BBQ chicken breasts a few weeks ago.  Absolutely delicious!  I'm making it tonight again to baste my chicken breasts with it....haven't tried it as a salad dressing yet, but I'm sure it would be yummy.

This was a good salad dressing - I read the previous reviews and made several adaptations. I halved both the mustard (I used Dijon) and the soy sauce, omitted the garlic powder and used fresh dill weed (about 3/4 tsp chopped). It was tasty, and with the changes, a 'make again'.

With a few minor changes, this has become our all-time favorite dressing/dipping sauce.  I use low fat mayo and only 1 tablespoon of reduced sodium soy sauce.  Also by varying the type of mustard (regular prepared, Dijon, spicy brown, etc.) each batch tastes slightly different--we like Dijon best.  Very simple and absolutely delicious!

This was very good!  I have tried many jarred sauces and would say this tasted so fresh.  Next time I will cut back on the vinegar a bit more.

This is my new favorite salad dressing! I have stripped out the calories and fat too with my alterations, and it's delish. Eliminate the mayo and honey, and instead add 1/3 cup of sugar free Walden Farms pancake syrup and 1/4 cup water. Perfect and tasty option for a diabetic!

Ohhhh! This was good. Worried about the other reviews, I poured the 2T of soy sauce into a container and slowly added it to the dressing, stirring and tasting as I went. I only got about 1T in there, and it tasted great to me so I stopped, but it might have been even better with more, I'll have to try it with the full 2T sometime. Wonderful dressing.

Good...except for the soy sauce! There was MUCH too much soy sauce for my taste; it overpowered the honey mustard flavor. I wouldn't even use half the amount called for. But I will make this again with significantly less soy sauce because otherwise it was very good.

Great, as is! Maybe a teeny bit less soy sauce but the soy sauce is what gives this dressing a sweet kick.

I liked this a lot...the soy sauce gives it just enough of a different flavor to stand out from others...I used Dijon Mustard and put together a salad of romaine lettuce, halved red grapes, garlic croutons and cashews.  An odd combination, I know, but it worked well!

Wow, this is so good and easy to fix.  I love that it is healthy for us too.  This recipe is a definite keeper.  Please make this instead of buying the dressings off the grocery store shelves.  Almost all of them are chock full of MSG and it is so bad for you.  Save your kids from eating MSG and make this dressing instead.

This was great!  I left out the soy sauce as I did not have any on hand, and I only used about 1/2 the Mayo (ran out) a little on the runny side, I'll add more to what's left over tomorrow after getting to the store.

All in all, this recipe was good and very simple to make. The soy sauce adds an interesting twist, but the dill weed was a bit overpowering.  Next time, I will use just a pinch of the dill weed.

I used it for a potato salad. Everyone really liked it. One person asked me where I got it. I told her all recipes .com!

So I gave this four stars only because I modified the recipe quite a bit.  I only used honey, Dijon mustard, and mayonnaise.  I left everything else out. This was really more of a guide.  My honey mustard turned out wonderful.

This is fabulous and I make it all the time.  It's nice b/c you can be sloppy with the measurements; they don't need to be exact.  This saves me a lot of money b/c I used to buy the high-end refrigerated dressing all the time.  Haven't done so since I discovered this gem.  Thank you!

very good dressing. I took the advice of others and only added 1 tsp soya sauce.  I used a combination of 3 mustards; regular, dijon & sweet onion mustard.  MMMmmmm good! Thanks for posting

Amazingly delicious! The only changes I made was to add only 1 tsp. of soy as other reviewers suggested and used spicy brown mustard instead of regular.

This is strange but okay. I will eat it and enjoy it, but I don't think I will trip over myself to make it again.

Pretty good.  I think I'll try a few other recipes before deciding on my favorite.

Nice! Flavors were just right for me - I scaled recipe to 4 servings and didn't change a thing other than to cut back on the dill (not a big fan).  Great as a dressing to add a little zip to my wrap.  LOVED the addition of soy sauce.  It's a keeper for me.

Excellent taste - I love honey mustard dressing and always have it on my salad. Now I dont buy them anymore.

The smell was bad. The soy sauce gave it a bad taste.
