should be very good.  Is similar to the old stand by from my long dead grandmother. I usually add some garlic, bay leaf, and a bit of oregano. sometimes a cube of chicken bouillon.   If you sauté the onions  and other veg before adding the peas, you can reduce the time by using a pressure cooker for 15 minutes after bringing pot up to 15 pounds of pressure (high) for twelve minutes, and allow pressure to reduce slowly.  If the peas are old, you ay need to put pot back on and cook a little longer, but as pot is hot, it wont take long to return to pressure.  All in all, however you make it, nothing beats split pea soup on a cold Canadian winter's day.  tomorrow I hear, should reach a high of minus 27 C. soup will be on the stove or in the pressure cooker to save electricity.

Ah, it's been a long time since I've found a true 5-star recipe.  This was very, very good.  I was looking for something close to Habitant Pea soup - this was much better, more like what 'ma mere' makes.
I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.

Omit the salt, that is way too much and ham is already very salty. People can add it in their own bowl if they want more. Obviously you need to leave the ham bone in during the entire cooking process or you will not have any substance or flavour to the stock. I needed almost twice as much water to cover my ham bone, my ham was not that big so I'm not sure about the measurements for this recipe, be forewarned. I used 4 cups of yellow peas (the entire bag).  I took my ham bone out after 3 hours, removed what meat was left on it along with the large chunks of ham that had already fallen off. I removed excess fat and roughly chopped and shredded the ham and then returned it to the pot and then added the carrots and let it simmer on low-medium for 45 additional minutes. If you do what the recipe says and add the carrots at the beginning, you risk the soup burning and sticking to the pot because the sugar content in the carrots makes it more likely to stick and burn. Also, diced carrots will nearly disintegrate after cooking for 3 hours. If I had not been paying attention, the soup would have burnt as some peas and carrots had already started sticking to the bottom of the pot even with all of the fat from the ham.  I did not use thyme since I don't like it. I used 1 tsp. of cumin instead and skipped the bay leaf as well. I did not add salt as the ham already had a high salt content. I threw in a small handful of peppercorns and removed most of them at the end. I would not use this

My parents were both French Canadians and my mother always made pea soup with the yellow peas. She always said they're sweeter than using green split peas, I agree. I've made this soup in the same way for years whenever I've had a ham bone left over from a holiday. The only difference between my recipe and this one is that I use sweet basil instead of thyme. This is a hearty and satisfying soup.

This is a very old recipe that they use in Quebec during the maple syrup season.If you visit one of their sugar shacks during the spring this will be on the menu. My husband's grandmother who is Quebeciose had this recipe from her great grandmother who lived during the 1800's. I would omit the salt becuase it is too strong with the ham bone and I had a packet of chicken stock to my soup but it's good on it's own.

Good soup recipe.  I bought a ham and had a bone to make fantastic broth with.  I had cooked the ham bone with herbs, onion, garlic the day before. I already strained the broth and had cut up ham meat in tiny pieces.

I then found this recipe.  I was able to make it very quickly because I already had a flavorful broth ready.

My men gobbled it up so that tells me it was delicious.  I just need to disclose that I made broth one day and made soup the next so that could have intensified the flavors?  

Anyways, I would absolutely make this again.  The entire pot was empty in one day as my guys came and went to and from their shift work jobs.  I was shocked the next day when I realized the entire pot of soup was all gone.  So if you want soup for lunch the next day, set some aside for yourself.

This was without a doubt the best pea soup we have ever had.  My husband and I grew up in Québec where pea soup was a staple every Friday.  I did cut back on the salt, I only used 3/4  tbs and a full onion.  It turned out nice and creamy and extremely tasty.  I highly recommend it.

This is exactly how I remember split pea and ham soup. Very French and extremely delicious! I agree, you don't need to add salt - the ham is salty enough. I also add a few cloves of garlic.

I had a ham hock, but used exacts for the rest of the recipe. A lot of promise here if you omit the salt. This is probably a five star without the salt as it is the perfect consistency and everything smelled great. Also, I only needed 2.5 hours of cooking.

I’ve used this recipe numerous times. I add more liquid, at least another cup or more as needed. This soup is beautiful. Near the end prior to serving, I add a tablespoon or more of vinegar to bring all the flavours together. So simple, so good.

Grew up thinking I hated pea soup.  Apparently I only hate other pea soups, this one is fantastic.  Save lots of meat on the bone to make this extra meaty.

Put in less split peas, more ham and veggies and added some "better than broth" chicken soup base.  Very yummy.  My son-in-law said it was better than his French-Canadian grandmother's soup!

Great Pea Soup and I like it better than Habitant.  I am an American/Canadian living in Canada and this is as good as it gets. 
Only changes I made are:  no added salt, and was out of thyme so added a few different spices.  I used Chicken broth rather than water.

Used leftover Easter smoked ham bone and this soup is so delicious. So simple to make, the hardest part is waiting 3hrs to eat it! Tasted this first time in Quebec City and this is just as good!

I make this all the time, but use a Smoked Pork Hock in place of the ham bone.  I also change the thyme for savory.  You are fortunate not to get Habitat Pea Soup, its loaded with salt.  I know because I'm a Canadian, and that is one of my Husbands favourites.  However I tend to eat a fair bit of the pork hock before it makes it to the soup.

So  yummy! Should have soaked the peas first! Recipe doesn't say too, but most pea soups require you do & there is a good reason for that! Peas were a tiny bit hard, otherwise delicious!!

Excellent as written.  When I am lazy I use 3 cans Campbell's French Canadian Pea soup and dilute with my ham stock...otherwise I use the same Veg and herbs as in this grand recipe.. omit salt. Boil ham bone for an hour or more with a few roughly cut pieces of onion and celery [garlic if u like] strain broth and use as a concentrated flavor base. use leftover ham chopped and add with veg. I don't saute the meat and veg..cuts down fat.  Simmer it all till veg is tender.
Takes half the time as the channyharte terrific recipe.  Mom used to make it
 this way to feed kids quicker...Yum!

This is my go to never fail recipe for pea soup. I’m canadian and was partly raised on wonderful Habitant brand pea soup, and this is better. I cut back on the salt, but other than that stay true to recipe. It’s easy to play with if you want to modify it to suit your tastes. Very forgiving.

A good pea soup is a work of love, and this is outstanding!  Bay leaves go into nearly every soup or stew I make, so don't skip this.  I like more carrots.  Some folks like pea soup thick, some thinner; more/less salt, or pepper?  Adjust recipe seasonings to your own tastes, obviously. I've made this with a big, smoked turkey leg..awesome.   Thin it with water when reheating, if you like.  Left overs are great and this soup freezes well too.  MAKE THIS PEA SOUP RECIPE!  I was impressed.

I love a good pea soup and this recipe does hit the mark!  I like to boil the ham bone the day before with onion and bay leaf
and let it cool in the fridge so I can skim off any fat.

This was terrific. Simple too.
The only change I made was there was not much meat on my ham bone, so I cut up chucks of leftovover ham - maybe a couple of cups worth - and added that.
Served with a cornbread box mix. 
Yummy.

Excellent made overnight in a crockpot (8 hours on low). I used 2 smoked ham hocks, totaling around 3.5 lb with the bones. Howevery I added NO SALT. Ham hocks are usually very salty to begin with. 2 tablespoons of salt would almost certainly make this dish inedible. A typo? Even if it was supposed to say 2 teaspoons, I suggest cooking with no added salt if there is any salt in your ham, and seasoning if necessary after cooking.

Made exactly as written until the end...I like it a little bit thinner so I added more water throughout and at the end.  Flavor was still great! I had never used the yellow split peas before and I think it's pretty similar to green but I may not eat them enough to notice a difference.  Either way it's enjoyable and I will make this again for sure.  Thank you!

Excellent taste.  Even the kids liked it.  Wouldn't add salt as the ham adds the salt flavour.  Will make this again and again.

Great flavor. As long as you use the ham, you can leave the salt out totally. The ham adds flavor and salt all on its own. Used an immersion blender to finish off.

This is basically how I have always made it.  Excellent, healthy soup. I leave out the celery as I don't care for the flavor, just a personal preference.  My biggest problem always is finding yellow split peas.  The stores in my area seldom have them on the shelf.

I added a couple of potatoes and a smoked pork hock as well as a " ham steak". DELICIOUS.. You could also add a turnip or parsnip which would be good as well. Comfort Food for sure, any time of the year.

Great soup. Kept almost all the salt (1.5 tbsp,) added a little more pepper and subbed green apples for the celery since I didn’t have any. Very much like Habitant pea soup as advertised.

Loved it. Thanks. Brought back the taste of the Netherlands that we so much miss after spending so many years living there. I looked around the kitchen and did add some bits and pieces of greens in our fridge; leek from our garden and a small slab of smoked bacon. Thanks so much!  Marc

We loved it.  I used a ham steak, cut in cubes, since I didn't have a ham bone.  Surprisingly, the soup was ready to eat in under two hours, even though I kept the heat at a simmer and had the lid barely tilted to let a little steam out, as the recipe instructed.  I left out the salt, since so many reviewers said it made it too salty.  I guess my ham wasn't salty because I had to add ham to my bowl as I ate it!  This is a very easy recipe and makes a big pot, so we'll be enjoying leftovers for awhile.

Absolutely delicious with a few observations:
1.  Many commented on salt so I added none to start, figuring I could always add some later in the process.  I don't know whether my ham was saltier than some or if it's just my personal taste - but I never ended up adding any salt and thought the result perfect.
2.  I noticed pictures of the finished soup showed some large pieces of carrot that clearly hadn't started three hours earlier as diced carrot.  Rather than dicing all four carrots, I sliced one and added it about 45 minutes before the soup was done.

The soup was delicious and easy to make. I replaced the Spanish onion with a  yellow onion, and added some oregano, too.  Lastly, I used two boxes of Swanson chicken broth instead of water. When I reheated it later, I added additional water to the soup because it became so thick. It was still wonderful! I will definitely make this again.

I will definitely make it again but without the carrot...it changed the colour of the soup while not enhancing the flavour in any significant way.

This is delicious and my family loved it. Better than Habitant. I will put a little less salt next time because the ham is also very salty.

Great soup! I skipped the salt altogether, and didn’t have to add any when finished, but my ham was smoked and I baked the bone and meat a small amount before adding.

Absolutely delicious and a close [but better] version of Habitant canned soup. I added a couple of Poblano peppers and a heaping teaspoon of Coleman's dry mustard, but I like my food spicy; not recommended for everyone.

Easy & tasty. A little too salty, could have been a particularly salty ham bone, but next time I will add salt later rather than at the start. I am a French Canadian, this soup was exactly what I was looking for. I'll make it again.

I would have to say this is one of my favorite soups! Having spent a bit of time with people from the Acadian region of northern Maine I grew a deep appreciation for their foods. This recipe allowed me to make something special and delicious from that experience! Thank you! 
P.S. I cheated and used a ham steak and it made the soup meaty and smoky! I’d eliminate a little salt though due to the extra ham.

Yes , I added Tyme, lemon juice, marjoram, sugar, nutmeg, parsley flakes. I also added a ham bone from a ham I double smoked.  I added some chicken base also.

If you never had yellow pea soup, try it.  The taste has no relationship to green pea soup.  Its a little closer to squash soup.  I have made gallons of this stuff.  I love the surprised look on peoples faces the first time they try it.

Today will be my third time using this recipe in under 6 months. I do tweak this recipe a tiny bit every time I make it, but that's how I use recipes.

This is a really excellent recipe for a really lovely soup.

This was FANTASTIC!  I wanted to make soup with our leftover Easter ham bone in my Instant Pot.  I reduced the salt to 1 Tbsp and used half chicken broth & half water, pressed the Beans/Chili setting (45 mins).  I've never tried yellow sweet peas before and it was a nice delicate flavor and texture - will be making this again.

Excellent soup and this recipe is like the one my mom and grandmama use to make (both from Quebec).  Added minced garlic, and a dash of cayenne because that's the way my mom and Grandmama did it.

I only gave this recipe three stars because I added and changed a lot. I used chicken broth instead of water, I also sauteed the onion with a pound of sliced mushrooms before adding to the soup. I omitted the salt and used a chicken bouillon cube. I had leftover boneless dinner ham and cubed it. I also used the celery heart and leaves, not just the stock, and also added a diced red bell pepper. I simmered for a couple hours and it turned out delicious .

This was delicious!! Whole family loved it, including two toddlers. This will be our go to recipe for pea soup. The only adjustment I would make is to double the recipe for even more soup. It didn't last long here. So good!
Update: This works beautifully in my instant pot! 45 minutes on soup/stew and it's ready. No changes to the recipe, easy peasy. Make a double batch, great leftovers! Sometimes I make it without ham if I don't have any and it's still delicious. I add in some chicken bouillon, careful with the salt, you can always add more later.

I added a bit of chicken stock for additional flavor .  once peas were soften I blended 2 plus cups of broth mixture to make a more creamer base.

This was great.  Made a few minor changes:   I forgot to buy yellow peas, so used green, and I actually like the colour better.  Didn't have a ham bone, but had leftover bite sized pieces (say a pound or two) in the freezer from our Christmas ham.  Used maybe a 1/2 teaspoon of salt at most (plenty comes from the ham).  As some others recommended, used 4 cups low sodium chicken broth, 4 cups water.  After simmering 2-1/2 hours, I removed about 1/3 of the soup, blended with immersion blender, and poured back in.  Simmered for another hour for good measure.  Fantastic results - will make this again!

I would make this again. I don't usually make pea soup but this one  is hearty.  I guestimated the ingredients. I used a whole onion and used up the celery I had. I measured the spice in the palm of my hand and it all worked out.

I have always loved pea soup, but my husband had never liked pea soup until I tried this recipe. I followed others advice and did not add salt. I also reduced the peas so that it was not so thick. I am happily adding this to my winter soup list.

I ended up with about 10 cups of water to get the consistency I wanted. I added a couple of cloves of garlic and two small potatoes diced with the ingredients.  I used a ham bone with a fair amount of ham on it as the base. I also added a dash of Worcester sauce halfway through cooking. Best pea soup ever.

Oh, I so wish I paid more attention to the reviews... When I added 2 tablespoons of salt, I said to myself.. That's a lot of salt and it sure was!!  Fortunately, I was able to take out 4 cups of the soup water and then replace it with another 4 cups of regular water...  I made this in the crock pot over night and woke up to  yummy and delicious smells...  I added a little sherry and some garlic to spice it up a little...  I don't think my family would have eaten it as written....  Way too much salt...

Really Good,
Used unsalted vegetable broth 4 cups and 4 cups unsalted chicken broth with 3cups water. I like the cut up veggies also added 2cups frozen peas. If you like a thicker broth scope out half the veggies and use a blender to remaining broth.

Turned out very well, easy soup to make, tastes amazing. I puree it once I take out the ham bone, next time I will def adjust the length of time  I pure for.  As with any soups, always tastes better next day.....

This was a great base. I used everything but has no ham bone. So I used vegetable stock instead and added my leftover ham. I chopped the other vegetables really small and sautéed them a bit before adding the stock and then simmered everything for 3 hours. I didn’t even have to blend it at all to make it more creamy. This is definitely a keeps. My family loves it. Thank you!!

This soup is AMAZING and so easy it's silly. I used all the ingredients except the bay leaf and thyme (only because I didn't have any) and salt which I added later to taste.  I cooked it covered in the crock pot (because I'm lazy) all day on low though I did turn it up to high for an hour in the middle of the day to push it along.  I had to add some extra ham at the in the last hour because there was not much on the bone.  I didn't add salt till the end only because my dad once made split pea soup with too much salt and I didn't want to face that problem. I set the lid ajar near the end until it hit the consistency I was looking for.  So simple, so good, my house smelled heavenly all day long. A real keeper!

I think the amount of salt indicated must be wrong. I made this with only half the salt listed and it is still way too salty. The soup is very good but the salt is just too much. I would suggest to others to only add 1/2 to 1 tsp and then add more to taste if necessary.

Made a double recipe exactly as written, except I added some basil too. Best soup ever! Hubby couldn't get enough. Now we have leftovers in the freezer to look forward to!

This soup turned out great! I didn't have a ham hock and just used smoked ham I had from leftovers. I was worried there wouldn't be enough flavor but it turned out great with tons of flavor. My 1 year old loved it too!

I added a 1/3 cup of Frank's Red Hot. This soup is fantastic. Way better than Habitant's.

I make a triple batch about twice a year, and jar it. Love it! Thank you for sharing.

Good enough.  My family wasn't so into the thyme taste.

Went down really well with all my family, used ham stock as a replacement of the ham bone, and added left over ham. Will definitely make again.

I think you've pretty much nailed it here.  This is the real stick-to-your-ribs thing!  Well done.  I didn't have the ham bone so sub'd chicken stock for half the water.  Still very tasty.  Didn't use nearly the salt called for - is that a typo?

I made as per recipe but left out the salt after reading some reviews. My ham must not of been salty because there was not much flavour, so I added the salt and reduced it a bit more and it turned out fine!!  You can always add salt but you cannot remove it, so I would leave it out until the last 30 minutes after tasting it.
