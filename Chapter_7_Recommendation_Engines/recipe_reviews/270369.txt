I had the most amazing onion soup in Florence and I've been scouring Italian cookbooks for the recipe ever since.  This is it!!!  My friends could not imagine onion soup with almonds when I described it.  I made this recipe exactly as directed with the bit of cinnamon and it was perfect!  I'm serving this at my next dinner party. It is so much more interesting than french onion soup. Thank you for posting this recipe!!!

Do NOT go into making this if it is just before dinner time.  Taking the time suggested by Chef John is well worth it to produce a spectacular soup.  And if 4 pounds of onions seems like too much -> wrong!  They cook plumb down and are deliciously sweet with the seasoning.  The crusted bread topping was delicious and built to impress.  I would not have thought of sage but was delighted with the result.

This variation from Chef John is spot on for authenticity. Follow his directions and you'll enjoy the forerunner of French onion soup. The subtle hint of cinnamon and sage are contrasted against the sweetness of the oh-so-slowly cooked red onions. Watch the video and he'll tell you that for photo opportunity he placed the toast on top of the soup. Traditionally the toast is placed in the bottom of the bowl and the hot soup is poured over. To make it super authentic, top the bowl of soup with a gently poached egg. Thanks Chef John for another great recipe.  This recipe has bumped my French onion soup out of the usual rotation.

I made this with the baking option because I don't have a big enough skillet for so many onions. 325 was a little high for my oven, but 300 cooked the onions to the right consistency with minimal crispy ends. A large sheet pan and plenty of olive oil were perfect to do this and I stirred often over the course of an hour or more. I swore I wouldn't use too much cinnamon, but I think I did.  I think that's why I liked this rather than loved it.  With the cheese toasts, two more tsp. vinegar to the pot, and lots of fresh ground pepper, it was still good, but I won't use cinnamon next time, or just glance at the jar. Overall, a good way to make onion soup. Thanks, Chef John!
