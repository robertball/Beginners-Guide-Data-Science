Wow!!  They are easy,quick, and good.  Mixed and baked 2 batches in a little over an hour.  The first was made as directed and in the second 1 tsp. of maple extract was subsittued for 1 tsp. of vanilla and each cookie was topped with a pecan. Thanks.

These were very quick and easy, they tasted just like sugar cookies. The only thing I did differently is use canola oil and dipped the glass in cinnamon sugar instead of regular sugar. These are the perfect cookies to make if you have no butter and you just need a cookie!

This recipe has been worn out every time it has been written down in my family.  My grandmother has made them for as long as I could remember. We substitute lemon juice for the lemon zest, it gives it a nice lemony flavor.  For texture you could still use some of the lemon zest.

I baked as directed in the recipe except, I used a whole lemon for zest, putting at least 2 tsp in the dough. I baked at 350 for 7-8 minutes convection. For flavorful Christmas cookies, top with icing made with the rest of the lemon zest, lemon juice and powdered sugar. Add sprinkles or colored sugar for decoration. Excellent, not too sweet flavor!

I have been making these cookies since I was a teenager. They are so easy to make and have a nice flavor and soft texture. They can be iced with butter cream frosting dyed to match the event or holiday. This is the only sugar cookie I make.

bleh.. i thought these were going to be fun, yummy sugar cookies but really its just a waste of time.  they are like dry cake with no sweet taste.  the only thing i like about them is that they look nice when you put colored sugar on top.  don't make these for anyone unless you dislike them.

Taste great, but these are not sugar cookies. After I took them out of the oven I saw that they inflated (which is probably all the baking powder) and tasting them I found it had the texture of a biscuit. This is a very nice biscuit for tea, but not really a sugar cookie. I also added lemon zest and lemon juice but I can't really taste it, so next time I am going to add more flavor.

I had promised my son I would make cookies for his friend who was doing him a favor.  Unfortunately, I waited until the last minute and had to find a quick recipe to use the ingredients I had on hand.  FORTUNATELY, I came across this recipe!  I was a little nervous because of some of the negative reviews, but after one taste (I couldn't give them away without tasting one!) I knew I was in HEAVEN!  (my modifications: canola oil instead of corn oil, 1 teaspoon lemon juice instead of zest, decrease salt to 1/8 teaspoon) I was so relieved and grateful!

Thank you, Thank you, thank you! I had this recipe and lost it many years ago, so glad to have it back :-) I do a few things different. I do not press the top of the cookie dough, just sprinkle with sugar or do not sugar and frost with cream cheese frosting. these are just as good if not better that the big fluffy amish sugar cookies you get on the side of the road in amish country.

I just pulled these out of the oven and had to come and review them right away!  They turned out suprisingly good!!  I made these for my dairy allergic kids and this will be my new go-to cookie recipe.   I substituted canola oil for the corn oil and dipped the cookies in cinnamon sugar.  Yum!

yum! I made these with vanilla instead of lemon zest, and I topped them with "sugar cookie glaze" from this site and sprinkles. So pretty, and everyone raved about the taste. They are very light and cake-like. The batter was quite sticky, even for my Pampered Chef scoop. (I used the small one) I didn't need to press down the cookies with a glass, they flattened on their own. These are SOOO good! And perfect for me....since I have a dairy allergy. I think they really need the glaze, though, it helps make them PERFECT!

I needed a cookie recipe at the last minute (I had about an hour) for my daughter to take to school. Luckily I found this recipe. Not having everything, I modified it, and made a double batch:
I beat the oil and eggs to emulsify them. Since I only had olive oil, I used brown sugar (with a little white sugar when the brown ran out). 
Since I didn't have lemon, and I wanted a stronger flavor to cover the olive oil anyway, I put 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract in with the vanilla. 
A couple shakes of cloves and nutmeg, and about 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, went in with the flour.
I used whole wheat pastry flour, since that's what I use for everything. 
I used a teaspoon to apportion the cookies until I realized the time and then made them closer to a tablespoon.
They were removed when the edges were brown, and I got 9-11 dozen, guessing. I used parchment paper, let them cool on the paper off the pan for a minute, then dumped them into the box to take to school. They were flattened slightly with a shot glass bottom dipped in white sugar, which was a little too small - they came out a little puffy and craggy with little sparkles of sugar on them. Cute and yummy, but not your typical flat decorating sugar cookie. 
Either way, my daughter reports that everyone loved them, and the ones I tested were great, the almond flavor came through clearly, with just a hint of the warm from the spices, and they were sweet without being too sweet, so this is definitely a keeper.

I'm not normally one to rate recipes, but some of the less than stellar reviews on here led me to it.  I loved this recipe!  That being said, I did also add 1 tsp. of fresh squeezed lemon juice and dropped the vanilla by half a tsp.  It really gave the cookies a lovely lemon flavor.  It wasn't too overpowering, but don't do it if you aren't fond of the taste of lemon.  Also, make sure to sift the flower and add the zested lemon.  My cookie dough was a bit gooey, but held to its place when I dropped the dough onto the baking sheet.  The cookies rose nicely and are somewhat cake like.  A very refreshing cookie!

I used  powdered sugar (about 3/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp) instead of granulated and they were really good. They're like shortbread without the butter aftertaste. I left out the lemon, added almond extract and cinnamon, and used cinnamon and sugar on top. I think they'd be good with the lemon or any flavor you have on hand.

I made these for my mother, her boyfriend and his 8 yr old son and we loved them!The 8 yr old doesn't usually eat much, even of dessert, and he ate 2 of the biggest! I personally think they are the best I've ever made and perhaps even some of the best I've eaten. I did omit the lemon zest however and I did half and half on the flour with whole wheat and white (and the 8 yr old who hates anything "healthy" never knew ;)). Thanks for this great recipe, I know I'll be making them again soon!

I made this recipe today and I have to say...I don't know if I did something wrong, but the raw cookie dough didn't need to be flattened. Plus it was kind of sticky. They baked up just fine and taste ok.

These cookies came out really great.  I was hesitant to make them because of some of the reviews, but was pleasantly suprised.  I think maybe they came out floury for some is they may have measured the flour before sifting it.  I used almond extract instead of lemon, and used colored and turbonado sugar to top them.  Very easy recipe, thanks.

i have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time. It was moist, soft, and had the perfect amount of sweetness. Instead of leamon zest, added some milk. Came out great

I don't think these deserve a 1 star or a 5 star rating. They turned out great looking. They tasted good, but were kinda dry. I put some cream cheese frosting on them to make them taste less dry.Then they were pretty good to the taste buds! My 2 and 4 year old loved making them and eating them, if that counts for anything : )

Fast and tasty and pretty much foolproof. Great for beginning cooks. Don't understand the negative reviews. They weren't dense or floury. They were soft and tasty. I liked the suggestion to try other flavorings and made it with cinnamon oil and cinnamon sugar topping. Yum!

Easy to make and a tasty sugar cookie!  I like that it is made with oil, so it's quick to mix up.  I did find that I needed just a touch more flour for a good consistency.

For one thing, I doubled the recipe because it said 18 to a batch which didn’t sound like anything to me! I also used an Eminem caramel or Eminem peanut in the middle of each one before it went in the oven. They are very good for a sugar cookie not real crunchy. Slightly soft I would make this again! Please try it

I followed these directions and the cookies baked nicely.  However, they were bland and boring.  I used colored sugar on top to decorate them, but other than being pretty, they were fairly tasteless.

Quick, easy, and tasty! I left out the lemon zest because I didn't have any lemons, but they still turned out good. Also, I stirred the dry ingredients instead of sifting them, without any disastrous consequences.

This recipe was way too easy and fast, not to mention yummy.  I'm filing this under "dangerous" because I can see me making this during one of my weak moments when I'm craving something sweet.  It's a good cookie recipe to have around when unexpected guests drop in; however.  I like them without the added sugar on top, but I'm weird about "too sweet" sugar cookies.

I made these again and fixed them in mini muffin cups.  When they were done I pushed the centers down to make tiny bowls and filled them with the Easy Faux Chocolate Mousse from this site.  Very yummy!
