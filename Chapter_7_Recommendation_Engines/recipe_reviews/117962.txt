Excellent!!!!  Followed the recipe exactly, except didn't finish with the flour because we had red potatoes and no gravy was needed.  Just topped with left over pan juices, and that in itself was amazing.  The mushrooms!  Oh the mushrooms that comes from this recipe are DELICIOUS!  Yummy easy weeknight recipe!!

My wife claimed this to be the best dish ever last night.

I added yellow peppers with the mushrooms which added a distinct flavour to the gravy.  I removed the mushrooms and peppers before making the gravy.

I served the pork on basmatti rice cooked in chicken broth, served with steamed vegetables tossed in pesto.

This was WONDERFUL!! I made a couple of very small changes. Added some onion, used more mushrooms (and a bit more butter). Then when I did the gravy I used about a tablespoon of Burgandy cooking wine. It was heavenly. NO LEFTOVERS TONIGHT! It was all gone in 10 minutes! Will make this one often!

My family really enjoyed this dish, even my 10 month old.  I used a Pork loin rather than a tenderloin and it was still delicious.  I just had to cook it a little longer.  I didn't have Marjoram so I used Thyme instead and really liked the flavor.  I also used Portobello mushrooms which gave it more flavor.  I will make this often!

Broke my habit of onions with everything and didn't miss them at all with this dish.  The lemon juice brightened the flavor and the resulting gravy was sinfully delicious.  Only change I made was to thinly slice the garlic and add to the pan for cooking time (it dissolved, but the subtle flavor enhanced the gravy).  A winner here!

Fantastic!!!! I used portobello mushrooms and 1/2 a diced yellow onion. I also put the mushrooms and onions in when it was simmering so they carmalized. I also used both thyme and marjoram. I served it with red bliss mashed potatoes. It was a big hit with my family.

Very nice and easy. The pork turned out nice and tender. I should have added onion at the beginning because I found the gravy just a little bland. Will make again.

Great recipe!  It doesn't take very long and is very moist and flavorful.  The only change I made was to use pork loin chops due to the fact that our small-town grocery store didn't have the regular pork loin.  Still turned out wonderful.  For an extra kick, my husband enjoyed a little hot sauce, which I added right before I simmered.

Just finished preparing this dish as the recipe calls for and it is terribly Bland. I've added vegetable stock to the gravy and seasoning salt to the meat... not so great.  Not sure what other folks are tasting here.

DELICIOUS and easy!  And LOVED the added touch of the mushrooms!!  Followed recipe ingredients, but just more of them because  I cooked both tenderloins since they came together in one package, so it was a little over 2 lbs.  Doubled everything except the garlic and mushrooms, which I probably used 4 times as much.  I already planned to double the garlic (2 cloves), so I used 4 for both tenderloins.  I followed instructions to rub, but pressed them in a garlic press first... releases more of the garlic flavor and the garlic pieces stay on the meat and in the subsequent juices.  I also used more than doubled the mushrooms... I sliced an entire 8oz container of fresh mushrooms (a few make a cup, so it ended up maybe closer to 3-4 cups?).  Only change to ingredients is that I added a little cajun seasoning because once you've lived in Louisiana, everything just has to have it!  : )  I sprinkled it on the meat before browning and with the rest of the spices that are added before simmering.  It simmered a little longer because it was double the meat and someone got home late!  But it was still delicious!!  (I did not try to make the gravy because I used one we always enjoy, but I may try that next time!)  Don't hesitate to give this one a try!!

Sorry, we thought it was very bland.  Tenderloin was tender...but that's the only positive I can give.

I made two changes to this recipe.  After browning the pork I put it in a crockpot, then sauteed some sliced onions with the mushrooms and seasonings and put on that top of the pork.  It was outstanding!  This recipe is a keeper.

I gave 4 stars only because I substituted a few ingreidients. I didn’t have fresh mushrooms or dried marjoram so used 2 cans of sliced button mushrooms instead and left out the dried marjoram. Replaced all water with ½ cup lemon juice and ½ c. chicken broth and didn’t use salt or pepper; I replaced s&p with a local seasoning called, “Maurer’s Essence of the Northwest”  I added 1 tbsp. flour to thicken. I served over Couscous with sliced carrots that had melted butter and 1 tbsp. honey in. Very good.

This was absolutely delicious! Both my husband and I couldn't get enough of this meal. Even my 18-month-old loved it! I followed the recipe to the letter except I used a little more butter while simmering the pork, and made double the amount of gravy. The mushrooms were to die for! I didn't have any rice, so I served it over plain cous cous and it was heavenly! I will definitely be making this again and again.

simple. didn't think there would be enough moisture in the pan to cook the pork that long, but the liquid from the mushrooms provides a great steam environment.

Loved the sauce and mushrooms!!! I substituted chicken broth instead of water.  Why not add flavor, right?  The tenderloin was moist.  For some reason the pork tasted gamey to me, but I think it was me cause the others in my family didn't feel that way.  I rated a 5 because I liked the recipe a lot, fun and easy to make and the only issue I had I believe was my own issue with taste of the port.  I never cooked tenderloin on the stovetop, but liked this method.  Would like to see how it would work with chicken.

The pork tenderloin turned out great....moist with excellent flavor.  As another reviewer stated, my gravy came out a little bitter tasting (maybe to much lemon?). instead of throwing it out I added a can of golden mushroom (not cream of mushroom) soup and some additional water.  That did the trick, and it actually had a nice, rich mushroom flavor.  I will probably make again, but next time will add more mushrooms (not enough for my liking) and keep the addition of the soup.

Practically foolproof to make and the gravy was SO good.  I don't even like gravy but I loved this.  The only thing I did differently was use tarragon because I didn't have marjoram and made mashed potatoes instead of rice.  I can see myself using this recipe again and again and tweaking the spices each time to give it different flavors.  But, it was very good as is.

Very nice easy recipe.  I did use chicken stock instead of the water to make the gravy which tasted quite delish.  The pork was very tender.  I also substituted fresh Thyme for the marjoram because I didn't have any.  I used 1 Tbs fresh but next time I would use at least double that.  I will make this again.  BF loved it and ate seconds.

admittedly, I changed the marinade here quite a bit, but it was inspired by the original, which I think would be excellent in its own right.  I used olive oil instead of butter, added marjoram (but more like 1 tsp), ground pepper, 1 tsp of lemon juice, 1 tblsp of dijon mustard, 1 tbslp of yellow mustard, 1 tblsp of apple butter, and 1 tblsp of soy sauce.  I marinated the pork in a plastic bag for 2-3 hours, then added mushrooms to coat in the marinade for a few minutes.  Places pork and mushrooms in a square baking dish, covered with aluminum foil, and baked in the oven at 425 for 35 minutes.  it came out perfectly and really delicious.  we ate it with mashed sweet potatoes (with butter and cinnamon), which was an awesome complement!  My husband LOVED it.  I think you can really never go wrong with mustard, apples, and pork.  I liked the marjoram and lemon juice additions!

we wanted to grill...so we put all the ingredients together in a foil packet.  this couldn't be better!!!   just be careful to pour the juices out of the foil into the pan so you don't loose any!
also...made mashed potatoes instead of rice....AWESOME

So easy and so good - 1st time making pork tenderloin, and the whole family loved it!  Added a splash of white wine and substituted thyme for marjoram.  Will become a standard meal in our house - thanks!

This was great! I added some asparagus and cherry tomatoes as a side to complete the meal. I had to simmer the pork a little longer, probably because I didn't have the stove turned up high enough when simmering. I used a suggestion from one of the reviews and added 1/4 red onion (chopped) and 1 chopped orange bell pepper to the veggies.  I'll make this again, for sure!

After reading the reviews, decided to make this with the following changes:chopped the garlic (2 cloves), and added it to the paprika, salt, pepper, and thyme to make a rub. Covered the meat with this, and let it sit while I got everything else ready. Chopped half an onion, and added it with the mushrooms and lemon juice. Also threw in about half a cup of white wine during the gravy stage. Wonderful! I just have to remember that they pre-soak supermarket tenderloins in salt solution, as mine was a touch over-salted. Will use again! Great over wild rice, with green beans (cooked with a bit of bacon).

Delicious! I used onion in this recipe and thyme instead of marjoram and it was great. I used cornstarch and water to thincken gravy instead of flour and water because it thickens better withouth leaving the lumps that flour does. I also used a little more garlic then the recipe called for. I will definetly make this again!

We really enjoyed this recipe!  The pork was perfectly done and very flavorful.  I did not make gravy, but instead just added the rice to the sauce and mushrooms in the pan.  It made an easy side dish.

I made this with cubed pork instead as it was way cheaper than the tenderloin... Overall, I enjoy the taste of the gravy and would be willing to try it again with pork tenderloin.

Took the suggestions for adding more mushrooms, chopped onions and red wine. It was absolutely delicious. Served it over quinoa with a side of sliced tomatoes.  My mom, brother and 5 y-o son all loved it. This will be repeated often at our house

I was out out flour so I skipped the gravy part. I rubbed minced garlic, use 1/4 tsp marjoram for each side of the pork tenderloin, salt and peppered it, and rubbed the lemon juice on the pork and put 2 cans of mushrooms in an over safe dish around the pork and put in the oven for about 40 min on 375. I covered for about 20 min and uncovered for 20. Turned out perfect. It had the perfect marjoram-lemon zing and the mushrooms were great too! Would make again like this or even try the original recipe.

Fantastic 30-minute meal. Baked potatoes in the microwave and applesauce on the side - perfect. I added about half a cup chicken stock to the pot to give it more sauce while simmering along with half a sliced onion, and doubled the mushrooms. Delicious.

I have made this recipe several times now. It is a no-fail delicious way to cook pork tenderloin. The only changes I make are brining the pork 24 hrs in advance, and adding a little white wine after the pork browns. Delicious! My kids love the gravy it makes, too, as they are all mushrooms lovers. Goes great with mashed potatoes.

This was very good, and only needed a little tweeking for our tastes.  I made the recipe exactly, except for using cornstarch instead of flour (double for more gravy), but found that I needed a little chicken paste and about 1/2 T of worchestshire to give the gravy a little additional flavor.  I think I'll add onions next time, but I was surprised at how easy it was to cook the pork tenderloin over the stove.  Served with potatoes and creamed spinach ... my husband said he felt like he was eating a restaurant meal.

I've cooked pork tenderloin by roasting in the oven and also by slicing into medallions and sauteing in a pan, but I've never cooked a whole tenderloin on the stove top like this.  It worked really well!  The gravy is luscious, as long as you use a good pan to brown the meat.  Don't use a non-stick pan, it will not develop the nice brown bits in the pan ("fond") from browning the meat that you need for a good gravy later.  Whatever you do don't overcook the meat, tenderloin dries out easily.  It is okay for modern pork to be pink.  I cut slits in the meat and inserted garlic before browning, then I used thyme and rosemary instead of marjoram (just my preference), otherwise I kept to the recipe.  Oh, wait, I think I used about double the amount of mushrooms.  I also added a bunch of chopped onions with the mushrooms because I can't imagine a mushroom gravy without them :)  I was going to use chicken stock instead of water for the gravy but didn't have any, but what was in the pan already was so flavorful that water worked just fine.  Lemon was a nice addition that I've never used with pork before.  The proportions of ingredients and flavors work fabulously here and you can follow the directions with confidence.  Yummy!

I changed this recipe up a little bit when I read a few of the reviews about it being bland.  My husband and 2 daughters absolutely loved it and we all agreed it had plenty of flavor.

In addition to rubbing the garlic cloves on the tenderloin, I made several slits in the tenderloin and inserted sliced cloves.  I also seasoned the tenderloin with salt and pepper before browning.  I doubled the amount of mushrooms as they cook quite bit and used assorted wild mushrooms which gave a great depth of flavor.  To make the gravy richer, I used chicken stock instead of water.

Can't wait to make this again!

Does no one ever list bad reviews?  This was bland to the point of inedible.  160 degrees for a tenderloin seemed way over cooked.

Fantastic!  My family loved this dish.  The only change I made was to the gravy.  I used 3/4 cup water and 1/4 cup sherry wine (white wine would work well too) and added 1 1/2 tbs. of cornstarch.  Mix the ingredients together and bring to a boil, stirring constantly with a wire whisk.  This was a thicker gravy, but my kids loved it.

We usually grill our pork tenderloins, but this was a welcome change in method.  Absolutely delicious.  Added more mushrooms as previously suggested, and zinfandel to the sauce.  Didn't have marjoram on hand so substituted oregano with good results.  Also added light cream to the sauce.  Positively incredible.  Thank you Kathy Mackey.

Very very tasty dish.  I added a chopped red onion and baked in the oven at 250F for about 45 minutes (covered with foil).  Tender as all get out!.  Then made the gravy using corn starch, in with the mushrooms and onions.  Served on a bed of wild rice and steamed broccoli.  Didn't need any salt.  Very tasty.  Excellent recipe!

For those of you that don't have mushrooms on hand as I didn't, I used cream of mushroom soup after browning the loin in butter and seasoning it and all and it worked out WONDERULLY!!  MMMMMMM, SO GOOD!  My husband said, this was the ONLY way pork tenderloin should be made! Couldn't add it to my recipe box fast enough!!

Wow, great recipe. I wasn't sure about the lemon juice but the sauce was absolutely amazing. Didn't have marjoram so used oregano (a little less than called for). Will make again for company.

The flavor was mellow, tipping dangerously to the bland side.  This is after I swapped out the 3/4 cup of water for 3/4 cup of stock.  On the positive side, it did look pretty and it was easy to do.

I made this last night. It was excellent! I sprinkled the tenderloin with garlic powder and onion powder. I used 1 chicken bouillon cube in the water for the gravy mixture. Then served it with brown rice and peas. My husband said it's a keeper.

Delicious!  I substituted oregano for marjoram and chicken broth for water, and doubled the gravy... served with rice and steamed carrots... a perfect meal!

I don't know what the rest of these folks were making but it wasn't this recipe.I followed the directions to the letter the gravy was bitter. The pork itself was wonderful. My 4 yr old food critic herself had 2nds which is a rare occurance. I might try making just that alone again.

This was good, the meat was perfectly moist, but we felt it lacked flavor. I made a few minor changes as noted: Instead of rubbing the pork with garlic, I sprinkled with garlic powder. I used more butter than called for, added minced onion with the mushrooms, and 1/2 cup water and 1/4 cup white wine. I like the concept of this dish, but I'm not sure what else could be added to make the taste complete...

I had to cook this for close to 45 minutes until the juices ran clear, and then it ended up being much drier than when I pan bake it. I used thyme as well, since I didn't have marjoram. Also, I added white pepper for a bit of kick. The flavor would be vastly improved if the mushrooms were sauteed before or with the searing of the pork. I also ran out of time to make a proper gravy with the juices, but this was just okay for me.

The pork was tasty but the gravy was pointless. I even added onion and more garlic and it was still lacking any substantial flavor. I do not recommend this recipe. You are better off just using a powdered gravy.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was very good!  The pork was moist and the gravy tasted great.  I did add a little more salt to the gravy but that was because of my taste buds.  I added onions to the dish in the beginning while searing the pork -- good tip from the other reviewer.  I served this with steamed broccoli.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty. I added 1/2 diced onion. The caramelized onion and mushrooms made a nice reduction. Didn't have rice, so served it with a garlic couscous.

Made some minor changes, but really loved this dish.  We had some smoked tenderloin we had frozen, which was used after thawing.  Instead of mushrooms, used a can of cream of mushroom soup and used it as a sauce from the pan instead of gravy.  Other than that, followed the instructions.

We made this tonight, and oh my gosh was it good!  I would not change a thing.  I will tell you, I added a little bit of white wine, and I did not measure the lemon juice.  The gravy was a little tart, so I maybe put in too much lemon, or the white wine did that, not sure.  I am here to tell you, that was the best pork tenderloin I have ever had.  So juicy it was unbelievable.  Be aware, when you cut into the meat it will still be pink, but I checked the temp and it was 170.

Absolutely delicious. This was definitely a hit in my house. Soooooo easy too. I substitued noodles for the rice which worked out perfectly. Can't wait to make it again.  A real keeper for sure.

This really was fantastic. I added a cup or two of chicken broth (not sure what the tenderloin would have simmered in otherwise?) I also used a little cream and flour to thicken the sauce instead of water. It tasted like it came from a 5 star restaurant, and all in a nearly effortless half hour. I will DEFINITELY be making this again- regularly. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I used oregano instead of marjoram, used cornstarch instead of flour, added halved cherry tomatoes to the mushroom gravy, and will use some sherry or other red wine when mixing with the cornstarch. Everyone LOVED it -- even the kids!!!

Very tasty!  Even my picky toddler couldn't get enough of this.  After reading other reviews, I added half a diced onion, more mushrooms, some red wine and used vegetable broth instead of water.  Also, in addition to rubbing the pork with garlic, I cut slits in the pork and stuffed slices of the garlic into the slits.  I did simmer the sauce a little longer to burn off the alcohol in the wine.  Thanks for this recipe.  I think it's definately a keeper!

This is a great way to serve pork tenderloin.  I did make a couple of changes, though, since the recipe did not seem to provide enough liquid for gravy.  The tenderloin was simmered in a quarter cup water.  After the meat was removed from the skillet, I added a half-cup water, adding vegetable broth and heavy cream to make the gravy.  Served over egg noodles, it tasted great!

Very easy and tasty. added some chopped onion with the mushrooms, and used thyme and oregano in place of marjoram. Also used chicken broth + cornstarch for the gravy instead of water + flour.

I followed the recipe with the exception of adding about 1/2 cup of white wine while simmering.  This was wonderful and my whole family loved it.  Great recipe.

Wonderful! I followed the advice of others and made a gravy or of the grease drippings using milk. I also served over rice instead of pasta. The rice soaked up the gravy and was decadent! Yum!

Absolutely delicious and satisfying!  Only a couple minor changes that I made, I added onions with the mushrooms (and both carmelized so nicely), I salted and peppered the pork itself as well as the sauce, and I used homemade stock instead of water.  Flavorful and yummy, and relatively low maitenance.  I highly recommend!

Great recipe, enjoyed the pork.  Will add more seasoning next time I make it, gravy tasted slightly bland.  Cooking method was great!

This was delicious.  I made it just like the recipe with no changes.  My husband who is very picky about how pork is cooked really liked this. He said to add more mushrooms next time I cook it. It has a great flavor and is very moist and tender.  Im sure Ill be making this again soon.

I love pork tenderloin and was looking for something different. This was delicious! Only change I made was replaced the butter with coconut oil. The meat and mushrooms were so delicious, I wish there were leftovers to stuff into a pita or ciabatta for lunch tomorrow! No such luck, my 2 year old inhaled the mushrooms! My hubby said he could eat this twice a week, which means I will be referring to it often!

Delicious! I added a bit more paprika and garlic to the pan, substituted oregano for marjoram,  doubled the mushrooms and added half of a chopped orange pepper. Best pork loin I've ever had. I actually joined all recipes just to review this!

Really, really good and easy.  I used ground sage in place of marjoram because I didn't have any.  Tasted great.

This was good, just a tad lemony.  I didn't find the gravy too flavorful so I added a pack of mushroom gravy from clubhouse to the water mix, and upped the water to 1.5 cups (we like our gravy here!)

Very moist and tender.  The mushrooms soaked up more of the sauce than the pork did, I wished the pork had more of the sauce flavor since it was so good.

The only change I made to this recipe was to use chicken broth instead of water and I made sure to use a thermometer with a timer so I wouldn't overcook the pork. Nothing more tasteless than overcooked pork. I cooked a lot faster than the recipe called for. I also doubled the recipe because I have an 18 year old son who can put the food away. There was hardly any left after dinner! It was very tender and delicious. I thought about adding onion but decided not to and I don't think anyone missed them. I did use extra mushrooms though. I will definitely make this again.

Yummo!!!  My 1.5 pound tenderloin lasted just barely over 1 meal.  My husband loved this recipe.

I used the few leftovers to fill enchiladas a couple days later and they were fantastic, too!

YUMMY!  I did make a few changes....I added just a little onion, and I sauteed the onion and mushrooms in the butter before I added the pork for browning. Overall though, one of the best ways I've ever made a tenderloin....it was so good, even my 5 and 7 year olds gobbled it up!

My whole family loved this recipe.  (picky husband and 2 young boys)  They asked for seconds.  I served this with mashed potatoes and applesauce.  I will add a few extra spices as suggested by some reviews and bring this up to a 5 star review.

Delicious!  Followed the recipe closely except substituted vegetable broth instead of water.  To thicken, I then added 1 rounded tsp cornstarch mixed with 1 tbsp cold water in place of the flour.  Very easy to prepare, appealing presentation and fork tender--perfect for busy weeknight meals.  Will definitely make this one again!

This is a great recipe!  I love the fact that it's easy and you do it all on the stove top.  I've made this for my family twice and it came out awesome both times.  I didn't have any marjoram, so I substituted oregano.  Also, the second time I made it, I added shallots to the pan at the same time as the mushrooms.  Superb!

Double the sauce.  Didn't have pork tenderloin, used center cut chops.  Delicious.
