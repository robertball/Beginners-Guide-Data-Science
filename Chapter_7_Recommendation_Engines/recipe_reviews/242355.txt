I'll have to admit, this was pretty good. Grand Daughter loved it. I can see why the chef apologized. Thank you for sharing this KITTIBOESEL.

We had mixed reviews from the household. These tasted exactly like Nilla wafers, which made eating cauliflower tolerable from my 10 year old who is usually very picky. But if something tastes like candy...she'll take it! My 4 year old said it was ok but didn't want more than a couple bites. My husband, LOVED it...which was a surprise, I didn't think he would like anything that sweet. He basically ate the whole bowl. I wasn't a huge fan. It got soggy really fast and I'm wondering if my husband liked it because it was covered in so much butter! Not sure if I will make again. I did make it exactly according to instructions and ingredients.
