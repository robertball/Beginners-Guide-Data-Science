Good stuff. We ate it for dinner instead of breakfast. I used tater tots instead of raw potatoes, I just put them still frozen in the pan and heated them until they got a little crunchy. We had barbeque sauce on top and it was delicious.

Very good recipe, although I had a bit of a problem getting the eggs to set without burning the bottom layer of hash browns.  I used a bit more cheddar cheese, and also added a half pound of spicy pork sausage to the egg mix.

My husband and I also had this for dinner... but because we both have heartburn troubles (and I don't really care for onions) we left the tomatoes and onions out. But it was still very good!

This was absolutely delicious. My husband said to "definetly make this again". It was fairly quick and easy. (Easy,I like) I used regular extra thick bacon instead of the ready made stuff and I didn't have any tomatoes so I used diced green peppers..   mmmm

Really good!  I also had a problem with burning the potatoes before the eggs had set, so when the potatoes started getting a little "crispy", I cut the whole thing in half and used a large spatula to flip it over(one half at a time) to cook the top.  Then I transferred the whole thing to a pie plate and put it in the oven to melt the cheese.
