I've made this for a while but it's much easier than this recipe & still delicious. Buy pastry sheets in the freezer section at you grocery. Thaw cut in half & stretch. Add fresh fruit or canned fruit pie filling; about 2 or 3 Tbsp. Stretch pastry over & seal. Bake at 450 for approx 15 min.  So easy & good.

I was tempted to add vanilla and maybe some cinnamon, but after tasting the sauce, I decided I like the flavor of the fresh raspberries just the way they are.  I had guests, and they all raved.  I will definitely make again.  Thanks!

I didn't have raspberries so I substituted blueberries and apple slices (2 apples) -- turned out fine. Also increased the brown sugar to 1 cup and added zest of one orange. I love puff pastry.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I used a homemade puff pastry crust also on Allrecipes.  I'm sure it was my fault, but my pastries all broke, making a big mess--I was trying to follow the pastry recipe tips and this one at the same time and I think I rolled the dough too thin, or tried to add more filling that would fit (probably both).  Nonetheless, my family still liked them quite well.  Despite my lack of proficiency, I thought the sauce could be a little thicker and it would have worked better and I also thought it was too tart.  I'm sure I'll try this again, as my hubby has already requested it; but I have a really good pie crust recipe and I think I'll try that instead of the puff pastry, add more sugar, and cut down slightly on the liquid.
