I decided to use homemade pasta and homemade alfredo sauce. This isn't like tuna casserole at all. The flavor isn't horrible, but doesn't have a wow factor. I don't think using store bought pasta or sauce would have improved the outcome. Maybe add some veggies for a pop of color, or even herbs? I'm not sure. It was okay but not worth it to make it again.

What a handy recipe! I didn't have alfredo sauce so made a rose by adding a bit of cream and chevre to a tomato sauce. Great comfort food and my family loved it.

Will make again.  Measuring a cup of pasta caused the biggest fight of my relationship.  The listed ratio  between sauce, tuna, and pasta is strange.  I used 12 oz of pasta, 2 jars of sauce (15 oz each), and the listed 24 oz—six cans—of tuna.

With a few variations, this was good.  Since I didn’t have Alfredo sauce nor onion powder; I added garlic cloves and broccoli and then improvised with what I had for a plain white sauce, courtesy of a Blendtec recipe, of milk, butter, flour and salt—-reason I added garlic to the tuna.  One of my better variations for not having right ingredients.

I made it but I needed it to be bigger so I added extra pasta, frozen veggie medley, and canned mushrooms. I also through in some sour cream, cream cheese, half and half as well as parm and Colby jack. It fed the three of us and there is enough leftover for my lunch tomorrow.

The idea is wonderful. However, the measurements in this recipe seem very odd. We did 1 box of pasta, 2 small jars of Alfredo sauce, and 3 cans of tuna. It was a good ratio of noodles to sauce to tuna. We top it with Parmesan cheese and fried onions. We like to serve it with cheesy garlic bread as well.
