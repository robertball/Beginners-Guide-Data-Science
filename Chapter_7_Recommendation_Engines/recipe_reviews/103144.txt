This is simply divine !!! No worries about the marinade, it's fine as long as it's boiled. There is marinade left on the meat and we eat it because it has been heated up enough to kill germs.  Anyhow, love this gourmet recipe ! Thank you so much !!

I made two batches of marinade.one for the chicken to marinade in and discarded, and the second for the sauce.Not a good idea to use any marinade that was used on chicken.

If you're considering this recipe, the answer is YES!!!  Although I'm big on changing up recipes, this one is perfect -- only thing I did different was marinating the chicken breasts for around 3 hours prior to cooking.  There were some reviewers talking about how the marinade/sauce was too bitter and vinegary.  If you think this, you are using the WRONG vinegar!  Good balsamic is not overly vinegary.  Yes, it's more expensive than the alternative, but it's completely worth it for recipes like this.  I doubled the sauce/marinade and reduced it more after the chicken was done cooking and spooned some of it over the chicken.  My friends loved the sauce so much that they spooned some of the extra over their vegetables!  Everyone raved about this dish and one friend even begged me to give her cooking lessons!  Delicious, impressive, and simple.  Who could ask for more??

I marinated the chicken for about an hour. The only change I made was using brown sugar in place of the white sugar and Garlic & Wine Seasoning in place of the Italian. We grilled the chicken and I reduced the marinade until thickened and drizzled over roasted asparagus and Roma tomatoes.

I made this for my family over Memorial Day Weekend.  I placed the chicken breasts in the marinade in the morning, and grilled them that evening.  I also followed the recipe "as is".  My chicken was moist and had great flavor as well.  This is a keeper!

If you love balsamic vinegar, you'll like this recipe for chicken. Fantastic marinade as I let the chicken bath for like 3 hours, it definitely made it more tender and moist when I finished braising it. Will be using this recipe again in the future.

I followed the recipe to the letter and it produced the most beautiful, moist flavorful white meat chicken.  Wonderful alternative to the teriyaki/soy marinades.  Thanks for posting.

I have made this recipe at least 10 times for my family and friends. They all love it. My twin 6 year olds and my 4 year old son gobble it up.
I prepare the marinade exactly as it says, however, I place the chicken in a Pyrex dish and pour the marinade on and refrigerate. When it is time for dinner, I bake it at 350 for 30 minutes. We serve with salad and use the extra sauce from the dish as dressing.

This is a great recipe, unfortunately on my first try I was able to get the sauce to reduce because I let the chicken marinate too long, but on my second try it came out very well.

Absolutely delicious!  I'm not sure where this has been all my life but boy I am glad I found this chicken.  This was so fast and easy that it's going to be on my menu often.  The reduced sauce is so good, just the right amount of tang from the vinegar.  Thank you for this keeper!!!

We did not like this.  We love balsamic, we used a phenomenal aged balsamic we love and this dish was WAY too acidic.  I also didn't reduce it all the way to try and save it but it didn't work for us.

Great quick recipe!  Marinated 10 mins on each side as recipe suggested.  I substituted Garlic powder for the fresh as I didn't have any on hand.  Delish!! Full of Flavor Beautiful Color.  Served with fresh salad and mash potatoes.  Drizzled some pan glaze over mash potatoes.  YUMMY!

I made this exactly as written except I sauteed some mushrooms in the sauce as well (love mushrooms with chicken!) and it was really good and flavorful for being as simple as it is. But the even better part - for lunch today I had some leftover chicken and mushrooms that I tossed in a salad with some feta and a poppyseed vinagrette and it was awesome!

DH rated this 3.5-4 (or a 7 on a 10-point scale) and DS (who HATES chicken) gave it a 4.5!  Me?  If DS will eat it (and the leftovers, too) it gets a 5!  Because the chicken breasts were frozen, I sliced them and marinated them for 2 hours.  I did double the sauce (except for the sugar) but used 1 t. oregano, 1 t. basil, and 1 t. garlic powder because I had not Italian seasoning.  I heated the sauce separately (except for the 1/2 cup I used to marinate the chicken pieces).  I cooked the chicken in the olive oil, flouring them on one side, pushing them to the edge of the pan as they got done to add more slices.  I used all the marinade to deglaze the pan and cooked on medium high heat to reduce the sauce.  I served the chicken with sauce over orzo cooked in 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water.  Steamed green beans completed the meal.

Used flattened boneless chicken breasts. When the price is right I buy chicken breast halves then prep them for individually wrapped storage in a freezer bag. For personal preferences only I doubled the garlic. Served over whole wheat penne pasta with a side of fresh pineapple chucks. A fantastic light dinner! Thank you SherryLynn.

So delicious! I used the full amount of marinade for only one chicken breast. I sliced the chicken thinly before soaking it in the marinade for about an hour. I used Splenda instead of sugar. I will make this again and again! Tastes kind of Asian with out the added salt from soy sauce. Delicious!

This is a fast, easy dish to make. Full of flavor. Everyone loved it! I used a combination of boneless, skinless breasts and thighs. I think that next time I'm going to try it with thin, center cut pork chops!

Chicken with a kick! Oh how chicken can seem so bland and monotonous, BUT this chicken was delightful, tasty and a definite repeater! I followed the recipe to the "t" and loved it. Even hubby liked, which I was sure he would not because of the "Balsamic" addition.

Excellent!  I'm not a huge fan of any kind of vinegar, but this was wonderful!  I added a bit of cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce.

This was ok. I marinated the chicken for an hour and it turned out flavorful and tender. Really the only issue I have is that the chicken turned out a little too sweet for my family's taste. I think it would be better without the sugar.

ALLRECIPES comes thru again!  I'm reteaching myself how to cook, as I am recovering from a stroke and currently have use of just one hand, so I search for recipies that are EASY, and this fit the bill.  Everyone loved it and had seconds.  Paying attention to other reviewers I doubled the sauce.  I served with white rice, and the sauce was great on that too.  Plus, we have chicken and sauce keft over, so I have a 'no prep' lunch for tomorrow.  All said this should become a regular dish.  (And...my large chicken breasts were tender enough, without advance tenderizing, to be cut with a fork)

This was a wonderful, simple, healthy dish - my husband and I both loved it.  I followed the recipe almost exactly (didn't have Italian seasoning, so subbed 1/2 tsp each of thyme and oregano; also, I cut 3 breast halves into cutlets instead of 4 breasts).  It came out great.  My favorite part about this is that all the ingredients are in your pantry, and I always have chicken breast in the freezer, so I can decide to do this on a whim with no grocery trip.  Need more recipes like that!

I made this with splenda and used cooking spray instead of added oil, but didn't change anything else. It smelled so good while marinating and cooking and tasted even better. Thanks for this! I will DEFINITELY do this again.

This was most excellent with a delightful tangy flavor thanks to the Balsamic vinegar.  I wouldn't change a thing and it is certainly a nice change from the regular oriental type marinades I've been using.

Fantastic !!!! this recipe is easy and has ton of flavor. I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours and then grilled the chicken. I doubled the recipe and put it on the stove like the recipe says and poured it over rice. Family loved it. I will make this many times. Thanks for recipe

This recipe is very good. I used Splenda in place of the white sugar and marinaded the chicken for 1 1/2 hours. Great flavor. Next time I will serve it with green beans or asparagus, the marinade will be great drizzled over them.

Chicken was okay. I substituted a white sugar for brown sugar for a more caramelized effect.

Solid, simple and quick dish.  I used fresh thyme and oregano from the herb garden.  Be careful not to overcook!  We had leftovers, and we stored them with the extra balsamic reduction juices.  The chicken was actually better the next day because of the extra marinating.  Strong flavors, but not at all overpowering.  The dish went nicely with a light salad and some cauliflower/mushroom risotto I made!

I took the advice of several people, and I doubled the recipe for a balsamic reduction. I also baked the chicken breasts in foil packets instead of pan frying. My husband voted me best wife of the millennium when tried it. And, it was super easy.  This will become a regular item at my house.  Absolutely no complaints.

Nice chicken. My family and I really enjoyed it. I did marinate over night and completely forgot the Italian seasoning but it was still very tasty and flavorful. If you like balsamic you will enjoy this dish.

I am giving five stars because this dish was delicious, although I will admit that I did not have balsamic vinegar on hand, so I instead used a balsamic and basil vinaigrette.  My husband said he had never had any kind of chicken that tasted like this (in a good way).  This will definitely become a regular dish for my family, although next time I will double the marinade/sauce as we we couldn't get enough!

I made this for a dinner party and everyone went for seconds! I marinated the chicken in the balsamic/broth mixture for a good 3 hours! I did not have any sugar on hand so I substituted maple syrup which gave the chicken a delicous sweetness. Instead of italian herb seasoning I used a dash of "herbes to province"! I added some chopped up mushrooms and onion to the marinade as well and cooked these with the chicken. I used the marinade for the sauce - boiling the marinade kills all the bacteria in my opinion. I served this over wild rice and sauteed green beans! A very "gourmet-looking" and seeminly easy dish!

This was such a simple recipe to make!  My hubby pulled chicken out for dinner and didn't know what to do with it, so I looked up recipes and found this one.  I had everything right in the cabinet!  It was so easy to put together and put on the table.  Definitely make extra marinade to make a sauce.  SOOOO YUMMY!!

I marinated the chicken in the fridge for about six hours, then grilled it. The end result was good, but I don't know that I'd make it again.

This recipe was exceptional if you like the taste of balsamic vinegar. If you don't like it, I wouldn't bother to make it. I added a extra clove of garlic,1 tsp. of salt and half of a small onion finely minced to the marinade. I also pounded out the chicken breast and marinated it for @3 hours. I agree with the other reviewers about the quality of the balsamic vinegar. The combination of balsamic vinegar, garlic and Italian seasoning couldn't get any better. I made it for our daughter who came home for the week-end from college and she already requested it the next time she comes home.

I love it for the ease and the handy ingredients. I've used it with breasts and cutlets (with modified cooking times) and it turns out flavorful. I boil the marinade and pour it on the chicken and the rice or potatoes. It was just a bit too sweet to be a favorite for some family members, but when I cook it on a weeknight it gets devoured! Thanks!

Wow this is great. Chicken breasts are too dry for my liking so I used 10 chicken thighs instead. They are yummy! I followed the recipe except for the thighs. The marinade/sauce is delicious.

Way to sweet for us.  I love the balsamic but I think there was too much additional sugar, I think I'll try it again but cut 2 tbls of sugar down.

This is a really good recipe!! I pounded out and tenderized the chicken first. I agree with the other poster about not adding the sugar, I think I will try it with less or no sugar next time. I served it with potatoes, but will try rice next time as I thought this had an Asian-type flavor to it. REALLY good!!

Great recipe!  I followed it as-is...the only change I would make would be to marinate much longer.  However, the chicken was moist and it tasted amazing.  This is some of the best chicken I have made and I will definitely be making this again and again.

I like this recipe. My sauce didn't really thicken up much at all. I used Splenda instead of sugar just to say some calories. My husband really liked this a lot. Served with Broiled Red Potatoes from this site.

Following the suggestions of others, I cut back on the balsamic vinegar, changed the sugar to honey & brown sugar, and added more garlic.  I had it marinating in the fridge for a few hours just before cooking.
The meat was awesome!  Well, except for the strong vinegar flavor - still should have cut it back some more; maybe only 1/2 the listed amount.
My kids couldn't even finish it.
This recipe has A LOT of potential dishes if only the vinegar is cut back.

I liked it alot. I would just change one thing next time prob a little bit less balsamic and add some worcestire sauce. It was just a bit to vinegary but it was still delicious! I would like a little bit of a sweeter taste. Also i have heard where people add brown sugar instead that also sounds like a good idea.

Very tasty! I cut my chicken into strips, and marinated the chicken in a ziplock bag for 20 minutes. In one skillet, I added the olive oil and used tongs to add the chicken from the ziplock bag so it could brown up. In another skillet, I added all the marinade so it could reduce down and carmelize a little. When the chicken was done, I transferred the chicken to the skillet with the marinade. Coated it well, reduced heat to low, and covered with a lid for another five minutes. Very good over rice!

I just tried this for company.  We all enjoyed it, and I followed the recipe "as is".  The chicken was moist and had a good flavor.

Just made this and it was really good! I've been bored with chicken lately and this is a nice change, really simple to make too. I didn't change anything except marinated a bit longer (about an hour and a half). Thanks!

It was awesome best recipe for chicken I tried it today and my husband loved it. I just added some flour to the sauce at the end to thicken it somehow.

Made exactly as stated and it was a hit with the whole family! I doubled the recipe so had to use two pans on the stove.  One pan got more sauce in it when I put the chicken in and it didn't have the nice glaze the pan with less sauce did.  Both tasted great- but the glazed chicken was prettier.

Quick and easy.  I marinated the chicken overnight.  I didnt reduce the marinade and I regret it.  What did reduce after cooking the chicken was delicious!  Next time I will definitely do it.

The only thing I wish I would have done differently is tenderized the chicken so it was thinner and more flavorful. Otherwise, very simple and delicious.

Very nice flavor.  I do agree with some in not using the marinade itself on the chicken. So I marinade with about 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp sugar and throw this out. After marinading, I bake my chicken alone with just some pepper at 350F for 20 min and drain the fatty juices. I then mix the "marinade" ingredients as shown, pour it on the chicken, cover and bake at 350F for another 20-30 min until done. Thanks to the recipe, "Strawberries with Balsamic Vinegar" on this site, I top the chicken with sliced strawberries before pouring on the marinade. Once I even tossed a few fresh blueberries on the strawberries for a different taste. When done, I drain off all the liquid into a saucepan and reduce it to a nice glaze/sauce to pour on the chicken for serving - you might add a Tbsp of balsamic vinegar to the sauce for some zip. It sounds strange, but I was pleasantly surprized that about 1 Tbsp+/- of Nestle' Strawberry Quick syrup upped the sweetness and flavor of the sauce!

I liked this recipe but found the sauce to be too runny so I mixed a tablespoon of flour with a tablespoon of butter and then added it to the sauce and it thickened it up nicely. Yummy!

These tasted good, though I did throw in 1 tsp of black truffle oil.  The taste was very strong and sharp, so next time I'll probably serve with something to balance it out... say some cream cheese potatoes.  Lovely recipe, though.

Everyone liked this. I marinated chicken breasts for 3 hours as others' suggested and added a bit more broth, used less sugar. The marinated breasts cook VERY fast so be careful to no to over cook. Since mine were a little bit dry, next time I would take the breasts out and add the sauce to reduce somewhat before putting the breasts back in to coat. And I would use the full amount of sugar and try to keep the same proportions of vinegar/broth. Easy dish. Maybe I would add onions next time too. I also used fresh herbs from my garden as well as some dried.

My family loved this recipe. We doubled the sauce and I cut the chicken into about 2" strips so the chicken absorbed more of the sauce. This just might be a weekly meal!

I absolutely love the marinate!! I used only 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, and it was just enough marinate for 2 (a little extra in glass for dipping) - so for 4 chicken breasts I would have to double it.
Served with brown rice & frozen stir fried vegtables.

Excellent!!!  We were cooking and had only 2 chicken breasts, so we adjusted the recipe to go with that.  I wish that we would have made more of the glaze, not because the chicken needed it, bu tto put on top of the porkchops we cooked

Everyone else liked this better than I did.  The suggested heat level was WAY too high, so it burned on one side, even at medium heat.  It dried out the breasts.  The sauce was flavorful, but it never thickened at all.  If I make it again, I'll change the cooking method.

This is truly yummy! I doubled the marinade and used chicken thighs.  I couldn't get the sauce to thicken as much as I would have liked but I still loved it and will make it often.

Addendum: This is also my new favorite marinade!  I marinaded beef kabobs for 40 mins prior to grilling.  I heated the leftover marinade in a saucepan and served the whole thing over basmati rice.

I made this last night with pork chops, center cut loin chops. The only thing I added was some onion powder, and I did substitute Truvia for the sugar (I'm diabetic). It was delish! Can't wait to try it with chicken breasts.
I did get a little carried away and cooked the marinade down TOO much ... ended up with balsamic sludge, LOL! So keep an eye on that when reducing.

Very easy and very tasty.  Served over wide noodles and everyone licked their lips.  Yummy, yum, yum.  Can't wait to make this excellent dish again.  It's the perfect "go to" dish when not sure what to make for dinner.

This chicken dish was truly incredible.  I did one thing different because I did not have the "traditional" balsamic vinegar.  I used white balsamic vinegar... it tasted incredible and the presentation was just as pretty.

The flavor was delicious, but for some reason the chicken breasts weren't tender. Maybe I purchased chicken breast from an old bird : ) My husband suggested tenderizing them with a meat mallit. So next  time I will flatten them alittle  with a meat mallit before I marinate them. I did add the marinate after browning, and reduced the marinate by half (more than 5 minutes). Flavor of the sauce is definately worth making again. Thanks for a great recipe  : )

I have to say, for being so simple, this recipe really packed the flavor.  Quick and easy, but the best thing of all is that my 7 year old son, who eats barbecue sauce on everything, loved this dish and didn't even think twice about dousing it with the all too good sauce, yes he put it on the table so he was ready to until he tried it.

YUM! The kids were very skeptical about the 'black chicken' but they all loved it (ages 9, 6, 3, and 1). So easy and so good. Made just as written and will definitely be making again. Served with plain couscous, which was delicious when topped with the sauce.

Very quick and easy! I am NOT a good cook and I whipped this up (as is) with no trouble at all. I served it over greens with sundried tomatoes, pine nuts and goat cheese and poured the balsamic sauce over top. Amazing!

Delicious not to mention beautiful chicken! We marinated it for 30 minutes on each side and couldn't have asked for better tasting chicken, I think this is going to be our new recipe no need for any others! Served this with rice with chicken broth and broccoli... Delicious!

I'm not certain what all the fuss is about.  The recipe was OK, but I've definitely had better chicken marinades.  Perhaps if it were to marinate significantly longer than the twenty minutes suggested, there would be stronger flavor.

Pretty good.  It started to burn, so I had to turn down the heat, and add a little more olive oil to the pan.  I will make this again.  7/3/12 Tried it again.  I probably wont make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly except the marinade was doubled...I should have left the original amount.  He thought it was definately a keeper and better than my usual marinade.  I thought it was a little sweet but, overall, very good.  I served it with Roasted Potatoes from this site.

I made this just as the recipe calls for although I did pour some of the marinade into the fry pan and let the chicken cook in it.YUMMY!! The chicken was very moist and the sauce is incredible. I made this with roasted vegatables and sopped the vegetables up in the sauce. Next time I will definitely take others advice and make extra sauce.  My fiancee loved it and the appreciative noises at the table ensured this one to go directly into my recipe box.

This was delicious. I made the recipe as is. The only change I made was to marinate the breasts for 3-4 hours before cooking them. The only complaint was that, for some reason, some of the chicken pieces got "tough," even though I didn't overcook them on the stovetop. Not sure what happened there. The flavor was wonderful and I served them with the same marinade (which I made sure to boil).

I made this on this past Saturday. It is now Tuesday, and my husband is begging for it again. He LOVES it! I served it over Rotini pasta that had a little butter, onion powder, and garlic powder on it only. That's how we will have it tonight also, however, we were trying to decide between pasta and rice. I ended up marinating the chicken for a few hrs doing other things and had made thin strips, not breasts. I used med high heat as suggested, but I think this stove cooks hot. I just went with it. I seared he chicken on both sides and let it cook a few minutes on both sides. Because they were thin, it worked out brilliantly. The chicken had a wonderful caramelized seared outside due to the sugar and inside was very moist. The chicken was so flavorful! I highly recommend this dish, but marinate as long as you can. also, I did not make a sauce out f the remaining marinade. I thought it would be overkill. Just the chicken pulled from the marinade, placed in a hot pan, and put on the pasta.

Hit with the family. I used Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing instead of balsamic vinegar, it was all I had. But it was good.

Made this tonight and it was delicious! I didn't change a thing and there wasn't a scrap left. Even my, "I don't like chicken" teen ate every bit and was sopping up the leftover sauce with focaccia. I did pull the chicken out at the end and reduce for another three minutes but that was just to sweeten the balsamic sauce a bit more.

Super easy and loads of great flavor. Followed recipe as written, but would marinate longer next time for deeper balsamic flavor. Served with roasted cauliflower and scalloped potatoes. Whole family loved it!

Amazing chicken!!  My hubby and kids loved it.  The sauce was really tasty - although a little oily when I reduced it for serving over the chicken.  I added a little more garlic.  Definitely will use this recipe again!!

The flavors are good.  I cut my chicken into strips and let it marinade overnight. (I used brown sugar instead of white sugar)  It really soaked up all that flavor.  The chicken its self would be good in a salad or on a sandwich with some feta and olives.  The glaze on the other hand has a griddy texture.  I tried using a hand held blender to smooth it out but still not glaze like.

I have made this several times for my family, and we love it!! You must let the vinegar cook very well and let the reduction take place...or it doesn't get sweet and will stay acetic.

This was Fabulous and I even forgot to add the Sugar! I skipped a step and just baked the chicken right in the sauce and reduced in a sauce pan to thicken it after the chicken was done.  I ate it over a bed of lettuce. Can't wait to make it again. . .  with SUGAR!!  LOL. Thanks SherryLynn

This was very easy and delicious.  I found the after taste just a bit vinegary for me (I did you balsamic vinegar), so right before serving I added about a tablespoon of butter which seemed to help.  I will definitely be making this again.

I thought this was going to be a lot better.  It wasn't bad, but wasn't great.  Easy enough to make.  Might do it again in a pinch.

This should be a comfort food! It is so good- I love that it is different from the traditional chicken recipes, yet easy to make. My husband and I both loved this, and it is difficult to get him to stray from his favorite Italian dishes. I used brown sugar as I noticed a few others did as well and it was perfect!

it was good but felt like maybe there was a little to much Italian season for me. I will try it again with a little less and see how that works.

So far this has my attention though it is obviously underseasoned as is. I doubled the chicken and used a head of garlic smashed and some basil and oregano and enough broth and vinegar to cover it to marinate overnight. I'll be back later with the results. Who knows, maybe I broke it. :P Other reviewers seemed to have done similar though so I don't think I'm being too crazy. :P

Very good!  I doubled the sauce since we were having it with orzo.  I like the sweet and tangy flavor of the sauce.  A good easy recipe and one that I will make again.

Awesome recipe - we will be making this again. I doubled the sauce and like another reviewer suggested, used white wine instead of the chicken broth. Tasted great. I added thinly sliced mushrooms to the sauce once the chicken was simmering and they picked up the flavor right away. Next time I might try marinating overnight for some added flavor to the chicken.

This is absolutely wonderful!  I made some angel hair pasta and took some of the marinade and sauteed it just a touch and my husband loved it!  I like to double the marinade because I use one of the marinades for dipping and one for cooking.  The more the better.

This is awesome!  I unintentionally let this marinade about 30 mins and as another review said i doubled the marinade.  My husband even loved it and he is very picky about sauces.  Thanks for a wonderful addition to my weekly menu!

This was very good.  I tend to like recipes with a lot of sauce.  Since I live alone I often half the meat part of the recipe and leave the rest as is.  I used 2 chicken thighs and the full amount of the marinade.  I just happened to have some frozen pearl onions so added a few of them and they were a nice touch.  I served it with Rice Pilaf to which I added a few frozen peas.  The whole meal was wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!

This had a very wonderful and unique flavor. I followed everything except that I added some salt to it and marinated for about 1 1/2 which I'm so glad I did. Had I not added salt and marinated it longer I think it would have came out more bland and would have not absorbed the flavors as much.  It definitely needs to be marinated longer then 10 minutes. I also made slits in the chicken to help with soaking up the flavors, I'm all about having the flavor in every part of the chicken.:) Next time I will marinate even longer which will then give this recipe a five star!

This recipe is delicious! My boyfriend and I had this with a nice summer salad and some garlic bread and it was to die for! Once you pan fry it correctly... it took me two tries (I am not an expert) to get this right, having charred and burned the chicken the first time. The second time I kept a closer eye on the chicken to make sure it did not burn and lowered the heat on the burner... extra marinate in there seemed to make it burn faster. 

I almost wonder if it would be just as good and less complicated if you pan fried the chicken on its own to prevent burning extra marinade, and then add the sauce to coat it and bubble after...?

Everyone loved this dish.  I doubled the recipe except for the sugar and it was fine.  There wasn't a drop of sauce left.  I agree with other reviewers about using a decent balsamic vinegar.  i use Trader Joe's brand.

We're fans of balsamic vinegar around here so I thought we would love this dish.  I doubled the sauce, like others suggested and I never did get it to thicken.  The chicken was very tender, but just not a flavor we loved.

Really liked this. Might also use it for Basa or Tilapia. Only problem was that the chicken was a bit tough. I think I overcooked it as I was waiting for the leftover marinade to thicken. It never did thicken well until after I turned off the heat. Still good, though.

My husband thought was good. I did not like it at all. I could not even eat it...I went out to dinner. I followed the recpie exactly, chicken plain with a balsamic "gravy " on top..

This is a very tasty!  I followed someone else's idea and grilled the chicken after allowing it to marinate all day. It was great! Next time I might try using brown sugar instead of the white. My family loved this recipe and will be enjoying it for years to come.

Simple, low-calorie, and delicious!  I pounded the chicken to 1/2 inch thickness, and then put them in the pan for about 3 minutes per side.  The thickened marinade was sweet and we did use more of it after tasting it.  Thanks for sharing!

The kids were fighting over who got the last piece!  My son asked my to cook it again tomorrow night. I am making the marinade right now again and I'm going to put shrimp in it and grill them. It's got to be good. This is the best marinade ever!

Very Very Good. I doubled the sauce and used chicken tenderloins( My Preference). Served over
some white rice mixed with mixed vegetables and a spinach salad. The sauce is wonderful and I am sure this can be used with pork. If you love Balsamic, this recipe is for you. Thank You for Sharing

I tried this recipe last night even though my husband hates vinager. I did use brown sugar in place of the white sugar and to keep my husband happy I rolled in flour befor frying because as he likes crisp chicken. Other wise I followed the recipe as printed. He asked for seconds. Enough said.

Most balsamic vinegars from the grocery store are cheap and not aged.  Aged balsamic is much sweeter and can be sipped like a fine wine.  I used a 25 year old aged balsamic vinegar and the flavor was phenomenal.

Excellent marinade! I prefer bone in/skin on chicken pieces, because they have more flavor than boneless skinless breasts.  After marinating chicken overnight, I grill w indirect heat - comes out perfect.   Thanks!

This was good and easy, but pretty messy, which is why I'm giving it 4/5 stars. I made the marinade exactly like the recipe suggests and it was really nice and mild. I was afraid the vinegar flavor would be overpowering. I think the Italian seasoning was key, so if you don't have any, make your own with what you've got! I served it with orzo.

just had this for dinner and we totally enjoyed it. i did double the sauce recipe just to have more. Would cut that back next time and let it carmelize while cooking down. Overall, i think its a great recipe and will use again. Plan on using the marinate when bbq season kicks in.

this was DELICIOUS! my fiance loved it when i made it for her. i didnt have balsamic vinegar so i used apple cider instead. i was concerned about some reviews saying it tasted too "vinegary" so i added 2 extra tablespoons of sugar & 3 tablespoons of brown sugar. the next time i think i'll marinate the chicken for 30 minutes a side, but still a great recipe.

This was superb. I made it almost completely from the listed recipe, I just added some more garlic and it tasted wonderful. very juicy and flavorful. I would make this again.

Made this chicken for dinner tonight.  We served it with simple brown rice and peas.  The taste was terrific!  I followed the recipe exactly (except we only had 3 chicken breasts).  The sauce caramelized nicely so it was a perfect topping for the chicken and the rice.  This is a definite keeper, and I'd be pleased to make it as a main course for guests too.  We'll be having it again soon!

This was very flavorful!  I marinated mine for about 4 hours and then grilled it, which worked very nicely.  I did not brush the marinade on the chicken as we grilled.  It was plenty tasty without adding extra.

I usually just cook chicken and then put balsamic vinegar on it after and it tastes just as good and is faster than this recipe. I think marinading the chicken makes it way too acidic.

Really liked the flavor!  Couldn't get the marinade to thicken on its own and would probably try to tweak it a little next time I make it (add some diced tomatoes, angel hair pasta, parmesan cheese, etc.) to make it a little more interesting, but good basic recipe!

I will have to try it again with modifications such as reducing the amount of sugar or changing the balsamic vinegar and broth ratio. All it tasted like to us was sugared chicken with a hint of balsamic vinegar.

I made this with chicken tenders that I briefly pan-fried. The balsamic flavor comes through nicely. I had a few with some dipping sauce (Honey Mustard Sauce) from this site. The rest I plan to cut up and top a salad with. Much better than the cooked, store-bought marinated chicken that always seems dried out. Thanks - great recipe!

My husband thought it was good. I personally thought it was too sweet. And I used good balsamic. It certainly was easy so I might try it again reducing (or eliminating?) the  sugar. Considering the rave reviews, I was disappointed.

Really good! Followed the recipe exactly, using a quality balsamic vinegar that I could drink straight from the bottle. The only additional step I did was to remove the chicken from the pan and add a tablespoon of cornstarch. We were starving and it seemed to be taking a while to reduce and thicken.  Served with brown rice and steamed veggies. Everyone loved it.

I’ve followed the advice of others, but I find I don’t need to double the marinade, just split it in half. It’s really good and I make it often. Super healthy too!

Was an excellent recipe served with basmati rice. I added a small amount of water and corn starch mix to thicken the sauce at the end.  The next time I make this recipe I will add in some thick slices of sweet Vidalia onion and maybe some mushrooms to give it a kick.

I added about twice the sugar and it was AMAZING!! Sweet but still had a nice acidity to it from the vinegar.

Really, Really Good!!! I know, bc my honey didn’t scrape the sauce off and get out the ketchup!!?? Two big thumbs up for my first taste of anything balsamic vinegar!  I followed the recipe except used minced garlic instead of fresh. We all voted to add this to the dinner rotation!

I agree it is tasty but it was too sweet for us.  Will try it again with less sugar.  We had it with white rice but will try rice pilaf... the saltiness might compliment the sweetness.

I used half the measurements because I had less chicken to work with and it was fantastic. I had a little remaining in marinade and used it in the skillet and cooked noodles in it.

My wife and I liked it.  Only thing I did different was add corn starch and water to thicken the marinade. Next time, as some suggested, add some mushrooms and peppers.

There was nothing wrong with this recipe that I can point out.  It tasted okay for me, simple to make with everything I usually have in the pantry. My Husband didn't go nuts over it but he had no complaints. 

I did make enough for leftovers. Although I didn't serve them as a main dinner protein again, they made an EXCELLENT add to my individual meal planning. I.E., salads, brown rice and veggies, egg white scrambles, etc.

I portion and measure most meals for myself as part of my weekly health/fitness routine and it gets difficult to prepare chicken breasts in ways that are creative.

There's a good probability that I did something wrong when following the recipe. I'll try it again.

This was tasty and quick to make. I added onions, mushrooms, and red peppers when sautéing the chicken. The sauce was just right – not too sweet, not too vinegary.

This recipe was excellent! The only change I made was that I added 1/2 cup of red and yellow bell peppers to the marinade. The sauce wasn’t overly acidic at all, but I also used a high quality balsamic vinegar. I served the chicken over zucchini noodles. It was a big hit!

I have made this chicken more than once. It turns out a little sweet if anything because of the sugar. However the sauce thickness has been inconsistent for me.  My family really likes the chicken.

Since. Moving to a low sodium diet recently, I have been looking for things to cook.  This was one of the first things I I tried. Turned out great. Even my son loved it .. No changes needed as far as I was concerned other than I would let it marinade for longer than 20 mins.  Also it's helpful that all recipes gives a general nutrition label and a host of  low sodium recipes

We loved this!  And as other have mentioned, if the dish tastes vinegary, then next time use a high quality balsamic!  My dish turned out perfectly, great balanced flavors and made exactly as in the recipe.  This is certainly going in rotation for us! Thank you SherryLynn!

Delicious! Made this chicken with sides of garlic mash and broccoli. But instead of 2 tbs sugar, I did 1 tbs sugar & 2 tbs lemon juice. Also made 2 servings of the marinade - 1 to marinate the chicken, and another to reduce and use as sauce.

This chicken does not need all the added sugar, only a little brown sugar. Can also be all put together inside a aluminum foil packet and cooked in an oven or electric toaster oven.  I made it and added some caramelized onions to throw on top Divine. Cook the remaining marinade on the side with the caramelized onions. 
The chicken will be cooking inside the foil packets nice and moist.

I had a whole chicken, so I used the marinade on the split chicken, pan seared it on both sides 5 minutes each.  Then I baked the chicken in the oven at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes.  I reduced the balsamic marinade (boiled it down until concentrated and a bit thickened) , baste it on  the chicken and baked it another 10 minutes or until juices run clear from the leg joints. Cut up tye chicken into pieces, sprinkled some salt  (tasted a little weak without it) and  served this with fresh raspberries.  My teens really enjoyed this!

As it is it's an okay recipe. It is very sweet. Which if you like that then that's great. It's a little too sweet for me and my family. It is very easy to make though! I will make this again but I will probably cut out some of the sugar!

I made it and it was just okay. I did use extra garlic in the marinade, I love garlic. I also used a pinch of salt and my husband actually added more after because he thought it was a little bland. I too thought it was bland, but I will try it again and marinate the chicken breast longer.

Made this for the second time, very easy to prepare and utterly delicious! The only thing I substituted was garlic powder for fresh garlic.

I've made this three times now. Husband loves it. I doubled the marinade so we would have extra and poured over buttered rigatoni, delicious. Definitely a go-to recipe when I need to make something for dinner.

I doubled the recipe and placed everything in a slow cooker on low for 8 hours. Before serving, I placed some of the liquid in a pan and added mushrooms. I placed it on medium heat until the liquid reduced. Very good recipe. Thanks

Was quick and simple with good flavor! I will use much lower heat than med-high as there was burning on the chicken and the marinade and garl7c were both quite black after a short time.

I made two batches of marinade (used brown sugar) because I doubled the chicken. I used 1/2 boneless chicken breasts and 1/2 drumsticks 
So easy and family loved it. If you reduce the marinade to a thicker sauce you don't get a vinegar taste ... I did not use an over the top balsamic vinegar. Wonderful dish

WOW! We gobbled this up! I doubled the sauce (I just really like sauce and it was delicious over the polenta I made with) but I made it exactly as written. The only change I'll make in the future is to cut the chicken into smaller pieces before marinating and cooking. My chicken breasts were too thick and they started to burn before the inside was cooked. Otherwise it's a FANTASTIC recipe. As other reviewers stated, as long as you bring the marinade to a boil (which you need to anyway to thicken it) it's safe. I can't wait to make this again!

Pretty good.  I was more or less looking for a marinade... I used it for chicken, like the recipe and I also used it for tofu. 
Only thing I added was some roasted red peppers and caramelized onion. Served with pasta.  
Would make again.

This turned out super delicious and easy to make! Changed a few things: I added extra seasoning like lemon pepper, pepper, oregano, and parsley, marinated overnight, and used a different batch of sauce for when the chicken is cooking. Using the same sauce is definitely not a good idea.

I followed the recipe exactly and it did produce a very nice thick sauce but the chicken was nothing special. I buy a pretty good quality balsamic which isn't cheap so I don't think I will make this again.

low sodium (if made with salt free Italian seasoning) and my kids happily ate it. quick too. I cut the chicken breast into 1/2" slices so they would soak up more marinade and cook faster.

Man, I was hoping to love this. I used an aged balsamic, which is very thick and sweet, and that could have been the problem. Maybe I'll try it next time with a more conventional balsamic vinegar.

I followed this recipe exactly except I added minced fresh onion sauteed in olive oil before adding chicken.  The whole family loved it...even the kids ate it all and ranked it A+ (including my daughter who hates chicken and any type of vinegar).  Very easy and quick.  It's going in the rotation.

Made for the first time tonight and we loved it (teens included). Like many others, I doubled the marinade. I cut boneless chicken breasts in half to help the marinade along and marinated for 3 hours. Only other change I made was to add unsalted butter to the chicken during the pan-sautée (no oil or fat in the marinade) to keep chicken from drying out and it turned out beautifully. I agree with other posters who recommend the use of a high quality balsamic vinegar. I used balsamic vinegar from Italy (a friend brought it back for me and swore it was the best to be found anywhere - small bottle sealed with a cork and then a hard wax dropped all around the cork to seal it in but tiny paper label was completely in Italian, which I don't speak, so I can offer absolutely no help identifying the brand), I took the time to reduce the marinade and I thickened it using a bit of cornstarch as it was boiling. I think reducing the sauce to distill the vinegar is essential to this recipe. It was AMAZING. I served it with mashed potatoes, southern-style green beans, and cheesy corn muffins. This sauce would be good on most anything - pork, steak, shrimp (I put it on everything tonight but the muffins). Recipe is definitely a keeper for me. Simple, light, quick to put together, and I had everything on hand. Thanks so much for this restaurant-quality recipe, SherryLynn2!

I tasted it as it was cooking and thought it wAS too acidic but after letting it cook until the sauce was almost gone the flavor changed and was delicious. I served this with cheesy noodles which did not compliment it well. next time I will try mashed potatoes and a side salad. but overall a nice alternative way to make chicken.

Great recipe but next time I will use less balsamic vinegar as vinegar taste was a little overwhelming.

This is one of my favorites. I let the chicken soak longer, usually a couple hours. I love how the sugar caramelizes when you cook the chicken and it's so moist and flavorful. We serve over rice. I could eat this every week!

I really enjoyed this recipe, but don't forget to season with salt. I noticed the recipe didn't include this and it's pretty bland without a dash. 

Went great with my mac and cheese and I have leftover for wraps, salads, etc. This recipe is a great addition to my recipe book!

This is a keeper. I pounded the chicken so it was even thickness throughout, and marinated it for about 30 minutes.  My marinade was basic Colavita balsamic vinegar, oregano, rosemary, garlic, a sprinkle of white sugar, and salt to offset the bitter undertone of less expensive balsamic vinegar.  The oregano and rosemary were because I mysteriously could not locate any other Italian seasonings in the pantry. A gremlin has been cooking in my kitchen, I think.  I made a triple batch of marinade, and used 1/3 as the marinade which was discarded afterward, and 2/3 as the sauce.  I put the sauce on the stove top first and cooked it down until it slightly began to thicken, then added  the chicken pieces, covered the pan, and put it in the oven at 350 degrees F to oven braise until it was tender. I had to do it in the oven because I did not have time to babysit the stove top for the few minutes it took to cook. I served it with roasted buttercup squash, and fresh green beans cooked on the stovetop covered in Swansons reduced sodium chicken broth, garlic, fresh ground black pepper, and a slice of streak-of-lean meat.  I put a bit of cooked marinade over the chicken on the plate, and reserved the rest to season veggies, rice, or potato in the next couple of days.  It was all a quick to prepare meal, attractive, and very well received by kids and adults!

I just tried this recipe, and it was great! I did tweak it a bit, however. I found the marinade to be a bit too acidic, so I added a bit of water, a bit more sugar and a splash of soy sauce and it came out beautifully! Wonderful with some steamed vegetables.

I was expecting a savory taste to the sauce and found it to be too sweet.  I would reduce the sugar a little next time and probably add a littles salt or use regular chicken broth (I used low sodium chicken broth).

Marinade/Sauce very yummy. I did the marinade for about an hour and a half but I would either marinade overnight or poke some holes in a thick chicken breast. Or use thin cutlets. I will be using this marinade/sauce on some thin cut pork chops tonight. I'm also thinking that when I grill up some steaks (if I ever get any propane) I'm going to try the sauce reduction on top. I did use a very good aged balsamic so that helps. I'm going to double the marinade/sauce as it is really really good on some steamed broccoli as well. I'm very happy I tried this recipe. I really wasn't up to making dinner last night but found this recipe and didn't think it was too labor intensive for a horrible cook such as myself. I've got to say the sauce is freaking awesome and would work on a wide variety of meats and veggies.

Simple and delicious.  After hosting a party all day and not eating, I made this as a late night protein kick to quench my hunger before bed.  I paired it with some simple buttered noodles to keep it light, and the sauce added a strong zesty splash of flavor.  Will definitely make again.

This is very tasty.  I marinated the meat for about 3 hours, then grilled it.  While it was grilling, I boiled down the marinade on the stove and basted the meat.  I served it with oven roasted red potatoes and mixed veggies.  Very good meal!

Fantastic! My husband had a second and a THIRD helping and my picky son finished his plate without a word. That speaks volumes! I followed the recipe very closely, I only substituted half the white sugar for brown sugar. (Not sure if it made a difference though)

Made it as written, with the addition of 1 tbsp of brown sugar. I would recommend pounding the chicken breasts flat -- mine were a bit thick and were not cooked after 15 minutes. I simmered them for an additional 15 minutes which made them a bit dry. Otherwise, very good flavor. I served with pearl couscous and curried cauliflower!

My family cannot get enough of this chicken.  I try to make enough for left overs and scarcly have any left over of this chicken.  Tasty and delicous
Oh and since i don't usually have chicken broth on hand... i just melt a chicken bouillon cube in boiling water.  Once water cools I add it to the marinade. Same thing still yummy

I cut the chicken breasts into medallions, removing the medallions from the pan after they had browned and returning them to the pan at the very end to coat into the balsamic reduction.  We thought it was a good dish.

I love balsamic vinegar, but this was just to overwhelming in flavor.  Will not be making this again.

As per other reviews, I doubled the sauce, but I did add 1 cup of white wine.

Marinated chicken thighs for 2 hours (with 1/2 the sauce), but would marinate longer next time.

While potatoes were cooking, I reduced the remaining 1/2 marinate in a cast iron skillet, adding a slight amount of corn starch to thicken.  This produced a thick, sweet, but tangy sauce to drizzle over the quartered fried mushrooms that I also cooked, and other vegis, rice, etc.  

Cooked the chicken as per the recipe.  Adding the remaining marinate to the chicken towards the end gave the chicken a beautiful, caramelized finish.

Absolutely Fantastic!!!!

The marinade gave this a bit of sweetness, which cut the vinegar. I marinated about 20 minutes then sliced the raw breasts and cooked them in slices for faster, even cooking.  It would be delicious in a salad.

It was good for something different.  One of my kids liked it and the other didn't.  It wasn't bad, but not necessarily in one of my top favorites.

I loved it, My family loved it. I just made some small changes like everyone else. My thing is I don't see why you would want to waste marinade and make a second batch, as long as you cook and heat the marinade thoroughly it should be fine, I've done this at least 20 times in the same recipe and no one has died. I pour the chicken and marinade in at the same time and i make sure the marinade bubbles and thickens into a delicious sauce. I'm not rich and balsamic isn't cheap. My changes included Worcestershire sauce and fresh herbs if I have them. I love adding rosemary, and I add the olive oil straight into the the marinade.

Tried this recipe tonight and it was absolutely fantastic, I paired it with Jasmine rice which worked nicely. I also grilled the marinated chicken so I reduced the second batch of marinade after putting the chicken on the grill and then brushed on the glaze for the last 3 or 4 minutes of cooking.

I made this exactly as the recipe said and it got rave reviews in our house!  The prefect tangy sweet chicken.  I cut the chicken into strips before marinating and doubled the marinade so there would be more sauce then served it over hot noodles.   Awesome!

This was very good.  We didn't have Italian seasoning so we just threw some spices together.  I served it with wild rice and mixed vegetables.  Will definitely be making again.

I had never had balsamic chicken until I made this recipe. At first, I was a little unsure about it because of the smell of balsamic vinegar, but after I tried it, I was sold! Even my husband enjoyed it, and he's rather hard to please when it comes to new food.

This was fabulous! I was short on time so i sliced the chcken before marinading. It took less cooking time and then served over pasta. Next time I will double the marinade if I serve over pasta. Restaurant quality.

It took a little more time to get the chicken up to the correct internal temperature.

My dad and I really enjoyed this dish. I used just a little more than half of the sugar and it came out plenty sweet. My dad is a diabetic, which is the reasoning for toning down the sugar. I think I might even go with just a tablespoon flat next time!

We both agreed we'd want to have this again. As a side note, I have no idea how I keep churning out great dishes in this incredibly warped pan of mine. I only break it out for recipes like this: where I want to fix up four servings of something instead of two!

Anyway, great recipe. We'll definitely be trying this again. This one's going into the "keepers" folder.

YUMMY!  The only thing I did different was doubled the sauce.  My 2 year old, 13 year old and hubby all loved it too!

Must use good balsamic, aged 4 yrs or more, and then reduce that with the other ingredients.

Very excellent and easy to make!  I sub'ed the white sugar with brown, and used whatever dry herbs I had on hand and it turned out absolutely fantastic!  I served this with a spinach salad and also some roasted leeks...so yummy!

This chicken was sweet and spicy, the taste was really good.  I was surprised that it came out so well; I was unsure about the balsamic.  But surprisingly it did, and I'll be making this again.  =)  The only thing I changed was my spices.  Instead of using Italian Herb seasoning I used curry, paprika, salt, pepper, and a little bit of tarragon.

Excellent recipe. The breasts are VERY juicy. I tend to marinade mine a bit longer. About 3 hours is just fine. Its my boyfriend's new favorite!

Really enjoyed! Even my picky husband liked it!  I will probably add a little less sugar next time.  I also used chicken breast tenders instead of the chicken breasts and marinated them for about 1 1/2 hours. One hour would probably be enough.

This was so easy to make!  I made a few changes to the ingredients:  

- coconut sugar instead (and I'd put a less than what the recipe calls for)
- 4 cloves of garlic 
- 1/4 tsp sage, 1/4 tsp basil, 1/4 tsp marjoram, 1/4 oregano (didn't have Italian seasoning)

I marinated the chicken for 2 days.  It turned out so juicy and had a nice flavour!  Served it with a side of veggies and a simple pasta tossed in EVOO, sauteed garlic, basil and parmesan.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

This was absolutely wonderful! Quick and easy. I did marinate the chicken for about an hour though. The chicken turned out juicy and such great flavor. The balsamic vinegar did not make it bitter at all. I will be making this again especially for company!

This was a tasty change for chicken, but it needed marinated longer, as others have said.  I marinated it about 45 min. and it wasn't enough to let the full flavor soak in.  I also pounded the chicken breasts and would recommend it for more moist results.

I don't know....I marinaded for about 1.5 hrs.  I didn't find it bad.  But it was't that tasteful.  I had even added some honey to sweeten the acidity cause I knew my kids would be snubbing vinagar.  Don't know what I did, but it wasn't a winner with out family.

Great marinade! I used wings and put them in my Showtime (Set it and Forget it). Yummy! They were crispy on the outside and juicy inside. (50 mins).

This didn't blow me away the way it did for many other reviewers. It was good, but not so much that Ii goes in my keeper file. I did make a few changes: I used light brown sugar i/o white and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I cooked the first batch of chicken as per the instructions and then decided to lightly dust the second batch in flour before frying and everyone agreed that they liked those pieces better. It also helped thicken the sauce (which I did in two batches; one for marinating and the other for cooking/serving).  I actually enjoyed a cold piece of chicken better the following day. It was good, but not four-star good. :)

Did  not care for the chicken. They are almost poached in the pan. I love chicken and balsamic vinegar. Thought it would be a good recipe. I thought the chicken was dry and did not like the sauce. maybe I didn't marinade them enough or something. Not a fan.

I thought the chicken lacked flavor.  The sauce however was increadible.  I left out the sugar which I now regret.  I don't think I will try this again.  If you like lots of flavor I don't recommend this recipe

I followed this exactly,I did not pound chicken flat,I cooked the chicken 7 min on each side using tongs to turn the chicken as not to pierce the chicken and it came out moist not dry as others had stated there's had came out, the only change I made was to use brown sugar instead of white because that was all I had. This was a nice change of pace and I will make again.

Really enjoyed this and my 14 month old son ate the chicken too!  The reduction is sweet, which we both liked but didn’t expect.  I followed other user’s advice and used high quality balsamic and a good olive oil.  I also doubled the marinade recipe for 6 chicken breast halves.  I will most certainly make this again but when I do I’m planning on reducing the marinade WHILE I cook the chicken in a separate sauce pan - with double the sauce it took quite a while to reduce.

I loved this dish, it was so easy to prepare. I cut the chicken into cubes and marinaded for a few hours. I actually served this with the pineapple fried rice also on this site. My husband can be difficult to please but he agreed this was delicious. Excellent, thank you for sharing

I followed this recipe to the letter and it could not have tasted any better.  Just wonderful.  I don't think I have ever had a chicken breast that tasted so good.  My wife any asked for seconds which almost never happens.  Good Job!

The chicken was moist but I was very disappointed in the flavor. I love vinegars of all kinds so I was hoping for more of a 'pop' to the flavor. My husband and I both voted to not repeat this one again with all the other recipes available.

Love this recipe! Made exactly as is, served with rice. Even my 2 yr. old ate all his chicken by dipping it in the sauce. Will definitely make again!

I followed instructions exactly but doubled the recipe. I soaked the chicken in salt water first. My family loved it, even the picky ones. My daughter asked to have the leftovers for lunch.

My husband and I tried this recipe tonight and we both loved it! I used a little extra Italian seasoning, and I think I may have had the pan a little hot because the chicken breasts got a little blackened on one side. Still, it tasted great, and we'll definitely give this one another go!

the sauce was great! I made these with balsamic glazed artichoke, and they blended nicely as a meal.  However, the chicken was overcooked, so 7 minutes on each side plus the additional 5 at the end is too long.

Had to make a chicken dish quickly, found this.  Wow, what a find! I didn't change a thing (although didn't use most of the marinade at the end).  This was absolutely wonderful.  My picky 11 yr old ate all her chicken up...we all ranted and raved over the tenderness of it all.   Just Delish!!!  Thanks!

I just made this for dinner and my kids LOVED it!  You really have to reduce the marinade on this so the vinegar taste isn't as strong. The marinade wasn't thickening and I didn't want to overcook the breasts so I took them out and then brought the sauce to a boil in the pan. Perfect!

Delicious!!! This is an awesome recipe. The instructions were simple and not too complicated. I didn't have any Italian herb seasoning and it still turned out terrific. Very yummy indeed. Thanks SHERRYLNN2!

The balsamic marinade for this chicken was very flavorful and delicious - yummy!  I did not make any changes.  I like the idea of marinating the chicken all night and putting it on the grill.  My boyfriend commented how much he liked it so it must be really good!!  We will be using this recipe again.

This recipe was really easy and very delicious!  I made two baches of the marinade and used the other batch on the veggies.  I followed that directions and marinaded the chicken for 10 minutes on each side.  If you don't have a lot of time...the 20 minutes worked well.  But if you prepare the recipe earlier, marinating the chicken overnight would be great too.  My husband and I loved it and I am sharing the recipe with people at work.

great- i was surprised- i thought it would be more tart- but the sugar melded out the flavors quite nicely- i did add more garlic and a touch more sugar.

i didn't marinate the chicken (i just cooked the chicken with salt and pepper), but i did reduce the sauce and roll the chicken around in it before i served it. I thought the sauce was delicious, but it was a bit too sweet for my taste (i LOVE vinegar). Next time i will take the time to marinate the chicken.

Only change I made was to add olive oil to the marinade (about equal parts vinegar and oil) so it wouldn't stick to the grill. Agree with previous reviewer and would make two batches of the marinade next time so we could use one as a sauce. Raves from all around the table!

This recipe was a big hit with the folks! My Dad usually will not eat chicken breast because it's dry and has no flavor...he went for seconds and raved about every bite he took!! His last words: "hold on to that recipe"!

LOVE this recipe! It needs some veggies tossed with it, though, so tonight I'm trying it again with asparagus. So easy and great flavor-husband loved it, too!
