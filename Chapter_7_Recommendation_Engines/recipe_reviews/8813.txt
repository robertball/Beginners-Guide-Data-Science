This is a good base. I add onions and a little garlic, and chopped boiled egg. My friends and family tell me I make the best chicken salad they have ever tasted. I don't measure the mayo, I add less when it's for my husband and I because we like it dryer, and more when I serve it to company.

This recipe could not be easier.  I actually used a rotisserie chicken from my local grocery store.  As for the other reviewer and the mayo comment just put the mayo in tablespoon at a time until you get to your desired consistancy.  I will definitely keep this basic chicken salad recipe.

This is delicious, if you eat mayo by itself. All it tasted like was mayo. Even after letting it set overnight.

This was a really good place to start, I used left over chicken from the Roast Sticky Chicken Rotisseri Style recipe from this site, I added onions, celery, boiled eggs, duke mayo and garlic powder, season salt and paprika. Chilled a couple of hours and serve.

okay...cook the chicken after marinating it in italian dressing first overnight, salt and pepper it, then dice it, add some onion along with celery, your favorite herbs, and with the mayo, add a dash or two of teriyaki sauce--its my secret ingredient. This recipe is a good base, but it needs some flavor!

Great basic recipe.  I add chopped red onion and pickle relish to my dish.  It would also taste great with grapes and apples added.

Very Good as is! I also used this recipe as a base to make my pasta salad. I used half the amount of chicken and added rotini pasta (cooked and rinsed with cold water) and 1/4 cup sweet pickle relish. It's become a favorite with my family in the summer. Thanks!

This is a great recipe. Very east to make. I added some garlic and onion along with some pepper to spice it up a bit and added fat free mayo 1 tablespoon at a time. This was great taking to work for lunch in a large tomato, on a bed of salad greens, or even in a wrap with some lettuce.

Tried this for lunch one day. I used a can of chicken, onion, relish, mayo, and salt free spice. It was a HUGE hit with my family! Decided against the celery because I have a family member allergic to it. was wonderful!

Jeanette, this was a great dish.  I started there and made a few changes for my taste, but yours is very tasty....as long as you use chicken which is not salty to start with, salt-free spice blend, etc.  I agree with everyone who rated this at 2-4 stars and changed everything.  I made it with beef, onion, sour cream, and seasoned salt.  EXACTLY the way Jeanette posted it.....>

Good basic recipe and I hope allrecipes keeps such things because sometimes I forget the simplest things. I made this a lot in college and added some tomato ketchup which added some zing if you don't have any other spices or sauces.

Funny, all the high star reviews added a ton of stuff to this. By itself, it's blah. No flavor, just chicken and mayo with a little crunch. However, it's the base for pretty much any chicken salad so do this and then add what you like. I added bacon, chunks of cheddar cheese, and a little bit of diced dill pickle.

If I'd followed the recipe as written it would've been too much mayo, also it was very bland until I added several more ingredients.

This would be way too plain for me.  I added salt & pepper, raisins, chopped pecans, sweet pickle relish, paprika, onions and it was so yummy!!
I would have added hard boiled eggs, but I didn't have any eggs.  I have no measurements - just added and tasted!

Great start, I like it! Add a touch of cider vinegar, a pinch of garlic powder and some green grapes chopped up. That and I actually use leftover roasted chicken.

I made this and my family ate it all we had no left overs. Great Recipe! I threw the ckicken in the crock pot before work when I got home I put it together and put it in flour tortillas and added some purple grapes (cut up) and some sugared walnuts. Huge hit! Thank you!

Instead of regular mayo, I added .5 cup of Greek yogurt mayo and .5 + cup of mayo made from avocado oil and served in a toasted pita bread.

This is a perfect base recipe, because it is so easy to make it your own.  I added a homemade Cajun seasoning to mine.

This was very simple and quick to make. My husband likes chicken salad without all of the bells and whistles. I made one bowl per the recipe for him and it was very good. However, the second bowl was even better (in my opinion not his)! I added onion, garlic, and green grapes. Either way, I'll be making this again!

Followed the recipe, very simple to make. The only things that I did differently was I put fresh herbs and not the mix, and I put not only cooked onions but fresh onions after and I like corn, tomatoes and lettuce in mine!

As is...boring.  I then did as other reviewers  did and added garlic, chopped red onion and green  olives stuffed with jalapeños  and hard boiled eggs.  I used Greek yogurt and mayo combined which helped the flavor also.   Turned it into 4 stars!

This is a great starter recipe that with a few alterations is great. I used a leftover rotisserie chicken and used the celery and mayo called for in the recipe. Aside from salt and pepper, I added cayenne pepper, garlic powder, parsley, and a small amount of anchovy oil that I had leftover from making Caesar salad dressing. Turned out fabulously.

Loved the crunchiness of the water chestnuts and celery! I didn't have the green grapes or green onions and I planned on adding the swiss cheese before serving but I forgot since I made it the night before. I loved the flavors later, I added the swiss but prefer it without. It needs more mayo then recommended too. Definitely a keeper! Will make again!

I used the white meat from last night's leftover orange herb roasted chicken. I added dill relish,  sweet relish, Bragg Organic Sprinkle 24 herbs and spices seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, fresh dill, chives,  and scallions from my herb garden, and a pinch of garlic sea salt and smoked paprika. I also added the mayo a little at a  time.  I served it on fresh Swiss Chard from the garden with crackers and a garden fresh green onion as a garnish. Scrumptious!
You can't go wrong with this basic recipe. Just add what spices you and your family enjoy!

Tasted great even with one can of chicken (I ran out of the roasted chicken breast).  Also added relish and a sprinkle of paprika for color.

I made this yesterday and it is a definite YUM! I love chicken salad and wanted to give my hubby something different for his lunch at work. I boiled a whole chicken in chicken broth until it started falling apart. I also added some chicken stock that I had frozen from when I made a chicken pot pie so the chicken was very flavorful. Did not have to add any spices except cracked pepper. Chopped up celery and onion; added mayo to taste and desired texture. Came out great. Served it on toast w/lettuce and tomato. He told me that it held up really well w/the toast, didn't get soggy.

THis is a very basic recipe,chicken especially if you use just breast meat is a little bland. I add onion and garlic powder along with lots of sweet pickle salad cubes along with the celery,always get rave reviews over my chicken salad!

Made a couple of modifications of course; but I agree that this is a good basic recipe.  I had two cups of diced cooked chicken left from a roast chicken.  To that I added 1/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp calorie wise Miracle Whip and 1/2 tsp freshly ground herbs Provencal.  Nice light flavour; chicken just moistened - one could add additional Miracle Whip or mayo if you like it creamier.
