I am FAR from a cook at home.  All I can do is saute vegetables and scramble eggs, my husband does the rest.  My mom made this for him one time and he loved it.  I started to make it.  It is easy and tastes great!  The only thing is there can be no clumps of cream cheese or it won't taste right.

This corn souffle was ok.  We have been on a corn bread kick lately and this is not one of the better recipes that we have made.  Won't be making again.

Mine took a little longer to bake, but it was likely the pan I made it in.  Family loved it and so simple to make.

This is very similar to a recipe I've been making for years but I didn't feel like finding mine in whatever cookbook it is buried in.  I don't ever use my old cookbooks anymore and can't remember where my favorites are.  Anyway, the difference between my original recipe and this is the cream cheese (mine used sour cream).  I really like this recipe better -moister but still rose beautifully.  It has great flavor and baked up easily.  The only change I made was to add 1/2 of a large finely chopped white onion. The baking time was about 10 minutes longer than listed - depends on size of your pan and mine was probably deeper than wider than who contributed this recipe.  One thing - make sure your cream cheese is softened at room temperature.  Mine was still alittle cool and didn't blend well because of that.  I had a few pockets of cream cheese bits once baked which didn't look very good.  As others have said, be sure to wait to top with the cheese until the last 10 minutes.  I will definitely make again. I might add a can of diced green chilies next time to mix it up.

I made here in China with fresh corn, no cream cheese (tried to use processed cheese slices and Red Mill Corn bread mix. It turned out too dry. Still, my workers liked it, they don't bake much in China.

Loved this recipe!  Brought to pot luck dinner and had many positive responses.  The dish was empty so it must have been good.  Many people requested the recipe.

Definite hit, tripled the recipe for my 24 oz. package of cornbread mix and added an additional 1 1/2 cups of cheddar cheese to the batter.  Overfilled a 13x9 pan, but everyone loved it.  Next time I'll use a lasagna pan.  :)

Yummy!  Pure comfort food.  I don't know why the green onions are listed as a footnote because they really give it a nice flavor.  I chopped up 3 of them and stirred into the batter.  They really enhance the flavor of this dish.  I think it might have been a little bland without them.  Instead of adding the cheese on top, I just stirred it into the mix as well.  Came out perfect and wonderful.  It took an hour to bake for me.  This recipe is nearly identical to Awesome and Easy Corn Casserole from this site and I have made it several times with and without the green onions.  Trust me, you don't want to leave them out.  Can serve as a side to anything and is good warm, cold, or room temperature.

I don't really like corn bread nor do I like cream cheese.  This recipe is AMAZING!  I made it for a Friendsgiving event with 20 people, and it was gone in seconds!  SO GOOD!  I've made it 3 times since then!

It was awful. I followed directions perfectly. I was embarrassed to see that none of my guests would eat it. A waste of time and money.

This is a great recipe!  Made it as a side dish at Christmas and it was a hit!  I added some chopped jalapeno as we like it a little spicy, but you don't have to tweak it to be great!  A definite keeper!

Made by the recipe except I used the hand mixer. I also added the cheese for the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Turned out really well.  Will definitely make again!!

We loved it! Easy to put together and to cook also. We did leave out the Cheddar cheese, not a fan of it.  The dish was a hit at Thanksgiving.

This was really tasty and rich. I made it for our Thanksgiving feast. Funny that my niece brought over the same dish! She said she got the recipe and her family eats it all the time now. I made mine with non-fat cream cheese and it was still rich as can be.
