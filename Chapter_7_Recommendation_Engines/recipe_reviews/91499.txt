I have done this several times, perfectly following the recipe the first time, then throwing rules out and following only the second HALF of the recipe after. I have subbed, omitted, or added as I found differences in my pantry from what the recipe calls for. I give this a 5 star rating based not only on the recipe but also on the friendliness with which it accepts adaptation. We now use plain sauteed chicken breast chunks, no frying required, remove them from the skillet, start the sauce, toss them back in at the end. After doing it the "right" way I can honestly say this recipe is also perfect the way we do it now, and has gone from a time-consuming Sunday dinner to a quick weeknight prep that my family requests frequently. We have even had it two nights in a row by demand! And there have NEVER been leftovers. *^_^* I double sauce too, it's what I eat over rice now, since after dishing up for two boys, a teenage girl, a very hungry man, and a baby girl who likes EVERYTHING, there's not much LEFT but sauce! We love it. I hope it might save some time for others who are put off by the double fry, to know it's perfectly delicious done this way. It saves time, fat (!), and the individual ingredients each still shine. Thanks for sharing this with us ChefDaddy!

Okay, so in my humble opinion, when ordering General Tso Chicken, Sesame Chicken or Orange Chicken from a Chinese restaurant, the base sauce reicpe is the same, they simply add spice to the General Tso, sesame seeds to the Sesame Chicken, and orange peel (with a little spice) to the Orange Chicken. So, that being said, you can do the same with this recipe. I omitted the red chili's because I don't like the spice and added a little extra orange peel because I like it citrusy. I also used fresh ginger (chopped) instead of ground and again, it's just a personal preference. The soy sauce I used was called Ponzi sauce which is a soy sauce with a citrusy flavor to it....are you starting to see the pattern with me =) All in all this is a great recipe and I will definitely be making again and again. Thank you ChefDaddy!!

This was almost exactly the flavor we were looking for. We did use chicken breasts instead of thighs but literally was the best General's we've ever tasted. The sauce was wonderful, could really taste the hint of orange, sesame, peanut, chili pepper.  Not sure I understand the double fry method but I followed it exactly and was rewarded with the best homemade or restaurant chinese we've ever tasted.  Give this one a try, it was fantastic.

Wow! This was really terrific- tastes exactly like Chinese restaurant General Tsao's. 
I did not have peanut oil, so I winged it with a T. of peanut butter and that worked well, and it also thickened the sauce so I got to skip the last step with the cornstarch, even though I also added 1/3 cup of orange juice to it earlier.
I use fresh ginger juice for everything, and it was a little brighter in flavor than the powder. 
Our guests really went wild over this- they simply couldn't believe that this recipe could be made so easily at home. My only complaint...no leftovers for lunch today :(

This recipe is incredable!!!  We did "tweek " it a bit.  First, prepare your seasonings!!!  It makes the cooking and mess so much better (I learned the hard way the first time.)  Also, double the sauce.  I also added a pinch of 5 spice (found at your Asian market) and it made the sauce come to life.

Delicious! This was so good, I will definitely make again and again.  I was stretched for time, so I pan fried the chicken with a little vegetable and sesame oil.  I wanted to add some vegetables so I added bell pepper and snow peas.  When I was sauteeing the garlic, I added one chopped sweet onion.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and substituted orange juice (about 1/3 cup) for the orange zest and substituted peanut butter (about 1 tablespoon) for the peanut oil and eliminated the green onion.  I also didn't have whole red chilies, so I added some crushed red pepper (about 1/8 teaspoon).  Put everything over some brown rice and it was wonderful!

This is just like you get in a chinese restaurant.  My family likes it saucy, so I made it with double the sauce.  Also I couldn't find the dry red peppers so I used a chinese red pepper paste which allowed me to adjust the hot spicy temperature up a bit (my family likes it hot) wish there was a way to deep fry the chicken with less mess, but it is worth it!

Yum!  Definatly will make again.  I pan fried the chicken in just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan well, as to make is a touch more healthy and only did the frying once.  Otherwise, stuck to the recipe and yum yum yum.  Normally, I give 5 stars to restaurant quality, and although not quite that, really good, and satisfied my chinese need.

Delicious. I followed the recipes with only a few differences. Couldn't find a good price on thighs so I used breasts. Didn't want to buy peanut and sesame oil for one recipe, I didn't miss it. I loved it and so did the family, but next time I will cut open some of the chilis and add more, it just wasn't spicy enough for our hot mouths. I want more orange flavor, but my husband doesn't. So until he makes this himself, I will add more orange peel. I will use less soy sauce also, I think it hide some of the other flavors. Good recipe, thanks.

F.Y.I. if you're abroad and can't find cornstarch, flour works all the same. Still turned out delicious.

I stumbled upon this recipe quite a while ago and forgot to review it. I made a ton of changes, but it wasn't due to preference, it was more due to a lack of ingredients in the house. However, it still came out excellent, so here's a way you can sub a few things and still have it come out really good: Used boneless/skinless breast instead of thighs, regular onion, 1/4 cup (or more depending on personal preference) of chili powder instead of chilis, 2 tsp of orange extract instead of zest, regular white vinegar instead of rice, and substituted all of the oils with regular oil, but added 2 tbsp of peanut butter to give it that peanut oil flavor. VERY IMPORTANT to use the double fry method though, this keeps the chicken super crispy! Excellent recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe! We followed the directions just as they were written, and really liked the sauce, not as thick and sugary as restaurants. Also frying the chicken twice made it nice a crunchy and not goopy.

Absolutely delicious.  Most flavorful General Tsao's Chicken that I have ever had.  Followed the recipe as directed with one exception.  Had to substitute red pepper seeds for the whole chilies.  I used about a teaspoon full.  This gave the meal a nice amount a heat without overpowering my children's palate.  Thank you for sharing!

Fantastic! I marinated the chicken in soy sauce, white wine, vinegar, and brown sugar for a few hours. I tossed with cornstarch and pan fried instead of deep frying. The result isn't as crispy but even the crispiest chicken gets soggy after a couple minutes in sauce. I added fresh ginger and used chili garlic sauce instead of dried chilis. It tasted completely "authentic" (for a dish that typifies inauthenticity) and was well worth the calories.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would do so! This was absolutely DELICIOUS!  The whole family tore it up, NO leftovers. Definitely of restaurant quality, if not better. I have tried many homemade oriental recipes and NONE are as good. 
I'm not sure what the purpose is of double frying, but will continue to do so as I don't want to chance it affecting the awesome outcome.
THANK YOU!!!!

I am only rating the sauce in this recipe because that is the only part I used.  The only substitution was I used 2 tsp. of chili paste in place of the dried chilies because that is what I had.  As far as the chicken, I used the batter recipe from the Perfect Sesame Chicken from this site (which I have used before sucessfully).  Also, I baked the chicken instead of frying it this time and I have to say, I liked it better baked - tasted better to me,  leaves less mess to clean up and is more healthy anyway.  I will definately use this sauce recipe again, but maybe cut back on the sugar a little bit and use more orange peel.

Excellent! ... ... the only modifications i made, were cut out some of the oil, to make it a little healthier.  And I added a little chopped bell pepper & celery.  Other than it, this recipe is excellent!  Thanks for sharing!

This was fantastic!  I will definitely make this again.  I am glad I got the ingredients ready as other posters suggested as the sauce comes together rather quickly.  I rated this 4 stars but I wish I could give it 4 and a half.  It was great but it was a little too sweet for me.  Next time I will reduce the sugar.  Overall a terrific dish and well worth the effort!

Yum!  Just like a good Chinese restaurant's!  This is very spicy (normal for General Tso's Chicken). The technique for coating the chicken is something I had not heard of before, and it worked great!  The coating gets nice and crunchy and stays on the chicken.   I followed the recipe almost exactly... just used fresh ginger instead of ground, black pepper instead of white, and added some broccoli while cooking the sauce.  I saved a little time and some clean-up by using one large non-stick chef pan for the entire process:  I poured out the oil and wiped the pan with a paper towel after frying the chicken, then returned 2T of the hot, used oil back into the hot pan to continue with the onions, etc.

I have never left a review before, but I just couldnt help it. THIS WAS AMAZING !!! My husband's VERY picky and hard to please when it comes to "trying something new". However this had blown away. I didnt have any peanut oil so from my research it was okay to use canola.I also used 3 tbl of orange juice early in step 3.Everything was perfect. I can hear him on the phone bragging about dinner now :-) !!Thanks for sharing!

The only adaptations I made were to toss broccoli in during the last minutes of thickening the sauce, and since the sauce needed only 3 tbs of chicken broth, I made a cup of bullion, used the 3 tbs and then used 1/4 c of the rest to mix with the cornstarch to thicken. I also did put the (white breast) chicken chunks in a fryer, then finished them for 10 minutes or so in a 425 degree oven before tossing them into the sauce. Yes, you can use plain chicken, but that's stir fry with Tsao's sauce, this is the real thing! You won't find a restaurant in town that can beat this recipe. I used to work in a Chinese restaurant in high school,their food was wonderful, but this is the best. Definitely use dried red chilies and fresh grated ginger.

The chicken part was delicious.  The sauce is too thick and sticky.  Less starch would have given it a better consistency.  As well, we used half the sugar for the sauce and it still tasted good.  The hot dried chilli peppers should be cooked in the oil first and then the other ingredients added afterward to bring out the chili flavour.

This recipe is great! My husband loves General Taos and actually prefers this over his favourite restaurant's version. Make sure you have all the sauce ingredients ready to go. First time I made this I took too long and ended up with a savoury caramel sauce. Still good, but a little strange.

I used 1 tbsp. of peanut butter instead of the peanut oil because I didn't have any, but it turned out great! We are definitely planning on making this again!

It was easy to make and easily outshone the take out we usually have. I did not have the dried chillies and used a chilli sauce found at my local Asian market (there is a whole shelf dedicated to this ONE sauce you can't miss it). The dish still turned out great.

Alright, This Sauce Is Probably the Best general chicken sauce.  I did what another reviewer said Added the 1/4 Orange juice, and a t of peanut butter.  I still put in the orange peel.  I used the Chicken breast instead of the thigh.  Next time i will try the thigh.  The Breast was a little tough.  But that's not what the recipe is about so i couldn't take off for that.  If you use the breast only deep fry it for 1/2 the time they call for.  I had my oil up where it's supposed to be like around 325.  But i think the chicken should also be coated with something besides the egg.  I made another general chicken recipe that was on here the chicken was better than the sauce.  But this Sauce is awesome. So next time i'll look for a coating for my chicken. But use this sauce.

I love this recipe,  the flavors are delicious together.  The only thing I did differently was I used chicken breast and I pan fried using only enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Not sure why we needed to fry twice but did it anyway, and was surprised that the chicken was cooked perfectly. I will definitely make this again and again. I might try it with less sugar next time just to see how it tastes because it seemed very filling.

I think it tastes delicious even though I only deep fry once. It is just too much oil and sugar. Very delicious though so I will cook this once in a while. At least cooking it myself is healthier than Panda Express. Hahaha. All of my housemates really enjoyed it, so it's definitely a keeper. I recommend doubling the serving size to 12 if you're going to serve 6, because only chicken, broccoli, and rice is not enough. It tastes so good that people want seconds!

This took me twice as long to make but that was mainly because I was overly cautious about the whole process. I bought bone-in thighs so I had to spend extra time cutting those out. And I made double the amount as my family LOVES chinese food. I doubled all the sauce but used less of the chilies ((as I didn't want it too hot for my kiddos)) I cut only one pepper into pieces to put in with the sauce...I think that it needed much more heat as it was pretty sweet. But no major complaints. I will have as much of this prepped as I can next time...and YES, there will definitely be a next time!! =)

This is so yummy!  I substitute arrowroot powder for the cornstarch, it does the same thing without the GMO or when I didn't have either I used our herb flour mixture both ways turned out yummiful!  I only use 4 chilli peppers as I don't care for hot food but I still like the flavor of them.  It's so nice that my gluten-free brother can eat General Tsao's chicken again! :)

One of the few dinners my extremely picky daughter gets excited about!  Absolutly delicious.  I do double the sauce and instead of peanut oil, I substitute hot pepper oil.  We like a bit of bite.

This was an OUTSTANDING recipe. I thought it was better than most Chinese restaurants I've tried! I was lacking a few ingredients, so I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted chili flakes for the whole peppers and peanut butter for peanut oil. I also saved some green onions to sprinkle fresh on the final product. Served with white rice and broccoli as suggested, and my boyfriend and I both loved it. No complaints here, will definitely make again.

Yes this was really good. I just wished that the chicken was a tad crispier. I still haven't figured out how the restaurants achieve this. Other than that this is definitely a keeper!

impressive! I did as it is in here but next time i will try broiled chicken breast cubes, just to avoid the extra oil and batter. Not for the faint of heart, definitely. Goes great with Dr. Pepper ;)

This is a very good recipe.  To the sauce, I added the zest of one mandarin orange (all the fresh citrus I had on hand), veg oil instead of peanut (again, what i had on hand), 1/4 tsp five spice powder, brown sugar instead of white, 1 medium sized slice of crystalized ginger in place of the powdered variety.  Added about a tsp of red pepper flakes instead of whole peppers at the last minute, as I was serving this to small children and had to divide the sauce. I almost want to say the veg/peanut oil was unnecessary, as any excess grease from the deep frying would add to the final product, but this is just an observation.  The sauce was quite thin, so after I added the pepper flakes, I made a slurry of cornstarch to a few tablespoons of cold water and added that to the boiling sauce, allowed it to bubble for a few minutes then added the chicken.  As far as the chicken, I used chicken breasts that I had soaked overnight in buttermilk (chicken fingers was the initial idea before i changed my mind). The first frying did not produce much of a crust, so I sprinkled some rice flour over it before re-frying for about 3 minutes.  This didn't produce the crispy crunch either, but did give it a sort of extremely tender crunch.  Gotta work on this crust issue.  With my changes, I think this recipe is almost ready for a good Chinese restaurant, but can be produced at less than a fraction of the price.

This is an awesome dish!  I cooked my chicken in a frying pan, but a fry daddy would make it easier!  I also prepared everything before hand as some other reviews suggested.  I put the measured ingredients into little bowls so it was easy to add them when it came time to do so.  This is not hard to prepare, there just are several ingredients and steps.  The first time for anyone will probably be the most awkward, but it's totally worth it.  I will definitely make this for my family!!! Also, this is definitely comparable to what you would get in a restaurant!  GREAT RECIPE!!!

I used only the sauce part of the recipe.  That said, it was really good.  I had to use lemon zest in place of orange (that's all I had), but it was still great.
I added a little bit of cornstarch/water to make the sauce go further and to dilute the strength.  I prefer it that way.

This recipe is VERY time consuming, however try "frying" using this method for "sweet/sour chicken" recipe-(Combine 2 &1/4 cup flour, 2tbsp oil, 2tbsp cornstarch, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp white pepper, & 1 egg mix well. Add 1 & 1/2 cups water gradually to make a thick batter. Stir to blend thoroughly. Add chicken & stir until chicken is well coated.Heat oil in skillet/wok to 360 degrees F. Fry chicken in hot oil 10 minutes, or until golden. Remove chicken, and drain on paper towels. No double frying. Note: if you use org. recipe the chicken will stick to itself when put in the batter so toss quickly or coat chicken in a ziploc bag with cornstarch a few at a time. then place in single layer on baking sheet til ready to fry. I did TRY to use org. recipe (doubled the sauce) but I did not have peanut "oil" & used 2tbsp of peanut butter & that was a mistake. Even after cooking for 4 mins on med-high the peanut butter taste was very over powering. this was not hot at all, therefore next time I will add 1 tbsp of sriracha chili sauce for flare and I will definitely use the other batter for frying. Plus I will make sure to have peanut "oil". we used exactly 52 pieces for 5 grown ups (3 of them having seconds) and that was perfect with none left over. Helpful hint: measure everything out earlier in the day and put in small bowls. It took 20 min to chop,mince,and measure everything out and 30 minutes to fry & re-fry using org. recipe. Definitely leave plenty of time for this dish.

I followed the recipe pretty much but took some advice from other reviews.  Used peanut butter in place of oil, used chili paste instead of red chilis. Definitely double sauce.  This was so good I won't buy it out again.

This recipe is spot on.  The only adjustment I made was using half sugar and half xylitol.  I did this because I made a double batch to pour over chicken wings and didn't want to use that expensive sugar substitute if this was going to be a dud recipe.  I am a picky eater and taste is subjective but, this taste like the General Tsao chicken sauce from my favorite Chinese restaurant.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe got only 4 stars because I tweeked it a lot (no green onions, no rice vinegar, no peanut oil, no orange zest) didn't have on hand. The green onion is needed I feel, but I substituted the rice wine vinegar with: a mixture of Chinese rice wine, a touch of mirin and a touch of white vinegar.  I substituted the orange zest for: orange marmalade. Used more water/cornstarch mixture to thicken the sauce. I will use FRESH ginger next time though (minced). This was so YUMMY..I will be doing this one again!

I had some leftover homemade chicken tenders (boneless chicken breasts cut into strips, breaded & deep fried until crispy), so I bypassed the beginning part of the recipe & just cut up the chicken tenders to use with the rest of the recipe going along as written.  This was AWESOME!  I eat this regularly when I go out for Chinese & this was just as good, only cheaper.  Just the right amount of spice!  Added some fresh broccoli and it was fantastic.  Thank you ChefDaddy.  This one's a keeper!

Absolutely delicious!  I paired this with homemade fried rice and it was perfect!!  My three sons are very picky eaters and all three had seconds.  I had no leftovers which is a rare at our house.

This was awesome. My first attempt at Chinese cooking, and I'm super happy with how it came out. I did double the sauce, as other reviewers recommended. I found it to be a good amount of sauce, however because the sauce is so tangy and sweet, a little goes a long way. I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cause it's how I roll. This was great and addictive- three of us ate the entire pan! Yikes! Also- I didn't find it to be hot at all, but perhaps I used the wrong peppers (they were large dried red chiles, not the small ones used in a lot of Chinese cooking). Thanks for the recipe!

I sauted the chicken instead of deep frying.  Used chinese red chile paste instead of red chilis and added steamed broccolli.  Wonderful flavor and very hot.

Messed it up pretty good and it still came out great. Will be trying again and will make sure to measure out everything and have it ready when needed because this recipe goes fast.

This was the recipe I've been looking for. I may have found something similar before but didn't want to buy all the ingredients that I didn't already have. This time I had most of the ingredients. Had I known it was the flavor I'd been looking for, I would have gone out to buy all them the first time.  It tastes just like it does in the restaurant!

I had never made this dish before. I liked this recipe, it was easy to follow. Some trouble getting the oil for frying to the right temp. It is important to get the oil hot enough. I used a Dutch oven and don't have a thermometer; medium-high heat worked best. The sauce could have used more tanginess; I'd add an extra tbsp of vinegar next time, and maybe a bit of orange juice. Use an extra 1/4 cup of chicken stock if you like extra sauce. The spice was perfect for me, but my husband the spice-a-holic added some Sriracha. I would make this recipe again for sure.

THIS IS IT!! No better recipe for General Tsao's on the Internet, in the Chinese Restaurant, anywhere! I can't believe how good this was. I steamed broccoli florets and carrots an tossed in the sauce. It is soooo good- Thanks!

Today was my first day trying this recipe. I have to admit it was DELICIOUS!!! My son and hubby thought it was better than the restaurant. I did tweak it a little instead of buying the Peanut Oil I used Peanut Butter. I will share this recipe with everyone I know...

We love this recipe. I don't double fry in oil. I just pan fry with garlic without the coasting. Makes a delicious less fattening version. I also double the sauce to allow extra for rice or noodles.

Great recipe! I doubled the sauce and sautéed onions, broccoli, carrots and red peppers in sesame oil.  I tossed veggies, chicken and the sauce in a large bowl altogether.  It made for a yummy beautiful entrée!  I will definitely make this again! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

I took a chance making this for dinner tonight.  My husband is a very picky eater who does not like to deviate from the same old "familiar"  foods.  I did not fry the chicken as I thought it was too much work if my husband wasn't going to Ike it!   I thought it was delicious and my husband had seconds!!   He is still talking about what a good dinner it was!  We will be enjoying this for dinner on a regular basis! Thanks for sharing!

We all loved this, and saved quite a bit of money over buying chinese takeout! I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of increasing sauce ingredients by half. I had to use chicken breasts, but I think thighs, or a mixture of white and dark meat, would be a little more flavorful. I could not readily find the chilies, so I used red pepper flakes, and the recipe bears a generous amount of those. This is pretty sweet even with reducing the sugar a tad. I believe I will reduce it more next time I make it. Not exactly like from the restaurant, but VERY good!

My husband and I wanted to try Chinese at home and decided to make this favourite.  It did not disappoint and rivals the best we have tasted from Toronto's Chinatown restaurants.  We added a little extra orange zest for an extra citrus punch and substituted chicken breast for thighs.  As well, we could not find dry whole chilli peppers so instead used dried chilli flakes.  It was amazing.  Crispy, sweet and sticky.  We would recommend making a little extra sauce for rice.  Also, adding green and red pepper slices and sesame seeds is a nice touch that many restaurants include.  Enjoy!

This is very tasty. I used brown sugar, because that's what I had, and I completely forgot to put in the zest, even though I prepped it. I also left off the breading and just browned the chicken in a pan before adding the sauce. Because other reviewers suggested using more sauce, I used 1.5 the amount of sauce. It was too much. I suggesting sticking with the original amount. I've already made this twice in just a few days. Yummy.

Fabulous!  The double frying of the chicken was a bit time consuming even when using our fryer, but very worth the effort. The double frying gives the coating that slight crispiness found in restaurant entrées.  We doubled the sauce as recommended in other reviews, which worked out perfectly! However, we were expecting it to be a bit more zippy side, but perhaps our dried red chilies were not-so-fresh from the store or something. At any rate, it ALL disappeared leaving everyone wanting more! A definite keeper!!

I had to make a substitution due to ingredients on hand. I didn't have vegetable oil, so I used about a half cup of peanut oil in the wok to fry the chicken...which I only fried once (missed that second frying step!). The chicken turned out beautifully - crisp but not overdone. The teaspoon of salt added with the sugar is unnecessary - the soy sauce is salty enough. Other than the peanut oil substitution, I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good. In my opinion, omitting the teaspoon of salt would elevate it to five-stars.

AWESOME!!!! I have been eating General Tao's since i can remember, I have had many versions some good and some bad all at Chinese restaurants. This recipe is got to be the best I had so far as I can remember. My local chinese favorite just lost my business (unless I need a plan B)I did not change a thing other than doubling up on the sauce as I had a bit more chicken and other than de-boning the thighs which is no big deal to do and making the chunks a little bigger 1" or so did not change a thing. I will add that DO NOT skip the double fry if you want the crispy coating that this dish is known for. Its what the restaurants do so they can tell you 20 minutes. I have used this method also for fresh french fried potatoes and other foods that can get mushy when fried. This is a definite winner in my book and a bi-weekly addition to our menu. Serve over sticky rice, the kind you get in the Chinese places. Mahatma is one kind just avoid the extra long enriched to me the texture is like little pellets. The soft rices hold more of the sauce. I you like General Tao chicken you have to try this recipe and make extras cause its just as good for the once a week leftovers buffet. Happy cooking GG

Excellent recipe.  You might be inclined to want to take short cuts with cooking the chicken, but following the recipe results in crispy chicken that keeps its crispiness even for leftovers the next day.  Worth the extra step of frying twice.  I did try it by replacing the sugar with equal amount of orange marmalade and loved that too (although perhaps that makes it orange chicken?)  At any rate, everyone loves it and says it tastes even better than the chinese restaurant.  ok, perhaps they are just being kind, but this recipe is good enough that I've made it quite a few times with hardly any changes.

Holy cow, this was awesome!  Absolutely horrible for you, but AWESOME.  I'm pretty picky about my General Tsao's chicken but this was just as good, if not better than any I've had from a restaurant.  The only things I did differently -- I used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs.  I also didn't have any orange zest so I just left that out and it was still so good!  My husband had 3 helpings.  Huge pain to fry that chicken but it was so worth it!

Overall a very good recipe. Certainly the best version of General Tsao's chicken I have ever made. the next time, I will cut back on the sugar by a quarter. Also, the sauce was slightly gritty. I may use less corn starch to thicken next time.

The sauce is terrific.  Can't give it 5 stars because I used Joe's General Tso's Chicken recipe from this site to make the chicken part.  I twice fried it like this recipe though.  I usually don't like to rate a recipe when I've changed it, but I just wanted others to know that both recipes are great.  I just think this sauce is better.  Thanks to both chefs for sharing their recipes.  I also think a little hoisin sauce would be a nice addition to this sauce, but I just made it as is for now.  Thanks again!!

This is an AWESOME recipe! My dad is really picky about his Chinese food and he agreed that it tasted even better than the restaraunt version! We used slightly less garlic and about two Tablespoons of "red pepper flakes" (cayenne pepper) in place of the whole dryed red chilis as we couldn't find a place that sold them. All in all, I will TOTALLY be making this again!

This was excellent but I had to cut the pepper for my families tastes way back, other than that it had excellent flavor. I also used chunky peanut butter as I didn't have peanut oil and it worked great with a little extra crunch factor. I will make this again thank you for the recipe

First off I'm Gen Tso's nut. It's what I judge Chinese restaurants by. That being said while the chicken prep/fry turned out perfect nuggets, the sauce was only so-so.  I followed the recipe exactly using real ingredients (not powdered, etc) but found it lacking the zip I love.  I will use the chicken fry technique again but not the sauce.

I agree with the other reviewer, this was a lot of work, but so worth it.  We thought it did taste just like a Chinese restaurant.  I will definitely make the sauce again, but next time I might simplify the chicken part.  Very delicious!

it very good, best so far. i been looking a nice sudden recipe. for the past few time i make it was too salty. this one is very good, even though it not as good as the restaurant, but it have a nice tint of orange favor that restaurant dont have so it quite nice. i didn't put any peanut oil, bc my niece is allergic to it, and i add a more chicken broth then in the recipe, but i like to pour it over my rice. but overall it quite good.

This is a real show off meal.  No one believes you did it all by yourself.  It's so good, so sticky, kand yummy, you won't believe you did it either.  Follow the recipe, watch the video, it's easier than it sounds.  Definitely fry twice.  Don't skip theat step!    I love using a big batch of wings, thighs, breasts, whatever chicken we have in hand.  No fail recipe, thanks ChefDaddy!

This was quite good but a little salty for my taste.  However, that is an easy fix so I will still give this recipe 5 stars.

Love this recipe. Definately should have doubled the sauce, but it was absolutely perfect. Great batter and deep fry on the chicken. Makes a perfect popcorn chicken. Yummy stuff. Will definately use this again and again. Thanks

This is delicious and is the closest to the restaurant General Tso's chicken I've ever had.  I accidently used all of my cornstarch in the beginning of the recipe and had nothing to thicken the sauce.  In a pinch I made a roux of 2 TB butter and 2 TB flour, then added the sauce to this.  Unlike other reviewers who had thin sauce, mine was thick and gooey.  My accident was successful!

This turned out to be such a delight! I got the chance to work with flavors I hadn’t used before and was delighted to notice that I could taste the more subtle flavors like the sesame oil and orange zest. I doubled the sauce when making this recipe because I like extra for my rice. A plus of this recipe is that it is truly versatile; add extra orange zest to make orange chicken or add extra ginger if you want a more gingery tasting meal. I made this recipe to the ‘t’ the first time and the other times I have made it I don’t use the cornstarch. I prefer my chicken that way. And one big BIG tip, if you measure your ingredients, get everything measured out before you cook this! Otherwise, your kitchen will turn into a chaotic mess and you may burn something…

Great recipe. Tried it with white meat once, not near as good as using dark thigh meat. Double frying is a must. A bit more sugar helps the sauce taste and doubling the hot peppers really gives it a kick. We found that the recipe quantities above are good for 2 thighs cut up. Double for 4 thighs.

Hint: use thigh skin and bones to make a small amount of stock for the broth ingredient. Saves you from having to open a whole can.

Great sauce!!  Recipe is fantastic as is... But much like other members I now modify it.  One thing I do is use the sauce with Udon noodles and vegetables as a stir fry.  Very tasty!

Absolutely excellent. At the suggestion of others, I did not deep fry the chicken (used breasts as that is all I had), just fried it in less oil and I doubled the sauce.  Otherwise made exactly as written. Restaurant quality or better!

Ok, this meal was a comedy of events.  Our family loves General Tso chicken from the local restaurant.  However we are in the process of adopting from China and are saving all our pennies.  So, I went looking for a good recipe to make it at home.  This recipe seemed to get the best reviews.  I printed it and added the ingredients to the grocery list.  The night I was going to make it, my dh comes home and says he doesn't mind making it, so I move out of the way.  I start doing "prep" work like cutting up broccoli, onions, and gathering ingredients.  My dh starts putting together the chicken ingredients to fry.  First I tell him to use the cornstarch, he gets out the cornmeal. Thankfully I notice this and correct him.  He starts frying and I say, "did you add the sugar?" "What? No".  So he goes back to the recipe and finds the quantity of sugar, adds it and starts frying.  Immediately the chicken is burning black.  (me) "How much sugar did you use?",(him)"It says 1/2 cup."(me)"No, it says 1 t" (he really does know how to cook).  We doubled the sauce and overcooked the broccoli.  Even though it was a little sweet it was good.  We can't wait to make it "RIGHT" the next time.  Thanks for a great recipe even when it was so messed up by us!

NEW INFORMATION:  We tried it as written and didn't like it.  Next time, we are going ahead and purposefully repeating the mistakes of the first time we made it (except the overcooked broccoli).  We liked it much better the first time.

Followed the 2nd half of the recipe for the sauce, except I added cayenne & chipotle peppers to make it spicier.  My husband found it too sweet, but I liked it.  I don't like the chicken to be fried, so I just cooked it on the stove in diced pieces and added it to the sauce.  Since my husband didn't like it, I won't be making it again since General Tso's is his dish (and he's a little picky when it comes to this).

The sauce for this is homemade spot on!  I doubled it!!!  I  also cooked chicken breast in alittle olive oil instead.  then when done put in a little water and a  frozen bag of vegtable medley of green, yellow beans and baby carrots and a can of water chestnuts steamed them added all to the sauce, served over white minute rice. Was delicious and spicey hot!!!Modified keeper way better for you than takeout Thanks chef Daddy

Oh my gosh...delicious.  Better and fresher than any Chinese restaraunt.  I did not have the peanut oil and it worked out just fine by using canola oil.  Try it you will you be happy you did.

Exceptional following the recipe just as it is.  To make it healthier next time I'll just dice some chicken breasts and cook it in a little olive oil in a pan instead of deep frying.  The sauce is excellent!!!

Fantastic Sauce! Like a lot of others have said, double the sauce. I used chicken breasts lightly dredged in flour with a bit of white pepper and then pan fried it in a bit of peanut oil. Worked well and used a lot less oil. I also cut back a tad on the oil for the sauce the second time I made it, and it turned out well. Thanks, this will be a regular in our house!

Wow this is even better than what you would order from a restaurant. It is very time consuming but well worth it. Will be making again.

After reading the top rated review, I decided to go ahead and try this without the breading (my son is allergic to wheat and corn). I subbed arrowroot powder for the cornstarch to thicken the sauce.    I am so glad that I did try this, it was such a great meal.  I think I would eat this every week!  Even my 2 year old ate every bite.  I did sub tangerine zest for the orange zest because it was what I had on hand.  I used 4 super long dried chiles, but it could have been spicier, I'll go ahead and use all 6 next time and maybe even add a dash of hot sauce. Thanks for the great recipe!

I didn't have rice vinegar so I used white wine vinegar in its place and I also substituted a glop of creamy peanut butter in place of the peanut oil. It was very good and my husband loved it and the General is what he always orders in restaurants, so this is a good recipe and I will make it again. Oh, and I only deep-fried my chicken once and added it back at the end to coat and heat through.

didn't do the orange cuz I'm not a fan out citrus chicken, didn't do the peanut oil as I had none and used all sesame oil instead. I went nuts with the chiles because I like spice but found out that a little go a LONG way and a LOT go even FURTHER. But that was my fault and no fault of this recipe. I've been searching so long for a tasty tso recipe that didn't turn into jello and I've finally found it. It was flat out amazing. Thank you!

OMG this was sooo good. I love chinese food...my husband not so much. But this he loved, and my son loved too! I served with some steamed brocoli and brown rice and it was delish!

I did NOT fry twice, and as long as you fry the first time long enough and hot enough it is soooo tasty. I found that the smaller the pieced of the chicken the better it turned out!

This didn't taste like the General Tsao's that we like. The chicken turned out perfectly, we just didn't really like the sauce.

I use this recipe all the time when I want a sweet brown "asian" sauce.   Works well with just veggies and even tofu.  (In other words, you don't have to do the fried chicken part if you don't want to.)

i made alot of substitutions in this recipe. i used all vegetable oil, and added 1/2tsp of creamy peanut butter as one reviewer suggested. i also sub'd 2 parts vinegar/1 part water for the rice vinegar. i also sub'd red pepper for the dried chiles as a reviewer suggested but IT WAS WAAAAY TOO MUCH!! she said she put 2 tablespoons. either  she has no feeling in her face, or she meant 2 teaspoons! great flavor, and fairly easy to make, just unbelievably hot. next time i will try 1/2 T.

A real keeper says my supreme comander and chief. Happy to go there again anytime she says. Easy and enjoyable to make and eat. A go-to recipe for a cool evening dinner. Not the most conventional "comfort food" dinner until you have it a couple times. Really good and somehow even if modified, the essence of the recipe remains. Can substitute any meat still great.

I found this recipe on here awhile ago and just printed it out.  I've made it about a dozen times.  My family absolutely loves it!!!!  They crave it over take out.  It's just that good.  Period.  If you love General Tsao's chicken you must try this recipe!!!!

This is a terrific recipe! Prior to this I tried the "Asian Orange Chicken" recipe on the site, and it was a complete failure. While the recipe tastes great in its original form, it can be altered to include a wide array of recipes. For example, after double frying the chicken, you can add different pre-made sauces available at a local supermarket (orange sauce, sweet/sour, mandarin, etc), or just substitute it for the sauce in this recipe (keep the cornstarch and broth). It turns out terrific! You'll thank me later.

I made this exactly as recipe says.  This took forever, but was delicious.  The only thing I would do differently next time is double the sauce recipe so there's enough to put on rice as well.

my super picky five year old loved this. I made a couple adjustments. I didn't have chicken broth, peanut oil, or red chilies on hand so I subbed crushed red peppers for the chilies, a little extra sesame oil for the peanut oil. Additionally I added a dash of fish sauce, a squeeze of orange juice, and halved the sugar.

I don't usually make chinese food, and this recipe was very easy to follow. I changed the recipe a bit for my own liking. I used about 1 1/2 cup of oil (or less) for frying. Instead of ground ginger I added fresh. I used about 4 tbs of palm suger in the sauce and opted out the peanut oil. I didn't have an orange, so i added a bit of orange juice to the sauce. Added some yellow peppers and red peppers for some colour! Next time i'll make a double batch of sauce just because it's so gooood!

My husband & I are a fan of the General Tso's Chicken that you can get from restaurants, but I wanted to to see if I can make the same version of it at home.  This recipe was perfect and make it often for dinner.

WOW!!!  This is just as if not better than any other General Tsaos chicken I have ever had! Ok well I need to say at least the sauce is..it is amazing! Only change I made was didn't use dried chilis but used red pepper flakes instead.  My ONLY gripe is that the chicken was to crunchy..next time I will find a different method for preparing the chicken but this sauce I will use over and over and over again!!!

Wow!  This sauce is really, really good.  I did not have red chilis, so I used 1 tsp of red pepper flakes which produced moderate heat, could use more if you like.  I also did not have peanut oil, so I used same quantity of crunchy peanut butter, the nuts ended up being a nice touch.  This is a great sauce that I will use again for sure.

My husband loved this....so did I.  It is a little more involved but it's worth the time and effort.  I didn't change a thing and my husband couldn't stop talking about this recipe being the BEST General Tsao's chicken he's ever had.  Then he proceeded to tell me I needed to find a recipe for peanut chicken.  lol  We made it with Basmati rice.  Perfect

My husband had a craving for Chinese food, and this definitely satisfied it :) I couldn't find sesame oil or red chiles, though, so I subbed extra peanut oil and crushed red pepper.

This was excellent! The chicken was perfectly crispy. I too didn't have any peanut oil, and other than using too much peanut butter, it was great. I recovered by adding more chili sauce to compensate and yum! Thanks!

Excellent!  I have never been able to try this dish in a restaurant as I'm vegetarian, so we made it with mock duck (available canned in Asian markets and the Asian section of many grocery stores) instead of chicken.  Same process, great results (Boyfriend is not vegetarian, and he enjoyed it as much as I did!).  Doubled the sauce as suggested, and it was just the right amount.  Served over rice with a side of steamed veggies.

for my family, this is the closest I've come to what we love. It's not easy to make, let me start there. I think I worked harder on this than I do on Thanksgiving. lol 

First of all, the actual chicken came out PERFECT.  It was exactly the way  it needed to be. I think I had to cook it a little longer than the recipe called for, but if you just watch as it browns, you'll be ok. It wasn't over done or tough.

The sauce needs a little tweaking, at least for us. It was heavy in the soy sauce which made it a little strong. I was worried until I got to the point where I added the sugar. At that point, it smelled EXACTLY the way it should. Unfortunately, either I got my measurements messed up (because I doubled the recipe on all counts) or it just had too much for us. I recommend starting with half and adding until it seems right. 

All in all, I was very happy with this. Just, like I said, need to adjust the soy sauce a little bit.

I made this by taking the advice of a reviewer who decided to sauté the chicken in place of frying. So, I sautéed the chicken in canola oil then made the sauce as the recipe dictates. I used 1/4 cup of sugar and maybe will even reduce it more next time. Easy recipe if not frying and super delicious. Better than take out from your average restaurant.

The chicken was really delicious fried up this way even though it was a bit of work. ( I don’t have a fryer, so I had to do a lot of small batches in a large pot. And frying is always some what messy, but you know that already!) I should have doubled the sauce as many reviewers suggested, as I didn’t have enough for all the chicken. But my husband was happy to eat the left over chicken with some bottled hot sauce. The only thing I changed was to cut back on the sugar since we don’t care for overly sweet. I would have preferred the sauce to be hotter so I wish I had used more chilis and let them cook longer. I was glad I followed several reviewers suggestion to have all ingredients out and ready. It’s a great recipe but not one I will make often.

Excellent flavor!  It was as good or better than most restaurant dishes I've had in the past.  I used Thai chili paste instead of dried chilies (its what I had on hand).  A couple things I'll do differently next time (and there will be a next time...):  first, I cubed the chicken too small, I'd prefer larger (1") cubes.  The smaller pieces got overly crispy.  Second, as some other reviewers have suggested, I'll double the sauce.

When the sauce hit the pan, it absorbed very fast. I had to stop and make more sauce and place the flame on low in order for the sauce to stay. The chicken got sticky and dry.

I might try it again, but I will make allot of sauce and turn the flame down low.

Amazing!!!  This recipe is a keeper!!  Please double the sauce it’s so good you will want extra, it smells amazing and it’s delicious. I bought fresh peppers instead of dried peppers and it worked perfectly.  My husband said there is no need for us to do order chinese out again.  Just need to master an egg roll.

This is a fantastic recipe! We cut the sugar down a bit due to personal taste so you may add half the sugar it calls for and try it if you don't like things too sweet.  Our whole family gives this a five star rating.

Delicious!  I have been on the hunt for years on finding the best general tso chicken recipe and they all had been fails, except this one!  This is the best one I have tried for an at home recipe.  My husband really liked it as well.  Next time I will double the green onion and garlic, and will omit the extra peanut oil in the recipe, because it really didn't need anymore oil.  I may also add in a touch of honey next time to the sauce.  The double fry to the chicken cubes is crucial to get a moist chicken on the inside, with a double crispy coating.  I used chicken breasts, but chicken thighs would be great also.  Great recipe and we will for sure have to make again!  Thank You!

I made this for my parents who are long time lovers of General Tso chicken and they loved it!! I followed the recipe to a T and I have come to two conclusions. We would prefer it with chicken breasts instead of thighs and we will use only half the sugar that it called for. It was slightly gummy and got stuck in our back teeth. Other than that the flavor is really nice and had quite a kick to it. New family favorite!!!

Definitely use the JUICE OF THE ORANGE as well!!! Very tasty base sauce recipe that can be adjusted easily to your taste. Not exactly the flavor i'm accustomed to for a General's, but it was still worth keeping in the recipe file.

My wife and I made this this evening, it was great. We made two batches of chicken. 2lbs. One lbs like it says in corn starch. I thought that was much so I used flour instead the second. MUCH better! Sub the starch with flour and lightly add a small amount of sesame oil instead a vegi. Cook less chicken at one time. Also I would cut the starchand water by half at the end so it's a syrup"like sauce instead of gummy.

I am torn between 4 and 5 stars.  I have been trying to find a good General Tso recipe because there isn't a decent Chinese restaurant where I moved to. I followed the recipe as is (almost).  I used 1 Tbsp pineapple juice instead of orange zest because I have seen pinapple juice in other Tso recipies and I don't like orange chicken at all so I didn't want any orange taste in mine.  I use a ground red chili paste from an Asian market rather than using red chili fresh all the time (I believe it probably turns out about the same as this paste is literally just ground red chili peppers). Rice wine is hard to find and so most recipies used the rice vinegar instead but since I have rice wine, I use it. .  Yes, I have peanut oil and sesame oil, can't make good Chinese without them.  Learning to make good Chinese is a commitment getting special ingredients but there is no sub for peanut oil,  sesame oil, rice wine and a good chili paste.   I give it 4 starts because I finally found a recipe I didn't want to throw in the garbage, however I thought it was too sweet and will "tweek" this a bit using less sugar and maybe less oil.  All in All very good tho. Thanks.

This was totally delicious.

My alternation:
- just pan friend chicken thigh fillets covered with flour and then added to the sauce.   
- I added cooked beans into it   
- I didn't have peanut oil and used crunchy peanut butter instead. It was yum. The peanut bits were a great addition.   
- By now (second time round) I have actually used honey instead of sugar. It is recommended on the net that you use a 1/4 of the sugar amount given.   
- I used 1 fresh red chilli which was plenty of 'heat'.

Reducing by 1 star:
Because there is SO much sugar in this. Next time I shall replace the sugar with honey to make it healthier.

It tasted like from the Chinese restaurant. My folks loved it.

Ommitted the peanut oil because I didnt have any to hand and used dried chilli flakes. But the taste was amazing. I served with fried rice. This is on the rotation now. My wife loved it.

My husband and I have made this several times.  Breading and cooking the chicken pieces takes a lot of time.  The most recent batch we didn't bother breading the chicken at all, just cut up some chicken and put it directly into the wok with peanut oil, and it was still crazy tasty - just faster. I used low sodium soy sauce and instead of orange zest / sugar, I used orange marmalade, and I doubled the red peppers.  I am looking forward to making other small changes to add variety - some peanuts or maybe peanut butter, or more orange, etc.

Amazing dish! I omit the spicy peppers and added a bit extra orange zest and some orange peel. Also added a bit of orange juice to the mix. As you can probably tell...I ended up with orange chicken instead! It was a hit with the kids! I also saw reviews about frying twice. I strongly recommend it! I fried 3 batches 2 times and the other just once to see the difference. The 3 double fried batches remained nice and crunchy even when people went back for seconds. The others were not so crispy and more like buffet chicken...

Better than Chinese take-out!  I took a scoop of the mixture out before adding the cornstarch to thicken it up.  Used it to marinate boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Then I thickened up the rest of the mixture to use over rice.  Sooo  good.  Grilled the chicken and it was unbelievably moist and tasty from being marinated ... Not to mention the sauce on the rice was to die for!  Totally eliminated the eggs and the 4 cups oil for frying the chicken.  Definitely a keeper.

Only removed the chillies. Couldn't find them and thought it best without so the kids could eat it. I did add some chilli flakes. Delicious!

Made this tonight I followed the recipe to a T, it's the best I've had it beats a restaurants hands down.  Only have 1 issue my wife and kids are not into real spicy.  So next time I will cut down on the dried Chilies for them.

This was really good.   Not sure why the "double fry".   Seemed to make the crust too stiff for my liking, so I'll not bother doing that next time.   I also used leftover rotisserie chicken meat and it worked great!   Loved the sauce.

Excellent! I"m always looking for new ideas and because we can't always splurge on "take out" - This ending up just like I ordered Chinese food =)  I have 7 picky eaters to feed and they all said this was better than the local take-out =D  I served it with the traditional white rice and brocolli and it was GONE - No left overs!  Thank you

This was delicious!!! My daughter has a peanut and sesame allergy, so I substituted both of those ingredients with extra virgin olive oil.  Also, I didn't have chillies on hand, so I used 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes. We like less spicy, so this was not a problem for us. Everything else I followed as written. My family was thrilled with the outcome. Will definitely make this again.

I will never order from a Chinese restaurant again! This is delicious, the flavors are complex, and it doesn't have things like MSG that you find in fast food restaurants. I like to toss the chicken in flour, salt, and pepper and just saute rather than double fry. I also prep for the sauce by putting ingredients from step 4 into 2 bowls so I can just dump them in without having to measure individually since it cooks so fast. Make this! You won't regret it.

This was really really good. I like extra sauce so I doubled the sauce ingredients with the exception of the red peppers. I used 9 Chile de arbol dry red pepper instead of 12 and removed the seeds because I was worried it would be to hot for my 3yr old & 7yr old. It was great. It had a small amount of spicy to it but nothing that bothered my picky eaters. They actually enjoyed it. If you like spice I would recommend using at least the number of peppers this recipe calls for and if your doubling the sauce too also double the peppers. I'm still not sure if your suppose to remove the seeds though.

This was quite a bit of work.  I liked it, but I may not follow this recipe next time.  I doubled the sauce except used less sugar (2/3c instead of the doubled amount 1c) & added 1/8t crushed red pepper since the kids were having some.  It wasn't spicy at all, but more was easily added on the plate.  I only panfried the chicken once.  Then, added the sauce, boiled, thickened with cornstarch mixed with chicken broth.  I felt there was too much salt (soy sauce) & sugar.  I'm not saltsensitive, or sugarsensitive for that matter; but those flavors took over the recipe.  One of the reviews mentioned "greasy" & "goopy".  Yup, it was after it cooled; but what do ya want?!  That's how it goes with dishes with oils & cornstarch.  Jus' how it goes.  :)

This recipe works well with tofu. If you take a block of extra firm tofu, cube it into bite size pieces. Place in a dish and cover with boiling salted water for 15 min. Drain and pat dry. From there follow directions as written. The glaze gets all loved up & clingy without turning to mush. I tried this for myself and my carnivorous children always eat it. Awesome

I actually became a member to the site just to rate this because I have tried so many general tso chicken recipes and this is the best. I have to double the sauce at least if we want it for the rice but other than that, I stick to the recipe exactly and the flavor is exactly what I am looking for. The specific batter and double fry for the chicken gave the perfect chicken morsels for the recipe that could be used as delicious chicken nuggets all by themselves.

PERFECT! Although I messed up on the frying part, the sauce was excellent!! Now I know how the restaurant gets such thickly breaded pieces of chicken - it's the corn starch :-) I will definitely try to perfect this recipe.

First time cooking this recipe. Took longer then expected (about 2hrs) but it was worth it! Next time will be quicker now that I have an idea of the recipe. Didn't have the white pepper but it was still delicious. Will make again!

I made this recipe and only changed it by doubling the sauce and  adding orange zest when the sauce finished. I went to the restaurant known for this dish and felt terrible paying for something I was sure I could make better at home. Thanks to this recipe I was right. It says it serves six but there are four in my family and there are no leftovers. This 're pie is perfect. I feel that to keep the integrity of the recipe the chicken should definitely be double fried. You could get away with a single fry though. Just make the sauce while frying the chicken so both are done at the same time.

I tried this last night, followed recipe exactly with one change(Doesn't affect the taste of the sauce). I used Tempura instead of cornstarch for the breading on the chicken. This dish had a good overall chinese flavor but tasted nothing like General Tso's. The Tempura chicken was the best part. I will not make this again and continue my search for a authentic General Tso's recipe.

I would make this again, with a few modifications. Personally, we don't enjoy the peanut flavor so I would leave that out next time and perhaps add a few more chili peppers for a touch more heat. Other than that, great recipe! Very tasty sauce. Comes together well and so does the chicken. Tip: The chicken really sticks together so I found it easier to toss it in the cornstarch using my hands to get a more even coating. A keeper!

Outstanding flavor that is authentic in taste compared to quality Chinese restaurants.  I made it exactly as recommended and we have had it several times since discovering it on allRecipes.  My suggestions are mostly for presentation but do add a little flavor.  I top the chicken with toasted sesame seeds and chopped scallions serving them over a bed of rice with peas or broccoli mixed in.  As other reviewers have done, I also started doubling the sauce. This gives the dish a darker more rich-caramel appearance.  mmm-thanks!

I read some of the reviews before making this recipe and tweaked it as i went along, instead of white vinegar, i used Apple cider vinegar, it added to the flavor. I also added mushrooms cut in half at the last minute or two of cooking time. Will def. try it again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

It was really tasty. But I felt so bad using so much sugar, on top of deep frying the chicken.

If you love Chinese take out, this is a must try recipe!  It is seriously better than anything I have ever eaten at a Chinese restaurant.  I have followed the recipe to the letter and I have done it a bit differently and it never disappoints!  I love garlic so I add more, I also add more green onion, and I have used several different types of citrus to sub for orange.  Since I am making this for the whole family, little kids included, I don't use whole chilies but use red pepper flakes instead.  I took this to a friend's family and she raved and raved about it and later made it twice in one week because she loved it so much.  This is one of the few recipes that I can serve my whole family and no one complains -that is a winning recipe in my book!

So after reading the reviews I thought I had to try this and boy were you guys right.  This was absolutely scrumptious and very close to Chinese takeout.  Now, it was somewhat time consuming but the end result was worth the effort.  I, like some, did not have access to peanut oil so I used peanut butter instead and I was unable to get the peppers so I simply used diced red sweet peppers. I am not fond of heat so perhaps it was best anyway.  The double frying was really the trick and the sauce (even without the requisite ingredients) was on point. I did double the amount for the sauce which helped without doubling on the soy sauce as too much sodium for me.  Great recipe and will definitely do again! Thanks ChefDaddy!

AMAZING! I wasn't really sure why I was frying the chicken twice, but it came out absolutely delicious. My husband said it was better than any General's chicken available near us! I did take the advice of some reviewers and double the sauce, but next time I will triple the sauce for the amount of chicken I had. I usually cook more than necessary because my husband works long hours and usually takes two helpings of whatever I make for dinner with him for his lunches. I will absolutely be making this again! I served it with chow mein and steamed vegetables.

Such a great meal! I made some changes: skipped out on the sesame oil because I'm allergic and instead used more rice vinegar and then used 2 eggs rather than just 1. Still turned out super yummy and fantastic!

Have been enjoying General's chicken from a variety of restaurants for years and have always wanted to try my own.  I used this recipe for my first time and it came out great! Varied it a little by using breast meat (I prefer uniform sized pieces) and doubling the red chili peppers (I like it hot) and it was Delicious!  Will definitely be using this recipe again!

Now the family favorite!! I have even grown my own red chili peppers and strung them to dry just for this recipe...Change nothing, follow the directions exactly..However if you are short or missing an ingredient or two, no worries! It still turns out fabulous every time.VERY time consuming and worth every minute!

This is so good. I have also made it without drying the chicken. I added the chicken to sauce before the cornstarch. When the chicken is white on the outside I do the cornstarch step and continue cooking. So so so yummy!

Wow.. better than the local chinese restaurant !

I held back on some peppers the first time as i thought it would be too hot..... if you like spices at all, dont hesitate to use the hot peppers as directed - its not a hot dish.

I tried this recipe and it was the best Chinese I have ever made at home. It tasted just as yummy as any Chinese restaurant. It was a hit with my husband and kids. I used less chilies for less heat. I decided not to double fry next time, it's really not necessary. You can easily adjust the recipe with other ingredients. You can add honey, orange juice if you like it more citric. Peanut butter can replace the peanut oil if you have none. If you like a lot of sauce I suggest you double it. There are never any leftovers. Tonight I am going to try the recipe with sauteed chicken breasts in place of thighs and frying. I'm sure it will turn out just as delicious.

Loved this. Did not use nearly as much cornstarch. I just added until it looked coated. Wonderful flavor, would make again. Glad I tried it to say I could.

Love this recipe! I have made it several times and have given the recipe to a few people who also love it. I just make the sauce and buy the chicken from our local grocery store already prepared(fried popcorn chicken)and that saves a lot of time.  I am unable to find dried red peppers so we use fresh. This is one of my family's favorite meals. Thanks for sharing.

I'm giving this recipe five stars because it's damned good as set forth above.  And while this recipe is a great start, there are a few modifications I've made that really pull it together.  First, the cornstarch coating just doesn't taste 100% to me.  Don't get me wrong--it's still very good.  The first two times I made this I used the cornstarch and it was fine.  But Red Lotus Brand flour (my Thai mother-in-law says it's a wheat-based flour) as a substitute makes a big difference in overall taste.  Second, 1/2 inch is just too small for the chicken cubes.  After the double-fry, it ends up all dried out.  I cut 1-inch or larger chunks and this seems to fix it.  I do use boneless skinless breasts, which may have something to do with the drying out.  Third, I add more green onion and orange zest than the recipe calls for.  The flavor from the orange zest is one of the things that really makes this recipe "work." Finally, I like spicy, so I chop the dried chilies up.  Depending on your heat preference, you might not want to.  It definitely kicks up the heat a few notches.  I'm not sure I agree with the "exactly like a Chinese restaurant" comments--the homemade version is 100 times better.  I made a "triple batch" of this for several guests last night to rave reviews.  I never would have thought of making this at home if I hadn't found this recipe here.  Highly recommended.

This was really easy to make and taste great, except it's too sweet on the sauce so I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup instead of the 1/2 cup from the original recipe and turned out just right.

I made this and it was so marvelous that I took a sample to the owner/chef of the Chinese restaurant I have been ordering this out from for the past 7 years. The chef tasted it and is now using this recipe. That was a win-win! I can now have it when I want it and I don't have to clean my kitchen up. Thanks for posting this!

Great recipe!! I did make two changes, I used 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup and it was perfect, second I used vegetable oil instead of peanut oil only because I did not have it. If you would like sauce to put over your rice, I would advise doubling the sauce recipe. There was plenty of sauce for my husband and me, but if there were more people eating there would not have been enough.

My daughter sent me this recipe after she made it and we both agree that it is a keeper. I made a few modifications to suit my taste and under her advice that it was very, very sweet. I cut back the sugar to 1/3 cup, used 2 cloves of garlic, ginger paste, more chicken stock and used peanutbutter as I didn't have peanut oil. I ended up not using all the chicken in the sauce and my husband and I ate the entire dish. Next time, I will use only 1 lb. of chicken and a bit more orange zest. If I had 2 more for dinner, I use all 1 1/2lbs of chicken and double the sauce. Absolutely a delicious recipe. Thanks to my daughter for sharing and Chef Daddy for posting it!

Wonderful!! I followed the recipe pretty close, but had an orange scented rotisserie chicken leftover.cut it up in cubes and went from there. I also used 2 tsp of peanut butter and added a small head of chopped fresh broccoli to the pan before adding the chicken. Also, used red pepper flakes instead of the dried chili. and squeezed half a clementine over all in the pan. used a little less sugar.

AMAZING!!! It was a bit putzy, with the double frying, but I definatly will not skip that step. The chicken stayed cripsy, just like at my fav chinese resteraunt! I couldn't find the dried red chili's so I subbed red pepper flakes and it was perfect. You will not be disappointed with this recipe at all!

Alright so I don't normally rate recipes but just so other people in the future can judge this, I did not follow the recipe as written. I always take what other peoples suggestions were and go from there. I used orange juice in this and for my family it was too over powering. I did double the sauce for this. I also cut open the peppers like another reviewer said to do and our mouths are on FIRE, we like to have a kick in our food but this was crazy. I think next time I will try it as is, the chicken was awsome and I think if I still had taste buds the sauce would be too, just need to follow directions :)

I loved this recipe and did double the sauce.  To cut back on calories and fat (36.5 gms - YIKES), I reduced the sugar by half and only tossed the chicken in the cornstarch, salt & pepper then stir fried it rather than deep frying twice.  I will stir fry broccoli, mushrooms, sliced carrots, red peppers, etc. next time and add them in with the chicken at the end for a more balanced meal.  AWESOME!

We've made this twice now, both times slightly different depending which ingredients we had on hand.  This recipe is delicious.  The chicken battered with corn starch is very light compared to flour and tastes great.  The sauce is excellent and works very well covering your entire meal (stir fried veggies, rice, chicken, etc.)

First time making an Asian dish and it turned out amazing. I made some tweaks, I sautéed half an onion  (I had doubled the recipe) chopped, half a carton of sliced mushrooms and a red pepper. I then added this into my sauce after the garlic.  Also I tried to use as little oil as possible when cooking the chicken.  All in all I think this is a great recipe and will definitely be making it again. (Great for leftovers too!)

This was wonderful! This was at least as good as what we have gotten at restaurants. We didn't have a cup of cornstarch, so we just used flour to coat the chicken, but it turned out great. I was hesitant to fry the chicken twice, but it really made a difference on how crispy it came out. The sauce was a little too orange flavored, but they may have been my husband "helping" me. Definitely a keeper, and we will be making this again. It's a new favorite in our house.

This was very good. I didn't want to deep-fry, so I ignored directions 1 to 3, pan-cooked the cubed chicken, then continued with direction #4. I didn't have dried red peppers, so I substituted 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. Next time, I'll add a chopped green and/or red pepper for colour when cooking the chicken. Served with egg fried rice and egg rolls.

Great recipe, unfortunately my kids don't like spice like I do so I had to omit the chiles, I know, that's basically what makes it General Tsao's but it still tasted great.  The kids LOVED IT!  My oldest screamed CHINESE!!  The only thing I would change is to double the sauce, my family loves saucy dishes like this particularly so we can dress our rice with it.  The sauce I made seemed like it was just enough to coat the chicken.  Oh, I did add broccoli, another thing my family loves is broccoli cooked in soy based sauces, I used 1/2 pound but it was nowhere near enough, definitely a pound of broccoli next time.  I'm not one for rating a recipe unless I made it to the actual recipe listed but I didn't really change anything that altered the dish too much and it was still great anyway.

Simply the best! Tripled the recipe (except for the frying oil), and it turned out great. Used breast instead of thigh, and did not find chilis, so I used about 3 tsp of "sriracha hot chili sauce" [in asian section at market]. this provided a kick but did not make too spicy because kids were eating this. It was time consuming but well worth it!!!

Very easy, 5 stars from the most sceptical of my eaters.  I followed some reviewers suggestions for ease.  I would use more peanutbutter and I like it hotter. Definitely double the sauce.

Great recipe!  My husband is a General Tsao addict.  He said this was every bit as good as the stuff he gets in the restaurant.  I will definitely be making this often.

Very tasty dish as is.  Simple to make.  Next time I'll experiment and will try it with a little more spice.  Also, will split the sugar and add half white sugar and half brown sugar.  All in all I was quite pleased.  Now to clean up the kitchen!

I followed the recipe except I added a little more zest and chili paste instead of chilis. Next time I would add about 2 tsp of chili paste instead of one, not add so much oil to the sauce, and try using chicken breast instead. I also would try baking instead of frying. It was great the way that it was, but I wish it was healthier! I also doubled the sauce and found this was too much for me.

I only really used the sauce portion of this recipe.  I coated the raw chicken with flour and then fried it.  Made the sauce to pour over it and served it over rice.  The recipe was pretty sweet but it was absolutely delicious.  I will be making it again!

This was soooo good! My three-year-old, who has been asserting his independence through food, didn't even put up the tiniest fuss. In fact, I've never seen him eat so fast and then he asked for seconds! As another person suggested, I skipped the frying (didn't feel like dealing with the extra step) and just cooked the chicken in a pan. I don't think anyone missed the crispy coating of the meat, but I will try it next time. Also, I used 4 dried chiplote chilies. They didn't make the dish hot, which my kids would not have liked, but once cut, they added a lot of spice. I think this will be a regular family dinner.

Loved it.  Only changes: My son was preping the chicken and tossed in cornstarch without the egg mix, so we threw the egg mix on top and tossed it, became more like a tacky batter but fried up beautifully :)  Also, found it a bit salty so next time will use light soy.  Thanks ChefDaddy, a keeper!

Delicious!  I ended up not having peanut oil or red chilies (fine since I'm feeding kids) in the house, only half the soy sauce, black pepper rather than white, OJ instead of orange zest (compensated for missing soy liquid) and by mistake I used curry instead of ginger and it still was AMAZING!  More depth of flavor than most restaurant versions.  Doubled the sauce and used 2.5lbs of chicken and it was just enough to serve two adults and 3 young kid since everyone wanted seconds.  This is good enough to serve to company!

This is the absolute BEST general tsao's chicken I have ever tasted! It stayed crispy for 2 days after we made it, even after reheating in the microwave. It is time consuming but well worth the work!!! I would give this 10 stars if I could.

I've tried many Chinese recipes from this site and they usually need lots of tweaking to taste authentic. This is the exception! This recipe was excellent as written. The only change I made was to add some red pepper flakes to the sauce to make it even spicier.

Oh wow, Yes, the frying/double frying makes a mess, but It is so worth it.

There's just one place in town that does really good General Tao chicken, and this is really close to the taste from that restaurant.

Will make again, and double the sauce. The sauce is simply amazing!

This was the best homemade Gen Tsao's we ever had! I did use a store bought bag of frozen chicken that was the fried nugget kind. I hate deep frying in the house. We baked the chicken untill it was good and crispy. Followed the rest of the recipe and it was GONE! Kids loved it!

Oh my word.  It's fried chicken that's gluten free.  AND good.  My little GF 5 year old hasn't had fried chicken in so long, and I haven't had Chinese food in years because I couldn't be sure what was in it.  A definite keeper!

absolutely the best I've ever had! I especially liked that the chicken wasn't over breaded and it was very juicy, which isn't always the case at a chinese restaurant. Definitely a keeper

Chicken came out very well, with a nice crispness and consistency. But what's with all the sugar? I followed the recipe for 1/2 cup of white sugar, although I had misgivings about so large an amount. Sure enough, the sweetness of the final product overwhelmed the other flavours. Was it a misprint??

this is perhaps the best homemade chinese recipe I've ever had.  i though i had all the ingredients,  I was WRONG and didn't figure it out till I was in the middle of cooking.  i didn't have the ginger so I used a fresh squeeze orange.  it still worked as was amazing!!!! my whole family loved it. will make again and again, but will make sure I have the ginger!!!!!!!!!!

FABULOUS!  I served it with rice and stir fried veggies (carrots, onions, and broccoli) for color.  I cut back a bit on the sesame oil, just as a matter of personal preference.  I wasn't sure why the "double frying" was necessary, but it was -- the second fry crisps it up and gives it the perfect texture.  The only change I would make is that next time I will cut back on the sugar -- it was too sweet for us.  Still, a splurge that's totally worth it.

BEST HOMEMADE GENERAL TSO'S WE'VE EVER HAD - THANK YOU!!!  My husband and sons LOVE this dish and it's all they order when we get take-out.  Now I can make it at home and truly, it is SOOOOO much better.  Your sauce rocks, and the chicken frying method is to DIE for!  Will be using that method again and again in other dishes.  Thank you so much for the tip and the fantastic recipe!!!!!

Delicious!! I used plain sautéed chicken breasts out of respect for my roommates and it turned out quite well. Doubled the sauce, which makes a great topping for rice!

???? I would like to try this recipe but have a hard time finding peanut or sesame oil. What's best to sub? Thanks. Don't really want to buy oils I rarely use. I do have almond oil though because I use it in beauty products I make.

The chicken is INCREDIBLE!!! Try making the sauce and not mixing it with the chicken. Eat the chicken plain, or mix with pretty much any sauce you want! It's so good! This recipe is my new ''go to'' for fried chicken!  Double frying is a neat idea that worked well!  

I only doubled the egg, as I halved the recipe and it calls for half an egg...I was lazy and used the whole egg. Other than that I followed the recipe!

I recommend using a stock pot for deep frying if u r like me and don't have a deep fryer cuz then u'dget deep fry everything... It's nice and tall and avoids splatter. I find it easier to keep the oil hot enough to fry, without worrying.

Five stars all around. Five even if u don't make the sauce. This is your new base chicken recipe!

We love take out General Tso's chicken but have to drive too far to get it when craving...I can honestly say that this is waaaay better than the take out. The only complaint I got was that I didn't make fried rice with it. 

Thank you ChefDaddy for sharing this!

This was AMAZING! I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only thing I didn't have was the ginger, but even without it this was to die for. My husband is very picky about his Chinese and only orders General Tso and he agreed this was just as good if not better than the real thing. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I loved this recipe! Instead of deep frying I pan fried in a couple of tablespoons of oil. I also didn't use the full 2 TBS in the sauce. I also agree with the other reviewers that the sauce should be doubled. Overall I was surprised at how quick it came together and I would definitely recommend this to others.

OMGoooooooodnesssss!  Yummy!  Better than some I've had in restaurants. I forgot to put the chiles in - will get some Japanese peppers; also, didn't have peanut oil - but will get some. My children and I loved it!  We love spicy, so will be really good with the chiles. Definitely not a 'quick' meal, but so worth the extra time. We love vegetables, and so I stir-fried carrots, broccoli, and mushrooms. What a wonderful and healthful meal - my picky son had seconds! Will make this again, often :)  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

**Update - 11/26/11**
Just made this using left over turkey from Thanksgiving and it is delish!  I just made the sauce and added shredded turkey breast, no deep frying involved.  Ate it over brown rice and it is much healthier version with just as much flavor (can also use shredded chicken breast).  A new favorite!!

OMG!  This is sooooo good!  I was so happy that I stumbled across this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly (except for a very, very minor change - I only used 4 chilies.  Not a super spicy person.) and it came out beautifully.  A word of caution - know how hot your stove runs!  The first time I tried to make the sauce, my wok was WAY too hot and burned everything almost instantly.  I dumped that out, lowered the heat and tried again and it was much, much better.  Also, pre-measure out your ingredients.  You will thank yourself in the end!  The only thing that I can think of that I might do differently next time is wait to add the green onion to the sauce right before adding the cornstarch.  They came out kind of brown.  That way the green will pop more.  : )

I made this tonight for dinner and it was definitely a hit with the family . I followed the directions exactly how it was written and it came out so good . I already had most of the ingredients in my pantry due to us eating a lot of Asian foods , but if you don't it could get pretty costly but most definitely worth it . I served it with plain rice and homemade eggrolls. I like my food spicy, so next time would add more spice to it but overall a great dish .

This was delish! Better than takeout and better for you! The store didnt have any red chili peppers but they had chili pepper in a tube and it worked just as good..I added 3 tablespoons of it and it had enough spicy in it for us...

Delicious!!  didn't "refry" chicken. It was crispy enough just frying it in  a saute pan with peanut oil until nice and crisp. Sauce was perfect, and absorbed well. I topped with sliced green onions, and served over rice.  I would definately make this again, and again!

Next time I make this I will probably double the sauce, as there was barely enough to coat the chicken.  Otherwise, no complaints...an amazing recipe that my husband raved about.  :)

This is amazing!! I love to eat this when we go out, but now that I have this recipe I can eat it all the time. If you don't like super spicy I wouldn't add as many peppers as it calls for. Though I thought the heat was just right.

Excellent!!  My son is a real Chinese chicken fanatic and wants to order out at least once a week.  I tried this recipe last night and he LOVED it!!  Said it is even better than his usual take out place. The compliments kept coming.  Will be using this recipe very often.  Thank you.

Wow, this recipe was amazing. I had to substitute for half the stuff and it still turned out DELICIOUS. My family (even the picky ones) were satisfied. (I wish it only made more.... I have a large family). Being only 16 I felt like a real gourmet chef!!! (EVERYONE THOUGHT I WAS TOO!!!)

we're vegetarian, so we made this with tofu instead of chicken, and we doubled the sauce.  It was amazing!!  Even better the next day for lunch!

Great recipe, I didn't have access to dried chili pepper and used sambal olek (chili paste) instead, i overdid it a little and would recommend only one tablespoon unless you like extra spicy. I will definately be cooking this again, it was a hit!

Outstanding!! I added two tablespoons of orange marmalade to slightly sweeten the sauce and served it over smashed potatoes. I also lightly toasted sesame seeds and tossed the chicken in them. Food coma!! It's the closest thing to Cheesecake Factory's orange chicken (my favorite)!

Excellent, as good as I've had at any restaurant! I followed the comments to double the sauce (good call, as there was no extra), and also made it by sauteing the chicken and loved it!

This is a really good recipe, easily made gluten-free by using a gluten-free soy sauce, aminos or tamari sauce. We pan fried the diced, coated chicken breast in olive oil and turned it to ensure light browning on each side and it worked well. We used ground chili pepper flakes because we didn’t have the dried chilies on hand and it still gave a good amount of heat. Next time we will double to sauce recipe to have extra - the whole family loved it!

Followed exactly - except no peanut oil. Took another reviewer's suggestion and substituted with dollop of peanut butter. Others are right - double the sauce. This tasted fabulous, just like take-out! The amount of cornstarch and sugar is alarming, but every once in a while, I just don't care. They're putting that much, if not more, in the same dish at a restaurant. Next time I make this, I will try the easier way of just sauteing chicken in a pan, then adding to sauce. Definitely a keeper!

My husbands favorite food is Generals Chicken, this recipe is awesome! My husband and I are in our early 20s and just starting out slowly building our collection of recipes and this is a favorite! I also have found it's easy to substitute things and customize if we don't have all the ingredients! Thanks for sharing a great recipe, we totally love it!!!

I have made this several times.  I have subbed in frozen popcorn chicken which I bake and then deep-fry for just a couple minutes to crisp up.  I always double all the sauce ingredients except for the sesame oil.  This is absolutely delicious, if it weren't for the calorie count I would make it more often!

Excellent recipe! My husband and I shared a kitchen to cook this and we are DEFINITELY cooking this again. We followed the recipe exactly. I only added a few sesame seeds for presentation afterwards and had to add a little water to thin out the sauce before tossing the chicken (only because it sat a few minutes and thickened while we finished frying the chicken). I may even try the sauce with unbreaded chicken breast just to see if it’s good without the breading or frying. Who knows?! Two thumbs up!

This recipe was soooo good. I live in an area with terrible Chinese food (yes, I know General Tsao's Chicken isn't a Chinese dish) so to be able to make something this good really brought me back. 

Added extra chili for more heat, just the way I like it

Best I've ever had, with some work. Cut the chicken a bit bigger than they say to (it shrinks a bit as is; feels like you're eating popcorn chicken with these sizes, and it's quite crispy). Also fry it each time a little longer than it says to. 

Biggest difference though was utilizing red pepper flakes (~1T) instead of red chilies, and 1.5T of apricot preserves

This is the best General Tsaos I've tried.  It tastes better than some Chinese restuarants I've ordered this from.  The chicken is nice and crispy, doesn't sog in the sauce, and you can ma it as spicy as you like.  I actually doubled the sauce portion because my family loves the sauce on their rice as well.   I love this recipe.

Fantastic! I’ve never managed frying chicken without turning it into rubber. I’m always paranoid it’s not cooked enough. I trusted the method and this is one if the best recipes I’ve made. It’s just as good as the restaurant (but about $60 cheaper with a family my size). I added more garlic because we’re garlic lovers but that’s it. Perfect!

One of my absolute favorite Chinese dishes, and this one does not disappoint. Get the heat level right, and it’s probably the best I’ve had in any restaurant, and it’s what I order everywhere.

This recipe was sooo good. I've make Korean chicken double frying but this sauce was awesome. I stuck to the recipe making it the first time and don't think I need to adjust anything. Just the right amount of spice. This is a keeper!

So good! I added sautéed broccoli and carrots to add to it and a bit more orange zest and ginger. Also I don’t double fry the chicken. My boys love this. I always have to double the sauce!

I love recipes that are good the first time you try them, and this was one of those recipes!
I only made two adjustments. I doubled the amount of garlic called out for and used 1 tsp of fresh ginger rather than ground ginger.
The orange zest and dried red chiles  added a very nice nuanced flavor!
Double frying the chicken gave it a wonderful, subtle crunch.
Definitely a hit and will make it again soon!

We loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and we think it has the perfect amount of spice, citrus and heat. 

My boyfriend loved it so much, he threw his hat across the room. Ha!

This was amazingly easy and delicious - I will never order take out General Tso again!

I subbed brown sugar for both instances of the white, left out the orange zest and instead used 1/2 cup low sodium chicken stock and 1/4 cup orange juice for mixing with the sauce corn starch. I left out the sesame and peanut oils, no need to add the fat as I added sesame seeds and unsalted peanuts when I served it. 

I also used chicken breast cubes, and they still came out amazing in the starch, brown sugar and egg mix.  No need to deep fry - a large skillet with 1/4 inch oil in it does the trick, turning with tongs.

Served on rice made with low sodium stock and some dried onion.

Loved it the first time around!  Second, even better - that same week, we liked it so much and like everyone else, we doubled the recipe - to share this time!  I use molasses instead of white sugar and I include all of the orange (rhine, pulp & juice) lots of fresh garlic & ginger  and Grannie likes it hot!  Grannie’s favorite!

My family loved this. The kids thought it was a little spicy but loved the chicken (picky eaters) added more spice for me and husbands plate. I followed recipe with a little tweaks from comments. Only used maybe 1 cup of oil in a small saucepan instead of 4 cups (less mess and saves on oil) I substitute peanut oil with a little peanut butter and used fresh ginger. I used chicken breast this time cooking 1 min first fry and 2-3 min second fary till cooked. Will try thighs next just didnt feel like cutting off fat and dealing with thihh meat moved from New York to near Milwaukee Wisconsin and was not having luck with Chinese restaurants yet. So we are glad to be able to cook it ourselves.

Very sugary chicken. I would half the sugar in sauce and add in another 1.5 tablespoons of soy sauce. (6 servings) 
I also only used 3 cups of oil and still fried great.
Otherwise, great flavor!

I used my air fryer to cook the chicken. I used Swerve in place of the sugar. This cut many calories off this dish but it did not take away from the flavor. I will make this again.

What a delicious dinner!  I cook for my husband and my daughter and her husband and everyone has different dietary restrictions,  likes and dislikes which makes cooking dinner challenging.  So when I find a dish that makes everyone smile I do my happy dance!   I was able to make this heart (no deep frying ) and diabetic (splenda instead of sugar) friendly and it is already dairy-free.  I took others suggestions and simply dusted my diced chicken with cornstarch and a little 5 spice seasoning.  Then I cooked it on medium high with a little grapeseed oil.  The rest of the recipe I followed adapting it to what I had.  Diced sweet onion instead of green onion.  I also added diced bell pepper because we love them  I also took the suggestion to double my sauce and used 1 tablespoon of creamy peanut butter instead of peanut oil which I did not have.  In the end I adjusted the heat by adding more ginger and cayenne pepper to our tastes.  I know I made several changes and which I could have made it as written but it was still a huge hit with everyone!

Great recipe!   I did not exactly follow the directions. I did fry the chicken twice. Good tip.  I did not cook the garlic and ginger enough at first.  I also forgot the sugar. It tasted awesome.  I'm going to make it that way every Sunday until the family is sick of it!  Definitely a keeper recipe.

I followed the recipe completely. The sauce was a little thinner than I wanted, but I could have added more corn starch to thicken. Other than that it was flawless. I live in Tennessee and there is no really good Chinese food here. Now I can make this whenever I get the craving. Thanks Chefdaddy!

This is a five star recipe! Easy...Quick and delicious! I had everything I needed in the house to make it and I’m going to make it again, maybe with shrimp instead of chicken. The only thing different I did was...I doubled the sauce recipe. I made enough for the jasmine rice and steamed broccoli I made as the side dishes. My family loved it.

This was one of the best recipes I've made from this site.  A few changes: I used chicken breasts cut into 1-inch cubes dusted with cornstarch and flour, sauteed in about 3T of vegetable oil.  Followed sauce recipe almost exactly, but used 2 minced garlic cloves, pinch of red pepper flakes instead of the dried chili flakes, 1/4 & 1T sugar as we're trying to cut down on sugar (it was plenty sweet enough!) and 1 t peanut butter.  Also sauteed 1 red bell pepper with the green onions.  Absolutely delicious served over short-grain brown rice with steamed broccoli on the side.  Will make again for sure!

Spot on!

Added more fresh chilis from the garden and used Tapioca flour instead of cornstarch. Doubled the sauce as recommended by others and added a cup of peanuts.

Perfect recipe.

Absolutely great flavor: take the chilis out when the sauce reaches a heat you can (almost) handle. :) 

Bit heavy on the oil -- not the sort of meal you feel light and energized after -- so one star off for that.

I followed a few people’s reviews and some tips worked well and others didn’t. I doubled the sauce but halved the sugar which turned out great. I used chile paste and it didn’t really give me the satisfying spice that I wanted so I added red pepper flakes and it worked well. The only tip I was unhappy with (and should’ve known better) was substituting peanut butter for peanut oil. The double frying process was intimidating but really made this a restaurant quality dish! I will definitely make it again with all of the modifications but will use peanut oil. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

This is the best General Tsao's chicken around.  Although the preparation is a little time consuming the end results are well worth the effort.  I did not have peanut oil and substituted olive oil and I used a tsp of dried orange peel versus the strip of orange zest.  One can also add or subtract from the 6 dried whole red  chilies.  I  used 3 and about 1/4 tsp of the chili seeds.  It all depends on how spicy you like things.

This recipe is excellent as it is; the flavor of the sauce is fantastic. However the sauce didn't thicken as much as I would've liked, possibly user error.

Leftovers are equally amazing, if you manage to have any.

I normally do not comment but this is the flavor of General Tso Chicken I fell in love with in 1989!

I made this for the first time last night, delicious! I have made different recipes for this dish and this is head and shoulders better than the rest. I've already added to my permanent list. No need to search for another recipe. YAY!!

This was delicious.  I did not do the double fry though, I simply just pan fried the chicken as a short cut.  The sauce was wonderful. Will definitely put this on the weeknight rotation.

Very good, next time I’ll use a little less sugar, and a few more peppers. Just a little too sweet for my taste, but still came out really good.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out quite good.  The chicken had a crunch and was not at all soggy.  The limited cooking time with the peppers brings out just a small amount of heat not making the dish overly spicy. The finished look is like the picture Sean Hale submitted, not the one that comes up with the recipe.  Out of curiosity, I made it a second time and added a little orange food coloring, that made it come out like the picture above.

Everyone loved this at our house.   We didn't have peanut oil, so we used peanut butter instead.   We enjoyed it with rice and broccoli. We doubled the chicken, and made four times the sauce.  Even so, it seemed like there wasn't much sauce to put on the rice.  We put half the sugar in the sauce and it was plenty.  Next time, we will not use quite as much soy sauce, since without rice, it is a bit too salty.  We may add some orange juice instead, as well as reduce the sugar to compensate for the sugar in the juice.

I have made this twice and both times it was delicious. I will say there are a lot of ingredients,  but if you have cooked asian dishes before, you probably already have many of them. Also I suggest prepping all the ingredients in advance. I even mixed all the final sauce ingredients in a cup before I started cooking. This is really worth the effort and I did not change a thing. The taste is similar to orange chicken. Also I might mention the red peppers I added were thai peppers I grew in a garden and dried in the sun a couple years ago. They grow great even in a pot and are great to dry and have on hand.

I found this recipe probably 6 years ago and have made it dozens and dozens of times. I follow the recipe to a T but use shrimp instead of chicken and it’s super yummy, one of mine and my husbands favorites. I didn’t tweak it all, comes out perfect every time. Definitely recommend.

Really good! Other reviews were very helpful. I didn't have white pepper, red chilies, green onion, ground ginger.
For frying I used 2.5 cups of vegetable oil and 1.5 cups olive oil for frying since I ran out of vegetable oil. 
I only used 1T of peanut oil, all I had.
I used entire outside of orange zest.
If you want extra sauce definitely double the ingredients. The recipe only makes enough sauce to coat chicken.

Delicious! Will definitely make again. Followed the recipe almost to a T except in frying the chicken. I put about 1/2 cup cornstarch into the egg chicken bowl, then basically fried in a few tablespoons of oil. Took out to drain, and then going forward with the rest of recipe. We just didn't want it fried in so much oil. Turned out wonderful!

Pretty straight forward and delicious, I squeeze juice from the orange into the sauce and cut back on granulated sugar. Provides a great flavor! I throw in colorful mixed peppers and carrots into the sauce prior to adding cornstarch to allow them to cook a bit, then added the cornstarch after. Turned out fine! Great consistency.

Thank you ChefDaddy for a great recipe!  This is a keeper  and my husband is thrilled that I found this.  Now we don't have to order this out.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to double the sauce.  If I could give this 10 stars I would!

This was fantastic, best recipe I've made for General Tsaos type chicken.

This was outstanding! I cut the chicken ingredients in half, but kept the sauce ingredients as stated in the recipe. The only other adjustment I made was to use 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper in place of the dried peppers. This gave just the right amount of heat for me, and my husband was happy too! We both kept commenting on how this one is a "do again", especially when our kids are home, as we know they will love it too! This is the best Chinese takeout recipe that I've made at home! The flavors are spot on! Thanks for sharing!

My wife and I loved the flavor of this dish.  I actually ordered a package of red chili peppers just so I could make this and other dishes that require them.  Ordered them on Amazon and then shipped them to South America where I live.

I have never left a review before, but have used Allrecipes for years now.  This was the first five star recipe I have found on here.  We love Asian Cuisine and I make a wonderful Orange Chicken I learned 20 years ago when I got married.  This may be even better than that.  I did not change anything, but did add two items.  Diced Waterchestnuts and peanuts.  I could eat this until the cows come home.  All 5 of my family members were in the clean plate club and husband had thirds.

OMG...it was scrumptious. I made this last night and it was not only delicious but my photo was amazing. Got rave reviews of looks alone on FB. I pretty much followed the recipe to the T, except I Tripled the sauce recipe. I omitted the Peanut oil, only because I  didn't have any so I added 1 tbsp. of Peanut Butter. Also,  Because I tripled the sauce, I only added 1/4 cup of soy sauce, low sodium and added 1/4 cup of freshly squeezed juice from tangerines. I also added 5 slices of orange zest. I also added 1 cup of green onions instead of the suggested amount. It really made a difference. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe. I finished it off with sesame seeds and it was better than the restaurant !!! I do want to add that cooking the chicken twice was time consuming but well worth it, what a difference an extra frying made. This is definitely a keeper and everyone loved it.

I have made this twice now - love that it is naturally gluten free as long as you make sure you are watching the labels on your ingredients. Everyone in the family absolutely loved it!  I doubled the recipe the last time and still didn't have enough leftovers for my lunch the next day!  Also, both times I have made it, I didn't have all the ingredients and did some substitutions - i.e. apple cider vinegar for rice vinegar, red pepper flakes for the whole red peppers.  And, it still turned out great!  The sauce is amazing and I love the way the double fried chicken turned out.  This is now a special treat for my family and they like it so much they will agree to help make it with me!

Better than the Chinese restaurants! I don't waste time doing it in stages. I combine all the ingredients in the pan and it turns out fine.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I doubled the sauce recipe and omitted about 1/4 cup of sugar or less.  The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I added strips of broccoli to the sauce along with the chicken.  I will most definitely make this again.  I may even try baking the chicken but it's pretty perfect as is.

Never figured I could make it taste anything like what you get in authentic Chinese restaurants ....but I followed the recipe and it turned out great. Only thing next time is to fry the chicken a bit longer so it stays crispy after adding all the rest of the ingredients.

I followed the recipe BUT  used 1/4 cup of sugar.  Maybe thats where I went wrong because although it was good, I was not the tsao flavor I was hoping for.   The soy sauce I used was low sodium and it also was a bit too salty to me.  Dont cut the sugar.  It may be what threw off my batch.   And yes, double the sauce.  I was not very saucy.

Amazing dish but frying the chicken was not my favorite thing to do!   However, the flavor, texture and presentation was perfect!  My husband loved it and wants it again very soon!  The only thing I changed was I used 3 chicken breasts instead of thighs and it still turned out amazing.

I would use a little less sugar in the sauce, it was very sweet! Also the sauce wasn't as thick as it was supposed to be.

We have been trying a lot of asian-inspired recipes, so I was excited to try this. The flavor was ok, but the breading and frying process did not go as smoothly as anticipated. The chicken was crunchy but never got deep golden brown, and ended up dry and overcooked. We used every inch of our tiny kitchen and generated way too many dirty dishes. For the time and effort required, I think I'll stick to stir fry or order out.

I fixed it and eliminated the deep frying because ... just because.  I didn't want to use up that much oil, and I don't have a deep fryer.  I also eliminated the egg.  I coated the chicken with cornstarch, a lot of it.  I cooked this in a wok and heated the oil and tossed the chicken to cook, removed the chicken.  I followed the recipe from there.  I love the flavorings of he sesame oil and ginger. 
good dish.

My boyfriend and I made this dish multiple times already for our families and it was a big hit everytime. Great recipe if you have a bit of time on your hands and if you want to impress someone with a easy done dish ? we added some brokoli in later on and some sesame seeds and served it on some sticky rice

I have made this recipe twice now. The second time turned out a little better than the first. first time around the store did not have any thighs and I ended up using breasts. The chicken was not as tasty. The second time I also used a little less of the Cornstarch. But wow, what a great taste!!!!

I made it how the recipe called, was a bit skeptical about putting a cup of sugar in but I did- it still ended up too salty for me... I'm not too sure why. I might try again and tweak the recipe.

Although I would have given the "fresh" dish a 4, the leftover chicken gets a 5.  It tasted better the second day.  I made the dish as written but next time would make some changes.  Here they are:  It was too salty.  I will reduce the soy sauce by half.  The chicken pieces should be larger.The recipe says to cut into 1/2" cubes.  The size of an average "chicken nugget" would be better.  The sauce will burn very quickly as written, so next time I will measure out all the ingredients, combine all the ingredients in the last two lines of step 4 and add them all at once.    I used dried "Arbol Chilies" as they're fairly mild compared to many others and the flavor was quite nice! (They're plenty hot so remove them from each plate before you serve to an unsuspecting diner!)  Or warn everyone about what to watch out for.  I served with steamed broccoli and white rice as recommended.  Next day you can combine the leftover steamed broccoli with the chicken and serve over rice. The sauce is great in that combination.  I loved the leftover chicken cold too.  There isn't a lot of sauce, unlike what you  get in a restaurant there is just enough sauce here to coat the chicken.

So crispy and delicious! We ate every bite.  My 15 yr old daughter and husband were truly impressed.  I had all the ingredients at home except chilis (used chili paste) and sesame oil (used sesame seeds) since I didn't feel like shopping.  Boning the chicken was the hardest part.  (used leg/thigh quarters).

This was very good recipe and easy to modify to taste.   I made this a few times.  I followed the recipe the 1st time.  I found that the double frying was too much.  The next time I only fried once and omitted the peanut oil.  I found it to be to much.  much better the 2nd time!

I didn't have the different oils, so I used a dollop of coconut oil. I didn't have orange, so I used a splash of lemon juice. Sracha seasoning replaced the chiles.  It was unbelievable! My family wishes that I made five pounds of it!

This was delicious! The chicken had a light crispness and softened up a bit with the sauce. The flavours very delicious and the rice absorbed the sauce to add additional flavour. Be patient when frying and don't overlook. Also, I had fried some large shrimp which enhanced the overall dish. A simple and delicious recipe!

It was tasty but I would have preferred more sauce. I will cut back on the 1 1/2 lb chicken ingredient. I also found it silly to double deep fry the chicken. I think next time I will add thin sliced carrots and small broccoli florets to replace some of the chicken.

Wow. What good flavor. Not real easy to make but if you separate all the ingredients ahead of time, it makes it easier. So follow the recipe closely and you can't go wrong. 
It is a one pan dish, which is nice. To assure you cover all the chicken with corn starch, just make sure you don't throw all the chicken in one bowl. Throw just a few in and cover those, remove and place some more in the bowl until you have all the pieces covered. (I placed all the chicken in one pot and i could not cover it all and then the pieces all got stuck together). At the end, use just use a little corn starch. It made really thick sauce with the amount i put in. In any event, this was awesome. I will be making it again. This time, I'll be ready. I highly recommend. Everybody will love this dish.

I made no changes to it and followed it  to a T. Came out almost as good as the restaurant. In time though it will be much better. I give this an A+.

It was real good! I never realized how much sugar was in General Taos (lol) so it’s not something I’ll make often but I will make it again.  It was delicious. Similar to Chinese take out but had that homemade taste to it. My husband loved it too.

I made this last night and have been craving it  today, unfortunately there were no leftovers.  My VERY picky husband really liked it too!  I will be making this often and will also be double deep frying my chicken using this batter. 
One issue I encountered was what to do with the dried peppers, as the recipe did not explain. I washed them, cut stems off, deseeded them and cooked whole, but took them out before we ate as they were tough.   I would appreciate suggestions on what to do with the peppers!

This recipe was delicious. I would be interested in possible adjustments to the amount of sweetening in the recipe. I have diabetes and my next morning glucose testing showed an elevation of sugar levels. 
That being said, it was very delicious.

It was delicious!  Made lots to have leftovers.  I did sauté broccoli and red peppers and only fried once in a bit of oil on the stove top.  I don’t think there is any wrong way to make this!

Boy was this great! A bit of work, but well worth it! Didn't have the chillies but did put in a few red pepper flakes. Used 1/2 Splenda 1/2 sugar. Wish I'd made a double batch!!!

I made no changes to recipe. a waste of chicken and my time. First, if you are going to velvet in oil- it's in and out in seconds.  3 minutes in 375 deg oil with 1/2" cubed chicken-the chicken is beyond cooked. Then you cook it again- not destroyed enuf the first time?  I blame the editors for allowing this to be seen. Way too many amateurs on this site.

Tsao’s chicken, Honestly l never really even ever tried to make such a grand recipe, this got me started, thanks,ChiefDaddy ! I changed nothing but the hot flakes, and used Bastmati Rice. Just the best tasting dinner ever and not at all that difficult. I do not eat out very often so maybe we should keep this recipe a secret. Just For us!! Thanks again, Merryb ??????????

It was great. I would cut back on the sugar. It was a little to sweet for my taste. I made it the easy way as some have suggested by just cooking the chicken in a little oil in the wok. Turned out great.

I just made this for the first time, so I’m a novice at this. I substituted peanut butter for the peanut oil, otherwise I tried to follow the recipe precisely. I had trouble keeping the oil hot enough so my frying times were longer and the chicken was crunchier than I would have liked. On tasting the end result, I would halve the peanut butter and increase the sesame oil. (The sesame oil I used was toasted. Maybe that makes a difference.) I would double the amount of sauce, especially if adding broccoli. (I didn’t, but wish I had.) It wasn’t spicy enough for my taste, but the dried peppers I used were pretty small. With all that said, it’s a great recipe and, with those adjustments, I’ll definitely make it again. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

It was the best General Tsao’s Chicken. Definitely 5 stars!!! I did exactly what’s on the recipe, but I used chicken breast instead, as I don’t have thigh when I made it. Everyone loved it!!! Also I double the sauce and it was perfect!!!!

I made it!! It was very good but the sauce didn't come out right. It simply got soaked gone. I followed this yummy dish to a Tee! I just need to figure out how to make lots more sauce. I love that sauce over the rice.  So, if your looking for a good recipe, this IS it!!! Thank you!

This is a very good rendition of General Tsao's Chicken but I would never use powdered ginger! Fresh ginger is the only way to go. Powdered ginger is only for baking cookies etc.

I must have made this recipe 50 times now.  I have never taken a picture of it because it is usually annihilated by the family as soon as it is done.  Everyone I make this for loves it, and it goes over well with people that are gluten free.

the BEST! 


I have made this twice and my picky husband raves about it. It's honestly worth the extra effort - tastes so much better than carryout. 

A good tip is to prep all the sauce ingredients ahead of time. Keep the cornstarch slurry separate, but have everything else ready to go. It makes it a lot easier. 

The second time I made this, I doubled the sauce. If you like saucy chicken, it's definitely the way to go.

This would be a great recipe for a crowd! I'd suggest frying the chicken ahead of time and keeping it crisp in the oven and tossing in the sauce right before serving. YUM!

I didn't have peanut oil either time (why is it only sold in huge jugs??) so I just used vegetable oil. Still turned out great.

Did everything step by step and the batter on the chicken was very bitter after frying it twice. Sauce was really good though before I added the ginger.

This was really tasty. I think next time I would use either a different brand of soy sauce or maybe a low sodium, I found it a bit too salty for the sauce.    It was even good cold, I may have found a new addiction!  I didn’t have an orange so I didn’t use zest. I will definitely make sure to add it next time, and there will be a next time!  I may just use an already prepared sauce and prepare and cook the chicken this way.   Try it, you’ll like it!  ??

Truly better than store bought! Make sure you double fry the chicken - that is what makes this dish the best. Also, we doubled the sauce (we like a lot of sauce!) We make this regularly instead of ordering out and even with making double and triple batches, it's NEVER enough! The more you have, the more you want!

Wow!! This is amazing. I decided to try this recipe because general tso's is my husband's favorite, the restaurant we go to is a drive. I skipped a few steps after reading a few other reviews. I only pan fried the chicken once, I put the finished batches in the oven on warm. I couldn't find peanut oil or the whole red chilli. I substituted the oil for peanut butter (1 tablespoon) and the Chili's for red pepper flakes (1/2 teaspoon), I read that in another review. However when I make it again I'll probably add more red pepper flakes as we like it a little bit spicy. Also, you will want to double the sauce. Yummy sauce.

Great recipe! We'll definitely be making this again! The only think we changed is we used a little bit of Korean red pepper flakes since we lacked dried chilli peppers. It still came out great! Thanks for sharing this!

It was Sooooo delicious. I recommend doubling the sauce ingredients so you'll have enough.

The first time we made it, there was not enough sauce. So.. the next time we doubled the sauce ingredients. It can out perfectly. Also, after all the ingredients are in the wok, let it come to a strong boil until the chicken takes on a mahogany color.

It was really good but be careful not to over-fry the chicken or it gets dried out. Other than that it’s delicious.

Wonderful dish, I substitute vegetable oil for the peanut oil. Comes out great. If you adjust the servings, the ingredient list will change but the step by step instructions don’t, make sure you read thru carefully.

This was so delicious! Usually when you get this a restaurants it's never crunch like it's supposed to be. This definitely was. A perfect mix of sweet and spicy. I'll be adding more chiles next time for a bigger kick

I almost ruined it because I forgot to get the chicken broth. I rushed out to the store but when I got home the sauce ingredients were somewhat burnt. I'm going to try it again soon.  I was ok in the end but a real waste of vegetable oil I thought.  Must be a better way

This recipe is awesome. After dropping the spicy things and adding more zest and the juice from the orange to the sauce we have a major winner. I make this dish all the time. 
I fell in love with this dish as a kid and always ordered it when eating out... and then we moved. I have searched long and far and dined at many a restaurant and ALWAYS am disappointed. Overcooked chicken is just wrong and overcooked general tsao's is all the Chinesefood restaurants serve. Boo! So getting a little fryer and finding this recipe has brought me and my loved ones much joy. Thanks.

Hands down what I have been looking for.. This is the PERFECT method for at home crispy chicken, I have tried so many other methods and this is basically the promised land of tempura style chicken! Additionally the sauce was right on too!! I made an account, just so I could rate this one! Thank you!!!

Family just loved it and I enjoyed it. The recipe worked great I made a minor mistake and my chicken did not brown as much as I wanted when I deep fried them. 

I made double the recipe and learned that I need to make a minor change when I do this recipe  next time if I am making what works out to a double recipe. I wanted extra sauce so I could throw in vegetables and I had more chicken then the recipe called for anyway. 

 I made the veg separately on the side just for this reason and left them sit in the sauce for a slow cook for 5 minutes just before serving. I also used udon noodles to serve with this dish as is soaked  up the flavour well. 

Cannot say enough about this and the flavour.

Loved it and will make again. 
We don't have a deep fryer so I heated the oil in a large stainless steel skillet - think I used about 1 1/2 cup.

I let the sauce stay on low for about an hour and it made it kind of sweet despite the peppers. You can also use canned peppers if you want and it will taste the same.

Excellent recipe! Everyone liked it.  However, I made a major substitution to make it a lot easier for me. I completely skipped the chicken frying. Instead, I used a 1 1/2 lb package of fully cooked, frozen, Publix brand Crispy Chicken Fritters, baked according to the pkg directions. They were crispy and tasty and most importantly, EASY.  I made the sauce as written except for the usual substitutions previously mentioned on others' reviews. I used 1/3 c  OJ for orange zest and 1 T peanut butter in lieu of peanut oil.  When the sauce was done, I added the baked crispy fitters to sauce, cutting larger pieces in half.  I made a single recipe of sauce which was enough but next time I will double it as others have suggested. Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty. Not enough sauce, I added 1 cup chicken broth to make more sauce. Next time will add the cornstarch to the egg & Thanks make a batter. Adding it after the chicken was in the egg it did not dissolve well & was lumpy.

Just finished eating and yum!  We didn’t have peanut oil so used just one tablespoon of peanut butter.  I have a finicky ulcer so we added four chili’s instead of six.  It wasn’t as hot as we like it, but that’s our fault.  We used slightly less sugar and I grated most of a blood orange rind into the mix instead of a strip.  Thanks for such a delicious recipe!  This will be served again soon here at our house!

The taste of the sauce was really good. I would make more sauce next time. It went very well with brown rice. The only thing  wish I had was a fryer because without one it is a messy process.

this is delicious but a lot of work.  difficult to mix the chicken with the corn starch but worth the work.

I made this exactly according to the recipe except for putting less chili in it, because I have young children.  It was delicious! I only gave it 4 stars because a) it needed more sauce - I would recommend doubling it and b) it was super sweet (but given that I put less spice in, that might have impacted the sweetness factor). Really good though and I will definitely make it again. I would suggest getting all your ingredients  measured and ready to go before starting to cook, because once you start frying the chicken you really have to move pretty quickly to assemble the dish.

Doubled the meat portion and tripled the sauce portion of the recipe and am so glad I did. Only fried the chicken once and it was enough. Added julienned carrots and broccoli and it was nice to have the veggies. Used peanut butter to thicken as other reviewers did because I didn't have peanut oil. Also added a squeeze of hoisin sauce. Truly an awesome recipe because it's so adaptable. Might cut back on the white sugar next time to see how that tastes because I like to cut that where I can.

This recipe is really great for Gluten Free eaters!  The only thing I changed was adding a few more spices to the cornstarch mixture, and I used red chilli flakes in the sauce.  All in all, it's a really great recipe!

This was easy to make and no skills required besides common sense. Lol I substituted ground turkey because that’s all I had and I made them into little balls. I also don’t have ginger or orange zest. But they are sure Yummy!

Amazing. Don't change anything, except, triple the sauce mixture. 
Followed recipe as directed,  it was outstanding, but, could have used more sauce (and heat). Had some leftovers with not enough sauce. Had to make a half batch of sauce, threw in some brocolli and carrots, to add to leftovers...A pain, but had OMG. Outstanding recipe!

All I can say is "WOW!"  This was the first time making this recipe...and actually, the first time using a deep fryer at home.  I followed the steps and recipe exactly as is, and it turned out really, really well!  If there are any changes I would make (it's hard to even give any critiques), it would be to maybe add more of the orange zest--and then use less salt.  This is only for personal preferences.  I would also try doubling the sauce at the end, as other reviewers have mentioned.  Another last note I would add:  really watch the onion, garlic, zest, pepper mix as it's cooking since it was recommended to heat the oil in high heat.  The garlic can quickly brown/burn.  I cooked mine on medium heat, and it turned out perfectly.  I absolutely love this recipe!  I may actually double the ingredients next time to have more leftovers!!

This was actually really tasty but it was very time intensive. It took me longer than it would have to order it and have it delivered. And there wasn’t enough sauce for my liking. I will maybe make this again on a weekend or when I can commit the time, but for an everyday weeknight meal - skip the work and order in.

Great recipe. I didn’t have white pepper, peanut oil, or orange zest on hand so I subbed them for black pepper, 1 tablespoon peanut butter, and 3/4 cup of orange juice. I also added sesame seeds and broccoli for a little extra crunch and for appearance. Will definitely be making this again !

The flavors and textures were outstanding.  This is an excellent recipe.  Whatever you do, double the sauce recipe.  Barely coated the chicken with none left for the rice.  I like a little sauce with the rice also.

I used 1/4 cup sugar , next time I will use one quarter cup brown sugar, I also used Ponzi sauce instead of soy sauce 1/4 cup, I used orange juice instead of orange zest, I used the fresh ginger instead of ground ginger, skinless chicken breast, when I cooked the garlic I added chopped onion, and garnished with green onion when finished,  I will use brown sugar or a little more sugar I only use the quarter cup next time I think I want a little more citrus and I will double the sauce, also make the sauce ahead of time and let it sit while preparing everything else,  my first time making General Tso's chicken and overall I was impressed I'll make it again

I added some red and orange bell peppers and broccoli and boiled it with the sauce. I also used red pepper and flakes in place of the dried peppers and chives in place of green onions because I couldn’t find them in the store! Turned out great especially with the bell peppers!!!

This is amazing!  I followed the ingredients with the exception of adding a bit of spice (garlic chili paste).  My daughter is a huge fan of PF Chang’s Spicy Chicken, and this surpasses it without a doubt.  I was second guessing the double frying technique, but it really worked out, extra crunch to hold up to the sauce and not dried out at all. Next time I will follow the suggestions of a few others, and double the sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I made this for a Christmas party at work. Everyone really liked it. I think the recipe was fantastic. I love citrus also so I beefed up the sauce with extra pepper and orange zest and ginger. But that's just a personal preference. It is wonderful as written.

The recipe was delicious. It took a bit long to cut and dredge the chicken (1hour). My family cooked white rice and broccoli to go with it. The chicken was a bit sweet so next time I would just add a bit of heat. Maybe some red pepper flakes or something along those lines.

DELICIOUS!  It's been a hit with everyone!!  I've made it twice and had nothing but rave reviews.  It's a bit time consuming so will be for special occasions :)

A lot of trouble for this....  will go back to getting take-out!  The only change I made was reducing the sugar by half.  I can’t imagine how sweet it would have been had I not done that.  At least the chcken wasn’t so over-cooked like take-out tho.  Will not make again.  More sauce would have been nice, too.

The flavor was amazing and the glaze came out wonderful. My only issue was the chicken got too dry & chewy. Maybe leave out the second frying or do less time.

This turned out almost perfect for me. It had a great balance of flavors for the most part. However, I had a feeling it would be too sweet for my taste; I was tempted to cut the sugar back, but I didn't and I wish I had. But to be fair, I think most General Tso is "too sweet" for me.  My boyfriend said it was the best General Tso he has ever had. It was a little time consuming for a weeknight meal. I think We spent an hour and a half on it and that was mostly the chicken prep and frying. I would make again with less sugar. A tip for cooking would be try to cut the chicken as uniformly as you can and don't over cook the chicken. It may not brown much, or at all, during frying. I ended up with some pieces that were overly hard but most of it had the ideal amount of crispness and softness that you would get with good takeout once combined with the sauce.

This is one delicious dish!  But with all the sugar and double frying it has to be one of the most unhealthy dishes around.  But we all need a little sin once in a while so I'll save it for a once a year.  I read the reviews and one mother fixes this regularly for her family "and the children just love it" especially when she doubles the sauce, that's a cup of sugar, her kids must be bouncing off the walls after dinner. :-)

I am not a cook 1st of all. I used cast iron pan to fry chicken and cast iron Dutch oven for cooking sauce and for adding the chicken later. My Father (rebound Chef) said he's had no better. The heat from ?? was perfect, the flavor was mouth watering, the chicken was still slightly crispy, meat was tender and without the crust falling away when served. I used 4.5 lbs. of chicken breasts and just tripled the ingredients. No more Chinese restaurant for us, as our family all ordered the General Tso anyway. Thank you!! It did "blow our chop sticks off".

When I first made this recipe, I could see the potential to be good, but oh man, it was WAY TOO SWEET! Nearly inedible.  Second time around, I've made several changes, making it more savory.

First, I skipped the deep frying. I still used the egg and seasonings for the chicken breasts  marinade. 

For the sauce, I took the 1/2c sugar and dropped it down to 2tsp, and skipped the peanut oil. Instead, I used 2tsp of tahini (crushed sesame seeds) and reduced the sesame oil to balance it out. 

It came out much better after, and it has a lot of flavor the next day.

Great recipe! I love the fried version but it's not great for the waistline. So like one reviewer said, I cook the chicken in the wok and strain it while I'm cooking the sauce and then combine at the end. Shaves off a lot of time too, and I can get it done in under 20 mins making it a viable weeknight option. Also, 1/2 cup of sugar is WAYYYYYYY too much. I've found 3 tablespoons of sugar still gives it enough sweetness and is less than half of the original amount.

I do not have a deep fryer instead I used a dutch oven with 2 liters of oil.  It still turned out very nicely.   I can eat this chicken just coated with the sauce or if you like your chicken sauce coating slightly candied or caramelized you can refry it in a no stick pan for about a minute.   Love it with stir fried veggies and any kind of rice or ramin.

Wow. This recipe is better then my local Chinese takeaway version. If you like fired, sticky chicken, sweet and sour style, then you must try this. Easy to cook, just a little time consuming. Must try. I'll make this again for sure.

I made this following the directions. I am very impressed. This is the first time I've made a General Tso's Chicken dish that tasted better than what we can get in the local Chinese restaurants. Deep frying the chicken twice really  ensures the chicken remains satisfyingly crisp even after being cooked in the sauce. My only suggestion is to replace the dried chili peppers with habanero peppers. This provides a more satisfying kick that I always wanted in this dish from a hot pepper perspective. Another plus is that habanero peppers have a nice fruity flavor that works perfectly with the sweet and savory theme this sauce has. Non-chili heads will want to stick with the regular chili peppers to keep their head from exploding.

My husband said it was spot on and treated better than our favorite Chinese restaurant.   I used chile paste instead of dried chiles, but followed the recipe exactly besides that and doubled the sauce.   Awesome recipe,  thanks for sharing!

I followed the instructions as much as I could but was still missing some ingredients. Even so, it was so delicious! I'm not good at Asian spices but this one turned out amazing. Just like all the other reviews says, this tastes really good and is also really easy to adjust and yet still taste good.

I made this tonight and it was delicious.  My notes for next time, is double the sauce - there was not enough to juice up the rice.  And personally I would cut the dried peppers to 4.  I did only use 1/4 cup of sugar and no wine, because I didn't have any.I served with broccoli and a rice / quinoa blend, was really good.

This is a MUST make again!  My husband is a General Chicken connoiseur and he loved it!  I did not have rice vinegar, so I substituted red wine vinegar.  I used Peanut Sauce in the place of the sesame oil.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

Love this recipe! Very easy to do and versatile. Made it for my family along with a variation chicken fried rice. Big hit! I subsituted red chilies for crushed red pepper flakes, more sesame seed oil for the peanut oil (mainly because I didn't have any peanut oil) and then added some Thai Red Chili paste. Yum!

The sauce was OUTSTANDING.  We couldn't find dried red chilies so I used a tablespoon of chili/garlic  sauce (green cap).  I also had some fresh ginger, so I subbed fresh for ground and minced it finely.  We're not sure about the double frying thing; we thought the chicken ended up a bit overcooked and rubbery, though the outer breading was golden and nicely crispy.  Next time we're going to go with another reviewer's suggestion and just saute the chicken (no breading), and then marry the chicken with the sauce.  Again, the sauce is truly a WINNER.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely delicious! Couldn't find whole chilies, had to substitute with red pepper flakes. I used about 1/2 tablespoon. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

loved this, I used chilli flakes as I didn't have any whole chillies.  Made half the quantity for just my husband and I, I love a lot of sauce! I might cut the sugar slightly next time as it was a bit sweet for my taste.  Also I batter cauliflower instead of chicken to make it vegetarian...... fab. X

Honestly this is an amazing dish which I highly recommend. My family really enjoyed it and even asked for me to prepare it again.One side note don't use 6 hot peppers,I suggest like 4 cause it makes it really spicy.

We don't do fried foods often, but I had several requests for General Tsao's chicken so I looked around for a good recipe. This one caught my eye and I decided to give it a try. I did it as it shows for the most part. The only substitution I did was I didn't have the chili peppers so I used chili flakes instead. I ended up using 6 T red chili flakes since I read that you could swap it out one for one. That ended up being way too spicy, even for my spice lovers so next time I make this I'll just use 3 T of the chili flakes. But other than that, it was amazing and when we get a hankering for fried foods again this will be on the top of my list to make.

Loved it.  Followed another reviewers recommendation and didn't deep fry but just sauteed the chicken and then added it back in at the end and it was amazing.  YUM!

Very good! I did a bit of oyster sauce to counteract some of the sweetness, but that is just a personal preference.

I was sceptical that this would taste like authentic General Tso but WoW, it does! I didn't even follow the recipe exactly and it was still amazing. I did to the slightly tedious doulbe fry and it does make the chicken really crunchy but I agree that if you want to avoid the fat, extra calories and mess you could easily use plain chicken and it would still be tasty. I didn't have sesame oil, ginger or chicken stock but I just subbed a little asain spice blend, one tbsp. of peanut butter and a tsp. of dry grazy mix...hey why not? LOL I will definitely make this again and keep trying out different variations. Thanks Chefdaddy!

Great recipe! I followed the advice of another reviewer and tried just normal pan frying the chicken and not deep frying. Mainly for health reasons but also because my smoke detector goes off any time we try to cook with oil haha. That's the only thing I changed about this recipe! It was delicious. As per any Asian chicken recipe, I served with rice and broccoli. The only alteration I would make would probably be to cut back a little bit on the soy sauce, and add a little more chicken broth to compensate for less liquid. That flavor was overwhelming the other flavors a bit. This will definitely be a go to recipe when I'm in the mood for some Asian food!

Although this was a decent flavored dish, I felt it was way too sweet. I will try it again though, with only about a third of the suggested sugar.

Excellent!  Don't think I've tried General Tsao's chicken before, but this was wonderful.  Everyone loved it.  I doubled the sauce recipe due to another posters comments but I think next time I would quadruple it.  I served it over rice and the rice really needed some sauce.  Other than that it was just great.  Going in my "keeper" recipe book.

I made this and it was delicious!!  I used chicken breast instead of thigh meat.  I also added a couple Fresno chilis yo the dish for some added heat and flavor.  A couple things I'll try next time is frying the white meat once, to keep it from getting over cooked, and grate the orange peel to distribute the flavor better.  My partner and I both thought this was as good as, if not better than, our favorite local Chinese restaurant's Genera Thsi

This was REALLY good!  I made it healthier than the recipe by using my air fryer to air fry the chicken.  I made the sauce as instructed, but then added the air fried chicken to the sauce.  I also used chicken breast and added some siracha for a bit of heat.

Flavor was excellent.  Do not be put off by all the igreediants.  I did use fresh ginger...I always have it on hand as I freeze it - makes it easier for zesting.  It did turn out very thick so next time I will use more broth and less corn starch and I also did not put in all of the soy sauce.  Did not do the  double deep fry -  just fried it in a little olive oil.

This was super good but double frying was definitely a must to get the chicken crispy. I tweaked the recipe just a little to use what I had in my pantry (red pepper flakes instead of the whole dried chili peppers and peanut butter for peanut oil). The sauce was fantastic. The double frying took longer for me than indicated in the recipe but well worth the extra effort and time. I would be OK just using sauteed chicken with the yummy sauce but the rest of my family really liked the chicken fried. They gave it rave reviews!

Made this tonight for the first time and it was delicious. Followed the recipe as described. Next time I'll try it without deep frying the chicken to see how it turned out. Doubled the sauce as per others' recommendations. I'll definitely be throwing this into our regular dinner rotation!

This was delicious! I used chicken breasts and sauteed as suggested by others. I'm sure my family would have preferred that I fry it, but they'll  never know that it was an option!  I followed the recipe for the sauce. I added broccoli and cabbage (1/2 a bag of slaw) to give it a bit of healthy. We felt it was too sweet, so next time I will reduce the sugar, probably by half.

Delicious!! Will definitely double the sauce recipe next time. For a quicker weeknight meal, it would also be really good with just pan fried or sautéed chicken. Also, I mixed all the wet sauce ingredients together ahead of time in a little bowl and dumped in all together- much faster and cleaner than messing with a bunch of measuring tools and ingredients and risking it burn on the stovetop.

better than take out!!  I live in town that doesn't have much in the way of Asian food.  So finding  a recipe that was fairly simple to make and tastes better than what get even in place that does have lots of choices is fantastic!  I do think the double cook method is part of what makes it feel and taste authentic.  I might try next time with canola oil to make a bit healthier though.  And I did add sesame seeds at same time I cooked the onions and such and liked that addition.  I had rice ready in rice cooker and that was perfect match...overall this required the least alterations to get how I liked of anything cooked to date off of recipes on this site!

This recipe was super easy and delicious! Instead of the orange zest (didn't have and orange) I used fresh sliced pineapple and omg! It's was absolutely amazing. The double fry definitely delivers the crunchiest chicken I've ever eaten even after dredging in the sauce.  This is by far the absolute best version for general tso' s chicken!!

I just made this recipe!! Wow!! my whole family loved it!! I did make some changes to the recipe since I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. First, I doubled the recipe for my large family. second, I used 2 tsp. powdered ginger, left of the chili peppers and put in 1 tsp red pepper flakes instead, then I didn't have any orange zest handy so I used 1/2 c. orange juice concentrate, also I didn't have peanut oil on hand either so I used 1 Tbsp. peanut butter. also I didn't want so much fat and mess, so I pan fried the chicken in 3/4 c. oil

Made this tonight and family loved it. Only thing I did different was I used cooked chicken breasts cubed, didn't do breading but will next time. I did double sauce so we had some for the rice side. Will make this again!

Spectacular!!  My family loves General Taos Chicken, so I doubled the batch, good thing.  The peppers make it hotter as they cook, just an FYI.

OMG!  This was better than take out!  I have to admit that double frying the chicken was time consuming, but totally worth the effort.  I don't have a fryer, so if you're using a frying pan be prepared for a very long prep time (mine was closer to 45 minutes).  The only changes I made was I used used apple cider vinegar because I didn't have rice wine vinegar and veg oil instead of peanut oil due to food allergies.  For the first time my son was able to enjoy General Tso's without fear.  This is now his favorite dish!

The best!  I followed the directions exactly, except that I doubled the chicken and tripled the sauce.  There was just enough sauce, but it would have been nice to have more.  Next time I'll quadruple the sauce.

Made recipe as is.   I used boneless chicken breasts (3).  Cut pieces a little small.  I had to double the sauce to get all the chicken covered.  Steamed some broccoli and threw it in there too.  Was very good.

Mine turned out absolutely perfect! It was so delicious! However; I didn't add the white pepper because I didn't have it on hand and didn't want to pay $5 for such a small amount. Also, I didn't add the chiles this time for the same reason and because I'm not a fan of "hot" spicy but I will be adding them next time! The whole family loved it so I'm making a double batch next time and one with the chiles for my husband mainly but for all of us to try it that way too. Overall I was very pleased, I burned the sauce the first time,therefore made it a second time more carefully and it came out perfect so my only advice would be take care in making the sauce. I had each ingredient pre measured and ready to add in order.. It's step-by-step and time sensitive. It's all worth it, enjoy :)

I can't give this recipe enough ratings.  I have a house full of boys and men, and eating out whether it be a restaurant or take out cost an arm and a leg.  I made a double batch according to the directions and the end result was better than any Chinese establishment we've ever eaten at.  What little bit was left over I even ate for breakfast and it taste just as amazing heated up the next day!!  Thank you for sharing, Chef Daddy!!!

The flavor was good but not nearly enough sauce. Our chicken was dry from the double fry. It may have not been dry if we had used thighs vs breast. If I make this again I will double or triple the sauce and probably not double fry. If anything I will sautee unbreaded as another user suggested.

Skipped the first half of the recipe and just added plain chicken to the pain and cooked it. Removed the chicken and added the sauce. Once sauce was made I added the chicken back in. Way too spicy for my kids so next time I will just add one chili pepper or none at all.  Great with rice, broccoli , and carrots.

I could find chilis so I used sun-dried zesty tomatoes and that worked well, especially if you don't like it too hot.  I also used chicken breasts because that's all I had and that was good too, just be careful not to fry too long because then the chicken gets too hard and because breasts are not as moist as thighs, I should have made it a little more saucy.  Taste was very good, the whole family liked it.

Better than anything that delivers to my house by far! It is a MUST to double the sauce as others have mentioned. Even with doubling sauce I didnt have much for the rice so I probably wont double the cornstarch next time or probably just triple the sauce. Fantastic recipe!

Absolutely delish! I substituted the chilies for 1/4 tsp chilli flakes just because that's all I had in at the time and it had the perfect spiciness to it. My guests were sure happy. Yum will definitely make it again.

By far the best. I didn't have rice vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar. I also doubled up on peanut oil since I didn't have sesame oil, and I don't carry red chiles in my house, so I added Siracha to taste. Kids and husband devoured this dish

Loved this recipe and so did my husband. Didn't have the dried red peppers so I used red pepper flakes. Did everything else exact...things I'd do differently, after mixing the chicken with eggs I dredge the chicken into the cornstarch then fry...the other thing is I would not fry twice I would just let the chicken fry golden the first time around.  But the sauce was delicious... with some jasmine rice it was ????

Very good. Give yourself plenty of time to make this as it is not quick like in the restaurants.  One thing I will do next time is cut the sugar way back. Although really good, it was way too sweet for me. Best part about making this at home is I went very light on the cornstarch which suits me better than the heavy coating restaurants do :-)

Best General Tso's Chicken I've ever had!  Was able to get by with 3 cups of oil in my wok.  Will probably add broccoli next time and might use breast meat instead since I had a hard time trimming the fat from the thighs.  They had a rich flavor though.

I've had General Tso's chicken from many restaurants over many years. I'm embarrassed to say that for a very long time I struggled to identify a certain elusive but key deep-background flavor in the best versions I had. Finally, in one version that must have used a little bit more of it than others had used, it revealed itself: celery salt (of all things!). I suggest substituting 1/2 teaspoon of celery salt for the full teaspoon of regular salt that's called for in the recipe. (The change in quantity has nothing to do with the celery flavor, though. A full teaspoon is just way too much saltiness for my taste.) And, by the way, don't omit the white pepper. It's another key ingredient. You could even bump up the amount a little. (I sure would like to find a way to avoid the deep-frying, though.)

Like Opheliarising, I've done it both ways - double fried vs. just plain chicken sauteed.  If someone else is doing the cooking and clean up, the double fried is nice but for a weekday meal, skip the frying and concentrate on the sauce.  We always double (sometimes triple) the amount of the sauce.  I sub crushed red pepper and gochujang (korean chile paste - I use the Seriously Korean brand because it is gluten free) for the heat.  Also try adding orange juice or subbing that for some of the water if you want to up the citrus.  Many requests from my family to make this again and again.

This simply the best Generals chicken you can make. Highest quality. I have family who refuses to eat any other general's chicken, but this one. Nothing needs added unless you want to kick up a few more notches. My family and friends ask me all the time to come over when they hear this is on the menu for the day.

Very good recipe!  Definitely better then restaurant quality.  Had no red chilies so used pepper flakes instead. Also skipped the zest and peanut oil due to not wanting to run to several stores to find it. Doubling the sauce is a must. Double fry method does work to make chicken extra crispy but for those that have young kids it's not necessary. It may be too hard so I plan on skipping that next time. Awesome recipe!!

I did not do the wet slurry because I did not want a heavy batter.  instead I salted the chicken and then dredged it in corn starch.  I still fried in veggie oil, I used grapeseed, but only had to fry once.  I also used honey instead of sugar and added a lot more chicken stock because we like it very saucy.

This was as great as in a restaurant! It took me a long time to make it since it had a LONG ingredient list, but now that I have done it, I know the next time will be much easier! I skipped a few ingredients, like peanut oil, and we didn't miss it. I tripled the recipe for my 3 BIG eaters and we have enough left over for another night! I used a wok to "deep fry".

I made this for dinner for my husband and I. I used tofu instead of chicken as we are cutting down on eating meat. It came out great. Flavor was spot on and you can adjust the spiceness. Will make this again and have a jar of this ready to use for the next time.

I made this recipe exactly as posted except for hot pepper since my husband has a "delicate" palate, plus I addedlightly sauteed broccoli and sprinkled with sesame seeds at the end just because I like it. It was excellent!  It tasted wonderful and had a great crispy consistency. I love the addition of orange zest. And it was easy to cook and not very time consuming. My family and friend's (who have all eaten General Tso's chicken in various places) said this was one of the best they've ever had. I have had requests to make again and again.

This was awesome! Agree to double the sauce recipe, & I used fresh ginger which me & the man both think really makes it perfect! Next time I want to add more peppers & maybe a chili paste like someone else recommended bc we like it spicy, but the taste & texture is spot on!

The first time I did it, there wasn't enough sauce and the soy sauce flavour was overpowering. Since then, I double the sauce recipe, put much less soy sauce (about 1/3 of what they say) and much more orange zest. This produces a ridiculously good general tsao and I love it to death! Way better than the restaurants where each piece of "chicken" is basically batter. We had been looking for a good sauce recipe, and this is definitely it! The only downsides are that it is long to make the chicken and sauce (2-3h) and I get a horrible sensation when rolling the chicken in the corn starch (like nails against chalk...)

I doubled the sauce as suggested! I used red pepper flakes because the store was out of chili peppers. I also omitted the rice vinegar because I couldn't find it. It still turned out great. Spicy and sweet!

This has to be the best recipe I have made on allrecipes.  I had zero interest in frying, so instead I followed the first part of the recipe as is and put the corn-starch covered chicken in the oven for ~18 min @ 350.  The chicken turned out fairly crispy, even when in the sauce.   I also added broccoli and carrots up front when you stir fry the green onions and garlic.  The vegetables were a little soggy, so I will add them in a little later next time.  And as others suggested, I doubled the sauce.  So delicious.

Since I live from a country where some of the ingredients are either hard to find or expensive, I made some alterations in the recipe.
I replaced rice vinegar with white vinegar, white pepper with black pepper, dried chili with regular red chili. I also disregarded the orange zest since we don't have oranges in the pantry. All turned out well and my family loves it.

We loved this dish and will make it again.  We used peanut butter rather than the oil, and used way less oil to cook them in than was called for.  The double frying makes them nice and crispy.  We also used crushed red pepper flakes,  not the whole peppers.

This has become one of my staple dishes over the past few months. I follow the recipe exactly to make the sauce and it always winds up perfectly. I vary the way in which I cook the chicken and it always ends up delicious, wether I cook it in a pan or fry it as the recipe says. Last night I tried adding cornflakes to the chicken to make it a bit crispy and it turned out amazing! I dip the chicken in a combination of flour, salt, sugar and pepper, THEN dip it in egg and lastly coat it in shredded cornflakes. Perfection!

Family loved it, this was good for my "Chef Daddy" ego.  Have to say this was hard, primarily because of the variety of ingredients required and which you need at precisely the right time.  I literally had 15 tiny bowls prepared before I began.  Next time I'll make the sauce in advance (or if I make my life easier by buying some sauce).

This is a great recipe.  I have come across the double frying technique before, and it really does make things crisp and does not add oil to the final product, when done correctly.  The level of oil in my fryer showed almost no change when the chicken was done.  Flour has been mentioned as a sub for corn starch...maybe, but I'll bet it retains a lot more oil. I made minor subs based on what I had, but the forgiving nature of this recipe has been noted by others.  Looking forward to making this again!

Definitely will make it again.  I served it over my own homemade  "Mai Fun". The only thing I did different was use peanut butter as I had no peanut oil. Well worth the double fry and all involved.  I too as one suggested to get all my ingredients lined up. I'd tried buying the peanut oil, but my small town IGA didn't carry it. My kids loved it.

The only change I made was toasting a 1/4 cup of sesame seeds and including them in the sauce. This was a personal choice and did not really change the original flavor. I made this one night last week and it was requested by another friend who heard how wonderful it was the first time...now I am making it again less than a week from my first batch for another couple tonight. It has already become very well favored by many of my friends. It will definitely be made by me over and over again.

This was wonderful.  I also followed other suggestions and didn't have time to deep fry so just sauteed the chicken in a pan and removed, then added to the sauce after it was done.  I think I will try and fry it next time and maybe try it with some cut up chicken breasts also.  Very good, restaurant style Chinese dish!

Made this just for the sauce,  Followed the recipe exactly other than using chili paste instead of red chilies. Followed step 4 and 5 to make the sauce, then tossed it on top of the chicken. Sauce turned out awesome. I used store bought cooked breaded frozen chicken and put it in the slow cooker on low with a red bell pepper cut up on low for about an hour and a half.  sauce is delicious and exactly what I was looking for; a simple, restaurant tasting sauce that wasn't too hard to make and I can eat a bunch of. Top Notch.

Soo good!  I coated the chicken as directed but only fried it once until cooked through in about 3 tablespoons of oil.  I didn't have peanut oil so I used a spoonful of creamy peanut butter  and instead of red chile I used 1 tsp ground chili paste (stuff is the bomb).  I actually had the rest of the ingredients so those were my only substitutions and it was awesome.

Made it tonight for dinner, anticipated it for a few days to kick off an asian themed week.  Kids absolutely adored it, couldnt keep their plates full enough.  

Omitted the peanut oil and balanced out with roasted sesame oil.  Also jumped the gun on the sauce, do not start the sauce until the last batch of chicken goes in for its second oil bath.

Overall this recipe is a grand slam.  My 12 and 14 y/o will never pick in my tsos takeout when we order, they cleaned the house on this dish though.

Well done OP...

I made a few changes, based on other reviews and what ingredients I had on hand.  I did not coat or deep fry the thighs at all, but browned the pieces in a little  peanut oil (huge time and fat saver!). I used sweet onion instead of green onions and added some sriracha to taste to the sauce instead of the dry chilies. I also threw in some chopped red bell pepper. I know it's not fair to the original recipe to make so many changes,  but we really liked it , even with them. IMHO, a recipe that can be tweaked a little and is still good, was a good one to begin with.

Five stars taste, one star prep. This is nothing less than spectacular, especially with a little extra ginger, garlic, and orange zest. And a little less sugar. Only downside is prep and frying of chicken. Otherwise, this is a great dish. It is worth the time and energy though.

Delicious! Like other reviewers here, I also doubled up on the sauce. Next time I will add a little peanut butter and some extra chili paste to kick the flavor up a notch.

Wowww! Very delicious, like restaurant quality! Thank you for this amazing recipe! The only tip I would give is to coat the chicken in cornstarch immediately before frying to get a more even coat of batter. If you are frying in smaller batches, coat the chicken in the cornstarch one batch at a time right before you fry them.

This recipe gave me hope again. I really almost gave up on trying to make Chinese food at home that taste anything close to reasturant quality. This is it. It may have a slightly different taste than some places you go but if you want it's an awesome base to tweak and add what you think its missing or what could bring it closer to your favourite restaurants version. But this recipe as written is amazing only thing we've chnage sometimes is how hot or mild we want it. Thank you ChefDaddy.

I did make a few changes due to items on hand. Black pepper for white pepper.  2 TBSP finely chopped crystalline ginger instead of 1/4 tsp ground dried ginger. Fresh - 1 1/2 serrano and 1 small habanero instead of 6 chillies. Also 2 TBSP crystalline ginger finely chopped, instead of dried powdered ginger, and 6 small single cloves of garlic, pressed. All other items followed to the "T."Tied for 1st best food our family and a guest had ever eaten. Chicken crunch good hours later. Highly recommended over take out or dine out, if you have the time to spare!

Absolutely LOVED this recipe!  Followed almost every single step (I used chicken breasts, cubed) - it looked too good to eat when finished!  I found it helpful like others to prep the sauce ingredients as the chicken was frying.  My ONLY comment is that I used 6 red dried chiles exactly, and the sauce was SPICEY.  I like a little kick, but it was a little overwhelming....once I got passed the heat, the sauce flavor was just out of this world.  My next go round I am going to only add one chile, or none at all and increase the zest for a more orange flavor....a WIN for me! :)

I didn't read the reviews. I thought it would be good on its own with such high stars. I like the sauce. The chicken was tough and tasteless.

Wow!  This was yummy!!  The sauce reminds me more of a sweet and sour, so next time I plan to cut back a bit on the sugar.  I didn't double fry - only single fried in about 1/4 cup of oil.  Delicious.  My whole family agreed this is a definite "keeper"!

This was really good! My modifications: left out orange zest (don't like it), used oil from jar of tahini because I didn't have peanut oil, I fried all the chicken (once) in one batch in a large electric skillet, and I doubled the sauce (based on reviews).

The chicken came out perfectly crisp, even without the second fry; I doubt the peanut oil would have made much of a difference so I'll stick with the tahini oil (or even canola); and next time I'll make the normal amount of sauce (too saucy for us).

It's not exactly what I was looking for, but my husband gave it an A+ and said it tasted just like Chinese takeout. I will definitely make this again; it really was delicious.

This chicken was amazing! the only reason I gave this recipe a 4 was the amount of corn starch listed in the ingredient list did not match what was asked to use in instructions. it's not fun to have to make a trip to the store for more cornstarch when all that was listed in the list of ingredients was 4 tablespoons total. the instructions tell you to add a cup of cornstarch to the chicken. no where in the ingredients list does it say to have a cup of cornstarch. it was worth the extra trip to the store tho. :-)

This is a very complex flavour vs some of the recipes. I loved it, must double fry. I used chicken tenders and left them in large chunks . Would double the sauce next time, it was delicious.

I've made this a couple times now.  I never have peppers on hand, so just use a nice TBS of red pepper flake.  I just made a quadruple batch and froze a few small containers of it for next time.  It is EXACTLY what we've been looking for !!

Delicious! I made it exactly as recipe outlined except for doubling the amount of spices and liquids for sauce. It was time-consuming and messy to make with all the double-frying but the end results were worth the effort. I will definitely make this again. My husband loved it. The chicken turns out crispy and tender. The sauce is heavenly. Love, Love, Love!!! I especially like that it is gluten-free. (I did use gluten-free soy sauce.)

I tried this recipe for the first time today. LOVED it!! Only changes i made was i did not double fry it as i was short of time. Served it over Bow-tie pasta sautéed with Garlic & butter and sprinkled some parmesan cheese and green onions. Yum! Will definitely make again.

Oh. My. Goodness. I have been looking for a recipe like this, it's so goooooood! I love Chinese food,  but this is better than eating out and will definitely be making it over and over again! I didn't have peanut oil, so I used some peanut sauce, and it was amazing :) Thank you ChefDaddy for posting this!

I made this recipe for the first time last week and I must say that it tasted like it came right from a restauarant.  If you follow the ingredients to the "t" its a perfect tasting recipe..
Although i feed a family if 5 we were desiring more sauce to cover the rice, so I would suggest doubling the sauce ingredients for that.
Otherwise I highly highly recmmend this recipe!

This is my family's favorite dish. I do this at least once a week. If I miss a week they would ask me when can I make them their General Tsao Chicken and to please make some extra sauce. Chef John has a lot of tasty recipes. Thanks ChefDaddy for sharing!

This was amazing!  My family loved it.  This is a favorite of theirs for take out, after eating this, they said they would never order it out again!  I used chicken breasts instead of thighs, doubled the sauce and also added just a touch of oyster sauce simply because I like it.  Wonderful!

I made this recipe as stated and just pan fried instead of deep fried. Both are spectacular. My husband is of Asian decent and it is hard to impress him when it comes to homemade Asian food. He loved this!!! No leftovers

Simple, easy and tastes as good, if not better, than what you get at good Chinese take-out places.

Whoever put this recipe together knew what they were doing. This is by far the best General Tso's recipe I've tried. Beats PF Chang's (at the restaurant) and of all the Tso's I've eaten only 1 Chinese place in Galloway OH may have a slight edge over this recipe.  Most restaurant Tso's is a disappointment. Don't have to worry about that anymore.

I used chicken breast instead of thighs, regular onions because I didn't have green onions. Fried the chicken in peanut oil because that's  what I had. Next time I will add some broccoli, other than that, this is perfect. Big thanks to the author for sharing this!

Like ChefDaddy says, don't waste your time with other recipes, this is the one you seek. I feel like the spirit of the General was here tonight helping me make this. Perfectly balanced flavor, bravo!

I've never had General Tsao's chicken at a restaurant, but this recipe made some great chicken!  I used orange juice in place of peel, and chili paste instead of chili's.  Came out amazing.  I also only coated chicken and cooked it in a small layer of oil only once.  Just fried it longer and it was still crunchy the next day with leftovers.  Great taste!!!

This recipe is so good. Sweet and spicy. Double frying the chicken really does make all the difference. I have made it with deep fried tofu before and it's just as good.

Super delicious! I didn't have dried whole chilis so I used crushed red pepper as a sub. I also used canola oil to fry and only used olive when making the sauce, but it was still tasty. I'm definitely going to have to make this again!

My son loves general tso, I came across with this recipe  and followed , only thing I didn't have was orange peel, the chicken came out really nice, although the frying took quite some time and I am a little concerned  about the fat. Next time I will follow someone else advice and just sautéed  plain chicken .
Also i noticed the sauce becomes spicier as it cools down, not a problem for us since we like spice food, but I took off the chilies just to make sure it woildnt get any spicier and my 10 year old couldn't handle it . Thank you for sharing this recipe

Awesome dish!  Definitely need to make twice as much sauce for the rice.  Ingredients are very easy to work with.  I didn't follow the recipe strictly.  I tweeked each ingredient to what I liked more and less but used them all.

I omitted the frying and only followed the second half of the recipe. Also, I used fresh jalapeño peppers instead of dried peppers. It was perfect!

This was some work for making it the first time but worth it in the end....I would agree that you need to double or triple the "sauce" - my family loves lots of sauce so I did end up doubling it but could have used more...I would also agree with others on getting your ingredients ready before you start the sauce otherwise it gets a little crazy and I'm a messy cook so my kitchen was a mess!!!! I will for sure make this again and again!!!!

Oh my this was delicious! I read through the reviews and only made one change, I doubled the sauce. I would have been disappointed if I hadn't. I couldn't find dried red chilis so I used red pepper flakes, about 1t per dried red chili is what the Internet said, but I don't know how much I used, I just poured some in. Lol. Probably about 4t since I doubled it. It was just hot enough, but so yum! I peeled almost a whole orange peel and just let it cook and removed it at the end. Besides the mess it made with the frying oil, it was fairly easy but so worth the cleanup! Will be making again, OFTEN!

As my 21 yr old son stated "this tastes amazing!".   I used chicken breast and adding 1/4 cup of fresh orange juice, and it was perfect!

Thanks to other reviews, I prepared/measured all ingredients making it easy to cook the sauce...as it does thicken quickly. 

I also agree with other reviews and will make double the sauce next time to hwve extra for the rice and will add brocolli. 

We will NEVER order General Tsao Chicken  from a Chinese restaurant again!

Thanks for sharing!

I've made this receipe 5 times so far and every time it was perfect! I did substitute 1 teaspoon of crushed red pepper for the red chilies and it was spicy enough for us.  I also decreased the sugar in the sauce from 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup  and it still tastes great!

I'been making this for years, and it is awesome. you learn to add your own touches (ie. I add crushed red peppers and double the red peppers) but it is always terrific.  When we have company, they always are looking for the white boxes from a Chinese restaurant :).
Yes, it's labor intensive - but as good as you'll get in any restaurant - double the recipe, freeze the leftovers, and enjoy it again without the work. Enjoy!

Due to food allergies I did need to make a couple of modifications to the recipe. Instead of using corn starch, we substituted arrowroot. Other than that, I made the recipe as close to what was written as was possible. It was a tremendous hit!  This is going to be one of our standard recipes!  Thanks

This was the Americanized Asian dish for which I was searching to please my gluten-free child who suffers with celiac and can no longer have fast food Asian.  I did a single rather than a double fry and the batter had just the right crunch. Left the peanut oil out as sometimes soy and peanut products cant be trusted to be gluten free in the US with cross planting in fields and contamination in processing facilities. The soy sauce I had on hand was gluten free so no problem there. Otherwise I stayed pretty true to the recipe.  I will search for gluten free peanut oil for the next time I make it but truthfully I can't imagine the dish tasting any better!

I've made this twice and love it. It's a keeper for sure. Follow the recipe (especially using thighs and frying twice to get that sit down restaurant texture) and you'll love it. The frying takes time but worth it . I'm sure It would taste good without frying but that crispy, glossy texture and the sauce is what this dish is all about. I'd rather make this than order takeout anytime. It's that good.

This is a great recipe! Id recommend it to everyone who is a fan of this popular take-out dish. 

I substituted the white sugar for a few tablespoons of maple syrup, making it a little bit healthier. Overall great dish and I will definitely make it again.

I loved it! I didn't make any changes other than adding extra green onion and extra chillie peppers. I doubled the amount of sauce because I like to stir in semi steamed broccoli to the finished product. 
I made a different recipe for awhile there, it used hoisin sauce and fresh ginger. I prefer how this recipe calls for ginger powder and does not use hoisin. This recipe is the best rendition of the Generals spicey chicken that I have ever eaten!

This is the only General Tsaos Chicken that my wife will eat now.  It is simply the best that we've ever had.  We typically will use chicken breast instead, because that's what we have on hand.  The thing that makes this recipe so good is the double frying of the chicken.

I made this for the first time tonight, and my husband loved it.  I did alter the recipe by using Chicken breasts and Adding Garlic Chili sauce  because it did not seem spicy enough. My husband said just uses more red peppers next time.(he eats them as well) Thank you for an easy recipe. we don't have good ethnic food in Oklahoma.

This was very tasty. Some may wish it a bit less sweet but I think it's good either way. For those wondering about the twice fry method, I believe I have an explanation....According to that "America's Test" cooking show, for things to get crispy, they must lose the outside water content. Often cooking until this happens creates overcooked food on the inside. The first fry starts the drying process and the time between frys allows that drying process to continue without overcooking food. Second fry finishes the cooking of the inside and browns the outside fast because much of the outside moisture has evaporated. Whew. I have found this method  works well for easily overcooked foods like fried prawns and chicken tenders. I don't know if the science of it is right, but it seems to work for me.

This is one of the tastiest recipes I've ever made. I didn't have red chilies so I substituted that with cayenne pepper and chili powder, and I doubled the sauce following others' suggestions. Definitely keeping this recipe and will make it again!

Fantastic!  Perfect flavor and bite of pepper.  Chicken fried up perfectly.  Grandchildren devoured it...claiming it was only a little hot.

I make this often; my entire family loves it. It is time consuming double frying the chicken and I am cooking for 8 (6 teenage boys) so I scale up quite a bit and only make it on the weekend when I have a bit more time at dinner to prepare. It is the best recipe for General T's chicken. Follow the recipe and the instructions and you won't be dissappointed. The recipe is spot ON.

Omg if I could give this recipe a 10 star I would! This is the best Chinese I've ever had! And I made it! My husband loves me more lol. I followed the instruction except a few, I didn't have sesame or peanut oil or orange peel, I used real peanuts instead and a tsp teriyaki sauce and flour instead of cornstarch. It turned out amazing. I would definitely make it again and again and again. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Really enjoyed this.  I did tweak it to my needs.  I sautéed the chicken with bell peppers instead of frying it.  Next time I'll cut back on the sugar as it was a little sweet for my taste too.  I also used fresh ginger instead of ground.  Great base recipe.

Must fry up chilies first and then add garlic, careful not to burn garlic! I agree with the recommendation of dredging the chicken lightly in flour, frying quickly, then add sauce and veggies. At the end, warm up 2 bags of Asian medley (from frozen food isle). Perfection!!!

Yep this is definitely 4 star. Even with all the changes I made it was still delicious. They scrapped every drop from the pan. I just marinated the chicken in soy sauce and ginger. Dredge it in cornstarch.  Deep fried till Brown. Made the sauce with ginger, garlic, red pepper flakes, juice and rind from two oranges, soy sauce, and cornstarch. Cooked the meat in sauce few minutes and omg! With some white rice yessss!. I dont even know if you can consider this the recipe given. But I used what I had and it still had them scrapping the pan. Just imagine if I followed it correctly.

Ok, I tried to bread the chicken the way it describes, but it didn't work well for me as the egg formed loose crumbs and the chicken poorly breaded.  So I dipped each piece in egg wash and threw in a bag of starch.  The other thing is, this is reaaaallly sweet!  Don't skip the salt!  Seriously, I put half the salt because of all the reviews and was sorry I did.  If you like it less  than super sweet, cut back on the sugar!  Made just to have a go at it... Didn't love it... The family didn't care much for it either.  :(.

This recipe was fantastic! I doubled the sauce but added only a quarter of what the recipe called for soy sauce and it was perfect. If I added anymore it would have overpowered the other flavors.

I've made this recipe several times. The versatility of this recipe adds a relatively large margin for error and improvisation, which is important in cooking. Want it saltier, sweeter, spicier or tangier? No problem just add a little more of which ever taste you want and it still ends up good. Just follow the directions.

This is 5/5!!!!  I have to admit I didn't have all those vinigars so I just put in a little white vinigar and it wasn't missed. I also added a little peanut butter as suggested by a reviewer since I had no peanut oil. 

Okay, so besides that- I followed the recipe exactly. I understand the point of double frying but after my chicken sits for a second it never stays crunchy!!! I don't know what I do wrong it's crispy I guess but gets kind of soft not like a KFC wing lol. But anywho, I doubled the sauce and boy that sauce is AMAZING. I let hubby try it on a spoon and he said "ohh that's really sweet" I was thinking Oh No he doesn't like it. But when I poured it over the broccoli and chicken he LOOOOOVED it. Kept trying to snag pieces and saying how good it tasted! And I'm telling you it was. I made some fried rice on the side but that chicken mmm I'm definitely saving this recipe. Hopefully it'll last for left overs tomorrow !

too much work for the end result. Followed the recipe word for word. Took much longer than 50 minutes from start to finish for me. But anyway the taste was ok, not worth spending this much time again though.

I think I may have added a tad too much broth for my liking, and had to substitute a couple ingredients, but overall this was an excellent recipe! I loved the chicken, even without the sauce, and will definitely try this again. I paired this with my own homemade vegetable fried rice and the Authentic Chinese Egg Rolls from this site.

This was the best General Tso's Chicken I have ever eaten. The recipe seemed a bit daunting, but it really wasn't difficult at all. Prepare all of your sauces and spices before heating up your wok! Also, when I added the cup of cornstarch to the chicken and egg mixture, it turned into a giant gloppy gluey mess. I got a second bowl, put approximately one cup of plain cornstarch, and added the chicken piece by piece to coat. It came out perfectly crispy and perfectly spiced. This is definitely a keeper.

My fiancé LOVED this! I didn't deep-fry twice because I didn't see the point, and it was very crispy. I just fried until golden brown in about an inch of oil. I didn't have peanut oil so I omitted it. It was still amazing! Next time I will double the sauce and maybe add some veggies.

Great RECIPE! :-)
I did not bread and deep fry the chicken,  saving time and calories (non-stick, pan fried)... But was still great flavor from the sauce.  I had never tried Chinese cooking before, but this was easy!  (& Yummy!)

This is awesome one of my new go to dinners. I just didn't have the whole chiles so I used crushed red pepper. Highly recommend this!

this dish was very good, i didn't use the chile's, due to i dont like spice, and i substituted the orange peel for orange juice, because that's what i had on hand. next time i will do the orange peel, still very good asian dish ;).

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! We stocked up on chicken thighs just because of this recipe:) Husband approves and so does dear daughter! I didn't have ground white pepper, ground ginger, and chicken broth and it still came out bomb!!! (But they don't know that lol)

The sauce was fantastic, but something went awry for me in the coating/frying process. I tried to follow the instructions exactly but coating the chicken turned into a big gloopy mess and ended up making the coating too thick. Since it was such a time-consuming process I think I will follow some other reviewers' suggestion to just sauté the chicken and save some frustration and fat. :) I also did not have peanut oil but using sesame oil/peanut butter instead worked great.

amazing exactly the way it is written I followed everything perfectly and this was the most amazing general chicken I've ever had.  the chicken never got soggy even after mixing it with the sauce, due to the double frying method. I love crunchy general chicken.  I added a splash of orange juice just because I had it.  What ill do next time is double the sauce it was barely barely enough using three cut up chicken thighs.  I also had steamed short grain jasmine rice with it.  the chili pods I used were not spicy at all I got the wrong kind so next time ill add crushed red peppers to the recipe.

Delicious! If juggling several dishes be careful not to over cook the sauce. Add extra orange for some more yummy goodness.

I stir fried the chicken in about 3-4 T oil instead of deep fried it.in my last batch I added fresh brocolli carrots & red pepper strips. I made more sauce: after zesting an entire orange & juiced it. This Was an Amazing Dinner!

This recipe was very good.  I used 1/2 a tsp of powdered garlic powder and a 1/4 tsp of chilli powder because that is what i had available in the pantry.  I doubled the sauce recipe because i like lots of sauce. I only fried the chicken once. A very good recipe indeed.

This was a great recipe - I didn't double fry the chicken and I had to double the sauce. My family loved it. I also added water chestnuts and bamboo shoots. They soaked up the sauce spices great and added a lot of different textures to the meal.

My soy sauce was low sodium but too salty so I think I used too much of it so it affected the dish.  I'll try it again with less soy sauce.

The about 2 hour cooking session I just completed was an absolute disaster lol, but I'm not blaming the recipe as I'm a beginner, but I'm usually very good at following a recipe. The chicken itself came out semi-edible but I don't think I added the sauce ingredients fast enough and the garlic and onion burned while the rest of the sauce ended up caramelizing. I hoped for a miracle and coated half the chicken in the sauce, but didn't turn out. I ended up taking the other half of the chicken and coating it with a store-bought orange chicken sauce and that was about a two heh.

This was the first time we cooked a chinese recipe that actually tasted like what you get at a restaurant.  I would have liked the sauce to be a bit clingier so will cook it longer next time.

I couldn't find an orange to zest here in central ohio in the middle of july, so i halved the sugar in the sauce and added a couple tablespoons of orange marmalade. Still too sweet for me. Next time i think I'll just add a couple tablespoons of sugar and the same amount of marmalade. All in all, a very good recipe. Just for kicks and grins, i added a dash of cinnamon in with the ginger.

This is the closest of anything thing I've ever had to General Tsao's chicken from my favorite resturant. It may be a little time consuming but it's sooo worth the effort. This is the second time I've made it and the family can't get enough. Thanks for the great recipe!

The sauce made as written is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The only thing is the cook time to thicken the sauce was slightly off. Once you add the chicken back into the sauce I'd recommend tossing the timer aside and watching it closely until it thickens to your liking. For me it was more like 5 minutes over about medium/high heat.

Excellent recipe! We have made it many times and it is easy quick and restaurant quality every time. I substituted plain flour for the corn starch, I always do this when I am cooking asian and etc. recipes, it is just my personal preference.

Made this last night. Best generals chicken I've ever had! My boyfriend loved it too-will definitely be doubling the sauce next time, but it's not necessary if you don't like sauce like I do. Great flavor and great texture!

Yum!! My husband loved this.  It was a little labor intensive, but it was really good!! The double frying was what took the longest for me, but it is worth doing it that way.  It make it extra crispy, and stayed crispy once it was in the sauce.  No leftovers for us, it is all gone.

I loved this recipe, and I had to make a few edits because I didn't have some items and I was not able to get to the grocery store. I used shallots instead of green onions, I used 1/2 cup of orange juice instead of zest, srarachi hot sauce, and fried in coconut oil. But the final product was amazing. I served it with black "forbidden" rice and broccoli slaw.

This was a great recipe. It reminds me so much of my favorite Chinese food places in Baltimore,MD. Made me miss home. I used chicken breast instead of the thighs and I added blanched broccoli that I deep fried with the last frying of the chicken. Great recipe

This was soooooo good!  Kind of labour intensive though, so when I make it again, I will definitely do it on a weekend when I have more time.  Like others, I am not sure why you have to double fry the chicken but it was so worth it!! Even the couple of people in the house who don't like sauces ate the chicken plain and thought it was delicious!  I did add a smidgen more orange zest and a couple extra chili peppers, but I don't think that took away from the original recipe.  Thank you, ChefDaddy, for a great recipe that was as good as the best General Tsao's chicken I have eaten in a restaurant and a good deal better than most of the General Tsao's I have eaten out!

What an awesome recipe!  The crunch of the chicken along with the sweet heat of the sauce just made it taste perfect.  I also appreciate that this recipes seems to hold up to a variety of tweaking.  You can suit your own taste buds with more or less heat, sweet, crunch, fried or baked, with veggies or not, citrus, garlic, ginger, peanutbutter or oil, sesame or no .... Lots of flexibility!  A big thanks to Chef Daddy!

Made this with boneless, skinless as other reviewers did. It was okay. I wasn't blown away by it. It certainly passes as a respectable weeknight dinner.

We give it 4.5 stars.  It did take a long time to prepare with the steps involved...frying batches of chicken and then refrying.  Because I didn't anticipate the length of time to prepare this dish, our dinner was very late.  I don't like eating such a heavy meal and then going to bed soon afterwards.  So, plan ahead...this dish takes longer to prepare than the time listed.  Overall, it was good.  I found the full cup of cornstarch to be a bit much...however, I don't know what the result would be if you reduced it.  The pieces of chicken were crispy...even the next day after sitting in the sauce overnight.  I would probably make this again.

It's really easy and taste great.  I have to eat gluten free and this was easy to sub out gluten free soy sauce and cornstarch and using gluten free flour on the chicken and it  was awesome.  It's hard to eat out Asian food, so when I can make something at home that taste great, it's exciting.

Good, but I modify a bit.  

First off I follow the breading recipe for this recipe http://allrecipes.com/recipe/springfield-style-cashew-chicken-i/detail.aspx   only because it's what I use for the Springfield Style Cashew Chicken, and I LOVE it!(if you like cashew chicken, you must try this link for the recipe) I've also done just cooked chicken breast, no breading for a healthier version.

I do a little less sugar also, only because I find it a bit too sweet for me.  My family love the recipe though

This recipe was wonderful! So full of flavor!! It's just like Chinese take-out. I doubled the sauce, and made a few substitutions for things I had on hand. For the double recipe I added 1t. onion powder for the green onions, 1t. chili powder for the red chilies, and 2T. creamy peanut butter for the peanut oil. Next time I make it I'll plan ahead & buy the real ingredients because I'm sure it will only improve the taste.

Notes for next time: A lot of work. Try mixing sauce ingredients early if necessary.  Try subbing orange juice for orange zest.  Double the sauce.

Great recipe!  Tastes like the dish we love from an area restaurant.  I did make a few changes.  I omitted the sesame and peanut oils and the orange zest because I didn't have any. I don't think it would have made a difference with the oils. I also substituted half of the sugar with brown sugar. I did NOT double fry.  Didn't see the necessity in that since the chicken will soften in the sauce. During the simmer stage, I added 1/4 cup orange juice and sliced carrots (because that's the way our favorite go-to spot for Chinese serves theirs).  I served it with vegetable fried rice. This General Chicken is so good it'll make you slap your mama! :)

first off.. me and bf don't know what "authentic" gen. tsao chicken tastes like.. but we do know we really enjoyed this dish.. i made this bc bf was craving something sweet and savory.. i forgot to buy an orange while at the store so i used a sweet lime's peel.. it didn't seem to add anything though :(.. i was worried about it being too sweet so i only added 1/4 cup of sugar.. big mistake.. i dissolved the lacking 1/4 cup of sugar in some water and then incorporated it into the final dish.. almost had a disaster b/c i added too much cornstarch.. luckily the sugar water helped thin it out.. didn't want bf to take the time to clean out the deep fryer so i used sauteed breast meat.. ty for this yummy sweet-heat recipe :)

Very good...I did not have the peppers on hand, but used a bit of ground red pepper and it was great. I'll add crushed red pepper to some next time, but hesitated in case my kids would think it too spicy. I also grated the peel to give it a little more orange flavor. I cut a little of the sugar, and might cut back a little more next time, along with a little less soy (personal preference on both), but this is a keeper...better than most restaurants.

Living in Holland for over 20 years, one of the things I missed most was the Chinese take-out, General Tsaos was one of the favorites. Yes its alot of work, but well worth it! I used just a bit more citrus then the recipe calls for and added OJ. Hit the mark, no homesickness anymore.

I didn't have the red chilies so I used sriracha sauce and it wasn't quite spicy enough. This is a very tasty sauce though and I won't forget the chilies next time!

This was an awesome recipe! I didn't have any red chiles so I used red pepper flakes and it didn't give the spice and flavor that it needed. So I will make it next time with the chiles.

The chicken was hard.  I wonder if flour would have been better to use instead of cornstarch or if not cooking it twice would have made it better?  Also, I think I may have burned the garlic in the pan because of how quickly you have to add all of the other ingredients.  It may have been better if I didn't burn the garlic.. but I'm not going to make it again to see if it would have made a difference.

Made it exactly as directed, didnt change anything. I was so looking forward to this but was disappointed. It was good, but tasted EXACTLY like any Teriyaki chicken recipe I've ever made, not General Tsao chicken that you get at a chinese restaurant. I will be looking for a more authentic sauce recipe.

I made this recipe *exactly* as written, including double-frying the chicken. The end result was nothing short of perfect! It can easily compete with the best General Tso's chicken at the best Chinese restaurant! 5 stars!

Amazing taste! Also substitution are soo easy with this recipe. I tend to add more jalapenos, use regular vinegar, and bake my chicken. Its always a people pleaser.

This recipe is delicious.  My family had never seen me cook a Chinese dish before and they were delightfully surprised.  I am giving it five starts for flavor despite the fact that it took me forever to make it.  But worth it!

One additional note, for all of those that had trouble finding the chili peppers, try Wal-Mart. My hubby and I found a (HUGE!) bag of them in the produce department.

My frugal husband brought home some boneless skinless chicken thighs  during a recent foray into town, and I was at a loss for ideas about how to cook them to make them turn out right.  This recipe brings out the natural punch of thigh meat without making it taste gamy or overpowering.  Super color and crunch on the outside, blissfully tender, juicy goodness on the inside, and the sauce is just wonderful!  Sometimes the best recipes are just-right proportions of simple ingredients.  You've hit it directly on the nose.  This recipe is now one of our favorites.  I intend to share it with my daughter, as I know the grandkids will love it as much as we do.  Thanks so much for sharing it!

A little time consuming but not very difficult.  I couldn't find fresh chilies, but a pinch worth of dried red pepper flakes (~1/4 tsp) produced that nice mild heat typical of takeout.  We have a peanut allergy in our household and omitted the peanut oil, but I didn't miss it at all in the sauce. I like the chicken crispy, so I kept chicken and sauce separate until just prior to serving.  Leftovers store well this way, too.

No more Chinese takeout for me.  I perfected fried rice, with a recipe I found on this website, and now I've perfected General Tsao's Chicken!!!!  This is my very favorite Chinese dish and this recipe is wonderful.  The first time I didn't deep fry my chicken, just marinated it slightly in soy sauce and garlic, then stir fried it. It was delicious that way, but may try it fried this time.  I can't wait!  Mmmmm...

very good!! Tasted like a little less sweeter version of sesame chicken. I did fry it twice, put in oven in between fryings. I skipped the hot red pepper. Kids loved it, esp Todd. It was time consuming, might just be better off going out to eat!

WOW this was good!!  I made it last night for dinner and there were no left overs!  I accidentally missed step 5 and just threw the chicken in the sauce without thickening it first and it was still amazing!!  We paired it with the Chinese chicken fried rice II -5 stars- from this site  but we left the chicken out of it.  AWESOME dinner!!

Perfect recipe. you can modify easily according to vegetables available in your house. also i tried using simple boiled chicken chunks instead of frying them. it came to very similar and healthier choice.

I can't attest to the batter, but the sauce...wow!  Had to make some substitutions with what was on hand...1 tbsp of peanut butter instead of peanut oil, 1/4 cup truvia instead of sugar, and sriracha and some crushed red pepper flakes instead of dried whole chiles...but i think one or the other would have sufficed because my tongue is dying.

This recipe is lovely as is. My only suggestion would be to double or even triple the sauce. It's nice to have sauce for the broccoli and rice.

Delicious! Turned out fab! Tone down the corn starch though to get a better consistency. I added some peppers just at the end and it was an awesome touch! I only left out the peanut oil (cos I didn't have any) and it was fine. A must try!

Just as good if not better than my favorite Chinese take-out in town.  I think the double fry is the trick to getting them that crunchy, yet chewy consistency.  My recommendation is to cut the chicken pieces relatively thick.  I used coconut oil in my sauce, which made it really sweet.  My husband added hot sauce to his to up the spicy-factor that I can't handle.  I will be making the recipe again, especially for my general tso's-lovin' brother.

I typically do not write reviews for recipes, but since I have been begged by my husband to make this for the third time (in a few weeks), I believe that says enough!  Pretty sure this is one of the best recipes I have ever made!  Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly :)

Very very good! I will admit I didn't do all the frying, I just sauteed the chicken but I am positive it would be even more amazing made as written. I doubled the sauce because my husband loves it and added a few more of the peppers, crushed. I can't wait to make this again.

I normally wouldn't write a review but in this case I just had to. My entire family loved, loved, loved it!  I followed the entire recipe and it was great. Just like the General Tsao's Chicken that I love to buy. Now I can make it myself.

It was a bit too time consuming for a week night, but was well worth the effort. This dish is all about the sauce and it was the perfect blend of Asian flavors. A definite keeper, but maybe for having guests over or a weekend dinner instead.

This recipe turns out wonderfully every time! The only con is it is time consuming to fry so many small batches. But it's worth it if you have an hour for dinner prep.

I did not bread/fry the chicken as I wanted to cook a bit healthier. My issue is with the sauce itself, not the chicken. The only ingredient I didn't have is sesame oil. So, I included all other ingredients except the sesame oil. I also cut back on the sugar as 1/2 cup seemed like WAY too much. It did not taste even close to General Tsao's chicken that I get from Chinese takeout places. It tasted a lot soy saucey/gingery with a touch of vinegar. Reminded me a lot of my mom's ginger chicken she would cook. I won't be making this recipe again for General Tsao's.

Great recipe, seems like a lot of steps at first but becomes very easy to make the 2nd time around. I only fried my chicken once and made my sauce in a seperate pot while chicken was cooking. Next time I will try broccoli with it.

Excellent! The sauce is wonderful and I did double it. Next time I think I will try to save a few calories and instead of deep frying, I will saute the chicken then add to the sauce. I wonder if I will wreck the recipe then. Thanks ChefDaddy!

Very good!  My MR and I like our General Tsao's spicy and even with the 6 peppers this was not spicy at all so next time we will also add some crushed red pepper.  The lack of heat aside, the flavor was very good.  My MR is very particular about his General Tsao's and he said that this was one of the best he has had.  Will drf make again!  P.s. I expected it to be hard to make but it really wasn't.  don't be intimidated by the double fry.

I wouldn't say this tastes like General Tsao's.  The flavor is a little heavy on soy.  The chicken without the sauce is wonderful.  I would like to figure out a way to make it taste a little less like soy.  It's not bad though.

This is exactly like the chicken you get at a Chinese restaurant! It was excellent! I used chicken breast & then sauteed the pieces in a small amount of oil. You can also make it as spicy or as bland as you want. I will definitely keep this one!

LOVED this recipe!! It is so so delicious but I would recommend that you read and reread the recipe first and lay out all ingredients.  We changed a few things.  I used Thai Peanut Sauce instead of peanut oil and Thai chili sauce instead of red chilies.  It is time consuming, so I think the next time we prepare this dish, we will fry the chicken ahead of time.  But it is definitely a recipe I will keep and use again.

O.M.G. This was SO good! Not quite as good as our local Chinese restaurant but VERY close! 
I followed the recipe pretty closely, only did a few things differently.
I did not fry the chicken twice, only once (not sure I get that whole part)I also peppered the chicken after frying (no salt because of all the sodium in soy sauce(: )  
Along with the orange zest, I squeezed half of the orange for its juice and threw in a splash of worcestershire to cut the soy sauce flavor a little bit.
I also did not have any dried chilies so I used dried chili flakes...I just sprinkled it in til it looked good (: I like spicy though, so it was quite a bit.
I was literally eating the chicken out of the pan while waiting for the rice to cook! It was VERY good! Definitely going to save this one!!! YUM!

We made this becuase it is so rare to get such consistant 5 star reviews.  I have never reviewed a recipe before but this one deserves to be the first.
My husband and I were amazed at how good it was and how much it looked like Chinese food from a restaurant.  We like stir fry and while it is good, it does not look like it does at PF Changs!  

We did not fry twice...we experimented on one peice and decided it was good enough with just one round.  We did cut back on the sugar and used the orange juice from the orange we used for zest.

While not the healthiest in the world, it is a great treat!

My husband actually kissed my hand after he ate this, signaling a job well done :) Great recipe! I made my portion with tofu, and that turned out well, too. Thanks for a great recipe!
