This was pretty good...I found it spiced a little mildly. I'd add more salt, pepper, turmeric, and chili powder next time. In all honesty, if I had added cumin and curry, it would have been been my normal curry recipe. So-long story short-tastes good, feeds a lot of people (good for a family meal), but is pretty much a curry-less curry.

Very colorful, great flavor. Had trouble cooking rice thoroughly.
