Excellent recipe as is.  But I am never one to go with "as is", since I always feel recipes can be improved upon!  Also, I had  bunch of stuff sitting in my fridge that I wanted to get rid of...so, my take on it is as follows:    (1)  Used 2 small zucchinis and 2 small squash (instead of all zucchini - I'm not THAT huge a fan of zucchini) (2)  Like the previous reviewer, I used 2 shallow pie crusts (or 1 deep dish pie crust would be fine as well) instead of just the one.  (3)  Sauteed .25 lbs ham, 1 small diced onion   and 2 cloves minced garlic and added this to the  zucchini/squash misxture  (4)  Instead of mozzarella, used sharp cheddar cheese (grated) that I had leftover.

RESULT: Fabulous.  My husband and I call this the "kitchen sink  quiche".  We just used everything that we had sitting in the fridge and mized it all up and threw it into the quiche and it came out wonderfully!

HINT:  After baking the pie crusts, brush them with an egg wash to keep it from getting soggy!!!

Turned out great.  Wanted to add more veggies, so I added to grated carrots, 1/2 minced yellow onion, 3 garlic cloves minced.  Sauteed all veggies together and ommitted garlic powder from cheese mixture since I used garlic clove with veggies.  Used 1 zucchini and it turned out beautifully!  Will definitely make again and again.  Oh, was out of half and half so used mixture of heavy cream and milk.

This was really tasty and I don't care much for zucchini!  The only thing I did differently was to saute a little onion with the zucchini. Use the 'No Roll Pie Crust I' recipe to make this even easier.

Sweet JESUS, this is DELISH.  Just made this for my best friend's bridal shower.  Made an extra for my own household, and I think it's my new favorite food.  I made it just as it's written in the recipe, but I doubled it and added one egg.  It was a huge hit at the shower; everyone was so impressed with my cooking skills (this quiche looks so pretty along with the amazing taste), but it was SO easy to make.

This made a delicous Sunday morning breakfast.  A great way to get my family to eat vegetables.  All the ingredients fit perfect in a 9" deep dish pie shell.  I used pepperjack cheese for a little kick. I have no idea how many zucchinis make a pound, I used 3 and it worked out fine.  I also used the side of my box grater to slice the zucchini really thin, very quick prep time.

This is really good!  Based on the other reviews, I did the following: I used part skim ricotta and mozzarella, fat free half & half, 2 eggs + 1/4 c. Egg Beaters.  I also used the Smart Balance stick for my butter amount.  I also added a few sprinkles of Italian Seasoning to my ricotta mixture.  I added onion and garlic to the zucchini, as I was sauteing it.  However, I didn't layer everything; I just mixed it all together.  I had a little filling left over, and just baked it in a custard cup.  YUM!  I plan to try this with yellow squash, the next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm not a fan of quiche, but this recipe looked too pretty to pass up! I felt it was a little too salty, but everyone else thought it was great.  The presentation of this dish is spectacular.

My pie tins are pretty shallow, so I was able to make two pies out of the filling ingredients. I made one just like the recipe said, but for the other, I put sliced tomatoes on top and sprinkled fresh grated parmesan cheese over. I liked them both, as did my family of six. Will definately make again!

This is a great standard recipe.  I didn't have ricotta cheese OR half and half, so I used lowfat cottage cheese and no fat evaporated skim milk and I whizzed the mixture up in a small food processer.  I added grated cheese and lots of Italian seasoning. Along with the mozzarella, I added some  goat cheese.  I followed the advice of other members and sliced the zucchini on a box grater to get a thin, uniform slice.  I sauteed the zucchini with sweet onion until translucent.  My husband and I both thought the taste and texture was excellent!  We will be eating this often.   Thank you!

This quiche recipe is quite tasty. I would recommend layering the entire top with sliced zucchini. I only created a ring around the outer edge. As a result, the center rose higher than the edge, and I didn't really like the way it looked. Otherwise, I will definitely make this again.

This was so good! We added mushroom and bacon to the original recipe and instead of keeping it in the oven for 45min, we left it in for 30min and it was perfect. I definitely recommend trying this dish if you like quiche and or/ zucchini. My husband and I happen to like both a lot so this was a great recipe for us! Something different, full of taste and color. :)

This was an easy, good weeknight meal for my family.  After reading some others reviews, I also added onion and garlic....good thing I did.  Next time I will use a sharper cheese than mozzarella.

Delicious recipe for using all my garden fresh zucchini! I will try using a can of evaporated milk in place of the half-and-half next time, just to cut down on the fat. I also found I had to bake it quite a bit longer to set, over an hour at least. But it was worth the wait and I would definitely make this again...thanks for sharing!

Easy and delicious! This is a wonderful basic quiche recipe and it is easy to make substitutions, depending on what you have on hand. Great as is, but last night I added cubed ham, baby bella mushrooms and onion along with the zucchini. Too late, I discovered I didn't have ricotta cheese but it turned out great without it. You can use any cheese you have on hand. I like Kraft's italian blend but once made it with shredded pepper-jack and my hubby loved that! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was really great tasting and easy to make! I used a bag of frozen sliced zucchini as a time saver. I used a deep dish pie crust and I sauteed the zucchini with onion and garlic. To make this recipe a little more "figure friendly" I substituted I can't believe it's not butter, fat free ricotta, only 1 cup of reduced fat mozzarella, and egg beaters. Even after the substitutions it was delicious :)

This was a hit!  I used to use a very basic quiche recipe but one day just decided to try something new!  This recipe has tons of flavor from all of the herbs.  It also has a lovely texture with the ricotta.  I took the advice of others and used the box grater to cut the zucchini.  It turned out great!

WOW!  Very tasty recipe.  I made a few small changes... instead of making a crust I used a dough-boy refrigerated crust.  I also used 3 cloves crushed garlic, 3/4 Cup Onion... sauteed both in butter until lightly brown.  Subbed yellow summer squash for half of zucchini, worked really well.  Only used 1/2 tsp salt because I added about 1/4C real bacon bits.  1/2 C cheddar in place of part of the mozzarella, also sprinkled Parmesan cheese on each layer.  Used fresh basil, cause I had it... YUMMM!  Husband really like it, so did I .  The only downside... it was a bit time consuming, when I rather would have thrown something together.  Next time I think I will attempt it in steps, so the day of I can put it all in the crust and just bake it!  Lots of squash on the vine... I'll be making this often!

This was great! My friend told me it was "magazine pretty" when I showed her the finished product--and it only took a minute to lay the zucchini slices on the top.  I was also able to make 2 using this recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!

I made this quiche for vegetarian friends and they raved.  The next time I tried it, I added sliced mushrooms and about 6 sliced green onions.  It was even better!  It is my favorite quiche recipe now.  Thanks so much!

Delicious!  I omitted the Ricotta and used fresh basil and oregano.  Definitely a repeat in my home.  I might try adding bacon or ham as well.

This is an easy quiche that works well for our household of meat eaters and vegetarians.  It's beautiful AND tasty.

A different way to use up some garden zucchini- very good recipe! A little too much cheese- next time I will use less mozzerlla and mix it in with the eggs, etc. This recipe made more filling than what would fit in a pie pan- I ended up making a second, crustless quiche in a smaller dish (which turned out just as good!)

Wonderful flavor!  I made this for my family for a Sunday morning brunch.  Even the kids ate it up!  The filling fit perfectly into a deep dish crust.  I brushed the crust with an eggwash before baking it.  If you are looking for something that looks as good as it tastes, this is it!  Thank you, Dorothy for sharing this!

Not at all difficult to make, and fairly tasty. Mozzarella would not be my first choice for a cheese for quiche for two reasons. First, it is very mild, and so adds little flavour and second, it tends to get somewhat rubbery when cooked. Next time, I will use old cheddar instead. Thanks!

Fantastic quiche recipe! This was my first time making quiche and I was really pleased with how it turned out. I will use this as a base for all my quiche in the future. :)  I added mushrooms when sautéing the zucchini and some red peppers and green onions to the mixture before baking.

This was great as is, but can include a number of additions and/or substitutions.  I sometimes cut down on the cheese with no consequence - still rich and delicious.

I love this recipe! I have made it a dozen times, sometimes exactly as written, sometimes with broccoli or onions or summer squash. It always looks so nice with the sliced zucchini on top, and tastes great, even reheated.

Delicious! The ricotta gives the quiche a nice fluffy texture. I used white cheddar instead of mozzarella for a bolder taste, and it worked great.

This quiche was pretty easy to make and definitely surprised me. While the cook time is underestimated, the quiche itself is very versatile and and vegetables can be used in it. I added squash and onions to mine! Turned out great.

Very good!  I didn't have any mozzerella, so I used jack/cheddar.  It was still very good.  I figured my kids wouldn't like the zucchini, so I doubled the recipe and made two quiches - using zucchini in only one and putting bacon in the other.  The z quiche was just as good if not better than the bacon.  I wil make this again.

I thought it was so-so but the man loved it.  A little bland for me.  It took well over an hour to cook, not 45 min.  Next time I'll try cheddar instead of mozzarella to see if it gives it a little more kick.

The recipe turned out wonderful even with my substitutions and additions!  I had a lot of leftovers and they worked perfectly.  I used mexican squash instead of zuccini and added onion, garlic and spinach.  I used blended cottage cheese instead of the ricotta and part sharp cheddar with the mozzerella.  I used no-fat evaportated milk instead of the half and half.  It is so good, I am glad I planted squash in the garden!  Thank  you for the recipe and all those who made suggestions.

We couldn't decide if we liked it warmed up or cold.  It is very delicious.  I took a few liberties (I used yellow squash plus zukes, and an organic carrot that was begging to be included.  I had enough for 2 pies and they were chock full of veggies)
Saute the chopped veggies in a tiny bit of olive oil- added minced garlic (of course) and a few big pinches of good shredded parm, plus mozzarella.  We ate with some brussels sprouts w/bacon and it was a fantastic meal with lots of leftovers.

I have not even tasted it yet, but the quiche is in the oven and it looks/smells amaaaaaaaaazzing. followed the recipe but after sauteeing the zucchini for a few minutes I added some diced tomatoes and let them sautee as well. I wanted to add mushrooms and green bell peppers to the sautee mix but since is my first time making the dish I held off. I think it's going to be fantastic though! (If it's not, I'll reverse my review :)

This was delicious - even my anti-zucchini kids liked it. I used cottage cheese instead of the ricotta and milk instead of the cream because that's what I had on hand and it was great. Next time I'll double it.

I was really just looking for the basics in this recipe.  I changed quite a bit.  I used the egg/cream measurement and temp/time suggested in this recipe.  But then I used broccoli that I minced in the food processor first and ground sausage, cheddar cheese, parmesan cheese, salt and pepper.  I love quiche.  My family puts up with quiche.

Excellent.  The only thing I didn't use was pie crust because I didn't have one and didn't feel like making it.  Just delicious.  I didn't use any spices, just fresh garlic when I cooked the zucchini.

This recipe is a keeper ! I also added 1/2 of an onion to the zucchini as it was sauteing as a few of the other had mentioned in their reviews. I think it added just the right flavor to the quiche. I was lazy and ran my zucchini through the kitchen aide slicer instead of hand slicing and was still pleased with the presentation.

I followed the recipe as is (with the exception of subbing milk for half and half) and wasn't too happy with the outcome, which was watery. It also took longer than 45 minutes, at least in my oven and I even upped the temp to 375! I would recommend cutting down on the cream/milk called for.

I LOVE this recipe.  Skip the mozzarella!  I've made it three times.  The first, I accidentally left out the mozzarella cheese.  the second I made it with and we all agreed it was better without.  By skipping the mozzarella, this quiche is fluffy, nicely zucchini flavored and light.

I had the girls over for breakfast and served this with a fruit salad.  I was a little afraid of serving zucchini for breakfast, but I needed something vegetarian and this fit the bill.  They LOVED it and both insisted on my giving them the recipe.  It wasn't as heavy as some cheese quiches can be, and it was very easy to make.  I cooked up the zucchini the night before, so all I had to do in the morning was assemble the quiche.  It was very ascetically pleasing when it came out of the oven.  I followed the recipe exactly for this first time, though I baked it 5-8 mins longer than the recipe to get it to firm up.  I think vidalia onions would be a great addition, and maybe a few tomato slices to the top to add color.

Yummy! I sliced white onion to saute with the zucchini, and I added bite sized pieces of crispy bacon before the mozzarella cheese. My husband has been raving about this.

Terrific recipe!  I made this and another quiche from this website, which incidentally was rated highly by more people, for a brunch with friends.  Everyone agreed that his was the best!  I made the recipe exactly as it is here, however, I cooked it a little longer - an hour.  Delicious!  I'll definitely make this again!

Simple and delicious. Followed the recipe exactly (except the paprika). Really loved the presentation with the arranged zucchinis on the top of the quiche. Wish I had thought to snap a photo. Used my mandolin slicer to get even slices. Used with frozen pie crust. (Has been awhile since I made it, but I think that I had leftover filling. Would have been better in my bigger pie plate with a rolled-out frozen dough instead of the pre-formed foil pie plate). Recommend this recipe.

Although I'm not a huge quiche fan, I thought this recipe was dead on.  The crust was baked perfectly, squash was not overdone, and the blend of flavors was wonderful.  I used a slightly different combination of yellow squash, sweet onion, diced prosciutto, and fresh garlic (all sauted before being combined with egg mixture).  This is a great option for a 'portable' breakfast...extremely easy to package and re-heat.

Very delicious. We added a bit of flour to fluff it out a bit and it turned out great. We had extra wet mix so wea re planning on making another.

Terrific! To make it lighter, I used whole milk instead of cream and lowfat ricotta cheese, and it still tasted incredibly rich.

I'm not a huge zucchini fan, but I loved this quiche.  Like the previous reviewer, I thought it was a bit on the salty side and will use less next time.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

Very good! I used shredded swiss in place of ricotta and had only one good sized zucchini. Very tasty.

Most positive comment I received from this recipe:  "Kinda tastes like pizza..."   Made this for Easter brunch.  None of my family cared for it, even me.  And I LOVE zucchini!  Not sure why...

This turned out very well. I used a Pillsbury previously frozen pie crust, baked as directed. In additon to the zucchini, I precooked about 8 oz sliced baby bellas and 1 slivered red pepper and 4 cloves finely diced garlic instead of powder. Layered these in too. I omitted the salt since I used salt in cooking the vegs.  I used about 20 leaves of fresh basil chiffonade in last layer. 
It took about an hour to cook. I needed to protect the pie crust edge with a little foil for the last 15 minutes. 
It turned out very well. Will make it again. thanks

This was really good and very easy, even with a homemade crust. The only thing I will change next time is the zucchini sizes, I think I'll either shred it into the quiche or cube it. My son is not fond of cooked veggies- this would be the only reason. Otherwise, this was very delicious!

It had a nice flavor.  I just cubed the zucchini, which may have been why it wasn't as good as what other reviews say.  I found the skin on the zucchini gave an unpleasant toughness to the quiche.  Next time I will either remove the skin or cut very thinnly!

A really great quiche!  I added garlic while simmering the zucchini which was a great choice.  Also topped with more mozzarella before adding the zucchini layers.

Wow.  Best quiche I've ever had.  I didn't have mozzarella so I used shredded colby jack, which I think was great, taste-wise (mozz is a little plain for me).  I did have to cook it a little longer than suggested (about 10 minutes) so it wouldn't be soggy, but I'm at high altitude so it's not all that surprising.

This is my first review on all recipes and I have been using this site for years. The reason I chose to finally review is that this is the first recipe that I chose to follow the recipe exactly. No variations and it delivered!! Took it to a Bridal Shower and it was devoured.

Enjoyed by all, even my 12 year old who claims to not like zucchini.  I spiraled the second layer of zucchini over the top, and my husband said it looked beautiful!  I used fresh herbs and only 1 cup of shredded cheese, which was plenty.  I also added chopped bell pepper and encourage trying other vege additions.  I will omit the paprika next time ~ the flavor clashed.  The ricotta is truly delicious in this.  Since this is such a rich quiche, I will probably save it for special occasions.

I made this for our Christmas morning brunch. I thought it was fantastic. The flavors are mild but in a very good way. It was fabulous with sliced fresh cantaloupe, lemon poppy muffins and fresh coffee. I deviated only in that I sauteed half a chopped yellow onion with my zucchini for extra flavor and while that helped, it still needs a bit more flavor so WHEN I make this quiche again, I'll be sure to spice it up with perhaps a bit more garlic / pepper and maybe even a dash of nutmeg. None the less every one asked for seconds (thank God I made two :)

I have made this exactly as written and have used it as a base and subbed different cheeses for the mozzarella and different veggies. My fav is using spinach, bacon and cheddar. The ricotta is a must, it makes it fluffy. I have also used heavy cream instead of half n half. Delicious!

I just made this tonight for some vegetarian friends, but I tweaked it a bit.  Instead of mozzarella and ricotta, I used a blend of sharp and white cheddar cheese (Sargento makes a blend that is already shredded).  I also sauteed garlic and 1 small diced onion in some olive oil (not butter) before adding the zucchini (about 3 medium sized - peeled and sliced).  And instead of using the herbs separately, I just used about 1 heaping teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  This all filled 2 (9 inch) pie crusts, so if each person eats 1/4, you have enough food for 8 people.  Served with a salad and it made a very filling meal.  Once I filled the pie crusts, I sprinkled a little more shredded cheese on top and then sprinkled some paprika to add color.  This was so good and incredibly easy to make.  Might try adding some pancetta to it next time.

It seems like this recipe is pretty flexible! I changed a lot, and the flavor came out great (very savory--not a breakfast quiche for me), even if the texture wasn't completely perfect (still good). I only had one zucchini, and I sauteed it with half an onion, one clove garlic, 2 tsp each of fresh basil and oregano. I used a combination of cheddar, goat cheese, parmesan, and mozzarella because I was cleaning out my fridge. I used an extra egg and milk instead of cream. I imagine you could reduce the amount of cheese.

I'll probably try to make this again sometime.  I followed the recipe as written, other than using whipping cream in place of half-and-half.  I took it out of the oven well past an hour and it was still runny.  I thought I must have done something wrong and microwaved a couple pieces which yielded a cheesy goo pile.  After we ate that, I put the remainder back in the oven and cooked another 20 minutes and now it's more like the pictures.  Amazing how cooking times vary.  Flavor was good.

Very good! Used cottage cheese instead of ricotta.

3.5 stars really. Made recipe exactly. Seemed bland or like it needed salt. It was good though. The "quiche" is not eggy like you stereotypically know quiche to be.

I loved this recipe, even though I forgot to add the mozzarella it was still yummy.  I definitely will make it again.
