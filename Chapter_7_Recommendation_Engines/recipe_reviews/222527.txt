Crème de cassis is a delicious and wonderful way to fancy up an ordinary glass of champagne. Ideal for brunch! Champagne can vary in sweetness or lack of depending on brand and type and the nice thing about adding Crème de cassis is you can do so to taste. Start with a little and adjust accordingly. Crème de cassis is a sweet, dark red syrupy liqueur made from blackcurrants. As with most things look for a quality brand, Dijon France is known for its cassis production ... it's like using imitation vanilla extract or 100% pure Madagascar vanilla extract, which would you prefer.

Many/most bars and restaurants that serve this drink add a small slice of lemon OR a couple of fresh raspberries to the glass after it is made.  Does makes a difference!

I spent some time in France and this is the go-to drink for sitting outside  and people watching. It adds nice color and taste to sparkling champagne.
