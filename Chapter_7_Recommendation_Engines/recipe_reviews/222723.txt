Basic buttercream frostings don't vary much in terms of ingredients;  butter and or shortening, powdered sugar, flavoring (usually vanilla) and liquid (usually milk).  Where they do vary is in the amounts of the ingredients, less or more fat, less or more powdered sugar, and so on. This recipe has those measurements nailed on all counts, and I particularly liked the combination of shortening and butter. (I happen to be in Naples now where it is Africa hot, so I needed the sturdier holding power of the shortening) I stuck to the measurements precisely, but fiddled with the flavoring slightly - a half teaspoon each of vanilla, almond extract and butter flavor and just a pinch of salt. There aren't too many buttercream frostings I like well enough to eat directly from the decorating bag (once finished with it of course) like this one!

I used this for a red velvet cake and took it to my son's for a cookout. I used butter flavored crisco for the shortening.It was fantastic. I will use this recipe from now on. Thanks for sharing

Yummy frosting! Great texture and I really like the flavor. This is a riff on a buttercream I make pretty frequently and the milk really helps the texture.

I could really taste the shortening at first. I added about 2 more tsp of van and let it sit at room temp for awhile and then mixed it again and it tasted better. Does harden up nicely so I will be using this batch to decorate the cake.

This is the first time I've made frosting, and I think I did pretty well. This recipe was simple and easy and oh so delicious. I did end up adding a little more milk than called for, and I also added almond extract because I love it. I used butter flavored shortening and it turned out perfectly. Will definitely do this again, so much better than store-bought frosting.

I found this recipe and made it exactly as written.  All I could taste was shortening. That's when I added more vanilla, lemon and even a vanilla bean to mask the shortening taste.  Not gonna' happen.  Now it tastes like sweet vanilla-lemon shortening.  Did I mention that it tastes like shortening?!

Followed the recipe exact EXCEPT I substituted the 5 cups of confection sugar and used  only 3 cups and two cups of powerded splenda to reduce the sugar for diabetic hubby. Turned out great. I mixed everything in a Kitchen Aid 4.5 mixer with wisk attachment. Easy as pie! Tastes absloutly wonderful. Thanks for the recipe. One on my favorites now. I used a 16 serving setting.   It Made enough to frost a two layer cake using a 9 in pie pan.

This is a great recipe!  I like sweet buttercream frosting, but most people do not.  I believe this fits the bill! I made a birthday cake that was shared with many people, some who do not care for sweets and they all declared this delicious!  It was just the perfect spreading consistency, too.

I love this recipe! The only thing is that the servings are very underestimated (of course, I am piping rather than spreading the frosting, if that makes a difference). Anyways, I adjusted the frosting to frost 24 cupcakes, and in the end I had enough frosting to frost 60! I'm not complaining, as now I don't have to make as big of a second batch, but be warned if you aren't making that many cupcakes!

This is a simple, creamy frosting that comes together in a flash - which is a good thing when you have a grandchild that's in a hurry to frost fresh-made cupcakes! Just made this today for an after-school treat in blue - we love our frosting in a different color every time we make it.  I use salted butter - the salty and sweet go together really well.

Fantastic frosting!  Better then out of a can any day.  We don't have shortening in Europe so I used all butter and my boys ate the frosting first, before the chocolate cake!!

Loved this recipe. Was the perfect amount to dirty ice a 9X13 layered cake. The ingredient amounts were spot on. This will be my go to from now on.

Used this recipe for my sons birthday cake.  Love it.  Not a big fan of buttercream, but this one is nice and smooth and not too sweet.  Very good.  Will use this recipe many many more times.

Awesome recipe!  Perfect ratio of all ingredients, excellent taste and consistency for spreading :)  Made more than enough to frost and fill two 9" cakes.  Everyone raved, thanks for submitting :)

Perfect consistency and flavour!  I halved the recipe and it was almost enough to frost two 8" round cakes (a touch more would have been preferable).  The whole recipe would have been far too much.

I followed the recipe exactly and felt that there was too much icing sugar - next time I will try 3-4 cups. The icing became too stiff and hard to work with. I also tasted it and I'm sure my tooth cried a little as to how sweet it was!

Really a good buttercream recipe. I usually mix alcohol in because I make boozy cakes. When I use alcohol I don’t use milk in the recipe.

I used all butter no shortening and a tad bit more vanilla and since i only had fat free milk I used Duncan Doughnuts extra extra cream but only 3 tablespoons. It was fluffy and delicious!

We loved this frosting. I made this frosting and frosted a cake. I used all butter because I'm allergic to shortening.  I also beat the frosting for about 7-8 minutes. I did use  a half teaspoon each of vanilla, almond extract and butter flavor and just a pinch of salt as suggested by Naples.

The recipe as is needs some work as far as flavor goes, it really tastes like a hint of butter and lots of shortening.  It would be better with butter flavored crisco,  or butter flavoring added. I didn't have any so I used extra vanilla and some almond extract which helped a TON! I needed something I could  do a bit of decorating with,  so I needed the shortening,  but would not use this as a frosting to just frost a cake. It was ok... I'll keep looking for my keeper recipe.

It doesn't get any better than this especially for Christmas cookies. You can't go wrong with this recipe and your friends and family will request for years to come!

I made this for the chocolate cake in one bowl 1 and especially for this cake it was perfect. i added another tablespoon so it would spread easier without tearing the cake top but still keeping the integrity of the consistancy. I also added a big pinch of salt l. which helped cut down on the super sweetness.

The recipe was a little hard to understand as you go through it, but it could be because I tweaked it a bit. I had frozen so I melted it down and started with that, but as I added the sugar, it turned into fondant, tot he point that I had to take it from the bowl and kneed it like bread dough. I needed to use 2 tablespoons more of milk, but it turned out amazingly good. It wasn’t sickly sweet, but thick and creamy and smooth to apply to cake!! Over all, I recommend this recipe!!

Great recipe, but like most people, I made a couple of changes. I used 4 generous cups of the powdered sugar, and I added 1 and 1 /2 teaspoons of butter extract, and used heavy cream and water instead of milk (4 or 5 teaspoons of the cream and 1 teaspoon of water--you'll have to gradually add the cream to get the consistency that you want, possibly adding more, but I wouldn't add additional water). It tasted wonderful. I haven't tried decorating with it yet, but I did use it to spread on a cake.

11.06.16 ~ Delicious frosting! I love a good frosting and this one is very, very good. It has a great consistency and a great flavor. I used cherry juice in place of the milk as I wanted a pink frosting. I used the frosting on 'White Almond Wedding Cake' from AR. It is my favorite cake from this site and this was an excellent frosting choice.

This is a perfect recipe. First time making buttercream frosting. I want sure about the shortening so I used all butter instead. My family loved it. I used it frost a boxed 13x9 cake and there was plenty left over. I would definitely bake a 2 layer next time. I had so much frosting that it almost was too much that I used on the 13x9 cake. Consistency was great (added like half a teaspoon more milk), and flavor was amazing. I am definitely saving this recipe. Made it with my 4 year old and she wanted color added to it. Hence the lavender look.

I made this recipe and it was fantastic! The family loved it! I just added an extra half teaspoon of vanilla, because I  wanted stronger vanilla flavor. A great base frosting, that can be adapted easily to other flavors. Definitely will make this again!

Made only 1/2 recipe but used 1tsp. Vanilla flavoring and used
1/2 tsp. Almond flavoring too.   I added about 3 Tbs. milk also. I used it to ice a King Cake and it was delicious!

I've made a lot of frostings, this might be my new favorite!! Most buttercreams made with shortening are pretty greasy, this was not the case here. Sweet, thick, smooth and seemed to hold shape well. The real taste will be how it does here in Florida in July! ??

The only change I made was to use all butter instead of shortening. This icing is sweet, but it's icing- it's supposed to be sweet! This recipe made EXACTLY enough to ice an 8 inch double layer cake. It went on smoothly, looked pretty, and tasted great. As a novice baker I really appreciate when things are as easy and turn out as well as this buttercream icing has for me. Thank you!

Rather greasy. I needed to doctor it up with more powdered sugar and milk.

I made this exactly as written. It looked pretty and was easy to work with, but it didn't taste very good. I won't make it again.

Our favorite frosting. As a personal preference, I add an additional 1 1/2 tsp of coconut extract, too.

FANTASTIC!! I used butter flavored shortening and added 1T lemon juice (went over a lemon cake). I couldn't stop licking my fingers!!!
