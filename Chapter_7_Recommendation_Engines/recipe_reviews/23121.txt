I really enjoyed this recipe. I used one large bell pepper instead of two and it was plenty. I served it over brown rice, which worked beautifully.  I had never had peanuts in a soup or stew before, and was plesantly surprised! I will definitely be making this one again.

This was OK, it would be better if more things were added, like maybe carrots, celery, and a ton of salt. Will try again with modifications.

The smell was amazing. The first taste was "interesting".. by the second taste I could appreciate the flavors, but missed protein. Having had fried egg and tomato in China I decided to add egg into the mixtue and viola the end product was surprisingly very good.

I liked the crunch and earthiness the peanuts added! I used only red onions and five roma tomatoes. I wish I'd used more roma tomatoes, maybe up to eight. I didn't find this bland at all. In order to make the soup more visually appealing, I pureed it. So easy! I didn't do the simmering over thirty minutes. I almost wish I did. I can't imagine how good it'd be.

Huh, this was an interesting recipe.  I felt it would have been better without the peanuts and much less water.  Doesn't look appetizing and very bland.  If I made again, I would definitely add more spices and I did this time around and leave out the peanuts.
