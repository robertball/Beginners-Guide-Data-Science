When I first read this recipe I thought to myself, "What? No potatoes?"  As a new vegan I find it important that meals are as hearty and satisfying as possible.  So, with such a promising start, I eagerly set to work in the kitchen.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly except after sauteeing all the veggies I added 2 cups veggie broth along w/ th potatoes and simmered that until they were fork tender.  I then added 1 cup frozen corn and 1 can cream style corn and the rest of the spices.  (I however, did not add the garlic clove.)  It was delicious! 5*****'s after changes.

Not bad.  Spices are well blended.  I did do something differently.  I added more corn, (because it didn't look like there was enough for my tastes) and I used vegetable base instead of boullion.  My soup never did thicken up so I used a trick my hubby learned in culinary art school.  I added 1/2 cup of mashed potato flakes.  Not bad.  Good on a cold day like this.

I try to follow recipes but it's so hard to do as I'm told. I added broccoli and cauliflower chopped very small at the same time as the carrots. Then I diced 2 red potatoes, cooked them separately and blended them slightly before adding them. As far as spices are concerned, I added some cayenne and bay leaves plus a dash or two of red wine vinegar for balance. The result was very very yummy and I didn't really need flour thanks to the potatoes. My b/f and I are veggie so I'll add some good bread and wine; It's dinner!

Absolutely amazing!! I'm not a Vegan, but was invited on a "fast" with my church that prohibited foods that weren't on a Vegan diet. It was really hard, but this recipe really squashed a lot of those cravings I had for other foods. I used soy milk, and unless I were to taste chowders side by side, I could NOT tell that it used soy milk (and I don't even LIKE soy milk!). I strongly recommend this recipe to anyone, Vegan or not.

This recipe was really great especially considering how low calorie it is.  I changed the veggies according to our tastes, left out the celery and added red bell pepper mushrooms and sweet potatoes. The one thing that nobody liked was the amount of black pepper. Next time I will use half or even a quarter the amount and let each person add pepper according to their own tastes. I also added a little potato flakes at the end to thicken it up.

This was a great recipe! I ended up adding more flour until I reached the desired consistancy and added a can of cream corn. Also, I added bay leaves and two medium sized potatoes. Was the most delicious corn chowder I have ever tasted and the fact that I used soy milk made it all the better! Definitely a keeper

This recipe is amazing! I did make a couple of changes: one extra tablespoon of flour and one less cup of water.  It tastes wonderful!

Not bad with added potato, potato flakes (to thicken), fresh chopped jalapeno, cayenne, worchestire sauce, and extra garlic & corn. I also blended the soup slightly.

This was so yummy! I've just became vegan about a month ago and I'm pretty much dragging my family along and this was something everyone enjoyed. When I make it again I will probably use less pepper, because it was quite spicy.

I loved this recipe.  It was so yummy!  My husband liked it too.  I found it a bit watery but when I make it again, will just add a little less. A great starter or main dish.

Only OK. Not a strong corn flavor at all, the dominant flavor is garlic.  If I don't find a better recipe, next time I'll cut the garlic powder.

The pepper burn in this chowder is so bad that my lips are still hurting from the last bite and my eyes have tears in the corners. If you don't want to have people running for the faucet, reduce the black pepper amount by at least half.  Also, definitely add potatoes like others suggested because it needs the bulk to feel more like a chowder than just a creamy vegetable soup. Finally, I just want to mention that it took about twice as much flower to get it to thicken up (again, like a chowder) so keep that in mind before you add the second cup of soy milk or extra water to cook the veggies.

We liked this overall, but my wife and I both thought there was too much pepper. Next time I make it, will try 1/2 tsp instead of 1 tsp. Also, after reading the ingredients of the vegetable bouillon cubes (sky high sodium and MSG to boot) I will probably substitute veg. broth for the water, and not use the cubes.
The flour didn't have much of a thickening effect, so will try 2 tbsp. next time. I also used a stick blender to puree some of the soup for a creamier base.

I've never had chowder before, and this was very yummy!!  I only did half a small onion b/c I usually hate onions (for that matter I usually hate carrots, too, but I can usually handle both in soups).  I used cow milk instead of soy since I cannot have soy due to my epilepsy.  I put in only a half tsp. salt and a half tsp. pepper, and it was still too peppery for my liking.  I also found the salt a little unnecessary simply b/c there is so much sodium in bouillon.  But I would definitely make it again; I would just do even less salt & pepper.  I did add a little extra flour to thicken it, as well as I just put a lid on it and let it simmer till thick, stirring occasionally, instead of stirring it constantly.  I would've considered adding potatoes but I have a very limited diet and eat potatoes all the time so enjoyed this tater-free dish as a change!  Thank-you!

I added potatoes as some other reviewers suggested.  I think next time I'll chop the veggies a lil smaller and once they're tender, pulse them in the food processor to make it thicker, and then add the corn.    I've never had corn chowder before, and I found this really yummy!  One of my new favorites!

Fantastic! I added a small sweet potato just to make it a little heartier. I had to use ricemilk, due to allergies, and it still came out creamy. Have already made it twice!

Pretty good!  It's a recipe you'll want to fiddle with to make to your tastes.  I've added/substituted in various combinations: cayenne, paprika, chili flakes, dried chives, garlic chives, extra garlic, bell peppers, fresh spinach, celery salt, milk or evaporated milk and butter (not always vegan).  Try finishing with Sriracha and cilantro.

Try adding some prepared rice if you don't want it to be so corn-y.  I made some homemade croutons with stale bread and those were AMAZING.  

As a half-time vegan, I LOVED substituting part of the soy milk for coconut milk.  Hides that chalky flavor.

Awesome recipe! I made a few changes and it turned out great.  I used 3 cups veggie broth instead of water and bouillion, added 1 can creamed corn with no added salt in addition to 1 ear fresh corn, added 1 chopped zucchini, 2 small red potatoes and instead of flour used about 1 cup of instant mashed potatoes.  It came out thick and creamy. Yum!

Like the other reviewers have said, this is a good base recipe, and a few embellishments to your taste will knock it out of the park. I added 2 potatoes (bit more water needed to cook), 3 tbsp diced red bell pepper, a small can of green chiles; and cumin, paprika & cayenne for spice. Might try throwing in a few mushrooms next time too.

Overall, I really liked this chowder.  I did make a couple changes per other reviewers suggestions, and would make a change or so myself after making it.  One, I added a cup of creamed corn to the other corn, and would do that again.  Two, I added some arrowroot powder in addition to the flour to help thicken it up.  Also, I used almond milk instead of soy and it came out just fine. In addition I just did salt/pepper and garlic powder to taste and no garlic clove. And oh yeah, I used veg. broth 2 1/2 cups...and I added about one large potato.    Here are the changes I would make next time.  I thought it tasted pretty strongly of carrots, so I would halve them or omit. I might also add a little soy creamer to add some more body.  Other than that, its great.  Definitely add potatoes though, they really make the dish hearty enough for a meal!

It's a beautiful soup.  I creamed a lot of the veggies in there after cooking (we think it improves the flavor).  I added a fresh jalapeno and a potato.  Doubled the garlic (don't you just hate people like me????  rating a recipe they changed....I get it....but....)  I would make this again in a healthy heartbeat (don't you hate people like me who think they're funny?  lol)

Loved the soup with an additional ingredient. I added roasted long green chiles diced up and it really kicked it up. We really enjoy this soup on a cold night. Very comforting.

It was pretty darned good. I also found I had to add more flour until the desired consistency was reached, but I accidentally added too much, so I put in 1.5 oz of bourbon to thin it back out--the perfect finisher. If you're not a hella vegan, try adding 1.5 oz of bacon-infused bourbon. Super nice!

This was delicious!  I'm always up for trying new things and this was perfect!  Stirred the flour into a little water then poured into the soup just to be safe.  Thanks!

Made quite a few modifications after reading the soup doesn't thicken so well and that there might not be enough corn.  First, I used 2 cans of corn and 1 can of creamed corn.  I only used 2 cups of water and 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk.  I needed 2 T of flour in order to thicken in. Omitted the pepper and garlic powder (used a tad more real garlic instead).  Was ok, but I'll look for a different recipe to try next time - definitely think potatoes would make a great addition!

oh em gee.....this is the BEST soup I've ever had in my entire life!! The ONLY alteration I made was to add 1/4 barley because I needed to use it up. My husband was very surprised when I told him it was all vegan--he's as much a carnivore as a T-REX!

Very Good! I made it GLUTEN FREE and VEGAN by replacing the soy milk with Mimic Creme! It is a great replacement for any creme soups! It did the trick! :) Also I took my wand blender and pulsed it some to make it more creamy.

I went to a vegan potluck pre-Thanksgiving dinner today, and this was a huge hit.  I did make a couple of changes though:  1. I added potatoes.  2. I love garlic, so I actually added 5 small cloves in lieu of the garlic powder.  3.  I don't like the idea of adding flour to the soup because it could cause clumping, so instead I made a roux in a separate sauce pan (the one I sauteed the veggies in), and then I added that to the soup. 4. Finally, I let the soup slowly cook and simmer for close to an hour while stirring frequently.

Very delicious.  I added broccoli, (just because I wanted to use up what was in my fridge) I added twice as much celery and carrot, 5 cloves of garlic, and used 1/2 can of coconut milk, and about 3/4 cup of buttermilk instead of the 2 cups of soy milk.  Also added potatos that I boiled and cubed.  The whole family loved it.

Awesome.  Way better than I thought it would be.  Might add more corn in the future, maybe good with potatoes.  Great for those on a a budget, made a batch for about $5

Very tasty. I found when I went to make it tahat I only had vanilla soy milk, so I just used regular milk and it was great. I didn't bother with two separate pans, but just sauteed the vegetables in the pot that I made the soup in. Also, I used my immersion blender at the end to blend some of the ingredients, which thickened the soup nicely. Thanks!

Mine never thickened and so was more a thin soup than a chowder, but it was very, very good. I only used 1 1/2 cups of corn because that was all I had and it still came out tasting very much like corn (other reviewers have complained that there was not enough corn taste) - I just halved the spices. I also thought there was a bit too much oil. Very good for a cold day or a plain old cold. :)

It was a little too spicy, so I'd halve the salt & pepper. Add more carrots or celery for substance, plus one box frozen kale and cubed tofu. I used skim milk and added a scoop of soy protein and ground flaxseed for a nutritional boost.

This was a great recipe. I substituted the almond milk with canned coconut milk to make it creamier. Wasn't disappointed. Made it twice in the past month.

I'm really liking the flavor.  I did not make it vegan though (reg whole milk and chicken broth).  I also followed other's advice and added bay leaves and sub'd potato flakes for the flour.  I also added white wine after sauteeing the veggies.  I know it's not really a fair assessment of the original recipe, but this was very good as I'm sure the original was.

I loved this recipe.  I made it exactly as is written; however, it didn't thicken up like I wanted it to, so I added arrowroot which really does the trick.  Also, added a tablespoon of maple syrup as was suggested in another recipe I read.  It'd delicious and with the addition of arrowroot, gluten free.  Thanks for sharing this.

As I was making this recipe I told my husband "way too much trouble", but when I tasted it, it was very good.  It did not thicken to my taste so I did end up adding another tablespoon of flour PLUS 2 teaspoons of cornstarch dissolved in water.  I also used only 2 cups of water and cut down on both the salt and pepper since the bouillon was salty.  The flavor again, very good.  The prep work was, in my opinion, too much.

Very good.  Since I am not vegan, I used chicken bouillon and skim milk (not soy).  For the corn, I used frozen white corn and a part of a bag of mixed veggies.  I blended a portion as well to thicken it, and that worked very well.  It didn't thicken up as much as I'd like despite using two tablespoons of flour, but it was still very tasty and surprisingly filling.  I will definitely make this again, the boyfriend loved it.

this is so yummy! i'm not vegan, but my boyfriend is and we both loved this!  i followed the recipe exactly, but used 3 cans of corn with water.  i just dumped 2 cans into the water and then i pulsed the third can in the food processor before adding it. It really thickened up the soup while adding even more corn flavor.

I made it this with cashew milk instead of soy milk. Turned ok I added instant potatoes to thicken it and added more corn as well. I’m going to let it sit for a while and see if the flavor intense some. If not I will not be making this again.

Delicious! I added kale to mine! And used unsweetened almond milk because I had it on hand. I also added chunks of red potatoes that I previously boiled. (My hubby just always wants potatoes haha)

Next time I will try unsweetened soy milk.  It was a little sweet and I want to see if that makes it more savory.  This is a great recipe!

As everyone has stated, this is a good VEGAN corn chowder. I also made changes per other reviews I used 4 small red potatoes (peeled and loosely mashed), broccoli, and grated ginger. I added only 2c water, 1 1/2 soy milk, extra corn and celery. I did not add any salt or pepper.  It was very good, thanks!

Very tasty! Changes: added 2 chopped potatoes that I sautéed first then a quick mash for starch, this allowed me to omit the flour. I used a cup of coconut cream and a cup of almond milk in place of soy milk. This made it super creamy! I also used 2 c frozen corn and one can corn. Perfection! Will make again.

Instead of boulion powder  I used Campbell's mushroom stock. With twice as much salt and garlic powder to cut the sweetness of the soy milk, this is a great chowder! I'm definitely making it again (and not telling the hubby that it's vegan!).

Like others I added potatoes and creamed corn. Didn't add salt, parsley, or garlic. Also, since I used the can of cream of corn I only added half the amount of soy milk that the recipe called for. I had planned to add the garlic, parsley and salt but I tasted it and it was great without so I only added the fresh ground pepper. Always looking for vegan recipes that my growing children can enjoy. Thank you!

We're vegetarian more than vegan, so used regular milk instead of soy. Other than that, followed Mrs. Dalton's tip of putting potatoes, boiled and mashed - perfect!

Thought the flavor profile was very good… I added potatoes to mine and used my own homemade vegetable broth. I did find it a little thin & will probably add 2 tablespoons of flour the next time I make it… Otherwise great!

Great recipe! I added a few things to make it heartier. I added 2 cubed potatoes, and later added 1 mashed potato at the end to thicken up the soup. I added 1/2 tsp thyme, 3 tbsp butter, and 1 tsp cornstarch. I also reduced the water to just 2 cups. Very delicious and I will make this again. Thank you for the recipe!

I loved this recipe, but made a few changes, based on reviews I read. 

Used vegetable broth instead of water and the bouillon cubes. 
I added two red potatoes, diced, you could probably add three. Put them in the broth while its coming to a boil. 
I only used half a larger onion, and cut out garlic powder. Added just a pinch more of the flour, because mine didn't seem to be thickening. 

All in all, delicious! And the leftover are even better :)

Loved this recipe so much!  I did add potatoes because that's what I felt like eating in the chowder, and omitted the celery because I didn't have any, and this recipe was SO delicious!  I have made it quite  few times since, it's very filling.

Too much pepper!! Wrecked it for us. UPDATE:  I googled how to fix the "too much pepper" issue, and lemon juice seemed to be the common theme.  So I went for it  and added maybe two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice -- and it worked!! Took the peppery spice/heat out and I could actually taste the chowder -- which turns out to be very good. So I'm editing my review to 4 stars from 2. The lemon juice saved the day, and it didn't even make the soup lemony.  Cut the pepper, and you're in for a treat.

I have made this a couple of times and I have to say I love it. It tastes so amazing and is fulfilling, which is something that  I battle to find in a lot of vegan dishes. There were several changes I made to the recipe to make it more delicious for my taste, but on the whole it is a great dish to make.

Very tasty as it is. I once tried substituting soy milk with heavy cream, using  less cellery and omitting garlic. As a result my 4-year-old liked it more.

Delicious.... but I did alter it. I added potatoes, and spinach in addition to the other ingredients. Substituted the soy milk for almond milk. Omitted the flour and used a can of coconut milk, and almonds blended for a cream base. Added turmeric, paprika and curry.

As pretty much everyone else commented, the base recipe is good, but by itself not my favorite.  Chopping the veggies smaller might help, and for me, I added a pinch of thyme and blended half the soup as someone else recommended, as well as adding about double as much flour.

The chowder itself was good but 1 teaspoon of pepper was way too much. I would love to make this recipe again with just a pinch of pepper. It was too spicy for my kids to eat. I will also add potatoes next time as well.

This was super tasty! I used unsweetened almond milk instead of soy milk and I also added 2 tbsp butter to cut the pepper (there was a bit too much pepper for my liking). I also used 1 can kernel corn and 1 can of creamed corn instead of ears as it was what I had on hand. Next time I will add potatoes for more heartiness.

I used more than a tablespoon of corn starch to thicken. I think using potatoes will also thicken the soup. Instead of celery, I used frozen broccoli which I prefer. I kept the heat @ medium while thickening as it took too long in low heat and standing by the stove to constantly stir is hard on the legs! I added more salt to taste. I will take it to church potluck; curious if it will be a "winner."

when i added the first cup of soymilk to the vegetables it curdled on the top and i thought it was ruined but i saved it by making a white sauce with the remaining cup of soymilk. then i mixed them together and it combined beautifully. I omitted the garlic powder and added potatos, as suggested in the reviews. it turned out really delicious with the slight recipe change. next time i will definitely make a separate white sauce and add it when the veges are cooked. awesome recipe. thanks

I followed the recipe and it was a bit watery, not too creamy. So, I added a can of corn and added 4 small cooked potatoes. Then, I blended half the soup and added it back into the pot. It was good after the changes. I definitely recommend adding potatoes.

A good base for vegan corn chowder; I made mine gluten-free.

I made several adjustments:  
1) I doubled the amount of corn.
2) I cut the raw kernels from the corn cobs, then brought water and cobs to a boil while I choppped up the other veggies.  Essentially, that makes a corn broth and helps sweeten the the soup--that's where I took my 2 1/2 cups water for the soup.  I took out the corn cobs before I added the water to the veggies!
3) I added 2 small potatoes, finely chopped, to the celery and onion skillet mix.  Because I didn't use the flour, I needed something else to thicken the soup--finely chopped potatoes worked great (a 1/4 c. of instant mashed potatoes would work, too)
4) I garnished with fresh cilantro and sliced green onions.

I would make it again if I had many ears of corn to use up--not sure it would be as good with frozen corn.

Loved this.  I took the suggestions from some of the other reviewers and made a couple modifications.  I added 1/2 red pepper, about 1 C mushrooms (both chopped), 2 more cups of corn, 2 more cups of water.  I used vegetable base rather than bouillon (and more of it since I added more water) and used mashed potato flakes instead of flour.  It wasn't SUPER thick like some chowders but it was thick enough for my taste.  I served this to a chowder loving, non-vegan friend of mine and she loved it too!  Very very good - and easy!

This recipe is terrific!  I have made this twice and it came out great both times.  I prefer it with vegetable stock instead of the boullion.  Also, make sure to use soy milk that does not contain vanilla unless you want sweet tasting chowder.  A great addition (for extra flavor) to this was to add some finely chopped sauteed mushrooms.

This was very good.  Not incredible but worth making.  We followed the recipe to the T and it was way too salty!  Next time we will do half the salt and or all the spices.

I really did like this chowder. I made enough to feed 100 people for an event.   Some of the kids at the event didn't like it because it was too peppery. I loved it though! Some of the adults did too. No potatoes needed!

Pretty good, I think next time though I will use creamed corn along with real corn. Also, I used an olive oil margarine blend instead of oil and flour & started with a rue. then added aromatics and followed from there. Others might want to try that since they said things about it not being thick enough. I also used 2 red potatos and 2 extra garlic cloves. I can never follow directions, lol. I had the recipe & ingredients on front of me. Force of habit, I guess I felt like I was about to make a bisque. Either way, awesome and great new soup we'll be making. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious, flavour-full, simple and easy. I made this as written, adding a bay leaf and 6 baby potatoes in with the carrots and half-blending the final result with my immersion blender to make it into more of a chowder than a soup. My husband, who is allergic to dairy and not had a "cream of" soup in over a decade, raved and asked for it to become a regular. Great results for very little effort.

A yummy, hearty, vegan soup!  

4 stars because I changed a few things.  Used Earth Balance Spread instead of olive oil for a more buttery flavor.  Added a can of cream style corn at the end to enhance the corn flavor.  I can't have chowder without potato...so I added about 2 cups, boiled.  

Will definitely be making this all fall/winter!

I did make a few small changes-mushrooms for celery and half the salt and pepper, but otherwise everything else was the same. This was very quick and easy and delicious. Both of my boys (1yr and 3yrs) loved it!

3. 4 cloves garlic
4. cut garlic powder to 1/2 tsp
5. cut salt to 1/4 tsp of 1/4 tsp garlic salt

way better than i expected. i thought, however, that i'd be more creamy, but it didn't matter to me after i tasted it. i'm sure a tad bit more milk and/or flour would solve that.

next time i think i might try a bit more vegetables to the mixture. i definitely ended up with more soup(broth) than i did vegetables.

my wife liked it. so, i'll definitely be making this again.

As a recent convert to the Vegan lifestyle it has not been easy to replace many of the comfort foods that I was raised on.  Corn Chowder (or Chowda in my house) has always been a favorite of mine and this recipe is wonderful.  My non-vegan family members ate it up and were shocked to see me doing the same . . . they were surprised to find that it was animal friendly!! Thanks for this!!

This was okay, but I wasn't crazy about it. Didn't have the corn chowder flavour I was craving; pretty much just tastes like garlic and not much else. It's a decent soup but I'm still looking for a good corn chowder.

Amazingly good. I did change the recipe a bit though. I used less water (about a cup and a 3/4) and used corn flour instead of regular (added a tablespoon more or so of that as well). I also cooked it in a crock pot, towards the last hour (cooked it on high for 6) I added some instant potato flakes, as I found it too watery. I also added some more spices at that time. In the end a pretty simple recipe, but amazing results.

Tried this out, and based on the reviews, I cut the water down a bit, and added more flour. I also added potatoes in an attempt at creamy, but the result was more like corn soup. I also used rice milk instead of soy, so next time, I'll cut the water some more, and mash up the potatoes to get the creamy. However, this tasted fantastic, so there WILL be a next time.

Absolutely wonderful.  I had to add a bit more flour though, as it would have been a little thin otherwise.  Delicious, will definitely make again.
