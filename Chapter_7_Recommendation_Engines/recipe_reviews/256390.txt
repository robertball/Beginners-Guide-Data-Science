This came out pretty good! I sprinkled some cheese on top and was surprised I didn't miss the meat. I used 2 green peppers because I didn't have a red. I knew we would like a little more spice than what this recipe called for, so I doubled the chili powder and used hot chili beans. Also, for the tomatoes, I used all fresh from the garden instead of canned. I threw all the ingredients in the crock pot and set on high for 4 hours--perfect.
