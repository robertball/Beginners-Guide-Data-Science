This was wonderful!  I made a few changes for personal preference: we like very thick soups, so I doubled the flour & butter mixture.  I also cooked the roux for about 2 minutes, stirring the whole time, because most of my other recipes using a roux call for that before adding the milk.  I also substituted a full one-pound can of refrigerated claw crabmeat, because it's what I had on hand. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good starting point but I felt it needed more so I added some soy sauce, a small can of corn, onion powder, old bay and seasoned salt (took some ideas from other recipes on this site).  And it turned out really good.  I also increased the roux because we like our soup more like chowder.

This soup was very good.   Next time I would add
fresh crab instead of the canned crabmeat.  I also
added 1 cup of elbow pasta, just to make it a little chunky.  It was great.  Celia

This was good, but I though it was missing something.  I even added a little touch of Old Bay seasoning.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  I followed it to the letter but the cheese separated and the consistancy was all wrong.  I had to add more hot sauce just to get a flavor out of this.  Probably wont make this one again.

Absolutely delicious... Perfect for a rainy evening with some classic 1940's films.

This was very quick and easy to make. I added added extra ingredients, corn, celery etc. I used Swiss cheese as it adds to the flavor and would recommend more than just a dash of hot sauce (preferably with good flavor). It is a good recipe and very easy but I would recommend “spicing it up” a bit, to get more flavor.

Tasted good, but it took a LONG time to thicken.
