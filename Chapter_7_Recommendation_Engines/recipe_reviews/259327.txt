This was excellent as written. I searched high and low but could not find broccolini but broccoli worked just fine.

Rating is for the potatoes and Broccolini.  The Veggies came out perfectly and were a huge hit.  The potatoes were tender with crisp grill marks while the  Broccolini finished perfectly with bit of char and hint of lemon!  Bravo!!!
