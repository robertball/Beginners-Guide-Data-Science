I really liked this. A lot creamier than the one I made with evaporated milk rather than heavy whipping cream. I left out the eggs only because I have never used them in any Irish Cream recipe I have made in the past. Very good.

This is the best recipe for Irish Cream.  And, Ron Luft, you're SO over-the-top dramatic!  If you don't like almond extract, why did you add it?!  That's on YOU--NOT this fine recipe.

I've made Irish cream from allrecipes b4 that also asked for almond extract and also didn't like it. just don't add the almond extract and your fine. no need to throw the baby out with the bath water, it can be quite tasty.

What the heck is that almond extract taste doing in there? I followed the recipe to the letter and ended up wasting all the ingredients as I had to flush the finished product down the drain, what a disappointment! Save your money and buy the real thing, drink half as much and the cost will end up the same and you will actually enjoy it rather than kidding yourself into thinking going on the cheap is a wise alternative.
