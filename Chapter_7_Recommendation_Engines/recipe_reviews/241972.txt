So love this recipe for meatballs....delicious!!!  Only thing I did different was I added a tbsp of Italian seasoning to the meatballs & I made my own pasta sauce instead of Ragu but overall I give 5 stars on just the meatball recipe itself

I made these tonight with a couple of changes. I sautéed an onion and the minced garlic in a little olive oil.  I added them to the meatball mixture with basil, oregano, salt and pepper.  I am also not a fan of Ragu so I used my favorite sauce.  The mozzarella cheese really makes the meatball.  I will definitely make them again!

Thank you so much for this recipe!  It is easy and delicious and I had almost all of the ingredients on hand.  The mozarella that I had was not good, so I used parmesan in its place.  I also used barilla marinara sauce because that is what I had.  I also added salt and pepper to the meat mixture.

Lacked taste.  I had to add onions, grated cheese, oregano and an extra clove.  The first time, I made it was with Rao's Marinara sauce b/c I was too lazy to make my own and the 2nd x, I made it with my homemade sauce.  The 2x was the best.  I think I'll keep my own recipe.

Absolutely delicious.  Used Longo's Pasata sauce and added my own puree of steamed veggies to give the pasta a lot of flavour.  Pinch of sugar and salt.  The meatballs are delicious!

This is great simple and easy recipe but its much better if you make you own sauce! This recipe is great for beginners and leaves enough room for you to experiment!

I added a little more garlic and Italian seasoning and some onion powder.  I used my own sauce too.  However, this was the one meatball that I actually liked.  I made them for my family because they love spaghetti and meatballs...me not so much.  These were very good.  Yum Yum.  I had this with a beautiful salad on the table in 40 minutes.

Pretty good meatballs. I'll have to try using them with a different sauce when I find a recipe I really like. Nothing against Ragu, I just like to make sauces from scratch.

I selected this recipe because I liked how there was mozzarella in the meatballs. I think it added a nice taste. When I made these they turned out kind of odd shaped but tasted very good. One thing I would changes is I decreased the amount of breadcrumbs used only by a little bit. Depending on how dry you want your meatballs I would also recommend  to decrease the amount of breadcrumbs used. Overall I really enjoyed this recipe.

Great way to cook meatballs and tasty too.  We did add a little bit of chopped onion to the meat, along with some black pepper.  Good dinner.

Love this recipe! I'm not the best cook so I always need to follow a recipe... Needless to say this one was very easy! I change a couple of things and added salt, black pepper and a pinch of cayenne pepper. To the sauce I added a little bit of diced red onion and basil and it turned out great! I recommend this for small get  togethers or if you have a family over; quick and delicious.

Very good recipe!  I thought it needed more Italian seasoning, so I added too much!  But the meatballs are so delicious!

My favorite sauce is Francesco Rinaldi.  All natural, no preservatives.  The only additive in the sauce that  I don't like is soybean oil, but there aren't too many that don't use that in everything!
