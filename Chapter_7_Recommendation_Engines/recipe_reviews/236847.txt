This are really good and fun! I used a 12-cup cupcake pan. Even following the recipe, there was too much mixture to make only 6.  The mixture filled 8 of the cups. I assume a 6-cup muffin tin has larger cups (like jumbo muffins) than my 12-cup pan.  I ended up putting the mashed potatoes on the side (with gravy). My young grandbaby doesn't like her food to "touch" anything else on her plate so I thought the potatoes on the side would be best for her. Unfortunately, she had seen me add the onions and green pepper to the mixture while she was doing her homework so she pretty much nixed them before they were even on the table. Although these did not please the picky child, the rest of us enjoyed them very much! I received repeated compliments on these meatloaf cupcakes. I will definitely make them again. I will probably double the recipe and freeze the leftovers for a future meal. Thanks for the recipe, matykada!

The meatloaf was EXCELLENT but the sauce was lacking.  It was so overly sweet and lacking any balance.  I added 1/2 tsp soy sauce, 1/2 tsp roasted garlic powder, 1/4 tsp black pepper, and 1/4 tsp seasoned salt.  Next time I'll cut the sugar way back, at least in half if not more.  I would recommend using thicker potatoes for this as I tried to be lazy with instant potatoes and they never really set up on top of the "cupcake."

Loved them. To deal with Angela's problem; I put the mashed potatoes in a pastry bag and used the largest tip I had. A little finely shredded Wisconsin sharp cheddar on the top and you have a tasty and nice looking meal. Oh, and with 4 grandsons...ya gotta use a 12 cup muffin tin and double the recipe. (;o)

We had this today (April Fool's Day) at my Bible Study. Thought we were having cupcakes. They were decorated with Turquoise Icing (she used food coloring in the potatoes). Friend who made them just smiled until we tasted them. What a surprise. And they were delicious! I couldn't wait to get home and find the recipe for myself. Thank you so much Karen for this unique recipe.

This was very good, fairly easy, and the kids loved it. I made it as is, except I changed the sauce. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup ketchup, and 4 tsp of apple cider vinegar. That cuts some of the sweetness others were complaining about.  You can also use balsamic vinegar which gives it more of a barbeque sauce flavor.

I have a really picky eater at home. Four of them actually. My girls didn't want me to make meatloaf until I found this recipe. My son ate it without arguing. Hubby was the first one to eat when he hardly eats at home. This was just awesome. Used extra large cupcake loners, and was able to make seven. Very big. Very good.

I altered the recipe by using salt free crackers and adding salt to taste. I believe salt is a very personal choice mostly because of health issues. Great recipe and fun to make with my granddaughter

I made a double batch because I had a 12 cup cupcake pan.  I had enough left over to make a whole meatloaf in a loaf pan for later this week.  I used Cheez Its instead of saltines because I didn't have any saltines.  I also read some other reviews that said the sauce was too sweet with the ketchup and brown sugar, so I used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce.  I topped with Idahoan Four Cheese instant potatoes and crumbled bacon and served them with extra mashed potatoes and corn.  My honey, myself, and my kids LOVED this recipe!  They asked that I add it to my regular rotation.

Terrific recipe! I used JUMBO silicone muffin cups and this was the perfect single, adult serving... but they were so yummy that we really wanted to eat more! My hard-to-please hubby even gave rave reviews. Will definately make again.

My family really liked this recipe. I thought it was good but the ketchup and brown sugar sauce was a bit too sweet for me. I doubled the recipe and used a 12 cup muffin pan like another reviewer which is probably why I had a lot of excess meat mix. I popped the excess into a small loaf pan for 50 mins and will hopefully use it for sandwiches.

Overall, this was a pretty good recipe. My family enjoyed it (well, not my picky son, but he doesn't like anything, so he doesn't really count). My husband rated it as a "do again!" Next time, however, I'll probably mix the ketchup/sugar mixture in and perhaps include vinegar with it or less sugar. It was a big too sweet and putting it at the bottom was awkward. I'll also mix the cheese in rather than sprinkle on top.

I used breadcrumbs instead of saltines, and used a piping bag and large tip for piping the mashed potatoes on. Like other people, this recipe seemed to make much more than six. I ended up getting 11 out of it. Certainly not something to complain about!

Aside from those few odd things, this recipe is quite a good one and I'll be using it again with these few differences.

ha, ha, ha.  but jokes aside, the meatloaf was actually
delicious.  1) cut down sugar & add 1/2 t garlic powder, 
2) DRAIN juices immediately after cooking or will make paper
cups soggy and give away the secret, 3)mashed potato icing is
not so tedious if you add extra (room temperature) butter

Awesome idea. 5 stars alone for the clever factor. You can make the meatloaf and mashed potatoes how you want them if this recipe doesn't line up with your meatloaf vibe. It's a great recipe but the idea is golden. I piped the potatoes with a zipper bag. Not as authentic looking but it did the job. Try to get the potatoes as smooth as possible. Chunks look suspicious. I told my kids in honor of April fools day, we were having dinner in reverse order. Cupcakes first, and then grilled cheese (similar to "April fools grilled cheese" from AR site--grilled pound cake sandwiches with orange marshmallow fluff middle) and tomato soup (a bowl of fruit punch). My kids thought that was cool but said I was the coolest mom when they figured it all out. Good mom moment, thanks for the help!

Super good! Few substitutions/suggestions. Used a 1 1/2 lbs of ground turkey. Used 1/2 red and yellow pepper, plus celery and some green onion. Used a regular cupcake pan, so ended up with 12 mini meat loaves that were delish.

My 12 year old LOVED these.  I forgot to put the ketchup mixture on the bottom so I spread it on top of the meatloaf before I added the cheese and mashed potatoes.  I bought the pre-made garlic mashed potatoes you get in the cold section of the store.  Also instead of saltines I cut up two of the Hawaiian rolls.  I also sautéed the onions and green pepper before adding to meatloaf mixture.  They turned out great.  *I noticed a lot of people thought the sauce was too sweet, I do agree and will probably use less brown sugar next time.

I made these for a child's birthday party. I riced the mashed potatoes with some cream and butter and piped it on top of the 'cupcakes' with a very large star tip. It looked great!

These are really good! I had trouble getting them to look even remotely like cupcakes, but oh well. It was fun anyway. My five year old loved the meatloaf part, but not the mashed potatoes on top, but that's because he doesn't like mashed potatoes period.

I made this for dinner this evening and my husband and friend loved them. I substituted 99% fat free ground turkey And used a bit less brown sugar. Also put the cheddar cheese directly on the turkey loaf before adding the mashed potatoes.  Moist & Delicious.  I will definitely be making these, again!   Uploaded three photos in the tin, on the plate with Asparagus, & one cut into.  Lavender mashed potatoes on top.

These were really good. We used cupcake liners, and didn’t fill them to the top since the recipe said to leave 1/2 inch of space at the top. Next time, I’ll probably fill them the whole way since they didn’t stick to the cupcake liners and ended up sliding around in there a ton.  We quadrupled the recipe and it ended up making 36 instead of 24.  We used the top eater mashed potato recipe on this site, and piping the potatoes with a pastry bag and a large tip made the top look really good.

What a fun meal for the little ones. I didn’t want to add colouring so I sautéed finely chopped red peppers and green onion bits and sprinkled on to make them look Christmas like. Also added finely chopped red peppers, green onions and grated carrots to meat for colour instead of chopped onion.

Used a lot of substitutions for a lower calorie version including ground turkey, cashew milk and eggs whites.

Turned out pretty good and I probably will make it again.

Cute and fun!  I didn’t have anything to make the “frosting “ fancy so I made messy cupcakes!  I did add paprika for decoration.

Super fun and tasty! Important note: if making for kids using food coloring for extra fun, they should be at least 3 and up... no amount of pre-explaining will convince your 2 year old they’re not really cupcakes... and he will be mad they aren’t cake. Lol - Seriously great recipe, I will be making again, just not with food coloring until my little one is a bit older!

This is a super fun dish to serve to unsuspecting children. My kids were hilariously disappointed that these weren't "real" cupcakes. Lol! If you get the potatoes right, they look really convincing. Don't use flake mashed potatoes, they won't work. You need to use real mashed potatoes to get a good frosting for your meatloaf cupcakes. Really fun! Will make again.

Pretty good, but a little too much black pepper. I also used italian bread crumbs instead of crackers, and left out the green peppers. There was definitely enough meat to make at least 2 more cupcakes, I just saved it for burgers the next day. I love the sauce, but there was a lot; could probably be cut in half.

Amazing!  This is definitely a five-star recipe!  The meatloaf was the best I've ever tasted, and my daughter, who hates meatloaf, even gave it a thumbs up!  I made both white and sweet potato "icing" and loved them both.  Thank you for the recipe!!!

I put this together and refrigerated early in the day - mixing all meatloaf ingredients in large baggie, peeling and cutting potatoes and placing in pot of water, and mixing the sauce.  I replaced the saltines with oatmeal, as we did not have any crackers in house.  Cut the sugar way down and used coconut sugar, not brown.  When ready to cook, lined the 8 muffin tins with paper liners before following with directions.  Cooked 30 minutes, topped with the mashed potatoes, and upped the oven to 450 to crisp the tops of the potatoes, as i was not trying to pass off as a dessert and did not use  the cheese.  Very easy, yummy and a great way to proportion dinner.  Hubs ate two and took two for his lunch at work.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my daughter's first birthday party at daycare. I didn't think a bunch of one year olds needed the real cupcakes and my daughter loves ground turkey at the time. These came out really well. I wish I had added more turkey (used instead of beef) to the pan. I had to fill it up to the top of the 12 muffin tin to look more like loafs and less like disks. I used store bought mashed potatoes (I hate to do that but with two little ones, it is sometimes necessary to make short cuts just to get through day). My daughter and her friends loved them. My husband and I ate a lot too!

I used garlic powder because I didn't have any fresh garlic on hand. I didn't have any green peppers either unfortunately so I had to omit them. THEY WERE AMAZING!!! The whole family loved them and so did my nieces boyfriend when he came over the next day & ate all of the leftovers!!

I made these for the family and they LOVED it!!! I didnt have enough for the 1/2 cup of brown sugar  which was ok because the flavor of the ketchup mix was just right for our liking. I can see this being a hit for potluck or appetizers. Thanks for sharing,,,

This recipe was amazing! I followed everything as far as the ingredients. However, I did lessen the amount of ketchup and brown sugar. I only put about a teaspoon in the muffin cups. It was definitely a hit for this Si

I loved making this for April Fool’s Day! I used BBQ sauce inside the cupcake liners. I also used my cake decorating tools to make the mashed potatoes look like real frosting.

Enjoyed the meal but found it quite sweet, would reduce the sugar next time and hide more vegies in the mix.
Winner with the kids. Great bitesized portions.

Good, but I think next time I will add more ketchup & brown sugar to the bottom or drizzle some on top at the end of the cupcakes;  less mashed potatoes. I cheated and used boxed potatoes but still good.

If the sauce hadn't been so sweet it'd be 5 stars.  I  made mine with turkey because that's what my husband prefers. I cut the sugar in the sauce in half and felt it was still a bit sweet. I also added Worcestershire sauce to the sauce to give it more of a BBQ flavor.  I also did some with cheese and some without. The cheese didn't seem to make it better.  Next time I'll just add Parmesan cheese to the potatoes as I whip them.

I made a few changes. I had a total of 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef and an additional pound of Italian sausage sweet and spicy. Add all other ingredients accordingly. This made 14 cupcakes.
Instead of the Worcestershire sauce I used 1 TBS Red Wine Vinegar and 1 TBS soy sauce. The final step of the ketchup/ brown sugar mixture I placed a heaping TBS on top of the cupcake not on the bottom. For the Mashed tater frosting I used 1/2 potatoes and 1/2 sweet potatoes. This recipe is delicious, entertaining and clever!!!!

Very good.  Put  papers in cupcake pan first round but they fell apart, so the next batched we skipped the papers and decided to put the ketchup mix between meat and potatoes. Next will mix cheese in with potatoes.

Because of various food  allergies ,  I have to make adaptations to all of my recipes but, this was a great recipe. I  substituted the mashed potatoes for the mashed cauliflower. It was cute and they enjoyed it.

My family loves these! We made them for a family birthday a few months ago, and today we made them for visiting cousins. They're fun for kids and not difficult to make. The kids love hearing that we are having cupcakes for dinner. I skip the cheese and use a zip top bag (with a small corner snipped off the bottom corner) to pump out a swirl of mashed potatoes on top.

This was the best tasting meatloaf I have ever made. I followed the recipe exactly adding only a dash of season all. They did not look like these, more like large meatballs, but that had no bearing to the flavor. My picky son who eats only hotdogs and manwhich loved these and ate 2 almost 3. Will definitely be using this recipe from now on.

These were good, but rather a pain to make.  If I ever make again, I will just use a loaf pan and spread mashed potatoes on top.

These were a huge hit at my daughter's birthday party.  I used my own meatloaf and mashed potatoes recipes, so you don't need to follow the script exactly.  I like my mashed with a bit of texture and lumps, usually, but to get it through the pastry bag/press you'll need to use a mixer and get them really smooth.  We went with red, green, and blue, and it gets a bit hectic, rinsing the press and refilling it, a few times per color, while hoping that everything stays relatively warm.  But it was worth the effort and mess, everyone loved both the concept and the execution, very festive!  Might have to do it again for the 4th of July.

Delicious as is! Waaaaay better than cooking an entire loaf...it cooks faster and more evenly. A yummy blend of flavored. And I definitely recommend the potato "frosting"; my kids devoured these!

My family loved these!  I read the other reviews and reduced the brown sugar to about 1/4 cup.  I also added garlic powder and soy sauce to the sauce.  It was delicious--thank you for the recipe.  Others said that the pan was hard to clean.  I sprayed each muffin cup and the clean up was a piece of cake.

I used minced onion because I didn't have a fresh one, left out the garlic, and added about a tsp of loose beef bouillon. I made 12 "cupcakes" from this recipe (maybe my muffin pans were more shallow?). My husband and sons raved about this dish!

This was so delicious! My husband who is a picky eater, raved about this and was looking forward to bringing it to work for lunch the next day. I'll definitely make it again and it was so easy. I put a whole lot of seasonings in it, more than what the recipe called for. Such as some thyme, paprika, cinnamon, onion powder and some Szechuan stirfry sauce. I put extra fresh garlic in the mashed potatoes and used grated Gouda on top of the potatoes. I love hot sauce so I used some of that on it once it was done. With a salad, it was a beautiful and satisfying meal. And we went back for seconds. Thanks for sharing this winner of a recipe!

Everyone loved it! I omitted the mashed potatoes on top as we had just had mashed potatoes the night before and didn't want to repeat so soon. I followed the recipe and it came out very moist. I may add a little A1 sauce to the meat next time for a little more flavor. All in all, a keeper. :)

Made this recipe tonight and it was a home run . The only thing we changed was adding 1/4 cup brown sugar to the ketchup based on other reviews. A definite keeper.

Didn't have the  6-cup pan, so I  used my 12-cup muffin pan instead. I doubled the recipe so I ended up with 21 'cupcakes'. Didn't  have any issues with  the  potatoes staying on top, I used boxed but made with whipping cream vs milk (3 cups of flakes) so maybe my mp were a bit thicker than normal.  Omitted green bell peppers because I  didn't have any on hand (bummer). Cooked for 20-25 minutes, drained fat, added mp and cheese ('icing and sprinkles' according to the kids) then popped them back in for about another 10 minutes. Yummy. Everyone wanted seconds. Served with green beans on the side.

Just made these tonight and they were so good!  I was able to make 8 as well.  There was so much I couldn't make only 6.  I left two of them plain without the ketchup and brown sugar mixture and my husband, who is obsessed with siracha, put that on the plans ones. However, he liked the ketchup ones better!  Will definitely make these again and share the recipe.  YUM!
