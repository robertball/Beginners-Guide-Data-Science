this recipe is absolutely delicious. So easy.  I will make again and again.  I could not find the italian tomatoes, so I added a tsp each of oregano, basil, garlic to the crushed tomatoes.  I also added half a jar of garlic and herb spaghetti sauce to the top.  Turned out perfect,  just enough sauce.

I used both ground chuck and sausage. Also added 1 pkg of frozen spinach. Everyone loved it.
