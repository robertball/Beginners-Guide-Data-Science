This is a light & tasty recipe that would be perfect for a shower or lunches.  (It keeps well in the 'fridge for several days.)  BUT to make it serve-worthy, I suggest the following additions: 1-2 hard boiled eggs, 1/2 c finely diced celery, 2 tablespoons sweet relish, 1 c thawed peas, & a couple shakes of celery salt.  Also, use a bit less dill than suggest.  (I used 1 1/2 teaspoons.)  Do not leave out the pickle juice and use a good, homemade kosher dill brand for best results.  I used a little more than suggested (3-4 tablespoons). Finally, do not eat it right away: Let the flavors marry for at least 2 hours (simply follow directions). Whew...That seems like a lot, but it's really not too complicated.  My husband, co-workers, & I all enjoyed it.  It's simple, keeps for a long time, healthy (if you use light mayo & skim milk, which I did), & cost-effective.

I think this is closer to traditional tuna pasta salad. I would add sweet relish instead of pickle juice,this adds flavor and some texture. I agree to cut the portion of dill so it's not so overwhelming.The boiled egg is also a very good addition. I would finally chop so you don't have big hunks of egg in each bite.

Quick and easy.  I used less mayo and switched it to light mayo.  I also used fresh dill, and substituted red onion for the yellow onion and added a little salt and pepper.  Can be easily "tweaked" to your liking!

This is how my husband likes macaroni salad (though I prefer it without tuna). I usually add 3 or so chopped hard boiled eggs to the mixture as well. Some chopped celery is a good addition too.

This was a tasty salad dressing for macaroni salad and this tuna pasta salad.  I did not give this particular recipe 5 stars because I felt it needed color.  The addition of diced peppers (red, yellow, and orange) would have added slightly to the flavor, but would have added immensly to the appearance.

Good flavor. Refrigerate at least 4 hrs. (probably overnight would be better). I used red onion. For appearance and texture, it could use extras like celery, finely diced green pepper, and/or frozen peas (thawed).

This was really good.  Followed advice of other reviewers and added 2 hard boiled eggs, 2 stalks of celery, and 1 cup dethawed peas because we just like bit of extra texture and crunch in our tuna salad. Only used 1 teaspoon of dill. Creamy and delicious even with light mayo and skim milk.

This was GREAT!  Cut the dill to 1.5t, so it wouldn't be overly DILLY.  Otherwise, added some green onion and a can of peas.  Yum!  Next time will try with some hard cooked eggs, as another reviewer suggested.  I think that would be very good.

Mmmm Brains' Pasta! Made this for a "Zombie Luau" party and molded the pasta salad to look like, well, brains. 5-star recipe, more stars with a couple additions: 2 ribs chopped celery, dash of curry powder, splash of Vinagrette salad dressing, and 1/2 diced bell pepper. (I like a little more color and crunch in pasta salad.) Don't forget the pickle juice - what a great way to use that pickle-ey liquid left in the jar! Oh yea, and if you want brain-ey pasta like mine, a couple drops of red food coloring.

I used half plain yogurt and half mayo and followed others' suggestion of adding boiled eggs. It was very good, although a tad bland. Next time, I will probably add more seasoning.

This was REALLY good, and my husband (who isn't usually a big fan of canned tuna, OR dill) loved it! I have to say it was missing something, I can't quite put my finger on it but it needed a little something. Overall good though!

I made the following changes, as suggested by others:  (1) used finely chopped scallions instead of  chopped onion, (2) added 1/2 c. thawed frozen peas, (3) added 1 c. chopped celery, (4) used rotini instead of seashells, and (5) used reduced calorie mayo instead of regular.  I took it to a family BBQ, and for once, I hoped I had leftovers to take home.  Delicious!  Well done, TexasMomof2.

Simple and quite good. I used reduced fat mayo, whole wheat pasta, green onions and added about a half cup of chopped pickles, as we are serious about pickles here. I did cut it in half but kicked myself for doing that because I kind of wanted a little more.

Really enjoyed this - so easy to adapt to personal tastes.  Used 1/2 c. sour cream + 1 c. mayo...added some thawed frozen peas, a bit of cubed cheddar (hubby's request) and some celery salt.  Son 'hates' onions, so I snuck in some onion powder instead.  Delicious, easy summer recipe - than you!

We really like this. This recipe has replaced my old tuna pasta salad. I've made this a few times for dinner even when the pantry and fridge were pretty empty! The addition of the dill and pickle juice really make a difference in the flavor.

We all loved it, especially my husband. I took advise from some reviews and used sweet relish instead of just some pickle juice. I used w.w.pasta, and added a zucchini chopped up just to use it up. The taste was great, I will make this again!

I really loved this recipe. I'm 21 years old and suffer from male kitchen disease. But this recipe was easy and my family loved it. And I listened to MSaggieamy and added eggs and relish. However, I didn't have celery so I put carrots and solantro instead. It came out great

very simple and easy pasta.... relatively cheap to make too...  as written I think it is a little plain... i added a cup for peas to mine... celery or green pepper might also be nice additions as suggested by other reviewers
UPDATE: I didn't have any green peas so this time I added diced cucumber and green pepper and it added great flavor

I have a confession. I made this as directed except I didn't have dill, and after I had finished making it I realized I used  canned  chicken and not tuna. It was still really good! Thanks for the recipe.

What a great salad!! I didn't have pickle juice so I used apple cider vinegar instead. Also, I vary the veggies I use in this recipe and our family favorites are celery, bell pepper and spring onion.

This is an easy recipe and lasts a long time in the fridge.  I use light mayo and 2% milk.  I also add 1 cup of frozen peas in the pasta water during the last 2 minutes of cooking.

Great recipe!

Very good! Love the picke juice! I omited the onion per family preferences. I addded the following: 1/4 C. pickle relish, 1 tsp. lemon pepper, 1 C. peas. I used 13.25 oz. 100% Whole Grain elbow macaroni. This one is a keeper.

Very tasty....I added an extra can of tuna and used fat-free miracle whip. My boyfriend loves it and has been requesting it ever since.

Pretty good. Used macaroni instead, added celery and used sweet relish instead of the pickle juice. Would make it again.

Yum! Very tasty and easy to make.  Read some reviews and modified it to my taste.  I used 3/4 cup of sour cream and 3/4 cup of lite mayo.  I used 1.5 Tb of fresh dill instead of dried.  For color and extra taste, I used 1 yellow bell pepper, 2 celery stalks, 1/2 red onion, and 2 Tb relish (in place of pickle juice). The longer the chill time, the best it tastes...overnight is best! Great for picnics or a hot summer day. :)

This is so delicious and great as a side or light meal!  Even better with a few personal additions:  I add a small can of sliced black olives, half of a red bell pepper chopped, onion/garlic flakes, some cayenne and about a tablespoon of sweet relish to balance the flavor and add some texture.  Definitely refrigerate over night.  So yummy!

I loved this as a basic recipe! I did make some changes to make it a little healthier and more to our taste. I added about a 1/2 cup of green peas and cut the mayonnaise to 1/2 cup. I also did not add milk. I'm sure my version is much less creamy than the actual recipe creates but it was very tasty never-the-less!

This recipe needs no tweaking to be "serve able". I made this for a baby shower. I increased the recipe to feed 40, and had so many compliments on it AND was asked to make 100 servings to cater a wedding the following weekend! Every time we go to parties my friends request this pasta salad! Perfection! No changes needed!

This was SO delicious! Everyone was raving about it at the dinner I brought it to. I added peas, green onion, red bell pepper, used fresh dill, olive oil mayonnaise, and sustainable tuna, poll/troll caught! Which I recommend to everyone because our seas are wrongfully being depleted of their wildlife due to tuna longline fishing.

my mission was to make dinner with ingredients I had on hand.  I did a search for tuna and pasta and viola this one came up with a lot of positive reviews.  

I'm giving the recipe five stars based on my alterations.  If I had made it as instructed I probably wouldn't like it because of the texture and taste (too bland and not creamy enough - I added lots of extras!).  

Here's what I did:  In addition to the mayo I also added 6oz of plain greek yogurt, half of the juice of a lemon; plus the zest, about 5-7 tablespoons of peperoncini juice, 1 teaspoon of celery seeds, 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp of onion salt, a tablespoon of dijon mustard, a dash of salt and pepper.  I also used a bunch of fresh dill in place of the dill weed.  I also added 4 chopped boiled eggs (based on other reviews.)  If I had green onions I would have added that as well and possibly some diced celery (as other reviewers did).

Make it how you like with what you have!

This recipe is very good.  I followed the directions as stated.  The only modifications I made was to reduce the dill to 1 tsp., and only added about 1/8 Cup onions finely chopped.  I also added pre-cooked shrimp. My family loved it, and I will make it again.

Followed the advice of someone who had already tried this and it turned out so YUMMY!  Added a little relish, a little diced celery and a few dashes of celery salt.  I also omitted the tsp of salt to stay a little more heart healthy.

I loved this salad and will be making it again soon.  I followed the recipe except I used scallions instead of onions and added diced celery and cucumber.  It was perfect and all of the green vegetables looked good with the dilly dressing.  YUMMO!  I can't wait to try it with canned salmon as well!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Fast became a family favorite, requested at bar-q’s and game night parties. Made as directed in the recipe, always satisfying. Sometimes I’ll throw some peas and shredded cheddar-jack in for a change. (Mood dependent!)

This is a great recipe. I love the dill I’m it. I also added 1 tsp. of pepper and no pickle juice. I also added a cup of celery which was great for its crunchiness. Will definitely make again this summer.

Recipe itself I found boring, thus 3 stars, but I made additions of peas, relish, chopped celery and red pepper flakes and it came out really good!

I added chopped jalapeño and frozen peas. Served over baby  raw spinach with a little sriracha as I like it spicy. Delish!

This hit the spot just right when I was craving pasta salad - despite the load of high fat mayo, I could at least pretend I was eating healthier as this isn't packed with high fructose corn syrup like all the storebought ones are for reasons far beyond my understanding. I also added peas, and realized at the last minute that I didn't have a jar of pickles in my fridge like I thought I did, so I subbed white vinegar and extra dill for the pickle juice, as well as adding a generous dash of garlic powder - turned out great! Unlike other reviewers I don't find lots of dill overwhelming so I just dumped in plenty without measuring. ;)

Great base recipe. I added one additional can of tuna and an additional tsp of dill. I think it added some extra zest. Delicious recipe though. Will definitely make it again. Great summer said!!

Made it according to directions except I used onion powder instead of onion. I have a very fussy eater in my house (so frustrating!) who doesn't like the texture of real onion pieces. We all loved it, even though the pasta absorbed all the dressing. Any suggestions on how to keep it creamy would be appreciated. I can only think of boiling the pasta a couple of minutes more.

DO NOT ADD ANY SALT!!! Wait until you taste it. I found it way too salty (and I love salt.) I had to add a half cup of sour cream to make it palatable after all that salt. I also added a cup of peas. This would have been 4 stars if I had omitted the salt.

I used two cans of a albacore tuna, 1 cup of Hellmans Mayo, fresh dill from my garden, sweet baby Gherkin-chopped, finely diced celery and carrots, salt, pepper, dried mustard. I would have added two year aged cheddar from Wisconsin, but I was out. Still good.

I made this for my daughter's graduation party and it was a huge hit! Even my kids who don't really like tuna ate it. I did make a few slight changes. I added frozen peas, onion powder instead of onions and used spiral noodles. This is my new go to recipe for tuna salad! Yum!

Followed directions but added the following as suggested by others:
"1-2 hard boiled eggs, 1/2 c finely diced celery, 2 tablespoons sweet relish, 1 c thawed peas, & a couple shakes of celery salt"
Plus letting it sit for a couple of hours.

Amazing!!!  Never thought anything with canned tuna in it could be so tasty.

I used fresh dill instead of dried, Small yellow onion and green onion, added 1 tablespoon of garlic salt, 1 tablespoon of garlic pepper, 1 tablespoon of yellow mustard, i tablespoon of  tajin clasico seasoning and 1 cup of sharp cheddar diced.  It  turned out to be the best tuna pasta salad I have ever had. Definitely chill overnight.

Loved the fresh taste and the variability of this salad.  I found the color  to be too white so added (as others have suggested) black olives,  frozen green peas and piemento.   In the future will replace the onion for red onion and add celery salt.   This salad is as variable  as your imagination allows!   Thanks .

This was pretty good!  I did make the recipe as stated but preferred for our tastes, to add additional ingredients like many others.  This recipe is pretty much like a tuna salad with added pasta in it.  It made a nice light lunch.  After making the recipe as stated and tasting, I decided to add in some sweet relish, dried parsley, garlic powder, diced celery, diced egg, and some peas, because the main photo is what made me want to try this recipe with the peas.  I also thought it would be good to add in some pimentos but I didn't have any.  I only made half the recipe and it made plenty for the two of us for a light lunch and had leftovers for another day.  I loved the dill in this!  A great recipe as listed and it had a nice flavor.  Thank you for the recipe!

My kids LOVE this salad in their lunches (I pack it in screw on tupperware). They wait over the bowl like piranhas! 

I used Clausen Dill pickle juice & added a little bit more than the recipe called for.  I also used elbow mac instead of shells AND I added over two cups of chunky chopped dill pickles (we love dill - can't ya tell?)

 I double the recipe because it disappears so quickly & could probably add one more can of tuna to a double recipe.  It depends on how saucy you want it.
SUPER DELISH!!!

Made the recipe to the T...except I halved it.  Basic, simple and tasty.  It is a very versatile dish...and could change/add a few ingredients depending on main dishes etc.  To those that complain about the dill...it says dill in the recipe title--if it wasnt "dilly"...you would have complained about that too.  And to those that said bland...as with any dish, seasoning is usually to YOUR liking...measurements are usually just given because if they said a dash of this a sprinkle of this and a pinch of that...you would be asking for measurements.  These people on All Recipes are getting a little too crazy nit picking every little thing about a recipe.

I love Dill, so I used fresh from my garden-skipped the pickle juice-yuck (for my taste!) added a can of peas, green pepper, green onion, used greek non fat yogurt instead of mayo, and a few hardboiled eggs. Maybe this doesn't count, b/c it ended up being an almost totally different recipe? lol. that's what I love about AR.com, though-the ability to try and change for my taste. thanks for the recipe!

Its a good Recipe you dont need quite so many ingredients though and you dont need to measure. I just added mayo, dill and salt and pepper to taste to the shell pasta and tuna. Simple and a great lunch idea.

DELICIOUS! Perfect for a warm, sunny California spring, summer, fall, or even winter! I didn't have any milk so I left it out and I substituted Jalapeno juice for pickle juice. It was a bit too "dilly" but still delicious!

LOVED IT! though I deleted the milk, used 4 cans of tuna and added a squirt of prepared mustard - it was fabulous!! Thanks.

This is okay as a base, it was very bland.  For more flavor, I added more pepper, seasond salt and chopped celery.  It made a huge differenc.  Good for the days when you want something light.

We made this salad with a few additions: chopped celery, green onions, and added 3 chopped hard boiled eggs.  In addition to the pickle juice, we added 2 chopped pickles.  The salad was incredibly bland, even after adding extra salt, pepper, and some seasoning salt.  Maybe it will be better tomorrow.  I think it needs extra seasonings... more salt, more pepper, maybe some lemon juice?  We thought it was "just okay".

Great side dish or topper for a green salad.  I usually omit the dill pickle juice, as I rarely have any on hand.  Sometimes I add some black olives or capers.  It always pleases.

This was a great fast and easy salad to put together. I added celery,not too finely chopped. I started off using light mayo and switched to real mayo(about 1/2 cup)since I ran out of the light stuff. Since I'm a little health freak,my experience with real and light mayo is you may have too use a little more light mayo(if you choose to use that instead)to get a creamier texture,otherwise splurge with the real stuff. I would make this again.

This was a good salad.  It tastes better the longer you refrigerate it, so I would recommend overnight.  Very simple without an overpowering dill taste.
