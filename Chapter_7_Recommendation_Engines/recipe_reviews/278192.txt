I liked this recipe, but I overcooked them.  I'll definitely try again!

Delicious! Iâ€™ve made this a few times. These are crispier and lighter thank baked and certainly better than fried. You can even  freeze your drained tofu for 24 hours for a chewier texture. These bites are delicious tossed in buffalo sauce or in your noodle bowl. No mess, lower in fat and calories than traditional methods!
