I first saw this recipe on the authors's blog, and on my favorite forums.glutenfree message board.  I gave it a try today.  This is the best GF chocolate cake I have ever made.  Moist and tender and not at all heavy.  Gluten eaters would never know the difference.  I made 24 cupcakes, and baked them for 25 minutes.

One adjustment, however.  The measurement for xanthan gum should be 1.5 teaspoon, not 1.5 tablespoons.  I also used a simple buttercream tinted green for Saint Patrick's day.  I'm sure the frosting posted with the recipe is great too.

This first time that I tried this recipe it wasn't particularly good... but then I actually read the comments and reduced the amount of xanthum gum and it was really good! Nobody believed that it was gluten free! :)

I absolutely loved this cake.  No one could even tell it was GF!!  I did take the others recommendations of lowering the amount of xanthan gum though.  Also I sifted the dry ingrediants together then mixed the wet ingrediants in a seperate bowl.  I read in another post that the consistancy was that of pudding so instead of using a mixer I used a wisk to mix the wet with the dry and Im pretty sure thats why my cake didnt fall in the middle.  It definatly made it nice and fluffy!!  I would recommend this to anyone... it was really that good!!  I will never buy nasty premade mixes again!!

I read reviews, and also cut x-gum to 1.5 tsp.  I cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup (actually a little less than that) and it was still fine.  For the rice flour, I used mostly white rice flour, but a little bit brown rice flour too.  And I literally sifted together all the dry ingredients first.  I wondered if I should not have used an electric beater, so next time I will try not to beat so much.  It went into the pan almost like pudding (I guess it was the x-gum?) and btw the I greased first, then floured it with rice flour, which worked quite well, came out of pan perfectly.  I cooked for 30 min because my husband likes dense cakes, so was hoping for an almost brownie like result.  I used 2 round pans, and the center did fall A TON, but was SO moist!  I didn't tell my husband it was gluten free because he would have been against eating it, but after eating I told him, and he was surprised.  for my husband to be surprised, that is HUGE.  So now I believe all the reviews that no one knew it was gluten free.  Definitely worthy of making for my daughters' parties.   And though the ingredients are expensive to buy initially (my first GF baking attempt) I can use it all for awhile (except the buttermilk, I found that at Trader Joe's) and I tried the choc. topping, but was not too thrilled with it, I would use a different topping/frosting next time..... my powered chocolate I used was Nestle, but best used by date was almost a year ago; I still used it, and came out great.

This cake was excellent.  I made it for my sister's birthday and nobody even guessed that it was gluten free.  I made 2 round cakes and baked them for 33 minutes.  They did sink in the middle though.  Not sure if I needed to cook it longer?  I put caremal in the middle and on top then frosted it with whip cream.  I crunched up a toffee bar and sprinkled it on top and the sides.  It was a hit! Moist and dense.  Very good!

Where do I begin???? This cake is stupid-good! I'm gluten intolerant, but my husband is not. He insisted that I make him a birthday cake that I could eat and he loves chocolate.  I was hesitant to try this - even after the other great reviews - but soooo glad I did. 
I made a couple of additions, but the only changes I made to the cake recipe was to use 1 1/2 teaspoons of the xanthan gum as other reviewers pointed out.  I used the best cocoa - Callebut - I could find. Trust me on this one, the brand of cocoa you use makes a lot of difference. I added a raspberry sauce filling between the layers and iced it with a simple cocoa whipped cream and garnished with fresh raspberries. It was the best chocolate cake we have ever had. 
An FYI to those baking this for the first time, TRUST the recipe! The batter seems too thick, gummy and gloppy (for lack of a better word) when you mix it and add it to your baking pans (I used two 9" rounds) and is hard to spread around the pans, but it bakes up perfectly. Thank you Gluten Free Mommy, this recipe is a treasure!

I think that I'm a baker... but clearly I'm not.  I followed the recipe, subbing GF baking mix for 2/3 of the flour and soaking the rice flour in the buttermilk for a while (things that I'd read about online, having no actual experience in the matter).  In the end, the batter was THICK and I was worried.  Ended up adding about 1 more cup of buttermilk to some of the cupcakes.  What a mistake!  Once baked, the original thick batter became   perfectly risen, gorgeous cupcakes.  The one's that I thinned are sunken in the middle, gummy, an sad looking.  All this to say, this is a thick batter, and it's great!

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved it! Didn't even care that it was gluten-free. I didn't have sorghum flour so I substituted coconut flour. I used 2 circle pans and my recipe of vanilla icing (1/2c shortening, 1/2c soft butter, 1tsp vanilla, 3-4tbs milk, 4 cups powdered sugar) and it was wonderful.

I tried this recipe for the first time and the cake turned out amazing.  I couldn't find sorghum flour at my grocery store so I substituted corn flour instead(I researched what would be a good substitute flour for sorghum)  and used the 1.5 teaspoons of xanthan gum as suggested as well.  You would never be able to tell this cake is gluten free and I know my friend with Celiac's Disease will be happy to enjoy this!

1 1/2 tablespoons xanthan gum? I think this is way to much ...I followed the recipie to the letter and it turned out like a brownie cake.  not so good either it fell right away.  It was expensive to make and it did not turn out good at all.  I cook a lot but I am new at gluten free cooking.

Pretty awesome cake... endless possibilities...  I followed along with reducing the amt of xanthan gum using 1 tspn, for rice flower I used brown rice flower, instead of buttermilk I used coconut milk (from the dairy dept), light brown sugar in place of dark brown. For the cocoa I used ghirardelli natural unsweetened.  I made a two layer chocolate cake and about 12 mini bundt cakes. I made a chocolate ganache in place of icing. heavy cream, chocolate chips, organic coconut, pure bourdon van extract if I were going to give this to kids I would have used regular vanilla extract. My cake consistency was like pudding with these ingredients.

I used this recipe for a large anniversary cake instead of cupcakes. It was exceptional. The only adjustment I made was using 1 c. sour cream plus 1/4 cup milk instead of buttermilk. Since it was a mixed crowd with gluten sensitive and non-celiacs it needed to be great tasting period. Got raves. the only semi-complaint was that it was rich and somewhat filling (bean flour?) so good, I will use this recipe again and again. Instead of listed frosting, I did a caramel filling w/ dulce de leche frosting; so this rating is for the cake only.

I was definitely not impressed with this cake. It fell in the middle and I thought it was super bland. If I ever make it again (which I probably won't) I would add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the batter and cut back the xanthum gum to 1 tsp. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used 1 1/2 tsp xanthum gum instead of the tablespoon that was called for.

I made cupcakes instead of a 9x13. The cupcakes were great, but the icing wasn't the best... I think the sour cream made it too sour or something just didn't mix right, I ended up making another chocolate icing.

This was my first time baking anything gluten free. I made cupcakes with this recipe and they came out absolutely delicious! I did note that many many reviewers said that the recipe should read 1&1/2 teaspoons xanthan gum, not Tablespoons, so I adjusted accordingly. These cupcakes came out moist and fluffy and very very flavorful. Unless you tell someone they are, no one will know they are GF. I did not use the icing included with this recipe, but all the same, this recipe is a keeper I am bringing my cupcakes to a going away party tomorrow where the guest of honor is GF. She is going to love them! Thanks!!

I used this recipe to make cupcakes and they were fantastic. I only had brown rice flour (usually baking calls for white rice flour) but they still turned out great. I also reduced the xanthan gum to 1 1/2 tsp. as someone suggested. They rise a lot so  I would go with about 1/3 third full for cupcakes or they spill over the top too much.  I baked them for 18 minutes.Instead of the frosting I used one reviewers idea to add some caramel sauce to the top. On top of that I added some home made chocolate ganache. I put a pecan on top of that. Definitely a keeper.

These are really fantastic cupcakes! This was my first time in a long time baking gluten-free and I was very surprised. I did use the teaspoon portion of xanthan gum instead. I also used butter cream icing, which I think matches the taste of the cupcakes really well.

Delicious and perfectly rich. Served to whole family at birthday and all loved it.  Used my own recipe for frosting. It was even better the 2nd and 3rd day which is rare for GF baked goods.  Love it!

The only thing I changed (other than adjusting the amount of xanthan gum to tsp from TB) is substituting coconut flour for sorghum, because I ran out. The texture of this cake is fantastic, light, fluffy but moist,however I found it was lacking in flavour. If I am going to eat chocolate cake, I want to eat CHOCOLATE CAKE!! Regardless, this is a recipe I will make again, upping the amount of cocoa (and taking away the same amount in flour to keep the ratios the same), upping the vanilla, and adding some salt. Did not make the icing, so this review is for the cake alone. Always happy to try a real gluten free recipe, meaning one that actually includes the types of flours used!! So thank you, gluten free mommy for sharing!

I subbed coconut sugar (same ratio) and it turned out great! I also used 1 tsp. of xanthan gum as suggested by the other comments.
I didn't make the icing (used SMBC instead).

I have tried about 7 other gluten-free chocolate cake recipes, and this one was BY far the best!

This cake turned out fantastic! I served it for a birthday party to a group of 7 gluten eaters and they all thought it was to die for! Couldn’t tell it was gluten free at all. I just used regular Betty Crocker chocolate icing. In agreement with all the other reviews, xanthan gum is tsp not tbsp.

I always read the reviews for tips and take what I can from them so here is a changed recipe review :)  I used namaste all purpose flour instead of the three flours called for and did not add xanthan gum because it is already in the flour.  I used oil instead of butter.  Everything else was the same except that I made cupcakes (baked for 22 minutes at 350).  They were excellent - very light and fluffy.  I would not be able to tell the difference between these and non gf cupcakes.

I just took the first batch of cupcakes out of the oven. I found that they required about 16 min at 345 degrees (dark pan.) They looked beautiful coming out, but quickly sank in the middles. From another gluten free baker, I have learned that a common cause of this is too much leavening. She suggests that 1-1 1/4 tsp of baking powder and 1/4-1/2 tsp of baking soda is sufficient per cup of flour. So--I am theorizing that perhaps this recipe calls for a bit too much of those. I may be alone in having this issue, too. I am very new to this way of baking and finding it is NOT intuitive! These do taste great and are very moist. I used sweet rice flour in place of regular rice flour as it is very fine and imparts no grittiness. Yield was 24 cupcakes (and I could have baked a couple more if I had wanted to bother with the little amount of batter left.) I made a basic buttercream frosting, added a couple of large spoonfuls of raspberry jam to half of it, and about a tsp instant coffee dissolved in a little milk to the other half. Very yummy! As another reviewer mentioned, batter is very thick. Use a large bowl and strong mixer!

XANTHAN should be 1 1/2 TEASPOONS NOT TBSP!  With that change the recipe is outstanding.  My gluten eating family remembers this cake and just asked that I make it again.  Very moist and delicious.  I just made a simple buttercream for the frosting, because that's my favorite.

I only made the cupcakes, not the frosting.  I bake for a local farmers market and this cupcake with a vanilla butter cream frosting is a favorite.  The Xanthan Gum amount I use is 1 1/2 tsp NOT TBSP. I also use Hersey's Special Dark Cocoa and milk soured with white vinegar.  Moist, light & delicious!  Next time I make them for the market I will photograph.

This was very good:) I did make a few changes...I used millet flour, brown rice flour, and tapioca flour in equal parts. In place of xanthan gum, I used ground flax/chia combo. I used 1/2 c butter and 1/4 c coconut oil. For the sugar, I used 3/4 cup raw sugar and 1 c sucanat. Instead of the buttermilk, which I had none of, I used 1 cup sour cream with 1/4 c milk- which another reviewer mentioned. I made a fluffy peanut butter frosting with it- my husband loved it, me, not so much. Will definitely make the cake again, but will choose a different frosting. Thanks for the recipe:)

My daughter can't eat gluten so I make a lot of gluten free items.  I made these for a going away party for someone at work who is also gluten free.   They are Awesome!  Everyone ate them and loved them.  Lucky for my daughter she was also home at the same time and gave them rave reviews.

I will try this with a pre-mixed flour and see if it will solve the sinking in the middle problem. :)
