Loved it!  I used fresh peppers & onions vs. frozen and added chopped fresh cilantro as well.  I also used "Red Enchilada Sauce" (from this site).  Tasty wrapped with a warm tortilla, or plain with cheese on top.  A keeper, thanks Jaime!!

Is it possible to use fresh instead of frozen green bell peppers and onions? YES!

delicious and so easy to make.  I don't like peppers or onions so instead I added some canned corn.  It was very flavorful- I think the kind of enchilada sauce used might make the difference. I used old el paso "hot" enchilada sauce. I still cant believe how easy it was.

I liked the recipe, but it seemed to be missing something for me.  I added a can of corn and a can of diced tomatoes with it.

Hmmmm...I really wanted to rate this higher, but the recipe made as written, in my opinion just did not have enough flavor.  I used fresh veggies and sauteed them in olive oil.  I had to add quite a bit of salt to acheive the flavor I like, and I served this in a warmed tortilla with shredded cheese like the previous reviewer suggested.  I used store bought enchilada sauce, which I really like, but I'm wondering if I should have gone with homemade.  I doubt it would have made that much of a difference.  As far as being quick and inexpensive, it's deserving of all 5 stars, but the taste lacked something to be desired.  I served this with picante sauce on the side.  Maybe adding some more spices to the vegetables while their cooking would help.  Glad I gave it a shot.

Suggestions: Saute rice in oil, add 1 package sazon and 2 tablespoon tomato (or the "red") sofrito, 1 tablespoon fresh chopped cilantro, 1 tsp chopped garlic, stir around for a minute then add liquid (preferably chicken broth). Keep an eye on it and when it starts to thicken up, add the "drained" and "rinsed" (very important) black beans.

Very easy and delicous recipe!  I served it with the Cajun Spiced Chicken (also found on allrecipes.com)When I had put the sauce over the rice, I put cheddar chees on the top - very good!

This recipe was great!  I used red beans because i didn't have black.  I grilled a flour tortilla (yes, grilled! try it) just until crispy, put a layer of shredded chicken with salsa, cheese, rice then topped it off with the mix and a little more cheese.  It was soooo good. Yummmmmmy!!! It's a keeper for sure.

I took the suggestion of serving this with tortillas and it was extra delicious.  I also took the liberty of adding garlic to the fresh peppers/onion saute.  To finish, I used homemade enchilada sauce (courtesy of my mother-in-law), added some leftover shredded grilled chicken, and topped it off with sour cream and shredded cheese.  Overall, a great meal and I look forward to the leftovers for tomorrow's lunch!

This was easy to make and the boyfriend liked it enough to have a second helping, but I thought it was kind of gross...beans and (I used fresh) onions and peppers swimming in sauce.  I used Las Palmas mild enchilada sauce, which I love for enchiladas, but it over powered the beans and made it way too runny.  I'll stick to my usual: dried black beans cooked with green pepper, onion and ground oregano.  Thanks for the idea though.

My family loved it! I gave it 5 stars but I did what other reviewers suggested and added a can of diced tomatoes and corn. I used frozen 3 pepper and onion blend. This is the 2nd time I made it and we still love it!

Awesome--the diced tomatoes and corn really add to it.  I would drain them both before putting them in so it doesn't turn into soup!

Delicious and a big hit with the family!  I added the diced tomatoes with chiles and some corn as mentioned in earlier reviews.  It's great for leftovers in burritos as well.  Enjoy!

This was pretty good.  I served this with bulgur instead of rice.  For kicks, next time I'm going to try using a can of black beans and a can of kidney beans.  Thanks!

My kids loved this.  It was quick and easy.  I used someone's suggestion to do corn instead of peppers and onions.  I think creamed corn would have been better and thickened it up a little.  My hubby wasn't home but my 3 yo said he has to have this later!

It was an easy to make weekend meal, substituting the white rice for brown. I used fresh chopped onions and sauteed them with the thawed green peppers in olive oil. I thought it could have used a bit more flavor.

Pretty good and no meat needed to make this tasty dish.
Instead of frozen grn peppers & onions, I substitued:
1 large green pepper, diced
1 large onion, diced.
The recipe came out too wet, so at the end of cooking I added:
1 1/2 Tablespoons corn starch to
2 Tablespoons water
and simmered a few minutes until thickened. 
The taste was enjoyably hot probably because I used a brand of black beans that had marked "with creole seasoning".

I made one change:  I used fresh peppers instead of frozen.  Otherwise, I followed it exactly, even using white rice when we otherwise only eat brown.  And my family unanimously hated it.  The enchilada sauce was overwhelming and everything just seemed to sort of float in it.  My eats-everything husband didn't even want his and my children obediently ate their two bites and asked to be excused.

Easy and very tasty.  I made a few changes:  added 1 fresh green pepper and a fresh small-med onion instead of the frozen.  Have also made this with pinto beans and it's awesome with those, too.  Thanks for posting!
Just wanted to follow up:  When I made this the first time, I used Frontera Green Chile Enchilada Sauce, which was fantastic.  Since then I have played around a bit and used a less expensive can (maybe Old El Paso or something) and it wasn't nearly as good.  Just fyi....

Fast and delicious! I would go a little heavy on extra seasoning next time, because out of the pan this tasted great, but over the rice it was a little bland. Still, we loved this.

i was looking for a quick and easy side and found this.. i altered it slightly to make it a little heartier and a little veggie-r.. i added 1/2 cup of uncooked rice.. used a can of generic veg-all in place of the bell peppers and onions (was being lazy).. and used 2 cups of spicy green el pato enchilada sauce for the 10 oz can.. i'm sure i could have doctored it up somehow.. but again.. i was looking for something quick and easy.. bf said it would be great in a burrito.. ty for the recipe

This was so easy and so delicious...i added a clove of minced garlic to the onion and green pepper, and then pan fried some sliced smoked sausage and added it to the finished rice...it made a delicious meal. Both my husband and I loved it. I will be making this one again!

Very good!  I made a couple modifications based on the feedback here:  Drained and rinsed the beans (too starchy otherwise - not sure why one wouldn't do so); added half a cup of salsa, one cup of frozen corn and three cloves of garlic.  Served over long grain wild rice with a dab of sour cream.  Eat with a fork or corn chips!  I also used fresh onion and pepper since I couldn't find any frozen mix of the same!
Thanks for sharing!

Very easy and really good if you like rice and beans. If you're not a fan of beans, you probably aren't even looking at this recipe. Otherwise, make sure the enchilada sauce is good.

Good healthy side if using brown rice. Find low sodium enchilada sauce or make my own. spice up a little more.

OMG...  To die for!  Be sure to drain the black beans, add 2 cloves of minced garlic, and 1 can of diced tomatoes (drained).  Should we want a full dinner I'm planning on adding 1 lb. of cooked and drained ground beef or turkey.  Can't wait to see how that turns out.  Definitely recommend this one!

We really enjoyed this!  Used 2 chopped yellow peppers and a small sweet diced sweet onion.  Instead of a can of enchilada sauce used 10 oz of tomato juice and 2 Tbsp of chili powder.  Made with brown rice.
