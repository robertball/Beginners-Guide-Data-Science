Super pasta salad recipe. I never cared for the "dump a bottle of Italian salad dressing on the pasta" type of pasta salad, nor the ones with pepperoni in it. This recipe is very tasty and all the vegetables give it a very fresh taste. A definite keeper!!

This was a seriously great pasta salad!  I used 1 lb of pasta and just increased all veggies and the dressing.  I added black olives as well and I used a lot more tomatoes than the recipe called for (because I LOVE them!).  My husband HATES pasta salads without meat or cheese chunks in them.  He took one bite of this and said "wow - this is great!".  I truly love that this isn't the same old-same old  pasta salad with italian dressing thrown over it.  You could probably add any veggie you want to this one.  It would be hard to ruin this one.  GREAT recipe!!!!!

I thought this recipe was great! Very quick and easy to make, and everyone loved it. I used tri-color rotini and it was really colorful and flavorful.

Wonderful! When I first tasted it I wasn't sure I would like it since I could taste the ketchup.  It sat overnight and all the flavors blended.  Can't belive how good it was and as others said - different that just the normal Italian dressing.  Looking forward to making this often in the summer.  Was great to take to work for lunch. Thanks so much submitter.

This is a great dressing for pasta salad. It is different than the usual bottle of Italian. Very good! When making a large pasta salad (using a whole box of pasta), I tripeled the dressing recipe.

This recipe is great, as is, but I did add some things just to switch it up a little.  It has really been a hit!  I just made a double batch for a co-worker of my husband's; they requested it to carry to an event.  I followed directions except I added these things:  1 small jar marinated artichoke hearts (undrained & broken up), 1 small can, drained, black olives, 1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan cheese (could use feta also), & 2 tsp. garlic salt (fresh ground, in a mill, bought this spice combo @ my local warehouse club).

Wow, I cant believe I forgot to rate this recipe. I have made this probably 10 times already. This is the best pasta salad I have ever eaten. The only change I ever make is to use what veggies I have on hand like cucumber, yellow peppers, ect. Definetely try this over any pasta salad, you wont be dissapointed!! Thanks darlene for posting this!

Brought it to a Christmas party and everyone loved it.  I doubled the recipe because of the number of people and it turned out great.  You could use other veggies like cucumber or broccoli if you are like me and dislike carrots and celery.

Fabulous!! Finally a pasta salad that isn't the same old italian dressing type! This is the best pasta salad we've ever had. I've been searching for a salad that had just the right flavor and spices without being too vinegary.  This hit the mark.  The only change I made to this great recipe is that I added 1 heaping Tbs. of McCormicks Salad Supreme Seasoning.  It gives it a great salty/sweet flavor that we loved. I highly recommend this salad to anyone.

So fantastic.  I've only had this recipe for a month or so and have made it for lunch, parties, and BBQs.  Such a crowd pleaser! 

I didn't have ground mustard, so I just put about a teaspoon of yellow mustard.  I doubled the onions as well as the veggies.  I added broccoli (steamed beforehand) as well as grilled chicken.  I also made it with whole wheat pasta instead of white-- it makes it healthier and more filling.  Don't stress about the perfect ratio of spices--I just eyeball it and the dressing tastes great every time.  

Thanks!

A tad too sweet for my palate, but interesting twist on the standard.  I'd try this again, cutting down on the sugar - maybe cutting it out altogether because the catsup is sweet, and maybe experimenting with spices.  I like the suggestions of adding parmesan or other type of cheese and that would probably help with the sweetness.

This pasta salad was a big hit at a work luncheon. The dressing is so different than typical pasta salads. Like many reviewers, I added vegetables not in the original recipe (cucumbers, yellow pepper, and broccoli) and skipped the celery (not a big fan). The vegetarians in the group were thrilled with a salad that doesn't need any kind of meat to bulk it up. A keeper!

Fantastic flavour! Don't try to "stretch" the dressing by adding more pasta. It looked like too much but it is really the perfect amount. I think next time if I'm not planning on eating it all at once I'll save a bit of dressing for "day 2" so that it stays moist enough.

This is really really good! I was looking for something different - not the traditional mayonnaise variety and not the "dump a bottle of dressing" kind. This dressing was easy to make. I made 1 lb. of pasta, doubled the dressing and did also throw in some parmesean (1/2 cup), 2 Tbsp of chopped fresh cilantro plus some pepper. SUCH a nice change from other recipes!

Only change was leaving out the green pepper as I don't care for it.  This was some decent stuff with a bit of tang to it.  I think it could have used a bit more vinegar and less oil, plus I added extra salt & pepper to the servings.  It's a good way to use up left over stuff but I don't know if I'd want to make all the time.  Don't get me wrong - OK, but just not any great wow.  I also did not really find it all that "different" as I see in a lot of the comments, but maybe I've just made so many different pasta salads that it's hard to find something I'd think was really different.  (And I agree with NJtoAL that this is not enough for 8 servings - they'd have to be small.)

This salad is a good base to explorer all kinds of vegetable mixes. I doubled the dressing recipe to get a good coverage for the whole box of noodles I prepared. I added diced peppers, diakon root, olives, shredded carrots and some dubliner cheese. It was great! Suggest you make 12 hours ahead to let flavors mingle...

This dressing is so much better than throwing a bottle of Italian dressing over pasta salad.  SO worth the extra effort.  I mix mine in my little food processor and it is perfect every time!

Really liked this recipe.  The dressing is very different from most pasta recipes that are oil based.  My husband and I liked it best the second day after the flavors had really blended.  Next time I will add additional peppers and maybe some cucumbers.  My picutre shows the pasta a little more orange/red than the others due to a little more paprika.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I was skeptical about this recipe because I really don't like ketchup, but this pasta salad was amazing and very easy to make. Like other reviewers, I let the salad sit overnight for the flavors to blend, and there was no hint of ketchup flavor whatsoever. The dressing is very versatile - I substituted raw broccoli florets for the green pepper because that was what I had on hand. Next time, I'll add some sliced black olives. This is going to be my go-to pasta salad from now on!

Easy, yummy, but as written it isn't near enough for 8 people. Can't wait to taste again tomorrow after the flavors have meld together. My changes were omitting carrots and tomatoes. And adding red, yellow and orange peppers and broccoli.

I used this basic recipe to make pasta salad for 80 teachers at my son's school and it was a major hit.  Yes, I altered it, but most importantly this recipe is all about the dressing.  I used a blender to mix the dressing and added some roasted red pepers and a splash of balsamic, but it was great before I added anything.  Use this dressing as a base and play with the rest of the recipe to suite your tastes.  Definitely a keeper!

This was good, but not great. A little too sweet for me. I added some freshly ground black pepper, but it was still missing something. I used diced zucchini, red bell pepper, carrots, and broccoli instead of the veggies called for, so maybe green pepper would have been better. I also used the blender to make the dressing because I know a lot of people don't like raw onion and I was taking it to a party. It went at the party, but no one commented on it or asked for the recipe.

Yummy Yum Yum!!! LOVE this recipe. Use nice organic vegatable spiral pasta and easy to make slight modifications to spices depending upon how you are feeling. This is now a favourite in our house. Great for picnics and camping since it stays good in a cooler.

This is a fab pasta salad - my mum always makes them with a mayonnaise based dressing but this is lighter, tangy and a bit sweet too. Much better than a creamy dressing!

I added chopped semi-dried tomatoes and sliced black olives to this - about ten semi dried tomatoes and maybe a quarter of a cup of sliced olives. Very nice!

Excellent recipe!  I doubled it, and reduced the sugar a little bit (about half), and it was a big hit.  Used black olives, green peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, and green onions.  Yum, definite keeper.

This is a great recipe! I made it for a family party and kids and adults polished it all off. I used whole wheat pasta, and instead of including all the vegetables, I only used red peppers (instead of green) and celery. It added color and crunch.

This was a bit hit with our family and friends. The dressing seemed a little odd at first, but everyone kept coming back for more (and then insisting that we bought it at the grocery store and put it in our own container!)

I have a similar dressing that I make in my food processor and this worked out just as well.  I like to have the onion nearly liquidfied.  I chose my own vegetable mixture of a little bit of green and red peppers, and sliced black olives.  I also use a salad enhancer that I use here in the PNW, which is called "Johnny's Salad Elegance."  To serve the salad, I would at least offer parmasan cheese on the side, as my family likes it that way.  Thanks for the recipe!

This dressing is amazing... tangy and delicious!  I used whole wheat pasta and replaced the celery and carrots with artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers and also added a little shredded parmesan.  Finished it with a a sprinkle of cayenne, salt, pepper and a little cilantro.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

I love this recipe.  So easily modified to what you have in your home.  I used stuffed olives and finely shredded Italian Cheeses.  The dressing it what makes it delish.  I loved this because I had everything in my pantry and didnt have to go out to purchase anything out of the norm.

Very fresh and light - I used a pound of bow tie pasta, tripled the vegetables, added about 1/2 cup fresh parsley but didn't increase the dressing.  My family loved it - even my husband who has never before touched any sort of pasta salad! It was a nice change of pace from the 'regular' Italian dressing and mayo based dressings.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful.  I am sooo picky about pasta salad and have yet to find one that i LOVE but this is the one to end the search.  It's sweet, tangy, with a little bit of spice...perfect!  Only thing i changed was I added the McCormick Salad Seasoning and it was amazing!!!

I had high hopes for this salad since many of the reviews said it was so much better than the Italian dressing kind (which I really don't like).  However, made exactly as the recipes is written I thought it was pretty much just another cold, bland, sour, pasta salad.  I wouldn't  make it again.

This homemade dressing makes it. So much better than using the bottle of dressing.  Many positive comments. Thank you.

I was not a big fan of pasta salads before making this one. I needed something to take to a picnic and was tired of potato salad. This was a hit and always is! I make it a several times a month in the warmer months. I do use red onion instead of yellow and I use "smoked" paprika which is more expensive but gives it an unique flavor that's perfect for a BBQ. I aways use a pound of rotini and double all the other ingredients.

I like this recipe a lot. I've made it with and without some ingridients, it's been fine. It's very quick and easy, too.

Once you buy the spices and vinegar once, you'll be able to make it 100 times again with just the stuff on hand.

Just very average and reminded me of pasta with a bottle of Italian dressing.  Sorry, not for us.

Very tasty salad, thank you! I used the full box of tri colored spirals so I increased the other ingredients and doubled the dressing. Used 2 cups of each veggie including the onion which was more than double but yummy and really enhanced the flavor. I already had baby carrots so I used them diced up instead of shredded and I'll be doing that again. I think it added to the texture. I'll be making this again for sure. Next time I think I'm going to add some small cheese cubes, maybe pepper jack or provolone. Definitely a white cheese. While I was eating it that's what I was wishing for, both for taste and aesthetics. Thank you for this easy and winning recipe!

Really great.  Was making this for a dinner party BBQ, so needed a winner - and this was.  Salad was especially good three days later.  Glad I came across this.
