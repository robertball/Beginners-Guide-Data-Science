Tried the recipe using some Bushmills 10 year old, drank right from the blender over ice. Not much difference between this and the bottled stuff. Going to start a second batch while I finish this glass....

This is a great recipe! No egg, no split! Put all the ingredients (except the whiskey) in the blender. Low speed. Then, slowly added the whiskey. It did not split! Needed a little sugar. Try THIS one!

This was great LOVED that there is no raw egg in it! I also substituted almond extract for mint and added a bit more chocolate, half of it was gone before i got it into the fridge:D

Awesome recipe. It is always in our fridge during cabin season. I half the almond extract. I have also made it with spiced rum instead of whiskey which was excellent. Try adding a cinnamon stick to the bottle for another twist.

Changed the recipe slightly used full cream milk instead of cream but stuck with the rest of the recipe. Used Teelings Irish whisky and ground Cuban coffee Good long slow blend and this was great after being chilled for about 4 hours liked it better than Baileys!

Instead of using instant coffee I just added a cup of extra strong brewed coffee. I also used light cream instead of heavy cream and omitted the almond extract as my wife doesn't like it I also didn't blend it - I just mixed everything together in a pitcher before pouring it into the leftover Baileys Cream bottle.
