I heavily altered this recipe since first trying it. I bake in a rectangular pyrex dish which I coat the entire bottom well with olive oil. The potatos used are pretty important. I strongly recommend using Yukon potatos. I also chopped up a huge Spanish onion, 5 cloves of garlic (instead of 4), and added parsely. I love Kielbasa but sometimes I use a family-pack size ring of fresh sausage from a local supermaket. I was too lazy to put in carrots (don't like them anyway). Bakes fabulously at suggested settings in the recipe. I bake this every two weeks since it makes enough food for me to take to work for 3 days.

I thought it was delicious - but I made a few changes. I used Turkey Kielbasa, and added quartered red potatoes (so I only used 3 white potatoes), one and a half large onions in wedges, and because my garden is full right now, I added a red pepper, a green pepper, rosemary, basil, thyme, and large chunks of zucchini. I followed another reviewer's recommendation and tossed it all in a bowl with some olive oil, kosher salt, and cracked pepper first. I roasted it all covered at 375 for 30 minutes, and then at 400 for 10 minutes just to reduce all the juices a bit. My whole (picky!) family loved it!

Great recipe! I used one package regular smoked sausage and one package turkey smoked sausage, and I used unpeeled red potatoes and cut them into smallish pieces. Since I was in a hurry, I bumped up the oven temp to 375, put everything into my roaster, covered it, and it was done in about 40 minutes.

After reading all of the reviews I decided to put my own little twist on this.  I adjusted the recipe to feed 3 people.  If you love onions, chop them into nice larger pieces and use a little more than 1/2 of one.  Also, I sliced the Kielbasa in 1/2 before cutting the 2-in. pieces.  I threw everything in a mixing bowl first to make sure I could stir all of the seasoning as evenly as possible.  I chopped a bit of fresh parsley and added paprika with the salt and pepper.  After I poured the ingredients into the 9x13 baking dish, I measured out the olive oil into a small bowl and added honey and balsamic vinegar.  Obviously that makes for more sauce, so I don't suggest initially coating the bottom of the dish with olive oil because ours was a bit too saturated at the end.  That said, this came out so delicious and I'm not even that big of a fan of sausage!

I used smoked beef sausage and smoked turkey sausage. I used unpeeled red potatoes and cut the baby carrots in half. I cut up a red onion into small pieces.  Mixed everything in a bowl and added the oil. Also added some fresh parsley when I mixed it. Cooled one hour on 350 with tinfoil, then removed it for 30 minutes. Very tasty and whole family enjoyed it. Will make again!

Easy, quick to prepare, and a huge hit with my hubby! I'm planning to serve this the next time we have guests over....I didn't change a thing. The onions caramelized beautifully, and the sausage crisped up nicely. Thanks for a great recipe!

My family loved this (even my picky son).  Everyone went back for 2nds!  I cut my potatoes in thin slices and turned up the heat the last few minutes so that the potatoes browned on the bottom.  I also mixed everything together to evenly spread the oil.  Great recipe!!

I used butternut squash because I didn't have carrots. I also poured some chicken broth in the bottom and cooked at a higher temperature to help speed up the cooking of the vegetables. Still let everything brown up in the end. Turned out delicious.

I came across this recipe and had  some vegetables left over from a vegetable dip - carrots, cherry tomatoes, small yellow peppers and cauliflower. Added potatoes and an onion. My daughter won't eat red meat so I used turkey sausages browned in chili flakes (for spice). Big mistake browning the sausages, though, they came out overcooked, but will use this recipe again for sure.

Really delicious and so easy!  The prep work only took about 15 minutes and then you can sit around on the couch while your delicious dinner is getting ready!  I used Montreal steak seasoning instead of salt and pepper, and it turned out delicious.  Great recipe!

we love this! the only change I made was to add some zucchini, sliced 1/2" thick, during the last 10 min of cooking time. I slice it ahead and let it marinate in a little olive oil and seasonings.  otherwise, I make it as written...I just love zucchini and its perfect in this recipe...just don't put it in too soon or you'll have green mush.

`My only change was to dice the onions so the flavor was more evenly distributed and we didn't get large chunks of onion.  

You can certainly add other ingredients of your choice.  With sweet potatoes being so popular these days, you could substitute them for the white potatoes and adjust the cooking time accordingly.

I have made this recipe many times. Always asked for by the family. I  like it  ( because of the carrots )better than the  sausage and peppers only recipe.But I do add the red, green or yellow peppers to this recipe.

So simple and so darn good!  I did add some sliced celery to this and some mushrooms I needed to use up.  I also love that this makes enough for 2 more meals for me.  A short prep, then I enjoyed smelling the wonderful smell while I sat with my feet up.

Kids loved it and I loved the lack of mess and one pan deal. Easy to make and smelled delicious. Every bite was gone. We like ours with extra wide egg noodles.

Great new recipe for the inexpensive kielbasa. Yea! I changed cook time to one hour covered, and everything was done. It would have been too long, otherwise. The bottom of the kielbasa also burned, so I think a good stir halfway through would help. Finally, I drizzled olive oil over everything but the kielbasa and sprinkled a packet of onion soup. Chopped fresh parsley at the end helps brighten the appearance. My partner said this was his favorite way I've ever cooked kielbasa. Thank you again for the great idea!

I followed the recipe for the most part, only adding a couple more items that happened to be in the kitchen: some broccoli, a red pepper. My family really liked it, and we'll be having it again.

Great recipe to play with using what you have on-hand.  I used chicken hardwood smoked sausage instead of kielbasa, 2 pounds baby Yukon gold potatoes cut in half (skins on), petite baby carrots,  and 1 tbsp dried minced onion in place of fresh (my kids won't eat it if they see chuncks of onion).  I added 1 tsp rosemary, 1 tsp thyme, 1/4 tsp pepper, and only used 1 tbsp olive oil.  Bake time was spot on.  The entire family, kids included, asked for more.

Delicious! Super easy. Didn’t have an onion used onion powder instead, baked it about 20 minutes longer to get carrots and potatoes soft. We thought it was yummy. Next time I’ll have a real onion, cut veggies into smaller pieces, and serve it on a piece of buttered bread. :)

I liked this a lot!  When I uncovered it, I added a few cut up asparagus spears and green beans. The whole bit was done perfectly in another 30 minutes. Easy as pie.

I will definitely make again.  The only thing I added was a few pieces of celery that I wanted to use up.  It was delicious!

This is my go to! I use Sweet Potatoes and have evolved to adding orange bell pepper and spinach. I always use Turkey kielbasa. Good and healthy!

I used fresh mild Italian chicken sausage and pork sausage.  I decreased the potatoes to three and added a delicata squash cut into small pieces.  I put some sprigs of fresh rosemary and thyme on top of the dish for extra flavor.  We all loved it.  I will definitely make this dish again.

Good, easy recipe.  Made a half recipe.  Eye-balled the oil so may have used a tad extra.  Baked as directed but after removing the foil, added a small sliced yellow squash that I needed to use and just sprayed it with Pam prior to adding to the casserole.  Just laid it on top and baked for the last 30 minutes.  Ended up increasing the heat to 425 degrees and baked for an additional 10 minutes for some extra browning.  Very tasty, but the carrots weren't quite tender, probably needed another 10 minutes even though I cut them into 2 inch pieces and then quartered each piece.  I used whole carrots, not baby.  Will make again...so easy.

A new family favorite! I used sweet Vandalia onion and made the recipe as written.
