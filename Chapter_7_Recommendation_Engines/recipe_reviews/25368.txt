The ingredients all clash with each other.  My family did not find this to be a very good meal at all.

This was surprisingly good. I think it would be best with crab meat ( I used tuna). And maybe less milk. It doesnt have the best look, but the taste makes up for it. I'll use this again.

Was nervous about making this but needed something quick. Didn't have canned crab, only chunk. Didn't use tomato soup but used zesty tomato bisque soup, no milk. Layered the top with cresent rolls dough.  Probably didn't use as much onions but couldn't tell.  My husband and I both loved it.  We tried not to eat it all so we could have it for lunch tomorrow.

This was the worst recipe I have ever tried off this site, I should have read all the review for it before I wasted my time and money. The ingredients just didn't go together good, it was a war of bad textures and flavors in the first bite.

This recipe turned out pretty good.  My husband said he'd eat it again, which is pretty high praise and I actually ate the leftovers for lunch, so that says a lot.

Drain the green beans.  1/2 the milk and cook the biscuits separately.   Way too runny.  Good flavor

I don’t have a clue how anyone could not love this casserole! French green beans will be used next time and I also loved the idea of Roasted Red Pepper Tomato soup over regular Tomato.. I did sprinkle hot sauce over green beans and Old Bay seasoning and dried Basil over the crab ... I also baked 20 minutes before adding the biscuits and another 12-13 minutes watching that the biscuits didn’t burn but were done... When I served I dumped upside down on the plates so the biscuit was underneath.... I will be making this again!!!!

Used sweet condensed milk. It came out a little runny on the bottom. But it was good. Question would be, do I add more flour or use less milk?

I follow the recipe, and the biscuit were raw mushy, we didn't like it. My rating is 1
