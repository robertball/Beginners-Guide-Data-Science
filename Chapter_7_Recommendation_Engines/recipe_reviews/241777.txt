I just made this today. It took less than and hour to make and tastes great! I'm starting a new fitness program so the portions I needed were off from what the nutrition information recommended, but that's to be expected when you have to count your carbs and protein grams. This was really simple and I'm only 16, I don't have tons of experience in cooking. I was surprised that all of those ingredients fit in a 12 inch skillet but they did! I will definitely make this again!

Super easy, from start to finish 40-45 mins, including wiping up the stove from splatters. I prob need a slightly larger pan, but I use less noodles so they don't stick - it should almost constant stirring instead if frequent, but, like I said, could be my pan size. First time I made w broken up chicken sausage, was great, this time hamburger. It's great for a Monday night, so we have Tuesday leftovers. I'm not the cook in the house, but this has been a hit, and was requested!

Good base recipe - I used penne pasta noodles and added a fair amount of seasoning (salt / pepper / Italian seasoning to the beef and more Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the finished dish) along with a healthy sprinkle of grated parm. I used about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of shredded mozzarella as well.

As written, 3 stars at best. Too watery for me, lacked any flavor. I tried it a second time— A simple additional of about half a can of tomato paste makes a world of difference (add in while noodles are cooking). My family loved it this way. With that change, I give it 5 stars and will add it to my regular rotation.

Great recipe.  I tweaked it a little and use Feta Cheese, Greek Cream Cheese along with Mozzarella.  I reduced the amount of ground beef and added zucchini and squash.  I used fresh tomatoes and a small can of tomato sauce.

My daughter and I made this recipe! She is learning to cook and it was very easy to follow the directions. The meal was absolutely delicious and this will now be a new "go to" when time is tight. The only thing I would double down on is to stir very frequently as the noodles cook!

Love this simple recipe! I used a 12oz box of bow tie noodles in place of the lasagna noodles. I also added a couple handfuls of spinach before the cheese on top as another person suggested. YUM.

Delicious and easy.  Made this with my ten year old granddaughter.  Only problem was that our 12 inch skillet was not quite big enough.  We had to transfer to a large sauce pot. Used a different brand of sauce.  Everyone had seconds.

Very simple recipe.  if you are looking for an alternative to boxed stove top lasagna, this is a hands down winner and is just as easy.  I used prego, otherwise followed directions.  it is a family fav now.

This was pretty good. Nothing special. Personally I'd prefer regular lasagna. But this was a good meal for a busy weeknight. I used penne pasta and seasoned with homemade seasoning salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and oregano. Topped with parmesan cheese. I also made garlic bread.

All I added was garlic and onion powder and salt. This was a crowd pleaser for my whole family! It was also super easy to make. I will make this one again!

It was okay.  The lasagna noodles made it hard to mix everything.  Would of been better with elbow macaroni but of course then you couldn't call it lasagna :)
