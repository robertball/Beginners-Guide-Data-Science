OMG this was sooo awesome.My daughter has been doing very well in school and begged for this. I was stunned. The other version from this site was good but hard and expensive to make. I used the instant pudding and then used my mixer to avoid clumps. Perfect consistency and yummy. I topped it with peanut butter chips and drizzled with chocolate syrup. Done in 15 mins tops. I also used a chocolate crust. Now she wants me to make it for every month for her good school work reward!!! I made this for less then $5~awesome on tight budgets!

This is the first peanut butter pie I have ever liked. I made it in a chocolate crust coated with melted chocolate and than swirled it with peanut butter and choc. chips. It was excellent.

I melted the peanut butter in the microwave and added it to the milk for instant pudding (it was all I had in the cupboard).  I also forgot to reduce the milk for pie rather than pudding.  My soggy mess tasted great!  I can see how this would be great if made as directed.  I would be interested to see how it worked for someone else with instant pudding mix.

Wow!  This tasted and looked like it took more than it did.  I used the sugar free instant vanilla pudding, mixed slightly with the 1 3/4 cup milk (amount for a pie) and then added (whisked) in the peanut butter (I microwaved for about 25 seconds- melted but not hot).  I did use a granola crust but definitely thinking a chocolate crust would be great.  Really needs some color on top- chocolate syrup, fudge sauce, ganache, peanut butter cups- something - especially when using graham crust otherwise it's too "plain" looking.  It does have a richness, but it's so much better than I expected!

Made this for our family Thanksgiving potluck.  It is very rich and delicious.  I kept being told I was "bad" for making it but that was as people were shoveling it down!  I used a chocolate graham cracker crust and crunchy peanut butter.  I only had instant vanilla pudding which worked fine.  I added the warmed peanut butter after I had added the cold milk.  I also topped the pie with crushed 5th Avenue candy bars.  Delish!

I followed a previous reviewers advise and used the instant pudding i had on hand and microwaved the peanut butter first. It was clumpy and runny. We couldn't even finish one serving. I only give it 3 because we used instant pudding which the recipe doesn't call for so it could be our fault.

The texture was very different from any other peanut butter pie I've made, very gooey though it held a pie shape when sliced.  Due to the strange texture I would have given this 4 stars but my husband loved it & insisted it was a two-thumbs up 5 star recipe.  I made my own crust using the Graham Cracker Crust I on this site. I used instant pudding with 1 cup of milk & microwaved the PB for 25 seconds.  Whisked until smooth - easy peasy. Served drizzled with chocolate sauce & topped with whipped cream.  I wonder how it would taste with chocolate pudding... without the topping it tasted almost like I spread a ton of peanut butter on a crust - it definitely needed something.

This is a very rich pie.  After mixing the peanut butter in to the pudding I tasted the filling and it wasn't sweet enough, so I had to add a little sugar. Very peanut buttery tasting filling.  Very easy to make.  All members in my family liked it.

This pie is a bit rich, but so easy!  I would like it to be sweeter and maybe a little less peanut butter.  It tastes like I just stuck a spoon in the peanut butter jar.  I used a chocolate cookie crust and poured ganache over the top then covered the whole thing with whipped topping.  I bet whipped cream would be better, but I have a dairy allergy.  I hope my husband likes it because it is too rich to for me to eat the whole pie.

It's a bit heavy but can't be any easier or tastier!   We like a lighter pie but this was fabulous in a pinch.

This was easy and spectacular.  It never ceases to amaze me when people don't follow a recipe and then leave a bad review.  Use a cook 'n' serve pudding, use the full cup of peanut butter, don't melt the peanut butter and you'll probably have excellent results like I did.

It's easy. It sets up nice. We used natural peanut butter and added some salt and sugar. I imagine it would have been better had we used normal peanut butter. It was much better after left to set in the fridge.

I loved this pie!  It's so easy.  I made my own crust with low fat graham crackers.  I also used low fat peanut butter and skim milk and it was awesome.  I'll absolutely be making this again.
