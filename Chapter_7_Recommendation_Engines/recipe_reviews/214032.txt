I squeezed my own lemons, And used 3/4 cup of organic pure cane sugar. I even added frozen rasberries. It was great.

Not too tart.  Not too sweet.  Perfect amount of lemon juice. (I threw in the juice from a couple of oranges too only because no one was eating them) Excellent, Hubs says.  I think so too.

I squeezed my own lemons. Made twice, Stevia tasted better then the sugar. Added 6oz bottle  (around a cup) of stevia & it made the Lemon taste pop out.

I like to simmer the sugar with 1 1/2 cups of water to dissolve it so that it does not just float to the bottom and you have to stir often.
