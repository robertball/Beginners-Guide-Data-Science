WOW...Is this tasty!!! This deliciously creative chicken dish has become a family favorite in our home!!! It is a wonderful combination of flavor... with the honey mustard barbeque sauce and bacon. The list of ingredients is fairly simple and they taste awsome together. It's also nice because it is quick to prepare. We love it!!! Our compliments to the chef...Thanks "Anthony"!!!

This is great but at 1000 cals and 36 grams of fat it is way too much for me so I lightened it up by using ff dressing, light shreaded mexican cheese, and a bag of Hormel bacon bits.  Also no butter or breading or you can use egg white and bread crumbs and a little olive oil to brown chicken breast or just brown them in cooking spray.  Still turned out great and with a lot less calories and fat.  This tasted great and my family loved it.  Thanks Anthony!

Yummy, although the times are incorrect.  There is no way this takes 1hr 45 min.  It takes about 45 min to brown the chicken, bacon, etc. and then 20 min in the oven.  Should be approx 1 hr.

My husband really loves this recipe.  We had it at a potluck and he would not stop talking about it, so I made it.  I did make a few minor changes though to make it more nutritional.  I fried the chicken in half the oil and ommitted the butter, used only 12 oz of reduced fat bacon and used reduced fat cheese.  It still tasted great.  I also only used 2 tablespoons of the spicy mustard.

Terrific, restaurant style meal.  The preparation was a little much for a weeknight dinner, but if you have the time to do the preparation, it is a great meal.  Recommend making it on the weekend.  Also, a little expensive for a family. Can't complain about the taste though.

I wasn't sure about this recipe as it was a bit involved, but thought I'd try it.  It was good, but I'm not sure I will make it again.  If I do, I will save some of the sauce and spoon it on top of the chicken then cover with the cheese.  The pasta had almost to much sauce and the chicken was kind of bland.  We didn't finish it the first night and had the leftover's warmed the next, it seemed to taste better the second day.

This is a very good recipe.  After the pasta has been drained I place it in the 13*9 pan.  Then I put the mustard and BBQ sauce on at this point to prevent the pasta from becoming gummy or sticky.  I also use chicken tenderloins that are already skinned and deboned.  They are easier to cook. They cook in less time and they are more tender in my opinion.  Again this is a very good recipe and it is good for leftover lunches.

Sauce went fine with pasta (mini-shells, not penne) for me.  I only coated one side of the chicken.  I seared the other side, then drizzled it with lime juice while the breaded side was cooking. Really makes it pop.  Would like to know if "Anthony" likes it.  Don't need near that much oil to make it tasty in a non-stick skillet.  Worth the prep.

This was really really good! My husband said "delicious", and i thought i could've used mre sauce! Its a nice change from the average chicken/pasta dishes. Here's a tip--cook and crumble the bacon and cut up the onion and tomato when you have time during the day, and it saves steps that niht during cooking. Also, i used italian seasoned breadcrumbs for extra flavor. Shredded cheddar worked fine in place of M.Jack, by the way. Either way---try it! You'll be pleasantly surprised! Thanks Anthony!!

Don't be afriad to try this recipe!  I only made half of the recipe as 6 chicken breasts would be too much for our family.  I made the sauce and put over the pasta, at that point I became very worried that we wouldn't have an edible meal for supper, it seemed very funky.  However, I trudged on...I forewarned my husband but he loved it!  This is very good!  It seems like such an odd combination of stuff.  I covered the pan with tinfoil when I put it in the oven so as not to dry out the noodles.  Next time I will probably make all of the sauce but halve everything else, there wasn't quite enough sauce.  Also, the breading wouldn't stick to the chicken.  I have made similar chicken where I dip it in melted butter then bread crumbs, I will do this next time.

I had a hard time locating a honey mustard barbque sauce.  I ettled on a honey/dion sauce/marinate from the mariante section not the barbque section.  The results were excellent.

This is great!  I have made this several times now and have found someone new every time that loves it! I followed the recipe to the T the first time, then I modified it a little after that by not breading the chicken and frying it butter, seems to make it moist.  I also added more BBQ sauce (too dry if not), bacon and cheese.  Definitely fattening that way but very TASTEY!!

A great combination of flavors.  Rich and hearty; easily scaled.  Try cutting up the chicken into nugget-sized pieces--it makes the portion sizes easier to control.  The egg is not necessary if you would like to make it healthier; the bread crumbs will stick just fine if you just use the milk.  Definitely worth the time spent.

I thought this recipe was absolutely amazing...  I couldn't believe some of the reviews that said it wasn't good!  I'm notorious for substituting, so I used what I had on hand (honey BBQ sauce mixed with honey mustard, cheddar cheese) and I don't like spicy mustard, so I used honey mustard instead.  I thought it was very flavorful and one of the best recipes I've found on this site! A+!!

One more note - I know it can't be healthy with all the cheese, bacon, etc, but it CAN'T be as bad as the nutritional information says it is.  It just can't.  :)

I wanted to make this recipe b/c it seemed different.  It was different!  I liked it, but found the sauce to be somewhat overwhelming and added sour cream to make more of a "creamy" sauce.  It was excellent!  I could not find "honey mustard bbq sauce", but subbed Honey bbq instead...just as great.  Pretty easy too!  A+  Thank you!

I guess my family is in the minority on the rating of this recipe!  We love mustard but the taste in this recipe was overwhelming.  I can't help but wonder if the spicy mustard should have read 3 teaspoons rather than 3 tablespoons. 
I will not make this again!

Really good, but REALLY time consuming.  My sister and I cook on the weekends for the week and it took her as much time to make this as it did for me to make three other meals and I still finished first.  Don't make this unless you have plenty of time.  It tasted really good though.

The chicken part of this recipie was amazing!! I definitely should have taken the advice of the rest of the raters about the pasta, however. The sauce was great...but not with pasta. Next time I will omit the pasta and just cook another side dish seperatly. Also, I used bacon bits instead of cooking and crumbling bacon to save some time.

This is a very tasty and unique dish.  The honey mustard bbq really gives it great flavor.  It is the one dish my husband keeps asking for time and again.  I gave it four stars only because it is a little time consuming.

I didnt care for the way this turned out.  I liked the BBQ sauce, but the way it mixed with pasta just didnt taste right.  I will most likely use the BBQ sauce recipe again, maybe to put on burgers or something.

The pasta was delicious.  I used mini penne.  I think that if you were to use the regular sized, cut it in half.  Would make far too much pasta.  The chicken was not good.  Was pretty much flavorless.  You might try using a seasoned flour mixture instead (if frying first), otherwise doctor up the bread crumbs and bake it on top of pasta instead of frying it.  Maybe add cheese in last 10 mins of baking.

I saw this recipe and couldn't wait to try it. However, I wish I hadn't tried it. Although the flavor was ok, it was not good enough to make up for the amount of work and time it took to make it. The flavor was not as wonderful as I had expected it to be with some of the other reviews I had read. I will not be making this again.

I had my doubts about this recipe - barbeque sauce and pasta?  But actually, it was really tasty.  I did not use too much mustard, because I didn't want the overly-mustardy taste everyone was complaining about.  Anyhow, it was really good and had a nice tangy spicy flavor.  It took a bit more time than expected, but the result was worth it.  I'll definitely make it again.

Very delicious but not for novice cooks. A lot of steps - I think I used every pot and dish in my kitchen. But my husband raved and asked for this to be served for future special occasions.

The recipe was disappointing.  I always follow a recipe exactly as submitted the first time I prepare it, but this dish simply did not come together!  The combo of barbecue sauce, bacon, tomato, onion, and mustard sounded good, but it didn't seem to marry well with the penne pasta and breaded chicken.  Also the Monterey Jack cheese was not quite right.
I won't make this again.

Great recipe!!  I put a little less spicy brown mustard and poured the sauce over the chicken as well before popping it in the oven.  To save time, I used microwaveable bacon...

I don't know why someone said this is quick to prepare because it took at least 50 minutes. I did use 3 tsp mustard instead of 3 tbsp, but it still seemed strong. Reserved some of the sauce to put over the chicken & then topped with cheese. This is good, but it's a rather rich meal. Probably won't make again.

This was a lot of work and I really didn't like it.  I thought the BBQ sauce was way to over powering.  My husband liked it alright but just not for me.

This was a little strange; haven't quite decided if I will make it again. The flavors are definitely unique, I just don't know if it's unique in a good way.

Just wow. Talk about man food. I made exactly as stated except I used a can off diced tomatoes instead of fresh (what I had). I will totally be making this again with a few changes just to make it a bit easier. Fist thing I would recommend doing the chicken in more of a tender size over the breast size. I will cook the onions a bit before I add the tomatoes and bacon to it, they were a bit cruncher than we prefer. Other wise it was good to go.

I don't know why this went so very long without a photo (since 2002!)---let alone a review saying how delicious this was.  If you eat this in moderation, I can't imagine that it would be out of the mainstream main dish on many menus!  We enjoyed all the bites we took of this!  If you just used as much of the ingredients as you wanted for your meal--using the listed ingredients--you would be just fine.  I didn't have penne so used another pasta similar in shape.  My BBQ sauce was just Sweet Baby Ray's.  My mustard came from Phillipe's, a notable Los Angeles eatery.  My bacon was from leftovers from last week's breakfast.  This was all within the recipe's requirements.  It was very yummy.  Thanks, Anthony!
