Cucumbers weren't available, so I substituted asparagus, which was in season. I liked making the sprouts, and I liked the combination of flavors in this salad.  Quite tasty!

Healthy and delicious. Don't be tempted to make more of the dressing. The amount is perfect.

I love sprouted-lentil salads, and this is a good one. The curry adds an interesting flavor, but it made the salad a bit gritty. I used fresh oregano and added a grated daikon radish along with the red radishes. I think some minced shallot would be a good addition.

The sprouted lentils took two days to make.  Which wouldn't be that big of a deal if the salad was superlative.  It's not.  I told my husband "this tastes healthy" which isn't a complement.

I also used fresh oregano and resisted making more dressing as suggested. It is the correct amount. I added some frozen corn. May try some diced jalape√±os next time fir a little kick.

Love sprouted beans, thank you for sharing. I sometimes dunk this in yogurt :)
