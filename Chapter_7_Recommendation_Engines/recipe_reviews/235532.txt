I AM NOT a beet eater but this recipe looked like it could mask some of the dirt taste that beets mimic so well. The carrots and onions would be a distraction and, when I studied the recipe, I realized a little sweetener would be in order so I added Â¼ cup of local Maple Syrup. The best complement a beet hater (like me) could give this recipe would be I found it palatable. My wife, who I made this for, and is a beet lover, thought the recipe was outstanding!  As a beet hater, it would be unfair if I rate this recipe so, based on my wife's earthy tastes, I'll give this recipe the highest rating!

Hubby Loved it Mom and I liked it. I couldn't find purple carrots but loved the color contrast of the Beet and Carrot. Mom and I are not root vegetable fans and still we enjoyed this dish.

Truly an excellent recipe, though we felt we had to add olive oil to the ingredients to hold the moisture in.  The beets were very large so we par-boiled them, as well as the carrots, then cut them all up for baking.  We served these as a side to meatloaf and baked potato for 34 people. People loved the combination

We have made this recipe twice this summer as we have harvested beets fresh from the garden. It is fantastic! The salt and pepper seasoning brings out the best of flavors. We will be making it again soon.

This was good and very easy.  I didn't use purple carrots since I had regular carrots on hand.  Would like to try it with the purple carrots and I love beets.
