This recipe came out really good, but REALLY sweet!  Instead of boiling the jam for 12 minutes on low heat, I boiled it for about 5 minutes on high heat.  Boiling the jam on high heat ensures that it will jell properly and kills bacteria more effectively than on low heat.  Also, I decided to process the jam instead of just refrigerate or freeze.  I ladled the hot jam into hot, sterilized jars, and placed then in a boiling water bath canner and processed for 10 minutes.  All the jars sealed nicely.  Thanks for the recipe, I can't wait to try other flavors of jello!

We LOVE this jam and have been making it non-stop since I found the recipe.  (We have lots of rhubarb to use up...)  Fresh or frozen rhubarb both work well.  To cut back on the sweetness a bit, I increase the rhubarb to 6 cups and reduce the sugar to 2-1/2 cups. Great stuff!

Previously, I had made a recipe that was almost identical to this, except that it called for a package of frozen strawberries. When I came across this recipe, I thought I'd try it as is, but I had 2 pounds of strawberries in my refrigerator. I chopped up one pound of strawberries and added them to the pot during the cooking stage. What a difference! It turned out really well. I just finished making my second batch in less than a week. I expect to make much more of this this summer (of course, I end up giving quite a bit away). My only tip is to cook the mixture until the rhubarb is soft (I don't even pay attention to cooking times).

I have a question. The recipe doesn't say how long the jars will last. Could you freeze it for longer storage? Thanks.

okay-very sweet.  Also, if you get the jam hot enough, you can just put it in your jelly jar, screw on the cap,turn it upside down, and cover it with a towel and it will seal so you can store it in the cabinet.

I took advice of another & used food processor as I didn't want to wait overnight.  I was going to use all Splenda but only had 2 cups on hand so added 1 c sugar. Also used Sugar Free Strawberry Gelatin.  End result was delicious.  Going to try all Splenda next time.  Thanks for this very easy tasty recipe.  I love simple.

Very good recipe!!! I doubled the recipe and cut the sugar down to 5 c. total.
I did process the jam in a hot bath. This recipe doubled makes 12 eight oz. jelly jars.

The recipe as stated is not very good unless you like the taste of 'jello' in your jam., I prefer the taste of real fruit, so I made some changes, and it turned out delicious. I used 1/2 pkg fruit pectin added to the rhubarb in the beginning, and added real strawberries- about 2 cups. 1/2 the sugar, and made the recipe according to the pectin directions. I still added 1/4 pkg of the jello at the end for color, and it is soooo much better this way..I also did not let the rhubarb sit in sugar. That ruins the natural 'tartness' of the rhubarb. Made as is, the jam tastes like strawberry jello-made this way- it tastes like strawberry rhubarb jam.

I canned this so will say more. Wow, what a great idea to use strawberry jello!  This came out GREAT.  First, I let the rhubarb sit more like 16-18 hours so that it would really break down.  Then, when I was stirring it, I used a potato masher.  This broke down the pieces even more.  I then poured it into hot jars and processed for 10 minutes in boiling water.  Seals took fine.  I really love the consistency. No big chunks but still like jam.  Jelled by not to a jelly consistency.  For me, this yielded four 8 oz jars and two 4 oz jars.  One of the 8 oz jars wasn't quite full enough for canning so I put it in the fridge.  I probably could've made it work by redistributing but I knew it would get eaten so why bother?!  I served it poured over cream cheese with crackers.  The family inhaled it! I will definitely make this again.  I'm also going to try using jello with some different fruits for jams, such as strawberry jam and adding blackberry jello.  Love this recipe!

Question for you experts - when you chop the rhubarb and add the sugar - do you leave it on the counter overnight or place it in the fridge overnight?

EASIEST JAM ON EARTH!  I've made jam for 37 years and this just takes the cake for easy peasy...lol  I'm making extra batches for Christmas gifts for the neighbors.  It's DIVINE!  ***NOTE - I did take the other cooks advice and roiling boil the jam for 5 minutes.  That tip made it even FASTER!  *** ADDED NOTE.  I think it's worth noting here that this jam HAS TO BE frozen OR refrigerated.  Jell-O is protein based (and gelatin is an animal by-product) so I think trying to can it like normal jam is a bad idea.  FREEZE IT/REFRIGERATE IT.

I have made two double batches of this jam in the last two days.  It is excellent.  I did use Splenda and sugar free jello. No one will ever be able to taste the difference.  I did substitute raspberries and raspberry jello to try something different.  It was even more amazing than the strawberry version.  Also, I cut the sugar down to 2 cups per recipe on my 2nd batch.

I LOVED this recipe.  It tastes amazing and is so easy!!  I cut the sugar in half though.  It is sweet in the beginning and then you get the tart of the rhubarb at the end!  I also added fresh strawberries during the cooking phase!! Couldn't have asked for better jam!

Excellent jam and so easy!! I prefer to can this instead of keeping it in the fridge. I just put it into sterile hot jars and cover with sterile lids (making sure the rims and grooves are wiped clean) and then process them in my waterbath canner for 10 mins. (depending on elevation) Then I remove the jars an place on a cooling rack over night. This is my family's favorite jam. My brothers keep asking for more! :)

I tried this recipe with frozen rhubarb, splenda, and sugar free jello for my diabetic mother.  She loves it and always orders refills when it's gone.
Thanks for a great recipe.

I have used this recipe for a while - not sure where I got it but I double it and I don't let it stand overnight. I cook it on low until the sugar dissolves and then boil it for about a half an hour or until the rhubarb is soft. When heat processed this will store for about a year.

You can also add a cup of drained crushed pineapple to this recipe. I have made this for years and everyone loves it.The pineapple makes it taste like real strawberries in the jam. It does not taste like pineapple.

Thank you for the recipe but I wasn't so fond of the jello. I did about 1 1/2 cups of sugar to 5 cups rhubarb and 2 cups of strawberries. I added 1 pk of certo and 1/2 pk of strawberry jello. The sweetness was perfect but I could taste an after taste that I didn't like and I realised it is the jello. So I won't be using this recipe again. Thanks anyways.

Sorry but this is just way way way too sweet.  I used 6 C of chopped fresh rhubarb and cut the sugar to 2 C.  I tasted it before I put in the Jell-O and knew it was going to be too sweet so only put in 1/2 the pkg.  The jam was so incredibly sweet that I had to toss it.  If I had more rhubarb or some fresh berries I would have added those to try and salvage it but didn't have anything.  If I try this again it will be with at least 6 C of fruit and only 1 C of sugar, will also add some fresh lemon or grapefruit and zest.

Delicious and easy! I cut the sugar to about 2.5 cups and added an extra handful of rhubarb. It made 8 of the tiny jars (half pint jars I think). Made this again and this time I cut the sugar to 1.5 cups and still delicious!!! Not so sickly sweet but sweet enough for everyone!

Thank you thank you thank you, Sally! I paid nearly eight dollars for a jar of this last year at my farmer's market. Now I can make it at home. It is heavenly with Peanut Butter on toasted Egg Bagels!

this is a really good recipie, if you don't have time to wait overnight for it to set and cool you can just put the gellatin in right away after you stir the rhubarb and sugar together. it works great!

Lovely and easy!  The only changes I made were to add fresh strawberries right before I cooked it.  Beautiful color!!  I also made a version with raspberries and raspberry jello, divine!

Very easy recipe, but I think next time, I will use less sugar.  This jam was way too sweet for my taste - I'm a beginner at jam-making (this was only my 2nd attempt).  I liked the easy recipe, but will try altering it a bit next time.

Fantastic and super easy!  I wasn't paying attention and just put all of the ingredients in the pot; so I just simmered the mix until the rhubarb was cooked and the consistency seemed right (probably about 20 - 30 minutes).  I just ladled it into containers and stored in the refrigerator.

Loved this recipe.  I also blended the rhubarb and sugar mixture because I did not let it sit over night.  Came out very good.

With rhubarb picking lasting from May through October, this recipe has been wonderful!  When the berries are out of season, this has been a wonderful way to use rhubarb.  I make a double batch made with strawberry and orange jello to give away over the holiday season.  We've also tried raspberry jello and tried a double batch with 1 box strawberry and 1 box raspberry.  Doubling the recipe comes out great everytime and there's plenty to store-up and to give away :)

I rated this recipe high because of ease in preparation and it tastes wonderful!  I did make some additions per remarks of others.  I used 2 cups of Splenda instead of 3 cups of sugar, added 2 cups of strawberries in the beginning and added 2 additional cups when I added the jello which was sugar free.  Better for dieters and diabetics!
I thought the finished product was a little thin for jam, but that could be because of the changes I made.  Might try cooking it longer next time.  My husband thought it was more like a thick ice cream sauce and loved it.  I also water bath canned the finished product so I would have it on hand this coming winter when my husband and I travel.  It should make wonderful exchange gifts to fellow travelers during the holiday season.

I make this every year and it is delicious!
I double the recipe and it makes 4 1/2 pints of jam.
Use 12 c. chopped rhubarb, 5 c. sugar and a 6 oz. package of strawberry jello.
Try Wild Strawberry if you can find it.
You do not need to let it sit overnight.  Just cook the rhubarb and sugar until tender.
I like to water bath can it for shelf stability.  Put jars in your canner in hot water, bring to simmer and simmer uncovered 10  minutes.

Incredible!  I made 6 jars, processed them in a water bath for 10 minutes, and gave away four.  I got four phone calls the next day saying how great it was...  I had to try it, and was absolutely delighted!

I used 3 cups Rhubarb and 2 cups Strawberries (I didn't have enough rhubarb alone). Cut the sugar to 2 cups and cooked it all together right away. I was too excited to make it to wait overnight. I also used a potato masher to make sure the pieces were not too big. Followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out so yummy. The kids, my mom and mother-in-law loved it!

I made this recipe with 2 cups of sugar instead of 3.  Some others said 3 cups was too sweet; and I like mine slightly tart.  I used "wild strawberry" jello. It was absolutely delicious.  I kept the jam hot and sealed it with the canning process.  My family was very impressed.   I couldn't ask for a tastier or easier recipe.  Very pleased.

Really great rhubarb flavour! We thought that letting the sugar and rhubarb sit overnight was totally unnecessary, so we let the sugar sit on the rhubarb for a couple of hours to get juicy, then started boiling on really low. Boiled for about an hour, until the rhubarb was broken and jammy consistency. Added jello, put in jars, and let cool. It's great! We also thought 3 cups of sugar was a bit over-the-top, so used only 2. Next time may use only 1.5 cups. Awesome and easy!

My go-to recipe and everyone RAVES about my jam.  LOVE that there isn't any actual strawberries.  You'd never know, and it saves a fortune over buying fresh berries.  THANK YOU so much for sharing.  I make 60 or more jars a year and always run out!

Delicious and easy! 
This is the first jam I have ever made.  I added about 8 big strawberries to the rhubarb and love the taste. 
I am making a second batch this week because we have eaten almost all of the first batch in about 2 weeks.

YUM! This is so SO good. I know, it sounds a little weird getting the strawberry flavor from Jello, but trust me when I say that you'll want to eat it with a spoon! It's SO good.  I used 8 cups rhubarb, 4 cups sugar.  Next time I'll use less sugar.  It made 8 8oz jars which I canned, processing for 10 minutes.    And the best part is that you could use any combination with this recipe. The doors are open!

I know its late in the season but I used rhubarb from my garden to make this jam. I only had 2 1/2 cups rhubarb from my 1 plant so I used only half the recipe. Also, I processed the jam  so I could put most of it in my 1 remaining jelly jar and have the rest for breakfast tomorrow. For the processing, I hard boiled the sugar, rhubarb, and 4/5 box of pectin for about 5 minutes and let simmer for an additional 7 minutes then added 1.5 oz gelatin. I put everything in a sterile jar, put lid and band on, and water bath for 10 minutes. The pectin and gelatin probably wasn't necessary but I read reviewers state it had a runny consistency and I wanted a harder jam. All in all, the jam was really sweet so I'll have to decrease the sugar next time.

Hmm...not bad but as others stated..I threw in 2 cups of fzn chopped strawberries. Oh heck no...I only used 1.5 C sugar and even that was sorta sweet. So, I had 4 C frozen Rhubarb and 2 C's of frz strawberries. I used 1/2 a pack of 'Royal' brand strawberry jello. Hey...side note. It's a 1.4 oz box and has way less sugar then jello brand. Either way...I'll do this again...but cut way back on the sugar and use 1/2 the jello ingredient. Mine turned out fine with texture and sweet level. Next time, I won't mash the rhubarb up so much, I prefer some little pieces. All in all, an okay recipe with some adjustments :)

I got a ton of Grandma's homegrown rhubarb so I put some of it to use with this recipe. Super simple and quite a bit cheaper and perhaps healthier than storebought jam. I did cut the sugar down to a cup and a half and I used SF jello. I know it sounds silly when I used sugar, but it's all I had on hand. I did add a tbsp of lemon juice and tsp. of vanilla extract but other than that, I followed the recipe and directions exactly. I love how easy it was.

This is the easiest best rhubarb jam.  I add a cup of strawberries, and a cup of blueberries.  I have people returning jars and looking for more.  I was lucky to have a friend who keeps getting rhubarb all summer long in her organic garden.  I have also tried it with splenda.  I use 6 ounces of strawberry gelatin when using more fruit.  No matter which way I make it , it comes out great.

This is very easy to make!! Came out a little too sweet with the 3 cups of sugar and the strawberry really covered up the rhubarb taste so my suggestion for rhubarb fans is add 6 cups of rhubarb and keep sugar still at 3 cups. To answer another posters question..I leave it sit out of the refrigerator overnight before cooking the next morning so that the juices come out of the rhubarb.

My mom and grandma used this recipe, just to put a little spin on things, I substituted cherry jello. Oh Yummmmy, Mom likes it better than the strawberry, next I will try raspberry flavored jello.

This is a great recipe!  I only had 3 1/2 cups rhubarb so I added the remaining with blueberries and it was amazing!  I decreased the sugar to 2/3 cup sugar and then added 2/3 cup Splenda.  It was perfect!  I used the sugar free Sparkling Wild Berry jello bc it is what I had on hand.  This turned out to be a great compliment to the changes I made.  Will be making another batch!  Update:  the first batch was incredible and I have just made #2 and did the fruit the same way (since a 1 pound bag of frozen rhubarb is about 3 1/2 cups, then added the remaining with blueberries.)  Since I was using the Wild Strawberry Jello (with sugar) I used only 1/2 cup each of sugar and Splenda.  I found it to be sweet enough and so I only added 2/3 of the package of Jello.  It set up just fine.  A wonderful recipe that you can alter very easily and still get amazing results that everyone loves!

Wonderful Recipe!!!  My children absolutely love it and often eat the left over jam with a spoon.  I use 10 cups of rhubarb and 5 cups of sugar.  I don't refrigerate, just simmer for about an hour until the rhubarb is soft and falls apart.  Makes 4 pint jars.

This is the second summer that I have made this recipe.  All our family and friends ask us if we have any extra jars...it has become a favorite for all.  I add strawberries, but that is the only addition I have made to the recipe.

I am very pleased with the results I got ith this jam.  I only used 4 cups of rhubarb and 2 1/3 cups of sugar.  I added a cup of strawberries at the cooking phase and it turned out beautifully.  I really think that if I had added the other 2/3 cups of sugar this would have been too sweet but as is, its wonderful.  My only mistake is I think I didn't chop my rhubarb small enough so next time I will use slightly smaller chuncks.

My family loves the taste of this jam and I love how easy it is! I think the right amount of sweetness is 8 c. rhubarb to the 3 c. sugar and jello, but how much rhubarb you use will depend on personal preference. I also cook it over med-high for 7-8 minutes and put it in plastic containers for freezer jam. Since it doesn't make very much it doesn't sit in the freezer for more than 2 or 3 months, so I'm not sure how long it would be good past that.

I loved this jam - it was a huge hit with everyone who tried it.  I read some reviews that said it was too sweet.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was definately not overly sweet.  I wonder if it has to do with your rhubarb or the region it is grown in.  Alot of fruits, berries, etc, are much, much more tart here in far northern Minnesota than in the rest of the state, perhaps the rhubarb is, too.  I also froze a jar of it and it froze wonderfully - did not change the texture at all.  I am going to make 3 more batches to freeze.

I used the 6c. rhubarb & 2.5 c. sugar, and these quantities made 4 tall, skinny jars of jam. I thought the whole packet of jelly was a bit too much and you lost some of the rhubarb flavour, will use half the packet next time. I also put the hot jam into hot jars and boiled for 10 minutes as recommended. Great taste, good  texture. Will definitely make again, especially when there is a glut of rhubarb.

Great recipe, bery easy.  Since I am an impatient person and didn't want to wait over night, I used a food prosessor to chop up the rhubarb more and then tossed it with sugar.  It juiced in about 30 minutes and the end consistency was great.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I decided to give this recipe a shot just because of the reviews-and I am SO glad I did. It is SO yummy! This is one of two things I have made during my marriage where my husband has said, "this is good, you definitely need to make more of this." I must always have a jar on hand now.   I recommend to anyone who is shy with rhubarb to give it a shot-I am SO glad I did.

I took the advice of others and cut the sugar.  Super yummy, super easy.  I think I added about 4 cups of sugar to my double batch instead of 6, and it was great.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really really really good!  My Hubby absolutely loved it as well.  I made two seperate batches which did not make as much as I thought would.  I think I was able to make 8 jelly jar full.  Although, I did cut back the sugar to like 2 1/2 cups.  It was more like a sauce, but still love it!!!!  Will definately make again, and again!

I lost my grandmother's recipe for this jam a long time ago. Fortunately, this looks to be the same as the one she made when I was younger. When my folks come back home to visit, I send this jam back with my dad. It brings back childhood memories for him also.

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers, this one is sweet.  I doubled the recipe and only used 5 cups of sugar as well, but tasted my syrup after the boil and ran back out the rhubarb patch and put in another 5 stalks to cut down on the sweet.  I will make it again and try only 4 cups of sugar next time.

LOVE IT!  I just finished making a double batch of this jam and I think it is absolutely delicious!  I have added this to my recipe box!  I am so happy I made a double batch because I don't think it is going to last very long.  I did not change a thing to the recipe, other than doubling it!  I ladled it into sterile jars and will be handing this one out to everyone.  Wonderful new recipe for rhubarb!  Afterthought, I think this would be a wonderful dip for Animal Crackers!  YUM!

This is a simple recipe and turned out well with modifications that other reviewers recommended.  I used fresh strawberries and plain jello instead of the strawberry jello.  I also canned hot and left out the refrigeration step.

Taste good with the reduced sugar as per other reviewers. But I prefer it to be more jelly. It's more like a thick fruit sauce than a jam. Update - May 2009 - Tried it again this year and it ended up better and nice bright red like in the picture. Not sure what the difference from last year. The rhubarb? I got some from a lady who has redder rhubarb.

This is the best jam I've ever made!  I made 2 batches of this in mid-August and canned it (approximately 5 pints per batch) and my family has already used half of it.  I guess we won't have it through the winter.  I did make one change, however.  I added 2 cups of crushed fresh strawberries.  I'll be making several batches next year when the rhubarb and strawberries are plentiful and make sure to put enough up for winter.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This Jam is really yummy!!  I doubled the batch so I could have some extra on hand.  I used 10 heaping cups of rhubarb and only 4 cups of sugar.  It was plenty sweet still.  Great recipe to use up lots of rhubarb!  My picky 4 year old loves this jam!!

This is the easiest recipe ever! I have made 4 batches one was a just double my suggestion is not to make a double. It is to much to deal with and manage, stay single..lol. I used another reviewers advice and cut down on the sugar. You can cut down a lot 1.5-2.0 cups I just added some fresh + frozen strawberries and it as perfect. Great recipe very easy and yummy

I have always been intimidated by jam and canning.  This was so easy!  I followed the instructions on this site for canning and every jar sealed.  The jam tastes wonderful!  Cut down the sugar by 1/2 cup and used wild strawberry jello.  Will give as teacher gifts.

Excellent Jam. Very easy to make. I used my emersion blender while the rhubarb was boiling to give it a smoother consistency because my family does not like lumpy jam. It turned out smooth and very tasty. I did find it a bit sweet so I will probably use less sugar next time.

This was my second venture into it and I added fresh strawberries the first time and swapped the strawberry Jello out for orange omg what a delicious thing. My second batch I doubled it added lots of strawberries wow how awesome!!I also cut down on the sugar from 6 cups to 4 when I doubled it. Easy as 123.

too sweet I will use less sugar next time. Some recipe's I saw were 7-8 cups of Rhubarb to 3 cups of sugar. I took this one because it had 5*. I will try the other way next time. It is good but it does have that artificial flavor of Jello but it is better then store bought jam and certainly cheap to make considering my Rhubarb is free.I would call it Redneck strawberry jam:) Hopefully nobody is offended all in fun.

Wanted a jam that was a bit tangy. So I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added an extra cup of the rhubarb and a bit extra jell-o. I also prepared it for regular canning, boiled it on high instead of low. Turned out perfect. I ended up with 6 half pint jars. 

I don't think that it will last very long around our household. This is the best! Thanks.

This was so easy and is really fantastic! I read alot of the reviews before I started and ended up doing 16 cups rhubarb, 6 cups of sugar, and 1 6oz box of strawberry jello. It turned out fantastically tart with a background of sweet/strawberry. 

For those interested, that amt made 12 half pint jars perectly!

VERY SWEET!  DOES HAVE A JELLO TASTE TO IT.  I WAS DISAPPOINTED.  FIND A RECIPE THAT ACTUALLY HAS STRAWBERRIES IN IT. THERE ARE OTHERS THAT ARE JUST AS SIMPLE.  IF YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE THIS CUT WAY BACK ON THE SUGAR!!

Turned out nicely.  My husband and son said they didn't know the strawberry flavor was from jello.  It tasted good but I think next time I will throw a few strawberries in it.

Definatley one of the best jams I have ever had. I did take the advice of many people and cut down on the sugar a bit. I used 2 3/4 cups. My first thought was jam is supposed to be sweet. The decrease in sugar  lets the tangy flavor of the rubarb come through

This is a very easy recipe, and quite yummy. I've had friends bring their jar back for "refills"!! Is a tad on the sweet side, but when I used Splenda in place of half of the sugar, the jam remained pretty runny. Obviously the sugar is important for the "gelling" aspect. It was still tasty, even when runny! Made as the recipe directs (with sugar) it sets up just fine.

Wonderful!  My husband and kids cannot get enough of it.  I followed other reviews and decreased the sugar as well as using only 3/4 of the jellow so it tasted more tart from the rhubarb!  I also pureed the rhubarb as my husband loves the taste of it but hates the stringy texture!  I've made this many times this summer and have a freezer full of it!

Very good, but definitely reduce the sugar.  I, too, added some fresh strawberries to the cooking pot, after the rhubarb had been cooking awhile.  I doubled the recipe, using 12 cups of rhubarb and 5 cups of sugar and that was plenty sweet.  I got twelve one-cup jars (which will be great for gifts) and almost 2 cups leftover for my own fridge.  I did process them for 10 minutes.

This was very yummy, I used more as a sauce in my oatmeal and on ice cream than as a jam.   When making it, I used one cup sugar, one cup sugar substitute, and sugar-free jello.  (Maybe that made a difference in the consistancy.  Not sure.)

This recipe is soooo quick and easy. Like some I used 8 cups of rhubarb with the 3 cups sugar. It is well worth the effort. Thanks Sally for the recipe. This was my first try at jam. I've made about 4 batches and everyone loved it. Its a keeper.

I absolutely loved this!  I have never had anything with rhubarb in it before, and this was great.  I used only two cups of sugar with it because of reviews, and I added frozen strawberries while it was cooking.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is an awesome recipe and I've been passing it along to tons of people. I've tried this by adding real strawberries and also with mango chunks (fresh or frozen) Really any combination will work. Try choosing another flavour of Jello, like orange or rasberry; they all work beautifully. Makes a great gift (delicious on peanut butter/toast.yum yum!)

I would recommend following the recipe's direction to refrigerate the jam right after putting it into sterilized jars. The jam turned out brighter in colour, and more jam-like in consistency. The jam that I processed had the consistency of a thick sauce. Found that both were slightly artificial-smelling, but tasted good.  The recipe (with only 2 cups of sugar)made 3 8oz jars of jam for me.

As long as you cut back on the sugar a bit (I used 2/3 the amount) this is a five star recipe. It is soooo easy and a great way to use that rhubarb without making another pie/crisp.

I'm glad to have read other reviews before trying. I cut the sugar by almost 1/2 and used sugar free generic jello. It's still plenty sweet. Also added 2 C. sliced strawberries. 

Used in a trifle w/ angel food cake, pudding, and cool whip. We didn't have any surviving dessert. Everyone has loved it. 

Thanks for sharing. I am looking forward to making more after our rhubarb grows back. 

I also hot bathed for 20 minutes and they all sealed perfectly.

I'm a jam greenhorn, just needed to use up some rhubarb.  This was FABULOUS! I only put in 1.5 cups of sugar and it was plenty sweet.  I also put my rhuubarb in a blender, instead of leaving it over night I will make it again and again.

This is delicious.  I only added 2 cups of sugar after reading others comments.  I also put it in the food processor before I cooked it for a smooth texture.  I will make this again!

This was a great recipe.  I tryied it once and then repeated the recipe again but this time I only added 1 cup of sugar and both times I used the sugar free strawberry jello.  It is awesome. I will definatly make this again and again. I have lots of Rhubard. Thanks for the great recipe.

I was not to sure about making this, seeing it only called for three ingredients, WOW! What can I say we loved it and I have already made to batches and going to make two more today. I used my food processer instead of letting it sit over night, also cut the sugar down to 2 cups and it was plenty sweet. Thank for such a great and easy recipe!

I made this recipe in the summer. I kept a few jars for myself and gave some to friends. Everyone commented on how good it was. I really enjoy it. It is quite sweet, but not too sweet for my taste. It was also very easy to make. I will definately make this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I added about 2 cups of strawberries with the rhubarb as it cooked, and another 2 cups at the end when you add the jello.  I also used less sugar and it was still a little sweet, so I would probably cut down on the sugar even more next time.

This is great jam!  I chopped the rhubarb pretty small though, because I don't like large chunks of rhubarb, and I cooked it an extra two minutes.  I will definitely make this jam again, and maybe use different flavors of gelatin.

I thought I would try this recipe and for my first jelly recipe, it was extremely easy.  My mom thought it took hours but all total only 45 minutes at the most. It made 8 small jars of jelly.  My family loved it, especially my dad. I used sugar free strawberry and strawberry banana jello.  Very good!

Just a great EASY treat.  I have made 2 batches so far with our bumper crop of Rhubarb.  The second batch I used BLACK CHERRY jello and it was just fabulous.  I have also used Cranberry and Strawberry-Banana Jello with great results.  I added 6+ cups of rhubarb - this is a pretty forgiving recipe.  Try it -you will love it!

I thought this was the easiest recipe.  This was the first time I ever made any type of jam, and even my mother was impressed with the easy receipe.  I was looking for a way besides cobbler to use my neighbors bumper crop of rhubarb.  Thanks! However, if you are going to go through the trouble of making it, I would triple it so I could get more jars of jam at one time.

This is a tasty recipe. I cut the sugar to two cups and added about 1.5 cups of fresh strawberries that I had in the fridge. I passed on the soaking the rhubarb overnight and just pulsed it in the Cuisinart and cooked it at a full rolling boil for about 10 minutes. It is a nice jam consistency. 

BTW, the reviewer who stated you can put the hot jam in a jar and turn it upside down. Don't go there. Just put this jam in the fridge.

This recipe is amazingly easy!  This is my second time making it, as everyone I shared it with asked for more!  First time was fresh fruit and today's was frozen. I let it thaw completely in bowls before I added the sugar.  I used sugar free strawberry jello,  and reduced the regular sugar by a half cup each batch. I also used a potato masher while it was cooking, and the texture is perfect! I made this times 3 (3 batches), and it yielded 22 - 8 oz jars. I also decided to use my roaster to sterilize the lids and jars, worked perfect!  If you follow the directions, you can't miss with this one!!  Love it!!

I prefer things less sweet so after reading the reviews I cut the sugar down to 2 1/2 cups, increased the rhubarb to 6 cups (cause I had tons of fresh rhubarb on hand). I also threw in some strawberries - about 1/2 c sliced - that I had on hand. This turned out VERY sweet even with the changes and no taste of rhubarb at all. Nice color though. Tasted much like strawberry jelly!! I will keep looking for a better recipe.

Loveee This recipe, although like most I made a few adjustments.  Used 5c. of rhubarb, but also added 1c. of strawberries.  Cook it on med - high heat until boils ( takes a while).  Like someone else stated ignore the cook times, just cook until the rhubarb is soft.  Remove from heat, add strawbery jello and mix.  I choose to boils the filled jars, to properly seal them.  Friends that didn't even like rhubarb LOVE THIS JAM!

Really good, but super sweet...I did as others recommended and used 6 cups of rhubarb and only 2.5 cups of sugar but it is still really sweet.  I think that next time I will add less jello mix and add in some fresh strawberries.  It was my first time making jam, so it was a good starting point:)

easy, one pot jam.  This made one container for my fridge and one for the freezer.  It was too sweet for me, even though I reduced the sugar.  And it it tasted too strongly of jello - couldn't really taste the rhubarb at all.

So easy, so awesome! Had rhubarb coming out of my ears and this recipe solved two problems: what to do with the rhubard and what to give for teacher gifts. Gave it to my two daughters' school teachers and dance teachers and everyone loved it. Even my mother-in-law, who is a cook and a canner, raved!

This was the easiest jam I had ever made. I used only 2 1/2 cups of sugar and it was sweet enough. Made my first batch 2 days ago and it is gone already. Will make again and again. Was a big hit even with the mother-in-law.

You can't get any easier than this & it tastes great. I used 1/2 sugar 1/2 splenda & also added some strawberries & a few blueberries also. It turned out great. I will definitely make this jam again. It's a great way to use up rhubarb.

Before finding this recipe I was paying over $5 for a half pint of sugar free strawberry rhubarb jam at the craft fairs. I'd have to wait until the fair came around again before I could get more. But NOW I can make it myself at home anytime I want and it tastes great. I use splenda and add chopped strawberries to the rhubarb about six minutes to the end of the cook time,I like the chunks of strawberry in it. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I doubled the recipe and only used 5 cups of sugar after reading some of the other reviews.  After I put in the Jello I added about 2 cups of frozen blueberries that I bought fresh when they were on sale and put them in my freezer. What a hit it was with every one that I gave a bowl to.  It was the best jam I've ever made.  Thanks... Carol, Allen Park, MI

I just finished making this.  Yes - it is simple and doubles easily.  I, however, don't like the taste.  (I used Wild Strawberry jello).  It is artificial tasting.  I am going to try it again w/ a different jello (maybe cherry) because I have ALOT of rhubarb.    One nice thing about this recipe is that it keeps the rhubarb suspended throughout the whole jar -  when I made straw-rhubarb Jam w/ real strawberries and pectin all the bits of fruit floated to the top.

Easy to make, tastes great but is quite sweet.  Would make again.  This is a great way to use up some of that rhubarb.  Plus, my kids love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, so this is perfect.  Thanks!

I wish I could give this 10 stars!  Excellent recipe and very quick and easy to make.

I did make one change - I pureed the mixture just after it started to warm up on the stove.  This made for an excellent consistency.  I brought a jar to work this morning and it's already gone.

My Mom has made this in the past and this summer she could not find the recipe but I went to your site and there it was. This is the best jam there is. Make it with the old fashion rolls recipe and you will be in heaven.

Very good recipe, I made it this morning. However I think next time I'll either try adding only 2-1/2 c. of sugar or maybe use sugar free jell-o as it seemed a little too sweet for my liking. Very easy however :-) Oh also I used strawberry banana as that is the only jell-o I had in the house(except pineapple or lime).

I have made this 3 times now.  I've made 3 small bottles each time.  I've reduced it to 2 cups of sugar.  I read from others that 3 cups is too much.  I agree.  Even with just 2 cups of sugar it is still very sweet.  This jam is excellent and a real treat.  I only grow a small amount of rhubarb and every bit of it goes towards making this jam which I eat every morning for breakfast.

So I am not a purist. I made this and discovered I had cherries on the verge and had not picked enough rhubarb but... I used the 4 cups of rhubarb and 1 cup of pitted fresh cherries. Oh, Yum! Then I did not use strawberry gelatin, I used sugar free cherry flavored!! Heavenly. We had some last night melted a bit and poured over ice cream... Making it with strawberries today.

I made this yesterday and it tastes SO good! It takes a while to make because you have to let it sit over night but it is worth the wait. I put the rhubarb and the sugar into a large pot and put it on high heat until it bubbles then put it on low heat for a little more than 12 mins and then put the dry jell-o mix in and put it in jars the next day I tried some and I was so glad I made it. I will    definitely make this jam again. PS- When cutting up the rhubarb make sure to cut it up into very small pieces. I think this helps make it a more smooth jam and not so thick. I hope this helps!

Super Easy!! I really loved this jam!  I'm not a fan when people change the recipe, but... I did add 1# of fresh chopped strawberries, and I did boil the jam for the 5 minutes on high heat instead of the 12 minutes on low heat (this just made more sense to me to kill bacteria and for setting)  I didn't cut the sugar  because I added the pound of fresh berries, otherwise I would have.  ( sugar in jam is a matter of preference, like salt on steak.  We like sweet, just not super sweet).  The texture and the taste of this jam is amazing.  My family and I loved it, and did I mention how easy it was?  I just wish it could be hot water bathed so it doesn't have to be frozen.  But I guess you can't have it all  ;D  

I am going to try peach next.  I will let you know how it turns out.

Very sweet! Really like it though. I chopped 3c of rhubarb along with less than a cup of sugar and did not let it sit over night because if you do it will loose that wonderful tart taste rhubarb offers. Medium heat until boiling and then 6 minutes on low boil and 6 minutes on high boil. Once I turned it to high I added half a cup of fresh strawberry. Then 1 Tbs of strawberry gelatin once off high heat. Then I canned my regular way.

I have made this many times with and for my Mom who loved jam and loved rhubarb. We did try many other flavors of Jello also. We decided we liked the Raspberry best but the Strawberry and other s were also good. We did cut down on the sugar a bit.

It is simple and it is quick but if you do not like the distinctive taste of Jell-O, you will not like this recipe.
By the way, as many others have noted, the amount of sugar can be reduced by half.

I do love this recipe. I started canning just last year, so I am pretty new to it, and this was so easy, I wanted try try making jam again! Anyone I give this to loves the flavour as well. I made as called for, except that when cooking I used a potatoe masher to help work the chunks down to a smoother spreading jam. I also sterilized and water bathed the jars so I could keep them longer, as I have tons of rhubarb to use up. If you are afraid of it being too sweet, use more of the green parts of the stalk. Enjoy!

Excellent on pancakes etc.  I used 1 cup extra of frozen, chopped rhubarb.  No changes.  The kids like it and I have frozen the extra jars for later.  Only one child (8 yrs) said it was too sweet.  Hmmmm......  I like it and will make it again.

Simple but delicious.  I use 2-1/2 cups sugar and have experimented with different types of strawberry jello. Excellent!!!

This jam is soooo good! I didn't have any rhubarb, so instead I used 2 x 250gram punnets of strawberries chopped in my food processer and put them into a 4 cup measure jug and added cranberry juice until the total amounts reached 4 cups. It made the most delicious jam. Light, sweet, kind of tart and so amazing.

Excellent recipe and super easy.  It IS sweet--I think you could easily cut down on the sugar and not sacrifice the taste.  It  made 4 small jelly jars.  I will be making this again and again!

This recipe was easy and it turned out soooo tasty! It is a good recipe for the novice jam and jelly makers like me. It didn't make many jars, though, so if you're making it as gifts you might want to try doubling the recipe.

This was a great way to use up the rhubarb in my yard. The kids loved it, my neighbors loved it, and even my neighbor's 3 year old next door it and wouldn't believe it was rhubarb!  
Thanks for this great recipe!

I love this recipe. I doubled it to 10 cups of combined strawberry and rhubarb frozen from my own garden months earlier. I used 4.5 cups of sugar and a 6 ounce strawberry jello. 

Letting the berries and rhubarb stand in the sugar overnight proved essential. The sugar becomes a fruity liquid in that time whereas even 6 hours after mixing them the sugar was still noticeably granular at the bottom of the pot.

I let the hot jam seal the jars and did not pressure process. I got 6 small jam jars (all I had that day) and one mostly full quart that went straight into the fridge for use. SO good!

I do love the recipe, but it is too sugary.  What a great idea to add Strawberry Jello to the rhubarb.  It's very tasty.  When I made it, I reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  Next time I will go down to 2 or maybe even 1 1/2 cups.

I followed the recipe except for substituting 1 1/2 cups of Truvia baking blend for the sugar. It came out too sweet and way too thick/hard. I don't think it was the Truvia as I've used it successfully in the past for similar recipes.

I followed some of the suggestions to reduce the sugar and it was still too sweet. Next time I will add pectin and lemon juice to add zing and a jam quality. I cooked it down and it still turned out more like syrup than jam.

I doubled the batch and cut the sugar to 4 cups. I put in a water bath for 10 min and sealed the lids. My in- laws have already taken 3 jars and think it’s the best thing ever. Going to try raspberry next.

I just made this but used 10 cups rhubarb, 2 cups sugar, 1 large box strawberry jello and 20 oz can crushed pineapple, drained. 
I cut rhubarb and added sugar and let it sit overnight, then added the pineapple and jello and brought to boil and cooked for 15 minutes stirring frequently to prevent sticking. 
Processed in water bath for 10 minutes and jars sealed immediately after removing.  Will definitely make again

I used equal amounts of rhubarb and strawberries and substituted 2 1/2 cups of Splenda for the sugar. To the rhubarb and Splenda I added 1/4 cup white balsamic vinegar and cooked until rhubarb was soft then added chopped strawberries. After a 5 minute rolling boil, I added 2 tablespoons finely chopped basil.  Then poured into hot mason jars (yield 3 x 1 cup jars). Taste prior to putting into jars. Next time I would cut the Splenda to 2 cups as the addition of jello powder adds sweetness (I used sugar free). I would've tried lemon or pineapple jello but only had strawberry on hand.  I too processed in a hot water bath. Tasted yummy with lemon rhubarb scones and clotted cream for a quite bite on a wedding day morning!

Super-easy to make. Thanks!

One problem: as others have said, it's way too sweet. I cut the sugar in half, and it was excellent (and still sweet).

Another: the final product tastes more like jello than strawberries. Others have suggested adding some real strawberries. I didn't do that because our local berries are not ready for a few weeks, but I suspect this is a good idea.

2 c rhubarb,  1/2 pkg pectin, simmered 12mins and mushed. Added 1 cup sugar, 1 cup strawberries, and 1/4 pkg strawberry jello. Simmered 5 mins.  Ladled into hot jars, then simmered under near-boiling water for 10 mins to seal the jars. Cooled 24hrs and lids sealed while cooling.  Tried the next morning- too sweet. Made strawberry banana this am, 2 c strawberries, 1 c bananas, and only 1/2 cup sugar. Next time get the pink box of low-sugar recipe pectin.

I love, love, love this recipe!  It is so easy to make.  I make it every summer and this year am going to give it for Christmas gifts!   One suggestion I do have, is to cut the sugar by 1/4  to 1/2.  It really doesn't need that much to work.

Fantastic jam. Is very sweet so I increased my rhubarb to 6 cups (thawed from frozen) and reduced the sugar to 2.5 cups. I also put the juice of 1 lemon to add some tartness and it turned out fabulous. I will be using this recipe for years to come.

*As a tip, if you are using frozen rhubarb, thaw in the refrigerator previous to making jam, this cuts down the sugar soaking time. I only soaked my rhubarb and sugar for 3-4 hours. Cheers!

I have made several batches of this recipe and it is a big hit with my family and friends.  I don't let the fruit and sugar sit overnight as stated in the instructions, but I do cook it a little longer (about 20 minutes) in order to break the fruit down as much as possible -- it turns out really well.

Love the recipe!  Very easy.  I, like most here, adjusted the recipe to include:
2 1/4 cups cubed rubarb
1 1/4 cups sugar (probably could have been less - even 3/4 cup)
2 cups fresh strawberries
1 3 oz. pkg. of strawberry jello
My son has been calling this "rootbeer" jelly since he could talk! :-)

I have been making this recipe for years now and I love it. I use it interchangeably with all fruit. Sometimes I use strawberries, raspberries, any and sometimes I change the jello out too. I have made strawberry watermelon jam using watermelon jello and strawberry raspberry using raspberry jello. It’s fun and yummy to try new things. Occasionally your jam will be runny but that’s mainly if you use frozen berries. But even if it’s runny you can still eat it. My kids use it on waffles, ice cream, pancakes, eggs, toast, etc.
