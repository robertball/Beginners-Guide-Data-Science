I wanted something lite and easy to make. Originally thought my husband would hate. The only change I made was spicy Italian sausage. Was a  breeze to make and my husband devoured it. He also said it's a keeper.

Made as written except that I left out the butter. It wasn't needed. Good recipe and one I would make again.
