Creamy and delicious - comfort food at it's best! Plus, it's a great way to use up some leftover evaporated milk. I added a little garlic and onion powders to give this a little pizzaz, but other than that this is your basic recipe for really good mashed potatoes - perfect with your favorite gravy!

Wow, these taste even better than I expected!  We had them with Adobo Sirloin from this site and plain green beans, and my husband says he wants this meal as often as I'll make it!  I cut up the potatoes before boiling, and they were soft enough to mash easily with a hand masher after 15 minutes -- just enough time to make the rest of the meal.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent mashed potatoes.  I used the fat-free evaporated milk and felt less guilty!  I also made "dirty mashed potatoes" by leaving the peeling on adding fiber and flavor.  My daughter loves them this way and I always say, "the dirtier they are, the better they taste!".

These were just ok.  They didn't taste like anything special and got a wierd shiny sheen on top.  I probably won't make them again- but it was a good use of leftover evaporated milk.  As long as your gravy/sauce is tasty enough, they're ok.  I served these with Jagerschnitzel from this site.

Ever since I was a little girl, this is how my mom, my mom's mom and my mom's mom's mom has made mashed potatoes. There is something exquisite about them. I have now hooked my boyfriend and his parents on this simple way of making potatoes to come home to. I have found that the best mashed "evaporated milk" potatoes come from small smooth red potatoes. Definitely a must try and maybe they will become part of your traditions as well!

I thought these were very good, but so are potatoes with whipping cream instead of milk! Check my other reviews for recipies that are doubled-I have a big family

I have been making poatatoes like this for years except I use whole milk. I don't think the evaporated milk made my potatoes any creamier. I asked my husband if they tasted different and he said they tasted the same as always. So the extra money on a can of evaporated milk was not worth the extra money. I will stick to whole milk.

I thought these were very good mashed potatoes. I've never really cooked with evaporated milk, but I was pleased with the results. I added the chopped green onion ontop.

These sure came out creamy! I used small red potatoes, and left the skins on. Next time, I will probably add a little less evaporated milk because I like them a little more lumpy. This is an excellent starter recipe, but be warned - this makes them REALLY creamy ;)

Oh, these were so yummy. I used a little more butter than the recipe called for and then when I went to put the evaporated milk in I found that I didn't need the full cup. These turned out delicious. Of course, I had to add garlic powder ;-) Served this with the maple - mustard pork loin and glaze recipe from this site and green beans with bacon fat, salt and pepper. We won't talk about our cholesterol level today!

These came out absolutely perfect....I used 2% Carnation for the 1st time and they taste just wonderful. I also warmed up the milk in the microwave and I think it helped because everything just melted. They are perfect and very smooth.

Great, easy recipe for mashed potatoes. Very yummy, husband and kids LOVED them! I did use a little less evaporated milk because we like them a bit lumpy. :) Excellent if you're a "beginner" to cooking from scratch! (I am)

So yummy! Used red potatoes w/skin and 2% evaporated milk and fiancee said they were the best he's had. First time trying to make mashed potatoes, and Ive found a keeper!

I did not need the full cup of evaporated milk called for. I warmed it and just added it until the potatoes were the consistancy I was looking for. I served this with my Mom's Salisbury Steak and it was the ultimate comfort food. Next time, I'd like to add some roasted garlic. YUM! NOTE: I did use fat free evaporated milk.

Good, simple, gravy-ready potatoes. I will always use this recipe for plain mashed potatoes going forward.

This is a really good basic/starter recipe. You can add so much and it will still taste great. I've tried with Chicken Broth as a substitute for the Evaporated milk and although it is still good, it's not as creamy. DH loves Parsley and extra butter in it. It's so simple to make, definitely worth a try.

Very rich and creamy.  Delish.  Pour the milk little at a time to avoid a loose and watery dish.  Cut the potatoes small to ensure that they become soft.  It was better than what I imagined.

These were good, but not worth 5 stars.  I overbeat mine though and think they might have been worthy of 4 stars if I hadn't.  Definietly better with evaporated milk though.

I scaled this down to 2 servings.  I did add all the evaporated milk and wished I hadn’t.  These turned out a little too “loose” for me.  I also added a little more butter and used white pepper.  Pretty good, just add the milk until you get the consistency you’re looking for.

I kept the potatoes warm in the oven in a metal bowl. They were ready earlier than expected my company to arrive. They were still warm when I mashed them, but I also warmed the evaporated milk on the stove to make the potatoes hot again. Very good!

This was amazing! The first time it came out as an disaster only because I didn't cook the potatoes long enough. But the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, time was the best! I added parmasean and cheddar....so it turned out really cheesy and yummy! This recipe is also really simple, so my family loves it!

This is your recipe if you like thick, creamy, rich mashed potatoes.  Not for those who like light and fluffy. :)

A yummy way of serving mash, but I can't imagine mash ever being bad - it's such a comforting food!
Served with Crumbed Avocado Steak from this site and fresh green beans.

Grew up with Mom making mashed potatoes this way.  She would also add a pinch of sugar to the potatoes.  Good memories!

came out great! added 3 whole garlic cloves with the potatoes while they boiled.  Made the garlic very soft and easy to mix with potatoes.  Very good!

Very smooth and creamy, although I did not put as much milk in as the recipe called for. I doubled the potatoes and used a 12 oz can of fat free evaporated milk.

I brought these potatoes to a pot-luck supper and got rave reviews!  This was excellent praise since these were seasoned cooks who were there.  This is a real winner.

Rich but very good and just as easy as regular mashed potatoes. Kids loved it.
