I used this recipe different to what it was intended for.  Instead of combining it all as a dish, I layered the recipe between whole wheat bagels.  I still combined the cream cheese and sour cream, spread it on bagel and put in a toaster oven.  Once the bagels were toasted I layered the rest of the recipe on top of the mixture.  It kinda came-out like a lox bagel with a twist.  We serve it for brunch and everyone was blown away with it.  They kept guessing what's in it that made the difference - they couldn't tell.   Thank you for sharing your recipe with us.

I'm not a fan of smoked salmon, so I made this expressly for Hubs, since the classic smoked salmon, cream cheese, bagel, tomato and capers platter is one of his all-time favorites. I prepared this much like "Dotts" - on a toasted bagel rather than the pita, and not heated.  I also added some fresh dill. Hubs was in Smoked Salmon Pizette heaven.

This recipe was pretty good.  Kind of a different take on the lox bagel.  I served these as mini-bagels.  The spread was kind of runny at first but firmed up in the fridge overnight.  Next time I will toast the bagels separately instead of baking them with the spread on, I was not fond of that.

This was a very interesting dish. Not what we would typically make but it was pretty good. We used salmon we had bought fresh and smoked at home. Yum! If you are a somewhat adventurous cook and eater, it is definitely worth a try!

I'm not a big fan of smoked salmon (nor capers actually) but these were pretty good. Like others, I made them with toasted mini bagels. I agree though that the sour cream is a bit overwhelming - I'll cut way back next time.

There are some wonderful taste combinations here, which are unfortunately completely overpowered by sour cream. We're contemplating a sour creamless version.

I made this for brunch and everyone loved it.  We used whole wheat as well as white.  Definitely a favorite.  Just remember to toast the tops of the bagel as well.  So yummy.

This was Fabulous! I ended up serving it with the pitas on the side, but it still was very good.
