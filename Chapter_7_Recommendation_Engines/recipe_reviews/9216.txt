The texture was pretty good and the pie held together well when cut and looked nice.  The flavor wasn't bad and I definitely like the whole sugar free thing but it just wasn't very sweet at all.  If I made this again, I'd add more of the artificial sweetener or maybe even a little real sugar.

My dad is visiting for Christmas and is a diabetic and has other health issues so I really try to be careful what I make for him.  It isn't easy to find something tasty.  This was wonderful.  I recommend this to anyone that has to control their sugars...even dieters.

Made this at Thanksgiving for the diabetics in my family and they all loved it. It tastes just as good as the regular version.

If you are looking for the world's best pumpkin pie, this isn't it.  It is however a great sugarless pumpkin pie. 
 
The texture is much lighter and fluffier than regular pumpkin pie -almost more like a heavy mousse than a custard.  (I assume this has to do with using powdered milk rather than condensed milk which you can't use if you want the pie to be sugar-free.)  

As another reviewer mentioned the pie is not very sweet.  This is true, but I kinda like that. I'd rather have the sweetness come from the whipped cream.  

The flavor is going to depend very heavily on what pumpkin spice blend you use.  The recipe I used (from Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book) was a little too stong on the ginger and maybe the nutmeg for such a light pie: 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I also grated the fresh nutmeg over the top of the pie as the recipe directs but I found this to be too strong especially as nutmeg is rather bitter by itself and this isn't a very sweet pie.  I will leave it off next time.

Overall this pie was pretty good.  I made two for a work party that had more than enough pumpkin pie and one of the pies disappeared entirely with only good things about it.  I may try a recipe that uses evaporated milk next time to see how it compares.  However, since I had none on hand this time this recipe was perfect for me!

I made this with Splenda and thought the consistancy was very similar to real pumpkin pie.  I've made it twice now.  I'm still using 1/3 cup Splenda but, the last time I added a little Sugar Twin brown sugar substitute and it turned our well.

While this pie was ok, it certainly wasn't as sweet as regular pumpkin pie. The main thing that bothered me about it was its appearance. It just didn't have an even color all across the top of the pie. However, I'm sure a diabetic or someone watching their weight would really enjoy having a slice of this somewhat sweet treat.

Loved this pie filling recipe but I used the large can of pumpkin, replaced dry milk with 1 can 2% condensed milk and used Splenda brown sugar (1/2 cup).  I will make this again!

I've read the other reviews and do agree that this pumpkin pie is less sweeter than its sugar-laden counterpart. I will be putting more sweetener in it next time around, or consider using a sweetener more suited to baking.

The texture isnt "custardy" like a normal pumpkin pie, rather its more like a heavy mousse. I didn't mind this however. I had issues with cracking over the top, I have read that baking at a lower temperature might help, or avoid mixing in too many air bubbles into the filling.

For a sugarless and diabetic-friendly pumpkin pie, it was still very good.

Granted it wasn't as sweet as a regular sugar pie but it was ok. It was not the best but not the worst either.
