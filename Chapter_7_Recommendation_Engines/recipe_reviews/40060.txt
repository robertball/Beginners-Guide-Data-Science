This is my new fave gelatin recipe because it's so easy to prepare, pretty to look at and delicious! I used raspberry Jello and powdered reconstituted buttermilk and it was still great. 

A quick tip--you don't need to cool completely/let it set up in between additions. Cook the pineapple, add the Jello, and you can immediately add the buttermilk. As soon as it's cool enough to not melt the Cool Whip you can put it all together. I put it in a small/med oiled mold which was a mistake--this makes enough for a 13"x9" pan. However, the mold looked great!

All in all, this is a great recipe, thanks for sharing it!

Unbelievably easy to make.  Light and fluffy, yet molded nicely.  I used Raspberry-Cranberry jello instead of peach.  I also used Fat Free whipped topping to cut calories.  Personally, I do not like buttermilk, but there is not even a hint of the taste in this salad.  Will use this recipe a lot in the future.  Thank you, Deb, for sharing.

Deb, Thanks so much for contributing this recipe.  I used to make this years ago and couldn't find my old recipe.  It is EXCELLENT!  Don't tell the family it is made with buttermilk and they'll never, ever know!  Happy Holidays!

My husband saw this recipe and said no way would he eat anything with buttermilk in it.  But I went ahead and made it for a family dinner and didn't tell anyone else what was in it and they gobbled it up.  Very good and very easy.  I hate buttermilk myself but thought I would give this a try and glad I did.  But like everyone else says, don't tell anyone what's in it or they won't eat it.  I did talk my husband into tasting it and he admitted it was very good.

I made this for Mother's Day dinner.  My husband said it was the best jello salad he has ever eaten.
The rest of the family raved and wanted the recipe.  No one could believe there was buttermilk in the recipe.  This is a keeper.

This is a wonderful tangy, refreshing recipe.  My daughter hates Jello and would never have anything to do with a recipe with buttermilk in its name, but I gave her a taste of this salad and she loves it.

I liked the flavor, but it looks like....well, I won't name it, so it didn't go over well with my family.  Guess I'll just have to eat the rest of it myself!  If you don't happen to have buttermilk on hand, you can "make" buttermilk by adding one tablespoon of white vinegar to each cup of milk required----let it sit for a few minutes before adding to your recipe.

This is the second time I've made this salad. Ready to put in the jello and realize I bought .3 oz of peach jello. So, I mixed a 3 oz box of cranberry and a 3 oz box of lime. It ROCKED and everyone liked it....Plus the pink color was much more attractive that the "yellow" color it was last time. I'm thinking now you can use any flavor jello (or mixtures) you want. Next time I'm going to add chopped pecans for crunch.

Just the right flavor for my husband but I waited until after he finished a large serving before informing him about the buttermilk. I have used different combinations of gelatin flavors and fruit and think I like the orange gelatin and mandarin oranges best. This salad is the reason I now always keep buttermilk.

This has long been one of my favorite recipes.  It can be altered according to season.  Make as is for a lovely springtime salad.  Or use raspberry jello and a can of cranberries for a beautiful Thanksgiving or Christmas dish.  For a healthier alternative try low-fat buttermilk and fat free Cool Whip. They don't change the flavor at all.  Be creative!  It's delicious!

WOW! This is delicious!  I lightened it up with FF Whip Cream, Sugar Free Jello and it still tasted awesome.  It was only 2 Weight Watcher points for a big serving!!!  My 6 year old daughter who never eats had seconds and asked me to make it again!!! Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

I've been making this for awhile - great recipe.  I change the type of jello for each season (ie. cranberry jello for Christmas, orange for Halloween, etc.).  It's always a hit and disappears very quickly.

Very easy to make, can be modified by type of gelatin and the addition of nuts.  Even folks who express their hate for buttermilk will be singing a new tune when they eat this light, fluffy, cloud of a sidedish/dessert.

This was very good and I will definitely make it again!  However it isn't very "pretty" so I will serve it with fresh peach slices as garnish on top.

the buttermilk gives this salad a little zip, but i thought it was overall a pretty boring salad with just crushed pineapple.  i would add some mandarin oranges and red grapes if i were to make it again.  used peach jello. thanks for the recipe.

The peach jello dominated and this was not an overall success. We decided if there is a pineapple jello (?), that would be better.

This is an out of this world recipe. This is the exact recipe that my great aunt made since the 40's. If you can taste the buttermilk in this, you have either done something wrong or you have problems with tasting. Everytime I make this I have people asking me for the recipe. This is a fool proof recipe if you follow the direction to a "T".

I've been making this recipe for years.. the only difference is I add the buttermilk after the Jello is dissolved in the pan, then put the saucepan in the refrigerator for about 45 minutes to thicken, then fold in the Cool Whip...then into a pyrex bowl, covered, to set for 4 hours in the refrigerator.. It depends on the ''season'' as to what flavor Jello I use. At Thanksgiving or Christmas, I'll use 'Cranberry' flavor...It's always a great salad & goes quickly. Yummmy!

So good and incredibly simple to make. The only slight change I made was to add just a couple of drops of red food coloring to make it more colorful.

Very easy and tastes great!  I did not tell anyone that it  had buttermilk until it was gone...which did not take very long!  Everyone loved it.  One substitution....my grocery store did not have either apricot or peach jello, so I used orange!

Yummy!  I made half a batch and used strawberry Jell-o.  It was quite tasty, much better than plain Jell-o.  I may even try to make it without the fruit (but add fruit juice) so it's smooth because my fiance wasn't a huge fan of the pineapple.  It would be like a mousse without the pineapple.  I will definitely make this again!

This is fantastic.  I'm not much of a jello salad fan & every year my husband wats one for Thanksgiving & Christmas dinners.  Last year I tried this at Christmas & it was a HUGE hit.  There was very little leftover & what there was left over was gone the next day!  I'm making it for Thanksgiving this year .....and probably Christmas too...thanks for saving me from trying a hundred other salads :)

Pretty good. I used sugar-free jello, so it had a slightly different taste to it. I think the recipe's name should be changed though, for the sake of potential tasters.

This was absolutely delicious.  I couldn't find apricot gelatin, but the peach was really nice.  This worked quite well for small greased molds so I imagine it would work well for a big mold.  This one's a keeper.

This is delicious. I only had one 3-ounce box of peach jello so I added a 3-ounce box of raspberry as well. I only had vanilla flavored cool whip on hand but it worked fine. I added a can of drained mandarin oranges as well. This was great!

Great salad.  We love most all recipes made with jell-o and this was no exception.  I made a half of batch with peach jell-o as I couldn't find apricot.  So, since I still have half a can of pineapple and half a container of cool whip, I'm going to make another flavor this weekend.  Thanks Deb for a delicious recipe.

Yummy!  The buttermilk is a great addition.  This recipe lends itself well to a variety of flavor and fruit combinations.  I'll serve it often.

This was GREAT!! Everyone loved it. I did make some changes as others suggested. I used lime and cherry jello (to give it a different color) I also added 1/2 cup of walnuts. I had NO leftovers. I will be using this recipe again and again!

Quite yummy! I added walnuts to give it some texture and substituted a 7 oz canister of whipped cream for the Cool Whip. I wouldn't really call it salad as it's sweet and more like dessert to me.

I made this for a family gathering and everyone loved it. I asked them to guess the ingredients. No one could guess the buttermilk. I am going to try this with different flavors of jello. My husband loves jello salads/desserts, so I am trying new recipes. Thanks, for this one. I will use this one over and over.

This is a great recipe and wonderfully easy to make.  I used orange jello and it was excellent.  There's nothing gourmet about Jello...but I'll tell ya, my family loves it whenever I make it, so what the heck...have some Jello tonight!  This recipe is delish!

My whole family LOVED this salad. It also LOOKS beautiful when served unmolded. It is delicious and an absolute must have in your recipe box. The directions are perfect too; we used apricot jello at my 4 year old daughter's request.

This is a delicious recipe!!! It's tangy and just a little sweet and the pineapple adds nice texture and flavor. I used peach gelatin and added marshmallows. This is definitely a keeper!

Refreshing spring/summer taste addition to meal. Don't like buttermilk, but cannot taste it at all.  Unfortunately I only had small 3 ounce box of sugar-free peach gelatin, so added 3 ounce box of lemon. Also used sugar free whipped topping.  Even with these changes, it was great.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe. I used apricot jello (w/sugar)and lite cool whip. Next time I'm going to try sugar free jello and fat free cool whip.... what a great, low-cal salad to have in my refrigerator all summer. Thanks for the post!

I love this salad.  I made it with mango jello & would love to make it with the pina colada jello if it were available more than seasonally.  It is super easy to make & is good for a salad or dessert.  It does not taste like buttermilk at all.  My salad set up more like a jello than the creamy version in the picture.  9-8-13 - I've made this with one 3-oz package of pineapple Jell-O & one 3-oz package of tropical Jell-O mixed together & this is my favorite flavor combination so far.

Used peach jello.  Was absolutely delicious.  And so very easy.  DH and I fought over the last bit.  Then we went out next day to buy ingredients to make more.  Thanks for sharing.

This is very tasty, however, mine did not set up properly.  It was a little runny.  The only thing I did differently was to use sugar-free Jell-o.  Still worth 5 stars!

This was so good. The buttermilk gave it a tangy flavor. I made this for my son's birthday party and everyone loved it.  This would be a great dish to have during the summer, too. I will be keeping this for sure.

I needed to double the recipe, was extremely good and was surprising to me that it set up completely.  Took to a salad luncheon and it was gone.

I did make this but did have a can of mandarin oranges that I added when I added the whipped topping.  It was really very good!  Will definitely make it again, easy and good.

My Mother loves this, I added a cup of coconut to it and that's it. She grew up in the 50s and says this is what her Mother made. A neighbor made this for her when she was ill and it was one of the few things she would eat, she couldn't remember what she put in it, and I racked my brain trying to find this simple recipe, thank you to the person who submitted it! It made my Mom happy & that makes me happy!

I made it a little bit lighter by using sugar free jello & light cool whip. Amazing. Light & refreshing...

This to me is like a nother version of Watergate salad --except no marshmellows and anything extra.    It was good.  Husband liked it.  I do believe it could be made with any kind of gelatin flavor-- I do think a more vibrant color one would have been more of a pretty presentation.  Personally I thought it a tad to sweet  BUT husband thought it perfect  --so --everybody has a different taste.     I made it as a dessert -because I was wanting something light  and thought this might fit.   It is perfect as a dessert!!!

Took this salad to an Easter brunch and it was a huge hit! I added toasted pecans for a little crunch.

I read the recipe wrong and only added a 3 ounce box of jello.  It turned out perfect!  It was not runny but it had a more mild taste since I didn't use 6 ounces of jello.  Everyone raved and was surprised that there was no buttermilk flavor detected.  The second time I made it I used a can of mandarin oranges, 3 ounces of orange jello and we ran out of buttermilk at 1 1/3 cups, so I added 2/3 cup of regular milk.  It still turned out good and set up fine, but not as rich as the original recipe.  We thought the orange flavor was a bit strong.  Tomorrow we'll make it again using this recipe exactly as written.  It's amazing!!!!  My husband can't get enough of it which is good because it's healthier than some other rich deserts.

2 cups of buttermilk was a bit too much. The salad did not set firm even after 8 hours. It set enough for scooping but went runny on the plate. I believe less of the milk would help. It was very tasty but I doubt I'll make it again. Also, add something at the stage when you fold in the whipped topping, like chopped nuts or diced strawberries or seedless grapes.

Interesting idea but this dish was lacking something. It was bland, overly sweet and too citrusy for my liking.

Tried this recipe for my birthday celebration. Thought it sounded strange but I figured I would give it a try. Made double the recipe and used peach and mango jello. Huge hit and everyone wanted the recipe. Husband thought it was coconut and was enjoying it until he overheard the word buttermilk. After the initial shock he let his taste buds overrule and really enjoyed his dessert. Cant wait to try with other flavors and maybe nuts!

Love the buttermilk. It was quite sweet though, so next time I plan to try the smaller box of Jell-o.

Make sure you use the larger Jello packet. I didn't and it didn't gel like it should have but the flavor is fantastic.

I ran across this recipe a few years ago when putting together our Turkey Day menu. Our family has made it every year since. It is simple, and so so yummy!! This year I am switching the pineapple for marnderine oranges. I'm sure it will be just as yummy.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  I used the peach jello.  It really was just ok.  Nothing special.
