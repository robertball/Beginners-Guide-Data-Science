Delicious! Per other reviewers' suggestions, I made a couple of minor changes: used 2 cans tuna, used only about 1/4 C milk, added dried chopped onion, garlic powder, salt and pepper, 1 C cheese, and about 1/4 C breadcrumbs to the mixture (I used italian breadcrumbs in place of the crushed croutons). After pouring into casserole dish, I sprinkled with about 1/2 cup cheese 1/4 cup breadcrumbs. BF and I ate the whole thing- will definitely make again.

I made this twice...first time as directed, and I found it pretty bland. The second time, I used shells instead of elbows, stirred the cheese in with the mixture, and added 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp pepper. MUCH better! Boyfriend raved...with minor renovations, this recipe is a keeper!

tasty comfort food.  Works as well using leftover cooked chicken, turkey, or pork instead of tuna

I personally hate any fish, but with this casserole and plenty of extra cheese on top I can eat it :P  My family loves this recipe but i do make a few minor changes.  I use either mac or egg noodles depending on what i have and it works great either way, i use about 1/4 of the can of milk, and 2 cans of tuna.  Also i season it with garlic and italian seasoning.  Also since i usually have no croutons I use italian breadcrumbs and of course tons of cheese.  Also I throw in frozen veggies when i cook the pasta and mix them in too.  Yum :D

Yum!  We'll be making this again; even my husband who's not a big tuna cass. fan liked it.  My grandma always took the fishy-ness out of the tuna by soaking it in a few tsp of worshestire sauce.  I also used an earlier suggestion of adding sauteed celery, onion and red pepper.  Topped with chips instead of croutons--this was delicious!

This was great! I had never made whole wheat croutons before but they were a must for this dish. I usually try the recipe as written at least once but I couldn't help but throw in some peas with onion pearls. Yum!

I used cream of chicken soup as a substitute, whole wheat shells and half the milk and Garlic butter croutons.  I recommend putting the cheese and croutons on the last 10 minutes so that they don't get over done after you bring them out of the oven!

It's not bad for a quick meal, although I made a couple of changes. First off, I added diced green onion (If not, I would have added diced onion) I also seasoned it with a teaspoon of pepper, a teaspoon of celery salt, and half a pinch of dry mustard. When I transfered everything to the baking dish, I topped it off with parmesian/romano and then bread crumbs (since i didn't have crutons). It was deeeelicious!

This was a pretty good recipe. I used 2 cups of Wacky Mac spiral pasta. I also added artichoke hearts and it was good.  I wasn't usre if the canned milk was condensed or evaporated so I just poured regular milk until it was  a creamy consistancy.  I also mixed bread crumbs and the cheese in the mix as well as a little on top. I would make this again.

My family really liked this.  It's super simple and very tasty.  I used slightly less milk, as per the reviews of others. I think the full measure of milk would have made it too watery.

Came out great but I made a few adjustments.  Used 4c. egg noodles, 2 6 oz cans of tuna, cream of chicken soup, just a splash or two of milk, and crushed Stove Top stuffing for the topping.  I also mixed in some celery seed, pepper & seasoned salt.  I threw a handful of shredded cheese into the mixture as well.  Made a few hours ahead and refrigerated, so I baked for 30 minutes at 350, then added the stuffing and cheese topping (cheese on top of stuffing so it doesn't burn or get too crispy) and baked another 10 minutes.  Will make again.  Thanks.

I doubled the tuna called for in this recipe (using one of those ginormous cans of albacore tuna), I added a little garlic/onion powder, fresh ground pepper and just a touch more milk. This was okay, but bland. I think it could use some fresh sauteed onions, garlic and fresh mushrooms and maybe some worchestershire sauce. My husband thought it needed more cheese. We all agreed the croutons on the top was a money idea. Good comfort food but it could be better.

This turned out really great with only a few minor changes. Following the advice of others I changed the milk to 3/4 of a can. Also, I added salt and pepper before baking. Instead of topping with croutons I just topped with cheese, baked for 15 minutes and then topped with French's fried onions and baked for 5 more minutes. This was simple, delicious and great for a weeknight meal!

This wasn't bad per se, but it was bland.  My kids at it, which made me happy, especially since my 3 year old is so picky. I think I would add spices and maybe onion to it. I think garlic or herb flavored croutons would be great. I used plain breadcrumbs, which probably wasn't the best plan. Also, for the record...put you cheese on BEFORE the croutons, it won't stick otherwise...I learned that.

I give this five stars because it fulfilled all of my cooking criteria - it was fast (in that I could let it do its thing while I did mine), and it tasted very good.    I added salt and pepper to taste and used egg noodles since I had those on hand.  Both my husband and I enjoyed this and went back for second helpings...must find a way to curb that for the next time.

This reminded me of the tuna noodle casserole my mom used to make when I was little.  I made a lot of the same changes as other people did.  I sauteed some onions and green pepper, which I added to the mix.  I also added some frozen mixed veggies when I was boiling the noodles.  I only used half the milk, added garlic salt and peppper, and added cheese and italian breadcrumbs into the mix instead of just layering on top.

Very good and very easy.  I didn't have croutons but used a crushed Ritz cracker and shredded cheddar mix on top.  Made a very nice crunchy top.  I had some onion, celery and green pepper leftover from something else so I sautéed those with a few peas and threw them in.  But the appeal of this recipe is the simplicity and it works well.

I love this recipe but here's how I change it: I add 1 cup peas; I only use 1 1/2 c noodles and I use rotini, they hold the sauce better; I only use half a can of milk to keep it thick; I use breadcrumbs instead of croutons and I only use a light dusting not a whole cup (probably 1/4 cup); and I use a small amount of black pepper and garlic powder (to taste). Other than that :) yum!

It was alright but needed a little more "kick" Tabasco at the dinner table seemed to do the trick.

Went with most of the suggestions here and it came out well! Definitely needs the extra seasoning. I added 1/4 teaspoons of garlic powder and onion powder. Also, I think it's best if you put the breadcrumbs/croutons on after the cheese when topping it.

This turned out not bad for throwing together just what I had into it. I used no yolk noodles instead of macaroni, two cans of tuna, and since I didn't have crutons, I toasted bread, and then crumbled it up with some butter and spices, and I also added some peas. It did come out a bit dry, but I think that was my fault. My roommates ate it up!

Tuna casserole is one of my comfort foods.  This recipe is very close to the one my mom has always made and that I make for a quick weeknight meal.  I was looking for something a little different and the croutons caught my eye.  I used egg noodles, 2 cans of tuna, 1/2 soup can of milk and added ground black pepper.  Great idea putting the croutons on top - we loved it!

This recipe is great! I didn't have croutons so I ended up using Ritz crackers crumbled and it worked out well.

Was not fond of this recipe. It was bit bland, and the croutons on top ended up going soggy on me. Made this for the family, they didn't really like it either. I was the one who ended up having to eat the leftovers!! Thanks for the recipe Richard, but I will not be making this again.

I added in the tuna and spices suggested by other reviewers as well as decreasing the milk. My family absolutely loved it.  This will definitely be something I make often.

It seems funny to rate something as simple as a tuna casserole- but it is worth all 5 stars! Simple, quick and yummy...does it get better than that? I did not use all of the cream of mushroom soup and I did add a few seaonings such as garlic powder and onion salt..but only because they were handy and I love spicing things up a bit. 

This will be on my list for a long time! Even my two year old loved it!

This came out great and it's a recipe that lets you fine-tune to your liking.  I used two cans of tuna, 1/2 cup diced onion, and peas.  I had the "casserole" sized elbos and they were great.  I used the cheddar and croutons and no extra seasonings.  To classy this up, I would use fresh mushrooms and lose the peas.  I don't do tuna casseroles often, but when I do, this is the one.

This is a pretty good dish. It's fairly easy to make and I liked how it uses macaroni rather the the usual egg noodles. We will having it again but probably not on a regular basis.

It's ok but needs to be creamier. Next time I will add 2 cans of soup and 1 can of milk. I also added celery, pepper, parsley and garlic powder. My breadcrumbs were mixed with some parm cheese.

This is a great recipe. I added a second can of tuna to make it more hearty. But I think next time I will add a second can of soup.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best.  It just seemed a bit bland.  I don't even know what type of herb I would add, but I think it needed something.  I will make it again and try changing it a bit.

This recipe is perfect to make when you are in a hurry or have worked all day.  I put the whole thing together in about 20 minutes and it was very tasty.  I didn't vary from the recipe at all and really enjoyed it.

Great recipe.  I use 1/2 cup of milk and breadcrumbs instead of croutons.  Sometimes I use Swiss cheese instead of cheddar.  And sometimes I add peas and pearl onions.  =0)

I made a few changes to this recipe due to the fact that I needed to use up some things in my cupboard. I used spaghetti noodles (I am sure any small sized noodles would work), I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used a table spoon of mayo, I used half a can of evaporated milk since it makes it creamier, italian bread crumbs, two cans of tuna, and I mixed in extra chedder cheese before sprinkling on top.

over all, yum!!

I adjusted the recipe a little as well, 2 cans of tuna, some cheese mixed into the noodle mix, added some garlic powder, basil, salt and peper, and I only used about 1/4 cup of milk. And I didn't have pea's so I used a can of green beans I did have. 

All in all it came out good. My boyfriend really liked it, I thought it was a bit bland. I'll be making this again, but with some extra spices/herbs and probably a few more vegetables mixed in. 

Good, quick, easy recipe.

This was very good, although I made a lot of changes and additions.  I sauteed some onion and celery in a little olive oil, added some peas, doubled the tuna, used smoked salami cheese and omitted the croutons.  I also added a bunch of salt and pepper.  My husband really liked it.  I would make it again, but probably also add a little hot sauce to it. It's a good base recipe and you can pretty much add whatever you like.

This recipe was ok. I found it a little bland the first time I made it, so the next time I added some frozen green peppers, onion and garlic powder, black pepper, and a pinch of chili powder for kick. I used 1 1/2 cups of marble cheese and instead of croutons I used my crushed cracker and melted butter toppoing (mix 1 cup crushed ritz or salted soda crackers and 1 Tbsp melted butter).

i'd been thinking of making a tuna noodle casserole & thought this recipe looked good. some minor changes (personal preferences) i made were to use reames frozen noodles in place of macaroni and to stir in some sauteed onion & celery. solid pack albacore works better because it doesn't flake apart into miniscule pieces like regular tuna. two 6 ounce cans of albacore gave this dish plenty of flavor, nice topping too. served this with peas. thanks richard!

Didn't have enough flavor for me. I should have done as others recommended and upped the tuna to 2 cans (I couldn't even taste the tuna with only one can), cut down the amount of milk, as I thought it was too runny, and add some more pepper. Easy to make tho, and with some adjustments could be really yum!

I loved it. I doubled the recipe for a church potluck and got lots of good reviews. I made one modification by adding some chopped broccoli to give it a little color and it was very good, not dry like other tuna casseroles I have made before.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I had tried Tuna Noodle Casserole once a long time ago and I was craving the taste and this recipe was right on the dot! However, I substituted crushed croutons with crushed regular Lay's potato chips. My boyfriend loved it and so did I. This is delish and deserves 5 stars.

This was delicious! I loved using the crushed croutons. It made a world of difference instead of using the same old bread crumbs. I've never really enjoyed a tuna casserole until now!

A basic tuna casserole recipe that is better than average. My boyfriend grew up with a little TOO much tuna casseroles and I rarely make these types of recipes on his account (I try to slip these in our menu rotation at least a few times per year at most). Maybe my cream of mushroom soup was too runny in the first place that it didn't need the full 10.5oz can of milk, but the result was a little too creamy casserole. In fact, I had to bake it apprx 10min longer (and then let it sit for another 5 min) just to thicken it up. Therefore, I may use less milk next time. Also, I added a jar of drained, diced pimentos for some color and instead of croutons, I sprinkled some seasoned bread crumbs overall. It was still pretty tasty and my boyfriend didn't make one complaint while eating his bowl. Thanks Richard.

I think my husband and I must be the only two people on Allrecipes.com who did not grow up on tuna casserole.  Even though I didn't think it really sounded very good, it appeared so easy to make and so many people raved about it, I decided to give it a try.  It was indeed easy to prepare.  But the taste was, unfortunately, about what I expected . . . very lackluster.  My husband, whose philosophy is "if you can't say anything good, don't say anything at all," had only the following comment . . . "I really like the crunchiness in this."  He was referring to the crushed croutons.  When I asked if he thought I should keep this recipe and make it again sometime, he changed the subject and never gave me an answer.  I wonder if the nostalgia aspect of this dish is a major reason why so many people think it is so great.  Here is my take on it.  If you had it as a kid and loved it, you'll probably love this recipe.  If you didn't grow up on tuna casserole, you'll probably wonder what all the hullabaloo is about when you taste this recipe.

Instead of canned tuna wtih cream of mushroom soup, I used canned chicken and cream of chicken soup.  I keep everything else the same.  It turned out great, plus it was really easy.  I think I liked it better reheated the next day when all the flavors soaked together.

I started out making this recipe, but after hearing cries of, "But we don't like tuna!" the casserole became a chicken noodle casserole. I used egg noodles, carrots, celery, onion and green pepper. I also just prepared a white sauce since I didn't have any cream soups in the house.

Very easy recipe.  I added a can of pees, half of a crushed onion, and some garlic to spice it up.  I think next time I'm going to try adding a little of the shredded cheese in when I'm pouring the mix into the casserole dish.  Overall, This was a very easy recipe and I had all the ingredients, so for someone who doesn't cook- This was perfect!

We love this recipe--because there are two of us, I divide it into two 8-inch square baking dishes, and it makes 2 nights worth of meals for two (very healthy servings!).  I also broil it for a few minutes at the end because we like the crunchiness of the croutons.  This recipe is wonderful!

Excellent traditional tuna casserole. We added an additional can of soup, broccoli, peas and scallions. It wasn't quite hot enough after 30 minutes so we are going to cook it for 45 minutes the next time we make it. Which we will!

I  made this recipe last night.. my husband wasn't sure he even wanted to taste it... he ended up having TWO large servings!!  It's delicious! I followed others' ideas and added peas and reduced milk to half amount. The croutons gave it a crunchy, enjoyable taste!  A keeper, for sure!

I gave this one star because the recipe as is ...way too bland! 
My changes to make it 5 stars is worcestershire mixed into tuna. Used a pound of macaroni. I used four 6 ounce cans of tuna. quarter can of milk used. mixed in sauted onions, garlic, cerlery, italian seasoning and hot pepper flakes . Mixed in cheese salt and pepper as well as the topping. Used asiago crushed croutons. Definitely needed double the time to make it hot I cover it for 45 minutes or once bubbling.  The last 10 minutes no foil

Bland and just so unsatisfying. Followed the recipe exactly as stated and I was very disappointed. Watery, not enough tuna, and the elbow macaroni was a bad choice for this.

I used this recipe as a guideline and used what I had on hand. It was pretty good, though a little bland, but I avoid overusing herbs and spices for my 1.5 year old. We loved it! He slurped it all down, and we split a wheat tortilla on the side. I happened to make enough to freeze part of it for a later time (Being currently pregnant and due in the next couple weeks, I try to make extras to freeze and have ready for after baby comes) 

I added about a cup or so of frozen veggies in the noodles in the last 5 minutes of boiling, which softened them up very nicely, then mixed that together with the cheese, condensed cream of mushroom soup, tuna, and milk. Threw it in a glass pan, sprinkled a little more cheese on top, covered it with foil and cooked for a little under 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Very delicious! Thank you for the great base recipe :) Next time I will most likely add some bread crumbs for topping, but sadly we were out.

My kids loved it and it is super easy.  I didn't have cream of mushroom so I used cream of chicken cause it's what I had and it was fab!  Oh, and breadcrumbs instead of crutons, again, because it's what I had.

I thought it was great! I used egg noodles instead of elbow maceroni and instead of condensed soup i used extra milk, then i sprinkles grated cheese on top of the noodle/milk mixture, and i sprinkled bread crumbs on top, and it turned out creamy, cheesy and crunchy! Love it!

So yummy and easy! I made it almost exactly the way described in the recipe. I was worried about the blandness and also because there was a lot of liquid at one point, but it turned out great. I used fusilli because I didn't have elbow macaroni, and added some pepper to the sauce. Thanks for the easy dinner. :)

My husband is a big eater- and he loved it! He doesn't like peas so that is why I used this recipe-the only tweak I did was used ritz crackers mixed w/ melted butter for the topping of the casserole and added lots more cheese!! I will use this recipe FOREVER!!!

great idea but it needs a little something like other users I normally try the original recipe at least once but I knew this one needed a litle twist. I added some frozen peas that had been blanched in cool water,pepper, salt, and used about 1/4 C milk. Season crushed crutons were great! It reminds me of my nanny's homemade tuna noodle casserole with the extra's onions would probably be great too!

I don't know if they meant condensed milk when they said canned milk.  But I just used regular milk.  Per other suggestions I only used a 1/4 cup.  I added onions, carrots, and peas to this recipe.  It was a pretty bland recipe but can easily be dressed up.  It needs salt (and I'm not crazy about salt).  In my own dish I put garlic salt and a lot of crushed red pepper and it tasted good.  I would make it again but I would add more spice prior to cooking it.

What I like about this recipe is that it's simple all the way around. The ingredients are things you are already likely to have in your cupboard, it doesn't take much prep or cook time, and that casserole's flavors are pretty simple - it would be a good dish to make for kids or picky eaters. If you're looking for tons of flavor though, look elsewhere. My boyfriend suggested adding another can of tuna, pepper to taste, and more cheese. I think if you experiment around with it a bit, it's sure to please everyone.

I added frozen peas, parsley and celery salt. I did not have any croutons, so I opted for crushed crackers sprinkled with garlic powder. I baked for 25 minutes and the cheese dried out. Next time I'll only do it for 20 minutes. The recipe was wonderful, though. Very yummy!!

My very picky 5 year old and my 13 month old both loved this -- that speaks volumes! Easy to make - per other reviews, I used half the milk. I also substituted Italian bread crumbs for the croutons and used an Italian cheese mix instead of straight cheddar. Will definitely make again and again!

Quick and Easy!  This recipe is great for nights when you're short on time.  I follow the recipe exactly and I never have a problem with too much liquid.  Depending on what I have on hand, I may sub a different type of pasta or use breadcrumbs instead of croutons.  Simply delicious and reheats well!

This is a great recipe!  My husband does not like Tuna Noodle Casserole very much.  I picked this recipe because of the cheese and crouton toppings.  I also added peas to it.  My husband liked it and actually had 2nds!  He rated it a 6 on a scale from 1-10.  My daughter and I rated it 10!

This was easy to make and had great flavor. I made the recipe exactly as written with the exception of the topping....I used seasoned bread crumbs. This froze well for my hubby's future lunches. I recommend this one!

WOW!!!  This went over very well at my house.  My husband has been begging me to make a tuna noodle casserole, and he just loved this one.  I am not a big tuna lover, and this was very good.  I left the cheese and crutons off as we dont like crutons and my husband isnt big on cheese.  However I did put cheese on my plate and melted it over it in the microwave. My 2 year old wouldnt eat it because I think she  didnt like the way it looked.  This is definaltey going into my regular recipie book.  Will be making this again and again and again.

when I made the casserole I added peas into it and also Velvita cheese on top along with French's fried onions and seasoned bread crumbs with Parmesan cheese. its a great comfort food on a cold winter night and easy-to-make you can also make this recipe on a budget. you can also use other ingredients like chicken  or even use  Hamburg  in the recipe . I give it a five-star for the easiness on how to make.

I’ve made this several different ways.  I love how easy it goes together and it’s terrific as written.  It is also a great base to start from for adjusting to personal preferences.  Satisfying and a real treat on a chilly autumn evening!  I normally stick with cheddar cheese but recently mixed it up using half sharp cheddar and half gruyere/swiss for a tasty twist.  Super yummy with lots of cracked pepper added on the plate!

I thought the original recipe was a little bland so I added a can of peas a can of mushrooms salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder. Minced garlic and Spanish paprika and threw 1 1/2 cup of cheese in the mixer. When there was 8-10 minutes left I took it out and threw the other 1/2 cup of cheese on top. And it was killer.!!

Made this a few times, I use canned chicken and add crumbled bacon and peas...also use condensed chicken soup (homemade)added garlic and onion powder as well as chili powder.  Sprinkled dried onion instead of croutons.  So I guess a lot of changes but I was using up leftovers lol this is any easy starter and as you can see you can add almost snything??

Great base recipe.  I use cream of celery soup, add a can of mushrooms and sauteed onion & celery.  I think using french fried onions on top would be good, but I haven't tried that.  I don't like peas but would consider adding a small can of carrots.

This was great. Sure it's just tuna noodle casserole, but it was really great! The only change I made was I used cream of zuchinni instead of cream of mushroom, but only because I had that on hand. Made it for my Belgian husband (who has never eaten this before and thought the idea was disgusting!) and he loved every bit of it - even ate the leftovers the next day! I will make again!

Very, very bland despite adding another can of tuna as well as the following: kosher salt, fresh ground black pepper, peas, green onion, garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, and celery seed.  I also substituted chips for croûtons.

The recipe was very good even though I had to change it alittle.  Because I did not have any tuna, I had to use chicken(the kind in the can).  It was still delicious either way.

My kids and I did not like it, but my husband liked it. It was too bland! I took other reviewers suggestions to double the tuna content and use less milk. Still it need a few other things. I'll not be making this again.

For the relatively short amount of time it took to prepare this, I have to say it's pretty good.  I think next time I'll add a couple extra ingredients to just spruce it up a bit (more vegetables).  Good recipe for a quick and easy dinner.

This was SUPER fast and easy.  In the time it took to cook the noodles, the rest of the dish was prepared.

I used cream of chicken soup since I was out of cream of mushroom.  I also added some lemon pepper.  It turned out great!!!

These ingredients are all fine by themselves, but woe to thee who puts them all together.  Try using bread crumbs instead of croutons (and put a lot more in the casserole to keep it from being too liquidy) and try using American cheese rather than sharp cheddar.  Trust me, the combination of all these things listed as is results in an unhappy family and taste buds that are ready to revolt.
