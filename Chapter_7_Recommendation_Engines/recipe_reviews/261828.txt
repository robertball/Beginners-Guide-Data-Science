Delicious! The chocolate shavings are that special touch that makes it stand out. My first batch I made as directed and it was great. My second batch I added 1oz of vodka to give it an extra kick. Even better!

Nice after dinner drink or special holiday cheer.  Although to fill my martini glass I had to use 3 oz Baileys and 1 1/2 oz peppermint liquor.  More martini to enjoy!

Oh boy that is good!! An adult  chocolate milk with a hint of mint. I made it exactly as written and served it with a candy cane & the shaved chocolate on top. A lovely Christmas drink on a snowy afternoon!

Just right!  Made it as directed and it turned out perfectly!  The mint was such a nice addition to this and made it more of a Christmas seasonal drink!  Delicious!

I just made the most amazing Baileys Minty Martini. It's absolutely amazing with the balance of minty, creamy, luscious, and chocolate. It's like a grasshopper on awesomesauce!
