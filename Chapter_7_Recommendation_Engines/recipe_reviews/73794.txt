Yum!  This is so delicious.  I used minced garlic mixed in with the squash and onions, but didn't change anything else.  It smelled delicious while cooking.  I served it over plain white rice and I think that was a good addition.  Thanks for recipe.

This is a great and easy recipe. Lots of flavor and yummy. I used my crock-pot to make it and it was great.

I really liked this dish! I cooked the squash and onion along with the beef as it browned. That shortened the time needed, as well as eliminating the need for the oil. The recipe does not instruct when to add back in the ground beef, but this took care of that. I will definitely increase the spices the next time. They could easily be doubled for good flavor. Instead of the canned tomatoes, I used my own fresh tomatoes from my garden. Yum!

Easy...Easy...Easy!!!  I sauteed the onion with a minced clove of garlic (instead of garlic powder), then added the meat and browned it.  At step 3, I was pretty heavy handed with the chili powder and cumin, and also added a bouillon cube and some italian seasoning, because otherwise, I think it would have been pretty bland.  Next time, I think I'll add something spicy.  Fast, healthy, simple and tasty!

Calabacitas! Great recipe! I changed the amount of spices a bit and used about 1 tbsp minced garlic, 2 tsp chili powder and a heaping teaspoon of cumin (love the spices). When I simmered everything for 30 minutes, I added a Serrano pepper which I cut in half and let simmer with everything else for an added kick. Served over Jasmin rice. The family loved it. I will make again.

This was great!  My boyfriend prefers food with more flavor than most people, so I almost always double seasonings.  I doubled cumin and chili powder, used two garlic cloves instead of garlic powder, and I added a quarter teaspoon of cayenne pepper powder.  I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I would definitely make this again!

This was very good, but would have been far too bland without adding extra spices.  I doubled the chili powder and cumin, and I added about 1/2 tsp. thyme and lots of fresh, minced garlic.  I used vegetable broth in place of the water.  Still, with bumping up the spice, my husband and I added some crushed red pepper at the table.  I will definitely make this again when I have extra squash to use.  I may try it with sausage instead of ground beef, which would make it less bland.

This was an excellent meal. I doubled the spices, and also used cilantro, and real garlic. I added bell pepper and grated cheese. Will try it again over some rice.

We loved this!   Fast and easy and a great way to use up the squash that has exploded from the garden!  After reading the reviews I upped the spices and used chopped garlic. We served this with avocado slices and a bit of cheddar cheese.  Will definitely make this again!

I didn't have cumin or cilantro so mine was a bit bland. I used fresh garlic, season salt, beef bullion cube, and steak seasoning. My husband gave it 3*s. He ate seconds & he says he'll eat it again, but I'll have to make sure I add more seasoning. I also cooked some white rice for about 12 minutes of the 20 minute recipe, then added the rice to the meat, squash, etc mixture to soak up some of the juices. I don't like tomatoes, so that was a downer for me. It was pretty good though. I'll try it again.

This was good. I would not call it a "spanish" squash though, made it for hubby, who is spanish and it didn't have any of the spanish flavors to it. Over all it was good though and a nice quick weekend dinner.

If you are looking for a healthy, low-fat dish, this is it.  Great recipe for humble Holiday overeaters!  It was tasty, filling and great if you're cooking for one (scale down).  I used cubed uncooked chicken and sauteed it right in with the squash. Thanks.

My question is, when did you add the ground beef to the zucchini/tomato mixture?  I let it simmer, then added the ground beef.  Was a good, low-carb dish as I served it with no rice.

I did as everyone else did and added a lot more spice. It would have been very boring without that addition. I also used tomatoes with green chilies.  It was a good way to use up squash I had .

I gave this 5 stars with my modifications. As everyone else did, I doubled the seasonings, used fresh garlic, added a beef bouillon, but I also used a can of Rotel mild (with the green chiles), and added fresh cilantro to the mixture as it was simmering. Because I am on the Keto diet, I served it over cauliflower rice. My husband also loved it.

Was excellent.  Great flavor.  My non-squash eater loved it and wants more.  That alone rates 5 stars.

I added a banana pepper from my garden in with the squash and onions.  At the end of their softening, I added some fresh garlic.  For the tomatoes, I used one can of diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil.  I decided that I didn't have enough so I added a can of diced tomatoes with chipotle peppers.  I omitted the cumin because I don't like it.  Finally, I added some Vigo yellow rice and cooked it along with everything else.  The spices from the rice along with cooking it in the sauce made it so flavorful.  Will definitely make it again.

I read the reviews and added fresh chopped garlic with the onions, and used diced fresh tomatoes. Jim flavored it with chili powder as it cooked, and liked it even more when we ate the leftovers. We will definitely use this again.

This was really good but the recipe calls for all of this extra water. It came out like soup. It's also a little bland, but I remedied that by adding fresh garlic and doubling up on the spices.

I think the steps are wrong for the recipe. For example, it doesn't have you add the meat back to the mixture, unless it's not supposed to. That would result in bland meat since it's not seasoned in step 1. Nonetheless, we enjoyed the recipe and would make it again (made with ground turkey) with my changes. I doubled the spices--seasoning the meat; drained/set aside the meat. Then, I sauteed the onion and squash. Next, I added 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chiles and the water (I was short on chili powder and wanted to add a little kick to the dish). Lastly, added the meat to the mixture and simmered for 30 minutes. Served over spanish rice.  As written, I give this recipe 3 stars. With my modifications, I'd give it 4 stars. Very easy to make and a nice variation for cooking squash.

Made this two weeks ago, and am making it again tonight.  Wonderful way to use up summer vegetables.  Made several minor changes: used several cloves of minced garlic instead of the garlic powder, fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned, and doubled spices.  Will be using this all summer - well as long as we have squash, and tomatoes...so yeah, all summer.  Wonderful recipe.  Try it!

I didn't really expect this to be good because I'm not a big fan of squash, but it was delicious!  As suggested in other reviews, I sauteed the onion and minced garlic with the beef, then added the squash, tomatoes, and spices.  I doubled the spices and it really could have used even more but that's because I like really spicy food.  I will definitely make this again.

This greatly exceeded my expectations. I thought it would be "ok" but it was excellent. We had just made some fresh Mexican sausage so we used the sausage and cut the ground meat and spices. We used the dish as a side dish, but it could be a main course. I'm taking this to our next "covered dish" get together. (Orosi Valley, Costa Rica)

This was very easy.  I sautéed the squash and onions with the ground beef as someone else had suggested.  I had some extra fresh spinach in the house, so I put that in there as well.  I did increase the spices as had been suggested, but I thought it could have used more.  A little extra salt helped.

Pretty good. Mixed in garlic with the squash and onions and served over white rice.

We enjoyed this recipe, but I think it would have been bland had I not doubled both the chili powder and cumin and used diced tomatoes w/ green chilis in place of regular diced tomatoes.  I sauteed the onions with the beef, then added the squash and other remaining ingredients and simmered for 30 minutes.  I would make this again with these tweaks.

Great over rice, with a sprinkle of hot sauce, and a dallop of sour cream! Really enjoyed it but will probably season the meat while cooking it next time instead of following the directions to the letter. There will be a next time though. Great weeknight meal!

Very tasty!  Served on brown rice with guacamole, diced tomatoes and cheese on top and tortilla chips on the side.  Everyone in the family liked it even the picky non-veggie eaters.

Loved this, didn't use the cumin added garlic salt. Was better next day when all the flavors mingled together.

This was very tasty! I followed a few suggestions of others, adding fresh garlic and onion in when browning the meat. I had already roasted a butternut squash so I just used all of that, a little more water and some Italian Seasoning. I served it with white Jasmine rice. Very good! My 17 month old devoured a huge serving! I will try a little more seasoning next time.

I really enjoyed this and will make it again.  Although, I added A LOT more of the spices than it calls for (and a lot more water which made it saucier).  I used freshly ground cumino (since I buy the seeds).  I also used chipoltle diced tomatoes, but I live in Texas so it's easy to find.  Gave it a great flavor.  I served it over homemade spanish rice.  Great dish!  Just don't skimp on the spices if you have a taste for more flavorful food.  I would have found it bland if I had of follow the recipe exactly.

This was pretty good.  Just remember to start the tomatoes first.  Be liberal with the seasonings, and though you might want to add more, a little salt will go a long ways as it makes the other flavors explode.  I served it on basmati rice with shredded cheese on top. I also kept the rice, tomato sauce, and ground beef/squash portions separate when I served them for spiciness control.

My family and I loved this recipe! I added fresh chopped garlic and served over noodles, as I just didn't feel like rice. It is delicious!

Good Recipe.  I followed the reviews of other members and I really liked the end result.  I used 3 small cloves of garlic and sauteed the veggies with the meat to cut back on time.  I didn't add water, but just used the juice from the canned tomatoes.  I also doubled the spices, since I like my food with a lot of kick, and I added a bit of cayenne for some bite.  Served it over brown rice and it was a hit with family.  Thanks for the idea!

This was really good. I used the juice from the canned tomatoes instead of water. I also added Adobo seasoning to it. Even my kids ate it and they are VERY picky.

This was good and EASY!  And bonus, my 3 year old loved it!  I doubled all the spices, used fresh garlic, added some red pepper and topped with shredded cheese.  YUM!

I loved this dish!  I didn't drain the tomatoes & I served it over white rice.  Next time, I'll use Spanish rice for even fuller flavor.  I'll also increase the spice amounts & include some zucchini.  Simple & yummy!
