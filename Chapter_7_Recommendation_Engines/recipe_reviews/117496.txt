Excellent!  I was so pleased with this.  First of all,  this fruit salad is simply beautiful. I used the bananas, blueberries and rasberries as the recipe called for, but swapped out the strawberries with mangoes and kiwi for additional flavor and color contrast.  The honey in the dressing makes the fruit glossy - so pretty!  As if the fruit wouldn't be delicious enough on its own, the outstanding combination of honey and lemon in the dressing was like icing on a cake.  ( I omitted the poppy seeds) Simply delicious. I served it over "Buttermilk Pound Cake" and "Microwave Lemon Curd," both recipes also from this site.  I can't imagine a better fruit salad or a prettier, more delicious topping for that cake!

Delicious - this makes a great light dessert that's very refreshing.  I cut the recipe down to two servings for just me and my husband.  It was the perfect after dinner treat.

This is the way fruit salad should be served. With no yogurt or other distracting flavors. This recipe is perfectly light and flavorful. Myself and my guests all loved it and everyone wanted the recipe. I used 1 catalope, 1 little pkg of blueberries, half a lb. of green grapes sliced in half, 2 small bananas, 1 pint of strawberries halved. After slicing the bananas I coated them in lemon juice (to keep them from browning) in a small bowel mixed the honey and lemon jiuce as stated in the recipe and then poured over the fruit, mixed well and served about an hour later. It was so fresh and a perfect ending to our first real bbq in March. Will absolutly make this again! Next week in fact.

This recipe was amazing! I added chopped pecans and didn't use any poppyseeds. I also adjusted some of the other ingredients. I didn't have many of the berries..and they are expensive, so I used strawberries, bananas, apples, and oranges. It was delicious and I will definitely be making it again!

The dressing for this fruit salad is so light and refreshing! It lets the natural flavor of the fruit shine through while adding just a touch of sweetness and texture. I actually used strawberries, honeydew melon, grapes, and pineapple in place of the original fruit. I'd say any 7 cups or so of fruit would work beautifully. I'll be keeping this recipe.

Wow - Yum!  I don't like bananas so I left those out, but I used fresh raspberries, fresh blueberries, fresh strawberries and a pkg. of thawed blackberries... maybe 3 c of each?  I used maybe 10 TBSP of honey and 3 TBSP of reconstituted lemon juice... no poppy seeds as I was out ... It was SO GREAT!  I scooped some of the berries in a dish with the sauce, and poured a little heavy cream over it all - my kids (5 yrs, 3 1/2 yrs and 2 yr old twins) all went beserk over this and threw big fits because I wouldn't let them eat the rest of the huge bowl it made, lol!

My husband and I usually enjoy fruit salads made with different types of melons. I saw this berry salad and made it. It was absolutely delicious. The honey topping is scrumptuous. We both loved it, there were no leftovers! Will definitely make again and again!

The honey produced alot of juice.  I don't like my fruit sitting in alot of juice, it makes the fruit soggy.

I LOVE making this for my family. I use whatever fruit I have on hand and the honey glaze is the perfect amount of sweetness. If you are using bananas, don't add them until just before serving or else your "glaze" will end up a cloudy, syruppy mess.

A big hit at the 4th of July party I went to. It was so easy and tasty!! I didn't have any poppy seeds and that was fine. It's great as you can use whatever fruit you have on hand.

Instead of raspberries, I used grapes and canned pineapple and threw on a few mandarin oranges I had on hand. I put in in the refrigerator and cut up one banana to put on top. My husband had three helpings!! I will make this again!

So simple but so good!  The first time I made it using all different kind of berries.  The next time I used some berries, kiwi, bananas and fresh pineapple. I combined the berries and the kiwi. I cut up my banana and sqeezed fresh lemon juice on it to keep it from turning brown.  I did not add it to the berry mixture just yet.  I cut the pineapple into bite size pieces and kept it separate from the rest of the fruit until I was almost ready to serve.  When I was ready to serve I added the banana and pineapple and then the honey mixture.  The combination of the colors of the fruit was really pretty.  Both times the fruit salad was delicous.

I really did enjoy this! My son, who really doesn't like to eat alot of fruit, gobbled it up! I did add a tad more lime juice. But it is a refreshing way to eat fruit as a dessert, thanks!

I LOVED this.  I took it to a volleyball tournament and the girls went nuts over it.  I didn't bring any of it home.  I cut up the fruit and mixed the sauce the night before.  I put the sauce on right before we left.  I thought the honey lemon mixture was the right ratio and not to sweet.  If you like pure unadulterated fruit you probably will not like the sauce.  Thanks for sharing Dororthy.

The honey added a lovely bit of sweetness, without overpowering the fruit flavor. Letting it sit overnight allowed for the flavors to meld. Really nice, and the kids enjoyed helping to make it.

This fruit salad was delicious.  I left out the poppy seeds and added sliced nectarines and green grapes to the bananas, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries.  They worked well together.

Just made this for my son and he loved it! I used 3 bananas, 3 clemintine oranges, a handful of red seedless grapes and 1 gala apple. I also didnt have poppy seeds so I omitted that. tastes great and will try again with different fruits. It is a very versatile recipe for whatever you have on hand.

I didn't want to deal with brown bananas, so I put a tropical twist to this recipes by using 1 pineapple, 2 large cans of madarine oranges, 1 carton of strawberries, black grapes, 4 kiwi.  Worked out great!

Simple, fresh, and delicious! Having made this salad quite a few times over the summer, I haven't found a combination of fruits that people didn't enjoy! Due to personal preference (and the fact that I generally make this for a group of people with varying tastes), I never add poppy seeds.  I've also subbed lime juice with great success. You can't go wrong with this lovely fruit salad!

Okay, okay - I couldn't rate one actual recipe - I had to use what I had on hand (but I feel like I'm entitled to give 5 stars as I believe it's the simplicity of the honey/lemon dressing that makes this dish.  Whipped mine up in like 5 minutes using blueberries, cherries, mandarine oranges and an apple.  Scaled recipe WAY down as just hubby & I and ended up using 1T honey to 1/2 t lemon juice.  Fantastic!

This was a wonderful light dressing for a fruit salad. I had pineapple, banana, strawberries, mango and blueberries. It was light, brightened up my older fruit and didn't make the fruit taste too sugary. I will definitely use this again, but next time maybe I'll try lime!

I followed the recipe closely, cutting the recipe in half and using half the honey. That was plenty. The poppyseeds were great in this salad. Very good. Plenty for a breakfast dinner.

Wonderfully refreshing! I also tossed and drained bananas  is a small amount of lemon juice so they would not turn (also works for apples!). For less sweet, use more lemon juice. I used 3T honey- 1t juice. Made plenty of juice because I also used fresh pineapple.  Blueberries, strawberries and fresh pineapple. This is a perfect healthy spring/summer dish when berries are in season!!

This was very good for my family brunch. I used orange, little bit of grapefruit, mango, strawberries and kiwi. You can really use any fruit you want because the dressing is very simple and would go with anything!

This is very good! I only had 1/2 of the blueberries so I added kiwis. I only used 3/4 of the mixture though as it made a lot! I also added 2 tsp of dried mint...everyone liked the touch!

Made this for a picnic. I was afraid the honey would make it too sweet, but that was not the case. Along with berries, I added pineapple and peaches. It was a total hit! Will definitely make this again!

I thought 5 tablespoons of honey was a bit much but other than that it was a good breakfast recipe.  I'm not particularly sure we'll be using it again though, my kids prefer yogurt with their fruit.  Thanks for sharing, Dorothy!

This adds the perfect amount of sweetness to fruit.  I made it for a baby shower and everyone ate it up.  A better and more interesting option than a fruit tray.

This is very simple, and very tasty. The poppy seeds are only there to provide color, so you can leave them out without affecting the flavor. I used only strawberries & pluots (which, sadly, meant I had no color contrast in my salad) but any combo of fruits would be delicious here. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for a baby shower, I increased the lemon just a bit. Everyone loved it. I mixed the dressing up the night before and it actually seemed thinner in the morning, which helped incorporate it into the salad better.

I served this as part of a Christmas brunch and everyone loved it.  The honey-lemon sauce is a light and refreshing addition to the fruit.  The only change I would make is to omit the poppy seeds.  I thought the black seeds detracted from the otherwise beautiful appearance of the fruit salad.

This was very yummy!  I was hosting a bridal shower and wanted to make it a bit more girly so I put the fruit on little skewers to make kebobs and then poured the sauce on top.  I used strawberries, bananas, grapes, and pineapple.  All the girls LOVED them!

This was pretty good.  I enjoy using raw local honey in recipes so I was excited to find a fruit salad recipe that called for honey.  The honey dressing is light - so it makes a nice, light salad.  I will keep this one in mind.

Wanted to make a tossed fruit salad of strawberries, blueberries and bananas special without sacrificing the taste of fresh fruit.  This was just perfect!  Light and refreshing; a great partner to a brunch casserole.

This was LOVELY, but just a little too sweet for my taste.  Will try with less sauce next time (or with more lemon juice and less honey).  Still, thank you!

Love this recipe! I took it to a potluck today and I went very quickly. I was a little loose with the amount of fruit and increased the honey and lemon juice to compensate. Amazing how the fruit flavors came through with a little sweetness of the honey.

In our taste test, we thought the fruit looked awesome.  Really beautiful presentation.  The adults ate the salad and like it, but the kids commented that the lemon juice made it a little too tart.

Perfect for toddlers through adults!

I added 2 cups of cantaloupe
1 cup of kiwi and didn't use the raspberries or poppy seeds. I also used lime juice instead of lemon. I couldn't BELIEVE how good this was. The honey was fantastic and the lime juice kept the bananas from looking sad and brown. GREAT recipe. Literally takes minutes to "assemble".

My favorite fruit salad now!  The honey seems to enhance the fruits flavor rather than distracting from it.  Really good!  Took it to a potluck and got rave reviews.  Works great with any fruit you have on hand.  I used strawberry, blueberry, pineapple and oranges.

Fantastic! Used fruit I had on hand (melon, pear, and peaches) and no poppy seeds. Will definitely use this the next time I need a light dessert or side for dinner.

This is a beautiful fruit salad!!  I used strawberries, blueberries, pineapple, cantaloupe, and honey dew melon.  The dressing is a wonderful compliment to the fruits, with just a hint of lemon.  Delicious!  Serve as a salad or a dessert!

I totally agree with other reviewers of this recipe, fruit salad should only be eaten like this! It is so good. The dressing made with honey to mask the effects of the lemon to keep the fruit from browning is ingenious.  Works with virtually any fruit.  I used blueberries, strawberries, apple, cantelope, red grapes and kiwi.  Thank you for this totally awesome recipe.  I will be using this for many years to come!

There are so many deliciously ripe fruits in season right now, so I decided to treat me and my kiddos to a fresh fruit salad with lunch today.  This takes no time at all to put together.  I have never put honey on my fruit before, but it made it so good.  I didn't have any poppy seeds, so I just left those out.  I used strawberries, raspberries, mango, pineapple and canteloupe.  It was an amazing combination, especially with the lemon and honey.  Thanks for a great idea! UPDATE 7/27:  This is the second time that I have made this recipe, and this time I used grapes, strawberries, canteloupe, and pineapple.  I love the honey/lemon dressing and it dresses so many varieties of fruit.  The beauty of this recipe is the versatility.  I still haven't remembered to purchase poppy seeds, so they are once again absent.

This is not super flavorful, but it does add a little something extra to the fruit.  I would make this again to eat at home, but not good enough to serve at a party.

I made this for Mother's Day and everyone loved it--even the kids and the very picky eaters...I used fresh blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries.  I think mangoes would be really good also.  Everyone agreed that the honey really brought out the flavor of the fruit.  Simple but excellent.  Thanks!

This was an easy recipe and we loved it! So fresh and a healthy alternative when seeking sweets. I made the mistake of buying the berries from a regular grocery store, so I do recommend going to Costco/Sam's Club if you have a membership... much less expensive that way. Should let it sit a couple of hours for the flavor to soak in before consuming. Will definitely use this again, thanks for sharing!

I loved this fruit salad! I doubled the lemon juice because I like tangy and used real maple syrup instead of honey (just a preference). Thanks for this great recipe, I will make it again!

This didn't taste any different then just adding sugar to the fruit. But it did produce a lot more juice.

I didn't have the bananas or the poppy seeds - it still turned out good - very fresh tasting - better then just plan berries.

Easy, simple, delicious.  I omit the poppy seeds and add a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Good with any fruit.  Can be a little runny depending on the type of fruit you use.

I froze the leftovers and used in smoothies. It was perfect. My favorite was 1/2 cup apple juice, 1/2 cup vanilla ice cream, 1/4 cup strawberry sorbet, 1 - 1 1/2 cups frozen fruit, 1/2 cup ice. Yummmm...

Protip: Make only what you will eat in a day or two - any longer and the fruit tends to get soggy, especially bananas.  I love this fruit salad, the honey sauce is delicious and light!

I love this! I made it at the beginning of the week and had some each morning at work and it seems to only get better each day.  My only suggestion is that if you are going to make it for a later time then wait to add the bananas because they've gotten a little mushy. Otherwise it's a great fruit salad and very easy to make! :)

A different and even sweeter way to serve fruit - only issue was the amount of juice that accumulated.

Wow!!! The honey blends with the juices that press from the berries (under their own weight, and from the pressure of stirring) and the resulting marinade is amazing! Yummmm....

This is a lovely, easy salad.  I used strawberries, blueberries, banana, and watermelon.  It's best to let it sit just a bit before serving so the flavors have time to combine.

Nice fruit salad, but next time I will not add bananas.  The bananas made the salad soggy.

I don't like bananas or poppy seeds, so i made this with just strawberries, blueberries and raspberries and could not believe how good it was! I don't like honey much, but the sauce was surprisingly light and didn't overpower the fruit at all. The sauce just brought out a hint of sweetness to the slightly bitter fruit! I loved this and will be making it over and over again! It's my new favorite way to eat fruit!

I very much like this dressing. I have made this using banana, green apple, blueberries one time, and then the next time with strawberries, peaches, and green apple.

Very refreshing salad!  I used more like 2 TBSP lemon juice.  For fruit I used two different melons, strawberries, blueberries and bananas.  I had the fruit minus the bananas cut up the night before and then added the bananas and juice mix right before serving.

This recipe was wonderful.  I used  fresh strawberries, grapes (red & green), kiwi, & pineapple.  It was great.  The honey & lemon was just right.  I took this to work and it was gone before we were through.

This was delicious.  Along with the berries I also used apples, grapes, and watermellon.  I served it in the watermellon and it got devoured at my bbq.  I'm making it again for my daughters b-day.
