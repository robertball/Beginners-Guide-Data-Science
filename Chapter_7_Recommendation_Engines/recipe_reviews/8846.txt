Like a lot of people, I change almost every recipe to suit my family's taste and this was no exception.  My only changes were to par-cook the chicken with some spices, could only find a 12-oz can of milk so I put the whole thing in, and stirred the stuffing into the wet mix before spooning it over the chicken.  My husband loved it (said, "Three thumbs up") but he'll eat anything that doesn't get up and walk away.  My super-finicky 6-yr-old: TWO servings!  That NEVER happens.  Yep, this is a keeper!  The only thing I'd do differently next time is to make one of the cans of soup a low-sodium type.  We like salty stuff, but this was a bit much, even for us.  Otherwise, a perfect dish!!  (Did you read that part about my youngest eating TWO servings?  TWO!!)

This is one of the easiest receipes I've found. I bake boneless, skinless chicken breasts in the morning while I'm getting ready for work (30 - 40 minutes max).  When I come home I spend 10 minutes putting the entire casserole together and just pop it in the oven.  This has been one of the more requested dinner menu's now!  My son asks me to make a double receipe as he likes it so much he wants it for lunch the next day! A true favorite!

Very tasty recipe and simple.  I enjoy the texture of fresh vegetables in my stuffing so I added diced carrots, celery and onion to the mix.  I also used unseasoned stuffing.  To enhance the flavor I salted the chicken, added salt and pepper to the liquid ingredients, as well as a good tsp each of rubbed sage, thyme and basil.  Turned out great!

I used this recipe as a springboard for my own version.  I simplified preparation by using canned chicken breast meat, cut into tiny chunks.  Sometimes I make my own stuffing from left-over home-made whole wheat bread cubes, tossed with melted butter and poultry seasoning, (which I make myself from a recipe on this site), and sometimes I just use the "off the shelf" stuffing mix.  I usually add some fresh vegetable or other, (last night it was broccoli), and add it to the water and butter that's melting in the pan to be added to the stuffing mix, just to give the recipe a nutritional, color, and texture boost.  If I think it needs more moisture, I make my own home-made "cream soup" and pour it over the top and shake it through.  If I have any grated cheese handy, (just about any kind works!), I sprinkle that on the top, too, before baking.  This has become one of my kids' and husband's favorite recipes.  Left-overs are great!

Very good and very easy.  I adapted this recipe slightly by 1) using a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken (and once, a pre-cooked rotisserie turkey breast)and using canned broth in place of the boiled chicken water. I simply pulled apart the chicken and kept some aside for sandwiches and such, and chopped the rest of up for layering into the casserole; 2) in addition to the crunch of celery and veggies, I scattered craisens (dried cranberries) onto the stuffing mixture. They absorbed the liquid of the casserole and became soft and tender, but held their intregrity, for a bit of sharp cranberry contrast which for me, completes the "Thanksgiving in a hot dish" flavor combo. 3) Evap Milk was not required. I've used milk and also FF half and half. The finished texture of this casserole is not "stiff." It's rather soupy, like a very thick Chicken Pot pie mixture, so don't expect anything you can "slice."

This is very good. I've made this a few times, and it always gets rave reviews. I've experimented with adding different soups, and have never had a bad outcome (cream of mushroom is a good one to sub for the cream of celery). I usually also just use chicken breast meat instead of a whole chicken. Great recipe! Thanks :)

I love this recipe! It makes great comfort food! However, I like to use Campbell's "chicken with herbs" soup instead of the cream of chicken and cream of celery.

Like a previous reviewer, I used the breast tenderloins rather than the whole chicken.  Otherwise, I changed nothing about the recipe.  The 4 children (ages 5-12) were raving about it and had 2nd helpings - a rarity for the youngest.  Without a doubt, this is a KEEPER!

Love this recipe! I make it even simpler by stirring dry stuffing mix with a little water and the 2 cans creamed soup.Then stir in cubed raw chicken breast, transfer to a casserole and bake. I serve with canned cranberry sauce and it tastes like thanksgiving with only ten minutes to prep!

I used some leftover chicken quarters before they went bad. I seasoned and baked them for an hour and half. I shredded the chicken and skipped greasing the dish. I used Cream of Chicken and Cream of Broccoli soup instead. The chicken flavored stove top was perfect for this. Skipped the milk also. I took the other suggestions and after mixing the soups and broth together I tossed in the stove top and mixed it enough to coat then baked immediately after covering the chicken with it. This was so amazing I got on here to review this before I was even finished eating! Served with mashed potatoes and a can of gravy leftover from Thanksgiving. :) Definitely a 10!

Stuffing is one of my favorite sides.  When I saw this recipe, I had to try it.  It was delicious and super easy.  My husband even made the comment that it was better than turkey and stuffing!

When we have this I only add enough chicken broth to get the milk, and soups creamed together.  I also mix the everything together after pouring the liquids over the top, tastes just the same, but you dont have any "dry spots" in the dressing. Also, I used either chicken tenders, or boneless skinless chicken breats. We have this recipe alot, EVERYONE loves it, including my two year old who only eats salisbusy steak!

I've been preparing this recipe for 20 years! My sister & I created it (or thought anyway) and we call it 'Sister Casserole'. It's ALWAYS a hit and cheap & easy too! I add mushrooms & whole canned green beans (drained) to regular milk & the soup/broth combo, then top with Durkee Onions or the Hawiian Sweet Onion potato chips. It's perfect for a potluck, BBQ or any meal!!! TIP: if you're preparing for a quick dinner, keep the chicken whole BUT if you don't mind an extra step, the chicken will go further if you cut it up into pieces and mix it in with the other ingredients before baking.

I changed the recipe.  I used just 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1/3 cup of 2% milk, 1 1/4 cup of homemade salt free chicken broth, 1/4 t. pepper, 8 oz of seasoned bread stuffing, 1/2 cup sauteed onion, 1 cup sauteed celery, 1/2 cup sauteed carrots, layered over cooked chopped chicken. I had read the reviews that this recipe was too salty, and had hoped by cutting out one can of soup, the salt content would be reduced, but it was still way too salty. Next time I will substitute unseasoned dried bread crumbs. I will add the seasoning to the bread crumbs.

I'm giving this 5 stars just because it was good.  I took the advice of other another review, I cook boneless chicken breast prior to going to work, seasoned with italian seasoning, garlic & some rosemary.  Did not have cream of chicken but used cream of mushroom, simple and very good ... Thank you for the idea

Very yummy!  I used boneless chicken breast and seared it in a pan with salt/pepper and a little garlic powder until done. I let it cool and then shredded it and placed it in a baking dish.  I used canned chicken stock and put that in a sauce pan with fresh celery and onion and low boiled until celery and onions were done then I mixed the broth, milk, and soups together. I put the stuffing (pepridge farms seasoned) on top of the chicken and poured the liquid on top of the stuffing.  I then mixed it all together and baked.  It turned out great, cripsy on top and moist in the middle.  I just dont know what to serve with it!  I guess just a side of broccoli or some brussel sprouts.

This was okay. I sauted chopped boneless chicken cutlets in 1 tbls. olive oil with 1 small chopped onion, 2 cloves minced garlic and black pepper.This recipe calls for 8 oz. of dry bread stuffing. This does not mean 1 cup. It means 8 oz. net weight, which is a little more than 1/2 of a 15 oz. bag. I didn't have any problems with it being soupy, as others did. This is a good way to use leftover chicken.

I make a version of this in the Crockpot and wanted some but didn't want to wait 7 hours.  This worked well, but I like the way it turns out in the Crockpot better because the chicken turns out more tender and it has the flavor from the soup soaked right into the breast.

Tasted just like the stuffing. Was really good, but I could have just made the stuffing separate with separate baked chicken and would probably be better.

I just made this earlier today and have to say that simplicity is delicious. I followed the recipe as written. After layering all ingredients in my casserole dish, I decided to pour everything  into my mixing bowl and blend well in order to completely saturate the stuffing mix before baking. It turned out beautifully! A hit with everyone :}

For the most part my family loved this dish.  I thought it was a little too creamy, maybe next time I'll use less than 1 can of each creamed soup.  Also, I think the cook time might be off (I guess every oven varies though) because I had to continue for an extra 10 minutes and I feel it could have used an extra 10 after that even.

This was absolutely fabulous. I made it just as the recipe was written. The only changes I made was I used Cream of Chicken with herbs and I sprinkled garlic powder over the chicken in the pan. I boiled chicken tenders in chicken broth (from cubes) and then used that broth in the recipe. This will become a regular!

I will have to try again.  Used Sweet Condensed Milk instead of Evaporated Milk.  Ruined the recipe.  Bad error.  Pay attention, unlike me.

Just as good as I remember it when my Mama used to make it for me growing up.  I did make a couple changes.  I used a 14 oz bag of cornbread stuffing mix and during the last 15 minutes of baking I drizzled 3 ounces of melted butter on top.

This was good and came together pretty quickly. I added fresh ground black pepper, minced onion, celery seed, poultry seasoning and used heavy whipping cream instead of evaporated milk. Made with two cans of canned chicken. Went well with a caesar salad and cranberry orange relish on the side. That said, it was very unattractice -- topped it with mozzarella cheese and parmesan to make it look better.

I did change the recipe a little, I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs, and put them in the 9 x 13 raw, instead of cream of celery i used cream of mushroom, but only because that was what I had.  
My family loved it.

this recipe was very good, however i made some changes. I took out the cream of celery and added another creamy soup. Also It was a little dry so next time I'm going to add a little more broth and mix it all up instead of trying to layer it.

This dish was incredible!  I used cream of mushroom and cream of chicken for the soups.  My family raved over it and asked for seconds!  I served this with green beans and a salad.

This is such an easy and delicious recipe!  I only changed one thing... I reserved some of the stuffing to sprinkle on top - this adds a bit of cruchy texture and a nice appearance.  Also, I covered it until the last 10 minutes and it was perfect!  I will be making this again for sure!

This was soooo good! I used cornbread stuffing and added some spices while boiling the chicken (season all, onion powder, garlic powder, pepper) and replaced the cream of celery soup with an additional can of cream of chicken soup. This turned out great and I will definitely be making it again! Thanks for the great recipe!

Made it for my guy and he absolutely loves it! Even his friends that are picky eaters request it too! After a couple combinations, I use the 99% fat free soups, reduced sodium chicken stock and pepperidge farm's herb seasoned stuffing.

Highly Recommend!

Great idea.  I made corn bread, crumbled it up, and made a bechemel sauce with chicken stock and milk, so much better than canned soup.  I also added some carrots and corn, and poked holes down to the bottom of the casserole dish so the sauce could permeate through.  WOW, what a great building block of a recipe.

This is amazing. I only change the cream of celery soup for cream of mushroom. Simply because my family doesn't like celery. Very good I make it usually once a month.

Made the recipe as listed, it was good - simple, warm and filling. It was relatively easy to make, I boiled my chicken and saved the rest of the chicken juice for another meal. I think next time I may bake my chicken and use breasts and maybe try cranberries :) Thanks for sharing, my boyfriend has already had seconds!

Definately very easy and flavorful but requires a few changes.  To make this recipe more figure friendly, I used whole wheat stuffing, chicken breast which I cubed and sauted with black pepper, garlic, fresh celery and half an onion.  Using low sodium soups is a necessity (it was still a little saltier than I would have liked), and it was also a little too soupy.  I will make this dish again, but using only half of the soup mixture and adding in a lot more veggies.

This was very tasty, I used boneless chicken cut into cubes and sauteed in garlic and pepper prior to adding in - turned out very well. My husband liked it and even took all the leftovers to work the next day.

My husband really liked this recipe.  I am always looking for new things to cook and always checking this website for new ideas.  I used chicken breasts, cut in cubes.  I cooked them for a bit in a skillet with my favorite seasonings before placing them in the casserole dish.  I also tried an idea from another person and combined all my other ingredients in a bowl and poured over the chicken.  Came exactly how I thought it would...a real nice comfort food on a cold winter's night.

This is soooo good!  I have made this several times already and will never make another type of stuffing agian!  The only tip I really have is don't use the generic cream of celery or cream of chicken.  I used campbells and it was great, then I used some of the off brands to save money and it was horrible!  We couldn't even finish it.  So it you think it came out wrong then just switch the brand of creams that your using and it should be great!  Delicious recipe!!!!

Not sure what happened here, but mine turned out REALLY soupy.  The box of stuffing I had was only 6oz (not 8) and I didn't have any evaporated milk, so I used whole milk instead.  The combination of those things must have made this recipie not work at all.  I think one can of soup an no milk would have been plenty for this recipe.

My family devoured this. Served with garlic mashed potatoes secret recipe and big fat chewy choc chip cookies. great dinner all recipes rocks. I doubled the stuffing mix from aldi chicken stuffing and roasted to 2 bone-in ch bst with garlic powder and s/p for 45 mins at 350 then cooled and I mixed all the ingredients together and used a whole can of evaporated milk since I doubled the stuffing 6oz pkgs. and it turned out beautiful. Hope you enjoy.

I followed the suggestion to make this like "Thanksgiving."  I used rotisserie chicken & pulled it apart for the base. For stuffing I used cornbread stuffing (Stove Top).  I added chopped up pieces of celery & craisin (dried cranberries).  I used 1 1/2 cups of milk instead of evaporated milk. Added the soups & chicken stock.  I wanted the stuffing to be soft & mushy & tone down the spices from the stuffing.  Served with a nice green salad, sliced whole cranberry sauce, brown gravy & green bean casserole--it was exactly like Thanksgiving.  It was even better the next day when the stuff got stiffer from being in the fridge.  My family voted it--make it again, please.

This recipe is a favorite in our house.  I use boneless/skinless chicken breasts.  I just chop them up and then cook them in the skillet.  Then I layer the bottom with it.  I also mix all of my wet ingredients and stuffing in a bowl before topping the chicken with it (and I also use canned chicken broth).  I also add breadcrumbs to the top for a little crust.

After reading a number of the other comments, I decided to add more stuffing so that the casserole wouldn't be too soupy. It was pretty dry, so next time I make it, I'll try it using the amounts in the recipe. My family thought it was awfully salty (My husband and I couldn't finish our portions, though our teen-aged daughter finished hers.), but that may be because I used boxed stuffing mix. I thought that was what the recipe specified, but it may have meant the bagged dry bread cubes, which are probably lower in sodium. I will take the advice of the person who recommended using low sodium soup. I can understand why small children would like this dish: it's creamy comfort food with no "weird" (to a kid) ingredients. It's nothing too exciting, but it's easy  and fast, which is what I was looking for. I used leftover cooked skinless, boneless chicken breasts, as I don't have time to de-bone awhole chicken. I'll make this again, but next time I'll use the quantities called for and low sodium soup.

My entire family thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  Second helpings all around!!  The only thing I would change would be to make it with low-sodium soup.  Very easy to make!!  I loved it!!

I thought that this was way to soupy.  Next time I will only use 1/2 of the soup mixture.  However, it tasted great.

This was quick and way more flavorful than I thought it might be. I used canned chicken because I had a bunch on hand and canned chicken broth. I added a little dried onion to the chicken layer. This is good and quick ans we will be having it again.

I made this recipe when my mother-in-law was here. She loved it. It was so good infact, that my children(even the picky one)  finish their plates and asked for more.

If I hadn't tried the other chicken & stuffing cassarole recipe on here.. this one may have been pretty good..  But after trying both, this one is definitely lacking in ingredients!!  The other recipe listed on here tastes so much better with all the fresh added veggies, etc.   It's ok, just not near as good as the other one on here.

Love this recipe!  After making it several times here are the changes I have made for a easy meal. 2 - 12.5 oz cans chunk chicken, 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 - 12 oz can evaporated milk, 2 - 6 oz boxes of chicken flavored stuffing and 1 1/4 cups chicken broth. I mix it all in a bowl and put it into a 9 x 13 pan to cook for 45 minutes at 350. Sometimes we throw in a can of mushrooms too. It is not a soupy mixture at all. Everyone in my family absolutely loves it,  thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I made this for an office pottluck luncheon and came home with an empty dish! Instead of boiling the chicken, I used 8 boneless chicken breasts, seasoned them with salt and pepper, then baked them for about 30 minutes, until juices were clear. After they cooled, I chopped them in bite-sized cubes (about 1/2 inch size). I did this the night before so the chicken went in the fridge until the next morning when I assembled the dish. I also mixed together the sauce ingredients the night before and put it in the fridge until needed. Like another reviewer, I also used the cream of chicken with herbs for extra flavor. Since I didn't boil the chicken, I used canned chicken broth. After everything was assembled in the dish, I used a fork to poke around on top of the casserole before it went in the oven, making sure the sauce was well distributed. Turned out great, moist, flavorful, and like I said, no leftovers!

This was very good! I was expecting a mushy mess of casserole (because that's what I expect with a chicken casserole), but to my delight the layering of the chicken and dressing kept the dressing kind of crunchy in parts. Also, I added french fried onions on top for more crunch and texture. The only thing I would say about this recipe is the poster didn't really say to "cook" the chicken. To those of us that cook it's pretty obvious, but to those who don't regularly, you should precook the chicken FIRST. ;) I just used two huge leftover breasts I had and got the chicken broth from a can/box. My whole family (including two teenage boys and a toddler) loved it! Quick, easy and tasty. Yummo! :)

I liked this recipe, but I would make some changes next time.  I would add some vegetables and I would use cubed stuffing.  I used the crumbled type and it all mixed into the sauce.  Thanks for the recipe- I will use it again with the changes!

This turned out well. I had to adapt to what I had on hand, used less soup & added sour cream instead of evaporated milk. Also, used cream of mushroom intead of cream of celery. I used 1/2 of the chicken broth from boiling the chicken in the casserole and 1/2 of it to make mashed potatoes to go with.  The whole family liked it.

I was very happy with this recipe, although I made some unplanned changes.  Due to some poor planning, I used frozen ckn breasts, frozen veggies and the rest of the ingredients.  I put them in my slowcooker on high for about 5 1/2 hours and it was fantastic.  Can out more like a stew so next time I make it I'll put cubed potateos in as well.  Not the healthiest meal, but will definately be making again!!

Great comfort food.  I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup. I added some shredded cheddar cheese on top of chicken.

Really good and quick to prepare.  Followed ingredients exactly but assembly a little different.  Cut chicken up in bite-size pieces and mixed in the stuffing mix then baked in casserole dish.  Baked as directed then froze half for a later meal.  Will make again.

Awesome recipe. It mixes up in a flash, doesn't take long to bake...and it tastes so rich and creamy. Definitely comfort food. I added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables to make it more hearty...too yummy! Hubby said he even likes it better than his favorite Pot Pie that I make!

This was great.  It was like Thanksgiving all in one pan and so easy.  I added a can of corn, sauteed onion and celery in some chicken broth and used stove top for the stuffing right out of the box.

Made for the first time tonight.  One son said it is the 4th best chicken I make.  My husband said it was a little mushy but liked it.  Next time I will use a little less chicken broth.  Thanks for sharing!!

I have been making a recipe simular to this for a few years. Although I par boil chicken breast, then shred them. Stir the sauce mixture in with shredded chicken, top with shredded mozzerala or provolone and then top with the stuffing..delish! Next time i'll try adding celery, onion and carrots =) Sounds yummy

4.5 actually!  Very simple and tasty.  I cut the recipe in half and used 1 can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup.  I had no problem with mine being dry, it was very moist (next time I will either reduce the liquid or increase the bread crumbs).  

The flavor was amazing, I used an herb stuffing mix with white and whole weat bread and boiled my chicken with onion and celery.  After the casserole was done my roommate and I mixed in some baby green peas and it was a wonderful addition.  This will be made again, with different veggies added to make it a complete "one dish" meal.

Thanks for the great base!

Made this last evening for the family. Everyone enjoyed it. It was an easy and tasty dish to prepare. My only modifications were adding sauted onions, garlic, celery, fresh rosemary and sage to the stuffing mix. This would make for a very fine "potluck" entree.

Quick, easy chicken dish + stuffing -- What more could you ask for?!?  :)  This was a great way to use defrosted chicken breasts 30 minutes before I wanted to serve dinner to my family. Yes, when you put it on the table it looks like a big pan of brown mush, but it is more of a quick, comfort food than anything.  I used canned cranberries for a side, as one other reviewer kindly suggested and the flavors together reminded me of Thanksgiving. Kind of fattening and unattractive, but I would definitely make it again in a pinch.

The first time I tried this I made it exactly as printed. It was a bit blah. The next time I sauted onion, celery, and mushrooms.  I also added fresh ground pepper.  Yummy!

Your standard stick to your ribs casserole.  I added some frozen (defrosted) chopped broccoli to the soup mixture and about 5 minutes before bringing it out of the oven I topped it with some mozzerella cheese.  VERY TASTY and very effective in hiding broccoli from a toddler who doesn't like it!

I added a few touches to the recipe like roast chicken from the grocery deli rather than boiled chicken.  I also added a pound of cooked broccoli on top of the stuffing layer, and 2 cups of low fat sharp cheddar cheese on top with coarse freshly ground black pepper on top of that.  The cheddar cheese and pepper went on in the last five minutes of cooking time.  It was a one-dish balanced meal, and tasted great.  Thanks for the great idea.

Made this last night & thought it was pretty good. It is easy & was well received by the family. I used a rotisserie chicken, & since I was out of cream of celery, used cream of mushroom w/ garlic instead. It looked like way too much liquid after mixing all the wet ingredients, but the stuffing soaked it right up & it was creamy & good. Paired with fresh vegetables, the empty plates told the tale!

This recipe was good but it annoyed me because nothing is sold in the proportions that it asks you to use: Stove Top stuffing comes in 6 oz or 12 oz.  Evap milk comes in 5 oz or 12 oz.  Chicken broth comes in cans of about 2 cups.  So, I did make some changes.  First, I wasn't about to cook a whole chicken for this recipe, so I cooked 1.5 lbs of chicken breast in wide pan with just enough water to cover.  I brought to boil, simmered for 10 minutes, then turned off the heat, covered and let it stand for 15 minutes more.  I cut it up into small pieces.  I used the full 12 oz of stuffing, the full can of chicken broth and light cream instead of evaporated milk, since it comes in a one cup container.  I added 10 oz of frozen broccoli and just mixed everything together before putting in the baking dish.  I thought it came out great; the stuffing was light and fluffy, not soggy and I didn't find it salty like other reviewers.  Next time I will wait to add the broccoli in the last 10 minutes, though, because it got mushy.  I think with these proportions, it might even be able to support the full 12 oz can of evaporated milk, so I will try that next time.  I'm sure this would be fabulous with sauteed onion and celery, but it would turn an easy recipe into something a little more time consuming.

The ultimate comfort food! This has become a staple in our house.I do cheat a little--I pre-bake a bunch of chicken breasts or thighs instead of using the whole chicken, and I use Swanson chicken broth. I'm sure it's even better when you do it all from scratch, but our quicker version is still very good! My fiancé prefers it with cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery, though I think it's good both ways. I also like to sprinkle shredded cheddar cheese on top before baking.

THIS was easy and delicious...The only thing I did differently was I started with poaching the chicken (but had to boil it more anyway!)
I put chopped onion and herbs de provence, salt and pepper in the water I cooked the chicken in.
I used Pepperidge Farm herbs and spices stuffing mix. 
Very delicious! (Comfort food!) Creamy, tasty. I will make it again!

This was very good.  My mom made something very similar.  I added some frozen peas and sautéed onions as well as garlic over the chicken before the stuffing and wet layer.  Also didn't have evaporated milk so just used whole milk and it was fine.  Was easy and definitely a crowd pleaser.

The only thing I changed was to use uncooked boneless breast and thighs.  As soon as I read "Good Mornig America", I read on and decided...this is a winner.  It's great and the whole family loved it...no leftovers and thats a good thing.

This recipe was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving dinner.  However we added 2 sticks of chopped celery and 1 large chopped onion to the mix.  We also added in the broth (not the noodles) from a can of Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup.  The family loved it.

not good.  Followed exactly except that I added some greens beans with the chicken.  The stuffing was crunchy on top but mushy in the middle.  Not a great flavor either.  I really wonder what I did wrong, cause this was not good!

This is definitely a keeper. So simple and sooooo good. I added a large onion sautéed in olive oil, used 5 boiled chicken tenderloins cut into chunks, used the reduced fat soups and a whole can of fat free evaporated milk. We do not use the boxed stuffing, so I used fat free salad croutons and added 1/2 tsp. of poultry seasoning.  It was delicious!! Can't wait to make it again. Thanks for a super recipe!

Awesome! I made this exactly as stated but reserved some of the stuffing to sprinkle on top the last 5 minutes of cooking. It gave it a nice crunch on top! My husband who is repulsed by the word 'casserole' loved this!! Great dish to bring to a pot luck or make as comfort food! Thanks!

The reviews were all over the board as far as suggestions. After reading all of them it seems it all comes down to the stuffing you used. That determinded how salty or seasoned it turned out.

I can see how this recipe would be good, but as is..it came out overwhelmingly salty..and I consider myself a salt lover. That was my only complaint though. I was telling my mom about this recipe and she said she made the same thing only the "cream of..." soups were replaced with gravy.. I think I'll search for that recipe next time because this was just too salty for me to make again

Delicious!  Reminded me of when I was a kid.  I used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups, as I didn't have any cream of celery.  I used chicken breasts, and I also added some sour cream.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe is so quick and easy!  I did make the following changes, but it turned out delicious anyway!  Instead of a whole chicken I only had two very large chicken breasts (maybe close to 2lbs of meat).  I boiled them and then I added about 2 cups of frozen green beans (thawed) to make up the difference.  I also used 1 cup of buttermilk instead of evaporated milk - REALLY good substitution - LOTS of flavor from it.  Everything turned out great and it was like all major food groups in one!  Tasty :)

Very good recipe.  My husband doesn't like stuffing, so I wanted something just for myself with leftovers and gave this a try.  It was wonderful.  I halved the recipe, used about 1 lb of chicken tenders and one can of cream of celery soup, and it gave this a wonderful flavor.  I also added diced carrots, which I will pre-cook next time since they were still crunchy.  I may add some grated garlic next time.  There are endless possibilities with this recipe - thanks so much for posting!

This is a great recipe! Very easy and even easier and moister if you buy an already cooked rotisserie chicken to use.  I have made it both ways and prefer the pre-cooked chicken.

My boyfriends 5 yr old ate it and loved it she doesn't eat anything. this one is a winner and I will be making this often. I did use cream of chicken and cream of mushroom instead of the cream of celery soup. I also added shredded chedder cheese the last 10 minutes of cooking.

I used the frozen chicken breast I keep in the freezer for other dishes.  I thawed several out & boiled them with a little salt & pepper. Instead of the bread stuffing I used the chicken flavor stuffing.  I was out of milk- of all kinds except for instant, so I used that(thanks to the kids).  Easy dinner that used items from the pantry. Will be added to our rotation of meals! Thanks!

I think this recipe was average. I even added craisins to liven up the flavor. I might make this once in a blue moon but not on a regular basis. My husband said it was decent and my 3 year old ate most of it with some coaxing. Lacked flavor.

thank u for the great idea! It was delicious and a keeper I thought everything was fine on your original recipe. Boiling a whole chicken kept it moist, I used the water from the boiled chiken as broth instead of can which also would balance out saltiness and also added a can of french style green beans for veggie and celery to stuffing. Made a side of mashed potato and gravy and it was good to go. thanks.

I need dinners that are simple and consume as little time as possible.  I assembled this casserole the night before and put it in the oven after work.  My whole family loved it.  I'll keep this recipe in the "box" for future meals!

I LOVED this dish!! It is very simple both in preparation and appearance, but extremely tasty. I was looking for a recipe that would taste similar to Stouffer's Chicken and Stuffing Bake and this is it. While it's delicious just as is, next time I might add onions, carrots, or celery just to be a little creative.

Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe! My grown "kid" loved it. This is certainly "a keeper." Would be great to bring to a church pot-luck. Now one of my family's favorites. God Bless!

I made this the other night and loved it! The only changes I made was I used cream of mushroom soup plus the cream of chicken soup and I didn't feel like cooking chicken after a long shift at work, so I really cheated and used 2 cans of shredded chicken, turned out fantastic!

We all like different things. I have a pretty simple pallet. That being said, this was devoid of flavor, didn't care for the mouth texture and visually unappealing. But my husband seemed to be okay with it. I won't make it again.

Recipe was great! I modified it by using boneless, skinless chicken thighs and breasts. I added my own seasoning including thyme, poultry seasoning and black pepper, then I browned the chicken. I added chicken stock and some boiling water to cook down the chicken. I also added a layer of cranberry sauce to the shredded chicken before adding the stuffing. Consistently was fantastic and it tasted like a Christmas casserole. This one was a winner.

Tossed boneless chicken tenders in a mixture of  garlic, onion powder, paprika,  salt, pepper, poultry seasoning  in plastic bag. Refrigerated it for 30 mins. Added same seasonings to soup mixture except paprika,  salt. Covered with tinfoil and baked for hour. Turned out very tasty. I will make it again.

I added Sage, Rosemary and Thyme. I also tossed in a couple of  small Granny Smith apples and about a cup o f onion and a couple of cloves of garlic. And then I used small can of Hatch chopped chilis. I have made it as written several times, and it is delicious, but this time I had some produce that needed a place to go.

Made this last week. So good my husband requested it again for dinner this week. Added a layer of frozen corn before pouring on the sauce. Froze the leftovers and tasted great reheated for lunch.

Very good!  My teenaged kids loved it and so did my husband.  We all had seconds.   I think I will add sautéed celery & onion next time, as some others did, b/c it is quite mushy, & I think the added texture & flavor will make it just perfect!

I used cream of onion instead of celery.
I didn't like it, 
I don't know what it was, but it had a funny taste.

This was delicious, albeit underwhelming. The chicken might be more enjoyable left as large pieces, like the old-school Campbell's Soup chicken and rice recipes. Salt and spices necessary!

This was an easy recipe to follow and turned out well.  I made it very "southern" an added celery and boiled eggs to the mix.  I also mixed it all together in a big bowl.  Like many others, I also had a problem with too much liquid after cooking.   I used over half the package of stuffing, which equates out to 8 oz by weight, but still had too much liquid.  I let it cook an extra 15 minutes, but it was still there.  When I refrigerated it the liquid went away.  I think this could have been solved if I had reduced the liquids a little or added more stuffing.  I understand why the recipe has you pour the liquid over the contents, because that way it's probably easier to get the right consistency.  

I will probably make this again, but probably during the Thanksgiving and holiday seasons.

I really enjoyed this, easy to make and used up leftover chicken. My boyfriend however found it good but salty (I did not). If you are salt sensitive I would recommend low sodium soups. Will make again...great with cranberry sauce.

I read the recipe and liked most of it but as an old fashioned cook
I just knew I had to make some changes.  I took 4 thawed deboned skinless chicken breasts and cooked them for 5 minutes in hot boiling lightly salted waster. Then I chopped 1/2 cup of onion and 1 cup of celery. I cooked them in 1/4 cup of butter till soft. When chicken was done I placed it in greased 13 x 9in oven dish, covered chicken with dry dressing cubes, spread onion mixture over that and added soup mixture. I baked for 45 mins at 350 covered with alum foil cover.YUM Delicious

This recipe gets 4 stars for ease and simplicity.  However, it does need sautéed onions and celery added.  I used a 12 oz. bag of stuffing and added a little more chicken broth.

YES! Tastes great as is or with embellishments. I added celery and some sage, pepper, marjoram, basil, and thyme because I like lots of spice flavor. I used a reduced sodium cream of chicken and a regular cream of celery. If I could have found reduced sodium celery soup, I would recommend that, too. For me, it's just a tad salty and I don't tend to add extra when using canned and boxed ingredients. I do recommend this and will make it again with other reduced sodium ingredients if I can find them.

I have made this recipe several times and each time I make it I add something different; last time I made this I added some sliced fresh mushrooms and continued layering in the baking dish.  It was excellent! Just use your imagination and you can come up with some pretty good combinations and like one cook added just add a garden salad and a dessert and you have a scrumptious dinner!

This was really good.  I used what I had on hand and ended up with the following changes/additions to the recipe:  14 oz Pepperidge Farm Stuffing.  3 cans chicken breast. 1.5 cups broth from the canned chicken.  Cr. Celery, Cr. Mushroom, Cr, Chicken soup. 12 oz canned milk. 2 stalks celery chopped.  I mixed the stuffing with the soups/liquids & celery, added a tsp of poultry seasoning & poured over the chicken.  I think I used a bit too much liquid as I had to cook mine approx 1.5 hours to get it "set".  Next time I will reduce the liquids by 1/2 cup or so.  The flavor is awesome.  Mild, yet satisfying.  Served with green beans & Cranberry Sauce...and a glass of Moscato.  Yum.  Comfort food at its best!

this just needs something else!  Bland! (I left out the Cream of celery & half the milk -- it just seemed way too runny!) and added 1/2 cup of (re-hydrated) dried cranberries, 1/2 cup chopped pecans and some orange zest, sage & poultry seasoning.  I realize I totally changed this recipe, but because the first time I made this, it was boring!

We liked this one.  I added dried onions and 2 pinches of dried sage cause we love onions.  But otherwise made no changes.  This is one I will add to my recipe book to make again.  Green beans and pickled beets and I had a great meal.
Thanks.

I added cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of celery.  I also marinated my chicken ahead of time, and that was a mistake, it was too much.  I used chicken breasts and chicken bullion for the broth.

This was really good we enjoyed it immensely!! I changed the chicken to breasts and used chicken broth,also added garlic and precooked the chicken first....The thing I will change next time is using low sodium soup and broth this was crazy salty for my liking. I served it with cranberry sauce...we will be enjoying this again!

The chicken turned out very tasty, but the stuffing was a too moist, so I added extra cooking time which only helped so much. If it weren't for the kick from the apples, I don't think this would have been a very good combo. I used boneless chicken breast, boxed stuffing that I added apples with (sauteed over stove with butter before adding to dry mix), cream of celery soup, cream of chicken soup, and evaporated milk.

Next time I would only use cream of chicken, as I just discovered I don't like cream of celery.  It's a fine dish, average really.

Vey good!! I used a rotissary chicken, I just tok of the skin and put chunks of meat on the bottom of a pan. I also used low sodium soups, I think it would have been way too salty with the regular kind. I also added crazins wich were delish! My 5 year old cleaned her plate which is rare! Deffinetly will make again and again!

My girlfriend prepared the stuffing before adding it to the chicken and I found that really made it better rather than having dry stuffing just poured over.

This was an awesome recipe. I used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken, and one cup of broth from bullion. I also added some frozen peas and carrots and it was great! I did take the advice of others and mixed the stuffing mix in with the soups-I wanted to be sure it didn't end up crunchy. I would absolutly suggest giving this a try-it's like a pot pie!

Very quick and easy.  I added a little bit of celery for crunch and it turned out great.  The leftovers put on french bread rolls made perfect Thanksgiving-style sandwiches!  Will definitely make this one again!

I made this last night. It is amazing! I also used an already roasted chicken from the store. I also used Pepperidge Farm corn bread stuffing(that's what we like). We didn't find it too salty but you definitely would not want to add more. I also made the CountryGreen Beans from this site to go with it. Simple tasty dinner.

My husband LOVES stuffing - so he went nuts over this!  i used a store bought cooked chicken and a little of the juice that was in the bottom (about 1/4c) to make it a little richer.  I thought it was a little salty - next time I will use low sodium cream of chicken and celery soups.

I added a couple cups of broccoli florets and some swiss cheese and it was a hit with the whole family.  Next time I will cut down on the amount of chicken broth because it was a tiny bit runny.  It could've been because of the broccoli.

This was so yummy.  I didn't have a whole bird on hand, so I use 3 frozen leg quarters and 2 frozen breasts.  Placed them in the crockpot on low all day, then de-boned and shredded and prepared as directed from there.  So easy and grandsons ate like 4 helpings!!

This was okay taste-wise. It was very easy to make, but it was too salty for my taste. The husband liked it, but I don't think it will be on his list of meals to ask for.

This was very good. I used chicken breasts b/c I like only white meat. I did add a little more stuffing after reading other reviews. I used 1&1/2 bags of stove top (about 10 oz.) and probably could have used the other half of the second bag. I also used chicken broth. We ate broccoli on the side, but may try onion/celery/carrots mixed in the casserole next time. Thanks for the recipe...my family enjoyed it.

This tasted pretty good the first time but is pretty unhealthy. It didn't make very good leftovers. The saltiness became overpowering, even though I used low-sodium soups. We didn't eat the leftovers. Maybe a low-sodium stuffing mix would have helped.

Very good and so easy.  I think it took longer to open the soup than put the whole thing together.  I used left over turkey. Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  I think it was a little salty.  I was fine for me but I will probably try the low sodium soups next time.

I needed an easy do-ahead recipe for my Christmas party and this was the ideal dish. Like others I used breasts instead of a whole chicken.  I added chopped onion and craisons to the stuffing, as well as Bell's Seasoning. For side dishes, I added two dishes from Allrecipes - Make-Ahead Mashed Potatoes and Green Bean Blue Cheese Salad. My serving dishes were empty at the end of the evening and I received rave reviews.

We are having this again this evening for supper, great recipe. We tried it as written the first time and ever since have added seasonings and other ingredients per our taste. We now make our own homemade dressing to put in it, however still top the dish with the soup and broth mixture. We use this recipe at least once a month and works out just great for the two of us.

I added a little extra chicken and accidently added the stuffing after then wet ingredients. I was able to savlage it by mixing it up a bit. I also added some frozen broccoli. YUMMY. I have been asked to make this again for dinner.

Great recipe.  I added frozen brocoli florets to the bottom of my dish and then added the chicken etc.  I ended with seasoned stuffing and topped with the sauce and cheese.  My family wants it again and I am making it for a luncheon this weekend.  Great and easy!

My family loved this! Its like Thanksgiving anytime and its easy. I used a rotisserie chicken already cooked from the grocery store and pretty much followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I did use whole milk instead of evaporated. Great recipe!

My husband loves this! It's the perfect recipe if you're craving Thanksgiving taste.  I add celery/carrot/onion sauteed to the stuffing mix

Very good my boyfriend loved it! I am giving it 4 stars though cause it was kind of soupy. Next time I would cut back on the liquid ingredients. I will definitely make this again!

My 5 kids love this recipe and they now call it "Thanksgiving in a bucket"...don't ask, I have no idea! The flavors mix so well together and really compliment one another. The Craisins give it just the kick it needs. This is a keeper.

i loved this dish. i was craving stuffing so bad and this was so easy and hit the spot perfectly! i did make a lot of changes though,lol. i cut the recipe in half because its just the two of us, i used one can of cream of chicken, my own homemade chicken broth, and the half cup of evaporated milk it called for. i sauted the chicken with lots of garlic and celery and added it to the bottom of my baking dish. poured a can f corn on top, added the stuffing and then the sauce. when i pulled it out of the oven it looked a little dry so i ended up pouring the rest of the evaporated milk on top. it turned out PERFECT.

This recipe is fantastic when you know you are going to have a few busy nights! Makes lots of leftovers. I boiled the chicken breast with some celery, onion and poultry seasoning for flavor. I doubled the amount of dry stuffing - this makes a nice layer - and it helps it to still be crunchy the next night! Came out fantastic!

I made a few changes to this recipe to zip it up a bit and kick up the nutritional value and it still turned out just OK.  It wasn't bad but my family didn't think it was great either.  I used chicken breasts that I browned in a little oil first.  Layered them in a dish topped with a can of Cream of Mushroom soup, 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1 cup frozen corn, 1 cup frozen peas, 1/2 a diced green bell pepper.  Mixed it all up and spread it over the chicken.  Made up a box of stuffing and spread that over the top.  Baked it covered with foil about 40 minutes and then removed the foil and baked another 10 minutes.  Turned out OK but I don't think this one will end up in my "Family Favorites" binder.

Really easy and delicious. I used chicken tenders instead of a whole chicken and it was amazing. My kids ate it all!

This is an excellent recipe if you are pressed for time.  The chicken was very tender and the stuffing added aot of flavor.  I would suggest cutting back on some of the liquid because the stuffing was a little too moist for my taste.  I would recommend this recipe and will make it again.
