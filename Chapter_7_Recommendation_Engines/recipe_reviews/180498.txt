Great dip!  My Bingo crowd thought it was a fancy sweet dip.  I had pound cake, graham crackers, strawberries and butter wafer crisps to accompany this yummy dip.

I served this with "Fruity Fun Skewers" at a get-together and most of the guests passed it by, preferring their fruit without.  I think maybe it was the idea of a fruit dip rather than the dip itself that wasn't all that appealing. I thought it was tasty, but I think it could benefit by some sort of liqueur for flavor, Amaretto for instance,  and might also be better lightened up with some fresh whipped cream.

Wow! When I saw this recipe at a ladies church get together I thought it was cottage cheese. I stayed away from it until I was informed that it was actually creamcheese and marshmallow cream! I tasted this and fell in love! Super sweet treat! You have to eat it!

When I make this I add a small containre cool whip(it's a little stiff without the cool whip to thin it out a little bit) and a few drops of red food coloring just to make it more apealing. The flavor is so good I could eat it with a shovel. try it, you'll love it, everyone does

Traditionally, I am not a fan of marshmallow creme, (just too darn sticky for me) but for this recipe, I would use it again.  Super easy, and yummy!  I did add a tiny bit of lemon juice, but that's just personal taste preference... :)

This is a wonderfully simple and delicious dip!  I made it for a holiday dinner, and added a little colored gel(usually used for frosting) it blended nicely and added a touch of color.  It worked perfectly.
