i have read the other reviews and as i am also danish i would suggest using 1 jar of red current jelly instead of the sugar,1/2 cup vinigar only a little water and simmer for about 2 hours stirring every so often, this is the way my mother made it for the last 50 years and it always turns out, it freezes really well as well, so you can make a double batch and take it out when needed.

My German mother makes this red cabbage.  It has a wonderful sweet/sour flavor.  She adds just a tiny dab of bacon drippings to it before serving and it is one of my absolute favorite side dishes!

This was a really good recipe for red cabbage.  I cut the ingedients in half.  Quick and easy to make.  Kept a bright red color. A real winner.

This recipe was just wonderful.  I made it exactly as written and thought it just a bit too sour. I did reduce the vinegar and sugar just a bit. It is wonderful along side of the Sweet and Sour Pork Patties recipe.  I served the Sweet and Sour Pork Patties, Danish Christmas Red Cabbage and mashed potatoes for a after Christmas dinner.  It was a huge hit. Also,  this recipe cans very easily.  I pack mine hot into clean pint jars leaving about 1/4 inch head space (make sure to put in lots of liquid, too) I process them in a hot water bath for about 12 mins.  Remove jars and let them sit until you hear the lids pop.  Last over a year this way.

I just made this for T-giving and test tasted it... Mmmmmm very good! I was surprised by the amt of sugar called for, so I substituted Equal's Sugar Lite for 1/2 c. and then 1 1/2 c. sugar. That seemed to be fine. I also ran out of white vinegar & ended up using red wine vinegar for 1 1/2 cups of the vinegar called for. That worked great too! I diced up one apple and added that while cooking. This recipe is a keeper!

I have made this for years, as mentioned, excellent w/any plain meat, pork, roast, poultry, etc.  You can adjust by keeping the proportion of sugar/vinegar. I always use cider vinegar and add some cloves.  First came across the recipe as a german dish to serve w/Saurbraten. I like it better than the thick sauced ones you see in some restaurants. The flavor is bolder!

I shredded this cabbage lenghtwise and fine, and found it to be too sweet.  Also, I found when dishing it out into a serving bowl, the vinegar took my breath away.  I will make it again, but will significantly reduce the amount of sugar.

My husband and I just enjoyed this recipe soooo much, didn't change a thing!  I will be making this again, what a treat. Just wondering when it says to shred the cabbage, like coleslaw?  I just cut it up in thin slices, would appreciate hearing from others as to what you do.

I always make red cabbage for Christmas and Thanksgiving meals.  I cut mine up in Strips and add some oil to a pot and add 1 chopped onion and a cut up apple.  I cook this for about 5 minutes then add the cabbage.  I put in about 1/2 cup of Red Wine Vinegar and a couple of tablespoons of white sugar, salt and pepper.  A couple of bay leaves and I  peel a onion and leaving it whole I stick whole cloves, about 8 or 9 into the onion and add this to the pot of cabbage.  Bring to a boil and then turn it down to a simmer and cook until the cabbage is tender.  Stir often.  To serve remove the whole onion and bay leaves and discard.
My kids take what is left home, everyone raves about this.

I followed the recipe to the T except that I sliced rather than shredded the cabbage.  This cabbage tasted and looked exactly like what my Danish mother-in-law prepared for every special meal.  It was delicious.

I've never had hot cabbage with sugar and vinegar. This was also the first time I've ever eaten red cabbage cooked. It was delicious! This dish is good hot or cold! It's simple but is nicely crisp and flavorful. We served it with homemade macaroni and cheese. It was a great dinner. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Leave out the sugar and put red currant jelly instead and hardly any water, just simmer, very low heat with the lid on for an hour (at least). I tend to shred the cabbage fairly fine, if you want bigger chunks you probably have to cook it an hour and a half - two hours. 

We always cook this Christmas Eve morning (Christmas Eve is the main celebration in Europe) to get the fragrance necessary for the Yule spirit :)

My mom is Danish. Growing up, she always bought pickled red cabbage in a jar. When I moved to a different state, I found that I could no longer purchase this mainstay of holiday dinners anywhere in my area. I figured out how to recreate it from scratch (coming up with the recipe that is just like this on my own-- Red cabbage must be in my blood!). Now family members are asking me to make this for them and asking if I can can it. Can this be canned like sauerkraut?

This is very similiar to my mother's and grandmother's recipe for Danish red cabbage.  The only difference is my grandmother always added some cut-up dried apples when cooking.  It doesn't take away any of the flavor but tames the vinegar smell a bit.

This was excellent! I am planning to make again it was so good. Half the sugar was used when I made it and that is what I would recommend if you do not like your food too sweet.

I don't know about this.  It was ok, but I guess I'm not a fan of sweet tasting cabbage.  While it was cooking, I thought it was too strong smelling so I drained it and continued to boil it with clear water.  Wasn't bad tho...

I used the suggestion that Gitte1 made, to use red currant jam and vinegar instead of the white sugar and vinegar. It was good! But -- I started with a small head of cabbage and a full jar of jam, the 1/2 cup of vinegar and maybe 1/4 cup of broth. It was waaay too soupy. So I had to buy another big head of cabbage to add to the sauce. It's cooking now. Delicious taste! It really cooks down, so you'll wind up with much less than you start with. And it smells up your home. But the taste is worth it!

I loved this, but I did modify it.  I used only 3/4 cup of apple cider vinegar and 3/4 cup of honey and probably around 1 1/2 cups of water.  I browned two pork chops, seasoned with salt and pepper, and put them on top of the cabbage to stew.  It was kind of smelly in the kitchen, but very tasty.

I absolutely love this recipie for any day when I feel like using up some of that uneaten lettuce in the house. However, does it matter what color the cabbage is? I am growing my own garden, and have used a few green cabbage heads, znd the recipie tasted the same. I am unaware of any difference in taste between cabbages.

I am eating this while I am typing...It is soooo good!  I did change/add just a couple of things:  used Splenda for half of the sugar called for; used half white vinegar half apple cider vinegar; added a bay leaf, two whole cloves and a small onion.  Hit the spot, I tell ya!

I really enjoyed this recipe...was looking for a way to utilize the red cabbage I had in the fridge from a previous dish and didn't want to waste it.  I think the alternative to using red currant jam given by another reviewer sounds tasty, but I followed the directions above and was very pleased with the outcome.  I do tend to enjoy vinegar - sometimes on my fries & what not, but you can taylor the amount of sweet & sour based on your personal preferences.  Thanks for sharing...it was a nice flavorful, colorful, dinner side dish :)

Very good, quite tangy and fairly sweet, you taste the vinegar much more than the sugar.  Quite a similar flavour to a tangy, non-creamy coleslaw that many Americans will have encountered.  If you want something sweet do try the jam or other reviewers' suggestions, however made as per recipe it is exactly what I expected and would make a good side dish either as a veggie (serve with sour cream) or in place of cranberry sauce.  I imagine it keeps well, too.

This recipe is wonderful!  I took it to our November supper club as an extra vegetable.  Not only does it look very pretty but everyone commented on it.  Even the men (the reason for the main vegetable) loved it.  I couldn't have been more shocked.  Will make again and again!

This was a great recipe!! Really easy, went great with grilled sausages. We added some some cooked bacon when it was done cooking. The only change I would make is use 1 cup of sugar next time. Thanks for a great recipe

This recipe was a treat, especially for the kids.  There has never been a better way to get kids to eat their cabbage.  I did not use as much sugar as the recipe called far, just 1/2 cup of Splenda, and while the cabbage is still warm added a 1-2 teaspoons of red currant jelly to each serving.  Great recipe!

I halved the recipe and it was enough for our large group with a Christmas turkey dinner. We really loved the flavour and it was nice to be able to make it ahead of time and just reheat when the rest of dinner was ready. It added gorgeous colour to the table. I will make this again and won't change a thing.

Used half the vinegar and half the sugar. Great, but I think I could reduce the sugar even more!

Made with 1 1/2 c sugar.  Still sweet. I may cut it back a bit more but I still Loved this so much. Sweet and sour cabbage. Perfect with pork chops and mashed potatoes.

The amount of sugar and vinegar are way way off . maybe a quarter cup of each. Check other recipes for the same thing.  This recipe needs to be deleted before someone gets  poisoned.

My husband is Danish so we makes this ever year for turkey, pork roast and duck. The only thing different is that I use 4 cups of water instead of three.

I made this to accompany grilled brats. It's great hot or cold and keeps forever in the fridge. I also serve it with grilled pork chops. We even got crazy and put some on grilled pastrami and Swiss sandwiches. Hmm I think I'll make a batch tomorrow!!

I tried this as a side dish at a restaurant and since both my son and I liked it, decided to make it at home. I made a half batch and used 1/2 c white vinegar and 1/2 c red wine vinegar. I also added some crispy jalapeño bacon crumbles to the dish after cooking. The texture and saltiness of the bacon worked well with the rest of the ingredients.

My family is Danish, and we make this for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It is so good on a Thanksgiving leftover sandwich! We make it a little different, though. We add a few tablespoons of red current jelly while it's simmering and usually use red wine vinegar. Also, we don't add that much water. The cabbage is watery enough as it cooks down. :)

Loved it as is but switched up a bit to suit our preferences the second time around. I traded a jar of blackcurrant jelly for the sugar and sprinkled with a generous helping of crumbled feta for serving. So very good.
