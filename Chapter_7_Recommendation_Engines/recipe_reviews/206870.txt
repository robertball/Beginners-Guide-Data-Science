SUPER SPICY!  My kids could not eat it.  I tried to add several tablespoons of brown sugar to cut the spice, it didn't work.  My husband and I loved it!  We ate it with fried corn tortillas, guacamole and cheese. I served it with Chi Chi's corn mush/casserole - it was the perfect compliment of sweet to go with the spicy.

I thought ( and so did my hubby and his friend, who are both foodies) that this was great!! I used a chuck roast instead of a brisket because it was on sale, and I cooked it in my crock pot. I did sautee the onions and garlic first, and seasoned and seared the meat as well before putting it in my crockpot on top of a layer of thick sliced potatoes and onions (you can remove them later if you want, but we kept it in the with shredded meat and it was awesome). I blended all of the ingredients following the recipe exactly except that i used 2 cans of tomatillo sauce instead of whole tomatillos and also i used dos equis amber to replace the water ( you could also use beef broth too, which I did add a bit of as well). Cooked for 5-6 hours. We made home made corn tortillas and black beans and rice. Finished off the rest of the Dos Equis...Awesome dinner!!! I will definately be making this again!!

Delicious, but yes, it was spicy. Thanks for the warning! I used half of the can of chipotles and it was still a little spicy but we loved it.

This dish is fantastic.  Very spicy, easy to make, the pressure cooker makes the brisket super-tender.  A family pleaser.

I have a new pressure cooker and was looking for a fun recipe to try - and this was it! I couldn't find canned tomatillos at my grocer so we bought a pound of regular tomatillos - and that worked fine! Also, my pressure cooker isn't the type that goes on the stove, it is a stand alone unit and it didn't have a "medium" pressure setting - so I just cooked it on high for an hour instead and it was perfect! The chipotle spice was perfect for my husband and I - but if I cooked this for the kids I would need to cut WAY back :) - 

I will make this recipe again for sure. This would probably work with any large cut of meat - though the brisket was a great way to go. VERY minimal prep and the pressure cooker does the work for you. Wonderful!

I've made this with brisket and with pork tenderloin, and I prefer it with pork. I don't own a pressure cooker so I make it in the crockpot - turns out great. One can of chipotle peppers is really really spicy, so I use about half - still a little too much for me but Husband loves it. (he says the leftovers are even better the next day) Thanks!

We just got an electric pressure cooker so I tried this recipe.  The only change I had to make was to use fresh tomatillos since I couldn't find canned (I softened them up in a skillet then followed the recipe).   The brisket turned out tender, tasty and fast.  Don't be afraid to use the entire can of chipotle peppers since the heat cooks out quite a bit.  Excellent recipe but I think I'll keep making it with fresh tomatillos as they seemed to add a good tang to it!

This is my third time to make it and my family loves it each time!! I had to cut back the chipotle for my kids, and i take some of the cooked sauce and use it to make quinoa with it as a side dish. Family favorite

This was freaking amazing! I heeded advice if others and used half the chipotles, and had to use fresh tomatillos. But i did use my pressure cooker for the first time and it was amazing. After i made it, my bf raved about it and them told me he has always hated brisket before. Guess he just never had one cooked properly before haha. We've eaten it for dinner three nights in a row . I planned on making freezer tacos with the leftovers but that didn't work out as planned. Haha. Super yum

Made this  for dinner last night and it was WONDERFUL!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of the tomatillos.  I could not find canned tomatillos, so I purchased 1 pound fresh and boiled them in water for 5 minutes until soft and then put them in the food processor.

I shredded the meat and poured several spoonfuls of the juice on it.  Served on warm flour tortillas with avocado and sour cream.  This was a hit!  I couldn't believe I made a brisket in under 2 hours after working all day! 

I should note that I used an Instant Pot and it does not have medium pressure, only low and high.  I set it to manual, high pressure and 75 minutes and it came out perfect after I let the pressure release naturally.

I used this as a crockpot pulled pork preparation and it turned out pretty good. The chipotle peppers in adobo sauce were hard to find and it would've been nice to get them seedless but overall a good prep for super spicy food lovers

This looked like such a great flavor combination, so I gave it a try. It turned out phenomenally. After reading all of the reviews, I ended up using 3/4 of a can of chipotle peppers, and it seemed to hit the spot. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Make this! So good. I used the entire can of chipotles and it was spicy but perfect. Served with flour tortillas, avo, and cilantro. Didn’t have any sour cream but it would have been good with it too. The grocery store only had enormous cuts of brisket so I used tip round and it worked well.

I've made this twice already and it's delicious. After reading the reviews I followed the advice about using half of the chipotle peppers and I'm glad I did. The sauce is so good I'm going to try using it with chicken.

My first recipe on my new pressure cooker.  Used pork loin instead of beef - all ingredients & cook time still the same.  It was awesome!  So much delicious sauce, I put sauce on eggs the next morning. Definitely will do again!  Thank you.

I love this recipe! I normally enjoy it with Jamaican style rice and peas (black beans), fresh onions, cilantro and lime juice :)

This was amazing. My entire family loved this. My brisket was previous smoked on the grill the other day, with the left overs from that brisket smoked, I simmered the Sauce Mixture with it in a crock pot on low for a few hrs. The flavors was GREAT! I served this on a corn tortilla to make a taco and with Mexican rice, whole pinto beans, Avocado Verde dip and Tortilla chips.

simple and delicious, the brisket shredded effortlessly and after soaking in its own juices for another 15 minutes on low heat it absorbed even more flavor.
