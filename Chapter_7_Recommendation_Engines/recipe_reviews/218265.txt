This recipe is excellent!  I have been trying to find an easy, inexpensive recipe that is not just the bottle mix.  This was a great alternative to making a margarita with fresh lemons, limes and oranges.  It tastes the same, if not better, and is great when lemons, limes, and oranges are out of season or too expensive to use in a drink.  It also doesn't have that stomach upsetting sour taste.

My whole family loved it!  I plan on using this recipe again and again!

Not bad, but a little too salty and sweet for my taste. A good tequila, 1800 Silver, and Triple Seq, 2 to 1, a quarter of squeezed of a soft lime, ice and stir makes a great margarita, without the salt and extra sugar. This mix is surprisingly smooth.

I was skeptical about grapefruit flavored soda for a margarita, but I don't like mixes so I gave this a try and I am so glad I did -- it is fabulous!  I've made these three times in the last couple of weeks and all tasters loved them.  I used Fresca for the grapefruit soda -- nice to cut out a few calories in an adult drink, too.  Thanks for sharing!

Finally found a truly tasty margarita!  Even my husband likes them.  No more stomach churning sour tasting margaritas for me!  Really enjoying this one and I did not change a thing.  Thanks so much!

I wanted a lean option to explore cocktail options,  I did 1800 silver, triple sec, and fresh squeezed limes in lieu of sweetened lime juice.  I had orange seltzer, which was nice.  Good little cocktail,

I was really disappointed. Something was definitely missing.
