OMG! this is so good! I combined this with the Instant mushroom risotto recipe on this site. So easy and SO good! Make sure to put the rosemary in (from the mushroom risotto recipe) it really adds to the dish!

This was some of the best risotto I’ve ever had. It had the perfect creamy texture, chicken was tender, and flavor was delicious! My whole family enjoyed it. I didn’t change a thing. This recipe is a keeper.

Family loved this. Will definitely make again. BTW: If you love risotto, the Instant Pot is definitely the way to go.

Best Risotto dish I've ever had.  i used ground turkey that you can brown in the pot on saute.  Also added a can of petite tomatoes and mushrooms.  So good.  This will go on our weekly list of must haves!

This was REALLY good. My only tweaks were adding a small container of mushrooms, adding 1 extra cup of broth, and a sprig of rosemary. Definitely a keeper!

I stuck with the original recipe. I really liked it. I can see adding mushrooms would be good. I’ll be making this again.

I'm going to preface this review with the statement that I have never tried risotto before.  I have nothing to compare it to so keep that little gem in mind when  Reading this review.
 The recipe was easy to follow, the ingredients were easy to find . It tasted really good with the chicken thighs.
 I would not hesitate to make this again. It was creamy and the chicken was melt in your mouth.
