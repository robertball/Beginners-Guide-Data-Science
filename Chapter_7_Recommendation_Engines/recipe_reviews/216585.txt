Excellent, got rave reviews, looked very professional and turned out great.  Only complaint:  too much filling (I only used about two thirds of it, otherwise it would have been spilling out the sides).  Also, I glazed with melted butter and icing sugar instead of using the fondant - just my personal preference.    Thanks for the recipe!

It is delicious, but lots of work, I make shortcuts, use  Athens Phyllow dough, and a can Solo Poppy seed cake filling, add a little rum,  Raisons and some Plumbutter jelly,  foricing, just dust with powdered sugar.

Soooooo worth the effort!     The recipe clearly states that this dessert takes time.   My suggestion is this: read the recipe and  if you don't have time to make this as outlines, no worries-- make something else that works for your timeline.     If you have the time and the inclination, make this as instructed, without shortcuts.    It is so tasty and beautiful, and sure to get you rave reviews.
