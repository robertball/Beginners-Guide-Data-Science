My husband and I love chicken cordon bleu.  This stuff tastes soooo good! I served it over instant rice made with chicken broth and served the asparagus on the side for my picky eaters.  Next time I will try the wild rice though.  The flavor of the cheese sauce with the crunchy topping made it a home run!

This is simple and delicious! I went with the broccoli and used muenster cheese instead of swiss.

This was the first dish I EVER cooked...EVER.  I had to google what a cassarole dish looked like so I could buy one just to try this.  It was so easy to make and coming from me that means a lot because I have no cooking talent lol.  I used steamed brocolli instead of asparagus and I baked some egg noodles into the cassarole instead of putting it over rice and it was incredible.  Really gave me some confidence to try my next dish :)  I bought all 4 flavors of the Philly cooking creme (very affordable at $3 each) and I'm dying to look for new recipes to try the other flavors in.  About to go have the leftovers now! :)

It was just OK on it's own, but mixed with Uncle Bens rice pilaf that we served it over, it was really good.  My kids hated it though.

Was a perfect family dinner with our young adult children. They almost licked the dish clean. Will definately make again. I did add more crackers.

My husband and 7 year old liked this better than I did, I think.  I thought it was sort of bland and just so-so.  I used regular sour cream instead of the cooking creme because I'm not crazy about the cooking creme.  This really needed some "oomf" by way of some dried mustard or something.  May make again, but will fiddle with the flavors quite a bit if I do.  Also, saying it serves 4 is being generous.  It barely served two adults and one picky child.  Be prepared to have a salad and bread on the side to fill everyone up.

This was a delicious alternative to traditional chicken cordon bleu and was so much easier. I had italian cut green beans so I used those instead.

Excellent. Relatively easy and great for leftover chicken. I used the savory garlic cooking creme and broccoli. Also chopped up deli ham, because it's what we had. Came out great. Served it over instant brown rice. The family loved it! Definitely a keeper!

Delic! Huge fan of wild rice! I used the savory garlic flavored cooking creme as I'm a huge garlic fan. Instead of asparagus, used broccoli. No reason just what I had on hand. And passed on the Ritz crackers, didn't have any. Turned out amazing. The swiss cheese really blends well with all the different flavors. 

This time around I am going to use some frozen turkey breast I have leftover from Thanksgiving and instead of ham, use bacon.

Super easy and so tasty!  Very creamy.  Have made a couple of times and subbed broccoli for asparagus.   A bit hit at our house.

Easy to prepare and the flavors came together excellently!  I doubled the recipe and for the second tub of PHILEDELPHIA Cooking Creme I used the Italian Herb flavor.  It was excellent.  My mother in law even dropped in for a surprise visit and she stayed for dinner and was very pleased.  She even asked for the recipe.  An excellent, quick, filling and comforting meal.

This was very good.  I had to improvise since I didn't have all the ingredients.  Subbed one drained can of sweet peas for the asparagus, chopped a ham steak I broiled for 3 minutes on each side, added about 1/2 cup sour cream, and topped with bread crumbs and sprayed with butter.  It was excellent!

This was delicious, but it didn't go over well with the whole family. It had too much cream cheese, and I added more ham and used mozzarella cheese, which worked out well, I feel the recipe doesn't call for enough ham, and I would probably use 3/4 of the cream cheese that it calls for, if not less (depending on preference).

It's a great recipe to play around with, and very easy to make.

This recipe was super easy and tasty.  My husband loved it and has asked me to make it again this week.  I just used regular cream cheese because it is cheaper than the "cooking creme" and it is basically the same thing.  Also, I tried it again with low-fat cream cheese and I actually liked it better because it was a little less thick.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

This is excellent.  I used French Fried Onions instead of Ritz crackers, and served over potatoes.  Very good.

Made this as a quick dinner. Changed some things based on other reviews and what I had on hand. Used 2 cans of chicken mixed with 8 oz. light cream cheese, broccoli, shredded cheese, and some garlic and dry mustard (to taste). Cooked this mixture on the stove. Meanwhile I boiled half a box of whole wheat penne. Once the noodles were cooked I added a bit of dry mustard, garlic salt, and 2 oz. cream cheese. Once blended I mixed everything up, topped with cheese and some ritz cracker crumbs and baked for about 10 mins. in the preheated 375 oven. Tasted great and my 2 year old loved it.

This was amazing. I have made it several times and it has been a success. once I forgot to buy asparagus so I used frozen broccoli instead and I think my kids liked it much better! Excellent both ways though!
