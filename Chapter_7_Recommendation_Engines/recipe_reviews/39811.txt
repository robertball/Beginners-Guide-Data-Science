I probably should't rate this because i had to make some changes. Isaw this and wanted it for my salad tonight, but i didn't have balsamic vineger so iused balsamic dressing and adjusted everything else. I also left out pinenuts and am going to toast them and top the salad with them. Next time i will make per recipe Thanks i love fresh basil Pine nuts and sundried tomatoes.Ok i just ate this on my salad tonight and it was great the only thing i added to the greens was cucumber.and the pinenuts on top. VERY TASTY IF YOU LIKE SUNDRIED TOMATOES, MINE WERE IN OIL AND I ALSO ADDED A SMALL AMOUNT OF OIL TO DRESSING

Great Dressing - I roasted the Pine Nuts which gave the dressing a good flavor. I also added a dash of pepper. So many compliments - thanks !

We thought this was okay as a salad dressing, but even better as a chicken marinade, which we then chopped up and put on romaine... so I guess it ended up being on salad anyway!  I used sun dried tomatoes in oil.  I drained the oil from the tomatoes, but still slightly decreased the olive oil in the recipe to make up for it.  I also wanted my tomatoes finely chopped, so I pulsed them in my food processor a bit before stirring with the other ingredients.
