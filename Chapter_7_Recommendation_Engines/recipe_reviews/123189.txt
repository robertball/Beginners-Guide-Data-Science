Good, and easy.  I cut and cooked the green beans the day before, then when I was 15-20 mins out from eating, made the dish on the stovetop.  This cut down my time in the kitchen when my company was here.  Will make again

We made this for our gourmet group- turned out great as a make-ahead recipe. Make ahead instructions:
Blanch beans 3-4 minutes- follow with ice water bath and drain.Refrigerate beans. Saute almonds and butter. Set aside. Put beans in casserole or roasting pan. when ready to serve, heat beans in 375 degree oven for 7-10 minutes- then toss with lemon juice,seasoning salt, and sauteed almonds.

Simple and good.  Even better if you allow the butter to brown--gives this a nice, nutty flavor.  I wanted a little less crunch, so I used sliced almonds rather than slivered.

I've made this recipe many times and love it.  Sometimes I add dried cranberries to it too, for a different flavor.  I used frozen french cut green beans.  I also prefer to just use kosher salt instead of the seasoned salt.

This was pretty good but lacked a little flavor for me.  My guests really liked it.  Next time I think I will add a little garlic as some others have suggested.

This recipe has become a staple in our house.  Everybody loves it.  Sophisticated enough to go with "good meat" when company comes over, and easy enough to make on "leftover night".  We love this recipe!

Wonderful!  I am a bit of a baby when it comes to eating my vegetables, so I'm always looking for ways to shake things up so they're more palatable for me.  And I actually found myself sneaking more from the pan after dinner was over!  Who knew?  I used lime juice instead of lemon because this is what I had on hand, and I didn't measure the ingredients, just sort of eye-balled it, and it still turned out fantastic.  I think this is a hard recipe to mess up.

Extremely easy and very tasty.  Even my picky kids admitted that it tasted pretty good - and they normally hate green beans!  We will definitely make this again.

Made exactly as written (using frozen, french-cut green beans since my kids like the "shredded" texture) and this is a classic, delicious recipe! Thanks so much!

Easy to prepare, tasty and good as a side dish. I let the butter cook down and brown up with the nuts. I used a mixture of nuts and rough chopped for more crunch and nutty flavor. The lemon juice adds a nice flavor to the beans which I like a lot.

I love this recipe and make it often.  Sometimes I use flavored sliced almonds that are now sold all over as salad toppings and they are great in it.

Did not add the seasoned salt or lemon juice but these turned out so yummy! If you brown the butter & almonds it gives off this wonderful nutty flavour. Super easy recipe - will definitely make again!

YUMMY! And I DO NOT like green beans! Used skinny frozen beans (Trader Joe's) and didn't have any almonds on hand and it was GREAT. Browned the butter a bit before I added the other ingredients. THX for helping me eat my greens!

VERY VERY GOOD!  This recipe served as a great way to spruce up a can of french cut green beans.  Although the recipe calls for fresh beans, it is also excellent for canned beans.  Hubby raved about the taste all throughout dinner.  Thank you Brenda DuFresne for sharing your recipe!

This was very good and makes a classy side dish. I served it with Chicken Breasts with Garlic and Balsamic Vinegar from this site and also a roasted new potatoes recipe from this site. The only thing I will change next time is that I'll cut back on the butter.

Excellent and easy - loved it!

I doubled the recipe for a big crowd and bought the pre-cut, pre-washed bag of green beans.  Sooooooo easy.   Takes up no space and no time, yet looks elegant and tastes great.

Made these for a dinner party last night.  They were lovely to look at but lacked flavour.  I toasted the flaked almonds and in future, I would add roasted, whole baby shallots and a drizzle of good balsamic.

Made today for Easter and enjoyed it very much.  The seasoned salt and lemon helped to boost the flavor. Will make again.

Really enjoyed this.  I went a little overboard on the seasoned salt, I would definitely follow the recipe next time.  It would be good with or without the lemon juice.

these were fine, but I feel like the actual taste of the bean was lost instead of enhanced :( but thats just my opinion!

Wow, hard to beleive I've been eatting plain steamed green beans all these years! Just a few ingredients transfrom "plain old" beans into a very tasty side dish! I browned the butter and almonds together, used frozen beans (can't wait to use fresh from the garden!) sea salt and fresh ground pepper. The lemon juice didn't seem to add much, so I would make these even if I was out of lemon. So easy, so yummy!

Excellent!  I added a little avocado oil, some sliced scallion and diced red pepper when I sauteed the almonds.  Best green beans we've ever had.

I ate this years ago somewhere and wanted to try this recipe when I seen it. I made 1/2 the recipe. To speed up the preparation, and wash less dishes, I just made it in the microwave. I microwaved the bagged defrosted green beans in about 1/4" of water for 2-3 minutes. I only had sliced almonds and used them. I also didn't bother cutting the green beans. I microwaved some butter with canola oil with the almonds for 30 seconds and then added the rest of the ingredients and poured it over the drained green beans. Delicious and a quick and easy way to dress up green beans. Thank you!

these were really good but I do have to agree with the other comments on lacking flavor.  next time I make them I'll have to add extra season salt and lemon juice and add some pepper too.

This was really good.  I used fresh beans and lemon and I think it really made the difference.  I have been looking for a chicken amandine recipe and I think this tasted just as I remember but with green beans.  I'll try this on the chicken.  Thanks for the submission!  Really fresh and very good.

If I could give this recipe 7 stars, I would!  I've made it several times now and it always turns out excellent.  I cook the beans in the microwave to save time but other than that follow the recipe exactly!  This is a great recipe because it's so easy but it looks really fancy!  Thank you, thank you!

Very delicious, making again tonight for a second time! Be careful with the lemon juice; I added a bit more because I wanted more of a bite but when they sat for a few minutes it was too much!

Delicious and easy to male. I chose to steam the beans instead of boiling them. Also didn't have any seasoned salt so I substituted regular salt, black pepper and garlic powder.

Delicious and easy!  Used some fresh green beans from the farmer's market.

It was ok. I don't really like green beans but I figured I'd give this recipe a shot. It wasn't horrible but there was a lack of flavor. Still, the recipe was easy to follow and I guess if you like green beans you'll like this simple dish. 

I had an almond theme going for the meal so I combined with the almond crusted tilapia and followed with the bananas fosters II off of allrecipes.com. I also had some out of the carton scalloped potatoes with the main dish.

This is my go-to recipe for green beans! Gets rave reviews every time I make it. If I'm making them as a side for a weeknight dinner, I omit the almonds. To "dress it up" for special occasion meals, I add them in. Either way, delicious!!

Easy to make, but very plain tasting. Made 2 versions...one plain and other with garlic sea salt. Garlic sea salt version was a hit!

I loved this recipe! I didn't use fresh green beans, but used one can of French-style green beans (no salt added; scaled down to 2 servings).  Other than that change (only one more minor thing -- I chopped whole almonds instead of using slivered), I followed the recipe and it was really good! The beans were amazingly flavorful; I'm not often the biggest green bean fan but I ate these right up! My boyfriend, who loves green beans, really liked this little twist on them as well. I would recommend this recipe for those who are tired of just plain ol' steamed green beans!

i have a huge bag of sunflower seeds in my freezer from the amish store. this recipe was a perfect way to incorporate them into a side dish for dinner. i think any nut you have on hand would probably work for this. i added some fresh cracked pepper and dill. this was a great side for Slow Cooker Cranberry Roast over whipped potatoes.

used the kosher salt instead of the seasoning salt (personal taste) and used some fresh minced garlic too. Made this for my son's bday at the beginning of Dec and have been asked to make it twice since then. Thanks for a great recipe!

Let me add one more thing after making this several times....only use fresh green beans...turns out way better!

Delish! Steamed the green beans. Used sliced almonds (all that was available where we live) and browned the butter for extra nuttiness. We all loved these, even the kids!

Wow! Love this recipe.  I used lime instead of lemon because that's what I had. I also sauted some mushrooms and added them at the last minute.  Fantastic!  Thanks for sharing.

Served these at a semi-formal dinner. Everyone loved them. I steamed the green beans instead of boiling them. I also used olive oil instead of butter to make them non-dairy. Next time I will use butter.

These beans were astonishingly easy to make and delicious to eat.  I didn't realize we were out of almonds until the beans were already in the pot coming to a boil, but this recipe was great even without the nuts.  I also substituted a generous sprinkling of Mrs. Dash for the seasoned salt.  Other than that, I kept everything the same and these beans were GOOD.  My four year old gobbled them up and a friend already asked for the recipe!

Nice way to dress up green beans without being too fancy!  I added pepper and I think it was still missing something.  Maybe some garlic or a sprinkle of parmesan.  I will use this one again though!

This recipe was a huge success in my family. Its a great mix of tart, crispy, tender flavors. We are huge almond lovers and this was a great dish. Just be careful not to overseason the beans, or else its too salty to eat.

I made this recipe for a birthday party.  I doubled the recipe, and they were all eaten at the end of the night.  I was looking for something a little more exciting than green beans, and this was it.  Some of the recipes I looked at had lots of butter or sugar which sound great but didn't quite fit my menu for the night.  Thanks for sharing this tasty and simple recipe!

Not only great, but so simple to do. It's an elegant side dish that seems "fancy", but is very basic, and preserves the goodness of the fresh green beans themselves without drowning them in fat or overcooking them. This will become part of my regular repertoire. 

*A bit of fresh herb like dill or tarragon wouldn't hurt, but I'd keep it restrained.

These were terrific!  I hate green beans but I ate these (as did the kids!)  They were easy to make as well, even while I was trying to cook a bunch of other things
