I LOVE this stuff!  And the truth be told, I didn't expect to. I had an avocado and cottage cheese that looked as though they'd get tossed if I didn't use them soon, so I approached this as an experiment, thinking I had nothing to lose if I found I didn't care for it.  Since I made only a small amount it wasn't practical for me to open a can of green chiles, so I substituted fresh minced jalapeno pepper instead. The garlic salt, salt and pepper, and lemon juice I added to taste, always a good idea.  I was absolutely floored at how delicious this was! One could be tempted to add ingredients like cilantro, parsley, fresh garlic or cumin and while they would all probably be nice additions they are by no means necessary - and frankly, any changes might just spoil this lovely recipe. It's creamy, smooth, not too spicy, with a hint of avocado flavor and just the slightest tang from the cream cheese and cottage cheese.  Since I knew it was also good for me, I ate it by the spoonful!

Totally loved this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly. After tasting the finished product I decided it needed more salsa (I got hot salsa like the first reviewer suggested), so I added an additional 1/4 cup.  I even think it could use more but I realize that it will taste even better after the flavors have melded overnight so I'm not going to tinker with it anymore.  BTW, when they say "plentiful" in the name of this recipe, they mean it.  It makes a huge bowl.  I love it and can't wait to taste it again tomorrow.

I wasn't sure I'd like this recipe but since I like all the ingredients I figured it'd be all right. I'm glad I made it! I really like this dip! I did make some changes-I halved the recipe and didn't use as much garlic salt.  Yum!

I am a huge fan of cottage cheese and salsa... yet have never combined the two. I loved this recipe! If you like spice you must use very spicy salsa (Trader Joe's chipotle salsa is my fave for spicy) because the avocado and cottage cheese cut the spice quite a bit.  Yum!

Makes a TON of guac! I used only one container of cottage cheese, and that seemed like just enough. It was very tasty and delicious

Delicious!!  I was a little leary  about using cottage cheese, now I feel silly for not thinking of it myself!  I used more cream cheese just to get rid of it :) and minced garlic instead of garlic salt because thatâ€™s what I had..  otherwise followed recipe and loved it !!   Thank you!

I made this recipe but I didn't have any cottage cheese on hand but it still came out great! I tripled the salsa and added fresh lime instead of lemon and it was still a huge hit at our gathering... I must say that the appearance was a little disturbing... :/
