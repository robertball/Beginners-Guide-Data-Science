I was surprised by the overpowering smell of the vinegar in the sauce. I put the sauce on and refrigerated it for about 20 minutes in hopes it would lose some of the strong smell. It did and this dish was absolutely delicious! I added a fresh mixture of romano, parmesan and asiago and will definitely make this again!
P.S. Warmed up some leftovers for dinner tonight and served hot with fresh cheeses and it was definitely 5 stars!

This is my new favorite pasta salad. I even left out the chicken because I was serving to a crowd with some vegetarians. My only suggestion is to use a 12oz box of pasta rather than 16oz. There was too much pasta and I ended up adding more of the other ingredients.  The pine nuts are a must. Don't leave them out. Don't leave any of the ingredients out! This dish is excellent the way it is. Thanks for sharing!

I found the need to add more dressing and pesto after it had had time to marinate.  I would add more asparagus and artichokes next time.  Very tasty!

Wonderful pasta salad!  I made a batch and a half of dressing.  I mixed the full recipe of dressing into the salad and let it chill for several hours.  From other reviews I knew it would be dry so I saved the extra dressing to stir into the salad right before serving.  It's even better on days two and three.

This is a fabulous salad!  I made this for a girls weekend.  I kept the pasta seperate from the other salad ingredients.  I mixed the dressing in a mason jar and put it all together when I got to the cabin.  It was gone in the first sitting.  I swear it's the dressing...it's nice to have this over a regular lettuce salad also.

Really yummy flavors.  I did roast the asparagus instead of boiling.  Keeping the dressing seperate allows you to toss together just enough and save the rest for later.  Very good.

Fantastic!  Don't change a thing!! (although the chicken is not important in this one--I too left it out)  I do have to admit to adding a little extra pesto  too, because it brought such a wonderful flavor to the salad,  Also remember to clip some fresh basil and sprinkle just a little on top for garnish--it's prettier, fresher looking, and tastes great!  This is one of my new favorites.

Ridiculously good.  I mixed everything together and let it all marinate in the fridge overnight before serving.  Everyone raved.

I never give a bad review but I just did not care for this.  I should have gone with my instinct which told me the buttermilk dressing would not be good.  I ended up probably about doubling the pesto and only using about half the buttermilk dressing.  I think this would have been better with no buttermilk dressing and just pesto.  It was edible but that's b/c of my alterations.

I added a wider variety of vegetables and left everything else the same.  I thought it was very good, but hubby doesn't like cold pasta salads.  He warmed his and ate it that way, but it's certainly not something he's going to request again.

oh, WOW!  This was just so good.  I used the garlic basil pesto recipe from this site, added diced fresh mozzarella, and some extra pesto.  I will definitely be making this again.

I only made a few modifications. When I cooked the chicken I put V8 juice and Italian seasoning into it. I also used whole wheat pasta because I am diabetic. I grilled the asparagus in the same pan I cooked the meat and added butter, because that is how I like asparagus. Other than that it was on par with the recipe and it was fantastic. I did not feel that it needed more dressing at all. The creamy is not like an Alfredo sauce , but rather a slight hint of creamy. It really is perfect the way it is! I wouldn't add more dressing.

Sauce was too much for the kids' pallets and my hubby also wasn't fond of it but with a touch more pesto and skipping the other sauce they enjoyed it. Made plenty of food!

Very good salad, I followed some of the suggestions and added a mixture of asiago,parmesan and romano grated cheese and I would also use less pine nuts as they have a very strong flavor. I also used double the amount of pesto. Everyone loved it  and will make it again.

I made this for a teacher appreciation lunch and everyone loved it.  Super easy too.  I doubled the recipe and saved some for us -- it was even really good without the buttermilk dressing.

So GOOD!! I followed the ingredients list exactly, left nothing out. I stir fried the asparagus pieces in EVOO though instead of boiling. I got everything ready the day before I served it, which made the dressing lose the vinegar smell, it was great! Tossed the pasta with the pesto the day before but kept all other ingredients in separate baggies to combine before serving. THIS DISH IS DELISH. So good that I can't wait to take it somewhere and hear all the oohs and ahhs! It's a great lunch main dish, and for a dinner I think I will leave the chicken out but serve it as a side dish to chicken for a more formal presentation. Thanks for this recipe!

This is my new favorite pasta salad. As others sugguested I left out the chicken and used a 12oz box of pasta rather than 16oz.  I used about 2/3 cup of store bought pesto and then added some chopped fresh basil leaves. I also bought buttermilk ranch dressing instead of making the buttermilk dressing in this recipe. I put it on the side, just in case people didn't want it on the salad. (Because it is really good with just the pesto) Everyone added it anyway and LOVED IT! This is a keeper!

I too took this to a baby shower, and the guests really enjoyed it and asked me where I got the recipe.  I didn't really change anything, I just used extra pesto (maybe almost double the amount called for...I love pesto) and I used marinated artichoke hearts.  I think my only complaint would be that the dressing was a bit boring and the vinegar was too strong.  I'd definitely make this again, just perhaps with a different dressing.

This is a GREAT salad!  I used a lot of substitutions so I didn't have to go to the store.  Whole wheat penne pasta.  No artichokes or asparagus; instead I used peas and chopped fresh spinach.  Also chopped regular tomatoes instead of cherry size.  For the dressing, I used plain greek yogurt (replaced sour cream), fat free miracle whip, and skim milk with some "butter buds" seasoning (replaced buttermilk).  I had frozen pesto and chopped green onions from my garden.  I mixed the pesto with the rest of the dressing to-taste.  This was EXCELLENT!  My husband loved it, too... what a great summer dinner and, with all of the healthier substitutions, we didn't feel guilty going back for seconds!

All I can say is that this salad was AWESOME.    I made my own pesto and subbed sunflower seeds for pine nuts.  The prep time kind of killed me ( I think some of which may have been largely due tot he fact I was working in a cramped Brooklyn kitchen!!!), but it was definitely worth it.  This recipe does make a LOT... I had leftovers for days and days (which seemed to get better after they "festered")  My boyfriend, who is not apt to complement anything, said that this was incredible.

So so good. I added more veggies than called for, as well as adding olives and substituting roasted almonds for the pine nuts, and cutting back on the dressing (in an attempt to make it healthier). All good changes. I will definitely make this again.

Very good, used grilled chicken and added chunks of Mozzarella.  I did not add the asparagus or artichokes and used my own pesto.

I was expecting this to be more impressive. Could have used more flavor - probably more pesto and less dressing.

This is the dish my step daughters ask for every time we have a family event. I omit the chicken and add more asparagus, artichoke hearts, and pesto. I never fail to get compliments on this dish, even from my pesto-hating husband!

Tip: save a few cherry tomato halves to garnish the top of the salad before serving; I try to use multiple colors of cherry tomatoes to increase visual appeal.

Made this without chicken.  When I tasted it, I could not figure out why it was boring.  Well, I forgot to add the pesto.  Fixed MY ERROR and NOW, it is wonderful!  The whole family loves it.

This will be in my recipe box for a long time.  I changed and added a few things too.  I wasn't interested in the creamy part of the dressing, so I left it out and only added extra pesto.  I also added black olives, small can sweet corn, and gorgonzola cheese.  I took this to the office and there is nothing left, really good recipe, and great for the Texas summer heat.  Thank you.

This was awesome!  We also had it without chicken since there was a vegetarian in the crowd.  While the pine nuts were good, I don't personally think they were worth the $10 they cost.  This is a great, refreshing, different pasta salad!

Very good ingredients for the salad!! I made this the other day for a baby shower, and it turned out great but I wasn't too please with the dressing. I made the dressing the night before to let it sit and I even doubled it to make sure I had enough per other reviews. I dressed it an hour before the party and I couldn't really taste it at all... it was pretty dry. It didn't seem to matter to anyone else because all the ingredients are soo good alone! Next time I may try a creamier dressing though. Also, I didn't buy pine nuts- cause they are so expensive and I already had tons of walnuts and it turned out great!!
Thanks for the recipe!! I'll def. make again just with a change to the dressing :)

This salad was a refreshing main dish for warm days. I added freshly ground mixed pepper and freshly grated parmesan cheese (in addition to more salt). I also sprinkled the toasted pine nuts over the top right before serving, so they wouldn't get soft. This recipe makes a lot, so it is perfect for sharing. Definitely a keeper.

This was pretty good. I think it needed more garlic. I agree with the previous comment about not omitting the pine nuts - they really add something. Our grocery store was out of artichoke hearts so I left them out - something was missing and maybe that was it? Will give another try.

I used Barilla Campanelle pasta in place of the bow tie because I think it holds dressing/sauce better.  I dressed the salad just before I served it and it was wonderful.  I did notice that the leftovers the next day were a little dry.  More asparagus would be good.

Made this for a party and everyone raved.   Should be made the day ahead to let the flavors meld, and I did 1 1/2 x dressing, it would have been dry otherwise.

I prepared this recipe just as Ms. Anderson submitted it.  I prepped all the ingredients in the morning, and combined them and dressed the salad just prior to serving.  When I samples the dressing after making it in the morning I thought the rice wine vinegar might be a bit overpowering, but I found when I brought it all together, eight hours later, that the result was a beautiful and delicious pasta salad that will go immediately into my regular summertime line up.

I made the "Easy Pesto" from AR contributor Rebecca Jane Thompson, but substituted pine nuts for the almonds, so I cannot rate her recipe, but, as revised, it was as good as any pesto I have ever made, and it was quick and easy.

Kudos to both these wonderful cooks.

Great pretty much as is.  I omitted chicken because I was serving with grilled chicken already.  I did make a little extra dressing and used a little more pesto.  I feel like maybe it needed a little salt.  But everyone loved it, will definitely make again!  Oh, and I would say I had the asparagus in the pasta water for 2 minutes instead of 1 which was perfect.

This recipe is absolutely delicious for a summer salad on a hot day. I made the dressing from scratch and I put in some fresh basil from my garden and homemade pesto and it turned out perfect. I have added it to my list of signature dishes.

Made it w/o the pesto and pine nuts.  (yuck, that stuff is not for me)  It was incredible.  Unlike other reviewers, I believe the chicken is a must  I fried the chicken breasts in a chipotle mango seasoning then cubed, cooled and added to the salad.

This was super yummy!  I didn't have rice wine vinegar, so I used about a tablespoon of olive oil in the dressing instead. Delish!  Hubby love it too. Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this both using all homemade and store-bought pesto & buttermilk ranch and they both taste really good!  I brought this camping and stored in a ziploc bag until we were ready to eat and then just added the ranch.  So refreshing on a nice warm day!

This is a great receipe, my whole family loved it.  I made some changes:  Added sliced olives, shredded monterey jack cheese, used a creamy garlic italian dressing instead of buttermilk, and used grape tomatoes instead of cherry. I think it would be good just as is, or add your own twist to it!

Don't use this sauce.  It's great with plain cheese, perhaps the pesto without the creamy stuff.

Excellent combination of flavors... I used mini bowties, about 12 oz.  Doubled the tomatoes and asparagus. Used home made pesto and about half the called for creamy dressing.  Was gobbled up at a bridal shower!

Wonderful! I doubled the buttermilk dressing recipe, and left it on the side for those who just wanted pesto, also used more pesto than recipe calls for. This recipe is great with out the chicken, and also adding other vegetables. Great for summer!

I have prepared this salad now multiple times because it is delicious, quick to prepare and at the same time is quite a fancy party salad. 

Since I do not usually have rice vinegar around I tried balsamico and plain white vinegar. Balsamico is a bit overpowering the other rather delicate taste and I do not recommend it. Hence, white vinegar is the replacement of choice to me. 

Apart from this I always find that I need to add additional salt once everything is tossed together. 

I have also omitted sometimes the buttermilk without too much effect.

Thanks for that recipe!

I'm sorry to have to rate this a 3.  Perhaps I did something wrong....I don't think so. This recipe does make a lot so that is a plus.  I did not care for the dressing.  If I make it again I will only add the pesto sauce.  I had to double the pesto sauce.  Also, I would add more asparagus.  But even with those changes I don't think I would make it again. Just so so, in my opinion.

I just made this tonight for a dinner party and everybody loved it- had no problems giving away leftovers. I used a little less pasta and salt and threw in some red onion.    
The buttermilk in the dressing adds some bite and differentiates this dish from standard issue pasta salads.  I'll definitely make this one again. Thanks.

I made this pasta salad for my daughter's 1st birthday and it was a hit! I adjusted the servings to serve 24.

I refrigerated the dressing and it calmed down the heavy vinigar smell and it helped.  I didn't have rice wine vinigar so I substituted red wine vinigar.  I also didn't add the chicken as it was for a side dish.  I also used corkscrew pasta. I do think next time I will add a little bit more pesto because we like pesto.

Everyone at the party was asking for the recipe and it was even good the next day.
