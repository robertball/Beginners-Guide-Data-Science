This is a nice way to dress up a boring can of string beans. They were more sweet than spicy to me so I might try adding a dash of cayenne next time. Otherwise very nice. Thanks.

A bit too sweet for my taste so I am going to cut back on the brown sugar.  Not enough spice for us so I will double the chili powder or add some cayenne pepper.

Didn't have bacon on hand so I pan fried some cut up ham which worked just fine. Also I agree that it didn't necessarily have a spicy kick to it but the sweetness combined with the ham was still pretty delicious.

Made for my family and they all liked it but said it was a bit too sweet. Will m ale them again and cut back on the brown sugar.
