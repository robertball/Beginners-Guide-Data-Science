They were easy to make but I ended up tossing them - I didn't get the "melt in your mouth feeling", they were unbelieavably dry.

A very pretty cookie and tasty too. Delicate and buttery, like a shortbread. DO NOT overbake these. Cook only till just barely browned on the edges or they will be dry as dust!

these are wonderful!  They can be a little crumbly, but held together fine and were very light and tasty.  I made them for a Christmas Tea.

Looking for cookies to put on my Christmas Cookie List to sell and thought this would be a festive cookie.  Looks pretty but everyone that tasted it said the same thing "good but nothing special". This didn't make the cut.

This is one of my favorite Christmas cookies.  It is delcious, very cute and gives a nice color contribution to a cookie plate.  It melts in your mouth and is yummy.  You have to be certain to measure perfectly and bake just until there is a touch of light brown on the edges.  Enjoy.

These are not, perhaps, the easiest cookies to make, but they were an absolute hit with my coworkers and friends.  They have become one of my holiday favorites, and are a minty and fresh alternative to chocolate desserts.
