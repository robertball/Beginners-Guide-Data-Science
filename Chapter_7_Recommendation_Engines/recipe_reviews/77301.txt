I like to give this drink a little more "kick" and use cold coffee instead of water. To make it flavored, I'll add a jigger of flavored coffee syrup or a dash of vanilla extract. Cheap way to get your iced coffee/frap (for those trying to cut down on their spending), plus you can make it at home and not have to get out of your jammies to do it! NOTE: For those who don't like to waste coffee from the day before, freeze your coffee in an ice cube tray and use that instead of plain ice cubes!

I absolutely love this recipe!  I've been making these for about two years and they are so much better than a Starbuck's frappucino.  I sometimes put chocolate syrup or coconut extract in it.  I use decaf instant and my kids love to share in the "coffee smoothies" with me.

My kids LOVED this, but I thought it was only four stars. I used quadruple strength coffee (4c decaf filter brewed with 1c water). A very quick and easy treat.
