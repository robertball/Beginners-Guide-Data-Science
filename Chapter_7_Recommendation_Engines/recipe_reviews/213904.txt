We made this glaze for Easter dinner and it was a hit. My mom loved it. We used a precooked ham and didn't use the bourbon and cooked for like an hours and a half. Was so good.

I used this on a cured ham and liked it very much, with the exception of the cloves. Way too much. When I make it again, and I will, I will either omit them altogether or greatly reduce them. I did use Jim Beam bourbon and I added in 1/4 cup of honey. I also did not have spicy brown mustard, so I did 1/3 cup horseradish sauce and 1/3 cup yellow mustard. I also added in 1/4 tsp cumin and 1 tsp Frank's red hot sauce.

AMAZING!!!!  Made this today for an early family Easter Dinner.  Followed the directions with the exception of the bourbon, only because we are out.  I used a spiral cut ham.  Used about 1/2 the sauce and baked according to the hams direction.  For the final 30 minutes of cooking I really coated the ham with the rest of the glaze and baked the remainder of the time uncovered.  Like the suggestions, I really got the sauce into the slices with a BBQ brush.  IT IS AMAZING!

I made this for today's Christmas ham.  It was so easy and so good. Like some others, I used a pre-cooked spiral cut ham and made sure to get the glaze in the spiral cuts.  I used half the glaze to start, then added the rest to re-glaze the ham for the last half-hour of cook time.  The ham came out so tender and juicy.  No dry cuts at all. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

We made this for Easter ham and it was great! I halved the recipe because my ham was fairly small, and used whiskey instead of bourbon because that's all I had. We only put in half the amount of cloves. It made the ham a beautiful color, coated it well, and wasn't too sweet. Complex favors. I liked it a lot.

Very easy and very good, it made the best Christmas dinner I have had in years. I used a small precut spiral ham (around 4 lbs) at 275.  I still cross cut the ham and put a first layer of glaze on it, cooked for an 1hr 30m, removing it every half half hour basting it with its dripping and using a brush would but an additional coat of glaze. Came out amazing. With how hard this year has been, it made my family's Christmas great, thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I'd give this more than five stars if I could.  Amazing recipe!  I've made it several times now, and have started doubling the recipe because everyone wants more for their leftovers.  We routinely heat up the extra and drizzle onto ham biscuits.

I even made it once when I didn't have molasses.  I made a cup of substitute molasses by mixing honey with a pear flavored balsamic vinegar.  That was really good as well.

This is the new go-to ham glaze in our house. Lovely, complex and so simple to make. The molasses gives that earthy back of the tongue pleasure while all the other spices add to the symphony in your mouth. Ham never had it so good!

Trying to avoid a store run is how I stumbled on this tasty recipe. I didnt have honey and decided to find a recipe that used molasses and I'm glad i found it. Didnt have bourbon or spicy mustard on hand and I decided to add pineapples I also decided to use regular mustard and it still tasted fabulous.Besides those changes recipe was followed to a tee

This is so good!! I made it exactly as stated except I didn't have brown sugar used Morena un refined pure sugar and halved the recipe as I only had half a cup of the molasses. heated it on the stove to dissolve the sugar. I've made many a ham glaze in my 63 year's this is now my go to recipe. just upped the temperature to finish can't wait till it's done.

My family enjoyed this but it was much to heavy on the cloves for my personal taste. I’d reduce that next time for sure.

Absolutely fantastic! I had never thought of using ginger on ham. I'm glad you thought of it for me. Didn't have any bourbon so I substituted with a semi sweet white wine. I am going to use this recipe for as many other dishes as I humanly can. Thank you for sharing this!

This glaze was the best ever and a big hit with my family and friends.  My husband & son do not like mustard so I exchanged the spicy mustard for some dry ground mustard and they couldn't tell it was in the glaze.   I used the glaze on a 11 lb. precooked butt ham and the family raved about the glaze and said I had to stick with this one. The bourbon added to the flavor of the glaze and I would recommend not leaving it out.  Thank you so much for this glaze.  I will use it again and again.
