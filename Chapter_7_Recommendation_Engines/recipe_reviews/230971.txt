This was, by far, the easiest ice cream I've ever made. It froze beautifully, without becoming icy, and was easy to scoop after hardening. Next time, I will half the almond extract and double the instant coffee. Also, I added crushed-up Heath bar in the last few minutes of churning. I think you could use the cream, half & half, condensed milk base for a number of flavorings. I'll definitely be trying this one again!

Wonderful recipe, added a little Hersheys chocolate syrup, almonds and Heath toffee bar crumbles after running it through the ice cream maker, and it turned out fantastic!

Wow! Delicious! I like the almond extract, although with or without it would be great.

I admit Iâ€™m not a big fan of almond extract, but it gave this coffee ice cream a wonderful flavor. If you have a smaller ice cream maker as I do, I suggest you prepare 3/4 of the  recipe.  This recipe is very easy and makes a delicious ice cream.
