Hubby is the bean salad expert and he thought the dressing wasn't quite what he expected.   I usually use a 3 : 1 ratio of oil to vinegar.

It was good, but the sauce wasn't as vinegary as I like. Great combination of vegetables though!

I think this salad is excellent. It's simple to prepare. I prefer making my own salads at home instead of purchasing the pre-made ones at the grocery deli counter.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. I usually try to follow the directions exactly. I didn't have any jars of pimento peppers at home so I omitted that ingredient.

We also add a can of drained and rinsed garbanzo beans and lots more chopped red, green, and yellow peppers  and onions.  A favorite at church pot lucks and summer barbeques!!

The only change I made was to add different peppers to make it more colorful. I didn’t add the pimento either because I couldn’t find any.

Fantastic recipe! Just what I was looking for! I used chickpeas instead of kidney beans because I was out of them and it tasted great. The chickpeas really absorbed the flavour of the dressing.

Our traditional recipe calls for 1 cup of sugar and 3/4 cup water along with the other ingredients.

So easy and yummy!  Reminds me of my grandma's bean salad (her's was a little sweeter).  Thank you, ccormia (and your mother-in-law).
