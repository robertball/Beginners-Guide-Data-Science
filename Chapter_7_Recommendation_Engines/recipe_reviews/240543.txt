Hands down m, AMAZING!!  This was my very first attempt at prime rib.  I love Prime rib and decided to try it for Easter.  Like many of the other reviewers, I was nervous to be experimenting on such an expensive piece of meat.  The more reviews I read, the more nervous I got.  I read other instructions on cooking prime rib on other sites .  Bottom line, don't second guess anything.  Follow the instructions to the letter.  The only thing I did differently was I marinated mine for three days.  I followed the 5 min per pound rule of thumb.  I do have a gas oven.  (Some suggested issues with this).  My family ALL said this was the VERY BEST prime rib they had EVER had anywhere!  I agree!  I made a yummy horseradish sauce to go with although it really needed nothing else.  It was so incredibly tender you could cut it with a butter knife !  LOVE IT!!!

Turned out amazing! Had great flavor. Only thing I didn't use was rosemary. Took it out of the oven when the middle reached 125-130 degrees and let sit for 15.

Awesome!  There were only 4 of us and I cooked a 2 1/2 pound roast.  I cooked the roast for 15 minutes at 500 degrees and then reduced the oven to 325 degrees and cooked the roast  for 30 minutes.  The roast rested for 20 minutes and it was a delicious medium rare roast.

Perfection. An absolutely must try rib roast. The rub makes the marinade delicious. My roast was 4.8 ounces and the timing worked out on the button. Thank you!

The prime rib was over cooked, which was a terrible thing to do with such an expensive cut of meat. But I did use the leftovers in beef and noodles they were awesome! I gave it a 4 star rating because the flavor was really good, but not the jaw dropping flavor that I was expecting. The overcooking was on me.  I would try the marinade recipe again, though.

I changed it up a bit. I did not use a cooking bag. I rubbed the roast with sea salt and ground black pepper, put it on a roasting pan.  I preheated the oven to 500° and cooked the roast for 15 minutes. After lowering the oven temperature to 350°, cooked for 1 hour and 20 minutes. The Prime Rib Roast has a nice crispy crust and the insides were medium rare. It was delicious and cooked to perfection!

This was a bit new to me, so I followed the directions.  It wound up in the marinade a bit longer than 2 hours, yet all was fine.  Our guests also enjoyed it.  I'll do it again.
