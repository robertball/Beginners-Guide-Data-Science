We used this recipe as is, no tweaks, today for a hassle-free Christmas dinner.   This was amazingly easy and quick and the results quite impressive.

Sorry, Chef. I swear by your recipes and advice, but your application of Kosher salt as recommended on your video is completely over the top and totally ruined the dish, killing the flavor of the duck and the sauce. After the 15 minutes of dry brining, I recommend wiping the salt off altogether and refraining from salting again before cooking. That’s the proper method for dry brining. I should have known better from past experience grilling, but I trusted your instructions, lowering my rating from five stars to two. Otherwise, the dish would have been great, and we wouldn’t have wasted $40 on ruined duck breasts. Make this adjustment as to salt, and you’ll be pleased with the results.

There are comments on the duck breast being tough. I jaccard my breast before I cook them. Jacardding is an hand held unit that has many small knives that pierce the flesh to tenderize. Same thing can be used on steaks. You can buy these off of ebay. Great piece of equipment to have.

Excellent and easy! I have tried to roast whole duck twice before only to end up with a smoky, greasy mess. I bought 2 boneless duck breasts (Mary's brand, natural, free range duck from Petaluma, California) and followed this recipe - perfection! Moist, tender and savory. The sauce was light and not too sweet. Roasted some winter squash and purple potatoes and a steamed half an artichoke on the side for a special dinner.  Even though I was worried about the cook times being under done, I let them rest in a warm oven while I made the sauce and it was perfect. Only wish I had taken a picture!

We have never had Duck before and being a fan of Chef John recipes decided to give this a go. We could only find frozen duck breasts. As you can tell from the rating, we were incredibally satisfied. Followed the directions exactly, and confess that I probably should have cooked the duck a minute longer. The sauce was to die for. Absolutely loved the orange flavor and admit to basically drowning the duck in the sauce as I loved it so much. The meat was moist and tender despite being previously frozen. Will make again.

This was easy to make and delicious. I used a little more or the sauce because in our home we're suckers for orange. I served it with steamed green beans and a cauliflower-potato mash. It was great :)

I was never good at cooking duck breast. I tried another chef's recipe last year and that was a fail... Until I came across this. Awesome in the end and my wife loves it.

I've made this wonderful recipe twice, exactly as described except stopping the duck at 130F rather than 140 - it was still on the medium side of medium-rare, but fabulous nonetheless.  In tonight's attempt, I lost my head and forgot to make the roux before adding the sauce mixture to the skillet, so had to add the flour as a paste after.  It still came out great.

This is a favorite with my family!! Simply delish and easy. Only thing I do differently is I rinse salt off duck and pat dry before searing as it was too salty for my taste first time I made it. Yummy

First time making this and loved it! It took us twice as long to cook the duck breasts just as another reviewer mentioned. I didn’t have sherry vinegar and used a dry red wine instead. I also used 2 TBSP of the marmalade. I also did not have duck fat and used olive oil instead. We will definitely make this again!

This was my first time cooking duck breast and it came out insanely good! I used plum preserves instead of orange marmalade and the pan sauce was perfectly tangy and sticky. I do think it needed another minute in the pan though.

Great sauce!  I did soak the duck breasts in milk beforehand to make it less gamey, which seemed to work well.

This was good.  Loved the sauce.  Though after 6 mins on skin side and 4 mins on meat side, the breast was barely 100 degrees.  And my stove was on 7/10.  I had to cook it significantly longer to get the same result as Chef John.  Not sure why.  

But wow, it was great!  Will make again

It was amazingly easy and tasted so good!! My husband thought I bought it! The liquor store didn't have Grand Marnier, but did have another brand that worked just as good. Will DEFINITELY do it again!

Very nice taste and crispy skin.  Mine needed to be cooked a little longer.  Next time I will leave it in the pan at least one more minute.

This recipe is wonderful! I followed the directions but had to cook it a little longer because the duck breast was a full pound rather than 8 oz.  I also doubled the sauce recipe.  This was a big hit.  I will make this for guests the next time.

Perfectly done, as directed. Used a side dish of sauteed veg as the accompaniment. Video was very clear instructions.

I have heard that duck breast can be notoriously difficult to get right, but following these directions, mine turned out flawless.  I didn't love the sauce, but I took some shortcuts on the whole marmalade issue, so I think if I had used the good stuff the orange flavor would have been more mellow.  Next time I make duck I will try something different on the sauce, but I will always follow this searing technique.

Easy to do, and just wonderful flavours.  I altered my cooking method on the duck a little....Put the duck in the cold pan, and brought up to frying temperature then when nearly done, put it the oven to keep crispy while I made the sauce. The sauce is soooo good.

I have made this twice, but, both times didn't have the ingredients for the sauce.  We loved it, anyway!  Watch Chef John's video on cooking duck, if you haven't seen it.  I learned how to cook it perfectly watching his method.  Great instruction!

Great sauce, for sure, but any time I make duck breast, it is tough not tender.
I've done it medium rare to medium and nothing makes it tender.  Any advice out there?

My dear favorite chef.

This looks wonderful and want your opinion in using the sauce for chicken breasts.  What do you think?

This was the first time I've cooked duck.  The meat was tender and the sauce was excellent (not sweat, which was great).  Next time I make it, I'll have to remember to use a splatter screen to reduce the mess and to remove the fat off the breast before slicing (we won't eat it and it's hard to see under the sauce).
