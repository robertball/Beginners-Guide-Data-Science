I made this yesterday and cooked it on high for 4 hours - no mushy rice here!  Also, we found it to be delicious - it was flavorful.  I can't imagine it being too bland - there was enough salt in it between the butter, broth, Worcestershire and soup mix.  I used a can of condensed beef broth - perhaps the others used low sodium or bouillon cubes?  Anyway, even my kids liked it, and my husband said he would definitley like to have this again.  It was very easy to prepare and the meat was so tender!  This one is a keeper!

I tried the suggestion posted by others here to cook the dish on high for four hours to avoid mushy rice. Well, mine was still mushy, but not so much as to be unpalatable. I also used a package of flavored white and wild rice. The wild rice was much less mushy, so maybe if I make this again (and I might, as the boyfriend loved it), I'll just use wild rice. Because of the flavoring, I subbed out the beef broth for water.

I also added a ton of herbs from the garden--the ones that worked best in this dish were basil, rosemary, parsley, and sage. I cut up cloves of garlic into quarters and put them on top of the pork chops. They turned out perfectly, and next time I try that trick I'll probably increase the amount of garlic used by 50%. Eating the pork chops with the garlic was about the only thing that made the chops worth eating, though. They were pretty dry, but the thicker pieces fared a little better. Spreading some horseradish on top helped when the garlic ran out.

I also tossed some carrots in the crock pot, and they absorbed a lot of the flavor from the rice.

This rating gets a three because I had to modify it heavily and it still turned out just okay. It managed to avoid a lower score because it is easy to make and the boyfriend wants me to make it again.

This really turned out for me. I used all brown rice, and when I browned my chops I did it in butter, seasoning salt, and poultry powder. My family really liked it. I'll be making this again!

Made this yesterday - it was very tasty.  My rice was not mushy, but I cooked on high for 4 hours, maybe that is the key to this recipe.  We found it very flavorful and the pork chops were super tender.  Will be making this one again.

When I started it I thought it would be wonderful but it turned out terrible. I followed this recipes exactly and the rice turned to mush (not minute rice either) and the pork chops were bland. It was a waste of money. We threw it out and went to Wendy's. Sorry...maybe if it was tweaked it would be better

this is an excellent base recipe. I used pork roast instead of chops. I did 4 hours on the slow cooker. I added the rice 2 hours into the bake. I added water, onions, onion soup mix, peas, pepper, and a little more water after I noticed the rice a little dry. I didnt add anything else, so I didnt do this recipe exact. It came out wonderful. My hubby says his mom would put the rice underneath the meat so it gets all the juices and IS mushy, which they like. Since I added my rice late, and on top, it wasnt mushy. It was perfect!!!

I have made this recipe many times and my family asks for it at least once a month. I usually double the amount of rice and liquids because the rice is the favorite part for my family. I like to use parboiled rice because it seems to always turn out perfect, never mushy. I sometimes just make the rice by itself and serve it with a roast.

I didn't have all the ingredients listed so I substituted the onion soup mix for Knor's Vegetable Soup and used country style pork ribs.......EXCELLENT! It's now become a family favorite!

No water chest nuts or mushrooms.  Added carrots and green beans.  Used salt, cayenne, and curry instead of onion mix.  It was delicious and the rice and vegetables were just the right consistency.

This was so good...the meat just fell off the bone! (I didn't have boneless). I had to make a few changes based on what I did and didn't have on hand. I used 1 C. of brown rice (better glycemic index for my diabetic husband) and 2 C. of beef broth made from a beef base. I didn't have an envelope of onion soup mix so had to do without. Had no water chestnuts either so I doubled the amount of mushrooms. I sprinkled a little seasoned salt while the pork chops were browning. They cooked on low for 6-1/2 hours. The rice turned out very good...brown rice doesn't get mushy as easily. Next time (and there will be one!) I will plan ahead and add the ingredients that I didn't have.

My husband and high school son went ballistic over these pork chops.  I used only brown rice.  I cooked it on high for 3 hours and on low for another 2 hours.  I only gave it 4 stars because the peas turn an ugly shade of greenish-brown....but the guys insisted it didn't matter....they LOVED the rice mixture.  Both made me swear to make it again soon!

I loved this recipe. Lots of flavor. I gave it only 4 stars b/c I did make some changes after reaing some of the other reviews. I made it in the oven instead of the slow cooker to avoid the mushy rice. Followed the recipe exept put in a 9X13 pan and covered. Baked at 400 for 1 hour. Also I seasoned the pork chops to add a little extra flavor to them. It turned out GREAT!

Very good taste. I will make again.  Just make sure you don't use minute rice... it will become very mushy.  The chops were nice and moist... no knife needed.

I usually don't like pork chops, but these were wonderful! I changed the recipe only slightly, as I didn't brown the pork chops first. Also, I didn't have any water chestnuts, so I added sliced almonds about an hour before it was done. The brown and white rice mixture gave it a mixed texture, as the white rice seemed completely soft while the brown still had some firmness to it.

To lower the sodium I ommitted the worch sc.  The left the dish intirely too bland.  If you don't use WS, add other spices.  Recipe was easy and hearty.

I used 1" thick boneless pork chops.  They were fall apart good.  I used a 4 rice mix (white, red, brown and wild.) and it turned into a globby mush.  The amount of onion in it was overwhelming fo rme.  I'm going to make this again, but will probably cook for some time and add the rice in the last 2 hours or something...also, leaving out a bunch of the onion.

Family loved this! I adjusted based on what I had on hand: 1 1/3 c. brown rice, 1/4 c. butter, frozen diced onions, sliced mushrooms, bag of frozen peas, 1 can of chicken broth, few shakes of Worcestershire. Put the chops right on top of it all without browning them first. Turned the crock pot on high and checked on it after 90 minutes. Looked like it was going to be soupy, so I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to thicken it up. After another 60 minutes on high, it was done and I had to add a little bit of water because it got too thick! But it was very tasty. Next time I will cook it longer on a lower temp and not add the creamy soup and see how that works. Overall a very good recipe that is easy to customize.

I tried this recipe for the first time today.  My picky son loved it.  The whole family loved it.  I seasoned my chops w/ natural season salt, pepper, minced garlic, & added Worchestire sauce to the chicken broth, onion mix, and butter in slow cooker.  I didnt' put in the other ingredients.  When my chops were about 30 minutes from being done I put in 2 cups of instant rice and it was a great, perfectly cooked meal.  I should've added more water b/c my rice ended up very seasoned but, everyone loved it.  I loved it also but, was scared it would run up my blood pressure.  Oh, I never cook b/c I'm terrible at it but, I think I'm hooked on allrecipes.com.

This recipe has a good taste to it. The pork chops came out perfectly and could be cut with a fork.  I am only giving this 4 stars due to the fact that the rice did come out mushy.  I will be making this again, but probably not for company.

I'm giving this three stars because the rice was quite good.  I followed other users' suggestions and cooked on high for 4 hours, but still ended up with very dry pork chops.  Unfortunately, I think the rice is just taking all the moisture from the pork chops as it cooks.  This is something I would try again, but maybe place the pork chops under the rice.

Very disappointed.  Used 1-1/2" pork chops and followed recipe except didn't add Worcestershire sauce.  Chops were dry and the rice was pure mush.  Would not try again.

I used brown rice and cooked on low all day.  When I came home the house smelled amazing... however, I was disappointed when I opened the crockpot to find mushy and flavorless rice to go with my pork chops

The pork was tender, flavor ok, the rice didn't get squishy, it was fine. A nice easy one pot meal. However, my picky guys didn't like it, so we won't be making it again.

I tried this recipe today and will not be making this again. I cooked it on low for 5 hours and the rice was way over cooked (turned to mush) and the pork was very dry as well.

I followed the directions to cook on low heat, and it came out really burnt. The rice smelled really bad, too. Salvaged the pork chops which turned out okay.

Ok so the only thing I did was leave out the mushrooms and peas...kept everything else the same.
Now, I was cooking these on low and they were in the crock pot for 3 hours, done and getting dry. The rice, for the most part, was not mushy but actually pretty good.
I think the times are all off but that could just be me. Hubby said he liked it, though. So, I will make it again, but will pay better attention to how long I leave it in. 
THANKS FOR THE RECIPE! :)

I used cream of mushroom soup instead of fresh mushrooms, and substituted carrots for the other veggies because that's what I had on hand. It was delicious! I also added a bit of minced garlic, and basil seasoning, extra water, and a bit more W sauce. Loved it!

I replaces the peas with fresh green beans and used brown long grain rice and fresh wild rice. Fabulous!!! Flavorful, tender meat and no mushy rice. I've made it several times and have never been disappointed.

I made this just this morning and it has a fabulous flavor but I had to add another can of chicken broth to make it juicy enough. (didn't have any more beef broth)  I cooked it on high for 3 hours and used 10 thin  cut boneless pork chops.  I really loved the idea to use water chestnuts,..the crunch is really great in there. The rice was ok, but if I make again,I think I will try making the rice in a separate pan and mix afterwards. The end results this time sort of reminded me of Cajun Gumbo.(not as spicy but same type dish).

I make this often.  Substitutions to accomodate what you have in the pantry are not a problem.   DO NOT add salt.  There is plenty in the soup mix and beef stock.   But following the recipe as given gets the best result.  Great comfort food.

So, I made this a year ago and didn't even realize it!  So, I decided to change my review!  I've made this before an oven version a recipe of Trisha Yearwood's actually.  I wanted something crock pot so made this instead.  Now, I changed a lot.  I omitted peas, water chestnuts, and mushrooms.  My chops weren't very thick about 1/2 to 3/4 on some and I used 8.  So, naturally I had to change some things.  2 cups of rice, 1 cup of water, 2 cups of beef broth, 1 envelope of onion soup mix, 1 tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 an onion chopped, and 1/4 cup of unsalted butter.  With all that I cooked on high not on low because of time constraints and others have mentioned mushy rice.  Turned out fabulous.

There is a problem with the rice getting too soft.  I used brown rice and it was soft after only 2 hours on high.  This recipe was very good tasting.

I am giving it 3 stars because it does have potential.  The flavor was super, but my rice...  yes, it turned to mush (and I used regular, not instant)  I am wondering if I used all brown next time if it would be better?  I'll experiment and let y'all know.  I also cooked it long on low...  maybe I need to try cooking it fast on high?
