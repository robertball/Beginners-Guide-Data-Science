I couldn’t see adding green part of leeks, split horizontally.  Tough and too messy to eat in soup.  I puréed the squash and added coconut milk and ginger, making a completely different soup, which was delicious.

I used chicken broth and I added kale and cannellini beans.  I also sprinkled shredded parmesan on top just before eating.  A nice, hearty soup!
