We loved these ramen burgers! We included one of the seasoning packets in with the noodles and they had TONS of flavor. We also mixed the chopped green onions into patty. So delicious - and not really a burger as much as a mix of all those incredible Japanese flavors: soy, sesame, onion, and noodles.

Sounds AWESOME! I think I will have to put a VeggieBurger in the middle, though.

This actually saddens me to have to do this, but we did not like these at all. I was so hoping that these would hit the spot for us b/c I loved the concept of these. I had no issue making the ramen 'buns', and actually had fun doing it. I made these into sliders. I do wish they had more flavor, though. I felt like when I bit into it all I could taste was plain noodles. Again, I am so sorry, but these just didn't do it for us...Thanks for sharing.

We love Ramen Burgers! We make the Ramen "bun" exactly as this recipe calls for but instead of the other ingredients in this list, we just make a regular hamburger patty with salt and pepper. Then after frying both the hamburger patty and the Ramen bun (separately of course), we fry an egg and put a slice of cheddar on it and mix a little ketchup and Sriracha sauce, assemble the works and Voila! A whole new type of Ramen Burger... and delicious!!!

Absolutely easy and fantastic. We live on Maui and these are all the rage on Oahu, selling for $10 a burger! Followed the recipe exactly but as advised by other members did add the seasoning packet. We presented it with a teriyaki burger with thousand island dressing made with homemade ketchup and a spring mix. We picked a container that was about the same size and shape as the patty we were going to make. Line first with plastic wrap, place a small amount of noodles then more plastic wrap. Weighted it down and placed in the refrigerator for about an hour. They cooked up perfectly. Not even the 3 minutes called for. We fried ours in EVOO with some garlic. Mahalo for such a great recipe!

This is a great recipe and I did just a few small variations on it.  Instead of Beef I used ground pork to make the patties, I added a little salt and onion to the patties.  I did not use soy or sesame oil.  I generally only use a tiny bit of sesame oil when stir frying but I find that it can make a recipe go wrong if you are heavy handed.  So After making the noodles and putting them in the cups I put them in the fridge for a few minutes before frying, this worked great to help the shape set.  As for the sauce, I used hoison with a bit of chili.  The pork patties, egg, cheese and hoison blended nicely and the ramen buns brought all the flavors together.  This will be a new favorite late night snack at our house.

I've made it using the egg binder noodle method and the sauce and scallions, etc. and haven't liked the results. I’ve seen enough ramen burgers being made and tried enough recipes to know that execution is not the issue. I like this method better and do consider it an improvement. However, I don't think either is a particularly good concept.

I don't eat alot of ground beef so I used ground turkey and ground pork for the burger with bell pepper and onions. I also made fish burgers using the shrimp packet in the noodles it turned out great.

For the result, this was too much trouble.  The good old American cheeseburger is much tastier and easier to make.

I'm picky with what vegetables I eat. I changed up the recipe quite a bit. Added more cheese, more egg, and I added the spice packet to the beef. It was delicious. I make these all the time

I did a take on this with slaw, a chorizo patty, cheddar cheese and a scallion and egg mixture. Was very good! Messy but it did hold together until the last bite. Posted photo.

Instead of using the ramen as buns, I used regular buns and added the ramen as another layer to the burger. The egg on the burger really made it, as well as the flavoring packet in the egg mixture. I don’t really like spicy foods so taking out the Chile sauce made the burger pretty good for me. Maybe add some more basic spices like onion and garlic powder to the burger to give it more of a kick. Definetly will make again and if you have any and are willing to try something new, add Montreal steak seasoning to the burgers and you will get an explosion of flavor along with  ramen.

Pretty underwhelming. I bet it'd be exciting to someone who has never scrambled an egg in ramen before, but it wasn't nearly as good as I had hoped. I put the ramen packet flavoring in it like suggested by commenters, and I bet it would taste very plain without it, because even with it, it wasn't that exciting. Still, it was fun.

While this is an interesting idea and the ramen patties did hold up to being made into "buns", I thought they were too eggy - the soft, squishy texture mixed with a hamburger was odd and not something I want to try again.

I've read about these for some time so I decided to try it. I used my circular silicone egg rings to keep the ramen neat.  I was concerned about the ramen being mushy so I cooked it longer to try and make it crispy/firm. I didn't use egg on this because eggs on a hamburger just seems wrong lol. Overall it wasn't bad but I don't see why people will wait in long lines for it.

I was so surprised that there was a recipe for this. I first at a Ramen burger once from a food truck and loved it. This recipe is better than what I got at the food truck and my bf loved it.

Thank you for posting this up! My tummy is very happy!

We loved these! I added one package of the ramen flavor to the water for the noodles. I also added chopped green onion to the burger mix. Both suggestions came from past reviews and worked great. I topped the burgers with cheddar cheese.

The burger was great and so was the chili/ketchup sauce. The ramen buns, however, didn't work for me. They never crisped up and tasted bland.

I thought I'd give it a try.  Just bought Beef Ramen Noodles, thought that adding the seasoning to the bun would give the burger a kick.  I'm going to substitute Lettuce for the Aragula though.  Use what I have.
