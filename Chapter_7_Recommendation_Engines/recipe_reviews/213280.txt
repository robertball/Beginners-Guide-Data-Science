Turned out great. You need to flip them halfway through if you want both sides to get crisp, and you should also spray whichever side is on top with cooking spray to crisp it up a bit. I required more than 10 minutes in my oven. Thanks for the recipe!

These turn out wonderfully. I love that these aren't fried, but they have a great feel and texture. I put cooked red quinoa, a bit of salsa, and some cheddar cheese in ours, and we gobbled them up. Sealing the edges with water is a great idea. Yum!

Really good. Not the best Quesadillas ever. Also, the water thing didn't work for me either, but they were fun to make.

This turned out great.  I added some sauteed onion and mushrooms.  I also coated the tops with vegetable oil and after taking them out of the oven, placed them under the broiler for a couple of minutes to make them crispy instead of soft.

The texture is great. The taste is outstanding. I did this for a school project, but now, I make them all the time.

I love Quesadillas, but with this economy I can't afford to go out to as much.  So, I wanted a recipe to make them at home.  I think these are great and they are not fried.  I used left over meat to the filling and added an avocado and sour cream on top after I took them our of the oven.  My lunch was tasty and economical.  I am serving them for the super bowl game.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were cheesy and saucey. Eat them fast or the picante sauce will make the tortilla soggy... I browned mine in a skillet, to hot for the oven right now.

This was pretty good.  I used my own homemade salsa and I liked the baking method.  The chiles were a nice touch too!  Still feels like it's missing a little something.  I served mine with sour cream.

Taste was good. I was excited about the baking but the water trick didn't work for me.
