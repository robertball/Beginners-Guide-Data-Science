You mean all this time I'd been drinking this and never knew to all it a Cape Cod???  Oh, well I guess you learn something new every day!  At any rate whether you're like me and just call it Cranberry & Vodka or a little more sophisticated and call it a "Cape Cod" - Cheers!!!

This has been my favorite drink all summer.  I usually add a splash of seltzer at the end to fizz it up.  Flavored seltzers add new flavor twists.  I've even shaken it up with the different flavors of cranberry (cranraspberry is a favorite).  Very refreshing during the heat of summer and what better way to get your healthy juices in?  :)

I like to drink this in the summer in a tall glass, squeezing the lime wedge (or two) into the glass and topping off with club soda. I usually double the alcohol as I like my drinks stronger.

There's a reason this drink is a classic, it's simple, delicious and beautiful.  An old favorite that I am glad to revisit again and again.

I'm with Jillian--- :-)   and maybe if you just ask for vodka & cranberry you won't get charged for a "fancy" drink!!  I know BARBARELLA107 thinks it's a basic cosmo, but I believe this drink came before the cosmo....  PLUS-- cosmos have Lime Juice & Triple Sec, which makes it sweeter... I love both so it doesn't matter to me!!

Nice Tang. Anyone who likes cranberries are sure to love this. The lime adds a bit  of a twist. Enjoyable drink. One of my favorites.

My husband introduced me to Diet-7Up with a splash of cranberry juice-straight cran juice is too tart for me-very tasty!  Then I got the idea to add raspberry flavored vodka to the mix and it's even better!

My favorite cocktail ever!  I  use diet cranberry juice and 100 proof Smirnoff with a slice of lime. It's virtually impossible to goof this simple drink up!
