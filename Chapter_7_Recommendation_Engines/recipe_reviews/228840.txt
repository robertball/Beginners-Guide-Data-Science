This recipe is great! Although a bit more work than some of the other recipes I found, it's well worth it!
I used frozen and thawed turkey left over from Christmas, so the turkey didn't exactly stay in perfect cubes. I added garlic to the onions and used more sweet potatoes than in the recipe. I found that after adding the turkey sauce to the vegetables it all thickened in less than 5 minutes. It did take a long time to cool though. 
I had 2 frozen pies shells in foil pans which I had made before Christmas and these worked perfectly for this recipe.

This was pot pie was delicious. I would add a little less oregano next time and maybe a bit of poultry seasoning. The consistency of the vegetables and turkey was perfect. Great recipe!

Love the sweet potato! I would have added more flour for a thicker sauce and not precooked the bottom of the crust because it was so hard to put the top crust without it separating
