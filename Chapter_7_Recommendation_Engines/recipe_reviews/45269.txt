Made this for a company potluck and it was a tremendous success.  I would recommend upsizing the portions though, as it does cook down quite a bit.  I went with 9 medium sized eggplants and it was adequate as a side for about 6-7 people.  As a dip it would be fine for 9-11 servings.

Pretty good.  The final yield was a lot less than I was expecting.  I rescaled it to feed 6 and it looked like it could barely serve as a side for 4.

I served this as a dip on french bread, in a pita as a sandwich and then finished it off as a salad.  A real party in your mouth.

This is awesome! My husbands comment was "this is really good, I want to have this at least once a week!" I am making it again tonight to serve as a side with spaghetti and meatballs.   If cut in chunks it works well as a side, if you cut it fine as the recipe says then it works well on crackers/whatever fits your fancy.   Really good I would recommend this to everyone and have!   For 2 people a medium sized eggplant worked perfectly!

The flavors were quite good, but the texture was slightly more slimy than I would have liked. I may puree or mash this next time, rather than chopping the eggplant. Also, I ate this at lukewarm temperature and skipped the part where you have it sit after mixing everything together, so it may be better when I eat the cold leftovers with lunch tomorrow.

I didn't have time to bake the eggplant for 1 1/2 hours so I chopped it up raw in to small pieces and sauteed until soft.  Then added the garlic, cooked for a couple minutes and added in all the sauce ingredients.  It had a good flavor but I think chopped onion and bell pepper would have really elevated this to great.  Served on homemade  almond flour crackers tasty!

Yummmm!  I made this recipe exactly as stated however I only had 3 eggplant. I went ahead and grilled a bundle of white asparagus with a bit of olive oil and added that to the bowl of eggplant. It added a good color contrast and turned out delicious!

I really enjoyed this. We served it on toast. Some was left over, and it was excellent with a sweet potatoe for breakfast. I'm planning to grow eggplants in my garden this coming summer just to make this dish. I'm not a huge eggplant fan, but this is GOOD.

This was so-so. It was fairly flavorful, but the consistency didn't do it for us.

This "Eggplant Salad" was excellent! Quite honestly, the eggplant that I had (long skinny ones about the size of giant carrots) tasted sweetish and excellent by themselves just after baking before I did anything to them. I had soaked my eggplant halves in salt water to remove any bitter juices, which is the standard way to prepare eggplant for anyone who doesn't know (otherwise eggplant can be very bitter). This recipe "classed them up" so that I could serve them in an elegant way to guests. I have access to about 10 different varieties of eggplant in my local market, and they are all different shapes and sizes, so an instruction of "6 medium eggplants" is pretty ambiguous to me. I proceeded VERY SLOWLY, adding the balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon at a time. My eggplant yielded 1.5 cups of mash, and 2 tablespoons of vinegar, and 1 clove of garlic went perfectly with that amount of mash. My eggplant was naturally sweet, so I didn't need sugar. Based on my result, I suggest that the recipe as written requires 3 cups of eggplant mash which would make about 6 servings (1/2 cup each) as a side salad. Thank you Sandi for sharing your recipe.
