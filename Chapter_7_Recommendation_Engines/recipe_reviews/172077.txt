This dish is delish!  Only thing I would do different is to pre-bake the crust a bit before loading all the goodies on top.  The edges were cooked but center was still a bit underdone.  I'll be making this again for sure.

Delicious!  :)  We made it tonight and followed the directions, except for we made our own crust.  It turned out fabulous!  We used Knorr's Hollandaise Sauce mix.  One piece is very filling.  Next time we'll play around to add our favorite toppings (mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, peppers).  Mmmm!  Perfect for any time of the day!

What a great idea! Didn't turn out quite as nice as I was hoping, but still pretty good and a great change from our normal breakfasts. I baked the crust for about 3-4 minutes first, then added the toppings. It really only needed to bake about 12-15 minutes after that. 30 minutes would have been way too long.

Great for breakfast! I used a Boboli bread shell vs. crescent rolls and Canadian bacon vs. ham.  I cut back on the eggs and overall it was very tasty!

Our family really really enjoyed this.  I baked the rolls for about 7 minutes before topping it with sauce, then Eggbeaters, more sauce, chopped Oscar Meyer Virginia Ham, & a very light layer of mild cheddar.  Baked it for about 10 more minutes & served with steamed asparagus--DELICIOUS!!  I used Knorr Hollandaise Sauce & store brand crescent rolls.  I baked mine at 375 degrees for a total of maybe 20 minutes~~ 30 minutes seems liked it would be WAY too long to bake-would make the sauce disappear IMO.  My Husband & Son love Hollandaise Sauce-I'm not a huge fan, but it was wonderful on this "pizza"!!  Thank you for a interesting twist on Eggs Benedict!

This is a fun twist on regular eggs benedict and much easier to make for a group then the standard eggs benedict. It is very filling and is great idea for a quick dinner.  My kids love this!  I like it but I'm not sold on the cresent crust. I feel it overpowers the other flavors.   I took the other's advise and precooked the crust and only baked it for 18 minutes.   I will be making this on a regular basis but will try alternatives to the cresent dough and will add additional hollandaise on top of the eggs before the cheese.

Update: I have tried various alternatives to the cresent roll crust because I just couldn't get past the flavor of it. Recently I made the recipe using Pilsbury Pizza Dough and it made all the difference in the world! Everyone preferred the pizza dough option. I used the pilsbury directions for baking the crust. Bake for 8 min, remove from oven, add toppings and then bake for additional 14 min. I also used only 6 eggs and it was just right.

I made this recipe, this past week while My boyfriend Aaron and I were staying up north at his parents cabin. HE LOVED IT! I will totally make this again! Over and over!  The only thing I wish I had done was get super thin sliced deli ham and  had used a milder cheddar...but besides that it was really super good...I made the whole recipe, and Aaron ended up eating like 2/3's of the whole thing...within like 20 minutes, Thanks for sharing!

Good stuff!  My suggestion is to season your scrambled eggs very well, and the packaged hollandaise sauce can taste a little artificial.  I cooked this as a cassarole, placing everything in a 9x13 pan instead of a pizza pan, and everything turned out fine.  Would definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, just wow!  I love this version of a breakfast casserole.  I did 1/2 the recipe and next time will use the entire amount of the Knoor Hollandaise sauce.  I did bake the crescents for 5 minutes before completing the steps.  I also baked it for about 22 minutes and it was done perfectly.  I was concerned that the eggs would be over done but the hollandaise sauce soaked into them and made them creamy and delicious!  The ham was perfect with the sharp cheddar cheese.  I did use a bit less ham than called for and a little more cheese.  I will make this again for sure, it's a winner!!

Halved the recipe and made in a 7x11" pan, after spraying with non-stick cooking spray. I used 1 can croissant rolls and pre-baked for 7 mins. When done, I used AR's "Blender Hollandaise" sauce and poured it all over the crust; added eggs, sauteed mushrooms (from AR's Pat's Mushroom Saute'), lunchmeat ham slices torn into random small pieces, and a mixture of sharp cheddar and monterrey jack cheeses. Everyone went back for seconds, so this one's a keeper!

My kids loved this.  I'm not a huge fan of the canned rolls...but, had some I needed to use up.  Next time I may try a different bread.  I doubled the Blender Hallandaise Sauce on AR in place of the packaged stuff.  The only change I would make is not cook it as long next time, it was done in about 15- 18 minutes.  Perfect for a breakfast buffet!

Yummy--didn't change a thing except baking the crust for about 4-5 minutes before topping it.  A really unique breakfast to serve to guests!

Just made this and am eating it as I write this.  IT IS GREAT and SUPER EASY.  I halved the recipe and put it in a 12x7.5 casserole dish.  The crescent rolls fit perfectly - just roll them down and press down and up sides slightly.  You end up wasting a little bit of hollandaise sauce, but I wish I would've put a bit more on.  This is the best recipe I've found in ages.

Thanks Lou! This was great make it for dinner and it was was made pretty close to original recipe. I made this recipe and halved it because there was only 4 of us. My hubby bought the wrong croissants but i made them work. Did what other reviewers said which was to parbake the crust. I used Knorr Hollandaise mix (delish) and I put in under the egg and drizzled more over the egg. then ham/cheese. Fantastic for a quick meal, not that figure friendly but soooo good! yum!

I served mine with asparagus as a side and had some hollandaise left over in case anyone wanted more

This was super good!  Only change I made was to use pizza dough instead of the crescent rolls.  Easy to pull together and tasted great.  Hubby was in heaven since eggs benedict are his all time favorite meal!

really i would give it 10 if i could! MY husband and children LOVED this "pizza", we used to get these at P&C but since they have went out of business we can no longer. I didn't have any lemon juice so i used grapefruit with no one the wiser, i didn't have ham either, LOL so i used breakfast sausage and it turn out great.

My picky eater ate seconds and said "Mom, this is glorious!" :) Added some Spike seasoning, dill, and pepper to the eggs, threw some bacon on as well because I had some pre-cooked handy, and per other reviewers suggestions, pre-baked the crust for about 5 minutes. Fabulous addition to my "breakfast for dinner" slot in my rotation!

Although I changed a lot of the ingredients, it's definitely a 5-star idea.  Instead of Hollandaise and ham, I topped mine with country gravy, crumbled sausage, then eggs and a thin layer of white cheddar on top (oh, and I used buttery crescent rolls since that's all they had at my store).  I cooked the crescent roll 'crust' 6 minutes before topping it, then cooked an additional 15 minutes with toppings at 400 degrees.  I put the pizza in a 9 inch pie pan (halved the recipe), and my hubby and I scarfed down the WHOLE THING in one sitting for Xmas morning.  OMG, it was good!  There is no doubt I'll make this again, probably this coming holiday weekend!!!!  I'm looking forward to trying the Hollandaise version.

Very tasty recipe!  I halved the recipe and used bacon and prosciutto instead of ham, and guyere instead of cheddar (it's what I had on hand) added some green onions and prebaked the crust for 7 minutes.  Turned out perfectly!  Will definitely be making this on a regular basis!  Oh, and Pillsbury has come out with a flat sheet of cresent rolls in a tube...no perforations.... which I used for this recipe.

Easy to make.  I used Knor mix as others suggested.  I also baked the cresent rolls for 7 minutes before putting eggs and sauce on top. I spread half the sauce on the rolls and half over eggs. Once everything was on the rolls, I baked it for 18 mins. Served for a ladies brunch and everyone loved it. It looked wonderful!

My family loved this!  It was super easy and flavorful.  I can't wait to make it next time and start to play with additional ingredients... diced tomatoes, onions, bacon... endless.

The only things we changed were: we used sausage instead of ham, and shredded bacon sharp cheese. It came out great, and we will make it again!

This was a big hit with my family.  I made it with a store-bought pre-baked pizza crust and it worked great.  Made it the second time with bacon instead of ham.  A new family breakfast favorite!

I've made this several times for family and guests. Everyone loves it.  Don't know what I do wrong but I never need 2 whole cans of crescent rolls. Still comes out good.

It was ok.  You couldn't really tasted the sauce.  It wasn't bad tasting, it just seemed like it would have tasted better if I would have just made eggs benedict

Very yummy.  Have made it twice already.  I did pre-cook the crust for 4 minutes prior and only cooked for 15 minutes.  I added Taylor Ham or bacon instead of ham.  And mushrooms.  So yummy and the whole family loved it!!

This was a big hit with my family and friends for a brunch today.  I made this  using Canadian Bacon instead of ham. I sautéed the canadian bacon after I cut in little pieces.  It was great! I will definately make this again.

I'm not sure I would make this recipe again. It was somewhat bland and there wasn't a lot to it. That could be taken as a good or bad thing I suppose. If you want eggs benedict, make the real thing!

Really good, but hubby and I got tired of it fairly quickly (it's just the two of us).  We were trying to use up some leftover scrambled eggs and breakfast sausage from our family Christmas brunch that went uneaten. I would definitely make it again, but only when there are more people around to enjoy it.

I liked this a lot, but it was really really rich.  I think next time I won't even use hollandaise sauce since it's just sooo much butter but not that flavourful.  I guess technically it wouldn't be eggs benedict with that change, but still a great egg bake.

We really enjoyed this pizza! We made it for Christmas brunch and one thing that surprised me was how heavy it is! It's definitely filling as well. I pre-cooked the crust for about three minutes but next time would do it for five minutes or so, as it was still not firm enough for our tastes. The mixture of the hollandaise sauce and the eggs, however, was ideal and we'll definitely be making it again!

Wow! I made this for my co-workers this morning and I am so glad that I gave it a try!   The only changes I made were that I used a rectangle pan and not a pizza pan. I baked the crescent dough about 3 minutes before the toppings also. I only had to bake the entire thing for 15 minutes and it was PERFECT!! Everyone will like this. Give it a try. :)

This was amazing! No leftovers. The hollandaise sauce was the key for this pizza. My DH doesn't like the sauce by itself, but said he loved this dish. And after he ate most of it himself, he asked when I was going to make it again. Very soon!! After you make it once, it'll be even easier the second time. I do recommend cooking the crust for at least a few minutes. I did and it came out perfectly cooked. And the left over sauce from the packet is great on other recipes. Add it to a ham and egg breakfast burrito... no waste!

This recipe is wonderful!  I made it for my kids and they absolutely loved it.  I made scrambled eggs again a few days later, left the eggs in the skillet, and then topped the eggs with the leftover hollandaise sauce, ham, and cheese and it was almost as good as the original recipe.  Very tasty!

I made this using Master Pizza Dough recipe in 14in pan, spread dough out to edges, spread hollandaise sauce. I only used 6 eggs scrambled (salt and pepper)  and diced up a couple of ounces of packaged, sliced smoked ham over it and sprinkled with shredded cheese. I only had 4 cheese Mexican blend but I scattered torn up pieces of mild cheddar slices as well. The dough rose a bit on the pan for a thicker crust because eggs were still cooking but was so good. That recipe for pizza dough is the best ever!

Everyone loved this recipe. I forgot I didn’t have a pizza pan so used a sheet pan and baked the crust alone for 4 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients.

This was a great idea! I usually make my breakfast pizza with white gravy base and never considered using hollandaise, which I really liked! I made my own crust and hollandaise from scratch which is more work, but I liked the end result.  Thanks for the recipe!

I put parsley and chopped green onion on top before cooking. Delicious!! *** Edit** This time we used bacon and sausage instead of ham and We left off the green onions. STILL delicious but not as much as the first one.

Terrific idea, after making this pizza what I would change, the cheddar really takes away from the Benedict part of the recipe, I would use mozzarella next time. I am also going to try just cracking eggs right on the pizza as well to mimic a traditional eggs Benedict.

I made no changes and found it to be absolutely delicious.   In the future I might use sausage rather than ham for a change

Wasn't that great. Kids thought it was OK but wife and I didn't like it.

I read one of the reviews that suggested I pre-bake the crust a bit before loading all the toppings --glad I did!!  Turned out perfect with this modification.  Will definitely make again!

Easy and very tasty, but needed some heat. Next time I will add some hot sauce to the mix. Green onion on top is a nice garnish. Served it with a spinach mandarin salad.

I didn't use crescent rolls for the crust. Instead I used a pre-baked pizza crust and baked it for 8 minutes. Super simple and my family loved it, especially my husband. He kept going back for more!

Everyone loved it!  I served with fresh fruit.  As another reviewer said, I would also recommend pre-baking the crescent roll crust almost completely.   This is a keeper for family get-togethers - it's easy and pretty much fool-proof.

This recipe became our "It's Sunday, let's treat ourselves"  recipe. We love it! I pre-bake the crust a bit, and I don't cook the eggs fully. Today I added some bacon and some sauteed asparagus and some smoked paprika into the egg batter. I think I perfected the recipe for our taste buds.  Thank you for the recipe.

I added more sauce, and I make my own. I would make these for a crowd as it does simplify poaching the eggs, but there were only four of us and I wish I would have gone the traditional route.

This was good for the large breakfast party I had to serve a few days ago. However, while I LOVE hollindaise, this was not a hit for me. Others ate it, but it didn't get accolades. I followed the recipe exactly except I used a premodern large pizza crust. So maybe that was the difference. As I made it, it was lackluster and pretty bland.
