Delicious recipe!  You can also use this as the springboard for a light main dish.  Try wrapping slices of ham around the leeks before baking, then serve with a side of mashed potatoes, rice or crusty bread.  This alternative version is particularly attractive if you don't halve the leeks (but you would need to pre-cook them for about 8 minutes, then either use the leek broth in place of some of the milk, or add it to a soup later).  You can also add another layer of flavor to this dish by stirring about 1/4 tsp. dry or prepared mustard into the sauce before baking.

This recipe was awesome. I tweaked it a little bit by doubling the cheese sauce and adding in a couple of potatos that were cut au gratin style. Very delicious!

4 stars with the additon of a buttered breadcrumb topping. It really makes the dish, adding crunch where otherwise there would only be mush. I wasn't crazy about the stringy texture of the leeks, which are fairly new to me. I cut off the green tops - was I supposed to peel off the outer layers too? Overall, a nice way to use up leftover leeks (I halved the sauce recipe to use on one large leek leftover from a stew.) This sauce would also work nicely for vidalia onions.

I didn't make this exactly, so I'm giving it four stars. I combined this with another recipe, since I needed to use up some eggplant as well. I made the cheese sauce nearly exactly as written--just increased the quantity a little. I used 1/2 cup of cheese before it was grated, so it was more than that after grating. I layered thinly sliced eggplant, leek, and roma tomato, poured on some of the sauce, made another layer, more sauce, a final layer of just eggplant, and the tiny bit of sauce that was left. I covered loosely with foil, and it is in the oven right now smelling great.

Pretty tasty, although, like another user, I was somewhat put off by the stringy texture of the leeks. Next time I think I will add bread crumbs, as other users have suggested - it definitely is lacking in texture. I used a smoked cheddar cheese, which gave it an AMAZING flavor, and I think I will do that every time I make it. A great recipe for my first time trying leeks!

My husband and I both had to restrain ourselves from eating it all in one night. Only had 2 leeks, so I added 1 1/2 cups of leftover mashed potato on top, topping it off with a little bit of the grated cheddar.

This was the first try of eating or making leeks at my house and this recipe was AWESOME!  I added bread crumbs to the top to crunch it up a little (I'm a picky texture eater) and it helped make this amazing.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Never had leeks before and this recipe was very simple, quick, and tasty! I actually just sprinkled a little cheddar cheese on top and didn't even use the whole 1/2 cup as suggested and it still was great.

Bought the leeks & then found this recipe! It is FABULOUS! Took Raye of Sunshine's advice & cut leeks in rounds (thank you vm). Used Smart Balance light (helps your cholesterol) instead of butter & it was perfect. Used half flour & half quinoa - next time all quinoa. Next time I'll use soy cheddar (low fat) & smoked cheddar for flavor. Did add a little dried parsley & 2 dashes of hot sauce - next time I'll add more hot sauce.  Sprinkled top with Italian seasoned bread crumbs - next time I'll add some cheese to that topping too.  This is a recipe that I will cook very, very often.  All the reviews really helped. This recipe deserves more than 5 stars!

Easy and delicious. I always cut leeks into rounds as it stops them from being "stringy". The only other changes I made were to omit the garlic (due to allergy of one of my guests) and I had some leftover whipping cream, so made the cheese sauce with half skim milk and half whipping cream. My dinner guests raved about this dish and I'll definitely be making this again.

I honestly thought I'd love this. And I didn't sorry. the cheese sauce, didn't have that cheese flavor at all. It tasted like a biscuit gravy. And I love leeks, in all sorts of dishes. But I made this twice thinking maybe it was out I presented the dish. The 1st time, I made it as instructed but no one would touch it, I guess the look was more off putting then the flavor. So I tried again a 2nd night and chopped up the leeks into smaller pieces instead of leaving the leeks in the long sliced form. I didn't try it the 1st time to know that I wasn't going to like it. But did the 2nd time and it really wasn't pleasing to anyone's taste but one of my kids. Sorry.

Absolutely LOVED this basic recipe - you can do so much with it to custom it to your own individual taste.  This was my very first time preparing leeks as a sidedish, and I was very impressed with  them.  We will be enjoying them more often, perhaps with a touch more cheese added, and some seasoned salt.  Thank you!

This was our families first time to try leeks. The recipe was simple and easy to follow. We followed the recipe as written but added 1/4 cup more cheese to the sauce and sprinkling another 1/4 cup on top of the dish before baking. Having not experienced leeks before, we were surprised by the strong onion flavor of the leeks but everyone eat it and said that it was good, even the two picky eaters.

This recipe gave me one of those why on earth didn't I think of that moments. I've been cooking cauliflower this way all my married life, it just never occurred to me to do it with leeks. I used just the white and pale green parts of the leeks as the dark green can be a bit bitter and tough. A big hit with my family. Thanks Stephstargirl.

Only use the white/light green parts of the leek. Split in half lengthwise, then cut into 2 inch rounds. Sliced potatoes au gratin style (2) and added halved romas, about 10. Didn't have cheddar, so used mozzarella and a tiny bit of mexican cheese. Made bread crumbs out of one hoagie roll, and added that to the top. Looks delish, and am waiting now for it to cook.

As another reviewer suggested, I modified this dish to be a complete meal (heartier over pasta or rice).  I sliced the leeks into rings and rinsed them thoroughly.  They filled most of my casserole dish - I used 5, discarding the dark green tops. Then I sprinkled bite-sized pieces of smoked turkey over the leeks, then made the cheese sauce and poured it on top of everything.  A breadcrumb topping straight from the box and into the oven for about 20 minutes.  Delicious!  I could tweak it forever, but the basic light meal was amazing.

I used young leeks from my garden and followed the recipe except I did sprinkle a few fine breadcrumbs, a little grated parmesan, and a little extra cheddar cheese over the top.   My husband and I both loved it.   It was simple, quick, I typically have all the ingredients on hand, and extremely tasty.    It is definitely something I would consider serving as a side dish for guests.

Delicious! I added potatoes and parmesan cheese to the milk, cheddar and flour mixture. Also added some extra cheddar on top because we love cheese :)

These were very good! Simple but different for our house.  My husband couldn't stop saying how good they were.

1st time I've made leeks, they had a good flavor & the sauce was a good compliment.  Plan to make again, as my husband liked it.

I would have cut the leeks up better and maybe added more to it.

This is very nice. I used mozzarella cheese because that's what I had. Very tender and good flavor. I cooked the leeks a bit longer to avoid any string texture.

I liked this simple, easy to prepare recipe.  I'm always trying to find new veggies to add to the table, and have recently decided to give leeks a try.  This would be pretty easy to kick up the flavor by adding a dash or two of hot sauce if you are feeling adventuresome.  I probably won't make these frequently, as hubby not a leek fan, but I liked the basic recipe.

This is the everything recipe. You can put anything into it like one reviewer said, "this is my cauliflower recipe". You can substitute other vegetables and the list is endless. I have personally used zucchini and it was great!!

This was the first time I ever prepared leeks.  I have heard of potato and leek soup, so I thought that having thinly sliced potatoes under the leeks and sauce would be a nice touch. 

Also, next time I make this recipe, I will cut the leeks into bite size pieces and spread them over the potatoes, followed by the cheese sauce.  This way would eliminate having to cut through the leeks.  My whole family loved this dish.  Definitely a do again dish!!

This is a great base to start from. Add more S&P, herbs (parsley, dry mustard, powdered onion- few shakes of each), shredded parmigiana. Definitely cut the leeks into rounds or half rounds!  Top with breadcrumbs (I used homemade from stale hotdog buns- decadent!) & cheddar/parm.

The cheese roux came out great, however, the recipe says to "half the leeks lengthwise".  This resulted in a very tough mass of leeks that were impossible to cut through.  
I will make this again but I will definitely slice the leeks

It's very odd. This was my first time ever using Leeks. I've looked and admired them over time, but I don't think I'd buy them again. Onions work fine and easier to eat. I did do what someone else suggested and used a single potato and sliced it on top of the leeks. I'm glad I did because the Leeks were hard to eat. You cut and cut, but it seems you can't cut them down. Not bad flavor at all. I can see why cutting them up for soup is good.

Great flavor but I think I’ll add some hot sauce or harrisa. Great no carb version of Mac and cheese! I also added some fresh picked dandelion leaves for some bitter to balance all the fat. Paired with a nice table full bodied  white wine.

It's my first posting to allrecipes.com, and so far the most delicious and simplest recipe I've used from this website to date.
I've made the following changes to the original recipe, based on the feedback given by the other users (many thanks!).

First off, I added one small grated potato and half a Knorr instant onion soup. Then, instead of milk, I used cooking cream (15%). Since I had no cheddar, I used leftovers of smoked cheese and cambozola as well as some cream cheese that I found in my fridge. All in all, I'd say it was 2x the amount recommended by the recipe.
On top of the casserole I sprinkled a thin layer of pre-seasoned bread crumbs. 
The final result is delicious, although I'd think not too calorie-conscious :)

Very tasty. The  family liked it and said it was good, so that's a real plus. I'd make it again. You could use other cheese other than cheddar for a real nice change.

The flavor was good, but there wasn't enough sauce to cover the leeks, and it could have used more time in the oven. If I make it again I would double the cheese and cook it about 5-7 minutes longer.

I only had Mexican 4-cheese shredded mix so I used that and doubled it. Seem to work fine. I did add sliced potatoes. I put them first and then covered with the leeks. I also topped with breadcrumbs mixed with Parmesan cheese near the end of the cooking time. I finely sliced the leeks crosswise--I think they would be stringy otherwise. Would go nicely with a chicken breast.

Very simple and quite good.  The "onioness" if the leeks cooks out and pairs nicely with the cheddar. 
I also added about 2T of Sriracha.

OMG, this was soooo good, added fresh parsley, more cheese, did half lowfat milk and heavy cream and thinly sliced potatoes and cooked it at 400 for 30 minutes and the house was filled with such an incredible aroma.  And the taste was awesome.  A great dish for a special occasion, holiday dinner, potluck or just for you average mon-fri dinner side dish.  A true keeper!!!!!!!

This should have been delish but I was terribly disappointed: more sauce than veg, the only thing that relieved the mushiness was the stringiness. It just didn't work.

YUMM-O!  Halved then sliced the leeks.  Had a couple slices of ham in the fridge so I chopped and added also.  Had only a small amount of cheddar, so I threw in some mozzarella too.  Despite my additions, I know as is it would have been just as tasty.
