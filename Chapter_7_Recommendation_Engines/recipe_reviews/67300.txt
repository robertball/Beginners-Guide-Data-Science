WOW! This is delicious. It reminds me of home. I enjoyed this recipe very much. I have done it with the raw yolks and I have done it by cooking the yolks with the evaporated milk in a double-boiler then just blending the other ingredients in the blender, both ways are delicious. Try it, you wil agree!

I live in Puerto Rico and have enjoyed lots of traditional Coquito. This recipe was far too thin and milky for my taste, and though I like a good rum, there was a bit too much in this.

I have done this recipe twice and the second time used half the amount of eggs.  It was still great (and healthier).

This is good. But I don't add eggs.  I boil 3 cinnamon sticks in 2 cups water. Let cool. Put in blender w/ 1 can evaporated milk, 1 can condensed milk, 1 can coconut milk, 1 tsp vanilla extract, & Rum( I use Malibu Rum-coconut flavor). Serve on the rocks & garnish w/ground cinnamon.  Yummy!! All year round.

Wow, I found this to be REALLY watery.  Not thick at all like the coquito my husbands family makes.  If anyone has any ideas for thickening it up, I'd appreciate it!!

Que rico! This easy recipe is just as good as moms! Maybe better! And the Cruzan light rum is just the right kick.

This recipe was great!  I lived in Puerto Rico and thought it tasted similar to their version. I also like that I had all the ingredients on hand.  When I reduced the recipe to 8 servings, I also reduced the amount of rum since I used a dark Barbados rum.

I love love LOVE this recipe.  I can make it in a quarter of the time my mom and sister make the more traditional recipe.  I reduced the rum by 1 1/2 cups as it was a bit too strong for me.  I make it every year and get requests from friends at work to make them more.  I store it in clean wine bottles that I've sanitized with soap and hot water then run through the dishwasher.  It makes about 4 and a 1/2 bottles.

Based on wifey not wanting to drink eggs I had to change the recipe a little.  I kept the cans of cocunut milk, coconut creme, condensed and evaporated milk. I got some cinnamon sticks and boiled a cup of water waited until that cooled to add to the mix.  I also added about a 1/4 to a 1/2 cup of milk to lessen the sweetness a tad.  I also added nutmeg and only used a cap of vanilla extract.  The liquor of choice was courvoisier which the drink so smoooth.

I read about coquito on Daisy Martinez's website and decided i wanted to make it for my dad, who is Puerto Rican. So, i came to this website (which i'm on several times a day), and found this recipe. All i have to say is, delicious!!! My dad was impressed as were my sister and brother! The only thing i changed was the amount of rum, it just seemed like an awful lot to me and according to my dad, the rum taste should not over power the other flavors. It was great, much better then regular eggnog. This will now become a hoilday tradition in my home, thank you Giselle =)

This is so good and a refreshing step out of the ordinary. I didn't have that many cans of evaporated milk, so I used some whole milk instead, and it still turned out okay. And this recipe made a lot, so I can give some bottles away! YUM!

Good, but needs more cinnamon for my taste. Also for a pro tip, use a hand mixer and it will really make your drink uniform without the clumping.

I've never made Coquito before this, always bought it from locals. Living stateside makes one crave island food, drinks, and life. They say Crucians make the best Coquito so I'm glad I found your recipe. I made it Christmas Eve to serve Christmas Day and it was a hit!! Talk about delicious! I used less white rum (Coconut Cruzan) and I also used a little Dark rum. My rum was to taste. Didn't wanna overpower the other ingredients. I'm making it again... Thanks for this recipe! It truly is delightful!
