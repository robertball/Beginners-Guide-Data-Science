YUMMY! This is So simple! I JUST made these using cookies & cream ice cream (It's all I had & I really wanted to try this-it seemed way too easy!)and made my own self-rising flour using all purpose + 1 1/2 tsp baking powder & 1/2 tsp salt per 1 cup of flour. Only addition-I brushed beaten egg white on top and sprinkled sugar (what I normally do when I make scones)except 1 scone I left just as recipe says and the other I just brushed w/ egg white, no sugar. I liked the ones w/ sugar but the best looking was w/ JUST the egg white brushed on (w/o sugar). I only did half the recipe (I wasn't sure if it would turn out) & got 9 nice sized pie-slice shaped scones. Give it a try, its FUN and EASY and tastes WONDERFUL!

By far and away the easiest and the best recipe for scones I have found.  I prefer to make this with an ice cream that has more of a plain base flavor like just vanilla or just pumpkin and add in blueberries, fruit or nuts after I make the dough.  Tried making this the first time with an icecream that had a fruit ripple, but in mixing the ice cream with the flour it turned a really odd shade of pink because the ripple just disappeared.  Anyways it is really good topped with cinnamon and course sugar or an oatmeal crumb topping.  Very much worth your while.  Recipe itself is perfect as is.  Wouldn't change a thing!

This is really easy, and the dough is extremely sticky, but I have to say that every single scone recipe I've ever made has sticky dough.  That's just the way scones are.  I used my Kitchen Aid mixer and used the dough hook.  Although the dough did climb the hook, it was too sticky to act like regular dough, but I only added maybe 1/2 c more of flour since I expected the stickiness anyway.  I kind of expected these to be more scone-like than they are--they really remind me of sweeter biscuits.  Good, just not my vision of scones.  I used peach ice cream and then after placing on the cookie sheet I brushed with butter extract and sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar.  They aren't especially sweet and as other's noticed, the flavor is relatively mild, but scones (and biscuits) can be really good with jam or jelly, so I'm not worried about that part of it.   Especially as this is a recipe with only two ingredients, so I'm not sure what others were expecting.  I made my own self rising flour since I never have it on hand.  Use 1 1/2 tspoons baking powder and 1/2 tspoons salt per cup of flour.  Voila!  Self rising flour.  Not sure of all of the variations pple have come up on the reviews here; that's the recipe that I've always used, and it always works for me.  Thanks for the recipe; it used up some of my ice cream and was fun to try!

Easy to make, delicious, and fabulous presentation!!!
I made this recipe using Banana Split Ice Cream.  Dusted with powdered sugar and placed a half slice strawberry in the center.  The grand finale was drizzling (including the plate) with caramel sauce or chocolate sauce.
What a hit!!!

This turned out pretty well, despite not having self rising flour (instead I used 1 1/2 tablespoons of baking powder and 1/8 teaspoon of salt per cup of unbleached flower). It wasn't holding consistency very well so I added a little more flour. In addition, I added 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract, 1 cup of peanut butter, and about half a cup of chocolate chips. My roommates devoured them! Adding more flour made them take about 25 minutes or so in the oven (we also don't have a kitchen timer). Can't wait to try it with other ice creams!

I used vanilla ice cream, and they were wonderful!!!!  I don't quite know if I used enough ice cream, though, becuase I measured it before I melted it, and it was a little trick to get into the measuring cup from the bowl.  It was really sticky for me, so make sure you have plenty of flour on hand!!!

I had some peach ice cream on hand so thought I'd give this recipe a try.  The scones looked great but were very bitter.  I was out of self rising flour so added salt and baking soda (didn't realize until later I hadn't used powder.  I goofed this one up, so I'll give it another shot and follow directions next time :)

Shockingly bad results! The dough was VERY difficult to work with. They smelled delightful while they were cooking. The end result- did not taste AT ALL!  Really, no flavor whatsoever.

It was easy and fun to try, and although the scones rose nicely, I found the texture to be heavy and dense rather than light and flaky. Also, due to the amount of self-rising flour, the salt content is too high for me.

This is a great, easy recipe.  I made with all natural vanilla ice cream. It made a great base scone, and I can't wait to try different flavors or adding things like blueberries.

I didnt have self-rising flour so I added baking powder to all-purpose flour. The scones came out nice & I love the idea of using ice cream as the flavor base for these cute treats. Next time I'll use Cherry Vanilla Ice Cream or Birthday cake ice cream.!

I don't keep self rising flour on hand so I made my own out of whole wheat white flour, baking powder and salt. For the ice cream, I used Turkey Hill vanilla bean ice cream (imo, the best ice cream EVER.) These were easy enough but for me, I don't think it was enough ice cream. I think it needs a quarter cup or so more and maybe a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I think these would be good with a light glaze, too. Close, but not quite there for me.

This is a good recipe.  To make it even easier, I just mix the ingredients together and put it into a loaf pan and bake it for about 40 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.  I have used butter pecan and liked the results.  I am going to try vanilla next.  I find that the better (premium, maybe) ice creams yield a nicer bread.

Not good.  I made my own self rising flour as suggested by other reviewers and even though I used less salt than advised these were quite salty.  Flavor of the ice cream did not really come through either.  I added chocolate chips and that still did not help.  Will not make again, but love the idea.

I couldn't believe this would work, so I tried a half recipe. No self-rising flour, so used 1.5 tsp baking powder + 1 tsp salt per cup of flour. Also, rather than cutting it in circles (more dishes and time), I lightly rolled out one big circle, and cut it in 8 like a pizza for triangle-shaped scones.
It doesn't have the buttery-flakiness that I like (obviously b/c there's no butter...) but considering how ridiculously easy this is, these are great! Oh, I did add pecans and raisins - they might be boring without some sort of "extra."

These had absolutely zero flavor!  I would definitely not make these again!  Maybe it was the ice cream I used, but I tried it with butter pecan ice cream and I would think that would lend plenty of flavor...

This was amazing. The flavor was understated,as many reviewers mentioned. I used dulce de leche ice cream and barely tasted it. But scones don't usually have a strong flavor. I think you'd need to add some extra flavoring to pack a real punch.

These were a little sweet, but for the ease of the recipe and how we ate them up, I am giving them a five. Used inexpensive vanilla ice cream. would have been great with powdered sugar on them, but I id not make them to be sweet. maybe next time?

I JUST MADE A BATCH OF THESE AND THEY CAME OUT PRETTY DECENT. I DID ADD A FEW THINGS ONCE THE SCONES WERE COMPLETED. #1 I ADDED WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIPS TO THE DOUGH, AND #2 ONCE BAKED AND OUT OF THE OVEN AND COOLED DOWN I ADDED SOME WHITE CHOCOLATE AND MILK CHOCOLATE DRIZZLE ACROSS THE SCONES. THEY CAME OUT LOOKING LIKE SOMETHING U COULD PURCHASE FROM STARBUCKS!! YUM VERY SWEET, BUT VERY NICE PRESENTATION FOR GET TOGETHERS AND GOOD FOR DESSERT MAYBE WITH COFFEE. :)

It's an easy basic recipe if you just use vanilla ice cream. Much more interesting if you add fruit.

They were pretty good. I think it had a little too much flour in the dough and it wasn't turning out like it was supposed to. So I added a little dash of milk and it was ok. The scones came out a little flour-y tasting though. I think a little less flour and it could be great! All in all though it was a perfectly simple recipie.

So easy.  I had alot of fun playing with this recipe.  You can substitute chocolate yogert ice cream, and add toffee/chocolate heath chips to sweeten them up.  I can't wait to try this with my strawberry chocolate yogert ice cream!
