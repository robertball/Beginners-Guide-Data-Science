Wow!  What a great sauce.  It was easy to make and was absolutely wonderful.  I didn't have any ancho chili powder so I used Chipolte Chili Powder.  It carried a pretty big kick.  Ancho might not be as spicy so I would probably cut back a little of the chili powder if i were to use chipolte again.  I made to use with chicken tenders but decided to make into a spinach salad with tenders on the top and used the sauce as a dressing.  Awww...it was so good.  Used white corn and black beans as a side.   WTG cheffjeff

Great taste.  Looked everywhere for ground anco and couldn't find it (even in specialty markets) but substituted paprika and it worked.  I have some whole dried anchos that I'll grind up for next time when I have more time.

This tasted very sharp to me, so I had to thin it out with Ranch dressing, and then it was WONDERFUL as a sauce for sweet potato fries! Thanks for the recipe!

This a great sauce, versatile as a salad dressing or dipping sauce.

I used as dressing for salad, and as a dip for mushrooms and bread.  Straight up delicious.

Truly a sweet-meets-heat item.  The chipotle powder gives it a great smokiness and heat, balanced by the sweetness of the honey.  It took three days to use up the sauce, and the heat definitely increased each day--which is great since I enjoy food with a kick.

One of the best things about this is you can distinctly tell as a dressing this is fresh--the taste is absent the distinct flavor of preservatives and artificial components of commercially made dressings.  Awesome.  

Super easy to make.  5 minutes tops, and you have a natural and low-calorie dressing with great flavor...

I've never been a fan of honey mustard, but adding the chili powder was great. I served this with a baked chicken nugget recipe on this site too. Great match.

I gave this 4 stars only because I had to alter it. I used only half the amount of chili powder and garlic powder and only had white vinegar. But my husband and I both agree that it is still very very yummy and so easy to make. Two thumbs up!

I love sauces and dips that are flavorful and versatile! I used this sauce to accompany the Chicken Nut Puffs appetizer and it was delicious! This sauce also freezes well, so I just take it down the night before I need it and serve it with our appetizers. Great recipe!

Delicious! Sweet and a little spicy and a nice tang to liven it up even more. I love this sauce! I used it for dipping roasted cauliflower (which has a texture kind of like chicken nuggets) into, and it was excellent. I look forward to baking some chicken in this sauce in the next few days as well. It's a great sauce, and I never would have thought to put chile powder into my honey mustard otherwise.

Quick, easy & tastes great. Used this sauce on chicken nuggets & will use on ham also. Don't need to change a thing. We used to make a honey mustard sauce, but this has just a nice zing.

This was Absolutely wonderful.  I didn't make any changes except that I used regular vinegar.  Fabulous anyway.

Absolutely delicious! Made this to go along with some ham, but also had a salad on the same plate.  I found myself mixing the salad in this sauce.  I used an extra sprinkle of ancho to spice up a bit.  Definitely recommend, very easy to make :)

I didn't have honey or rice wine vinegar in the house so replaced with maple syrup and red wine vinegar and it was still a tasty off-the-cuff dipping sauce.

This sauce is easy and quick to make.  It has an attractive look when it is on the plate.  It is delicious also, especially with pork.  Any time, I tell my family we are having pork they always ask if there is the sauce with it.

This is a very good sauce. What sets it apart from other honey-mustard sauces is the Ancho chili powder.
Ancho chilies have a very low heat level, but have a very unique chili flavor. Highly recommended!

We initially made this for a baked chicken recipe; just poured it over the top of the chicken and baked it.  It was great!  I always make extra sauce, with anything, so we had lots left over.  It makes the BEST salad dressing!!!  And, because of the ingredients, it stores in the fridge, for quite a while.  Wish I could bottle this!  :)

Great idea, but way too much ancho pepper for my taste, even for meats.  Would use 3/4 as much for ham, etc. and perhaps 1/4-1/2 if for use as a salad dressing (which I tried full strength, and wow-ee!)  Recommended making with less, tasting, then adjusting for your own preference.
