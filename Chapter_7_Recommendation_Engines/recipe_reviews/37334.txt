What a terrific recipe. I used a 2 lb london broil, and turned the meat a few times over the 24 hours. With grilling season approaching, this is a great addition to my list bbq ideas. I am not much a red meat eater, and even I went back for seconds. My husband, a dedicated red meat eater, was thrilled. and even my children, 2 and 5, loved it. Next time I may try adding a clove of crushed garlic...just because I love garlic. Definately a repeater. Thank you Joel!

I really liked this.  I did reduce the W. sauce to half...(just not big on the steak sauce taste.)  Thank you for the post.

For all the yummy ingredients in this recipe, we were very surprised to find the prominent taste was that of the steak sauce.  I wouldn't make this recipe again.  Sorry!

This recipe is delicious! Pretty easy to make and, not counting the marinating time, quick to make. The sauce is wonderful! We thought about not using the marinade for the sauce since the steaks had a nice flavor from marinating, but we are very glad we took the time to make the accompanying sauce. We didn't notice a steak sauce flavor to the sauce at all. We could mainly taste the wine and the stout (we used Guinness Stout and a red Zinfadel for the wine), but it was a pleasant taste...not overpowering. Thanks for the excellent recipe! It's definitely a keeper!

Wish I had checked reviews before ruining my son's birthday steaks with this stinker. Tasted nothing but wine and steak sauce, and even though I used good rib-eyes and t-bones, steaks were chewy. So disappointing, I wouldn't even know what to change to make improvements.

YUM YUM YUM!  I used a london broil steak, and this was fabulous.  In the future, I will add garlic and more salt and pepper.  Broiled beautifully.  I am giving this a 4 though--we were not huge fans of the sauce.  Will stick with A1, if any is used at all.

Yuck!  We may have done something wrong with this but the taste was awful; very bitter.

Sorry but I didn't think this was that great. Perhaps it was my cut of meat -- I used bone-in ribeyes. While the flavor was fine, the ribeyes were not tender. I missed the taste of salt and pepper too. I used Smith and Wolensky Steak Sauce and added minced fresh garlic to the marinade. My husband thought it was better.

Disappointed with this recipe.  The prominent taste was the w. sauce and the red wine.  Overall the taste combination was very different - it was not awful, but we did not care for it.

I'm an avid griller and always looking for different tastes. Unfortunately with this recipe the stout was over powering and gave a bitter taste. Depending on the brand of steak sauce will really make a difference. Good for tenderizing, but a flop on taste.

I added a tsp of sugar to try to cut the steak sauce "vinegary-ness" but still the sauce was too much. The new york steaks were tender and tasty, but did not use the sauce otherwise.

It was just ok.  I cooked this for myself and 4 guys who love steak and guinness.  Not sure what went wrong with it, but it just wasn't that tasty.  Followed the recommened cooking times and the steaks were raw, not rare or medium, but raw.  Tasted a lot of the steak sauce, and not much of anything else.  Probably won't make this one again.

I would suggest if anyone wants to try this add some brown sugar to cut the bitter taste and a little garlic might help also.
