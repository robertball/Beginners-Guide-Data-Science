Run, do not walk and make this very easy and delicious dish. Only change I made was to use frozen pearl onions and maybe a bit more S&P

Flavorful and hearty with mashed potatoes.  I liked it more with garlic powder sprinkled on top.  Next time I would throw small whole mushrooms in to cook the last 15 minutes.

Very good.  I used low-sodium chicken broth, but substituted marinated artichokes for frozen, and fresh cippolini onions for frozen pearls. Next time I'll eliminate the added salt and dilute the stock a little so it's not as salty.  I served with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Hubby proclaimed it one of his favorite dishes.

This did not go over well. Nothing seemed to marry well for anyone in the family.
