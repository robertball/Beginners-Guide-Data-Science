This recipe was really good. I did not use celery because I dont liek "cooked" celery. But other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out really good. I served this as main dish with some side salad and it was gone in minutes. Thank you.

This recipe was delicious!  The only substitution I did was to use dried cranberries in place of raisins, because that's what I had in the pantry.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a great quinoa recipe, and simple to prepare. I loved it!!! It is an easy recipe to add or subtract ingredients according to your likes and dislikes. 

I didn't have raisins so skipped those. I could tell by the seasonings amounts that I would want more so I upped them to 1/2 tsp each except the salt. Probably could use even more. I didn't even add salt except with the quinoa and will decrease the salt the next time I make this. I decreased the olive oil to 1 tablespoon and that was plenty. I am trying to add more G-Bomb veggies to my diet, so I added some fresh spinach and mushrooms!! I recommend adding more tomatoes. I think this recipe definitely needs something green to make it look more appealing. The spinach did the trick!  I will surely be making this again. Thanks Ann for a great recipe!!!

This is outstanding.  The suggested serving of 3 will easily serve 4 as a side dish.  I also added craisins for color instead of the tomato.  Had some zucchini and broccoli that I chopped up and added.  Will keep this one in my recipe box-mmmm!

I am in love. Thanks
I had never tried Quinoa before, so this was my introduction. I followed the recipe exactly. Even my husband a conservative eater liked it. Good thing to because I would have divorced him and married the Quinoa. - Belinda Wood

This recipe was so delicious! My husband, who has disliked every quinoa recipe I've ever tried, went back for seconds and was sad that there were no leftovers! Looking forward to making it again.

I make this all the time and use it to introduce quinoa to people who have never tried it before. Everyone likes it and I get lost of requests for the recipe.

Even though this recipe just has a few spices, it was extremely flavorful.  This recipe stores well and is delicious hot or cold.

Lovely lunch dish, you can increase the flavor by using broth to cook the quinoa instead of water. I made enough for three servings and after having it the first day added some lemon juice to complement the thyme. A good recipe to add/subtract ingredients based on what you have on hand, but it is also very tasty just as written. Thanks for sharing!

I substituted pineapple juice for half the water and it lent a more "tropical" taste to the dish.  I made it with salmon, which I usually cook in either orange or pineapple juice, and it made a nice pairing.

This is the first time I have tried making quinoa.  My husband (tentatively) tasted it so I was pleasantly surprised when he said it "was different" but he did finish it.  He's not a raisin fan so next time I may decrease the amount.

I liked it enough to bring as a side dish to our next pot luck.  Yay!!!

3 will serve 6.  This makes a lot.  Also, for more flavor, substitute the water that cooks the quinoa will either all or a portion of a flavorful stock (chicken, beef or veg).  Maybe use chicken stock if serving with chicken (etc.).  I also had to double the garlic, oregano and thyme for more flavor.  Finally, the overall dish a bit dry, so just prior to serving I spooned a little of our basting liquid from our roast chicken.  Delicious and tied the entire dish together with the meal.

Made it tonight for dinner. I didn't have any tomato so I used red pepper and sauteed it with the other vegetables. Craisins were added and deleted the raisins. It added a nice color and taste. LOVE this recipe! Will definitely make it again and again

This is a wonderful recipe. I cooked my quinoa in the rice cooker, done so quickly, just like Ann said. While the quinoa cooked, I sliced and diced and cooked up the other ingredients. I added the diced tomatoes just before mixing all together. They maintained their firmness this way. I will definitely keep this recipe on hand.

Very good a little time consuming to make so would be more of a weekend type of recipe.  Nice and healthly dish.  We had it with salmon fish cakes on this side and was an excellent combo.

I really liked this and will use the recipe again.  However if you aren't a fan of black pepper, you may find 1/8 t. too much.  Next time, I'll add only a dash of pepper.

I really liked this recipe. My husband said it wasn't his favorite. Hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I always follow the recipe to a "T" so I have no changes.

Really good! I browned the onions and some julienne carrots first, though, and then threw in other veggies to cook more. If you ask me, without browning the carrots ans onions, it's not pilaf. But the raisins and almonds were just right; thank you! :)

One of the best quinoa dishes I've tried. I did cook the quinoa in chicken broth instead of water (something I always do because it adds so much flavor) and I used dried cherries because that's what I had in my pantry.  Other than those two substitutions, I followed the recipe exactly. It's a great combination of flavors.

This was the first recipe I made using quinoa. I have since tried others but this is the best. I make it all of the time pretty much as written though this time I used curry powder instead of thyme with the oregano and I thought it went well with the other ingredients.

I am just beginning to learn to cook with quinoa, but this recipe was very easy and very good. I tend to be liberal with the oil when I cook onions and too much oil produced a bit of a mess with the final product.

I  loved this recipe. I used chicken broth for 3/4 cup of the liquid. The raisins were hardly noticeable, but left a sweet  not so make sure to add them.

Made exactly as written. Would reduce the amount of oil for cooking veggies next time. Would add mushrooms and substitute sun-dried tomatoes for fresh. I think this was a tasty basic recipe for quinoa and is easily adapted to different tastes.

This was my first time making quinoa, and I really enjoyed this recipe!  I will probably use less olive oil next time, other then that I loved the flavors!
