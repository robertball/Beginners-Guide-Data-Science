I loved this. It was so yummy and everyone loved it. I only changed a few things, I added more veggies like asparagus and chopped tomatoes and a little cheese just before serving. My boyfriend ate so much and we ended up having just enough left overs, which was fine with us because it tasted so good and took it to work. Our friends came over and tried it right out of the fridge the next day and ended up eating the rest! I'm making it again tomorrow!

Delicious!  And it tastes great reheated the next day.  My boyfriend made this for me last night and it was better than any meal I've had in a restaurant in ages.  Plus, it's very comforting on a cold rainy night.

A really good starting point, and it produces a fine dish. My swing on the recipe is to season it with a bit of Old Bay--just enough to feel that it's there, but not so much as to make it an Old Bay dish.  For seafood, I skip the salmon,and use a dozen medium (26-31-count) peeled and deveined shrimp, a dozen sea scallops, and 1/2 cup lump crab meat.  Also, instead of water, I make my own stock by simmering for 20  minutes the shrimp shells, a teaspoon celery salt,and the top leaves from a bunch of celery.  Basil is good, but I think thyme is better for this dish.  Finally, plate the risotto, sprinkle the tops with good Parmesan cheese and place the plates under the broiler until the edges just begin to brown.

Very good!  i would add a little more salmon and/or clams to make it more seafood tasty.  I also added spinach which made it a little healthier.  An option would be to add some tomatoes too.

This was a good recipe with the twists my hubby and I made.  The trick is to use really good stock. We used chicken stock instead of water, and used this to cook 15 fresh clams in their shell, along with the shells from about 10 prawns. We then removed and discarded the shells and added the cooked clams to the canned clams and poured the liquid from the canned clams into the stock.  We substituted the saffron and basil for 1 tsp of Old Bay seasoning. We added 2 c. chopped spinach and substituted salmon for 10 prawns and 10 scallops. We added these along with 1 cup grated fresh parmesan cheese with the clams when the risotto was almost ready.   Belissimo!

We thought it needed a little more zip and minced 1/4 green pepper with the onion.

Loved it!  We added a bunch of asparagus and diced a fresh tomato (about 1 pound) then sprinkled with shaved parmesan just before serving.  Divine!

Made this for a special "date night" dinner.  We both loved it.  My husband said, "Well you're gonna have to make this again".  Actually he is making it this weekend for Mother's Day for me.  I used shrimp instead of clams since he doesn't like them and added a few sprinkles of crab & shrimp seasoning since most people said it was missing something.  It had a nice little kick in the back of the throat. Can't wait for Sunday!!

Well, I enjoyed this but made a few changes... I used calamari and shrimp rather than salmon and clams.  Also I never use chicken stock so substituted vegetable broth and it was a bit bland so I topped it off with some grated Parmesan. My husband liked it a lot but I felt like it needed some vegetables like cherry tomatoes or celery added. Over all it was quick and easy and tasted ok so will def make it again.

Needs more clams and less salmon. Bland, needs salt and pepper.  If I make it again I'm thinking ill add celery, carrots, mushrooms and no salmon.

used seafood stock and water and reserved clam juice from clams.
only used clams
Rice needed to be thickened at end.  Don't use cheese, didn't want cream.  Used 3T butter. perfect.
Jeff and Lu loved, Ted not Nick liked it.  I thought it was pretty good.

Turned out Fantastic!  Very easy to make.  Took the stress out of making Risotto! I added cooked peeled shrimp, frozen peas, and 1 t chopped garlic to the recipe.  Will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe exactly and I must say that the end result was very good, but there is something that keeps it from being great. I can't pinpoint what it is, but will try some variations to make it just right. Thanks for the recipe.

As written, this was a bit bland. I tasted it before I served it, and quickly added some frozen peas and a fair amount of freshly grated Parmesan cheese, and that helped a lot.

Great dish. To make it healthier I used olive oil instead of butter. Substituted salmon with 1 lb shrimps and added 1/2 green pepper with onion and one tomato when onion and pepper were almost cooked. Next time will try a bit more wine (1 cup?) and cut down on water to avoid soupiness.

I substituted shrimp for the salmon and I also added some fresh steamed mussels as well. I did 1/2 clam juice, 1/2 chicken stock because I didn't want to overwhelm the dish with the clam juice and I feel that it was a perfect choice. Delish!

Very good. Since I'm not a fan of clams I used chicken broth, crabmeat and scallops (which were cooked in wine and garlic).  I also added in chopped green peppers and topped with asparagus, diced tomatoes and shredded parmesan.  Next time I'll use shrimp in place of crabmeat.

I made this risotto for my husband on our one month wedding anniversary and he loved it. It came out perfectly, and was very tasty.
