Yum! This is a great, simple oatmeal. I scaled the recipe down to serve one, and made these substitutions... I used applesauce instead of juice, added a pinch of nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon, added blueberries (at the time I added oats to the pot), and used vanilla hemp milk instead of dairy milk. I also added a Tbsp. of ground flaxseed after putting it in my bowl, and sprinkled with walnuts. SO GOOD! (Now that I think about it, I guess I made a lot of changes to the original recipe, but it was a great starting off point & just delicious!) :)

Great for breakfast! Like others, I used applesauce instead of apple juice. I added some cinnamon and nutmeg as well. I didn't top mine with milk I topped it with a dollup of fat free vanilla yogurt.

This was an amazing recipe and just so easy!
No hassle for eggs or butter .etc
I, and my whole family enjoyed this delicious snack.
Instead of using apple juice or store bought apple sauce,
I cut up a couple chunks of another apple
and threw it in the blender - homemade applesauce!
Also, i do recommend you add some sort of sweetening agent
I popped in 1/4 cup of brown sugar
and at the end, I put in as much milk as I thought i needed - just eye it.

I've made this recipe three times. The first time I made it without the apples and added apple sauce instead of apple juice (I like a thick oatmeal not runny so less juice sounded good). The recipe was alright not very flavorful, and very runny. The second time I made the recipe and followed it to a T. I didn't like it though, I found it bland and it tasted more like cinnamon soup than oatmeal. Despite my disappointment and failed attempts in making an apple cinnamon oatmeal recipe that actually tasted good on a cold fall morning.

Not ready to given to defeat I pioneered into my kitchen this morning to try one more time. I found success!! Well, there are still some more tweaks but it is far better and more flavorful. Not mention it actually tasted like a hardy oatmeal instead of oatmeal cinnamon soup. Instead of apple juice I used apple sauce, I used a granny apple (delicious)! I used 1 & 1/4 cup rolled oats. Added two teaspoons ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. ground ginger, 1 pinch cloves, 1 pinch nutmeg, and 1 cup milk. I added the milk at the end of cooking to let it warm up and sweeten the oatmeal. I also added 1/4 cup brown sugar while cooking the apples. 

This recipe is much better and far more flavorful. Very spicey but I love that in my oatmeal. It hit the spot on a cold fall morning.

The apple flavor is very mild. I think next time I would increase the apple juice and decrease the water. I added a generous dash (just less than 1/8 tsp)of salt to the water. Since I was using quick cooking oats I let the apples cook in the liquid for 2 minutes before adding the quick oats and continued to cook for one more minute. I like my oatmeal on the sweet side so I sprinkled sugar over it before eating. I would probably make this again, but with the changes.

Very Yummy!! And healthy too. I added applesauce instead of the juice because I didn't have any on hand. It turned out delicious.

This has found its place in my breakfast rotation. No more packet oatmeal for me! I skip the milk (lactose intolerant). Refrigerate half and microwave it for breakfast the next day it's still good.

I used applesauce in place of apple juice and add flax seeds. Turned out yummy but still lacking something? Needs more flavor but not sure from what ingredient...

Pretty good! I used apple sauce instead of apple juice since I didn't have any juice on hand. I like chunks, so I kept my apples pretty big. I used a new variety from Safeway - honeycrisp - but my husband said he'd prefer something even sweeter (golden delicious?). We both added brown sugar at the end... Pretty easy to make and a fun way to start the day!

Just by reading the recipe I knew that cooking it with water would make it very bland. I used 1 cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk in place of the water and 1/3 cup of apple cider in place of 1/4 cup juice. I also stirred in 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. I kept the cinnamon at 1 teaspoon, but didn't pour milk over the oatmeal. I thought it turned out good, but felt it still needed just a bit more flavor. Next time I'm going to use equal parts almond milk and apple cider and see if that helps.

Just didn't care for this.  Definitely needed to be sweetened a bit, so I added some sugar, but that still wasn't enough.  In all fairness, could be that our standard has become the packet stuff, since I haven't eaten freshly-cooked oatmeal since I was a kid.

Definitely needed sugar... I doubled the recipe and added 1/4 cup brown sugar, and added some flax seeds. I like it as is but my son will need more brown sugar when I nuke the leftovers for him in the morning. I at least quadrupled the cinnamon, too. This is exactly what I was craving only sweeter and cinnamon-y-er - thanks for making a pregnant girl happy at 11 at night!

I made this mostly because my son has the instant nearly every day so I thought he'd like this but he didn't care for it.  I thought it was good, but I don't have it as often as he does. I'd give it 4, he'd give it 2 so I'm settling on 3 stars.  It was easy to make, but I just don't know what I could do to improve it for my son to like it better. I always look for homemade versions of stuff they have regularly but this just didn't work for us, I'm sorry.

This is a fantastic, delicious and healthy breakfast. I too used apple sauce instead of juice. My husband loves sweets and given the choice of pancakes, french toast, or this recipe, he said he wanted the apple oatmeal.

Great recipe, I used the apple juice for the recommended amount of water and water for the recommended amount of apple juice, and I initially cooked the apples  in the apple juice, water, cinnamon and I added 2 tablespoon of brown sugar. Then in a separate pan I began cooking the oatmeal with 1/2  cup of milk then added the apples and juice from the pan to the oatmeal

This oatmeal made a very tasty and nutritious breakfast. I didn't have any apple juice, so I just used more water and added a little brown sugar and some raisins to make it sweeter. I also added a teaspoon of flax seeds, because I love them in my oatmeal and they are so good for you! This recipe is very good, and I will be making it often. Thanks!

This was delicous! I used apple sauce instead of juice, added walnuts and a pinch of nutmeg. My brother added sugar(always the sweet type). It was so fast and yummy. I made it the night before because i have to get up early for school. It looks really kinda gross but just dont look at it. It is sooooo good!!!!

This just didn't have enough ... umph ... for me.  I would suggest adding more cinnamon and maybe some nutmeg. I didn't use any milk either... just don't like the idea of cold milk over hot oatmeal. Otherwise, a great basic recipe.

Apples were mushy and bland, Way too much cinnamon- my tongue is numb from all of the cinnamon... Forced my 4 kids to eat it... Definitely not sweet enough either, even after adding brown sugar... just not good... won't be making this again.

This was good, but not great. Even with the addition of brown sugar, which about half the reviews suggest to add, it was not wonderful. I enjoyed it, but none of the three kids cared for it.

With all due respect, what is the big secret about oatmeal?? If you don't find it fun, put in some peaches, or apple sauce, or more sugar, or some maple syrup.  There must be something more exciting.!!

This was absolutely delicious. I also added nuts because I put nuts in just about everything. I used apple sauce because I had no juice and added  orange juice to the water. OJ gives it a tangy flavor and I add honey to the finished product. I will try this next with peaches instead of apples. It has sooo many possibilities

This was a great starter base for flavored oatmeal. I added in a pinch of salt and some sugar too at the end. The apples needed to cook much longer and we added butter and a splash of vanilla at the table. As written this was fine, but it did benefit from the added ingredients. The servings were on the small side and if you have a hungry eater or a Hungry Teen you'll need to increase this.

I didn't really like it. It needed some more flavor and sweetness. So I wouldn't try this again.

A little bland, I made it with yellow apples and applesauce, perhaps that was why, but i will try it again since its def a healthy staple.

This is really good. I am on a diet to lose weight and this recipe is great to get you started in the morning. I substituted simply apple juice for regular apple juice I can't have processed sugar(allergic). I also added nutmeg and used more juice and less water to give it a little more flavor. I have had a hard time with the bland options out there for healthy breakfast foods and this one made my day! I can eat healthy and it tastes good too!

I had steel cut oatmeal that I cooked, not rolled oats. When the oatmeal was done I added some finely diced fuji apples to the oatmeal (I like the crunch), then a little apple juice to make the oatmeal more soft and add flavor. I topped it off with a 1/4 cup of mott's cinnamon applesauce and to that I added a light sprinkle of light brown sugar and a little soy milk and stirred. I was delighted with this lovely apple flavored oatmeal with a hint of cinnamon. This was tasty and no doubt healthy. The fuji apples gives this a light sweetness and nice texture, which I appreciated, nothing overpowering or "tart". I would have given this a 5 stars but because I didn't cook the apples in apple juce and instead finely diced them into my oatmeal it is a 4 stars. This will be part of my breakfast menu rotation!

I made this oatmeal for breakfast today and served it to my dad and sister.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, adding a little nutmeg with the cinnamon.  It was alright, but could use a little tweaking.  My dad suggested salt and I think I would use less liquid next time and cover the sliced apples with cinnamon and nutmeg, before boiling them in the liquid.  I tried topping the oatmeal with white sugar, but it still tasted pretty bland, so then I tried brown sugar and it turned out delicious.  I will keep trying and experimenting.  This is a great start.

We changed it up cause for some reason I bought the wrong ingrediants.  Applesauce not apples.  Not very good that way.  Will keep trying with this recipe cause it has such good potential.

Yum, yum, YUM. I added a little nutmeg and brown sugar. Even my kids loved it. Very filling and so yum.
I always float milk or cream on the top because that's how I grew up eating it.

It was a perfect breakfast for a couple snowed in for the day. My husband has never had "real" oatmeal, just the instant kind, but he loved this. I used more apple juice and less water, and otherwise prepared it exactly as written.

Too many apples, not enough oatmeal.  Also, a little bland.  Could use a pinch of salt, and/or some brown sugar.

Loved it! Added some raisins to it too. Btw Bobbie Jean, you need the water for the oatmeal so you can cook it. If there's not a lot of water then your oatmeal will burn! Won't want that. :) Maybe add more apples?

The first time I made this, I made it to the T (eyeballing the cinnamon) but cutting it in half for one person. It was alright, not great, so the second time around I made a few changes. I'm generally not a fan of the taste of oatmeal cooked with water, just a taste preference. I also didn't think it was "apply" enough or sweet enough. So the second time, instead of water, I used milk with the apple juice and I increased the amount of apple juice. I threw in the apples AND the cinnamon so that they could all simmer together. I added a touch of brown sugar at the end. The brown sugar might have made it a bit too sweet so I'll try it without the sugar next time. I found my changes made the oatmeal creamier and sweeter, and now I think I've added a new recipe to my breakfast menu! :)

It was good if you added your own sugar, and I think some of the ingredients were unnecessary or made no difference.

Pretty good, but the flavor seemed just a little bland, so I added raisins, more cinnamon, and a little bit of salt.  The salt & raisins really seemed to help.  Definitely will make it again!

I made 4 servings, I used 1 1/4 c apple juice and 1 1/4 c water, 1 1/3 cups rolled oats, 2 apples and 1 tsp cinnamon, when it was done cooking I added 1/2 c coffee cream and 4 tsps brown sugar. My sons really enjoyed the change from plain oatmeal, great way to start the day when it is so cold out!

This was very easy to make. My younger kids loved it, but the older kids are use to the super sweet instant oatmeal packets. I myself had to add a little more sugar, but I did love the chunks of apple. Have made it a few times now.

I read all the reviews and did a little tweaking to the recipe.  Instead of 1 cup of water and 1/4 cup of apple juice, I did a cup of apple cider (it's what I had on hand) and a 1/4 cup of water. I also added a pinch of nutmeg, a sprinkling of brown sugar as we like our oatmeal sweet, and omitted the milk (didn't really need more liquid).  It was so good.  Thanks for the starter recipe.

I didn't have apple juice so I just added sugar. Still, it tastes delicious and is much cheaper than buying from the store. I used granny smith apples for a nice tartness too.

This was a really yummy breakfast! I did make a few changes tho. I made it for 1, and used 1 very small apple (as aposed to half), added raisins, didn't use any apple juice, and topped with crushed walnuts and honey (coz I'm a sweet tooth and had no apple juice). It was great! Would make agin :)

This was very good. I added the milk while cooking instead of adding it at the end. It took longer to cook, which was fine. I also added brown sugar and raisins. We love it.

Personally, I thought this was a little watery.  HOWEVER, my picky two and three year olds devoured it and asked for more.  I made a little oatmeal buffet and let them put in what they wanted (brown sugar, chopped nuts, dried fruit).  The only sub I made was to use pomagranate juice b/c its all I had.  Next time, I'll try using apple sauce instead of all the water.

I thought that this recipe was very bland. I would have decreased the amount of water and added more apple juice. I ended up adding some brown sugar to it at the end and increasing the amount of cinnamon.

I like the hearty option of oatmeal for breakfast but grow tired of the same old.  I liked this option but it was bland without any salt, needs a pinch.  I used rolled oats so increased cooking time was necessary as well.

I am not an oatmeal fan, but due to falling temps I thought to give this a try as it sounded nice. I was not disappointed! It was yummy! Deff a keeper. As I am "glutenfree" I used millet flakes instead of oats! Thank you Dougsmami

It was not so impressive. It didn't give me the taste I expected. A healthy choice though. Will do a bit of experiment on this recipe with some adjustments to suit my taste. Thanks.

This is definately going to become one of my regular recipes! Gorgeaus! I used 1/2 the amount of milk you suggested, and i added 1 teaspoon of golden syrup per bowl, to sweeten it up a bit.

This recipe was flavourless. After tasting the oatmeal i had to add lots of brown sugar just to taste anything. I also added another 1/2 cup of apple juice for any apple flavour.

This is an excellent oatmeal recipe. I was looking for one that I could make for our 10 month old twins. I used 2 gala apples instead of 1 and I blended it to a chunky consistency  and added about 1/2 a cup of apple juice  to reduce the thickness. Our babies are very picky eaters and both ate this without hesitation. It was delicious! Definitely great for babies, children and adults and VERY EASY TO MAKE! Enjoy!

After reading some of the reviews, I decided to try this recipe for brunch with my mother. I substituted apple juice for the water, and then apple sauce for the actual juice in the recipe. I also added a pinch of nutmeg. Served with a pat of butter, and some brown sugar on the side. 

I thought it was "ok" - very flavorful, but really just not my thing. Apple flavored oatmeal was something new. My mother however, raved about it and loved the texture and flavors.

This was really good but I did read reviews and decided to personalize mine.  In place of 1/3 of the water I used Vanilla Almond milk.  I did the applesauce substitution for the apple juice also andI added 1/4 cup coconut sugar to sweeten since the applesauce was unsweetened, along with raisins. It was not soupy but thick and satisfying this way.  Great to make ahead and warm up for a quick breakfast at my desk at work.

I just made this for breakfast and my daughter and I liked it.  The only change I made was to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract while cooking the apples and 2 teaspoons of maple syrup after adding the oatmeal.  I think the next time I make it,  I will use all apple juice/cider instead of the water and omit the maple syrup as I think the maple syrup would make it too sweet with the apple juice/cider.  I will definitely make this again!

I made this for one, and made a few changes: shredded half a honeycrisp apple with a box grater.  I didn't have apple juice, so I subbed unsweetened cranberry juice.  I covered while simmering, so I had extra liquid--soaked that up with dried cranberries (around 2 TBSP), pea protein powder (about 1/2 TBSP), and chia seeds (1 tsp).  SO tasty and fast!  I don't use any kind of milk, so I skipped that and never missed it.

I followed the recipe and it's more like soup. I only added 1/4 cup of milk. I was planning to add one cup but seeing how it looked with 1/4 cup, I decided one cup would be horrible. The flavor isn't great, I'd like more apple flavor. It's very bland.

I used a Granny Smith apple, added some cranraisins, honey and a dash of nutmeg.  I didn't have applesauce. This was so satisfying and delicious. Four stars for original recipe; some kind of sweetener is a must. I can't imagine apple juice would be enough.

I didn't like it.  the apples lost a lot of their flavour boiling with the water and as a result the oats had almost no flavour at the end.

I love oatmeal and eat it all the time, so adding a chopped apple is a great way to get that daily quota of fruit! I didn't have apple juice so I just added extra water. Knowing what apple juice can add to oatmeal, I kind of missed the extra flavour, my fault, but I enjoyed it just the same. I topped it with a bit of half & half instead of milk and just a smidge of pure maple syrup.

Cooked apples a bit first, used 1/2 milk and 1/2 water but the milk wanted to curdle. Doubled recipe and added 1/3 c brown sugar and pinch of salt. Added a few walnuts

Came out very bland but the apples came out perfectly cooked. I added brown sugar and some salt and that helped some. Next time I'm going to add brown sugar when I add the cinnamon or maybe more apple juice and less water.

A lovely fall breakfast. I added 1/2 cup applesauce, as I had no apple juice. Over the course of cooking I added significantly more water, probably close to 2 cups. I also added about 3bsp honey as it was bitter, and I added nutmeg and a pinch of salt. Delicious!

I make this for breakfast and once a month for dinner, my kids love it so much and I love that its filling and healthy. Sometimes when I don't have apple syrup around I just use maple syrup to sweeten it and it comes out great. I also like to hide cut - up dates, ground almonds and wheat germ to sneak in more vitamins.

I took the skins off of the apple, used blueberry applesauce (I didn't have apple juice or plain applesauce), added some cloves (I love the spice with apples it's so yummy), I added some brown sugar once it was in the bowl because I didn't find it very sweet (maybe because I used Granny Smith which tend to be more tart than sweet) & I left out the milk. it turned out very good! will make again

I enjoyed this recipe but the changes I would make are a full cup of oats and either skip the milk at the end or use less water in the beginning. With the current sizes, it became less like oatmeal and more like apple soup that had some oats in it.

I made this minus the apple juice (only because I didnt have) and added a 1/2 cup brown sugar. This was super delicious! I think next time I will make sure to have apple juice on hand to give this an extra punch of flavor.

Very nice recipe!  This was WAY better than the last one I tried.  I did alter it a bit, but nothing crazy.  I upped it to a 3 serving size as its a great amount to make for my daughter (toddler) for the work week.  Instead of using the apple juice or applesauce as some reviewers did, I cored an apple and threw it in the Nutribullet with the required water.  I also simmered the apples in it for about 3 minutes before adding the oats.  Next time I make this, which I definitely will, I'll also add about 1T brown sugar to my simmering apples.  This tastes great and I can feel good about giving it to my little one =)  
Thanks for sharing!

Made it as is, with the exception of additional cinnamon. It ended up being too thin in my opinion. I think that next time, I will use half the milk and add it while the oatmeal is still on the stove, to also prevent it from cooling down too much. Very yummy though, excited to try it again.

I replaced water with juice and also added nutmeg. Even so, this was a very bland recipe. If I make it in the future I will definitely try to mix it up.

I thought this was descent. It is much better than anything I have ever tasted from a flavored packet of oatmeal too. It's quick to make also. To add a little flavor, which it did need some, I added to my bowl a couple small pinches of brown sugar, a small drop of vanilla, and a quick dash of salt.

I did try this recipe with two small apples and used apple sauce instead of the juice.  I was disappointed in the end.  I did end up adding just a little of raw sugar to get the sweetness I was looking for, but only a little. I will make it again with the small amount of sugar simply to avoid unhealthy oatmeal options.

i really wanted to love this but felt it lacked something. it came out a tangy; almost bitter flavor. i did put some flax seed which was fine. next time i'll add some brown sugar and/or honey to give it a little bit of the missing sweetness it needed and see if it enhances not only the taste but rating.

not quite what i had expected. it defenitely needs some sweetness. i added about 2 tablespoons brown sugar and about 1 tablespoon white sugar. i also added the flax seeds to make it a bit more healthy. it has a very good apple flavor, i used granny smith apples and motts unfiltered apple juice.

I made this for the first time yesterday. I think next time I'll choose a sweeter apple and peel it. I didn't add any sugar or syrup but I think it would taste better with one of the two... and maybe some nutmeg and walnuts. Overall it's a good basic recipe that you can easily add things to depending on what you like.

We didn't enjoy this as much as thought we might. It was pleasant but not worth the bother. My husband likes the way I regularly cook Oatmeal: (serves one) 1/2 c. oatmeal, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 c. raisins, 1/2 tsp salt, 1-1/8 c. water in covered dish.  Cook on high in microwave, stir; cook two minutes more and serve.

I love this oatmeal. It's healthy, delicious and simple. I always add a little something to sweeten - either some splenda or stevia - and then I throw some toasted walnuts on top for extra crunch. If I don't have apple juice available I use applesauce or even apple cider. Definitely a regular go-to breakfast.

This was the first time making homemade oatmeal and I really liked it even my mom liked it and she doesn't normally like oatmeal. I used quick cooking oats and  2 small golden delicious apples and I left the skin on and in nice size chunks. I also added brown sugar at the end. I didn't use very much milk but I also like my oatmeal a little thicker.

This was really good! I would follow the advice of others and add some brown sugar to sweeten it up a little bit. I added some raisins which add a nice chewiness. I would also omit the milk at the end because I tend to like my oatmeal a little more "sticky".

Either I needed the apple chunks smaller or should have boiled them longer. The taste was still quite good though I did add some sugar at the end....and extra water to allow everything to boil longer since I wasn't using quick oats. I'll definitely try this again and it's a great quick breakfast meal!

NO ONE in my 5 member family likes Oatmeal.  But since we all agreed that this year (New Year's resolutions and all of that) we would try to eat healthier and to budget more wisely, we also all agreed that Oatmeal would be a good place to start. And after I tried 3 other Oatmeal recipes from this site, we unanimously agreed that this one is the absolute BEST! I scale the recipe to 8, use 1 cup "regular" applesauce instead of apples (too lazy to "set up"), toss in 2 T. butter (more out of habit than need) plus a fistful of raisins and set out both Cinnamon and Splenda (another "substitution" in our quest for a healthier lifestyle) so that "who wants" can flavor theirs to taste. SO SUCCESSFUL that my 23 year old son (you know him -- the one who will NEVER leave home :)) came downstairs this morning and said: "Morning, Mom. Breakfast ready yet?" Now THAT'S a 5! (Oh, yes, any of our "leftovers" are set down for our 2 dogs. Result: NO leftovers!)

This was a really great alternative to plain old oatmeal and very easy to make.  I had to simmer mine a bit longer than called for in the recipe before it thickened to the right consistency but it was worth it.  I’ll definitely make this again and will definitely be experimenting with different types of fruit and juices.  I also sprinkled a little bit of Splenda on the top, but probably more out of habit than because it actually needed it.

This is really yummy!  It was not quite sweet enough for our family either.  I added about 1/3 cup brown sugar, and adjusted to make 4 servings.  Big hit in our house!  Thanks!

When ever we make oatmeal this it the way we do it.  We have a lot of apples in the fall and we freeze quart size bags of apple filing.  We double the recipe for this oatmeal, adding a bag of frozen apples with the water while it heats to boil, and omit the apple juice.  We also add about a quarter cup of brown sugar.  Love this oatmeal.  We eat it all year round.

My husband raved about this recipe.  He loved the taste and told me that it was very filling - he wasn't hungry for quite awhile. He also said he could eat this every morning.
