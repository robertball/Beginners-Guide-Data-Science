I liked this recipe. I used red wine & added some sugar instead of the Port & ketchup instead of tomato puree. I will slice the ham thinner next time so it will be easier to roll & I think I will roll it around an asparagus spear & onions. I also found that it only needed 30 min to cook.

Reminds me of my grandmothers. Like being a little girl again. Thank you for posting this! I used sherry instead of port and instead of rolls I diced the ham to put over egg noodles. Also good with mashed potatoes, which we will do next time.

I didn't care for the ham marinated in only port. As for the sauce, it was overwhelmingly port; the tomato didn't come through at all, and the curry-port mixture, without the tomato to balance it, was just weird. The ingredients sounded so good together, but I'm with Mr. Pickypants on this one. Thanks for sharing, though.
