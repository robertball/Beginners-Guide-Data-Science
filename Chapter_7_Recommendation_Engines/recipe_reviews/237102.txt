This recipe is great!!! I used closer to a cup of peanut butter and it was the perfect amount for the chocolate cake I made!  Everyone who had the cake raved about the frosting! Will definitely make this again!!!

This peanut butter frosting recipe turned out  beautifully.  After reading others comments and experiences, I made a few revisions with excellent results.  1.  Creamed the butter at high speed with whip attachment until the butter was a pale yellow.  2.  Added 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, pinch of salt and whipped until combined.  3. Added 1 Cup smooth peanut butter and 1/3 of a 8 oz. package of cream cheese and whipped again until combined and fluffy.  4.  Gradually added 2 C confectioners sugar and whipped until fluffy.  5.  Added about 3 T heavy whipping cream and whipped again to combine.  Use your judgement about the amount of cream needed...frosting should be light and fluffy.  The frosting was defintely sweet enough with 2 cups of confectioners sugar.  I used this to frost the Black Maguc Cake (the one that calls for adding 1/2 cup boiling water at the end) recipe on this website. Made a few changes to that recipe as well including adding 1 package mini chocolate chips, 8 oz. sour cream instead of buttermilk  and using plain boiling water instead of coffee. Baked in 9" x 13" pan 25-30 min at 350.  Perfect amount of frosting.  Rave comments from women and men alike.   Asked if it was an old family recipe.

I needed to ice a 13 x 9 cake for a fire department BBQ and was craving peanut butter.  I used 3/4 cup peanut butter, 3 full cups of sugar and maybe 2 T of milk.  The icing spread beautifully and I had about 1/4-1/2 cup left over which I am saving to eat with a spoon.  It's just right!

Very creamy and great peanut butter flavor. I only used 3 cups of conf. sugar though. That was plenty sweet.

It was pretty delicious and many raved of how awesome it was, but next time I would do about a cup less of sugar and maybe a tiny bit more milk to make it creamier. With so much sugar in it, it makes the frosting kind of grainy if that makes sense.

I really like this recipe I tweaked it a bit rather than 1/2 cup of peanut butter I do a 1 cup and rather than 4 cups of confectionary sugar I do 2 cups and lastly I add a dalop of cream cheese!

Excellent recipe.  I also used a cup of peanut butter instead of 1/2 a cup and cut back one cup of confectioners' sugar.  I agree with the other reviews that it was sweet enough with less sugar. It was delicious !!!

Easy & delicious.  This frosting saved a batch of cupcakes that I wasn't excited about. I made it exactly as written.  It was perfect consistency for  spreading with my Wilton cupcake decorating set.

EXCELLENT!!!!!    I put this on top of the Black Magic cake on this site.    The taste was great!   I used 1 cup of the whipped peanut butter and  I think it turns out perfect.

This is some good stuff! Reminds me of the inside of Reese's Pieces candy. I cut the recipe in half so I could frost some brownies. The only change I made was to add a bit of brown sugar to the mix. Saving this one to my recipe box for sure! Thanks!

I absolutely love this recipe, but I too made some changes. I used 1c “salted butter,” 1c extra creamy peanut butter, 1.5tsp pure vanilla extract, 2.5c confectioners sugar, 1.5c “Cool-Whip,” and whole milk as needed for thinner. I absolutely love peanut butter anything so if you really want to taste the Peanut Butter without it being to overly sweet then try this! I use it for the filling of my Chocolate Oatmeal Moon Pies and my Banana Stuffed French Toast and it’s so wicked good you don’t even need syrup. I do recommend using Texas Toast and a Pizza Pocket press to seal up the edges because the frosting does tend to get a little loose from the heat.

Simple easy and great for a non-cook peanut butter icing.  We like it with salted butter and prefer with only half of the milk called for.  My #1 quick peanut butter icing!

I made this yesterday for the Black Magic cake, I think next time I will add more peanut butter and less sugar. I thought it turned out too sweet; however my fiancé and his mother thought it was just perfect!

Great recipe but I added more peanut butter and cut the sugar to 2 cups instead of 4.  It’s plenty sweet.  Also instead of milk I used heavy cream.   Definitely will be making it again.

Loved it!  I added a bit more peanut butter (about 3/4 cup) as I love peanut butter.  Delicious!

This frosting is fantastic! I increased the peanut butter to 1 cup and only used  2 cups of confectioners sugar. All other ingredients were used according to the recipe. I will definitely make this again!

Salt in icing?!


 I showed this to a friend, they looked at me with disbelief as if I was the one that put salt in this recipe!  What kind of crazy person puts salt in icing? ?????

I made this for my mother’s birthday cake and it was a hit! It’s so good I’m making it for Easter dinner! (To make it even better add cut up Reese cups and add Reese pieces with some shaved chocolate and it makes it soooo good)

I planned to make a double batch, but after I started I realizing I did not have enough confectionary sugar on hand. It still tasted amazing. I used 2 cups of butter, 2 cups of Jif peanut butter, 1 1/2 teaspoons of Vanilla extract, 1 lb of confectionary sugar, & a pinch of salt.  I would make this recipe again it tastes really good.

I have made this recipe several times and it is good however I did need to tweak it to our liking which is why I only gave it 3 stars. I followed some other reviews and added 1 cup of peanut butter and only 3 cups of icing sugar. I also added an extra tablespoon of milk to make it more spreadable. I also used a piping bag and it definitely needed the extra generous tablespoon of milk to pipe it easier. The way it's written is ok but if your sticking to the way it's written it's very sweet, not such a strong peanut butter flavour and a little dry.

This icing was a mega hit!  I also used a full cup of peanut butter and only used 2 cups of powdered sugar, as it was for my son’s smash cake.  Letting the butter come all the way to room temp and then whipping that really well first gave it a really light and fluffy result. Very easy to spread, and super tasty. Will definitely make again!

Love this icing.  Used it on one bite brownies and it was a hit.  I did put a little more peanut butter in it but not much more.  It wasn't overly sweet and very tasty.

I have never made homemade icing before. I read the comments and followed some of their suggestions and oh my gracious it tasted like peanut butter heaven.  On my way now to take the chocolate peanut butter cupcakes to my dad for his birthday so I’m looking forward to seeing what he thinks.  My husband snagged one before we left and said they were absolutely delicious.

I made this with the same ingredient list but simply dumped everything in a bowl and stirred it for a second so powered sugar did not go everywhere.  And hit it with the mixer for about 2 minutes on high and I was done.  I topped a chocolate cake with it as a surprise for my wife and she loved it!

It was very good but if youre making it with a chocolate cake and chocolate frosting you will have to add more peanut butter because the taste got lost. But it was delicious if on its own. But I'm definitely going to use this again

This was the best peanut butter frosting recipe I've ever tried! The only small change I made was to cut back a little on the confectioner's sugar. I will be making this frosting again and again.

Really yummy! But you definitely don't need 4 cups of sugar to make this baby (I used about 2.5). Also, I do recommend increasing the peanut butter if you like that flavour. The current ratio gives just a hint of peanut butter flavour, but mostly just sweetness. I increased it since I was pairing this with a chocolate cake and wanted the peanut butter to shine. I didn't need the milk because I was going for a stiffer texture. The leftovers sure are delicious!

This is very good. Made a 9x13 sheet cake. Plenty to top. Made some adjustments per other reviews. Only used 3 cups sugar. Didn't have confectioners sugar so I made my own. 1 cup of sugar plus 1 TBP corn starch for every cup of confectioners sugar called for in recipe. Grated in a blender (important)  The additional peanut butter 3/4 cup. And heavy cream instead of milk.  Made for a pregnant woman who wanted Peanutbutter chocolate cake with Koolaide!

I unfortunately had to knock this down a star because I didn't think that it would work as well as written so I had to make changes. Like other reviewers I upped the peanut butter to 1 cup, and cut the sugar to 3 cups. I also cut the milk to 1T and subbed it with heavy whipping cream.  The frosting turned out very smooth and the not overly sweet. It was a big hit at my cornhole league.

Next time will add at least 1 cup less sugar and less milk.  It was way too sweet and way to thin.  I could barely ice the cupcakes.

Delicious and easy. I used 1 cup of peanut butter and 3 cups of sugar, 1/3 cup of cream cheese as per the suggestions.

Per reviewer suggestion, I increased the peanut butter. 3/4 c. gave me good pb flavor. This is now my go-to recipe. Easy to work with for cupcakes.

I added twice as much peanut butter. This  was a simple recipe that made very fluffy icing. The family loved it!

Excellent recipe! Very creamy and workable. I added more p.b. - probably closer to 1 cup.

This frosting was delicious just the right amount of peanut butter. I ended up using about 3/4 cup of cream and milk to make the frosting lighter. I also only used 2 cups of powdered sugar because u found the frosting to be really sweet

Awesome! I tweaked it a bit I used 1/2 tsp of peanut butter emulsion instead of vanilla extract and heavy cream instead of milk and whipped so it was super fluffy. My husband said it was best cupcake I have made so far...it was creamy with a rich peanut butter taste. So yum!

This was awesome on the black magic cupcakes!  I used 1 cup of peanut butter and half and half because I had some that needed to be used and the frosting turned out soooo well!  Favourite peanut butter frosting recipe I've tried yet!

Delicious. The frosting has an awesome texture and great flavor. I used closer to a cup of peanut butter and a little less sugar.

Loved this! Put this on some rich chocolate cupcakes I made. I plan to make this recipe again and fill the cupcakes, as well as frost them next time! I took off one star only because I didn't actually follow the recipe. I used only 2 cups of powdered sugar, and I sifted it after measuring, before adding it to the frosting. I also used between 3/4 and 1 cup of peanut butter and about 2 tablespoons of milk. Next time I would omit the milk entirely though.  DELICIOUS FROSTING!

This was an easy to make recipe.  We doubled the peanut butter and milk and cut the sugar back to 3 cups for a richer taste and creamy texture.

After reading the reviews, I decided to go along with some of the helpful hints, so the changes I did was a 1 of PB instead of 1/2 cup and 3 cups of 10x instaed of 4. Turned out perfect and made plenty for  a 9x 13 cake.
