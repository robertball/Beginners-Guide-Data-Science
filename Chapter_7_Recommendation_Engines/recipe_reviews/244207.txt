Very good. Eggplant was a little mushy, but excellent flavor.

Very bland I would make it lemonier spicier or make it into a dessert with brown sugar/cinnimon.

Yuck, I couldn’t even eat my portion. I love veggies but I cannot find a way to like eggplant.

This is very versatile. Basically I made an Italian stuffed eggplant. I cooked chicken in my Foodi, shredded it, then sautéed garlic/onion in my Foodi. I didn’t have fresh basil but I had pesto so I added pesto to the newly shredded chicken/onion/garlic mixture. I added tomatoes. I did this in the morning. For dinner I baked the eggplant but my mixture had no cheese. I topped with fresh mozzarella after all was assembled and cooked then put under broiler just to melt.

I like things on the spicy side so I grilled chicken breast with ground fennel seed and coriander. I didn't have scallions so added some white onion with the tomatoes and chicken. Since I didn't have basil and had added spices to the chicken I didn't garnish it with anything. I used Monterey Jack cheese. It turned out very nice and it was even better today when I brought some to work for my lunch. It took little effort and time to make.

The family loved this! I used Fresh-picked eggplant, tomatoes, & banana peppers. I also used chicken I had previously cooked with Badia seasoning; that added plenty of flavor! Used dried chives & parsley on top of the cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese. Many didn’t even realize they were eating eggplant!

Eggplant just became one of my favorite vegetables!  I substituted a lot (chopped beefsteak tomatoes; dried basil, in the same amount as the fresh, and sharp cheddar cheese.)  I don't think that you could ever add too much cheese.  The eggplant will just sit & soak up as much oil as you brush on, so stick with the recipe in this one.
