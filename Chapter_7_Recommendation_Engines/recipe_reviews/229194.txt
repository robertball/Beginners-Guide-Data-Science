I made this with Southern Comfort, and the proportions were perfect. I remember a friend telling me about this recipe once -- he said to make it with Seagram's 7, which I might try next time. I love drink recipes that taste good and don't require a lot of ingredients.

My husband's go-to drink. This is also good with flavored whiskey/flavored 7-UP as well.

7 up tastes great with a lot of stuff. Even gin, for when you get sick of tonic. But the ONLY drink that is a "7 and 7" is 7 up and Seagram's Seven. It's why it's specifically called a 7 and 7.

A 7 and 7 is my favorite go to when I want a mixed drink. I will add that an alternate version, a whiskey and Sprite, is another fine option with a similar taste, just with the often more refreshing taste of Sprite instead.  Can not go wrong with either option.

as the recipe states, a classic cocktail.  another nice 7up drink for summers: pack a glass full of ice, fill half way with vodka, top off with 7up and add a slice of lemon and/or lime .  let the ice melt a bit and enjoy!
