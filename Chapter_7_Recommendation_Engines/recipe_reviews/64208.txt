I did not make this exactly, because I used some couscous already on hand & made up my own idea of what would be in the spice packet (garlic powder, ground coriander, a little cumin).  The flavor is wonderful.  I will definitely make this again.

I noticed some eyebrows raising when friends and family discovered couscous on my Christmas dinner menu this year.  Okay.  So it's not the most traditional item for the holiday meal, but I was feeling adventurous...Good thing, too -- NOW they're all raving about it and calling me for the recipe.  Thank you for putting it on your site!
