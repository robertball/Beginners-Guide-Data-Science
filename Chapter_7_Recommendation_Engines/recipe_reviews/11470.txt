These are great -- my dogs love them.  My first batch did mold so the second batch I omitted the milk and cooked them a little longer.  All the dogs in my family got them for Christmas!  I have already made them several times.

This recipe worked well for me, with a few changes. As with some other reviewers, I couldn't find Brewer's yeast or Cracked wheat (I have since). I substituted oatmeal for the cracked wheat and added 2 T. peanut butter to hot bullion to supplement for the lack of Brewer's yeast. I also omitted the milk "topping". My hound loves them...and she's 16 and pretty darn fussy!! I roll and cut them out different shapes to give her a bit of variety. Thanks for the recipe--got anything with carob for my chocolate lovin' girl?!

I've been paying outrageous prices so that my two little cockapoo darlings can have treats. With all my grandkids, great nieces and nephews around, they're inclined to be on sugar highs most of the time because they're just the right size to grab a cookie from a little one. I decided to try this doggie bone treat. They really seem to enjoy it. I make the bones with chicken broth sometimes. They seem to prefer the beef more. After ten hours in the oven, they tend to be pretty darn crunchy! Good jaw and tooth exercise! Thanks Juanita.

My dogs love these biscuits!  They bake nice and hard, so smaller dogs have to work at it a bit to eat them.  The biscuits give them plenty of chewing enjoyment!

I also discovered the benefits of leaving milk out of the recipe (regarding spoilage), due to my pet’s food allergy. I have spent a fair share of money on treats for my border collie, Sophie, and she craves these above all others!! Because of these yummy snacks, she is more spoiled than ever!

I made these biscuits according to the recipe with just one small alteration.... instead of adding 2 cups cracked wheat, I added 1 cup cracked wheat and 1 cup of couscous.  The mixture was very plentiful!!..... I should have used my very largest bowl for mixing.  I baked them for 45 minutes and cooled them down completely before storing them in several air-tight biscuit tins.  My dog and friends' dogs absolutely loved them!  For Xmas I cut the dough into Xmas tree and ginger bread man shapes.  They were fun. On the ones which I cut with a round scone cutter I put a small piece of dried liver before baking.  The biscuits ended up very hard and crisp, and should be very good for the dogs' teeth.

I made these for Christmas treats for our dogs and friends' dogs. The brewer's yeast in hard to find, but someone told me not to put bread yeast in it as a substitute because it might hurt the dog. I ended up going to a health food store to find it. My dogs really liked these, and I think it was worth the extra effort!

This is a wonderful recipe. I have made my Great Pyrenees treats before but I really liked the healthy ingredients in this one. Instead of the cracked wheat I used oatmeal. I also added some honey a couple tablespoons. I added 3tbs of the brewers yeast because I have been trying to get it into his diet. Big Dog really loves them.

I followed the directions exactly and the biscuits didn't harden like I expected it to.  They were still fairly soft and they turned moldy after a week.  I don't think that I'll be making these again.

Dogs cannot eat garlic - it accumulates in their organs and can kill them.  PLEASE check with a VETERINARY Facility before feeding your dog any homemade treats.

Now, as I haven't tried these out I did notice that if your dog has a sugar problem you should omit the corn meal as that is a sugary product.
Also, if you do under bake the dog bisuits you can always go and place the dog cookies back in the shut off oven on a tray when you are done cooking the batch. Let them sit overnight to "dry" this will help with the mold problem after a week. See, your flours are still wet and that green stuff will start to grow. For some of you whom have the mold problems this should fix that problem.

my dog and all my friends dogs just love these. I make them with all organic ingredients and a batch only costs like 6.00 to make and makes a TON of cookies. So much cheaper than those in the stores and my dog likes them better anyways! I love to give them to my friends as gifts for their "fur kids" and it's always appreciated :)

I would omit the garlic powder because of the health issues it causes in dogs, such as Heinz-body anemia; especially if you plan of feeding these treats to your dog on a regular basis.

Unfortunately, this recipe did not workout for me.  The biscuits were hard as a rock.  My dog liked the taste but she couldn't break up the treat.  I couldn't even break it in half with my hands.  I threw them all out.

Yes, dogs love these.  I found brewers yeast at a health food store in pill form and had to crush them for the recipe.  Fun to make!  Used oatmeal, too.

I only gave this a 3 star review because I've read that corn is not necessarily a good thing to give dogs. There are discussions that address dog allergies to corn and many dog food processors are eliminating it from their recipes. Is there an expert out there that could provide some insight? I want to make these, but would like this answered before I start mixing and baking.

I've made these biscuits for years, for my pup and as Christmas gifts for the dogs in our family.  All the dogs love them!  I recently started omitting the garlic though.  I mentioned the recipe to my vet and he said garlic is not good for dogs, even in small amounts as it builds up in their system over time, especially in powder form.  My pup loves the treats without the garlic!

"While it’s uncommon for dogs to eat enough raw onions and garlic to cause serious problems, exposure to concentrated forms of onion or garlic, such as dehydrated onions, onion soup mix or garlic powder, may put dogs at risk of toxicosis. The damage to the red blood cells caused by onions and garlic generally doesn’t become apparent until three to five days after a dog eats these vegetables. Affected dogs may seem weak or reluctant to move, or they may appear to tire easily after mild exercise."
