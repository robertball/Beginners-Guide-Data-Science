Exactly what I was looking for and very delicious!  When I was compiling the layers I realized I did not have enough eggplant and popped some more cut up slices in the microwave for 5 minutes--it was just as yummy as the ones done in the oven. BTW the salting does not need to be done on eggplant prepared like this.  You are not drawing out the moisture--salting is to take out the bitterness.  A step that I no longer bother with anymore anytime I prepare eggplant.  But then, I love it! Thanks for sharing!

I've tried three or four different types of eggplant casseroles in the past and this is the first recipe that earned a "This is a repeat" from my husband. First, don't try this recipe with only one eggplant, you really do need two. Second, I had more luck leaving the peel on...it meant less burnt slices from the oven and a meatier texture of the final product. The slices do easily burn, you have to start keeping a close watch after 15 minutes. I used pasta sauce instead of the tomato sauce/spices, but did add a little extra basil and oregano to taste. I LOVE that this recipe doesn't require "sweating" the eggplant slices or breading/frying the slices...SO much work, not to mention we're trying to do low-carb right now, and this recipe fit the bill. I've made it twice now and it's earned a place in the menu rotation...no small feat!

Like it alot but if you do the salting to draw out moisture, make sure you rinse VERY WELL.  Tad salty because I didn't rinse well enough.  Next time I'll get it right.

I wanted something easy and delicious and this recipe filled that need.  I cut the recipe in half as there are only the two of us at home, but next time will make the full recipe and freeze some of it.   My husband agreed it was simply delicious.  I love the fact that the eggplant was baked rather than fried.

This recipe is just what I was looking for since my garden is generating eggplant like crazy. I doubled all of the ingredients to make two casseroles, baking the slices on a parchment lined sheet pan, overlapping slightly.   I also used my home-canned Italian tomato sauce, so left out the herbs. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly, baked one dish and froze the other. It was a real treat, simple and delicious. I expect the frozen dish to be just as good. Thank you, I will make this again.

First attempt at Eggplant Parm and it came out great! I followed the recipe and used a maranara sauce instead of plain tomato sauce and it made a great flavor! My husband loved it! I made 1/3rd of it with fat free cheese so it was only 3 WW Smart Points! This is one I will surely make again!!!

Made this (with just one eggplant and probably a  LITTLE extra cheese!) and my partner RAVED about it!   Easy recipe for first time using eggplant.  Serve with light salad and garlic/parm toast for sipping up the sauce!

made half the dish but used some homemade tomato sauce, did not have mushrooms so put in sun dried tomatoes, then decided I wanted to make it an entree so added a tub of firm tofu that I broke into crumbles, then it was to dry so added a can of tomato sauce anyways. Had to much sauce for just one roasted eggplant. It was delicious but next time will use 2 eggplants and buy some mushrooms. My husband dislikes eggplant but he liked this dish. My 17 year old would not try it.
version 2- used mushrooms, onion and zucchini layered with eggplant, sauce and cheese. it was good but a little bit runny sauce. I like the firm tofu smashed into the sauce. it was not as runny.

Delicious dish but a bit involved to make for a week night dinner.  This dish reheated reasonably well the next day.

I like this recipe because it is much easier than traditional Eggplant Parmesanâ€” I did not peel the eggplants, nor sweat them and I used bottled sauce to make it even easier for me .  The taste was good, even better on day 2...  Had to tweak the recipe with more cheese and  sauce to get good coverage of the eggplant slices for my taste.   I will be making this often.

This was really delicious! I'm not a too familiar with eggplant so this was different for me, but my hubs and I were pleasantly surprised that we liked this recipe. Left-overs the next day are even better. I only made half a batch; next time I'll make a whole batch so we can have more to eat the next day : ) It's a keeper!

I'm not sure who actually can prep this recipe  in 15 minutes.  Thankfully I have made many recipes from this site which claim to take 15-20 minutes to prep.  Hysterical!  I also can not imagine the size of the baking dish people must have, I needed three to arrange 2 sliced eggplants in a single layer.  That being said, the casserole is delicious!!!  I love that the eggplant is not fried or coated in bread.  My only changes were that I  added some extra sauce as I had some leftover and would still prefer more and I peeled some of the skin off the eggplant.  I used one of the baking dishes for the casserole rather than dirty yet another dish.  I definitely will make again.

This was perfect for a weeknight. I used squash instead of mushrooms and added red and yellow bell peppers. I only made one layer, rather than a double layer.

This is very good and easy to make.  For the sauce I used Barilla Roasted Garlic and added dried herbs.  I will be making this again and again.  Thank  you for the recipe.

We loved it! I didn't have all the ingredients but used what I had on hand. Parmesan, cheddar and some cheese from fresh cows milk instead of what was called for in the instructions. It would be awesome over pasta or even on a pizza crust! Extra garlic added. Awesome!

So very yummy! It reminded me of lasagna. The only substitution I made was I used a three cheese blend of Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago cheese in place of Parmesan alone. I also sweated the eggplant for 30 minutes by putting it on towels, salting it, and then wiping off the salt. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Added 7 more oz. of tomato sauce and used fresh oregano and fresh basil leaves. Also used 1 cup Parmesan . Omg melt in your mouth tasty! Eggplant is a wonderful substitute for meat. Ready to make eggplant, basil and tomato melt sandwiches next ( why not use left over ingredients? )

I think the sauce needs more flavor. The next time I will use spaghetti sauce.
