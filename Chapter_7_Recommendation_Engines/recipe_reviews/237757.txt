This is a recipe I submitted; unfortunately it was published as using uncooked rice. This is wrong, the recipe should reflect 3/4 cup rice COOKED per package directions. It is NOT instant rice.
The whole peeled tomatoes should also be chopped.

Better than I expected. We had to modify slightly due to dietary restrictions so we make a replacement for tomatoes, sauce intended to taste very close to puree tomatoes and no chili powder. I think it would be even better with chili powder. I just use extra garlic and cumin. I cooked all in a cast iron and then moved right to the oven in cast iron. Made it super easy. Note you need minute ride and it didn't specify so rice was crunchy. We didn't notice to bad as we ate with chips as this was our variation on our taco Tuesday night.

It was alright but nothing special. It was crumbly and dry so I was looking for something to bind it all together. I added salsa. Probably won't make it again.

Half of the family liked it.  The other half wished they would have got the half I made with no black olives :)    Overall- great recipe- we will make it again! Thanks for sharing!

We discovered that we do not like the big chunks of whole tomato.  I will use diced tomato next time.  Also, it does not feed 6 if the people are adult men; it feeds more like 3.

Use cooked or minute rice because standard rice does not get tender, good flavor
