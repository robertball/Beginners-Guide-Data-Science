Great flavor from the marinade! I was running short on time, so I wound up simmering the beef chunks in a little bit of the marinade to get more of the flavor in - next time I'll try to plan ahead so I can let it sit for the 2-3 hours. Topped with some fresh cilantro and pico de gallo - muy bueno!!!

These turned out really good. I did make one change. Asada translates to grilled and so I grilled the meat.
