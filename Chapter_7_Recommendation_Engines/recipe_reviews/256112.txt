This was delicious! Rich and decadent. Very flavorful. This was the third recipe I tried before knowing I had a winner for my family Christmas brunch. The only change I made was to use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.

DELICIOUS! I made this for a kid-friendly NYE party. My slow cooker took closer to 2 hours to cook everything, and then it was extremely hot, so beware of that potential. I'd recommend whisking every 15-20 minutes until the chocolate dissolves. But this is far tastier than the powdered mixes and kids love the rich chocolate flavor, and adults can turn it into an adult drink also.

It is delicious...

But it is so heavy and sweet that myself and my 7year old daughter ended up having upset stomachs and just feeling ill... i'm going to see how I can lessen the sweetness and lighten it a bit.

I made this with whole milk, and it was incredibly rich. Delicious, but a half a mug and I was stuffed. Next time I'll use 1% or 2%.

Scrumptious! Made this for an office Hot Cocoa Bar and it was a huge hit. We used big crock pots and doubled the recipe.  Since it was 4 cups of chocolate chips, we cooked them on high for two hours.  It takes a little longer when you double so be sure to account for the extra time.  Turn it down on low  after it gets hot though. Absolutely delicious with marshmallows on a sugar cane, dipped in milk chocolate and rolled in peppermint chips. Yum!!!

This is delicious and so easy! I’ll probably never use store bought again. I gave it 4 stars because I made one change, I cut the sweetened condensed milk in half. The first time I made it I followed the recipe and it was way too sweet. Second time I cut it in half and it was perfection! Everyone loved it. Very filling!

I made a double batch. I doubled the milk but used the same amount of whipping cream and condensed milk. Used 1/4 dark chocolate chips and the rest semi sweet. The reviewers who said using chips were a risk were correct, some of the chips didn’t fully dissolve so there were some flakes of us dissolved chocolate floating around. No one minded. It was sort of epic hot chocolate and everyone loved it.

Very rich.  I used 1/2 semi sweet and 1/2 dark chocolate chips and 2% milk.  I think the next time I will use all dark chocolate to cut the richness a little more.  It is delicious but a little goes a long way.  I used some of the leftover the next morning as a coffee creamer and it was wonderful.

I used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet, and I also added dutch cocoa, I wanted it more chocolaty. 

I had it on high for 2.5 hours, stirring/whisking ever .5 hour ; in the last .5 hour I boiled an 1/8 cup of water and dissolved 4 tbsp  of dutch cocoa in it, I then whisked this into the mix until it was incorporated. Then turned the crock-pot to keep warm.

Everybody RAVED about it.

Comments were "I didn't think I would like this but I LOVED it!"  "Can I PLEASE have the recipe?"  I served it with peanut-butter cookies.  

This was a small Christmas Eve get together for those in our building who were alone on the holiday to spread a little cheer, and I'm SO happy I did this, exactly those I wanted to show up did

A big hit everywhere I take it!  Now requested at every cold weather event I attend.  Will often make it a "hot chocolate bar" with a side of marshmallows, crushed peppermints, different flavored syrups, baileys, etc.  Love it!

Super rich, give it LOTS of time to come together. Otherwise it will look strange slightly separated, but will still taste great.

Used milk chocolate morsels and omitted the vanilla. This turned out super sweet, almost too sweet. I might cut back on the morsels or add more milk next time.

Made this for a fall party. It was amazingly delicious! I used milk chocolate chips and transferred it to an old percolator for easy pouring. Will definitely be at the next gathering also!

Very good, but VERY sweet. I made this for a party (double batch), and ended up adding an extra litre of milk to it to bring down the sweetness. I will make it again, if I make a small batch I’d probably half the condensed milk. Got a lot of compliments, tastes great as a “spiked hot chocolate”

This is the absolute best hot chocolate ever. Make your own whip cream and pure heaven. We had a snow day and all the adults went crazy over it and one of the 11 year olds asked where it had been all of his life!!  I used all organic ingredients too.

We had this hot chocolate at a Christmas party recently and it was delicious. When the hostess told us how easy it was I couldn't wait to get the recipe. Will make it soon!

My sister made this first for a small party and it was a big hit. I tried some and had to have the recipe, so my sister pointed me to here. I like my chocolate a bit rich, and this was perfect for me. Stir often and check temp. I turned mine on high for most of the first hour to ensure that the chocolate melted well.
