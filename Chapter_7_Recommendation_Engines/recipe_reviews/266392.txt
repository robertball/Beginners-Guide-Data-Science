I will readily admit I had no hopes for this recipe. It sounded “blah”. Man was I wrong!!! This recipe is amazingly delicious!!! The sauce is SO memorable, and combined with everything else it’s destined to become a repeat offender in my recipe box. I followed the recipe exactly and served it with rice noodles. I don’t know if the recipe is authentic, but man is it amazing!!!

It has a decent, nice taste but it's really not all that special compared to other asian stir fry dishes.
