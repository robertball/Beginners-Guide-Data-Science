Yum is right! I only made one serving and had a bit too much crab (leftover from crab leg dinner) and I stink at flattening chicken breasts so it was sloppy - but the taste was fantastic! The only thing I changed was to add an ice cube's worth of lemon juice to the sauce because I didn't have any dry wine. I really wanted to take a picture before I ate but it smelled too good and I had to dive right in! Good one Gina!

This was very good! I thought I might need to double the sauce but it was just fine as is. If I make it again I would put dill in the sauce maybe....

The sauce on this dish is very good. Does need some seasoning though. Added some salt and pepper once it was thickened. Used Parmesean cheese on the top and sprinkled with paprika for color. I was also in a hurry and baked it at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes.

I am delighted to see that this delicious recipe is still being submitted by new generations of cooks! I was looking for it on the BH&G website to send to a friend and this page showed up online. This is originally from their 'All American Recipes' cookbook which I received from my mother-in-law in 1981! It really is an easy recipe which will impress the novices and long-time dinner guests. You will not be sorry!

I'm not a cook and usually feel little intimidated by the kitchen but this dish was fun to cook and turned out great. I thought it unusual that the recipe didn't call for spices of any kind so I added some pepper and salt. That's the only change I made and my wife and daughter now think I should spend more time cooking!

This recipe was amazing & restaurant quality!!! I followed the recipe exactly and both my husband & I loved it! I think that it might have even been better warmed up the next day. This is definitely a keeper.

This is a fantastic recipe but instead of 1 hr i just make it for 30 minutes in 400. Nice flavor but a little bit too filling i'll probably need to cut the butter next time

I try to read the top reviews and bottom reviews on any new recipe I make. There were some reviews on this one that said there wasn't much flavor to the sauce. I will agree. One the cooking time of 1 hour is way too long. I'd try 30 minutes and then use a thermometer to check if the chicken is done. The stuffing needs something maybe cream cheese or mayo or lemon but its totally bland. The sauce needs more too. There are no spices in the sauce. I cut the cookie crumbs in half. I don't like stuffing that is over breaded. Mine worked out pretty well in that regard other than lacking flavor.

Excellent dish very easy to make. I double the sauce to be able to use as a gravy. Made for Christmas dinner & got rave reviews! Would make again for any occasion.
