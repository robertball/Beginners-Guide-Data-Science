Made this for dinner tonight, minus the onion powder-we didn't have any and used greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I have 3 kids (7-11) which gobbled it up and asked for seconds-they normally won't eat cauliflower.  Will make again and again--thank you!

One of our favorites! So good.  I always double this one since it is so popular.

I read some of the reviews and was a bit confused.  The recipe clearly calls for steaming first.  Perhaps it has been edited?  At any rate, this is a must.  And as to the mashing, I prefer my dish to be more of a "crumble" than a mash.  The object is not to make it smooth, just broken up.  

I do sometimes sprinkle a bit of extra cheese on top. We like the bubbly cheese topping.

Very easy and delicious.  I did not add the ranch dressing mix but instead added bacon bits and sliced green onions.  Decadent but at least its low carb, something we need to add more to our diets.

This is delicious and great way to disguise cauliflower if you have picky eaters that wouldn't usually eat it. A couple things I do to make this easier are, run the cauliflower through my food processor and then put it in a microwave safe bowl, cover with plastic wrap and zap it for about 8-10 minutes and let it sit for a couple minutes to steam through. Then I mix all the above ingredients, I substitute plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream for less fat, and bake as directed. Comes out great every time.

I steamed the cauliflower in the microwave which expedited that part of the recipe.    I'm never totally on board when it comes to mashing cauliflower, since you simply can't get the consistency really as smooth as you can with potatoes.  However, I love the fact that this dish is low carb, easy to make, and although I wouldn't go as far as to say it tastes "...like a loaded potato," I positively will say that some of those flavors are in it, and it's a very nice way to style up a cauliflower side dish.  Bookchickadee, thanks for sharing your recipe.

This recipe was really good. Thoroughly enjoyed it and a great way to eat cauliflower! I made it without the ranch as it sometimes has MSG in it. And added 1/2 tsp of paprika for color. yum.

Quick. Easy. Yummy! I left out the onion powder because I didn't have any, I used parmesan cheese, and I used no fat Greek Yogurt instead of sour cream.

This was too good for words.I had to stop myself from eating the entire dish before my husband and other daughter got home to eat. My youngest and I ate 1/2 of it.  Really, really good. No changes needed, well except for doubling it next time.

Just tried this for the first time. It was amazing!!! So yummy. Tastes exactly like loaded potatoes, but actually healthy. I will be making this often now that I know how easy and healthy it is.

I have an electric Handy Steamer that does rice, veggies, etc.  I used this to steam the cauliflower instead.  I decided to try this recipe along with grilled steak.  WOW!!  It was such a hit to my surprise, that I certainly will make it again.  Yumm!!

So simple and yummy! I didn't have onion powder or garlic powder so I cut up some leek, added salt and pepper and replaced the sour cream with Greek yogurt and added mushrooms and sausage on top!

All I can say is "OMG!". This was sooo good, and guilt free. I omitted the butter, used a whole pack of the Hidden Valley Ranch mix, and eyeballed the measurements since I doubled the recipe and was in a hurry. I also boiled the cauliflower because my steamer was not large enough for the amount of cauliflower I had. I will definitely be making this again. I love loaded potatoes, but this is just as tasty and without all the calories.

The first few bites were great, but the flavor got rich too fast.  I skipped the sour cream and used a hint of ranch dressing (maybe a tablespoon). I may make again, and I'm glad I tried it!

Good flavor, but I do not recommend using microwave to steam the cauliflower. I'm sure that impacted the texture.  Next time I'll follow the recipe and not try to save time.

This recipe was really good. the mix of sour cream and cheese was delicious. I'm going to make again but this time not mash the cauliflower. I did not add ranch seasoning because I've always thought that was odd as a seasoning...and I added quite a bit of salt

I added a little pepper and instead of onion salt I used diced green onion to add some color. I also had a little extra swiss cheese so I grated a small amount and added that. Delicious!

EASY  This was a nice way to change cauliflower up for a side dish. I followed recipe and we enjoyed. However, so many
ways to make this your own. I microwaved the cauliflower,
so much easier. I made a homemade  dry ranch dressing.
It was good, but you could easily use any combo of spices
you have and enjoy. I used Greek yogurt. Also a crumb topping and more cheese would be nice.  Or just steam cauliflower,
break up a bit ,not mash , and sprinkle with spice and butter.

I had a head of cauliflower on hand and decided to check out my go to recipes.com. This dish was a hit. Since I only had pre shredded Mexican cheese, that is what I used.  The ranch mix is a bit salty so add it to taste. I otherwise followed the recipe as is. It turned out great!

This is an awesome dish!!! I substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream and added a bit of mayo-1/4 c. I added crumbled bacon (4 strips of pre cooked) and corn from two left over ears. I also like a bit of spice so added 1/2 tsp of chipotle powder. This will be a new go to.

I recently made this, and I will say it was pretty tasty. I added more ranch mix than the recipe called for, because my particular head of cauliflower was kinda big. I also didn't bake the sour cream into it, only because we didn't have a lot and I wanted to make sure everyone got to put some on their serving afterwards.

This is amazing!  I agree with other reviewers that you still know its cauliflower, but my husband and I both enjoy cauliflower, so that was not an issue.  I have a veggie steamer so I steamed  it until tender (about 20 minutes) and then after mashing it with a potato masher, I put it in a towel and twisted, but ther really was not that much liquid.  then mised it up and baked as directed.  One change, at the  30 minute point, I sprinked on a bit more cheddar and some bacon pieces I had, seemed to  make it seem more like a loaded potato that way, but it was yummy just as is!  Definitely something I will make over and over!  Thanks!

Really good recipe.  He will eat cauliflower if it is very flavored, and this one is.  I did not steam on the stove.  I cut into florets and put in a pie plate with a little water, saran wrap and par cook that way.  Then I made the recipe as stated.  Add your own seasonings with this.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for sharing.

This is really good and my husband (who is hypoglycemic and has to eat low carb) loves it! The only changes I made was adding chopped green onions and cook  crumbled bacon in the mix. I also left cauliflower whole instead of mashing. Cuts down on time!

Excellent!   Added leftover roast chicken for a complete meal.   Also substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream.   Healthy and yummy.

I didn’t read the directions thoroughly and poured the whole pack of ranch dressing mix in. After I realized I added too much; I double the sour cream. This was quickly scarfed down with no leftovers and everyone requested that it be made again.

I made some changes the second time (two days later) that turned this into a love.
Follow the recipe as written but add a 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the mix. Once in the dish, add crispy bacon pieces and breadcrumbs on top then bake like the instructions. At the end, put on broil for 5 to 10 minutes until browned the way you like.

I loved this dish. I do not have a steamer, so I used one package of garlic cauliflower that I could steam in the microwave. Since I used garlic cauliflower, I ommited the garlic powder.

One bag of the steamable cauliflower was perfect for the 2 serving size of the recipe. For the full 4 serving recipe, I would use 2 bags of cauliflower. 

We loved the way it turned out. very much resembled a potato side dish. We will definitely try this again!

I tweaked the recipe a little. I left out the onion powder and garlic powder and added a smidge more ranch dressing powder. I added crispy bacon bits that I fried up in the microwave like airplane wings.  I also crushed a sleeve of Ritz Garlic flavored crackers and sprinkled over the top of the dish prior to placing in oven!

I am in LOVE with this recipe!! Yes I would make it again in a heartbeat and maybe next time use chobani fat free plain yogurt instead of sour cream just to remove some of the fat and add some protein to it to add to the nutritional punch this dish has the potential of offering!!

My daughter is doing Keto, for her birthday each year I make her favorite dinner which is, Roast, potatoes, carrots, rolls.
I made this along with potatoes, everyone (except her) had both.  It was loved by all, including my son and grandchildren.
Very easy to make.

This recipe makes an outstanding substitute for mashed potatoes. Sour cream makes this good but using homemade creme fraiche makes this even better (mix 2 cups heavy cream with 3 tbs buttermilk in a sterile mason jar, cover with a coffee filter to keep out contaminants but let it breathe, leave on your kitchen counter for 24 hours and then refrigerate). Save this recipe in your Keto folder on the site.

Yes,   I would make it again.  Next time I will not mash the cauliflower finely rather leave it chunkier.  The recipe is easy to get creative with; make it lighter or richer.  Make  it as directed and its fine too.  Be sure to not over steam the cauliflower.

Found this when I was looking for vegetable recipes for picky eaters. I read through the comments and followed one of the suggestions to use plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and I threw in some green onion (because I love them). I also didn’t have a steamer so I tossed the cauliflower in the food processor and did the microwave steaming instead. It was a total hit! My 7 year old even asked for more. Will definitely make again!

Excellent. I do a head of cauliflower and some broccoli. Steam that and then add a little diced onion after it’s done steaming. I double the sour cream and use a whole packet of uncle dan’s. Yum!

Great way to flavor up bland cauliflower!  We're doing low carb at our house and look for new ways to eat this vegetable we previously disregarded most of the time.  To save time, I crushed the florets into very small pieces which I steamed in the microwave and didn't mash them.  I added some commercial "Thai Seasoning" to kick it up a bit--hubby goes for this.  The whole family enjoyed this dish and it will be repeated every so often.

I really liked this! I used frozen riced cauliflower and cooked it in the microwave according to the package directions. I drained it in a colander after but I don't think I'd do that next time because I did find this to be a tad bit dry in the end. I used greek yogurt for the sour cream, bottled ranch instead of powdered (the subs were all because I used what I had on hand), and a variety of shredded cheese. I probably would have eaten the entire casserole myself!

My family LOVED it! I added fresh cooked chopped bacon, green onions, and increased the cheese a bit.

I liked it, my girls didn’t or I would give it 5 stars. I was hoping I found a vegetable dish they would eat! 
Made it as close to the recipe as I could. We don’t eat sour cream here so I used plain Greek yogurt and finished off my 1/2 cup of sour cream with mayonnaise since I didn’t have enough. I’ll try it again with all Greek yogurt next time to see if it makes a flavor difference but I assume it won’t

I made it tonight......used Ranch Salad Dressing instead of sour cream, omitted the dry dressing.  Added more cheese and stirred in some chopped green onion.  I think next time I'll also put in some bacon.  I didn't mash it, left it a bit chunky.  I thought it was very good.

This was simply DELICIOUS! I halved the recipe because I'm only one person. I used FROZEN cauliflower/broccoli mix (half a bag) and boiled it for 6 minutes. I did not mash anything. 
I didn't have the Ranch dressing mix so didn't add it. I may try it next time. I also didn't put any butter on top. (I think it would have ruined it, tbh)
This was honestly divine. I know that different people have different tastes but I can not understand how ANYONE says this is bland.  (get your tastebuds checked lol). 
The only thing I added on my own was a teeny dash of both oregano and basil to the sour cream mixture.
I will make this time and time again. Thank you!

5 stars because it is  a great variation of one of my least favorite vegetables.  I made no changes to the recipe, and it was quite tasty. The first night it was a side dish to salmon. Second day, it was lunch ... all by itself.   This morning I poached an egg ... topped it on a portion of this cauliflower gratin, and it was a delicious breakfast.

This was great, even without dry ranch dressing (didn’t have any).  I was looking for a substitute for it and found a recipe and used additional spices from that recipe:  dill weed, dried parsley, and a bit of pepper.  And per another review, touch of paprika.  I’d like to do a taste test against say cheesy potatoes now!!

I will make this over and over!  Since my cauliflower head was huge, I did 3/4 cup each of extra sharp cheddar and sour cream, did 1 tbs ranch dressing and the rest the same.  The only extra ingredient was a heavy sprinkle of Tajin spice (adds spice and lime).   After it was cooked I put the usual amount of the usual french fried onion rings on top for a couple, because I never make a casserole without those.   It is now on our hit parade!

It is a good and quick recipe. I have some advice to give. Don’t use the frozen cauliflower. It has too much water and it creates more work. You will need more butter than the recipe asks for. I didn’t have ranch dressing powder. Therefore I used 1/4 cup of ranch dressing. It still turned out good. Overall, this was a good recipe that I will be making again but with my own twist. Yummmmm!

Really good.  First  time  I made it as per the recipe.  Second time, I used greek plain yogurt and Bolthouse yogurt Ranch Dressing.  A lot less calories and I thought it tasted pretty good.  The original recipe is great IF you can afford the calories.

We liked it.  I might try adding bottled ranch dressing instead of dry since it needed a little more flavor.  I do not use salt so that is not an option

This is a simple and delicious recipe. Like others, I substituted the sour cream with Greek yogurt and added some paprika. Loved it!

This recipe was delicious and easy to make. I just added a little bit of black pepper, Parmesan cheese and some parsley to the mix. It was perfect!

Very tasty.  I returned cauliflower to pot to evaporate some liquid.  I added bacon and more cheese.  It was delicious and very filling.

Good recipe for cauliflower...still prefer the roasted cauliflower recipes utilizing garlic and fresh herbs for better flavor and texture.

I made this for the first time today. It was great. However, I added chopped up baby portobello mushrooms, and I looked forward to getting the tidbits of mushroom, so I am not sure I would enjoy the recipe with out the mushroom. Great base though!

I thought it was great and easy to make. I added a dash of cayenne pepper and some chives. I would have added bacon if I had it. Low calories but high in fat from the sour cream, cheese, and butter.

I made this without the ranch dressing mix so I did one teaspoon each of onion powder and garlic powder. I also added 1/2 mayo based on another recipe and it made it creamer. It was delicious and it reheated well for left overs.

As usual I made changes.  This is a very good recipe.  I exchange plain nonfat yogurt for the sour cream.  Used dried onion instead of onion powder; add Kirkland bacon crumbles and slice green onions.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent! Though I added my own touch based on other reviews. I used organic purple cauliflower, it came out beautiful! Added homemade bacon bits and green onions, omitted ranch dressing mix. May top with light breadcrumb layer next time as I will make this again!

My husband loves and requests this dish INSTEAD of mac and cheese. I have made as written and I have used greek yogurt, I have added a spoonful of mayo or salad dressing, I have stirred in green onion and I put cheese on top. I don't mash but just drag a knife through the steamed cauli so it's bite size crumbly. It is good all ways and I would much rather make this than mac and cheese.

I'm not much of a veggy eater and I thought this was very good.  I didn't use ranch dressing mix, but added about 1/4 cup of ranch dressing, some bacon bits and green onion, and then topped it with sour cream after I baked it.  Will definitely make this again.

Easily customizable! Next time, i plan to add chives and crumbled bacon! I broiled mine at the end, and sprinkled more cheese on top. This recipe is a winner!

I didn’t have all the ingredients to fully “load” it, and and I even forgot the garlic, but it was still very good, and so easy. Can’t wait to try it with the bacon bits!

Terrific low carb side dish.  Don't expect it to taste like mashed potatoes but it is very tasty. Instead of the onion and garlic powder I just doubled the ranch seasoning.

This is a wonderful side dish.  Just the right mix of
healthy decadence.  This will be a favorite of ours.

Loved it, I added the whole package of ranch dressing mix.  I boiled my cauliflower until tender.  I omitted the onion and garlic powder since there is enough in the dry mix.  Added some cheddar cheese the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Delicious, I will make this again and pass it on to friends!

This is a great recipe! Didn't Didn't mash the cauliflower and added crumbled bacon but otherwise followed the recipe. The ingredients combined so well for a flavorful way to eat veggies. Served with broiled salmon. The meal needed nothing else!

Made this tonight. Very good. I did make a couple of changes, I don't really use onion or garlic powder and I don't think I can get ranch dressing mix in Iceland so I used dill weed and wild thyme. I also added some more cheese and since I had some mushrooms I fried them and put them on top in the end. 

Not the same recipe at all, of course but this is neutral in itself so one can be adventurous with the spices and stuff. Will make again, probably change the spices around a bit then, too.

This was excellent!  My husband and I are trying to cut back (not eliminate, but cut back) on our carb intake and substituted this for my whipped potatoes with dinner and both LOVED it.  I made it with the exact same ingredients but whipped with my blender instead of mashing.  Wonderful!

OMG, this is delicious.  By the time I was ready to set up and take my cute little picture after a couple of scoops, my picky eater of a son ate it all.  I did not change a thing, this is an awesome recipe (and looks pretty).

I am having this now.  Used full fat sour cream and cheese, and topped with ghee rather than butter.  My main change was that I used frozen cauliflower, a pound sized bag.  I didn't measure, as fresh veg tends to be different sizes, so I just added "about" the same amounts of everything.  This does need some salt and pepper, but mine came out browned on top and yummy.  I'll make this one again but add bacon next time.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was good in theory but lacked in flavor. Made this for Christmas Eve dinner and mostly was just pushed around on plate. Would add more cheese, more spice to taste, salt and pepper to taste, bacon bits, chives, just play with it! And make sure it is hot when served, i let mine get room temperature....big mistake!

I made it into a complete meal because low carb is never a solution to a good health at the end of the day (such as for weight loss, carbs are number one source of energy, it controls blood sugar balances etc, so please just make better whole foods options and eliminate processed, canned, and so on foods. Please avoid margarine and canola oil, read up articles and google it for more info). So i added some overnight soaked white kidney beans (up to you whatever bean you prefer), added some black pepper and some nutritional yeast, and then before the final mix to add into the baking pan, i chopped up some fresh cilantro, curly parsley (or italian is ok too), and oregano yumm! Choice of butter is ok, as long as you do not use margarine or canola oil instead

I would call this Cauliflower Soufflé .... because I puréed all the ingredients and then baked it in the oven.  I also made a few changes to the recipe ... I substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream (more protein), I omitted the bacon and sprinkled paprika and pepper on the top before baking it.

This is a very delicious and super easy recipe.  I made a few modifications that I thought would improve it a bit.  Instead of steaming the cauliflower, I tossed it with olive oil and salt and baked it at 375 until it was soft and slightly crisped and brown on top.  Then transferred to a baking dish with a generous serving of sour cream mixed in... enough to coat everything, then shredded colby jack cheese mixed in and sprinkled on top.  Baked until everything was melty and slightly browned on top.  I could eat a whole casserole dish of this. lol.

Great substitute for potatoes when observing a low carb diet. To me all of these cauliflower faux potato dishes still taste like cauliflower, this one is one of the best at convincing you that maybe that isn't a bad thing.

Delicious! Kept it simple with just cauliflower, sour cream, cheese, garlic, and added about 2T of mayo and a dash of red pepper flakes for a kick. Did not mash. Next time I will probably double and add chicken and turn into a main dish.  Adding this to my favorites. Thank you!

I thought it was good- I would just love more specifics in the recipe. There is variation in the sizes of heads of cauliflower and it didn't say how small to chop it either. I guessed right and had success using a big head of cauliflower and chopping the pieces to about bite-sized.  I also topped it with green onions and added Lawry's garlic salt.

I wanted to like this. I just didn't. Nothing stood out to me as to why.... almost bland tasting. I think if I played around with recipe I could get it to my liking. Was easy to make.... microwaved Cauliflower florets. Drained well, didn't mash, mixed wet ingredients then folded in Cauliflower. Easy. Bummed. Had high hopes. Just my preference, but maybe you'll like it.

This was a nice change from mashed potatoes. .  I used light sour cream and omitted the butter to save on a few calories, but, it was still full of flavor from the seasonings.  I topped with some green onions.

I thought this was excellent! I followed the recipe for the most part except I usually don't measure seasonings and just throw them in and do a taste teste. I never thought that cauliflower could have the creamy consistency that is so close to mashed potatoes. Thank you for this wonderful recipe. Definitely a keeper!

Amazing! I added American cheese and "mashed" the cauliflower in the food processor once it was steamed.  It got rave reviews from my friend and her 4 yr old AND my hubby who doesn't really care for cauliflower.  Definite do again!

I made this with a small head of cauliflower. I steamed it first till very soft, using just a little water because cooked cauliflower is already watery. Then I mashed it with the butter and followed the rest of the recipe. (I used a clove of garlic instead of the powder.)  I used the amounts given in the recipe but didn't measure the Ranch or salt and pepper, just added them to taste. I topped it with crumbled cooked bacon and more cheddar. 

It was pretty popular at dinner, getting completely eaten up. We did wish for chives or green onions on top. My only complaint is that I still thought the cauliflower was watery. Next time I'll try microwaving it until it's very soft. I suspect you could use frozen cauliflower, and I'm sure this would also be good if you didn't mash the cauliflower but just layered everything in a pan. A versatile recipe one can easily adjust to taste.

This was excellent! Instead of a head of cauliflower I used two steamer bags of frozen cauliflower. The only other change I made was to add bacon bits because to me, "loaded" isn't "loaded" without them. I think next time I will increase the ranch seasoning and not mash the cauliflower. I cooked it for 30 minutes, but next time I will cook it for 45. This recipe is a winner!

This was really good.  My guy doesn't care for cauliflower but enjoyed this.  I'll double the recipe next time.  I topped with a sprinkle of cheese and garlic chives.

Delicious. Easy to make. Great side dish. Healthier than potatoes too, which my family eats a lot of. Wonderful substitute.

I used your recipe as a guide!  My husband hates califlower, but I LOVE it.  So-- I needed to find a recipe that my husband would not recognize as califlower, but think it was Double baked mashed potatoes.

  Listed below is my recipe:


1 large bag of  broken up Cauliflower (boil in water and drain)


3 very, very small red potatoes (skinned) and cubed (boil in same pot of water with Cauliflower) drain.


1 brick of cream cheese (softened at room temperature)


shredded Colby/Jack cheese (you decide how much)


Butter (as much as you need or like)


Adobe seasoning


Emeri Lagasse (Bam) seasoning


Green Onions (chopped)




After draining the cooked (boiled) califlower and potatoes, mash ONLY the potatoes while in the pot.  Fold in the sole brick of cream cheese  ; and  Colby/Jack cheese into the same pot .    

Add Butter, Adobe and Emeril Lagasse seasoning and chopped green onions.   Mix all together and pour in baking dish.  Bake no more than 40 minutes in oven 350degees.  

It tastes like twice baked mashed potatoes!  My husband did not know it was califlower!  An excellent dish for low carb meals.  I did not provide any measurements of seasonings, as some people who cook , can eyeball it , or taste as they season which all good cooks always do.  !! The only time I measure is if I bake desserts which require a special formula for good results.  Hope everyone enjoys my recipe which has less salt  than the other one that was given.

I doubled the recipe and made is for Easter dinner. I did add mozzarella and made the top half cheddar half mozzarella. It was a huge hit! When I told everyone it was cauliflower and mashed potatoes they were shocked. Awesome recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Very good tasting.  However, my kids still complained that it was cauliflower.   So for me, it didn't wow me enough to make it worth all the extra calories.  It definitely is a way to change things up though with good flavor to boot!

I made half the recipe since it was just my husband and myself. Instead of the full fat versions, I used light sour cream and 2% milk cheddar cheese. Very good!! I think it could have used a little more salt for my taste. I added some when it was on my plate and it made all

I made this as directed and it was pretty good but since then, I've make a slightly lighter version of this. I substitute Greek yogurt for the sour cream and use lite cheddar cheese. I also cut up a bunch of scallions and a Roma tomato. I also add garlic salt because I feel it's under seasoned. Finally I use cooking spray before adding it to the casserole, and top with a few bacon bits and feta cheese (maybe 2 tbs of each).  The whole family loves this.

I think this recipe will vary depending on the size of the head of Cauliflower.  I followed the directions exactly the way they are and found it bland and very dry.  I had a fairly large head of cauliflower so I probably should have adjusted the other ingredients accordingly.

Made this once as written and it was tasty but needed a "zing.'  Then made again with some fine chopped onions, doubled Ranch Dressing, doubled cheese, onion powder and added a T of minced garlic and it became a 5.   Is also good cold for lunch.

I halved this and used plain Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. I did not mash this; I preferred small, bite-sized pieces. I also found this dish to be very rich. I added some chopped scallions to the mixture and on top afterwards, along with some crumbled bacon. I also melted the butter and mixed it with crushed Ritz crackers and used that as a topping. My own personal tastes, I can see sauteed chopped onions working great here, too. GO PATS!!! JUST ONE MORE!!!

Very good!   Here's what I did:   Cooked about 4 slices worth of chopped bacon.  Removed bacon bits and set aside.  Chopped cauliflower and sautéed in bacon fat with a small chopped onion and 1T minced garlic.    Reduced heat to low, covered and let cook until tender.  Stirred in onion powder and garlic powder.  Omitted ranch because I don't like all those chemicals in my food.  Combined cheese with sour cream and bacon, stirred into cauliflower and then threw the pan into the oven to brown.  Delicious!

This was good! I'd never had mashed cauliflower before. I sprinkled a little extra cheese on top during the last ten minutes of baking. I did a rough mashing of the cauliflower. It was more of a coarse crumbly texture than smooth. I'd definitely make this again.

A little too much cheese - I halved the amount and it was good.  I will make it again.

No changes and yes we love it. Cauliflower to me has an unusual acidic taste, but this recipe makes it taste just wonderful! Great side dish! Thank you!

I have never made a cauliflower recipe I didn't like, until I made this one. The only change I made was to sprinkle additional cheddar cheese on the top. That ended up being the best part of the recipe. The melted cheddar cheese got crunchy and it was yummy. The rest of the dish was very dry. It definitely needed more sauce. Flavor was lacking.  I did not care for the tang of the sour cream in this recipe. Just not a good choice for my tastes. It is not a recipe that will go into my file.

3 kids ate it right up. Microwaved the cauliflower, mashed it, and was impressed with the texture. This will go into  the meal rotation!

I don't think I steamed the cauliflower long enough because the consistency wasn't great - but I wasn't thrilled with the overall flavor either.  I think I'd use more cheese and maybe some bacon to make it really like a loaded baked potato.  I wish there was a way to thicken up the consistency.  I'll try it again though - thank you!

I'm sure that the recipe is wonderful as written ~ and I had every intention on making it as written... but then things went a little haywire, lol. 
I added a handful of fresh scallions, a handful of French fried onions and some chopped bacon to the mash. Omg - it's HEAVENLY. Thanks for the starter recipe!!

I did not used any butter. Used1/4 cup Greek plain yogurt n I used 1/3 cup of mayo n 1/3 cup sour cream but would like to try ranch dressing mix next time instead of mayo also added 2 slices of bacon crumbleed up and used 3 chopped green onions instead of onion powder. Added 1 cup of cheese to sour cream mix n then added other 1 cup on top of mix with Another 2 chopped bacon slices on top..

Love this recipe, I use a spicy cheese and add bacon pieces. It's 
A meal in itself. I always steam fresh garlic with the cauliflower.
I highly recommend it

This dish was awesome! I did not have regular cheddar so I used Tex Mex shredded cheese instead. It has a little zip to it which was fine by me. I will definitely make this one on a regular basis.

I was a bit skeptical about this but had some cauliflower that needed to be used so I gave it a try. Wow it's really good. I followed the directions as written and was not sorry. Just a not that I prepared this ahead of time and put it in the fridge and we got busy and it didn't get cooked for 3 days. It was still delicious so you could make this up ahead of time for an event.

This is the easiest cauliflower dish to make.   My hubby and I  ate it all in two sittings.  I will make it again using different cheeses for a gourmet taste.

Made exactly as directed.  Family loved it, even the one who does't  like cauliflower!  My grandson asked if I could make this for THANKSGIVING.  Nice change from the usual creamed cauliflower.  Next time I am going to add onions too.

Loved this!  Did not steam or mash just cut up small and baked it in all the ingredients listed!  Delish!  In the oven for about 40 - 45 mins.  Had no ranch mix so used a good squirt of ranch dressing, very yummy!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but was disappointed.  I steamed the cauliflower a day ahead of time and stored it in the refrigerator in a bowl layered between paper towels to absorb any additional moisture.  Everything looked good when I combined all the ingredients, but after baking, the sauce was very thin and pooling in the bottom of the baking dish, rather than nicely coating the cauliflower.  I’m glad I tried it, but won’t be making it again.

This was delish.  I usually use greek yogurt instead of sour cream...but I didn't even have that...so I used mayo. I hate when people change things then rate it...but I was so anxious to make this...now I'm guilty. Next time (and there WILL be a next time)...I will make it as written.  Excellent!!!

Nice recipe.  After steaming, I finely chopped the cauliflower, and added my own preferred seasonings instead of the ranch dressing mix: dried basil, parsley, oregano, salt  and pepper.  I also added diced crispy bacon, and blended the cheese into the mixture.  Topped with buttered bread crumbs for a nice crunch.  Timing and balance of ingredients were right on.  Next time I will try with lower fat Greek yogurt and other considerations, to reduce the fat impact!

We thought this was good.  I'm not a fan of cauliflower but I get in my weekly veggie box sometimes and thought I give this a recipe a try.  I would make it again.

i can't remember if i reviewed this.  made it a few weeks ago for the 3rd time.  it's fabulous.  after the cauliflower is cooked, i don't mash it but rather chop it into little bits.  followed the recipe other than adding a touch of dried dill dip as i didn't have any ranch.  guests loved it as did i.

This is a great recipe. My husband & I are on the South Beach Diet and this recipe is a great substitute for potatoes. I did tweak it a bit based on other reviews such as using Greek yogurt  and low fat Tex mex cheese, but otherwise same  same. Will be making this lots.

I completely forgot to add the ranch dressing, but this was still really good!  Both boys (young and not-so-much) liked it--the nine-year-old went crazy over it!  Imagine how much he'll like it when I remember the child whisperer, ranch dressing. :)  Will definitely be making this again; in permanent rotation.

It was delicious.  It just took a little longer than I would have liked to steam the cauliflower.  Maybe I had too much for the pan.  It also didn't mash so I cut it up in small pieces.

Husband said "make it again", 10 year old didn't know she was eating cauliflower. ??  I didn't have the ranch dressing, so I added some salt,  mixed the butter in with everything else and topped with cheese (blend of cheddar, mozzarella and Monterey Jack). Only baked for 15 minutes - delish!

The only change I would make is to add more sour cream,  grated cheese and add salt and pepper. I just felt like it needed more flavor to it. My husband really liked it.

I made this for my dad and he loved it! He counts carbs and honestly, it's hard I tell these aren't mashed potatoes. The only changes I made were to add chopped bacon bits and chopped green onion to give some color and more "loaded" taste. I chopped about 4 slices of cooked bacon and added the green parts of two small green onions. I also subbed the sour cream with plain Greek yogurt. It came out great. I will be making this again.  Thank you for this recipe! :)

It was definetly good, the only issue I had was that I couldn't get the cauliflower mashed into a smooth texture like mashed potatoes. I think next time instead of steaming the cauliflower I'll boil it until it's soft and then try to mash it.

I didn't have any ranch dip so made it without. This is only the second time I've made anything with cauliflower and it was pretty good. I did add green onions as one of the reviewers recommended because of not having the ranch.

Really easy and delicious.  I didn't have sour cream so I substituted some cream cheese.  Very tasty!

Only left out the onion powder because I was out of it.  Mashed the cauliflower quite coarse.  Hubby and I both enjoyed it and I will make it again (with the onion powder).

I made this recipe for a family gathering and it was well received.  I did not modify the recipe.  The consistency of the cauliflower did not resemble mashed potatoes, which is just fine with me.  I used a hand masher, but could have easily used a food processor or hand blender to achieve more of a mashed potato consistency.

I made a lighter version using just light sour cream, chives, garlic powder, and some shredded cheese into the slightly mashed cauliflower. Didn't bake it. Delicious!

I started with a 21/2 lb head of cauliflower, used fat-free plain yogurt, upped the ranch mix to 1 T, and skipped the butter.  Served along side a buffalo sauced chicken breast and it was an instant hit with my BF!

This was good flavor-wise but not all that great texturally.  People seem to love mashed cauliflower so I thought I would give it another try- unfortunately I'm just not a fan.

I have quite the aversion to cauliflower but I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. It did not taste at all like what I expected but it was pretty good! I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream and I added bacon but otherwise followed the recipe. I was unable to turn mine into a mash so mine became more of a crumble but again it still tasted fine.

Everyone in my family and all the friends I've made this for loved it!  Cauliflower is really low in carbs so a great sub for potatoes.  I made a few changes just because of necessity and it worked great! I don't have onion powder or garlic powder because I use the real thing!   So I pressed one clove garlic into mixture and instead of cheddar cheese, which I love, I only had the Costco mexican mix of shredded cheese and that worked out great!  I also always double the recipe if I have 4 or more people ;)

Turned out great! Didn't have the ranch dressing powder so poured low fat blue cheese dressing on top- definitely a keeper.

Was quite nice. Cooked cauliflower until just tender so it had a rice consistency when mashed. Added homemade ranch dressing seasoning mix. Made only one change - added cooked diced bacon and onion (instead of onion powder). Didn't feel it needed the butter on top. Might use fresh minced garlic next time instead of garlic powder. Thanks for the recipe.

Sooooo good!  I didn't have any garlic or onion powder or ranch dressing powder, so instead I minced fresh garlic and threw in salt and pepper.  I also didn't mash the cauliflower because my husband likes to eat the cauliflower whole.  Will definitely make again and again!  Oh and I used frozen cauliflower - will try fresh cauliflower next time to see if it makes much of a difference

Made it exactly how the recipe goes my husband loved it and couldn't stop eating it however me on the other hand found it a little bland I like a lot of flavor in my food. I added salt and more butter to mine. Il also double the bacon and cheese next time I gave this 5 stars because my husband loves it

This turned out really good! Thankfully, I doubled recipe because it wouldn't have been enough for 4 of us.  Instead of steaming on stove, I microwaved cauliflower for 7 min stirring half way through.  Used light sour cream, only  1/2 of ranch mix, no onion powder and no butter.  I think this helped in cutting down on the 'richness.'  We really loved this dish!

Very good. Versatile, can do a lot with it. My daughter made it and she is "by the letter" on recipes so she didn't add any salt or pepper. Definitely needs some. Added after it was done and it was fine. Will make again for sure.

I made this for my family and we all loved it!  I did change it just a bit, I didn't mash the cauliflower I left it in chunks.  I didn't use dried Ranch but I mixed in Hidden Valley dressing with sour cream and chives, salt, pepper, garlic salt, chopped green onion and shredded cheese.  Mixed that all in with the cauliflower and baked it.  Yummy!

I used Johnny's garlic seasoning and Victorian epicure three onion mix and mango curry. With the addition of a cup of chick peas for protein. Yummy.

Really good. It reminds me of a cheesy potato casserole we'd make a lot at potlucks growing up. I followed it as is.

I really liked this.  Ensure you make enough of the sour cream/cheese mixture to make it moist.  I think next time I would put on extra cheese and a crumb topping.  I did add some Parmesan to the mixture, and I did not mash it because I like the consistency of cauliflower.  I kept the florets small.  Yummy!

I didn't have ranch, so I used bacon salt. The teenage boys and my hubby loved it. I didn't think it was anything special. I did double up on the heads of cauliflower and added a bit more sour cream since I was using the bacon salt. 
Trying with ranch next time.

I pretty much followed the directions. We must have small cauliflower heads here. I could see that it was not going to be moist enough so I doubled the cheese and sour cream and spices. Still came out dry and barely enough for 2 servings. I says cook til bubbling, but there is nothing to bubble. This one goes in the 'do not repeat' file.

I did not have dressing mix, so I substituted real dressing. I also did not mash the cauliflower, rather I left in small flowerets, so this dish resembled hash browns instead of mashed potatoes. Turned out great!

I made this for the second time tonight and it is delicious! Today I used my hand blender to get the cauliflower smoother and while it's not the exact same consistency of potatoes, it's still wonderful. Like some other reviewers, I topped it with a bit of extra cheese and some chopped fresh parsley which added color more than anything. I'll be making this for years to come!

This was ok, but a little disappointing. It looked just like the pic and did have flavor, but I'll have to work on it to jazz it up some. The only thing I did differently was add some chopped bacon I had in the fridge. Glad I did too! I'll try it again with some green onion, more bacon, and more cheese. That kind of negates the healthy aspect of this but as a base it was solid. Very easy and well, my wife and I did eat all of it...Oh, and it doesn't need to be mashed, just broken up.

What a great dish! Made it for the first time tonight and I was surprised at how easy it was to prepare. I boiled the cauliflower instead of steaming it (as I don't have a steamer) which still made the cauliflower soft enough to mash. I also added an extra layer of cheese on top before popping it in the oven to give it that extra cheesy flair.
