I added some shredded carrots and diced up a jalepeno to add.  That made it PERFECT because otherwise it would have been too sweet.  It gave it a bite (but one my 2 year old could handle) and the sauce toned down the jalepeno.  The sauce is pretty thick but still good.  We had it over white rice.  I only had 3/4 cup of pineapple juice, so I added apple juice to make it the right amount.

SUPER EASY AND SUPER QUICK MEAL.  I bought 1# of Virginia Baked Ham at the grocery store deli when it was on sale and cubed it for this recipe.  NOTE:  there is not enough pineapple juice in the can of chunks - you will have to add real juice or open extra pineapple - I stir fried the ham, pineapple and onions till they started to brown - which made it have more of grilled taste.  We ate it over white rice and it was delicious!

Not bad, but make sure you plan on eating it all in one sitting as it is very starchy textured as a leftover.  If I ever make it again I think i'd use less cornstarch and just make it thicker by heating it longer... Did not have any green onions at the time, so used half a small white onion. I added frozen brocolli and green peas, and served this over brown and wild rice cooked with veggie broth. I also used a stone ground dijon mustard.  Was a good sweet flavor and the lover of ham and pineapple (separately) in the house loved it :)

I really hate to give someone's recipe a bad review but for me it just didn't cut it.  Some people say that the sauce is too sweet but all I could taste was the vinegar.  I was really looking forward to making this recipe based on most of the reviews, unfortunately it just didn't turn out that good.  I followed the recipe for the sauce exactly and added chunks of green pepper and onions with the ham and pineapple.

Really easy to make.  I made this while camping, and the ham was the only special "cooler" item required.  A great camping meal, quick, easy, and it tasted great.

This recipe was super and delicious. I changed a few things. Add 1-1/2C raisins,increase constarch to 3T for a thicker sauce, marinate over low heat for at least 2 hours for wonderful pineapple-raisin sauce.This will give the juices time to soften the ingredients (onions,cubed ham,& pineapple).Serve over thin spaghetti.A great find. My wife loved it! Dave

I made this exactly as the recipe.  I thought it was delicious, my husband didn't complain but found it a little sweet.  Will definitely make this again the next time I have leftover ham.  It was very quick with nice presentation.

THIS WAS VERY TASTY.  I USED THE SMOKED BUTT OF HAM THAT I HAD THE PREVIOUS DAY. THIS IS A HAM THAT YOU SIMMER IN WATER AND COMES IN A CASING. I THINK IT IS PERFECT FOR THIS LEFTOVER MEAL BECAUSE THE HAM IS SO EASY TO CUT INTO CUBES BECAUSE IT IS A THICKER PIECE WHEN YOU SLICE IT DOWN. I REMOVED THE THIN SKIN AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE SLICES BEFORE CUTTING THEM INTO CUBES.  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD IF YOU CAN CALL IT THAT IS I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE ENOUGH PINEAPPLE JUICE WHEN I DRAINED THE CHUNKS; BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE SO I HAD TO DROP DOWN ON SOME OF THE OTHER INGREDIENTS AND I DID NOT HAVE AS MUCH SAUCE AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED BUT IT WAS A DELICIOUS SAUCE.  THE NEXT TIME I MAKE IT I WILL HAVE SOME PINEAPPLE JUICE ON HAND SO THAT I CAN MAKE IT ACCORDING TO THE ORIG. RECIPE.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS GREAT WAY TO USE LEFTOVER HAM.

Everyone in my family loved this dish - including my two toddlers! Easy to make and very yummy! I added some diced red onion and only used 3 teaspoons of the vinegar.

This was great and EASY!  I chopped the ham ahead of time and froze it which cut down on my time.  I used 2 20oz cans of pineapple.  Using both of the cans for juice made the  required ammount and then I used one can for in the dish and put the other can in the fridge to eat later.  I liked having more pineapple in the dish.  But my toddler liked and it and I liked the sweet taste to it.  I served with rolls and a vegatable..Great job!  LOved it.

I was looking for a way to use some of the leftover ham from Easter and tried this out.  I used fresh pineapple cause that's what I had, some chicken stock cause I didn't have enough pineapple juice, and omitted the mustard.  Also I used a yellow onion instead of the green.  It was easy and the flavor was ok.  Good way to use leftovers.

Absolutely loved this recipe.  This was the first food I've ever cooked from this site and it was a terrific hit.  When I first made this dinner a pineapple chunk tried to kill me because when I bit down it squirted the back of my throat and had me choking for a while.  Thus I resolved to cut the pineapple into smaller chunks next time.  the second time around tasted even better than the first!  this is a must make for that leftover ham.... :)

This was alright, I didn't see the need for the vinegar in the sauce, the smell of it turned my toddlers against eating it and they will usually try just about anything. I will omit that the next time I try this. I would use crushed pineapple instead of chinks next time also, the chunks were a bit much. I may try one of the other reviewer's suggestion and add other veggies. All in all a decent recipe, not A+ for our family, but one that we may try again, with a few tweeks.

This was an excellent meal.  I served over white rice, and added in some frozen bell peppers with the onions.  (I just used yellow onions, so the pepper added nice color also.)  I think I'd like to try it with chicken also. =)

Great recipe! I did make a few changes to it though. I used red sweet onions as opposed to the green onions. And for the sauce, I used a little less than a cup of pineapple juice than came from the can I used. I also used 1 tablespoon of flour as I did not have corn starch on hand. It looked pretty unappealing when mixing it, but after adding it to the sauted ham and pineapple, it cooked up very quickly. Great recipe though. My boyfriend and I loved it!

I found a package of ham in the freezer when I set out to find a recipe to use it up with ingredients I had at home.  This was a quick and easy dinner.  I made as written but added some red, yellow and orange peppers that also needed to be used.  The results were a nice filling dinner that I served over hot white and 'Microwave Corn on the Cob' from this site.  This recipe reheated well the next day for leftovers.

Made this yummy dish last night, and my family of 6 loved it!  I cut the vinegar to 2 tsp. after reading other reviews, and I also increased the pineapple chucks to 2 cans (which gave me the 1 1/2 c. juice).  I found that to be the perfect balance for the ham, especially since my kids love pineapple!  Served over rice.  will definitely make this EASY again...maybe with our Easter leftover ham!

Excellent dish. I had a can of pineapple rings, squeezed the juice out of the rings, chunking them and getting just enough juice to meet the recipe. didn't have ACV, so used 2 T Red Wine Vinegar instead and it seemed to work just as well. Served over quinoa and it was devoured!

This is a very simple way to add a jolt of variety to our menu options.  I added a picture and as you can see, I added green pepper chunks too.  Other changes I had to use:  dehydrated diced onion at the saute phase, fresh pineapple, Pina Colada fusion juice, and regular vinegar.  Weight Watcher's calculation is 7 PP and that includes the brown rice.  Making this again!

My husband loved it, but he'll eat anything. It was a super easy recipe, but I didn't like eating it. Way too sweet and way too tart. I kept trying to add Soy sauce or something to it and I just couldn't finish my plate, which is UNLIKE me! Maybe it's just my taste, but I won't make it again.

Easy, quick and delicious! Added green peppers but omitted the onions. Had to only use 3/4 cup pineapple juice, that's all that was in the can. Only wish I had rice to serve it over.

Very good, my kids and husband loved it! Even my son who won't normally eat ham. We doubled the recipe so it took twice as long to stirfry and we left out the onion and used white vinigar and it was still really good, will be making again.

Easy and delicious, a perfect quick family meal, and one of the best uses of leftover ham I have found.  I added sliced carrots and served over rice.

I thought this recipe was great.  Easy, quick and a great way to use leftover ham.  My husband devoured it and took the rest for lunch the next day.  Unfortunately, my kids didn't like it at all.  Will probably make again, but slightly decrease vinegar and cornstarch.

I was really excited to try this one, but am slightly disappointed. It was decent, but not nearly as good as I had hoped. Definitely could taste the vinegar, which I did not like, and I actually thought it could have used a tad more brown sugar. It was wasn't awesome tasting like it had sounded. But very easy to make.

As a busy mom of two boys with little spare time, this recipe is on my #1 list!!!  I only had a 20 oz. can of pineapple chunks, but that was o.k. because it JUST gave me the 1 1/3 c. of juice that was needed (squeeze, squeeze, squeeze! and if that doesn't work, add a little water!)...plus, I threw in the extra pineapple even thoughh it was a bit too much, knowing my kids would eat them right up!  Served it over instant brown rice.  While it was a tiny bit bland in flavor, we all still really loved it.  Not a "knock your socks" off recipe, as others have said, but a SUPER easy, delicious one that makes dinner a no brainer!  A mom friendly recipe that's a definate keeper!

We all loved it. Instead of using ham, we used turkey ham which my husband is very fond of. We didn't cube it either. We sliced it in about 3/4" slices. We will be making this again and again.

This recipe was a very good way to use the leftover ham from Christmas dinner. I made two substitutions. I used regular white cooking onions and the pineapple juice from from the pineapple chunks with some pink grapefruit juice added to make the volume needed.  This recipe was good served over rice and I think that the sauce would be good with other meats as a sweet and sour sauce.  Thanks!

Yummy!  I used a 20 oz can of pineapple tidbits.  The tidbits were the perfect size for this recipe.   I chopped a half of a green bell pepper and stir fried that for a few minutes before adding the ham, onions and pineapple.  I only had 1 cup of pineapple juice so added 1/3 cup unsweetened grape juice.  After reading the reviews, I only used half the cider vinegar called for and I am glad I did.  Defiinitely a keeper for us to use up leftover ham.

This is one of our favorite meals to use leftover ham for.  It tastes great.  My kids love it as do my husband and I.  Very rarely are there leftovers and if there are I have to hide them in the back of the fridge to get them.  I make the recipe as it is written with the exception of butter (I use a little oil instead) and I use flour instead of cornstarch.

While this is similar to an Asian sweet and sour dish, I liked the twist that it's served over egg noodles.  I had some Creole mustard and used it instead of yellow mustard.  We both thought it was a tasty and different dish, and it's an easy and great way to use leftover ham.  A refreshing change from the ham-cheese-potatos ham dishes.

Really quite good; I give it high marks for how easy it is (I served it with leftover rice, so all the prep work was already done). The family ate it without complaint. It isn't a knock-your-socks-off recipe, but very nice nonetheless. I will make it again.

I also found it to be soupy, though after 15 minutes it did cook down.  I found it to be delicious and quick.  I did however add 1/3 cup sugar, 1/8 vinegar, and 2 T of Soy Sauce to further accent the sweet and sour taste.  I stirred the mix in with egg noodles, which made the soupiness less noticeable.

I liked this recipe. Ham and pineapple go together really well.  We had it over rice, which was good.  The only problem I had was mine turned out a bit soupy -- I may adjust the sauce proportions next time to make it seem meatier.  Good recipe!

This was good, but I found myself wanting to add something else (just not sure what!).  It was so quick to make, so that's a plus for a weeknight dinner.  Sweet and tasty but not a big flavor profile.

I thought this was easy and tasty...though not great. DH said he'd rather have his ham as ham. Ha. That's his personal preference and is not a real consideration for this rating. I'm not sure what I would do to improve it.

Before making this dish I read the comments. Some people thought it was too sweet. A good cook will start  with less and taste. It's like making a simple cocktail. Some folks like them sweet and some like them sour. In this recipe the sweet is the sugar and the sour is the vinegar. If you taste it while you make it, it's not possible to give this recipe a poor rating. I thought the comment adding some raisins was excellent and I also added a tablespoon of orange liqueur. I seldom follow recipes as printed. They are just "starting points".

I used honey instead of the brown sugar, spicy brown mustard and 2 tsp of grapefruit balsamic instead of the apple cider vinegar.  It was still sweet, but not overly so.  A definite keeper for leftover ham.

Wonderful. I usually have all the ingredients on hand except the green onion so I used sweet onion. Worked great!  My pineapple can had exactly 1 1/3 cups juice. Fabulous!

Very yummy, and super easy!  Sweet, but not overly.  I didn't have any brown sugar (oops) so I used honey instead.  Like I always do with anything that calls for butter, I used Parkay spray instead because it has no fat, no calories.  I'll make this again for sure, looking forward to digging into the leftovers! :)

I liked it - should have read more reviews about the vinegar. I did add some hot peppers, carrots and green peppers. Look forward to fixing again cutting the vinegar, I will try lemon juice, so far lemons have not offended my husband for sour.

Instead of green onions, I used 1 diced yellow onion.
I used 1/2 diced red pepper & 1/2 diced yellow pepper. ONLY USED 3 tsps of CIDER VINEGAR. Then I followed the other ingredients exactly. And I followed the recipes directions.
My family calls this version-
Hawaiian Ham & Rice

I’m really glad I had the excess Christmas ham! Very good recipe. My ham was spiral-sliced so I just chopped it into pieces since I couldn’t cube it. The dish doesn’t look as nice as the pictures with the cubes, but it was very good. I added a splash of red pepper for a little zip with all the sweetness. Will be having this again.

The sauce took longer to thicken than I thought and made too much of it so I would probably cut back on the pineapple juice quantity. I also added cashews. Other than that It was delicious.

I wanted a lighter version of this recipe so I left out the brown sugar and cornstarch. I reduced the apple cider vinegar to 1 tbsp, used a sweet onion instead of scallions, added another tbsp of butter.  I added a bit of green pepper and sauteed them with the onion, then added the cut-up ham, pineapple chunks, and juice and heated everything through. I served it atop steamed rice and the "sauce" mixed nicely with it.  I'll make this again!!

I liked the idea of this for leftover ham. I wish the recipe had mentioned that there would not be enough pineapple juice in the canned pineapple.  I used orange juice which took away from the pineapple flavour.   I added 3 tablespoons of soy sauce to balance out the sweet and sour and a clove of garlic. If I make it again I will use a regular onion and use the green onion as a garnish. I also put the pineapple in the pan first to reduce the juice and even brown it a little, then I added the other vegetables using olive oil instead of butter.

Next time I think I'll add halved cherry tomatoes and green peppers.  I split the recipe in half to serve two but I should have made more to have leftovers. Very good!

Yummy - Added chunks of bell pepper, onion and carrot, reduced the sugar a bit - served over sushi rice - a great hit, and one of the Grands' favorite dinners at Mamaw's house :)
One of these days, I just might share their dead-drop favorite "Mamaw Lunch"!

I made this for house dinner.  Three of my housemates liked it a lot, though I personally found it very sweet.  I think I could have left all of the sugar out and just let the pineapple be the sweetness. 

I cooked in a cup of broccoli, 1 cup of shredded carrots, 1 cup of shredded red cabbage, a handful of mushrooms,  and 1 whole red onion.

 I served this over half quinoa, half white rice cooked in a rice cooker with a heaping spoonful of coconut oil = coconut rice.

This is awesome! I drained the pineapple well and used unsweetened pineapple juice and used only about two teaspoons of starch. This is a favorite...

This was great. I was afraid it would be too sweet but it was just right. I did make minor modifications. I added a jalapeño pepper, reduced the vinegar to 1 TBS, and added more mustard. It was a great way to use leftover ham. Delish!

A winner when searching for a recipe for leftover Christmas ham. Since I was cooking for one I adjusted the servings to two. I was short on green onions so added some sweet onion and half a yellow pepper otherwise kept ingredients as listed.  The juice from the canned pineapple was the right amount and I did not find this extra sweet at all. Will make again.

I needed a quick but homemade meal and all I had going was a pot of brown rice. This recipe was PERFECT and SO easy! I was only required to make one change since I didn't have any green onions. I used sliced, regular onion. My young children enjoyed it and my six year old even helped prepare it. This will definitely be a regular in our house. Thanks!

After reading other comments, I only used 3 tsp vinegar, 4 tsp corn starch and added 1/2 tsp grated ginger (may add more next time),  some carrots shredded and used frozen onion in place of the green onion.  I thought it still wou;d be too sweet, but it was delicious on brown rice.

I made this recipe in approximately a double quantity, to use up ham leftovers. I also added chunks of onion and bell pepper to make it like a sweet & sour Chinese dish.  It was very good.  My husband thought the sauce was a bit too sour, & perhaps a bit less vinegar or a bit more brown sugar would remedy that. My impression was that it was much like a sweet & sour sauce. I will repeat.

Thought I was going to make it exactly as directed-- but I only had purple onions which I  used.   Also I use the juice from the canned pineapple instead of "pineapple juice " and  I only had a cup of that  so I threw in a third of a cup of orange juice .    I tasted it and thought it was wonderful until I realized I had left the mustard out ; and I started to skip it but I'm so glad I didn't .   I  used spicy brown mustard and it was perfect.  I also cooked mine longer because I wanted the pineapple chunks to soften up.  Quick meal that I had ready to send home with granddaughter  when my son  picked her up.  DIL raved about how delicious it was.  Double bonus for me:  love to cook but even more fulfilling knowing that my 40-somethings son and DIL have a home-cooked meal waiting for them.

Made this with pineapple in its own juice it wasn't to sweet. Family liked it and a good way to use use all that ham. Only thing I would do different next time would be to add some fresh ginger, to add another dimension to the taste.

I had been looking for this recipe for years.  I must confess  I used mini peppers , Celery, carrots and topped  with slivered almonds.   Just trying to get too many vegetables in all my dishes.  I added light sodium soy sauce in the sauce.  Thank you for sharing. Yummy ,leftovers too!!

I LOVED THIS.  I didn't have enough pineapple juice so I used  chicken broth to thin out the starch overload.  Worked out! I used regular cooking onion instead of green onion.  I think this recipe is easy and tasty.  Perfect for after a long day of work.

This was so easy to make.  A perfect way to use those ham leftovers.  Everyone at the table enjoyed it and it wasn't too sweet as some reviewers have said. This will definitely be used again next time I make a ham.

I really enjoyed it.   Though I did not think it was quite sweet enough so I added a Tbsp. of brown sugar and a sprinkle of salt.  It was delicious.  I love the addition of mustard.   Also, it calls for a lot of cornstarch to thicken it so be careful when heating it up so it does not get too thick.

This is so easy and quite good! Think sweet and sour ham. I did add veggies. I first sauteed bell peppers, onions, and broccoli in butter (and added a little ginger-garlic paste). I only used 3 TBSP of the cider vinegar, and did serve over rice. What a great way to use leftover ham, and it made a quick and easy and yummy dinner. 
I'm considering making this as a freezer meal in the future. (Throw everything in a bag and freeze. Cook in crockpot later.) I'm sure it will be slightly different, but definitely worth the try!

The only changes I made was to add chunks of sweet onion and I sautéed the sweet onion and ham together first. Then I dumped all the ingredients into a crockpot (minus the cornstarch) on low until I was ready to serve. I added in the cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end and served at a dinner party with jasmine rice. It was a smash hit!

This was a delicious way to use up the leftover ham from the holidays!  I added red onion on the kabobs, but aside from that made the recipe exactly as called for.  Highly recommended!

Very quick and easy - good weeknight meal. A little sweet, but I was a little short on the green onions this time. Next time I might keep a few to sprinkle over the top to cut the sweetness.

As my 8 oz jar of pineapple didn't provide enough juice, I substituted orange juice.  I also used the full amount of vinegar and it was perfect!  Added some chopped carrots and broccoli for nutrients, a few slices of chopped jalapeños and the entire family loved it!  I'd recommend cooking quickly over high heat (using oil, not butter) as this definitely provides some depth of flavor.

This is very tasty. Did not measure ham, used a yellow onion, added grated carrots and used all the pineapple in the can (i think 14 oz can). Also added a diced jalapeño and mustard powder, to give it a little zing. Did have extra juice, which was needed to make correct amount. Served over cooked barley, as dh won't eat rice, but will use quinoa next time. Made early in the day and was great reheated.

This was just so-so for the effort that went into it.  Added extra pineapple juice to the sauce, because it needed additional liquid, served it over rice as pictured, but just seemed blah.

Excellent dish using leftovers!! My family Loved it! My husband had thirds and even ate what the kids left on their plates. I made the dish exactly as written.  Alone I can see how other viewers said it was to sweet. I served the ham and pineapple mixture on top of plain brown rice and it was delicious! I will be making this every time I make a ham and have leftovers  from now on. Thank you for the great recipe!

I CAN COOK!!!  This was so delicious.  It was a very sweet sauce, but I love sweet with ham.  I did put in a little less vinegar because I was afraid of it being to overpowering like some other reviews.  I also used flour instead of corn starch simply because I didn't have any, and I only put in like one and a half tablespoons.  I am no cook by any means (I stink) and this was so easy.

I tried the recipe because the sauce was similar to a sweet & sour sauce ive made before for chicken, and loved. I love hawaiian style foods, so am constantly trying ones such as, but this was extremely good, had a great meal for me and my boyfriend but w/ plenty of leftovers for lunches. I skipped the onions since they werent on hand, added a bit more pineapple chunks, pineapple juice, and brown sugar...(you know..the good stuff ;] ) , topped it over jasmine rice and 
I think it was all for the best! 5 star meal!

This was delicious!! I did cut back on the vinegar because of the reviews, and took someone's advice and added jalapeno peppers for a kick, and it was not to spicy at all. My husband and I both loved it!! Thanks for the great recipe!

Everyone licked their plate! I followed the recipe exactly,only substituting turkey ham for actual ham. I found it to be perfect not too sweet and I could not detect the presence of the apple cider vinegar. Served over white rice, delicious!
