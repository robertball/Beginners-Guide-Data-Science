I made this last night with the highly rated Naan recipe on this site and threw everything on the grill.  It took a while to make but was phenomenal!  My husband thought it was better than our favorite Lebanese restaurant.  Garlicky and so good.  Will for sure make again!

My husband wouldn't stop talking about how much he liked this recipe.  It is very good!  a lot of steps and a tad time consuming to make but the components can be made in advance to make dinner time prep faster.  will for sure be making again.

Great way to use up chicken and peppers (after I've loaded up at Costco). Healthy, fresh, easy. The leftovers make a great filling for a pita bread sandwich.
