I enjoyed this burger..only change was turkey bacon. I would suggest using a sharp cheddar as the mild gets kind of lost with the bacon.. and lots of black pepper

This is SO good (and I am not a fan of turkey burgers). We didn't use bacon though or jalapeno but instead just put in a half can of green chilis, and substituted the cheese for sharp cheddar. I also suggest cooking on medium, 5 minutes per side, then sticking the pan into the oven at 350 until it hits just the right temp (165 - only took a few minutes). I then had them rest in a tented foil for 5 minutes. Sounds like a lot of work but it wasn't and was well worth it. They were absolutely perfect this way and I had to write a comment just to remind myself next time how to make them :)

Great recipe. We used a small can of green chiles (less heat and added moisture) instead of jalapeno and also added about 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro.  My husband thought this was the best turkey burger he has ever had.

These are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and was not disappointed!! Topped with additional bacon, cheese, fresh tomatoes from the garden and fresh lettuce from the garden! So simple yet so delish! Highly recommend and will be making over and over again! Thanks! UPDATE: Have made this several times in the last few weeks, but the other day made it with ground chicken. They were a hit! Great recipe!!

Used turkey bacon, and chopped some jarred jalape√±os. Really good! The leftovers will be lunch this week. My family loves these. I think the bacon helps to add a punch of salty flavour to the burgers. Better than the ones you buy in a box! Thanks for posting this recipe.

This was amazing!!!
I omitted peppers and cumin as I did not have it in hand. I followed the recipe as instructed and used ground coriander instead of cumin and my family wants me to add this one to our recipe book. 
This was the best Turkey burgers we've had, thank you.

I loved this burger.  I changed the recipe by using a pound of turkey, 2/3 s less onion and bread crumb, added about a quarter cup of cooked quinoa, used 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder, a few shakes of Worcester Sauce, I also used a whole egg. We grilled the  four patties and they were excellent.

My favorite burger recipe!  We tried this out on friends who hate the usual dry turkey burgers and teenagers.  Everyone loves it - unique mix of flavors.  We made it several times this summer.  I did modify the recipe quite a bit though based on suggestions: 1 whole egg, 1/2 tsp steak seasoning, 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tsp liquid smoke, 1/8 cup parsley.  Grilled on foil sprayed liberally with PAM and no mess!

Hello, I'm the Creator of this recipe and I still make it exactly as I wrote it, and make it quite often! I agree with other reviewers that you have to use sharp cheese, I guess I didn't dictate that because that's what I use on almost everything. I usually make a double batch and freeze the patties for use in the future. the only thing I ever change is sometimes I leave the jalapeno seeds in, and sometimes I take him out, depending on who will be eating them and their spicy preference... I like them spicy! The bummer is stores have now started selling ground turkey and 16 oz packages instead of 20 oz, making it hard to make as written, but I always buy a lot for those double batches anyway. I'm glad you all enjoy it as much as I do!

Thank you for this recipe! I made it last night. I have two boys with complete opposite taste preference. They BOTH loved it, as well as the adults.  I made sliders instead of full burgers on the grill. Put them on Hawaiian Kings Rolls with chipotle mayo. Fantastic! Again, thank you.

Burger was not dry and had good flavor.  I omitted the jalapenos for the kids.   I will definitely make this dish again.

Seriously good!  Didn‚Äôt use jalapenos, but next time will add some sort of chili. I did add two dashes of cayenne and used sharp cheddar.  Anyway loved it just this way.

This was so delicious!  My husband & I usually eat beef burgers, but decided to try this & loved it.  Like other reviewers, I substituted the jalape√±o with chilli pepper.  I highly recommend this recipe - it is a delicious, tasty change from the regular burger.  We will definitely make it again!

I left out the Cheddar, Jalapenos and used sliced Mozzarella for one of the toppings. I also used Maple Bacon instead of regular bacon and substituted the salt & pepper with one tbsp. of Montreal steak seasoning. I think that if the burger is lacking flavor this will help.

This was bomb!! We just ate it and everyone wanted seconds. I didn't use the bacon or the jalape√±o but still tasted delicious. I also made little ones because my bf wanted "sliders". I put some in the freezer for a rainy day. Will be making this again!

These burgers were AWESOME!!!  The only thing I did not add was the jalapenos peppers.  Excellent flavor and not dry at all.  Made extras and froze them.  Can't wait to have them again.

Very good burger.  However I used quinoa instead of bread crumbs.  Turned out amazing.  
I'll try it with ground angus next time.

I tried this recipe twice.  The first time was with turkey.  The burgers fell apart and had absolutely no flavor.  So I decided to try it with ground beef.  Same thing; the burgers fell apart and had no flavor.  I will never make these again.

This recipe makes an excellent turkey burger. Moist and held together perfect while cooking on the grill. Great flavor, even though I had to sub 1/4t red pepper flakes for the jalepeno I didn't have.  I also only had 16oz of ground turkey, so just 'scanted' the remaining ingredients a bit.

My Family says that this is their all time favorite burger!  Only change is that I did not use the jalape√±o pepper. I also used roasted garlic that I had made earlier in the week instead of the diced garlic. Amazing!

Given the 5-star reviews, I made a double batch of this recipe. I made it AS IS except for one can (4oz) diced HOT jalape√±o. Hubby & I like spicy. These deserve more than 5-stars!!! To give you a hint; my Hubby was in the Army and since those MRE's were so bad, he puts hot sauce on EVERYTHING. He ate through 2 burgers right off the bat and never put hot sauce on them! Wish I could explain just how significant that is!! Great recipe, terrific flavor, and this will be in our regular rotation.

Made this as written except for using precooked bacon.  Everyone loved it. Even though the jalapeno I had was very hot, the burgers were not too spicy.  May even add an extra one next time for some extra kick!

Very good, moist. I didn't have bacon so I left it out. I will add it next time. The burgers were really tasty!

Juicy and moist chargrilled.  Put it on a fresh whole wheat bun for dinner and the leftover patty just by itself for lunch the next day.  I'd leave the seeds from the jalape√±o in next time to add a little more spice.

simply delicious! I used the sharp cheddar and the flavors matched perfectly!  I totally recommended this to my family and friends.
