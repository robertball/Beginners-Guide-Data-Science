I have made this recipe several times for entertaining and always receive many compliments on it.  They turn out the best when following the recipe exactly as written, creamy and just the right amount of heat for the spices, but I have used different cheeses and less spices, just what I had on hand and it turns out great too.  If there is any left over stuffing, it is great served over crackers too.  Great finger food, and good for you.  Thanks for sharing this recipe "milbax"!

I made these for our traditionally non traditional xmas meal 2012 and they were the hit of the meal!  I did not have the mushrooms it calls for, so I used regular button mushrooms and it worked out just fine.  Other changes I made, due to materials and taste were: I do not buy bread crumbs, I use croutons crushed.  This time they were a garlic cheese flavor.  I skipped the hot sauce due to taste of guests not being as hot as our family's taste, but have no doubt it would be great with it in as well.  I chopped up the mushroom stems and added them to the filling.  Last, I cooked them for an additional 5 minuets under the broiler.

FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!  Don't half the recipe because what is left over (and there will be leftover) makes the most awesome dip ever.  I put it out as an appetizer with ritz style crackers and green onions.  It was eaten before, during, and after the meal by people who were already "stuffed" but just couldn't help themselves.  This stuff is GREAT!

UPDATE: For our traditionally non-traditional Thanksgiving meal 2014 I made these again and they were still just awesome!  This time I used PANKO and have fallen in love with the stuff.  Great to use anytime bread crumbs are called for.  baby bella mushrooms were even better than the buttons too! I doubt real crab meat would improve this as it is a stuffing, but I always use imitation for this sort of thing.  I would have given this 5 stars had I not made the small changes I did for personal taste.

I made these for the first time today, and took them to a BBQ. EVERYONE thought they were great, even two of my buddies that have their own catering business, and my girlfriend who hates mushrooms.  The only change I made was to use Gumbo File powder instead of seafood seasoning, to give it that lil creole flavor.

Used Monterey Jack cheese instead of Colby-Jack. Baked in oven for 10 minutes instead of 7 and broiled for 10 minutes on the middle rack. Watch very carefully.

We used this topping for 8 portobello caps for a main dish tonight.  I had difficulty with my cream cheese/shredded cheese mixture being pretty dry, but I went forward anyway, thinking that the cream cheese would get too runny in the oven if I thinned it out up front.  Must be the cheap cream cheese I bought -- it stayed pretty thick.  I never could mix the bread crumbs in, but we didn't miss them. Because I was using this as a main dish, I used an entire 14-oz pkg of imitation crab.  It took a bit of doing, but I was finally able to mix it into the cream cheese mixture.  Because we left out the bread crumbs, I sprinkled a little more shredded cheese on top at the broiling stage.  The flavor was good, though I think we'd prefer to use the topping on a loaf of French bread.  The mushroom flavor overpowered the topping.  I guess that's what I get for changing the recipe!  We will definitely use the topping again, though not for mushrooms.

I added breakfast sausage to the mix, omitted the bread crumbs and sprinkled parmesan on top.  Mine released a lot of juice in cooking and were a little soggy so I'll try them on a grate over a cookie sheet next time.  Yum!  I will make these again.

Thank you for a great recipe.  Took it to a neighborhood get together and it was gone in no time.  I ended up baking it a little longer than called for but I will definitely put this on the keeper list!

Was very good!  I skipped the garlic powder and used a finely chopped clove of garlic.  Didn't have any bread crumbs so I toasted up an english muffin and crushed that in there too. Don't know if I would do that again, but it worked in a pinch....and the pinch was on. Also I used Srirahca hot sauce instead of the cayenne sauce.

These were ok.  I used real crab instead of imitation.  This makes about twice as much filling than 8 oz. of mushrooms can hold, filled generously, so I would recommend making half the filling.

I thought these were boring when first made. The next day we reheated in the microwave and they were much better. I probably will not make again, but they were very easy.

Absolutely delicious, before my husband met me he hated stuffed mushrooms, slowly got him into them since they are one of my fav, and he said tonight (birthday dinner) "these are the best stuffed mushrooms I ever had!

These were great! I made a few minor changes...I only had plain breadcrumbs, so I added extra garlic powder and some dried minced onions, also, I didn't have colby jack cheese so I used some meunster that I needed to use up. I also used real canned crabmeat and I had a 16 oz pkg of mushrooms and still had quite a bit of filling left over. Very yummy though and I will make them again :)

Followed the recipe as it was stated.  I used large portobella mushroom tops.  The dish was great.  My boyfriend absolutely loved it!  I'm not a big stuffed mushroom eater...at least when it come to big mushrooms, but I did enjoy the dish.  The stuffing was so good!

This recipe is really delicious. I followed everything except I wanted to make it an entree so I bought 6 large portobella mushrooms, removed the caps, diced them and added to the mixture. Also, I used real claw crab meat. I saw no reason to use imitation ... the real claw crab meat was only $6. I heard a lot of people say there was too much mixture but for the bella mushrooms I used it was the exact perfect amount. I also put a little extra cayenne pepper because I like things spicy. I didn't have "cajun" seasoning so I used "southwest." Baking time for me was about 15 minutes and then broiled for about 5. YUM!

The filling of these was delicious. I didn't have the crimini mushrooms so I had to use what I had on hand and it just seemed a little off to me.

Rich, but delicious. Followed recipe exactly, but more mushrooms were needed for the amount of filling it made. Or next time I might keep the same amount of crab and mushrooms, but only use 2/3 of the rest of the filling ingredients.

Very easy and very good.  I used cheddar cheese (what I had) and made keto friendly swapping crushed pork rinds for bread crumbs. I don't like pork rinds and I couldn't taste them at all - BONUS!  I'll definitely make these again!

I’ve made these a few times already and they are Delicious! The only thing i changes was that I topped it with shredded ghost pepper cheese because we love some heat to it!

Delicious! I used real crab (canned fancy white crabmeat, rinsed) and Chef Paul Prudhomme's Seafood Magic and Goudi's Cajun Heat Seasoning for the spices. I added 1/4 tsp. of Frank's Red Hot Wing Sauce. Selected portobellos as the mushrooms. My family really loved these and will definitely be making these again!

I made this dish but I changed it up a little! I preheated the over and cooked for 7 minutes and I broiled for 3 minutes, like the original post instructs. What I did differently though, is for my mixture I had cream cheese, imitation crab, tbs of old bays, Cajun seasoning, and garlic salt.  I mixed this and stuffed the mushrooms and then baked. After the finally step (broiling). I pulled the stuffed mushrooms out and topped with shredded cheese and I placed them back in the over for a few seconds to melt these cheese. And then I was done!

Used  mayo in place of cream cheese, just not a cream cheese fan. Also added shredded pepper jack cheese as a topping

Delicious! I use whipped cream cheese and bake/broil for 10/5 minutes on top rack.

Made these appetizers for our 7 fishes dinner.  Exceptional.  Everyone loved these.   Being the cheap that I am, couldn't waste the mushroom stems, so I chopped them along with a shallot and garlic and sautéed all together till soft.  Cooled it down and added to the cream cheese mix.  Turned out sooo good.  This is a keeper recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Made them for a party and it was a huge hit! I was told it had a nice kick, but next time I will up the cayenne. We like a big kick. Will make them again soon.
