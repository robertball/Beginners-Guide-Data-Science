Flavor is good but by the time the noodles absorb much of the stock it's not really soup.  I added 2 cups of water after cooking.  Seasoning was still fine.

Taste was very good, even though I had no celery. Only used a partial bag of noodles though, and didn't have much extra broth for the noodles after refrigerating leftovers for the next day. Had to add more.

I followed the recipe except for the garlic and sea salt.  Great wintertime soup.  I have frozen it with the noodles and it tastes amazing.  It is very handy to have a wonderful meal ready to go on the night you do not have time to cook

Easy to make and loved the flavor from the oregano and Italian seasoning.  Will definitely make it again!
