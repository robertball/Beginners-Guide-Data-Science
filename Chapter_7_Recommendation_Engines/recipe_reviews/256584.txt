Did not change anything initially, but it turned out Incredibly bland. Had to add tons of seasoning and other herbs to give it any sort of flavor.

I did make changes. I fried I small chopped sweet onion, and added turmeric to the spices.  It was delicious.

This is an excellent recipe. I used whole grain rice. The flavors and texture are soothing and delicate. I topped with hot peppers, lime, and fresh coriander leaves. Thank you for the recipe.
