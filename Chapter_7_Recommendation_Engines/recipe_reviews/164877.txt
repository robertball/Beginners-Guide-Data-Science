The Bakewell Tart is a bit of a tradition for my family and I. Having lived in the pretty market town of Bakewell in Derbyshire, England.  Home to the original Bakewell tart, before we moved here to America 2 years ago. The dessert dates back to the 1860s. Bakewell tarts are often called Bakewell puddings, but the two desserts are essentially the same.  While this recipe is pretty good, I have had to make a few changes to make the recipe more traditional.  The pastry should be an almond short crust pastry, I make my pastry as usual but add 1/3 cup of ground almonds.  For the frangipane centre I use Clementine zest not lemon.  Once the tart has been baked, I always top with Royal icing.  A Bakewell tart can essentially be iced or not, but for me the icing just finishes off the cake entirely.

You can omit all the pastry trimming stuff and just fill a regular pastry pie shell!

My British husband wasn't very impressed.  I think if it had enough jam to make a substantial layer on the crust it would've been much better.

YUM!  I've always wanted to make one of these, and it did not disappoint.  I made 12 minis actually, in a muffin tin.  I probably used a thicker layer of jam than in the recipe.  I also added almond extract to the cake part, only because I like it like that, but it would have been good without!  Yumyum, will make again!

I made this into mini tarts instead of a big one and they turned out fantastic.  Added some almond extract.  Delicious and easy!

One of our favorite tarts and sometimes I use rice flour rather than all purpose.  I think originally that was what it called for .  Gives an interesting texture.Always use a little almond flavoring and omit lemon zest.

I think you will find the original 1820's recipes all call for Raspberry not Strawberry  jam, and there should be a goodly layer across the base of the tart. At least 0.25" thick  (7 - 10 mm.) 
So your a bit light on the jam quantity!

I didn't do all the fiddling with pie shells, just used the no roll pie crust recipe from this site (doubled), added extra jam as per the other reviewers. Everything else was the same, and it came out better than store bought!

This is go to recipe.  I am asked to bring this to pot lucks and for special occasions.  I make this into tarts, rather than a pie, and include almond extract in the filling.  I also ice these with a royal icing (almond extract in that as well), and either put a glace cherry or sliced almond pieces on top.  Beautiful, delicious, and not too difficult, these ALWAYS turn out and are a hit.
