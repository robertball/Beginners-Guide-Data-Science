Instead of using strawberry ice cream, I used vanilla, and I also added some bananas.  It still tasted great, but needed a bit more sugar.  It turned out to be very thick and frothy, and if that's what you like, then you'll love this recipe.

Like the name says - yummy!  Makes an awful lot!  Too much for the 4 of us and my 2 year old had two helpings.  Next time I will start with a half batch.

Very good, especially the ice.  But this makes four servings, not one.  You can scale it down to 1 serving by entering 0.25 in the serving size field.

Also, mine turned out a bit sour, so I added some more sugar.

I make this several different ways. One way is to use the frozen strawberries in sugar (grocer's freezer). You won't need to add more sugar when you use this. Also, I have used vanilla ice cream when I am out of strawberry. I usually add a bit more sugar to this mix. All are very good! Thank you.

My daughter found this recipe, saved it, and called me at work and begged me to bring home strawberry ice cream so she could try this. Well, I did, but she didn't realize that we would need more strawberries (only had about 2 cups worth at home) So we halved the recipe. It made enough to give each kid (there was 4 here at the time) a decent amount (about the size of those small dinner glasses). My daughter liked it alot, the teenagers kept coming over and putting more redi whip on it, but said they liked it alot. Me, although I LOVE strawberries, I have never cared for strawberry shakes, so it was just ok for me. But they are what mattered and they all loved it.

I used Blue Bunny Double Strawberry ice cream since the strawberries at the store didn't look completely ripe.  The sugar definitely toned down the bitterness from the strawberries.  Very very good.  Oh, and this made enough for four glasses.

Traditional and simple. You cannot mess this up. Added a tad more sugar and whipped cream with a cherry on top.

This yields way more than 1 serving (maybe 4) and you must have a large blender to incorporate all ingredients.  I halved the recipe and still had issues with the ingredients fitting into the blender.

I am so glad I cut this recipe in half!! It wouldn't have fit in the blender.  It was very yummy with fresh strawberries.  Definitely a keeper!

I didn't have strawberry ice cream but I so wanted to make this.  I did have vanilla ice cream, however, and pure strawberry extract. And just for extra measure, I added a little strawberry jam rather than the sugar. (I'd love to try this with some malted milk powder)

Kids loved this one.  How could they not?  Strawberries and ice cream?  I threw in a few raspberries and blueberries that I had leftover from another recipe.  Thick, fruity, and refreshing on a hot and humid day.

Great milkshake recipe. its been a while since i had such a good one. the original recipe asks for milk but i used evaporated milk to create a thicker texture since other reviews said that it was a little bit thin and i am all about the thickness. also feel free to use the amount of sugar you wish because the sweetness may vary depending on how sweet your strawberries are. one last thing, i used frozen fruit and vanilla ice cream and it turned out wonderful. ENJOY YOUR SHAKES!

I halved this recipe and it was still plenty for one adult serving and 3 kids. I used about 2 1/2 cups strawberries, 1 cup 1% milk, 2 cups Publix premium strawberry ice cream, a little more than a cup of ice cubes and about 2 TBSP sugar. Delicious!!

Mmmmm!  I used frozen fresh berries, low fat vanilla almond milk and Stevia.  I added half the milk and blended adding more milk to the desired consistency.  Easy, quick and ingredients I always have on hand - perfect!

VERY GOOd although i didn't follow the recipe . I completely took out the strawberries because I didn't have any at my house and couldn't go out and buy any at the time... I did shrink it down to one serving and I did follow the rest. i think i added a little bit more ice cream (i used breyers strawberry) and I added some vanilla extract. with those changes its very good although im sure the normal recipe is good to!

Other reviewers are right that this recipe needs to be halved, at least, to serve two people.  This filled two 16 oz. glasses with more left over.  When I make it again I'll add less ice - mine turned out less creamy and more icy.

I think the serving size is a little off... but I used peach ice cream instead, and added 1/2 tsp cocoa powder, and 1/8 tsp vanilla, and used agave syrup instead of white sugar. Turned out great!

Very good recipe! Like most of the reviews said, this IS NOT one serving. I QUARTERED the recipe and it made two full glasses.  Other than that, it was very good. my sister and I each had one with redi-whip and some pink sprinkles. yummy for a hot summer day like today.

Adjust milk to your thickness preference.  We added mini chocolate chips and left it a bit thick and ate it with spoons and it tasted like soft serve.  So yummy!  Was a big success with our toddlers.

Worked great - DH had wisdom teeth out and chowed on these all weekend.  We added extra sugar, but he's a sugar junkie so I thought I'd spoil him a little.

It was just okay, but I suspect it was my fault: too many  changes to the original recipe, especially  the percentage of specified ingredients used.

Update:  I made this tonight and only difference was that I used strawberry ice cream instead of vanilla.  It was not anywhere near as tasty as with vanilla.  I will stick with vanilla ice cream only in the future.  Original note:  I cut this recipe in half, and it was plenty for 3 kids and 1 adult.  I used 2 generous cups frozen strawberries, 1 c. ice, 1 c. heavy whipping cream, 2 c. vanilla ice cream (we didn't have strawberry), and a little over 2 Tablespoons sugar.  Yum!

Delicious. Cut in half and made a full size blender full. But very good. Made with vanilla almond milk. Next time gonna put bananas in it.
