The meat filling was a little bland, but perfect for children.  Next time I make I will add a little onion, cumin and chili powder to the mix.  For this attempt I used black beans rather than kidney beans (they are higher in fiber), and added a can each of corn and sliced olives to the mixture.  To the muffin mix I added two chopped green chilis.  I then topped with 2% cheese and served with salsa.  It was a hit.  Cooking on the stove makes the corn bread softer and fluffier.  It was a nice change as I have always baked this.  The other advantage being, since I don't own oven safe pans I have to dirty two in order to make in the oven.  This is much simplier and leaves fewer dishes to wash.  
If you need an easy week night dinner for which most people will have the ingredients on hand this is it.  In fact I was able to help my daughter with her homework while I made it, it is that easy.

I made several changes to this recipe, and it was pretty good.  I added onion to the beef, removed the beans, used 15oz can of tomato sauce instead of 8oz can and removed the water altogether.  Also added a 15oz can of corn, a dash of crushed red pepper, and used a Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese mix.  Right before serving, I also added some fresh cilantro on top.

This recipe is great! My family loves it. I add green chili's either to the muffin mix or the beef. I also add onion to the beef. If you don't have taco seasoning, I use chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt, and cayanne. I just eyeball it.

Great! It's our new favorite meal. It's quick and easy, you can change the meat mixture to your personal preference. I added garlic and minced onion to hamburger then added taco seasoning, kidney beans, water, diced salsa tomatoes. Then add cornbread mix.

This recipe was fantastic.  Very easy & delicious.  I added a small can of corn because I like the flavor in my tamale pie.  I also left off the green onions.  Nobody knows the difference.  I used sour cream on the side as well. I'm making it again tonight for company because it is so easy and yummy.

Very good and EASY!!!!  I used ranch style beans instead of kidney beans.  I also didn't use the green onion.  I will definately be making this again.

This was surprisingly good.  I wasn't expecting too much, I just thought it would be a nice change of pace. I used chili beans instead of kidney beans and cooked it in the oven instead of in the pan to get that oven baked taste (400 degrees for 15 minutes).  My husband loved it, and I thought the sweet corn muffins blended well with the mexican/chili sauce.  Very good! Definately try it!

This is a new family favorite!  I added diced onion to the browning ground beef, a little more like 10 oz of the tomato sauce (as I only had a 15 oz can), and one can of diced tomatoes drained. It takes more like 20 minutes on med-low temp, but the 15-17 min is more accurate for med temp.

Great, my whole family loved it and it was EASY to make. I added a small can of corn and put the skillet in the oven to cook the cornbread. (Make sure to use a skillet that is OK in the oven.) 350 degrees - for about 15 minutes.

It was pretty good. I will try it again this time making some changes.  I really like the cornbread topping as it was the best part.  The changes will definitely be to the meat part.

This was really good!  I browned the meat on the stove, added all the ingredients and then transferred it to a lasagne pan.  I added most of a 16 oz can of corn and about a half a cup of sliced black olives. Then I dolloped the cornbread mixture over the whole thing, sort of cut it through with a knife and baked in a 400 degree oven until the cornbread was done.  Top with cheese, green onion and a few more black olives and bake until the cheese is melted.  Good stuff -- My 11yo picky eater even loved it!

This was pretty good. Except for me burning the bottom layer of beef. I dont think that it needs to cook as long as the recipe indicates, even on a low setting.

Great base for an easy, tasty family meal! I added a can of green chiles and used a can of Southwestern-style beans; I also added a couple teaspoons of chili powder. My husband and sons loved it and even went back for seconds! This one's going into regular rotation--a great way to use ingredients we always have on hand.

Fantastic. My husband and I ate this all in one sitting. I added a can of corn, sliced olives, and 1/2 can green chilies. Since we have MSG allergies, I always do my own taco seasoning (chili pwd, cumin, beef bullion, tomato pwd,  minced garlic, chopped onion) and it still had a really good Mexican flavor.

I made this and it was a BIG hit. Only things I changed was I didn't have green onion to sprinkle on top, so instead used 1/2 white onion and mixed in with the meat. Also didn't have Cheddar cheese, used Monterey Jack instead. Very filling and delicious meal.

We all really liked this. We added a can of diced tomotoes to the meat mixture.  This dish would be really good with leftover chili in place of the meat mixture. This will have a definite place in our recipe box.

I substituted ground turkey for the beef and added corn, green chilies and onion plus more garlic powder and cumin and little more tomato sauce. I also baked in the oven. Enjoyed it!  Would recommend making extra corn muffins - leftovers can get a little mushy. Otherwise easy, enjoyable meal!!

I was really excited about making the dish, but I have to say, it was awful. It was very bland, you couldn't even taste the taco seasoning. I definitely will not make this again.

This is super good. I added corn, black olives, and red pepper flakes, and left off the beans (cuz, yuck) and it turned out yummy. I also forgot to get the cornbread mix, so I just used a recipe off the back of the corn meal box (which was super easy as well). It was pretty soupy, so it just poured right onto the beef mixture in a pretty even layer. Then, I cooked it as this recipe said to. I'll be making this again.

Very easy to make, very easy to serve and even easier to clean up!! I love this and so did the kids! At first glance, they said "Yuck" to the beans, but once they started eating it- it was do very quick, with requests for dinner the next day. I love the way the cornbread cooks up so nice and fluffy! I'll never bake this again! Thanks!!

Surprisingly good for such a simple dish.  Since it's so hard to find main-dish recipes with no milk, and impossible to find cornbread recipes with no milk (allergy problem), I was able to adapt this recipe using rice milk and it still came out good, just a little sweeter than expected.  I'll definitely be making it again.

Good recipe. I did add a few things. I cooked yellow onion with the ground beef and added a can of corn, chopped zucchini and sliced olives before topping with the corn bread mix. I didn't use the green onion on top. I have cast iron so I popped the pot into the oven and cooked on 400 for 17 minutes.

This was so easy and was awesome that I didn't need to use my oven!  I did make some changes.  I added onion, used black beans instead of kidney beans (didn't have any)and a can of drained corn.  My daughter in addition to her 2 cousins, ate it up!  My husband was also impressed at how good it tasted.  The leftovers were good, too!

My family really likes this. I usually use a combination of beef and sausage, sometimes only 1/2 lb.total. Instead of the tomato sauce, I use a 15-oz can of tomatoes. I add a little extra onion and garlic (the taco mix contains some); I add some ground pepper to taste.I also add some canned or bottled jalepeno slices-cut up. I've never had the gr. onion on hand-and it still turns out great! I have been out of kidney beans and used pork 'n beans before-still great.

I made this recipe meatless by subbing 6 ounces firm tofu (cubed), 1 zucchini (chopped), and 1/2 onion (chopped) for the ground beef.  It was still a fast and easy dinner.  Next time I might add some corn and mushrooms.  This recipe is tasty everyday fare.

I didn't have kidney beans on hand, so I just omitted them. I also didn't have muffin mix on hand, so I just topped it with biscuits and baked it in the oven until they were done. It was good. It just needs a little something extra.

This recipe turned out just like the picture. Although I thought that the taco seasoning mix was not enough to give the dish the kick that it needed. I might try adding beef bullion and some chili powder or cumin next time. I used Mom's Corn bread recipe (on this site) instead of boxed corn bread, and it worked well. Also, since the recipe yielded more than anticipated, I transferred the entire beef/been mixture into server ware and put in the oven at 200C for 25 minutes to allow the corn bread to cook on top. Came out perfectly.
