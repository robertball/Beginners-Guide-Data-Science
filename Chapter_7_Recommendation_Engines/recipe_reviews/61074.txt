This was a very good combination of flavors. The peppers and fennel (I used the whole bulb) added a nice sweetness. I used homemade soy/sesame/tarragon vinaigrette, which added a yummy zing (I think some type of acid is necessary; otherwise the salad would just taste like soy sauce). Next time, I'll double the peppers.

This salad is fantastic.  It is different and very good--I, too, will use two peppers next time but the rest is absolutely delicious!

Loved it. I used the celery like portions of the fennel as I had eaten up the bulb. The amount of soy sauce given is just enough.

I am giving it 3 stars for potential.  Loved the pine nuts and fennel.  I will add these to my salad from now on.  Not a fan of the soy sauce in the salad. I would have probabloy loved it with vinegar and oil.

This was really good.  Not hearty enough for a meal on its own, but as a side dish to compliment an Asian-style meal.

I took the advice of others and added more red pepper and I also made the dressing a little differently. (1 1/2 T. toasted sesame seed oil, 1 T. soy sauce, 1 T. canola oil, 1 T. sugar, 1 1/2 T. rice vinegar, 1 T. sesame seeds). We also added fresh spinach leaves. I think green onions would have been good, too. We served it with grilled chicken satay and rice. YUM! I had never used fresh whole fennel before and I really liked it!
