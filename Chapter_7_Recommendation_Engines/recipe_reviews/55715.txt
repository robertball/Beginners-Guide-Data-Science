I followed this recipe pretty much exactly, making only the following changes: I used a little less than 7 cups broth (my pot wouldn't fit any more than 6), only about 1 pound chicken pieces, more chili powder and cumin than called for, and more jalapenos than called for. I thought it was quite good-- I only got 2 bowls, everyone ate it up. I really liked the addition of fresh zucchini, and I think the cinnamon, along with the chili powder and cumin, add a really nice, distinctive flavor. I will make this again, and maybe add some more vegetables. I had some after the cooking time recommended, and then simmered it for another hour or so-- as with all soups, this improved the flavors. Recommended.

This was really tasty. I don't make any changes to the ingredients, but reduced the amount of broth and the amount of chicken slightly. I served this over polenta slices. I think it tasted better the next day as most soups do. I think next time I will serve it over some noodles or rice instead.

This is good if you want something a little different---the seasoning is different than your usual fare.  I forgot to buy zuchini, so I threw in some rice and it was pretty good.

Very good, I didn't change much but would add less cinnamon next time.
