We Really enjoyed this cake! It is SO moist and not too sweet. Watch your cooking time. I made mine in a glass casserole dish and 38 minutes was perfect.

8.22.18  Zucchini is abundant right now, and I’m taking advantage of it.  I had half a zucchini in the fridge, so I scaled this recipe down to 8 servings to use it up.  Baked for 32 minutes @ 350ºF in a 6-1/2”x8-1/2” baking dish.  It ceases to amaze me what shredded zucchini brings to baked goods.  Nobody, NOBODY ever knows there’s zucchini in there.  Don’t tell the “zucchini haters” because they’ll never know.  I used all purpose and white whole wheat flours, and this cake baked up beautifully moist and tender, perfect texture.  Might just add a little more carrot next time because that layer of flavor is subtle.  This was very good, thoroughly enjoyed it.
