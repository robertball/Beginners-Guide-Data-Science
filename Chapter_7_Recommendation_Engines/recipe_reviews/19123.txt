This was GREAT!  It took a little while to do but well worth the time.  I added garlic and sour cream.  The sour cream is a must.  It made a delicious rich sauce.  Without it dish was a little dry.  Thought I made enough for leftovers, -- wrong, all gone!

Definitely a keeper for a busy weeknight or lazy weekend! 

Made a number of tweaks only because I like to have alot different flavors blending in my food: 

28 ounce can fire roasted tomatoes instead of fresh chopped tomato; 3 garlic cloves minced; 3tbs chili powder instead of 1; first seasoned chicken with adobo powder; add 1 packet chicken bouillon in powder form; 1 teaspoon dried crushed oregano; 1 teaspoon ground cumin; and 1 chopped zucchini or squash.

I love this recipe! It's so fast and easy, not to mention colorful and delicious! The only modifications I make are using red peppers instead of green, adding garlic, and topping it off with melted mozzarella cheese. Otherwise it's perfect.

This recipe was a quick and easy dish, that delivered something a bit different. I did make some modifications. We are not big fans of super spicey foods so I did not use hot sauce or the jalepeno peppers. I added one can of black beans and 3 cloves pressed garlic. Also instead of one fresh tomatoe I used one can of diced tomatoes with chilies. I served with Mexican rice and also had cheddar cheese, black olives and sour cream for garnish. I will definitely make this again.

I added zing to this recipe by changing it up a bit.  I didn't add more chili powder after cooking the chicken. After cooking the onion and bell pepper with 1-2 tsp diced garlic and 1 tsp ground ginger, I added 2 chopped roma tomatoes, 1/2 cup medium salsa, 1/2 cup water, a sprinkle or two of cinnamon (you'll be surprised how a little adds a lot of flavor!), salt, pepper, and added 1/8 cup finely chopped canned jalepeno slices.  I then added the spiced chicken and heated thoroughly, allowing the liquid to form a "sauce".  After cooking, I removed from heat and stirred in 1/4 cup of freshly torn cilantro.  Excellent!

5 stars in my book: easy, quick to make, all the ingredients always already on hand, and delicious to boot!  It isn't near as spicy or picoso as it sounds, either.  Seve with Mexican rice, a cold Corona...yum!

This was a tasty recipe, with a few changes.  I used the diced canned tomatoes with jalapenos and garlic.  Served over saffron rice, with refried beans and sour cream on the side.  The family has asked that this becomes a frequent meal.

This was spicy, simple and scrumptious! I served it with Mexican Rice III from this site and corn on the cob, and it was a great dinner.

This recipe is amazing!  I used more chili powder and didn't use any hot sauce.  For the heat, I added in more jalapeños instead.  I also used canned jalapeños and canned diced tomatoes.  It was really nice and spicy.  We served it over rice and it was a massive hit!  Super easy to make, too!  Really delicious!

We added about 2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and 1 roasted red pepper and a little extra salt. We made them into fantastic fajitas!

Tasty and easy to make. Used a can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of a whole tomato and added some sour cream and key lime juice. As it is a spicy dish, I would suggest pairing it with a milder rice.

This was AWESOME!!!  It really wasn't as spicy as you would think, just enough kick but LOTS of flavor. I had read through the reviews and used some ideas from several of them, and changed it up a bit but here is what I changed/added:   -28 ounce can of Cilantro/Lime diced tomatoes instead of fresh chopped tomato -3 garlic cloves minced -2 tbs chili powder instead of 1 -added 1 chopped zucchini  -didn't use the hot pepper sauce -didn't use salt b/c the adobo can be salty -only 1 jalepeno  Seasoned the chicken with adobo powder; 1 teaspoon dried crushed oregano; 1 teaspoon ground cumin and 2 tbs chili powder and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  Served with Saffron rice, we decided this would be pretty tasty served with some warm tortillas, sour cream, and sliced avocados. We're going to try that next time.

This was easy and tasty!! My 4 year old smashed a whole plate of the taco salad I made her. We made taco salad bowls out of tortilla shells in the oven. Used a deep plate. Filled with warm water added a tsp. of olive oil. Dipped them quickly and draped them over foil covered cereal bowls on a baking tray. Baked for about 7 min at 450. Quick and really flavorful.

So delicious! I added chopped green onion, and a little splash of lime juice all served over a bed of white rice. Oh, and I had to substitute the tomato for a can of diced, as I didn't have a fresh one on hand. So quick and filling, thanks Lorrie!

A very tasty dish!  My family likes things a little hotter so we added more chili powder & peppers.  But it's easy to adjust to your liking. I also added a red pepper. A quick and easy dinner that we'll have often!

We doubled the recipe but didn't have enough chili powder on hand so we made a blend of chili powder, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes. This was pretty good. Had a good spice and warmed your mouth but not too hot. Very nice with some white rice.

I love this dish - I do add some different things - just whatever happens to be in the fridge.  One night we had leftover brown rice and added this.  And I add a lot more chili power than this recipe says to because we love the flavor

This was a very good meal.  Though I have to admit, it was a bit of a disaster!  While sauteeing the chicken, my kitchen became unbearably similar to the gas chamber at boot camp!  It was not until I was adding the other 1/2 tbs of "chili powder" until I realized that I had used Cayenne!!  All crisis aside, the dish was pretty good.  I served with a sweet corn bake (from this site) on tortillas with sour cream...a must when you use that much spice!! :)  Please remember to check your spice labels first and tip your waitress! ;)

i dont eat meat, but am an aspiring culinary artist, and love to try new recipes, and this one was so easy and my family loved it. i did make a few changes though. i instead used cayenne pepper instead chili powder, left out the bell pepper, and added about 7 drops of tapito sauce, a splash of jim bean hot sauce, and a few shakes of Tabasco.  i served it in homemade tortilla bowls with a layer of shredded lettuce under the chicken mix, also with shredded cheese, sour cream, lime wedges and avocado slices. veryyy good(: and i will definitely make this again.

Made this Chicken last night for dinner. Great recipe increases easly and the 
flavor is great. i love hot spicy food and te combanation of chili powder and hot 
pepper sauce adds a depth of flavor instead of just hot. A great make ahead 
meal, I will make this and let in stay in the fridge over night to blend flavors 
even more. But is great just made for sure. A real winner!!

Yummy South Beach friendly recipe and is very filling. 
 
Instead of chicken I used shrimp.  Since it was already cooked I let it marinate in a mixture of olive oil, chili powder and garlic salt; added it towards the end.  I added fresh mushrooms, used a can of Rotel (didn't have a fresh tomato) and added cilantro.

I served it with cheese guacamole on top.  Both were unecessary, next time I would just use sour cream.  This would be great served on tortillas.

Simply delicious! Right amount of spicyness! I used 1 can of Diced tomatos with green chili instead, gave it an extra kick

The first time I made this, I agreed - it was "lacking".
Next time I made it, I followed previous suggestions and added garlic, cilantro, more tomatoes (large dice rather than chunks), a little extra fire and some chicken broth.  (also added the chicken broth to the rice).  Everybody loved it!

This was so good.  Not too spicey.  I must admit I was a bit afraid with the jalepeno  :), but it was perfect!!

I have made this recipe several times and used many tips from these reviews.  I always use DelMonte "Diced Tomato with Spicy Jalapeno" and I think that both gives the dish moisture and a little kick.  Because there are peppers in the canned tomato I use only one diced fresh jalapeno.  

I use a pack (three peices usually) chicken breast, two large green and a large red pepper, one can of the spicy diced, one to two jalapeno and really add the chili powder liberally.

I have added a bit of cour cream on top when I serve and it gives a nice touch, but its also good without.

Next time I will try using some garlic as suggested and maybe serve fajita style as some others have done.

In general I think this is a great dish to try.

I'm always looking for new ways to cook the old-reliable boneless chicken breast, and this was yummy.  I served it over rice with a dollop of sour cream to cool it a bit.  I will be making this again.

This was really tasty. Family loved it. The only thing I did different was add a can of Rotel because I didn't have tomato or jalapenos and served it over hot rice as suggested. Yum!

Just as KEKY1 mentioned, I added some sour cream to the pan, and also a can (on top of the fresh tomato) of diced tomatoes. I was surprised at how well this dish turned out. It reminds me of a dish I had at Applebee's.. pretty darn close to it! And it all took less than 20 minutes! Great for a university student like myself. A+ recipe.

EDIT: I have made this recipe several times: I've done as is and have experimented with some additions (chipotle peppers/cumin/my spicy red seasoning blend/minced garlic/cilantro) I've also served over both rice and tortillas, with and without added shredded cheddar/monteray jack. Every version has been a success. This is really a wonderful base recipe and my family thanks you immensely.

I must have done something wrong because my sauce turned into MUSH!!! Nothing turned out right. And I used Chipotle Pepper for the ground pepper. Let me tell you, watch it with those!!! They are SERIOUSLY hot.  I didn't even use the amount of pepper in the recipe and we could hardly eat the stuff!

We loved this!  I grow jalapenos, so I am always looking for new recipes to use them in.  The best part about this dish is that you can customize how spicy you want it to be.  It is pretty spicy as is, depending on the brand of chili powder and hot pepper sauce you use.

Easy recipie. Quick if you have a food processor. Try serving it over spanish rice. If you're in a hurry you can use Lipton's Spanish Rice packet. I like to heat it up with some special hot sauce and serve it with a side of sour cream.

Made this recipe last night, it was very, very delicious. The chicken was juicy and succulent and the spices were perfect. Served the chicken over quinoa and the only thing I would do different is add some extra spices and chicken broth into the chicken mixture while it's cooking to give it some extra juices in the quinoa. Will most certainly be making this again, possibly once a week! Just loved it!

I like to try a recipe exactly as it's written the first time out, and my daughter and I liked this recipe very much just as written.  And one of the nice things about this dish is that there are a number of different variations one could try, and it would still be great.  This is definitely going to be added to our regular menue.  Thanks!

This was awesome.  I added a more chili powder, probably triple or even the quadruple the amount called for.  Thought I had tomatoes, didn't so I used 1/2 can (14oz size) diced tomato.  This was so good.  Served it in warmed up corn torillas like a fajita.  Two nights later when eating the leftovers, I put some cubed avocado and cilantro on the table to garnish the fajitas.  Later on wished I had some sour cream too.  Oh well, next time as there will be a lot of next times with this recipe.

I chose this recipe because I was looking for a fajita filling idea that didn't involve those salty/starchy packets you buy at the grocery store!  I was very impressed with the results from this!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of leaving out the hot pepper sauce - it was definitely hot enough without it!  Though the jalapenos were a pain to work with to remove the seeds, the end result is worth it.  I served it inside burrito-sized flour tortillas with a bit of sour cream and lots of cheese - it was great!  There was even a good amount of sauce in the pan to drizzle inside.  This is a keeper.

This dish has become a regular in my household. Not having any children around, the spiciness is not a problem at all. I use boneless chicken thighs (dark meat) for this recipe as I love the tender texture, plus it has less of a tendency to get overcooked like white meat. Highly recommended!

I made this last nite & it passed muster. I scaled the recipe to serve 4 and it was a little too spicy (chili powder & tabasco), but everyone cleaned their plates.  I stirred sour cream into the peppers to cool it down a little for a creamy, spicy sauce. Had "Best Spanish Rice" on the side, a definite keeper.

I read the comments before I made this, and noticed some disagreement about how spicy it is.
The "zing" depends a lot on the chili powder you use: a powder that was on the grocer's shelf for 3 years before you bought it two years ago will not be nearly as good as a powder made from chilis grown this year.
Jalapenos vary greatly in the heat they have, too.
In short, this dish can be as spicy or as mild as you choose!

This is a good recipe but it needs a little "zing".  The flavor is good, but missing that special something to keep it from being somewhat bland.

Tasty and flavorful.  I actually sauteed the jalapenos with the pepper and onion, and added salt then as well as to the chicken at the beginning.  Also, if you dont mind dealing with the seeds, it gives a more intense flavor.

Quick, easy, and delicious. The only mods I made were changing green bell peppers to orange one, I added paprika and cayenne to the seasoning, and squeezed fresh lime over the mixture while cooking in the skillet.  I'll definitely make this again, it was very good.

Pretty good. Heavily altered recipe: didn't have any green peppers, but would be good; used 2 cans of diced tomatoes; used a can of diced chiles; added a can each of black beans and corn; added garlic; and a shot of V8 juice. Spices: used chili powder, a lot of hot pepper sauce, added cumin and cayenne. Served over white rice.

Good recipe. I used both red and green pepper and less jalapeno. Also took the advice of others and added zucchini and mushrooms. Very pretty and colorful dish

We thought this was off the charts! I pretty much followed the recipe but took someone's suggestion to add cayenne pepper. We tried this as a wrap but it made a mess, so leftovers are on rice (and avocado on the side). LOVED it!

I made this dish tonight, and the chicken was WAY too bland. The dish in general is bland, even with the suggested chile powder and hot sauce. I added salt to my dish after serving, and that made it more edible. I do NOT plan on making this dish again. Any advice on what I might have done wrong would be appreciated.

This dish had a lot of flavor. It was close to authentic mexican food. I will make this again. I suggest you use two tomatoes instead of one. Great dish!

This was delicious! I didn't have tomatoes or jalapenos on hand, but happened to have a can of rotel tomatoes and chiles.  I also seasoned the chicken with garlic pepper salt in addition to the chili powder.  Other than that, I followed the directions as listed.  My boyfriend and I loved it and will definitely have this again!

You'd think with all the ingredients listed this would be a delicious spicy dinner.  It wasn't.  It was pretty bland and reminded me of mexican in a box.

Super-yummy and healthy!  I thought it was one of the best new recipes I'd tried in a while.  My husband really enjoyed it, too.  I did cut back on the spiciness, however, in hopes that my kids would eat it.  One out of four isn't too bad, is it?

I have to say I'm not that fond of mexican food. But I wanted to try something different, since I am cajun and I am looking for more spicy food to taste, I came upon this recipe.. AND may I say that IT was the BEST! I was sooo pleased with myself and finding this recipe. This meal will be in my home at least 4 times a month.. Thanks!

Fast, easy and healthy recipe.  I always go to this one when I have chicken but no ideas.  I add garlic, but other than that I make it as written.,  Great served with a black bean and corn salsa.

Wow, so good!  I cut the chicken into strips and used home-grown bell and jalepeno peppers.  I was also generous with the hot sauce, so they were nice and spicy.  Will put the leftovers and black beans into tortillas for lunch!  Thanks!

The chicken needs a longer marinade. Aside from the surface spiciness (I added a LOT more spices and hot sauce), the chicken had little flavor. Next time, I'll try adding cilantro with a longer marinade... and serving with corn tortillas. Bachelor-friendly.

Great! I think I may have added too much spice, though, as it came out way too hot for us to enjoy. Will make again, though, as it is SO simple. Will make sure to keep an eye on the spices, though! Thanks for sharing!

Add at least a teaspoon and a half of the chili powder, along with a dollop of cream cheese to the chicken.  The flavor is minimum unless eating along with the peppers.  My suggestion would be to marinate the chicken with jalapenos and various hot sauces for a few hours to let the chicken soak up the flavor.

I gave this recipe four stars because it tastes good and is easy to make, as well as remaining inexpensive. I would, however, modify it quite a bit the next time I make it. For instance, I don't agree with using a hot pepper sauce when I could use a teaspoon of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, or various other forms of heat and flavor that don't come in a bottle. I'm not saying not to use hot sauce and chili powder -- that is what makes it easy. I just would make the flavor a little more complex to suite my personal taste.

There was no flavor to it at all except heat. The combination of the veggies and the sauce was unappetizing. I have been with my boyfriend for year and cook dinner every night. I made this recipe about a month ago and we could not finish it. We ordered pizza. It's the only thing Ive made that he hasn't absolutly loved. And he couldn't even tolerate the taste.

This was so easy to make and very good. Not too spicy, but a nice warm tasty heat. I added garlic to the chicken while sauteing it, and instead of bell pepper, used zuchini and added some oregano as well. Toward the end, rather than using fresh tomato, I added a small can of diced tomatoes with chiles, and a half cup of sour cream. SOOO good. We did these fajita style. Will definately make again.

This was really good. I love spicy food so it really appealed to me. I think it would make a great filling for burritos if you combined it with some rice and shredded cheese.

I used Pam instead of olive oil, sprinkled liberal amounts of cumin and garlic and when I removed the chicken from the skillet, I added about 1/4 cup of water and more or less steamed the veggies which brought more of the flavor into the recipe then had I sauteed them.  Not to mention it is much healthier than more oil.  I added the chicken to the veggies and served over steamed rice.  Plopped a nice helping of fat free plain yogurt ontop and my family went nuts.  This is a great recipe and nothing was missing except maybe some tortilla chips.  They, however, are not on my diet.

This was really good!  I replaced the fresh tomatoes and jalapenos with a can of diced tomatoes with chiles and added 1/2 cup of sour cream and an extra tablespoon of chili powder.  My husband refuses to eat just about anything that contains vegetables, especially onions, and after I coerced him into trying this, he loved it more than I did!

Tasted great! We made it without the jalapenos.  Next time we will probably use more than the 1 tablespoonn of chilli powder, and more than 10 drops of hot sauce to make things a bit hotter.

This was a simple, good recipe, but probably too spicy for children.  We modified it by putting in a can of diced tomatoes and jalapenos (they come together in one can now) because we are too lazy to cut those ingredients and it worked out great.

Being in the UK I needed to find some new recipes to feed my hungry hubby.
This dish was absolutely FAB!!!! Instead of adding a fresh tomato add a can of chopped tomatoes with chillies to add extra spice and to give a slightly dry dish a little sauce. YUM!

Very tasty! I added more jalepeno peppers and hot sauce and also added some sour cream to make the sauce thick and creamy.  We served it over white rice and was excellent!

This made a good weeknight dinner and was so easy to prepare! I used fresh tomatoes and cut up a roasted jalapeno I had on hand in place of the canned tomatoes.  It had just the right kick for us, served with the Spanish Rice II recipe.  If you like really spicy food, I'd add something extra.  Also made great leftovers!

This is a very delicious, spicy chicken dish!  Easy to prepare for me and the family loved it!  I served it as more of a "fajita" mixture with tortillas, but it would be great alone or over rice, as well.

Tried this recipe last night and it was wonderful.  I added fresh cilantro and some chopped chipolte peppers in adobo sauce.  Served it over spanish rice and topped it with some shredded cheddar as some other reviewers did.  Will be making this again and again!

I listened to the other reviewers that mentioned that this recipe was missing that special something and I added three tablespoons of sour cream when I combined the chicken and the veggies - this gave it quite a bit of ZING!  I also doubled the amount of Tabasco.  Terrrrrriffic!

My family and I love this recipe. It is very easy to make and is a meal that
my two teenage sons can not get enough of. In fact I have had to almost 
triple the recipe just to make enough. Plus it is easy to adjust the seasoning
according to personal taste. For instance my mother-in-law does not like spicy food
so I cut back a little on the jalapenos and when she tasted it immediately asked
for the recipe. I can't say enough about this recipe.

This reminds me of cajun meals. Although I am not a huge fan of cajun, this was so easy to make and tasted good, especially for a weekday dinner that I think it deserves 3 stars.

This was great.  I used red pepper instead of green and a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  I also wanted more veggies so I used some chopped zucchini and 1/2 can of corn.  We will make this again.

Through this recipe I discovered that I may be allergic to jalepeno peppers OR it just had way too much! I doubled the recipe, but still only used 2 jalepenos and a mild hot pepper. TOO MUCH! It killed the flavor that I worked so hard to modify from the recipe.   Minus the jalepeno, I knew it woud've been so tasty! Add some chicken broth to the mixture so it doesn't burn. I also used on my chicken "kicked up chicken spice" by Weber Grill Creations in the spice aisle. Used 2 bell peppers; 1 green 1 yellow for color. Otherwise the meal was great! Follow previous modifications too.   P.S. My fiance rated it 9/10 because of the spicy factor, and he actually likes spice. Said it was too much. We ate it w/ spainish rice, but next time it's for sure going in tortillas with some sour cream!

Kinda dry. I picked this recipe more based on the picture than what the recipe was about and I think if we would have followed what alot of the other reviewers wrote and served it with a little bit of sour cream and cheese it would have made a big difference. It was quick and easy so I would probably try it again. We served it over rice but I might try wraps.

This was a great recipe because the ingredients were simple enough for me, as I am not the cook in my home my husband is.  I wanted to cook dinner for him on this particular day.  I read some reviews and took a bit of something from every review I read and it turned out great.  I didn't measure, so it was spicy hot, but sour cream and a soft torilla with a little rice sprinkled with some mozzerella cheese made the spice fit well and taste awesome.  Good recipe for an amateur cook like myself.  At the writing of this review my husband has not tasted it yet, he is still out fishing.  Can't wait for his review!  I am so glad everyone included their modifications to the recipe it helped me alot.  Thanks everyone.

This was good.  It wasn’t by any means bland, but it didn’t have that wow factor either.  It was fairly easy and seemed healthy.  A lot of the reviews mentioned that the dish turned out bland, so I modified it quite a bit to try and prevent this from happening.  I used one green bell pepper, one red bell pepper, and 1 can of diced tomatoes with the juice.  I added 2 ½ t. minced garlic, 1 t. cumin, 1 t. oregano, and ¼ t. cayenne pepper.  I also omitted the hot pepper sauce because I didn’t feel like counting out twenty drops of sauce to add to the recipe.  I seasoned the chicken with pepper, salt, Cajun seasoning, and chili powder, and then sautéed it in a little bit of chicken broth.  After it had cooked for a few minutes, I added the peppers, onion, and some garlic and sautéed those with the chicken in hopes to give it more flavor.  I also added cornstarch to the mixture to thicken it into more of a sauce.  I served the dish over rice, but I think I’d prefer it in a tortilla, hard taco shell, or over a bed of tortilla chips; either of the last two options would be especially good as I felt like there should have been a crunchy element to the dish.  When served over rice, it seemed a little like a casserole, but it wasn’t bad.

Very tasty! Followed the recipe pretty much exactly, but added more onion a little garlic, and did not use any oil. Served with brown rice/cilantro combo and sour cream. Was a lot like a fajita minus the tortilla. I will definitely be making this meal again.

Really bland.  I agree with whoever said that it "smelled better than it tasted."  If there was an option for 2.5 stars, that's what it would get.

For everything that went into this I found it very bland. It was spicy but that's about all there was. Hopefully that makes sense to someone out there. Not a keeper at my house.

YUM, YUM, YUM! I took parts of someone elses suggestion. :) I added salsa & water to make a sauce. I did not use as many jalapenos as suggested and cut back on the hot sauce because we like our food hot, but not that hot. And we have small children that won't eat really hot food. They did like this though!   I made this with Mexican Rice III by ALANSMOM (which is DELICIOUS!!!) and it was GREAT! My kids ate it with cheese quesadillas, my husband made his into a quesadilla and I ate mine with the rice rolled up in a tortilla.   I was apprehensive about all the chili powder, but it is delicious! If you are thinking twice...JUST TRY IT!!! I LOVE that it is healthy too! This will be a frequent meal in our house! Thank You Lorrie!!

This dish is so flavorful, but very spicy!  Being lactose intolerant I couldn't add sour cream to cool it down, so I left out all the hot sauce, and halved the jalapenos.  Next time I would halve the chili powder as well.  Make sure to serve this with rice!
Other changes I made were to add corn, and use canned chopped tomatoes.

This was pretty good, not our favorite though. I felt like it was missing something, possibly a sauce. I did use canned diced tomatoes instead of a fresh one and served it over rice.

This was OK. Nothing to "rave" abt., but good. Prep time is a bit off (took me 10+ min. to chop, mince, etc.). Made this last night for my bf & I (I chopped the veggies last wk. thinking I was going to make this then...). I'm glad to have done the prep beforehand as the end result is not worth more than 10 min. IMHO. My bf really enjoyed this, but he thought it wasn't spicy enough. Said it reminded him of a stir-fry (he, an Asian food fanatic, says many stir frys are made w/ chili powder - who knew!). This reminded me of a fajita. I would personally serve over steamed white rice or as a fajita-style burrito (i.e. w/ the chx. / veggie mix., cheese, salsa, sour cream & rice as a filling, a sauce over the top, a sprinkling of cheddar, then baked). We had ours w/ tostadas & Spanish rice. My only change was adding 1.5 cloves of jarred minced garlic w/ the onion & green pepper. If I make this again, I'd cut my onion into lg. chunks (instead of finely chopped), use 1 more chx. breast (they come 3 per pkg. at my grocer & I would have liked more meat!) & stir-fry the veggies until crisp-tender (like a true stir-fry... but if preparing fajita-style, as directed). I also think I'll garnish w/ cilantro & a squeeze of fresh lime & sub. a can of Rotel tomatoes & grn. chilies (to add moisture & heat), but still add the jalapenos. This made more than enough for us (3 tostadas pp). Oh, & I like to use green peppers - they are very economical. Thx. for sharing such a versatile recipe!

To quote from my husband, "I love it." I added sour cream to make a sauce, and it was a great choice. I also added some "Pennsylvania Jack" cheese during the last three minutes of cooking. PA Jack is similar to mozzarella, so adding mozzarella would work well also. Oh, and my husband informed me that to spice this recipe up even more, I can add the jalepenos at the end of the cooking time, without sauteeing them. That would be too hot for me, but if you like spice, you might consider doing that. Overall, this is a recipe I'll make again.

Terrific dish! I omitted the jalapenos, hot sauce & the 1/2 Tbsp chili pepper and added 1/2 cup of sour cream and 2 cloves of garlic! Delicious! There are so many options with this dish. I think next we will try with tortillas and cheese. Looking forward to trying it!

This is a great base recipe to add to to suit your tastes.  I used canned diced tomatoes because I didn't have any fresh.  I also added a can of black beans and a can of corn.  I used a half of a cup of chicken broth to give me a little more sauce and let it all simmer for a few minutes.  It was great over rice, but even better as quesadillas next day for lunch!

This is truly an amazing recipe. I put it over tortilla chips and topped it with sour cream and cheese. My daughter loved it. She normally does not like bell peppers and tomatoes. She ate every bite.  It was really good.

I have to say...wow. Very yummy! I didn't have any bell peppers or jalepeno peppers handy, so instead I used a thai chili pepper and added half a can of black beans and also half a cup of brown rice. It's so good! I will definantly make again.

Lowered the heat some...did not put the red pepper sauce in. Used can tomatoes because that's what I had and still turned out great...more sodium though.

We loved this! It was yummy and easy! I added a can of black beans to it and served Mexican rice on the side. We put sour cream and cheese on it and made soft tacos. My husband said he could eat it once a week.

Amazing recipe. Loved it and even my guest that I had over said it was like a five star dinner. I did not use the tortilla shell though.

Really good recipe. I had to play with the hot sauce a bit to fit my family's flavor. I ended up using a little less than the recipe stated. Otherwise it was enjoyed by all

Wow, my boyfriend of 7 years made this for me and am super happy to finally see that he can cook! I made this a second time and it tasted great both times! It's easy to make. We added shrimp and garlic to ours and ate it like fajitas. But we did not use jalepenos. A definite 5 star meal!

This recipe was great! If you like spicy but not too spicy I would only add one hot pepper. I served this with some Mexican rice and tortillas and it was a big hit with the family. We ate it for leftovers the next night and it tasted just as good!

it wasn't bad but it wasn't as fabulous as i thought it would be after a rather involved prep and so many ingredients.  it wasn't as flavorful and certainly not as spicey as i thought it would be!

Yummy recipe.  I added some sour cream, garlic, a bit more chili powder and hot sauce to the mix and it was really good.  Served it on corn tortillas.

It was okay. I added extra chili powder, cumin, and some garlic. Served over rice. I think it would have been better with some tortillas.

This was a keeper for our family. It was just hot enough, but if you like it even hotter, you might try adding a small, minced red Serrano, Cayenne, Thai, or Habanero pepper, which will also add some more colour.  I served this with a handful of round corn chips on the side. Don't cut the chicken pieces too small. Will definitely make this one again.

I liked this recipe, but I didn't love it.  I thought it was rather bland and had to add more hot sauce to it.  It's very healthy, however, and I would probably make it again on a week night, but it's nothing special.

I really liked this!  I did add some chopped fresh garlic, used red and yellow peppers instead of green because it's what I had, and left out the hot pepper sauce because I don't like the taste.  I added a sprinkle of cayenne instead.  I also had some cherry tomatoes to use up and I chopped them up coarsely in my food processor instead of large pieces like the recipe suggested because I don't like big chunks of cooked tomato.  I will definitely be making this again.

Even after adding the rotel and garlic like others suggested, this recipe was still VERY bland to my taste.  I added cumin, more garlic, more salt, tomato paste, and extra hot sauce before this was even worth eating.  Served it on tortillas with cheddar cheese, sour cream, and cilantro and it was passable.  I probably won't make this one again.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  It is easy to make, and most of the ingredients we have on hand at all times.  I have started using jalepeno slices instead of fresh jalepenos to cut back on the prep time.  :)

This was a good recipe.  I would not rave about it, but it did taste good.  I think it could have used a little less spiciness, and some other seasonings to give it more flavor.

This was alright, i wasn't too crazy about it. My husband really liked it. I didn't have chicken so i used veal. And I didn't use 2 jalapenos or the hot sauce because I thought that it would be too hot.Not at all.. I will definitly make it spicier next time. i also had served it "fajita" style and added cheese. I'll make again although next time I'll add more.

Yum, this was delicious!  I used red and green peppers and served with tortillas (kind of made fajitas with cheddar cheese and sour cream) but next time I think I'll serve it over white rice.  very tasty! Will definately make again :o)

I scaled to 4 servings and found 1 jalapeno enough spice...would NEVER include 4 jalapenos...also, like others I found the whole mixture a little dry so I will take the suggestions of others and add sour cream next time (also will used canned tomatoes for extra juice) Overall, a hit...My husband loved it and with 1 jalapeno my 6 and 7 year olds loved it too...

This recipe was emailed to me by a friend because of the "Cape Cod" connection.  I tried it but was distracted so accidently added a couple extra drops of the hot pepper sauce - Wow!!!

What a winner of a recipe!! Like many have commented before, I fiddled with the spiciness to get it to what we prefer. Plus, I added a crushed clove of garlic to the onions and peppers. And then put the dish over Jasmine rice. Yummy!!!

This was great!  Everyone loved it, even with all the chili powder.  I served this in warm tortillas with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of cheddar.  Will definitely make this again because it is delicious, quick, and easy.

Not my favorite recipe from this site, by far. On the good side, it is quick and made with lots of ingredients on hand. However, my kids wouldn't eat it and I enjoyed it only mildly. I made it into a nachos type thing with chips -- tortillas would be good, too, but it needs eating with something else, not just by itself. overall, just ok at best.

This was SOOOO good.  It was super easy and not as spicy as you think it would be.  I served it over long grain rice with colby jack cheese melted into it.  Amazing!!

I thought this recipe was pretty good but would be better with a fajita seasoning packet.  I really liked the spicyness of this recipe.

I like this recipe better than Mexican Chicken (also found in Allrecipe). They both have similar ingredients but I found that Acapulco Chicken was a lot better.

Absolutely, hands-down, the easiest, tastiest, dish you can make.  I thought that the flavors were absolutley wonderful and i felt that it was healthy as well.  I served it over rice and my boyfriend just ate it by itself.  I used ideas from the other reviewers and added zucchini and fresh garlic.  It was a hit and i will definitely be making again!

Quick and easy. High Flavor. Made the recipe as written but sprinkled both fajita seasoning and chili powder on the chicken, sauteed two cloves of minced garlic with the meat, blended in 1/2 cup of fresh pico de gallo and extra cilantro with the remaining ingredients. A very satisfying meal!!

very good, very easy, my husband loved it--a little too spicy for me, though. I served it over rice, and i found mixing it with a little sour cream cut the fire a tad. Next time i will add more veggies like broccoli and maybe water chestnuts. All in all, a good dinner!

I served it over rice as is suggested in the recipe, and it was yummy, but I would have liked to have had a sauce since it was over rice.  the flavor was good, though I did add the extra chili powder and some garlic salt.  i think I'll try it with canned tomatoes to create a sauce next time.  it was a twist on fajitas in my oppinion and I served it with flour tortillas.  I'll make it again.

I took another cooks advice and added 3/4 cup of sour cream.. I find that fixes just about any dish!!  I also added quite a bit more hot sauce as we really do like it hot! I would put the tomatoes in at the very end so they stay intact.  Very tasty over rice. This will make its way into my own recipe data base for convenience.

This was all right. I didn't use the hot sauce because I wanted to avoid too much heartburn, so maybe that was the difference, but the flavor didn't do anything special for me.

This recipe was pretty good.  It didn't knock my socks off, but it had a good taste and was quick and easy to make.  I used canned green chilis instead of jalapenos, and canned diced tomatoes, since I didn't have any fresh tomatoes around.  Also, I substituted hot taco sauce for the hot pepper sauce.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is delicious!! I added two red bell peppers to give an irrisistable flavour. For the dryness problem, add chunky cut tomotoes about 5 minutes before it is ready. I also added a mexican mixture of spices...and cooked it all together....covered and on high in a teflon pan, let it stick to the bottom lightly, and lift with a wooden spoon, it almost caramelizes...um,um,good!!

My husband and I thought the chicken was a little bland.  We were expecting something a lot more spicy than it was.  We probably wont have this again.

This dish was Excellent!! I used 3 chicken breasts and less peppers & onions.. it depends on your taste, tomatoes are a must.For extra flavor I sauted cilantro with the veggies & garlic. Dish the chicken & its sauce over a bed of rice and melt a couple of thin slices of pepperjack cheese on top!

This was good, but actually a little on the bland side considering all the "hot" spices in it.  I was actually hesitant taking the first bite thinking it was going to be very spicy, but it isn't at all.  I served it over rice.  Overall my husband and I both liked it, but I will experiment with the spices if I make it again.

I was dissapointed with this recipe. I tasted just like any other chicken stir-fry to 
me. That said I will make it again, but this time I'll add more hot sauce, and 
maybe some more chili powder. I think this recipe has the potential to be great.

My husband and I both rather enjoyed this meal.  I cannot eat foods that are extremely spicy, so I only added one Jalapeno and used under a teaspoon of chili poweder.  I also used about half the hot sauce and added no salt or pepper.  Even then it was rather spicy!  But it was still good.  Although I generally make my fajitas that way, these seasonings (and the tomatoes) added that extra something that made it a nice change.  I served it over spanish rice.

Yum!  Yum!  So easy and healthy too.  I doubled the hot sauce and jalapeno peppers because we love spicy food.  Served over a bed of rice and topped with sharp cheddar cheese, you can't beat it!

I chose to make this dish extra spicy, and it worked out well.  Go nuts, this is a simple dish, so I would recomend experimenting with it.  Try using zucchini too.

I took the reviews into consideration by adding a pinch of cinnamon (great) and 1/2 cup of sour cream towards the end(so good). Followed the rest by the recipe. It has a pleasant kick for those who like a medium level of spicy. This is a very versatile and quick recipe that will be in the regular rotation. The picture is an after thought, but helpful to know what was leftover. Paired with a cup of white rice in a tortilla and a side salad for two.

My husband and I loved this recipe! The only thing we changed was adding more veggies, simply because we're trying to incorporate more into our diet. We added one small zucchini, one small summer squash, and we added a red bell pepper on top of the green bell pepper. Thanks for the recipe!

I did some of my own preferences in regard to this as well as any other recipe. I used chicken thighs instead of breast, more flavor and not as dry. Added two small minced Serrano peppers and omitted the 10 drops of hot sauce.

As a side note instead of serving over rice I served it over riced vegetables. Really turned out well and if you didn't know you would have thought it was rice and not veggies.

Very flavorful and fresh tasting dish, will definitely make again.

Delicious! I added 1/2 cup of sour cream, as suggested by another reviewer. I used yellow and orange bell peppers instead of the green ones for added color. Perfect over white rice .

YUM!  We loved this one! I was out of jalapeno peppers, so I just omitted them.  It did not have much heat, and we be really great with them added (or if omitted, add a few more drops of hot pepper sauce).  I served it over cooked white rice.  I can't wait to have this one again!

As the recipe was, it only gets a three from me. I have to agree with others that it was missing something. (I always make 2 one the way the recipe says and one that is tweaked.) the one I tweaked was alot better. I added garlic salt (to taste) and I had some creole seasoning left over from another recipe. I added that to the chicken. It turned out great. Thanks for the recipe I will make it the way I did it from now on.

This is delicious. My boyfriend loves it and I make it usually once a week. I'm on a low carb diet so I don't make any rice. I also add sour cream and a can of diced tomatoes and since we like spicy food I use 4 Jalapenos. I add red bell pepper so that it gives me more veggies and one time I used yellow cause the store didn't have red and it was just as yummy.

Great fast and tasty recipe. Used half a can of tomatoes since didn't have any fresh. Wasn't very spicy so next time may add another pepper or two. Husband liked it as is though. Served over rice.

Very tasty!  Lets see, I cut the chicken into strips and just rubbed in chili powder on both sides, didn't really measure it and lightly salt and peppered them.  I sauted some garlic with the pepper and onion and added some cumin and onion powder and the hot sauce.  I used a can of diced tomatoes and jalopenos instead of fresh ones and it turned out great.  I put the chicken in tortillas with Sargentos new Cheddar Salsa Jalapeno Cheese and everyone went back for seconds! thanks for the recipe

This was excellent! I would suggest a few changes, though. I didn't measure the chili powder but after cutting up the chicken, made sure each piece was coated with the powder. Then I lightly salted and peppered. I also used my wok, which I love cooking with. I used penut oil instead of olive oil and thought it gave it a better taste. Beore adding the chicken to the preheated penut oil, I added 2 cloved of minced fresh garlic. This also gave it more flavor. Finally, instead of the hot pepper sauce, I used one red chili from my garden and man! was it just right. So, even though I changed the recipe, I never would have thought of this combination on my own! It was great!

This was okay ... kind of bland. It was easy to make but I don't know if I'd try it again.

I substituted 1 habanero seeded for the jalapenos because I knew it did not sound spicy enough for our tastes and it was pretty good, but we ate it like a stew in a bowl.  Not over rice.

Hiya Lorrie.. Awesome recipe.. I've now made it twice in the same week (kids request).. I followed your recipe almost precisely when I made it for the family on Saturday night.. then the kids requested it again on Tues.. this time I didn't cut up the chicken and put the veggies on top of the chicken..  I'm not sure which way I liked it better.. lol  This is an easy meal to put on the table quickly on busy nights.. the heat warms the inside of your mouth, but not so bad you need gallons of fluid to put out the flames.. also, my oldest son (a Cape Codder himself) took grilled steak the next day and mixed in the leftovers.. He seemed to also enjoy that.. So Steak is also a nice alternative if in a beef kind of mood.. I certainly would make it again.. 
Thanks for posting the recipe Lorrie.. Enjoy the Cape..  :)

As others have said, it was good but missing something.  I doubled the chili powder and the jalapenos. I also added some ground cumin.  It was really spicy, which we love, but missing some flavor.  Maybe I'll try some extra garlic and sour cream next time.

Love this recipe!  The only change I make is omitting the bell pepper (personal preference). It is a regular recipe for us as it is so quick and easy to make- a great weeknight meal.  Would also be good using thin strips of beef instead of chicken.

Not bad... missing something tho. I used yellow and green peppers, added garlic, corn, and bit of salsa. I will definately make this again but have to think about what it's missing.

I made this recipe as-is, and it was a bit spicy, but of course that can be adjusted to a person's taste. But overall we didn't care for it very much. Would not make again.

I've made this recipe many times this summer and with many different variantions. The only thing I always do is add chicken broth to moisten it up a little (I've never tried it with sour cream as many reviewers suggest, but I maytry sometime) I add different veggies depending on what I have on hand (broccoli is my favorite). I also have never used jalapenos, as I have an abundance of red chili peppers growing in my garden and have to look for excuses to use them all. Serve it with rice.

I'll admit that I did not follow the recipe exactly.  I added garlic and sour cream to the mix (as recommended) and yet it just wasn't as tasty as I had hoped.  It had the heat but not the flavor.

This was really quite good.  I did increase the chili powder to 2 tablespoons.   Since I didn't have fresh tomatoes or jalapeno peppers I used a can of diced tomatoes and added 2 ounces of canned diced chilies.   As suggested by others, I added 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I think the next time I will leave this out.   I will certainly be making this again.

We loved this and thought it was easy and delicious.  I added garlic, used only one jalapeno (all I had), and used two tomatos.  Also, so the kids wouldn't complain, I left out the hot sauce and my husband and I added it to our own plates.  Oh, and I added a little sour cream as others had suggested.  I thought it had a lot of flavor.

A real winner!!  I let it simmer about 15 minutes longer and served it over Spanish rice and it was fantastic.  I used an additional jalapeno and a considerable amount of hot sauce and it still was only "fairly spicy."  I would recommend and extra hot pepper and maybe even a few hits of cayenne.

This recipe was good but not as flavorful as I expected.  Next time, I would add garlic, more tomatoes, and use seasoned rice.  I'd also add more heat, maybe with some cayenne pepper.

I read the reviews beforehand and saw a lot of comments on not spicy enough - and since I'm not a big spice fan, I went with it exactly as the recipe called for it and it was really good!  A little zing but not too much for me.

This is a nice recipe, however, it does need some additional heat.  I use 4 jalapeno peppers and extra hot sauce.  Have made it several times.
