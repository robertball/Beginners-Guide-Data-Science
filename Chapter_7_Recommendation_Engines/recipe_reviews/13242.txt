Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! This is a great dessert soup which has good flavor with the cinnamon and nutmeg added.  My only change was to half the recipe to 6 servings.  I did cut back on the sugar slightly.  I didn't have mint available so I served this with the Strawberry Bread recipe (also very good) cut up in cubes.  This is a rather thin sauce like soup which kind of looks like melted strawberry ice cream and would be great on a hot summer day!

This was so good. I had a strawberry soup once when on a cruise ship and I wanted to try making it when I got home. It's just as good on dry land! :)

This was a BIG hit.  Even the kids loved and kept asking for more.  Left out the netmeg(didn't have) and had no frozen whipped topping so I made some from whipping cream.  Fresh strawberry's are a must, the frozen one's don't mix up well.

Used 1/2 cup sugar, frozen strawberries without sugar, fatfree whipped topping and fat free yogurt instead of sour cream. We really liked it in our house.

This is a fabulous dessert and is always a huge hit! I use angel food cake for the croutons instead of pound cake. They are light and airy and soak up the soup beautifully.

This was awesome! Served it with Oreos and pound cake slices. Kids LOVED it! Keeper recipe, for sure. I used frozen strawberries and ended up blending everything together in a blender after first trying the Kitchen Aid. Healthier changes: used 3/4 cup sugar, low-fat cool-whip & low-fat sour cream

so good! i used this recipe as a general idea, but changed some things. i used half a container of whipped topping, one carton of strawberries, 1/4 tsp of pumpkin spice (very nice touch, gave it some extra zing), 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract, and sugar to taste w/ 4 tBsp sour cream. veryyyy good. and i garnished with the little leafy things from the tops of the strawberiies! :) 5 stars!!

Everyone loved this in my house. The only change I would make would be to cut down on the sugar; it was waaaaay too sweet for us.

In addition, I plan to try this with my own whipped topping. I'm not thrilled with the hydrogenated oil in store-bought whipped topping, so I'd be interested to see how it would work with my own whipped cream. I think it would be fine, given the consistency of the final product. Overall, this is a fine summer dish. Very refreshing!

I've made this twice now. Once with the store bought whipped topping, and once with my own homemade whipped cream. It was delicious both ways.

This is a delicious recipe! I simply just serve the soup and omit the pound cake. For best results, make sure you give the soup plenty of time to chill and I even like to place the chilled bowls of soup in the freezer for a bit before serving.

This was tasty and something different. In my opinion, it's more of a dip for something than an eat-it-by-itself soup. I tried freezing it, and that was tasty as well, though a bit on the icy side. My store was out of frozen strawberries, and fresh strawberries were too expensive... so I used strawberries packed in sugar. I rinsed the strawberries off in a collander and did not add the sugar called for in the recipe. It worked out quite well.

While I would classify this as more of a mousse/dessert rather than a soup, it tasted wonderful and I plan to add it to my fondue list as a fruit dip.

This was amazing!  You must try it.  I was blown away.  It sounded interesting, and i had left over strawberries that I had to use up so I tried it.  It was a great dessert on a hot summer night.  Just a tip, cut back on the sugar.

Decadent and delicious. You could definitely use almond milk to lower the fat content and use stevia to reduce the sugar content. But all in all, SO delish! Bright this as dessert to a friend's house and the kids kept asking for more.

This soup was amazing! The only thing I did different was I used 2 cups whipping cream and made that instead of using the frozen cool whip.  Everyone love it have already been asked to bring it to our ladies garden club!

I rated 4 stars because I didn't make it exactly by the recipe. I followed advice from other reviews and used only 1/2 cup of sugar. I used 2 cups of heavy whipping cream instead of the cool whip. My strawberries didn't blend well by just putting them in the mixer, so I pureed them first and used 2 cups of pureed strawberries. I took 1 tsp of unflavored gelatin and mixed with 1 tablespoon cold water.  Once the gelatin swelled, I microwaved for 15 seconds add to the whipped cream.  This stabilizes the whipped cream. The consistency was more like a mousse.  I served it with cubes of cream cheese pound cake untoasted. I served this to 70 people at a Valentine banquet.  Everyone loved it. It was also very pretty. My version yielded 9 servings of 1/2 cup each.

This soup received rave reviews from everyone who ate it.  I was taking it to a party and needed to make a double batch.  I decided to make to make the soup separately and mix the batches together, and I'm glad I did it that way.  Though the first batch was delicious, it was a bit too sweet.  In making the second batch, I cut the sugar in half and used vanilla Greek yogurt instead of the cool whip.  That also was delicious.  When I mixed the two batches together, it was a perfect soup.  This soup is more like a desert.

I found this recipe while looking for ideas for a Mothers' Tea for the ladies of our church. since this was the first time I tried it, I made it the night before. It was quick, easy and stored well overnight. The ladies all loved it! 
The only thing I did not do from the recipe, was serve it with mint and strawberries. Instead, I served it with the toasted pound cake croutons and fresh blueberries.
