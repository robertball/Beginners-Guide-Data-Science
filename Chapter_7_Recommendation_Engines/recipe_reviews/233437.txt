Hello, I'm the submitter of this recipe. You can substitute fresh chopped basil for the cilantro in the vinaigrette if you choose :) Enjoy!

I've made this salad in the fall when I didn't have all the veggies & then when I could follow the recipe. Always a huge hit! The vinaigrette is excellent.

This salad was a huge hit at my dinner party. Roasted all the veggies earlier in the day to save time. My guests went back for seconds and thirds! Highly recommend!

This was absolutely wonderful.  Everyone loved it at the party, and I was asked for the recipe several times.  I used only basil instead of all the other herbs, and grilled asparagus, yellow squash, red bell peppers and a red onion.  Definitely a repeat.

this has many ingredients and does require a lot of prep. I like to do these type of veggie recipes. I hate cilantro, so I subbed basil as suggested. I used fresh ingredients not to include fresh dill or parsley. the salad tasted a little to sweet to me, i'll add more lemon to my bowl. wife and daughter loved it, me too with some more lemon. this makes a ton. can't wait to grill some chicken and pineapples to serve this with! excellent recipe. highly recommended! up-date-- I did the chopping and my moose made the dressing. after trying it. it was too sweet. found out the daughter had increased and mixed up the red wine vinegar and balsamic up...oops, now I understand why it was too sweet. not the recipe's fault!!

I didn't have time to grill so I put the vegetables already cut up in a big foil roasting pan and put them under the broiler. The green onions cooked quickly so I took them out after a couple of minutes. The only change I made was to use dried dill and frozen corn because I didn't have fresh. This was great and my son who eats Paleo thought it was delicious. I put some feta on the side for people to add if they wanted to. I will definitely make this again.

Very pretty, easy and good salad.  As a personal preference I used just half the dill. I grilled the veggies a day in advance and wanted them to stay crisp/firm so I left them unsalted and added 1/2 tsp salt to the dressing, which was mixed with the salad about 20 minutes before serving.  The leftovers held up very well.  Thanks, Celeste!

Oh my! This went over even better than expected at our 4th of July dinner! What a great alternative to mayo laden sides at a BBQ, so everyone went to town on the big beautiful platter covered with colorful vegetables. I changed up the vegetables a little bit and I doubled everything. I left out the corn but added whole fresh carrots with a bit of the green top left on them and a couple sliced sweet potatoes. I left everything whole and arranged around a big platter alternating colors, then drizzled with the dressing, so didn't need all of it (I used just basil, but quite a bit of it). I also drizzled with a bit of balsamic glaze. This requires some planning but it is easy. I loved not having to worry about it getting "cold" while grilling the steaks and salmon, it's great even at room temp. Thanks, Celeste! It's already been requested at our next gathering!!

Delicious!  Will make again.  Used veggies I had on hand.  Very adaptable. Served over rice.

I was worried it was too many vegetables, but they shrink down a lot when cooked.

I followed others suggestions and used less than half of the dressing. Will make this again.

Delicious. Wondering how far in advance I could grille the vegetables, store them and still have good texture and flavor??

i basically used this recipe for the dressing.. i was actually pleasantly surprised at how well this went with the veggies we had grilled (red onion, mushrooms, green and orange bell peppers, and zucchini).. i left out the shallot and chives (didn't have any).. used regular balsamic vinegar.. doubled the garlic.. used dried dill.. and reduced the olive oil significantly.. looking forward to making this again.. ty for the recipe

Absolutely delicious! Love the fact that you can make in advance. I cut up all the veggies, added mushrooms as they needed to be used up. Made the vinaigrette ahead of time. We grilled it with Rusty Chicken thighs. Thanks a lot Celeste for sharing this! We will make it a lot this summer!

A hit! I found it only needs half the quantity of vinaigrette called for. I am sure it would be equally good with any mix of vegetables. I chose this recipe because I could grill the vegetables in advance and free up the grill for preparing the rest of the meal.

Great Meal for Meatless Mondays!! Did add some feta just for some added pizzazz, but that only added to a great summer meal!!
