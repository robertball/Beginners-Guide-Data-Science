Grilling time should vary depending on the particular vegetable and what size it is cut to.  The more tender vegetables should be cooked over a shorter time period and perhaps seperate skewers with similar vegetables can be used to allow for the variety of different grilling times required.

The picture provided is somewhat misleading as you have to search beyond the sliced, grilled beef in the foreground.  Hmm, presumably that is a suggested accompaniment for this dish.

This recipe could be so much more, but just wasn't. Bland is definitely right.  Won't make again. Thanks!

Loved the idea of the grilled vegies, however, we felt this pasta dish was a bit boring.

grilled veggies qith pasta and a bit of olive oil is really nice, I don't see the point  of the spice nor the balsamic in this case....needless salt and it kills the flavour of the grilled veggies.

This recipe was a hit! I was asked for the recipe at my book club meeting and again at a BBQ a few weeks later. The key is the grilled veggies - I also used port. mush. and asparagus. The grill basket works great for this. Do not dress the salad until just before you eat - best served at room temp. too.

My family flipped for this salad. Everyone said it was the best I had ever brought to a gathering. Taste is well worth the hard work of grilling all the veggies on the BBQ out back in the rain!
