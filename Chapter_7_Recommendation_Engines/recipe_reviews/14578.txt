I LOVE this sweet sauce.  I've been making it for about a year and have passed it onto several people.  I only use about 1/2 the packet of onion soup mix and 1/2 of the worcestershire called for.  I also add a tablespoon or two of pineapple juice (something my grandma always added to her bbq sauces).  This sauce makes delicious ham bbq sandwiches.  Just whip up the sauce and add some finely chipped ham.

Not a bad barbeque sauce considering it's simplicity...ingredients I always have one hand.  I, too, cut down on the onion soup mix a little, and added some orange juice (didn't have pineapple like other reviewer!)
There are better BBQ sauce recipes, but this one is tops for simplicity!  We put it on chicken wings for the kids one night as they can't stand the heat of other recipes!

I am not one for bbq sauce, I have never really liked the taste of them.  But this sauce is delicious, I just added a little more brownsugar and I doubled the worcestershire sauce.

This was a great recipe. I altered it a little though. I added 2 tablespoons of Hickory BBQ Sauce, One teaspoon of hot sauce, some minced garlic, oregano, and pepper.  It added a little spice.  Nice!!

Not the best bbq sauce and that's being nice.  We did a taste test BEFORE brushing our chicken with it, thank goodness.  Our chicken would have tasted like ketchup otherwise.  Thankfully I had a bottle of bbq sauce in the fridge.  This recipe lacks on flavor.

A little sweet, and I recommend that you let this sit for a few hours to allow the sugar to incorporate so it won't be as grainy.  I'll make again when I forget to buy it.

Thanks for the recipe..I appreciate that you took the time to put it on here. I am not the biggest fan of vinegar and most recipes have vinegar in it.I was able to take what you did and add my own stuff to it and it was awesome..thank you so much!

I anticipated a Ketchupy BBQ sauce so I did alter mine a little bit.. I ommitted the worcestershire sauce (just don't like it for some reason) and added some ghost chili hot sauce, a jalapeno hot sauce, and a good amount of honey.. What I got was a kicked up, yet Tangy BBQ Sauce. I also simmered it in a small saucepan and did not have any grains of sugar or unblended ingredients. I have never made a BBQ sauce and wanted something a little different for my chicken tonight. This turned out AWESOME! Thanks for the recipe!!

from reading all the Review's I guess it's safe to say this is a good base for BBQ sauce. I substituted the brown sugar with honey, I started with 1/2 cup & added 1 more tsp. by doing that, I didnt have the grain problem that comes with the brown sugar, I give this 5 stars.

I made this one night because I was in a pinch for some bbq sauce for the brisket.  It's simple to make and is easily adjusted to fit your tastes.  I followed the review of someone else who mentioned adding hickory bbq sauce to it (but only after i tasted the original).  Just stirred in enough to make it to my liking.  You can adjust the amt of sugar, and Worcestershire sauce, to suit your tastes.  I inadvertently dumped the whole packet of dry soup mix in, so I had to double the recipe... i froze the extra in a mayonnaise jar.  Haven't used it yet to see how it fared after freezing.  Will update this review when I find out.

I liked this for the simplicity of it. I had everything I need in the pantry. However I didn't like the taste of it. It was good just not BBQ-ie enough. I added some Eastern NC style dry rub seasoning to it and that helped, though. This was good, just not what I was looking for.

I'm not Mamma Jones, but Papa Jones.  I will be using this simple recipe for rib night from now on. I was down to two tablespoons of bottled BBQ Sauce, when I went searching for a fridge and cupboard recipe. I found this and it did the trick. Easy to make and tasty too. Try it by the book, or modify to taste, it's good. Maybe a little Tabasco next time?

Not bad for a homemade bbq sauce. I did modify it by adding three tbs of cider vinegar and one tbs of crushed garlic and a tsp of corse sea salt and 1/2 tsp of fresh ground black pepper.

Great easy quick recipe! Only change I made is adding 2-3 tablespoons of Franks Hot sauce. Made several batches of this as having several parties-sure it will be a hit!

This was great BBQ sauce.  I used it for pulled pork, it was perfect.  The only thing I did different was to throw in the whole envelope of soup mix, because I didn't feel like hanging on to half a package.  And so simple!

I would absolutely make this again!! I have some sauce leftover to use for smoked meatloaf  tomorrow. I used this on chicken tonight. With the chicken put off to the side of the grill, let it incorporate for about 15 mins. No changes made at all. It will taste like ketchup, but once cooked it has a great taste.

I gave it 3 stars because it's a great base for creating your own special BBQ sauce. I added liquid smoke, I don't know how much vinegar...maybe 1/2 cup, a tbs of dijon mustard, 6 oz tomato paste, some pepper flakes, and a whole package of onion mix. Alas, no matter how much I tried, I couldn't get it tangy enough without turning it into water. And I still thought it was way too sweet. If I had to start over, I'd reduce the brown sugar to 1/4 cup or less. The vinegar definitely helped too.

This was quick and easy. Loved the sweet flavor. I added just a bit of liquid smoke because I didn't have the Worcestershire sauce. Delicious!

This is a sweet sauce, somewhat sweeter as-is than I would have cared for, and in the future I might modify it by adding less sugar or cutting the sweet with a little vinegar. However, I ate the whole pork chop I put this sauce on quickly, and was pretty eager for that next forkful, and the chops were tender and moist - so I can't give the sauce anything less than four stars. This is a great base recipe for cooks to start adapting to their own style. Thanks for sharing it -
