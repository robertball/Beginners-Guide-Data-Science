WOW!!  This salad definitley deserves 5 stars. The dressing is out of this world. I did add 1 tablespoon of sesame oil and 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds to the dressing and decreased the amount of oil to 1/3 cup. I put the dressing in a glass jar and shook it well. I let it sit for about 10 minutes to let the flavors develop. I used sliced almonds instead of cashews and toasted the ramen noodles in a skillet before sprinkling them on top.  I bet rotisserie chicken tossed in would be a great addition too.  Do not add the dressing unitl right before your ready to serve, otherwise it will become soggy. I give this salad my highest recommendation.

I usually don't review the recipes, but this one is such a hit with my family--including my two young boys!--that I've got to respond. A few changes: I added a big handful of chopped cilantro, and some carrot slices. Substituted rice vinegar and added 1T. peanut butter to dressing. Also, as a diabetic, I cut the sugar down to 1T, and nobody seems to miss it. We're making this at least twice a week now! An entire meal with some grilled chicken tossed in. Many thanks!

I recently served this at our neighborhood block party and it was a smash!  I usually coat the nuts, ramen noodle pieces with melted butter before I toast them and the key to preventing these to burning is to keep turning them while they are in the oven.  I add sesame seeds too.  I also boil the dressing for one minute to make sure the sugar dissolves properly and emulsifies.  Great salad-very versatile and everyone always likes it!

I use this recipe all the time!  I make a few changes though.

I use 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup white vinegar, 1 T. Sesame Seeds, 2 packets Splenda, 6 oz. slivered almonds, 2 packages of Chicken Ramen Noodles.  All other ingredients are the same!  Excellent!

I really liked this salad but did make a few changes to it to cut down on some fat.  I completely left out the ramen noodles and reduced the oil to 1/4 c, used 1/4 c of rice vinegar instead of cider, and substituted a packet of artificial sweetener in place of the sugar.  I'll make this recipe often.

I used a little less sugar and when it came time to bake the ramen noodles and cashews, I sprayed some butter (in those new nifty butter spray bottles) on both the baking sheet and overall and then lightly seasoned them with the chicken seasoning mix that came with the ramen noodles. Very good...we love these kinds of salads! Easy, quick and tasty!

This is delicious, instead of the prepackaged shredded coleslaw, use a head of chinese cabbage, slice thinly and follow the rest of the directions as instructed.  Our new favorite salad!

This is wonderful!!!  Everyone raved over it.  I will make this again and again and again.  I'm addicted! The only unfortunate thing is that it does not keep.  Must add dressing, nuts & noodles JUST before serving.

I've made this twice now.  The first time I made it as is, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. The cider vinegar was way too heavy for the slaw and there was too much sugar in the dressing. Tonight, I made it with rice vinegar, slivered almonds, and less sugar (about 1/4 - 1/3 of a cup instead of 1/2).  With those modifications, I think a 5 star recipe!

I've made several variations of this salad, and this one was the best.  I had so many compliments.  The only change I made to this recipe was an idea I got from a previous reviewer, and that is:  Before toasting the crushed noodles and cashews, spray them with spray butter and sprinkle the seasoning packet from the ramen noodles over top.  It adds flavor and is an easy step to incorporate.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I used a head of cabbage and shredded that which worked really well. I also used rice vinegar in place of the cider vinegar and scaled down the sugar to 1/4 cup. I also added 2 tablespoons of sesame seeds and sliced almonds which I toasted with the ramen. Really great recipe that obviously can be altered to a cooks taste. Thanks so much!

Waayyyyyyyy too sweet!  I subbed rice vinegar for the cider vinegar and used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Minced garlic might have been good, along with a bit of sesame oil, and sesame seeds.  If I make this again, I'm definitely cutting down on the sugar!

We love it!.. My additions are 1/2 tsp. sesame oil in the dressing and also some sesame seeds on the salad looks pretty!  For a main dish I add cooked/breaded/chopped chicken (Tyson),  mandarin oranges and a little chopped Italian parsley when I have it.  So yummy!  Be sure you whisk enough so it will emulsify before pouring on.; my preference is to pour over about 15 min before because the ramen can be pretty crunchy.. :)

I have been serving this salad for a few years and get rave reviews everytime.  A couple of variations I have used, each with great success are, you can use any type of nuts you prefer,just make sure you roast them for the full flavor. I have also used "Almond Accents" found in the produce section, using your flavor preference, excellent.  Broccoli slaw is very good also.  If serving to a large crowd, toasted peanuts work very well and are a bit more economical (I made it to serve 90 for a SuperBowl party.  I have never served it yet without requests for the recipe.  Highly suggest you give it a try.

So simple and SO yummy! This is a great salad that everyone has just loved so far! Wonderful! Tip: don't mix the dressing in with the salad until right before you are going to eat it and eat it all at once, otherwise the noodles and nuts lose their "crunchiness"!

So delish! My grandfather gave us a big head of cabbage from his garden, so had to figure out---what to do with this huge head of cabbage before we leave town for a week. Found this recipe, made it for company, I think they were ready to lick the bowl clean. Wouldn't change a thing.

My friends say this is the best Chinese Cabbage Salad they have ever had!  I always make a few changes, however:  1. Add another Tbsp. of soya sauce  2. Add some garlic puree or freshly pressed garlic (1 or 2 cloves) 3. Add the seasoning from the noodle package to the sauce (I use the oriental flavor) 4. Toast the noodles and nuts in a frying pan or in the oven until golden brown and then cool 5. Add toasted sliced almonds and sunflower seeds (more nuts is a definite must!) These additions make this salad to die for!

This was so good. I am not a fan of coleslaw but this is nothing like the original coleslaw. I actually used Chow Mein Noodles vs. Top Ramen noodles and it turned out GREAT! I will be making this again very soon.

Excellent. Took it to a superbowl party and it was gone by half time. People asked for the recipe. Used slivered almonds instead of cashews. Added the ramen seasoning packet to the dressing.

AWESOME salad.  Served it today and it was the first salad I have served in a while with NO leftovers!  The dressing is phenomenal.  I used chow mein noodles instead of ramen as it is hard to find here in Israel.

This recipe is awesome, and soooo easy.  I took it to a potluck and got raves!  I am a new mom with not a whole lot of time to cook, and this was so easy to throw together.  I also bought a bag of breaded chicken strips.  Popped them in the toaster oven, let them cool, then sliced them length-wise to throw in.  They were terrific!

Great recipe although I did make some of the adjustments suggested by other reviewers.  I decreased the oil to 1/3 cup and decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup.  I also added a tablespoon of sesame oil.  All of my friends devoured this salad and absolutely raved about it.

This was delicious.  It reminded me a lot of broccoli salad.  Next time I'll try olive oil in place of the veg. oil and either reduce the sugar or use splenda.  Excellent!

Very good.  Keep an eye on the Ramen noodles.  It doesn't take long for them to brown and if you don't watch, they will burn.  I will make this again.

This was a great salad.  I used used a 1/4 C olive oil and a tablespoon of sesame oil, 1/4 C sugar, and 1/4 C red wine vinegar for the dressing and it was plenty for the salad.

Wonderful Recipe!!!  I changed it slightly to serve more - I doubled the amount of dressing, doubled the ramen noodles, shredded a head of Nappa cabbage and used rice vinegar instead of cider (same amount of cashews and green onions).  I took it to a potluck and everyone LOVED it!!  Reminded me a lot of Applebee's Oriental Salad (you could add sliced chicken nuggets if you wanted more of a meal).

This was great. Had reservations about making this but wow was this good. We have had this once a week for the last three weeks. Thought to add a comment since I'm making it now. We enjoy ginger so I grate some fresh ginger reduce oil by half and add some minced garlic.

Oh so nice :)  I did make changes (shrugs - who doesn't nowadays lo), but followed the zen of the recipe.  Used almonds instead of cashews, napa cabbage instead of coleslaw, and cut oil in half (we're a sour family here).  Also used rice wine vinegar, a splash of sesame oil, and a few sprinkles of sesame seeds.  Outstanding.  Served with Sweet & sour meatballs and steamed rice.

This is sooo good! I followed the recipe exactly, but without cashews because I didn't have any. Very simple, easy and quick to put together. I will have this several times a week.

This was delicious! I did bring the dressing to a quick boil to blend the sugar. Next time I will cut the sugar down too. Don't put dressing on till your ready to serve, or it will make everything soggy!

I've had something similar with almonds, but tried this and liked the cashews, either nut is a good choice.  I also heated up the oil and sugar so that the sugar would dissolve.

Other than substituting almonds, I followed the recipe exactly.  The dressing needs no modifications.  Everything about this recipe is fantastic.  Stick to it, and you won't be sorry.

This is very easy to make.  I add a lb of cut up chicken breast and serve with a loaf of bread for main meal.  My kids love this one and is also great to bring to someone's house when recipe needed!

thank you for this great recipe! I love it.  I have always been a fan of oil and vinegar salads, but with the cabbage, it is a special treat!
Changes I made to the recipe are, I upped the vinegar to 1/3 cup so that it wasn't so oily, and I also added the foil spice packets that come with the ramen noodles (I used two packages of the noodles)to the dressing.  I used red wine vinegar also.  I omitted the soy sauce and added water chesnuts.  This is a fantastic sweet/sour tasting salad!!
This recipe will be a regular in our house for a long time!

Toasting the cashews and ramen was a nice touch -- much more tasty and delicious when crunchy.  Although a good recipe and my husband liked it as well, I probably won't make it often because it seemed rather "heavy".  
Easy to make though and nice not to have to heat anything up.

I made this salad for a gathering of about 40 people and everyone raved.  It took about an hour to prepare the way I did it.  I thinly sliced 2 large heads of green cabbage.  I used 6 bunches of green onions.  I chopped a 15 oz. container of whole almonds (because I had them in the house) and toasted them in melted butter in a large stainless fry pan.  Put them in a large bowl then melted some more butter in the same pan and stirred in 5 packages of crushed ramen noodles with the chicken flavor packets sprinkled over them, and cooked until toasted.  Tossed the noodles and almonds together, and turned them out over the cabbage and green onions that I had put into a large roasting pan.  I tripled the dressing ingredients, using rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar, and superfine sugar.  I made the dressing first, before I started preparing everything else, so that the sugar would dissolve and the flavors blend.  Poured the dressing over everything and tossed it a bit and it was fabulous!

I had high hopes for this with all the great reviews and we followed the recipe exactly as is, so I was really disappointed with the final result.  The cider vinegar was overpowering, the dressing very oily..  We'll be looking for another recipe for next time!

Excellent (with modifications) - 5 STARS!

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner....NO leftovers!  I will definitely make again!  It's a keeper  :)
Modifications:  
Left out the cashews
2 ramen noodle packets instead of 1
Sauteed the noodles in a skillet with a little butter instead of using the oven
Added seasoning packet to dressing mixture, and simmered the dressing to emulsify it

Made this for Easter - people had 2nds and 3rds. Only change I made was to substitute sunflower seeds for the cashews.   I doubled the dressing but only used about 3/4ths of it.   Awesome!

LOVE IT!!!!! I wish I could put smiley faces all over this rating, so you could see how much we enjoyed this salad. I did make 2 changes, I used brown sugar instead of white, and I used chinese noodles instead of ramen noodles. I can see in my future I will be making this a lot.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Delicious. I toasted the ramen and cashews, added rotisserie chicken from Costco and used a regular head of Napa cabbage. I also heated the dressing on the stove for a minute and then chilled it.  This was a fantasic salad.

This was absolutely wonderful!  My daughter walked in and saw me preparing it and say "Yuk - what is that?"  I said "Just taste it".  She did and LOVED it.  My husband thought it was wonderful as well.  The only thing I will do different next time is decrease the oil. Other than that - NOTHING needs to be changed!!!

Excellent recipe!  I've had this before and lost my original recipe so I was happy to find this one.  The only things I changed was I used splenda instead of sugar, I used a prepackaged broccoli slaw mix, decreased the oil a bit and added a grilled chicken on top for a nice lunch salad.  I added almonds (as that is what I had) and the ramen noodles right before serving to retain crunch.  YUM!

The best ever!!!  I made as directed and my only addition was 2 tbs of mayo to the dressing, it made it a little creamier.  Other than that, it's perfect.  Thank you so much for the post.

AWESOME!!!! I normally do not like salads this much but on this one the dressing makes it, I even cut the sugar in half and it was still super sweet!  It definitely needs chicken (which I added) and I think next time I will add some chilled lo mien noodles and mandarin orange slices... then it would be PERFECT!  I will eat this salad often!  THANKS!! :)

One of my go to recipes for BBQs.  I use the flavor packet from the Ramen noodles in the dressing - usually Beef flavor.  Also, in lieu of nuts, I use a sprouted crispy mix which consists of lentils, peas, beans...very yummy!  The crispy mix holds up better than nuts in leftovers and I also serve the toasted noodles on the side as a topping.  Enjoy!

Delicious! I made this salad to go with some chicken breasts I marinated in soy,sugar,lemon juice and light olive oil and then grilled. Perfect combination on a hot summer day. The dressing is awesome! I used prepared angel hair slaw mix, toasted the ramen and nuts in a little butter and kept them on the side until time to serve. It was a big hit! Thanks for sharing~

This was okay. I made the recipe as is and it was too sour. I had high expectations for this recipe because of all the great reviews. If I make this recipe again, I will reduce the cider vinegar.

I wasn't expecting to like this recipe, but it really surprised me.  The only thing I plan on adjusting next time, is the amount of sugar.  I found it to be just a tad too sweet for my liking.

I am completely addicted to this salad. I've made it about 5 times now, with only a couple changes. The recipes doesn't tell you to include the soup mix flavor packet in the dressing, but I do. I think it adds a little something extra. (I've used both the chicken flavor and the Oriental flavor and both are yummy.) Cashews were out of my budget the first time I made it, so I using unsalted peanuts instead. I didn't toast them but they were great in the salad, so I've stuck with them. I've been making it to eat for my lunches over a period of several days. I put the cabbage mix, nuts and green onions together in a big container but have found that it works best to keep the dressing in a jar and add it to each portion as I serve it. Also, I keep the toasted noodles in a Ziploc bag in the cupboard and add them just before I eat. This way nothing gets soggy. Awesome salad! I've got noodles toasting in the oven for my next batch!

I made this at last year's 4th of July celebration at my fire station.  Everyone liked it so much, they (playfully) threatened dirty tricks against me if I didn't bring it again this year!  You will love this.

We LOVE this recipe!  I use sunflower seeds instead of cashews, either way is delish! So easy and what a nice, different salad to have.

Way to sweet for my taste but has potential. I cut back on sugar to half. I used sesami oil instead of regular oil too.

This salad was so yummy. I used less oil & almonds (didn't have cashews). I didn't add the seasoning pack that came with the noodles. I wasn't sure if I should or not the recipe doesn't really tell you what to do with it.Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this recipe a little healthier by increasing the apple cider vinegar to 1/2 c and decreased the oil to 1/4 c. I also decreased the sugar to 1/4 c. Even with the adjustments this salad was delicious.

This was really good.  A nice change instead of salad.  I had it at home with family and it was well received.  My husband was hesitant to try it since he doesn't usually like that type of dressing but he ended up enjoying this.  I took it to a potluck and it was all gone.  Thank  you!

This was a tasty variation on cabbage.  I didn't use the noodles or cashews to cut down on the fat, plus it was good without.  Also, cut oil in 1/2 to 1/4 c and was just fine.  Will definitely make again.

I made this with a bit less oil as others suggested, and added cilantro (but still rating 5 because I feel my changes did not alter the original taste enough to make the that big of a difference, I feel these are a matter of preference) and this was delicious! I added in some chicken to make it more filling. I just browned the chicken and then poured some of the dressing to caramelize in with it. Next time I think the only thing I'll change is using something other than Ramen, because the texture was not quite crunchy enough for my taste.. I think I will try the crunchy wonton strips you can buy at the store next time.

The dressing is wonderful, but I like it a little more acetic (vinegar).   Unlike some reviewers, I think the slaw mixture should be allowed to marinate with the dressing for about an hour then adding the crunchy ingredients right before serving.  The cabbage needs time to absorb some of the flavors.  I pan toasted the noodles, cashews and added some sesame seeds, used some sesame oil in the dressing.  The leftovers make a fantastic stir fry... just add an egg and some meat.

Great recipe! Didn't have cashews or cider vinegar and it was still great. Substituted olive oil since I'm doing Weight Watchers and put the noodles on top to save fat and calories.

I made this for a sidedish and found the recipe was great.  I didn't use shredded coleslaw mix as the recipe calls for, but instead finely chopped 1/2 head of a small cabbage and shredded carrots into it.  Results were delicious, but I think the shredded slaw mix would have made the vegetable-to-dressing ratio better.  Using the chopped cabbage method, and soaking most of the cabbage, I still had 1/2 of the dressing leftover.  Will make again.

I love this original recipe when I tried it but have altered it over time to address my desire to eat less processed stuff and more whole foods.  So I switched out the oil for a pureed avocado and the white sugar with an equal amount of honey.  I also always use either almonds or walnuts.  I occassionally add other shredded veggies like beets, parsnips or carrots, and occassionally a finely diced firm apple.  Braggs liquid aminos are an easy substitue for soy sauce but I tend to stick with the original.  Have served it at family gatherings with all different variations and it has always been a crowd pleaser.

I have made this 5 or 6 times and it is great. I go ahead and put dressing on hours in advance and it doesn't make it soggy, but gives it a nice marinated flavor! Everyone loves it every time I make it.

Very good! I also used a few dashes of sesame oil, rice wine vinegar, only 3/4 of the sugar and used the seasoning packets from the ramen in the dressing.  I also used sliced almonds that I toasted in a pan on the stovetop along with the ramen noodles.  Thank you for the recipe :)

I ate this for 2 weeks straight.  The only change I made was substituting toasted almonds for the cashews.  I like this because it does not use the ramen noodle seasoning packet which contains chicken flavoring because I'm vegetarian.

Had this for lunch today with these results:
Adults=4
Kids(5 & 2)=2
But I'm still giving it a 4 because it's such a filling lunch AND it was healthy & fast. Can't really beat that! Thanks!

I have been meaning top review this for a long time. It is a great summer salad! There are never any left overs! If I am taking it to a party  I keep the dressing separate until I am ready to serve. I do cut back the sugar a bit.

I use dry roasted peanuts instead of cashews, it's less expensive and tastes just as great. This is a great salad for the summer since there's no mayo. My suggestion, wait to pour the dressing on the salad until you serve it. Less is more, especially with the dressing! Happy cooking!

I make this all the time...it's always a hit and delicious!  Sometimes I'll substitute slivered almonds for the cashews and I'll add some diced chicken.  Mmmmmm!!

This salad was delicious! The flavours worked perfectly together. I made as written other than cutting the oil in half. Thanks for the recipe.

I used fresh chinese cabbage from my garden and broccoli stalks grated in my food processor.  The result was fresh and healthy!  Big hit.

Great, tasty dish and fast! I made a few changes by adding chicken and mandarin oranges, and substituting sunflower seeds for cashews, and olive and sesame oils for the vegetable oil. As a few reviewers suggested, I also added half the spice packet from my Oriental-style ramen noodles. This is a very adaptable recipe, and quite good.

My bf's favorite salad is a spinach salad, but I needed to find a different salad to make for him.  This is it!  Crunchy, slightly sweet, we ate on this several days in a row and he is still requesting it.  I will make this often.

Loved it! It is a staple for special occasions at our house, even though it is so easy to prepare. i substitute Chinese noodles for the ramen noodles to skip the  browning step.

Great recipe.  We like to add unsalted sunflower seeds to the mix also.  It just helps to add extra flavor!  One batch of this is NEVER enough!

Very good and easy to make. The dressing is great.  My kids were trying to figure out what was in the dressing, when I told them they did not believe me.  They said that was too simple to taste so good.

I was concerned this would turn out too sweet, but it came out perfect. I made the dressing beforehand, and then tossed the toasted ramen and cashews with it and the cabbage right before I served it. 8 people finished it off in a matter of minutes.

Made this for a family function.  Nothing was left in the bowl!  The other side dishes sat there totally envious of this dish!  Followed exactly with the only exception of a few drops of sesame oil.  Will make again.

This a wonderful change from a "traditional" coleslaw, which I don't like.  I cut down the oil and sugar to 1/3 of a cup.  I thought I had rice wine vinegar, but I had red wine vinegar which I used instead of cidar vinegar and it still turned out great.  I added a tablespoon of sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds.  I boiled the marinade for about a minute and let it rest and come to room temp before pouring it over the broccoli slaw mixture I got from the store.  My husband was pleasantly surprised and is looking forward to "us" taking it to our next family gathering.

Fantastic side dish! I will cut the oil in half next time and I also heated the dressing to dissolve the sugar. I also used almonds rather than cashews and it tasted fine.

I also added the seasoning package from the ramen nood noodles. The cashews are a nice additional crunch and flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! I cut the oil in half and subbed Splenda for the sugar, and it still tasted great! Like other reviewers, I'd advise letting the salad sit so that the dressing can soak into the cabbage. You can also use slivered almonds instead of cashews, if you prefer. Great!

Mmm....i just made this to go with meatloaf sandwiches last nite. It was really good. I let it soak for about 30 minutes before serving so the dressing would absorb into the cabbage

Wonderful recipe! I added a little fresh ginger to the dressing which was fantastic. I definitely recommend toasting the ramen in a tiny bit of butter first. It takes away the just out of the package flavor that the ramen noodles have.

very good recipe! I added the oriental season packet because we like flavor in my family. The dressing has to be blended in the magic bullet or something similar to it or else it doesn't mix well!!!!

OK I wasn't so sure about this recipe...it sounded alittle weird, but I was thinking it might go good with the Oriental Sparerib recipe I was using that I also got from Allrecipes. Well...everyone, and I mean even the fussy eaters loved it!! It went great with the ribs and my husband and were dissappointed that there wasn't any leftover for the next day.

There are too many reviews for me to read, so this is my 2 cents worth, even if I am repeating other reviewers.  I add a few shakes of sesame oil to the oil/vinegar (I use white vinegar), I use toasted/browned (in melted butter) almond slivers instead of the cashews, a couple of tablespoons of toasted sesame seeds, and just to change things up a bit, I also use salad shrimp, thawed, and toss it in a sealed baggie with the dressing.  The shrimp kind of marinades in the dressing.  When it is time to assemble, I grab my bag(s) of shredded cabbage, the mixed bag of crunchies, and the dressing; add all to a good size bowl/container and toss.  There should be a warning though: this salad is addictive!

I made this dressing the night before a potluck and focused more on the reviews than on the actual ingredients.  In the morning, this dressing was more of a syrup than a dressing.  I started over with the following recipe (just submitted) instead: 1/3 cups vegetable oil 1 tbsp vinegar 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp sugar Dry powder from soup mix Added to dressing cabbage and nuts (1/2 cup sliced almonds) just before serving.  Much better than the syrup would have been.

I also cut the oil to 1/4 cup. I used olive oil and instead of cider vinegar I used red wine vinegar. I toasted the ramen noodles with some sesame seeds and lightly sprayed them with olive oil spray and sprinkled a bit of the chicken spice pack over them. I added the rest of the spice packet to the dressing along with a couple dashes of dried minced garlic. I used almonds instead of cashews. My family loved it!

Very very good!  This salad was a hit with my husband and he doesn't like cabbage very much!  I reduced the sugar quite a bit though; I though 1/2 cup was way too much.  I used abour 2-3 Tbs. of sugar.  I also used dark soya sauce wich gave it a darker color.  I will make this again for sure!

Very nice change of pace for a salad.  The only changes I made was I used 1/4 cup sugar, then sweetened to taste with honey.  I used the Oriental flavor Ramen noodles and used the spice packet in the salad dressing.  I also added a can of mandarin oranges (with juice drained) to the salad.  VERY GOOD!

I REALLY liked this recipe.  I did wait to really "mix it up" until we were about to eat it, and I'm glad I did b/c it kept the ramen noodles and cashews crispy.  The leftovers were pretty good, but the noodles and cashews were soggy and I guess that could bother some people.  I have added this to my recipe collection, though, and I'll definitely be making it again.

Wonderful salad.  I brought this to a "girls night" with a Chinese cuisine theme and it was all eaten with compliments.  Very easy and tasty.  Make sure you add the dressing right before serving so it doesn't get soggy (as others have said).  Thanks for sharing!

This was fabulous.  I was a little worried that it would be boring because there are so few ingredients, but it was delicious.  I did make one change:  I added 1 Tbls of sesame oil to the dressing and I let the dressing sit in the refrigerator for 1 hour to meld the flavors together and dissolve the sugar.  I made this with Hot and Sour Chicken Soup from this site and it was a great, light meal.  Thanks for the recipe, I will make this again and again!

Delicious! i've made this recipe 1/2 dozen times and it's always a huge hit. You can even have the leftovers a day or two later if you toast the cashews and ramen noodles long enough.

It was great, as per the other reviews, I added carrots, red pepper, and chicken. I also added in manderin oranges.  The only thing was there wasn't enough dressing so I had to double that part of the recipe.  I will be making this again for sure.

This was really good and super easy.  I have made other Chinese-style salads, but this one is the best I've tried.  And last better too - the cabbage doesn't go soggy like lettuce does.

Very different recipe. Quick and easy to make with the ready made coleslaw mixes available, nowadays. For such little effort, you get a great, exotic side dish.

I used toasted slice almonds instead of the cashews and added a dash of sesame oil and the packet of ramen seasonings to the dressing.  Definitely wait until the last minute to add the dressing to the salad; it gets pretty soggy if you add it too soon.

I prepared this recipe for our office Christmas party and it was the biggest success of the party.  There were multiple requests for the recipe. I added the seasoning packet from the ramen noodles, it was delicious. This will definately be a family favorite.

This was really good. I added 1T. Sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds to the dressing.  I also used a bunch of cilantro in the salad and no nuts because I didn't have any. I used leftover baked chicken breasts sliced thin and it was great in this. Next time I won't use nearly as much sugar- maybe start with 2T only.

I totally screwed up this recipe and it still came out delicious! Forgot to oven brown the noodles and nuts. I only had slivered almonds on hand. Used rice vinegar, and used light olive oil. Made a half recipe using 1/4 of a large cabbage thinly sliced and chopped. Wonderful summer salad and it went well with Egg Foo Yung II and Kalua Pig in a Slow Cooker on this site! Always love quick and easy...thanks for sharing! 1/27/15 update: I forgot to use the rice vinegar and used regular cider vinegar...not nearly as good! It lacked the zip it had with the rice vinegar.

This salad is delicious!  I took the advice of other reviews and sprinkled part of the chicken seasoning packet over the noodles and cashews before roasting them.  I also added 1 Tablespoon of sesame oil to the vegetable oil.  I used a fresh cabbage, 1/2 of a large one, shredded fine.  I brought it to a potluck and people asked for the recipe!

I've tried a lot of Japanese ramen salads and pretty much like them all. It's my favourite salad. Up until know I thought the recipe I was using was good but WOW this one is out of this world delicious. I substituted almonds for the cashews because that is what I had on hand. I browned them in a pan on the stovetop. Oven was full. I followed the ingredients as written the only thing i did differently was I added 1 tbsp sesame oil the first time I made it and this time I didn't change a thing other than add the seasoning from the ramen noodles. I actually think it tasted better as written so that is how I will rate it not on my changes. I did however only use 1/2 of the dressing for the package of coleslaw I had. The package was a 397 gram (14 oz) and for our taste it was plenty juicy. Thanks for this recipe which keeps this my favourite salad.

This was super yummy. It is very sweet, but I think that is a good thing. The noodles and cashews go super well with the dressing. I would definitely make this again.

Easiest one yet. Instead of heating the oven, I toasted the noodles and cashews in butter. My kids who hate cabbage smelled it, tried it, didn't care that it was cabbage, and loved it.

This is very good.  I followed one reviewer's suggestion to pan toast the cashews and noodles after spraying with some Pam and sprinkling on the seasoning packet.  This is very good advice.  I also substituted rice vinegar for the cider.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  I have to agree with others that there is too much oil.  It leaves an oily feeling on the lips which is not pleasant.  As we tend to like sour, next time I will add a bit more vinegar as well as cutting the oil. Adding in a sprinkling of sesame seeds would probably be a nice addition as well.  I think I would suggest adding the dressing to the cole slaw about 1/2 hour before serving to allow it to take in some of the flavors and adding the crunchy elements right before serving.  I think with those tweaks this will be a repeat recipe for us!

Great recipe but do not make it the night before. It is much better if the dressing is put on right before serving! Also, splenda can be a great substitute for the sugar. And a little sesame oil is good too.

Yum! I chopped up my own cabbage and carrots and added a little broccoli, too. Didn't have any cashews on hand but I'm sure it'd be delicious with those, too. I did toast some sesame seeds with the ramen. Great recipe!

I made this with two minor changes:  I used slivered almonds instead of cashews (I toasted them) and I added the ramen soup chicken flavor pack to the dressing.  I don't really think the chicken flavoring made much of a difference so next  time I'll try without.  This was GREAT and super fast and easy to make... we will without a doubt make it again and again.

I enjoyed the dressing but it has way too much sugar and oil. Not sure I would make it again because of it. Not healthy I bet.

Very good!  I followed the recipe except I also added slivered almonds that I had browned in butter on the stove and I added the flavor packet (oriental) from the ramen noodles.  Everyone loved it!!!

I loved this recipe.  I subbed peanuts because I had them on hand and used Splenda instead of white sugar just to keep down the calories.  I am not a big Splenda eater so it took a couple of bites to get used to the "artificial" taste, but it was excellent anyway.  I bet it is even better with the real thing.

This was a hit with the crowd to accompany Chop Suey.  I used the alternate dressing suggested by another reviewer which replaced sugar with Spenda (4T), 1/2 c oil, 1/2 c vinegar, 2 T soy, 2 T Sesame seeds.  I shredded one small head of cabbage.

Good and simple recipe-- and easy to change up w/ different ingredients as you have on hand.  The dressing was a bit on the sweet side to me- so i'd probably cut down a little bit on the sugar next time.  Also, adding fried won ton strips added to the crunch. I would definitely make it again!

I expected a lot from this salad based on all the rave reviews. It was good, but it did not blow me away. It was, however, very easy to put together (I used a prepacked salad from the store).

This was fantastic.  My family and friends could not stop talking about it or eating it.  I did toast the ramen and cashews in a light coating of butter.  Wow, what flavor.

Good....I hate to say it...but may actually totally omit the ramen noodles next time (hubby didnt care for that part of the slaw)...I added sliced almonds instead of the cashews, a bunch of small broccoli floretts...reduced the oil to 5 tablspns of evoo, reduced the sugar by half and added a splash of sesame oil to the dressing as well. I also doubled the slaw to 2 pks. and did not double the dressing as it was plenty for 2 pks of slaw.  The dressing was excellent, slaw was good, almonds were toasted and crunchy....noodles were not a hit. I also agree with another reviewer and that assembly is key so as not to "sog" out this slaw. Nice Asian flavors, will make again, just w/o the noodles.  Thanks!

My guests beg for this salad. I have learned that when you dress it is key. Too early and it swims. Too late and it doesn't have time to blend. About 30 minutes prior to eating seems about ideal.   I also keep each item stored seperately for use as a dinner side (dressing, toasted items, and slaw). This way it lasts longer as the dressed version gets soggy.

I used almonds instead and it was wonderful.  If you are not going to be able to eat the entire salad in one day, put the dressing on the side...it gets really mushy.

Great salad, I made it for a birthday party and everyone loved it!  I halved the sugar, it could probably even use less.  I substituted walnuts and rice vinegar because that's what I had on hand.  Next time I think I will try it with some sesame oil, as another reviewer suggested!

We really like this dish.  I use whatever I have on hand.  I've made without green onions before, and added a bit of onion powder and it still tastes great.  I like to add shredded chicken and mandarin oranges.  Definitely a keeper!

Everyone wanted the recipe.  I added a small bag of julienned broccoli, carrots -sold right next to the bagged salad/coleslaw for color.  It was great, nothing really needed to be added I just happened to be in the mood!  Make this!

I thought this was a great recipe. I did cut way back on the sugar. Although I  prefer my version; I used cooked Vermicelli Noodles, and I heated everything together in 1 pan, including the sauce and coleslaw. It was similar to a Veitnamese Noodle dish. We loved it.

Everyone loved this. I had to triple the recipe and cashews are super expensive so I substituted half the cashews for sunflower seeds. I also added sesame seeds for the heck of it. It was so good that even if cashews became free tomorrow I wouldn't do it any other way.

This is definitely a keeper!  I was looking for something I could bring to a pot-luck on short notice with not much time to cook, and this was perfect!  It was quick, easy and delicious.  I didn't know what to do with the seasoning packet that came with the noodles, so I threw it away.  I think next time, I'll follow the reviewer's idea of sprinkling it on the cashews and noodles as they toast.  Anyway, thanks for this recipe!

Well received at a gathering of couples.  I reduced the vegetable oil amount to 1/3 cup as others suggested and I can not imagine it with more.  It was perfect.  Give it a try - you won't be disappointed!

We served this at our daughter's wedding and got many requests for the recipe. It is inexpensive and can be made up ahead of time - just add the noodles at the last minute. We used sunflower seeds in place of the cashews to cut costs.
We also served family-style Chinese food and had decorative chopsticks as the favors.

I loved this!!! I'm allergic to cashews so I used sliced almonds. I did listen to others and only put 1 TBLSP. sugar (plenty sweet for me, I prefer less) and added the seasoning packet from the ramen!  So good :)

Wonderful!  I cut the oil down to only a few tablespoons and didn't notice any difference.  I also used 2 tablespoons of Splenda instead of the sugar.  I added sunflower seeds and chopped up peanuts, and 3 small cans of cooked white chicken, and it makes a great meal!  I've been eating this for lunch all week long!

Absolutely delicious.  I didn't rate 5 stars because I didn't follow the exact recipe.  Altered the amounts of sugar and oil as stated by other reviews and add some chopped up grilled chicken.  Also used almond slivers toasted with the ramen noodles sprinkled with ramen seasoning.  Thank you!

I made this for a church potluck and it was gone really fast...almost too fast for my husband to get some!  I added fresh mushrooms and sunflower seeds and used wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar.  I will have to try the cider vinegar next time.

This recipe is fabulous!  I did cut the sugar and oil down to 1/3 cup and I will probably use less cashews next time.  It was so easy that I know I will make this again and again!  I made it the night before to bring with me for lunch the following day - so I mixed the coleslaw mix, onions, and dressing together, and put the cashew/ramen mix in a baggie to add at the last minute so it would stay crunchy.  Perfect!

How on earth could something so easy be this tasty?!?!  This is really good.  I've made this a few times within a week and I've also made it with juice from a fresh squeezed orange and real orange segments mixed in.  Delicious.  Very nice and light.

This was great! I used 2 packages of noodles, and only about 6 oz of cashews (all I had).  Didn't change anything else. I took it to a Christmas party and there was none left over!  I waited until we were ready to eat before I poured the dressing on, and then tossed to coat.  I can't wait to make this again.

This is a great recipe for pot lucks or to bring along to parties. Everytime I bring it I am asked for the recipe and am complemented on the authentic Asian flavor.

I use Mann's Broccoli Coleslaw bag, olive oil and red wine vinegar instead, and don't use the cashews. I made it once with toasted almonds but usually just leave them out. I once made this dish with regular vegetable oil because I was out of olive oil and my coworkers tasted the difference--it was way too oily tasting.

Good recipe to fall back on!

This is excellent. Sometimes I keep recipe as is, and other times I add some sunflower seeds + packet of ramen seasoning to oil mixture.  Both ways are great, and if I could give this 100 stars I would. LOVE IT!

This receipe is SO good. My mom made it for years for family parties and I would refuse to eat it because it had cabbage in it. Finally, one day I ate it and I LOVE it! Who would have known! This is the biggest hit at all of our parties :) One thing I would say is never to add the sauce until ready to serve, it makes the noodles soggy.

Rave reviews for this recipe from all those at our family 4th of July bbq.  I doubled the recipe, mixed the coleslaw mix, onions & toasted ramen noodles (left out the cashews because of a nut allergy) and put it in a large tupperware container, mixed all the dressing ingredients and put that into a smaller tupperware container. Mixed it all up when we got to the bbq.  Will def make this again

Excellent recipe. I added 1/2 teaspoon of toasted sesame oil to the dressing. I also let the dressing sit a few hours to allow the flavors to develop.

This is excellent!! The only thing I did differently is use half veg oil and half sesame oil and cut back on the sugar. No need to change anything else. This is a great light salad for a hot summer day (or anytime, really). So easy too!

An excellent, quick and easy salad that is a sure crowd pleaser! I made this over Memorial Day weekend and took it to my parent's BBQ.  A few slight changes:  I made the dressing the night before.  I added 1 TBSP of sesame oil to the dressing and used 3/4 cup sugar. Making the dressing overnight allowed the flavors to mingle.  I recommend taking the dressing out of the fridge 15 minutes prior to putting on the salad. I also toasted the cashews and noodles the night before.  I assembled everything right before serving.  Excellent sweet-n-salty combination!

I did add about a half Tbsp. of Sesame Oil, and next time will double the amount of Ramen AND Dressing. It disappeared too quickly! Might be good with chicken in it, too... especially if one is serving to guests. The toasted Sesame Seeds and extra garnish of chopped scallions are a great idea. Thank you all for the helpful reviews, and thank you Marilyn, for submitting such a tasty recipe!

This salad was delicious. I served it twice to guests and everyone liked it. The only changes I made is I decreased the amount of green onions and added a drop of sesame oil.

Delicious salad!  I added a small bunch cilantro, seeded and diced cucumber, and diced radishes for extra crunch.  I added a teaspoon of sesame oil to the dressing.  Instead of coleslaw I chopped up a head of cabbage.  I served the salad with rotisserie chicken on top. I also doubled the ramen and cashews because that’s my favorite part!  Yum. Thanks for the recipe!!

Made this with way less sugar!... I used only 2 tbls of sugar to be exact. Probably could have gotten away with just one tbls.  Added a tsp of sesame oil. About a 1/4-1/2 cup of chopped cilantro, subed cider vinegar for seasoned rice vinegar, added a tsp of fresh grated ginger, and two med shredded carrots. Was great, the whole family loved it! We topped it with sliced and grilled pork chops marinated with Asian ingredients.

I've been making  a slightly different  version of this salad for years and decided to adopt some of the differences this recipe calls for.  I toasted the ramen noodles, which I hadn't done before, a definite improvement,,along with chopped almonds instead of the cashews and also added sesame seeds which we all like. I cut back on the sugar to 3 Tablespoons which is plenty. I added about a tablespoon of sesame oil for part of the oil and added
Lower sodium soy sauce which my original recipe didn't call for.  I brought the new and improved version to a family gathering and it was well liked by all. I like changing things up and will make this new version the next time I'm hungry for  Chinese cabbage salad.

Great for a potluck.  I added small bits of cooked chicken, brocolli along with all the other ingredients, and used sesame seed oil in lieu of vegetable oil.  Yummy!

I only needed half the dressing. It would have been too much if I had put it all in. We used almonds and it was pretty good if you like almonds (obviously). I was quite surprised how much I liked it. I found myself taking bites as I was putting away the leftovers. That doesn't happen often. I used half coleslaw, half red cabbage and that worked well and made it colorful.

I thought this was okay, but nothing that blew me away.  I made as directed, but seemed like a lot of cashews.  I toasted the cashews and ramen noodles in the toaster oven, then mixed them with the shredded cabbage/chopped green onion mix.  I kept dressing on the side, then poured over each serving.   The dressing seemed greasy to me....too much oil, not enough flavor...it was just missing something?   Maybe with a different dressing this would be better...it was "mehhh" as written.

Great salad. I used Chinese cabbage and added some regular mixed cabbage. I used Splenda and added it to taste - about 4 tablespoons. I will make it again and try sesame seeds and sesame oil. I did goof by buying walnuts instead. It was still great!

The way I later made it, rates a 5.  The recipe as is, a 3 1/2.  I substituted as follows:  vinegar - rice vinegar; oil - 1/2 vegetable and 1/2 sesame seed; sugar, about a teaspoon or to taste.  Add drained water chestnuts and fresh bean sprouts.  I omitted the cashews.

I have made this recipe a few times, and always receive great reviews.  I shred cabbage from the garden.  I usually toast the ramen noodles and the cashews in the oven.  I also reduce the oil and sugar, but that is a persocnal preference.  Thanks for the recipe!

GREAT REFRESHING SALAD. MY HUSBAND EVEN LOVED IT AND HE DOES NOT EAT SALADS. BUT I DID SUBSTITUTE THE OIL AND VINEGAR WITH PEANUT AND SESAME OIL AND RICE VINEGAR. ALSO ADDED SESAME SEEDS AND CILANTRO.

I loved this recipe as is.  But the next time I made it I mixed it up a little bit.  Used rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar, sweet onion instead of green onions, added 1-2 tsp. of sesame oil, and a few dashes of dried cilantro.

I followed this exactly and thought it was good, but lacked flavor. I added an extra tbsp of soy sauce, cilantro and salt and pepper. It was a great recipe and easy to make! Thank you for sharing.

Too much sugar and oil.  Next time I'd use Mirin and cut sugar in half and oil in half and replace with 2-4 Tbsp. greek yogurt, lite mayonnaise.

Delicious!!! I used a sugar substitute & cut down on the oil to 1/4th cup. I used safflower oil & a Planter's Appalachian mix of nuts, seeds, etc... I mixed the ramen noodle seasoning in with the dressing. Delicious!!!!

Delicious! and simpler than another similar slaw recipe I have. The only thing I did differently is use sesame seeds since I had no cashews and toasted them and the ramen noodles in a frying pan on the stove instead of the oven. Thought I could control the toasting this way. I also added a T of sesame oil since I love the flavor it imparts in dishes. Thank you!

Delicious! I love the crunchiness of the ramen noodles and the nuts. It is sweet and maybe not very healthy but it can be tweaked if that's a concern.

This was a delicious, light tasting salad.  I agree with other reviewers that it was a tad sweet, so I'll use less sugar next time.  I also found the tip helpful to make the dressing ahead and let it sit for a few minutes before adding to the salad.  I added finely chopped cucumbers and carrots for more variety, and I omitted the cashews, as I didn't have any.  I added toasted sesame seeds instead.  We'll be making this again soon.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious!  Crunchy, sweet, yummy!  Made exactly as is but next time will reduce the dressing.  Was outstanding for first few bites and then the sweetness got to me and I think reducing the dressing would fix that.  VERY good though!

I made the recipe for a quick, light dinner on a warm summer day and I have made it almost every week since.  My husband and I love it.
I make a little extra dressing and bake it with chicken, which I then cut into cubes for a more complete meal for my husband.

Delicious! I used almonds instead of cashews (I didn't have them) and I added about a teaspoon of sesame oil. I also didn't have time to toast the noodles, but it was still great.

This salad is pretty good, kids didn't like it but adults did.  I browned the noodles in a skillet, so I didn't have to turn on the oven, and added almonds instead of cashews (didn't have any).

This salad was a big suprise-who would've thought that ramen noodles could taste so good! The only drawback is that the noodles get soft as the day goes on, so it's better eaten fresh. The dressing is what makes this recipe a success. No adjustments needed at all.

Loved this recipe!  So easy and so yummy.  Everyone at my open house thought it was great.  My husband asked me to make it again the very next day.

This was good with a couple changes. I used 3 packages of ramen noodles instead of just one and instead of the soy sauce i used the seasoning from the noodle packages.  I also didn't toast the noodles or nuts beforehand since I didn't have room in the oven. But it turned out great!

I made this yesterday for a potluck with a group of friends.  Hands down, it was the best thing there!  My friends raved about it and gave me "salad" duty for this next week too!  I did make twice the dressing that the recipe calls for since it just didn't seem enough for such a big salad and I added pineapple chunks as well.

This salad was really tasty! Don't let the simple ingredients fool you. I have a different opinion than other raters, for whatever it's worth. I thought the salad was tastier after sitting overnight. I did top it with fresh cashews the next day so it wasn't soggy, but I felt the flavors had a chance to blend overnight and it was really much yummier on day 2. I cut the sugar to 1T, cut the oil to 2T of sesame oil and 2T of olive oil. I also added a can of well drained mandarin oranges. An excellent salad that I will make again!

So good.  Did make changes according to others including doubling the cabbage and ramen noodles adding sesame seed oil and peanut butter.  I only had roasted peanuts at home which I used.  That's what was such a rave at the Easter luncheon.  Very easy.  Thanks for such a hit!!

Very good. I chopped up some cabbage instead of buying pre-made coleslaw mix. For the dressing, i used less of the oil and also added the seasoning packet. I roasted almonds instead of cashews.
Very easy to make and SUPER delicious!

My family and I love this recipe.  I like to add some sliced or cubed cooked chicken breast at the last minute so it becomes a complete satisfying meal.  I usually fry about 2 chicken breast on the stove top in a pan with pam and a little bit of soy sauce and garlic powder then slice it when it is done and put on the salad.  This feed the 4 of us comfortably.  I also like the fact that it is so easy to throw together.  On a busy night when I had to work over or whatever and I don't have much time to get dinner on the table I have made this even quicker by buying the pre-cooked chicken breast at the local grocery store.  I just put the chicken slices on a plate as the directions say and heat it up in the microwave.  I then top the salad as the last minute with the meat.  Delicious!!!!!!

Very good and extremely easy to make! I added a little more soy sauce then called for in the dressing and used broccoli slaw mix. It turned out great. Will make again, and maybe add sunflower seeds next time.

This is very good.  I also cut back on the oil and sugar to 1/4 cup.  I microwaved the dressing for a minute to make sure the sugar was absorbed and then chilled in fridge until time to serve.  Assemble right before serving!

very tasty recipe and extremely easy to make, which is the best part.  i used 1/3 cup oil, sunflower seeds and slivered almonds (since they needed used up).  if you use the smaller nuts, dont add the full 10 oz. or it'll be too much.  and like other reviewers have mentioned, dont add the dressing until right before serving.  this salad doesnt keep, which is too bad.  its good for one meal and that's about it.  
thanks!

This was excellent!  I used sliced almonds (just a preference), and napa cabbage in place of the pre-shredded coleslaw mix. Also threw in some shredded carrots. It was loved by all!

Very good! I added toasted sesame seeds and did put the seasoning packet contents in the dressing, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Dh and I think the toasted cashew "make" this. Delicious!

This was pretty good, a nice compliment to my curry chicken and peanuts.  Maybe just a little on the sweet side, I would cut down on the sugar and add a little pepper for some zip.  My 6 yo daughter who normally loves salad would not touch it though.  I will probably make again, but maybe tweek it a  little.

This recipe was excellent!!!!!! I think it was the dressing that got me hooked!! I made this salad 2 nites in a row!! My 3 yr old loved it too!

I recently switched back to the South Beach diet and Ive been making the dressing with Splenda. Its just as good but I use less than I would've used if it was real sugar. I also cut out the ramen noodles but the dressing is so good it's really not needed.
