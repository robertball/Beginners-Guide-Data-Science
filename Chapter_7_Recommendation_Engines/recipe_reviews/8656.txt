This is a great meal when slightly altered, even my picky hubby liked it.  I boiled the chicken to cook it, and added 2 boulion cubes.  I used that as my chicken stock.  I also boiled the asparagus for a few minutes in the stock, before adding it to  the mix.  I sauted the celery with the onion and added 2 cloves of garlic.  I also added salt, pepper and basil along with the oregeno.  My biggest diversion from the recipe was the addition of cream of mushroom.  When I added the sour cream, it became very grainy and watery, so the cream of mushroom definitely helped.  I think any cream of would do.  I mixed everything together, and didn't layer it as described.  finally, I topped it with a fancy shredded parm and romano.

I thought this was a great recipe except I made a few changes to what I had on hand and what we prefer.
I omitted the peppers and celery since I didn't have any and replaced with chopped onion, sundried tomatoes and mushroom. sauteed all veggies in olive oil (including the asparagus) and fresh chopped garlic, red pepper flakes before adding to sr.cream mixture. substituted 1/4 cooking wine & 3/4 cup broth. added can of cream of chicken soup with sour cream to give more sauce, I didn't think the sour cream would be enough and would dry up while cooking. I also substituted 1/2 cup basil (or cilantro) for oregano because those spices are our favorites and oregano is pretty bland. I also added some monterey jack and some crushed french fried onions to the top after putting it all together in the pan, I used a 9x13 casserole dish.  This was one of the best dishes I've ever made and will certainly make it many times in the future. My husband also loved it.

Everyone loved this dish.  It does take quite a bit time to prep the dish but well worth it.  I made it a little easier by just mixing the sauce with the noodles and pouring it into the casserole dish.  I then just cut up the asparagus and stuck the pieces into the casserole.  This is a yummy casserole!!!  I used fat reduced sourcream and wholegrain egg noodles.

I almost feel guilty reviewing this recipe because I changed it up so much! But the basics were there - chicken, asparagus, sour cream, parmesan and noodles. What I changed was in response to the reviews as to it being runny. Instead of using chicken stock, I used a can of cream of mushroom soup. I also sauteed the asparagus along with the onions and added garlic and mushrooms, omitted the red pepper (yuck!). Then instead of putting it in a casserole, I dumped it all in a crock pot and cooked it on low for 5-6 hours. Turned out great - flavor wasn't bland at all and it was saucy instead of soupy. I'd make it again.

Very Good... I used 1 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayonaise instead and thickened the sauce with flour & milk before assembling. I increased the noodles to 12 oz and assembled it in this order noodles, chicken, asparagus, noodles and topped it off with the remaining chicken and cheese.. It was well liked... Thanks for a great find..

This was a great recipe I will use again.  Can't wait to try it on hubby.  The only change I made was I simmered the asparagus with the chicken stock and saute' onions and celery together and added 2 cloves of garlic to the onions and celery this brought up the flavour quite a bit.  This is a keeper

Great recipe...by following other reviewer's suggestions and changing/adding a few other things on my own, this is a keeper! For starters, I used at least 10 oz's medium-width egg noodles, 2+ cups chicken, and only 1 cup sour cream. Next time, I'll try 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup cream of mushroom soup to cut down on the fat a little. Along with the onion, I sauteed a small (1/2lb?) box of white mushrooms. I didn't have straight oregano, so I substituted 1 tsp Italian herb mix, along with white pepper, red pepper flakes and seasoned salt to taste.  Along with the simmering chicken mixture, I added 1/2 cup canned corn and 1TBSP flour to thicken. Thanx to a great reviewer's tip to speed the recipe up a bit, I did mix noodles, chicken mixture and asparagus all together before adding to the casserole dish;I only added 1/2 lb or so of asparagus because I wasn't sure if my husband and I liked a whole 1lb.! I topped it all off with a Parmesan/Monterey Jack cheese combo and breadcrumbs. It barely fit in a 2 quart casserole dish but aluminum foil lightly folded around the top and edges helped! After cooking it for 30 minutes, the asparagus was still quite crisp, which some people love, but I left it in for 5-10 more minutes...really tasty. Thank you!

this dish created soooo much water!!! I used all fresh veggies so i should've known better.  the sour cream got all clumpy and gross.  i dont know if i will make it again- at least change some of the ingredients first.

Very dee-licious! I added yellow pepper also and used fresh asagio along with
the fresh parmesan. I doubled the cheese amount.  Some sweet basil and garlic
powder were also added. Instead of layering in dish I just mixed it all together.
Lots of flavor and texture. Will make often! Thanx kathy!

Delicious casserole.  The sour cream gave it a nice bit of zing, that most cream sauces just don't have.  In the future, I'll probably add a bit more spice.  Great way to add asparagus to a meal.

I changed this recipe a lot, but it's a great base recipe.  I didn't want a lot of fat, so I only used 1 tsp of olive oil and fat free sour cream.  I was a little concerned with the recipe being soupy, so I mixed 2 tbl of flour with the sour cream before adding and it worked great.  I added garlic, shallots, fresh mushrooms, italian seasoning, season salt, and extra marjoram.  Once I cooked the veggies and chicken, I added the broth, sour cream and spices, then I let it simmer for a little while to thicken a bit.  I mixed the cheese in the sauce.  Once it started to thicken, I combined with Whole Wheat Rotini in a casserole dish.  It turned out great.  Next time I'll triple the chicken (there just wasn't enough) and cut the sour cream in half (a little too mcuh).  Great recipe!

Great stuff!!  I added a little Monterey Jack on top along with the parmesan, but everything else was to the letter on the recipe and it came out really good...  maybe just a little salt..

Thanks!!

i had to make this with green beens instead of asparagus...out of season...but it was still fantastic.  I used the called for amount of chicken stock for simmering, but before adding the sauce to the dish, I pored some of the liquid out.  I feel that made it not saucy enough though.  I think next time I'll leave the stock the way it calls and see what happens.  I also added the noodles to the veggie and sauce mixture, mixed it all up and then pored half in the casserole dish, placed the uncooked, fresh green beans on the mixture and then added the remaining noodle/veggie/sauce mixture.  I topped with the called for parmesan and added 1/2 cup of shredded asiago cheese...it was great.  Next time I think I will added half the parmesan to the mixture & top with the remaining and the asiago.

We loved the taste of this dish.  However, it was necessary to use a 2 quart casserole instead of a 1 1/2. Also I cut down on the noodles.

Very disappointing .... due to blandness even after adding garlic. I used par-boiled broccoli (asparagus is too expensive in winter) but the result would be the same using the called-for asparagus.  We will eat the leftovers but putting horseradish/sour cream on top.  I will not be making this again.

Yummy summertime casserole!  I used greek plain yogurt in place of sourcream because thats what I had on hand.  I only had 5 ounces of it so I guestimated the difference by adding milk and flour.  The sauce was watery and I should have tweaked it more before putting it all together in the oven. I didn't have celery either so added some green bell peppers.  I also added garlic, red pepper flakes, lemon pepper, cumin. My husband and I enjoyed this casserole and he had seconds which is saying something. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

This was okay, nothing that really stood out.  I used a LOT of spices during the prep of this dish, and it was still a little bland.  I also used cream of celery soup/sour cream mix with just a splash or two of chicken broth as my sauce...I imagine using a whole cup of stock might make it too runny.  I don't think I'd make it again, only because it wasn't anything that the family really enjoyed.  Thanks anyway!

I agree with a few other folks--it was kind of watery.  I'll try again and omit the chicken stock.  I used low fat sour cream and added some garlic and few red pepper flakes.  This is definitely a keeper with some modifications.  I plan to try the recipe with broccalli next time.

I made this recipe the other night.  I had never cooked asparagus before.  I was wondering about not cooking the asparagus first.  It came out fine.  I did as others suggested and added some garlic powder, and grated Parmesan cheese.  I was surprised how good it was.  It is even better leftover.

I found this recipe to be easy and
 delicious.  My husband loved it.  I
 followed the recipe exactly and it turned
 out perfect. I noticed in the first review 
that the asparagus was not completely cooked
but mine was perfect.  I did use very young,
 tender, slim spears.  The red pepper gave
a particularly good flavor...Don't leave it out.
 
especially good

I really enjoyed this dish, I used more than 8oz of noodles though, probably about 10, and I added a can of cream of mushroom and didn't use the whole amount of sour cream.  I loved it and will be making it again soon!

UGH! I really wanted this recipe to come out amazing but that didn't happen.. at all.  This was bland, boring and overall a complete bust. It was quite beautiful but will definitely NOT be making this again as written. The entire recipe needs to be updated to include seasoning or something.

This was really delicious! I used carrots instead of the red peppers and for liquid used a can of cream of chicken soup, a half cup of milk and about a half cup of sour cream. I cooked it for about 40 minutes and it turned out great. Even the cat liked it :)

This was really good!  I did take the suggestions from others and cut down on the chicken stock and add a can of cream of chicken soup.  I also threw in the asparagus with all of the other veggies to cook. Delicious!

Very easy and tasty recipe.  I didn't bother with layers, just threw the whole mess into a casserole.  My only complaint was that the sauce was runny.  A tablespoon of cornstarch fixed that problem though.

I left out the oil (used Pam), added tons of seasonings (garlic powder, paprika, basil, and chopped garlic), left out the oregeno, subbed cr of chicken for chicken broth and used less sour cream, subbed lowfat mont jack for parm. My daughter and husband loved this dinner served w/ spinach salad.

As others, I agree this recipe needed a boost.  I cooked it according the directions and it was runny and bland, but the basic ingredients are great.  I used broccoli that I partially cooked instead of asparagus.  I would cut the sour cream at least in half next time.  I heated up a can of cream of celery soup with about a half can milk, melted a cup of shredded cheddar, a tblps plus of horseradish, poured over the casserole, mixed together and added Italian bread crumbs on top.

I used cream of mushroom soup and a little milk instead of the chicken broth as others said it was runny. I cooked the asparagus for about 10-15 mins before I put it in the casserole and it was still a little hard. Next time I think I would use another veggie like broccoli. The flavor was ok but it felt like something was missing, not sure what yet.

A very tasty recipe. The ingredients overwhelm the one and one half quart casserole. The asparagus didn't quite cook. A bit too juicy. 4oz. egg noodles, 3/4 cup stock, 1/2 lb asparagus (blanched)--my thoughts for the next time. My husband loved it!

Really happy I came across this recipe!  If the original recipe called for more spice I would have given it a 5; however, I added basil, red pepper flakes, italian seasoning, fresh garlic and some salt and pepper (didn't use exact measurements...went by eye and taste).  I only used 1 cup of low fat sour cream and a can of cream of mushroom soup, and used about 12oz of whole wheat egg noodles.  I love the zing the sour cream gives to the dish and I will definitely be making this again.

I was a little nervous about some of the reviewers commenting that the recipe was bland, but I had all the ingredients on hand to make this.  I made the following changes and the results were not too bad.

I used a can of healthy requests cream of chicken soup instead of the 1 1/2 cups sour cream.

I added about 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese to the chicken mixture.

I added only a dollop of sour cream to the chicken mixture

After making this, I thought that maybe adding a little Mrs Dash would give the recipe a nice flavor too, but we were already eating....

Its not too bad for a weeknight meal- certainly easy to make.  We were in a time crunch, so I just simmered the chicken mixture and asparagus together until all veggies were tender and then mixed all with the noodles and served.

Not sure if it's far of me to rate this recipe as I did things COMPLETELY different...but it was the basis of it, so I might as well. 
I cooked two boneless/skinless cubed chicken breast in my dutch oven first while I boiled the egg noodles. Once the chicken was no longer pink, I added a cut up green pepper, 1/2 a white onion, two celery stalks cut up, two minced garlic cloves and all the asparagus along with maybe a cup+ of chicken stock. I let that simmer for maybe 5 mins, then added the sour cream and oregano as well as some basil and a can of cream of mushroom. I let that cook for another 5 mins then I mixed the egg noodles in with the whole lot and put it into a 9x13 baking dish. I shredded fresh parm on top (no clue how much, I like cheese so probably a lot!) and baked for just under a half hour. It was pretty good - I think it does need another spice and maybe have parm mixed into the whole thing rather then just on top. I'll make it again and try other things.

Seriously D'lish especially with what you have in your fridge which is what I had to do. I used Chicken Breast Tenders that I sauteed in Garlic, Onion and EVOO. I then Simmered the Asparagus, Celery and Carrot together with chicken stock and a lil more EVOO, and a splash of balsamic vinaigrette. I cooked up the egg noodles and when they were done I only had less than a 1/2cp nonfat sour cream so I improvised and added 2 tbs of Mayo with olive oil to the sour cream. I mixed the veggie/chicken mixture in with the egg noodles, added a dash of celery salt and placed in my pampered chef's baking dish and sprinkled lowfat colby/jack cheese about 1/2 cp, and a scattering of parm on top. I then topped it with Paprika for lil spice and color. I baked at 350 for 25 min and let it set out for 5 min before serving. Served with a salad of romaine and green lettuce and chunks of tomatoes with Balsamic Vinaigrette. This was very filling, and my five yr old loved it.

This is a pretty good recipe, except it's missing something that would make it 5 stars, maybe some mushrooms or some other spice; I'm not sure since I am just starting out. I added some garlic and used fat-free sour cream, but it still needs more. My husband liked it, and he doesn't usually like asparagus!

Maybe this recipe has potential, but as is, it seems very bland to me.  I added two cloves of garlic, a can of cream of chicken soup, some processed yellow squash (I try to sneak in veggies whenever I can), plus some salt and pepper.  I tried it as soon as it came out of the oven, and, even after the additions, it still turned out quite tasteless.  So, after it cooked, I added basil, quite a bit of garlic powder, more cheese, and stuck fresh mushrooms throughout, then put it in the fridge.  When I heated it back up, I let it cook long enough for the 'shrooms to cook.  It was better, but not outstanding.  Still needs some zest (not the soap).  I will peruse the reviews to see if anyone has good suggestions to zing this up a bit.   I think this has potential to be a four-star recipe, but only two stars as it is.

I loved this recipe, but the rest of the family didn't like it as much.  I had increased the seasonings and added significant garlic and onion powder, but it could use a little something extra. I also added sour cream for more moisture and shredded parmesan in the casserole. Also mixed it all together as others suggested. Also needs additional baking or pre-steaming/cooking of asparagus for asparagus to not be so crunchy.  Overall, good...but needs many adjustments for flavor, cooking and assembly.

So I'm rating MY version of the recipe b/c it did end up significantly different from the original. I did about 6 or 7 chicken tenders. I also used whole wheat pasta too. I used about half a bunch of asparagus, a half can of vegetable broth, red pepper, and dried onion, garlic and celery flakes and the oregano. I was out of sour cream, so I ended up substituting a package of lite cream cheese. I also didn't have any parm, so I used what I had, which was pizza cheese. And despite all that, it really turned out quite good. I think next time I would do a little more chicken and asparagus in the mix and up the spices just a smidge. Surprisingly, I really liked the cream cheese in it! I also left it covered for 20 minutes to help keep the noodles moist, and uncovered it the last 5-10 minutes. Oh, and I threw on some bacon bits as an afterthought when I took the lid off. That seemed to add just enough flavor without making it seem too bacon-tasting. I definitely will be making this version again with the few tweaks I mentioned! Thanks for a great place to start!

I added cream of celery soup and the sour cream into the noodles. I also cooked the chicken in bite sized pieces with a zuchinni, mushrooms, asparagus and onion seasoned with garlic powder and pepper. I mixed in a little Cheddar, put it in a buttered dish, covered with bread crumbs and dotted it with butter. Yum!! Thank you for the great idea!

This dish was scrumptious.  I followed the changes that Shannon C suggested in her review.  I made this the night before to take to a pot luck dinner.  I had used 12 ounces of noodles because it’s what I had on hand and also used Cream of Celery soup.  The mixture seemed too thick before putting it in the oven so I lightened it up with some more sour cream.  When taste tasting it, I discovered that this recipe was delicious cold.  I decided to go ahead and cook it as per the recipe.  However, my sister-in-law and I both agreed that this dish was better cold than hot.  I will continue to make this recipe, but only as a cold salad.  This will make a lovely addition to my salad luncheons during the warm months.

I made this for my in-laws 3/2005 and the raves were great! Nothing left afterwards, everyone devoured it. A very simple recipe, quick and easy. I did use a multiple cheese blend with the parmesan.

Nice flavor, but the asparagus was hard as a rock -- need to cook before adding.  Also very runny.  Perhaps better to add cream of chicken soup instead of chicken stock?  I would also recommend mixing everything together rather than layering to keep the noodles moist and would use salt, pepper, and parmesan in the casserole as well as on top.

My family enjoyed this casserole but it wouldn't fit in a 1-1/2 qt. dish.  It barely fit in a 2 qt. dish.  My husband thought it needed more salt and it was a little runny, but we all had second helpings.  I will make it again, possibly thickening the sauce with flour next time and adding more chicken.

My family and I enjoyed this recipe.  I used turkey rather than chicken and added a yellow pepper to the mixture.  I used one cup of chicken broth and had no problems with that quantity.  I added the asparagus to the other veggies because what I had was thick stemmed and it probably wouldn't have gotten very tender during baking.  I also used low fat sour cream.  I topped with freshly grated parmesan cheese and shredded colby-jack.  Will definitely make this again.

We liked this a lot, but I was concerned about the abundant liquid other reviewers warned of, so I sauteed the asparagus before adding it to the casserole.  It wasn't runny at all.  I also added salt, but how much depends on how salty your chicken broth is.  My children all thought it was great and nobody stopped with just one serving!

Easy and tasty, but I find red peppers a little strong to mix with asparagus, which has a fairly delicate taste , so I left that out. I will use more asparagus next time. I I think it would be good with broccoli too.

The directions say to use a 1.5 quart casserole dish, which is way too small.   Also, it's hard to call this a chicken casserole when there is barely any chicken in it.  One cup of chopped chicken is not enough for a six person casserole.  Overall, I liked the flavor but had to add more salt and pepper.

Eh....Just like any other casserole.  Good but no wow factor. To much work for just so-so flavor. I try not to use the oven when asparagus is ready in my garden (summer) so that's why I gave 3 stars. Heated up my kitchen

This was pretty good and tasted better the next day.  I doubled the chicken, and used a 9x13.  I also added mushrooms, which I sauteed first.  In place of the chicken stock, I used 3/4 c of chicken brother and 1/4 c of white wine.  I subbed about 1 c of the sour cream with cream of chicken to reduce fat content.  I also had very little parm, so I sprinkled in cheddar which worked just fine.  I also sprinkled crushed stuffing crumbs on the top.  I used thin egg noodles.

Oh My! Used my canned chicken stock with fresh herbs from my garden. Added lots of homegrown garlic, and some creme cheese to the sour creme to make one cup. Added fresh basil leaves and topped with with Asiago cheese and french fried onions (from another reviewer) Thanks for posting this great recipe. Oh the chicken was grilled the night before. YUMMY!

This recipe has potential but as is isn't great.  I did not add the chicken broth because most reviews stated it was watery.  I went with just the sour cream and added a packet of Swanson's Flavor Boost.  However that was not enough and the noodles dried out.  I'm thinking maybe a combination of sour cream and cream of chicken soup would be adequate.  I don't think the layering is necessary and if I make it again I would mix everything together and top with Parmesan to bake.  The finished product was not bland but was not creamy and comforting either.

This is a really good recipe, especially with fresh asparagus.  I didn't have a red bell pepper, so I left that out.  I added a cup of shredded 4 cheese mix to the "wet ingredients"  and I sprinkled another cup of it on the top before I put it in the oven.  And I didn't fiddle with layers.  I put the cooked pasta (bow ties) on the bottom of the greased casserole and combined all the other ingredients and poured them over the noodles.  After 30 min @350F it was golden and YUMMY!!

This was ok. Not sure if I will make it again, but if I do I have a lot of ideas for improvement. I had a 9x9 pan left over to freeze. I basically drained it of the liquid that was supposed to be the sauce and will probably add an alfredo sauce and mushrooms and more asparagus to it when I pull it out to remake it.

I knew I was taking a big risk with this one, but also knew there would be opportunity to make adjustments since everything is pre-cooked and then layered.  Adjust I did!  The chicken mixture is very bland and watery.  I started with well seasoned chicken and subbed a green pepper for the red.  Then I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes.  In an attempt to thicken it, I decided to add 4oz of shredded parmesan to the mixture.   The end result was o.k., but 1c of chicken doesn't go far and was barely noticeable.  There is a lot of room for improvements with this recipe and you just have to tweak it to satisfy your tastes.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish - I made just a few changes from the original.  I had just over 1.5 lbs of chicken (Perdue breasts) which I partially cooked on the stove in a little bit of olive oil (I did season the chicken w/ salt, pepper, & a little paprika).  Then cut into pieces and added to celery/peppers (I used green, not red)/onion mixture.  I did use a chicken bouillion to make broth and didn't find the dish too watery at all.  I also added garlic powder to the mixture.  Mixed everything into a 9 x 12 pyrex (didn't "layer).  Then cooked as suggested.  My asparagus was thin to begin with so came out very nice after 30 min in the oven.  I didn't get the celery and probably wouldn't include it again.  Probably overdid it on the parmesan, but we like cheese in this family :).

My whole family liked this receipe even my finicky 7 year old.  The only exception to the receipe is that I didn't have sour cream so I used Cream of Mushroom Soup.  As well next time I would saute the asparagus a bit in the chicken broth before baking - it was far to crispy for our taste buds.  But overall everyone said a winner.

This was just okay.  A good way to clean out the fridge, but I'm not keeping this in my permanent file.  I did add a splash of white wine, minced garlic, and a can of mushrooms to liven it up a little.

i made this tonight and look forward to leftovers. i followed the rcp pretty closely with these changes: 2 cups chicken, doubled broth & sourcream, added bottled garlic, paprika(sweet) and several bold dashes of tabasco to the simmering sauce.  yes, the sauce is a bit runny when first presented, but i had none left on my plate when i was done. when reheated, the extra sauce will probably keep the dish from drying out. don't precook asparagus unless you like it mushy. next time i'll include diced tomatoes, scallions & a diced jalapeno. try this and make it your own.

I just made this recipe last night for the first time.  My family loved it.  I was fairly easy.  I would only suggest adding maybe 1 teaspoon kosher salt while assembling it, sprinkle over chicken mixture.  I used "light" sour cream and I added 3 different cheeses on top of the casserole, which just added to the flavor.  I used Asiago, Parm and Romano.  I would also add 1-3 fresh pressed garlic cloves to the saute next time.  I pulled up this recipe because I had all the ingredients and wanted to try something different.  It worked out great!!  I use a recipe as a "base" and add or take away items as I deem fit, I try to always put a healthy spin on recipes I try.  My family is trying to eat as healthy as possible.  I would recommend this recipe and we will be making this again and again.

Great casserole recipe!  I used low-fat sour cream and the rest was unchanged.  We really enjoyed this.  Sprinkled the top just before serving with fresh grated parm-reggiano cheese, and served with a crusty bread!

I doubled it using rotisserie chicken from the store.  Didn't add the red pepper and everyone went back for seconds.  I did add a couple of left over pork chops and veggies.  Awesome.

Not as good as I would have hoped. It has a really bland flavor & some of the noodles get too cooked & crunchy. My husband gave it a 6 out of 10... I gave it a 4 out of 10. I won't be making this again.

I thought that this casserole was good based on the changes I made, if I had made this as-is, I would have ended up with a very bland casserole.  I used pimiento rather than red pepper to skip having to chop, I enjoy pimiento in casseroles anyways.  I omitted celery as I had none.  I added a bit of sage and thyme in addition to the oregano.  After baking the casserole I stirred it, adding additional sour cream, with a pinch of nutmeg and a tsp of brown and serve, heating it through for about ten minutes in the oven.  After these changes we all enjoyed it.  As per previous reviews complaining of crunchy asparagus, fresh asparagus is crisp and we enjoyed it.

I used a little more chicken (maybe 1½ cups) and I omitted the red pepper (my husband doesn't care for it), but followed the recipe otherwise. Well, I mixed everything together instead of layering, but the taste would have been the same.... And we weren't impressed. It seemed like a waste of asparagus as its flavour was overwhelmed by everything else. I think we would have preferred it more made with spinach and the asparagus on the side. We just didn't really care for it. But thanks for sharing, Kathy. With tweaking, it might be more to our taste. :)

There was not much flavor to this dish.  It was just okay.  It needed LOTS of salt and I added quite a bit of Parm to try to give it some flavor.  It was just too bland for our house.

I seasoned my chicken with garlic, season salt and pepper prior to cooking. If you dont season your chicken, I imagine this dish would be very bland. I did steam my asparagus for a few minutes so that it was nice and tender. I assembled the casserole the nite before I intended to bake it, and just added the cheese when I was ready to pop it in the oven. It was good, but not great.

Great recipe that's a bit different.  I too made some changes.  Microwaved the asparagus just a bit to soften somewhat, also added garlic salt, basil instead of oregano. Along with the parmesan cheese some shredded Monterey Jack as a topping as well as the first layer, this also helps thicken sauce. I think you can adjust this even more with any spices or veggies that appeal to you.

Excellent and easy. A few changes though. I omitted peppers, added 1/2 cup white wine after sautéing onion and added asparagus with celery & chix stock. I also added 1/2 tsp. rosemary, salt and pepper (maybe more, I didn't measure) with the sour cream. I then added prepared rice to the mixture (no layering) and blended in fresh parm cheese and some swiss, and finally a little more of both cheeses on top to bake in stoneware casserole dish. Some complained it was too bland but my stock is well seasoned which probably helped the overall flavor. Both kids (4 & 7) had seconds - not a regular occurrence. Thanks, we love it!

We thought this was a great recipe.  It is refreshing to find a nice cassarole that does not use canned soup.  Unexpected guests dropped in and they loved it.  I did need to use a 2 quart dish and since I did not have celery on hand I left it out.  Will make this often.

This was a bit of a disappointment.  It smelled so good while it was cooking, but the end flavor was somewhat bland.  I added parmesan cheese while it was cooking, but that didn't quite do the trick.

It was okay...I reduced the liquid and it was still watery, so I added a little flour mixed with water to thicken it up after cooking.  Needed some salt and pepper also.  I think next time I will add the flour while it's simmering and a little more seasonings.  Will probably make again with modifications.

This recipe is much too wet. Perhaps 1/4 cup of stock?? Also, it seem to need something to thicken it--flour, more cheese, etc?

In spite of omitting the 1 cup of chicken stock, the casserole still was too runny.  It was o.k. but not spectacular in our opinion.

I fixed this for some guest and we all thought it was a great dish!  Being able to use fresh aspargus with noodles was what I enjoyed most.  It was also a nice looking dish.

This recipe was very easy and didn't take much effort at all.  The only thing I would suggest is adding a pinch of your favorite spices to the chicken mixture to liven it up a bit because it was a little bland.

First off, this need a 13 x 9 pan.   
Secondly too much sour cream.
Third, kind of salty.
Fourth the LAYERING IS POINTLESS.
Otherwise, great!

Really good!!  I followed other reviews & replaced the chicken broth with a can of cream of chicken, added Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes & sauteed the asparagus with garlic.  I also mixed everything together.

I made this per the recipe instructions. I only added 2 Tbl. of corn starch to the chicken broth to thicken it up since I did Not want to use canned, processed, and preserved cream of anything soup. Anyway the cornstarch thickened it up good enough. And it came out tasting great. Only I think next time I might use  a bigger dish to bake it in.

Talk about a yummy meal!  I made  few changes and I think it would help reduce a poor outcome like other have mentioned. Plus it’s complete in about 30 minutes!
I used an oven proof 12 in High side skillet to sauté the onion. I added shredded rotisserie chicken -double,the amount. (my store shreds the “day old” chicken and packages it in the deli) and as soon as I added the asparagus to the pasta water, I added the red pepper (used 2), the sour cream and a can of cream of celery soup to the onion in the skillet.  This offset the weird texture some shared. 
I boiled my noodles with 3 chicken bouillon cubes for 5 minutes. Then i added my chopped asparagus to blanch for 2. Before I strained I added 1 1/4 C of the pasta water to the chicken skillet about the same time as I added the soup/sour cream. 
Then I added the noodles and asparagus to the skillet mixed well and topped with the Parmesan cheese. Put it on in the oven on Broil for 5 minutes and it was complete. Lovely casserole. Thanks!!  Will make again.

Before I even get into my review, I have to say I didn't follow the recipe exactly as written.. I made it and used already cooked chicken and mixed everything together before baking. It was very dry and bland. I am not sure that following the exact recipe would have made a huge difference. I am going to try this again, but with more liquid.

I liked the sound of this recipe but changed it up a little. I sautéed the green and red pepper with onion until almost tender, added a can of chicken broth, sour cream and a can of cream of mushroom soup. I added basil and garlic salt to the oregano. I added the cooked chicken and simmered for a bit. In the casserole dish I spooned a thin layer of the chicken mix, then I used cooked jasmine rice instead of noodles. Because I used rice instead I had to make the chicken mix a bit more soupy so it would go into the rice. After rice I put canned asparagus pieces then more chicken mix, then the Parmesan cheese. I baked until the cheese was browned. My family loved it! Everyone had seconds and asked me to add it to the recipe box!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I added 6 cloves of fermented black garlic to the chicken mixture and I topped it with a mixture of caramelized onion crushed pretzels chip crumbs and softened diced organic butter. THE KIDS ATE ASPARAGUS! I used lefto'left o'er rotisserie.

Good recipe! I did not have any pre-cooked chicken so I diced up the chicken and cooked it in the skillet. I added the vegetable towards the end and cooked them with the chicken before continuing to step 3. I also added salt, pepper and granulated garlic for a little more flavor.

Seemed like a good idea because I had the ingredients. I usually read the reviews first, this time I did not. I agree that it was bland and watery.  The oregano and celery seemed out of place. My husband was excited when he saw it and exclaimed "turkey tettrazini." Not even close even with adding some additional ingredients in order to "save it."

Time intensive with all the chopping, which I wouldn't have minded if it was worth it. Bland, watery, and really a disappointment overall. Just tried to eat it again for lunch, thinking maybe it would help to have it sit overnight.

My version came out very dry.  The recipe bake time is way too long.  If the chicken is already pre-cooked as suggested, the bake time should be cut in half.  So disappointed.

I tried really hard to make this work...I love all the ingredients in it and thought the concept was great...but I wont be making this again.  First off, there is a LOT of prep involved, and if I am going to be dirtying 3 pans and doing that much chopping--it better be worth it!!  I made it just as recipe said, but befor putting in oven I tasted the chicken mixture and it was bland, like many other reviewers commented. So I added basil, more oregano, garlic salt, and ground pepper.  We also sprinkle top with french fried onions during last 10 minutes of bake time.  Unfortunately, the final product was still underwhelming.  Sorry!!

This was absolutely bland. I added salt/pepper as we were eating it. I used fresh asparagus which was al dente and that was ok as I don't like overcooked asparagus. I had leftover chicken and fresh asparagus which is why I decided to make this as well as lots of sour cream I wanted to use but I don't think I'll make this again as it really wasn't that special. Sorry.

This was an alright casserole.  Definitely edible but not super.  I think I didn't like the oregano.  I used whole wheat rotini and that worked great. I cooked 2 chicken breasts in the olive oil then tossed in the onions, 3 cloves of garlic until tender. Then I added in the rest of the vegetables.  I used 1 cup of chicken stock and brought to boil then covered and boiled for a few minutes to steam the asparagus.  I used the 1/2t of oregano and also added a generous sprinkle of pepper and some cayenne.  I added some flour in with only a cup of sour cream. I didn't have Parmesan so I used monteray jack and mixed some in with the casserole and then topped with some more.  I didn't use layers, I just mixed it all together.  It was a nice looking casserole, colorful and fairly healthy. I might try it again but omit the oregano.

Ew, no...this wasn't what I expected.  My asparagus ~ very thin so it wouldn't be tough ~ was just that.  Tough.  We didn't care for this at all.  Sorry!  I really did want to like it!

This was okay...a little bland. I'm not sure what I would change to help it out.

I thought this recipe was good. Reminded me of tuna noodle casserole kinda. I think I would have perferred to make that rather then this recipe. But for one looking for a chicken casserole, I would reccomend.

VERY bland.  Definately needs something to give it a kick.  I don't think I'd make this one again, but thanks!

We love this recipe in our house.  I add extra spices and we eat with fresh baked bread sticks. We use Greek yougurt , double to triple the cheese, add basil and Emerils Cajun spice. We make it more like a spicy cajun alfredo.

This was ok but not great.  I made a ton of changes (used cream of mushroom soup, added garlic and fresh ground pepper to the veggie mixture and used way more cheese than the recipe called for) and it was still pretty bland.    I picked out the asparagus (which was over cooked - DON'T boil first) and my husband ate the whole thing and went back for seconds.

Hope yours comes out better than mine.

WAY BLAND! The cold leftovers were worth the effort though, I guess. I thought the mix of textures were a nice change. But I think I will keep my asparagus to the oven, garlic and olive oil. Thank you anyways!

This is a great recipe and not difficult to make. I followed some of your reviews & added some garlic, salt & pepper. Also steamed the asparagus before putting in the casserole.

It tasted just as good when we had the leftovers for tea the next day.

I had never had fresh asparagus before trying this recipe. Now I can't go back to canned! My husband loved this recipe. It's delicious!

A "NICE" blend of flavors, but somewhat bland. I'll sprinkle some seasoned salt next time. That should boost it past a 4.

Okay, but really runny.  The asparagus was too hard, too.  Needs to be cooked first.

Great recipe!  I used 1/2 the sour cream and added a tin of mushroom soup.  I also cooked the asparagus a little before adding, mixing all the ingredients together in the casserole dish.

I added chili flakes, fresh garlic, garlic salt, pepper, and half can of cream of mushroom soup. I cut the sour cream to about a 1/2 cup and left out the celery.  It was still a tad runny, but it was very tasty.

Yummy!  Next time I might try to add a little garlic powder, or even replace the sour cream with cream of mushroom or cream of celery.

We enjoyed this recipe and will fix it again.  The key is to simmer the ingredients for the full 5 minutes.
