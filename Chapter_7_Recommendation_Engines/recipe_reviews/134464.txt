I am from Peru and our typical Peruvian Cebiche uses no potatoes, no celery, no cumin. 
We basically cut the fish into 1/2-inch pieces (I love Bass or Tilapia), add salt, pepper, chop fresh cilantro, a bit of garlic and lime juice (about 8-10 limes). Fish has to be cooked in the lime juice. You can add shrimp/clams/octopus, it's optional. My family loves the original Cebiche, fish only. Add some fresh Aji Amarillo (Peruvian chili, looks like the Habanero but its taste is amazing and unique) or Aji Amarillo paste - you can buy them at any Latin Market - and mix it with the lime juice. Add some lettuce on the side as well as peeled & cooked sweet potato (just a slice per person) and add some corn on the side as well (about 1/4 cup. 
Don't forget to add the onion (I use red onion - julienned red onion).

I laughed so hard when I read that a reviewer sauteed this!! Ceviche is ONLY "cooked" in the lime juice and is not placed over heat of any kind. I've never seen white potato served in a cevicheria...but the sweet potato is a must. The onion should be sliced and this should NOT be eaten over crackers if you want authentic. Usually it is either plain fish (bass is more common than tilapia) or a lot of mixed sea creatures you won't find for sale in the States. Like a lot of Peruvians, I prefer the pure fish version.

This was so delicious! The only changes made were to add cucumber, though I don't think it was necessary after having tasted it. The only changes I would make in the future would be to add more habanero because I like it spicy. Also great the next day with pita chips.

*edit: I noticed that another user actually cooked the fish by sauteing it but it should be noted that in a ceviche recipe the fish is "cooked" through the lime juice marinade. It requires no heat. I hope this helps!

This is the real thing! Ceviche is a Peruvian dish and well so far,from all the recipes this one is close to authentic. Le falto el choclo.

Great recipe. My mother is Peruvian and this is very authentic. I usually add more garlic than what is in this recipe. I also use lemon juice. My mom says its interchangeable - she usually makes it with lemon. And usually served with sweet potato & corn (not regular potato). The sweet of the sweet potato and corn is supposed to counteract the the tangy-ness of the ceviche. Although I admit I sometimes serve it with chips (like the Mexican version)

Very very good....like all ceviches are. THe next time I make this, I will dice the onions...the thin strips get in the way and are not conducive to being eaten on a chip or cracker. I loved the sweet potato...great contrast to the sour lime

This is almost the same recipe my wife and her mother who are from Peru use.  I love this and it is the best Ceviche I have had.  The only difference is they don't use sweet potato.  I recommend anyone looking for a good Ceviche recipe to give this a try.

I had some tilapia and shrimp so I decided to make this recipe.  Wasn't quite sure how I should have cooked them so I sauteed them in the pan with some cooking spray.  Also, I did not use the habanero pepper since I do not like the heat.  My fiance loved it, I thought it was ok.

delicious recipe. i made it for 2 potlucks and it was a hit both times. i used large/jumbo frozen precooked shrimp both times and just cut them to smaller pieces...i am a bit wary of "cooking" raw shrimp only in lime juice.

Our neighbor from Peru loved this recipe. It tasted just like the Ceviche that he makes. My hubby and I loved this recipe. If you like Ceviche, this is the best recipe. ( Peru style )

There was too much lime for my tastes, so much so that I couldn't eat it. I also have to say that eating shrimp in little bits was not pleasant for me, so I would definitely leave them whole.

Taste great. Only changes I will do is.  Remove cumin, use celery powder and ginger powder instead. Add a pinch a bit of half & half. Served with sweet potatoes previously boiled with cinnamon and brown sugar.
