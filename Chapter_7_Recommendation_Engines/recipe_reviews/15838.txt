I found a strawberry pie recipe once that instructed me to mix chopped strawberries with cornstarch and boil to create a glaze -- what a horrid mess it made! I ended up dumping it all down the drain.   I use Marie's strawberry glaze and use my own real whipped cream as it tastes so much better than Cool Whip. Using small-medium sized berries makes for a better presentation -- turning them pointed side up.  This recipe is simple and delicious!   It reminds me of the pie served at Bob's Big Boy. Thanks Michelle!

Easy, awesome result! I used fresh strawberries & whipped cream from the can. It looked like I bought it from the store.  My family ate the WHOLE pie in less than an hour.

I made this for my family's Memorial Day cook-out. I used graham cracker crusts and even used the mini-crusts for the grand children to have their own pie. These were a great hit as always!!! This is the first time I used a different crust and my family raved about these pies and asked me to keep making them with the graham cracker crust. I also used fresh berries. This is an easy, refreshing summer treat when strawberries are plentiful. I have never tried it with the frozen berries, but this is a 5+ with fresh berries!!!

I actually made this today.  I didn't even know it was a recipe on this site (my mom gave me the directions... I'm pretty bad when it comes to "real" cooking. lol).  It was simple to make and tastes delicious, especially on a hot day like today!  This recipe was simple to make, yet awesome!!  The only difference I used was I cut up fresh strawberries as opposed to the frozen ones.

Good, but hard to serve after it is totally frozen- take out of the freezer about 10-15 min. before hand
