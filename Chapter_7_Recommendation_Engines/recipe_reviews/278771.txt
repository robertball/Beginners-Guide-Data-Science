This recipe is awesome ! Easy to make, and the different flavors blend together perfectly. I made it as is, nothing more is needed . I made the sauce and the broccoli slaw the night before because my mornings are hectic. Quick, easy and delicious!

Yum, the chicken was wonderful , the slaw was good, after trying as is it was a touch bland so I added a bit more cider vinegar & rice vinegar, perfect, the bang bang sauce was bang on, this recipe is a keeper

Loved it ... So did my whole family! .  I did take a few short cuts with a ready made broccoli coleslaw but I did use the recipe for the vinaigrette to mix in with it.
