8.25.11 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/192532/tuna-cashew-casserole/ ... I like this, but no one else in my family does.  Oh, well, more for me!  :)  I add more noodles in it & on it.  Also, sautee some onion with the celery  Cream of celery soup works fine, too.  Microwavable.

We love this....first time made as submitted.  Next time made a few additions!  It is great with canned chicken too.   Added fine chopped onions/sliced waterchestnuts (cut in quarters) and small can of sliced mushrooms undrained instead of the water!  Also have added a few frozen peas to the mix!  We eat this at least once a month!  Good stuff maynard!!!  Thanks native SDgirl.   You don't need the cashews with the chestnuts!

This was pretty good... I added a 1/4 cup of sour cream to it.  Quick, easy meal especially when you're cooking for 4 kids and a husband.  ;)

This brings back some memories.  I remember this being served at my college cafeteria, which actually had some pretty good food.    I just remember it being quite salty.  I would use unsalted cashews and reduced fat and/or sodium soup.

This was really good; you can't go wrong with cashew nuts!  I added more tuna - 2 5-oz. cans instead of 6 oz, to make it a little more substantial; it didn't seem like 6 oz of tuna went far enough for 4 servings.  So along with the extra fish I added 1/3 cup of fat-free sour cream to keep it as creamy as the original recipe.  Made great leftovers for lunch the next day; heated up nicely even though the chow mein noodles on top lost their crunch.

Yummy!! I doubled the recipe but only had 1 can of Cream of Mushroom and 1 can of Cream of Celery 97% fat free so used those. I used all the celery and added sliced carrots and 2green onions. My husband loved it!!

I loved this. We used to make it at my grandmother's house for 4-H.  Best of all, it doesn't have any peas.

Used broken up ramen noodles instead of the canned chow mein ones and added corn to the mix. We didn't care for this, and thankfully did not use that much cashews (they aren't cheap), more like 1/4-1/3 cup lightly crushed.

This was a recipe I made when my kids were little. It is the perfect tuna casserole. The only thing I would do differently the next time is use the proper amount of water. LOL put a wee bit too much in. may use nonfat milk instead of water. i am definitely making it again.

Was definitely not a fan, would not recommend and I love all the ingredients, just not mixed together, not a good recipe if your a texture person. The canned chow mein was horrible
