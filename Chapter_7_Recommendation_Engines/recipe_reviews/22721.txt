These things are great. If you pour the shot carefully you can layer the Irish cream onto the whiskey. For full flavor use Jameson Irish whiskey, Bailey's Irish cream, and Guiness.

That is just way too much to drink all at once.  Whatever you do, don't let it sit around for any length of time.  Just drink it.

It tastes like chocolate milk with a bit of a kick.  It's a great way to start a night of drinking.

This is my favorite drink of all time!!! I can drink like a fish when I have these...not recommended though! LOL. I definately use Jameson, Bailey's, and Guiness...and it does not curdle if you drink it fast enough! So chug away! That is the point! I love love love these!

If you don't like to chug your booze then stay away. I absolutely LOVED this drink! It's festive and with plenty of people drinking along it's a scream.  I like to fill the shot glass with the Baileys and leave a touch of room for the whiskey-which does curdle by the way.

My friends and I love these.  I don't like Guinness alone, but this way it tastes like chocolate milk.  You have to drink it all at once, though.  And careful...they sneak up on you!

ITS SPELLED JAMESON, FOR THE PERSON THAT WROTE JAMISON. SECONDLY THIS RECIPE IS OKAY BUT IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FULL OUNCE OF IRISH WHISKY WITH 1/2 OUNCE IRISH CREAM ON TOP. IT MAKES FOR A MORE POTENT TREAT AS WELL.

This is one of my favorite ways to start out a night of revelry! DEFINITELY use Jameson, Baily's and Guiness. It's not nearly as good any other way!

Tastes like chocolate milk when you make it with Guinness. Make sure to serve cold.

Sooo goood!  You really have to chug it or else the Baileys will curdle.  But it's absolutely delicious,  warms the heart and puts you in a good mood.  No ill effect the next day for me after downing three of these.  But, of course, I'm Irish :)

Been making/ drinking these shots for years. I agree, kind of tastes like chocolate milk, just with a little kick. Definitely not for those who like to sip on their booze, hence the fact that it's a shot. I don't think there's any way around it. So you're going to want to drink it fast and all at once. It's perfect for St. Patty's day, but I like it any day of the year. On Christmas it's like "forget the eggnog, give me an Irish car bomb."
