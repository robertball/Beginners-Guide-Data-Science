There is no way to form a ball with a batter that runs off the spoon. Fortunately I got already suspicious before I wasted four eggs for the egg white mix and used the batter I had for a cheese cake recipe - which turned out great but was not what I wanted :-(
Since I don't know what Italian Cheese Balls are (and none of my native Italian guests could tell me either) I wasn't sure if I just could add more flour?!

I have it in the oven right now, but I followed the recipe exactly and there is no way to make it into balls because it comes out like a cake batter, so I just put it in a glass pan and I guess I will cut it into pieces.  Maybe you should check the ingredients better, it should be drier.

I would give it zero stars if I could. There is definitely something wrong with this recipe. I should have read the reviews before I made them.  I was looking for a nice appetizer for Thanksgiving, and this was a disaster.  Making as directed, there is no way to roll these into balls - the result is mostly liquid.  I cooked them anyway to see how they would come out, and it's not even worth serving, as I would not even know how to serve them. I hope the author can make corrections.  Very dissappointed that I spent time and money on ingredients for this recipe.

If you want cheese balls, everyone is right on target -- the batter is too liquidy to make into balls.  That said, like others I simply baked them and they tasted pretty darn good.  I did add an extras 8oz. of cream cheese in an effort to make the batter more solid.

This recipe was missing something. I was unable to roll the 'balls' ... I was very excited but left disappointed.

I have no idea how anyone could make a ball from this. Maybe in a deep fryer like hush-puppies. 

I read the reviews and thought I could just bump up the dry Ingredients and make a ball, no way. After about 3 1/2 cups of Bisquick its still way too loose to ball. To salvage the mess I added enough milk to turn it into a batter and baked it at 350 for around 35 min till it was browning on top. Everybody loved it. It turned out like a cheese cakey pan cake type cake. It was great with Blueberry Syrup

There is definantly something wrong with this. I believe it needs more flour. Would love to hear what bunnybutt did to get it to work.

this recipe is not what it is made up to be. They turned out more like cookies...No way could I form them into balls. Would not make this again.

The batter  (NOT a dough) has a light, lemony flavor to it,  but it is still liquid after following this recipe.  I added 4 cups additional flour and 1 C Bisquick (ran out of flour!).  They are currently baking, and I will let you know the results.  I'm not terribly confident this will work out...

I tried this recipe just as it was printed, no way could I roll balls, the recipe was so wet, I added up to 2 cups of flour before I could even make it into a ball. I used a cookie scooper(like an ice cream scooper but in different sizes) and was able to get a semi ball but it flattened when it was cooked. Also there was no flavor left. Please tell me what I did wrong.

This recipe needs to be tweaked and adjusted.  This is way to runny to make balls.  I added more cream cheese and baked in individual muffin tins, added a strawberry compote and whipped cream to save the dish.

If you want it to stay together you need to use Bisquik instead of flour
