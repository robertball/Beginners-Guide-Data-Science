this is a good basic recipe for soon du bu but i just made some changes to make it more authentic :) first, its all about the broth! I bought dried anchovies (take out the intestine/gut whatever) into a pot with water the garlic, onion, shitake mushrooms and dried kelp! Bring up to a boil for 5 mins on high, then an extra 15-20 mins on low. Then remove the shitake mushrooms and chop them up into small pieces. Then using your clay pot whatever you're using, could be a large sauce pan,  with cooking oil, cook the beef with the korean chili powder. Once the beef is almost brown, add the korean fremented chili paste and the shitake mushrooms. Add the broth into the sauce pan (avoid picking up the anchovies, onion, and garlic :) ). Add the soft tofu. Add a teaspoon of fish sauce (or whatever to your liking, this can be omitted) Once it starts boiling, add the crack egg. Add a teaspoon of seseme oil! it gives a great smell and makes the soup a little more tasty!

This was the first time I succeeded in making soon dubu jigae. It is the Korean soy bean paste that brings this together. I've been making it without the soybean paste and the soup was never as tasty as this. I didn't have ground beef but while frying the chilli powder, I crumbled up some dried soup anchovies instead. I added some mixed seafood at the same time I dropped in the soft tofu, along with some chopped jalapeno peppers. It tastes authentic like the ones you purchase from the Korean restaurants. Thank you for the recipe!

Made this soup for my aunts as they were trying out a new diet and this recipe fit within the guidelines. The bonus was they love all Asian cuisines! I used ground venison instead of beef, and black sesame seeds as they were what I had on hand. I also replaced the water with beef broth and I lessened the amount of tofu used as the package I purchased was not 12 oz. My aunts truly enjoyed it; thank you susi EM for posting this easy stew recipe! Next time I may take other reviewers suggestions and add some shittake mushrooms.

This recipe was very tasty! I did add a bit more ground beef, probably double or triple, I just eyeballed it but it was definitely more than 2 tbsp.

I made this as per directions.  The only change I initially made was to use black bean paste instead of soybean paste and didn't add the egg. Initially I found this recipe to be as watery as soup and almost tasteless (sorry!), so then I began doctoring.  I added mixed canned beans, potato, carrot and some taro root, which turned it into a stew.  At that point it was edible and not bad, but I still didn't like it enough to make it again.

Easy, fast, and flavorful with or without meat.  Made it vegetarian and it was really great.  I served with rice on the side!

This was great, but I have to agree with missLEDO, the sesame oil and the anchovies were A-MA-ZING

This is a good recipe.  I read missLEDO’s review, but decided to make the recipe as written.  The only change I made was to put only 1/2 the box of soft tofu into the soup (I doubt the whole 12 oz would fit).  I cannot attest to it’s authenticity, but I suspect it is; the flavors are bold and complex, and it does not need a special broth.  The water does just fine with the doenjang and korean chili powder.  It comes together so quickly, too.  My Chinese grocer had another type of soy bean paste as well, so make sure you pick up the doenjang.  Also, it may serve 2 as an first course, but it’s just one serving for me.  Thank you, susi EM, for a super tasty and easy recipe!

This is more a note for my future self. I took the advice of another reviewer and added my own mods. 
In one pot: Browned ground beef with cayenne and roasted dry chilies, then added gojujang and miso paste since I didn't have doenjang. I also didn't have soft tofu so I cubed up some extra firm tofu with 5spice bean curds and added it to the fry at he end.
In another pot: dry fried the anchovies, onion, garlic, kelp, and rehydrated dry shitake until lightly browned. Then added some water along with the shitake-soaking liquid and brought it to boil. Simmered this for a bit, then added to the ground beef mixture except the onion and garlic. Seasoned with salt and fish sauce, dropped in an egg, and drizzled in a bit of sesame oil. Lastly, garnished with green onion.

I doubled this recipe and started by adding garlic and onion to the pan and substituted the beef with shittake mushrooms and bean sprouts.

The soybean paste and chilli powder make this recipe (also neither of these are expensive if that is a worry). If you choose to omit the egg, the soup loses some body but is still delicious. I followed this recipe exactly with the ingredients 3x and it came out beautifully! New household staple.

Followed the directions exactly, using all the appropriate ingredients, and the end result was watery and bland, almost tasteless.  I might make this again if using vegetable or beef stock maybe, or the homemade stock I see in a previous review with shittake mushrooms and anchovies could work.

It's good, but needs more flavor.  I made vegetable stock to add more flavor.
