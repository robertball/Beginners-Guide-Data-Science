These are excellent.  My husband and son don't like regular rice krispy treats but they both loved these.  These are more substantial and flavorful.  Two tips: 1) To make pressing the mix down in the jelly roll pan easier, put a plastic baggie on your hand like a glove and spray the "palm" side with cooking spray; then you can press it down evenly with your hand and not mess with a buttered spoon. 2) Sprinkle the chocolate and butterscotch chips over the top of the still warm, newly pressed down krispy mix; the chips will melt and you can smooth them out with a butter knife so you don't need to clean your double boiler.  If they don't melt enough, just slip the pan into a low temp oven and watch carefully until they start to glisten; then you can spread them out. This recipe makes a lot.

Thank you for this great start to my husbands favorite sweet treat. I changed it just a little- I added a half cup more peanut butter and instead of butterscotch chips I added all chocolate. Thank you I have been looking for this recipie for a year, every time my husband had this he didn't  know who made it to ask for the recipe. Such a great time with the kids!

These bars were amazing!!!  The one thing I did differently was substituted the 2 cups of butterscotch chips with 2 cups of Reeses Peanut Butter chips.  I LOVE peanut butter!  I spread all the chips out on top of the pan and put the pan in a warm oven till they got shiney.  Then just spread it out.

These were so good! I was looking for something that resembled Crispy treats with a chocolate frosting on top but without peanut butter because my husband and daughter are allergic. I did everything exactly the same excluding the peanut butter. I am sure these would be even better with it but had to make something so I would notend up eating them all!! My extended family just raved about these. Thank-you!

I would like to try these again, but would use chocolate chips only for the topping. The butterscotch chips added a strange chemical-like taste that we didn't care for. A half batch of these worked well in a 9-inch pan.

Great recipe for a different twist on the ordinary Rice Krispy Treats!  Again I am testing recipes for our annual Breast Cancer bake sale going on for the month of October.  The recipes I find on here are usually winners and reading what comments everyone posts on here are very helpful as I just tossed the chocolate chips on put the oven on to broil for about a minute or two then spread it gave it a nice looking topping instead of just plain one color brown, next time I might add in some white chocolate chips! Thanks for sharing!

My mother was not interested in cooking but this is one recipe I remember her making and we all loved it.  She put the bars in a deeper dish with the "frosting" between the layers.  Less messy for lunch boxes or little hands!  I brought them as a treat for everyone where I work and everyone wanted the recipe.

I only had a 10 ounce bag of marshmallows, so I had to scale the recipe down.  I made it 12 servings and everything worked out great.  Delicious - they're a little more substantial than regular Krispie treats, and the peanut butter adds to these in a good way.  I melted chocolate and peanut butter chips and used a fork to make a design on top rather than mixing them together.  I think they're prettier this way, and will make a great treat for work tomorrow.

These were very very good. The peanut butter and sugar made these too sweet for us, though. I made these to bring to a Halloween party and added Halloween sprinkles on top. Everyone raved about them. I will reduce the sugar if I make them again.

Wow!!  This was DELICIOUS!!  I cut the recipe in half and made in an 11x7 pan (and had a little extra that I squashed into a bowl).  I also used 1.5 cups butterscotch chips and .5 cups chocolate chips, rather than half of each since I was looking to use up my butterscotch chips.  I also used giant marshmallows and only had 6 oz (called for 8 oz of minis).  These turned out AMAZING!  This recipe is a keeper - best rice krispie treats ever!!

My daughter's favorite! She's already asked if I'll make them for her class which started yesterday! I always try to use up cereals that aren't getting eaten like cheerios or chex or other less sugary ones.

Thought it was too sweet at first, now I keep going back to get another one.  Kind of addicting.  Kids love them too.

I made these to take to work and they were a huge hit, not a single one left on the plate! They turned out perfectly! The only thing I did differently was substitute 1 cup of the butterscotch chips with 1 cup of peanut butter chips to help cut back on the sweetness. Even with this small change, they are still very rich!

These bars were GREAT!! The topping was a bit to rich, maybe mix peanut butter  with the choc. chips for a lighter taste.

Good recipe and easy to make. Next time I think I'd like to use peanut butter chips instead of the butterscotch chips (made it a little too sweet).
