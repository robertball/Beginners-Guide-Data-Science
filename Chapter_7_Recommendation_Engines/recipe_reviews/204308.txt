HELLO magnificent flavor!!!!  I couldn't wait 2 whole weeks to give it a taste so I dipped my spoon into it to try and ended up making sandwiches with it as soon as it came out of the blender. I used it on sharp cheddar and pastrami sandwiches and it held up very well against those strong flavored foods. My husband says we will NEVER purchase mustard again.  I highly recommend making this if you enjoy a good hardy mustard!

WOW!  I barely know where to start...thanks to Can_it_Rachael's review and rave in the buzz, I knew I would try this recipe.  Try as I might, I simply could not find ANY of the type of mustard seed this recipe calls for, but since I was too impatient to order online, I used simply "mustard seed" from my bulk store, and "hot mustard powder" to replace the Oriental seed (as I gather they are the spicier of the three).  The taste is simply incredible, and like Rachael, I couldn't wait two weeks to try it!  I doubled the recipe, and got perfectly enough to fill three 500 ml wide mouth jars.  I used 1 tsp of "hot mustard powder" for the doubled recipe, and got a very noticeable ZING (no complaints here!), but for those that prefer a milder mustard (and couldn't find the original mustard seeds called for and must substitute) they may want to start with 1/2 or even 1/4.  I am so thrilled with how this turned out that I too, will never purchase a grainy mustard again!  Thanks so much, I am so pleased!  Update:  This tasted spicier at first, now after maturing, it is more mellow...still 'tangy' but not hot.  So, next time I won't reduce the hot mustard powder, and may even add more!

Delicious!  The hardest thing was finding the right mustard seeds, but after that - easypeasy! Perfect balance of flavors.  I did add a good dose of black pepper to my batch and a bit more salt.  Wonderful texture and it looks quite fancy too!  I am adding this to my list of homemade goodies for holiday gifting.   Thanks so much for the recipe!***UPDATE*** I made a plain yellow variety for my daughter who prefers "not so spicy"  Followed the recipe but used 1 cup yellow seeds.  She loves it! I love this recipe!

This mustard is really good. I had a feeling I was going to like this very much. I special ordered the all the seeds. And it was rather easy to make...but I goofed on the 1st batch. I forgot the honey and it was totally a hot firecracker. It still has a bite even with the honey but it's all good. Now I choose to make 2 batches because I have a kid allergic to apples and I wanted her to be able to enjoy the mustard and not be told, sorry can't eat it. So I made a batch with Distilled White Vinegar and that's the one I forgot to add the honey. And it was flaming. The 2nd batch with the Apple Cider vinegar is the one I added a sugar free honey and it was also when I realized I forgot the honey on the 1st. I pulsed and grinded the mustard down as far as I could. We love it....You can totally leave out the Oriental mustard seeds if need be, that's where this recipe gets it's heat. I'm totally tickled stumbling across this recipe. It's a total keeper and it also helps with other ideas for mustards. Pelicangal, I salute your recipe. If I can make my family mustard verses buying it in the store. I've saved some money. Because the seeds in bulk, the ingredients that went with it, sure makes up the difference. I don't mind making fresh, when it's this easy. TY!

AWESOME! I can't believe I made my own mustard, lol! I did have to omit the Oriental mustard seeds because I couldn't find them, but that was my only change. This is spicy, tangy and delicious! I made it yesterday, but just had to try some today on my turkey sandwich, lol. I can only imagine how good it's gonna be after 2 weeks if it already tastes this good after only 1 day! This was so much fun and very easy. I will be making my own mustard from now on! Thanks for sharing. :)

One word...delicious!  I forced myself to wait the entire two weeks.  I bought a fresh loaf of bread from the farmer's market this morning, got some premium lunch meat from the grocery store and sat down to one of the best sandwiches I have ever had...certainly the best I have made thanks to this mustard.  I couldn't find the Oriental mustard seeds so I just used a teaspoonful of the powder.  I no longer have to purchase mustard.  No store bought mustard will ever compare to this homemade one anyway.  Thanks pelicangal!

FANTASTIC!!!! Like others, I had to order the Oriental seeds, but that was easy enough. I too couldn't believe how much of the vinegar they were able to absorb! Who knew making mustard was so easy?!?! I've shared it with friends & family and we keep a jar in the office fridge - everyone Loves it! And "tangy" is the perfect description. Thank you, pelicangal!!! This recipe is SO a keeper!

Very good mustard.  Dried thyme is not a favorite for me, so we omitted that, and I didn't have any oriental mustard seeds and omitted those, too.  Nevertheless, the mustard is very good already even though we just made today.  I added more honey to one of the jars, and that's great, too.  I will definitely make this again!
ADD'L INFO:  I mixed some of this mustard with a bit of heavy cream to make a mustard sauce for grilled chicken and steak....AWESOME!!

This mustard was awesome! Like others I cant believe I made my own mustard. I had to order the mustard seeds on myspicesage.com. I gave a jar to a friend who served it at a get together and it was loved by all. I will be making this again when my stock runs low. Thanks Pelicangal!

I have not made this yet but my sister made this and gave some to me along with some mustard seeds and canning jars as a present. I am in love with this mustard.  The texture is perfect and the taste is dead on for my preference.  I go through alot of mustard and she said it was so simple to make.  I will be making this soon...can not wait!

So tangy, spicy and good! Wow....who knew....never made mustard before and was just amazed how the seeds just totally absorb the vinegar.....I omitted the Oriental seeds as I could not find them anywhere....I did order my brown and yellow seeds in bulk at Amazon.com and they were quite cheap. My only mini change was to added a lil more honey....this is so simple to make and I made 4-half pint jars of mustard. They will be given as gifts this Christmas season....and I even bought more vinegar to make another batch. Very nice! I love a "grainy" mustard personally....so this was right up my alley. And I made this in my food processor and was able to control the consistency with no problem. Excellent recipe!

WOW!
Seriously who knew that mustard was sooooooo easy to make?
This recipe is awesome! Super easy, absolutely delicious!
I too, like the other reviewers, couldn't wait 2 weeks to start the taste testing. I made a double batch so I'll see if there's something magical happening after 2 weeks but I gotta say it's already magical tasting.
Two things I did differently. I left out the thyme and I didn't have oriental mustard seeds but after reading that they were the hottest mustard seed available I just substituted a teaspoon of wasabi powder.
My mustard tastes power packed!
I blended the batch two two different consistencies for variety. One I left rather chunky, mostly whole seeds and the other I blended smoother. Just for kicks and thrills. :)
If you are thinking about making this...stop thinking, just do it. :)

Outstandingly delicious! This was so easy to make and the flavor is bold and bright. The oriental mustard seeds pack a wasabi like punch that you feel in your nose (when first blended) that will mellow after 2 weeks. I did let my mustard sit for 2 weeks before using so it had the time to develope and come together. I liked this full bodied mustard best on a hearty sandwich of rye and corned beef or a brat. I ordered all my seeds on line. Thanks pelicangal for sharing. This recipe is awesome!!

The only ingredient that I had to find was the Oriental mustard seed. I couldn't find the seed, but I did find the powder in bulk on Amazon. I make a homemade Dijon mustard for myself, but my husband prefers this spicier mustard. Between the two, we never buy store stone-ground mustard any more. This recipe is absolutely wonderful. I have to admit that we seldom wait a full 2 weeks before using it.

TANGY!  I had no idea that mustard was this easy to make.  It definitely is spicy and tangy and is a nice addition to our favorite mustards.  This really took me my surprise.  Thanks for sharing pelicangal!

I made this recipe as stated excepted I processed in a hot water bath like the original submitter of beer mustard stated... the mustard had really good flavor when I canned it, the thyme definitely was a powerful flavor... we'll see what a week or two in the fridge does... this recipe was very similar to the Beer Mustard with beer swapped in for some vinegar and no thyme... both these recipes are great recipes to experiment with...
