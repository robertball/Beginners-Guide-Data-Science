Easy and delicious! This definitely is a nice twist on regular 'ol tuna salad. I left out the peanuts and replaced that with walnuts. I also added in a little optional green onion. I mixed the mayo and seasoning in a separate bowl before folding it into the tuna and other ingredients. For the dressing I used 2 Tbsp. of Hellman's light mayo cut with 2 Tbsp. of reduced fat sour cream for added creaminess and reduced the curry to 1 tsp. which was plenty. It chilled for a half an hour and it came out really good. Overall, a great combination of flavors! Especially good on whole grain bread!

This needed about two tablespoons of mayonnaise - I used 1 tsp of curry powder and it was more than enough.  The curry kind of masks the other flavors.

I reduced the celery by half.  I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise and doubled it.  It was still really bland and dry with the dressing doubled.

Start by using less curry powder!  I ended up feeling comfortable with 1 1/2 tsp. curry powder.  I also like my tuna salad to bind together a bit more, so added extra mayonnaise. The addition of peanuts and raisins made this quite interesting!  Thanks for the recipe!

I had it, it was okay.  Definitely include the raisins-- they do a great job of brightening up the curry.  Not a huge fan, I'll probably not make it again, but it was very straight forward and I had all the ingredients at home.

This is such a refreshing, "exotic" twist on an old standby. I was surprised how nicely the curry flavor meshed with the mayo. And the little bursts of sweetness and crunch make for a delicious experience.

Omitted peanuts as I didn't have any and substituted sour cream for the mayo and doubled the amount. Was a great basis for my subtle changes. Will definitely make it again.

Very flavorful, I loved it. When I finished putting it together I usually taste so this time was no different.  Big mistake, after my "taste", there was barely enough left to make one sandwich with, and I had doubled the recipe. ) Oy vay.

The only change I made was in not measuring anything, which I only usually do in baking recipes. Also I had no celery, and didn't add the sugar.

I will definitely make this again. Now I have to rush out to buy some more tuna fish.

I tweaked this...I took out the peanuts and replaced the raisins with craisins. I also never measure spices, but I guessed right because it was delicious. I will be making this again!
