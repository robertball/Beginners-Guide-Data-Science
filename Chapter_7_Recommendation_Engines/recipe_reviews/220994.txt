Wonderful scone recipe - I froze the butter and then grated it into the dry ingredients. I added a little more sugar, as I love a sweet scone. I used half and half instead of milk and after the egg wash topped them off with turbinado sugar for that extra added crunch. This is a great base for add-ins like dried cranberries and white or dark chocolate chips. These come out of the oven beautiful... almost look too good to eat!

Light, fluffy, and delish. I added dried cherries instead of currants, used splenda instead of sugar, and used almond milk in place of milk, and the recipe turned out great. Super delicious; I could not just have one.  I will definitely save this recipe and use again. 

Thanks Chef John for posting this.

Absolutely delicious. Moist, tender and a perfect scone. Like the other reviewer, I used splenda and dusted half tof the scones with raw sugar. YUMMY!

These scones were very good. I enjoyed the video and Chef John's sense of humor.  I made them as outlined in the recipe.  I much prefer to read reviews that are made as outlined. When you change things without having made the original first, you're not really giving an accurate review. As far as I know, there is no true way to make scones. Not unless you invented them. I've been making scones for my husband for over 40 years and we enjoy the many different takes on scones. We do like currants in the scones and we usually eat them after dinner for dessert instead of in the morning.  This is a very good recipe which I will make again and added it to my huge collection of scone recipes. Thank you Chef John!

These are on the other side of fantastic!  I added candied ginger, lemon zest and vanilla.  The possibilities are endless!

Very good!  I used my homemade fat free yogurt instead of sour cream and dark chocolate chips since I had no dried fruit. My 4 year old helped me and she also loved these!

This would be a 5-star recipe if the measurements were accurate. I was hoping for some reader comments but had to figure it out myself. I ended up increasing the amount of flour to about 2 cups and I would have added just a little bit more sugar (not too much, since scones shouldn't be overly sweet and it would overpower the natural sweetness of the orange/cranberries I used).

With those adjustments, though, it's a great recipe! Very authentic and delicious! The center is moist but it's got a nice crusty outside. Like other reviewers said, it's so versatile! I might try lemon or candied ginger next time.

Delicious! I used skim milk and light sour cream. I forgot to brush the egg and milk on top but I did sprinkle some sugar on top before baking. I didn't have any currants so I used some strawberry tidbits I had laying around. Very simple and very good!

Hey Chef Jon - Thanks!  Most scones I have purchased in small bakerys are pretty hard and 90% of the time, a bit of a letdown.  NOT THESE!  I made the recipe but with chocolate chips (rounded 1/3 cup of regular sized chips and more will go in next time) and they were GREAT!  Never made scones before.  The second time I made them - 4 days later, I added 1 tsp orange zest (to the dry) and  about 1.5 tsp fresh squeezed OJ (to the wet).  I also made them mini scones (got 12 to 14 instead of 8) and they were done in 12/13 minutes.  I put a glaze on them (6tbsp confectionary sugar, several drops of milk, few drops of vanilla, 2.5 tsp OJ and 2 tsp orange zest).  They were GREAT.  I love the Panera orange scones, and these are right up there with them.  I did make the glaze too thin, Panera does that better - for now!  Thanks again for a GREAT base!  In a few days, lemon vanilla!  

  If possible, could you please explain why or what makes a scone/bread/biscotti recipe?  I've seen other scone recipes with an egg.  I don't experiment enough to know what that does.  If everyone understood the basics of it, the recipe can be modified with a greater chance of success.  In the whole scheme of things, I've been pretty happy with most recipes.  I've found a few things to really watch out for - get an oven thermometer and pay attention to the baking time.  Do not overbake!  When I make banana bread, I use close to the amount of flour as bananas, but I like it moist.  Hope this helps someone!

I know others didn't like the fact that these weren't so sweet, but that's the part I like about these. The only problem I had was the dough was waaaay too sticky to work with. I didn't watch the video before I made this (which I should have..then I wouldn't have dipped my hand like I did trying to form a "ball" like I do for other scones/biscuits). It was IMPOSSIBLE to get them off my hands without water!!! So I just had to drop spoonful of dough onto a bakings sheet. I tried to "knead", but of course I couldn't even do that.. :( And to make the situation even worse, I had put some blueberries to the dough, and you can imagine how purple the dough must have turned out! BEYOND messy I tell ya... Because it was so messy I coudn't even do the egg wash. So my purple "scones" with butter chunks tasted OK, but nothing too spectacular. Now that I watched the video and got a hang of how to handle the sticky mess better, I will try again with some dried current or something.

I have never made scones before. I chose this recipe because it sounded authentic. My very British-Irish fiance said these reminded him of  home. This is a wonderfully easy recipe and absolutely delish. Light and fluffy, beautiful taste and presentation! I have used semi- sweet chocolate chips instead of currants and they still bring rave reviews. I recommend cutting the butter into pieces prior to freezing. As Chef John stresses, very, very cold butter (not margarine) is the key to success! For an extra special treat spread Irish butter on your scone before eating. (We use kerrigold).

Perfect sweetness and texture!  It's a great basic recipe that you can substitute lots of different fruits for the currants.  I made it with sweetened, dried cranberries (craisins) and they came out moist and just the right amount of sweetness.  Also, they were still moist and flavorful 2 days later - unlike other scone recipes I've tried that are good right out of the oven but dry and hard the next day.  Definitely a keeper!

Re: amount of flour:  I checked Chef John's blog and the amount of flour called for there is "8 oz by weight (about 1-3/4 c.)".  Anyway, just fyi.

Best scones I will ever have the pleasure of eating. Had to use whipping cream, as that's all I had. Added zest of one orange and dried cranberries. Also sprinkled a bit of sugar on top of the egg wash before baking and it gave them a lovely crust. I deleted all other saved scone recipes. This is 'the one'.

I had never tried making scones before, so I was pleased to find that these were easy to make. I didn't have and dried currants, so I made these with what I did have: chocolate chips. I used a hand- held mixer to cut in the butter. I prepared these the night before, then popped them in the oven the next morning (left them in the fridge over night). I didn't use the egg wash on top, but did sprinkle some sugar on top. They turned out amazing, and will continue to make these! :)

Sooooo good! Instead of adding currents I rolled the dough out, spead a thick layer of jam on half the dough then folded the other half of the dough over the jam giving me a nice fruit filling in each scone once I cut them into squares.

These scones were great!  I didn't have currents so I added a tablespoon of grated lemon peel.  They gave the scones a delicate lemon flavor.  I suppose that if you wanted a stronger lemon flavor you could substitute the sour cream with lemon yogurt.  I'd make these again!

You can make this recipe gluten-free! I don't handle wheat very well, so I used one of the boxed gluten-free flour blends from the grocery store. Since I didn't have any currants on hand, I used scraps from my cupboard - chocolate chips and unsweetened coconut flakes. The scones turned out moist, soft, but not too dense or heavy. I also enjoyed how they are lightly sweetened, but not dessert-y. They are wonderful - I'm saving this recipe to make again.

so good, with just hint of sweetness, even better than Starbucks! 
made exactly as recipe, only omitted the salt since used salted-butter.  like to fill w/fresh fruit (blue&strawberries) or even jam for more moist scone.  double recipe- we eat like muffins

Great recipe - looks a lot better in person than the picture this recipe shows, all golden and moist. I use 1 1/2 tsp of finely cut orange peel in lieu of the currants. Perfect for a sunny morning, and they stay moist if you freeze them fresh, so you can even sleep in, THEN eat scones for breakfast. Nom!

These are the best scones I have ever made. I liked the other scones but after I made these I was sold on this recipe. I didn't use the currents because I didn't have any and probably wouldn't have used them if I had but other than that I made them exactly as the recipe stated. The Brits may snub this recipe but you can't deny that they are lighter, tastier and have the best crust of any homemade scone. The first time my husband tried these he said that they were the best biscuits I have ever made and please only make these from now on. LOL. And he dearly loves biscuits.

This is a fantastic recipe.
The only thing I did differently was substitute in yogurt instead of sour cream, used raw sugar, and put in my own toppings. I used cranberries, chocolate chips, and for some I mixed in green tea powder to give it such a flavor. 
They turned out wonderfully, and i'll definitely be making these again. :')

This is my first review on All Recipes...I watched Chef John's video twice and followed his instructions exactly handling the dough as little as possible, brushing the tops with the egg and milk wash before baking. I worked in a third cup of golden raisins because that's what I had. My husband commented on the golden tops and has already eaten a couple. This recipe is going into my file...thank you, Chef John for a great recipe!

Followed the recipe first time and they were really good.  I added more butter next two times and they came out even better.  Will make many more.

This recipe is delicious. I did not have currants. I used pomegranate flavored cranberries instead. Soooo good. I will make this often.

As usual, you can't go wrong with a Chef John recipe.   I used frozen blueberries instead of dried fruit and that may have made it a little bit more difficult to work with - maybe adding more moisture?  Relatively easy  to make though.  I'd definitely make it again.

Not usually a fan of scones always found them not to flavorful .   Like Chef John first time making them and just loved this recipe.  Took advise from previous review and grated frozen butter and made a few adjustments.  Followed recipe but added dry cranberries and 1 tablespoon of orange zest.  I also prepared the night before cut into triangles and placed on parchment paper on cookie tray and covered with clear wrap.  Removed from refrigerator ( wait about fifteen minutes before baking)brush with just milk and baked for exactly fifteen minutes.  They came out beautifully and taste amazing..

I LOVE this recipe!  I've made them at least 5 times and the recipe never disappoints!  Light, fluffy and so delicious!  I will never buy them in the store again.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I prepackage my dry ingredients in Ziploc bags ahead of time so I cut down my prep time.  I always have at least 2 Ziplocs on hand for when I'm in a hurry to make them in the morning.  The smell of them baking - yummy!

Amazing scones. 
I have to tell you -- I normally don't like scones! they're usually dry or hard -- but I was reading a book set in Ireland and suddenly I wanted a scone. So I found this recipe, and made them as the recipe instructed except no currants. Sooooo good! They are flaky and light and I didn't even need to add jam or anything. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was very simple and turned out great.  I followed the  recipe exactly (twice) and my husband gobbled them up.  I love some of the other reviewers suggestions on different flavor combinations and will try those next time.  Thank you!

Thank you Chef John.  Made these for New Years brunch and served with fresh strawberries. Yum!!!  The texture was AMAZING.  I didn't have unsalted butter so I just left out the 1/8th of a teaspoon salt.  I look forward to making again and maybe trying some of the variations (not that it is needed) others have listed.  FYI: I used 2% milk and light sour cream and still thought they were delish in case you're trying to cut a few calories here and there.

Nice and fluffy.  I added a bit more sour cream to mine and sprinkled sugar instead of a egg was on top! This is a keeper! Yummy.

Oh, these are really fantastic!  All I can do is echo all the other 5 star reviews.  I didn't have dried currants.  But being the mother of a few kiddos, I did have some Nestle holiday semi-sweet red & green morsels.  I used those and had some very festive scones.  I'm so excited to try the currants though in the next go around.  I can see these as a Sat. morning treat!

I have a Scottish heritage so I made this recipe to check it out. I loved the video too. I made it exactly the way it said except added blueberries. Even the picky boyfriend liked them. They were very light and good.

This was my first attempt at making scones. Scones that I have tried in the past from a local bakery were dry and dense so I was not a fan of scones.  These scones were light and with just the right amount of sweetness. My son who is the greatest critic of my baked goods said that they were "really good". I used dried cranberries because I didn't have currants. Will definitely make again!

I am not much of a baker - all too often, my attempts don't turn out well.  But we love scones, and I was determined to find a recipe that even I could handle.  This is it!  I watched the video and followed the recipe exactly, except for using Craisins, and these are easy and fantastic!  I wanted to make a second batch immediately with chocolate or cinnamon chips.

I made this w/ my young daughters (5 and 2) and they had fun doing it.  The scones came out delicious!  We weren't too exact with the measurements; had to add a bit more milk, but probably because we 'guesstimated' the 3/4 cup using a one cup measure (being lazy).  We also decreased the sugar since we were making cheese scones. (We omitted the currants).  The scones came out light and fluffy!  We would definitely make it again!

This recipe worked great and the scones were delicious!! The hardest part was getting the butter mixed in with the pastry tool, partly because I doubled the recipe so there was a lot of the dry ingredients and a lot of frozen butter to mix. I added dried cranberries and that worked great. Highly recommended!

These are the greatest scones ever and so soft and moist!! And I love how simple they are to make! I can see we can use this recipe for lots of varieties. We tried it with craisens in place of currants, vanilla Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and added 1 tsp of blood orange olive oil and they turned out fantastic. This is a new family staple food hehe

This recipe is truly a masterpiece.  This is now my go-to scone recipe. I subbed the currants for dried cranberries since I could not find any and I do not regret it!

I made these scones and added fresh raspberries and white chocolate chips! (A British twist). Turn out really moist, didn't even need to put butter on to eat.

A friend made it yesterday. The perfect scone! Moist and not dry, but still with a slight crumble texture. She used whole milk yogurt instead of sour cream.

Wonderful and easy.  I made the scones with dried cranberries (used more than recipe states - I like a lot of  cranberries) and as as special touch added zest of one entire orange.

Not only easy and delicious, but flexible in accepting tweaks. I added dried cranberries and dried Morency cherries to mine. My-o-My!

I made these as stated except I omitted the currants. For 8 scones, I only needed to bake for 12 minutes and they were light, fluffy and PERFECT!!

Easy Peasey! I melted butter and mixed with cream, milk, sugar and salt (rather than coarse mixing).  Easier to prepare and beautiful texture.

Sooooo goood! I was missing some good scones since studying abroad in England in college and was inspired to make some of my own. I didn’t have currants, so I skipped those, and they were still top notch. I made my own blackberry jam and improvised the clotted cream with regular old whipped cream (I’ll definitely make some next time though!) can’t wait to make these again.

These scones turned out wonderfully! I used sour cherries freshly picked and pitted from our own trees.  They were moist and soft on the inside and had lovely colour and crunch on the outside.
(Yes, I spell colour with a  u. :))

These were amazing!!  I tried to make scones in the past, but found them messy and hard to do.  And after all of the mess and hard work, they weren't really worth the effort.  These were tender, not too sweet and so, so good!!  My husband was so happy as he loves scones and I really didn't like to make them because of the mess and difficulty.  I did use dried cranberries and orange zest as I did not have currents.  Thank you Chef John, your recipes never fail me!!

Wow! Hands down the best recipe for scones ever! Used dried cranberries (I’m sure you can use any dried fruit) and they turned out beautifully! Thank you once again Chef John! Making them again now!

This will be my ‘go to’ scone recipe from now on.  It was moist, delicious, easy, did I say delicious?!?  I didn’t have currants so I didn’t use any.  Instead of sprinkling only sugar at the end, I sprinkled a mix of sugar and cinnamon.  Thank you for sharing! :-)

I've made these, slightly altered, many times for years. Always a hit. I make with chocolate chips and almond extract or frozen raspberries and sliced almonds. I skip the egg wash and sprinkle with course sugar on top. Also generally make as drop scones, because I always have to double or triple the recipe. So yummy.

I had trouble with volume measurements having used only weights for baking.  I used home-made yogurt instead of sourcream, but stuck to recipe otherwise.  That gave a slightly bitter tinge to the scone.  Having said that, this is the first time I've made or tasted scones and am very surprised at the texture.  They were crisp on top and soft and somewhat crumbly inside.  I'd expected them to be sweeter, and I may up the sugar a tad bit in my next trial, and use milk instead of yogurt.  I'm used to working with very moist doughs, so the pulling together and folding did not bother me as it did some of the other reviewers.  I had to increase the cooking time a bit since the scones turned out to be bigger than I expected; I do believe in weights! Overall, a very satisfying result!  Thank you Chef John!

Well Chef John, you never disappoint.  I had a hanging for a scone but haven't had much success in the past few years.  I wanted to try making them again so I watched your video and got my ingredients ready.  I didn't have sour cream so I used blueberry yogurt and dried blueberries.  I like a sweet scone, so I increased the sugar to 1/3 cup.  Man, the scones are addictive.  They were only a few minutes out of the oven before I dug in. 
Thanks again for another excellent recipe!!!!!

Very easy recipe and yielded great results.  I doubled up on the ingredients, since every Chef John recipe I made in the past was simple and tasty, yet elegant.  I did add 1 1/2 tablespoons of pumpkin pie spice, and increased the sugar by 1/4 cup for just a bit of added sweetness, and they came out great, especially passed the picky wife test!  Next time, I will be a purist and make “as is”.  I have plenty left over to share and am sure they will not last long!

Added more sugar, 1/3 C., as I like a slightly sweet scone. And will cut about 16  next time. They rise well and were just too big for me.  I don’t need a Starbucks-size scone at home. :) Will make again.

The only change I made was substituting dried cranberries for the currants, since I had the cranberries on hand. This is an excellent recipe. Scones turned out very tender and moist.

This was my first time making cream scones. I wasn’t sure how they were supposed to be when baked, so I had my sister try them. She said they turned out exactly how she likes them.  My 11 year old granddaughter said “ these are the best.” So I’ve made them 3 times in a week. I also made Chef John’s pumpkin scones and were delicious. Great recipe and wouldn’t change a thing.

Delicious and easy! I replaced 3/4 cup of the all-purpose flour with white whole wheat flour, reduced the baking powder to 3 tsp. because I live at a high altitude, and sprinkled the egg wash on top with sanding sugar. We added blackberries to some of the dough, too. I’ve been struggling to find a good scone recipe, but this is it!

I make these scones often and give the recipe, as written, four stars.  They have a light texture and are not dry, even the next day.   With the following changes, these scones get five stars from me:  1) Use golden raisins instead of currants;   2) Omit the egg glaze.  Instead, press coarse sugar into the top of the scones before baking.  The coarse sugar adds a bit of sweetness (don't need jam with these) and the top will remain crunchy even when cooled and days old.

Very easy to make! I used dried blueberries instead of currants. Also, instead of kneading it and folding it I spooned the batter onto a cookie sheet, and they came out great!

I added some lemon zest, raspberry bits & while chocolate chips (1/3 cup each) instead of the currants.  The baking soda made for a light tender scone.  If light and tender is what you like, this is a good recipe.  I prefer a more dense scone, so I'll keep looking.

This recipe is excellent. I used dried cranberries, the lower sugar brand and the scones were so good. The key is to work the dough as little as possible. I used a box grater to grate the frozen butter, the dough will be lighter  if you use frozen butter.

Easy and fast. You can have these prepped and done within 30 minutes. I have made these twice and they came out great both times. I used a food processor for the dry ingredients thru the butter. I use the shredder attachment for the food processor, and it mixes it really well w the flour. I just used a wooden spoon for the rest and worked quickly...and followed Chef John's method of laying it out, w some flour, and cutting it to size from there. Add whatever you like in there, and you can even add different ones per scone, which is what I do. Just add them on top. Also, one more suggestion is put raw sugar on the top...it makes a very tasty plain scone.

I’d never made scones before this. The recipe is simple and quick. I used raisins instead of currants.  

Update: I’ve just modified this recipe, using chopped pecans instead of currants, and I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Absolutely great. This recipe is quite versatile.

These turned out great and very easy to make.  I did use dried cranberries instead of raisins.  They were delicous.  I just finished one with a cup of tea.  I’m now going to have another.

I really love this recipe and make all the time! but betimes I won't have sour cute so instead I'll use Greek yogurt which seems to work just fine! I'll also use chocolate chips instead of dried currents just because who doesn't like a chocolate scones?

Frozen butter thinly sliced and a pastry cutter are the key. First batch with dried currants met with rave reviews.  Second batch with dried blueberries look spectacular. A keeper recipe.

I made this recipe the other day and while it's a decent scone base recipe, it didn't wow me. I may try a couple tweaks like adding a splash of vanilla or bit of lemon zest. I also failed to fold and turn the dough when making this recipe the first time; that may have been my mistake.

It came together just as in the video and it was delicious  I added chocolate chip morsels for the little ones & omitted currants. I also used half & half for extra richness. We ate ours w/jam so next time I  will not sprinkle with sugar. Brushing w/egg & milk before baking gave that it a lovely color.  Excellent!

I made these scones this morning and they are the BEST.  I also followed the recipe!!!  I had NO problems at all.  This is not my first time at making scones.  I've found that having a well-floured surface when turning out the dough makes it a lot easier.  I can imagine all types of variations in the future with this recipe.  Instead of the currants, maybe chocolate chips, or another dried fruit.  These scones are very tender.

For some reason i missed where it said to place the scones one inch apart.  I pressed the dough into a flat round, cut and baked. They came out under cooked in the center.  Second batch came out perfect when I followed directions.  My adds were craisins and chopped pecans.  This will be my go-to scone recipe from now on.

I used just stuff I had on hand, so instead of currants I used raspberry preserves, added some vanilla and cardamom. Light, fluffy, flaky, and aromatic, I topped them with some homemade clotted cream and can't stop eating them.

Wonderful recipe, easy and delicious. I baked half the recipe, froze the other half of the dough after cutting it out. The next day, I put the frozen dough out on the counter for 30 minutes to thaw, then baked. Fabulous! The scones baked up and were indistinguishable from the scones I baked immediately.

So light and fluffy, they were delicious. They were also very easy to make. I added 1/2t cinnamon and 1/2c blueberries instead of the currants. I  look forward to using this as a base recipe and trying other variations.

These cam eout beautiful! I can't believe I forgot to get a picture. I made them for my mom for Christmas because she has been missing scones since our tea shop closed a few years ago. My scones are no where near that good, but still tasted awesome. I was going to use raisins, but decided to use lemon zest and fresh blueberries. I purchased a scone pan just for this. It made 13 mini scones, so I had one for tasting. It was moist, not sure how to describe the texture, maybe like a light cake, was not heavy or biscuity. They came out a beautiful golden color due to the egg wash. I will definitely make these again! My mom loved them!!

Not bad...light.  Plain taste, really just a baking powder biscuit.  Was awesome as a carrier for some home made jam though.  I would make it again for the same purpose.  Very fast and easy to make.

I liked it very much.  Haven't had a Chef John recipe yet that I did not like.  I would say these scones were very light which is probably what most people prefer.  I do like scones a little heavier and and with crunchy outside so next, I'll try the raw sugar sprinkled on top.  With that said, I'm being picky.....very good basic scone and looking forward to trying again with some other adjustments.

Perfect. Bake exactly as described and they are tender and flavorful,  not hard like most scones. I cut a few scones small for my young boys and they baked faster...so keep an eye on them the first time.

My scones came out ok. It was hard to handle since it was sticky. I followed the recipe, though I did add a bit a cinnamon and vanilla to it. For the egg wash I forgot to add milk to the eggs. I hope to make them to perfection someday soon.

Great! I froze the butter as others suggested. I also added about 1/2 cup of fresh currants and orange zest which really made the flavors pop!

Went together very easily.  I don't like currants, so I used frozen strawberries and a little vanilla.  Delish.  Will save this recipe and make again.

Watch the video to get the technique of mixing and forming the dough.  I made several dozen for an afternoon tea - these were preferred by many.

I used foodprocessor and substitute the milk+sourcream with the same amount of milk+1tbs of lemon juice, simply just because i dont have any sourcream. 
Really easy to make, really simple ingredients, yet come out soooo good. Love it!

I tried this recipe using some citron and candied orange I had leftover from the holidays. I loved how light these turned out. They were not the typical heavy scones. I will definitely be using this recipe in the future! Thank you, Chef John, I have started trying more of your recipes and they turn out great every time!

Made this recipe this morning. This is hands down the best scone recipe I have tried, and I have tried quite a few! The only change I made was to add blueberries instead of currants. Family has all gone for the day and so have my scones! Nice crunch on the outside and soft inside.

I tried these scones after reading the recipe in the AllRecipes magazine. They were very easy to make and taste delicious. My picky 16 year old liked them too (actually ate the whole batch). The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars was that they were more soft like a bread rather than crunchy like a scone. But that could have been something I did. I will definitely make them again. Oh - and I used frozen blueberries that we had picked last season. Yum!

Wonderful, light and moist. I added lemon zest, orange extract and dried cranberries instead of currants and used orange flavored greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Also after I brushed tops with egg wash , I sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar.YUMMM!

My 12 year old daughter wanted to make these scones, so I gladly sat back and coached her!  The recipe was easy to follow, and had good results.  She added dark chocolate chips and walnuts instead of the currants.  The scones were soft and delicious!  The next time that we make these I will add a teaspoon of cinnamon, just to add more flavor. -Wanna Be Chef

Made these for the first time and my DH and I loved them. Didn't have currants so I left them out and they still were amazing. We had them with strawberry jam. Next time I will drizzle some icing over them. Love his buttermilk biscuit recipe too. Thanks Chef John!

Superb! Great on its own or use it as a base recipe and add various flavors each time (lemon poppy seed, blueberry, currant, butterscotch chips, raspberry, pumpkin).

Awesome! I have made these scones many times and they always turn out delicious. I usually use dried cranberries instead of currents. My kids and husband eat them right out of the oven but love to snack on them all day!

ANOTHER UPDATE!  I LOVE it. This last time I doubled the recipe to have enough to share.  I also substituted buttermilk instead of plain milk, just because I like the taste of buttermilk biscuits, and I liked it.  The other thing I did differently and am not recommending:  I patted the dough out thicker--probably closer to 3/4 inch before cutting into triangles (and I use a knife with a serrated blade for 'clean' cuts).  I was not as pleased with the thicker scones.  I prefer the thinner ones that are lighter in the middle with a crusty exterior (enhanced by sprinkling sugar on top prior to baking.)  As far as using dried fruits, I used dried cherries that I 'reconstituted' in a small bowl of water in the microwave.  I let them cool and poured off the 'juice.'  I much prefer the softer fruit than the dried fruit in these scones.  Going to try blueberries next. Have fun with this recipe!  I sure am!  Thanks again, Chef John!

This is a good basic scone recipe. I wanted cranberry orange so substituted dried cranberries for the currants. (I like a lot of fruit so increased the amount.) I added the zest of one small orange to the dry ingredients. Just before mixing in the wet ingredients, I squirted the juice from a wedge of the fresh orange over the dry ingredients for additional orange flavor. And I sprinkled coarse sugar over them after the eggwash before I put them in the oven.  Even though I've made scones before, I found the video very helpful.

These turned out beautiful.  Very crunchy on the outside but soft and fluffy on the inside.  These are not dense heavy scones they a lighter version.  I made them with cinnamon chips and they were delightful!

My family and I loved these scones! They were very light and moist. I used cherry craisins instead of currents. And we ate these with honey and it was a hit. They also baked perfectly in 15 minutes. We will definitely do these again!

Years ago, we lived next door to a professional baker who taught me how to make scones. I have been making scones on Sunday mornings now for years. I have ditched my old recipe, and replaced it with this one - the scones are tenderer and lighter. These have been a huge hit with the family! I did not make any changes - I make the scones exactly as listed. So far, we have had no bad results.

Chef John was right on the money once again. I made these exactly as the recipe is written and they were perfect and delicious. Saved some for my granddaughter because she loves scones. I got her hooked on scones made from scratch when she was 5 years old and now she always expects Grannie Cheryl (me) to make some for her. Thanks Chef John.

These scones are delicious! I didn't add the currants because I didn't have any.  I watched the video "How to make scones" by Chef John and did everything else exactly as he did.  He said to sprinkle some sugar over the top of the biscuits before baking them, and I think I put too much.  The scones are very sweet, probably because of all the sugar I added to the top.  Next time I will add less sugar to the top and probably add fresh blueberries yum!

Serve English style with a bowl of clotted cream and a bowl of strawberry jam.  Don't forget the cup of tea!  You can find clotted cream at most good groceries and, of course, at Whole Foods.

Tried making SCONES the first time about 8 months ago while I was flipping through cook books for a descent recipe for them. Then made them with Brown Sugar and Cinnamon. Hot is best.  I haven't seen any Currants and have an allergy to sour cream, but every recipe came with a challenge to add my own flavors. I used 1 cup pancake mix (Krustez or Bisquick which is what the recipe book said, So I used what I had available), 1 cup flour,  1/2 cup Brown Sugar and 1 Tbls of Cinnamon.
