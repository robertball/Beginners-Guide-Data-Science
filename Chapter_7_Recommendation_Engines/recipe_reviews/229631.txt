Yummy... These bars our easy to make and turned out excellent. They took about 20 minutes to bake in a 350 oven. I waited and added almonds to the remaining 1/3 oat batter and then crumbled the batter on top. My family loved these. Two thumbs up !!!

5 stars. I didn't use the sliced almonds and I will try a 1/4 tsp of almond extract in the fudge mix.  They were a hit!

Tasty bars.. made quite a bit more than 30. I used regular old fashioned oats and it came out fine. Vanished at church potluck!

These are to die for! The almond flavor isn't very strong, but I will definitely be making these again and again!!!
