First off, this is more of a side dish than a main meal. Either way, though, I wouldn't make it again. It wasn't bad, it was just rather bland. Bland even after I added more spice and lemon than the recipe recommended. Also added some curry powder. Nothing could really change the fact that it tasted boring.

I loved this recipe! When you pop the mustard seeds, be sure to have a lid handy to keep them in the pot. It turned out a little sticky, but the taste was great and it was even better the next day. Next time, I'm going to cook the rice and lentils separately so the rice won't be so sticky, and I will double the lentils to make it a more substantial main dish. Excellent recipe; thanks!

This is delicious; I've made it a dozen times now, and it's in my permanent rotation.  It's important to use lots of fresh lemon (add the zest, too, for brightness of flavor), and be sure to add it last.  Use a food processor to chop the carrots and beans--not just because it's easiest, but also because it chops the vegetables to the perfect texture. Add red pepper flakes or a pinch of ground ginger if you'd like some heat. This is a tasty, healthy side, perfect for pairing with any fish or chicken dish with citrus notes.

On the second day, I added a sprinkling of white truffle salt.
