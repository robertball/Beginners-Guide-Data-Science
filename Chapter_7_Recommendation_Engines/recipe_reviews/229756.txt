I started with one cup of sugar -- you can always add more after you've seeped the teabags, and then just heat it up again to melt.  All according to taste, of course.  Didn't garnish because I didn't have any mint, but this is a great sipping drink for a hot summer's afternoon!  I put it in a big jar and stuck it in the freezer.  Good stuff.
