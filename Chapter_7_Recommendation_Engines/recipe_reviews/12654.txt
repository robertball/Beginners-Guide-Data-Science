Hmm...much better served chilled.  Add a little whipped cream and the kids would definately love it!  I would rather make a cobbler that had a sugary, crumbly, top crust that would be served warm with ice cream.

I made this recipe for a church gathering this afternoon. It got absolute raves! I did alter it a bit...I took reviewers advice for more topping and added 1/2 cup more flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar and a few tablespoons more butter to the crumb topping and it was perfect! I also threw in about a cup of rhubarb I had in my freezer and some cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg on top of the apple/rhubarb mixture.  I used very tart apples and that, along with the rhubarb made the amount of sugar in the topping and the gelatin balance out just right.  Threw some whipped topping on top and it went up so quick my husband didn't even get any! I definitely will make this again and very soon.  Oh yes, I only had one small package of strawberry Kiwi Jello and one small package of Strawberry banana Jello. I was worried about that but you couldn't tell. Most people thought it was all strawberries and rhubarb. They didn't even know it was apples!

This recipe is really easy and good.  However, the recipe needs some doctoring.
I used the sugar free strawberry-banana jello, but I didn't really taste it.  it gave the dessert a nice color, though.
Also, I added a pinch of nutmeg and 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the topping.  As well, I split the sugar into 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  Both of those were on the advice of other reviewers.
Also, FYI, I used slightly tart yellow apples.  And i left the peel on.

I've made this recipe many times and it always disappears quickly.  There's many ways to serve it as well.  Just a note, don't attempt to drizzle any form of icing over it (even if for show) because the crust is extremely sweet.  I tried doing a light drizzle, and it made the sugar levels unbearable.

My roommate enjoys it when I serve it hot with icecream on top.  (When I do this, I usually make a little extra crumble topping to put on the "Stuff", just to make it hold the ice cream on top better).  My beau on the other hand likes it chilled.  I'm more of a room-temperature person myself, but it takes quite good all three ways.

I've tried other forms of jello flavors that are complementary to apples, but have found strawberry to taste the best.  Its a little more obvious with the other ones that the fruit is not really in there, but I've had dinner-guests gasp in disbelief when I told them that there were no actual strawberries in this recipe.

The hardest part to this recipe is preparing the apples.  Everything else is so easy that my cooking-impaired beau was able to make it.

It is fun for kids to help make as well, as they get to sprinkle the jello on top, as well as the topping.

This is a new favorite with my bunch!!  We have a huge apple tree in our yard and I can never use them all up without us all getting sick of pie and traditional apple betty.  We cannot get enough of this recipe though...a real keeper!

This was just ok. It flavored the apples nicely, but I really didn't think it was anything special. I'd much rather have regular apple cobbler, which was what this was close to.

I chose this recipe based on the reviews and YES it is great! My family loved it! I had bought a 3lb bag of bland Red Delicious apples and didn't want them to go to waste so I searched this site for something to do with them. Perfect! I suggest this for potluck dinners and special events. It makes a lot and is very sweet. Too big of a dessert for a family of 4.

Yummy!  This is great.  Very simple.  I substituted brown sugar for the white, and low-fat jello for the regular, and it turned out fine.  This tastes like a short bread-based strawberry/jello square that my  mom used to make at Christmas time years ago.  Thanks for sharing - this is terrific!

Needed something to use up some apples.  My boys decided that we should use grape jello.  It was very tasty.  I don't like it cold.  And I would double the topping, it is sooooo yummy.

I made this last night and it was pretty good, however this morning trying it cold from the refig. it tasted better. I felt that there was not enough of the topping, if I make it again I will add cinnamon and make more topping! Thanks for submitting...I just may try it again sometime!

Pretty yummy.. my husband and I both liked it but my 7yr old and 2yr old did not. Weird kids! I think it would be really good to add chopped rhubarb to it as well. sort of a faux strawberry rhubarb crumble if you will.

All I can say is WOW, WOW, WOW!  So simple yet delicious!  I thought I'd give it a trial run before the Big Day...Thanksgiving!  Now I know what will be on my table this Turkey Day and each year thereafter - Apple Stuff!  I did cut a few steps:  I used Comstock canned apples & cinnamon (2 cans)instead of peeling and coring the apples,  I sprinkled 1 box of yellow cake mix on top of the apple mixture rather than mixing the flour, butter & sugar.  I did pour melted butter on top of the cake mix before putting the dish in the oven.  It came out just yummy.    Thank you so much Michelle for this awesome recipe.  PS. the recipe DOESN'T say when or how much cinnamon to use or add.

Didn't have  regular Jello, had to use no sugar. Took advise of reviewers and increased flour for crumbs but decreased sugar.  Didn't have strawberry Jello only had cranberry, so I used that and added dried cranberries to my apples. My hubby loved it... Even with using cranberry Jello , he thought there were strawberries in it!  Added cinnamon to the crumbs.

We thought this was alright. The jell-o taste is very strong. I think it needs more topping, and half brown sugar would probably help the flavor. It's good if you have some tasteless apples to use up because the jell-o adds so much flavor.
