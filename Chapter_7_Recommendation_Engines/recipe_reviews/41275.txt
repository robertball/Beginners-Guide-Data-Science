This recipe was very tasty, but.....I used frozen cubed potatoes and onion salt instead of fresh onion, also, I put sredded cheddar cheese on the top. Next time I will use regular peices of bacon instead of crumbled.

Good but time consuming to shred the potatoes. I'm happy with the final product but the entire time I was thinking to myself "why aren't I using frozen hashbrowns?" But I guess that might defeat the purpose of this fresher tasting recipe.
