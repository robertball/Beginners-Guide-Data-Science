I didn't have chocolate chips, so I made it without and it still turned out awesome! Per other reviews I cooked for less time (8mins) and rolled them in powdered sugar before baking. They turned out yummy! Even my husband who isn't a fan of chocolate said he thought they were really good with a positive emphasis on really. Enjoy!

This is one of the best cookie recipes I've found on the site. Very chocolatey and delicious! Easy to make, and taste great. Might use white chocolate chips next time for some visual flair.

Based on all the positive reviews, I doubled the recipe. So glad I did! They were delicious! I was concerned when I read a review say they were crumbly, messy and didn't hold together. I scooped them onto the cookie sheet with an ice cream scoop and didn't have any of those issues. Thank you! This recipe will be a regular in my baking.

This is a good recipe. Easy to make and nice chocolate flavor.  A little crisp on the outside and soft inside.  We'll do these again. Definitely.

Simple basic chocolate cookie. Doubled the recipe. Only changes were 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening. I didn’t have chocolate chips, so I chopped up some semi-sweet chocolate to make chocolate chunks. Baked convection oven 8 minutes, then let rest 5 minutes before transferring to cooling rack. Yummy. Will be easy to modify with different chips, or maybe roll in powdered sugar.

These cookies were delish! We sprinkled powdered sugar over them once they were done, and they tasted chocolatey and had a nice, chewy texture. The reason they aren't 5 stars is because the dough was very crumbly and dry, it took a while to shape them. They kept falling apart. This recipe needs an extra egg or more butter to make it more wet and keep it together.

These were very chocolately and I didn't even use chips too. I had to make cut outs and decorate them so I kept them smooth. I thought maybe could have used 1 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 to make a tad sweeter but that is the only criticism. Other than that they were the best recipe like this I've found.

These cookies are easy to put together, bake up beautifully, and taste delicious.  Plus I love that the recipe is scaled down and doesn't make too many. I got 18 decent sized cookies out of this recipe.

These were okay. Not terrific and not as chocolatey as I expected. I doubt I’ll make again-still searching for a really good chocolate cookie.

Didn’t spread out as much as I expected, but still turned out great!! Kid and husband approved. And a small batch is perfect so we don’t over indulge for a change

Did not add the chocolate chips, but other than that I stuck to the instructions. It was a great recipe. Very chocolatey. Defiantly a recipe worth having on hand.

Awesome! Best chocolate cookies on this site! Cook them 2 minutes less than recommended and they turn out great. They taste just like a fudge brownie! So chocolaty and soft. These are a definite one to make!

Delicious!  Very easy to make and very chocolatey. I scooped the dough with a cookie scoop and that was easy. Baking them for the recommended time seemed to be a little too long in my oven. Next time I will take them out a little sooner, maybe at 9 minutes.

Love these! Some changes I made:
Added salted caramel chips instead of chocolate chips because I had them on hand, I reduced the baking time to 8 1/2-9 minutes, doubled the recipe (so it made 30 cookies), and I cut the sugar a little. 
They were also quick and easy. I am definitely going to be making these again.

I added:
2/3 C cherry flavored chips
2/3 C chopped nuts

The mixture was thick so I rolled walnut sized balls, slightly  flattened them and  baked for time suggested.
They turned out GREAT!
Thanks, Sue B.

I tried this recipe because the reviews said it was easy.  Not only is it easy , these cookies are delicious. My daughter who is not really a cookie person loves these cookies, they have become her favorite. I have made these cookies a few times and every time they come out good.  This one is a keeper

Made a double batch and used 1 cup flour & 1 cup almond meal/flour. Didn't have any chocolate chips but they still came out delicious especially if your craving chocolate and want to whip up something fast. So good! Chewy, chocolaty and a little healthier!

These are great!  I didn’t have chocolate chips, but was dying for chocolate.   I rolled balls of dough in sugar, and baked for 9 1/2 minutes on parchment paper.   Chewy in the middle and crisp inn the edges.  Perfectly simple, and simply perfect!

These cookies are heavenly! The only thing that didn't work so well is that when i was mixing the two mixtures, my mixer was having a hard time mixing it. Other than that these are one of my personal favourites.

Just what a cookie should be!  Moist and chewy inside, crispy outside.  Love the rich cocoa flavor.  Added an extra tablespoon of butter, 1/4 c. brown sugar, and substituted chopped walnuts for the chocolate chips. They tasted just like chocolate walnut brownies without the heaviness.  Easy and awesome!

Outstanding. Incredibly chocolate and I left out the chocolate chips because I didn't have any. Didn't need them. Very messy but very easy.

Very tasty.  I used crisco instead of butter and no chocolate chips.  I sprinkled crushed nuts on some and shredded coconut on others with some sugar - just using what I had in the house.  Turned out great!

I made the recipe as it was written and the cookies came out great! I used dark cocoa powder and omitted the chocolate chips and it turned out great. I used the Kitchen Aid and whipped the batter a bit and they turned out soft and chewy inside and a nice firm outside. they almost remind me of a hybrid brownie. I will definitely make this again.Using the convection oven at 375 I was able to cook these cookies in about 8 minutes, rotating the cookie sheet halfway through.

Great recipe, easy and fast. I can't deal with waiting for dough to cool in the fridge, need cookies now! I left out the choc chips because I don't like them and really like the delicate cocoa-chocolate flavor of the cookie on its own plus its a great base for adding pretty much anything else you might like. Consistency is cookie perfection, crispy and cracked on the outside soft on the inside. I made a quick glaze with caramel sauce, powdered sugar, milk and vanilla then topped with a pinch of pink Himalayan sea salt. 5 stars because I will use this again and again, already planning different flavors for each holiday...

I substituted 1/2 the butter with unsweetened applesauce and you couldn't tell,  they were the consistency and flavor of a really great chocolate cake in a cookie size. Topped with whipped cream, this made 12 2"-3" fluffy, soft, heavenly  cookies!
