This was a great creation, but it did need modifications for my taste.  First, I used a  pot since I feel that stews need to sit and cook slowly for optimal flavor and tenderness.  Second, since I am not a beer drinker, I used about 1 and a half bottles, and not the entire 2.  To go with the theme of the season, I used Samuel Adams October-fest Ale.  Second, there was something missing from flavor, so to jazz it up a bit I added a few beef bullion packets and a 1/2 of cup of Worcestershire sauce - that perfected it for me for flavor.  Finally, I agree with most of the other posters that it was not thick enough and too soupy so I did thicken it with some cornstarch - that was it!  I will make this again, but with the additional modifications I did.  :)

This was very good, but hubby didn't care for it. Lots of yummy veggies, but the beer added a bitter after taste - maybe a less bitter beer would help (I used the recommended type). It never got the consistancy of "stew" it was more like soup. I had to add several tablespoons of cornstarch and it got a little thicker... I felt like it was missing something to "finish it". Not sure what that is, yet...

Excellent taste!  I didnt use the bacon drippings, but rather used good olive oil to save the calories/fat.  I also forgot the celery, but I didnt notice at all. This stew was YUMMY!

I tried this recipe using in a crockpot. I marinated my meat overnight in a combination of beer, worchestershire, soy sauce and garlic. I've been looking forward to it allllll day (the aroma has filled my house for hours) and now i'm a bit dissapointed. It's way too sweet. I didn't know how to fix that so I added worchestershire and that made it worce! It's definatley edible but I think where I went wrong was in the deglazing step. I went ahead and added the vinigar and sugar and scrapped the reminants from the meat, added some of the broth to that and then dumped the mixture in with everything else into my crockpot. I think in the recipe the sweet mixture should have been absorbed by the veggies as was not the case in  my version. ALSO i didn't add all the beer because of the other reviews and the beer i did use i think was to sweet. I think it needs a dark beer.

I liked the addition of parsnips and even used some leeks since I didn't have enough onion on hand.  I didn't add the beer since so many stated it was more like a soup.  I did use a splash of red wine just because.   It was delicious.  The whole family enjoyed it.  I will make it again and not add the beer.
