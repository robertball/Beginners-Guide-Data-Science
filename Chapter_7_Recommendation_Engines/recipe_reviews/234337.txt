Very delicious! Add 12oz jar of lemon curd or lemon pie filling! Pour 2/3 of the batter into the bundt pan, pipe lemon curd as close to the middle of the batter as possible. Then add the rest of the batter on top of the curd/pie filling layer to cover batter. Bake according to directions.

This recipe was so easy and it's one of those recipes that every ingredient is usually on hand in your pantry.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't add the poppy seeds, as they were optional.  This cake would be excellent with fresh strawberries on top!  Hummmm....

Great recipe. To make recipe healthier, substituted greek yogurt for sour cream and apple sauce for vegetable oil. Frosted with the following recipe: Beat 2 small containers Cool Whip, 1C half and half and 2 small containers instant lemon pudding mix for 1 minute at low and 2 minutes at high speed. Cut cake in half, frost middle and top layers.

Like another reviewer said, I don't know why this doesn't have more reviews- this was easy and absolutely amazing. The only changes I made were not using lemon extract (because I didn't have it; I used a touch of vanilla extract instead). I also glazed the cake (2 T Melted butter, 1/3 cup lemon juice, 2 c powdered sugar). SO good, the perfect amount of tart balanced by sweet. Loved it, thank you!

I made this today. No problems with dryness whatsoever. I added blueberries from my local Farmer's market, which i folded in at the end. Confectioner's sugar glaze on top. Fresh blue and raspberries to top it all off! Thank you for this strong foundation recipe that allows a baker to be a little creative and add my own ideas to!

This was unbelievably good. My teen daughter kept saying, "I can't believe you made this! It seems like a gourmet cake that you bought." It was very moist and perfectly lemony.  I didn't have lemon extract so I had to leave that out. I also glazed it with a glaze someone else posted in the reviews for this recipe (2 T Melted butter, 1/3 cup lemon juice, 2 c powdered sugar).  I am making it again tonight for a potluck.

I love lemon cake(lemon anything) and desired to find an easy recipe for a MOPS breakfast so I decided to try this and WOW!! this was DELICIOUS!!! Here are a few adjectives to describe: decadent, moist, flavorful and simple to make. I didn't make any changes(I make changes to recipes when they fail me) and this doesn't need any tweaking whatsoever. I actually have to say it's amazing and I went back for a second slice;) I received rave reviews and encouraged to make it for a bake sale. I hope you decide to try it

I made this lemon cake in two, round pans and iced it with a butter lemon frosting, and served it for a birthday celebration. I didn't have any lemon extract or poppy seeds, so omitted those ingredients, and added a little bit more lemon juice (freshly squeezed, of course!). It was fabulous and got rave reviews from everyone there. Moist, delicious, authentically lemony. I can't believe it doesn't have more reviews on it yet, but I was very impressed. Took very little time to assemble

I made this today for my husband's birthday and everyone loved it!  I didn't have sour cream so I substituted greek yogurt left out the lemon extract and Poppy seeds!  I still gave it 5 stars because lemon extract and Poppy seeds wouldn't make a difference.  Rater Ellie mentioned the box sizes have changed in recent years and wondered if you needed to make adjustments? I did not, i used a 15.25 Duncan Hines and everything turned out delish! As an experiment I placed my Bundt Pan in about 2 inches of Water while it cooked! I was concerned how that greek yogurt was going to work.  My cake was very moist.  Next time I will try without the water bath and see if the moistness changes! Also, i made a powdered sugar and lemon juice glaze with lemon zest! Which is my go to glaze for any lemon cake! This will be my new lemon cake recipe which replaces the one I have sworn by for the past 25 years. I have a Meyer Lemon tree so I'm not sure how the taste is while using your basic lemon which is tarter than a Meyer!

It disappeared at a potluck and I tried a slice - very lemony and delicious. I made it in a tube pan and poured a lemon glaze over top (melted butter, icing sugar, lemon juice, a bit of zest). Generally I don't use mixes but this cake is a keeper.

Best lemon cake ever, though I added almost a half cup of water, drizzled fresh lemon juice in the top after making little holes with a toothpick, and iced it with powdered sugar mixed with lemon juice. Also added blueberries, optional.

This recipe sounds fantastic so I gave it 5 stars. However, I haven't tried making it. My reason is that it's no longer possible to find any brand of cake mix that weighs 18.25 oz., which means the amount of the other ingredients called for are going to be thrown off. Betty Crocker and Pillsbury mixes, that used to be 18.25 oz., are now 15.25 oz. Duncan Hines is now 16.5 oz.

Tried this for the first time today.  I made it for a neighbor who had just lost his father.  I followed the directions exactly and it looked and smelled yummy?  I too, used to make the lemon bundt cake recipe on the side of the lemon cake mix.  This should be much more "lemony"...  Should also be more moist with the addition of sour cream, etc.  As far as the different sizes in the cake mixes goes, I had never noticed (how observant of me) and have been continuing to make recipes that call for a mix with no ill effects.   Thanks for, what looks to me, like it will be my new favorite lemon cake!!!  I also sprinkled powdered sugar over the whole cake to make it look a little more special...

This is the best lemon bundt cake ever. I used to make the recipe on the side of the box of lemon cake. It's similar to this one in that you add lemon instant pudding; however it just was never lemony enough. The fresh lemon juice and zest really make this.

I have made this cake twice now, and the only "criticism" I might have is that the baking time is off, at least where we live.  I live at sea level, about 20 miles of virtually flat land between my house and the shoreline.  Both times I've made this cake, I had to add about 20 minutes to the baking time.   I know my oven isn't the problem because I had it checked when we moved into this new house and I made my husband check it again afterward.  It is a convection oven and bakes very evenly. In spite of having to bake it longer, the cake came out moist and DELICIOUS!  Just love it!

This is an amazing lemony cake! I love anything lemon! I followed the recipe as directed, except I live at high altitude so I added 1/4 cup plain flour to adjust. I didn't have any lemon extract so I used vanilla. I baked it for 1 hour (again high altitude adjustments) I had some left over cream cheese icing that I melted in the microwave and used as a glaze. I took it to a luncheon at work, there wasn't a single crumb left and everyone wanted the recipe! I will be making this again for sure!

I always love this cake and so does everyone who tries it. I made it from the recipe, without poppyseeds. I also whipped up a container of whipping cream and added a package of lemon pudding to the whipping cream to make a frosting. You would think that it would be too much with such a rich cake but, it’s perfect.

I'll definitely make this one again.  Frustrating, though, that food manufacturers are shorting everything.  For example, I used a Duncan Hines cake mix.  The recipe calls for an 18.25 oz. pkg., but mine was 15.25 oz.  The pudding was supposed to be 3 oz., but mine was 2.75 ozs.  In baking, this does make a difference!  I added 1/2 cup flour (King Arthur all-purpose) and a tad more sour cream to make up for being shorted on my ingredients.  Instead of lemon zest and the lemon extract, I used a tablespoon of TrueLemon (a crystalized lemon powder I found at the store).  It's a forgiving recipe and very good!

Made this twice. I must be missing something because it doesn’t have a cake-like texture at all. It’s like a sponge almost.

If anyone else, like me, accidentally purchased cook and serve pudding instead of instant, I’m here to tell you it all works out. I excluded lemon zest and swapped lemon extract for vanilla because I didn’t have either in hand. I did 325 for 50 in a nonstick bundt pan (for no other reason than I was remembering a different recipe) and the cake baked to perfection and tastes great.

Made this twice.  During cooling the cake collapsed around the middle, both times.  So disappointing.  
But the flavor and the texture turned out good.  I just ended up with half cakes.   I'll go back to Nordic ware's recipe.

I kept it exactly the way the recipe said.  I had problems putting a glaze on it, one that I made, but I think that's because I put it on when the cake was still warm.  I made five different desserts for Christmas, and this was the only one that everyone wanted a piece of.

This is so easy and the lemon flavor pops! I use Meyer lemons, and sometimes plain yogurt or sour cream, depending what I have on hand. It is so delicious that no glaze is necessary when the cake is finished.

Wonderful, very moist cake. My husband and I were first class oinkers!!!!
Everytime we went into the kitchen we would slice a piece off. We ate it in 2 days. Rich, doesn't require frosting.

This was fantastic!!! I could not have been more pleased with this recipe. I changed nothing. Better then any I have bought at a store or Starbucks. It was moist and very lemony!! I made a simple glaze of 2 cups powdered sugar, lemon juice and 1 teaspoon lemon extract. Great recipe!!!

Absolutely YUMMY.  Followed recipe exactly. My hubby loves it, says it's better than the one you can buy at KFC. Will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was really good. I didn't have a lemon cake but used a yellow cake mix and it still turned out VERY lemony. It got rave reviews at the potluck I took it to. It was very dense like a pound cake. I used the lemon cream cheese frosting on here with it.

I followed the recipe as is minus the lemon extract and poppy seeds. However, upon removing the cake from the oven, it began to deflate. Once cooled it was a third of the height of a normal bundt. Very strange. I couldn't serve to my guests. My husband and I only got through 2 slice before we decided it wasn't worth the calories to eat the rest. I probably won't try to doctor a boxed cake again.
