This was actually pretty good - I left out the flour and the water and added 2tsp lemon juice and made a paste-like batter. I cooked it in a frying pan with a little olive oil. Stuffed it in a pita with tzatiki and fresh tomatoes! YUM!

I had my doubts about this recipe, but I had some tahini and about-to-expire tofu that I wanted to use up. I should've trusted my instincts because I did not care for this at all.

I was intrigued by this concept despite the many negative reviews it received. I decided to give it a try with a few modifications. I used about 6 table spoons tahini instead of 4. I used 2 whole eggs instead of whites only. I used a table spoon of oyster sauce as well as soy. I used up some corriander we had in the fridge. I cut the amount of liquid by half and cut the water with a generous amount of balsamic vinegar. I used white flour since this was what we had on hand. I also added some salt and red chili flakes. I dipped thin slices of extra firm tofu in the batter, leaving some in the bowl. Half way through baking, I poured on the rest of the batter. I baked for 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  My partner and I thought this version tasted great.

The first time I made this it was very bland and didn't brown very well in the oven. This time I added some garlic and onion salt for a little more flavor. I marinated the tofu in the mixture and then fryed it with some olive oil. I put the browned tofu into a baking pan with cubed potatoes and some dill and more garlic. I baked this for about an hour and a half- until the potatoes were crispy and it really is a lot better. It was pretty much an experimentation :)

I gave this a try & baked it.  It looked ok going into the oven, but I ended up having to bake it for 45 min (!) and it still didn't really brown. Also, it was pretty bland.  Sorry - not a keeper.

I took a lot of liberties with this recipe based on the previous reviews, and unfortunately it was still pretty bland. It might be quite tasty if you were to use peanut butter (the real stuff) instead of tahini. I rolled mine in sesame seeds before frying and had it in a wrap with tzatziki and tomatoes which wasn't bad... but I don't think I'll make this again.  Sorry!

Straight up, this wasn't great...  The flavor was not there! The batter wouldn't stick to the tofu. So I mixed together everything except the flour. I soaked the tofu in the wet mixture and then coated it in the flour. Then I ended up frying it in a pan until it was lightly fried. Still came out totally tasteless (not TOTALLY but not anything much). I'm throwing these fried tofu cubes in a pad thai dish. Ooohhh ya and I also used 2 whole eggs.

This is very tasty and good for someone who may not like tofu.

Man, I tried everything the reviews suggested to make this better, and it was still bland. I don't know if there's any saving this one. It wasn't "bad", but it also wasn't good. I'm glad this wasn't the first time I fed my husband tofu.

I pan fried the tofu instead of baking and it was ok.  I think next time I will add something to add some heat to it.  I thought it was rather bland.
