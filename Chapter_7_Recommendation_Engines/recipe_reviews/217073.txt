I doubled this recipe, used my own whole wheat pancake mix, and used buttermilk instead of water. Because my mix was whole wheat, I did need a little more liquid than what was called for so I added a half cup extra buttermilk for a double recipe. I used a really great no sugar berry blend that I bought at Walmart (it's actually the Walmart brand). I just kind of guessed on the cup-age that was the strawberries and just poured what I thought was right of the berry blend to equal twenty strawberries (again, double recipe). I didn't bother sprinkling the pancakes with sugar, that seemed unnecessary to me and the recipe did say it was optional. This was quite good, my husband didn't even complain that the pancakes were whole wheat this time! This was very easy to make, I was able to make them a little healthier and use more homemade ingredients and less sugar, which I appreciated. Out of a double recipe, two pancakes remain. My boys really liked these!

I used fresh, not frozen berries, and made my own gluten free pancake mix.  My pancakes could have used more moisture (when using different than wheat flour, that can be expected!), but the flavor was excellent!  These are easy to make!

so easy and perfect to make!  I used pancake mix, water, and an egg.  Once finished we added a little cool whip and ate them like roll-ups.
