These potatoes are delicious!  I had to use a yellow onion (I didn't have the shallot that I purchased!  Rats!  The second time that's happened that it didn't make it home from the store with me!).  I'm not sure that the added expensive dried mushrooms were totally worth the taste because the others would have been just fine.  I did use the herbs as described in a recipe here on this site.  Be careful not to burn the potatoes---cook them on a low heat and consider covering them to speed up that process so the butter doesn't overheat.  These are delicious, and I'd really recommend that you use creme fraiche (use Chef John's recipe here on this site if you have time).  Definitely company worthy!  Thanks so very much!  Yum!

These. Are. Awesome. One of the best potato dishes I have ever made. And they're made with all wholesome ingredients, too! I made a couple minor changes - didn't have a shallot so I used a regular onion and couldn't find the dried mushrooms but my 6 oz. package of mixed mushrooms had more than 2 cups so I used the whole package. I also mixed my own herbs de Provence by using a recipe on this site. My chicken stock was also homemade. Delicious!

These were amazing!  I can't wait to make them again.  The sauce was so flavorful and really enhanced the potatoes.  The creaminess from the creme fraiche set these over the top.  These will be a regular dish for our house from now on.

Absolutely phenomenal dish!  Couldn't find dried mushrooms anywhere so I added a bit more fresh ones to compensate.  I also used minced white onion instead of the shallot but otherwise followed to a 'T'.  I was hesitant on the mustard, but combined with the thyme and the cream it really made the dish pop.  This is not a fast or quick dish, but for anyone who loves mushrooms/potatoes, this is it!  This is definitely a dish to use to impress someone!  It'll work, trust me!

I really enjoyed this recipe as well as the family. Made this with all fresh mushrooms and heavy cream. What a simple side dish! I've also made just the mushroom sauce for mashed potatoes, a nice change up from the standard gravy. Definitely love this recipe.

This is a five-star-restaurant-worthy side.  I used all fresh mushrooms and didn't miss the dried (but they may have added texture?).  I used homemade chicken bone broth and heavy cream instead of the creme fraiche.  This will be made again and again!

An elevated potato side dish that's worth the trouble to make. I substituted Lactose-Free Whole for the cream. Yum! Yum!

We absolutely loved this dish!  Used heavy creme and didn't realize until the last minute that I was out of dried mushrooms so those were missed.  It was so good, thank you so much for sharing.

Delicious, I love mushrooms and potatoes. I used fresh and dried mushrooms as well as vegetarian chicken flavored broth. This was a big hit with the whole family, 5 stars.
