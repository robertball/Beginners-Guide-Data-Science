I made this for Memorial Day and made four times the amount of marinade for some drumsticks, chicken thighs, and split chicken breasts.  I used chili sauce instead of ketchup as many others did.  Definitely marinate overnight and turn serveral times during the process to coat.  I also used a homemade BBQ sauce during the grilling process and we didn't have much left at the end of the party!

This was just plain tasting. My husband says the chicken would have been spicier if I had just used BBQ sauce. I used chili sauce instead of ketchup. I'm glad I did or else the tomato taste would have really ruined it. It's not bad but just not that good either. It would need some work to make it worthwhile.

This was a nice marinade.  I would rate it a "4", but Mr. LTH deemed it a "5" and I always round up, so "5" it is!  I poured the marinade over fresh BLSL chicken chunks, the froze & thawed when we were ready to grill camping.  They were good, there was just a bit of a flavor that I didn't LOVE, but I can't pinpoint where it came from.  Perhaps the ketchup?  TY for a nice alternative chicken marinade, we do get tired of the same old same old!

This is a great recipe for kabobs alternated with pineapple chunks.  I cut meat in 1" chunks and then marinated just over 24 hours.

I agree with the teaser line on this - nothing too fancy.  It is a nice marinade - not too strong, but a nice flavor.  It's perfect for when you want extra chicken for other uses in the week.  Our plans changed, so I ended up baking these instead of grilling, and they were very good.  I'm sure it would be even better when grilled.  I'll make it again.

Marinated chicken a couple of days for maximum flavor absorption.  Needed something more to make it a 5, but not exactly sure what.

Very good flavor.  I wasn't able to marinate it overnight only for about six hours, but it was still very good.  I did use the red chili sause instead of ketchup as suggested by another reviewer.  My family really enjoyed it.

I tried this recipe on Memorial day and it was wonderful! I tried something different. Instead of grilling  the chicken breast,  I smoked them in my smoker and, like  I  said, it was  wonderful.  Just remember to  marinate  the  breast  for at least  8 hours  before  smoking.

Made this for Memorial Day 2018 and earmarked it for lots of future use!   Instead of brown sugar, I had to use an artificial sweetener.  I also added some dried, diced onions and about 1/4 cup of water.  My husband told me that this one is a keepie!

I love this recipe. I added about 2 tbsp of already prepared bbq sauce just because I had never made BBQ from scratch. I'm sure I would not have needed to add it, though. It was so good. The chicken was so tender.

Simple and easy meal with things I had in the house! I did switch it up a bit into a quick Mommy BBQ! I kept all ingredients the same  but instead of marinating, I threw everything into a slow cooker and cooked on high for 4.5 hours for 3 large breasts. Chicken was literally falling apart (which is awesome for my littles) and I topped with more BBQ sauce. Family was raving!

I marinated overnight.  Thought that it tenderized the chicken too much.  If I make it again, I will reduce the amount of marinating time.  The flavor was very good.

Nice basic marinade. I will try a stronger cajun spice blend next time.. or more.. I marinated for a couple of days
