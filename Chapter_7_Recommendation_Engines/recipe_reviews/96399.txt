I thought it was great, but needed a little more liquid so we added some salsa and a little of the liquid from the tomatoes.

This recipe is awesome!!! I skipped the coriander, oregano and marjoram.  Not for any reason, just because I felt like it.  I like certain spice a lot so I tend to over use them.  I don't measure, and I like my chili really spicy.  I also had to cover up the whiteness of the turkey to trick my 14 year old daughter with the spices and it worked.  She loved it!  She still doesn't know it was turkey.  I added a ton of chili spice, cumin, cayenne pepper, and chipotle.  Sooooooo good!

Good recipe, but this is more like a casserole than a chili.  There is too much meat and not enough beans and veggies.  Also, I left in all the tomato juice and there STILL wasn't anything to "boil for 30 min."  Is there a mistake in the recipe?  Overall, I'd make it again, but use half the meat, twice the beans, and add a LOT of water.

This recipe smells wonderful even BEFORE you cook it.  The spices blend together without losing their individual flavors.  The cinnamon offers a soft hint as you eat the chili.  The peppers, onion, garlic, chili powder, cumin will open your sinuses.  The cilantro makes everything taste fresh and lively.  This recipe is extremely easy and tastes extremely good.  Both my husband and I devoured it with tortilla chips and salsa.  A true 5-star recipe!

This recipe is perfection!  Best chili I've ever had.  Seriously.

I didn't change much at all, but I think it's important to use TWO cans of black beans.  One can just feels wrong.  

I also used a can of diced tomatoes vs a can of whole and then cutting up.  I'm all about shortcuts.

And I used 4 cloves of garlic...cos duh...garlic is awesome.

Just FANTASTIC!!! I doubled the recipe and added more of some things (onions & peppers) and some cayenne pepper.  It is the best chili recipe I have used so far.

This is the best tasting chili I've ever made. I used a can of Hunt's firery chopped tomatoes for that extra spicy kick. I also added a can of corn at the end to add the tex-mex flavor.

It tasted like turkey and beans, nothing too special. An OK dish to try though.
