A summer stand-by, but I had never thought to add the Old Bay.  Yummy!

This is so delicious. I usually make it with half zucchini and half squash. I add a little more Old Bay because I like spices. I use Olive Oil Spray and Part Skim Mozarella to cut the fat.

Goes well with any phase of South Beach.

I thought this was really good, but I added salt and think that I could have added more Old Bay Seasoning.

Very easy and very tasty recipe.  Pehaps we are biased because we are Old Bay addicts, but we really enjoyed this.  We used a blend of chedder and parmesan cheese, and it still turned out well.  Definitely make it again!

Yum!  Except I didn't use Old Bay Seasoning, as I didn't have any, and used basil, oregano, garlic salt.  One of my favorite ways to eat zucchini!

This was tasty. Instead of baking the cheese on top, I sprinkled a little on each portion. I really couldn't taste this cheese, so on subsequent portions I left it off. I liked the taste of the Old Bay. I might try this again with a cheese that has a stronger flavor.

Perhaps it's an East Coast/West Coast thing...because I think the Old Bay seasoning ruined the dish.  You gotta like that sweet, clovey, cardamom taste that Old Bay gives food. 

I think the Old Bay overpowered the vegetables.  Bummer, but just not for my family.  Next time, I'll omit the OB and try another milder seasoning blend.

Very good. I also used mushrooms, red and yellow bell pepper and fresh sweet basil with the zucchini. I drained it before adding crumbled Feta cheese. Company loved it! The Old Bay seasoning and Feta cheese complimented the bland zucchini. I gave it 5 stars. I guess the recipe isn't the original, but it is a great base recipe!

Great way to use those summer veggies!  Actually, I forgot to do the cheese part and it was really good.  Nice to have Old Bay on something other than seafood.  Very flavorful.  (Marylanders-add more Old Bay...your tollerence is high!)
