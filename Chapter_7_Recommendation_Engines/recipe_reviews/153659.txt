My family has made a similar dip recipe for years. As a child, I would take turns with my brothers & sister to make the next batch.  We used garlic & onion powder instead of the garlic salt.  We also added worchestershire sauce (to taste - not too much).  We usually used a couple large bricks of cream cheese & added milk until it was the desired consistancy. No measurments - everything to the taste.  We mixed all with a fork, but I use my stand mixer nowadays. Way better than store bought dips!

My family has been using a variation on this dip for years -- usually use garlic powder in addition to the garlic salt, and just add the milk & seasonings to your own taste/consistency.  Especially fabulous (and addictive) with Fritos (Scoops or regular) and/or veggies.  I usually don't make this large an amount -- one brick of cream cheese, two if I think I need a ton.  The cream cheese is best if room temperature or a little warmer; I sometimes pop it in the microwave to soften, and I like to use a whisk to blend, though my brother & mother make it in a blender.  I also sometimes add parsley to make it look fancier.

I have been making a variation of this recipe for years. Instead of milk I dilute beef bouillion in water and add to, room temperature, cream cheese. Mix in a blender for a creamy consistency. Spice as desired with garlic and/or onion powder, red pepper, cumin etc.

Yeah my families been making this dip since the 1700's so we eat it everyday and the recipe runs in our blood. But for real the best way to make this dip is to take 2 blocks of cream cheese, put it in a Cuisinart, mix in a little milk, and put about 4 scallions in because they're less bitter than onion. Mix it until it is the perfect creamy consistency, salt, and stuff.

Next time, I would definitely use either a whisk or pulse it with an electric beater. 
Even though I spent almost an hour beating it with a fork (it was at room temperature), this came out very lumpy and even though I used Light cream cheese, it was very oily. It didn't turn out as good as I thought it would!

I used an electric beater, and added dill and onion powder.  I love the simplicity and variability, but there's no way it should have that much milk.  I used half and it was just right.

i was looking for a similar dip my SIL makes. i added some paprika and hot sauce.  it made the appearance better i think. i tried this w/ corn chips as recommended but the hubs and i thought they overpowered it. we actually liked it better w/ saltines (weird, i know). this is better the next day so i would suggest making it 24 hrs in advance. next time i will use it for a veggie dip

Delicious! I added a few drops of Worcestershire sauce and only used one brick of low-fat cream cheese and this turned out great! Honestly, I think you could use any combination of your favorite seasonings to adapt it to your tastes and your chip flavor.

My family has been making this dip forever! We always use an electric mixer because its clumpy otherwise. The author says it gets "foamy," but that's not true if you soften the cream cheese and add the milk a couple of tablespoons at a time. I never measure the milk; just keep adding it until it's at the right consistency. I also use half garlic powder/half garlic salt to keep it from getting too salty. Embarrassingly difficult to stop eating when combined with potato chips!!!

Used the mixer and it's foamy.  THEN I read the footnote.  The footnote info needed to be first thing in the directions.  I didn't even use the amout of milk it calls for.

It's okay as a base recipe. I added quite a bit of Korean red pepper paste and a teaspoon of homey to give it some flavor. I also used soft cream cheese and less milk to make the process a bit easier.

I have been making this recipe for years.  If you soften the cream cheese first and add the milk 1/8 c. at a time, you can use the hand mixer, just beat until the foam goes away.  Also if you want a little less salt intake you can substitute some or all of the garlic salt with garlic powder.  It is great on hamburgers too :D !!!

I use 2 blocks cream cheese,  1/4-1/3 cup milk, 2-5 pressed garlic cloves (add min, adjust to taste after mixing). Mix with handheld mixer for 3-5 mins. I refrigerate it for at least one hour to let everything meld. Serve with thick chips wavy ruffles or lays,  fritos, etc. My son and his friends ask for this almost every weekend. You can also change it up with some of the other suggestions, but this is how my son loves it.

Old family favorite. We add finely chopped green onion however, and sometimes a little worchestershire sauce and seasoned salt. As others have said, just add the milk until right consistency.

I tweaked this..  I used about 3/4 cup skim milk..  stirring in 1/4 cup at a time. I used 2 teaspoons of onion soup mix and whisked it all together and topped with parsley. it was a hit! I will be making this again!

It was very easy, but it needed some more taste and color.  I sparingly put in garlic salt, adding dried minced onion to taste (I really didn't want it to be too salty).  Still, it was lacking something visually...I always have frozen chopped spinach on hand.  Since I made this recipe for only about 8 people, I cooked up a a small amount of the frozen spinach (about a 1/4 cup, drained)...added it to the dip and big improvement.  You can certainly tailor this recipe to your taste.  I'll be making this again.

Super quick and easy! Used garlic powder, salt and pepper, dried chives and a bit of fresh green onion. Totally delicious! It doesn’t take long to incorporate the milk into the cream cheese smoothly when you add the milk only a little at a time. Will make again

So I followed the recipe the recipe to a T and instead of dip I got soup. That is way too much milk that you were asking for. You might want to change your ratio of ingredients.

I used room temperature cream cheese, 3/4 the amount of milk and had to put it in my blender and pulse it because it was so chunky.  It was also way too soupy with even the amount of milk I used so I added 3/4 cup of flour which helped thicken it up. Not much flavor.

Easy!  I made one fourth of the recipe.  I added the milk a tbsp at a time, and added real garlic cloves.  Served with red and yellow bell pepper strips and cucumber slices.
