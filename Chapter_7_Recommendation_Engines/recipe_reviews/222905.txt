First, the toasted bread cubes/croutons are delicious enough to prepare for ANY salad.   In the future, when I have a piece of french bread left, it will be turned into these tasty croutons.  The italian bread at the store did not look great, so I switched to a loaf of crusty french bread which proved to be the perfect choice. This salad has the perfect balance of salty, sweet and tart.  One might think that the combination of strawberries and tomatoes is odd (I did), but when paired with those toasted bread cubes, salty feta cheese, and a flavorful drizzle of olive oil, honey, and red wine vinegar, WOW!  To say we enjoyed this salad is putting it mildly.  To say we LOVED it is accurate!

Delicious! Made as written, but sort of eyeballed everything (except for the dressing). I just knew that my mom would love this and she did...so did the rest of us! A definite keeper and a great spin on panzanella~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Was a bit sceptical but had all the ingredients so gave it a try.  Very interesting variation of bread salad.
