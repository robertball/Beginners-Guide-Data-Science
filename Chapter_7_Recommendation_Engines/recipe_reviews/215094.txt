Excellent! Followed the recipe, using Low Sodium Chicken Stock and everyone loved it. The bright, fresh flavors of the ginger and lemon made this a perfect side to go with Baked Scallops. We will enjoy this often. Thanks for sharing!

lemon rice is common in india  particularly in south india.  I know this dish as a vegetarian. Hi, dont add chicken or any non veggie into this also my suggestion is that basmati rice alone is not accepted.  Other qualities of rice is also possible.  try it, i like it

Delicious! I did not have fresh lemon so as another reviewer did, I used lemon juice (2 T.) and lemon pepper in place of the zest. Also used 1 T. ground ginger instead of fresh and then followed the recipe as written. I served rice with salmon with the brown sugar glaze (recipe on AR) and a fresh salad. Wonderful dinner.

I made this rice (exactly as suggested) as a side dish for lemon pork gyros and it was a hit! Even my two young kids ate every last piece.

Had this with lobster tail, and it complemented the flavour wonderfully. Will definitely be making this rice again.

Maybe our lemon was unusually large, but DH and I both thought there was way too much lemon in the rice.

My whole family LOVED this rice!  I had to tweak the recipe because we didn't have lemons (only lime), so I used lemon juice and lime zest.  We also did not have basmati rice, so I used jasmine rice.  Still turned out DELICIOUS!  Thank you!

This is a great recipe for boring white rice!  I am rating this recipe as written!  The second time I made it (right now)I used regular long grain white rice and used an orange instead of lemon.  Added some chopped jalapeno's as well :) Went great with my Spiced Orange Pork Chops.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is awesome stuff!  Alright...I DID change a few things...I HATE doing that on a recipe I just try for the first time...but...I used peanut oil instead of canola...why, I don't know...was curious..:)...and I didn't have fresh ginger (it would spoil before I used it all) so I used a tablespoon of ground, and I didn't have a lemon, so I used 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and one tablespoon of lemon peel (zest)....and WOW guys...this dish turned out extraordinary!!!  My son was duly impressed as well!  This is a keeper fer sure!  THANKS LOADS!

I thought it had too much lemon and too much ginger and right now I'm really into lemon.  My lemons were large so the recipe might be sensitive to size.

Delicious! Simple, but flavorful - I don't like plain white rice but between the chicken broth and lemon, this was bright and delicious.  The ginger flavor was very subtle.  This would be a great side to any number of dishes, and it worked particularly well with the spicy Yogurt-Marinated Salmon I served it with.

Delish! I used brown rice instead of basmati, so the cook time was a little longer, but we loved it.

I've tried a lot of recipes from Allrecipes.com. Most turn out great, some need a few tweaks, some aren't great no matter what I try, but never inedible...until now. I don't know if my lemon was too big (produced a half cup of juice), or our tastes are just way different than any of the other reviewers. But this was awful, and it smelled worse than it tasted.

Made this exactly as written and we loved it. It was perfect with baked tilapia. Using leftovers tonight to stuff cornish hens. I'm also thinking this would be great for fried rice recipes as well.

Great for everyday side or for anyone with an upset stomach. My best friend loved this when she was pregnant and couldn't hold much down. I use butter instead of oil and white pepper instead of black pepper.

I thought this was fantastic...what a simple yet delicious way to serve basmati!  Loved the lemon flavour, made it light and fresh.  Served this with Salmon with Brown Sugar Glaze (AR) and some steamed broccoli/carrots.  Yummy!

Don't let the ginger scare you.  This rice is flavorful and balanced.  I doubled the recipe with perfect results for my big family.  We had it once as a side with fish, and then again to accompany a stir fry with a boldly flavored sauce.  Perfect with each!

I'm starting to experiment with different rice recipes, and this was a definate keeper.  I did add a little fresh dill to this because I enjoy that flavor.  I served this with non-floured chicken breast cooked in a little butter, olive oil, salt and pepper along with roasted asparagus.  I thoroughly enjoyed this and will make it again and again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Served tonight with Grilled Tilapia and Mango Salsa, this was perfect side dish. Really really easy to make, didn't change a thing and it tasted lovely and light.  Adding to my regular rice sides rotation.

This was a pretty good rice recipe. I also thought the lemon was a little overpowering on it's own but I paired it with the Sweet Hot Mustard Chicken Thighs recipe from this site and the flavors are wonderful together. I got a late start on the rice so I only rinsed it a few times; if you have time soak it for about 30 minutes before you cook. It makes it less sticky

This is got to be the best, most refreshing rice ever. I can't wait to make it again. This is going to be my go to rice recipe. The lemon flavor is amazing.

We really loved this. I have made it twice, the first made it more lemony and the second a little more ginger.  Amazing both ways. Also really great for left overs!
I will pass this one on to others for sure!

Made with brown basmati and it turned out really good. It is lemony, but really good so plan meat dish accordingly. Could see it with salmon or seafood. (I did spicy pork dish) I would definitely make it again just as the recipe states as well as reducing lemon to go with other dishes.

Loved this as did the whole family. Only change was I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth as I had a box already open. I always think fresh is best and used fresh lemon and fresh ginger. Outstanding!

I made this in the Instant Pot. As such, I modified slightly, I soaked the rice. I used butter instead of canola oil, and sauted the lemon zest and ginger before adding the soaked rice. I then added 1 and 1/4 cups chicken broth, lemon juice and salt and pepper. I used Manual High setting for 4 minutes and then Natural Release for 10 minutes. It turned out great!

I found this recipe too vague.  The juice and zest of one lemon can vary greatly and needs to be better defined, and I would say the same for the amount of ginger.  2" of root can vary greatly.

Rice can tend to be a little boring, but this dish perfectly compliments the Honey-Orange Firecracker Shrimp.  The next day I heated it up for a left-over and could not see any reason to make changes. The flavor held up very well with re-heating. It's a keeper.

I followed the recipe except used plain old white rice. Maybe basmati rice would really improve it. This dish was just ok. Wasn't bad but wasn't good.

This is good even though I did not read it correctly and 'fry' the rice in the oil before adding the liquid. I did have to use about 3/4 cup more liquid before it was ready.  I think it needs more ginger, too.

A nice change of pace to our family's usual white rice.  My husband was not a fan of basmati rice in general, however, so I would not make this often.

This was a very good recipe. Bright and flavorful. My husband even liked it. I have a heck of a time trying to grate the ginger. Eventually I just diced it small and pressed it with my knife. Over all nice flavor, and I will definitely make it again.

I was excited about trying this recipe, but really didn't like it all. The lemon juice made the rice gummy and the whole thing was peculiar tasting. Followed the recipe exactly.

My husband and I liked this, the kids liked it less. I think I added too much ginger (I love ginger) and it ended up a little bitter. I will make it again but maybe try to balance it a bit better.

We loved the flavor of the rice.  It came out a little sticky but in hindsight I failed to rinse the rice before cooking it.  I used more ginger than called for because that was what I had. Next time I think I will back off on the amount of ginger and use only what was called for.  This one is a keeper.

I make this every time I make curry or tikka masala...it is perfect...note, i always use ground ginger and it is fine...if you are pressed for time, use minute rice, it is still delicious...a little cilantro is also great in it...when making this, i always put the broth and seasonings, lemon juice, etc in a pot and taste it before adding the rice...that way the flavors balance...if using basmati, i par cook it,,then add it to the rest of the ingredients...when using minute rice, i just throw it in...it is great with seafood, indian food, mexican food (add cilantro, omit ginger and add a little mexican seasoning)...cant go wrong

I made this to go with  a Grilled Tilapia and Mango Salsa found on this site. The rice was very good and I will make it again, particularly when making the excellent fish and salsa recipe.

I'm giving it 4 stars only because the the ginger was not as prominent as I had expected. But that may have been the fault of the fresh ginger I selected at the store. It was a little fibrous when I minced it which might have affected its flavor.

This had amazing flavor, but my rice ended up a gummy, sticky mess.  Still tasted good, but texture-wise not at all what I was expecting from basmati rice.  I suspect the culprit was too much liquid.  I followed the recipe exactly, but the instructions that came with my rice called for less water per 1 cup rice.  Next time, I'll follow the package directions for the amount of liquid, leaving all else the same, and it should work better!

Only had limes but it came out super!!! Used yellow mix instead of chicken broth as well, and out of absolute laziness I used ginger spice (about the same amount as zest)

Very nice.  Good foil to a smoked Alaskan cod.  Would add a bit of parsley for colour, but otherwise tasty and easy.

I made the recipe as stated.  Very flavourful. The adults loved it. The kids found it had too much ginger. Next time I will cut back the ginger to a 1 inch piece and shred finely rather then mince.

This rice is delicious and super easy.  Don't be afraid to use the full strength of lemon and ginger.  It is not overwhelming.  I served it to guests on the first try and we all raved about it.  I did add a touch of butter.   Served with fish and it was fantastic.  I'll definitely be making this time and time again.

This is a really easy side dish and the taste of lemon and ginger come through and are refreshing.  I made it exactly as it is written and got great compliments.  I served it with lamb chops.

Was very good and easy to make. I did not have any lemon so i used lime instead. I thought that lime tasted better with the ginger would with lemon would have. But overall still good.

I followed the recipe to the letter the first time I made it and immediately I noticed a flaw. Too much liquid. The rice came out sticky. I checked my bag of basmati rice and the recipe on the bag stated 1 1/2 cups liquid to 1 cup of rice. This is what  I use when I cook basmati rice. I recommend adding the 1 1/2 tablespoons on fresh lemon juice the adding enough chicken broth to make 11/2 cups of liquid. Problem of mushy, sticky rice solved.

Subbed bottled lemon juice, no fresh on hand. Also followed rinse and soak recommendations for Basmati. Turned out amazing. Served with Cod piccata. Delicious combo of the light fluffy rice, the Cod and the lemony piccata sauce made my mouth and tummy happy.  Here's hoping the lower glycemic index on the Basmati rice makes my diabetes happy as well.

I made a BIG mistake with this recipe. Grabbed a jar that I thought was brown rice and it turned out to be Orzo.  Great mistake.  Very strong lemon flavour but went well with our meal.

Very good side for any dish, vegetable or meat. However, if I may suggest; add an equal amount of butter to the canola oil, add Kosher salt and WHITE pepper to the broth and reduce heat to low after a hard boil is achieved. 
Almost good on its own!

Really good! The ginger and lemon added a nice complexity to an already good rice. It was a little overdone and I would probably decrease the liquid by just a tad.

This was really good! I used lemon juice and added a clove of minced garlic, and a couple dashes of no-salt seasoning. I also cooked the salt and pepper in. We all liked it, and will probably make it again.

I found this recipe ok not extraordinary. It is not difficult but not exactly something enticing enough for me to try again. The tangy taste of it matches well with the Curry Stand Chicken Tikka Masala from this website though.

Very nice flavours.  Only thing to watch is the spatter if you add the ginger to the hot oil first.  Watch the 1 minute cook very closely as mine started to scorch since there is no liquid yet.  Delicious with salmon.

My new go-to rice recipe! I had to "share" my one lemon with a chicken recipe, so I also used a little bottled lemon juice. I've never used basmati rice, only brown or long grain white. Basmati costs a bit more, but totally worth it. Used the leftover for a fantastic fried rice stir fry! Sautéing the rice in the oil before adding the water is a technique I've been using on plain white rice for a time now; it does make a big difference in flavor and general texture of the finished rice. I think rice has a lesser chance of burning to the pot if it is coated/toasted in the oil before the addition of liquid. Wonderful recipe!

This was awesome.  I made it in my rice cooker using Forbidden Rice, which has a nutty flavor and striking black color.  I used ground ginger as I didn't have fresh, and substituted grapeseed oil for the canola.  My lemon was quite large, so I used about 1-1/2 T of the zest, and 1/3 cup juice.  Served with sauteed mahi mahi.  Will definitely make this again.

Maybe my lemon was too large because it was a unbearable lemon taste I even had to remake it this time without the lemon zest and half of a lemon squeeze, still a bit lemony but after I poured my curry over it great tasting

The family accepted the dish without issue in conjunction with Baked Salmon with Mustard-Dill sauce. The lemon complimented the Salmon graciously. 

I made this recipe in the rice cooker adding rice, lemon, ginger to chicken broth instead of water. I used both juice and zest of fresh lemon (recipe is a bit ambiguous on this point) and must have got too much pulp from squeezed juice in the mix as the rice was a bit sticky. I cooked a little longer to reduce the water content and firm up the rice. Worked like a charm.

Delish!  Made as shown but sprinkled ginger on while rice s sauteeing since I didnt have fresh ginger.  Wonderful even before I salted and peppered it -- very moist!

Very light and refreshing dish. I served it with broiled Grouper and I thought it complimented the fish very well. I really liked the ginger flavor as well as the lemon. Will definitely make this again.

Very good and "different" as my family stated. The lemon I used was huge so my rice was tart to taste. Great with Fish or Shrimp. Will make again.

This rice is amazing!  So delicious and light!  I've made it several times and it has disappeared as soon as I put in on the table!
