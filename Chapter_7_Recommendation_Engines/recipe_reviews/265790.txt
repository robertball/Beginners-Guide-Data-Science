I just did not like the texture of these cookies. They had a good flavor but the texture was too grainy.

These turned out good! I wasn't too sure what size to form the log, so I ended up rolling it to about 14" long and I found the cookies were a little thick - next time I'll roll it to approximately 12".  Or another option is to just flatten them a bit when you put them on the baking sheet. The flavor is good, but I might cut back on the salt, or use unsalted butter. Lots of options for swapping out flavors by using different spices and extracts. These aren't very sweet, but I like them that way. I baked these for 12 minutes and they were perfect. I put the extras in the freezer and they are SO good right out of the freezer!
