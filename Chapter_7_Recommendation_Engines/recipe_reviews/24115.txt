I first found this recipe over a year ago and when I made it everyone loved it! It's quick it's SO easy it's extremely versatile and it's very inexpensive. My Mother in law now makes this pie quite frequently and a sister in law is always requesting it. Our favorite is strawberry although we have made lemonade and lime (a quick easy key lime tasting pie!) and our most recent "berry blue". It is a VERY sweet pie so if you don't like intense sweet this isn't for you. But if you're wanting to try something different and the thought of "eating" kool-aid intrigues you--give it a shot!

This sweet recipe is incredibly quick and easy. I used strawberry drink mix and added 1/2 tsp. of lemon juice. Everyone loved it. I look forward to making many variations on this easy theme when I need an easy pleasing dessert... LOL did I mention how easy this was?

This is probably the simplest pie that I have ever made. It was very good and considering the amount of effort involved it was excellent. Thanks Maggie. I will definitely make it again. Oh I used kiwi-lime drink mix and my husband thought that I had made a key lime pie. I also made one using chocolate sweetened milk ( I don't think that it available any longer) and cherry powdered drink mix. It tasted so much like chocolate covered cherries. Such fun!

My strawberry loving 2 year old loved this. My mom loved it too and asked for the recipe. This is great when you need a dessert but you don't have a lot of ingredients on hand. The only thing I would suggest is to decorate the pie for presentation purposes - with whipped cream piped around it for example. Thanks!!

This was a good pie recipe. For how easy it was it was a GREAT pie recipe. I used lemon lime and it came out really nice. Although next time I will cut down on the amount of condensed milk.

This was very easy to make but tasted awful to me (I used Kool-Aid lemon-lime flavor packet to make a "key lime" pie) and it just had a nasty sweetish "powder" aftertaste. Also it was very gooey and messy even after I kept it in the fridge overnight. To be fair both my boyfriend and his roommate liked it but I wouldn't make this again except maybe for little kids.
