These were delicious. Here's a tip for beginners. Don't add the egg to the saucepan...if it's too warm the egg will CURDLE. My mom told me to slowly beat about half of the chocolate mixture into the egg, a little at a time, so that it won't curdle from the heat. Hope this helps, thanks for the great recipe, I will make again for sure!

Excellent Recipe!!  Living in Canada I've been making Nanaimo bars every Christmas for as long as I can remember!  The recipe I usually use is a little different than this one but what a difference a few changes can make.  The filling is nice and firm, the crust moist and the topping not too hard!  It cuts into squares excellent (I line my pan with parchment paper so it's easier to get out of the pan and cut.)  The top doesn't crack when you're cutting it and the filling doesn't squish out the sides and the bottom stays together nicely.  This is my new Nanaimo bar recipe that I'll be using from now on!! Thanks for the great recipe!

So very delicious!  I doubled the recipe to fit a 9x13 pan and it turned out fabulous.  
Tip for bottom layer: To avoid curdling the egg, I beat the eggs in a separate bowl and slowly added 1/2 cup of the melted cocoa mixture to the egg while whisking, then slowly added the egg mixture to the rest of the cocoa mix while whisking.  Turned out perfect!

This is one of the BEST desserts I have ever made. I had 20 of my husband's co-workers over for tea today, and every single one of them asked me for the recipe. I had catered goodies from a local bakery, yet nearly everyone bypassed those treats for this homemade one. We recently returned from Vancouver where I tried these bars for the first time and fell in love. They are delicious. FIRST TIP: Use "digestive cookies" instead of "graham crackers" to make your crumbs. Graham crackers are sweet, whereas digestives are a little saltier and crunchier -- yum yum! SECOND TIP: Use custard powder (you can find Bird's Eye Custard Powder at Cost Plus and in the British Foods aisle of many specialty grocery stores). Instant vanilla pudding mix is too sweet! Custard powder is just corn starch with some flavoring and coloring and salt, but it gives you the perfect texture, taste, and look. Don't use anything else. THIRD TIP: Be sure to use almonds which you have ground up in the food processor (where I also grind up the digestives). FOURTH TIP: You'll probably want to double the recipe because these go fast. FIFTH TIP: Be sure to read "the most helpful reviews" for how to avoid curdling/scrambling the eggs when you add them to the hot chocolate mixture. The tips worked like a charm for me!

I am from Nanaimo BC and we have Nanaimo Bars everywhere in this town. Of all of the Nanaimo Bar recipes I have tried, this recipe is the closest to what I have always known as the original Nanimo Bar recipe.

NEVER microwave your chocolate - it makes it crack during cutting!
I prefer to double the icing and double the chocolate topping. I garnished my bars with fresh cranberries to add a pop of edible colour - place one whole berry in the centre before placing the pan in the fridge and it will set nicely. Also, I usually end up cracking the chocolate when I cut into squares anyway, so I use muffin tins!

Hubby says they are TOOO good!  That's good!  Guess we'll make them lots.  After reading reviews and making I have some recommendations.  I did not have an issue with the eggs curdling, maybe because my double boiled mixture was not overly hot.  Perhaps the coconut could be reduced to 3/4 C next time.  But my non-coconut friends even liked these.  We do not have custard powder around SO...I did some research and I was pleased with how they turned out.  DO NOT USE VANILLA pudding.  Custard powder is NOT pudding.  Simply substitute 2 TBSP of cornstarch and vanilla.  I had vanilla powder, so I used a tsp of that.  I also only used one cup of p. sugar.  It was the right sweetness but I wish there was a little more of that layer, so next time I might try two cups of p. sugar, if that is too sweet, than I will add another stick of butter to increase volume.  Used semi-sweet chips for topping.  Turned out beautifully!  Can't wait to make these when it's too hot this summer to bake.

5 stars and more! I just came back from Vancouver, Canada and had them for the first time at a 5 star hotel. One bite and I just had to have the recipe. Thanks for sharing it. These were identical to the ones I had... (I used the instant vanilla pudding mix).

these were easier than i first thought they would be. I used nilla wafer crumbs instead of graham, instant vanilla pudding mix and took the suggestion of others and mixed some of the chocolate mixture into the beaten egg before adding to prevent curdling.  To make spreading the chocolate on top easier i put the pan in the freezer for about 20 minutes and let the chocolate cool for the same amount of time and it spread easily. I cut them by using a serrated knife that i dipped in warm water. They cut easy with no cracking. Nice presentation.  Theses bars are very rich and very sweet.  I cut them into very small squares and no one could eat more than one.  Nice flavor.

Very Delicious!  One of my favourite treats...I'm from nanaimo and these were awesome!  I used milk and pudding powder as suggested, and would recommend adding a little less butter to the first 2 layers (or at least the middle layer), closer to 2/3C, because it did turn out a little greasy.  but otherwise, WONDERFUL!

I thought these were pretty good, although a bit on the sweet side for my taste.  I halved the crust/bottom part, like others suggested, and would not do that again.  I would def temper the egg with some of the batter before adding it to the hot mix.  I also sub. vanilla pudding for the custard powder and it was pretty good; I did only use 3 T of butter instead of the whole stick.  Make sure and use BUTTER or OIL when you melt the chips, not margarine, as it will seize the chocolate.  If you score the bar after it has slightly hardened, it makes them much easier to cut.

I have used this recipe several times, and I've found that the butter in the bottom layer can be reduced to 6 tablespoons without altering the flavor at all. Makes them less greasy and less fattening.

I have also used a quarter cup of butter plus a quarter cup of cream cheese in the filling.  Another way to reduce calories.

These were a special treat and unusual in their own way. The reviews about whisking the chocolate into the egg slowly before adding it back to the heated chocolate were very helpful. I used a sauce pan on low-simmer for the first layer rather than a double-boiler...1/2 cup butter in first layer to mix graham cracker crumbs and 1/3 cup butter in the second layer to cream the confectioner's sugar and doubled the ingredients in the third layer. Thanks for the recipe!!

Wow, very sweet and I have a huge sweet tooth!  I cut out one cup of confectioners sugar too!  However, they are unusually addicting!  I would say cut them very small...I got 25 out of my 8x8 pan.  I also couldn't find custard powder so had to resort to instant pudding.  I am not sure if that affected the sweetness (since I don't know how sweet custard powder is).    Either way, if I find custard powder, I'll definitely try these again.  They were a great project for my 9 yr old son and I as we ended our study of Canada!

My husbands exact words were 'these are the best Naniamo bars I have ever had', and I agree. They are not sicky-sweet like most I have had, but just right. I grew up with Naniamo bars, and I have to say, these are better than my moms... sorry mom!

Overall, the final product was very good, but I have a few recommendations... 1. Use a 7" x 11" cake pan, which will make the bars slightly thinner. 2. Use less cocoa powder in the bottom layer, 3-4 tablespoons at most. I followed the recipe, using 5 tbs, and I thought it drowned out the coconut flavor. 3. Grind up the nuts and coconut into very small pieces - in a food processor - for the bottom layer. This will help you press the bottom layer into a nice flat layer, so the next two layers also spread easily. 4. Add 2 tablespoons of milk or cream to the chocolate in the top layer, to make it a little easier to spread and cut once it's refrigerated.

I was born and raised Calgary, Alberta Canada. But, moved to the United States over a decade ago. I have to tell you that this recipe is the CLOSEST in the way of overall look and taste to what I was brought up with in Canada. The only thing I can't get over is, how on earth could I eat 3 squares at one sitting when I was in elementary school? These are so rich that I am lucky to be able to finish a 2 inch square. Thank you so much to Martha J Paul for adding this recipe for all of us home sick Canadians!

So these should come with a warning...Danger of Eating Entire Pan and Gaining 5 Pounds.   I have reviewed close to 175 recipes on this site over the last 10 years and this is my favourite recipe ever!!!  Unfortunately I make it far too often and it is my demise! Awesome, decadent, heavenly...there are not enough words to describe.  I have an addiction to these :D

I am a really big fan of Nanaimo Bars as I remember my mom making them when I was young and I have tried to make them a few times without success (and trust me, the bought ones are NOT the same)!
I made this recipe exactly as written with only one change and that being the chocolate top which I used 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of semisweet and melted them in the microwave with butter as the recipe states.  They turned out fabulous!  NOTE:  Let the bars cool and the chocolate set at 'room temperature' then cut into squares and refrigerate or freeze.  If you refrigerate them first, the chocolate will all crack apart when you cut them.

I can see how these would be a 4-star treat if they held sentimental value for somebody who grew up eating them. As somebody who had never heard of a nanaimo bar, I just saw the great reviews and thought they looked good. They were kind of a let-down, I must say. With all the different flavors nothing really stood out...I could barely taste the chocolate in the crust even though I am picky and buy a very expensive and high-quality cocoa powder. 

The crust is somewhat dry and slightly resembles american "no bake" cookies. the topping is akin to american buttercream topped with ganache. Can't go wrong with ganache, but I wish I had just made brownies instead!

The best part about them was they looked pretty- I piped the chocolate on top in zig-zags and cut them with a warm hot knife and they looked much better than they tasted!

Soooo good. I doubled the recipe and put into a 9x13 pan. I used custard powder but next time I think I might just use vanilla pudding mix. I lined the pan with parchment so I could take it out a little easier. Cuts really well and absolutely delicious!!

I followed the recipe exact, except for the middle part I only used 2/3 C. of butter as one reviewer said it was a bit greasy and tasted 'too buttery', so I followed that one suggestion...

other than that ....classic! tastes like the real thing from a Starbucks in Vancouver (or Nanaimo, for that matter).. for those that don't know, Nanaimo bars are *very* sweet... most cuts/slices are no bigger than the size of a Triscuit cracker, maybe less...

Grew up with Nanaimo Bars, usually a Christmas treat. Thanks for the recipe, I live in New England now and I'm able to make these for Christmas for my kids!

The lady who rated 3 stars and added cranberries obviously hasn't made the recipe as it. Its perfect, don't change a thing!

These are very good, but I prefer the traditional walnuts instead of almonds.  Even better, but a bit more costly, I use pecans in the bottom layer.  Also, ensure you use custard powder and not vanilla pudding, which is far too sweet.

I shop at a grocery store called Haggen, and they have the best bakery I've ever been to in a grocery store.  They make these DELICIOUS Nanaimo bars, and I tried this recipe in an attempt to recreate them, so I won't have to keep buying them.  Well, this was soooo far away from Haggen's version.  The bottom layer seems close enough, but the middle layer seemed too powdered-sugary, and the top layer was all wrong.  I think Haggen uses milk chocolate, and their's is really melt-in-your-mouth.  Maybe they add some Crisco to their chocolate when they're melting it.  I think this recipe has potential, but I must be spoiled by Haggen.

There are a "bunch" of North Americans working here in Ireland. Our friends from BC were talking about Nanaimo bars, and feeling a little homesick. I made these for dessert, as a surprise for them. They were amazed. Said they were perfect! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. And helping my friends feel a little less homesick.

I just made this and this took longer than the stated prep time.  It's not for the novice baker.  Be sure to clean up the kitchen between layers - this is a pot/pan/utensil intensive project.  But for those hard core bakers, you will love sinking your teeth into this.  Best review suggestions:  use parchment paper, use less, lots less, butter in layer one, temper eggs before adding to layer one chocolate, use half cream cheese and half butter in second layer and use stand mixer - works better than hand-held when adding powdered sugar (I doubled the recipe so that was a lot of powdered sugar!), freeze 20 min. after second layer is added, melt chocolate for this layer (in double boiler, NOT microwave) (use 70- 100% cacao to cut sweetness) and double amount of choc., and add tad bit of cream to chocolate, let cool while first layers are in freezer.  Choc. will start to harden when spread on first two layers from freezer.  Score through chocolate immediately to avoid cracking later.  Score 1" squares.  Let finish setting on counter then finish cutting squares.  Freeze.  The reviews suggest they are better served cold.  And the chocolate does not turn white if melted as recommended.  Thanks everyone for all the prep. suggestions!!

I'm in the process of making these now and I'm wondering if the middle layer is supposed to have a buttercream icing consistency?  I've never made nanaimo bars before but it seems a little thick?  I followed the recipe exactly.

Very tasty Nanaimo bars. I recommend using a little less coconut and making a little more custard and chocolate topping than the recipe suggests.

Absolutely amazing. I've made these before, but with a different recipe. A friend asked me to make these for her birthday and they turned out far tastier and better looking than the first ones I made. I have messed up the recipe before when I tried altering it, so I followed this one almost to a T (only changed slightly the amount of graham cracker crumbs, because mine were very powdery and probably would've caused the base to be too crumbly with the stated amount) and they came out wonderful. Everyone loved them -- and so did I!

These are actually quite simple if you follow the directions accurately. I would add a few more chocolate squares to the top layer, it is a bit thin compared to the other 2 layers, but delicious!!

These were amazing. I mixed the first layer ingredients as instructed, except omitted the egg and baked at 350 for 10 minutes. I added the 2nd layer, then refrigerated, then the top layer when the middle was hard and cold. No double boiler! They went over really well and everyone loved them.

Generally a good recipe, but the middle layer, the vanilla custard layer, has WAY too much butter in it - it tastes like eating sweetened butter. Too rich for my tastes, and richer than the Nanaimo bars I've eaten in Vancouver that I loved so much.

I would refer you to the other Nanaimo bar recipes on this website for a more moderate approach to the vanilla layer.

mom used to make this recipe and now me, and it everything everyone ever says about it and more.

I have one problem ...

My chocolate top layer is always a terrible mess.  It is hard to spread, there isn't enough of it (so I make more) but then it also melts the layer below it and then the white stuff mixes with the chocolate.  It always looks really awful too, messy, pasty.  I do take it off before it is fully melted, but I end up with chunks of not totally melted chocolate.  It is very frustrating because I am most of the way through, and no matter how long I let my white layer set (hours) every year my top chocolate layer messes everything up.

I have made this recipie several times. Completely worth the effort. As a native NW girl and a daughter of a Canuck, I crave these bars and savor each bite! I've always made them with instant vanilla pudding with great results. When you bring them to a party, save yourself the time and bring copies of recipies with you. You'll be asked for them!

This is my go-to nanaimo bar recipe. I've modified it slightly: I use 3 tbsp. of coconut milk in place of cream (my good friend is lactose intolerant), and I use 3/4-1 C. of chocolate chips (dairy-free) with a 1 TBSP. butter or (virgin) coconut oil for the topping. I've also had good luck adding a tiny a bit of orange zest to the topping. LOVE THESE!! (Oh, and I've made them in the past to match the recipe, and they were still amazing!!)

I made this for my sister's sweet 16 party, for a girl who's obsessed with nanaimo bars. She liked them, but they tasted a little different. The bottom layer was almost overpowering to the top 2, which were both delicously creamy. It seemed like there were too many graham crackers, and it overtook the creaminess of the over-all nanaimo bar taste my sister loves. I'd reccommend reducing the overall amount of the bottom layer and spreading it thinner, as well as using fewer graham cracker crumbs so that flavor isn't so obvious.

These were fantastic!  I think I'd call them a candy rather than a cookie.  I left out the coconut in the base.  I also had to blot excess butter from the top of the base before I added the butter cream.  Next time I will use only 6 tbsp of butter in the base.  The buttercream was delicious.  I intend to use it as a filling for my next chocolate cake.  I used instant vanilla pudding mix and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.  I used a 70% chocolate Lindt bar in the ganache topping.  The bitter chocolate helped to keep the Nanaimo bar from tasting too sweet.  I will definately be making these again!

Been making these for over 40 years!! My mother-in-law (Scandanavian descent) had been making them all her life. She gave me her recipe. However, we call them Chocolate Butter Creams. Whoever said these came from Canada 30 years ago, as I've seen in other websites, is sorely mistaken. Regardless, they are YUMMY!!

Yuuumm! I keep seeing recipes for these popping up on blogs, but being from Texas I'd never tried them before. I added a whole brick of cream cheese to the middle layer, though, which helped cut the sweetness a little, I think. I also used the pudding mix (a whole four-serving box) and instead of whipping cream I used coconut flavored coffeemate. And I added a little almond extract too! DEEEE-licious!

I cut out an entire cup of confectioners sugar in the middle layer, it was NOT missed, and I highly recommend freezing them. OK, this is strange but, at first I thought they were WAY too rich and sweet. So I cut them into small portions and wrapped them and put them in the freezer. After they were frozen I think they were somehow much better. It is the middle of summer and very hot here, so maybe they needed a blast of cold (They are from the NorthWest after-all). They didn't become too hard to bite and were so much better from the freezer. So I put some into tupperware, brought them to work, kept them in the freezer all morning, brought them out right after lunch, and people were like, "OMG What are these, is this fudge, this is soooo good, what is it?!"

Wow. I've been wanting to make these for a very long time and they did not disappoint. Very rich, sweet and delicious. Not for the casual dessert eater: side effects might include diabetic coma. I didn't find these that difficult to make at all and had no problems with the egg - just make sure that your chocolate mixture cools a bit before you add the beaten egg and stir immediately!

This was a hit at the office.  In fact I had one gentleman tell me that they were better than the one's that he had while he was in Nanaimo.  The only thing I did different, which was not intentional, is I used dark cocoa powder.  They were fabulous!

After reading the reviews I just had to try this receipe.  It is wonderful and it was easy to make. I had no problems. As always I did use tips left by other reviewers. I am not a great cook.  But, the women who leave reviews are terrific in leaving advice for those of us who just get by.  Thank you for the recipe and all the great advice and tips.

I don't usually like nanaimo bars, but these were really good! They aren't as sickeningly sweet as most.  I made them for a Christmas party, and everyone enjoyed them.  The only change I made was to add ground almmonds to the base as that's all the grocery store had.

Amazing recipe!!! You must try it.  The first layer is a bit tricky because you need to cook the egg without it curdling. Besides that they are super simple and taste terrific. Great Canadian classic. Thanks!!

My kids said this was okay. I will not make it again. I had some difficulties with the recipe. 1-First of all, the crust was not good. While making the crust the eggs curdled, even though I followed another reviewer's advice of adding a little of the chocolate mixture to the beaten eggs before adding it to the whole pot. Still didn't work. As a result the crust did not hold very well. It was very crumbly.  2- The creamy middle was basically the consistency of a thick frosting. It was way too sweet. I didn't understand the point of using custard powder as it was not 'custardy' at all.  Also spreading the creamy filling was difficult. It was very thick and kept picking up crumbs from the crust. The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because the kids still liked the taste.

I am from BC and I know how delicious Nanaimo Bars are!  In our family we DOUBLE the centre filling and use walnuts instead of almonds in the base.

Definitely make half of the bottom layer.  I also used the instant vanilla pudding and regular milk instead of the heavy cream.  They turned out wonderful - just like the ones I had on Salt Spring Island!

Excellent I'm an Island girl and these are perfect. I reduce the sugar from 2cups to 11/2 cups for the middle layer, just so they are not too sweet. Thanks

We love this recipe!!  I have used orange extract and it is our favorite.  Of course mint and cherry are just as good!!! Very rich, this satisfies that sugar craving like no other!  A lot of work, cleaning up too but definitely worth the effort.

Of the 3 recipes for this bar on this site, this is the closest to the original; almonds (I use sliced, not chopped), not pecans, with coconut and NO oatmeal. I substitute instant vanilla pudding for custard powder (1/4 c.) in my recipe, because it's not available in my area. BUT, since I thought the layer was a bit bland, I add 1 tsp. vanilla nut extract (I use Watkins brand). Delicious!

I have made these every Christmas.  Growing up on Vancouver Island, they were a mainstay every Christmas. I would recomend cutting the bottom in half.  I also doubled the chocolate squares and added a 1/4 cup heavy cream to make them easier to eat.  Finally, I cooked the bottom so there was no worries about raw eggs.  Enjoy!

These are very sweet, and are good for killing a craving. My husband is from Canada, so I thought I would give him a taste of home. He loves them, and says that they are exactly what they should be like. Thank you for the recipe! Oh...I used chopped walnuts rather than almonds since that is what I had on hand. I plan to try some variations that have come to mind. I think you could have a lot of fun trying different flavors and colors!

This is the perfect Nanaimo bar recipe. As a Canadian living in Australia it was nice to have a little piece of home! Since graham crackers don't exist here I substituted crushed arrowroot biscuits - you would never know the difference. My coworkers go crazy for these and always request them!

YUMM-O!  We love the nanaimo bars in restaurants, these were better!!  I used the vanilla pudding mix and they turned out great.  I tend to shy away from recipes that seem like lots of work, but this was EASY and quick to make--a big hit at our Easter celebration this year!

these were very tasty - probably the most covetted of my christmas baking this year.  i replaced the custard with mint extract and a touch of green food coloring to make them into "grasshoppers".  it was an excellent alternative.  i did have a very obvious problem cutting these though.  i let them sit in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap, overnight to firm up and then cut them in the morning.  the chocolate cracked so badly that my pieces looked like mosaic tiles and the filling squished out the edges.  not sure how other reviewers managed to cut without the chocolate cracking :)

WOW! I made these and my dad who was raised in B.C. had a flashback. (We now live in the southwest) My friends and my husband who had never had these before said it was like a bite of heaven. Make these, you will not be disappointed. This is my cookie exchange recipe this year. EXCELLENT! Note: I used vanilla pudding in place of custard. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. Also, keep in the fridge and eat chilled, they are best this way. Thanks for the recipe!

Ever since I heard about Nanaimo Bars on Canadian TV shows such as Corner Gas I wondered what they were. I finally asked my sister and she said they were "food for the gods." I made them today and I have to agree with her. I cut them into small pieces and froze half. I love the creamy center and the contrast with the texture of the crust, not to mention the chocolate topping. A big YUMMY!

I was excited to find a recipe for Nanaimo bars.  I had them years ago when visiting Vancouver, BC.  I used unsweetened coconut rather than the sweetened coconut.  One change I would also make:  use unsweetened chocolate rather than semi sweet in the 3rd layer.  This way the chocolate flavor is there but it is not adding any more sweetness to an already sweet recipe.  I will make this again, and thank you for submitting it!

Great recipe.  I doubled it and used a 9x13 pan - it was empty at the end of the day! Custard powder was hard to find.  I bought it at Meijers in the international food aisle. This is not a common dessert in Kentucky and was a welcomed change.  I'll definitely make it again.

I made the bottom layer thicker and decreased the ingredients for the middle layer so it wasn't so sweet.  Awesome!

Excellent recipe. I used crushed digestive biscuits instead of graham cracker crumbs, as I am living in Scotland and no one here has heard of graham crackers, and it came out great. My family who emigrated from Canada many years ago loved them. One of the best Canadian desserts ever!

I cannot tell you how great this recipe is!  I made these for a bridal shower with several other desserts, and this was truly the hit of the party!  Recipe is perfect just like it is (well, ok, I added an extra square of chocolate on top!).  I'm from the Northwest, and these are just like they're supposed to be.  Not too thin, plenty of ingredients in the layers.  Taste is superb!  Now, if people only knew about these unique bars, maybe they could find this great recipe!

I made it for family Sunday dinner and it was a hit! Just as a note, as I understood, 2 first layers should be chilled properly before 3rd layer application

First of all,  this was really delicious and everyone really enjoyed them.  I did run into some problems which may have been my own error.  I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan.  I figured this would make the bars thicker. I would make more of the filling and the chocolate topping  next time because the bottom layer was pretty thick in comparison. When I melted my chocolate with the butter,  I was very careful to use a double boiler and made sure no moisture got in the chocolate.  Still,  the butter made it sieze and the chocolate was unusable.  I tried again without the butter and it didn't sieze, but when I poured it on the cooled filling, it thickened right away. When I tried to spread it,  it drug across the melting filling and made a mess.  I think my mistake was using chocolate chips instead of bakers chocolate but I'm not sure.  If anyone has ideas,  I'd appreciate it!

I made this recipe using tips from multiple people. These turned out fantastic! Not one bar left after potluck! Everyone was eating these BEFORE the hamburgers & hotdogs were off the grill! Here is what I did:
Lined an 8X8 square pan with parchment paper both ways (I traced the pan size and cut so parchment paper fit exactly with2-3 inches of overhang on each side. Then I secured the parchment paper with small office supply clips on each side of pan so parchment paper stayed put. 
First Layer:
Ground entire amount of graham crackers listed to fine texture. Dumped this into large bowel. Then ground up the coconut & almonds together until fine texture. Dumped this over the graham crackers. Made the chocolate sauce EXACTLY as explained in recipe (Once chocolate mixture was melted,  I took top pan off of double boiler and laid top pan onto a towel). Then I literally dumped entire whisked egg into chocolate mixture and whisked continually for 2-3 mins. Curdled at first, but became a beautiful glossy smooth texture with continued whisking- just keep whisking!  Added to large bowl with graham crackers/coconut/almonds. Then I stirred REALLY WELL. A good 3-4 minutes until every morsel of graham cracker/coconut/almond mixture was totally coated throughout. Don't try to rush this step. All of it gets coated with time & patience! Dump everything into prepared pan. Press down hard, getting crumb Into corners. Then take a flat bottom small ramekin (or flat bottom glass) and press REALLY HA

Please add one more thing  at the very end of step one. "Cool in fridge for 20-30 min before adding second layer" I did not do this and the custard layer would not stick to bottom layer. It kept lifting as I tried to spread it bringing up chocolaty bits and giving the yellow layer a messy dirty look.

I like this version. If you want to temper the egg, do not follow the direction on the video, which is the reverse of tempering and could curdle it. Temper eggs by whisking a portion of your hot base into the eggs to gradually warm them and homogenize them; then whisk the homogeneous egg mixture back into the hot mass. This helps avoid curdling.

Overall the flavors did not blend and it was way too sweet. The bar base was delicious. The icing layer (which I thought would be more of a custard) was icky sweet so much that the bittersweet chocolate layer on top couldn’t counterbalance it.  The only people who liked it are the ones that like to eat icing straight.

I am so thrilled to have FINALLY tried these Nanaimo Bars that I've wanted to try for a while now. I soo wish I had others  to compare it to but I'm in US(never seen or heard of them here). I loved the flavor of the bar  and I liked the amount of each layer(that seemed wonderful). I do wish the middle layer had more of a custard flavor though. I found a recipe online for homemade custard powder because it's not sold in our stores.  I liked the flavor of it but the powdered sugar was just too sweet and overpowering.  I would follow recommendations to lessen sugar a bit(or maybe add more custard powder)?! I think I'll try that next. The semi sweet chocolate was good but,, a personal preference...I think I'll top w/ milk chocolate(suits my tastes more)  
This was amazing!!!!!!!!!

I have had actual Canadians who grew up eating these things say this recipe rocks. I had no problem finding the custard powder in Publix in the international food (British section). I've not tried it with pudding, but I really think the custard powder makes the dessert. However, the chocolate topping needs to be tripled (or at least doubled). The amount the recipe calls for produces a covering of, like, 1/16" thick for a 8"x 8" pan, which is no way sufficient. Use the whole bar of baking chocolate and adjust the butter accordingly.

I found it to be waaaay too buttery. I used gluten free graham cracker crumbs for the bottom so I don't know if it was because of that, but my base had the consistency of cake batter so I added more crumbs but then the butter separated from it creating a thin layer of butter floating on top. I soaked it up with a paper towel and it was fine and tasted good but even the filing I found tasted overly buttery. And you'll need more chocolate for the top part and make sure your second layer is chilled enough before you add the chocolate. This recipe is overall not bad but just way too buttery!

These are excellent!  I also used instant vanilla pudding because I couldn't find custard powder and it wasn't too sweet.  Some people suggested to "reduce" the butter in the middle layer from 1/2 cup to 2/3 cup, but 2/3 cup is actually more than 1/2 cup.  Maybe the original writer meant to use 2/3 of that stick of butter.  Not sure, but I used the full stick of butter

Awesome recepie! Reminds me of the ones mom used to make. Lining your pan with parchment paper is key! Also followed others suggestions and tempered the eggs with half the chocolate before adding it all together. I also doubled the top layer and chilled for about 15 min and then scored the chocolate layer to eliminate cracking. I will definitely be making this over and over again! Thanks for the great recepie.

A few changes based on others feedback: 
1. Wait for chocolate to cool slightly before adding beaten egg (about 5 minutes). 
2. Process the graham crackers, coconut (I used shredded), and almonds in a food processor/ Vitamix. Crust consistency was excellent. 
3. I couldn't find custard powder, so I used organic instant pudding (there were only three ingredient sugar, constarch, and vanilla... please don't use the conventional brands, too many artificial ingredients that will affect flavor). Since the instant pudding already had sugar, I only used 1/2 c. confectioner's sugar and I found the sweetness to be perfect. Otherwise, skip the instant pudding and just use 2 TBSP cornstarch and 1 tsp vanilla. Still cut back on the powdered sugar... I c. at most, unless you like to eat frosting  directly from the tub (if that's the case, you might be okay with 2 c.
4. For the chocolate frosting, I used semi sweet chocolate chips (about 5-6 ounces) with a hint of mint (because I love minty desserts...), 2 tbsp butter, and a dash of the heavy cream. 
THE RESULT: AMAZING... WHOLE FAMILY LOVED THEM. Still pretty sweet so I echo everyone's comments that you can really only eat about one...

These are excellent. Very sweet. I didn't have cocoa powder for the bottom layer so used 1 oz. of unsweetened chocolate squares (4 squares). Worked well

I have loved Nanaimo bars since visiting my MIL a few years back when she had some that she had received as a gift.   They were so good, that I finally set about making my own.

I followed this recipe exactly, though I did double the chocolate topping layer as it didn't seem like enough to spread around.

My kids loved it and we will be giving it to our neighbors as part of a holiday cookie gift.

Managed to successfully make nanaimo bars - my first time! I ended up needing a bit more semisweet chocolate to fully cover the batch, but they tasted great. Really enjoyed the tips in the comments about preventing the egg from curdling. Yum!

Hands down best Nanaimo bar recipe I have tried! I find most recipes don't get the custard filling quite right, it ends up tasting too much like icing sugar. This recipe nailed it. Although heavy on butter ever bit of it is smooth and creamy!

Not as impressed as I usually am finding recipes on this site - I have made nanaimo bars for years with great success.  I was recently away from  home without my "tried and true" recipe so I went to the internet and came away with an amazing recipe.  Today, when wanting to replicate that I came to this site because I have had so much success - but it was not the right recipe (which I realized early on, but it was too late to change).  The bottom is falling apart horribly, perhaps it needs more butter.  

They are tasty - but the bottom part is definitely dry and they will be very difficult to put on a platter for Christmas Eve.  My kids will gobble them up (with a spoon), but on my way back to bake another batch!

These are excellent!  My first batch wasn't great, but I learned a few things and then doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan to take to a cookie exchange.  I found it was easier to thicken the chocolate/egg mixture after removing from the heat.  I whipped the custard layer well until it was light and fluffy.  I wanted a slightly thicker top layer so I added some more chocolate and butter.  Then I put it in the fridge for about 15 minutes to let it set, and then I scored the chocolate.  I like it best when the bars are cold, so I store it in the fridge.  These are really rich, so I actually cut the 8x8 recipe into 32 pieces, and the 9x13 into 48 pieces.

Wonderful flavor and very easy to make, despite the three layers. I recommend refrigerating the first layer while you prepare the middle layer. It makes spreading the custard mixture much easier. These did not last long in my house!

The very best! I used the vanilla pudding and it turned out great! I think next time I will leave out the almonds, and try a peanut butter layer between the vanilla and chocolate topping.

Yummy! Found it hard to spread even layer chocolate on top however. I did follow reviews and use 1/3 c butter not 1/2c in middle custard layer. I like the thicker bottom layer and thinner custard layer!

Rave reviews from my test subjects!
The only changes I made was to put it in a 7x11 pan, used slightly less butter in the custard layer. But must say Bird's Custard powder is a must for it to be authentic.

Thanks for posting a real winner Martha!

These are amazing! I think next time I would double the top layer and maybe the middle layer, although taste wise it doesn't need it. Used coconut sugar instead of granulated, unsweetened coconut, and used coconut cream flavored pudding mix instead of custard powder. I think the sweetness was perfect. Reduced butter in the middle layer by about one or two tablespoons but that layer didn't harden as much as I expected it (not sure if it is supposed to). It's hard to stop eating these!

These were great! I think I'll add a bit more sugar to the middle layer next time, it tasted a bit too much like butter.

The best I've made yet!  The other recipe I used, barely yielded enough chocolate for the top, and was sickly sweet...this is amazing and I've had to make it twice this holiday season because my family ate them all!  Excellent recipe!

I love this recipe. I used to live in BC, Canada, the home of Nanaimo bars, but now I'm in the UK and have to make my own. These have become my specialty. I use actual custard powder (not vanilla pudding mix as many reviewers do), digestive biscuit crumbs (instead of graham cracker), desiccated coconut (instead of flaked), and plain chocolate cake covering (rather than chocolate and butter) due to the different availability of ingredients here. It's fine with or without the nuts. I find that as written the crust is too thick, so for two 9 x 13" pans I double the crust and triple the filling. When I haven't had any cocoa, it works fine to use drinking chocolate (NOT instant hot chocolate, which has milk powder) for the cocoa and sugar in the base layer.

mmm so yummy! Sometimes to mix it up I add a few drops of mint extract and a few drops green food dye into the custard, I love is this way, but my boyfriend prefers the original, either way, delicious!

This recipe is great! My family is from Canada but now lives in NJ. Whenever we used to go to Ontario to visit relatives we always would bring home frozen nanaimo bars from a store up there. But now everyone loves the way I make them, even better than the ones they are used to from the store and Timmys. This recipe is great! And I use instant vanilla pudding power and it works fine. Thanks!

Pretty good! The Robin Hood boxed Nanaimos are a little easier to make, though, and don't require as much butter, so I think I'll go for that next time. If I make 'em from scratch again, I think I'll put the coconut into the grinder first so that I get the coconut taste without the coconut texture. I'll also use something else for the top layer; the Baker's chocolate didn't seem to go quite right.

edit: having made these a second time, they taste way too much like butter. will take it down to 1/3c in each layer and double the chocolate.

These were really really good! I cut back a tiny bit on the butter and I have no idea what 4 1-ounce pieces of chocolate was, in the end I used about 100g of dark chocolate. I added about 1/2tsp of vanilla extract in the middle layer. Very very good!! Thank you!

These are a little different than the ones I make but quite similar.  Some have said too much butter, well I forgot the butter in the second layer with the Bird's and it tasted just great.  My husband didn't even notice the difference.

The crumb base was just right although it became tough to stir at the end so I used my hands to blend in the last bit of the graham.  I used instant pudding mix for the middle layer but I found it rather lacked in taste. I think I would either add vanilla to that layer next time or use Bird's instead.  Also, I  reduced the butter in that layer but still found it too rich and heavy and I wish I'd used even less. I will also be tweaking the sweetness in this recipe by adding less of the icing sugar to the middle layer and by using a mixture of semi-sweet choclate and unsweetened chocolate for the topping. The topping was a bit tricky to spread so I'll be sure to spread so next time I'll try spreading it while it's still quite warm and over a very well chillled base.

I didn't have any trouble with curdling with the egg...I was distracted by the phone and had taken the mixture off the stove once it was mixed and kept stirring it and then realized I was supposed to add the egg.  So I beat the egg in quickly and it still thickenend because it was warm, so that turned out fine.  The middle was not so good....I added everything and found that it was too dry so I had to keep adding cream till it would mix smooth.  The bar tastes good but the middle is too creamy I think, it tastes very buttery the center.  It's got sort of a weird, I taste good but something is off...I don't know.  Anyway I cut them into small bite size pieces, because one is definatly enough, and froze the rest for Christmas baking.

Really good! One suggestion, do the chocolate topping as it says. I just melted chocolate chips instead and it didn't spread nicely at all so it looked really ugly on top, but still delicious!

I prefer making this recipe in a 9x9. The final product is a little thinner and easier to cut. Due to the thinner pieces, the richness of the bars isn't so overwhelming. Other than that personal preference, fantastic recipe! I've used this recipe for my Christmas baking for the past 3 Christmases and almost always get requests for the recipe from people who try them.

Absolutely amazing!  My roommates think they're so decadent.  I couldn't find dessicated coconut, so I grated a block of creamed coconut, and it worked wonderfully--the taste of coconut without the weird texture.  
To not crack the top layer of chocolate, dip your knife in hot water, wipe off, and be careful when cutting!

Being a transplanted native of British Columbia living in New Hampshire, I wanted to make something from back home for my office dessert day. These tasted absolutely fabulous but did not look as pretty as the ones I remember eating growing up. However this could simply be because of my own baking skills, maybe after a few more tries I will get it right. I too could not find custard powder in the grocery store although back in Canada it was always on the shelves. I will definitely make this again when I'm craving a taste of home. Thank you so much for the recipe, it brought back very fond memories.

These were fantastic!! i have always loved the store bought ones but everytime i had tried to make them, the bottom layer was too dry or there wasnt enough chocolate to cover the top. This recipe had the perfect amount of ingredients and it came out excellent. After stealing a piece of store bought naniamo bar christmas eve, i was shocked that it didn't even compare to mine! MMMM will defininatly make again :)

These are showy, tasty & always enjoyed. This is a classic Canadian recipe. I'm in Scotland so I use digestive biscuit crumbs instead of Graham cracker crumbs (which aren't available here). I'm giving them as gifts to my daughter's teachers this year for Christmas. :)Yum!

So far I'm only at my second layer, but I am very pleased with the outcome thus far. I didn't have custard powder, but instead used the same amount of corn starch (main custard powder ingredient) and a tbsp of vanilla, only later realizing that I could have used vanilla pudding mix. But either way, it is delicious. Can't wait to try em when it's all done

It was really good. The middle never set, so I mixed in the chocolate on top. I’d suggest making the bottom and the middle a day early and letting it chill overnight before adding the top layer.

These were very good, I’m only giving 4 instead of 5 stars because I had better when I was younger and it isn’t perfect, although quite good. My kids loved them, but I want a creamier filling.

These turned out great despite me being  inexperienced at baking etc. Every step was a learning experience so it took me longer. I followed the recipe, added the optional chopped almonds  and loved the taste. The next time that I make these, I will use slightly less coconut as my family are not big fans of it. I was sure glad that I was able to watch a video of this recipe.

I  always love making these yummy ,and very high sugar dessert for my family especially daughter and my grandson.  I have made it time after time at Christmas and it always turns out perfect each time. Unfortunately I have to use a bit smaller pan to accommodate my convection oven, but it just makes the bars thicker..thanks so much for the recipe that is always a hit for our Holiday Season desserts.????????????

Excellent.  I found the custard layer was a little sweet for me, but that's just preference.  I also tend to prefer eating them frozen, as it gives it a more chewy aspect (individually freeze or you'll have a problem getting them out of the pan), but I loved these.

I’m Canadian and looooove Nanaimo bars... I don’t know if it’s just variation from different provinces, but these didn’t taste right to me. First, I’ve always baked the bottom layer. Second, the centre part was just very sweet and all you could taste was icing sugar, no custard. And third, I had to almost triple the amount of chocolate in the recipe to get it to the right thickness. They tasted good, and they were still a hit with my friends, but just different from what I’m used to.

Luv the recipe and the tastes.  It is hard to believe that the picture comes from this recipe.  Why?  The top layer needs to be increased 1.5X to 2X in order to cover the top.  The bottom layer is also much thicker in my experience of making them 6 times.  So I would either shrink the bottom layer measurements or put in less of the optional items.  Overall, a great recipe and I'm thankful for it and will redo some more with the mods above.

These taste divine!!! However, i had issues with the base layer falling apart. I think when i make it again i will add less graham crumbs perhaps that will help. I also had to double top layer otherwise it would be very difficult to spread. I also scored top layer so chocolate wouldnt crack.

This a delicious treat. I didn't make any changes to it, but thought of replacing some of the cocoa with milk chocolate. Chocolate lovers dream, I myself like more milk chocolate. My loved it.

I did use vanilla bean paste instead and probably double the amount, as well as Callebaut chocolate.  The best Nanaimo bars I’ve ever had.

Doubled the recipe, did in a 11×15 pan. Proportions were perfect but the middle filling was boring and lack lustre. 
Doubled the amount of chocolate topping and split half milk choc. Half semi sweet, glad I did or the chocolate topping would have completly over powered the filling.  
The bars cut nicely, and look fantastic.

Don't know where I got my recipe from about 25 years ago, but this is essentially the exact one that I use, except I've always used Oreo cookie crumbs instead of graham cracker crumbs for an extra chocolate hit.  I put chopped pecans in the crust.  and as others have said, definitely beat the egg before you stir it in.  i add it slowly and stir hard to ensure it doesn't "cook".

These are really good.  I made these with my mom. We doubled the recipe. I forgot about the noneggcurdling tip but we just added the graham crackers in right away accidentally and it ended up being a good mistake because the eggs didn't  curdle. We also didn't have near enough conf sugar probably only half and it still turned out. I think I will try using 3 cups of conf sugar next time and add a bit of vanilla.

My boyfriend said it’s his new favorite dessert! I thought they were a little rich. The middle part is like a thick layer of frosting. The next go around I might try to lighten up the middle layer a bit. But honestly they are really really good as they recipe is written. Just don’t cut too big of a slice :)

Very good bars. Much like the ones my wife and I had in Nanaimo. However, the top two layers tend to separate from the bottom layers, so I'm going to revise the recipe a little to make things gel together better

These are delicious, and I followed the recipe except for the base layer. I was going to run out of butter for the second layer, so used coconut oil in place of the butter and it turned out just fine. 
Being an Aussie, I always have custard powder on hand and it gives the bars a great flavour.

I made exactly as is. I do add a teaspoon or two to my melting chocolate for a bit of a thinner spreading layer that’s it. Wonderful! Huge hit with everyone

Score the chocolate first and cut when firm so the filling doesn't swish out. I microwaved the chocolate with no problem. Just make sure you do it in 20 sec interments and stir to finish melting after about 50 percent melted.

These are amazing! We brought them to a party, and they were such a hit. A few tips: when the recipe says to add the egg to the hot mixture, I tempered it first by adding a few drops of the hot mixture to the egg and letting it get to the proper temperature before adding it to avoid curdling.  Also, we searched many stores for the custard powder, and the only place we found it was World Market. I recommend this recipe to all, and I hope those tips help!

This is bland and not at all sweet enough for my family.  If you are expecting a yummy eclair taste with a crunchy crust,  try something else. The recipe is clearly written and worked perfectly. The bars are  pretty enough when cut but have zero pizzazz when eaten.    The crust does have possibilities, but I think it needs twice as much sugar The boring custard filling needs vanilla or lemon or something to wake it up.  The frosting should be made with milk chocolate.   Those 3 changes might make it better for sweets lovers.  But as written, I just say no.

These are great.  I made a few adjustments though.  I used Oreo cookie crumbs instead of graham (omit the cocoa too) then I used unsweetened chocolate on the top instead of sweetened.  Try it!  It makes it much less rich so you can eat more haha.   That's how my mum used to make it when we were kids.  it offsets the overpowering sweetness of the bar and believe it or not, you do not taste the bitterness of the unsweetened chocolate.

Just like what I'm used to buying at M&M Meats in Canada. Pretty easy to make. Be sure the custard is well chilled before adding the chocolate topping

This was my first attempt at making these.. Although I have eaten them before. I made as written except used half Unsweetened chocolate and half semi sweet.. To offset the sweetness of the filling. The crust is super delicious, when making I did temper the egg first before adding into the mixture. When chocolate was half set I did Skor the top so it would make it easier to cut. I cut most without any broken tops. I ended up getting 36 pieces.. As I made them small. Overall tasty.. However I think the filling could be better... Something was off for me there. But the bottom and top layers are fantastic.

In my house, Christmas isn't Christmas with these bars (which we call Flanagan's Fancies).  Slightly different though - I use walnuts rather than almonds in the bottom layer and unsweetened chocolate for the top layer.  Either way, they are great

I wanted to make a traditionnal Canadian dessert and this recipe didnt disappoint. Every one loved it. The only thing the quantities for the top layers are way off. Double it at the minimum, I tripled it and it was perfect.

I saw a recent show that featured these and I wanted to try to make them. I love baking new things. I didn't have custard powder and wasn't in a hurry to make them so I ordered it through Amazon. As I started to make them, I realized my graham crackers were old, but I had a box of fresh chocolate graham crackers so I used those. I was also being distracted by my puppy and completely forgot the egg part in the crust. And lastly, the chocolate topping....word of advise....DOUBLE IT! I struggled to even get a nice layer over 1/2 the pan without seeing white. These turned out beautiful even with all my flubs and they are sure tasty. I will be making them again, the right way to get the full effect, but I'm positive they will be just as good if not better! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I made these exactly as the directions and the added Allrecipes.com video showed (without the added almonds) and they came out GREAT!  My husband says it is the best thing I have made in the kitchen yet.  I know I will be making these again!

I loved that there was  a video since I am a visual learner and could see what it should be looking like as I went along.

Fabulous! My first time making Naniamo bars. First batch of base curdled; I used the method suggested by many of adding the chocolate mix to the egg first, but must have still done it too fast. Second time I did it, I followed the recipe, adding the egg VERY slowly and wisking VERY quickly, and keeping the temperature low, which worked!
When making the middle layer, using an electric mixer helped make it fluffy, avoiding the density issue some have mentioned.
Only substitutes I used were walnuts instead of almonds and half-and-half instead of heavy cream, because that's what I had on hand. I did grease the pan with a bit of margerine as well, which helped them pop out a little easier.
I used a 9 x 9 inch pan instead, which gave me perfect proportions, and then cut into 32 bars. Added pictures as well.

I've made these twice and both times they were delicious beyond possibility. My only problem is trying to figure out how to keep them intact while eating. They want to separate top from bottom. But still...soooooo good.
I just made these again last week and jeezo are they good! Also, I didn't have the separation problem that I complained about and I think that is because I was more diligent in my prep process this last time.

Excellent recipe - consistent outcome. I substitute 2% milk if I do have any cream and chocolate chips if I do not have chocolate squares with no impact on outcome. Important to follow process as outlined to avoid curdling of egg and premature hardening of chocolate. Enjoy, a family favourite!!

Nanaimo bar deliciousness!! I had to add about a TBSP or so of melted butter to the bottom layer mix to get it to hold together, otherwise it was too crumbly. Use the back of a spatula and really press it into the pan. I also had to double the chocolate topping, and even then it barely covered the top. I really don't see how you could get by with the original. I did add the optional chopped almonds to the base, it makes a difference to the taste. I used Birds custard powder for the filling. These are amazing! They are rich... and addictive.

Awesome!  I pulsed the coconut in the blender to make a nicer texture.  Also, added a couple tsps of milk to assure the creamy texture of the middle layer.  These were exactly as I remember my mother's homemade ones.

I made this dessert with white chocolate instant pudding mix to replace the custard powder.  It was amazing and I won the dessert bake off with the most votes from the crowd.  It was so exciting to see the people rave about it at the party.

This recipe will be included among my most favorites. I made two recipes; 1 regular and the 2nd using peppermint in the icing base. It just wouldn't be Christmas without these tasty bars. As a foot note, the egg did curdle a bit but I whisked it quickly and it corrected itself.

First time making Nanaimo Bars, this recipe worked very well! I did the egg trick previous reviews mentioned and worked like a charm. Will be making these again for the holidays.

Love creating these for the office as they're always a hit, especially for those who don't know what Nanaimo bars are.   These suckers disappear FAST!   Highly recommend these for anyone looking for something quick and delicious

These were a big hit. The only problem I had was the top layer I had to triple the 1 oz 2 teaspoons to get enough chocolate to cover my 8x8 pan

I made these as stated in the original recipe and the taste was fantastic! Everyone who's tried them raved about how pleasantly sweet they were due to the semi sweet chocolate topping. The only thing I will change for next time is double the chocolate topping - I found the original recipe didn't give me enough chocolate to make a smooth top layer typical of most Nanaimo bars. Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first time making Nanaimo bars and I'll stick with this recipe.  Really good!! Tip - make sure each layer is properly chilled before adding the next layer. I put them in the freezer to speed up the process

I chose this recipe for a school project, and I did not expect it to be anything special, but WOW! It was not only easy to make, but tasted great too! All the kids loved it. Using the pudding mix was very good. Very close to tasting like an Almond Joy bar!

My husband loves these. I omitted the egg and used the microwave to melt the butter for the base and add all of the ingredients listed.  I didn't add the ground nuts either.  I also doubled the recipe and made 1/2 of the batch into mint Nanaimo bars (just added a little peppermint extract to 1/2 the filling and a tiny a little green food colouring).  Instead of baking squares, I used an 8 oz bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips melted with butter.

This is an amazing Nanaimo Bar recipe. I followed the recommendations of other users and doubled the center layer and tempered the eggs, which worked out well. I would recommend to other users (or myself in the future) to double or triple the middle and top layers to create a nice, thick bar. I made these for a potluck event and was chased around for the recipe. Next time I may consider using half Graham Crackers and half Digestive Biscuits. Oh Canada, you never disappoint me!

I am practicing to makes these for Christmas. My middle layer is completely blah. Should I expect it to be creamy? I thought it might be stiff since these are cut to individual bars.  The taste is good, but the texture of peanut butter is a little strange. I had a nanaimo bar many years ago. I don't think the center should mush a little. I'm going to try again! The taste is very good. If you have any tips tweet me @ yagwit!

This recipe has been in my family for over 30 years, and I can say it's as faithful to the original as it can be. 

Thanks for posting the recipe here! I was looking for a reference to the one I have and thankfully I found this one. Nanaimo bars are delicious!

I used unsweetened coconut, chopped pecans in place of the almonds and cut the sugar down a bit in the middle layer.  Doubled the middle and top layer as others suggested.  Beat the egg into little spoonfuls of the middle layer to avoid the curdling issue others referred to.  Not the best bar ever but definitely good enough to make again!  We weren't sure what to expect with these so maybe they will grow on us more and more.  Can't imaginer these without doubling middle and top layer

Bars turned out delicious!
For the crust I used graham cracker crumbs and baby (arrow root) cookies, crushed in the food processor, as well as almonds! I found the crust to be nice and think but I think I needed a little more butter. 
For the filling, I used the custard powder which is key. I did not have any whole milk, only skim, so I used 3 tbs of Carolans Irish Cream which was a nice addition!
I used an 8x8 glass pan and found I needed two more ounces or chocolate to make a full chocolate topping! Will definitely keep this recipe to make again!

This was great! The filling was quite soft though, so I would consider using another 1-2 cups of icing sugar in the filling to make it a bit more firm. I also suggest doubling the topping as other users have suggested. 
My reviews were all fantastic still

Love this recipe. I was out of graham cracker crumbs so I used Oreo. Made them a bit richer. These are super sweet and rich. Cut the pieces small. But they are SO GOOD! A labour of love to be sure - they're a pain in the butt to do properly but very worth it if you love your husband as much as I do. :)

I loved it! a few changes. i didnt add butter to the chocolate for the top layer, i just melted double the suggested amount of milk chocolate chips. then scored into squares to make cutting easier. worked perfectly. i used the custard powder for the middle layer, not vanilla pudding. I live in Washington and i found it a  cost plus world market. you cant find the custard powder in regular us grocery stores. so try a world market if there is one near you. i would like to make the bottom layer have a little bit of a crunch. im wondering if baking it, just like a graham cracker crust would help? it seemed too moist/chewy for me. and i think ill use walnuts instead of almonds next time.

I'm 12 years old and I made this recipe with ease! I didn't have a double boiler so I just stirred the ingredients and kept putting it in the microwave for 5 seconds then stirred it and repeated. It turned out sooooo tasty! I would put 1/3 cup less sugar in the filling and add it to the bottom layer. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! Very rich. I doubled the recipe and made in a 8 x 13 pan. I also followed the suggestion of one of the reviewers and used the digestive wafers instead of the graham crackers. I'm from Texas, so this was an unfamiliar dessert to me, but I know I'll be making it again. The family loved!
