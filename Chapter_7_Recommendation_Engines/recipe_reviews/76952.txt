This recipe is absolutely delicious... However, a few changes would make it perfectly to-die-for: 1) bake a graham cracker, or even better, a shortbread crust instead of the puff pastry, 2) Try to add some orange flavouring or grated orange zest to the chocolate mixture, 3) Bake it in a 8" tart pan for a thicker chocolate experience. Made this way, I think this recipe would really deserve 5 stars, at least.

Well, it seems that no one who has reviewed this recipe so far has actually made it as stated. I did. I chose this recipe because I had a sheet of puff pastry to use up. The only change I made was the size of the tart pan - mine was 11". To weight the pastry down, I used a 10" round cake pan and put a baking dish inside. I made the filling exactly as stated and it's delicious. I did top with homemade whipped cream and puff pastry hearts (made from scraps) with a little melted chocolate drizzled on top. This is a very elegant dessert. Seems a lot of people "fear the puff pastry" when there's no reason. This dessert simply wouldn't be the same in a graham cracker crust, but to each his own.

I made this because I had some extra puff pastry and a lot of extra cream - I made it as written and it is delicious and so simple to make. The texture of the chocolate filling is so silky and delicious. I really recommend using the puff pastry as the recipe indicates - it is so flaky.

I used a ready made pie crust for this rather than doing the puff pastry thing. It turned out really well. Very rich and decedant!  After about 6 hours in the fridge it had set enough to eat but it was much, much better the next day. It's by far the easiest chocolate tart I have ever made!

So easy!  I read the other reviews, and made this tart in individual-sized graham cracker crusts ($1.05 for 6), which cut out all the baking.  I also used about a half-teaspoon of orange zest, garnished with a few strands of orange zest curls, and got rave reviews for this Christmas dinner dessert!  I highly recommend this for anyone with very little time.  It probably took me 5-8 minutes to prep and then just stuck them in the fridge until I served them.

I did a slant on this recipe.

I used my own pie crust, divided it into 24 tart tin sections. Pre-baked the tarts.(using the "baking bind" method)Putting them aside to cool.

For the filling:
I used 2 cups of table cream 18%, 3/4 cup sugar, 2 eggs, 1/3 cup corn starch. Once that cooked over a double boiler(easy tip---> is to use an electric hand mixer set on the slowest setting for the long cook. About 20 minutes, on my stove)until thickened, I added semi-sweet bakers chocolate 4 of the 8 large squares. (approx. 4 oz) Slow beat mixture until all the chocolate was melted thoroughly and glossy.(about 5 minutes)I then pulled the pot off the heat and folded in 1 cup flaked/shredded coconut.  Spooned the the whole mixture into the cooled tarts with a small laddle to just below the main rim of each tart. Added a sprinkle of toasted coconut to the top........Placed the tarts in the fridge to set fully and cool completely. Wonderful goodness to my surprise.

This was a favorite at the party I made them for.  I made the tarts into tartlettes, topped with fresh whipped cream, and garnished with a fresh raspberry.  The filling was wonderfully rich and smooth.  I will definitely be making again!

I need to try this again.  It didn't set and just kind of oozed onto the plate.  While reading the other reviews I have decided I must have done something wrong.

very nice, I was looking for something to do with my egg yolks from another recipe and it was perfect.  I did use a grahm cracker crust instead though.

I just love this recipe, I've been making it for years- so simple yet elegant and tastes divine!  I use pie crust instead of the puff pastry and think it really needs the raspberries to cut through the richness.  I buy a pint of heavy cream and whip the remaining 1 cup to serve alongside.
