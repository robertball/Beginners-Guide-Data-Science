I’m not so much a fan of Alfredo when it’s not its true form. That said, this was relatively good. I don’t see the purpose of adding garlic powder and salt, when garlic salt could be used instead. Ultimately Parmesan is more than salty enough so the use of salt should be omitted or at minimum reduced.
