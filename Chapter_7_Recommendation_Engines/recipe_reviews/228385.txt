Great for a 30 min pressure cooker recipe but it needed more so .... I added a can of enchilada sauce (a secret weapon) cumin, chili powder, fresh jalapeño and red bell pepper, a small can of corn and half a can of black beans. I did not put the tomato mixture into the blender, I wanted it chunky. It came out delicious! Everyone really liked the addition of the cream. I also put in two large partially frozen chicken breasts, After the cooking process I removed them from the soup and shredded it.

A great recipe for tortilla soup.  Pressure cooker style is better than anything you can get at a restaurant.  The whole family agrees!!!!

I made this with chicken,  and I didn't blend the veggies. Great flavor, but next time I'll add rice (possibly beans) to make it a little heartier.

I used 3 fresh jalapeños vs the can of roasted jalapeños (I also left the seeds in) it is a tad too hot. but over was very good.  I think I'm going to pressure cook some chicken and shred it and add to it to give something more.  but overall it's a very good base!

Great recipe. Simple and turned out great! I do wonder if 1 table spoon of pepper is a typo? I did not add this amount as it seems like it would be a too much.
