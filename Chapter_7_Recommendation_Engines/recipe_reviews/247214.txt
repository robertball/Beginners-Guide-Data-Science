This jam is amazing! It really does taste like carrot cake in jam form. I included the optional coconut and golden raisins. I bought the ingredients and didn't get around to making the jam as planned, so when I decided to make it, I realized I did not have fresh pears. I substituted one cup of smooth, unsweetened applesauce. I didn't cook it for the initial 15-20 minutes because I didn't want to over cook the apples. I simply cooked it with the lid on until a lot of liquid was released. I also only used four cups of sugar and it is plenty sweet. Thank you!

As suggested, I used a cup of applesauce in place of the pears - worked great!  I used regular raisins, but wish I'd used the golden ones (these look like little bugs in my jam!)   With those modifications, I got about 8 half pints.  So tasty!  Will absolutely make this again.  **Added a year later**  I just made the recipe as written.  It was just as good, but a lot more work.  I will continue making it - just with the applesauce as opposed to the pears.

Very tasty and different! A bit too sweet, but next time I'll use 1 cup less sugar.  Great as a holiday gift and treat.

Absolutely delicious! Probably one of the best jams I've ever had. However the next time I make it, I'll prob cut the sugar to 5.5 or 6 cps, very, very sweet as written.

First time making this and used the advice of others. 1 cup applesauce and 5 cups sugar. I used my candy thermometer to make sure it reached 220 degrees! Will be making more tomorrow!

It is a pretty quick and easy recipe. It tastes good, but the pineapple seems to overpower the carrot flavor, which makes it taste a bit more like a pineapple cake than a carrot one.

YUM!! I made this recipe and it’s amazing. Only change I made was I chopped up apples in the food processor and used those instead of pears. It does taste like carrot cake I’m so addicted to it! Love this! Definitely give it a try.

I did substitute unsweetened applesauce for the pears as some suggested, but I also added one chopped pear for a bit of texture. I also cut the sugar to 3 cups (2 cups of white and 1 cup of light brown sugar). It does remind me of carrot cake, which is exactly how it was described, so my four stars isn't about it not tasting wonderful; I just prefer more savory or highly seasoned jams. I'd make it again and add additional spices. It's very pretty in the jar and will make a nice Christmas gift.
