I love this recipe and so did my young children!  I did have some substitutions.  I didn't use the onion salt or lemon wedges, but used garlic powder and lemon pepper on the salmon, in addition to the butter.  I left out the wine , the capers, the brine and used mustard horseradish and plain yoghurt instead of the sour cream.
I will make this over and over again.

This was really good!  I left out the butter and drizzled a dill, fennel flavored olive oil instead. I baked this on the BBQ instead of the oven and served it with orzo, chopped red pepper, green onion, zucchini, and some shredded parmesan.

I have never reviewed a recipe.  This one was a MUST! This was the BEST dill sauce I have ever had. I have tried replicating a local restaurant's sauce with no luck...which was the only reason I always ordered the salmon dish...for the dill sauce.  I am so pleased with this recipe, that now I actually like this one better. The only thing I didn't put in it was the onion and simply because I didn't have any.

The sauce was excellent. I will make it again. The capers were so yummy. I also used that dill in the tubes. So tasty.

Ok, to be honest I bought the raw stuffed salmon from Costco and was looking for a creamy dill sauce to pair with it...I was stoked to find this!  The sauce is to die for...and really, it's totally open to just add more or add less depending on your liking of certain ingredients.  I didn't have any white wine so I didn't add it and honestly I don't feel like it's missing anything.  I put about three times the amount of capers but left the caper juice at what was called for.  I also put much more dill.  SOOOOO good!  I'm making cheese tortellini to go with it all and plan to put the sauce onto the pasta.

Awesome recipe. I love salmon, but suck at cooking it so I've always had to buy the pre-done stuff which is not all that good or pay for an expensive restaurant dish that is good, but not something I can afford often. Biggest problem I have: my salmon always turn out to dry and whatever sauce I try never makes the dry salmon any better. This recipe takes care of *everything*. Succulent, juicy salmon and a sacue to die for. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing it. Now I can have affordable, yummylicious salmon any time!!!

Made this tonight and everyone seemed to love it. I used green onions instead of regular onions and chicken broth instead of the wine but otherwise followed the directions. I made extra sauce to stir into some pasta for a side dish. The salmon turned out wonderful and the pasta was creamy and flavorful. My husband didn't want to try at it at first because it had mayo in it but once I convinced him he loved it. So did the kids. Definitely going to make again.

We really liked both the salmon and the sauce.  I did double the dill and add 1/2 tsp of black pepper, while omitting the wine because I didn't have any on hand.  The only thing keeping this from being 5 stars is that the sauce was a little much for the fish.  My husband and I both agree that this recipe is a keeper- though in the future we'll leave the sauce off of the fish and save it for veggies.

This is so delicious and part of my regular dinner rotation!  I also serve over pasta with either asparagus or dill zucchini on the side. I don't cook the salmon in the foil, just bake in oven with just the seasoning and butter.  I never have horseradish, so leave that out of the sauce, and also rarely add the wine.  I double or triple the sauce as we're sauce lovers and want plenty for the pasta as well.  It's also a beautiful presentation!

Great and EASY recipe.  The only change I made was substituting minced garlic  for garlic salt.  I made it a meal by serving it atop saut√©ed spinach accompanied by a glass of Pinot Noir.

Great recipe. I skipped the capers and used prepared mustard instead of horseradish since that's all I had on hand. As others have mentioned, don't feel you need to follow this recipe verbatim. I think the salmon would've tasted just the same if you put salt, pepper and lemon wedges on it. At the end of the day it's the dill sauce that makes the dish.

The sauce is absolutely fantastic! Lots of zip and flavour! The only thing I changed was the white wine. I don't drink wine and know no one who does, so I can't justify buying a bottle for 1/4 cup. Instead, I used 1/8c of white wine vinegar and 1/8c of water mixed with 1/2 tbsp of sugar. This is a great white wine substitute for anyone out there like me. I can never taste the difference. Again...Fantastic sauce, DH and DS raved about it!

Sooooo good! Husband declared it gourmet, better than any he's had at any restaurant. Kids ate some, but they don't have sophisticated pallets yet. Followed the recipe except for the wine, I used white wine vinegar/water (1/8 cup each) and 1/2 TB sugar like other users suggested. And I garnished it with fresh green onion. Served over egg noodles tossed with the sauce, extra sauce on the salmon. Will definitely be making this again. And again.

This is one of my favorite ways to have salmon. It's fast and simple and the flavors all compliment each other. The dill sauce is such a welcome addition. I find that it's even a bit better when made in advance, and the sauce has a chance for the herbs and spices to mingle and merge together in the fridge. I keep this sauce available to top other fish as well, as it's very versatile.

The sauce was very tasty, yet very rich. I used only a tablespoon of mayo and that was enough. Next time I will cut the butter in half. I simmered the sauce without the mayo and sour cream. I used onion powder in place of the onion and garlic in place of garlic salt. I just baked my fish at 375, uncovered. Overall great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Restaurant quality. This might be my new favorite salmon dish, ever. The sauce was a little bland for our taste, so I bumped it up by tripling the dill, adding lemon pepper and cayenne to it. Thank you we enjoyed this today for Easter Dinner, it was fantastic!

This wasn't my favourite salmon recipe but it was still good. Followed recipe to a tee with the exceptions of using green onions rather than regular. I'm sure that however you choose to cook the salmon will not impact the outcome. In other words, you could just bake it or broil it. There was a lot of left over sauce. A lot. Not sure what I will do with it. I can't imagine serving it on pasta as the submitter suggested, that just doesn't appeal to me. I served it with a variety of sauteed veggies. Thank you for sharing Good EatNZ.

Excellent! Only made a few small changes - no salts instead used onion and garlic powder, no capers or brine  (didn't have any) and no horseradish (don't like). For the onions I used red. This was a 5 star dish. I have some dill sauce left over and can't wait to use it on fish tacos!

I followed this recipe exactly but I have to say I wasn't too pleased with the flavour.  It just tasted like mayo and sour cream.  Me and my family didn't like it that much, and I won't be making it again.  I guess this is a good recipe for people that like a cream sauce on their salmon.  For us, we prefer a light and fresh taste for salmon as opposed to a heavy cream sauce.

We liked it.....the sauce was a little runny but probably because I was a little heavy with the vino.  I did add more capers so we could have one with each bite.  Next time I'll lighten up on the salt since the lemon juice and dill seem to enhance the saltiness.  Great on toast points!

I didn't have capers so tried a few dill pickle bits.  Not bad substitution.  I think the capers would be milder flavor, so I didn't add much.  (didn't want it to taste 'pickly') It has a 'tarter sauce' flavor with the pickles, but it was good.

Great dill sauce. might cut back the wine to a couple of tablespoons just because of the kids not liking it.  Really love the capers and finishing the skin under the broiler was perfect.

Wow. This sauce is delicious and the salmon was made perfectly. Tenting the salmon before putting it on broil ensures the salmon cooks through and that it has a crust.

I was a bit skeptical with a ‚Äòcold‚Äô sauce but I made this exactly as written. It is the best sauce for salmon I have found! Do not alter! It complemented the salmon perfectly. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.

This was definitely impressive! The sauce with the salmon is my new favorite. We had it with lemon pepper cauliflower rice.

Oh my, this was delicious! & I used frozen pink Salmon( not considered the best quality salmon) 
For the sauce, I put the number of capers in the recipe & other ingredients in a blender. I added more whole capers on top of the salmon just before broiling. Also, I added a little cream, extra thinly sliced lemons.
Served with Kale mix salad, cantaloupe. Did I say delicious, restaurant quality recipe!

Hubs and 6 yo son loved it. This sauce is a keeper for sure.  I put it on the side as I feared it would be a bit strong flavored for a young palate but it was enjoyed by all.

My family and I love the dill sauce. Many reviewers seem to leave out the wine, but it really makes the sauce along with the horse radish and lemon juice.

I  made the sauce according to the directions, but used fresh dill (1 T).  I grilled the swordfish seasoned with onion salt and lemon pepper.  I tossed about 1/2 the sauce with linguine, then served the salmon on top, dolloped with more sauce.  The only change I would make is to double the horseradish.

This was a great dill sauce for the salmon I was serving!! After I mixed everything I tasted it and it was OK, but when it sat in the fridge for about an hour, that made all the difference. Tasted fantastic. The flavors just had to meld together for a little while.

I have made this several times now and it deserves a review.  The sauce is aMazing.  I can whip it up in no time, don't even really measure anymore, but its great and zesty.  It works well with other fish as well.

The salmon was "ok"but the sauce  "I loved"!!! Hence the rating "I liked it". We eat lots of fish but have not found a dill sauce we liked, until now. Changes in the recipe were, we don't drink so no wine in the house. Never used capers so pickle juice was my substitute. ??

Grilled fresh sockeye instead of the oven. Used Apple wood smoke, cut way back on the butter.  I'm usually a no recipe guy, but followed this one and my wife and I loved it.

Excellent recipe.  Easy, tasty, fragrant, and healthy. I omitted the onions, and substituted fresh grated gingerout for the horseradish. Also, marinated the salmon in lemon juice, white wine, fresh grated garlic, dill, and melted butter for 20 minutes, prior to baking.

The recipe is very tasty, but the baking time is way too long.  I would shave 5 minutes off the first bake time and 5 off the broil time.  I baked mine for the full time and only broiled for 5 minutes and it was overcooked

I made the dill sauce of my salmon burgers and it was a big hit. They only changes I made were to omit the capers, add onion powder for the chopped onions and I used fresh dill. I will definitely make this sauce again.

My family loved this recipe!  I had to make a couple of adjustments.  I didn't add any white wine since it was served to my 18 month old who couldn't get enough!  I didn't have any onion salt, I used a lemon pepper seasoning that already had onion and garlic and it worked well.  I used fresh Dill from my garden.  I also added a drop of honey to the sauce to add just a hint of sweetness.  Without it , the sauce was very bright and tangy and might overpower the flavor of the salmon.

This is a good start to the recipe.  You really have to tweak it to your taste.  I made it pretty close to exact the first time.  

Then I thought it tasted too much like mayo.  I threw half of it out, then added extra capers and caper water, extra horseradish and lemon.  

The taste was much better but still too much mayo.  Next time I will do 1tblsp of may instead of equal parts.  Aside from that I like it.  I also wonder how fresh dill would taste in it and wonder why they suggest dry.

First time I didn't bother with lemon pepper seasoning or onion salt as didn't want to buy just for this recipe.   And was delicious as is. Have even tried with just the mayo, sour cream, capers, dill and onion and was still great. Pre- portion frozen wild salmon from Costco makes it simple and inexpensive too.

The sauce was OK, flavor was good, but the consistency was very thin. As far as the salmon goes, I would say to cook it for a few minutes less. My filet was overdone.

Fish was good, however I agreed with the other review that it had too much of a mayo flavor.

Great result with the foil then broil technique for the salmon!  The flavors of the fish and the sauce were both great.  The whole family loved this.

This has become a staple recipe at my house. The only changes I've made along the way is doubling the capers (at least!) and cook it on the grill as opposed to oven. Delish!

We made a cedar planked salmon prepared in my usual way which was fantastic all on its own. This review is for that sauce! That sauce! It is not your ordinary bland creamy dill sauce that is reminiscent of ranch dressing with dill. The horseradish gives a bit of tang and bite without being hot at all. My 5yr old who cannot handle a speck of pepper loved it! The briney capers work so well with the dill. What a nice enhancement to fish that goes way beyond a squeeze of lemon and a sprinkle of dill.

I was looking for a salmon recipe and found this one. Was very happy I found it. I had all the ingredients and made it minus the noodles. Love it.  I eat a lot of fish and the salmon came out perfect and the creamy dill was wonderful. Going to a bbq tomorrow and will mix all into a dip and pick up some bread. I know it will be fabulous!

Great taste for the salmon.  I doubled the amount of dill because I used fresh herbs.  The sauce was used as a dressing on a side salad and my roasted spaghetti squash, too.  Fresh tasting meal.

My go-to salmon dish. I make it 2-3 times every Summer. Effortless to prepare and always impresses our guests. I usually serve with asparagus or brussel sprouts.

...and this from a guy who's "not a salmon person."

I make salmon often, but this recipe is the best...so flavorful, moist, and truly delicious.  Can't miss with this dish.

Another success with our daughter! Getting kids to eat fish is so satisfying.  The dill sauce was a nice, fresh detail.

We loved this. We made it just as written. Salmon could have cooked just a little longer for our taste but it was flaking like it is supposed to.  That dill caper sauce was oh so good.

My husband loved this!!! I added about double the horseradish in the sauce, just because my husband likes it spicy.  He told me I should use this recipe in place of the tartar sauce recipe.   Yum!!

Made it pretty much as advised.  Used lime instead of lemon, as I didn't have a lemon.  No horseradish, unfortunately, as I was out... horseradish would have been great.  The fish cooked nicely.  I will make this again.
