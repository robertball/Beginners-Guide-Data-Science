I always have an empty dish to bring home from dinner party when I bring this along. I like to throw in abit of oregano (dry/fresh - whatever you have on hand) along with a handful of diced up sun dried tomatoes (I use ones that aren't in the oil). I have used a combination of olives as well - and it turned out great. Make sure that you rinse your olives first tho' - it cuts down abit on the saltiness of the brine that they are stored in.

I added some roasted red pepper and artichoke hearts. I also added a bit more liquid due to the extra ingridents (red wine vinager). I took it to work at the caf√® and we slathered it on everything (exspecially some tuna burgers).

I admit I'm not a big olive fan, but my husband is, and even he thought it was just too olive-y.  I made it per the recipe, then after tasting added a can of black beans and blended well.  The colour stayed the same, but the taste was mellowed quite a bit.  I will make this again...but will add the beans!

You can also add other varieties of olives to this recipe with success.

This recipe is so simple to make and takes no time at all.  Each time I make this recipe its gone in no time at all and everyone wants the recipe.  Only change I made was I use 1 clove of garlic.

i discovered this recipe several years ago when i was in college. i have used it ever since and always get compliments and requests for the recipe. it is one of the easiest appetizers to make and the sharp taste will please any olive lover. note: make sure you drain the olives well so the paste is not to runny.

I love this.  I add a little red pepper and rub the mixture under the skin of a roaster and bake the chicken.  It infuses the chicken with flavor and the bird comes out moist with a great flavor.

You could even use canned black olives for this, but fresh is preferred. Followed this recipe to a T, and served it with pita triangles and tortilla chips. It is a little oily, but there was nothing left in the bowl afterwards. Thanks for sharing.

This was great!  We served this on wedges of pita bread.  It made a wonderful  appetizer - even better than a store-bought olive spread!

For a twist, I added a  little Dijon mustard.

Five stars for easiness! I love any recipe I can whip up in my food processor in under ten minutes. I reckon this tastes best paired with simple fare like celery sticks or other vegetables, as it's a strong flavour.

I followed the recipe exactly as written... maybe it was the brand of olives I bought, but I found this to be extremely salty... maybe if I had read FatCatAnna's recommendation to rinse the olives before blending it would have turned out better.... I hoping the company I will serve it to won't mind the saltiness.... otherwise it will have been a big waste of money.  Kalamata olives are pretty expensive!

excellent for an olive lover.  These olive recipes always seem to be a bit salty though.  I topped this on top of greek style hummus and served with pita triangles. I once added basil and that is good too.

I made this for a celebration for my daughter's high school graduation and it was a big hit! Everyone loved it. I made a slightly larger batch (using 4 cups of olives) and had a little left over. The next day, I cooked up some pasta and tossed with the Olivada...delicious!

A good chilling makes the flavors come out even better. I ate something similar at a microbrewery once; it was very garlicky and delicious. It must have been a mistake on the part of the cook, however, because subsequent orders of the olivada never tasted that strong again. Now that I have the ingredients and a powerful food processor, I'll never have to go without again!

Was not a hit.  We love the olives on our salads, but just couldn't stand the paste.
