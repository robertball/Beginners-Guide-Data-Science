My mom is in the hospital and has not been eating.  Spaghetti is her favorite meal so I took her some to get her to eat and she cleaned two plates!  I took the tip of melting the cheese on top and OMGosh it was so good.  Otherwise I didn't change a thing.  Simple to make and very very tasty!

I absolutely love this recipe!!! I had never made spaghetti/spaghetti sauce before, so I was a little nervous. I followed the instruction and it turned out perfect!!! I had a house full of family over and they LOVED it!!! I used ground beef instead of turkey, but everything else was the same. Thank you so much for sharing - my family is still talking about it, asking me to make more!

Hey Jan..... Thanks for sharing!! This is a lovely recipe. I added a couple cups of sliced mushrooms for texture .... aside from that I didnâ€™t tinker with it at all. This one is in my faves and will be revisited often

Yes I did. I had mushrooms to use up and added them as well. I followed the recipe exactly. I gave half of it to my friends girlfriend. I saw her yesterday and she told me it ws the BOMB... I was flattered when she told me this, cause Taylor is an outstanding cook. Thank you for sharing this great recipe, and now I'm going to make today and double it as well...

After boiling and slicing the sausage, I did throw it into the skillet (after draining the ground turkey) with the onions and garlic to brown it up a bit. I ended up mixing the cooked pasta with the sauce, then dumped it into a 9x13 baking dish and topped it with shredded mozzerella and a little parmesan cheese and baked it until the cheese melted. The family really liked it--all three boys went back for seconds. NOTE: This warmed the next day made EXCELLENT spaghetti sandwiches.
