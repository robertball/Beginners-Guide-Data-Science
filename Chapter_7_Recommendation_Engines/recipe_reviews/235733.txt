If you find it hardens too much reduce the time you boil the syrup. The syrup acts like candy syrup. The longer it boils the hotter it gets and the harder it is when it cools down.

sooo good, I didn't find it too chewy or hard as another reviewer commented but that can also depend on how long you cook your mixture...as soon as it starts to bubble, you are good to go.

I agree is dry and I made more syrup than recipe called for.  If like sticky would cut back to 6 cups puffed wheat.  I also got adventurous & added 1 tbsp course Kosher salt!  Chocolate & salt.......Delicious taste sensation!!

One of my favourites. Always a trick to boil the mixture for just the right amount of time so it doesn't go rock hard. I booked it for two minutes without stirring and it came out beautifully. Thanks so much!

I made a few changes based on reading the reviews saying that the squares turned out too hard. I used golden syrup instead of corn syrup, I added an extra tablespoon of butter, and I only used about 7 cups of puffed wheat. They were a little gooey when room temperature but they were perfect when refrigerated.

Iâ€™m disappointed in this recipe. First time I tried it I thought I had cooked it too long as it was rock hard. Tried it a second time and i just barely brought it to a boil. Still too hard and far too dry!

It was good, but I cooked it less than recommended so it wasn't rock-hard. A good treat to whip up for a play date!

Very yummy and easy for kids to make. Definitely reduce boiling time to 2-3 minutes if you like them chewy, and not too hard. I also added an extra tbsp of cocoa.

This is the classic, in order to keep the wonderful chewy texture after storage you really MUST use real butter and keep the boil time to around a minute. I never have a storage issue since this stuff disappears rather quickly in my house! Thanks for sharing this :)

This is a true classic and it is the one I grew up with and loved as a child (and still do). Having read the earlier review that complains about the overnight hardening despite being wrapped I was unsure but be assured while it does harden it is delicious and the chewiness of the hardened result is the desired result of this classic recipe. Thanks Alberta Gurl for posting it.

Taste delicious fresh but hardened quite a bit overnight despite being wrapped. Would consider increasing the mix or maybe adding a few marshmallows next time.
