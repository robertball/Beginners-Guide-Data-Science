This dish is deceivingly delicous!!!  When I told my boyfriend I was making it for dinner he wasn't too sure about pasta sauce over steak but after he tried it he couldn't believe the unique taste it had. The juices from the steak along with the wine totally change the flavor of the pasta sauce (I used chunky mushroom). I did cut the pasta sauce down to 1 1/2 cups and sauteed the garlic with the onions, and served it over garlic mashed potatoes as suggested.  It was WONDERFUL!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I can't say enough good things about this recipe.  Not only was it delicious it was so simple to put together.  I can see myself making this at least two or three times a month.  Thank you SO much for sharing this!

This recipe is delicious.  I serve it frequently over garlic mashed potatoes.  Sometimes for a quick meal, I evev use the instant garlic mashed.  The sauce has a wonderful flavor that transforms itself and tastes nothing like the original pasta sauce.  I also was worried that it would taste like "spaghetti sauce with steak strips", but it doesn't.  It's a great recipe and part of our monthly rotation.

Wonderful recipe! The wine is key, I think, in making this not taste like pasta sauce on beef. I did mine in the crockpot (with no precooking) and it tasted wonderful. Served over a garlic mashed cauliflower/potato combo with steamed green beans on the side.

This is awesome when served on top garlic mashed potatoes; I wouldn't have it any other way!  I've never had this turn out tasting like spaghetti sauce, and always use Ragu Chunky with Mushrooms.  Sometimes I add mushrooms too, after the onions start to caramelize.  If you find this tasting like spaghetti sauce, as some reviewers have experienced, try adding in a beef bullion cube as it simmers... also stay away from basil-rich sauces!

My 9 year old said this was delicous, but my other 9 year old, my husband and myself was not crazy about it at all.  I would give it a 3, but I think I put too much garlic in it which is my fault, it was still very bland though.  If I have big steak I need to use, I may try this again.  Thank you for sharind!!

Great recipe, definitely a keeper!  Watch cooking time though; I used thin slices and I like med rare steak so I cut the sauteeing and simmering time by about half.  Thanks Lanelle for a simple and delicious recipe!

Decent, but not great. I did not serve it with the potatoes, as suggested but with noodles. This MAY have contributed to it tasting like spaghetti with a different type of meat. But really, I don't think the potatoes would have made that much of a difference. We did like this, but honestly, with the cheaper price of ground beef, I think I may stick with that instead of the expensive steak.

I love this recipe!  My kids and husband like it too.  Sometimes I use chicken instead of beef.  I will take boneless breasts, and cut them in strips, like you would do the meat. I do let it simmer a little bit longer, as chicken takes longer to cook.  I usually serve over egg noodles.  Chicken or beef, this recipe is really good.

My husband and I tried this recipe out for a dinner party.  We ran out of time in our preparation and weren't able to have it with the garlic mashed potatoes as planned.  To be honest, we were not that impressed.  It tasted like spaghetti with sirloin instead of meatballs.  Probably won't make this again.

Very good and yummy! I cooked this in a crockpot and it came out great. I did add some diced tomatoes, 1/4 cup of cream cheese and some diced green peppers. Served it over some farfalle noodles and topped with parmesan cheese. This was yummy! Will definitely make again.

This was okay. I felt like it was missing something. Next time I will add mushrooms to see if this will do the trick.

The wine really makes the jar pasta sauce taste "grown up".  I used stir fry strips from the butcher to save prep time, and served over thin spaghetti.  This is going in the regular rotation!

Made this in a big hurry one night. The wife and I were truly surprised at how good it was! We didn't use store bought pasta sauce though ...rather made our own batch using tomato sauce and spices. Will definitely make this again!

I cut the recipe down for 2 servings (based on how much meat I had).  I didn't have red wine so I used red wine vinegar instead.  Delicious!!  It's true that once this has time to cook through a bit in the skillet (the sauce will turn a brown color as opposed to its original red) the taste is completely different.  It's not pasta sauce with steak - it's a new, combined flavor that is wonderful.  I will be eating this with angel hair pasta since I don't have potatoes available.

This is good and super easy. I made it as written, caramelizing the onion and adding a little worcestershire sauce. We had it on Sour Cream Refrigerator Mashed Potatoes from this site. Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good - I had leftover steak so I used it instead of uncooked. Someone suggested caramelizing the onions so I did and that was yummy. I liked the red wine too - added some depth.

Bland even though I only used 1 1/2 cups spaghetti sauce and added mushrooms, dried basil and brown sugar.  The steak was also way over cooked, even though I only cooked and simmered it half the recommended time.  Will try the recipe one more time but only half the recipe so I don't waste the sirloin steak.  I will add more wine and  spices, and will not simmer the steak in the sauce.  I will just add the meat just before serving.

boyfriend surprised me with this fantastic romantic dinner. the garlic/onion/wine taste combination is to die for, and garlic mashed potatoes are the perfect complement. be very careful about not overcooking the steak, but i'm going to make this for his mother the next time she's over!

I used Mid's Pasta Sauce, added fresh mushrooms, fresh oregano, basil, and parsley. I also used about a cup of merlot. The meat was very tender. A new twist on my old spaghetti sauce. Served with pasta instead of garlic mashed. Very good!

Very good -- husband really liked it!  Followed recipe except added sauteed mushrooms.  Next time will reduce the amount of spaghetti sauce to 1 1/2 cups.  Final result was a little too saucy but taste was good.  Update:  Add salt and pepper to beef while browning.

This was delicious. I didn't have any redwine, so I experimented and used frozen grape juice concentrate instead. I also added a few dashes worchestershire sauce, and pinch of brown sugar. It turned out wonderful. I also added mushrooms. I'm not sure how it was supposed to taste with red wine, but I really liked the end result with grape juice.

This was great!  And easy to make!  I cut the meat into bite sized pieces and added some cut up asparagus.  Served it over pasta with parmesan cheese and cheesy garlic bread.

I didn't have any red wine to add, and I'm not sure how much that affected the recipe. Regardless, it turned out pretty tasty.  I will be making this dish again in the future.

I preseasoned and browned the steak in olive oil first, set aside then sautéed the onions in the same pan with the drippings, returned the steak to the pan and followed the recipe from that point. Excellent results!

I didn’t have high expectations but it blew me away! I had all the ingredients on hand so I decided to make this for lunch. Added mushrooms and it turned out super good! I used chunky garlic pasta sauce and leftover Cabernet.

This was incredible! My husbands comment before trying was, “the house smells like a high end restaurant.” I added bell pepper after cooking the onions and before the beef. Only true change other than I never actually measure unless I’m baking. Served over garlic mashed potatoes. I will definitely make again.

This dish has become a regular for us...as well as a quick company dish when needed!  I have served it over mashed potatoes, rice, or wide egg noodles and regardless, every last morsel has been eaten every time!  I generally use a low cal pasta sauce with a slightly sweet flavor and we love the taste.  I have skipped the wine, and it is still very good.

This is a great dish! The key to it not tasting like spaghetti sauce is to use the wine. I also added basil as well as cooked the garlic with the onions. When I remake it, I may allow the sauce to simmer awhile before adding the meat so that all of the flavor shave time to marry.

My whole family liked this one. I sprinkled some beef bouillon over the beef before adding the tomato sauce and then a few shakes of worcesteshire as some had suggested and it was delish! I used Ragu Chunky GardenStyle sauce and served over Simply Potatoes garlic mashed. A little bread to sop the sauce and you have a really nice weekday skillet dinner.

Yum! I was looking for an easy recipe that used beef tips other than my mother's beef stroganoff and this was wonderful! I prepared as instructed, only added some salt and Italian seasoning to spruce up the sauce. Otherwise perfect! Thank you.

this was quick, easy, and great for my leftovers.  I had leftover sirloin from the bbq a couple days ago, so I didn't have to cook it quite as long.  I also had regular marinara and just added a can of mushrooms.  it all came together great!

This recipe sounds good, but the name is totally wrong. Marinara denotes that the recipe is based on having fresh SEAFOOD in the dish or sauce. I think this should be re-named Sirloin Napolitana, as the sauce is typical of a Pasta Napolitana dish.

I was very pleased with this recipe. I could not tell that I had made it with spaghetti sauce at all! It was very tangy and flavorful. I tried to use one of my better wines because I was using store bought sauce but I think it would have been good regardless. I too made garlic mashed potatoes and it was awesome. My husband devoured it. It was VERY simple and quick to make too. No doubt that this will be a frequent dinner at my house.

Horrible!  I made this for my roommates and our respective boyfriends last night and we all hated it.  The steak is cooked for way too long and sauce was just not appealing.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and that was the only thing that people went for seconds for.  Try this recipes before you serve it to anyone else.

This was okay, nothing to rave about, but nothing to complain about either.  Hubby and I liked it but my children were not too jazzed about it. I served it over Cowboy Mashed Potatoes from this site (which we all loved) and roasted buttercup squash. I probably won't be making this one again.

This showed up as an idea for dinner right before I left work for the day.  I just so happened to have EVERY ingredient in my kitchen.  I made it for dinner.  It was absolutely delicious.  My husband said, "You can make this recipe again!"  So that's a good indicator of how delicious it was.  This a definitely a restaurant-quality meal!

Steak and pasta is a favorite at our table. Sauteed mushrooms along with the onion,  set them aside, then sauteed some venison steak for just a couple minutes.  Next time I'll heat the sauce before adding the onion and steak to be sure the steak doesn't overcook.  I agree with other reviewers that the wine makes all the difference!

I loved this dish.  I used the ingredients as listed but I did not follow the instructions.  After sauteeing the onions I removed them from the pan.  Then I browned the sirloin in 2 batches  so that the meat wouldn't sweat and browned better. I removed the meat then sauteed the garlic briefly.  I used the wine to deglaze the pan.  Then I added all the ingredients together and simmered as instructed.  I served it over white rice.

It was good!. BTW, the name marinara has nothing to do with seafood or any meat. It is a tomato based sauce.

I have a recipe exactly like this, but instead of pasta sauce, the recipe calls for PIZZA sauce. I tried it once with pasta sauce (the pasta sauce is less expensive) and it tasted like spaghetti with steak. For those who thought this recipe tastes too spaghetti-ish, try it with pizza sauce and see what you think.

I'm not sure how anyone thinks this tastes like sirloin spaghetti. If anything it tastes closer to swiss steak. I opted for serving with galric mashed potatoes as suggested and I really am not sure I would want it with pasta.

The wine and the sliced onion made this IMO. I ended up having to cook it longer though (keeping it warm till everyone was ready for dinner) and the steak wasn't very tender. I'm guessing that's at fault. I will definitely make this again. It's not gourmet but it's a decent quick meal.

Very easy and delicious!  We are trying to eat less carbs so I served it with cauliflower rice instead of potatoes and that worked great!  Since I didn't have any pasta sauce, I used tomato sauce!  Both worked well!

I used marinara sauce and didn't add the garlic, but served the dish on garlic mashed potatoes. It was delicious, quick, and different. My 1 year old son loved it. That always gets 5 stars.

This has quickly become a favorite of mine.  A few slight modifications I like: Cook meat rare and add sauce, then after pasta is done, put everything together and let simmer for an extra 10 minutes or so.  Also, add worchestershire sauce along with a peppery Zinfendel and extra ground pepper, it inherits a nice kick.

This was quite good.  I served it with spaghetti. Top sirloin certainly has less fat than meatballs.  The whole family liked it - kid tested, adult approved.

I made this tonight... I had the sirloin steak but didn't know what I was gonna do with it. I picked the right recipe! Even my 1 year old keeps saying more. Of course I omitted the wine... just used a couple different kinds of jarred pasta sauce. I didn't have any cloves of garlic so I used some powder. I'm sure it would've been AMAZING with the ingredients called for. I will be making this again. Thanks for the post!

I had one doubt after another while making this (too much pasta sauce? is the steak going to be over cooked?) but I stuck to the directions and it came out wonderfully. I made this as celebration dish for my husband and I think he loved it more than I did. (Mission accomplished!) Thanks for the dish!

tried it and it was good.  it didn't taste like spaghetti sauce with steak in it the way i made it.  I sauteed the onions for much longer, pretty much  caramelizing them before throwing in garlic, and then the meat.  then i used a regular marinara sauce and about a cup of red wine.  i served it over rotini or bowtie pasta instead of mashed potatoes or spaghetti and it was pretty good

Very good!  Browned the beef in two batches to help it along.  Instead of "pasta sauce", used a large can of crushed tomatos and jazzed it up with some herbs.  We had it over pasta and now want to try it over the potatos (sounds really good).  HEARTY.

Deliciously different! I do agree that it takes like steak in spaghetti sauce to an extent, but we liked that. This isn't something that I would serve to company, however, as it is something rather different. My teenagers didn't like this but hubby and I did. Thanks.

There is a restaurant by my house called Sevilla Spain.  The only reason why I go there is for the beef medallions.... This recipe was so similar to that of the restaurant...I will never have to go there again!  I used DelMonte Tomato & Basil sauce and followed the recipe exactly, except I seasoned the meat with garlic powder before sauteing.  The meat was a little overcooked for our liking, but that is easily adjusted.  The biggest problem we have encountered is what to do with the leftover sauce.  Thank you so much for my new favorite dinner!

I personally couldn't get enough of this dish!  My husband was okay with it.  I had leftover red wine, pasta sauce and some tomatoes from my garden that I used to make the sauce "chunky".  It was perfect with Garlic Mashed Potatoes.  This recipe came at just the right time!
