I should preface by saying that I did not have high hopes for the flavor of this cookie, as the batter tasted very bland.  I upped the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp, added 1 tsp. vanilla, and added half cup of mini chips.  The batter is very soft but does drop well with a cookie scoop.  They appear as though they spread alot, but the result is a nice soft cake-like cookie with a very good flavor with lots of surprises inside.  They actually did not spread much on the cookie sheet. I would up the date/cherry amts. a bit if I did not have mini chips.  Great way to use up some of the holiday bake hangers-on when one is out of butter.  Used butter flavored crisco.  thanks for the quick and easy recipe.
