the salsa was ok ; but to be honest didn't seem to go with a brat . It would have probably stood a better chance of working as a macaroni salad ; as a topping for a brat it lay somewhere between ok and ick . Wouldn't ever make the salsa again as a topping for a brat .

My husband raved about this salsa.  I could not find the Bob Evans brats at the grocery and had to use another brand.  We also had fresh green chiles from my sister who lives in New Mexico.  I cannot wait to try this on a hamburger, it was excellent!

I made this with delicious Bahama Mama brats made by Schmidt's, a Columbus, Ohio restaurant/brat producer. They are SO good. I just eyeballed the ingredients, adding more or less of what I wanted as I was making it just for Husband. He really loved them.

Oh I like this!  We used turkey brats, which we always do.  I enjoyed the combination of flavors and it was refreshing to put something different on my brats.  Great way to jazz them up!

This recipe was outstanding!!  I wasn't able to find the proper brats, but used spicy italian sausage instead.  The salsa was a great addition.
