Super Yummy!!! I added some mushrooms in the mix with the broccoli. Also added some bread crumbs on top for some extra texture.   Thanks for sharing this recipe!

A great dish! I used more cheese than stated and cut the rosemary back to 1/2 tsp ground.  It fed m y family of 7 generously.  My daughter took the recipe home.

I followed some of the other suggestions, I added saut√©ed mushrooms, onion, garlic, and celery and added into the broccoli/chicken mix.  I left out the rosemary, but added dried parsley, basil and crushed red pepper. And breadcrumbs/stove top and grated Parmesan on top.    I thought the flavor was very good, but mine came out way too soupy.  I think next time i will add more veggies and leave out the extra water and may cut the amount of canned soup down to make it more like a lasagna.

This recipe is awesome!  I made it exactly as stated with only a few small changes.  Used fresh broccoli and instead of 2 cans of cream of ckn soup, I used only 1 and used 1 can of cream of broccoli, then the other can of cream of mush.  Also used about 1/2 C. more Swiss cheese.  This recipe is a winner.  I really was questioning the Swiss cheese since most lasagnas that I know of use mozzarella.  I went on faith and it turned out great.  This recipeis a keeper!  Thank you Melissa.

I thought this was just ok.  I might have expected too much out of it.  I probably will not make this again.

Made this lastnight! And will be making AGAIN for sure. I made it as directed for the most part.I made it with no boil noodles and fresh broccoli. And because I was using more chicken and broccoli I used 4 cans and about 2 1/2 cups of broth. I baked off my chicken in chicken broth with seasonings so I just used that. No need to waste anything! I shredded my chicken and put into the "sauce" put atleast 2 cups of that on the bottom if not more of the pan.The bottom noodles tend to burn when I use the no boil noodles.I was smart about it this time! :) Then I layed four noodles,sauce placed broccoli,then put down my shredded cheese.Did that for 3 layers.It turned out SO yummy! My husband ate TWO full plates. And it was a hit for the kiddos!(3&5)So it was great for the whole family!! :) Thanks for the yummy advice!

Yum!  I made this as directed for a bridal shower, as well as a pan of veggie lasagna.  My only complaint is that the lasagna seemed a little too runny, although after sitting it was better.  The flavor was great.  Thanks for a keeper.

This was a great simple recipe but i made it even simpler for myself. Instead the cream of chicken and mushroom and chicken broth i used a couple jars of alfredo sauce off the shelf. I had a hard time finding shredded swiss so i used thin slices and made it a layer in the construction. I did use an italian cheese blend as well as some mozzarella. I blended that with some broccoli rabe, broccoli and spinach.  I i followed some other suggestions and sauteed some onions, celery, garlic and baby ports. i mixed that with my alfredo and cubed chicken for a fantastic sauce. Once i put it all together and put it in the oven it came out great!! My roommates loved it!

Very good. I used fresh broccoli. Added yellow bell pepper, garlic salt, parsley, and Hatch salsa.  I didn't have swiss cheese, so I used Colby Jack and mild chedder on top.  It came out very runny. Not like a lasagna at all. Tasted great though!

Wonderful. The only thing I did different was to use a chicken seasoning that I had for the chicken instead of the seasoning salt. And I only used about 8 oz. of chicken broth since someone else said it was a bit runny. It turned out perfect. One of our new favorites.
