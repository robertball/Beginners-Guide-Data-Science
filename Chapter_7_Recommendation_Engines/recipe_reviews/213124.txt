I made this for a party and got endless compliments. I used canned chili peppers which made it really simple, and it still tasted great. As written it makes two large cheese balls so i cut the recipe in half. yum!!

Serve at room temperature with plain white corn tortilla chips.  You will taste more of the blended flavors at room temp.

Outstanding!  A real 'guys' cheese ball, but the women seem to like it too.  I like it with a covering of crumbled bacon, but wife prefers the pecans.

Just served this at a party, & my guests adored it. I did make a few changes: i used a can of green chilies, and used 1/2 & 1/2 cheddar & pepperjack, it really seemed to add a nice depth of flavor. i also added a little cumin & chile powder. the pecans didnt appeal to me with this; i simply added in about a cup of chopped cilantro. thank you for an excellent base, this will be a party staple from now on!!

Delicious!  I made half the recipe and, unfortunately, it was raining outside so I had to char the peppers on my gas burner.  To make up for the "smoky" flavor of the grill, I added cumin but I actually added it to some raw pecans as they were toasting for outside of the cheese ball...turned out fabulously.  It was delicious today; can't wait to try it tomorrow.

This recipe is a great appetizer.  I made mine in log (4 count) shapes instead of ball.  More pecans and a cleaner presentation.  Family favorite.  The flavor is better the next day and the day after that.

I made these into individual cheese balls for our party.  Served with a variety of crackers.  We liked the wheat thins the best.

This is awesome. I made it for Christmas so I added red bell pepper and green onion for colors and more flavor. And my husband can't eat nuts so I crushed up garlic croutons and rolled the cheese ball in that. It was the hit of the party.

WOW!  Great cheese ball loads of flavor.  There is a little zip to it but was not overpowering.

I halfed the recipe and it was absolutely delicious. Brought it to a holiday get together and everyone wanted to know how to make this. It literally took me like 10 minutes to make although I used the can roasted green chiles :) I served it with two different specialty crackers and carrots. I will definitely make this again. So easy and delicious.

Made this as an appetizer for Father's Day.  The only change I made was to not use the pecans.  This recipe was a big hit!  Everyone loved it.

Absolutely delicious. I used Bueno Chopped green chili and it made it a little easier. This recipe made enough to make 3 decent sized cheeseballs.

This makes a gigantic cheese ball...I cut the recipe in half, made it into two logs (so pecans last longer) and I added chopped sun dried tomatoes.  A hit!
