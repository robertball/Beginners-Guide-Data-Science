Great way to jazz up plain old pretzels.  I used only 3/4 cup of butter and they turned out perfect.  To blend, I put my pretzels in a ziploc bag and poured the butter mixture inside; sealed it up and tossed to coat.  Got great coverage that way.

I have been looking for this recipe for years! I used to have these when I lived in Pittsburgh and loved them! Yes, they are salty and all, but that is one of the things that makes them so good! I am so excited to find this recipe! Thank you southernbelle19!!!! These are so so so so wonderful with beer. Thanks!

I don't know how my experience could have been so different than so many other reviewers.  I thought that I would love these.  Followed directions exactly except that I mixed the ingredients together in a bag first as many reviewers suggested.  After only about 40 minutes of cooking these looked like they were burning.  After taking them out and cooling, they tasted dreadful.  Burned and bitter.  Sorry.  We will not make these again.

Instead of butter, I used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil (so there's less of a chance of it going rancid before we eat it and to cut back on the fat just a bit) and I used my own homemade MSG-free/reduced salt onion soup "mix". A whole bag of "tiny twists" was perfect for this recipe. This was great, though I'd like to add some dill next time. That's a personal addition, no reflection on the original recipe. We all enjoyed these at family movie time.....even the husband! NOTE: Definitely don't skip the baking step. You might have an issue with soggy pretzels later if you do. Whatever you don't eat will keep well in air-tight Tupperware or freezer bags.

I'm sure these would have turned out a little better if maybe I cooked them longer.  Reading everyones reviews before I made them had me so nervous about burning them that I think I undercooked them so they were kind of stale more than they were crunchy.  Either way they still had a really good flavor to them.  I'll definitely make these again but just cook them to the time in the recipe as opposed to going by what others have said.

It's important that you transfer these into a big zip loc bag and let set for two days.  - I used a bag of thin stick pretzels.  Also I used 1 stick of butter along with all the other ingredients.  They were great!  I baked them at 175, it's the lowest temperature on my convection oven and stirred every 15 minutes until I could tell some were going to start turning too dark/black. Transfer into a zip bag and let set for 2 days.  They are addictive!

Easy and tasty! I used 20 ounces of dipping sticks. I just tossed them in a large bowl (one bag at a time) and spread them on a full sheet pan. I only baked for 45 minutes. Fun snack for poker night!

Konwal, I feel your pain. I had a similiar experience. The butter mixture did not stick to the pretzels. 250 is a very low cooking temperature but the pretzels burned regardless. As written, I cannot recommend this recipe.

This is my second review.  I made these for Christmas gifts this year and here it is December 27th and I have already had a request to make some more for a friend's grandchildren who ate the ones I gave him!  These are so good.  I have to put them in another room so I don't eat them all.

These were ok to me, my freind loved them.  It is a good idea, but I didn't really care for the tast of these.  I didn't cook them but about 45 min cause I didn't want them to burn.  I doubt if I will make these again.

These are great! This is my #1 snack (although my husband doesn't care for them OR my breath while I eat them :-) ). I add a tbsp of seasoning salt to the butter mixture, and I also use about 3/4 of the amt of butter called for. Wonderful!

My second batch! And so far I've just used regular pretzel twists and sticks.(not sour dough) Followed the recipe except not using sour dough pretzels and worked out just right. After the butter mixture was ready I had pretzels in a large zip-lock bag and poured it in and rolled them around a bit til all the sauce was soaked in then threw them in the oven. Very easy recipe & I have had lots of compliments on how really good these are. I've got to try the sour dough kind because I'm sure they'll be even better!
Thanks for submitting!

Even small clumps of dehydrated onion burned and developed an acrid taste within 45 minutes. It wasn't pretty either. I think this would work better with a more granulated mix like ranch and some time/temp tweaking.

I had to improvise a bit since I was at bf's parents house.  They don't have all the ingredients and although I've made dry onion soup mix before, I didn't want to make it anyway--his parents can't have a lot of sodium, so I used Mrs. Dash instead. This worked just fine; although I made it a bit too spicy. I have to agree that you should watch the time depending on your oven.  I'm not familiar with bf's parents oven and I think 1 hr was too much; they tasted a little overdone but its easy enough to just test each time you stir them.  the parents really enjoyed them.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for the 4th of July and I didn't have any left. I used sourdough pretzels, put them in a bowl and poured the mixture over them and mixed them up to distribute it evenly. I baked them according to the recipe and mixed them every 15 minutes.  When they were done, I laid them on some wax paper to cool.  Definitely will make again!

I made these for a savory snack at my wedding.  I ended up giving this recipe to a lot of my guests.  It was easy.  A great thing for my 10 year old step son (who always wanted to help) to be able to do most of.  I did turn down my oven so as not to chance the burn that some commented on.  It turned out great!!!  Thanks so much for this recipe. It will make it in front of our tv for nascar and football.

These are positively addicting!   I don't see these lasting for very long in our home or if I take them to a party somewhere!    I used a 16 oz bag of small traditional twist pretzels, along with 1/4th of another bag for 20 oz.   I prepared butter mixture as stated but cut the garlic by 1/2 tablespoon (personal preference).    I had pretzels waiting in a large bowl and I poured warm (not hot) butter mixture over the pretzels, stirring to coat.  I placed them on a large jelly roll pan and baked for 15 minutes at 250 deg.  I noticed they were browning, so I turned the oven down to 200 for the next half hour, then turned it up to 225 the last 15 minutes.   I can't say enough about how fabulous these taste!   I don't give out 5 star ratings often, but these pretzels deserve it!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Had pretzels similar to these at a party we attended over the summer.  I made mine with the thick sourdough pretzels broken into pieces and 1/2 cup of butter.  I might try with a thinner pretzel next time.  I did use the plastic bag method mentioned in other reviews to mix, but I think that next time I will put in a mixing bowl to see if the butter mixture distributes a little more evenly.  Good recipe - thank you.

These were prety good.  Used sourdough nibblets and less butter - it could have used even less butter though.  I also used more hot sauce than called for and less garlic powder and Worcestershire.  Next time I might use ranch dressing powder dip in place of the onion soup mix also.  But verrrry addicting, especially with a beer!  =)

Everyone loved these pretzels! They were a big hit.  Initially when I took them out of the oven, They didn't taste any different then normal pretzels.  However, the next day they were full of great flavor. Great recipe!!

I used bite-sized sourdough pretzels. I also only used  about 3/4 cup of butter and a chipotle flavored hot sauce.  I spread the prezels out on 2 stoneware pans so they had plenty of wiggle room.  Baked up deliscious and were perfect with BBQ ham sandwiches and cold beer!!

These are great and super-easy!  I used small (not sourdough) pretzel rods just like in Late2Class' photo, decreased butter to 3/4 cup, shook the whole mixture in a large baggie, started oven temp off at 200 and gradually increased to 250 avoid burning.  Salty? ...well, yeah - it's a bar snack.  Excellent w/the frosty adult beverage of your choice.  Thanks for sharing!

A nice cold beer, a Jayhawk victory, and handful of Bar Stool Pretzels-- I dont think it could have been a better night.

I cooked the sauce, dumped it into a ziplock and poured the pretzels into the bag.  Then I dumped it all onto a large cookie sheet and thought I've messed up, seemed like there was way too much of the wet mixture in the pan.  But they actually turned out great, full of flavor, even my husband who is not a fan of spicy, seasoned foods, thought they were very good.  I plan on having bowls of these over the holidays - something different from the "same old thing"!

These was great! I did these in 2 batches and made one slightly hotter. To make them crunchy without burning I cooled them then baked another 30 mins.

I used one box of the Snyder's big pretzels, one cup of butter and a envelope of onion soup mix crushed. Melted the butter in a pan, stirred the soup mix in and poured over the pretzles.  Baked at 250 for 1 1/2 hours, stirring every 1/2 hour.

It is hard to put these things down! They are mostly great, but like others, I would have burned them if they baked for 1 hour.

I followed the recipe to the letter. They are ok. I would suggest 1/2 the butter because they taste soggy. I cooked them for 1 hr stirring them every 15 minutes. i only used a dash of Tabasco but you cannot taste it I think maybe a 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper may work better if you want hot. 

I tried this as a second option we often make a ranch pretzel instead. I will post if I cannot find that here.

I am baking some as I write this and the smell is heavenly.  I don't even have to eat one to know that I will love them.  I can't wait for my husband to try them, he's gonna go crazy for these.  Thanks for the great recipe.

thought recipe was great! the only thing i change, was the pretzels. used nugget sour dough pretzels, put all the ingredence in a medium size bowl, then just dumped a 16 oz. bag . mix around large spoon, dumped on a sprayed sheet pan. put in oven, and every 15 min, pushed them around on pan. on the third mixing them around cut off oven and left them till cool. useing nuggets no painting on mixture and easier to eat.
