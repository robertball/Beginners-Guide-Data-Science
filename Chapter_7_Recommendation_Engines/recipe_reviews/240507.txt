I had a hard time eating this as is. I did sprinkle it with some dried cranberries and sunflower seeds as suggested by the submitter - but the cranberries did not provide enough sweetness for me. I ended up adding a bit of brown sugar just so I could eat it. Not something that I would make again though sorry!
