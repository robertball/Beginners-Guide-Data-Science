I made this in my instant pot. I saut√©ed the onion (using butter instead of spread), added the ground beef, and then added the rice packet, and beef broth. I cooked on high pressure for 7 minutes, then added the corn, beans, and tomatoes and cooked for an additional 3 minutes high pressure with quick release. I served this with some sliced avocado and basic corn muffins from this site.

Way too bland at first, but being a Texan, I added hot sauce & jalapenos and it was pretty good

This was delicious. My store did not have the Knoerr Taco Rice so I used the Mexican rice. I added more garlic powder, and chili powder. It was so good!

Taco. In a bowl. Can't go wrong. The rice didn't keep me from eating it with tortillas. I added some green sauce and fresh tomatoes. Thank you for the recipe.
