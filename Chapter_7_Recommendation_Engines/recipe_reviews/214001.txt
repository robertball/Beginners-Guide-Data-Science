This really surprised me.  I thought it would be way too sweet for me - but it is outstanding....just perfect.  This is a keeper for sure.  Thanks!

Very great glaze for my Easter ham. I could not find the English hot mustard, so I used a jalapeño mustard and it was terrific!
This will be the ONLY glaze I use from now on!

Yum! We have gammon alot and this glaze really made it special. I am sure this will become a staple in our house. I doubled the recipe and kept half out to use a side dipping sauce (uncooked).

I use this every holiday for the ham.  I cook the ham in the slow cooker and this glaze is perfect.  I have tried to do others, but the family tells me it's nice, but go back to this one.  My tip:  I use the measurements as a base then taste and add a little more of whichever ingredient for my liking.

Really liked this one a lot - poured over a pre-sliced ham for about 20 minutes at 350 and it was delicious. The flavors are sweet and tangy, and worked well in a lot of different ways. We used some of the leftover ham in Egg Cupcakes, some in a quiche - and a lot of it all by itself. Yum!

My husband asked me to use this everytime I make a ham now.  It stuck to the ham even when it was hot so the glaze really set in.  Very good.

It was sooo good. Not too sweet and there was extra to put on the side or especially great with the left over ham. 
I bet this would be amazing on pork loin also

This glaze turned out great! The flavor wasn’t too sweet or too spicy, but a really good mixture of both. 5/5 liked this in our family so I’m sure we’ll make this again sometime. The only bad part was I had to cook the ham a lot longer than originally thought, so some of the glaze just ended up being kind of burned and hardened. I will have to work on a better method to get the texture right.

I improvised this basic recipe since I did not have anything except the honey.  I used the zest of one clementine and some of the pulp with agave nectar for the marmalade.  I used duck sauce for the apricot/peach jam.  It still was marvelous.  I gave it only 4 stars because I don't know what it would have been like if I used the right ingredients.
