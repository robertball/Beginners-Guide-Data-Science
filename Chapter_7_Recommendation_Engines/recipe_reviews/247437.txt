Fantastic! This is exactly what I was looking for. I used gluten-free mini tortillas, made a cabbage-mango salsa to place on top of my tacos, and topped everything off with authentic Cotija cheese. My bf ate five in one seating. I'd say this is a keeper.

Such a simple recipe and delish!  Take a spoon and scoop the avocado out, it's a lot easier than peeling it..
