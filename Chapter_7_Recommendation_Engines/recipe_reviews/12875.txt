Excellent! I used milk instead of cream, and grated cheddar instead of American, and saltines rather than Ritz crackers, and it was really good.  Try adding more milk to create a salsa and pour it over grilled or sauteed fish filets.  Or create a roux with butter and garlic, add flour, then thin with milk and add leftover squash casserole, add crabmeat (the fake stuff worked fine) and serve over angel hair pasta.  Really versatile.

Very good and a extremely nice change from the same old same old.  I used larger shrimp and just chopped them into small bite size pieces (just b/c I prefer the taste and texture).  Turned out great, and is now a family tradition at Thanksgiving!

If you're tired of fixing the same old recipes, here is something different! I thought it was a little unusual but my husband and daughter loved it.  I did add some mushrooms and covered it with fried onions since I was out of bread crumbs. I also used a little Old Bay seasoning. A wonderful change of pace!

Very yummy. Don’t substitute the heavy cream, and don’t overcook the squash. It will continue to cook in the oven. I added a bit of cheddar and Parmesan cheese, and I used garlic and butter Ritz crackers. Definitely will make again!

This is delicious!  Can be served as a main dish or side.  My husband went back for a third helping!  Directions don't say to drain the squash before putting it in the casserole dish, but you should. Excellent!

Excellent way to prepare squash. The cheese sauce is out of this world. I did add finely chopped banana pepper for a touch of sweet heat.  Yum!
