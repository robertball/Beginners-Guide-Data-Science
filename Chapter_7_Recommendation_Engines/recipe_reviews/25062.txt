It was a very easy recipe to make and bake and had a nice texture but it didn't really have a buttery taste.

Great!  Very light and buttery.  The chocolate on the bottom adds just enough sweetness.

Very quick and tasted good for the amount of time they took. I found it easier to drizzle chocolate over the top than to try to coat the bottom.

This recipe made my cookies taste just like grandmas the only difference was that I used 1/2 vanilla extract and 1/2 almond extract.  I also used 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 white. Just because I try and stay away from the white flour. I made mine quarter moon shape and w/ half the batch i used crush almonds and made them round to differentiate between the ones w/ nuts in them (for those who can't eat nuts)... everyone loved them... My son is very picky but he like these very much.  I made them for thanksgiving weekend and I am making them again. If you want real tasking Greek cookies these are definitely it w/ the changes I made. I could not believe how much they tasted like grandmas.  Only other difference is that it took way longer to bake then stated on this recipe... 30-40 minutes is more like it. I live in Buffalo, NY so adjust for altitude and I use an electric oven. Thanks mojohson!

Very easy to make and tastes wonderful! I made them with a Kindergarten class of 18 children, children and parents alike adored them. There is no refrigeration time which makes them ideal to bake with kids.I let the children use basic cookie cutters to make shapes and them let them dip them into melted chocolate and lemon icing. The dough is a little sticky to cut out shapes with, but with enough flour on the table it works.

I have to say that this recipe reminds me of across between... Shortbread cookies and Christmas snow ball cookies. Very good basic recipe for the start of something wonderful. I didn't get the melt in your mouth or the butter flavor. Had more of a chock texture for me. But my grandsons loved them. Thank you for sharing.

This is a really good, basic recipe.  As I do with most cookies, I roll them in sugar before flattening and put the sheet of cookies in the freezer for about 10 minutes before baking.  These are good with chopped pecans added...butter pecan cookies.

Nice butter cookie.  No chill time, which is a plus. I used unsalted butter, so I added a few pinches of salt. I dipped the bottoms in chocolate and drizzled some on the top.  Good recipe!  would make again.

Yummy! Me and a friend made them and added three chocolate chips on each one and didn't use the chocolate coating. We also put a pinch of coco powder on each cookie.

Came out amazing! Soft and buttery! Made my own variation by adding a little blueberry preserve. Gives it that extra sweetness to compliment the cookie.

They were very sweet. Not buttery at all I plan on remaking these but tweaking the recipe just a bit.

I followed the recipe as written for the cookie batter. I did not use the chocolate. I give these 5 stars for being easy and melt in your mouth delicious. I made some buttercream frosting, but they are wonderful, stand alone sweet bites.
