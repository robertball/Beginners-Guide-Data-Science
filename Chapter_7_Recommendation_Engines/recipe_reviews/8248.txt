My family loved this cake. I am not a chocolate chip fan but I liked this recipe because it was easy to make, no frosting is required or desired(makes it easy to transport in bag lunches or for picnic lunches). "Cake in the hand",no fork required! Do not forget to add the vanilla that is mentioned in the ingredients but neglected in the directions.

This was a quick and easy recipe.  I used a 11x7 pan, and mixed semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips, then sprinkled with powdered sugar after baking.  I didn't make any adjustments to baking time and it was perfect.  Great snack cake.

It came out quite well, like a tasty coffee cake.  I made it with half chocolate chips and half butterscotch, and it was brilliant.  However, I did have to bake it at least 15 minutes more than the specified time.

Well, I bake alot but for some reason when the recipe called for a 9 in pan, I used a 9 in round pan, what a mess in the oven, next time I will realize that the pan is too full...just one of those days for me........BUT the rest of the cake that stayed in the pan was great, deformed, but wonderful taste.  Thanks a bunch...hope everyone else has better luck then I did!

this cake was *very* easy and turned out fabulous.  perfect with coffee.  i dusted the top with a little powdered sugar to give it a finished look, but honestly, it didn't even need it.  it's just sweet enough, but not over the top - perfect.  i will definitely make this one again!  and as to the extra 15 minutes of cooking time that others said it needed.. it ended up done for me in a little less than the 30 minutes alotted, but i use the heavy dark colored bakeware which may have contributed to that.

I made this cake to serve with coffee after our Christmas Eve meal. It was great! It was the perfect ending to a big meal - not too sugary sweet. I got lots of compliments. It's not a "pretty" cake, so I pre-sliced it into rectangles & served it with a dollop of freshly made, barely sweetened whipped cream. I will definitely be making this cake again & again.

Great. Moist. Spongy. Not too sweet, but perfect amount of chocolate.  Don't forget to add the vanilla to the wet mixture.  I used low fat sour cream and it worked out wonderfully.  Will definitely make again.

Really good flavor. But I agree with the others that it needs extra baking time. Also, I added extra chocolate chips but I wouldn't do that next time because when they baked, they ended up as  melty globs of chocolate instead of individual bits. Too much chocolate can't be bad, but it does affect the resulting texture.

My 5 year old daughter was home from school sick and wanted to make a chocolate chip cake....found this recipe and followed the advice of some other readers.  I did not add any extra chocolate chips, cooked it the extra 15 minutes, added a little cinnamon and dusted the top with powered sugar.  I also used margarine because I didn't have any butter on hand...came out perfect...very easy and very good.  My whole family loved it.   Thanks for sharing and all the tips....

I made this in a bundt pan (my picture is one of the 3 listed), and dusted it with cinammon sugar - delicious!  It was super easy to make too.  Oh - the instructions forget to mention adding the vanilla - don't forget to do that.  I added a touch of almond extract for a touch more flavor too.  Yum!

I really liked this recipe, very moist and yummy! I did modify it though! 1/4 c margarine 1/2 c sugar 1 egg 1 c fat free sour cream 1 tsp baking soda 2 tsps baking powder 3/4 c all purpose flour 3/4 c whole wheat flour 2 tsps vanilla 1 tsp cinnamon 1 c dark chocolate chips Did all the steps the same, added about 1/2 cup buttermilk since it was too thick and previous reviews had complained about dryness. baked in a large loaf pan for 55 minutes Was a huge hit for our coffee break! *** made it again using blueberries and substituting 1/2 sour cream with blueberry yogurt, needed to add milk since was batter was really thick, baked 35 minutes in a bundt pan, made lemon glaze really nice!

Because I was taking it to a block party, I doubled the recipe.  I also baked it in a bundt pan since others mentioned having trouble with the middle not getting fully baked.  Even in the bundt pan, the middle was slightly under-cooked, but was still edible.  Following another reviewer's example, I sub'd half the white sugar for brown, to give it more of a cookie flavor.  That worked!  The cake was VERY yummy, moist and went over very well at the gathering.  I absolutely will try this again in the bundt pan without doubling the ingredients.

UH-MAZE-ING!!!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  This cake is fantastic!  It is so moist and tender even though all-purpose flour is used!  I was looking for a chocolate chip cookie in cake form and I am ecstatic i found this recipe.  I did trade half of the sugar for lightly packed brown sugar and used fat free sour cream (all I had) and the cake turned out wonderfully! On top of wonderful texture and flavor it was super simple to make.  I would give it 10 stars if i could!

Easy and delicious! I made this recipe as cupcakes and they came out great, you gotta watch them in the oven, though! I have made them once with larger chocolate chips and again with mini chocolate chips...my husband begged me to make them again with the larger! This is for sure a keeper, not much more complicated than a betty crocker box mix and tastes fantastic! With this one under my belt I'm feeling ready to try the sour cream choco cake recipe, wish me luck ;-)

Wow, the recipe is so simple I was expecting to be a little disappointed. The only change I made was made them into cupcakes instead of cake. It only took about 15 minutes to cook. Absolutely delicious and moist. Sweet with a vanilla flavour plus the chocolate....mmmmmmmmm. We ate them plain this time but next time I am going to add a milk chocolate frosting. I can hardly wait!

Good cake, simple to make.  Tastes great, very tender crumb, moist and flavorful.  Made a 9 X 9 pan first and a dozen cupcakes the second time.  Both times I had problems with the middles sinking, even though I was very careful not to disturb them.  I think the next time I will add just a tad bit more flour to give it a little more structure and see if that helps.  Definitely worth making again though!

very nice cake. I did not have quite enough sour cream, only about 2/3 cup. I used 1/2 cup of vanilla Greek yogurt because that is all I had. It took all of 45-50 minutes to bake, although I turned it down after 40 minutes to 325 because it was getting too brown on top. I sprinkled powered sugar on top. Just finished a piece and it was delightful - fluffy, moist and not too sweet.

Everyone in my house loved this cake! It was so moist and delicious! I wanted to try out my new silicon 10 inch cake pan and I thought this recipe would be perfect. I followed the recipe pretty much as written, except for a few small changes. I didn't have any sour cream at home, so I substituted yogurt instead. I also sifted all the dry ingredients to make it nice and fluffy. I added a few tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder and one teaspoon of cinnamon. Even though I was using a silicon pan (reduced baking time), it still took about 25 minutes to bake to perfection. I could imagine that if you used a normal cake pan, then it might take 10-20 minutes longer than stated to bake through. But I had none of the problems that others have stated. My chocolate chips were evenly distributed and the cake was perfectly moist and rich.  I am definitely keeping this one in my recipe box and I am sure it will be used again and again! Thank you so much!

Fabulous! I doubled the recipe and made this cake in a bundt pan. It needed to be baked for almost an hour due to the amount of batter. After I took it out to cool, I made a mixture of confectioner's sugar and milk and drizzled it over top of the bundt while it was still warm. It drips down the side, then I top it with a sprinkling of extra chocolate chips. It makes for a beautiful presentation!!

YUMMY! This was a perfect cake to make with my 2 1/2 year old daughter. It was easy since we didn't have to ice it. And it was WONDERFUL! I would even love it without the chocolate chips. It was very moist and yummy. I sprinkled the top with sugar and cinnamon. We couldn't stop at one piece. Our family ate the entire cake in 2 days. Oh boy.. definitely will be making this one again. Thanks!

This did require a longer baking time but it was beautifully tender and quite light for such a rich batter. i took off one star because i'd hoped for a stronger sour cream flavor but this was delicious.

This cake was very good, I baked it in a bundt pan.  It was very moist and I used mini chocolate chips.  I did not have the problem of the chips falling to the bottom like some other reviewers.  I baked for just around 30 minutes and it was baked all the way through.  Of course I forgot the vanilla because it is not listed in the instructions but caught myself right before it was too late.  DON'T FORGET THE VANILLA!!

Really delicious when followed exactly to the letter. It was a tad sweet for me, I might add a touch of extra salt to the batter. I drizzled chocolate ganache over top ( but just a drizzle ) and the children adored it. I baked 35 minutes in a bundt pan.

my hubby liked this cake but suggested next time I use mini chocolate chips and put in less.  He doesn't really like chocolate.  This cake was easy to make and turn out nicely.

I was so excited about this recipe. I chose to make this into cupcakes, and they were not nearly as moist as I thought they would be.  With the butter and sour cream, I was expecting a moist, flavorful cupcake.  But they were rather dry and crumbly.  Cupcakes usually don't last that long around here, but these were still here days after I made them.

This cake has a sponge cake like texture -- very light.  I used a square 9" pan, baked it for 30 mins, used 1/2 c. mini choc chips as I didn't have the reg chips on hand, made it plain (no cinn-sugar topping) and the cake came out great.

This cake is delicious - although, like another reviewer... I didn't read carefully enough and used a 9" cake pan. I didn't have a mess though, and although a little too thick for my liking, this cake was fabulous! Easy to make - and easy to devour in an afternoon with two eager small "helpers"!

Great, simple cake, quick to make and dense and moist. Like others, I had to bake it for more than 40 minutes in my 9x9, so I covered with foil after 30 minutes to prevent it from getting too dark.  The first time I had only 1/3 cup sour cream and rounded that out with 2/3 cup FF vanilla yogurt. Worked wonderfully. Second time I had 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt and I rounded it out with 1/2 cup milk which also worked just fine. I added just a pinch of cinnamon, and chopped the chocolate chips roughly with a butcher knife just for personal preference.  Great snacking cake, the family loved it. Thanks!

We liked this a lot!  Made it exactly as written except used fat free sour cream and mixed all wet ingredients in standing mixer added dry ingredients smallest amount to largest. Came out fuffy and moist. YUM..

I tried this recipe today, and I was awed with the great results! I used nonfat plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and I was scared that it wouldn't turn out as well. But, when it came out of the oven, it was amazing! Since I used the yogurt, I dropped a lot of calories as well. Awesome!

My mom has been making this cake evere since I can remember.  I learned to make it myself when I was in elementary school.  It's so easy.  We always add cinnamon sugar to the middle layer and extra cinnamon sugar to the top.

I have made this twice now, and it's definitely a keeper.  I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, because I prefer baked goods not too sweet.  I found that 45 minutes was perfect for baking time.  I've tried this with 1/3 cup whole wheat flour, and it works out well too.  So easy to do.

Very good snack cake! I'm surprised at all the comments on needing more baking time. Mine turned out perfectly in 30 minutes at 350 degrees. I did make some modifications, though. I doubled the recipe, used butter flavored crisco instead of butter, and used a 13x9" pan.

FIRST, I WANT TO SAY THE CAKE WAS DELICIOUS, WHEN IT FINALLY WAS DONE.  I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS TO THE LETTER AND AFTER 35 MIN. IN THE OVEN I TOOK IT OUT BECAUSE A CAKE TESTER CAME OUT CLEAN. HOWEVER WHEN I HAD ALLOWED THE CAKE TO COOL ENOUGH TO TAKE OUT OF THE PAN, IT FELL IN THE MIDDLE. I HAD TO PUT IT BACK IN THE OVEN ON THE PLATE THAT I HAD TURNED IT ON TO.  I HAD TO BAKE IT FOR ABOUT ANOTHER 20 MINUTES TO BRING IT TO A COMPLETE BAKED CONSISTENCY.  I NOTE OTHER REVIEWERS ALSO HAD TO GO LONGER.  I THINK THE ORIG. RECIPE SHOULD BE CHANGED IN THE TIME OF BAKING. WE DID ENJOY THE FINISHED PRODUCT AND I WOULD MAKE IT AGAIN BUT I AM GOING TO MAKE A NOTE ON THE RECIPE TO COOK IT LONGER THAN 30 - 35 MIN.

I made all sorts of substitutions (used egg beaters, Splenda, reduced calorie margarine and fat free sour cream) and it was STILL wonderful.  A tad spongy but the flavor was very good.  Will definitely make again.

Well, the birthday girl loved this but I thought it was just so-so.  My chief complaint was that it was somewhat dry for such rich ingredients.  I made a crumb topping so that it would resemble coffee cake but next time I'll stick to cinnamon sugar.

This did not turn out well for me.  My cake sunk just before coming out of oven.  Perhaps because I checked on it too early that I disturbed it.  However, I don't like cakes that are that finicky.  Subsequently the cake was heavy and dense.  The chocolate chips sunk to the bottom of the cake also.  I used regular sized chips, so I would advise anyone making the cake to try mini chips instead.  The cake had a nice flavor (chocolate chip cookie like).  I probably won't try this one again.

As an American living in England I often have trouble when it comes to measuring soft, ingredients like butter,.  It seems the gram conversion is always a bit too much.  SO 115 grams of butter is too much for this recipe.  This amount of butter made the cake a bit greasy.  Taking this into account I still gave the recipe five stars.  The texture of this cake is lovely and light; the flavour is the perfect combination of sweet chocolate and tart sour cream.  I had to bake the cake for 50 mins.  Again, it's a temperature conversion thing.  Would I make this cake again...You Bet!!!    The only addition I made was to include a pinch of salt in the dry ingredient mixture.  Next time I'll reduce the butter to 100 grams.

I used the 9" pan and it took MUCH longer than the 30minutes, for us it was closer to an hour and by the time it was done, all my chocolate chips had sunk to the bottom of the cake and made a sticky mess.  It was still good, however, next time we'll try less chocolate and the 11x7 pan.  The cake, however, was wonderful, spongy and moist and not too sweet - which is what I was looking for!

This came out really good... It's a dense cake so, although you want to, it's hard to eat a lot of it... I doubled the recipe to fit in a large bundt pan and cooked it about 50 minutes...

Great snack cake!  I read the reviews first and used a 12x8 pan because I was afraid it wouldn't be done in the middle.  I also mixed 1/2 cup choc chips in with the batter and sprinkled the remaining 1/2 cup on top so they wouldn't sink to the bottom.  It came out a little thin (due to the larger pan) so I think I'll try the 9inch pan next time.

I didn't especially like this cake, but others did.  It could have used an icing.  I sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, and it needed to be dusted with powdered sugar.  The chocolate chips sunk to the bottom of the cake.  I doubled the recipe and cooked in a 9x11.  Made it for a b-day of a coworker, and all the guys at the factory ate it up.  It was a little dry and needed a bit more sweetness.

This was great! I made it into cupcakes and mini loaves. I used vegan chocolate chips and almond milk (what I had on hand), and my usual flax seed substitute for eggs, but regular butter. My husband took these to work and everyone loved them! I ate more than I’d like to admit.

The cake is delicious!  However, I didn't give it 5 stars because I think the baking time is off.  I baked it for 35 minutes, and it was really turning brown on top so I took it out.  The middle didn't get done so it sank.  I was afraid to continue baking it longer for fear of burning it.  Still delicious though - hubby approved so that's what matters!

I am gluten intolerant so rewrote to use gluten free flour plus 2 tblsp of corn meal.   Also use plain yogurt as I did not have any sour cream.  It takes about 10 minutes longer in the oven. Even my non gluten free family requests this cake now more than any other!.  Excellent cake.

This is an excellent cake.  It is very rich and doesn't need any icing if you use the chocolate chips.  I used this recipe without the chocolate chips when I made my daughter's birthday cake.  It is better than store bought cake.  Everyone loved it.

Wow!!  Awesome base recipe, but made some changes and took this baby to the moon!  Used fat-free sour cream mixed with a little water since I only had a scant 3/4 c left.  Subbed in 1/2 c unsweetened cocoa powder for 1/2 cup of flour asked for and used only 1 egg. Baked in little cupcake papers filled to the brim for 15 minutes at 350... my my my!  With a scoop of icecream on top while hot, this has made my night!

I didn't particularly like this recipe. It was dry on the edges and only moist in the center (the very center). And all the chocolate chips dropped to the bottom, so it looked like a layer cake rather than a chocolate chip cake.  I ate a couple bars and threw the rest out.

This cake tasted great, but it was very crumbly, so much so that it made it difficult to frost. I paired it with the sour cream chocolate frosting also on this site.

This recipe was delicious!  I made it with margarine and fat-free sour cream and it was still excellent.  I recommend using high quality chocolate chips.

YUM!!!!!!  Chocolate chips sank to the bottom even though I stirred them into the flour mixture.  But, still very good and easy!  I baked in a 11x7 pyrex dish.

I was very disappointed. I was expecting a chocolate cake, like in the picture, but turned out white cake with chocolate chips. Then I used a bundt pan, thinking, like most cakes that it would turn out. But it fell apart when inverted, so much for "cake in hand".

This was a tasty snack finger food cake, but must cook longer than specified time.  I used a 9x9 inch pan as recipe stated and after 30 min it was still very, very liquidy in the center.  So, cooked 30 minutes more, but lightly covered top with aluminum foil the second half hour so that it would not overly brown (or burn) the top.  My choc chips did sink to the bottom and I only used 3/4 cup of them.  Like other reviewers idea for using the mini choc chips --not so heavy.  Also, I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter and loved the aroma as it was cooking!  If you want a delicious pastry with chocolate chips you may want to try the chocolate chip cinnamon rolls on this website.  They were fantastic and achieved a similar flavor.

YUMMY!  It makes a nice dense cake - not crumbly at all.  I used a 9 inch square cake pan and it was perfect.

I think this would've been really good, but it never cooked in the middle. I cooked it for 35 min. and it was still liquid in the middle. I would've left it in longer but it was getting pretty dark on top. The edges were good, though...

Not what I was looking for at all. I thought this was too dry. I followed the directions exactly BUT I baked in a bundt pan and added time to the baking time. I will not make this again.

I am a baker and make everything from scratch.  I had an abundance of sour cream so I thought I would make this and since it had such rave reviews I thought it would be worth my while.  The batter tasted just like regular white cake batter and when it was all said and done, it was not anything special at all!  I doubt I'll make this again...

This was a decent cake, though I probably won't make again. Nothing special. I too ended up baking it longer than specified. Also topped with cinnamon sugar. By no means bad, just not fantastic. Thanks!

This is a moist and flavorful cake. The kids had fun helping to mix everything, then decorating chocolate frosted top with extra choc chips and sprinkles. We turned it into a double-layer heart-shaped cake for Valentine's Day, so we cut the bake time to about 18 minutes. Next time I will use mini-chips, too. The regular-sized chips add too much sweetness to a single bite of cake!
