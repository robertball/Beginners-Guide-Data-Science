My husband loves this stuff. You have to let it sit until it hardens. In my case, I made it before bed and let it sit out all night. It's an easy, different treat. Took it to a harvest party and while it was not gone at the end, it was quickly gone when I brought the rest home. It's surprisingly good, even though it doesn't look as exciting as other fall treats :)

i think a crucial ingredient is missing?  like sugar!  it states at the beginning - old-fashioned candy.  doesn't candy = some sort of sugar involved? this is not "hard" by any means.  at least at this point. and it's been well over 30 minutes.  if i pour milk over this - it easily becomes cereal.

Love this recipe except I don't break the crackers. I place the crackers side to side in the pan and pour the butter over them. Sometimes I use nuts, sometimes I don't.

Butter cracker ratio is off, I cut the butter in half. Such a quick cookie / bar, easy enough for the kids to make.  And yes, I did sprinkle a tiny bit of brown sugar over the crackers before baking.
