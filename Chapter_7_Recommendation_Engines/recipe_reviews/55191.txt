One of my favorite recipes!  I doubled the cream and wine amounts, plus I added a teaspoon of parsley, tyme, and basil.  I added a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder.  It turned out great!

This is a wonderful sauce - great flavor - I would thicken it a little with a roux the next time as it was a little thinner than I would have preferred.  But the flavor was so rich - we served it with wild rice on the side and every drop of the sauce went!  I also would think about making more sauce - we made it with 4 chops for 4 people and it was barely enough sauce so I might think about doubling it next time around, it was so good!

Added note:  since my initial review, I decided to retry with sherry instead of white wine.  wow!  a really winner there too!  and try it with chicken as well!! you just can't go wrong with this.  you might also try adding the mushrooms with the white wine and chops - they take on the wine flavor and are even more yummy.  and i always double the sauce so there is no fighting at the table :)

This meal was so easy! I replaced the white wine with apple cider and the sauce was to simply die for!This will easily become a regular in our house now!

We enjoyed this recipe.  I browned 4 pork loin slices, that had been tenderized, in butter - seasoning with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I added a can of beef broth and simmered for about 6 minutes.  I removed the meat and strained the broth into another sauce pan.  I sauted fresh mushrooms in a litle butter - returned the beef broth to the pan with 1 cup of heavy cream and a little Marsala wine.  I cooked it until it reduced a little and thickened.  This sauce is wonderfull.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and a veggie.

These were delicious. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe stated, adjusting the cooking time for my thicker chops. The second time I added a heaping tablespoon of flour to some of the cream before adding it to thicken it a little. Very Very good! Thank you for submitting it!

I use allrecipes all the time, but rarely rate or comment. First, I want to say that I love this recipe! The only thing I recommend is doubling the sauce and adding some garlic (I love garlic and put it in everything! ). Second, and the main reason I am commenting: I get so aggravated when people rate a recipe that they have completely changed. I saw someone on here who gave the recipe 3 stars and said the sauce just didn't knock their socks off and they won't be making again. They stated in their comment that they used chicken broth instead of wine, and half and half instead of heavy cream, AND they also added sour cream and flour to the sauce. Well no wonder it didn't knock your socks off! You completely changed the recipe! I'm sorry, but if you're going to alter a recipe that much, you shouldn't be rating it. Make the recipe as stated the first time (adding more/less seasoning to your taste is fine), rate it, and then alter away the next time you make it!! Sorry- I'm done ranting now. This recipe rocks! One of my favorites :)

Love this dish, will make this one again and again!!  My boyfriend told me he is lucky that I am an excellent cook after dinner.  One thing I did different was marinate the mushrooms seperate in a little wine, garlic and greek seasoning before putting them in with the cream and wine.

Substituted Kentucky bourbon/chicken broth for the wine and half & half for the cream.  Used flour mixed with sour cream to thicken.  I liked the flavour of the sauce, but it didn't knock my socks off!  When husband tells me it "is just OK", that means we probably won't be making this again...

DIVINE!! DIVINE!! DIVINE!! I used 3 porkchops seasoned with garlic salt and pepper. I added minced garlic and mushrooms while I pan fried the porkchops. I kept the same measurements for the wine and heavy cream (only had 3 porkchops), but did add 1 tbsp of flour to the heavy cream before mixing with the wine. Added a few shakes of parmesan cheese, parsley, and thyme to the sauce too. OUTSTANDING!

This was pretty good. Nice and quick and something different with pork chops and my family liked it with some penne pasta. I doubled the sauce and that was more than enough for the meat and pasta.  The only change I made was to press a clove of garlic into the butter before I browned the meat. I like garlic in white sauces, so that was a preference thing.

This is an awesome recipe, and so SO easy. When substitute minced garlic for the mushrooms and I usually only make two or three chops, but I leave the rest of the ingredients exactly the same and it turns out awesome. The sauce isn't very thick, but I've started mixing most of it into whole wheat cous cous when I make this. It makes the cous cous stick together a bit and gives it an amazing flavor to go with the chops.

Tasty and fancy-looking recipe with little time commitment involved—great for busy weeknights.  The sauce makes for a tasty dipping sauce for dinner rolls, too!  My changes per reviews: doubled the sauce and added the mushrooms with the white wine to allow them to absorb some of the wine’s flavor; added 1 t. parsley, 1 t. thyme, 1 t. basil, ½ t. garlic powder, and ½ t. onion powder to the wine mixture; thickened the sauce by adding flour after removing the chops.

Made some changes. I used skim milk and left out the mushrooms. I did have to add a little flour to help it thicken. Turned out good.

This was a very good dish.  I made a few changes according to what I had on hand and also family preferences.  I sauteed fresh mushroom in smart balance.  When they were almost done I moved them to the side of the skillet and added boneless medium thickness chops.  I sprinkled on s&p, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme and let brown lightly.  I decided to double the sauce.  As suggested by a reviewer I added apple cider (1 cup) replacing the white wine.  Then I added 1 cup of half & half with some corn starch stirred in to it.  I stirred everything together and let it thicken, then covered the skillet and let it simmer until the meat was tender.  Hubby and 3 teen kids all really liked it, as did I.

This was such a wonderful way to eat pork chops! My husband and I loved it.  I did add some parmesan cheese to it though.  I also doubled the amount of heavy cream b/c I like lots of sauce.

This was awesome!  I would put 4.5 stars because it could've used more salt, which I will add more next time I make it.  This was also very easy to make (and better for you than using a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup).  Due to our busy schedule yesterday I decided to try putting this in my slow cooker to finish cooking and be ready to eat when the family came back from a meeting.  It turned out great!  We didn't even need a knife to cute the pork it was so tender.  The only adjustment I made, besides turning it into a slow cooker recipe, is adding a finely chopped onion.

Not bad. But I thought it would have more flavor to it. I added some garlic, lawreys season, onion powder and parsley and it was still on the bland side. I think with some modifications this is a good starting point.

This was so good I can't wait to make it again.  I did sub half and half since we were out of heavy cream and it worked great.  My sauce was not thin but just right.  I will double the sauce next time as I made the recipe as is but with only three pork chops and it wasn't enough.  It was the perfect combination and the pork was tender and not dried out.  I served with roasted asparagus and white rice.  Perfect!

Very good, I added onion and fresh garlic to the mushrooms which I par-cooked in another pan before adding them to the wine. Added some worcestershire sauce tot he pork chops as I was browning them and a bit of seasoning salt to the sauce and thickened it a bit. Served it over egg noodles. I don't generally like pork, but these were good.

The sauce is absolutely delicious, with a rich mushroom flavor.  I served this with noodles, and next time I will double the sauce.  My husband is often noncommital about food, but he really enjoyed this.  I'm looking forward to making it again soon.

Excellent!  Only diff was after I browned the chops, I took them out and put the mushrooms and some onions in the pan and cooked them for a few mins. Then I took the 'shrooms out,  put the chops back in, added chicken stock in place of wine, and went on thru the recipe from there. I wanted the mushrooms to be fried a bit. It was excellent and really quite a fast recipe, also!!

This is a great quick and easy dish.  I usually cook 2 chops and use 1/2 cup each of cream and wine.  I season with garlic salt, meat seasoning and pepper. I also add chopped onions.  COVER the chops when cooking in wine! This makes them more tender.  I have always served over rice and prefer the thin sauce as it makes the over all dish lighter.  When I get to adding the cream...I usually add around another tablespoon of wine and butter depending on what cooked off and depending how much sauce I want on the rice.  I will be adding some parsley and basil to try out tonight!

This sauce is phenomenally good.  I made it as-is and it was runny.  Will tweak it next time but my husband could have licked his plate.

This was pretty good, but I think the chops might come out more tender if you bake them in the oven covered with foil.  The cream sauce is fantastic!  I made a little extra (used 1 C each wine and 1 C cream/half and half mixture) also thickened with a little flour.  Used the extra sauce as  gravy for mashed potatoes.  I am going to try this again with chicken breast tenderloins!

This was both super-easy AND delicious!! The sauce had a rich, mushroom-y taste, and all the alcohol burned off, so it tasted more like cream of mushroom than wine sauce. The family really enjoyed this! Will double sauce next time.

I loved this recipe.  I more than doubled the sauce and used it a couple days later over chicken.  Yum!  I used 1% milk instead of heavy cream, and added a bit of flour to thicken.  Delicious!

Seemed sort of rich but not so very flavourful.  We are thinking of trying this recipe again, only cooking it for a longer time and doing it in the oven instead of on the stove.  Our chops did not come out very tender.

I'm not a big pork chop fan.  But...WOW.  These were great!  My whole family could not get enough of the cream sauce.  I will double it next time so there is more to go around.

This was very good (I fed it to a group of 6 guests and they all agreed).  The pork chops take more like 15 minutes (rather than 6 minutes) to cook unless you buy "thin cut" pork chops.  I also tried the recipe again but with half the butter...it was just as good but I had to cool the pan before adding the whipping cream otherwise the cream just burned right off.

Made this last night, and everyone LOVED it!  The pork chops were nice and tender and the sauce was delicious.  Next time I make it I will definitely double or even triple the sauce recipe.  I just made a couple small changes - first, I used low sodium beef broth because I didn't have any wine.  Also I added about 1/4 C finely chopped onion when the chops were almost done browning, and then after I removed the chops I added the mushrooms to the onion and let the veggies saute for a little bit until they were softened, and then added the cream. I didn't have any problems with the sauce thickening, but it did take a little longer than 5 minutes (I just let it boil away and kept stirring). We all practically licked our plates clean - definitely a keeper, and thanks for the great recipe! :)

Added some onions to the butter. Doubled the sauce, added parsley, thyme and garlic powder to 1/2 and 1/2 (all that I had with some flour to thicken). Husband declared this is a keeper!

I love the taste of wine.  I love the taste of cream.  I could taste neither in this sauce.  It was the blandest sauce ever.  I had so hoped for it to be better.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe.  We followed one of the recipes and added thyme, basil and parsley.  In fact the second time around - I used it as a pasta sauce and added some fresh cherry tomatoes, green onions and shrimp to the recipe and it turned out delicious!  Tonight I am going to cover our pork tenderloin with this YUMMY sauce.  Thank you!  :)

I don't use wine in my house, so substituted an herb and garlic marinade and used 2% milk with corn starch to thicken with a bit of garlic paste and favorite spices. Served with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies. It was a big hit with my kiddos.

Made exactly as written. I had 4 big pork chops and the amount of sauce was perfect. Dont understand people who say this sauce has no flavor. The wine and mushrooms give it a great flavor. Will def make again!

One of two of my favorite recipes I've found on here. I forgot to pick up white wine so I substituted rice wine vinegar and a smidge of apple cider vinegar. I sauteed the mushrooms in minced garlic (McCormick minced in canola oil) and olive oil for a good while before adding them to the sauce. I also added a bit of flour to thicken it but will definitely make more next time. There were no leftovers :)

What a great dish.  I put a little garlic and onion salt on my chops but other than that stuck to the recipe. It was yummy!

OMG, this recipe is to die for! I'm not a huge pork fan but I wanted to make something different for my fiance. I doubled the sauce and added sauted onions with the mushrooms and it came out so tender and delicious. Everyone in my house loved this dish, I will definitely make again over and over. Thanks Christine!

I really liked the sauce for these.  I used pork loin and added just a spoon full of flour to thicken the sauce and it was awesome.  The only mistake I made was not doubling the sauce.  It was soooo good that I made another little batch later!

This was so yummy! Sometimes I back pork chops with Cream of Mushroom soup so I was really excited to try this one! I would have to say this has so much more of a "mature" and richer taste, it's definitely something I will serve to my friends/family when they come over for dinner. I made a couple changes, I sliced up a pre-marinated pork tenderloin (lemon & garlic flavor) in about 1 inch slices. I used 1 cup of white cooking wine and I just used about 1.5 cups of heavy cream. I also thickened the sauce with flour. Other than that, I followed the recipe directions and this came out AMAZING! My husband is a food snob and is rarely impressed and he was blown away! Also, I cooked some noodle rings for my 13 month old son and strained them.  I added some of the sauce w/o the mushrooms to the noodles and he devoured it!  Thanks for posting this recipe.

Great recipe, great sauce! I did not have to use heavy cream, as we watch our calories, so after cooking the pork in the wine, I removed the meat, added mushrooms and some garlic, and once they were cooked, added about a quarter cup of flour, to make a roux. Then slowly stirred in milk (1% is all we buy) until it was all mixed in and creamy. It turned out great, and I used some parsley and savory because I had some on hand...very good mushroom sauce, which I will use in place of mushroom soup in recipes from now on! Thanks!

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I wanted a recipe that did not call for Cream of Mushroom soup, but honestly, it didn't taste any different than when I do use cr of mushroom. It still deserves 4 stars because whether you make your sauce from scratch or used canned soup its a great way to cook pork chops.

The sauce was a little runny in my opinion.  The flavor was wonderful though, so I may just try thickening it up.  Good recipe over all.

Wowee-wow-wow! These were so delicious!  I too used Apple juice instead of wine like another reviewer suggested and it was good. I also added a couple tablespoons flour to the sauce to thicken it up, and cooked the mushrooms in the sauce the whole time.  The sauce is so good, I'm racking my brain trying to think of other things I can put it on!!

This has become an absolute family favorite.  I say "Pork Chops in Cream Sauce" and my kids literally start licking their lips.  My husband's not quite as obvious, but he looks forward to this meal, too.  Like some of the others, I double the amount of sauce, which also tastes wonderful over rice.

A simple classic! Empty plates say it all, but I did heed previous advice and I doubled the sauce, subbed stock for wine, used garlic butter- great:)

This recipe was very simple to make and did not require many ingredients.  I am not accustomed to cooking with wine, so the taste of the wine I found a little overpowering.  Overall a really good dish!

Not bad, but I had to add a lot of seasoning/spices to this (garlic, pepper, shallots, salt, paprika, cayenne).  Maybe it's just my Indian tastebuds, but the original recipe is quite bland.  I used sherry and half 'n half because that's what I had on hand (had to thicken with a couple tablespoons of flour).  I might try this again, but I'm not sure it's worth the fat and calories.

I made this recipe for my husband who is a very basic eater. He likes his pork chops baked or grilled and that's about it. This recipe made him get seconds! The two of us ate all 6 chops in one night! I love this recipe! I served it with rice and asparagus.

Love the flavor, but just as someone stated before, I would make the sauce a little thicker for more consistency.  Also, add some shallots, onions, or even green onion/chives will also give it a more richful flavor.  Otherwise, I would use this recipe again with my own variation added.

I tried this recipe with pork but it came out dry as all my pork recipes do.  I then used turkey breast and flattened them out with a mallot.  It was to die for.  This recipe is a keeper.

My husband LOVED this.  Since I started staying at home with the kids, I have been trying new recipes and he loved this one best of all.  The only thing I would change was the thickness of the juice/gravy.  It was very good!

Not a bad recipe.  Very basic, but one could easily add various spices and/or herbs for different flavore.

This is SO amazingly good.  Really easy, too!
I did have to adjust my cooking time a bit, but other than that, YUM!
We used the sauce over spaghetti noodles as a side -- that was the kids' favorite part!

These were amazing. I pared down the recipe for two chops, and regreted it. I wish I would have made more. Very easy, very fast, extremely tasty.

The sauce was great. I used big thick pork chops, so I had to increase the cooking time. It was a guessing game, b/c I wanted to cook them all the way through, but not too much. I think next time I'll just use regular, thinner cuts of meat. And season it more, because while the sauce had great flavor, the meat didn't really.

A little too rich for my taste, but my husband loved it.  I also used beef buillion instead of wine and I added cornstarch to thicken.  Served with egg noodles.

I have actually made this many times over. Needs no thickener so good for Keto.  I love sauces and gravies, so what could be better than a fail proof sauce made with two ingredients: whipping cream and wine,  added to the pan drippings, S & P to taste.  Can be used with any meat that is quick cooking

Love this basic, easy recipe.  The chops I had were a thinner cut so I should have shortened the cooking time... my bad.  But the mushroom reduction was amazing.   Even the "mushroom-haters" in the house loved this.  Will make again... and again!  Oh, I used a good chicken broth substitution for the wine.

This was a simple and quick recipe to make. The flavor was good with the cream and the mushrooms, and this was liked by all four of us that were eating. I am sure since we all liked it I will be making this again soon. Thank you for the recipe, CHRISTINEPEREZ!

I fried the pork chops with shallots I had laying around.  Like another reviewer suggested, you defiitely want to double the gravy ingredients and add the mushrooms to the white wine (as opposed to adding them to the cream like the recipe says).  The flavors have more time to seep in and blend this way.  

The meal was done before we were ready to eat, so i set the pot on low for an hour, stirring occasionally. The pork was so tender and delicious!! I served it with a side of egg noodles.

This is a terrific recipe; nice light body sans flour or "cream of soup".  I loosely followed the measurements and made a couple of additions as the sauce cooked; beef broth and some cilantro and lemon thyme from my garden. Also, for mushrooms, I used pickled Chanterelles 'cause I happened to have a jar in my fridge not because I am rich.  Fantastic flavor.

Loved the gravy BUT I followed recipe exactly and do not understand why my bone-in chops were tough, tough, tough. My husband tried them and left them on the plate. I ate mine but felt it was like eating leather.  Did I do something wrong? Why are pork chops (quality ones) usually so tough?

These were absolutely delish. I doubled the sauce which was to die for, used the wine vinegar (which I now use in almost everything I cook) because we aren't alcohol drinkers, and it was all just fab. Similar to stroganoff but with pork and tastes so much better!

My family loves this. Tried with red wine (it was open) the first time but the sauce turned an unappetizing grey color. The second time with white wine was much more appealing.  Both times delicious!

This recipe was a great hit with my family!  After reading the previous reviews I doubled the amount of sauce.  I served it over rice, It was FANTASTIC!!

This was simple and easy,  but something is wrong with the measurements. I left it at 8 serving size thinking it would produce plenty of sauce for 4 chops, it barely produced enough for 2

I used thin cut pork chops and removed the bones before cooking. I also added a sliced onion to the pan before the mushrooms and then deglazed the pan with the wine. I also served it over mini bowtie. This was so good! The sauce had so much flavor! Hubby loved it too! Will be making it again!

The best pork chops I’ve ever made.  My husband loved them.  I made 4 chops but left the sauce at the same amount.  Next time I’ll try doubling the sauce.  Was wonderful with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.

Very good! I made a rue with half of the butter called for to thicken it up. But because the sauce comes out very thin. I’ve also made this with steak instead of pork chops. Very yummy!

This  was a yummy recipe however I made it in the oven vs. the crock pot and had them in for just under 3 hours on 300 then at the end 275.

I followed the recipe exactly except for adding sliced, sauteed portabella mushrooms - a great addition.

My husband of 43 years said they were the best pork chops EVER!

Served over thin pasta, used oyster mushrooms and a side of green beans. It was great, and the leftovers were great.

Delicious! We tried this recipe and it was exactly what the title said: creamy. We didn't have the cream the recipe asked for, so we used half and half. It turned out the same, (meaning creamy and scrumptious) so if you don't have that ingredient use half and half.

Very quick and easy. However I added seasoning  and sliced onions as the recipe seemed  bland. To the cream mixture I added paprika and Tuscan seasoning. The onions were added while the chops were cooking in the wine.

I only made 3 pork chops & still thought more sauce would’ve been better. I added garlic salt and had to use cornstarch to thicken as I substituted cream with milk/butter combo.

This recipe was so easy and so quick to make. I liked the recipe as is but the next time I make it I will substitute low sodium chicken broth for the white wine to cut the sodium even lower. I will definitely make this again. My husband and both liked the recipe.

Excellent recipe ... I changed it a little by sautéing shallots and jalapeños at the initial butter melt point.  From there I followed the recipe to the letter until the end when I added tomatoes, rosemary, and basil, instead of mushrooms.  GREAT recipe!

I thought that this was good.  Doubled the sauce and served with some egg noodles. Needed a little more salt, garlic and seasoning. I added after I made the original recipe. Served with some roasted cauliflower. Nice dinner. Be careful how long that you cook the chops.  They don’t turn out all that tender.  We had thicker chops and I added a few minutes to cooking time and was a mistake. Not the recipes fault.  It was all mine.

My son and I both enjoyed this.  My chops were very thick so I was worried it wouldn't turn out well and would be either overcooked on the outside or undercooked on the inside.  I did cook them longer since they were so thick  and because of that, I had to add more butter to the pan so that I could cook the pork chop until the internal temperature was high enough.  When I was making the sauce, it got a little thick and I needed more sauce so I added a little more cream and also some chicken broth to make it less thick.    I would definitely make this again.

This is an amazing recipe! I've been making it for several years after finding it here. I have made a couple of changes, but in technique...not ingredients. First, I marinate my mushrooms in wine & minced garlic. I just throw the shrooms, wine & garlic in a zip lock bag while I get everything else ready. I prefer a little butter & olive oil or just bacon grease to sautee the chops. Then, after removing the chops, I deglaze the pan with wine. My daughter used to date a guy who's father was a French chef. Literally...from France and owned a restaurant! I learned about cooking with heavy cream from him. You never need to add a thickener to heavy cream. What you need to add is time! It thickens up like a dream...but it takes like 15-30 mins of simmering. So, deglaze your pan with some of the wine, add the cream & let it simmer for at least 15 mins (you have to constantly stir with a heat resistant spatula) & your sauce will be amazing! Once it's getting thick add your marinated mushrooms & then once it's perfect, your chops! I like it on angel hair, my husband likes heavy pasta like cellentani...so I go middle of the road with egg noodles! (Or I make two pastas) But, seriously, don't change the ingredients or you will miss out on this amazing & super easy meal!

My family loved this dish! I didn't have mushrooms, so added onions, broccoli and zucchini instead, and it was delicious. I used rice wine vinegar instead of white wine, and added a little more cream than the original recipe called for. Overall, great flavor -- we'll be making this one again for sure!

Wholly smokes!
 Admittedly I just eye-balled the whole dealio since there's so few ingredients and I took other folks advice to add the thyme. I also used fresh milled pepper and did a rub of fresh garlic on the pork chops along with the salt & pepper. I also dusted them with rice flour to hold the goodies in. Okay, so I also cooked down the sliced mushrooms first in order to get the juice to add to the wine. To plate, I served the meat centered in orzo, piled extra mushrooms on top, placed fresh green beans on the side, and ladled the sauce over the whole she-bang.  
Overall, this rocked my whole family's world and I found myself sneaking into the fridge at midnight for left-overs. 

I work on a little show called "Master Chef" so I see tons of awesome sauce (pardon the pun) and this one wins the apron in my house! Bon appetite.

Yes, I made some changes. First, I used bone-in chops that were sliced thin, because the flavor in a chop is on the bone. Then, I substituted low-sodium chicken broth for the wine, because I think the wine would make it taste sour. Then, I doubled the amounts of broth and cream, to make a copious amount of sauce for sopping. Also doubled the amount of mushrooms, because I like mushrooms. Even so, I thought it was on the bland side, although my husband raved about it. If you make it this way, recommend you serve with the green vegetable of your choice, and some steamed white rice.

Would add more cream and much more mushrooms. I didn't get much of a cream as this is my first time doing a reduction with cream. Now I know for next time. This would make a good sauce with chicken tenders too!

Very good and light gravy when made with milk and little flour instead of the heavy cream. I followed the recipe with a substitution only to use milk instead and added just a couple of tablespoons of flour to thicken. I made this for only 3 boneless pork chops cut thin. Thicker chops would need more time than stated and you would need more gravy for more chops.

My favorite recipe and dish so far!  I did have to allow the chops to cook a little more like 4 mins per side to completely get done as mine were a little thick.  I also ended up adding a little more wine and cream than called for to get more sauce.  The sauce is heavenly!  I highly recommend this dish and will definitely be making it again!!  Delicious!!!

I made exactly as written, the sauce didn't quite impress me when complete. I did add some cream sherry and some corn starch to thicken it up, then it was definitely tasty. DH thought it was fantastic once changes were made. Great base recipe. Served with Mushroom risotto.

Delicious and simple.  Used 3 chops, 1 can mushrooms instead of fresh (didn't have fresh on hand), and kept all other amounts the same.  Served with instant mashed potatoes, and made a quick dinner taste like it took a lot more time and effort than it really did.  Perfect for "dinner dilemma" nights!

I read many of the reviews and tweaked it with the suggestions.  I made a rue to thicken the sauce which got to thick so I thinned with milk. I added garlic and thyme to the sauce. This was an excellent dish!! I would recommend broccoli and a potato for a side. The sauce it makes is wonderful. I did need to add extra salt. Will definitely make it again.

Made this for the first time last week and loved it so much I served it for company on this weekend and everyone had seconds :)  I did a spice rub on the pork chops first, some thyme, salt and pepper, some paprika and whatever else I was in the mood for.  Browned it in coconut oil instead of butter and then set it aside while I sauted the onions, garlic and mushrooms..  I added flour to the onion mixture before I added the white white. Put all the pork chops back in and let them simmer til cooked through.  The cream I think makes the sauce!  First time I made it there was a cry for more sauce so second time around I ended up using the whole bottle of wine (served 12 people).  Served it with dirty mashed potatoes and steamed veg with fresh bread.  This is now one of my go to recipes!

Love this!  Today I was really wanting to make mushroom soup but my husband is a meat and potatoes kind of guy. Found this recipe which has real mushroom sauce and pork for him.  I found myself eating the sauce every time I stirred it.  Fortunately I made extra sauce and was able to fill my craving for mushroom soup while leaving enough for him to have some on his pork chop.  A definite keeper - it may even become my go to for mushroom soup.

I made this using boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of pork. Added seasonings to flour (garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Italian) and coated the chicken in flour before putting it in the pan (you can use regular sized chicken breasts and flatten with a meat tenderizer or my grocery carries thinner cut "skinny chicken" which I used (not quite as tender since you don't flatten it, but still works and tastes great if you're in a hurry). Browned on both sides in the butter until thoroughly cooked and I added finely chopped scallions as the chicken was nearing done (before the wine). Followed the recipe from there on and served over wide noodles. My family raved over this!
Note:  I would definitely double the recipe for the sauce if you are planning to serve it with rice or noodles.

This was amazing! I did add a few things per some of the other reviews. I seasond my pork with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder and let them sit for about 30 minutes. I sautéed my mushrooms with some onions in butter prior to cooking the chops and set aside until the recipe called for the mushrooms. Then I added about a quarter cup of chicken broth with the wine. I also added a tablespoon of flour to the cream before adding to the pan! I will definitely be making this one a couple times a month at least!

This was pretty good. I DID NOT use butter in the dish (#NO!). I made (1-bite) pork cubes instead of porkchops and cooked up some fettucini as well. when the pasta was done I added it to the sauce and let it simmer for 5 minutes while mixing almost continuously. It really added a lot to the dish

This is one of the best recipes for a quick easy meal. It was delicious. I used light cream instead of heavy cream with pinot grigio. I'm definitely making it again soon.

While the pork chops were tender and flavorful cooked in the wine, the sauce was bland even with the addition of thyme.

This is definitely a keeper!  I added some onion and garlic with the cream and it was fantastic!  I served it with a parmesean risotto and my family ate it all up.  Thanks for sharing!
