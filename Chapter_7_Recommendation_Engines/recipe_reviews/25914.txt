No offense but this reminds me of a dish that accompany's some poor college student's main dish of ramen noodles.  It's okay in taste but I would never serve this to company and to be honest, I doubt I'll make again. Once the veggies were tender, I did drain off some of the water and then added chicken buillion cubes and "sauted" them until the cubes dissolved. If you have NOTHING in the cupboard but want some veggies, I guess you could try this recipe. Its not a bad recipe = just nothing special either. Thanks anyways!

Well in contrast with the agitation of the previous reviewers, I found this simple recipe useful, and will use it again.  As an expat living in China we are short on familiar seasonings and long on fresh vegetables, and this hit the spot.  I julienned the carrots and potatoes and added zucchini as well.

I was looking for a recipe to use up the veggies in my fridge that had been there for an unknown length of time. Thankfully, I came across this recipe, and I had everything except the vegetable bouillon, which I substituted with chicken bouillon. Cooking only for one, and trying to use up as much veggies as possible, I grated two small potatoes and  one carrot, and then thinly sliced 1 1/2 green bell pepper and a small white onion, plus added 1 Tbsp minced garlic. Also, I sauteed them with the corn kernels under medium heat with 1 Tbsp of olive oil before I added the water, and the smell was just divine. I then added the water and bouillon cube and then simmered it for about an hour. The flavor of the chicken kind of overpowered the roasted veggies taste, so next time, I'll look for vegetable bouillon or probably just add a little butter before adding the water and no bouillon. But all in all, a pretty good batch of soup. Thanks!

No offense but since when does "no meat" translate into a fast? This (or something very similar) has been a staple in my kitchen for over 15 years when I'm looking for a quick simple throw-together meal that's not too spicy. Not every dish needs to be served with a fire extinguisher! Obviously vegetables can be added or substituted according to what's on hand or in season and seasonings can be added according to your taste which is what cooking is all about. I don't think I've EVER slavishly followed a recipe in over 30 years.

Needs more than salt and pepper for seasoning. Didn't realize that it would come out as a soup picture does not show a soup.

Very easy to make and a great change up to every day food. I did change the recipe. I didn't have vegetable bouillon so I used beef bouillon. I will definitely make it again.

The recipe does not say whether to drain the corn or not so I went ahead and added the corn and its liquid. This was pretty good. Simple but good.
