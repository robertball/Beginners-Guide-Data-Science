I made these cookies with finely chopped, lightly toasted pecans instead of hazelnuts and they turned out very tasty, light and crisp.  However, the recipe doesn't make as many as it promises -- I even scaled up to 72 servings, and this produced less than 3 dozen cookies (my "walnut sized" lumps of dough were about a rounded teaspoon full).  The dough was very quick to make in a mixer, though, and satisfying to work with.  Thanks for this recipe!

My husband is Russian and when he tasted them they were by far the best that I have tried to replicate. They are so moist and just melt in your mouth. We will definatly be using this recipe again.

Excellent recipe! I followed it exactly with the exception of adding chopped hazelnut since I couldn't find it in the store. I added pecans instead and it was very good. This recipe is simple and quick to make! Thanks for sharing!

I also found these did not make the promised number. I had to add more butter as the mixture was too dry & there was no way the metric version would stick together. Nice taste tho & I'll try again with the original version.

These are very easy to make but come out very dry.

these are very simple, not excessively sweet and full of hazelnut flavor. I added some baking powder (as much as salt) and they puffed up lightly + tasted delicious.

Some reviewers found these dry, or the quantity lacking. If the ‘cups’ are converted to Grammys, it’s a very simple recipe. I made these biscuits with my daughter and her friend at half-term, we made two batches, half with lemon zest and juice (instead of vodka) and the others with a few choc chips. They might not have been authentically Russian but we ended up with over thirty large biscuits. They were like soft shortbread, delicious and crumbly. Will definitely make again!

I make this for "tea" for my kids. It's a dry shortbread cookie, but very tasty. Their classmates ask me to make some for them!
