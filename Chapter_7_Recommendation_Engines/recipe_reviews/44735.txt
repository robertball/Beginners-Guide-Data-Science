OK, first thing I need to caution y'all about is the chill time. This will need to chill in the refrigerator overnight...it's not something you can chill for a couple of hours & then slice & serve for dessert. Second, I am pretty sure that the meringue should be spread out on a jelly roll pan (sometimes thought of as a cookie sheet but it has a rim on all 4 sides). Mine was too thick & didn't firm properly because it was too thick. I also think that the sour cream needs to be decreased to lessen the runniness of the filling (it seeped out a lot!) either that or it needs to be chilled for a bit after spreading the filling but before rolling (which may aid in firming up the meringue as well..I am going to try that next time). I used frozen rapsberries & took the suggestion of the raspberry jelly (adding a bit of raspberry liquer to thin it some) which probably contributed to my problem w/ a runny filling. Even w/ the problems this dessert was sooo good (couldn't have it for dessert because it hadn't set but I did have some for breakfast) that I will keep working on the recipe until I get it down. It just tastes that good!

This is a very good dessert. The flavor combinations are outstanding! A few notes, though: Waxed paper -- instead of the parchment paper -- does not work on this recipe. I didn't have any parchment paper. So, the meringue layer then stuck to the waxed paper, making it impossible to roll. I was hesitant about using sour cream -- was going to use Cool Whip instead -- but was very pleased with the sour cream. Mixed with the white chocolate and cream cheese, its delicious. In addition to the raspberries on top, I used some raspberry jelly, which I stirred to make it spreadable. Since I wasn't able to roll the dessert, I literally just served it "as is" -- right on the waxed paper! The presentation wasn't the best -- but the family didn't mind. We all loved the dessert -- delicious! I will try again, this time with parchment paper!

My husband actually made this, because I was at work.  I talked him through the recipe and told him what the other reviews had said.  He baked the meringue in a jelly roll pan (10x15).  I suspect that Rowena had a typo in her instructions and that it should read 10x15 instead of 10x12.  He had a little trouble peeling the parchment paper off the meringue, after flipping it onto the parchment paper with sugar.  One corner broke off, but he just use that as the start of the roll, so no one knew the difference.  I had advised him to let his cream cheese sit out until it reached room temperature before mixing with the sour cream so that the filling would stay smooth.  He said that he had no problems rolling it up.  I think his success was mostly due to the use of the jelly roll pan and baking it exactly 10 minutes.  My guess is that if he had over baked it, it would have crumbled when trying to roll it, because the edges which were the most done, crumbled a little.  Plus, we followed the advice of another reviewer who said to use parchment paper, not wax paper.  Since we ate it several hours after he made it, he didn't wrap it in plastic wrap.  Instead, he put it in a 9x13 pan that has a tall lid.  Then, he chilled it in the freezer for about an hour, and then moved it to the fridge until it was served.  This is a delicious dessert!  We will definitely make this again.  I think I will try other berries or mixing berries.

I'd like to see Rowena to do this dessert, mine was almost disaster. The only solution not to loose it completely was to put it in triffle dish and serve it so. The same happened to my doughter-i-law. What did we do wrong?

I was a bit worried about making this for company based on some of the previous reviews, so I tested it on my family first, and it worked out perfectly. It looked good and tasted even better, especially the filling. I am making again for company tonight, and cant wait to serve it to them.

This is delicious! Definately worth the trouble involved in rolling up the meringue. If rolled properly, it looks great iswell. I garnished mine with whipped cream and chocolate shavings, and everyone loved it.

I'd like to know how to roll this up also!  I've made 2 of them and both were a disaster rolling!  the first on hit the trash and the second one I just rolled good enough and stuck in the freezer?  haven't pulled it out yet to see how bad it looks?  What am I doing wrong.  the filling tasted awsome, than's why I keep trying!

The only reason I'm giving this a two is because I really like the filling.  But I will never make this dessert again.  I took the meringue out of the oven after 10 minutes like the recipe states, and couldn't get the parchment paper to come off.  It kept ripping the meringue which I finally noticed wasn't even cooked all the way.  I manuevered it back onto the pan and baked it another 10 minutes, which only helped a tad.  The filling was so thick after adding the chocolate that trying to spread it over the meringue only made it rip further.  It was easy to roll, but the filling was coming out of all the cracks.  When I opened it to eat it, it let out a smell like a container full of deviled eggs an the meringue was kind of soggy in spots.

It seems to me that it would be easier to make an angel food-based jelly roll and then use this filling.  I won't even bother to attempt the meringue part of this again, it's not worth the waste of my time and ingredients.

Delicious!  However, it did sink a bit.  It didn't hold together, and ended up very mooshy by the end of the night.  I just wish the meringue had been a bit more stiff.

It didn't turn out like I expected. It was rather gooey and slimey. The inside was good but the crust was not. I normally like meringue but I did not care for this. I won't make it again.

I really wanted to make this, but was worried about rolling it. I dusted the parchment paper with cornstarch beforehand to prevent sticking, it did help as I didn't have any problems removing the paper. When I'd spread the filling over I was very tempted to just pick it up and place it in a trifle bowl. Then I decided to be brave and try to roll it. Actually the rolling wasn't as bad as I'd thought it be. The shape was a little odd but not too bad. I chilled it overnight which I definitely recommend doing. Before serving I sliced it and put whipped cream and more raspberries on top, so my company wouldn't notice the weird shape. This is a lovely tasting dessert which was enjoyed by everyone. Many thanks.

What a decadent dessert! I took the advice of another reviewer and used a 10 x 15 pan. The parchment paper only stuck just a little bit around the edges, but I was able to kind of scrape it away from the paper with my chef's knife. One thing I want to mention is that I think the cream cheese and sour cream mixture needs to be room temperature before adding the white chocolate. Mine wasn't, and as soon as the room temp white chocolate hit the cool cream cheese, it solidified a bit, and I ended up with little "chunks" of white chocolate in my filling. Not a bad thing, I just don't think it was supposed to do that. I made a raspberry sauce with frozen raspberries and sugar, then passed it through a fine mesh strainer to remove the seeds. I thickened it a bit with a corn starch slurry. It was fabulous, and brought this dessert over the top.
