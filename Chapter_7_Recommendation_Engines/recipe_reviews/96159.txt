This recipe turned out fantastic and turned my husband from an eggplant hater to an eggplant lover! I love that it is baked, not fried - and so delicious!  

A tip to make the eggplant tender and remove all bitterness: 1. Peel the eggplant in stripes then slice into 1/2 " rounds.  2. Generously salt each slice and allow the slices to sit in a colander for an hour (all the bitter juices will drain out.) 3. Thoroughly rinse the salt off with cold water. 4. Firmly squeeze out the juices/water from each slice -  like wringing out a sponge. The eggplant is tough, it can take it!  5. Pat dry with paper towel. After a few disappointing experiences with eggplant, I learned this trick. It will also cause the eggplant to absorb much less oil if you decide to fry it.

Sooo much easier and healthier than frying the eggplant.  I took the advice of placing salted eggplant in colander for 1 hour.  I weighed it down by placing a nest of bowls on top of the eggplant to help 'squeeze' out that bitter juice.  I then rinsed well and put them on a lint-free kitchen towel, folded it over and pushed down to get the water out.  Put one pan in the oven while preparing the second cookie sheet and ran out of egg so just used milk instead and it worked fine to finish them up. Shredded mozzarella, parmesan, and romano (love romano) and made a 3 cheese shred and tossed it all together to use for layering.  Omitted the basil on top; already had it in the sauce.  Used "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" recipe on here and it was great.  Will definitely make again because it is easier baking, and can prepare other things while each pan is in the oven.  I also started putting it together while the second pan was in the oven.  7 min. on each side was perfect.***Be sure to keep the slices of eggplant on the thinner side and don't overdo it on the sauce or it may be mushy when mixed with the eggplant breading during baking.  Thanks for the recipe!

Make sure you salt the eggplant and let them drain for at least an hour.  I did it for 1/2 and hour, and they were still bitter.  The crispness from the baking is satisfactory, and the fact that the eggplant isn't a grease ball is fabulous!  I'll try this again when I have more time to "debitterize" the eggplant.  It's a lot of work, but worth it!  Homemade tomato sauce is a plus, but not a necessity.

This is really good. I've made it a few times, and it went over well each time. Pretty easy to make, too. One thing though- the recipe doesn't say, but if you put cheese on and bake without covering, the cheese comes out really brown. That's the only change I'd make- either add cheese then cover and bake, or bake uncovered and add the final layer of cheese just for the last couple minutes. I did the latter, and it worked well.

This was absolutely fantastic.  Took others advise and salted the eggplant in a collander and let sit for about an hour.  Just wiped off with paper towels and proceeded from there.  Kids and husband loved it.  Very easy weekday meal with lots of flavor and little effort.  My kind of recipe.

Good and very easy -- I did sautee mine a little in a pan so the eggplant was soft.  It's eggplant, live a litte!

Pretty darn good!  A little salty.  I used the seasoned bread crumbs and would suggest either more tomato sauce or sauce on the side.  Definitely a keeper.

I've always fried the eggplant, which soaks up a huge amount of oil, so I was glad to find this recipe.  I used one large eggplant and let it drain for about an hour - sometimes the bigger the eggplant the more bitter it is.  Eggplant Parmagiana is a very forgiving recipe and I never measure my ingredients so I didn't follow this recipe strictly.  I probably used more sauce (homemade), less mozzarella and more parmesan.

This was not good. The eggplant was not done (it was hard). I followed the recipe (and times) exact. What a bummer! I will be looking for a better eggplant parm recipe. Thanks anyway!

I liked this recipe, but I had one eggplant, so I scaled back the recipe to 2 servings.  I guess it wasn't "medium" though, because I ended up needing another egg and more bread crumbs (I used cracker crumbs) and 2 full cups of sauce to fill the pan.  I had more than 4 servings when it was done.  It was a good basic recipe.

Awesome!  I used part skim Mozzarella to make it even healthier!  I used the advice of another reviewer and let the Eggplant stand for 1 hour to remove all bitterness.  I will make this often!

Delicious and easy. The dish didn't loose anything for the eggplant being baked instead of fried. In fact I think it made it better because the eggplant was crisp and crunchy and not the least bit soggy.

This recipe was pretty good.  I added some garlic salt to the bread crumbs.  It still seemed to be lacking something.    The cook time seemed to be off too.  I followed the cook times as directed and the eggplant was still pretty hard.

good, I added hot Italian sausage to the sauce and served the eggplant over noodles and extra sauce.  I only made 1/2 a recipe and with the noodles it would serve 4.  We had lots of left overs

This was great!! I cooked it a little longer that the recipe suggested and it turned out perfect.  My kids really liked it. I will make this again.

This was delicious and easy, and no frying!  I didn't cook the eggplant quite long enough, though, so make sure you poke it with a fork to see if it is nice and tender before putting it in the oven.  Next time I will cut them a little thinner than 1/2".  Like someone else, I also let it sit for one hour salted and then rinsed it off and squeezed out the water, patting dry with a cloth dish towel.  I used marinara sauce, which was great, but I think next time I'll use my favorite spaghetti sauce, with mushrooms and gr. peppers.  My husband really liked it!

This was so YUMMY! I loved that it was baked, not fried. I used three small eggplants and had to use a little more sauce and egg than what was called for. It turned out delicious. My husband was very skeptical of the eggplant (he's not a big vegetable person), but tried it and says this recipe should go in to my regular rotation! It was a little time consuming, because I followed the advice of other reviewers and salted and drained the eggplant for 20 minutes first. But it was still very easy and worth the wait! Terrific leftover too (if you have any!)

I've never had eggplant before so this was purely experimental on many levels (I'm not much of a cook either).  It was good, except too salty.  I let it sit with salt for an hour as other reviewers recommended and then it probably spent about 5 minutes under running water.  Did I not rinse long enough?  For my first eggplant experience it was pretty good, though I won't do it again because of the saltiness.

Great!  I cut my eggplant a little on the thick side so it took a little longer to bake.  You have to make sure they are tender regardless of how long it takes! Soooo much easier than frying them, and they came out nice and firm instead of soggy.  Will be making this a lot!

I made this and it turned out delicious! I look forward to making this for my husband   I salted the eggplant for 1/2 hour, make sure the eggplant is thinly sliced so it is easier to cook and cut into.

OK, I tried it and I really like to saute my eggplant.  The baked product was a little tough.  Though. I am sure it is healthier, I still prefer the other. Also, I prefer the thinly  sliced cheese.

This was just okay.  After making eggplant parm this way, I have decided that if I am going to take the time to make it, I will just fry the eggplant.  What's a few more calories once in a while?

considering this was a  healthier alternative to frying, it was very good.  i also sprinkled a tiny bit of olive oil on the tops of each eggplant , prior to baking. to tell the truth, if i didnt make it myself, i would know know the difference!

Great recipe, thanks. I made it for my mom's birthday, and eggplant parmesan being her favorite meal, I had to make it. And we all loved it, so thanks!
