I tried this tonight after searching for something different to do with the pork chops I had and I have to say that this recipe was delicious! For those who complained that their pork chops were dry, take the time to brine them first...you will never have dry tasteless pork chops again. (Brine...1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup Kosher salt dissolved in 3 cups water + add 2 cups ice. Soak in brine for up to 2hrs. NB. If you use ordinary salt instead of Kosher you MUST cut down on the amount or it will be way too salty). I used 1 inch thick bone-in chops and brined them for about 90 min before drying them and stuffing them with the apple/gorganzola filling. Then I seasoned them with pepper, dredged them in flour and pan fried them just to give a golden brown colour before finishing them in the oven for 20 minutes. Then left them about 10 minutes to rest under foil while I prepared the sauce. Yum! Perfect "gourmet" comfort food for a chilly night.

One suggestion- after I stuffed the chops, I seared them in some hot olive oil in a heavy-bottomed skillet before i baked them. Just long enough to golden-brown the outside of the chops. they stayed perfectly moist inside, and got a little more of the crispy, carmelized flavor you expect from grilled pork.
Perfect.

I made this for dinner guests last night and was a little nervous that they might not like the strong flavor of the gorgonzola.  But they thought it was fantastic and there wasn't a scrap left.  The combination of the cheese and apples is wonderful and not overpowering in the least.  I was confused about "reincorporating" the cheese but took it to mean that the cheese needed to be completely blended.  Take time with the sauce.  It does take a while to turn a darker brown but that really does contribute to the flavor.  Thank you for this fantastic recipe!

I've been searching for a recipe for Christmas dinner, and I think I've found it!  However, instead of using pork chops, I butterflied a pork roast, stuffed it, tied with string, and roasted at 350 degrees for 1.5-2 hours depending on size of roast. Beautiful and tastes amazing!

This is a great recipe.  I originally looked it up and used it for a special occasion, for which purpose it is perfect.  However, it is easy enough and I liked it so much that I think I'll use it any time I have the extra time to spoil myself with a great dinner.
The gorgonzola is not overpowering in the stuffing or the sauce.  Pork chops baked with apples are an old stand-by, but here their use is delectable.  The final result with sherry sauce and all is delicious and sophisticated.
I followed the author's suggestion serving spiced potatoes with onions (try Lipton's soup mix for a short-cut) and added dilled pea pods and baby carrots.  The combination was great.

If you want to make something special, you have found it. This IS the recipe!! You must enjoy Gorgonzola (or the flavor of bleu cheese), though. I found the recipe to be a bit time consuming... but well WELL worth it. When making the sauce, be sure to follow the instructions and reduce the liquid to a dark brown. It will happen and don't be nervous. Yum! Yum! Yum! Thank you so much for this recipe.

This recipe is really easy and so incredibly good.  My husband is a pizza kind of guy and he LOVED it!  He even said it would be good to add into our weekly routine.  That's saying something!  I did it the first time with blue cheese crumbles and it tasted great.  I've done it with gorgonzola as well and it tasted pretty much the same.  Great recipe!!

Maybe it was the Gorgonzola cheese, but the pork chops tasted as bad as they smelled.  I also couldn't taste the apple in the stuffing.  Great idea, bad taste.

I've made this a few times and it's always a hit.  Gorgonzola is too strong for my hubby so I use regular blue cheese and I saute extra apples to put in the sauce on top.  Like others, I brown the pork chops before baking and I use the same pan to make the sauce, which helps give it a richer flavor a bit faster. Excellent recipe.

While this is an excellent idea and excellent flavor combination, the sauce is a problem. In order to brown it, you have to reduce it so far down that it becomes super salty and overpowering (plus it takes quite a while). I would definitely make this again, but either leave the sauce off entirely, leave it white, or brown the chops in a pan and use that to brown my sauce. This turned out really good in the end, but it did take some serious caressing. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe for a "something special" recipe..the apple provides sweet tartness and the gorgonzola cheese savory..compliments each other well... also,I like the fact it isnt stuffed with bread crumbs. I added a small amount chopped onion sauteed in olive oil to stuffing. Delicious!

I had high expectations, but unfortunately this fell a little short for me.  My personal preference would be to leave the thyme out or sub it with something different, it was just too strong in my opinion.  I wanted the apples to be the star of the dish and I barely noticed they were there.  The sauce was good however, no extra salt needed as it gets pretty salty when reduced.  Next time I will at least double if not triple the apple and replace the thyme with another herb or just leave it at the apples and cheese.

Wonderful. My husband loved it. Braised the stuffed chops as 1 reviewer suggested and reduced baking time by about 20 -25 minutes. Juicy and yummy. I did not have any trouble getting the sauce to reduce and did not find this recipe to be time consuming as one reviewre stated.

This was wonderful- particularly the sauce- fiance asking for more sauce as I type...We had pretty healthy cuts of pork (costco) and even then an hour resulted in over-cooking it.  Nonetheless, it was still excellent and we plan to make again, but cook a little less AND double the stuffing!  Thanks:)

Sub feta for gorgonzola and shiraz for sherry. Wonderful! Would double the sauce next time.

I am on the fence with this recipe.  I cannot put my finger on it, but something was missing.  I am not sure if it was the tartness of the Granny Smith apple or something else.  The only change I made was to use some Season All Salt on the outside of the chops and only cooked for appx. 45 mins.  The pork chops were juicy and all, but I do not think I will make again.

I didn't have sherry so used 1 TBsp dry red wine. And my gorgonzola was like brie so didn't crumble. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was excellent. I'll definitely make this again.

Oh my gosh this was heavenly. It was full of flavor, but not too heavy. I took the pork out a earlier than recommended because my chops were thin. They retained soo much moisture! My fiance and I are not a fan of gorgonzola, so I used feta instead. I was worried that it would be just a little OFF, but it was perfect for us! The feta doesn't melt quite as well as the gorgonzola in the sauce, so just be patient if you're using it. We were impatient, so we just settled for MOSTLY mixed. I don't know if it did anything, but I added some wine to the apples while softening. It seemed to mellow out the sweetnes of my not-so-sour apples. Anyway, EXCELLENT DISH!I will make this again.

Superb! Would do the finest resturant well.  Used thick-cut boneless loin chops from Sam's Club.  Based on recommendations, I used one medium sized apple per chop, added finely chopped walnuts to stuffing with a splash of balsamic vinegar, and browned chops in a pan before baking.  I used the same pan for the sauce, giving it a lovely color.  Only had white wine, no sherry, but it was just fine.  Added leftover stuffing to sauce in the last minute.  Served with mashed pototoes to soak up the lovely sauce.

Other than using 8 thin boneless chops, I followed this recipe exactly. Rolling the stuffing mixture up in pounded out chops secured with toothpics worked well. This was a hit with the family. Will definitely make this again.   May try using feta or blue cheese next time... Thanks!

This is really good, I made a few changes to make it more of a rich meal.  I added some cream cheese and cooked bacon bits to the apple stuffing and it was really really good. I also use flat thin boneless pork chops and rolled them and secured them with a tooth pick to cook them.  I browned them before I baked them and I had some of the apple stuffing left over and I topped the chops with it so there would be more apples. The last change I made was that I didnt pre-cook the apples I just stuffed them because that would have been cooking them twice.

These were absolutely delicious!  Not too sweet from the apples and a nice subtle flavor from the gorgonzola.  I took some of the other reviewers advice and brined the chops and then seared them before baking.  I messed up the sauce the first time; the phrase "reincorporate the cheese" confused me, but the second time I just took it to mean stir and it was delicious.  I served it with roasted red potatoes in olive oil and garlic and herb dressing mix.  Next time I might serve them with something a little lighter, but it would be a great cold weather meal the way i served it.

This was a terriffic recipe!   Will definitely make again.   I made it with boneless pork chops, reducing the cooking time to 35 minutes and just substituted light butter and light blue cheese (counting calories right now).   Still tasted amazing!!!

This dish went over big time with my family!  It was delicious!  I did brine the chops first as another reviewer suggested, and next time I think I will pan sear them too.  Other than that I did not change a thing.  Yum!

It was very good.  I did not make the sauce but I am sure it would be good too.  I overcooked the chops, but the flavor was delish even so.

This made the most delicious pork chops I've ever had! I also browned the chops before baking and I think that really helped to lock in all the juices. Also, I decided to forgo the sauce to keep it a little more figure friendly. This recipe is definitely in my regular rotation now.

I liked this very much.  The cheese may be an acquired taste for some, but I have always loved gorgonzola cheese.  This is an easy meal and looks very impressive to serve to company.  I used white wine instead of sherry otherwise I didn't change a thing.

I had a tough time rating this one.  I think it's a 4 (good, not great), hubby thinks a 3 (fair).  I think the taste kinda grows on you as you eat it.  You  MUST like this type of cheese, or I am sure it would be unappealing to you.  The apple flavor did get a little lost in there, and I actually added extra.  Final verdict is that I liked this well enough, and it was worth trying, but I doubt I will make it again.

I made this one night for my boyfriend and he loved it.  To cut out a few calories I left off the sauce (just seasoned with salt and pepper) and added turkey bacon to the stuffing.  It is one of his and my favorite meals.  Plus it is really quick.  It goes well with a baked baby potatoes and fresh steamed green beans.  Any leftover stuffing that won't fit in the chops can be saved and used as a salad topping for lunch the next day with some walnuts added.

This recipe ROCKS!!!!!!  I will make again, but will cut the tyme in half.  I used the suggestion of another reviewer by soaking the chops in a brine...that was good advice:)  The sauce didn't really get brown, but it was divine.  Many thanks!!!!

This really is delicious. I prepared this for a dinner party of eight, with broccoli and mashed potatoes. Since I like simple- I thot it time consuming to make each individual "pocket". Next time I will just take a braised pork loin, slice it and add that wonderful cheese/apple/thyme suace on the top. This is not your usual roast & potatoes and I will be eating this again.

This is sooooo fantastic!  My chops were a little dry, but next time they will be perfect.  Dan LOVED them, and couldn't get enough of the sauce, which I make with white wine instead of chicken stock.  Gorgonzola has a very very strong flavor so you might try a couple two (3..4) drips of honey along the way.

This was very yummy, my husband really enjoyed it as well. I used about 1C to 1 1/2 Cup of apple for our stuffing, when it cooks down there didn't seem to be much there. I also dusted the pork shop with seasoning salt and garlic pepper once it was stuffed before baking.

Also, on the sauce mine never really browned, so I added two teaspoons of cornstarch to the last 1/4 C of chicken broth and it thickened right up with no impact to the flavor. Loved the sauce might try it on pasta with chicken soon!

This dish is full of flavor! The combination of the gorgonzola and the apples is amazing. I added a little bread stuffing to bulk the filling up. I served this with white rice and steamed broccoli; the blandness of the sides helped cleanse the palette after each bite and then 'wow' with the next bite of porkchops. It's a new favorite at our house. (Thanks!)

This recipe is absolutely delicious and is perfect for a small dinner party!  It's so easy, but everyone will think you've slaved in the kitchen for hours!  I used 1 granny smith apple for each chop, and I added the leftover apple stuffing to the sauce in Step 6 after adding the sherry.  I also didn't understand what it means to "reincorporate the cheese" in Step 6 since I already used the 1/4 cup specified, so I just added an additional 1/4 cup of gorgonzola for that step, and the sauce came out marvelous!

This is terrific. The only thing I did different was add more apple and gorgonzola. I have made it 3x's and everyone loves it. I did not have any sherry the last time I made it and used some chardonnay instead and the sauce tasted the same. Love the thyme!

These turned out really well.  I used blue cheese instead of gorgonzola b/c that is what I had on hand.  They are pretty similar in taste and texture, so it wasn't a major difference.  One thing is that the apple flavor really didn't stand out.  I don't know if I should add more next time or saute in apple juice instead of butter to bring that flavor out.  Next time, I would also like to sear the chops before placing in the oven, just for appearance and texture.  Finally, these did NOT take an hour.  I had nice, thick chops and I baked them for about 38 minutes.  Honestly, I should have pulled them out a few minutes sooner even.  They definitely reguistered 160 at that point.

This one is a keeper.  I added a splash of balsamic and some walnuts to the stuffing.  Use a meat thermometer to ensure chops don't overcook.  Have all ingredients at room temp to prevent curdling of the sauce and watch it closely.  I had to sub Roquefort for the gorgonzola and dry white wine for the sherry, but it was still wonderful, thanks for sharing!

I dredged the chops in flour mixed with a little salt and rosemary before cooking.  The flavors melded incredibly.  I didn't butterfly the pork chops since I only had thin cut, but I put the sauce over it and it worked great.  I served them with a side of Gorgonzola mashed potatoes (just stirred in about a quarter cup of crumbles).

I made this dish tonight. Wow what flavor. I used a pork lion roast and butterflied it stuffed with the  apple and cheese mixture. I tied the lion and seared in olive oil, I used a heavy pan as a weight to help the coloring process. I used extra apples and added some uncooked apple to the bowl prior to adding the cheese, this added more apple flavor and some texture. I didn't make the sauce, but did make a sage dressing. I plated with sage dressing, extra apple stuffing mixture, then added the pork and for a little more salty flavor added extra gorgonzola cheese. I loved the flavor. I served an oven roasted red potato recipe that I also found on this site. The potatoes were drizzled with a mixture of butter, dry mustard and honey. I will be adding this dish to my diet on more than a special occasion. Thanks for sharing.

Awesome! I changed the serving size to 5. used 2.5 apples. I used one pork roast that was about 2 lbs and 2 smaller chops. Went very easy on the thyme. I rubbed a premade pork seasoning on the outside.

i made this for my boyfriend a few weeks ago and he honestly is still talking abou it. thanksgiving was 2 days ago and at the meal, he was telling my family about the chops. he says it was something he'd get in a NY restaurant. My only issue was that the gorgonzola was soooo overpowering to me. he loved it, i hated it.

An expensive disappointment!  Maybe this recipe is just too 'gourmet' for me to pull off with my *apparently limited* skills, but it came out pretty bad.  Even though I took the extra time to brine the pork as recommended by another reviewer, it still came out tough and dry.  Other than adding that step, I followed the recipe as written.  The flavors of the stuffing were OK together although I thought the thyme overpowered both the apples and cheese.  The cheese never really melted into the sauce (again, that might be a technique thing that I just didn't do well).  Somehow the sauce came out VERY salty even though I didn't add any salt, aside from the brine.  I will not try this recipe again.

I didn't find these all that great, but I'm not a huge fan of pork. I love gorgonzola cheese, but this recipe was really strong...I gave it four stars because my husband loved it and he is kind of picky so something about it must have been pretty good!

This is a great recipe ! I have used pork loin in place of the pork chop and that works well. Also, I tried it with chicken breast and that was excellent. Thank you!

Tricky one to review. I am no fan of meat and fruit but Husband is, and he didn't expecially care for the pork/apple combination. He did, however, LOVE the sauce. I think I'll try the sauce with chicken next time. Thanks.

These were easy to prepare and tasted good, but baking for an hour was far too long. I had 1 1/2" chops and they were dry. Next time I may try flouring and egg washing the chops and pan frying first then finish them in the oven.

Easy and elegant main dish - best to start with thick juicy chops from your butcher.

This was a wonderful recipe!  I cooked the chops on a cookie sheet facing eachother and for a little less than an hour.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  I will make the sauce again for other items, it was very yummy!

Depending on the thickness of the chops, an hour may be too much. Overall, very tasty stuffing and sauce.

I've been coming back to this recipe for years.  It's a great use of Iowa (or thick-cut) chops.  It's hearty and warming and super good.

My husband made it and cooked the pork too long, so difficult to say it was the recipe and not the cook.   I will try it again next time and report.

We used Rosemary rather than tyme and used blue cheese rather than Gorgonzola. Everything else was the same.  It was seriously delicious! The flavors just exploded in every bite.

This was delicious. I added a little more gorgonzola and apples, and chopped up my apples into tiny bits. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of flour to my sauce. My fiance and I really enjoyed this recipe.

I made a mistake and used Gouda Cheese instead of the Gorgonzola and I have to say it was a GREAT mistake to make.  This was a huge hit with the family

I just spread the extra Gorgonzola on top of the chops instead making the sauce. Really good recipe! Even the hubby likes it and he hates when I experiment. :)

Although I had to improvise with Feta (mishap with the grocery list), I was thrilled with the result.  Used the same amount of traditionl crumbled Feta in lieu of the gorgonzola, browned the pork chops prior to baking them (as others had suggested), and then used a meat thermometor so as not to overcook (160 F). For those that were having issues wth the sauce, I followed another reviewer's suggestion of using the same pan and remaining drippings from the browning of the pork. Also, rather than using the remaining 1/4 c chicken broth as the recipe suggested, I added another tbsp or so of sherry about halfway through, continuously mixing with a whisk, and the sauce reduced beautifully. We served it with a sauteed pepper/onion mix over spinach salad (using the sauce as the dressing) and a wild rice dish leftover from another meal. Ridiculously delicious. We were too hungry to remember the photo, but it was beautiful!

Thanks to earlier reviewers for tips because you encouraged me and helped me. Excellent entre when ingredients are followed EXACTLY-- and the sauce is essential. Browning chops, then using that pan for the sauce, likely did the trick. We're in Portugal so we needed to use roquefort in lieu of gorgonzola, but we did find the tart Granny Smith apples. We will wow our Portuguese friends at future dinner parties with this one!
