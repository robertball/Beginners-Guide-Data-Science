I followed recipe exactly.  The corn bread mixture intrigued me but I was skeptical.  I turned out to be right.   First of all, the amount of bacon fat was not enough to cook all that cabbage (which was a tiny head) - I should have stopped right there and started to make changes - but I didn't.  The cabbage starting sticking to the bottom of the pan because there wasn't enough fat and the cabbage was weighed down by the corn bread mixture (which was not a lot of corn bread mixture for the small cabbage - thank goodness). I finally had to intervene and add some oil - I should have added butter.  Anyway, if I ever cooked this again, which I doubt, I would forget the corn bread mix and just add the cayenne pepper.  I will continue to look for more ways to cook cabbage, but anyone looking at this recipe might try "Indiana-Style Fried Cabbage" which is on this site.  We loved it - it has been reviewed by many.  Living in the East and never tasting Indiana or Texas Cabbage - my vote is for Indiana.  P.S. - Not only were there leftovers - the vote was to deep six the leftovers.  That didn't happen when I served the Indiana style.

Fried some skinless kielbasa and added back into cabbage before serving. I make fried cabbage often, but have never made it with the cornmeal in it. LOVED it.  The jalepenos were a great addition too. Thanks!

Footnotes  Caution When handling hot peppers of any kind , always wash hands or use gloves and do not rub face or eyes.    Just a suggestion on the footnote: If you put vegetable oil on your hands prior to handling the hot peppers, you won't feel the burning sensations later!

I made this for my husband and he loved it.  The bacon drippings were not enough to cook the cabbage though.  I did use 7 slices of center cut bacon and it was less fatty than other cuts.  Everything started sticking, so be prepared to add extra butter or oil.  Overall a good dish.

I really enjoyed this cabbage, next time I may use 4 slices of bacon to make a little less greasy. My boyfriend, who is quite daring in the kitchen, made mini-eggrolls with some wonton wrappers and the leftover cabbage the next day, and as strange as it sounds, they were fabulous, spicy, little egg rolls.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made this for my roommate (female) and one of our friends (male) and it was a success with both.  I really enjoy the spicy side of it.  The corbread mix was a great idea as well.

Awesome!!!  Loved the heat it provided, however, next time I make it (and yes there will be a next time) I am cutting the cornbreadmix down by a couple of tablespoons, increasing the bacon and had to add a little EVOO as it was a little dry. I'm not a cabbage fan but this was a very good meal.

I really liked this one. I've had fried cabbage before but the cornbread mixture addition really changed this. I used turkey bacon and yes you do need to add some more fat to saute this. I added a bit of olive oil. It is pretty spicy, but not overly so.. yum

Pretty darn good...  I doubled the recipe and it was quite difficult to make in my biggest skillet.  Some of the cornbread seemed to clump due to what I assuming was it not being able to coat evenly b/c of pan size.  Regardless, I will probably make again (will not double and try find a small head of cabbage as stated).  It was really spicy and a different way for me to prepare cabbage..

We loved this one.  I was afraid that it was going to be too spicey with the added red pepper.  It was a little warm, but not over the top.  Gonna make it again tonight.

Easy to make your own cornbread mix with equal parts cornmeal and flour - a smidge of salt and sugar and double that amount with baking powder.  I didn't use bacon so instead I browned the onions and fresh garlic in 1/2 stick a butter (gluttonous but tasty).

I'll certainly make this again and thanks ChiliTex for the recipe!

Living in the south someone always have too many homegrown vegetables, right now its cabbage.  I've always used a basic fried cabbage recipe. I wanted to try something new. But this I do believe will be my all time favorite. I loved it.

This was excellent. As an Ex Texan I find myself missing certain dishes at times.... this is one of them. I added shredded carrots, a few sprinkles of garlic powder and a green pepper while sauteing the onion. I also added Lawry's Seasoning to the Cayenne/Cornbread mixture.

I'm from Texas & my grandmother used to make foods like this when I was growing up.  I made this with pork chops and cornbread. I don't really eat foods like this anymore, so the bacon grease was a little overwhelming for me,  but the guys in my house absolutely loved it. They both had seconds. I usally have to beg to get them to eat even one serving of veges. The only thing I changed was adding more japs, we like things very hot& spicy. I will definetly be making this for them again & again.

I wanted to try it even though I wasn't sure about the cornbread mix. It was ok but too much cabbage for the amount of bacon. I loved the jalapenos! They added a nice touch.
