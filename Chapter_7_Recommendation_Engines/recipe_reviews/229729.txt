This was a bit too tangy for us.  I am not a fan of sweet side dishes but this one needed a little sugar - at least for our taste.  I served this with a fairly sweet grilled chicken and rice.  I thought the sweetness of the chicken would balance out the tartness of this slaw but it didn't work for us.  Adding a bit of brown sugar to the dressing would be a good thing.

Love this unique coleslaw with sticky sweet spicy asian type bbq chicken.  We found we prefer napa cabbage instead of regular.  Sometimes I cut the mayo back to a couple Tablespoons and use a coconut greek yogurt for the dressing.  So good!

Even my picky eater mother ate it and asked for seconds. I wish I was joking, but she is a picky eater.

Great flavors, wonderful change of pace from regular coleslaw. Easy to make. Remember 'seasoned' rice vinegar has sugar in it (if you find it too tart, did you use 'seasoned' vinegar?)

Loved it but to me, it was even better the next day. Iâ€™ve made it 4 times now and in a pinch, apple and any kind of pear works well, too.
