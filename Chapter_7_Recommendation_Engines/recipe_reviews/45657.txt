While the ingredients made a great flavored fondue, the recipe itself is vague at the most. After following the recipe to a T and spending nearly 17 bucks on good imported cheeses, the fondue failed. I searched around online to see what went wrong and found that:

1.) Wine should never be boiled-simmer it instead.

2.) The right wine makes all the difference. Fondue needs a wine with high acic levels to break down the proteins in cheese. Chardonay is bad Sauvignon is good. You can fix a failed fondue by heating it up again and adding lemonjuice. The acids in the lemon juice break down the cheese and makes it more melty.

3.) Cubes? What, 1" cubes? 3" cubes? Tiny, tiny, might-as-well-be-shredded cubes? Just shred your cheese.



I fixed the "voted best" fondue recipe with lemon juice. I'm guessing whatever made this recipe work for others probably had something to do with the quality of their cheeses (more emulsifiers melt easier), or the type of wine they used, or they're "ghost writers" related to the author.

I'm giving this recipe a single star based on it's lack of informaton and clarity.

As you sift through the reviews here, you should chuckle at the ones which ding the recipe review and at the same time tell you all the changes they made to the formula to make it cheaper, more kid friendly, or less authentic.  This recipe gives you what you need for a good fondue foundation, which is the most important thing.  Here are a few of my tweaks to make it even better...for adults.  Foodies, hopefully.  First of all, don't use a heavily oaked white wine, like most CA or Aussie chardonnays.  Use something like a sauvignon blanc, a Portugese vinho verde, or a light dry riesling.  The lower the alcohol and drier the better for this recipe.  Some reviewers mentioned shredding the cheese instead of cubing it and I heartily concur.  And DO mix the flour into the shreds as it both blends the stuff well and it keeps the cheese from clumping.  I use a little more flour than posted here but that doesn't seem to be much of an issue.  On the cheeses, just make sure you don't skimp on the Gruyere as it makes the flavor correct.  If you are cutting back on one of the cheeses versus the others, make it the cheddar, not the more elegant Swiss cheeses.  I don't care if kids don't like it - folks, we're serving an adult dish made with wine here.  If you want Cheez-Whiz in a pot, melt some Velveeta into some orange soda.  If you really want good authentic flavors, do grill/caramelize a couple of garlic cloves into the fondue pot before you add the wine & cheese.  Sprinkle in a half a

I made this for my husband and he loved it!  I do have a few suggestions - First, DO use a Sauvignon Blanc for the wine. Second, SHRED the cheeses and toss the tablespoon (or so) of flour in with the shredded cheeses instead of cooking with the wine.  Using a double boiler or Fondue pot typically used for chocolate will also help keep this from clumping and/or burning.  Last, I omitted the butter and rubbed the pot with a garlic clove before simmering the wine.  Enjoy!

I'm rating this four only because of the changes I made. First... don't use cubed cheese - use shredded. Second make sure you pick the right wine. I decided "white wine" was WAY too vague. I used a very dry Riesling and it turned out beautifully. Also toss your shredded cheeses with the flour before putting into the pot. Lastly if you enjoy garlic rub a clove inside the fondue pot. Delish!

With only two of us, we halved the amount of cheese. We also doubled the wine, so our recipe was 4 oz of each cheese, grated, and 1 cup of wine (sauvignon blanc). We followed the comment of using 3 Tblsps of cornstarch (1 1/2 here) and eliminating the butter. We have an electric fondue pot so we just put the wine right in the fondue pot, heated it and added the cheese to the pot after mixing the cornstarch into the cheese. It turned out terrific!

This fondue was absolutely fabulous, I've been thinking about it ever since we had it three days ago!  We couldn't find Emmentaler, so we used Edam, and we also added some fresh herbs: chives and a little cilantro, that added some great flavor.  Afterwards I also heard on a cooking show that if you add a bit of lemon juice to the cheese fondue it keeps it from getting stringy.  I highly recommend this one!

I made this for a christmas fondue party on the 22nd.  It was fabulous!  The cheeses blended easily, the wine and chedder added just the right tang.  I'll make it again for New Year's!  (I ended up using 8oz of each cheese, as they were available in half pound blocks from my grocer).

This recipe was a big hit with my family.  It was delicious with apples and french bread.  Grating the cheese did help to make it melt faster, and a few drops of lemon juice took care of the clumping problem.  We had to fight over the last drops at the bottom of the fondue pot!  Next time I will make more.

Really good fondue!  I used a half pound of each cheese (which I shredded and added to the pot a handful at a time till melted), a New Zealand sauvignon blanc, and served with veggies, granny smith apples, bosc pears, and a crunchy loaf of bread from a specialty bakery.  I had no problems with stringiness.  It was a smooth, creamy fondue that everyone loved.  In fact, we were using the bread to mop up the remaining drops in the fondue pot.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Outstanding!  Having received a new fondue pot for Christmas, I gave your recipe a whirl.  The key to this recipe is to blend the flour and butter and wine first, unlike similar recipes.  I also added about a teaspoon of ground nutmeg to round it out.  It was a huge hit with our friends for a New Years Eve dinner.  Consider this one a keeper!

These three cheese make a great fondue- here are my suggestions to make this a success:  1. I used Sauvignon Blanc with a little lemon juice added (1 tsp).  It helps the cheese not to be like glue.  2. Rub a garlic clove on the inside of the pot (either the one you're cooking with or the fondue pot).  Discard clove.  3. If you don't want to make a roux (it turned out fine when I didn't) shred the cheese, place it in a plastic bag, and shake it all up with 2 tbsp of flour. Omit the butter.  Add the flour-covered cheese about a half-cup at a time to the simmering wine-lemon juice combo, letting each batch melt before adding more.  Stir in a figure eight pattern.

This was very good.  I think I will grate the cheese first next time, as it was difficult to melt the chunks.

I took the advice of other reviews and..  1. Shredded the cheese instead of cubed. 2. Tossed the shredded cheese with the tbs of flour prior to putting it in fondue. Why? This was the first time it has not turned out stringy. It melted perfectly.  3. I rubbed the fondue pot with garlic, then added the tbs of butter and heated. Then I added the wine to a boil, slowly whisked in the cheese.   Hint: I purchased the three cheeses in this recipe at Costco for a fraction of the cost of the deli.  Served with: Rosemary garlic bread from Costco.

I make this fondue at least once a year and have for the last 3 or 4. I decided I should rate it. I make it exactly as is, but rub a garlic clove on the inside of the fondue pot, and it is always creamy and amazing. If you don't like it, you must be dead.

This turned out great!  I followed the other reviewers' suggestions of omitting the butter, mixing the flour with the cheese, and rubbing the pot with a garlic clove.  I also used Gewurtztraminer for the wine, which added a really nice flavor.  When I first added the cheese it did look lumpy and awful and I panicked, but thankfully it smoothed out as I kept mixing.  Will definitely make this again.  The serving size is off, though.  I halved the recipe to make 12 servings and it made enough to barely feed my husband and me (and we don't have big appetites).

This fondue was great!  Better than any kind I have had at the Melting Pot.  I took the advice of previous raters and added the flour in with the cheese instead of with the wine and used lemon juice (and heat) when it got too thick.  I do also recommend using Savignon Blanc for the wine.

Great starter fondue! Changed a few things: Rubbed a clove of garlic in the saucepan, then diced a bit and roasted with a bit of butter. Added 1.5 cups of wine and let simmer down for about 10 minutes. Mixed flour with SHREDDED cheese and coated evenly - used about 3 tbsps. Slowly whisked in cheese and it was absolutely perfect!

This was sooo good!  Only changes for us were bringing wine to simmer (NOT BOIL), shredding cheeses vs. cubes & coating cheese w/ flour instead of in pot, melts more evenly w/ changes...but the ingredients themselves were perfect!

I gave this 3 stars because it needed some tweaking to be just right.  I followed the recipe and found I had wine and butter with a glob of cheese in the bottom.  In my opinion, you can never have too much cheese, so I added a block of cream cheese and the juice of 1 lemon and VIOLA perfectly creamy, tasty, cheese fondue.  If you LOVE cheese this is the way to go.  The initial recipe gave me the start, since I have never done this before, and the rest was up to me.  I read everyone's suggestions and think I will try the cornstarch next time.

Although easy to make, the flavor was very strong.  I added 4 oz. of Velveeta, which reduced the fondue's "bite" and salvaged a pretty good investment in cheese!

have not tried the recipe as written, only as reviewed (like everyone else)  Warming wine, adding shredded cheese worked great.  I used two kinds of Swiss and a med cheddar.

We had this for New Year's Eve. Wow!  It was so good. We all decided on the spot that this fondue would be our new NYEve tradition.  We did make some adjustments based on other reviews, namely we shredded the cheese and tossed the flour in it - and btw I was not super strict on the exact 7oz of each - I think I had about 8oz of each and just used it all.  Eliminated the butter. We use 1 cup of Reisling and 2 tsp of christopher ranch crushed garlic. OMG to die for yummy.  We also borrowed a friend's electric fondue pot - wow was it awesome - heats up in about 10 sec and you have totally melted fondue in about 3 minutes.  Favorite dipping tidbits: parboiled broccoli, bread, cooked italian sausage, grape tomatoes, parboiled carrots and apples.

This was good.  Maybe it was the chedder I used, but I think chedder is too sharp and doesn't blend well with the swiss of gyuere.

Oh what a waste. I tried it for my Christmas Party tonight and what a waste. It turned out so lumpy. I added more wine, it continued to lump up. The cheese was so expensive and the smell was aweful. Nobody wanted any . NEVER again.

This was wonderful! I was unable to find Emmentaler Cheese exactly, so I substituted a high quality swiss. I also used high quality gruyere and sharp cheddar. (The cheeses were pricey, but I think you have a better result with better cheese selections.) I chose to add Sauvignon Blanc for the wine. We dipped summer sausuage, steamed asparagus, steamed dutch white mini potatoes, pear wedges, and french bread. Everything tasted great! (Especially the pears.)

I've made this the past 4 years on Christmas Eve and its the best fondue! I use a Sauvignon Blanc and serve w/ bread, califlower, granny smith apples and summer sausage. Everyone loves it and it heats up great the next day too!

This was excellent but very, very rich! I don't have a fondue set so I just melted everything in the Slow Cooker and took it to the table. Cut up all kinds of veges & grilled meats to dip with but my favourite was the bread.

This was divine!  It took other reviewer's advice and used Sauvignon Blanc and 1/2 tsp. of lemon juice.  My local grocery store stocks a depressingly weak variety of cheese so I had to substitute an obscure Norwegian cheese for the gruyere.  It still turned out fabulous.  Thanks!

The key to any online recipe is to read the reviews and to tweak it on the feedback given. That in mind, I used a Sauvignon Blanc and substituted Swiss for the Emmentaler (the store didn't have any). I first melted the butter, added the wine, and then tossed in the cubed cheese which I first coated in flour. I whisked everything until smooth and it was delicious. I would also recommend shredding the cheeses for convenience but cubed works just fine. I will definitely be making this again!

I seriously threw everything together in the saucepan and it came out wonderful. and I did not follow the 1 cup white wine because it would have made the cheese too watery, so I used a half cup pinot grigio and more than 7 oz of all the cheeses because I had 5 people and it was allllll gone by the end of the night.

Yummy! A great fondue that is easy to make but so easy to make. I made it exactly by the recipe and it got rave reviews. It is necessary to cook and stir the cheese mixture for at least 10 minutes to get it fully melted. I cooked mine in a saucepan over a grill at a camp pavilion on the lake before adding it to the fondue pot over sterno flame for serving. It got better the longer it cooked. I will make it again.

While the taste was excellent, I made the recipe as described and the whole thing curdled.
I used a dry Riesling as the wine and someone in the reviews mentioned that lemon juice would make it less stringy so I added a little bit and that actually seemed to make it worse. I'm not really sure what happened. I think it was the cheddar. It was fine until I put that in. I might make this again with only half the cheddar.

The flavoring was good but I didn't like the gritty texture. Perhaps I didn't cook the flour long enough? It seemed to be burning rather than cooking, even with the temperature turned down. Careful when choosing the expensive cheeses. Right next to the Gruyere for $9.99/lb was a choice for $19.99/lb. so there are clearly choices out there. Buyer beware!

Probably will add roasted garlic next time but the mixture of cheese flavors was excellent.  Warm the wine first in a pot so the fondue is ready to mix when guests arrive.  (It takes a little while to heat up over the fondue pot.)

I thought this meal was great! Me and a friend made it and it was very good. I would recommend using a little lemon juice to make it less stringy and clumpy and use broccoli and french bread to dip. But it was still great and I will be making it again very soon.

This was a lot better than the traditional Gruyere and Emmentaler fondue. One tip I can say that I got from a fondue cookbook is to take the flour and sprinkle it over your shredded cheese. It sticks to the cheese and then you can add it to the wine. I did make mine in my fondue pot, not on the stove. I also added 1 chopped shallot to the wine. Very delicious! Great with steamed broccoli and apples :)

So yummy!!  I made this for my husband, sister and her husband.  We ate the whole pot!!  I served it with tender crisp cooked baby carrots, brocolli, and cauliflour; mostly cooked potatoes; rustic bread cubes; granny smith apple wedges.

I loved this recipe!!!  So did my guests.  I couldn't find the Emmentaler cheese so I used Edam instead.  No matter.. it was sooooo good.  If you are a cheese fondue lover.... you've got to try this.  I doubled the recipe.  There were some leftovers but this is not a leftover type of dish.  It turned into a breat implant looking thing the next day!  Thanks so much for this recipe Maria.  It reminds me of being a kid and skiiing in Canada where they served this.
YUMMMMM!!
Opps almost forgot... I also used sauvignon blanc wine as others had suggested.

I took this and went further.  I used chicken broth for the wine, because my kids wouldn't eat it otherwise.  I also used extra cheddar in place of the Emmentaler. It was really good!!!  My kids ask for it all the time.  We eat it as a meal.

This was wonderful!! I followed the recipe exactly except - I did add a little bit of lemom juice like the other readers suggested, I think it definately helped to keep cheese from seperating, it came out beautifully! Very rich and I even heated it up the next day and was still yummy! I had it with apple slices (granny smith) and bread, will make again and again!

I only gave it three stars because of what happened, NOT because of the taste.  Oh, it was divine!  I would agree with another reviewer, double the recipe for more than 3 people.  Also, HIGHLY recommend grating, not cubing the cheese.  I did mine on the stove then transferred to the fondue pot, but once it sat for just a little bit it got very very clumpy.  I tossed it back on the stove and added more wine, and although it melted a little bit, eventually I just gave up, put it back on the table and handed out spoons.  Everyone was goodnatured about it.  Sounds like I was the one who did something wrong, though, because so many others have had success.  I served with green and red bell peppers, mushrooms, slightly steamed broccoli (to take out the super-crunch), and LOTS of bread.  Definitely a winner... in the Flavor category! :)

Served this at a girls event and nothing was left!  Great balance of flavor, not too strong.  I did the flour mixed in the cheese before melting, added garlic with the butter and if cheese was too thick I just keept using the wine to thin it out.  Served 24 people and none was left.  Thanks!

After reading the reviews, and making a couple of changes, this turned out wonderful!  As many stated, I tossed the cheese with cornstarch instead of mixing flour with the butter.  I sauteed a garlic clove in the butter before removing the garlic and adding the wine and cheese.  I did use Pinot Grigio (its what I had on hand) and it still turned out great!

I love fondue, but this did not work out as well as I had hoped.  Followed the instructions to the letter.  Had all good brand cheeses.  I did like the flavor, but not the consistency.   The cheese was watery and clogged up on the bottom in the fondue pot.  We think it may have been the cheddar, but this is just a guess.  Won't do again.

I added some parmesan for half of the cheddar because I didnt have sharp cheddar. After it was in the fondue pot I added some fresh cracked black pepper. We dipped butter fried asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, celery and 2 kinds of crusty bread. 

It was the perfect New Year's food! Thanks!

This was quite good, great flavor, but I would have like the consistency to be a little creamier.  I went with the suggestions--shredding the cheese, tossing it with the flour, adding lemon juice.  I had to add a little more wine as I added the cheese b/c it got very thick.  The nice surprise though, is that I had some left over, put it in the fridge, and it actually turned into a really nice cheese spread!  Two recipes in one!

I made this a couple of weeks ago as an appetizer paired with good wine and great friends. It was a hit, though I opted on switching Gruyere cheese for another smooth meltable cheese which was recommended at my market. It was great along with cellery sticks, bread chunks, mini carrots & broccoli...yummm
Also, I had some left over, I refrigerated it and used it the next day in lasagna.

Amazing!!! Used cave-aged Gruyere. Served with celery, carrots, pumpernickel bread, pretzel bread, and grilled bratwurst. Definitely will make again and again!!

This turned out awesome. I used Swiss and Gouda and fresh parmesean. Used a nice white wine that I would drink. I shredded and added the flour to that as others mentioned and it worked great. I melted it on the stove top in a large pot then switched it to my fondue pot so it was faster :) Yumo!

Tried this on Christmas eve - since it was only myself and my fiance we used 4 oz of each cheese - grated them and tossed with the flour - eliminated the butter. I did rub the garlic clove in the fondue pot, and simmered a sauvignon blanc first which has just the right acidity. We did need to use lemon to prevent stringiness and it added a fantastic tang to the dish. It was so good (with a crusty organic french baguette which I cubed) that we made it again last night. I think this is a future favorite. Easy too.

I shredded all of my cheeses to allow for the simplest melting. You can't put cheddar cheese in this fondue with great swiss-style cheeses and expect it to turn out well.  The cheddar acts as it does with all dishes and becomes stringy.  The cheese won't stick to your food the way a good fondue should.  I took out the cheddar on my second try of this recipe.  I used 12 oz. of the Gruyere and of the Emmentaler (Jarlsburg can also be substituted for either of these 2 cheeses and is one of my personal favorites).  It came out great the next time.  Just don't use the cheddar.  It won't turn out like a good fondue should.

I had to make it with chicken broth because the crowd I made it for can't have alcohol. The flavor was still really nice but we did have to work on the consistancy a bit. Ended up adding more liquid and a bit more flour to help it along.

I chose this fondue because it was the only one that seemed to have more than one cheese, and in my opinion - the more cheese, the better!  Anyway, I used the helpful reviews I had read and simmered the wine instead of boiling it.  I also mixed some of the cheese with flour before melting it, which I think helped it melt quite well.  Everyone loved the taste, it was DELICIOUS!  My only complaint is that it got a bit oily and I would constantly have to stir it.  I'm not sure how to solve that, but other than that it was great.  I put out apples, french bread, broccoli and cauliflower to eat with it.  MMMMM!

I served this to friends who had never had fondue. They were impressed! I coated the cheese with 3 tablespoons cornstarch instead of flour and omitted the butter. The fondue pot cookbook says to use Sauvignon Blanc, not Chardonnay.

Great recipe...the only one I found with all three cheeses in it. I changed it just slightly...instead of making the roux (butter and flour) I just tossed the cheeses with 2 Tbsp. cornstarch before I added it to the wine. I also stirred in about 1 Tbsp lemon juice and some dry mustard...just to add a little kick! Thanks for the idea!

This was an excellent fondue recipe! The cheese blend was perfect. Didn't use the stovetop though, just started with boiling the wine in my electric fondue pot and went from there. Turned out perfect.

Recipe is good, but the instructions lack clarity.  DON'T cube the cheese, you are better off shredding the cheese and adding it slowly so that you don't end up using too high of a heat resulting in clumpy fondue.  Also, lightly coat the shredded cheese in flour and it will help reduce the likelihood of the cheese melting into clumps.  If you substitute wine for chicken broth, make sure you also add lemon juice to assist with breaking down the cheese proteins, otherwise you'll also risk having clumpy fondue.

I read a number of the reviews and had some good results.

I can't sit here and say what should or shouldn't be done or why. But I can mention what I did and that it was really good.

I used a sauvignon blanc, just a regular bottle, nothing too pricy, but [arguably] not bottom of the barrel either. Got good cheese, shredded and added the flour to the shredded cheese. I simmered the wine right in the fondue pot and the added the cheese a little at a time. (no butter)

The only real trouble I had was keeping the cheese melted right, but that's hardly the recipes fault, this is my first fondue so I'm still learning how to use the pot.

I had also made this as an appetizer to a steak dish (mustard/parm crusted NY strip) and everyone enjoyed dipping the steak into it more than they did the bread/apple/veg I had prepared.

Wife's Birthday dinner successful, brownie points to offset what I did for v-day accepted. :)

Loved this recipe.  The blend of cheeses was absolutely perfect.  As other reviewers suggested and as is standard for fondue, I tossed 3 T of flour with the cheese rather than making a roux.  i also simmered a crushed garlic clove in the butter 'cause my family and I love garlic.  I added a dash of Worcestershire sauce, but i don't think that was absolutely necessary.  I highly recommend this recipe.  We served it with barely steamed broccoli, cut up apples, raw mushrooms and cut up french bread.

This is a very yummy cheese fondue! I rubbed the inside of my pot with garlic before adding the mixture. I also used a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to keep it grom getting stringy. Also, definitely shred the cheese instead of cubing it. You can really taste the white wine so if you are not a fan you may want to try another recipe. It can also be quite expensive if you use good cheese but it is worth it.

This was divine. For the record I used Pinot Grigio and it was perfectly delicious. I also used about three tablespoons of flour that I tossed with the cheese before adding to the wine. I rubbed the saucepan with a clove of garlic before doing anything. I did use a squeeze or two of fresh lemon. I transferred the whole thing to an electric fondue pot and dipped toasted rosemary & olive oil bread into it. It was a great way to ring in 2011.

For my first time making fondue, this recipe was amazing! I didn't follow the recipe to a T, but i took the advice from the other reviews and used the certain kind of wine thats better and we couldn't find Sharp Cheddar cheese so we just used extra old! I'm am not a big fan of wine so im glad that the flavor was not dominant!

Great!!  But only if you follow the reviews here (thus the 4 stars instead of 5). I mixed the SHREDDED cheese with about 2 tablespoons of flour. Omitted butter. Brought an acidic white wine to a SIMMER. Then put the wine in the fondue pot and slowly stired the cheese/flour mixture in. I added a tablespoon of lemon juice to make sure it was smooth but I doubt I needed it.  Family on Christmas LOVED it and we basically licked the pot clean. Served with bread cubes, raw vegetables, apples, and roasted potatoes. YUMMY!

Following other comments I used 3 tbsp cornstarch instead of flour and left out the butter, and I grated the cheeses in my food processor and mixed the cornstarch in with them before adding to the wine (Sauvignon Blanc). Also, I used Edam in place of Emmentaler, but only because I couldn't get Emmentaler nearby. The result was truly a perfect fondue and my girlfriend loved it!

We liked this a lot.  Chose to use an Irish imported white cheddar and  liked the bite it gave.  Used sauvignon blanc wine - needed a little extra to get a better consistency and just a splash of lemon juice helped too.  Didn't make the white sauce first.  Mixed flour in with cheeses, heated wine in fondue pot and then added cheese/flour mix.

Big hit with the children and our company!!  We ended up dipping french bread and granny smith apples.  What a lot of fun.  Brought back lots of memories of the 70's when I was a kid and used a fondue pot some.

My family loves this one the best.  We do a great deal of "family fun fondue nights" and this one won.  I only gave it 4 stars since the swiss is rather strong for me, but that is how my family likes it, so alas, it stays as is.  I do add some garlic and lemon juice.

This was worse than mozzarella cheese.  It was so stringy we had to pull it apart with our fingers.  I even tried doing the lemon juice trick and we still had to wrestle with it to get it out of the pot.  Will not make this again.

I really liked this fondue.  It's smoother than a cheddar-only fondue and is not quite as strong as an emmentaler/gruyere fondue.  I followed the suggestions in Qwertycake's review (dated 2/18/04) and it came out great.  It didn't turn lumpy at all.

This was the worst cooking disaster I have ever experienced.  I made $50 worth of cheese, for several people, and the whole thing turned into a giant cheese ball.  I can't believe anyone would recommend this recipe. I make fondue quite often and I have never ended up with something unuseable and unsaucy.  This is poor at best.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!!!  I served this with foccacia and granny smith apples.  There were only two of us and we nearly polished it off!   The only suggestion I would have is to shred the cheese, rather than cube it, to reduce the melting time.  Thanks for sharing!!

I've been making cheese fondue for 20 years and this recipe really is wonderful.  I prepared in a deep saucepan, then transferred to fondue pot rubbed with garlic clove.  Also used white Vermont cheddar intead of sharp yellow.  One comment--there's no way this makes 24 servings!  Did this for our family of four (two teenagers) and there was none leftover!

Great cheese fondue recipe and very easy to make.  We had it with granny smith apples and bread and it was delicious.  The recipe makes a huge batch of cheese, so you may want to cut the recipe down if you only have a few people.

Loved this recipe!!!  I shredded the cheese and added the flour directly into the cheese before hand.  I didn't use butter at all. And I never used a sauce pan. I just slowly added the cheese to the SIMMERING wine.  Everyone loved it including the kids....

I used sauvignon blanc for the wine.  Perhaps it was the cheese I bought, but the fondue turned out slightly gritty.  The taste was great and it was really easy to make.  I will definitely try it again with different cheese.

Excellent recipe! I made all in the fondue pot. Heated wine to a boil. Like others suggested, I simply mixed the flour with the cheese, and added a cup at a time to the wine. Turned heat down to 250 -warm and enjoyed immensly with cauliflower, carrots, apples, pumpernickel bread, and grilled chicken.

The flavors in this cheese fondue are delicious! All 3 cheeses blended very well together. This was the first cheese fondue I have ever made homeade and it is definitely a "make again." We dipped crusty french bread, vegetables, bite-sized pieces of filet mignon, and roasted red potato wedges in this mixture. It was divine! I might add a little more white wine next time to thin out the fondue just a little bit...

Like everyone else. Some personal changes were made. Instead of using a dry white wine, I used Magners hard cider.  Secondly instead of flour I used cornstarch.  I omitted the butter and had roasted some garlic and rubbed that around the pot.  Shredding is totally the way to go for the cheese.

I simmered versus boiled.  I gave the recipe a 5 since it pretty much gave me a simple starting point and the flavors were great. If you gave this a bad review then cooking is not your forte. The idea is to change things to your liking.  That's how recipes evolved over the years.

I am sure this recipe would be considered great by those who were fondue aficianados. The expensive cheese and wine married perfectly, no problems with all of the great suggestions here. My issue is that I was not prepared for the flavors of these cheeses (I confess I am a beginner foodie), and my family of 5 deemed it inedible. In fact, this was our first fondue experience, and as dissapointed as we were with this, we abandoned our plans to have chocolate fondue as a dessert! To add insult to injury, the cheese burned in the bottom of my fondue pot (my fault entirely) and the smell from these cheeses is forever implanted in my nasal cavaties. Suffice it to say that I will NOT be making this again.

I make this all the time and love it!! - I ususally grate the cheese as am too hungry to weight for cubes to melt - also, heat the wine in the microwave - but usually room temp is okay too - just bring to simmer before adding cheese.

This recipe was excellent! Tried it out for the first time on New Year's Eve...usually don't do first time recipes when we have guests. Had a ready-made fondue from the grocers as back-up just in case. This was simple though. Heated, didn't boil Robt. Mondavi Sauvingnon Blanc (sp?) and then added that to the roux and then the cheeses. Excellent...served it with cut and heated whole grain bread. Simple and delish! Thanks ;)

Forgot to add the cheddar, but my family didn't notice until we'd eaten the entire pot. Wonderful, but don't skimp and buy cheap cheese. I also just simmered, rather than boiling the wine.

I thought this was pretty delicious. I used a dry sauvignon blanc and the only real 'adjustment' I made was to rub garlic on the fondue pot and cook it in the cheeses. It came out great, and was my first time making a 'from scratch' fondue. A keeper!

I've made this recipe two or three times and really enjoy it.  This time, I had a hard time finding the Ementaler cheese, so I ended up using Jarlsburg instead and it worked.  I followed another review's advice about adding some lemon juice to help break up the cheese, because I didn't have any Cabernet Sauvignon (only Chardonnay).  We used two kinds of bread, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower and celery for dipping.  Delicious!

Disappointing. Tastes OK but the (inexpensive) cheddar masks the exquisite tastes of the (expensive)Emmenthaler and Gruyere.  Try this recipe for 24 servings using 10 1/2 oz each of the latter two cheeses and win adoration from your friends and family.

I love fondue! This was a great. I toasted baguette slices, and also served with small sausages and fried potato chunks. While I loved the flavor, my family (who are more of the "Velveeta" type) found it a bit too "whangy". I don't agree, and since I'm the cook, I give this recipe a five star.

I made this for a wine and cheese party. It was perfect!!! Everyone loved its smooth taste. It was an excellent compliment to everything else served without going overboard. I even loved it, and I am not a swiss cheese fan. It went excellently with a dry crusty bread.

I thought this recipe was just so-so.  The cheese was really expensive.  The flavours were just okay.  Not bland, but just okay.  Not good enough to justify spending that much money on the cheese, let alone time it took to cut into cubes.  Like another reviewer said, just shred.

I've made this fondue twice and both times have been a great success.  The first time my boyfriend and I made it for ourselves, definitely more than we needed!  The second time was for a potluck and we served it with Zenners sausages.  It was a hit!  I will definitely make it again!

I had the same separation problem others have mentioned, but I have to say, after adding quite a bit more wine (I used chardonnay) it smoothed out.  I wonder if part of the problem was the cheap cheddar I used.  Next time I'll fork over for better quality.  The Gruyere and Emmentaler were really good.  I cut the recipe down to "6" servings and it was just right for a first course for my husband and me.

This recipe was very good. People who had trouble are doing something very very wrong because I had never made fondue before and it was a breeze. I didn't shred my cheese, but did cut into very small pieces. Constant stirring as you melt the cheese and continued heat while it sits in your fondue pot (sterno) are a must.  I will try with garlic next time, that sounds amazing!

Being that it's still baseball season here I made this fondue for dipping with soft pretzels.  It was wonderful.
A big hit at the family reunion.

Tried making this for a Christmas party and I have to say it was awful.  Smelled bad, tasted okay, was smooth after initially making it, but when we left it alone for more than 2 minutes without stirring in the fondue pot, it became a giant clump.  Quite a waste for such expensive cheeses.

In a word... Amazing! Even better than the fondue restaurants. I followed the recipe but added a drop of lemon juice, Worcestershire, and a garlic rubbed fondue pot. Do not skimp on lesser cheeses as the flavor combination of the 3 in this recipe combine for a deep rich flavor that everyone marveled over. I served it with several types of apple slices, pear slices, baby carrots, and crusty french bread. It's so quick and easy to prepare and will be enjoyed at my house on a regular basis :)

Absolutely excellent. The Sauvignon blanc is a must and the tang of the cheddar, perfection. BUT... The directions stink! I looked up Alton Brown's directions, cause seriously, that guy knows everything! (1) use good cheese b/c the oils help in melting. (2) GRATE the cheese (3) omit butter and flour and instead mix 2- 3 tbsp of corn starch into the shreaded cheese. Use your hands to make sure the starch is fully integrated. (4) on a stove top heat Sauvignon Blanc wine to simmer. Add juice of 1/2 lemon (not bottled) and SLOWLY add cheese stirring constantly (I used a whisk) add more wine if too thick. (5) transfer to fondue pot and keep warm with very low flame. The cheese will become grainy if it gets too hot. This was a hugh hit at my Superbowl party. Definitely making again!

I followed John's suggestions, used Gruyere, extra-sharp white cheddar, and Jarlsberg cheeses because that's what I could find easily, and it was wonderful! I especially appreciated the suggestions of pears and steamed potatoes for dipping. This is our new favorite recipe for cheese fondue - thanks for a great recipe!!

First time I ever did fondue and this was really good. I added the flour to the shredded cheese's like others suggested and it came out perfect, nice and smooth! I couldn't find the Emmentaler so I replaced that with fontina and it was great.

Thia is outstanding!!!  I'm making it for the second time tonight.  As suggested, I rubbed the pot with garlic, shredded the cheese and tossed the flour into the cheese (I ended up having to use a little more to get the right consistency). I added a little bit of lemon juice when the cheese was almost melted to keep it from clumping.  I served it with apple slices and a nice french bread.  This is a new favorite!!!!

This recipe was great.  I used Reisling for the wine wine, grated gruyere and cubed/diced emmantaller & cheddar (because they came pre-sliced at sam's club and it was easier to just dice them up).  No clumping and I did not need to use any lemon juice as suggested by others who rated this recipe.

This is the first time I've made cheese fondue and this recipe was easy and delicious! I took advice of others and shredded the cheese and then mixed with the flour before adding to the wine. I had a slight problem with the fondue separating, but that was fixed by putting it back on the stove. I was very happy with this recipe.

totally excellent. make sure you use very sharp cheddar; otherwise the fondue won't have quite enough "bite".    I grate all of the cheese instead of cubing it - easy peasy.

I thought this was very good. Apparently my family does not care for cheese fondue, so I had most of the batch leftover. I layered peeled sliced potatoes, onions, chopped leftover ham, 1/2 of the leftover fondue, repeated the layering and baked for about an hour at 350 degrees. It was terrific!

I made this fondue for a birthday dinner party and followed the recipe to a T, using a nice Reisling for the wine.  It was wonderful!  It received rave reviews, and even the 2-year-old loved it.  I highly recommend this recipe, and will definitely make it again.

This was my first time making fondue but my husband and I enjoyed it very much and this is an excellent recipe.  We did as suggested and grated the cheese and it went very smoothly.

I couldn't find Emmentaler, so used Gruyere, Jarlsberg and white cheddar, and I used Pinot Grigio (since that's what I had). I took a lot of reviewer suggestions:  added a little lemon juice, added butter to pan to warm up with wine (probably didn't need the butter), and sprinkled flour throughout the cheese.  I served this at a party with crusty bread, granny smith apple, cherry tomatoes, cauliflower, blanched broccoli, and meatballs.  It was SCRUMPTIOUS!!!  My friends have already requested we do it again next month at our next gathering - YUM!!!

I found this recipe to be excellent. This was the second fondue I have ever attempted and it turned out great. I followed the suggestions here: shredded cheese, no butter, cornmeal, mixing the cornmeal with the cheese. It turned out excellent. I had problem with stringiness but only when the cheese got cold, as long as it was warm it was very easy to dip and eat. I reheated it twice with out problem. ON the second reheat it did get oily but with a little more heating and stirring fixed that.

I love this recipe.  Making a roux is the only way I have been able to consistently make a great fondue.  Try subbing in smoked gouda for one of cheeses to add a nice smoky flavor.

I am a cheese lover and I made this for my friend's birthday party and we loved it.  Would definitely make it again.  My fondue pot wasn't the best so I might buy a better one because the cheese was still a little harder than it should have been and it stuck to the bottom of the pot.  But overall it tasted great!!!

This was really good. We had a lot leftover! My boys (age 3 and 5) did not care for the flavor. I'd like to substitue the swiss cheese for something else. Any suggestions?

This would have been great if it hadn't been so buttery. I follwed the directions to a T but the butter just sat on the top of the fondue. I'll try this recipe again in the future, I think I can fix it. I think people are correct in saying that you should use corn starch rather than the butter and flower it calls for.

This was nice and easy and tasted great.  We had it with bread, granny smith apples and asparagus.  I made it right in the fondue pot (ours can go on the stove) and just warmed the wine a bit in the microwave rather than boiling it, to avoid using an extra pot.

Hands down this is *the best* cheese mixture out there. I ended up using 7oz, 6oz & 6oz of the Sharp Cheddar, Emmentaler & Gruyere respectively because that's what was available at the store. Amazing!

This was just so close to perfection! 4.5 stars! I feel like its just a tad bit bland, but that is also possibly because I couldn't find emmantler cheese, I picked up a medium hard yellow swiss.  I don't live in an area that has a big variety so I might just need to add spices next time. Thank you to the fellow who suggested sauvignon blanc and mentioned that its an adult dish that needs wine. I made this and split the cheese and half and used chicken broth for one batch and the wine for the other batch. It was OBVIOUS that the batch with the wine was superior. But he's right, its not supposed to be kid friendly, if you want it kid friendly, just serve up some cheese wiz.

This was my second time making this recipe, but the first time was several years ago, so I didn't remember my technique or results at all. We were feeding 5 Adults and 5 kids, so I was unsure about whether I should make a double batch. Definitely not necessary. We had some other foods, and lots of dippers, and the single batch worked for us, with leftovers. (The kids ate very little of it) I did add extra wine before I even transferred to the fondue pot because the cheese was already getting a bit too thick for dipping. Sauvignon Blanc worked great as other reviewers suggested, and shredding the cheese made  it so much easier to melt.

I’ve made this 6 years in a row for a New Year’s Eve snack and it’s been very good every time. I’ve tried it with 3-4 different wines, from really cheap cooking wines to more expensive table whites, and the result is as good each time. I’ve also switched out the sharp cheddar (dubliner, extra sharp white cheddar) to go with the emmenthaler and gruyere with good success. We love cubed sourdough bread with an extra chewy crust for dipping.

Followed the recipe nearly exactly - we grated the cheese instead of cubing it, but otherwise exactly step by step.  We used an inexpensive but palatable white wine blend (wish I knew the varietals!). Silky-smooth texture and tasted great. We had leftovers only because there was so much other food, so we reheated it on our roasted potatoes the next day. no need to change the recipe (other than grating making it easier to melt) and please don't use processed cheese.

I love this recipe. I've made it several time and find it pairs nicely with a fresh baguette, maybe some apples, and a crisp white wine. For those that gave it a low rating, make sure you're using the cheeses suggested. While emmentaler is a Swiss cheese, it's not the same animal as the ordinary (softer) Swiss cheese you might find at the grocery. Also, adding the cheese a little at a time is key, giving it time to thoroughly melt and blend. If it's turning into a blob of goo, a dash or two of lemon juice will help (not too much). There is an art to making a good cheese fondue, and this recipe is good.

Very good! I didn't know what emmentaler was but it is a mild soft swiss cheese. Added with the Swiss and greyuere makes for  a delicious blend for Nat'l fondue day!!

My family loved this recipe!  I could not find Emmentaler cheese so my hubby looked up a good sub for it & we used Jarlsberg;  I grated the cheeses for easier melting, as other reviewers suggested.  It was delicious; very thick & gooey.  We dipped sourdough bread, soft pretzels, apples, pears, mushrooms,  broccoli.

Very nice flavor. I didn't have a problem with unmelted cheese as some have described.  I used a Sauvignon blanc instead of chardonnay and will add a little more next time since it was just a tad too thick.

I halved the recipe and it was so delicious!  I used Chateau St. Michelle Chardonnay, Boar's Head Gruyure, Emmi Emmentaler, and Tillamook Sharp Cheddar.  I cooked all of it in my electric fondue pot, instead of transferring it from the cooking pan.

I just tried this recipe last night, and per others suggestions I made a few alterations that I was happy with. 

1) I bought all three of my cheeses at Trader Joes
2) I cut them into cubes then put them in my Vitamix Blender to 'shred' them.
3) I put the cheese in a plastic Ziploc bag and mixed about 2 teaspoons of flour and 1 teaspoon of cornstarch into the bag.  The reason I put them into the bag is because I prepped EVERYTHING for my fondue party ahead of time.  So you could skip this step if you were making the fondue right away... but don't skip the flour and cornstarch. 
4) I heated the wine- used a dry pinot grigio in my enameled cast iron put.  Cut a garlic glove in half and let that just hang out in there.  Once the wine was about to boil, I stirred the cheese in.
5) Right before I transferred it to the fondue pot holder, I squeezed 2 lemon slices into the cheese mixture.  (I just left the garlic clove in there to hang out.... no harm)
It was delicious, not to 'stinky cheese', very good light flavor, and coated the bread and apple slices awesome!

This was a huge hit with our dinner guests! I could not find Emmantaler so I substituted with Gouda.  I baked beer bread for dipping and was pleased with that choice.

I used low sodium chicken stock instead of white wine since I don't like cooking with alcohol. I also didn't have Emmentaler cheese so I used a little mozzarella. It came out great. I had no problem cubing 1/2" pieces and stirring in the cheese in small batches with a silicone whisk till it all melted. My husband and I ate this with tortilla chips. My only complaint was I'd prefer it a little more smooth so I'll try the lemon juice trick next time.

We just got a fondue pot and were eager to try it out for Valentines day. This recipe was easy and so yummy! We couldn't believe how tasty it was and how fun! We will be making this one again and maybe next time for company! Half ing the recipe was perfect for two with bread, broccoli, zucchini, carrots and pepperoni.

Followed the recipe and we loved it. The only problem we had is that the cheese started to harden and clump in the fondue pot. Not sure how to keep the same consistency from the beginning but other than that my family enjoyed it.

Wonderful and easy to boot! We dipped broccoli, apples, and home made bread (Artisan bread in 20 min a day basic recipe) It was a nice change form our regular Swiss fondue

Mine came out really lumpy and didn't have much flavor. I'm rating it as I made it before I made adjustments. I added a pinch of nutmeg, salt, and some garlic powder which gave it a little flavor. Where did I go wrong?

Made this for New Years Eve and was a hit for my family. The taste was fabulous and very simple to make. We heated the leftovers in a saucepan, added salsa and poured over chips for nachos. Wow, yummy!

This was a delicious blend of cheeses.  I used a smoked sharp cheddar which was an excellent choice.  It doesn't get 5 stars because it wasn't as creamy or coating the food as well as we like.

I sort of made this for my son's first birthday party. I only used two types of cheese and I added some garlic powder, mustard powder, and nutmeg. It was so good even though I didn't follow exactly.

Made fondue for a wine pairing party.  Success!  Everyone loved it.  My fondue pot sucked, it would be to hot or to cold.   We added some more warm Chardonnay which helped out a bit.  Cheeses worked well together.  Easy recipes Easy prep!

The cheese was really good.  I cooked it in my fondue pot.  It kept getting clumpy though which I couldn't understand why.  We had to keep stirring it every so often to be able to actually dip things in!

Yum. Yum yum yum yum. We followed the advice of others and used Sauvignon Blanc. Our supermarket didn't have Emmentaler so we substituted a very expensive regular swiss. We grated the cheese prior to adding it to the wine, and stirred constantly as it melted. I also added a little kirsch. The taste and texture were perfect! Great recipe!

I thought this was very good!.. I did add some some garlic powder and a dash of dry mustard, salt and pepper!.. When I got done it was too thick, so I reduced a little more wine down and whisked it in.. Served for my sons b-day dinner.  I thought it was great.. Not really the flavors the kids go for though!..
