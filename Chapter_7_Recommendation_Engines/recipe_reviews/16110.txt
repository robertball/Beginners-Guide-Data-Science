I took this to work, as one co-worker is vegetarian.  Everyone raved about the salad. 

Three minor adjustments:  I added a whole (6oz) carton of herb feta cheese, used a small can of olives and added 1/2 chopped green pepper.

This was a big hit.  I now know what I'll be bringing to BBQs this summer.  I took the advice of others and halved the olives and increased the feta to 3 oz or so.  I also added 1tsp of dried oregano.

What this recipe might lack in imagination and creativity is more than made up for in taste and presentation.  I feel for any recipe submitter who has no choice but to list strict amounts of ingredients when that may or may not be their intent. Therefore, I'm sure the submitter would agree to add any ingredients, including the amount of dressing, to taste rather than specific measurements - which is what I did. I used my own lemon vinaigrette for the dressing which for my tastes is infinitely preferable to the "in" balsamic vinaigrettes. Other than that I used the ingredients as called for in the recipe with no additions or omissions save for some chopped parsley, although the leftover rotisserie chicken I have in the fridge looks like a promising addition for lunch today. Classic, light and refreshing, can't-go-wrong, good-for-you salad at a fraction of the cost you'd pay for it in your deli.

Super with even some of the ingredients! I only added the cucumbers and substituted green onions for the red onion. Didn't have any feta...but I'm sure it would be great! I was surprised and glad that the cucumbers didn't go soggy overnight in the dressing.  Thanks for this recipe.

I did my best to cut this recipe in half. I did end up adding in more cherry tomatoes and feta cheese. I used a homemade dressing for this salad which had garlic in it, so I did not add the garlic called for in this recipe. I made this early this morning as I wanted the salad to sit in the fridge until lunch. I thought this was one of the best tossed salads I've had in quite some time. One serving of this was quite filling and very satisfying. I'll make this again soon.

Wow! Tangy and tasty! This salad really adds some zip to a meal.
I added extra feta. My husband loved it too. Keeps well in the fridge over a few days.

This is a great healthy recipe, and it's super easy.  I did a couple things differently.  Instead of using Italian-style dressing I substituted 1 1/2 tbls of olive oil and a couple small (capful) splashes of red wine vinegar.  Much fresher!  I also added a yellow pepper to the list of ingredients to add more variety.  The key to the recipe is the lemon juice....squeeze a real lemon (not lemon juice) it's so much more fresh and tasty, and it really brings the recipe alive!

This was awesome! I love any recipe that incorporates garbanzo beans! It was so hearty that I actually ate it over a salad. The dressing from the bean salad was more than enough flavor for my entire salad!

Everyone loved this, even my husband that doesn't like garbanzo beans liked them in this salad.  I used regular tomatoes, didn't add lemon juice as didn't have any.

Easy, quick, and delicious!  I'd recommend either using an English cucumber or scraping out the seeds of a regular cucumber.

My husband doesn't like beans and he loves this! My changes were: half garbanzo and half black beans, 5-8oz of feta, 10-15 halved kalamata olives, oregano, and yellow bell pepper for color. Yummy! Thanks Kim.

Make it 4 ounces of black olives, 4+ ounces feta and 24 cherry tomatos. This is the best non lettuce salad I have ever made!  Don't be afraid to use both cucumbers, it turns out great!

Very good.  I did also cut down on the olives (about 1/2 can, increased the tomatoes and served the feta on the side as I don't care for it.  But it was easy, different, healthy and tasty.  I served with the Souvlaki recipe from this site which is excellent!

This was a great recipe. As suggested by other reviewers I used less olives (about 4-5 oz, more feta cheese (about 3-4 oz), and more garlic (you can't use too much in our house). I used Paul Newman's italian-style dressing as it has tons of seasonings and doesn't seem as oily as other italian dressings. I thought it tasted much better the next day then just after a couple hours. I'm not a huge fan of garbanzo beans, but this salad was wonderful. I'll be making this regularly. Thank you Kim!

A great salad!  Like someone else suggested, I used creamy italian salad dressing instead of regular italian.  I also used considerably less olives than what it called for, a 4 ounce can instead of 15 ounces, and increased the feta to probably 2-3 ounces.  It turned out great and got a lot of compliments at the cook-out where it was served.

One of my new favorites!  An awesome salad to keep on hand for a light dinner, great for a summer potluck too!  I followed the recipe exactly but threw in the whole package of cherry toms & a little extra garlic; used about 3/4 can of black olives.  I peeled the cucumbers, used a mandolin to slice them at 1/4", then halved the rounds.  I used a metal measuring spoon to remove the center translucent fleschy area (where the seeds are) from each of the halved slices, hoping to keep excess liquid to a minimum and increase the salad's fridge life.  It was a bit tedious, but worth the effort.  The salad was as good on day 4 as day 1!  A keeper... thanks Kim!

My husband and I enjoyed this salad. We wanted to try something different. It had good flavor. It was quick to prepare and went great with breadsticks. I would recommend doubling the feta cheese because what they recommended just didn't seem like enough.

A very zesty salad and keeps well in the frig for several days.  I'm vegan so I ommitted the feta cheese.  It was very tasty!

This was great!  I had some friends over for lunch and served it without even testing it first.  I seeded the cucumber and used fat free italian dressing, otherwise, made it exactly as written.  Was the first time I've eaten Feta cheese, also. Will definitely make again.

This was a delicious and wonderful salad idea.  I used a container of garlic and herb feta and then topped it off with sliced pepperoncini's because I like a little bit of a kick.  Next time I make this I am going to use half garbanzos and half kidney beans and add some artichoke hearts. I will make this again and again.  Thanks again for a great idea!

Great alternative to a Greek Pasta Salad.  I added a little more feta, garlic salt and two teaspoons of oregano and it was perfect.  I have made this 3 times already and plan to make it again and agin.  It's very quick and easy!!

This is fantastic. I did use Greek dressing because I had it on hand and it's very similar to Italian so I didn't think it would make much of a difference. The flavours are lovely and this is a super healthy dish people can enjoy on a hot summer day. :) Thanks!!

Substituted some sliced kalamata olives in place of plain old black olives to give it a more Mediterranean flavor.  Also used Balsamic dressing as I did not have any Italian on hand.  More cheese please!  I used the whole package (3.5oz) of feta.  One ounce just wouldn't have been sufficient.

I liked this healthful salad, loaded with good nutrients and flavors.   I would have added more feta cheese to it.  Also it did leave a strong after-taste.  I would make it again because it was quick and easy to prepare, and even tasted good as leftovers.

Awesome.  I added a little more fetta (4 oz.) and decreased the olives (7 oz.).  Prep time is more than 10 min., more like 45 min.  But, it is well worth it.

Yum!  Healthy, tasty, fresh.  I love this recipe.  It takes a bit of chopping but it's totally worth it.  This is a great dish to bring to a summer potluck.

Awesome salad! By the way, garbanzo beans are chick peas (in case you didn't know!). I used one large cucumber and thought it was too much; I will use half and cut it small next time. Increased the feta to about three ounces. I made my own Italian dressing from a recipe on AR. Definitely let this one sit overnight, it gets better with age!

I eat greek salad almost every day but never thought of adding garbanzo beans to it! For this already this recipe deserves 5 stars - what a great idea, they go so well with feta cheese...mmm. Now I'm on garbanzo bean kick and want to add it to everything - which is not bad since chick peas is very healthy and choke full of vitamins. I always use EVOO instead of italian dressing, no garlic and any tomatoes I have on hand. It's also great with any lettuce/spinach. Skip salt - there is plenty there from feta cheese. And the more garbanzo beans you add, the tastier;)

Outstanding! Used kalamata olives and balsamic vinegar and olive oil for the dressing.  Added some oregano and maybe a 1/4 tsp of the garlic salt and increased the pepper cause that is the way I like it. Healthy and delish. Bravo!

Very flavorful and colorful.  The only change I made was to use green onions instead of the red.  This is a great potluck or picnic recipe, and for low-carb folks, it's high in fiber.  Thanks!

This is very good, however, I am Greek, and I would never put canned ripe olives in a Greek recipe.  Use kalamata olives and you only need about 1/4 cup chopped, it adds great flavor without overpowering the dish.  I would also add more feta cheese and omit the salt.  I added some fresh herbs, basil, oregano, parsley (dried would be fine, either Italian seasoning or individual herbs).
We loved this recipe, but with the changes I made.

I added pasta and used a Greek dressing recipe from this site (it's a red wine vinegar and lemon juice sauce) and it was outstanding. Make sure you allow enough time for it to chill.

Great salad!  I love chick peas and feta cheese so I knew I would like this.  I skipped the olives because my husband hates olives but it is still delicious without them!

Yummy and easy to make :)  I added more feta cheese, but that's because I really love feta.  I found some mixed heirloom type tomatoes and used those in place of the cherry- but that was because the prices was right and the colors were nice with the salad! Very good!

This reminds me of a salad I order at a local Greek restaurant but I don't think they use Italian dressing.  The next time I make this I will be omitting the Italian dressing because it's masking all the wonderful flavors this salad has.  Maybe oil & vinegar next time?  Would have also been much tastier with Spanish olives.  If you stick to this recipe AS IS, you're after texture, not taste.  You can pretty much mess up (not dress up) anything with Italian dressing.

My husband's verdict:  Excellent!  I added more feta, as others suggested, and reduced the olives and cucumber by half (personal preference).  Will definitely make again.  I'll add some parsley next time.
UPDATE: I've been making this salad all summer, and I can't make it fast enough.  It disappears almost as soon as it's made!

This was wonderful and my family absolutely loved it! I did use dried garbanzo beans instead of canned and a homemade Greek salad dressing that my family has been using for years only because I like to control what kinds of preservatives and such our family eats.

I just made it for a potluck tonight. I had to taste test it, and it's delicious. I'm sure it will get even better after sitting the refrigerator for a few hours.  The flavors blend so well together.  I followed the recipe exactly, then added a bit of garlic salt, basil, and oregano.  The fresh squeezed lemon added the perfect zing.
This will be a summer favorite, especially as our garden full of cucumbers and tomatoes ripen.  I will likely add extra feta next time and maybe try some parmesan.

I loved this recipe.  It was fabulous.  I used all the vegetable ingredients with the exception of olives, since I didn't have any.  Instead of using the dressing here, I used an Italian dressing from this site.  The recipe turned out great!!

This salad is great, I can eat it several days in a row and not get sick of it.  I use Newmans Own Greek Vinagrette dressing & it's perfect!  I substitute Kalmata olives for the regular black olives, they are delicious & taset more authentically Greek to me.

LOVE THIS! I used Mediterranean/Greek salad dressing because I happened to have it on hand and thought it would work well. This makes a lot, and I was worried that the leftovers would get soggy, but I think it was even better the next day after all the flavors had time to soak through.

great!  Used the kalamata olives, added a can of black beans and a finely diced jalapeno pepper.  Also more feta.  Not sure if used full half cup of salad dressing just enough to cover everything.    Great to make ahead for picnic or pot luck.   Made it 2 days in a row.

Excellent recipe...very adaptable and versatile!  The great thing about this - you don't really need to measure anything, which I didn't, but I did scale it back.  I left out the red onion and added in some chopped red bell pepper.  Prefer homemade dressing, so used lemon juice, red wine vinegar, olive oil, garlic, greek oregano and salt/pepper.

This was a great, tasty and easy to put together salad. I subbed grape tomatoes for the cherry since I have an abundance of them in the garden. I also doubled up on the feta. This will be a favorite for the summer! Thanks for posting.

Wow! I have been making this recipe for years and can't believe I've never rated it. It is fantastic as is and is open to all kinds of adjustments depending on ingredients on hand. More cheese is always better.

Beautiful and delicious! I added some chopped celery and dressed with olive oil and red wine vinegar (salt and pepper) instead of using Italian styled salad dressing. This salad is colorful and is a nice change from a garden green.

Well, I really cant rate this since i totally changed the recipe to Italian. Used fresh mozeralla cheese instead of Feta. I didnt add cucumber but I doubled up on the tomatoes. I skipped the lemon  juice. I added some salami and pepperoni! This recipe was just what i needed to get a twist of Chi-Chi's antipast salad!

This recipe is great as is and the best is that allows for multiple combinations. I grabbed what I had around the house so replaced cucumbers for green peppers, Italian dressing for red wine vinegar + olive oil and also added dried italian seasoning. It turned out great. Very refreshing and crunchy. On the down side, this is not a salad that you can do ahead of time because the vegetables become soggy, so do it 3 hours ahead at the max.

Yum! Made exactly as directed, and I was pleasantly suprised! I love that it didn't call for too much dressing. I used Ken's light Northern Italian dressing... more cheesy than normal Italian which I love. Oh, I did use freshly chopped tomato instead of cherry tomato. So healthful and a great salad to keep in the fridge for a snack!

Not what I was hoping for. It was missing something . I followed the recipe but now I wonder should I have rinsed the beans . It said just drain but for some reason the salad had a fishy taste and I wasn’t serving fish with it. Curious!

This is a great recipe.  I made one change by adding sliced radishes and cubed mozzerella, instead of the feta cheese.  Will use this recipe again.

Pretty good, and I like new ways to use garbanzo beans. More feta is welcome, and instead of using premade dressing I just did a quick drizzle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, although go easy on the vinegar :)

This was fantastic.  I will be making this often.  We added more feta, but otherwise it made it written.  I should also say that it is far better fresh, we had some leftovers the next day and it was not nearly so nice.

I thought this tasted good. I made 1/2 a recipe to try it. I followed the recipe, except I cut back the red onion and black pepper to taste. I liked everything about the salad, but I thought the dressing was a little sweet and the olives were a little tart. Make sure to use a dressing you really like. I think homemade Italian dressing would have been best. I also used kalamative olives and think regular black olives in a can, which are more mild, would have been best.

A great base to tweak to your liking. I think next time I will use a Greek vinaigrette.. less onion... more feta... as it is it is still pretty great!

The flavor of this salad depends on what dressing you use. I used Briannas Home Style Real French Vinaigrette Dressing. I brought it to a potluck at work, and it was a huge hit!

I followed this recipe exactly, except that I doubled the Feta per many reviewer suggestions. Unfortunately, it wasn't well liked by anyone at our 11 person gathering. I was hoping that the flavors would marinate overnight, but it was rather drab. 

An old recipe that I'd used before with garbanzo beans and a vinaigrette dressing had much more flavor, possibly because the directions included heating the beans prior to the marinade process?

Yummy! This is the second time I have made this salad. I made it this past weekend for my Mom's surprise party as she loves everything with the flavors of Greek cuisine. I did manage to find a Greek salad dressing this time around and used that instead of the Italian. I thought both versions were great! Thank you Kim for posting this recipe.

Great recipe, and even better tasting on the second day! Just did a few tweaks like some other users: more feta, and I used an oil & vinegar dressing with some basil & oregano. I think I have found my new favorite salad!

I read a review that stated Greek dressing would be more appropriate.I use Italian dressing, because it's sweeter. I use celery too, and sometimes change up the black olives for green pimento or garli stuffed olives instead. Either way, this salad is a hit! Cudos!

Excellent! I used Greek Salad Dressing rather than Italian.  A great "meat-free" dish during Lent.

Thanks for the great recippe!  I made it just as written except that I used green onion instead of red and 6 oz feta instead of 1 (what's the point of using 1 oz?  You won't be able to taste it).

This is really good and a good source of protein.  I did add more feta.  Word of warning, this is very garlicy.  I personally like garlic but this was alot.

could have used a little more seasoning.  maybe it was just the salad dressing I used (Newman's Own Tuscan Italian), and I also did not have any red onion.

Fabulous flavor, easy to make, and presents beautifully. The best Italian salad dressing is Paul Newman's! That's what I used. Thanks, Kim Fusich!

Nice and refreshing! =]  I made only a couple of changes.  I had a carton of cherry tomatoes, so I just went ahead and used all of it.  I also had a 5 oz. container of feta cheese, and probably would have used all of that too, except I wanted to save a little bit for another salad.  I left out the onion, but only because I don't care for them.  The only real suggestions I would make is to add more feta, and probably use less Italian dressing.  I think it turned out a little too mushy with the amount this recipe called for.  Perhaps add it little by little to see what consistency you are happy with.

Very delicious. I skipped the italian dressing but used 4 oz of feta, extra lemon juice, extra tomatoes, fresh kalmata olives and a drizzle of olive oil.  Colorful, refreshing and healthy.

YUM!! I'm a big fan of chopped salads, and this is a wonderful, light version. Very easy to throw together to. It tastes even better after you let it sit so the flavors can blend. I followed the recipe as closely as possible, I may have used a bit more cheese but I was guessing since I could only find an 8 oz container of Feta in the store. Perfect summer side dish!

It was a good salad, but if you truly want it to be Greek then omit the Italian dressing and use oil and vinegar and add some oregano like I did.

Very good.  No strong flavors, but refreshing and satisfying.  I was surprised at how quick it was to make.  I didn't give it five stars because it was a tiny bit bland, but I'm sure if I use a dressing with a little more bite, it would be perfect.  I used Kraft Italian Vinaigrette.  Not bad, but I'm sure there are better.  Any suggestions?

This is wonderful, especially on a beautiful, sunny day like today.  I didn't wait for it to be thoroughly chilled and still, it was delicious.  I used just a touch more feta cheese; other than that, the amounts of the remaining ingredients were right on.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

Excellent recipe!  This is a great way to use up vegetables.  I added extra tomatoes because I needed to use them up, which meant I had to add some extra dressing, salt, pepper and lemon.  I also used green olives instead of black and used 4 oz. of Feta.  I used Annie's Naturals Tuscany Italian Dressing and this came out great!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I only used one can of garbanzo beans and one cucumber. I added some whole wheat pasta and used a 6 oz. package of feta. I didn't have Italian dressing so I used 1/2 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (one whole lemon). I also did not use the garlic salt since there was two cloves of garlic in it already and used salt instead. With these changes we loved this salad.

Very very good, the only change I made was to not to mix in the feta cheese. I love feta so instead I crumbled mine on top of the salad. I will be making this again!

Very yummy salad.  I used less dressing and more feta cheese - and we enjoyed this salad a lot.  This will be a great summer salad - cool with very fresh tastes - will make this one again.

Tasty and filling!  I agree with many other reviewers in that I need more feta cheese.  Black olives are also not my favorite olives, so the next time I will use Kalamata olives.

I altered it to our liking.  It was delicious!!! I added 2 additional cucumbers, a whole container of cherry tomatoes and 8 ounces of feta instead of 1 oz. I also used Ken’s Greek dressing instead of Italian.  I will definitely make this again.

I was intrigued by this one. Don't really care for garbanzo beans, but thought I needed a lower fat meal after a heart attack! It is REALLY good. I did add a little more of the other ingredients than called for, just because I needed a larger amount. Leftovers have kept well for several days.

I have made this twice, followed the recipe just as written, although the second time I made it, I halved the recipe.  I really enjoy the flavors and it is very filling.  I am trying to cut down on the amount of sodium per serving.  Sure seems like a lot of sodium.  But I really like this recipe.

I used a cut up tomato (since i didnt have any grape/cherry tomatoes) and i didnt have any feta cheese...but guess what it didnt need any...nor did it need the dressing.  As i was mixing it all together i sampled a few bites, and decided it tasted great without the dressing. (i added the spices though).  Would the dressing be good in it...Yes, im sure it would, would cheese be great in it (duh...who doesnt love cheese), but  if you're missing a few ingredients, give it a try anyways.  I totally devoured this dish!  :)

Changed it up a little - I used 2 2.5oz cans of pre sliced olives, used 4oz cubed mozzarella instead of feta, increased the tomato, excluded the red onion  and added sliced Italian chicken sausage. Made it more Itailian style then greek - family enjoyed it!!

This salad is awesome! I made a couple of changes, but I don't think they altered the flavor much. I did not have any grape tomatoes or other fresh tomatoes, so I used a can of diced tomatoes. It worked just fine. I also omitted the onions because my daughter won't eat them, & I don't care too much for raw onions. Other than that I made the recipe as stated, & I will definitely be making this again!

Added more seasonings - Greek seasoning, garlic salt, pepper. Increased feta cheese and used kalamata olives. Also only had 1 can of garbanzo, so added a can of Northern beans as well. Tasted great!

I made this salad as lunch for the week.  I really liked it, it has a good flavor and is filling. Because I made this ahead for my lunches next time I make this I'm going to leave the tomato's whole (so they don't get so mushy).  I didn't try this, but I think that a small chopped up hot banana pepper would be great in this.

I used Balsamic Vinaigrette, because I think it would taste off with Italian dressing. I added a 1/4 cup of fresh chopped basil. This is really good!

Not sure if I would like this so I halved the recipe, and it was delish! I'm not too big on chickpeas (but I know they're a healthy food), but I liked all of the other ingredients. Nice marinade here, and the lemon gives it a very fresh taste. When I tasted it after 4 hours, I felt it needed more salt, so I gave it a good sprinkling of sea salt. Thanks Kim, good recipe!

Great salad but enormous. About half way through I had to transfer the salad from my 10 cup bowl to a 6 qt. Dutch oven! As others have suggested, I used about 3 oz. of Feta cheese.

I made this tonight for the first time, and while I was confident I would like it given the ingredients, I wasn't sure about my meat loving boyfriend. He loved it!  Even had seconds. However, key to him liking the salad was the fact that I eliminated the onions and garlic. Honestly, I thought this was delicious and didn't need either of those ingredients. I did everything else just as the recipe calls for. I used Kens light Italian dressing. I imagine the type of dressing you use would change the flavor significantly. Also, you have to like garbanzo beans of course.   I think this will be great leftovers, and I was also thinking it would be really good as a lunch with pita bread.

I just made this recipe yesterday.  I loved the salad, but I'd love to hear from others as to what I could have added for more flavor in the dressing.  I felt that was a little bland.  I was thinking a couple of drops of Tabasco but I didn't want to ruin it.  Other than that, our company loved it also and the presentation is very nice.

I love that this recipe is so filling, delicious, and healthy! I omitted the olives due to personal preference, doubled the tomatoes and feta cheese, substituted greek dressing for italian, and added a splash of red wine vinegar for extra zing. Incredible! My husband loved it too:) It's also good with pepperchinis.

This is a fantastic healthier alternative to pasta salad - which we love to eat for lunch.  I made this today and served it over a bed of fresh spinach.  The only thing I did differently was add more feta to taste.  My husband and I loved it. Will definitely make again.

I wasn't too sure about the recipe calling for cucumbers but it was great. I used kalmata olives, that's what I had on hand, and scaled back since they have a strong flavor. I did add more feta.

I treated this first as a Greek salad WITH garbonzo beans:  I added 1/4 tsp. ground thyme, 1/4 tsp dry oregano.  My dressing was 1/4 c extra virgin olive oil and 2Tbsp red wine vinegar and juice of half large lemon.  Used kalamata olives instead of canned.  Yes, also added more feta!  Great luncheon or side dish.  I had it for dinner tonight with left-over ribs from yesterday and finished it off with a Pink Lady apple.  Man, I feel so healthy!

Great flavour.  My teenage son loves this salad.  Added 1/2 tsp of Greek spice to give it some added zip.

This was a-ok. I'm not complaining I just wish it had a little bit more of something. I'll definitely try some variations to this and give it another go.

This is a wonderful salad, great for carnivores and vegetarians! I do add some chopped green pepper and a tablespoon of greek seasoning. I also substitute Greek dressin for the Italian salad dressing. Yum!

Delicious.  I didn't have 2 cucumbers, so I put in some artichoke hearts, which someone else also suggested.  It was very good.

This is delicious!  I did as some of the other suggested, I reduced the olives and added more feta.  I used Newman's Own Light Italian Dressing.  It tastes better the day after!

Delicious! I have made this twice. If you use the Italian "fat free" dressing it does NOT taste the same as the regular- the fat free has a very fake taste. It is great to eat by itself or on top of a bed of lettuce. Thanks for this great recipe!

This is my new favorite salad. Anything with feta has me excited, but this is the perfect blend of beans, veggies, cheese and dressing. The olives make it the best! I made it exactly as written except that I used a Greek vinaigrette dressing as others recommended. Also, this salad kept very well. I made it on a Sunday morning and ate the last of it Wed night. It was only a tiny bit watery. This salad is going to be a staple in our summer cook outs!

This salad is very easy to make and tastes pretty good. It would be enhanced by some fresh herbs, such as oregano and/or basil. Some pita croutons would also be good, but would not keep well. Thanks!

This was great!  The only changes I made were 1/2 of a red sweet pepper (diced), and instead of the feta (which I didn't have) I substituted sun-dried tomato with feta dressing for the Italian dressing.  This was so good, especially since I'm trying to eat more health-consciously.  I also halved the recipe, which made plenty for our family of 3.

Loved this recipe!!!! I made it early for dinner later. Don't think it will last that long. I did add a tsp of oregano ( for 4 servings) to match the flavors of my other dishes. It was perfect. Will be making often.

This was easy, delicious and refreshing. I modified according to what I had on hand: Kalamata instead of black olives, light balsamic instead of Italian, omitted the lemon, kosher salt instead of garlic salt. I also scooped the seeds out of the cucumber. Albacore tuna tossed in is a good addition.

Very good with a few changes.  I used zucchini instead of cucumber because I didn't have any, but I'm sure cucumber is just as good.  I also used greek salad dressing rather than italian dressing and it was A.MAZ.ING!

This serves way more than 8 people! I took to a party of 30 people and still had left-over. I used about a 1/2 cup of chopped kalamata olives. Feta needs to be increased. I used a fat free Caesar dressing, because that is what I had. I soaked the red onion in ice water for about 1/2 hour to help mellow it. And I didn't bother with the garlic salt. Definitely add oregano and definitely make this up ahead of time to let the flavors develop.

This may be an unfair comment about a dish that plainly calls itself a bean salad, but I thought it had too many beans!  The flavors were good, though.  I probably won't make it again, but if I do, I'll double the tomatoes, add an extra cucumber, and use only one can of beans.  I added more feta cheese and definitely thought that was a good choice.  A note about the can of olives: in my store, the olives were weighed without factoring in the weight of the liquid.  The can I bought was the same size as the 15 ounce cans of beans, but the weight displayed on the can was only 6 ounces.
UPDATE: I made this again with an extra cucumber, only one can of beans, and extra tomatoes and feta cheese.  It got rave reviews from my family.  I like it much better with these changes.

I agree, very tasty and the different textures make every mouthful a treat! I didn't want to add salt so just whisked fresh garlic in with the dressing. Quick, easy and healthy!

I made this as a side for a BBQ this weekend. Loved it! I increased to 4-6 oz fresh feta packed in water, 2 English cucumbers (probably more than called for but I love cucumber)and pitted kalamata/greek olives. This would be a great option if you have a vegetarian in the group. I made it because I've OD'd on ribs, BBQ chick, hamburgers/hotdog, coleslaw, potato salad and wanted a lighter fare option. No one noticed I only had a small piece of meat, this salad and a couple other sides. I'm going to be making this a lot! Thanks!

This was good + easy to make. I used Kalamata olives (chopped into bits) and added more feta otherwise followed the recipe. I seeded the cuke to help cut down juices & keep a firmer texture. Next time I will not add the feta until I'm ready to serve because as I stirred the dressing in it got kind of milky/gooey and I like the firm crumbles. Even better if you chill 2-4 hours! Served it with warmed pita triangles on a Romaine leaf [which we rolled up and ate after finishing the salad!]

This salad was good however the lemon juice didn't go well with the italian dressing I chose.  Next time I'll omit the lemon juice.  I left out the onions due to preference, all in all it was a good salad.  I will be making this again!

This was an amazing salad!  I love garbanzo beans and always looking for new recipes.  I followed this recipe exactly how it was...next time I would omit the fresh garlic as it was TOO garlicky for me.

This is a great, healthy recipe. I did add more tomatoes. I think you need more just to balance the color in this salad. :-). My daughter actually loved this salad before I even put the dressing on it. Although many recommend using a lot more feta, I thought the one ounce was perfect. It didn't overpower the salad, but did give it a nice kick. I did use less dressing, as I don't like my salads swimming in dressing. Great recipe. Thnaks for sharing!!!

This was a very good salad, but it wasn't quite flavorful enough. I loved the combination of ingredients, but it didn't have quite enough "zip." I will probably make this again, but will tweak it to be more flavorful. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  This is different from your normal bean salad and it is a very filling salad.  I was worried the cucumbers would get soggy, but we are now on day 3 of eating this and it is still great!  Leftovers are great.

Good way to get lots of veggies and protein in!  Next time I will dress this with an olive oil, garlic, lemon vinagerette- I didn't care for the tangy-ness of the Italian dressing/lemon juice combo.  Have a piece of gum ready after you eat this, it's pretty strong!

Quick, easy and flavorful.   I seeded the cucumbers before before added to maintain crispness.  I also added some chopped colored peppers and increased the amount of feta cheese.

We simply loved this recipe. It was delicioius. We did add a little extra feta cheese, about 3 oz. It turned out wonderfully. We used a large cucumber, so we ended up quartering it and slicing them, but even then the pieces were too large, so we cut them in half, again. Then it was perfect.

Pretty good. I used 1/2 of an english cucumber and a sundried tomato dressing, otherwise followed the recipe. I thought the flavors were great together but would add more feta cheese next time. I'll make again with some modifications. The cucumbers were a little soggy the next day but still edible.

I followed the Helpful reviews and added more feta, thank goodness because I'm not sure I could have taken the salad without the extra cheese.  I omitted less than half the olives and half the cucumber. When cutting the cucumber, the recipe says, cut in half, then into slices.  Those peices seemed far too big in my opinion, so I quartered the cucumber and sliced and the peices were still too big!  If I make this again, I'd skin and seed the cucumber and slice/dice it into small peices that were equal to the size of the garbanzo bean. This wasn't my cup of tea, I brought it to a very small family function and only three people even attempted it because the rest could see the red onion and had already planned to avoid anything with onion.  I recieved compliments, but I'm not sure what *I* thought of it. I never give up so easily, so I'll probably try this again later, in a suitable occasion where I don't actually have to impress anyone.  I'll see what changes I can make to this recipe to make it perfect for my own kind of taste.

I actually make a very similar salad that always comes out delicious. In addition to what is here, I add red bell peppers and some fresh basil and spinach (because I had some on hand) and some dried oregano. I omitted the garlic because I take it for lunch and didn't want garlic breath. Also terrific with reduced fat feta. For dressing I used lemon juice, white vinegar, and a couple tablespoons of olive oil.

Amazingly good for such a simple recipe. I used the following recommendations from others:. english cucumber,  1  cup herbed feta, about 20 fresh kalamata olives,  a yellow pepper, and Paul Newman's Greek dressing. I highly recommend this recipe!

I'm not a fan of many of the things in this salad. However, I was in charge of a salad for a Greek-themed dinner.  I must say it was very good!  I added about 3 oz of feta cheese and sprinkled a bit more on top right before serving.  I also used the Greek Kalamata olives instead of canned, and I added a chopped yellow pepper for some more color.  I also used a Greek vinagrette-type dressing.  Everyone loved it.

So good. I made this several times. I hate onion so leave it out. Sometime I use kalamata  olives instead of black and Greek dressing instead of Italian.

Thank you for submitting the recipe. 

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly. We liked it, but it needed some extra oomph for our taste buds. 

Now I use the amount of veggies & garbanzo beans called for and add marinated artichoke hearts, kalamata olives (instead of black) and sun dried tomatoes. I use a bit more lemon and Greek salad dressing instead of  Italian. I don't use the garlic salt because there is enough salt in the other ingredients; I do up the garlic a bit. We eat this often. I just made it! 

As you can tell, the recipe lends itself to your favorite ingredients.

1/23/2020:  One more thing, be sure to really drain everything before combining. I usually keep the cucumbers (seeded) & tomatoes (Roma/seeded) on paper towels for about 1/2 hour. It's too watery for us otherwise.

I made it according to recipe except I did not use Italian dressing. I used olive oil and vinegar, small amount of lemon juice. It is a big hit with my family and friends.

Love this salad! I did change out kalmata olives for black olives and a Greek vinaigrette instead of Italian dressing. I added lots more feta because I love feta A LOT. I also only ended up using one cucumber which was plenty. I  plan on making it to bring small portions of to work for lunch and not adding the dressing, but rather the dressing to add at lunchtime.

I liked it, and I will make it again.  I had to use lime juice instead of lemon juice, so I also added cilantro too.  I should have used more red onion, but I went easy on it the first time.   I didn't have any Italian spices so I improvised with Kingsford brand garlic and herb seasoning.  I'm going to try to keep other bean salads in the refrigerator this summer just to stay off the processed foods. Middle Eastern Balela is also on this site, and it is very close to this except with the addition of black beans and the omission of cucumber.  This recipe definitely is a good base for addition of healthy ingredients, and not loaded with sugars.  Also, I made it without the tomatoes, and just a few drops of Tapatio hot sauce to get the vinegary taste, but not the heat; and, it was even better that way.

I doubled this recipe, and used 3 cucumbers, about 25 oz. of kalamata olives, and 3 oz. of feta. Instead of Italian dressing, I made a vinaigrette with fresh herbs (basil, rosemary, thyme). It was fresh and delicious!

This was delicious!  It was kind of grubby looking, though, maybe because of the dressing I used.  Rather than bottled Italian dressing I used Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing, also on this site; it is perfect!  As many have I made some changes related to what I had on hand: I added fresh dill and Italian flat leaved parsley.  I used green onions, rather than red, added chopped red and orange sweet peppers, Greek olives, cannellini beans and a sprinkle of sugar, about 1/2 tbsp.  I also used more tomatoes and English cucumber.  It was enthusiastically received and some asked for the recipe.  A definite keeper!

I've made this twice already just for myself. I just eat it all week long. I added red wine vinegar to it with less italian dressing and no tomatos. Also I use feta that is flavored with italian herbs already. My favorite healthy quick salad!

This is a great dish to bring to a party or to make for a potluck. It's gotten rave reviews whenever I've made it. The only major change that I make to the recipe is that I always make this the night before I intend to serve it. It needs to sit overnight if you really want the flavor to sink in and mix together.  This is a great, healthy salad that can be a side or a full meal!

This was so delicious. I followed the recipe exactly...no changes. But I think the quality of the ingredients plays an important part. Here are the ingredients I used  Kraft Viva Italian dressing, Goya Chick Peas (so much better than any other canned chick pea), Boars Head Feta cheese Crumbles, Lawrys Garlic Salt, English cucumbers, and “cherubs” tomatoes.

When you make this salad, pick the ingredients you like the best, it may be different than mine, but if you don’t have a preference, I wrote this review to give you suggestions.

Anyway it’s the first time my vegetarian husband loved garbanzo salad so much he asked if he could finish it!

I made this exactly as written. To those who rely on 5 star reviews to make cooking decisions, notice how many of those reviewers made changes instead of making it as directed. 

It's not that there isn't taste to this recipe. It's just that none of the flavors, either individually, or combined, are anything special.  It lacks any bright or distinctive flavor that would make you want to make it again.  

Were I to make it again, I'd rely less on the  garbanzo bean content, reduce them by half, and add, maybe, a half tsp of kosher salt to try and brighten things up..focus on the veg rather than the beans.

This is wonderful and forgiving, and I've been making this every week to have for a good breakfast every day with protein and fiber. I've had to do it differently some times just depending on what I have. I do 1 can of drained garbanzo and 1 can of drained black beans; I always seed the cucumber; oftentimes have used a can of drained petite diced tomatoes; will use green, red or white onions or a mix;  black olives are a MUST, but I only use about 15 large olives, quartered; I don't always have feta and have used co-jack or sharp cheddar in its place; I make homemade vinaigrette with evoo, vinegar, dijon, lemon juice, oregano, basil and pepper, just shaken together in a jar and poured over.
This is a filling, nutritious meal and I am so happy I found it! Thanks Kim Fusich!!

This salad is wonderful! I didn’t use quite the amount of lemon juice called for and I added maybe 2 teaspoons of olive oil as the Italian dressing I used tasted a little vinegary to me. I served it with crusty Tuscan bread and my husband had 2 servings! Thanks for sharing!??

Made a short suggested, but I had a sweet yellow onion instead of the red onion, so I soaked my chopped onion in ice water with 1/2 tsp of salt and 1 tsp sugar, then rinsed it 3 times. The salad was perfect with the grilled chicken. It was easy, and I'd make it again!

Second time making the salad.....it is an easy recipe and very delicious. I didn’t put on the garlic but did use the garlic salt. I love garlic but thought recipe would be too much with both clove garlic and garlic salt.

I used primal kitchen Greek salad dressing, more lemon juice and chopped fresh parsley.  It was delicious and very satisfying with no grains.  This will be a regular.

I really liked this but my vegetarian daughter surprisingly was not as impressed as I was.  I will make it again but will only use one can of garbanzos.  I used made a larger batch and used the entire carton of cherry tomatoes, 8 oz. Feta, added a small zucchini I needed to use up, and half a head of crunchy chopped romaine which was a good addition.   I also used a cup of good quality Greek dressing in place of the Italian.

Looks and sounds like a good and refreshing "salad".

I do have to say thought that the use of "Greek" in front of every recipe that has olives is very annoying.

This is NOT a "Greek"  salad as it's not a salad in the Greek lexicon of recipes.   This is a salad recipe that uses Mediterranean flavors, as the description states.  This salad should simply be called "Mediterranean flavor/style garbanzo salad.

There are WAY too many recipes on recipe sites that add "Greek" to the recipe name for no other reason than the recipe has olives, and brined white cheese that Greeks call "feta".    "Feta" is simply the name Greeks gave the brined white cheese that is made and enjoyed in much the  Mediterranean area. 

This recipe could as easily been named; "Italian, Moroccan, Turkish, Spanish, Albanian, garbanzo bean salad" as all of those countries use these very same ingredients and flavors.

If a recipe is not an actual traditional recipe of a nation, country, or region, then the recipe name should not include a particular countries name.

This has been one of my summer go-to salads for a couple years now! It’s great for potluck picnics, grilling at home, or a family picnic at the lake. My husband loves the combination of flavors. I always end up adding more tomatoes and cheese- typically the entire package of however it comes in the grocery store. My daughters both love olives - so some extras usually make their way in too! There’s never too much of this salad, it goes fast!

Good, refreshing salad. Next time I'll try to remember to buy the cucumbers... I wound up using some sweet peppers instead, and that worked well. I do recommend adding more feta, as others have noted. And I would also say to let the salad marinate for a bit before adding any additional seasoning - I found that the dressing I used, combined with the saltiness of the olives, was plenty.

I just made this, this evening.  Made it according to directions, except I didn't have black olives but did have a Mediterranean olive mix.  As per another suggestion, I added more feta cheese, and I made Pioneer Woman's Greek Dressing (with red wine vinegar) since I didn't have Italian Dressing on hand. The final results were exactly what I was looking for!  Delish!

Five stars for all the correct ingredients. 1 five ounce of black olives, chopped is perfect and I added one entire 4oz. Container of Feta Cheese.  I would suggest removing the seeds from the cucumbers as there is enough liquid from the salad dressing and the lemon. The salad tasted even better the next day. I will make this one day ahead when I make this again.
A keeper and Thank You for Sharing.

Very nice salad! I tried it with a lemon vinaigrette, added 1 tsp. Greek Oregano, more feta cheese & 1/2 a green pepper. Used real lemon as well and let it sit overnight. Deelicious!!!

I have made this more than 10 times. I never add onions or mushrooms. Personal taste. I do add a bit more feta because I love it. This can get very watery so cut out the seeds of the cucumber. It is a big hit and beat to make it the night before so it can sit.

Love this recipe! I tasted it before adding the Italian dressing and it was so good that I deleted that. Definitely increased the feta and I think its creaminess made it good enough sans dressing. What a yummy flavor combo. I will add to my summer cookout rotation as well. Makes a great side for the Greek chicken recipe I also made from this site.

I made this today. Easy and good. I substituted the cucumber with a half green-pepper and  utilized a seeded Roma tomato instead of using cherry tomatoes. My husband and daughter enjoyed it although my husband would have preferred it be ligthly salted as I did not have the  goat cheese.

I made this salad, but I changed the ingredients a bit. I skipped the onion and the tomatoes and I added red capsicum and cayenne pepper. As for the dressing, I used a simple vinaigrette, made with olive oil, apple cider vinegar and a teaspoon of mustard. Delicious :)  Oh, and I never follow the salad recipes when it comes to quantities.

While this recipe is great as is, I have modified it nearly every time I made it. Rather than 2 cans of garbanzo beans, I add 1 can of garbanzo and 1 large can of black beans. And 1 oz. of feta is nowhere near enough for me. I just put the entire 6-7 oz. container in. I've also made it with and without the black olives. I also add 3 cucumbers with the seeds removed and an entire small container of cherry tomatoes. I've made this many times and it's always a big hit!

As written,, it was a good salad.  I "Hellenicized" it a bit by adding capers (1 tbs), and replaced the Italian dressing (hey! This is a Greek salad after all!) with a mixture of white vinegar (1 tbs),  olive oil (2 tbs) and fresh oregano (or 1 tsp dried oregano).

Very good!  I've made with Greek dressing instead of Italian as well, great that way too.  Has become a summer staple.

Delish!  I put it on a bed of lettuce with some cooked chicken on top and made it a meal!  Hubby doesn't like olives, so I left them out when I tossed it, then added some kalamatas to my own portion.

Very good salad but I added celery, green and yellow pepper and fresh basil which gave it a little more flavor.

This is phenomenal! I did two things slightly different, I added marinated mushrooms and doubled the feta! And of course you must use Klamata olives!! Bravo! Can't wait to make again!

This salad is a great summer dish, or works well as a side dish. I do add more feta, because I like extra cheese. I also add chopped pepperoncini peppers. This salad keeps well, and the flavors improve with chilling and time.

I enjoy salads that maintain the taste of the ingredients--not overshadowed by dressing and this recipe does that.  Crunchy, full of flavor and better the second day!

Tasty.
Made as written except made my own dressing. Mixed the lemon juice with 3 tablespoons of olive oil, salt, pepper, the zest of the lemon (I never waste it), and some oregano. A nice side to bring to a BBQ or a quick lunch.

Hubby is on a health kick & this is his new favorite! I added some diced red pepper, chopped kale & fresh parsley, used much less salad dressing & omitted the olives. The recipe is a winner!

This is a wonderful summer salad. Easy to make, no greens to wilt and it keeps for days.  Great recipe just like it is.  I did add some dried mint to give it a little more of the mediterranean taste.  I also used Cotijah cheese instead of feta, because that's what I had on hand. I'll be making this again many times over!

This was delicious! I made very few changes. I diced the cucumber, instead of half slices. I added more feta (because I love it) and I used Greek Vinaigrette instead of Italian.  It's a perfect lunch salad add a grilled chicken breast and it would be a great summer dinner!

Made it exactly as the recipe said, minus the amount of olives as we are not big olive fans-- still included them for the health benefits.  Instant staple in my house. So delicious!

Great! A nice, healthy dish. The folks who complain about flavor may have used an Italian dressing that did not mesh with the rest of the recipe. There are a ton of dressings and balsamic vinaigrettes, I suggest trying different types. Regular tomatoes worked fine.

This is a great recipe, and healthy! I can eat this for lunch many days in a row. I like to use dried garbanzo beans, cooked prior and chilled, instead of canned ones, because they are a little better texture and flavor. I substitute for the Italian-style dressing with 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 1/2 tsp. dried oregano, plus fresh basil and a little fresh parsley. Kalamata olives are nice, instead of plain black ones, if you have them.

Easy to make and delicious. You really can't mess this recipe up. Add more or less of any of the ingredients and you are good! I added extra cheese and black olives. I might try to add corn next time.

This is a cool, crisp summer side dish, although my family wasn't crazy about the main ingredient (garbonzo bean).  If I make this again I will change the balance of beans to vegetables up a bit to suite my family's taste

Loved this recipe - forgot the garlic but it still came out great! One thing -- take the time to get some good pitted olives from a deli or Whole Foods. Canned olives have no taste...

I really like this recipe as is but sometimes I make some changes to fancy it up a bit. I saute red bell pepper and red onion and garlic in a little olive oil before adding to the salad. I double the feta and throw in a couple tablespoons of chopped parsley. I like Wishbone Italian dressing if I don't have homemande on hand. I also like to seed the cukes before adding.

Easy & tasty recipe.  I'd recommend a few things to really improve the quality.  Remove the seeds from the cucumbers, use Kalmata olives, increase Feta to 4 oz., add 1 cup of chopped fresh cilantro, add one finely chopped serrano or jalapeno pepper with seeds.

The olives and dressing  you select will have the biggest impact on the results.  I've made this over 30 times..  I use Ken's Northern Italian Lite which works much better than most of the other Italian dressings and only adds 45 calories per tablespoon.

I made this for a potluck and doubled the recipe. I didnt have enough black olives, so I added Kalamata Olives. I used zesty italian dressing instead of the regular and I received lots of compliments!

Superb!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except for substituting shallot for the red onion and skipping the garlic salt.  It was delicious served as a side dish over a bed of arugula and will be going into our binder of "family favorites."  Thanks for the recipe!

The only thing that I changed was to use an entire 3 oz pkg of fat free feta cheese and used fat free Italian dressing.  This salad is incredible!  I love it!!  We had it with grilled chicken breasts and fresh fruit.  It completes a delicious summer meal!

I think this is a great concept, but next time I'll dial down the dressing...It had way too much!  I also added artichokes, which was a delicious addition.  I will make again, but will scale back the servings (this makes a HUGE batch) and less dressing.

I loved the recipe. Rather than the Italian dressing, I used my homemade extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar with chopped garlic dressing. Next time I will try them with Greek olives.

Fantastic salad!  So fresh for the summertime.  I used Olive Oil based Greek dressing instead of the Italian.  I halved the quantities because only my hubby and I would eat it.  Had baked chicken w/Cavender's (Greek Seasoning), a greek salad, and some tzatziki sauce.  YUMMERS!

My next door neighbors and I barbeque every Wednesday nite after work..her husband brings whatever meat and does the cooking and I make the sides.  This was the best we ever tasted.  I added some green pepper.  It is the talk of the neighborhood..everybody wants some now.

This recipe was just incredible.  Simple and absolutely delicious.  I used it as a topper for a salad.

Ok so maybe im just not a fan of garbanzo beans or maybe its the combination of the veggies with the garbanzo beans. Im not sure but theres something about this salad that i wasnt fond of.I cut the recipe in half (just one can) and the salads still sittin in the fridge. I wont be making this again.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I did add extra feta as others suggested and a sprinkle of dried dill as well.  I used a Good Seasonings packet to make the Italian dressing caled for in the recipe and it turned out well.  It was good and I will make it again.  I ate it with toasted pita wedges as a light summer dinner.  Yum!

Well, when a recipe has almost every one of  your favorite ingredients (chickpeas, cukes, olives, etc.) how can it miss?  I'm eating my second bowl of this as we speak, and the flavors are near perfect.  My modifications were minor.  I used just 1 English Cucumber (they are very long!) and like others, I put in more Feta than it called for (probably closer to 3 or 4 ounces) and sprinkled a bit more on when I ate it, just to have it be nice and crumbly.    This is very light, refreshing and 'cool'  tasting and quite healthy.  Seems to me, you could easily make it a main dish by adding some chopped up rotisserie chicken.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was great.  Well, actually, I did not put the cucumbers in until just before I was going to serve it since I thought they may get soggy if I put them in when I mixed the dressing in almost 8 hours before I was ready to serve it. Served it on the 4th and it was a big hit! Many thanks to you Kim!!

Great dish, but I do love Greek!  I added more feta (my favorite cheese) and also used Ken's Greek dressing. Added oregano and some dried mint.  Excellent flavor.  Will make often.

This was a huge hit today at my Fathers Day celebration!  Omitted the onions & garlic, added chopped celery and used Good Season Garlic & Herb dressing - AWESOME!  No leftovers to be had.

Reduced the amount of olives, as others had suggested. Accidently only bought one cucumber- will definetly use 2 next time (seeded and chopped). Added a red bell pepper. Will add more feta and only one can of garbanzo beans next time. Used a Roasted Garlic Vinagrette. Made the night before so flavors really had time to mingle. Nice and refreshing. Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good.  Didn't need as much dressing as called for.  I liked trying it, but don't know that I would make it again.  I actually liked it straight away and felt it became a bit "soggy" 4 hours later.

This salad is the bomb! Excellent for you and full of flavor. I'm not going to say adjust this or that (I hate when people do that) because it is all up to personal taste anyway. Tweek as desired by you and your family. This will now be a staple in my house.  Thank you for a GREAT recipe!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was excellent!  I used a sun-dried tomato and feta dressing instead of Italian, added radishes (had a taste for them...I know weird), used all the black olives called for (YUM) and about 4oz feta. Super fresh and light enough to serve with spinach alfredo lasagna roll ups (from allrecipes also!), but filling enough for leftover lunches.  Delish; this will be a regular for me in the summer, and a great alternative to the same ole mixed greens salad (which does not keep well)!

Need to use kalamata olives versus the black olives.  Although I let everything marinate overnight, the Italian dressing that I used didn't add anything special.  I think an oil/vinegar mix with greek seasonings would have been better.  This wasn't memorable so I won't make this again.

I can't stop eating this stuff! I make it with English cucumbers (I use a veggie peeler to remove strips of skin), and with olives from my store's olive bar (canned olives don't have much flavor). It's definitely better if you refrigerate it for a couple of hours but eat it at room temperature. Thanks, Kim!

This was pretty good.  I used about 8oz of olives rather than 15oz and it was plenty.  I also used 4oz of feta rather than 1oz, and used low-fat Italian dressing.  It made for a good lunch all week!

I'm a huge fan of chick peas and loved this recipe. I added a few spoonfuls of
parmesan and used a zesty italian dressing. Was much tastier the next day and I had it for lunch all week!
