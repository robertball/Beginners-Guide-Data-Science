The dough is GREAT--not sticky when rolling and stays moist after baking.  I doubled the cinnamon butter filling and used a cream cheese glaze (Clone of a Cinnabon icing recipe from this site)

I had to add another approx cup of flour to this dough (to not be sticky) I am not sure why. But the results was still a very nice sweet dough with good flavor. I didn't read the recipe  thoroughly, so was surprised when it made SO MUCH dough. Just in case anyone trying this is also, like me, "not paying enough attention to the detail"... IT MAKES (4) LARGE Cakes. When I realized how much this made... I did not have 4 jelly roll sheet pans to do all at once, so I made this dough into cinnamon-raisin rolls, cream cheese squares and Peanut Butter filled rolls. The dough was very nice for all. I think my adding raisins to the cinnamon mixture added a nice texture & sweetness to the coffee cake round that I would has missed,if not added.

Recipe Group selection for February 18, 2012 -   Anytime I read a recipe that requires 2 pkgs. of yeast, I know that is way too much bread for me so I cut the recipe in half.  In addition, instead of making two coffee cakes exactly the same, I made one half of the dough into butterfly rolls and used chopped walnuts and raisins, and the other half I made exactly as requested using the chopped pecans.  I also brushed the coffee cake and rolls with an egg wash.  Please note that you will need significantly more flour than mentioned in the recipe.  Even for soft dough, you would need additional flour.  The result was a light, buttery, tender and yummy coffee cake.

I did it! I made something with yeast. Thank you recipe group for giving me the courage. After the initial 3 cups I added 2.5 cups more to make it pull away from the bowl. And of course more on kneading area as I went along. I would double the filling next time. I took the 4th log and made a mixture of brown sugar, butter, pecans, cinnamon and then sprinkled fresh frozen blueberries and rolled up into crescent shape. Just lovely. I also froze a baked one and froze a ring to rise and bake at another time.

Made this for Recipe Group...Oh, YUM! I 1/4'd the recipe to just make one coffee cake and that worked out fine. I also had to add more flour (about an extra cup) to get it not to be so sticky. I just threw all the ingredients into the bread machine and let it go. When the cycle was done, I proceeded w/ the recipe. This was a beautiful dough to work with once the extra flour was added. I liked that this was not too sweet and had the perfect amount of cinnamon, IMO. Oh, I also used finely chopped walnuts in place of the pecans b/c that's all I had. I would def make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made for Recipe Group. The recipe makes 4 rolls of dough. I halved it and made a coffeecake and cinnamon rolls. I rolled it out between 2 sheets of parchment paper. (I don't know who mentioned this, but it works great!) I had to add in at least another cup of flour to get the 'soft dough' out of the bowl without pouring it, and probably another cup or so to knead it before first rise. It worked out great and is divine!! Light, fluffy, cinnamony....thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe!  I made this with my 10 year old son and we had fun.  Reminds me of the Tea Rings my mother made for years.  I did have to add about 2 cups of flour to the recipe, but still very delicious.  We made five batches for Christmas gifts!

I'm a woefully inexperienced breadmaker (before today, I'd never made a yeast bread by myself, ever) so I didn't realize from reading the recipe just how much this makes. It makes a TON. I didn't realize I would have the equivalent of four of those cakes in the photos! Anyways, I'm glad I read the reviews because I also had to add an extra 2 cups of flour to get the dough to a point where it didn't stick *too* badly to the bowl, and even then it was still much stickier than what bread dough normally should be, according to my belated internet research on kneading dough. Turns out I didn't knead it with the proper technique, but it still came out beautifully - nice moist bread, good texture and density, and I thought the amount of cinnamon sugar filling was sufficient. I might up it 150% next time, but I don't know if I'd double it. We skipped the nuts, but otherwise followed the directions exactly, and I'm very happy with the results. Thanks for the recipe! I will have fun making this again; I'm interested in trying it with fresh or dried fruits rolled up inside.

I halved the recipe to make 2 cakes. As others have stated the dough is way too sticky, I added at least 1 cup of extra flour. Made dough in my bread machine, it was easy to roll out, I doubled the cinnamon in the filling and omitted the nuts, will triple cinnamon next time. Mine baked in 30 minutes on Silpat lined sheets, covered with foil after 10 minutes so they wouldn't brown too much.

Okay I guess. I thought this was a little on the dry side. I actually prefer individual sweet rolls. I will not make this again.

I halved the recipe to get 2 rolls of dough.  I baked one as per the recipe only adding 1/2 cup raisins because I was about 1/2 cup short on the pecans.  I froze the other roll and will use it at a later time.  I also had to add a bit more flour than the recipe calls for, but I expected that after reading the ingredients.  This is a lovely, light flavorful dough that would lend itself to many fillings.  Thanks for sharing, Tracy!

Made this for RECIPE GROUP, although tasty I had some sort of problem with my dough's second rising. First rising was fine, after filling and rolling the second rise was not so good. I may try this again since it tasted good, hopefully my next attempt will be "prettier".

Recipe group selection.  Tasty!  I had to add quite a bit more flour than called for, and I still think I should've added more.  I also added some cream cheese to the filling.  I halved the recipe and it still made a ton of bread.
