Outstanding casserole, Keith! I used frozen peas and carrots because I'm not crazy about canned veggies. A little garlic powder mixed in with the soups and WOW! My family loved it!

I sort of made this recipe.  I had a lot of leftovers from Thanksgiving, so I used leftover stuffing (I make it dry because my husband likes to put gravy on it).  I put in big chunks of turkey.  I didn't have cream of celery, so I used cream of mushroom instead and added a small can of mushrooms.  I had whipping cream leftover, so a put that in.  It's looking really good, now! I put in some frozen peas, freshly ground pepper, and some dehydrated onion.  I sprinkled a little more stuffing on before adding the french fried onions.  My family ate the whole 9x13 inch casserole in one sitting.  That's a first for us!

This is incredibly easy!  I have also tried it with sweet corn and cornbread stuffing for a change and that was yummy too!  I wouldn't call this gourmet, but it's a good throw-together dinner, great for a weeknight casserole.

I used fresh carrots but everything else was canned.  The fresh carrots gave it a home cooked taste.  I also used herb stuffing (pre-packaged).  It complimented the already great recipe!  Way to go on this one.  Five stars *****

I too used leftovers from a chicken I had made. I also used the rest of my gravy and dumped in all of the vegies we had from the night before. My family loves this kind of meal. Not only tasty, but a lot quicker then heating up all of the leftovers separately. Good job Keith!

It looks really "sloppy" but it was really very hearty and good.  A nice way to combine family favorites (chicken, stuffing & veggies...all in one dish).  I didn't change a thing and all-in-all, it was an easy recipe to prepare and cook! Thanks Keith!

Great casserole, and very versatile.  I make this about once a month and love it because I can just toss in whatever veggies I have on hand.  Yummy tasting, and it smells so good in the oven!

Lovely dish! Very hearty and filling as well as very tasty! It's a meal in one dish! Really convenient to make ahead and refrigerate until needed. I added sliced water chesnuts for a crunch and mushroom pieces. This was a hit with my family. I also made up a second one to take to some friends who had a death in the family. They loved it too. This gives a nice twist to the regular "stuffing with chicken" dishes. The gravy and veggies add so much flavor! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This was pretty good, not the best chicken casserole I have had, but we liked it.  It was a nice variation of a chicken pot pie, and I love the French onions on top!!!  Yum!

This recipe was just okay.. I only chose it to use up leftover chicken I had made the previous night. I also only used one can of crm of chx soup, not two- and it was plenty creamy. I sprinkled curry over the chix for some flavor. My 3 kids (2,7 & 9) ate a whole plate full, so a I have to give it a decent review.  Thanks for the super easy post!

This wasn't awesome, but it was a pretty good, comfort-food kind of dish.
I made it almost exactly as written, using Stove Top "savory herbs" stuffing. My amounts of chicken were slightly less, and carrots slightly more (2 x 8.25 oz. cans), than the recipe specified.
I noted that even a baking time of 20 minutes didn't suffice to heat the dish properly, so the "until heated through" definitely applied in my case.
This was kind of like chicken-pot-pie filling on a bed of stuffing. Thank goodness the stuffing was pretty savory, otherwise the dish would've been a bit bland; in fact, I thought the peas and carrots could've used some kind of seasoning. But this was definitely worth making, and I enjoyed it for three dinners in a row.

This is a family favorite.  I did change it up a bit to reflect my own personal tastes.  Instead of the peas and carrots, I used the frozen broccoli, cauliflower, carrot mix in the freezer aisle.  I also added cheese to it before the french fried onions.  My husband hates casseroles in general, but he'll eat this!

This recipe was FANTASTIC!!!  I prepared exactly as the recipe said.  To cook my chicken tenders I sauted them in a little bit of oil with Lawrys seasoned salt and fresh cracked black pepper. My husband loved it.  He said it tasted like a "very good version of a pot pie".  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this almost exactly as written. Except I use chicken flavored stuffing mix and I used some leftover garlicky-spiced chicken breasts I had. I think the garlic taste helped but don’t expect gourmet miracles. This is wholesome, easy family fare using ordinary canned and boxed goods. Inexpensive too except for the French fried onion rings being the most expensive ingredient. But don’t leave them out or try to substitute. I always contend that onion rings are the King of casserole toppings. This dish needs the King!

We liked the contrast of the crunchy topping, the chicken-veg filling and the soft stuffing on the bottom. I used fresh carrots and frozen peas instead of canned and used 3 boneless chicken breasts, cut-up and sautéed in a little oil, instead of chicken tenders. I deglazed the pan afterwards with a little white wine and water, and used that liquid to cook the carrots and to mix with the condensed soup. This probably added about 1/3 cup liquid to the recipe (I was worried about using the condensed soups whole, without thinning them) Our only complaint -- the casserole was slightly salty. Next time I won't season the chicken pieces when I cook them, and I'll use low-sodium condensed soups. We definitely will try this again.

Yesssssss this was super easy, kid approved, and DELICIOUS! The only change I made was adding a can of mixed veggies instead of peas and carrots because that's what I had on hand. Nice work Keith!

I made this for my family.  It lacked flavor.  We found it needed to be cooked longer than what the recipe stated.  If I made this again, I think I would add some seasonings to this, maybe poultry seasoning, salt and pepper...etc.

I made this tonight and my husband told me to add it to my favorite recipes and to make it often. To be honest he loved it more than I did, to me it was ok it didn't have the wow factor, but hey its not that difficult to make and if it pleased the hubby I will make it often. I think it needs maybe some small apple chunks added to the stuffing or the chicken mixture that might round out the flavor.  I did however saute a small onion and  chopped carrots and one clove garlic in a bit of olive oil and added to the soups (lowfat) and chicken along with some green beans, no peas and no french onion. This might be a perfect dish to freeze.

This was AWESOME!  My husband HATES chicken and asked for this again!!!  I did modify it a tiny bit.  I added half an onion (diced) and 2 garlic cloves (diced) and substituted cream of mushroom for the cream of celery.  Thank you so much for this fantastic recipe!  I think it's become a family favorite!

With a few changes this was a winner.  I saute'd 1/2 sweet onion and 1 stalk of celery and added to the stuffing after it was cooked.  I used fresh asparagus, cut in 1" pieces instead of the canned peas (yuck!). I distributed the pieces over the stuffing in the dish.  Instead of canned carrots, I used canned baby corn on the cob, but won't use them again. I used 16oz of leftover rotisserie chicken, cubed.  And, I seasoned the soup mixture with pepper.  The asparagus came out al dente, adding a nice texture to an otherwise "mushy" dish.  We'll definitely have this again!
