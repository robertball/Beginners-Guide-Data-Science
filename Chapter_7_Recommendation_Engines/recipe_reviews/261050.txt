Great recipe - I was a little hesitant since they are mixed for so long but the dough was great. The pre-bake rise is a genius step - these raised really high!

Here's what made this a keeper recipe for us: #1 These biscuits have top that is light and crispy to bite into. #2 The flavor Is good and balanced with great and not overpowering buttery deliciousness. #3 The crispy top. #4 They are tall but dense. #5 Did we mention the crispy top? Give these a try.... you might want to make them a little shorter to ensure they are done in the middle.... (We went too tall and just took the tops off and kept ) but try them and prepared be impressed.

Great recipe. I placed the biscuits together on a baking sheet because I didn't have a 9" x 9" pan. They came out great!
