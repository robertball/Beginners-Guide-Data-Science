Pam, if you watch his video on this recipe it shows exactly how he does it and takes the mystery of the butter away.  We plan on making this with the added bonus of watching his video first.

This is a marvelous recipe. It was so very delicious that I have made 3 in 2 weeks.

Being adventurous, it sounded kind of like a pecan sticky bun which I adore, so I included whole pecans just before the carmelized apples were to go into the oven. Then I topped it with some cinnamen and topped it with the crust.

It was appreciated by all.

I used medium sliced apples and packed them closer together. Also
used shredded almonds and 1 tsp cinnamon.  Being very naughty I used
store bought puff pastry.  It was fantastic!

First time came out great.  Second time I cooked too long on the stove top and it carmelized too much (almost burnt) and turned too hard.  Then it wouldn't come out of the pan.  Thank goodness the first time was served to guests and not the second time.  Be careful how long you cook on stove top.  The entire pan does not have to have the deep caramel color (or it will burn).

Excellent. After watching the video I did some research on the tarte, learned it was originally made with puff pastry, which I happened to have on hand, so that's what I used. I made it with Honey Crisp apples and, as per other reviewers, I added cinnamon and also a dash of ground cloves.
The tarte came out of the pan perfectly, although I have to say there was more moisture in my tarte than in Chef John's, which probably helped.  Delicious, oh so easy.  I'm making it again for Thanksgiving.  It's really nice to have such a great looking dessert that one can put together so quickly and easily.

Very tasty. Didn't have a skillet I can put in the over, so I cooked on the fire in a non stick frying pan and the transferred to a pe dish. my dish is 8inch and hence I used only 2 apples, 1/3 cup sugar and 70g butter. Came out extremely tasty. Needs icecream/custard.

Edit : 16.12.17 Made it my Le Crueset frying pan. Followed the recipe exactly, except sprinkled a generous pinch of cinnamon after the caramelisation was done, before putting the pastry on top. Extremely delicious!

I made this recipe exactly as written (including the suggested pastry) after watching the video.  I think that anyone making this for the first time should view the video before beginning - it shows a lot that the recipe can't explain.  Everything turned out very well and I was pleased.  My rating is based more on personal preference, rather than how successfully it turned out.  I gave a "4" because I found the Granny Smith apples a bit tart for my liking and craved a bit of cinnamon to add depth to the flavour.  I will definitely make this again (SO easy!) and just change to variety of apple (Gala, maybe?) and add a bit of cinnamon.  Thanks, Chef John!

My first attempt at preparing Chef John's apple tart tatin was a success!  I found Chef John's instructions on his video very easy to follow.  Made it for my son's "birthday cake" and everyone LOVED it.  Just returned from France where I had apple tart tatin three times.  This recipe was the BEST of them all!  Won't hesitate to make it again!  Try it - you'll love it!

I loved the simplicity of the recipe and it tasted amazing. Take the 5 mins and watch the video...it really does help understand the instructions. I made minor changes.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and I used Gala apples because that's what I had on hand.  I cheated and used a Pillsbury pie crust and it did not disappoint. Before I put it in the oven, I sprinkled cinnamon over the apples.  I think that was an important addition.  When I flipped it, it looked picture perfect...just like Chef John's.  When I make it again, I will double the apples. Thank you Chef John!

I have made this tarte several times and always with good results. I have a pretty solid pie crust, so have not made Chef John's. 

Two things I would note: Be sure to make sure the applies are really snug when placing in skillet; and do not get impatient while cooking. You want that lovely caramel to brown!  It makes a huge difference in your end result.

I was looking for alot more from this recipe. Difficulties started with the clarity of the directions. I wasn't sure whether this called for melted butter or not in step two. The directions state to coat bottom of pan with butter, which seems to mean in order to coat, it needs to be melted however then, when placed on stove in step 4, it calls for cooking until butter melts. Which is it? 
When I went to flip the tarte in was stuck to the bottom of the pan.
I had visions of a beautiful tarte and instead it turned into a mess.
I ended up using a spatula to get it out and there was no presentation to it at all.
To top it all off, it was bland. This needs some cinnamon and nutmeg.
Will not be making again. 
Sorry Chef John. I am usually a big fan.

I used a sheet of puff pastry (the kind that's pre-rolled) and just laid it on top of the cooked apples. Couldn't be easier!

Also added a tsp of vanilla and a tsp of cognac to the apples as they were cooking, and a splash of cognac to the whipped cream to serve it with...very rich!

An excellent recipe. I made 4 lots of pastry before starting this and saved 3 to the freezer. As I have an apple peeler / slicer I decided to divide up the apples slightly differently but caremalosed them is the same way with the addition of a sprinkling of cinnamon (a favorite here in bolivia. It is very necessary to remove the tart from the cast iron skillet BEFORE it cools otherwise it is a devil to remove. All in all a great recipie which is a family favorite.

Followed the video directions...I softened the butter in the microwave slightly so it spread easily. I also Pam'ed the skillet before adding the butter and had no trouble with sticking. Next time I might add a sprinkle of cinnamon before putting on the crust. Fabulous! I will use this for an upcoming French country dinner for friends.

GOOD EASY It is easy and does have just a pudding feel, but left for a day and it is great. I gave a 5 because simple doesn't mean less points for what 
it is, it is GREAT

So, so tasty and smelled AWESOME cooking!  I used the attached recipe for pie crust and that was also excellent. I highly recommend viewing the video for both.

Had a few hours notice to ‘bring a dessert’ to a friend dinner party.  Made one, then found out more people were coming!  Made another and served the both.  Added a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top of each piece.  It really came out well and everyone raved about it.  Easy to make, but you will have apples sticking to the pan - yes, even in a ceramic coated pan.  Had to scrape off and ‘redistribute’!  But all in all it tasted great and took no time to make....

I was doubtful all along. I kept the skin on, cut the apples in 12ths rather than quarters, added some cinnamon and vanilla to the butter and sugar. Turned out great.

It is delicious!  I made it for my sixth grade International Food Day ( I had Monaco).  I followed the video which was very helpful and humorous, too.  Today, I made it again for an Easter brunch.  Because I used a premade pie crust which is only 10" across, I rolled it out a little.  Thank you, Chef John!

Very easy to make, I used a cast iron skillit that was a little smaller than the directions mentioned. I definetly suggest watching the video first as it answers most questions. All my apples came out but I’m sure it was beginners luck!

I mistakenly  cut the apples into thick slices but it still turned out fabulous. Tricky to flip with my weak wrist and a heavy pan but worth it  as a great treat that was quick to make. 90% of mine came out on the platter, so left just a bit to remove easily with a spatula to the platter. So not perfect in appearance but who could tell with the ice cream on it, all it heard was yum, amazing etc...

I haven't made this yet as I just learned what a Tarte Tatin is.....including its historical origin at the Hotel Tatin in France.  I really enjoyed Chef John's presentation though. Now I'm off in search of the recipe for a tarte tatin made with maple syrup, bacon, onions and a pastry puff shared by a Canadian friend...  YUM. Thank you.

P.S. It's very helpful to watch the video first.

I used 2 granny smith  apples and 4 small southern peaches and Trader Joe's ( delicious and buttery) frozen crust. 
I used my stainless steel frying pan and am wondering how  a cast iron skillet might work?
I will definitely make this recipe all summer and might vary the fruit components.

I have never made a pie with the exception of a chess or chocolate pie and I have never even HAD French food, much less made something! lol This was incredibly easy and SOOO good! I was not patient enough and flipped it probably before I should, but it was just more runny.... and then I cut it before it completely cooled (hey, I was excited)! It was awesome! I can't get over how easy it was and Chef John's video was so easy to follow and very entertaining!

Video a must watch. Cut the apples into eighths to fill pan. Next time would use more apples and cut into quarters as directed. Used a pâte brisé for crust which browned after about 12 mins. Deliciously sweet!

I have made this so many times and it always comes out wonderfully.  It's so easy to make. I added one more apple and sometimes 2 since the apples shrink a lot. I use store bought pie crust for when I am in a pinch. Delicious!!!

I made this just the recipe indicated. It was delicious.  The one thing I liked the most is the absence of cinnamon and nutmeg.  All American recipes for apple desserts include  one or both. This really took me back to my days in France. I will definitely make this again!

This was so delicious! I followed the instructions in the video exactly. The pie crust recipe is perfection (not sure if it matters to anyone other than me, but I used White Lily AP flour). 

As for ingredients, I used apples I had on hand: 1 Granny Smith and 2 Gala (placing the Grannys every third slice). I also added a tiny bit of Vietnamese cinnamon, a tiny bit of nutmeg, and a pinch of fine sea salt to the apples while they were softening. (Tiny bit = less than a pinch) 

My family declared this the best pie they've ever had!

Great and simple recipe.  Had to make it a few times in Austria in a wok to have an oven-proof handle, and so the wok is deeper than an omelet pan.  However, I just cut the butter into small pieces and put some on the bottom with the sugar and some on top of the apples.  The sugar and butter melt quickly and so combine and mix quickly.  I found that coating the pan as in Chef John's video was difficult for me!

I used four apples, cut the apples a little more, added blackberries, and slightly sprinkled the top with cinnamon. I  had a graham cracker crust, but it broke up instantly, so I crumbled it and put it in the oven as is. After it baked, I flipped it back into the pie pan. It was delicious! I will find a pastry pie crust next time or learn how to make one, but no complaints on my first go at tartin!

This was very easy and tasty, I added a 1/4 tsp each of cinnamon, cardamom and pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp vanilla to the butter/sugar mixture before adding the apples. I used 6 apples as 3 were quite small. I halved the sugar and it was perfect. I let it cool too long in the pan, so mine was very pretty looking, next time will set timer to flip after 5 minutes.

So easy when you watch the video and the ingredients are so basic.  I was able to use up some apples in the frig and one pie crust that I had in freezer!  I cooked in my iron fry pan and OMG what flavors that brought into it.  Now going to brag on FB to all my cooking friends!

Tasty and easy to make.  I didn't have white sugar, but brown sugar.  I used store bought pastry and it worked out nicely.  Next time I'll try with the white sugar, which I hope will be tastier caramelized that the brown.

Not an easy thing to make. Ranked this a 2 mostly because it isn't to get the pie to turn out. If you want that nice ruffle edge. I may have cooked longer than I should've in the skillet because I didn't have much "sauce". It tasted fine, but my preference would be to add cinnamon & double the sauce.  Think we'll just stick with the regular apple pie even though this is easier by just quartering the apples instead of slicing.
