I used a stick of butter instead of oil and added a cup of chocolate chips. I then added m&ms on top of half of the cookies  and rolos on top of the other half. I baked for 11 minutes at 350. They were so chewy good.My family could not stop eating them. I will make them a Christmas tradition.

This recipe was fast, easy, and attractive, and the cookies were popular with our youth group!I used a small cookie scoop and got 36 2 1/2" diameter cookies.  I didn't dust them with powdered sugar, just topped them with Hershey Hugs. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that it is a little overly sweet to me, and I have a sweet tooth. It's possible a different brand of brownie mix might tone that down a little, but I'm not sure? Be sure to transfer the cookies to a plate before gently topping with the Kisses; they'll still be warm enough that it's easy to push through the bottom of the cookie if they're still on the cooling rack.

I left the powdered sugar off, since these are sweet enough without it. Wonderful cookies! I've made them 3 times now, and always get people coming back for more!

This is the basic recipe on the Duncan Hines brownie box...a great cookie. I made the basic recipe but added 3/4 cup walnuts, 3/4 cup craisins and 1/2 cup chocolate chips and baked 11-12 minutes. I omitted the powdered sugar and kisses. Too messy when brought to a church event. I also used a small ice cream scoop rather than roll into balls...much faster. This makes such a rich decadent cookie and

I agree these cookies are way too sweet.  I used all but 1/4 cup of Pillsbury Chocolate Fudge brownie mix, added 1/4 cup flour, 2T sifted Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa, 6 T melted butter in place of oil, 1 extra large egg, and 3 T water.  It mixed up easily.  I added 3/4 walnut pieces & 2/3 cup peanut butter chips.  Using a small ice cream scoop to make 24 equal size cookies. They are very tasty but too sweet. I'll compare box sides for salt/sugar content of the next brownie mix I buy to make these.

I used a bulk brownie mix so had to add a bit of flour to make sure the batter didn’t spread. And I used Lava Cake kisses. Cookies came out a little flat but very sweet and delicious! I’ll def make again.

Maybe I missed something but the dough is incredibly difficult to work with as prepared.  had to add flour for thicker consistency just so I could tray them up. I won't bother making these again.

I made this with a Betty Crocker fudge brownie. I topped with candy cane kisses. Super easy and yummy. The candy cane kisses make them less sweet I think. Another reviewer mentioned putting the kisses in the cookie on a flat surface- I agree with that, depending on your cooling rack the kisses will push through the cookie. Yum!

I used the red and white stripe kisses. The minty flavor of the kiss with the chocolate brownie was good. However, the overall cookie was much too sweet and rich. Maybe Hershey's will make a mini kiss at some point!

Everyone loved these! I do not use the confectioners sugar or Hershey's kiss. Sometimes I add walnuts and also I add melted butter instead of oil.

These were so easy, I made them for my Super Bowl party and they were all gone I didn't even get to taste one, so my 5-star rating is based on the assumption that everyone else liked them ;-)

These are the best and easiest cookies I have ever made. They are chewy and crisp at the same time. I have made them about 5 times since I found this recipe. I will never eat brownies as brownies again. Delish!

I did not bother with the extra candy on top as I thought it would be too sweet. I used Ghirardelli's dark chocolate brownie mix and the sweetness level was just right - not too sweet at all. Wonderful recipe and a good chocolate quick fix. Thank you for sharing.
