I love this recipe...although I've made a few slight changes to it.  I use spiral pasta (tri-colored if available) and add 8 oz. feta cheese.  It's best to get the block kind of feta and break it up into big chunks b/c when you mix the whole salad, it'll break up the feta.  Already crumbled feta breaks down too much.  Also, try olive oil instead of veggie oil and 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar instead of lemon juice or half the lemon juice and a little red wine vinegar.  I sometimes sprinkle garlic salt instead of regular and a little oregano.

Very nice salad, however I did add more seasonings than called for. To make it a little more Greek, I also added feta cheese. Thanks!

Wonderful and delicious!  I doubled the recipe for our 4th of July party and used "Absolutely Fabulous Greek Salad Dressing" from this site as dressing.  I did add a cup of crumbled feta cheese, some sliced pepperoni, and about 2 cups brocoli florets blanched a few minutes.  Will add to my summer salad list!

I found this salad very bland.  I even added feta and some oregano but still I found it rather tasteless.  I would not make this again.

I made this salad for a potluck.  Everyone was very impressed, although it was probably the easiest thing to make.  I also substituted olive oil and added a little bit of fresh garlic.  I love this recipe!

This was nice but nothing that wowed me. I liked the advice of adding a splash of red wine vinegar, which added a bit of sweet and I also added a dash of Italian seasonings and also some crumbled feta. I think grilled chicken might make a nice addition but I can't say that I'd make this again to try it. It just wasn't one of my favorites.

I really like this recipe for cookouts or pot lucks because it is pretty simple and most people will like it whether they are fond of greek salads generally.  I add feta cheese and some balsamic vinegar and fresh garlic (I left out the peppers because I just don't like them!) and I tihnk it's really good!

This was super! Made this for Independence Day and sub'd the dressing with the Absolutely Fabulous Greek Dressing as did the last reviewer. Also added small broc pieces, carrot slices and feta cheese to the other ingredients. Very tasty! Will definitely be making this one again.

it's summer and I am on a greek salad craze .. too hot to have the oven on all the time and greek salad goes with any kind of meat ... THIS salad is knock your socks off !! ... I made a *huge* bowl of this with our dinner, expecting to have leftovers for lunches, ect. .. and we ate it *all* .. I went back for thirds, and everyone else did, too .. 


I followed the recipe as stated, but for the sauce I used Olive Oil (healthier) and I didn't use the whole 1/4 c. I just measured it out and when the salad was done I drizzled it on bit by bit... I like red wine vinegar in my greek salad so I added that .. I just drizzled it on (1tsp?) and lots of lemon juice (1 or 2 tsp). and I love feta...lots of feta!  great summer salad

I love pasta salads and this one was pretty good.  I added more garlic and feta cheese and also added a few splashes of red wine vinegar because the salad was a little dry the next day.  Very good!

I made this using WHOLE WHEAT pasta and, um, it was pretty tasteless - DESPITE the fact that I used olive oil instead of veg oil, Kalamata Olives instead of black, and added extra lemon juice. SOOOO, I kept reading the reviews and someone had added Balsamic Vinegar - BINGO!!!! THAT IS THE MISSING INGREDIENT - yummy now with the bite of the vinegar!

A keeper.  Was very popular with guests, even someone who didn't usually eat pasta salads, had two helpings!!  I did what some other suggested and added some crumbled feta cheese.  Make sure you use a good fruity olive oil - makes the world of difference.

Very easy to make and keeps well. I actually liked it better the second day. I did modify it slightly, though - instead of vegetable oil, I did half olive oil and half balsamic salad dressing. It gave an extra bit of flavor and complemented the spicy/sour tastes of the other ingredients. Will definitely make this again.

tasted blan...however if you add more of all the "dressing" and I also added the red wine vinegar. I think I about doubled the garlic salt, added about 1/2 tsp of pepper, 1/2 tsp of basil and a 1T of oil (i used olive oil). My family loved it. We are taking it on our family camping trip tomorrow.

I made this very close to the recipe, the only difference was that I left out the olives.  Oh and I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I thought the flavor was a bit bland, I let it sit a while before tasting to let the flavors blend too. I did end up adding Italian dressing to spruce it up and with that I give it 4 stars.

Great recipe base.I did double all ingredients except the pasta. I used olive oil and kalamata olives in place of vegetable oil and black olives - if using kalamata olives be careful about adding more salt. Kalamat olive are much more salty than black olives. I also added some Greek oregano,red wine vinegar and halved cherry tomatoes.I broiled chicken breasts that had marinated in Greek dressing and sliced them to add to this salad. This salad was great and of course, even better the next day. Thanks Sara!

This was a very good dressing. I made the Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing instead of the dressing in this recipe. Served at my daughter's graduation party. Everyone loved it and the adults in attendance wanted the recipe. I also added Feta cheese.

I make this pasta salad every time we have a large party (which is often) or a potluck.  It is a welcome change to pasta salad, and it is usually completely gone by the end of the evening.  I also use olive oil, fresh minced garlic and dried oregano.  Then sprinkle the whole thing with feta cheese.  Always a winner!

I made this recipe on 3 separate occasions. The first time I made this Greek pasta salad, I found myself adding more and more vinegar. Now I add 1/4 cup of vinegar ( I never have lemon on hand and if I do 1 teaspoon is not nearly enough). The Greek pastas I love has that big tangy flavor and that's what I was looking for. Also, I substitute olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Instead of 2 tomatoes, use cherry tomatoes! Go buck on the spices, don't be shy to shower the pasta salad with garlic powder, oregano or dried basil! AND DONT FORGET TO ADD FETA CHEESE!! THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST! Beautiful for any event, whether it be a BBQ or work party.

This recipe was rated a 3/5 because its a good starter recipe, you just need to build on it to suit your personal tastes.

Absolutely delicious.  I suggest tripling the spices and using more lemon juice.  This is a very versatile recipe--I added feta cheese, shredded chicken, and a bag of frozen veggies.  I will try adding shrimp next time!

I really liked this -- and my kids liked it too.  I used tri color rotini and added chunks of feta.  It is very light tasting and would certainly suit a big BBQ or potluck event.  Will definately make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great fast and easy recipe. I added the Feta, two extra tomatos and also a little bit of Bernsteins Garlic/Italian dressing with a bit of garlic powder for that needed kick. Still good the way it is, I just wanted it sharper and I love tomatos!!

Loved this! I combined this recipe with the Greek Chicken Pasta recipe also on this site. I left out the cucumber since I was serving the dish hot and didn't think that they would hold up or taste right. I also added chopped artichoke hearts... boyfriend and everyone at work raved over it! Fantastic!

This is a nice pasta salad but it tasted a little bit bland to me so I had to modify it a little bit to suit my taste: extra lemon juice, a little more salt, some sliced pepperoncini and some garlic, tomato Feta cheese.

I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added garlic/onion salt instead of just plain garlic salt.  My mother, who is extremely picky, wowed over this.  It's a light, uncomplicated recipe...will most definitely make this again.  May add feta cheese next time.

Well, I doctored the dressing quite a bit, using red wine vinegar instead of lemon juice, and adding oregano and some mustard. It turned out pretty good. I would just like to say that this salad will feed way more than eight people. I just made it, and I have a huge bowlful. I'm taking it to work tomorrow for food day, but I'm keeping some out because I don't even think they will eat it all.

In my books, a Greek salad must contain feta, even if it's a small amount. Will not make again.

Delicious paired with grilled salmon. I did use a half tablespoon of fresh lemon juice with a half tablespoon of white wine vinegar in the dressing. I also used high quality olive oil. Plus a teaspoon of Italian seasoning. I included an 8 oz. container of crumbled feta as well.  I also only used 12 oz. of penne because that is what I had in the pantry. I wondered if the dressing would be enough but it was plenty. I might have made a bit more and increased the veggies if I had used a 16 oz. package of pasta. Delicious!

I thought this was a very good salad, with some changes to the dressing. Personally I omitted the olives, not an olive fan. I used rotini pasta (14.5oz box) instead of the penne and used a small Walla Walla onion. The changes I made to the dressing was to add 1/3 cup seasoned rice vinegar, 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice, a little over 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp crushed garlic, 1 1/2 tsp sweet basil and some generous shakes of parsley. I would highly recommend letting it marinate overnight before eating it to allow the flavors to blend better (I made it last night and it tasted way better this afternoon). I also added a little crumbled goat cheese to my bowl and a few more shakes of rice vinegar after serving myself. Might need to up the vinegar a little more next time. With all those changes it was excellent.

Good...but needed some help.  I halved the recipe, but once I tasted it, I decided to add an extra 1/8c olive oil, 1/8c red wine vinegar, fresh ground black pepepr and 4 cloves of crushed garlic.  That was the extra kick it needed.  It was fantastic with those additions.

I thought it was bland.  I replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil, added chopped onion and feta cheese.  It was still a little bland so a couple of shakes of Greek salad dressing did the trick.

A couple notes- The recipe says it serves 8, however if you are cooking for a large gathering with other food items (burgers and the like), it actually serves about 16-20 people. I doubled the recipe for about 30 people, and still had plenty left over. When making the dressing, add the dry ingredients (salt & pepper) directly to the pasta salad. Because they were heavy, they fell to the bottom of the vinaigrette mixture and could not be poured out completely into the pasta. I did what another suggested and used olive oil and red wine vinegar, and also added Feta cheese. I also used fresh basil. Next time I will try scallions instead of sweet onions. Overall, it got good reviews. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks!
