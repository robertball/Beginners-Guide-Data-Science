What a grand idea! This recipe resolves those "what to do with all these bits of veggies in the fridge" issues. It is also an ingenious solution to a quick and tasty lunch when you are tired of eating meat. I used 2 cups of homemade boiled chickpeas instead of canned. I made this on whole grain GF bread and served it also inside an avocado for a different angle and it was delicious with the creamy avocado. I added some hot peppers for a bit of punch and it went well with all the other ingredients. I don't have Italian dressing so I just used some Italian seasoning and some olive oil. It was light and refreshing. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!!

First, this makes so much! Unless you want to be eating this for weeks cut the recipe in half. Second, this is so incredibly dry. I was hoping for a creamier vegetable salad sandwich spread. I had to add a bit of mayonnaise and it's still dry and bland. We'll do what we can individually to spice up our sandwiches so we can eat all of this! I really wanted to be impressed with this and it just didn't happen.
