I've made this three times now, so my revised review is:  very tasty rye bread, but I increased rye flour to 2 cups and decreased bread flour to 1-2/3 cups.  this enhanced the rye flavor. The loaf is pretty small but has a nice texture inside and out.

After many Rye Bread recipe failures this one came through for me with flying colors.  I made some subtle changes however. I increased the amount of water to 1-1/4 cups, the amount of oil to 1/4 cup, and the amount of caraway seeds to 3 teaspoons.  I also combined the water, honey and yeast and allowed it to sit for 10 minutes prior to adding the remaining ingredients.  I set my bread machine on the dough cycle and then transferred the dough to a greased bread pan when it was finished.  I did not punch the dough down.  I formed it into a loaf shape, covered it with a damp towel, and allowed it to rise for 40 minutes.  I baked it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees and it turned out beautifully.

By using a total of 1 1/4 cups of water and using the "Dough" setting on my bread machine, I made the best free-form rye loaf I've made to date.

I will echo the other positive comments.  I have probably made this recipe 25 times now, with variations, and find it to be the best I've tried.  I take it for lunch almost every day.  It is moist, it does keep longer than others It bakes well in the oven, and it does need at least 1 1/4 cups of water.  Really excellent recipe!

As others sis I upped the water.  I actually started with 1 and 1/4 cup and added another tbs after that.  I also upped the oil as suggested by one review to 1/4 cup.  Then as another reveiwer sugested I went with 2 cups rye and 1 2/3 cup regular flour turned out great.

I made this without a bread machine (although the kitchen aid mixer does about as much of my work) and it was wonderful.  Very fluffy, great texture and delicious.  I added all the dry ingredients plus the oil to the mixer bowl while mixing the warm water, honey, yeast and milk powder together and let them sit for 10 minutes.  Then I added the liquid (1 1/4 cup water and about another tbl spn added during the kneading) and let the machine knead for about 5 minutes.  I let it rise in a warm place (greased bowl with tight lid floating in a sink of warm water) for 45 minutes, punched it down and put it in a warm oven for 5 minutes and then took it out while the oven pre-heated.  Baked for 40 minutes @ 350.  My husband says I "bake good bread."

This bread stayed fresh for longer than other breads.  It is still good after three or four days. I like more caraway flavor.  So I use at least 1 Tablespoon.     I also used 1 1/4 cups of water.  It is delicious.

I made this bread as stated (except for the caraway seeds, we didn't have any on hand).  The only thing I did differently is to make it by hand.  I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes.  Some people complained that it made a dinky sized loaf, but I don't think it was small.  I thought is was a good sized loaf.  Granted I'm going to have to make 2 loaves this week instead of my usual one loaf because everyone keeps going back for more sandwhiches.

I've made this rye twice now. The flavor is not bad, but the density is more reminiscent of brick than bread. Methinks this recipe needs more water.

It made a brick.  I don't understand the rave reviews.  I shall not make it again.  The recipe that came with my West Bend bread machine mades much better rye bread.

After reading some of the other reviews, I added more water and oil, plus 1 t. of sugar to the yeast mixture.  Also, I baked for 30 minutes at 375 degrees.  This bread was good, but not great.  Will keep searching for the perfect recipe for NY Rye Bread.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe for Homemade Rye!!! As with other reviewer's, I used 2 cups dark rye flour and 1 2/3rds cup all-purpose flour and as I didn't have any honey, I used 1 1/2 tbsp plain sugar, also increased the vegetable oil to a 1/4 cup and increased the caraway seeds to 1 tbsp (gotta have lots of seeds!!!) This is fantastic and I couldn't wait to dive in when it was cool enough! it complemented the Butternut Squash Soup I had for dinner! YUM-YUM! Thanks for the great recipe!

This bread did not come out well at all.  It formed a ball in one side of the breat machine, I think it might be better with more water as suggested by other people.  May try it again as the flavour and texture was OK

I did make the changes of rye flour  and reg bread flour and I did use 1/4 cup of water but it was the best rye bread.  It rose so high that  it hit the top of my bread maker.  Delicious toasted. Has become a regular for us.

I followed the suggestions made by others and reversed the rye and bread flour amounts and I omitted the dry milk powder, but I added 1/4 milk to my warm water.  Made this with a stand mixer and I was a bit worried the dough might be too stiff, but it worked out quite well.  Very tasty, dense rye bread to rival my local (NY) bakery.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I've never made rye bread before, I chose this recipe since it sounded so good and so many rave reviews about it. I was not wrong to chose it.
This recipe makes an excellent bread. It's light, not heavy at all. 
If your bread does come out heavy, something is wrong with how you did it. 
I did all the suggested modifications, increase water, rye flour, oil, and  caraway seed. No need to add any sugar, you already have the honey.  Decrease the bread flour to 1 2/3 C. You do it with the suggested modifications, you won't be disappointed. 
It's delicious still warm with butter. Yummmm!

Delicious, light and yummy rye bread.  Following the suggestions from the reviews I upped the water to 1 1/4 cups, added an extra tsp of oil and switched the rye & bread flour ratios.  I also left out the powdered milk & gluten.

I have a great tip to add to this rye bread recipe. Cut back on regular flour to one and third cup and you'll see a huge difference. Loved this recipe. I don't have a bread machine and I didn't have gluten or dry milk so I skipped it. I went the route of suggested two cups rye and fourth cup oil but here's the key to good bread. Mix up everything adding just one cup regular flour and mix until it looks like wet sand then add a few tablespoons at a time of regular flour until dough is easy to handle then let rise. Voila! You won't get a brick but great rye bread instead. enjoy!

End result - a tasty, dense loaf, with a wonderful crunchy crust.  This recipe definitely needs some tweaking.  After reading countless reviews, I increased the water to 1 1/4 cups.  I prefer to bake bread in the oven as opposed to the bread machine, so used the dough cycle. And also increased the caraway seed to 3 teaspoons.  The ingredients came together quite nicely with the additional water, however when I went to remove it from the pan, it was just a sticky mess.  Quite a bit of additional four was needed till I was able to free form a loaf, which I'm sure didn't help the texture.  I would like to attempt this recipe again, but will probably try others for rye bread before doing so.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Doug.

used the no-knead/high heat process for this but added 1C chopped onions - roasted to eliminate water and carmelize a bit (otherwise bread soggy) and toasted the caraways a few minutes. Kept rye content to no more than 20% - great crusty bread

I made this recipe as is for the first try.  No changes.  Could not use the bread machine as it was too dense to knead it. Will try again following some of the reviews to add more water.

Honestly, meh. It was pretty ordinary. I tried the suggestions to use more rye and less wheat flour and got a smaller, harder loaf with not that much more flavour. I was hoping to get a good recipe to make smoked meat sandwiches, and this was disappointing.

Once again, echoing the sentiments of needing more water. Other than that, this loaf turned out absolutely perfect. I'm keeping this recipe!

I'm surprised how nice this loaf looked since it's my first attempt at rye bread. I changed the flour proportion to 2C rye and 1 2/3C bread. I needed the extra 1/4C water as others but that may be due to altering the flour. I don't have a bread machine so used my stand mixer and it barely handled this dough, but it did. It was easy to form into a loaf, I used the pull to the bottom method several times around and then pinched the seams and baked it on my silpat for about 35 min at 350 (convection). Not everyone here likes the caraway seeds so I left them out. The texture is soft but sturdy and it was easily cut into thin slices.

This worked well in my toastmaster bread maker  as white bread type, except that it MUST have the higher amount of water noted by the previous reviewers.

This turned out great in the end.  But when we checked the dough during the first knead cycle, as recommended by our bread machine's instructions, we needed to add quite a bit of water, as the dough was too dry.  With the extra water, it turned out beautifully!

Good hearty rye bread but it is a heavier bread. The crust was nice and crusty after baking but it did not raise as high as I wanted and was not as light as I wanted. I will try it again though.  I did increase with 2 cups of rye to 1 2/3 cups of white flour as suggested but that may have made it more dense but I like healthier breads.

Very easy and tasty! I will make this again, but add more rye flour for more flavor. Very good though!

So easy and my husband, the picky eater, LOVED it!  A little too much caraway for my taste, but it was still super yummy!

Used combo of real milk and 1/2 and half to replace the water because I was already knee deep when I released I had no powdered milk. Had to add a 1/4 cup of H20 on top of 1 1/8th  liquid it called for. Made it in my kitchen aid  let it rose 1 hour knocked it down than rise for 3+ hours  baked at 350, 35 min came out perfect.

I’ve made this twice according to the recipe and it turned out the same each time.  We loved it and it wasn’t at all like a brick like some have commented.  I do wish it had a stronger rye flavor though.

Good. High rising. Good sandwich texture.  I made it with Chef John’s corned Beef and Cabbage for St. Patrick’s Day.

I made this with 1 tablespoon of Caraway plus a tablespoon of flax seed, 1 1/4 cups of water plus 2 tablespoons and increased the rye flour portion to 2 cups.  I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt and yeast. I used the "dough" cycle on my bread maker and when done, punched it down into a loaf pan. It took 1 1/2 hours to rise.  The loaf was fairly dense but the texture was quite soft. The flavour was sensational. This is one of the best tasting breads I've made and will be my rye bread from now on.

Made this as posted. As with all breads, you have to adjust how much liquid you use depending on the time of year, etc:. The bread came out great. Kneaded it in bread machine and baked it in a stone bread pan for 40 minutes at 350. A wonderful
loaf for sandwiches.

I used 2/3 tablespoon of caraway seed powder and approximately 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I have a very accurate scale with precision to 0.1 gram and make my breads based on weight of water.  Using a 9-1/2"X5-1/4" loaf pan I weigh 9.5 ounces of water.  This much water for the recipe I used made an oversized loaf.  I also use a professional infra red thermometer that was used in industry.  Published temperature for ideal yeast growth is 95F. Since I refrigerate an opened 1 pound block of vacuum sealed instant yeast, adding the yeast drops the temperature. The rest of the water heat to 115F with 1 tablespoon flour and 1/2 TBL sugar then add 1 TBL cold yeast.  It is recommended not to proof instant yeast. I wait long enough for bubbles to form then add more flour to poolish and pour yeast water over fresh flour. The attached pics are of rye bread.

This is a great rye bread recipe hands down the best one I have ever tried.  I bake bread every week for the family this recipe comes out perfect every time.  I make it in the bread machine on dough cycle only changes to this recipe were adding 1-1/4 cups of water and a 1/4 cup of oil, (I do not use caraway seeds family preference) I also use olive oil, then transfer to my bread pan.  I also bake it with a bowl of water in the oven it.

Okay, I did all the recommend modifications that people commented on & I must say this turned out the best Rye Bread that I enjoyed!! Didn't had to add the 1 tbsp of water tho, also placed it all in my food processor & pulsed it a few times, mind you this was my first time baking Rye Bread, also I don't care for Rye to much but even I loved it, & I increased the Caraway Seeds to 3 tsp. Everyone who tried it LOVED IT!!! Even my Rabbi said its a keeper especially when you can't buy it being that I don't live in New York, I've tasted some really good Rye Bread but this one is truly a keeper!!!!! Also I added about 1/2 cup of Walnuts, I had to knead it in along with the seeds, yummy!!

Very good recipe.  I put in the 1 1/4 c. water other reviewers recommended, then I found I had to add an extra 3 Tablespoons of water  to get the dough consistency right.  After that baked up, it was excellent!

So I combined this one w/"Pumpernickel I" and wasn't crazy about the results. A bit dry and lacking in rye or pump flavor. The only change I made was to up the rye flour, like I saw recommended, 2/3rds and reduced the bread flour by same. Also, have not tried a rye bread till this one. Guess like the italian, it still needs more trial and error. Anyone have any marble recipes/experiences?
