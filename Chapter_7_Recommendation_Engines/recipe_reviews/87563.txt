I've  made this so many times now I no longer need the recipe.  Changes I've made: I always use mozzarella instead of cheddar and I use fresh basil, and plenty of it, instead of the dried. This makes a HUGE difference. Just chop or tear it in pieces and sprinkle it liberally over each layer. I use beefsteak tomatoes and let the slices rest on paper towel to drain a while before placing them in the dish so it doesn't become too watery.  Also, I use a little bit more garlic and cheese than the recipe calls for.  This has become one of our favorite Italian dinner side dishes, and it really does go very well with grilled meats.  It's easy and so delicious! An excellent Summertime side dish!

My family really loved this recipe!  When preparing the recipe, I 1st sliced all the tomatoes & layed them out on several layers of paper towels on a cookie sheet to drain.  Usually tomato recipes like this are runny but his tip from another reviewer really helped.  Also, instead of adding salt & pepper to the cheese mixture I sprinked them lightly on each layer of vegetables as I went.  I used fresh basil & oregano.  When the casserole is finished cooking allow it to cool & set-up for about 10-15 min.  We had this with grilled Italian sausage & a crusty loaf of bread!

This dish is excellent.  If you have lots of tomatoes and zucchini in the garden, this makes for an excellent side dish.  I make it almost every night.  Goes great with everything.  Instead of cheddar cheese, I prefer to use mozzarella.  I also grow yellow and orange tomatoes in my garden and alternate red and yellow or orange, which makes the presentation beautiful.  I server this dish as much as I can throughout the summer and it is a hit with everyone I share it with.

OMG, this recipe is so good.  I used cheddar and shredded mozzerella cheese, topped it with sauted mushrooms and onions and fresh pieces of mozzerella and left off the bread crumbs.  i could have eaten the whole dish myself.  Will be a regular at my house!!

Not bad.  Definately easy to make.  I agree with a previous reviewer who said it tastes like pizza.  I added a jalapeno for some spice, fresh herbs, about half the amount of breadcrumbs, and a mexican cheddar cheese blend instead of regular cheddar.

OMGoodness!!! Could this be any better? I did alter it a bit. I added double everything except the basil and oregano. I only used 1 zucchini but it was over 12 inches long and over 3 inches diameter. You gotta love homegrown veggies!!!

This is an excellent summer recipe for a day when it's not too steamy to light the oven.  After making the original as written I altered it a bit.  I use shredded Swiss cheese instead of cheddar and drain both the zucchini and tomatoes to prevent the dish from getting soggy.  I've also sauteed chopped leeks in olive oil in place of the butter and onions.

The zucchini was unevenly cooked, but that was because I was in a hurry and quickly chopped the zucchini into uneven pieces.  Follow that part of the recipe and try to keep the pieces thin and even for consistent cooking.  Also there was a bit of runniness at the bottom of the dish.  Personally, I don't know if the bread crumb step is necessary and I probably won't make the fatty bread crumb topping again.  However it TASTED GREAT.  I will DEFINITELY make again with modifications.

I love this recipe, although I added more cheese and mozzarella, fresh basil and oregano.I did't have any plum tom. I used beefsteak tom. This recipe reminds to fried zucchini and when I eat fresh tomato w/ fresh mozz. and basil. The best!! Thanks.

This is a great recipe on its own but I make a few changes when I want to turn it into a meal.  I put leftover rice pilaf on the bottom of the pan.  I then did one layer of each on top.  I also added a 1/2c of light sour cream to the cheese mix resulting in a nice creaminess.  Italian sausage would also be a nice addition.  Oh, I also reduce the garlic as it is a little overpowering.

My husband & I loved this recipe!  It is so easy to make.  Per the advice of another reviewer, I drained the tomato slices on paper towel before adding to the casserole - worked flawlessly.  A few notes to add (since I'm a "newer" cook, I thought these "lessons learned" may help other newbies!): 1. I used a slicer to thinly slice both the zucchini & tomato - but my slices were pretty thin, so I had a lot of slices.  Originally, I only layered the casserole dish with one thin layer of zucchini, added cheese, one thin layer of tomato, added cheese, repeat.  Well, b/c my slices were so thin, it was very cheesy (I love cheese, so it worked!).  The next time, I just layered the slices of one zucchini on the bottom (which was like 2-3 slices deep), added cheese, layered tomaotes (2-3 slices deep), added cheese & repeat.  This made the veggie-to-cheese ratio much better...and the taste was still fantastic.  2. I also used fresh basil - just tore up some leaves and added on top of each veggie layer 3. I used 1 c. shredded mozz, 1 c. shredded mild cheddar, 1/2 c. grated parm as my cheese blend.  I added 4 tsp of minced garlic (comes in a jar) & dried oregano.  I stirred this & sprinkled on each veggie layer.  My first attempt made me want to cover the entire layer each time...but later this seemed to be unnecessary.  Instead, using less allowed the veggie flavor to stand out more. 4. I did not add the breadcrumb topping (per the tastes of me & my husband).  I did fully cover the last

WOW what a dish!  Like other reviwers I subbed mozzarella for the cheddar, and fresh basil for dried, otherwise followed the recipe as written.  The longer it cooks uncovered the better!  Unlike others, though, I don't consider this a summer dish...fresh vegetables from the garden, I get it...but the layers of cheese, and the fact that it needs almost an hour to cook, makes this more appropriate for colder weather (personal opinion).  It was so delicious though, I can't wait until the fall, this will be in my regular rotation!  Thanks deltaqueen50!

I've made this recipe twice and it was a huge hit both times. I used panko bread crumbs which makes for a crunchier topping, which I like. I also reduced the butter to 2 tablespoons, a 1/4 cup seemed like too much. This is a savory and delicious crowd pleaser and very simple to make.

I doubled the recipe and made this for a crowd; it got rave reviews.  You will not be sorry if you use fresh chopped basil (a few tablespoons to 1/4 cup depening on your liking).   Note that if you double the recipe it will work in a 9x13 pan, barely.  I think you can lighten the recipe by using less cheese and breadcrumb topping and it would still come out great!  thanks

Everyone loved this casserole! Like other reviewers, I substituted fresh basil and mozzarella. I actually had fresh mozzarella which I sliced and used only in the middle layer. Yum! I also used more onions than called for in the recipe and squash since that's what I had available. This was a delicious, low calorie (I didn't use the butter) and versatile recipe that I will use again and again. I got many compliments on this one! Thanks DeltaQueen :o)

I have made this many times now, and it's always a hit.  At this point, I use a glass 8" deep dish casserole dish, add 1/3 to the cheese, two extra garlic cloves, and make it six layers high instead of four.  I also don't use the grainy storebought bread crumbs anymore.  I tried smashed club crackers, and that worked fairly well, but the real trick is three quatered pieces (or so) in the blender with a high quality artisan bread for finely ground fresh breadcrumbs.  Ciabatta or Pugliese seems to work very well.  For a nice variation, I use sliced and then coursely chopped red bell pepper, placed sparsely on the zucchini layers for some added richness in taste.  This was a great recipe as submitted, but it's very open to interesting variations without too much danger of hurting the end result.

I think it's perfect the way it's written.  It's so delicious and simple. I feel it's so simple that replacing anything would alter the taste a lot. It would be nice if reviews were based on the original recipe and not an altered version. Especially when they're negative reviews, it makes this great recipe sound bad! I did cheddar like the recipe called for, I didn't think it tasted like a pizza.

Incredible!!!  Wonderful!!!  Delicious!!!!  I've made this at least 4 times in the last month!  I've made it exactly as written and with variations and it is always great!  Great with green onions in place of regular onions, and different types of cheeses.  Different types of tomatoes might yield a more watery casserole, but it always tastes great!!!!!!  Thank you for a great recipe!!

I just made this and it was really good, I did take the advice of others and let the tomatoes sit on paper towel for a bit first.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I modified it so much.  I honestly don't think you can go wrong with this.  

I didn't want all the fat and that is why I modified so much. I layered it like lasagna and on top of each layer I added some salt/pepper/onion (I didn't cook it first) basil/oregano/minced garlic/and a little parmesan cheese.  On the final layer I topped it with more parmesan cheese and some bread crumbs and then sprayed it with non stick cooking spray.  The last five minutes I put it under the broiler.  I served it with some pasta and added some crushed red pepper on top.  It was a huge hit.

I really enjoyed this!  I subbed mozzarella and added 1/2 white onion, finely sliced, with the zucchini layer.  I used panko breadcrumbs for the topping and it was wonderful.  This dish was easy to prepare, healthful, and attractive once cooled and sliced.  Next time I will add more seasoning and make sure my tomatoes have a chance to drain on paper towels prior to assembly.

This is deee-lish and will become a regular late summer dish in my home. I also used fresh basil and a bit more garlic. I'm sure it would be good with just about any kind of cheese too. I didn't have any trouble with it being too watery because I don't grow regular zucchini anymore, since I discovered "romanesco" zucchini. It's much drier and the texture holds up beautifully. Pattypan squash would work too.

This dish was fantastic!  I made it for a bbq side because our garden was over flowing with tomatoes and zucchini and it tured out fantastic!  I even had a neighbor who didn't like zucchini try it and he loved it!  I will definately make this again!

I cut the zukes thick so they wouldn't get soggy and used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  I also just tossed raw onion in instead of sauteeing first. Very delish!!  The least of the picky children ate this as did Daddy and myself!!

I made this for dinner last evening and it was really tasty.  I did modify the recipe quite a bit to lower the fat and use the ingredients I had on hand.  Here are my changes:  I used 3 medium sized regular tomatoes that I sliced about 1/4 inch thick.  I salted them and let them sit over the sink in a colander to drain for 1/2 hour.  Sliced four small zucchini about 1/8 inch thick and salted them and laid them out on a cooling rack over a sheet pan for 1/2 hour, then rinsed and dried them.  For the topping, I used 1 cup of mozzarella cheese in place of cheddar, and only 2T of EVOO to sauté the onions.  Subbed panko for the bread crumbs and only used 1/2 cup, assembled and baked per directions.  I didn't have any of the moisture problems that other reviewers had with the recipe.  I think letting the vegetables drain really helped.  This was a very good recipe and I would definitely make again.  I just had what was left over for lunch!  Yum-o!

This was pretty good even after cutting back the cheddar to a half cup.  My husband would have preferred that I also cut back on the breadcrumbs.

My family and I really liked this dish. This is the first time my son has ever eaten zucchini, reluctantly of course. It surprised him, he said it tasted like pizza.

It was delicious, but watery.  I did the tomato thing as others said, but still watery. zucchinis let off a lot of water too.  I will make it again for sure, but next time if its worth my time, I'll saute zucchini first and drain off liquid before assembling it, that should cut bake time down in return.  But its not a big deal, this recipe was great.  I loved it with mozzarella and fresh basil and veggies from garden.

This was a huge hit. I used 1 cup of mozzerella and 1 cup of cheddar. Used 1-1/2 cans of diced tomatoes...drained, and 4 garlic cloves. Smelled wonderful while baking. So far, this is my favorite zucchini recipe. My mom called while I was cooking it, so I gave her the recipe. She has since tried it and raved about it also.

I've been making zucchini casserole since I was in college back in the 70's and it's still a favorite to this day! Mine is a simpler version: layer tomatoes, zucchini, and mozzarella cheese and add fresh basil to each layer. Topping with bread crumbs is optional, but I usually do. All fresh garden ingredients is best  and any good tomato variety works. Fresh is best. If your tomato is greenhouse grown, just wait until fresh ones are ready! (And I operated a greenhouse for 25 years).

Really good with these modifications.
1. No oregano, eliminates the pizza taste that was a complaint.
2. Used seasoned bread crumbs and a little Emeril's Essence to "kick it up a notch".

This is sooo good! Just make sure you slice and lay out tomatoes and zucchini on paper towels and blot dry, other wise very easy and full of flavor. One of my go to favorites.--Cindy

This was delicious!  It is definitely necessary to drain the zucchini and the tomatoes.  I used plum tomatoes and deseeded them by giving them a light squeeze after cutting the end off and then let them dry on paper towels with the zucchini.  The other absolute necessity is using fresh basil!  This was fabulous. When it was done, it cut like a cake and was full of flavor.  I will definitely make again.

You could pretty much make this recipe with any combination or variation on the ingredients or layering and it would be fine and taste the same. As others have mentioned, it tastes like pizza. It's mostly cheese, tomato, and Italian seasoning, so that shouldn't be a surprise. So while it's easy to throw together, fairly foolproof, and tastes good, it's also pretty standard. Not exactly gourmet, but a good basic you could jazz up with some creativity. I'd experiment with using sun-dried tomatoes, or switching out the cheese for gruyere or feta. Also, do be sure to dry the tomatoes or the bottom of the pan will be swimming in liquid.

Really good! However, I used a LOT more cheese than the recipe called for. I had to grate in more twice, because I was left with buckets of veggies and nothing to put in between.
Just a little note, to grate more cheese!
It was, however, wonderful. I love how the cheese was seasoned with those herbs(I used fresh basil, oregano, and the garlic), it worked perfectly with the veggies. My whole family loved this and I'm definetlly going to be making it a whole lot from now on!!!

YUM! What an excellent way to eat tomtoe and zucchini. My hubbie probably would only have given it 3-4 stars but, he is not a huge fan of tomatoes (even still, he ate 2 helpings!) I cut the butter by half and doubled the onion (used half of a medium red onion).

/drool! This was so good! Amidst a sea of "tomato zucchini this-or-that" recipes on here, I came across this one, &, joy that I did! I didn't have plum tomatoes (used diced in can), & I didn't have shredded cheddar (used mozzarella), & I hid a little layer of pepperoni in the middle. We skipped the breadcrumb topping and just stuck w/ ooey-gooey cheese. I don't think my changes would've altered my giving Deltaqueen's recipe 5-stars, b/c it was, as Homer Simpson said, "groin-grabbingly transcendent."

This was excellent!  Very tasty.  Used cheddar and parmesan.  Also used fresh oregano and basil since it was in my garden.  I did add only a smidgen of salt as the cheese adds alot of saltiness to the recipe.  I used regular tomatoes, not roma and it was not too juicy; just left it in the oven a few minutes longer without the foil.

Great recipe.  To me, the star of this dish is the cheese mixture.  I actually modified the recipe to go with a turkey for our Christmas dinner (tired of green beans!).  So I used thyme and fresh parsley instead of oregano and basil and used shallot instead of garlic.  Eliminated the bread crumb topping because we had turkey stuffing on our plates.  Lined up rows alternating zucchini, summer squash and tomato slices and interspersed the cheese mixture between slices.  Covered with foil and baked per instructions.  It was the absolute favorite item on our table.

My husband and I both loved this dish.  I am always on the hunt for vegetable based dishes because they are so much lower in calories.  I thought it tasted kind of like lasagne, but I have to say I liked it better than regular lasagne.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I tried a half cup of corn meal.  It was a little gritty, so I will be making some bread crumbs to have on hand for the next time I make this.  Great way to use up extra zucchini and tomatoes from the garden.  I also used Monterrey Jack cheese instead of cheddar.

I absolutely LOVED this!!! 5 starts aren't enough! I used a full 2 cups of cheese instead of the 1 and half because I thought you can't have too much cheese. I would actually use the 1 and 1/2 next time. And I used panko instead of fine bread crubms, BUT amazing!!!! This could very easily become a meal in and of itself!!!

I can't figure out why everyone liked this so much; it tasted just like most of the zucchini recipes out there only was much more time consuming because of all the layers.  I used a full 2 cups of cheddar, since that's what was in the bag and you can never have too much cheese!  I also used lots of fresh basil.  I happened to make a baked ravioli recipe the next day and noticed that combining the two results was quite tasty... I think I'll try incorporating ravioli and sauce into this recipe at a later date...

this was so good believe me i'm making it again.there are 3 of us that live here and my men (father & boy friend) loved it I did double the recipe and I used some garlic salt a little less basil. and maybe a little more cheese. my men eat two helpings a piece and again today they had two more helpings a piece. I might have a 3 inch square left out of a casserole dish. I love it also. thank you so much. LOVED, LOVED,LOVED IT

YUM!  I followed RivertownMom's suggestions and used mozzarella instead of cheddar, and lots of fresh basil and oregano too!  It ended up filling a 9x13 and turned out absolutely delcious!

Still trying to figure out how to eliminate the excess water from the fresh veggies. It drives me mad! I did the tomatoes under the broiler and that worked well and gave them a delicious flavor, but then the zucchini made the dish watery. I will try it under the broiler next time as well and see if this cuts down on the soup like qualities of the dish.

Had a lot of produce so I customized this a bit.  I had a bunch of cherry tomatoes so I quartered them.  I also used 1 zucchini and 1 yellow squash.  I added thinly sliced mushrooms and green onions to the layers.  On the top, I spread some panko bread crumbs and drizzled with EVOO instead of the onion/butter mixture.
People had seconds so it's a keeper.

Delicious!!  Took the advice of another user and used fresh basil in a layer instead of dried and it made it even better!  Great recipe - thanks!

Made as written.  Is super yummy and a great way to use up zucchini in the summer.  Loved the Italian flavor!  The kids weren't crazy about it, but it's a keeper for me and the hubbie!

A very simple casserole and a great way to use up those garden vegetables... using mozzarella is an option instead of chedder depending on your preference... next time I want to try adding some cottage cheese to the cheese mixture.. if you want a healthier option I don't think that filling the bread crumbs with that amount of butter is necessary... I cut the butter back dramatically and it still tasted good...

I really love this recipe! I have made it various times now and it is always enjoyable. As far as changes.....I added different kinds of veggies, mushrooms especially, a little green onion. I added italian seasoning to the cheese mixture, and I did not saute the onions.....came out wonderful and took that much prep time out of an already simple recipe. ;)

I've made this a few times.  I bought a bag of the artisan cheese mix (the italian one with herbs) to substitute for the cheese mix and it's very good.  I've also made it on the grill in a foil packet- very good again! A great way to use extra zucchini and tomatoes in the garden.

This was really good and easy! I didn't have tomatoes so I just added some spaghetti sauce I had just made and spread that in then topped with cheese and breadcrumbs. I was out of parm so just used extra mexican cheese blend.

This is a great dish, but high in calories. Instead of buttering the pan, use a not-stick spray.  Instead of cheddar, use skim mozzarella, and instead of butter for onions, use olive oil.  I would love to get compare the calories and fat with my alterations w/the actual recipe.  Let me know what you think.

I had been wanted to make this dish for a while.  It was very good.  I loved the way it looked it the dish.  while I was making the bread crumb topping I thought it would be really excellent, but in the end I didn't really like it as much as I liked the rest of the dish.  Next time I would use less of the topping or top with some additional cheese towards the end of the baking.

Very nice, light dish. I used mozzerella instead of the cheddar cheese and put a layer of stuffing mix on the bottom of the dish also to help soak up some of the juice from the tomatoes that some others commented on.  I also threw in some chopped cooked chicken to make it a one dish meal.   Hubby put some Marinara over the top of his second helping and said that he liked that also.  Will be doing this again.

This dish was okay for me.  I did use fresh herbs instead of dry but I just wasn't crazy for it.  It did make a nice side for the steak.  I might need to give it another go with dry herbs and take everyone's advice on letting the tomatoes drain first.

Just took this out of the oven. I used reviewer suggestions and used mozzarella instead of cheddar, and I was a little too lazy to mince fresh garlic, and used garlic powder.  Very tasty, nice consistency.  Next time will try with fresh herbs and garlic. Thanks for the keeper!

This recipe was awesome!  I had 2 large zucchini and several tomatoes from the garden and it was a great way to quickly throw together a wholesome dish!  I ended up needing a 13x9" dish, but I think it was because my zucchinis were very large.  I followed the advice of others and put the tomatoes on paper towels, and the casserole was only a little watery at the bottom.  I also used fresh basil since I had it on hand.  Tasted great, thanks!

YUM!!! I added fresh mushroom to the layering steps and also I added minced garlic and a 1/2 of a green pepper I had leftover to the onion and butter before adding the breadcrumbs. It turned out great, we will definitely have this again!

We made this last night and it was fantastic. I only had pepper jack cheese in the house. So that's what I used and it was great. This is a great recipe to help burn through some of the zucchini and tomatoes from the garden!

this recipe was quite good BUT its very greasy. i made it as written first and the oily residue on the bottom of the dish was incredible! ive just made it a second time with modifications and it is now an excelllent dish. i cant give it 5stars as it is written but with modifications(all a question of taste, of course) it is excellent! my changes were: i fried they onions in the butter as stated, left out the cheddar COMPLETELY, then mixed the herbs with the onions. i then layered as stated omitting the cheese and mixed the parmesan with the breadcrumbs according to the recipe to sprinkle on top. the second time i didnt have fresh tomatoes so i just opened a can of tomatoes and mixed the onion and herbs with that to layer with the zucchini. BOTH WAYS WERE EXCELLENT!

I had to use canned tomatoes and a little less cheese, but this turned out yummy! I used half zucchini and half summer squash. It was a bit watery on the bottom, but that was my fault I believe. I also used breadcrumbs instead of crackers. Will definitely make again!

I skipped the bread crumbs, butter, and onion step.  (to make lower fat) And added onion salt to the cheese/herb mixture instead. Used Low fat parm/cheddar. Sooooo Good!  Got great reviews at my BBQ this weekend.

Great recipe.  I didn't change a thing except added some Penzy's Tuscan Sunset for seasoning.  I was surprised how much flavor there was!  Will definitely make it again in the future.  This could be a vegetarian main dish.

Very tasty. I prepped and did the 1st 25 min of cooking one night and then finished the cooking another night.  I think ti would have been nice with a more potent cheese.

Excellent dish. It took longer to prepare that I would have liked, especially if you use fresh basil and fresh oregano. And substitute mozzarella cheese. But, my 11 year old who doesn't usually eat tomatoes or zucchini ate this with no complaints! I think the mozzarella cheese won her over!

Loved this!  I was short on time, however, so I sauted the veggies and herbs in a pan for a few minutes, sprinkled mozzarella and parmesan on the top and the butter/breadcrumb mixture on top of that.  I put the pan in the oven for 15 minutes to melt the cheese and it was a hit.  I plan to try the original cooking method next week.

I just tried this recipe tonight.  I used fresh tomatoes and zucchini from the farmers market.  It was great.  My family ate the whole casserole in one sitting!  I will definitely be making this again.

Absolutely fantastic!  I subbed mozzarella for the cheddar but otherwise followed the recipe as written except that I did 1/2 recipe since it's only me to eat it.  Made at least 3 and maybe 4 servings!  I paired this with grilled pork tenderloin but think I could have  eaten only this and been a happy camper!  Can hardly wait to serve it to my zucchini-hating granddaughter!  I'll bet she'll love it too!

A good starting place, but the first time was too soupy. The second time, I used whole wheat lasagna noodles, (dry) browned Italian sausage, Vidalia onions, (sautéed), panko bread crumbs. Much better my way. Just saying.

After making this recipe as written (that is the 4 star rating) I now use the changes that Lala posted.  She doesn't state how much fresh herbs she uses.  I use about 8-10 fresh basil leaves, chiffonade and about 1 teaspoon of minced fresh oregano.  I also use buffalo mozzarella. Because of family allergies, I also used fresh gluten free bread crumbs.  
IN ADDITION: I made this again last night but used smoked sea salt directly on the tomatoes and smoked paprika in the bread crumbs.  It was delicious!

It's easy, and yummy.  I didn't change a thing except I used dried onion flakes because I forgot to get fresh onions at the store.  I served it with corn and a chicken dish.

This was delicious. I was looking for a recipe that would use up some remaining ingredients in my fridge...so I did tweak it slightly, but not enough for it to be a new recipe. I already had some large tomatoes, they weren't plum but not sure what kind they were, so I used those instead of buying new tomatoes. I, also, added a layer of yellow squash because I had one I desperately needed to use up. The only other change was that I doubled the cheese mixture so it would coat more evenly. I gave portions of this to some friends and family and they all gobbled it up and asked for the recipe. It was definitely a hit.

Fabulous.  I love this recipe! I did cut back about 1/3 to 1/4 on the butter, crumbs, and cheese just to save on calories.

This could have been great but there was a lot of liquid in the dish, and it needed much more cheese and bread crumbs. Nevertheless, it looks beautiful on the table!

I've been making this type casserole for 40 years.  However, I add cooked crumbled bacon or diced ham to it and it's wonderful.

Very watery. Cook your zucchini a little and drain excess water before adding to the recipe. The flavor was good though.

I scaled this to two servings and used a provolone/mozzarella cheese blend and panko for the bread crumbs.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  I too, drained my tomatoes on paper towels before assembling this.  I baked it as directed and popped it under the broiler at the end to give the panko a little more color.  This was good, but it didn’t have the wow factor I was hoping for.

I just made this for the second time. The first time I made it and it was only okay. But this time it was AWESOME! I did cut up the zucchini and beefsteak tomato, and I also cut up some portobello mushrooms thinly and used some asparagus that I had in the fridge. This was a great combination of veggies! In my casserole I made a layer of zucchini, then mushrooms and asparagus, and then tomatoes before the topping went on. It came out really well. My cheese was a mixture of cheddar and parmesan and mozzarella, and I added dried parsley and red pepper flakes to the mixture. Try it!

Fantastic!  Since I had a rectangular pan instead of a square one, I only did one layer.  I think with two layers, the cheese would be more oozy in the middle, but it was the flavor was perfect!

This was incredible!  I followed it exactly except that I used large cherry tomatoes that I had on hand.  Fabulous!  I will say it took a lot longer than I expected to prepare and cook it, but I would definitley make it again for company!

My two daughters dread zucchini, yet they both beg me to make this dish.  It's simple to make, quite tasty, and an easy way to get my kids to eat a veggie they both normally avoid.  Thanks for the recipe!

Two notes:  I thought 3/4 cup bread crumbs was too much, so the second time I reduced the amount to 1/4 (too little), so I think the right amount for us is 1/2 cup.  And like other users, I used mozzarella instead of cheddar.

I really wanted to like this since it has some of my favorite ingredients, and just reading the recipe made it seem like a winner, but it was not. I followed the directions and did not make any substitutions. The only thing that I changed is that I baked it a little longer than directed since I put a lasagna in the oven at the same time. It looked great coming out of the oven, but the zucchini and tomatoes still tasted undercooked. Today I covered it and put it in the microwave on high for ten minutes to try and cook/soften the vegetables more and it did help somewhat. I will probably make this again, but I might sauté the zucchini first or marinate it with olive oil and seasonings.

This was very delicious. I had to cook longer than the specified time, but it wasn't a big deal. Now my zucchini won't go to waste. And I used three different cheeses (mozzarella, cheddar and velveeta).

I didn't use mozarella as others suggested but next time I think I will.  I agree with others, too, that 1/4 C. of butter is too much.  Scale that back to a couple of tablespoons if you're concerned about far.  Also, I forgot to add the salt and in my opinion, unless you're a real salt freak, it's not at all necessary.  There is enough in the cheese and the bread crumbs and butter.  Excellent with fried and breaded eggplant.  I'm vegetarian and this is a wonderful keeper.

Wonderful and full of flavor! I added 1 sprig of chopped fresh rosemary which brought out the essence of oregano and basil. I also added about 1/3lb of browned, lite, pork sausage to the middle layer, which made it a little heartier. Because I made a large (9x13) PYREX casserole I also used 2 yellow squash mixed with the 2 zucchini in the layers. This is fabulous and I WILL be making it again soon!!!

This recipe is fantastic!  I'm the cook that reads the reviews for the recipes and never posts a review. This time I had to comment on how good it was. The tomato haters and zucchini haters raved about this side. Even my picky toddler enjoyed it!  My only changes were slightly cooking the zucchini with a small clove of grated garlic prior to assembly, then I threw in some fresh basil on top of the tomatos because I had it on hand. It was heavy enough that we ate this as a main dish with other fresh veggies as sides.  If your worried about calorie content, learn portion control!

Delicious!  Changes: I used crushed crakers instead of bread crumbs and decreased the amount of butter to 2 Tbl.  Used mozzerella cheese instead of chedder as others suggested.  I found I didn't need the entire cooking time.  It was mostly done during the first phase with the foil on, but I left it in anothr 10 minutes just to be sure.  Yummy!

Made the recipe as is with no additional salt.  I was hesitant to put in 1/4 cup of butter (so much butter!) but the Panko bread crumbs I used and the dried onion immediately soaked up everything.  I blotted the tomatoes as others recommended.  After I cut the first slice some liquid pooled into the empty space.  I dumped it out.  Despite the additional water it was very flavorful!  Great use for zucchini.

Excellent recipe! It took about 10 min. longer to cook. Easy to make and uses lots of that garden overflow of tomatoes and zucchinis. This one is a keeper

Made this dish for a crowd and because the garden was producing more squash than one could ever use.  The only change I made was to add Mozzerella cheese to the mix.  Excellent!

This is incredible!  Only changes I made were didn't butter the pan, just sprayed with non stick spray, sauteed the onion in olive oil with 1 tbs of butter and added a sprinkling of cheddar on top while browning the top and , just had to put in a larger pyrex dish since it wouldn't fit in a 9x9 for me.  Very good, may try with mozarella next time as i'm sure that would be delicious as well.

There is just one word for this recipe..YUM! I substituted mozzarella cheese for Parmesan. I sliced the zucchini with the slicer attachment to my Kitchenaid mixer. The thinly sliced zucchini gave the dish an incredible texture. When I make this recipe again I will probably use one clove of garlic. Try it, you'll like it!!!!

Great basic recipe. Like others, I used mozzarella and fresh basil. Will definitely eliminate breadcrumbs in the future and just top with cheese. Looking forward to trying it with cheddar in the future. I also think I might try adding or substituting eggplant.

This is one of the first Veggie meals that we have tried. My husband and I LOVE it!  I made a couple of changes.  I use 1C cooked brown rice for the base and 1/4 C silken tofu and 1/4 C coconut milk blended smooth and pour over the veggies and rice.  Then I top with mozzerella. I will try fresh herbs or doubling them for a bit more flavor next time.  I agree with the "let it cool 15 minutes before serving" so it sets up.  My changes make a completer protein and we use it as a complete meal.  It is great.

This is so fantastic! I don't measure when I cook so I winged it. I used fresh tomatoes, zucchini, oregano, and basil from the garden. I subbed sharp cheddar for cheddar and mozz for parm because it's what I had on hand. I also left the onions in slivers because I prefer them that way. I used more herbs than called for and also more onions. This is a great recipe, make it your own. I served it as a main with a side of brown rice with vermicelli cooked in chicken broth and a side of steamed broccoli doused in fresh squeezed lemon, my meat loving family adored this dinner

This was sooooo yummy!  I made it and my boyfriend took a scoop to eat before we were ready to sit down.  I was waiting for his opinion and asked "is it good"?  He looked at me and said "no, it's not good."  "It's @#$%^&* AWESOME!  I used mozzarella rather than cheddar and fresh herbs from the garden as well as scallions instead of onions.  It was REALLY good and I agree that it's just as good reheated.  (Even as sort of a dip with tostada chips....)

OUTSTANDING!  I added a bit more pepper, but followed the recipe.  It was so worth it.  I loved it on the second day (for lunch) as well.  Hats off!  Will definitely make this again and possibly for Christmas Eve!!  Thanks!!

My kids loved it!  I did peel teh zucchini so there was no skin and they had no idea what is was and didn't care.  This is a great recipe to use those giante zuccinis that show up in the garden.

I loved this recipe. My friend gave me fresh from the garden zucchini and tomato. I also had fresh basil which was yummy. I sauted my onions in sherry and crushed 1 bag of ritz crackers adding that to the onion mixture in place of bread crumbs. It passed the "My husband loved it" test! Thanks so much:)

This is phenomenal, and I'm not a huge zucchini fan.  I did make some changes however, to suit my taste.  I used panko bread crumbs, 2 teaspoons of minced garlic and a red onion in the butter mix for the topping; didnt have parmesan cheese or shredded cheese (nearing grocery shopping time) so I diced up some provolone slices and shredded some sharp cheddar slices, used canned diced tomatoes (completely drained) and added about 3/4 slab of cream cheese (cut up into small slices, about 5 on each layer).  I am eating the leftovers for lunch right now and mmmm...amazing!!! Still relatively low carb, with the exception of the bread crumbs which makes hubby happy!

I added mozzarella instead of parmesean and it is my husband's favorite.

This casserole was excellent! So easy and tasty! I used white sharp cheddar and shredded about a cup (cut down on the fat content). Everything else as written. Definitely a keeper.

Our teenage guest wasn't a fan of this, but hubby and I really enjoyed the flavours. It was mouthwatering. We had the whole thing in one sitting. The only thing I did different was to saute the garlic with the onions for the topping.

I just made this for a party, and people RAVED about it, even my mother-in-law who claims not to like zucchini!  I used less cheddar than called for (I doubled the recipe, and used 2 c. instead of 3), and also used 1/4 c. butter in the breadcrumb topping.  I had 5 people ask me for the recipe.  I think I will use mozzarella next time to go along with the Italian flavors of the dish.

I am blessed with an abundance of these ingredients this summer.  I forgot the onions but otherwise made as directed.  The timing was a little off by using a round Pyrex dish...but it worked out OK.  This dish is just as advertised:  highlights summer flavors!

Delta Queen you are the QUEEN!  This was delicious.  I also used mozzarella.  My only regret is that I can't get Ohio tomatoes now that I live in H-town but will share this with my family up north.  It was great!  Also my hubby not a huge fan of tomatoes ate 2 helpings!

OMG! This dish was awesome.  I had bought some zucchini and squash at a local stand and needed to use them.  Found this on the web site.  Loved it and so did the rest of the family.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks

Made this in the summer when zucchini and tomatoes were fresh - it was delicious!  Served it at an outdoor bbq party with ribs and chicken and there wasn't any left.  Many guests asked for the recipe.

This was a great recipe.  I made a few changes to make it healthier.  I left out the bread crumbs and butter, changed the cheese to mozzarella, and reduced the cheese to one cup.  Just needed some pasta to serve it with!

I really enjoyed this.  I added yellow peppers and adjusted the spices to my taste.  Of course I also used spray butter and just a little cheese.  I baked it at 400 for 15-20 minutes and I was able to cook it with my Uglies.  Yummy.

This was easy and delicious.  I omitted the breadcrumbs because I did not have any in the house. I used beefsteak tomatoes instead of roma and I used only 1/2 cup of parmesean and mozarell each. I also omitted the butter, but it still tasted great!

This dish is fantastic.  The flavors are wonderful, and it went very well with an Italian themed pot luck at church.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, and everything was perfect.  I will definitely make it again.

Absolutely delicious!!  I followed the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and laid my zucchini and tomato slices on paper towels for a few minutes before layering.  I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  My husband and I both had seconds and even my 2 year old liked it.  I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I was having some vegetarian guests to a cookout and wanted to have some tasty options for them and came across this. It was a hugh hit for EVERYONE (not just the vegetarians). This will become one of my staple recipes to bring to cookouts. I used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 mozzerella... It was great! I did make sure to seed the tomatoes well and there was no excess liquid.

Added 1 cup Smoked  Gruyère and 1 cup mozzarella to the cheddar. It was a really watery, due to the tomato and zucchini. Other than adding more bread crumbs, not sure how to remedy that. Otherwise, it was delicious.

I used Kerry Gold Garlic herb butter for the bread crumbs and onions and I'm so happy I did!

I used a can of crushed tomatoes because I didn't have fresh ones in the house and I don't recommend it. I would also add some more bread crumbs!! Hehe.

Very good! I'll most likely add a third layer of zucchini and half the amount of breadcrumbs.

Very good but did modify as others. Used mozzarella with a little cheddar, used fresh basil, added the sautéed onions to the layers and  did not add butter to the panko bread crumbs just sprinkled over the dish and baked.  I did drain the tomatoes and zucchini on paper towels prior to assembling. Took to a cookbook club and everyone loved it.

So good! Swapped a few items. Used mozzarella cheese and no perm since i had none. Also omitted oregano since we done like and doubled the basil. I had a half box of cornbread stuffing mix and used that instead of bread crumbs. We r vegan so used vegan cheese and margarine: Will make again!

Fabulous! I used 1 can of Italian stewed tomatoes (drained and cut into bite-sized pieces) and 1 can of (drained) Rotel- that’s what I had on hand. I also used a combination of mozzarella, jack, colby and parmesan cheeses- again that’s just what I had on hand. Oh, and the topping was super yummy:)
Thank you for an awesome side dish recipe!

Made the recipes exactly as written. Was tasty and a good use of summer garden produce, but when I make it again will add more herbs and definitely some red pepper flakes, It can easily become a 5 Star selection.

Definitely will make this again. I used less bread crumbs than called for by the recipe (husband needs to watch carbs) - the recipe is still wonderful, even with 1/2'ing the bread crumbs.

Delicious and easy!  I made it exactly as written except for the type of tomatoes (I used large salad tomatoes, sliced with a mandolin and drained on paper towels).  A lovely side dish that I will use often.

A great use of summer fresh zucchini and tomatoes. Made as stated with exception of subbing mozzarella for the cheddar...this seemed like a no brainer.  Smelled amazing, and it was light (although not low in fat) and flavorful.  I used beefsteak tomatoes that were dried on paper towels before using, per others suggestions.  I really enjoyed the bread crumb top mixed with the onion.  It was just enough to give it extra flavor but was not overpowering.  5 Star rating from my Vegetarian daughter.

Loved it.  Just topped with a bit more cheddar cheese and added fresh sliced mushrooms to the 1 at later on t the cheese..  The 9x9 dish was too small, so I went a little bigger.  When I layered it in the dish, it was heaping.  I was afraid it would spill out, it did not.  It cooled down, when I took it out of the oven it was below the rim of the dish.  So don't worry it's way over the edge, it'll cook down.    I will make it again.

I followed the recipe pretty much. I did cut back on the cheese to 1 cup of cheddar/mozzarella mix and the parmesan cheese, added a few portabella mushrooms cut up small to the cheese mixture, and used 2 tbsps of butter and half the crumbs(used panko) . A few personal changes and it is a true favorite .

Excellent side dish.  Have now made two times to my family's delight.  The 2 nd time I did  set veggies on a paper towel to minimize moisture.  This resulted in a firmer dish that was cut and served in perfect squares.  As we are a gluten free family, it was so easy to use GF bread crumbs and have an impressive dish.  My next attempt will cut back on butter to reduce calories.   Pairs GREAT with chicken.  Will be a delicious dish to enjoy all summer long.

Using fresh vegetables and Panko really made this dish taste rich.  Used for a vegetarian dinner. Flavors were separate, topping was rich and crunchy and had a good overall presentation.  It was easy to take servings out individually.

This is very good. Because I didn't have tomatoes, I sliced red bell pepper very thinly and used that instead. I also used seasoned breadcrumbs because that is what I had in my freezer. Next time I will try it with tomatoes and bell peppers.

Solid recipe using simple ingredients but with a deceptively impressive result. I agree with top review -- use mozarella instead of cheddar. I also happened to have fresh basil and julienned it through the layers, To simplify the crumb topping, I melted a 1/2 Tbs butter in a measuring cup in the microwave and mixed the bread crumbs (plain and panko) into it after it melted.

I shred some chicken and add it to the layers, and use whatever I have for cheese in the house, usually a mix of cheddar and mozzarella, and use zucchini and summer squash! I’ve never been a fan of zucchini or sun squash, but tried this this summer and yummmm!!!!

Have made this many times, always to rave reviews, great way to use up zucchini and toms fresh from the garden. I halve the amount of breadcrumbs to make it a lower carb dish for my diabetic hubby. Always use Italian style breadcrumbs or add Italian herbs if using plain.

I had been given end of the season too big zucchini and quite a few small plum tomatoes, therefore I happened on this recipe while searching for a way to use them. It was DELICIOUS!  I had to hollow out the zucchini as I was afraid the seeds would be to hard. I didn’t have fresh Parmesan, but used some of the dried in a can, sharp cheddar and mozzarella  fresh garlic and fresh basil. I will definitely make this again... and not wait until the end of next season!

I may have done something wrong but I found the buttered bread crumbs a turn off. I will make it again and will use plain breadcrumbs or just a cheese topping.

This dish was very good, but took too long to prep (especially since I had to make my own bread crumbs) and too long to bake for a weeknight meal.

I inadvertently added a cup of bread crumbs instead of 3/4 cup but it turned out amazingly delicious! It also reheated very well as a leftover meal.

This is a remarkable recipe so great for the summer but will absolutely bring it to the table in winter as well. I exchanged the cheddar for grated queso melting cheese but frankly believe any melting cheese will bit a hit. My bread crumbs were Panko but other than that slight exchange, followed the recipe exactly. I did place the zucchini and tomato slices in between paper towels to absorb excess moisture before baking. It came out of the pan without any pooling juice to ruin the effect. Like a few other reviews, my husband said that it reminded him of pizza, which I not only agree with but what a hit this would be for kids to get their veggies in such a tasty way. Terrific recipe, please try it!  You will add it in as a regular after the very first try.

The cooking time of 25 minutes covered in foil was too short and the thinly sliced zucchini was still a bit hard, but I will make it again.  Mature cheddar gives it a lovely flavor

My family and I looooooove this recipe. I'm a one-stop-shop kinda gal so I like to add chicken to this recipe and serve as a main course. I have also tried it with ground beef but I prefer the chicken. And I usually use whatever cheese is on hand as long as I have some parmesean. Mad Love for this recipe!

This turned out really good and was so easy. I read the reviews and as others suggested, I used mozzarella and parm combo, seeded and then let my tomatoes dry a bit on a paper towel. It was a huge hit! We are the whole pan!

Simple, fast, and delicious.  Next time will try the recommended mozzarella and fresh basil.  We like a little more zip than average so seeded a hot chili, minced it, and sauteed it with the onions before adding the bread crumbs.   Last few minutes, flipped the oven to broil and nicely browned the bread crumbs.  Another 'save' and with just my wife and I, recipe works great for two people.

This was an easy recipe to put together, and we enjoyed it. I think it could do with a little longer cooking  time, as the zucchini in the center wasn't as well cooked as on the outside. Alternatively maybe oven roast the zucchini first to get rid of some of the moisture and partially cook it.
I wanted to make this dish as a main item so did slice some chicken sausage up and added this as a layer in the middle of the dish, which made tasty meal. 
I would make it again, but with the suggestions made above.

This is a good recipe to change up flavors in. I normally have 6-8 different cheeses in my fridge. If you like some heat you can add chopped up hot peppers. I think the amt of breadcrumbs should be reduced.

I made this recipe for a holiday gathering.  Not only was every bite of it eaten, but all of the women present were requesting the recipe.  It was yummy!  The only change that I made to the original recipe was to cut back on the garlic by half.  (The cloves were rather large to begin with.).  I will definitely be making it again!  I think that the next time I will try using mozzarella rather than cheddar and fresh basil rather than the dried herb, just to change it up a bit.

I made the following changes:

I changed the dried basil to fresh basil; changed the dried oregano to dried Italian seasoning; and used a cheese mixture of grated cheddar, parmesan, mozzarella & provolone.  For the bread crumbs, I used panko.  It turned out great!

This is a great recipe.  I used mozzarella instead of cheddar, fresh basil, and large tomato (sliced and drained on paper towels) as previous poster advised.  It was excellent and not watery at all.  Have made this many times now and the family devours it.

OK, this was REALLY good. Big hit with the family. Really does smell and taste like pizza as another reviewer said. I also used fresh basil and sliced & added a small fennel bulb since I needed to use them up. I used half plum and half round tomatoes and just seeded them first to reduce the runny factor. I only had panko crumbs but those turned out fabulous. This does call for more cheese and butter than I'd like but it is so delish I think I'll leave as is.

This was so good!  Got to use all the tomatoes a co-worker gave us.  Used Mozzarella cheese along with the parmesan.  I like my zucchini soft so I cooked it for 70 minutes.  So flavorful!

This was very good.  I followed the recipe very closely but used about three tbsp of fresh basil and  Panko.  I used beefsteak tomatoes since that is what I grow.  It was not  runny. My husband and I both liked it and I will make it again.  Thanks.

Had so many zucchinis and tomatoes from the garden! This was a great recipe for this time of year.  I used Heirloom tomatoes (Berkeley) and subbed za'atar for the oregano.  I also subbed crushed gluten free crackers for bread crumbs. I removed the insides / seeds out of the tomatoes after reading others reviews.  Served over rice for vegetarians, and with a side of grilled chicken for the carnivores. Easy and delicious. Will definitely make this again!

Great easy recipe to make! I had fresh vegetables in my garden, so I used summer squash and cherrie tomatoes. I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar and I added extra herbs especially basil.

So I basically kept the recipe the same, used both crook neck squash and zucchini,  just subbed fresh herbs for the dry, used a mix of Parmesan and Mexican 4 Cheese Blend (what I had on hand) and panko bread crumbs. Absolutely delicious! A definite keeper. Thanks!!!!

We really liked this, surprised how tasty it was! I used a bigger pan, made 3 layers , used mozzarella cheeses for the cheddar, and used Italian breadcrumbs for the topping.

The taste is great and it's a good way to get rid of all those zucchinis and tomatoes that the garden has been pumping out.  The cheese and herb blend was especially awesome (I used fresh basil and oregano). I had two issues one being that the breadcrumbs were a bit much and, like many reviewers, I may cut that in half next time. The second issue is how much water (about 1 inch) was in the pan while we were serving. That's from the tomatoes cooking and releasing their juices so I will probably  squeeze out the tomatoes next time and/or find another way to dry them out a bit before cooking. I will be making this again with a couple tweeks!

This is one casserole I make every summer. From the produce from the garden.  Its perfect right as the recipe states....however every one I think toys with it.  My father actually made this over 20 years ago......and I cant get enough of it.   I do slice my tomatoes....which I love....and I do let them drain for a few minutes because it does get a little watery if you dont...  the cheese I stick with the Cheddar always throw a bit more in.... I have not tried the Mozzarella however but may just try it next time.  I can get my grand kids to eat this even though it has yucky green veggies in it.  They gobble this up.   I will agree with the fresh basil also but dont over power it unless your looking for a Italian dish when making it.  I love the way it taste and any grilled meat  to me is the side item to make with this... its that good. Oh and I do used Pepperidge Farm Herb dry dressing instead of bread crumbs. That is the way my father made it.... and I have tried both ways....and it just taste better.. I think because the crumbs are seasoned well to begin with.

This is REALLY yummy!!!  I just made it tonight and had to post a review. Will make again!  One recommendation:  If you don't have a mandolin slicer, get one!  I used mine for the first time tonight and it makes making this dish even easier!

Great recipe to use up all the zucchini and tomatoes in the fridge. I used fresh oregano and basil. The kids who don't eat zucchini want to know when we're having it again. I used cheddar as the recipe called for, but will try mozzarella next time as another review suggested. Simple and delicious.

Easy and excellent! I used a can of diced tomatoes (no ripe ones from the garden yet...) and stuffing mix, as I had just a little left over from another meal. Love the cheese/fresh basil/herbs & garlic mix. The flavors just blended beautifully.

I followed the recipe besides the Parmesan cheese because I didn't have any so I just added extra cheddar. I also added chicken breast before putting on the breadcrumb, which did require cooking it for a bit longer. It was so good! I have made it several times since with whatever types of squash I have on hand and it has been good every time.

This one is a keeper.  Only changes I made were using fresh herbs and adding extra garlic (I always at least double the amount called for). Next time I may try using some fire roasted tomatoes for a little more heat, but will follow directions for dinner guests next week before I experiment.

Loved this. Followed almost to a T except I used mozzarella cheese and fresh basil with the Parmesan cheese  and added onion to the layers. Soo good!

Great way to use zucchini!  I had green and yellow to use in the layers.  Crushed up dry stuffing to use as the bread crumbs.  Worked out great as a side dish with roast chicken!

This was very good although next time I will use smaller zucchini.  I used only one very large zucchini and I feel it was just too much although I love zucchini very much.  I also had to use smaller tomatoes since that's what I had on hand.  When I make this again, I will also use more cheese, smaller zucchini, plum tomatoes and not too much breadcrumbs.  This is definitely a keeper.

I used truffle cheddar cheese from Trader Joes and halved cherry tomatoes. After the first bite, my husband said this was the most amazing zucchini he has ever had. I will definitely make this again!

Wow, this was even better than I expected! Even my 2-year-old liked it! I actually cut the butter back to 2 tbs and didn't have a problem. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I used Progresso Italian breadcrumbs, and it was just perfect!

As a vegan, I immediately had to sub for the cheese. I sprinkled nutritional yeast flakes on the layers. Also used fresh basil since it's the season!Turned out great! Will definitely be making again.

My husband said (after having two helpings), did you keep the recipe?  I used half cheddar and half mozzarella cheese and added just a tad of garlic when I sauteed the onion.

This dish is a must have.  I use locally grown or organic produce.  I substituted the cheddar cheese for Monterrey Jack cheese.  It gives it additional flavor with a hint of spice and not oily.  My topping I saute the onions and minced garlic in butter and then stir in Italian seasoning bread crumbs. Delish.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Love this recipe! It is perfect for the overload of veggies that we get from our garden. It is also forgiving and flexible. I used yellow zucchini and only half of what the recipe called for but then I added strips of eggplant to make up for the zucchini. I also used a Italian cheese mix in place of the cheddar. I will without a doubt use this one again!!!

I followed this recipe exactly, and it turned out fantastic!  I was surprised that something so simple could taste so good!  Since I made this on a weeknight, I prepped everything the night before and threw it together when I got home.  A great way to get in your veggies!  I will definitely be sending this one along to my mom!

great recipe, like others i laid out my slices of veggies to drain the water on paper towels for an hr, 

I cooked uncle bens wild rice & used that on the bottom as a base, 1 layer of tomatoes, salt, pepper, garlic powder, basil, parmesan, mozzarella cheese, then 1 layer of zucchini followed by the same seasoning and cheese's. 
left out the bread crumbs, since I used rice.  baked like the recipe calls for. yummy

As written, four stars. But with a few modifications, 5 stars. Tasty, in-season tomatoes are a must.  Otherwise, don't bother.   I agree with the reviewer who recommended using mozzarella and fresh oregano and basil.  Fantastic!

This was absolutely delicious. I have never been able to convince my 16 year old son to eat zucchini......until now! Will be adding this dish to my family favourites list. The only change I made was to increase the amount of onion to 1 large onion. Definitely a winner.

I've made this 3 times in as many weeks, LOVE it....Great as a side to BBQ chicken or Tri-tip.   Tonight it will stand alone with a nice salad

Only thing I will change is to cook 3/4 of the time covered, and 1/4 uncovered, so the cread crumbs don't get too brown...

Also, substitute fresh basil and oregano, if possible. YUM

We loved it. I had to eliminate garlic as it doesn't agree with my husband but it would definitely be better with garlic. I made it for my daughter-in -law who is vegetarian  and we all loved it. Next time I would add more bread crumbs on top. I also added fresh parsley and that made the dish look beautiful.

Wow! Made substitution like another reviewer using mozzarella and fresh basil. Didn't bother with measurements, just threw it together and it was great. Reminded me of a "meatless" and "noodleless" lasagne.

The dish was fabulous. Even better than I had hoped. My entire family loved it, which is saying a lot - two teenagers. I used garden tomatoes (sliced and drained), fresh garden herbs, and a whole package of pre-shredded 2% mozzarella (no cheddar). Will definitely make this again and again when zukes and tomatoes are plentiful in the garden!

DELISH!!!!  When I make dishes for the first time, I follow the recipe exactly; however, with this one, after reading other reviews, I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar and was not at all disappointed.  My fiancé is not a huge zucchini eater, but he liked this dish.  Will definitely make again.

This turned out very well. You can see by the lilst of ingredients that it will be a mild tasting casserole, so those who thought it tasted bland should have realized that before hand. I prefer spicy, but I don't have to have spicy food all the time. I did take someone's suggestion and use the 2C. of already cooked brown rice in the frig for the bottom layer. The original recipe calls for plum (Roma) tomatoes. If you use regular tomatoes which are juicier then you need to cut the tomatoes in half (around the equator) and squeeze the juice out or them. That will cut down on the moisture in the dish.

I added Thai basil and Greek oregano with Romano cheese and cheddar plus a whole onion.  It's like a party in your mouth soooo good

Great side dish!  Lots of flavor.  I used a mixture of cheeses and omitted the onion.  I also used gluten free planko bread crumbs that made for a delicious crunchy topping.  I will be making this often!
Variation: add a middle layer of sautéed spinach and mushrooms!

This is an out standing recipe! The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly. Since then I've added things like a layer of thinly sliced potatoes on the bottom, fresh pesto, panko crumbs on the top with a drizzle of olive oil for a little crunch. This recipe is a keeper for sure!

I made this last night for guests. Amazing! I used beefsteak tomatoes, fresh herbs, and mozzarella cheese as suggested. No leftovers! This is the first time I have rated a recipe.

We prepared this in a vegan modification using Daiya Cheddar cheese, Daiya Mozzarella (couldn't find Parmesan) and Panko bread crumbs for some of our vegan family.  We and they liked it a lot. We will do it again, adding a bit more of pepper.

Too watery. The flavors were good, however, tomatoes and zucchini have too much water content, even after draining excess liquid half way thru.

Very good! I have a bumper crop of zucchini in the garden, and we are lucky enough to have a local farm that has beautiful (early) tomatoes. I was worried that as written, it might be watery so I sliced and salted the zucchini and let them drain on paper towels, then grilled them to remove any remaining water. 
Also sliced and salted the tomato slices and drained on paper towels. Used mostly mozzarella (and the bits of assorted cheese I had on hand) Toasted panko with asiago and garlic for the topping. Didn't have to worry about leftovers! DH ate the whole dish! Thanks for sharing! :)

Good. Do read the reviews before making, as some are very helpful, like resting the slices of tomatoe on paper towels, to eliminate the extra juices.
The ingredients are good, but the recipe lacks dimension. Personally, I am going to play with this by changing up some ingredients. Thank You for sharing. The dish does make a colorful presentation, but do let it rest for awhile before cutting.

Wonderful!  I substituted a yellow squash for one of the zucchinis and followed the rest of the directions.  Although it seemed like it took more than 20 minutes to put this all together it was well worth the extra time!  I had guests over and everyone really liked this dish!  They all asked me to have a do over! Perfect!  Thanks Delta Queen 50!

Really good! I used fresh basil and oregano, and yellow squash instead of zucchini because that's what we had in the garden! Also added some eggplant cutlets from Trader Joes, cause I had some. Did single layer of each, in bigger rectangular pan.

I do a variation of this. Use olive oil instead of butter, minus the cheese (at least some of it) and use Italian seasons, I use the cherry tomatoes and steam in the oven. MMMMM

I followed the fresh herbs and the mozzarella suggestions and I added something else! I put cooked Italian sausage meat at the bottom to create a meal instead of a side dish. The spices in the sausage meat and its texture added a little twist! Delicious!!!

Just made it for the first time. I used my own garden veggies and it came out great. I was very generous with the cheese and also added some feta in the mix. Made more like 6 servings.

This was really good and really easy.  I used zukes from the farmer;s market and tomatoes from the garden.  The bread crumbs were from bread I had made.  It was even better as a leftover.  My husband asked me to save this recipe.  He really enjoyed it.

This was especially great for a light summer meal! For cheese, I used a mixture of parmesan, mozzarella and colby-jack. I used campari tomatoes, just making sure to squeeze out some of the liquid. I drizzled the crumb topping (delicious, by the way) with a little olive oil before it went into the oven. The leftovers are even better, especially with a glass of wine! Thanks for the delicious recipe, DELTAQUEEN50! UPDATE: Made with a zucchini and a summer squash because they needed to be used, and one tomato. Used all mozzarella cheese; did not combine the cheese mixture, just layered it all, including fresh basil and extra garlic. Very good and is great for a light lunch or dinner. UPDATE 7/12/18: Still layered, used jarred garlic, added garlic powder to crumbs (buttery round), fresh basil, drizzled lightly with garlic-infused olive oil.

This has been a huge hit every time I have made it.  I didn't change a thing unless being a little heavy handed with the cheese counts. LOL  This is a must try!  I have passed this on to many friends.

Delicious, and it works with crookneck squash too.  I substituted mozzarella cheese for the cheddar.

Very nice side dish, I used only 2 Roma tomatoes deseeded and drained quite a bit of liquid. I used a combination of cheeses using a yummy shredded fontina cheese, Parmesan and a bit of cheddar. There was a bit of excess liquid but did not affect the overall dish.

Whaaat?!  My kids (and husband) ate all their vegetables!  Yup, it's that good.  We had it as a main dish.  For substitutions, I used lots of fresh basil, a few heirloom tomatoes, yellow squash along with the zucchini, and green onions because that is what I had on hand.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Next time I make it, I'd like to use fresh oregano, as well.  And I think I'll try mozzarella cheese as other reviewers suggested.  Excellent way to use up summer squash and tomatoes.

Great spring/summer side dish.  I sliced and drained tomatoes in the am, and I did add salt to the tomato layer when assemblying.  Did not bother with the onion in the bread crumb mixture.  Really good & always gets great reviews.  Has anyone prepped this the day before?  Wasn't sure if it would get too soggy??

This recipe was a home run!  Personally, what I liked most about it was, I could actually taste the zucchini.   Most recipes mask or camouflage the flavor of zucchini, but not this one – which is why I liked it so much!  Having said that though, I did make a few modifications, just solely based on what I had available in my kitchen at the time:  I use a combination of Colby-jack, parmesan and Romano cheese, I used garlic Melba Toast for the bread crumbs, and probably more onion than what the recipe calls for (whatever a small onion equals).  Also, I used a generic Italian seasoning, thyme, and two Roma tomatoes.  I also drew out some of the moisture from the tomatoes and zucchini before using, as some other reviews suggested.  This will definitely become one of my ‘go to’ recipes!  Even my 11 yo daughter liked it!  ‘Nuf said.

My family loves this as a meal with bread.
I use Panko bread crumbs and fresh basil and oregano and think I will try mozzarella instead of cheddar.

Really awesome. My nephew is the only vegetarian in a house full of meat eating women. Poor guy. But he and I made this last night and even though we didn't have nearly enough cheese and Were only able to get through 1 1/2 layers of tomato, it was so good my sister took some for lunch the next day.

This is one of my favorite recipes! I add thinly slice new red potatoes to mine and it gives it a great added flavor.  I cook it covered at 400 for the first half hour to be sure potatoes and zucchini cook. I reduce heat to 375 for another 20 minutes with foil removed so the bread crumb topping browns nicely. My entire family loves this dish. I brought some into my job and for the next several weeks many of my fellow workers brought their dish in for all to critique! No one ever grows tired of this amazing low fat dish!

This Tomato Zucchini Casserole is smart, easy, flexible, and delicious. Perfect for times when zucchini and tomatoes are abundant. I especially appreciate that I can use different cheeses and don't really need to measure ingredients; just get it in the casserole pan, bake, and enjoy.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everybody LOVED it! Let's just say it will definitely be making a reappearance for Christmas dinner. I had to use a larger pan because I did not have a 9x9 and I found that there was way too much cheese left, and I only used about half of the bread crumbs. But, overall it was a big success! (:

I made this one Saturday night for a spur of the moment gathering and everybody loved it! I would eat this as a main course (I love squash- easily my favorite vegetable), but the recipe only makes enough to be a side dish for four people. Next time I make it I'm going to double the recipe. One thing though: I think when it calls for medium zucchinis, they are supposed to be much bigger than I can find at my local grocery stores. I got four zucchinis just to be safe. I also added a little garlic, and used lemon pepper panko, since I was out of regular bread crumbs. This is one of my favorites, and is now a staple recipe in my house hold. I would definitely recommend this one!

I have a garden full of zucchini so I wanted to find a recipe that will encourage me to eat it.  It was great! I will make this again for sure. I read the reviews first so I followed some adjustments.  I used moz and cheddar cheese and fresh basil.  I also added pepperoni. Next time though I will not add the bread crumbs.

Really good recipe!  Tastes pizza-ish. I used asiago cheese instead of cheddar, and actually only used about half of the total cheese called for in this recipe, and it was plenty cheesy enough. Will definitely be making this veggie casserole again!

This is absolutely delicious! I made it about a month ago and I made it every week since then! I didn't change a thing in the recipe although I did add a little bit to the baking time. My zucchini was sliced very thin but was still a little hard....AWESOME! Thanks so much for sharing!

This was absolutely delicious!  My only complaint was that it turned out a little watery probably because I decided to use the fancy style shredded parmesan instead of the cheap sprinkle kind.  Regardless, it tasted great!

We all loved this dish. Next time I may consider adding crumbled bacon to add a little more texture. The crumb topping was a nice texture complement to the softer consistency of the tomatoes underneath it, but I'm wondering if a little bacon might be even better thrown in there.

Delicious! I did not add the butter with the breadcrumbs due to the high fat content. Just sprinkled breadcrumbs over the final cheese layer and spritzed with olive oil spray.  Smelled amazing while cooking. What a great idea for using extra garden produce. Thanks for the base recipe.

Great side dish.  I used mozarella instead of cheddar since it was all I had on hand.  Next time I'll make it with cheddar.

The seasoning made all the difference. Classic Italian flavours that add a nice flair to zucchini. For a bunch of veggies, it was nice comfort food. I would even make this for my picky Italian father in law!

Very delicious! The zucchini was not overcooked and mushy and was about the right consistency. The only problem I had was that it was a little watery. Tomatoes and zucchini are both high moisture fruits, so next time I might see about adding a little cornstarch to the cheese mixture to see if that'll thicken the juice a little. My wife loved the crumb topping.

This was an awesome recipe.  I was needing something that I could do with my tomatoes before they went bad.  You can only eat so many salads! I will definitely be doing this again.  This could really be a great dish if you have a pizza craving, and I'm sure a lot more healthier, which is what I am looking for when searching recipes.

A great way to use up zucchinis and tomatoes. Tasted good and looked attractive too. It was also pretty easy to make, as well as being versatile. I made it to the recipe, but I feel I could have added all sorts of other things.

This recipe was fantastic! I added a layer of sliced button mushrooms and a layer of fresh spinach as well. I used 4 zucchinis and 5 roma tomatoes and for the vegetarians in the family, it was the main course. Everyone loved it!

Love this idea. However, I changed it a bit. I always use mozzarella cheese never cheddar! Also, I did not use the onions butter or bread crumbs. I also used canned diced tomatoes with chilies since I had no fresh here. It added a nice kick to this! So, I skipped the last step and used the canned tomatoes with chilies and it was FAB! A big hit here, my 2 year old loved it.

This recipe was pretty good. I made it for my party and everyone liked it. For my test, it was too runny. Next time I will follow the recommendation of letting the tomatoes sit and dry them out first. It has a great flavor of fresh herbs. I will make it again.

This is a favorite in ur family! I always use mozzarella instead of the cheddar. If I don't have fresh tomatoes, canned, drained tomatoes work great too. Very delish!

I use to make this without boiling the zucchini but it made it cook so much faster thanks for that tip.  I did pretty much smash the zucchini to oblivion to get excess water out and still had some liquid. But I will make this again as is or use as base for some of my own creations. If you like tomato and zucchini this recipe is for you!!

This was so good! My 4 year old gobbled it up. I used Zucc and Tomatoes from my garden. Did have an onion, so just put the bread crumbs on with butter. I used Colby Jack cheese since it was all I had. Next time I may try using less cheese to reduce the fat content, but it is delicious as is!

I completely forgot about cooking the onions and bread crumbs step... I ended up just sprinkling bread crumbs on top of the veggies. Think this probably made the dish healthier since there is no butter in it... This combination can hardly go wrong. Tasty dish.

Made this as written and took it to a cook-out today. It was a big hit with the women. The men....not so much... except for my son-in-law. He loved it!  
I think next time I'll add more fresh bread crumbs and onion and maybe a little less butter. I think some shredded Swiss might be yummy. Will definitely make it again.

We loved it!  I cut the recipe in half and wish I didn't--we ate the whole thing at once.  I used fresh basil and mozzarella but think any cheese would be great.  I found this really easy to make and delicious!  I've made this a few times and cut back on the butter to about 2 T. which is plenty.  This is CRAZY GOOD!!!

OH YEAH! Zucchini has never tasted this good! I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used canned diced tomatoes. Everything came out great!

My taste buds are still thanking me for making this dish last night.  (In fact, I ate leftovers for breakfast!)  Yum. Yum. Yum.  I doubled the garlic, doubled the zucchini, and used a little more cheese than called for (I used jack cheese).  And, I used a mandolin to slice the roma tomatoes and the zucchini, so it went together pretty quickly.  A good amount of liquid accumulated on the bottom of the casserole dish during baking, but I lifted the core casserole out of the liquid and placed it on a serving dish.  It was gorgeous.  It was delicious.  It was appreciated.  Thanks for the receipe!

This was wonderful!! Like others, I laid my tomatoes and zucchini out on paper towels so they could drain off excess liquids. I sprayed the casserole dish with oilve oil, and instead of the topping called for..I mixed a little italian bread crumbs and panko for the topping. Gave it a nice crunch and no butter.  Thanks  Deltaqueen..we will be making this a lot!!

Pretty good recipe. I halved it and added mushrooms, red onion instead of white, fresh basil instead of dried, used mozzarella instead of cheddar  and I cut out the bread crumbs.

This was a great recipe. Very tasty. A tad bit watery even after letting it sit for 10 mins. I just poured the water off and served it. Probably would be perfect over pasta. These were the mods I made: mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar; 1/2 cup fresh oregano; 1 cup fresh basil; and 1/2 cup onion. I just layered the cheeses and the spices because I was using block mozzarella instead of already shredded. Perfect!

The recipe is very easy and the dish turned out to be very tasty.  I used a little olive oil instead of butter and added a few squash.  I made my bread crumbs with 2 slices of wheat bread.  I will defiantly make this again experimenting with different veggies next time.

I took this dish to potluck at work and it was a hit!  So simple to make and easy to modify to your liking.  I added mozzerella cheese, and lots of it.  Can't wait until summertime to make this dish when we grill outside.

Great way to use our garden vegetables. I used beefsteak tomatoes and got the liquid at the bottom, which was perect to soak up with brown rice.  My favorite part was the topping. I used a dry loaf of rye bread and that added a delicious touch.

Needs more stars! Absolutely awesome. My company (whom I didn't know disliked tomatoes) ate two servings. The only change I made was to decrease the amount of tomato and zucchini (leave the amount of cheese the same) and bake in a 9"X7" pan. Yum-O!

This recipe is awesome!  You can vary the type of cheese, depending on what you have.  You can actually add more, or less cheese, also, depending on your taste.  I made this for a neighborhood potluck and everybody loved it.  I used firm Romas, and they were perfect (I didn't seed them).  If the dish is watery, it could be your tomatoes are adding too much liquid.  I came home from work last night and my neighbor greeted me at my front door with fresh zucchini and tomatoes from her garden and asked me to make another batch.  A very tasty dish that will make great use of your summer garden!!  It is definitley hearty and can be a great main dish with a salad and hot bread.

I had to use more cheese than the recipe called for. Also, there was a lot of watery stuff in the bottom of the pan. Maybe I didn't seed the tomatoes enough, but that made it somewhat unappealing to eat. It was okay, but I don't think I'll make it again.

This is fantastic. I made it exactly as written and the whole family loved it. It can get just a little watery on the bottom but this really is no big deal. I will make this all summer long and can't wait to try it out with other cheeses. Delicious! Thank you!

This was delicious, but to me a five star recipe should be very healthy as well, hence the 4 stars. Next time I would like to make the bread topping a lot less and use olive oil instead of butter. I did use reduced fat cheeses. My hubby liked it and he's not a fan of zucchini. My one year old liked it too.

Very easy to make and oh so tasty!  Mine was a bit watery but fine the next day.  I probably should have squeezed out more tomato liquid.  I left out the basil but the oreganto was still very good.  It was like pizza! My husband and I loved it; will make again.

Like some other comments this did taste a bit like pizza.  It was flavorful and the tomato and zucchini were fleshy and complimented each other nicely.  DID NOT need a side dish.  I didn't have any basil so I used Italian seasoning and it was a bit strong on the herbs.  Next time I will use the basil.

Great recipe!!  Everyone I have made it for has absolutely loved it!!  I add a little bit of extra cheese (about 2 cups) and use marble instead of cheddar.  I also use fresh basil and oregano and once I added fresh dill.
