VERY GOOD! I really loved the flavors of this burger. I did not have curry paste so I used curry powder which worked out great. I would add a bit more salt next time but that's my personal preference. This would be great topped w/ a curry mayo or tatziki (sp?) sauce. I will be making these again! Thanks for sharing.:)

My family accepts new dishes which makes for enjoying unusual recipes. I was dying to try the pork/curry/feta combination. For 1# of pork I got six smaller burgers. I wanted to start on the mild side so I used 2 Tbl of Thai green curry and used a ginger grater to 'mince' the ginger and garlic. Had no time to fire up the grill so I pan fried them. That was a mistake as the feta melted and stuck to the pan. I served them on above-average sandwich buns with rice and a stir-fry of onion patty pan squash carrots & sweet pepper. Everyone raved even my wife who isn't a big fan of pork. I'll be making it again soon & try it with red curry paste on the grill or broil them. Thank you WDawn for a truly refreshing recipe!-----Jimny

So delicious and different. Definitely a recipe for the adventurous adult burger palate. I used yellow curry paste and made the mix as written. Hubs grilled to perfection. We topped with sauteed onions and peppers in EVOO on onion buns. What a great summer grilling recipe and a nice change from traditional beef burgers for your next grill nite. Great recipe wdawn a definite do-over!

So. I had some leftover buns from Thanksgiving some leftover feta some aging cilantro and ground pork. "Not too promising!" I thought. Found this recipe and was intrigued. Never would have thought of combining pork curry and feta. Based on the other reviews--like me another reviewer made his first review about this item though I've used Allrecipes for years--I had to sign up to say DELICIOUS. "Boy we gobbled those down!" said my husband. He wants these to be in regular rotation. I subbed home-made curry powder for the paste and the cilantro turned out to be past its prime so I didn't use that but will next time--for there will definitely be a next time! Thank you for this great recipe WDawn!

This is one of my favorites. I've made it several times. I use curry powder instead of paste and skip the cilantro. My only question is how to cook them without them falling apart. They disintegrate on the grill and stick in the pan. Any tips?

Absolutely amazing when I first tasted it. But about a third of the way through the burger I got really tired of the flavors. Too intense maybe.

I gave this three stars but this may not be fair as I made changes out of choice and necessity. I used ground turkey instead of ground pork and I think that worked just fine. I used Thai red curry paste and when I tasted the paste it lacked the curry flavor I wanted so I added curry powder (a couple of teaspoons?) but would add more next time. I had to use ground ginger in a tube as I had no fresh. Though I used less than the suggested substitution rate the burgers ended up with a bit too much ginger flavor for me. Keep that in mind should you need to use this substitution. Finally I left out cilantro because I cannot abide it. If you grill these burgers you may want to keep the heat lower than you usually do. The cheese and curry paste caremalizes on the outside quite quickly. Still I will try this again with less paste more curry powder and fresh ginger. Well worth another try.

My entire family loved this including two eight year old boys. They were loaded with flavor. We piled on sautéed mushrooms onions and peppers with a little mayo on the bun. One reviewer noted something about not having enough salt. I found them to be a tad salty personally but maybe my curry paste had a higher sodium content or I had a saltier feta? My husband said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had.

Whole family gave it high praise. I used red curry paste because that's what I had and the recipe didn't specify. Worked well and we'll have them again. The kids opted for cheese on them I didn't think it was needed.

Made these in the oven as it is winter here. Used parsley in place of cilantro as I am one of those who can not abide it. Served with Spinach salad. Very tasty

Very good! Curry was a bit strong but I probably used too much.

This was an excellent burger! The flavors went together really well. Will definitely make these again and again. Can't wait to try them on the grill when the snow is gone.:-)

YUM. I had both Indian-style and Thai-style curry paste, so I did an “eeny-meeny-miney-mo” and ended up using the Indian one. I’ll have to try it with the Thai sometime as well. These burgers were just delicious, moist and flavorful.
