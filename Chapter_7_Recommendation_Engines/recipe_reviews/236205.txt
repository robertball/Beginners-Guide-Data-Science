This was an interesting combination. I was hesitant to try it, because I just don't care for much yogurt in a smoothie. 2 Tblsp to 1/4 cup maximum. The calories were also quite high, but figured I could split the servings. Either way, I tried the recipe as is but cutting the yogurt amount in half. I thought it had a pretty bright red color and actually tasted like a pb&j. I could taste the peanut butter. Then, for some reason, I tried it with the additional 1/4 cup of yogurt, as suggested, and it lost the peanut butter flavor and the red color turned to pale pink and making it a little more artificial looking. I would definitely try it with half of the amount of yogurt suggested. I liked the idea anyway.

Unusual combination for a smoothie.  It did give you a similar taste to the flavors in a peanut butter & jelly sandwich.   My husband was a fan because he loves peanut butter.  I thought it was just ok.  I prefer a fruitier tasting smoothie.   This is a very thick smoothie due to the yogurt, so, if you like it thinner you will need to add some additional milk or maybe some juice.   I did use splenda instead of brown sugar, but, other than that made exactly as the recipe stated.
