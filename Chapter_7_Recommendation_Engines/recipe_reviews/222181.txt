This was very tasty!  I think it relies too much on salt for the flavouring, but the rosemary is a nice balance.  If I do anything different next time I'll use panko instead of flour, and instead of using egg, will just use a little bit of melted butter!

This was very tasty, not to mention quick, easy, and healthy!  I also substituted gluten free flour and it worked beautifully. Definitely a keeper.

We fish for wild trout every year and just brought home 74 of them for our freezer.  Needless to say, I've tried many recipes for trout, but this one is the very best I've tried.  I did swap the flour for Panko, the egg for 1/4c melted butter, and I will use half the salt next time.  Delicious!  I will make this recipe many times! Thank you, Devin!

Amazing recipe it was so good. My fillets were large so I made extra pecan crust
and I only had fresh rosemary which I prefer. I washed the trout and dried well,
laid the fillets on a buttered foiled baking sheet skin side down, dusted the fillets with flour, brushed on the egg and then coated with pecan mixture. I baked them for 20 mins at 400 degrees. I will be making this again and trying it with pickerel.

I made this for my fiancé and it was a huge hit.  I actually did skin on fillets and I took the first persons advise by swapping out the flour or Panko and swapping the egg  for a mixture of butter and a little but of honey for some added sweetness.  I coated the trout with Panko then brushed on my butter mixture.  I just patted on the pecan blend I loaded it up.  We paired this with some couscous and it was a home run.  WHEN I make this again I will also add some asparagus or maybe some brusselsprouts to make this a complete the meal.

I tried this trout recipe for the first time. I made the following changes... used Panko + pecan + rosemary + 5 pepper seasoning + blackpepper.. made into small pieces in small food chopper. I used melted butter instead of egg as suggested by some other readers. Then I followed the baking time... 
Served this with garden salad + julienned radishes with cranberry and silvered almonds with honey mustard dressing...
Picture perfect...
Will be making this often..
Thank you very much Devin.

this was a great recipe, we had trout with skin, so put the skin side down, they were large pieces, I used 2 eggs, mixed panko & flour, also the idea to increase the pecans is good, and used my blender to finely chop the pecans, everyone really liked it, served with Caesar salad and steamed broccoli

I gave 3 stars only because it calls for too much salt. I would half the amount of salt and it would make the pecan crusted trout perfect. I will make it again though....

This was delicious! I didn't have any pecans on hand, so I used walnuts and still very good. Even my picky husband, who doesn't like walnuts, really liked it. Score!

Adding a little lemon juice once done made this a 4 star. Loved the flavour of the rosemary.

This was really good.  It was just a tiny bit on the salty side so next time I'll cut back on the salt a bit. Also, There was not enough crust so I'll make more of that next time as well.  I toasted my pecans before I used them which added to the depth of flavor.  Overall, a great base recipe.  Thanks Devin.

I followed the review recommendations and used panko instead of flour, and butter instead of egg. I also added parmesan. I used a baster to put the butter on and drizzled the panko then the seasoning mix. I hate dirtying extra dishes!!! Came out GREAT!!

Great basic nutty blend!  I used butter to coat the fish, no egg or flour and my husband and I loved it.  Kids were not as thrilled, but didn't complain.  (One isn't a nut fan.)

This was a hit! The pecans made it so nice, the fresh rosemary is a must, throw out the sprigs when done if you wish but do not leave them out for this one to work. Thanks so much for sharing this fantastic recipe!

So tasty! I also used Panko instead of flour and used fresh rosemary, which I might even increase next time. I salted and peppered the fillet before dredging, so it would have the right amount of seasoning. I only added a small amount of salt to the Panko.  We loved this! So easy and quick. My fillet was very large so it took about  20 minutes to bake. I will use this recipe again!

This is a really great recipe and it was so easy to make. I  followed the instructions but used panko instead of flour, butter instead of egg and fresh rosemary. I also didn't have any pecans so subbed it with walnuts. It tasted great regardless. My hubs really loved it as well. I made three filets and had two of them :-) with sautéed green beans and portobello mushrooms.

SO easy and everyone loved it. Even the kids! I made several of the changes suggested in other reviews. I used more pecans, in the food processor. Half the salt. Brushed on melted margarine instead of egg. I didn't have panko, so I used half flour and half italian bread crumbs. My trout had skin on one side, but it was easy to slide the fish off of it, once cooked. Enjoy!

Like others, I lowered the salt, used (nonfat) margarine, crushed the pecans very small, added the dry margarine, half a lemon and watched the trout in the oven very carefully.

We caught these trout yesterday, and they were simply delicious and just needed a nice salad as a side (that doesn't mean we had a small bowl of non-fat yogurt later!

Will I make it again. One of the best recipes I've tried with fresh caught trout.

This is my favourite fish recipe now... and I've tried quite a few! This is delicious - I decreased the salt and served with some lemon slices. So simple and soooo good.

Excellent. I didn't have Rosemary so I used tarragon and only used a  1/2 tsp of salt

I loved it!  I had to use cashews because I did not have any pecans on hand.  I'm not a regular user of rosemary but it made a huge positive difference in the taste.  I used butter rather than eggs and no flour.  The flavor was amazing.  No more boring trout.

Pretty good recipe, although I think the crushed pecans I got weren't crushed finely enough and it was difficult to make sure the fish got coated with the other ingredients as well. Still had a good flavor and texture. I'll definitely try this again.

Loved it! Used a little less salt and add a bit of lemon pepper.

Very good but way too salty.  I suggest using 1/2 the listed amount.

Delish and easy! Even my 12 year old loved it! Used a rolling pin to crush the pecans! Next time I'll use half the salt and double the pecan mixture.  Thanks for a great recipe!

So good! I used whole wheat flour and it was just as delicious.  Don't be expecting a crunchy, fried fish type of coating.  But it is nice, nutty, and delicious! I may decrease the salt next time.

Wonderful!! We had an untraditional Thanksgiving by cooking this trout. We served it with cheese/creamed cauliflower & mushroom rice, green beans and creamy coleslaw.mmmm
Everyone raved and wanted the recipe, and we didn't feel stuffed
like we usually do with turkey

Very good. Was surprised at how good the rosemary worked with it. We had several small brook trout fresh from the river.  I baked them whole and had  to bake  them a couple of minutes longer because of the thickness.  My husband was delighted with the taste.  I'll be saving this recipe.

I really liked the recipe and found it to be quick and easy! I did find the recipe to be a bit salty but will adjust this next time. Will make again!

An easy way to have a wonderful meal for guests and also replace scrumptious home cooking for going out for fish. Very, very good!  We have done this to speckled trout and redfish now.
