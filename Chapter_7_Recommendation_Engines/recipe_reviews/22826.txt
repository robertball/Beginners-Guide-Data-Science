I don't bake a lot of bread, but I thought I would give this a try. I followed the recipe exactly and got a really tasty and fresh bread with a nicely balanced cheese flavor throughout. The loaf lasted about 4 days just wrapped in cling film on the counter. We cut from it as needed. It went well with several meals I cooked that week. It really mixes well with soups. We had a buttered slice with both Corn Chowder and French Onion. If you are afraid of baking bread, try this recipe. It's easy and it works!

This bread is so tasty and so easy to make. It is very different from other yeast bread recipes (more of a batter than a dough and the resulting loaf looked more like a quick bread than a regular yeast bread). I cut the recipe in half to make one loaf and used 1 and 3/4tsp of yeast. Also I heated the milk in the microwave for 30 seconds so that it was slightly warm, used margarine instead of butter, and baked for 40 minutes. If you like romano cheese then you will love this bread because it is so cheesy tasting. It also makes terrific toast.

Won't blame it all on the yeast (expiration Dec 2011) ...but following the recipe only produced 2 very dry, low-rise loaves.  The aroma and color of finished bread was good -- but very disappointed in the end result.  Yes, it's cheesy -- but doubtful I'll make it again.

I have never rated a reciped before because even if I didn't like it, it was just a flavor thing.  This bread (if you can even call it that) was inedible.  A waste of good ingredients.  I bake bread a lot and have never tasted anything so bad!!

I liked the bread.. it is a batter bread rather than one you'll knead so it has a different texture. I added some Italian seasonings and a bit more salt as I felt it needed a bit of help. I baked one loaf and the rest as muffins

This is a recipe for an Italian Easter cheese bread.  If you not Italian or if you don't like romano cheese,  you may not appreciate this kind of bread.  I love this recipe. It's easy, authentic, and so tasty. We eat it with thinly sliced  salami. A local grocery store by me sells one of these loaves for $18.00 and mine tastes better.  Of course I'm making it again for 2019 Easter.

I made it and it was rather easy except the milk part. And I have a question: How much yeast should you use if you are using canned yeast?
