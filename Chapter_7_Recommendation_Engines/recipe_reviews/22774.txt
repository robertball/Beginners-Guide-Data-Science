Great flavor, very sweet! A few notes: Cook to a temperature of about 240 for a chewy caramel; make sure NOT to use a non-stick saucepan; also make sure to grease the pan--cooking spray works great.

All that sugar, butter, cream to waste!
I followed the recipe exactly, heated to 250 degrees and my caramel ended up rock hard.  I bent two spatulas and a knife trying to get it out of the pan (which was HEAVILY buttered).  The best part was when I was man-handling the candy to get it out of the pan and the caramel CUT me!
Tip:  Do NOT heat this to 250, follow the other reviewers and heat to 240 or less.

Wonderful!  I made these for Christmas and got rave reviews.  I cooked the mixture to about 238 deg. and it's chewy, but doesn't get stuck in your teeth.  It's a little hard to remove from the pan.... make sure you coat the pan well w/ butter or spray.

After reading everyones reviews, I cooked only till 238 degrees and lined my pan with parchment paper and greased the paper well..had no problem lifting out the entire square (leave an overhang of parchment paper so this can be done with ease), peeling off the paper and cutting the squares with a greased knife.

Perfect! I boiled it to 250 on the dot. They turned out great, chewy but firm enough to wrap easily. Also I used one of those foil cookies sheets that come in sets of 2 and are about $1.20 to pour the caramels into. It made everything simpler, and I didn't have to worry about scratching my pan.

I was optimistic in making these but was somewhat disappointed with the results.  First of all, I had to dump my mixture into a large pan because a medium pan was way too small.  The mixture would have boiled over.  Second, it took FOREVER to get the mixture to heat up. I finally heated it up to 255 or so.  When it cooled, it was hard as a ROCK!  Definitely butter the 8X8 dish....it's needed.  I couldn't cut the caramel so I put it in a bag and beat it with a hammer (I know that probably sounds funny).  The little chunks it made were good but hard.  I probably would not make this again.

I didn't know caramel candies could be so easy!  Much easier than other recipes-- and more successful too!  I didn't have whole milk so I tried 1% instead.  They still turned out wonderful!  Thanks for an easy recipe!

These are decadent!  I had some issues with my candy thermometer, but I cooked it to about 250.  I poured the mixture into a greased 8x8 pan.  If  I do it again, I will definitely line  the pan with parchment or teflon coated foil.  Once the squares were cut, I stuck them in the fridge for a few minutes, then wrapped them in 3" squares of waxed paper.

These are easy and delicious. Make sure you use a large enough pan, at least a 3 qt sauce pan, because when the sauce boils, it increases in volume quite a bit.  We used both a candy thermometer and the cold water method.  I don't think you want to go all the way to the hard ball stage if you want chewy caramels.  We used the soft ball stage, which was 252 on our thermometer.  We also lined the 8X8 pan with wax paper, letting it hang over the sides of the pan, for easy removal of the candy.  A pizza cutter was handy for cutting the candy once we had cut it into strips with a knife.

Around 244 is going to be a nice soft caramel, 244 - 250 will be a caramel with good chew to it. Anything above that is going to start getting you into a hard crack division. DON'T GIVE UP or brand this recipe badly, try it a few times and you may get better results.

Remember if you do not have a candy thermometer, use a glass of cold water to test the candy. If it dissolves it isn't ready. If it forms to soft ball and you can roll it with your fingers...ready. Hard crack is when it immediatly is stiff. Be careful, when you get close to the temp. to remove quickly. I have tried twice and it was hard the first time. Perfect the second time.

After having issues with two different Martha Stewart recipes for caramel I just about  gave up. I had promised my son caramel on Christmas and that's what kept me trying. I finally found this recipe and said what the heck might as well. 
Not only did this recipe take a quarter of the time to cook, but the color is amazing as well. The other caramels didn't set but this was well on it's way to setting within minutes. Thank you so much! I let it set on the spoon so I could assess the flavor (quality control you know lol) and much to my delight it was amazing! Better than Martha Stewart's recipe by far. Thank you for helping me not break a promise to my son and for sharing such a wonderful recipe!!! P.S. I cooked it until it reached 125 C and it turned out perfect. Nothing wrong with this recipe at all.

Amazing, simple, and delish! My first attempt at any sort of candy and it got RAVE reviews from everyone. Thanks!
Hint: Start with your biggest pan to avoid changing pans two times! (I didn't know how much it expanded when it cooked, LOL!)

YUM!  Super easy.  I don't own a candy thermometer (yet!) and just waited for the soft ball stage.  I didn't wait quite long enough, so my carmels are pretty droopy.  But they taste great!

This is an absolutely deliscious caramel. I have given it to about 10 friends already and they ask for more. If you want THE best flavor out of them add a cap each of coconut and orange flavoring. I'm making them right now. Sweet!

This was my first time making caramel, and the results were outstanding!  I used 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp french vanilla extract, most because I really like the french vanilla flavor.   I cooked the caramel to 240. Be sure to line your dish with parchment paper - the block of caramel will lift out without any problem. The caramel is chewy (but not sticky) and can be easily cut with a sharp hot knife.  I can't wait to experiment with flavors and add-ins!

Mine didn't turn out. How long does it take to cool. I cooled it overnight then put it in the fridge and tryed to cut it and it was mushy at the bottom... I'm disappointed but maybe I did something wrong...

Yummmeeeeeee! These were so delish, great buttery caramel flavor. I did sub an extra cup of brown sugar for the white sugar, I like a really rich flavor. My candy thermometer was on the blitz so I did the water drop test and took them to the hard ball stage. They were still soft and chewy yet not stuck to your teeth.

These were delicious - perfect. They tasted just like my grandmas recipe!! I poured mine out onto a cookie sheet with a lip on all sides to cut flat, square shaped caramels. Like others have said - take it off the heat at 240! They are perfect then. Make sure you recruit someone to help you wrap these up - that part took forever!! We used red colored saran wrap and placed them on a green tray, very cute.

I made over 300 of these bad boys andit took forever to cut and wrap, but it was worth every moment of the process. They turned out perfect. I was only able to heat that much up to 240 deg. but cooked it a little longer untill it formed a rigid ball. 
   I ended up also making them into caramel lolly-pop and disks! If you are reading this know that if you bring the temp up to the 265 area it will get to be more of a hard candy when cooled.

I bought a good new candy thermometer to try this. After reading reviews and doing a little online research I cooked until 246-247 - the suggested temperature for caramels and tested as a firm ball stage in cold water. They hardened much more as they cooled - not the soft caramel I wanted. I ended up with darker brown flecks throughout - maybe the butter burned. A medium sized heavy pot (All Clad) almost boiled over early on. I left the heat at a medium level throughout. They taste okay, more of a hard candy that gets a little soft in your mouth and then sticks to your teeth -  not what I wanted.

I took this recipe to 239*F and it came out wonderful.  Drizzle a bit on ice cream before pouring the rest into the dish to cool.  Also, I only had 1/3 C of corn syrup, so substituted 2/3 C Honey and it came out amazing!

I should have read the reviews first.  I too cooked it to 250 degrees and it was so hard.  I am not giving up on it.  I will try one more time because they taste really good.

For easy cutting, line your pan with with parchment paper; just lift the parchment paper out, cut into strips with a good pizza cutter, and use a knife for sizing into pieces. I double the recipe and use a jelly roll pan. Also, definitely get a good thermometer (boil water and make sure it reads 212F) and definitely boil candy to just over 250F.

Melt in your mouth wonderful. I cooked the caramel to a temperature of 244 degrees.  I made the recipe exactly as stated except for the temperature.  I will be making these several times a year, as my family and friends love these.

I love this recipe just like my moms caramels!!! I also did not heat it to 250, but I did use margarine instead of butter which also helps it to not stick to the pan or the knife.  I did put it in the fride for an hour to firm it up enough to cut... Very good I plan on making it again!

I made some changes, I used half&half, 3% milk, and heavy whipping cream, instead of whole milk and heavy whipping cream. I also heated the caramel to 240, like a review said.  It didn't harden!!  I left it there for a week, and when I finally gave up, and now it is still sitting in my fridge,  just waiting to be poured over ice cream.  I give this 1 star because it makes a very good topping.  Next time I will follow the recipe EXACTLY! I hope this is helpful.

The caramels were great, but not because I followed the recipe. I give the recipe 0 stars, but the caramels I made with the ingredients 5 stars. Heat only until 235ish, or use the cold water test. Also, it took about 50 minutes, not 20 minutes.

I made this today and it turned out great! To the previous reviewer, make sure your thermometer is good, because a few degrees make a big difference. The weather here in Ohio is very cold, but I had the kitchen door open to cool the kitchen off. The mixture took quite a while to get to 238 degrees.

I've made this twice. First time I only heated the caramel to 238. It was good, but too soft. The second time I heated it to 247. Chewy, Gooey and sticks to your teeth, Perfect. WARNING: You really should double the recipe as the caramel will disappear fast. :)

I have to agree with all other comments about heating to 240 degrees.  This is the most buttery delicious caramel candy, I could eat myself sick!  It's also great on pop corn!

This is the second time I’ve made this and this time I added toppings like course sea salt to one third, pecans and peanuts to one third and left a third plain for my picky children lol this is such an easy recipe, I got it to 250 degrees then poured into my dish.  It’s nice and chewy but not too sticky!  We love it!

The taste was perfect, however it didn’t come together and ended up in two different parts, solid and syrup, but that was most likely my own fault.

I made it and it came out amazing! I cooked to 250 or 251. It was hard-enough to shatter when I dropped a piece, but perfectly chewy too! Definitely impressed me!

I followed the recipe exactly, ended up being rock hard. Had to put my pan in the oven at 200 for a while to get it soft again, then scooped it out into a trash can and stayed up until 11 scrubbing the rest off. Definitely don't go up to 250, or it will be rock hard and impossible to eat. I THINK it tasted okay, though.

The thing many people fail to account for, is candy thermometers are subjective.  If you bought one at the grocery store for $3, you got what you paid for.  I always test mine each year. Easy.  Put it in boiling water and see what it registers.  Very easy then to adjust since, duh, water boils at 212.    IF you are at sea level.  Very few of us are actually at sea level I'm a mile high, so I adjust accordingly, but even those 2-3000 ft elevation need to adjust and account for that.

A large pan and a candy thermometer is required for this recipe. I had to change pans twice and still wound up with caramel all over the stove top when the candy boiled over, so a large pan is absolutely necessary. I replaced the corn syrup with a corn syrup substitute (water and sugar) and they turned out great. I heated them to about 245f or so, but don't go any higher than that or they may get too hard. I also used parchment paper to line my pans. The finished caramels made great Christmas presents. Soft and chewy, but also a little prone to getting sticky when room temperature.
