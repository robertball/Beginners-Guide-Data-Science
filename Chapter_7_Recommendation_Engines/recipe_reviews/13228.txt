My whole family loved this recipe with a few minor adjustments.  I pureed half the soup to thicken it, I used 2 cans of chicken broth and a 1/4 cup dry sherry, I added a canned chipotle, chopped for a smokey flavor and also added a touch of dried oregano for a flavorable soup.

Almost no flavor and way TOO much water.  1/2 the water would be enough with more spices!

This soup is way too watery. It had absolutely no flavor. It should have been made with only half the water. I would suggest using a dry chili seasoning mix instead of the cumin. You can add to your own taste. It is sold in mild, medium and hot. The soup was much too thin. Thickened up, and seasoned properly, this will be great! You can even add some cooked white rice to thicken it up. It would be more filling, too!

The base recipe is great. These adjustments worked well for me: substituted vegetable broth for the water, and only used about two and a half cups of it - I like a thick puree. I'd definitely recommend adding some salsa (1/2 - 1 cup) for some extra flavor when adding the beans. Topped it off with a little sour cream and some green onions. With some tweaking you can get some great flavors out of this soup!

It was a bit bland to start with.  I added a bit of mexican blend cheese and crushed tostitos to liven it up.  Tasty!

I wish I had read the reviews prior to making this. Way too much water. It was soooo thin when I started to  puree it I discarded 2 1/2 cups of liquid and it was still too thin. There are better recipes out there.

This recipe called for too much water--about 4 cups was good.  I would also suggest adding some chili powder.  Otherwise very tasty.

The amount of water seems to be excessive.  I used 4 cups (vs 7) and it was still watery.  I recommend using 3 cups.  Additionally, I used 1 tsp of cumin.

This was awful!  It needs vegetable broth instead of water -- and half as much at that!  More spices, particularly cumin.

This soup is TOO watery for Bean Soup.  Start with 2 cups of water and add as needed.  Add a bit more cumin and some chili seasoning if you like a fuller flavor.  I had to add rice to thicken it up.  All in all, this isn't a bad recipe; you just have to make a few adjustments to suit your taste.  It is easy with common ingredients which makes it a good beginner recipe.
Thanks!

This is way too much water for this soup.  I normally read reviews before I start cooking, but didn't this time.  I wish I would have!  This was way too watery and too plain.  I had to try to tweak it, but without much success.

Finally, I found a recipe that makes you wish you had made a double batch.  This recipe is just as good if not better than the soup I had in an authentic Mexican restaurant.  I decided to make it myself since it is a rare item to find in most Mexican restaurants.

This makes a great vegan black bean soup if you use vegetable stock instead of water. I had to cut the water down to 2 1/2 cups to get anything but a put of liquid, but otherwise, this was a great recipe. It tastes even better if you add some salsa when you put the beans in, the more flavorful, the better. I used some spicy garlic salsa and it was wonderful!

Im not sure how many stars to give this one "as is"?  I didn't try the base recipe after reading the other reviews.  I did tweak it based on what I had in the pantry and it turned out AWESOME!  What I did:  Use base recipe and add: 1 1/2 red bell pepper (omit green pepper), add 1 can butter beans to the 2 cans black beans, 3 cups chicken broth (omit water), 1 tsp chipotle seasoning, 1/4 tsp cumin, salt to taste.  Pulsed it briefly in the blender just to break everything up, but not puree it.  Added 2 1/2 cups cooked brown rice after I put it in the blender to keep the rice in tact.  Served with dollop of sour cream and green onions!  It was delish...5 stars!   I agree that this is an excellent base recipe.  Add your own spin on it!

The basics are great for this recipe, but like everyone else said, the recipe calls for far too much water and needs more spice.  I only used one cup of water, added a ton of different spices like cayenne, cumin, pepper, oregano, onion powder and garlic powder.  We added cheese and ate with tortillas.

A good basic recipe but it did need much less liquid and more flavoring in my opinion.  I used chipotle powder and oregano in addition to the cumin and garlic (added the spices to the saute, not to the liquid) and only 1 cup of liquid for 1 can of beans - I would use a ratio of 1 cup chicken broth: 1 can of beans next time I make this.  This soup is really good served with a dollop of sour cream.

There are much better recipes out there; this needs a major intervention to get any kind of flavour...a ridiculous amount of water called for in this recipe.

I was looking for easy black bean soup and this wasn't bad, with a few modifications. I used a 4 oz. can of diced green chilies instead of the bell pepper, diced garlic out of the jar, and 2 cups of chicken broth and another cup of water. I didn't do the cumin because not a big fan but the chillies gave it a nice spice. Also, used my stick blender to puree just enough. Not sure if I needed the cup of water, though, probably will skip the next time.

This is an easy and tasty recipe for a quick black bean soup.  I used 6 cups of chicken broth instead of 7 cups of water, I also added a bit of cayenne pepper.  Very satisfying, a definite keeper!

Way way way too much water. This is essentially onions and beans. I boiled it for almost 45 minutes, added corn starch, nothing helped. I put it in the refrigerator for the next day and the water separated from the beans, so I poured it off. I ate the "soup" that was left with cheese and sour cream. Good, but I could have just served myself a can of black beans and saved myself the trouble.

This is an easy and savory soup. I wouldn't change it a bit except that I add 1/2 tsp of chili powder. It gives it a rich, smoky flavor.

I read the reviews before making this soup and reduced the amoung of water from 7 cups to 2 cups. It was still too watery and very bland. I needed too many modifications to salvage this recipe. So may modifications that the final recipe looks nothing like the original recipe.

I followed a lot of the suggestions of the others who reviewed this recipe and my soup turned out yummy!  I imagine following the actual recipe may have been a disaster.  Here are my substitutions:

Instead of green pepper, I used 1 jalapeno and about 1/4 red pepper.  I didn't have cumin, so I used 1/2tsp curry powder instead.  I also added 2 carrots to the pot at the same time I added the beans and water.  And I only used 4 cups of water.

The recipe is a good base if you have nothing else to go off of (like I didn't) and this is a super easy soup to make, especially when you only have a few random scraps of food left in your cupboard. :)

I love this recipe but instead of all the water I used 32 oz of veggie broth. Plus I put one can of black beans in the blender to add substance.

This bean soup was great!  I am a 25 y/o male and not very good at cooking. I was able to follow the easy directions. I added carrots to the soup also. I also think you should season as you go I noticed my soup was weak before I simmered. So I added season intill i felt it was enough. I want to thank you for your recipe I had a great meal tonight and look forward making it again Thank you

I also didn't add all the water.  In fact, I added 1 can of beef broth as we like a thick pureed soup.  I also garnished it with a dollop of sour cream and chopped green onion.  My husband really liked it.  Gail

fantastic, i doubled the cumin in it, wary that my 8 year old would probably hate it, and was shocked to discover he loved it.  a regular in my kitchen from now on.

This was great with a few improvements. I added mushrooms to the saute and used chicken broth instead of plain water. YUMMMY!!

I'm glad I read others' reviews before making this.  I've had better & prefer spicier, but my husband liked it, & it's healthy & inexpensive to make, so I'll be making it again.  I substituted just 2 cups of chicken broth for all that water & substituted 1/2 packet of mild chili seasoning instead of the other spices.

Way too much water and very bland. Not sure the beans should be pureed. Would NOT make again.

Great base.  I also used about 3 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water and sherry as recommended by another review and it was great.  Topped with a little sour cream and cheese....yummy!

Like others, I think this recipe is a great starting point. I particularly like it because I don't have to soak the beans. I used chicken broth instead of water for a richer flavor. I also added oregano, sherry and instead of green pepper I used Jalapenos! I garnished with sour cream and jack cheese and chopped green onions and cilantro. Better day 2 as are most soups! Good recipe for using pantry ingredients when you don't want to go to the store.

Best base recipe for black bean soup I could find. I agree with other posters that 7 cups of water would be way too much, so I used 2 cups of vegetable broth, and threw in the liquid from the can with the beans, rather than rinsing and draining them. I skipped the green peppers, and added a 10 oz can of diced tomatoes with green chiles when I put in the beans and the broth. I used considerably more cumin, 4 generous shakes, 2 shakes of chili powder, a shake each of garlic powder and onion powder, and a little dried cilantro. I pureed a little over half the soup. I garnished it with a little sour cream, but it would have been equally good without it. Green onions, fresh salsa, or shredded cheese would also be good garnishes with this soup if you like to experiment. This turned out better than any black bean soup I've gotten in a restaurant.

the first time i made this, it was fabulous ... but i can't remember if i followed some of the suggested modifications.  second time i made it ... it was watery.  would definitely use a broth instead of all the water next time.  maybe cut down the liquid in general.  definitely more garlic and cumin - but my family loves those.

I read the reviews - I agreed with amount of water is excessive, so I used 3 cups instead of 7 cups.  I added some flavors such as chili powder, cilantro, or/and chicken/vegetable broth/cube.

Christmas must start with black bean soup. Why..no idea. I used chicken stock in place of water, added a couple of tomatoes and skipped the green pepper; more a case of have and have not.  It's delicious and I can envision it spiced up for a different taste. Love it.

I increased the number of servings. I used 4 cans of black beans and 8 cups of chicken broth instead of so much water. Its very important to drain and rinse the canned beans. I also used a heaping tablespoon of cumin and about 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. It turned into a thick consistency with a deep seasoned taste. A hit in this house!

this really is a great recipe...i like my puree thick as well....therefore i only used three cups of water or vegetable broth....and if you are in the process of making it, just add more black beans....it is especially good if you leave some whole beans in there. i am the kind of person that likes to add everything to soups and substitute things...so i substituted the green pepper for about 1 cup of small sweet red peppers, and added 1 cup chopped carrots,1/2 cup of chopped celery...2 tsp. of chili powder, 1tsp. of Mrs. dash table blend a dash of garlic powder and a dash of hot sauce........try it .....it tastes great!!!!!!!
