I did change a few things but not much at all. i had to use dark skinless, boneless chicken...sent the husband to the store and that is what he brought me :/. i placed foil over the dish for the first hour and when i removed it i stirred it a little but not much, just enough to stir in the onion packet and move things around. i used cream of chicken with mushrooms because i like mushrooms. i would have put fresh mushrooms in it if they had been on sale and plan to next time i make it. i added my own seasonings besides pepper but i didnt add salt since canned soups are typically salty enough for my taste. the chicken was very tender. i put more than 3 cups of water in the dish i am sure, just rinsed the two soup cans out and i didnt have to add more at any point. 

i think this would be a great recipe for someone just learning to cook for their family because it is easy and you can add things to it and experiment with flavors. 

i do not know the need of giving an opinion and messing with the rating when you have not made the dish. i look to the reviews for great tips and tricks to make things better or even for things to avoid. I hate olives but i dont go to recipe to recipe rating recipes with olives as 1 star because i think they are horrible and deserve a low rating...i just dont try the recipe and move on.

This was very tasty and easy!  The chicken was moist and the rice was cooked through.  The only change I would make would be to mix the soup, onion soup mix, and water together first, then pour over.

I used 3 cups of water with chicken bouillon.  I also cut the chicken breast in half.  When I make this again, I will cut the rice amount probably in half ... there was a lot rice with this dish when I used 2 cups.  All in all, it was good.

The layer of cheese and chicken over the uncooked rice prevented the rice from cooking evenly.  I had to remove the chicken after an hour and pour boiling water over the rice, stir, and bake another 1/2 hour without the chicken on top. The chicken did not need that long to bake. I would also recommend using salt and pepper on the chicken instead over the rice and cheese.
Next time, I would pour the water over the rice before adding the chicken, season the chicken, and use a well seasoned homemade "cream of" without the onion soup mix.

Don't add the extra salt, it isn't needed.  The rice turns into more of a risotto, which isn't a bad thing.  My rice hating husband HATED this.  Super props to having everything raw and 'dumping' into a casserole dish, instead of having to precook and THEN bake, which is why we hate casseroles.  Used extra sharp cheddar and ommited salt, otherwise, didn't change anything.  This is extremely heavy, so don't be surprised if your family doesn't eat as much as they normally do.

loved this recipe.  Made recommended changes and added lots of stuff since I was trapped inside due to snow storm.  I used chicken broth (3 cups) in place of water, I mixed the dry soup with the broth, rice (jasmine) and water also added shredded carrots, chopped celery tops and fresh mushrooms to the rice.  put the cheese next than chicken which I sliced each half breast in half the long way.  topped the chicken with the can soup followed by fresh chopped parsley.  After the hour I topped with crumbled bacon and saut√©ed chopped onion on top of the remaining cheese and a little more fresh chopped parsley.  I would actually cook this again with out the chicken.

I made this with four halved, thawed, boneless, skinless chicken breasts  and jasmine rice.  I followed the directions as described except used only one can of cream of potato soup.  I used 3 cups of chicken stock instead of the water and sprinkled only about half of the onion soup mix on top in case the flavor/salt was overpowering.  Baked at 350 degrees with foil covering and just after an hour took it out to sit for a few minutes before serving.  All was cooked through with the stock absorbed and the chicken tender.  A comforting, filling dinner and yummy leftovers the next day.

Loved this recipe!! So easy too! I had to change the cream of chicken soup to cheddar cheese soup because that's all I had on hand. Now I only use cheese soup. And a couple times I was out of onion soup mix so I just added some dried minced onion and some crushed red pepper/ground black pepper and garlic instead. Still came out great! I've made this several times and my husband absolutely loves it!

Just  tried this recipe tonight.  I added some diced onions on top of the rice/cheese layer and then also seasoned the chicken breasts with pig in a polka seasoning.  It turned out wonderful - I will make this again

So I used brown rice and it is not instant.... HUGE mistake. I fallowed the instructions for the most part, but i didnt have shredded cheese just sliced, and i didnt have onion soup. so i put the rice in then a layer of sliced cheese, and we cut up our chicken breast so i layered that next. Instead of onion soup i added bullion and spices to the water, and cream of mushroom soup with the cream of chicken soup. it has been baking for 3.5 hours and the rice is still not done. next time ill be cooking the rice ahead of time.

My daughter and I love this recipe.  She suggested cutting the chicken breasts into bite size pieces and just mixing it all together and I throw in some broccoli as I'm always looking for one dish dinners.  Turns out delicious every time

This is delicious. I changed the method because all I had on hand was instant rice. I boiled the chicken in lightly salted water and used the broth in place of the 3 cups water called for. I did not add extra salt because the broth was salted. I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom. I pulled the chicken off the bone in big chunks and mixed everything together then put it in the crock pot until it was bubbly and the liquid was absorbed, about 30 minutes, then I put the cheese on top. Next time I will use regular rice and follow the cooking instructions. Seems like it would be a good crock pot recipe too.

Good and easy. Next time, though, I will add a little more chicken and rice. The packet of soup mix made it a little too salty for me.

I  made this as a quick, easy dinner when I had a sick kid and few groceries. I only had one can of cream of chicken soup so I substituted with about 8 oz of sour cream. I was out of onion soup mix so I used a little bit of seasoning salt and garlic powder. I wisked all of this with 3 cups of warm water. I had already preheated a cast iron dutch oven before I put in 2 cups of rice and the soup mixture. I added about 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup of shredded cheddar and stirred. On top I placed 4 boneless chicken breasts and sprinkled a little more seasoned salt. After 50 minutes in a 350 degree oven I stirred the rice, flipped the chicken and sprinkled another 1/4 to a 1/2 cup of cheese. I put it back on for another 10 minutes. Everything came out moist and flavoful.  I would love to add mushrooms, onions, and broccoli to this in the future. a good, hearty weeknight dinner.

Definitely use the chicken broth instead of the water for extra flavor, and I added about 1 1/2 cups of mushrooms and they added some great flavor.   I upped the temp 10 degrees and it cut cooking time to an hour, chicken was moist and delicious!
