Awesome and super easy!  I can't wait to give these away for Christmas.  I've made one batch, and I intend to make 2-3 more.  A few tips, definitely cover your baking sheet with foil before making these.  I even sprayed a little cooking spray on the foil -- not sure if it helped or not.  And as other reviewers have said, stir the nuts halfway through the baking time.  Also, I found I didn't need nearly a full cup of sugar to coat the nuts at the end.  I just sprinked some on, stirred and kept adding a little sugar until I felt the nuts were coated enough.   It seems a little scary when the nuts first come out of the oven because there is a lot of gooey syrup, but just keep stirring and adding a little sugat at a tim, and the nuts will seperate well and not be sticky.

WOW! Made these yesterday, THEY ARE INCREDIBLE! The orange flavor is a refreshing change from the "ordinary" candied walnuts I usually make, and I like the fact these are made in the oven instead of on top of the stove. I'm making more for gifts, Thanks for a real Keeper!

I made these as a gift for our board members and one of the wives called me and said she has received these as a gift before but these are the best she has ever tasted.  They are so fast and easy.  I already have requests for more.  BIG HIT ! THANK YOU

I made these for Thanksgiving, although my 9-year-old niece did most of the work. she recommended the 4-star rating because the taste is good, but the dipping was time-consuming, and I concur. be sure to use a rimmed baking sheet. We didn't and the coating ran over the sheet and into the oven. Otherwise, great recipe that i would make again. (p.s. we did not sprinkle the sugar on at the end b/c of of our preference,  and they were plenty sweet.) (p.p.s. we used cashews instead of walnuts.)

I made these and accidentally forgot the orange juice, but they were great! I am bagging them up to hand out as holiday gifts.

A truly interesting and delightful way to prepare walnuts.  I love the unique flavor produced by blending of the various flavors.

Best candied nut recipe for me so far. Used Cointreau instead of brandy. Had to make it twice because the first batch was gone by the next morning. They are a wonderful addition to apple crisp!  LOVE!

Very faint orange flavor and gritty sugar crunch-nice experiment, but will not make again.

I liked this recipe as it emulates 18th Century ways of preserving foods for the winter. if these walnuts (or pecans) had not been "cooked" and coated they would have been "buggy" by winter. I am using this recipe as part of a 18th Century learning tool. They most likely didn't have oranges or juice but another "acidic" juice could be used.

Made the candied walnuts tonight, very easy and extremely tasty. I made some adjustments.... added 2 tablespoons of molasses and a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, and it turned out to be a good choice. Next time I will use brown sugar, 2/3 cup brandy, dust with 1/4 cup white sugar after baking. Reminds me of the candied walnuts my mother would make.

I liked this recipe "as-is". I made variations that I also enjoyed...  Made more liquid than the recipe called for; strained the liquid before baking and then dipped the cooked nuts back in the remaining liquid before final coating. I used Cointreau instead of brandy. Will try combinations using brandy and Cointreau next batch. When double-dipping, I baked a few minutes more

This is now a staple of my Christmas Treats. Family really can't get enough.

I add 1/2 teaspoon orange zest along with fresh squeezed oj.

Do not use all the sugar at the end. Just sprinkle a little in at a time while stirring. They will separate!

5 STARS WONDERFUL.  I made them with 1 cup of sugar and baked them 30 minutes for a bit more crispness.  I also chose not to cover them with the other cup of sugar and without that, they were just the right amount of "sweet" --AND not so many calories.  Great recipe.

I made these for Christmas this year.  The recipe was simple and easy.  They turned out wonderful!   I plan to make them again next Christmas, but will add a bit more Brandy and reduce the amount of sugar to toss with after baking.  Wisconsinites love their Brandy!!

I sprinkled about 1/2 c. sugar and found it more than enough. May add some cayenne next time around.

Made as directed. The end where you are adding the remaining sugar, too much sugar for my taste.
