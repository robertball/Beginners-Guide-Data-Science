Sophie'e Choice is my choice!

I ran out of white sugar, and put in 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  The brown sugar added a nice touch to it.  

I followed other advice, and squeezed some of the water out of the shredded zucchini before I added it.  The bread (and dozen muffins I made) came out great!

To make zucchini muffins from this recipe, just alter the baking time to 30mins.  Test with a toothpick or wooden skewer, and if it comes out "clean" they're done!

I don't have two loaf pans, so I dumped all the batter into a bundt pan, cooked it for a little less than an hour...and it was amazing!  I took the results to a family reunion and got raves.  Made a dense and delicious bread.  Held up well when slicing, too.

Great recipe...my husband and kids loved it. To make it go FASTER, I substituted 2c. Zucchini with 1c. Apple and 1c. Carrots...It's one way to get the kids to eat their vegtables!

My husband says this bread is the BEST!  I changed a few things...Exchanged 1 C. Whole Wheat flour, Increased the cinnamon to 1 T., Decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 C., Increased the zucchini to 4 C. and Added 1 t. allspice.

This bread is delicious! I love that this recipe uses 50% more zucchini than regular recipes. It creates a more hearty texture and my family gets a healthier sweet bread. I substituted 1/2 of the oil with applesauce and it was still wonderfully moist and dense. Highest recommendation!

This is the best recipe I have made for Zucchini Bread.  I always need tasty ways to use up my "Giant" garden zucchini, but my husband usually doesn't like heavy quick breads.  He really enjoyed this recipe.  I like it exactly as is!! But, for a change up, I have added golden raisins instead of nuts and used 2 ts. cinnamon and 1 ts. apple pie spice (I was out of nutmeg) and made muffins...baking for 15 minutes.  Great for a quick snack.  Thank you Laura for a great recipe!

This is fantastic. Not only is it really, really good, but the house smells wonderful! I used a scant cup of oil (about 1TBSP less) than called for, added 1/4 tsp allspice, and used 1-1/2 c. of sugar. I baked it for 53 mins. in a bundt pan. It's very moist. I'm glad I didn't bake it any longer, or it'd have dried out. Next time, I'll check it after 50 minutes. Even the prebaked batter was yummy (hey, I was checking the sweetness level!)

very, very nice! My only change, or addition was a bit of nutmeg, and have to spray everything with non-stick spray..well, just because!  It was nice and dense with zucchini, but also light in flavor, and held together wonderfully when sliced for the kids peanut butter sandwiches.  Yummy!  Got raves in this house.  Printed, and added to the house recipe box, thanks Laura!

Excellent recipe!  I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups all purpose flour, just for a richer flavor.  The only zucchini bread recipe I'll ever use!

Full of flavor, super moist. Be sure to use 8"X4" pans. The recipe doesn't specify size of loaf pans, and after scraping the batter into 9X5s, it just looked too shallow, so I scraped it into a smaller one. Had I not done this and gone ahead with the 9"X5", it would have resulted in a loaf that was 1" at its thickest part. It doesn't rise a whole lot, so be prepared for that. But the texture is excellent. No need to squeeze any liquid out of the zucchini if you are using young, small items, no more than 6" in length. If using very mature stuff (like baseball-bat size!) then peel (because the peel on those can be tough) and squeeze a little of the excess moisture out of the grated product before incorporating it. I made it exactly as written, using young zucchini, and there's not a thing I would change. Absolutely perfect, as is.

Excellent.

I had 2 cups zuchinni, so I shredded apple to make 3 cups.  Then I made fresh applesauce for the 1 cup veg oil.  I was also missing bread pans, so used a 10" square pan.  It was so moist and delicious.

I cut this recipe in half. I upped the baking soda/powder to a full teaspoon each (I do this for every muffin recipe I make--you don't mess with success). I also used melted butter instead of vegetable oil. To make it lighter, I used half homemade chunky applesauce in place of half of the butter and for the half egg it asked for (again, for a halved recipe). No nuts so I just omitted them. I made muffins out of this recipe, I was able to get 12 muffins from a half batch. 350* for 20 minutes and it was just right. This turned out very good. Next time, I'd like to add some raisins.

What a wonderful recipe!  The zucchini bread turned out moist and flavorful, and we all loved it.

I did substitute the 1 cup vegetable oil with 1/3 oil and 3/4 c applesauce, in an attempt to lower the fat content a bit.  I also used 1 c white sugar and 1 c brown sugar, and increased the baking soda to 1/2 tsp.  I drained the zucchini on paper towels for 5 minutes before adding it to the egg-sugar mixture, and since the loaf is -very- moist, I'm glad I did.  Definitely a keeper!  Thank you!

Excellent cake.  Seems like it got better and more moist the next day.  Great with cream cheese frosting.  A new family favorite.

AWESOME!  I threw the zucchini & wet ingredients in my food processor.  Also, I used halzlenuts as I was out of walnuts!  The two loaves came out perfectly and very moist!  (By the way, if your loaf doesn't want to come out of the pan, wait until it has cooled off somewhat and then they'll slide right out).  Thanks for the recipe! YUMMY!!!!!!!!!

Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe. 
I used 1/2 cup oil& 1/2 cup applesauce to lower the fat and it turned out great. I also turned my oven down to 325F the last 12 min.as the bread was getting a little dark. I will be making this recipe again soon& next time I will add 1 more tsp cinnamon. Thanks yum! I also drained excess water from squash. thanks for the tip!

This is the best zucchini bread recipe I have ever used.  I had over 100 lbs of zucchini to shread and make bread from.  I used 5 different recipes and after giving away 60 loaves of bread....the votes were in.  Thanks!

This is the best zucchini bread ever.  No matter who tried it, everyone wanted the recipe, even people who allegedly don't like zucchini.  I subsituted 2 cups of the flour with whole wheat flour, added 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger and 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin spice, cut the sugar by 1/2 cup, and added 1/4 cup of ground hazelnuts....it gives the bread a bit more flavor.

I used this recipe for a bake sale fund raiser at work and was flattered at the great response I got on how DELICIOUS it was.  People told me that it was the best Zucchini bread they have ever had, even those who don’t typically eat Zucchini Bread raved over it. I was very impressed with how easy it was to make and more impressed with how moist and favorable it was. In my opinion, the texture made it the a big hit that it was, and I would like to personally thank Sophie for sharing this recipe with us and will keep it in my recipe box for years to come.

This is a very good zucchini bread.  I substitute 1/2 cup of wheat germ for the flour 
just to make it a little healthier, and used almond extract instead of vanilla.  Bakes up
well in a bundt pan also!

I had a monster zucchini come from my garden, so I decided to make it into bread.  I LOVED this recipe.  It was moist and flavorful!  My kids went through the first loaf in about half a day.  We sent loaves to the neighbors as well and everyone enjoyed it!  I did change out half the oil for apple sauce to make it a little healthier and cut down the sugar by 1/2 cup.  This was awesome!  We did freeze several loaves and they froze BEAUTIFULLY!  Highly recommend this recipe!

Very moist and tasty! Used pecans instead of walnuts. TIP: shred your zucchini and store for a few hours in a zip lock. A lot of the water will fall to the bottom then snip off a corner and drain. I find this to be a necessary step when making this bread.

Yummilicious!!!  I picked this recipe because it uses more zucchini than most others and I have stuck with this recipe because it's AWESOME!  I substitute 1c of applesauce for the 1c of oil, then lightly grease my pans.  It comes out wonderful and VERY lowfat this way!  I usually sub 1c brown + 1c white sugar, and 1c whole wheat flour+ 2c AP flour.  Next time I'll do as another suggested and add some grated carrot.  Fun recipe to play with - never lets me down!

This zucchini bread is so wonderful.  It is moist and dense. Most recipes use only 2 cups of grated zucchini, this 3 cup recipe is better.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful bread.

I've been using my zucchini bread recipe for 20 years and always thought it was very good. This one is even better! It's not too heavy and kids like it because it's just sweet enough. Next time I make it I'm going to throw in a handful of mini chocolate morsels and see how that goes. I baked mine in a bundt pan with great results and it looks a little 'fancier' for company. Thanks for sharing!!

Instead of 2 cups of white sugar I used 1.5 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar.  I made one bread and then 6 muffins with the rest of the batter.  I brought the bread into work and it was gone by the the end of the shift.  Am making it again within a week!

So delicious!  Crispy outside and soft inside.  Made many substitutions that others did...brown sugar, applesauce and whole wheat flour, and the result is excellent.

This is really moist and delicious. I cut the oil in half and it still turned out really nice.  I took the suggestion of another reader and added some nutmeg as well.  Tasted wonderful, thanks for sharing.

This is the second year I've been using this recipe and it is one of the best tasting zucchini bread I've ever made.  I have one problem and hope someone could help me with it.  Every time I make it, the bottom 1/8" of the bread is always undercooked.  I've tried different types of bread pans and I've baked them in both my electric built in oven and in my gas stove.  The result is always the same.  Any suggestions?

I started with another recipe from this site, but with changes (extra cup of zucchini) ended up making this recipe.  The only deviation I made from this recipe was to cut the oil in half to make it healthier (it didn't affect the results at all!), added some raisins for sweetness and about ½ tsp. nutmeg.  Absolutely delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the ultimate zucchini bread ! I have to make about 40-50 loaves each summer to freeze, because it's the only thing my husband will eat for breakfast. I was short on zucchini once and used only 2 cups, and it seemed awful to us. I DO SUGGEST, HOWEVER, THAT THE BAKING TIME BE MORE THAN JUST ONE HOUR. MINE TAKES ANYWHERE FROM 75 MINUTES TO 1 ½ HOURS. ALSO, TRY ADDING A MASHED BANANA, DRIED CHERRIES, OR PECANS/ALMONDS INSTEAD OF THE WALNUTS.

I followed the recipe exactly, and am not impressed with the results.  The loaf lacks something...though I can't put my finger on exactly what it is.  Granted, it wasn't the worst zucchini bread I've tasted, but it certainly isn't the best.

I suggest the "Zucchini Bread IV" recipe instead.  I get consistent, flavorful results with it every time.

Finally a good zucchini bread recipe...I have been looking for a zucchini bread recipe that is more dense than many of the "too light and airy" recipes I have tried recently.  This bread is delicious...my husband was eating it and looked at me and said "this is the one".  Thanks for a great tasting recipe.  I doubled the recipe and added mini chocolate chips to two of the four loaves...a great taste combination and a great way to get kids to eat zucchini.

This is the best recipe I've found!  I use 1 C white and 1 C brown sugar instead of the 2 C white sugar, and the flavor is much deeper.

I chose this recipe because it uses 3 cups of shredded zucchini instead of 2 which most other recipes use.  I had 4 very large zukes to use, so got the food processor out and shredded all of them. I made this recipe, but made 1 bread and 6 large muffins. Cooked the muffins for 30 mins and the bread for about 54 mins.  Then I put the rest of the shredded zukes into ziploc bags with 3 cups shredded into each bag.  Will use this fall and winter to make more of this excellent recipe. I did not use nuts, and I think next time when I make muffins I will add some choc chips in.

Yummy.  I added cardamon for a more complex spice flavor and added 1/4 c. choc chips instead of walnuts (to get the kids to eat it).  An hour would have been far too long.  Muffins were done in 30 minutes and loaf was done in 45 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This bread was amazing.  First time I ever cooked zucchini bread and it turned out really well.  I'm going to try it again with one less tsp of ground cinnamon.  Tip: Use a rag or paper towel to soak up some of the water from the zucchini.

Compared to alot of recipes here, this one calls for the most zucchini and that is why I decided on it.  Im so glad I did because it's really good! I squeezed out alot of the juice from the zucchini by using my potato ricer.  Even doing that, this loaf was super moist. It's also very light and has a very delicate spice flavour.  Next time I will increase the cinnamon just by a little. THX

Love it! I chose this recipe at first because it uses 3 cups of grated zucchini, which is more than what other similar recipes call for. (The zucchini that I used yielded exactly 3 cups of grated one, and I don't like having leftover grated zucchini.) This recipe yields a super moist bread/muffins. However, I made some modifications to it: Used 4 tsp all-spice, 1/4 tsp each for ground clove and nutmeg, and reduced sugar to 1-1/3 cups. And, the result was pretty satisfying: Spicy and sweet enough for me and my friends who tried it. And, GREASE OR LINE YOUR LOAF/MUFFIN PANS! (Can't imagine making quick bread without greasing your pans!) Will use this again for zucchini bread in the future! Highly recommended!

My neighbour gave me a gigantic zucchini and was looking for a good recipe.It is very moist and tastes great! I added a lemon zest, a pinch of nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice instead of vanilla. It was a big hit at the work. I will bake it again.

I made this yesterday afternoon. It was inhaled and gone by 8am this morning. My 6 yr old daughter wanted it in her lunch box and my 4 yr old wanted it for breakfast. My husband ate it all night and this AM. A couple of small changes,  I added 1/2 cup less sugar and will probably add even less next time and  I reduced the oil and added applesauce instead. I also made it in a 9x13 pan. It  definitely will be made again. Thanks!

This is great zucchini bread.  I used chopped pecans, it's what I had in the freezer. I did toast them first.  Everyone at work loved and raved about it.

This was the best zucchini bread I have ever tasted!
Even my picky boyfriend who believes that vegetables  don't belong in baked goods loved it!  It was very moist and full of flavour.  This is definately a keeper that will be shared with my family and friends.  Thanks Sophie! :)

This is my grandmother recipe except she uses raisins instead of nuts. I like to soak s in a little brandy before dredging in flour. Also add some more spices: 1 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp cloves.

What a great way to use zucchini. I did shred up a very large zucchini and used 3 cups to make this recipe and put the 3 additional cups in a zip lock bag in the freezer.
Very moist dense bread, just the right texture and flavors I was looking for. More yummy after it sits wrapped for a day or 2.

I just made these and they are awesome! I did make 2 changes. I used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I also tossed in some chocolate chips! This recipe is very versatile. I am sure it would be great even without the changes.  I love this recipe. It is the perfect way to use up zucchini. i can not quit raving about this recipe. My family loved this bread!

So good! I made this last week, took 1 loaf to work and got so many requests to bring in more that I'm making it again this week. Even had some offer to pay me to make her a loaf every week.

I made a couple tweaks to this recipe, but felt it was fair to review it because the basic recipe is still intact.  My tweaks: I used half whole wheat flour and substituted plain applesauce for half of the oil. This bread was pretty good, but I think two cups of sugar was far too much, because the major flavor is "sweet" with almost no spice flavor, which was surprising with a full tablespoon of cinnamon.  I'll probably use this recipe again, but I'll cut the sugar down by at least 1/2 cup and also add some additional spices like nutmeg or cloves.  The bread was very moist (don't drain the zucchini) and soft, and tasted even better the next day.  I made it into five mini loaves and 16 mini muffins.  The mini muffins baked for about 17 minutes and the mini loaves baked for about 30 minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and I've got a dry mess. Bread is not moist after baking for an hour, and pouring it into ungreased pans? The bread stuck to my non-stick pans and I had to bang it out. Neither loaf is pretty looking. It does taste good even if dry. I would add some ground cloves to it if I ever make it again, grease the pans and cut back on the baking time.

Perfect! Easy to make! Only substituion - 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil, instead of the 1 cup of oil. I also only baked mine 50 minutes.

Delicious!  I used half whole wheat flour and applesauce for half of the oil.  I also added some fresh grated nutmeg.  It was so good - moist and full of zucchini.  I will make this again soon!  I recommend greasing the loaf pans and letting them cool completely in the pan.  One of my loaves fell apart when I tried to take it out while still warm.

This was a pretty good recipe but I would definately add some nutmeg to this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly this first time and it was tasty but not as good as my grandmothers recipe. They only difference is her's had nutmeg in it. Next time I made it exactly as the recipe calls for in addition with nutmeg. Excellent!

Great recipe. I substituted homemade applesauce (also from this site) for the oil, and reduced the sugar by one third. I also used half whole wheat, half white flour with a quarter cup of rolled oats to make it even healthier.

Holy cow!!  This is by far the best zucchini bread I've made, and I've tried a lot of recipes!  I used others' ideas of 1/2 cup applesauce, and brown sugar in place of 1 of the cups of sugar.  I also added nutmeg, carrots and I used 2 cups whole whaat flour and 1 cup white.  So good!! Thanks for sharing!

I too made most of the suggested changes, 1/2 applesauce for the oil, 1 cp of whole wheat, 1 cp brown sugar, and I used Splenda instead of white sugar. I also added carrots to the first batch I made, and choc chips to the second. The second batch I cut down on the brown sugar by 1/2 a cup and the cinnamon by 1 tsp. It was not as good, I definitely recommend using all of the cinnamon. I'm still rating it as a 5 because I think the base for the recipe is great!

I tried to reduce calories by using only 1.25 cups of sugar--well, next time i think i will increase it to 1.5 cups because this was not sweet enough for me (but i don't like too sweet).  Second, think you need to add some more oil to make it moist, but then again, I overbaked mine for 10 minutes so...I will try mixing in whole wheat flour to see if it'll taste any better.  Lastly, I must say that it's yummy!  My whole family doesn't like cinnamon-y foods so they didn't eat it at all, but I personally like zuke breads and thought this was a pretty darn good recipe.

Sophie is a star in my two-year-old son's eyes!  We made this bread together and not only had a great time making it, he had an absolute BLAST eating it!  Three pieces and I could hardly stop him from another!  We did not use the walnuts, and I'm glad.  I think they would have detracted from the wonderful texture of this bread.  I cannot stress enough how important it is to get all the water out of the zucchini.  I squeezed it all with my bare hands!  
There will be many more baking days ahead of this with our new favorite zucchini bread recipe!  Thank you!

This recipe was delicious!!!  I did make some changes based on the comments of others.  I substituted 1 C brown sugar for 1 C white, 1 C whole wheat flour for 1 C white flour, I added 1/2 tsp cloves, and increased the baking powder to 1 tsp.  I also substituted maybe 1/4-1/3 C carrots for the zucchini (I drained both as best I could) and it added some nice color and tasted great.  This recipe tastes very similar to the muffins served at Buster's in Flagstaff, AZ.  I made half the recipe into a loaf of bread and the other half made 2 doz. muffins.  I just made the full recipe Mon. and it was gone in 4 days and there is only 2 of us and friends who ate them. I just made another full batch 5 days later.  Everyone who tried the muffins just loved them! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!

I almost died when I couldn't find my zucchini bread recipe.  Well, good thing, this was even better.  I cut the oil in half and added 1/2 cup of applesauce.  My family can't get enough of it.

Moist, tasty, easy.  You should spray or grease the loaf pans before baking though.  Also I substituted chopped pecans for the walnuts, which I really liked.  The best zucchini bread recipe I've ever made.

There was so much moisture in the bread that it didn't form a crumbly texture. I ended up with a bread so dense with moisture that I would compare it to a wet brick - I had to throw it out! My advice is to squeeze out & discard the excess liquid from the grated zucchini. I tried another (similar) recipe the next day and had successful results when I removed the excess zucchini juice first.

This particular recipe has become my whole familys personal favorite. I gave everyone cakes at Christmas.  It is so moist and wonderful tasting I decided to try adding bananas to it(three ripe ones)It turned out beautifully.  It didn't lose any of its moistness, just added flavor.  My husband says it is the best banana bread he has ever had.

Needs some sprucing up...very bland.  I put yellow raisins in mine which helped a little but I wouldn't recommend reducing the sugar.  Try adding some all spice or nutmeg to spice it up.  Texture is nice, but I think increasing the zuccini is a bit too much.

Moist and flavorful, this zucchini bread is top notch!  I substituted sunflower seeds for the lack of walnuts, and I wouldn't recommend it..  but it is still mighty tasty~  I like that you use so much shredded zukes, for I have plenty to use up.
I like it best with cream cheese mixed with cinnamon and a little apple butter.

Really good, moist, basic recipe.  I threw chocolate chips on the top of one loaf and the kids ate the whole thing in a day. Moms sneak the veggies where we can!

This was fantastic!  I made a minor change and replaced some of the cinnamon with allspice.  I baked them in a mini-muffin pan for 20 minutes.  My 1-year-old loved them!

This was fantastic!  I was lazy and didn't feel like grating the zucchini, nor did I feel like pulling out the food processor and cleaning all the parts afterward, so I just finely chopped the zucchini, and it was fine!  I followed other reviewers' advice, and used half applesauce, half vegetable oil.  The oil wasn't even missed!  I left off the nuts, just to make it more lowfat.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these muffins with my daughter--perfect. (I made some regular size and some mini muffin sized--perfect for lunchbox right from freezer)  I didnt strain the liquid from zucchini--just throw it all in to meet the measurement requirement.  I used half applesauce half oil for the oil requirement.  I also used sucanat (unrefined brown sugar--more nutrients) in lieu of sugar and cut it down by 1/3.  still sweet and yummy! I had two large garden zucchinis and tried to meet the 3 cup measurement with a lot of the vegetable's green outside and then used the inside--green part has more nutrients.  I will add pinch nutmeg next time, too. :)

Good, but not amazing. I will grease the bottom of the pan next time. It fits nicely in two of the smaller silver loaf pans.

This is the first time that I've ever used the words "zucchini" and "yum" in the same sentence. The only changes I made were to incorporate the previous suggestion of 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I also made mini loaves so I could make 1 with dried cherries, 1 with mini M&Ms, and some plain. Yum on all accounts.

Pretty good recipe.  Cuts well and more zucchini than my favorite recipe, but since I can't find that one this might have to be my new stand in.  I like the idea of adding other fruits and veggies and will try with apple and carrot next time.

so good! I added allspice and choc. chips. It's a great recipe to make use of the giant zucchini in the garden. Just make sure you scoop out all the seedy part in them. I just shaved pieces with a veggie peeler since I don't have a grater.

I made this recipe as muffins and they did not stay around long. Everyone loved them. My only modifcations were similar to others. Half white, half brown sugar. Then I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. Cuts the calories a bit but doesn't  compromise the moistness.

I love this recipe because it is so insanely easy to convert to vegan by replacing the eggs - you don't lose any quality at all like you can with some baked goods. My best friend is vegan and LOVES spice breads, but when is the last time you saw vegan baked goods offered up at the market? I add a few of my own spices, allspice etc. and occasionally substitute in some vegan chocolate chips as well - delish!

A++++ !!! I have made zucchini bread at least a dozen times here lately, but this is by far my favorite recipe! Thank you so much for sharing! I always have to add my own 'umph' to it, so I did add a tsp of ginger, a tsp of nutmeg, and went heavy on the vanilla. :) Mine & my family's bellies thank you!

So tasty! I halved the recipe and added pecans and extra zucchini. I also added a little powdered ginger and cloves for extra spicy taste. The bread was moist and soft and delicious, and I froze most of it for later.

Excellent Recipe. I used whole wheat pastry flour in place of the all purpose flour, added nutmeg and more cinnamon and vanilla then the recipe called for. I also probably used closer to 4 cups of zucchini and cut down on the sugar- 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 cups. I will probably reduce it more next time- maybe 1 1/4 instead. I always use applesauce in place of at least half the oil, which i did this time and i might try using even more applesauce next time- maybe 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil. GREAT recipe- extremely tasty, great texture and flavor!!! Thanks for sharing!!

This definitely had the same texture as a banana "cake" so it tasted very familiar and homey. I love the simplicity of the ingredients and preparation. It truly is moist and fluffy!! Not so sweet at all...definitely a great replacement to a dinner roll/corn bread. This batch gave me 2 smallish loaf pans and 6 mini muffins. My only changes, added 3 and 1/2 cup shredded zucchini and 1/2 cup apple sauce (sweetened) and 1/2 cup oil. Just add a tiny slab of salted butter=heaven :)

I cut the ingredients in half to make only one loaf, baked it for 5 minutes longer than suggested, and came out slightly raw in the middle with a hard crust on the bottom.  Also, I didn't find it to be overly tasty.

Update:  Even better when made into a CHOCOLATE zucch. bread.  To do this, add 1/2 cup cocoa powder + 1/2 cup light sour cream + 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips.  I baked the whole thing in a bunt pan for 50 minutes.  Really good!  I made substitutions to make it lighter in calories/fat for me:  1/2 c oil + 1/2 c applesauce, 1 c sugar + 1 c splenda, egg substitute instead of eggs, 1 c white whole wheat flour + 2 c white flour.  Otherwise everything else was the same. I'm sure the originial would have been fabulous, but I wanted to be able to get more cake for my calories!

This turned out really well.  Very moist and a classic zucchini bread taste. It made a LOT- I got 3 mini loaves and a regular loaf out of it.  I subbed some whole wheat flour for part of the flour and some applesauce for part of the oil- I'll probably substitute even more of it next time! Nuts and raisins would be good in this quick bread, too.

I made this as written with only one exception. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup packed brown sugar.  My two loaves were done in 50 minutes. This is moist, delicious and holds up well to slicing after it has cooled.  I will be making this again!

Oh yum, this is so good! I made muffins, and they are perfect. I used half whole wheat flour, half white, and subbed aplesauce for about half of the oil. I also didn't have quite enough zucchini so I shredded a couple smaill carrots to make the full 3 cups. Delish!

I just threw away my old zucchini bread recipe I had been using for years and replaced it with this one. This is simply so much tastier and more dense than any I have tried.  I did have to bake it longer than the one hour;  even after 1 hour and 15 minutes it still came out a bit moister than I usually like it, but oh, my, how delicious! Finally - a zucchini bread with character!  Glad I took a chance on a change! Thank you, Sophie!

This is a pretty good recipe although it seems to be missing something. I am not an accomplished cook however, so I dont know what it is missing.  Overall the bread is pretty good just not memorable.

This is my personal fave.  I have made it several times. The last time I made it I swapped out almost all of the oil for applesauce - and it is delicious!!!  Also - in the past I have omitted 1 of the cups of zucc and replaced with pineapple.  Also good. Throw in a handful of coconut and some nuts...I could go on and on...

Used up lots of zucchini. Children loved it. I used a combination of spices (clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger) and pecans. Will definitely make again.

Moist and delicious. I have made this twice already this summer, and with my constant supply of zucchini, I will be making it again. I made in non-stick pans with dark exteriors, so I lowered my oven temp by 25 degrees.  Also, even though they are non-stick, my first batch stuck a little to the bottom of the pan, so I sprayed pam for baking on the bottom only for the second batch. Came out perfect.

Absolutely Fabulous! Great texture and flavor. Every other recipe I have used has made the top crusty and hard, not this one! I didn't find the batter to be too dry and I took others advise to grease the pan (I used Butter Flavored Cooking Spray) Also, I added 1/4 t ground cloves and 1 t nutmeg for a little more spice. Drizzled Vanilla Glaze from recipe on this site and it made it extra yummy! Thanks Laura! I will be making this again and again!

Awesome recipe. My dad grew huge zucchinis and I looked this recipe up. I only have 1 loaf pan, so I made one large loaf. Took an extra half hour to bake, but it still came out great. I made it 2 days ago and I already have to make another one! I'm going to make one loaf and muffins with golden raisins this time.

I love this recipe and the bread goes super fast when ever I make it (which is why I ususally double it).  To make a lighter fair, I used 1/2 wheat flour and all applesauce instead of any oil (3/4 cup to 1 cup oil) and it is very moist.  Be sure to use unsweetened/flavored applesauce.

One of the best zuchinni breads ever! My husband doesn't care for zuchinni bread, but he scarfed it down & then took the rest to give to his co-workers. I did tweak the recipe by using 1 cup brown sugar & 3/4 cup white sugar. I substituted applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil. I did add nutmeg & a pinch of cloves. Exceptional!

I made this recipe almost exactly as written, the only difference was I replaced 1 cup of white sugar with brown sugar. This bread is moist and wonderful, after 50 minutes the toothpick came out clean. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good.  It was the first recipe I tried for zuchinni bread and I won't be looking any further. The bread was very moist.  Since the recipe makes 2 loaves, I will give one away and keep one for my family.

Wonderful! I shredded too much zucchini (4 cups, squeezed of excess liquid), threw the extra in and it turned out great. Used 1/2 c. applesauce, 1/2 cup veg. oil. It's getting raves.
Made a second batch with 2 cups of wheat flour, 1 cup white flour and didn't like it nearly as well.

Fantastic recipe and very easy to make. To help with kids eating the bread I grinded up the zucchini into very small bits so there were no large chunks of veggies, it was all distributed evenly.  Big hit with everyone!

Delicious!  I substituted applesauce for the oil, and used 2 c. whole-wheat flour and 1 c. all-purpose flour instead of all A-P flour.  It still came out moist and delicious.

This was a very good "base" for zuchinni bread.  The flavor was good.  Next time I would add a pinch of nutmeg, some carrots, and some raisins to make it extraordinary.  Mine was also a little moist, even though I added extra flour, but who knows, I may have had really moist zuchinni.  :)  Oh, and I made some mini-muffins with the left over dough ~ Yum.

Seriously, this bread is SO good.  It's moist and sweet, it comes out perfect every time. I have made it with and without walnuts, and without the nuts it does not lack flavor or texture or anything! My little nephew and nieces love it and have NO idea we're sneaking veggies in on them -- it's Excellent!! :)

I had a Zucchini Bread Bonanza in which I tested three recipes (almost verbatim... except with pecans instead of walnuts) against each other.  

The other recipes were from the Better Home and Garden cookbook and Mom's (from this site). After a lot of testing/tasting, people waffled between Sophie's and Mom's, ultimately deciding on Sophie's. It really was delicious and had a better balance of moisture and zucchini flavor.  In the future, I will add a dash of nutmeg, and continue to use pecans.

Really enjoyed this recipe - loved that it had more zucchini that typical recipes - pretty much followed to a T except for using applesauce in place of the oil - will probably make this again!

Great zucchini bread that uses lots of zucchini! Instead of 2c whit sugar, I use 1c white sugar a 1 c brown sugar. Instead of 1c vegetable oil, I use 1/2 c vegetable oil and 1/2 c applesauce. Be sure to toast those nuts!

Incredible..that's all I can say!  To lower the fat content I used 2 cups apple sauce in place of the 1 cup vegetable oil; an idea I got from another reviewer.  It's so incredibly moist from the sheer amount of zucchini that the oil is probably a bit much. In my experience, no one can ever taste the difference anyway.

Fantastic recipe!  The bread was moist and tasty.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it could have used just a touch more cinnamon to my taste.  I used 1/2 c. applesauce and 1/2 c. oil and you would never know - it was absolutely delicious!

Super easy and super moist.  Loved them!  I needed about 3 thin 7 inch zucchini's to get 3 cups of grated.

Tasty!  I was looking for a recipe that used up as much zucchini as possible, and this fit the bill.  The result is very moist and dense; we found it easier to eat with a fork, but picking it up isn't out of the question.  The bread has a nice balance of flavors.  I substituted 1c whole wheat flour for 1c of the all-purpose.  I reduced overall sugar to 1 1/2 c and made 1c of that brown sugar.  This was plenty sweet for us.  I also substituted applesauce for 1/2c of the oil.  Bread was still a little crispy around the edges, didn't have that gummy texture you sometimes get with applesauce substitution.  Warm from the oven and spread with a little butter, this was delicious!  Will be freezing one loaf for later, expect it to hold up well.

I am conflicted about this recipe - because the spices are just right and has great taste however as another reviewer mentioned - it came out dry and I even baked in the upper third of my oven. Great taste but too dry.

Delicious!  I am, however, going to be one of THOSE people who change things up in the recipe.  I used 1 c. each zucchini, carrot, and apple (as I had read in another review), 1/2 c. oil, 1/ c. applesauce (instead of 1 c. oil), and 1 c. brown and 1 c. white sugar (instead of 2 white).  I also sprinkled in some nutmeg.  YUM!  I gave it five stars because it was already a great recipe, I just added some of my own stuff.  Thanks!

I LOVE this recipe! It's the best zucchini bread I've made yet! I did make a few health-conscious changes: I added 1 heaping tsp. of nutmeg; I used 1 c. sugar and 1/2 c. Splenda. In place of the oil, I used unsweetened applesauce. In place of the eggs, I used 2 ripe bananas (I pureed the bananas & applesauce together). 
We decided to make muffins, so everyone could have an edge.  It took 30 minutes to bake. 
To Top it All Off: Whipped Almond Cream! 1-1/2 c. heavy whipping cream, 4 tbsp. sugar, and 1 tsp. Almond extract. Whip about 5 min. until you have stiff peaks - like Cool Whip. We used this instead of icing. Can you say H-E-A-V-E-N???

Good easy recipe. I added 1 cup raisins along with the 1 cup of walnuts. I also suggest for those living in high altitude to grease and flour bottom of pan and increase baking time 10 minutes.

I sub'out some of the flour for whole wheat and oats, subbed out some of the oil and an egg for applesauce, and put about 4 oz of 74 percent dark choc pieces.  Also, I prefer to bake these as muffins (portion control) and easier to give away. YUMMY!  Everyone who tastes my mod'ed up version wants the recipe.  Very good!  Will continue to make, esp great when Zucchinis are in full-season mode (muffins are great frozen, then can thaw and eat later).

Yum!  I made them with 1/2 soy oil and 1/2 applesauce.  I used 1-1/3 c. white and 2/3 c. brown sugar.  With the changes, this bread is super moist, and really tasty.  I've never made Zucchini bread before, and this is the last recipe I'll try.  My search is over.

This is the best zucchni bread recipe I've ever made.  It made two generous loaves for me that were so moist and flavorful.  I gave one to my mom and my brothers ate it up within the day.  The second time I made these, I made them as muffins to put in the freezer so I can pull one or two out at a time for lunchboxes, etc.  Delicious!!!

This is the first time I've made zucchini bread.  Of course you can't taste the zucchini- it just adds moisture.  Changes I made:  I used only 2 eggs, used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar like others suggested.  Used 1/2 cup natural applesauce + 1/2 cup oil.  Perhaps a little too sweet so will cut down sugar total next time.  Good 1st time recipe.

Really good! I have actually started to use this recipe as a bread base for most sweet breads that I like. Instead of zucchini, I put 3 med apples, or blueberries, or even 4 med bananas works really well. I do like to add a couple of tablespoons of milk though, but it is not neccessary.

This is the way I get my husband to do anything I want... I bribe him with Sophie's Zucchini Bread. I love this recipe.  It is always pleasing.  I have used it 4 times now and it never lets me down.  The only thing I do is add a little nutmeg as suggested from other reviews I read.

Loved it!  I did make some changes though.  I put 3/4 cup of apple sauce and only 1/4 cup of vegetable oil, I put 1/2 the cinnamon they recommended and added 1 1/2 teaspoon of all spice, substituted 1/2 cup of grated carrots for the zucchini, instead of 2 cups of sugar I put 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar... Amazing--- will do again, for sure!

Very gOoOoOod! ...with a few tweeks! :)  Needs more levening.  Used 1t baking soda AND 1t baking poweder.  I enjoyed some loaves made with 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  The loaves where MUCH better if they sat in the fridge for 2-3 days(no one would eat them before then, they were so dry!), or after freezing... the moisture distributes nicely after this.  Moist, not soggy.  Which brings me to the next point... DO drain your zucchini if it's at all wet.  KEEP IN MIND that a zuccini is "born" with the same number of cells as it will have when it is large.  The cells of a huge zucchini are just filled with more water.  Using a large zucchini is why some people claimed this recipe resulted in a "wet brick."

I have had this recipe for some time now and I always get praises from it...everyone loves this bread. Recently, I tried it with almonds and almond flavoring instead and everyone loved it. It is perfect for the zucchini that is to big to be used for much else.....thanks for sharing the recipes. PERFECT!!!!!

I loved this recipe.  I especially like that it uses more zucchini than most.  I made a few additions and substitutions to meet my needs.  I only made one loaf, scaled the recipe to 12 servings.  I used 2 eggs, 1/2 cup wheat flour, 1 cup white flour, 1/2 cup walnuts, 1/4 cup coconut, and 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips - the rest of the ingredients I did not change.  It was FABULOUS!  The only slightly negative comment that I got was a friend who wasn't "sure" about the chocolate chips - but she is not a big fan of sweets.  The more I ate, the more I liked the chocolate chip addition.  Next time, I think I'll add some carrots in place of some of the zucchini and use applesauce in place of the oil (except 2 T).  I may cut back on the sugar, too - just to see if I can make it a more healthy.  And use egg whites instead of whole eggs (2 for each egg, whipping half of them to add air, less dense bread, and folding in to the final batter).

Three words: Excellent, Excellent, EXCELLENT! This turned out beatifully and I was so proud that I could get it to turn out so good! EVERYONE loved this and I have since made this "bread" three times.  As the zucchini season begins to go into full-throttle (when everyone wants to give theirs away from their garden) I'll be sure to scoop them up and use them for this bread! Great warm or cooled! Thanks a million Laura!

This recipe is perfect. It makes a fantastic loaf, is very easy and always tastes delicious. I grated the zucchini first, put it in a drainer and then proceeded with the recipe. The bread was superb (even my picky mother-in-law loved it). I compared this recipe with many others on this site and discovered most of them have similar amounts of ingredients (flour, sugar, eggs), this one calls for the most zucchini, which made an important difference. Thank you Laura for sharing this fantastic recipe with us!

Wonderful recipe! This bread is dense, but in a good way. I have used this recipe to take to picnics when the invite said "covered dish". Now I will not only take the bread, but the recipe as well! I made one change, I added cinnamon chips. Mmmmm.

Very yummy and easy. I made one with nuts and one without.  It tastes much better with the nuts!

Such a fantastic bread!  I was unable to find the recipe that I have been using for years and now I am so glad I did!  The only change I made was increasing the zucchini to 4-4 1/2 cups.  Sounds like a lot, but I love the zucchini taste.  So mine didn't come out too sweet.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

What a wonderful recipe!  The bread was so moist, it comes the closest to recreating my talented grandmother's recipe.  My only modifications are using 1/2 the oil and adding 1/2c water instead (it was still moist) and using 3/4 c golden raisins.  Thank you so much for sharing, this is the gift that will keep giving! :) This beats the Good Housekeeping recipe that I used last week by a mile.

This is the best we've ever had.  Everyone wants the recipe...  My children ask for it often.  It's a great bribe to get the kids to grate the zucchini!
I heap the TBSP of cinnamon and overflow the vanilla a little bit. Don't forget to pack the zucchini.  It makes it super moist.  Also, non-stick spray is a necessity if you want to eat it warm out of the oven.

It is a good recipe, bread comes out nice and mostly but not saggy. I made it multiple times due to overabundance of zucchinis in my garden. Tried it in different baking forms, also doubled it one time. Worked the best when followed the recipe exactly. Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I normally don't like to make changes, but I used pecans because I did not have any walnuts and put it all in one 10" loaf pan. When I attempted to grate the zucchini it turned to mush, so I ended up shredding it. Everyone loved it! I am going to make an extra loaf for the freezer.

I made this recipe exactly as written and I LOVED it! It's perfect. I would recommend greasing at least the bottom of the loaf pans. The two times that I've made this, it stuck pretty severely, even after using brand new pans the second time.

As this was baking in the oven, I was reading some of the negative reviews and was getting concerned as to how this zucchini bread was going to turn out! I actually was quite pleased with the results. Lately, I always try and reduce the amount of sugar in recipes, so I used 1c. brown sugar and 1/2c. white sugar. I put in about 3/4c. chocolate chips instead of the nuts. The bread had just the right amount of sweetness, with little bursts of extra sweetness from the chocolate chips. I used coconut oil, because I never use veg. oil, and I mixed the batter by hand. I baked it in glass bread pans, so I set the oven temp. at 325*, and it was perfectly done in 1 hr. I used 9x5 pans and thought the height turned out fine; it's not as high as some other quick breads I've made, but it's not a too low height either. I think the bread is moist and delicious!

This recipe helps use up your extra zucchini 50% faster than most other recipes.  It is also very tasty!  It is sweeter than I like, so I reduce the sugar to 1 and 1/2 cups. Do not skip the vanilla, it adds depth to the flavor. I made a batch in a bundt pan and it cooked in about 45 minutes.

Great way to use up that summer zucchini! I used 1/2 cup olive oil and 1/2 cup natural applesauce in place of the vegetable oil. I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar in place of the white sugar called for. Throw in a cup of raisins if you like them! This made 3 medium loaves, baked at the same temp for approximately 50 minutes. Delicious as a breakfast bread or just a treat!

My husband said, "This is what angels must taste like..." and we ate nearly a whole loaf at lunch time. 

I made a few changes for the sake of health: I substituted half whole wheat flour, 1 cup apple sauce instead of the oil, cane sugar instead of white sugar, and egg white instead of egg. It was amazing and I will put it with the best of my recipes.

Normally when I have zucchini in the garden that get too big, I feed them to the cows, or make bread with my old recipe. This time, I tried this recipe, and it was delicious. The only thing I changed was I reduced the cinnamon to 2 tsp. as a personal preference, so it wouldn't over-power the rest of the flavors. It was great and will become a regular recipe for me. Thank you for sharing!

Was visiting my elderly parents and they had some Zucchini that needed to be used up.  Found this recipe from my phone app. and made it for them. They LOVED it.  If my father approves of anything someone makes, besides my mother, it must be truly good.  Looking forward to making some for myself now.

I cooked this and baked it in a 1/4 sheet cookie sheet instead of loaf pans to make bars instead of slices.. I topped it with a basic vanilla icing drizzle and served at a big bbq... I had great reviews and they turned out moist and didn't fall apart.. very good and super easy! I am going to make a bunch up and see if they will freeze. Would be Great to have on hand everyone likes them :)

It is so good and easy to make. I did alter it and used 1c white sugar and 1c light brown sugar. I did strain some of the water out of the zucchini after it was grated.  Came out delicious

My bread turned out perfect.  To prevent over baking, remove bread from oven when center slit is no longer shiney.  My bread baked in about an hour using my smaller loaf pan.  The bread was moist and tasty.

So good. Very moist. I used 1C whole wheat flour, 1/4 C flaxseed meal and 1 3/4 C white flour and 1/2 C olive oil + 1/2 C applesauce to make it a tiny bit less fattening. I'll probably cut the sugar down a bit next time. This is a very sweet recipe (which I love)

WOW! Made a bundt bread for a luncheon at church and everybody loved it. I had to pre-plan (changed servings to 32 and made 1 bread in the bundt pan (baked for 55 mins.) and 12 muffins (baked for 15) -I couldn't get away with not having any for breakfast). I made it just as written and decided to leave out the walnuts (saved them for my oatmeal cookies). Thank you for sharing a great recipe. I love that it is heavy on the zucchini, too.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except for the nut (we have a nut allergy in the family). It is really good. Nice and moist. I like that it uses more zucchini than most recipes.

Excellent.  Baked exactly as the recipe reads with the exception of one thing.  I made 12 muffins and 1 loaf instead of 2 loaves. Baked muffins for about 30 minutes as an earlier reviewer recommended.  My 2 picky eaters can't get enough of the "cupcakes."

Delicious recipe! I made two batches: The first I made exactly as the recipe states, and the second I substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour for 1 cup of all-purpose flour, and I used a cup of pureed jarred pears for the oil. Just as delicious and a little healthier. I will be making this recipe all summer as my zucchini ripen up!

Super easy and super delicious.  I added marshmallow cream, cut the sugar in half, and reduced the oil to 3/4 cup.  Also added a teaspoon of nutmeg.

Great Zucchini Bread - So moist. The flavor was very nice, not to sweet. Thanks for a great family favorite.

I love this recipe.  Very easy and very yummy.  My 2 1/2 year old is in a no veggie stage but downs these as fast as his banana muffins that he loves so much.  I made a couple of changes, I substituted 1/2 the flour for whole wheat flour and I substituted all the oil for applesauce.  I baked 12 muffins for 20 minutes and one loaf for 50 minutes, both came out perfectly.

Like other reviewers I used 1c brown sugar and 1c white.  I also replaced 1/2 the oil with applesauce.  I have made it a couple times already and have used 2c zucchini with 1c apple.  But it is  also just as good with all 3c zucchini.  Only used 2tsp cinnamon.  Added semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I did butter and flour the pan to prevent sticking chocolate chips.  DELICIOUS!  If you don't like really dark edges make small loafs or muffins.  Bakery sized muffins turned out great and only cooked for 25 min.

Made one loaf and 3 mini - Cooked for 50 minutes for the 3 mini, and 55 for the big loaf. Excellent. Moist and Delicious. (Didn't add the nuts because I have young children)- Will make again. (Also, I added mini chocolate chips- yum)

I love this zucchini bread!  I make it exactly as is (without the walnuts), sometimes halved, and it has always come out fantastic!  I love how hearty it is, how much zucchini it uses, and how long it stays good for (I'd say about a week)!  It is great for breakfast or as a snack any time of the day.

I did not care for this recipe!! I used my bread machine, used self rising flour instead omitted Baking Powder, soda and salt and it was a complete flop.

Great recipe! Just like my mom used to make. I didn't have bread pans so I poured all of the batter into an 8x13 cake pan. It baked for about an hour and came out dense, moist and very tasty! Thanks for sharing! :)

Yummy recipe :)>  Great texture!  I made one change in the sugar measure.  I did 1 1/2 cups white sugar - 1/2 cup brown sugar..it added a different flavor to the bread and gave it a nice color.  To keep the bread moist after cooling...I wrapped them in saran wrap twice over and it enhanced the flavor to the bread more and kept it nice and moist.  My family raved over it..a favorite choice.

This was absolutely delicious.  Shredded the zucchini the night before and squeezed out excess water into a paper towel.  Didn't use nuts.  Cooked at 360 degrees for 1 hr 10 min, and then let sit in a 200 degree oven for another 5-10 minutes, as the inside was too mushy/moist.  It came out perfect- made 2 loaves :)

I thought the bread turned out great, I also added shredded apple, to the mix, and used maple extract instead of vanilla, and to make it less fatting i only used 1/2 the oil and1/2 apple sauce, it turned out  very yummy. thankyou.

This is a lovely bread.  Very moist and dense.  The cinnamon really gives it something special.  Put a little butter/margarine on top of a slice and it's wonderful.    I used 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar as suggested.  I only had about about 3/4 of zucchini to shred, so you really couldn't taste it, but I will be sure to add more next time.  *NOTE*My brother hates zucchini bread.  He tried a slice without knowing what it was and loved it!  I never told him what it was!  :P

Great recipe! Simple, basic baking!  I made one change...ok 2! I used Splenda alternative - made in the USA - and - used 2 t. of Oriental Five Spice powder instead of cinnamon. Enjoy and watch for our cookbook coming out soon!

This zucchini bread is so good!  I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup of berry flavored applesauce and 1 cup of melted (and cooled) Smart Balance Light Spread instead of oil.  I used 3 cups of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar.  I also added some nutmeg and raisins.  Really delicious- even my son with autism who is VERY picky and never eats vegetables gobbled these down.

Made this recipe tonight - our dinner guests raved! Turned out excellent, very moist and flavorful.  Used 3c zucchini - but squeezed out the excess water from the zucchini before mixing in.  Delicious!!

This turned out yummy! I didn't add nuts and I'm not a big fan of them but this would be good with them. I might add some rasins next time. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. Moist and flavorful. I will be baking this one to share with others. Definately a keeper!

I used half wheat flour and half all purpose, replaced the oil with apple sauce, and replaced half the sugar with brown sugar. This is an excellent sweet bread! very dense and the walnuts really take it up a notch as well. When I first tried the bread after it cooled, I was not impressed and almost threw it away. Luckily, I did not and when I gave the bread a second chance the next day, it tasted amazing. I recommend eating a slice with a little butter spread on top.

Great bread! I also made some changes, based on reviews. I used half brown sugar and half white. Slightly more than 1/2 a cup of apple sauce and slightly less than 1/2 a cup of oil. 2 tsp of cinnimon and 1 tsp of all spice. It is very sweet and probably could use a cut in sugar, especially if you add the apple sauce. Mine didn't turn out extremely dense, but just the right amt of dense to fluff. I also put half of the prepared mix into muffin pans and made a slightly smaller loaf bc my son prefers muffins. Very good would definetly make again and reccommend to others.

I tried this last night. I search for new zucchini bread recipes every year because I am always unhappy with the last recipe I tried. My search is over. First, you must squeeze some of the moisture out of the zucchini. If you don't it will not bake properly. That's common sense. Second, try using 1 cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar. It adds a special taste. Third, I used one cup of raisins in the recipe. I just happen to like raisins. This is a good moist zucchini bread and well worth the time and effort.

I made one loaf and 12 muffins.  The loaf took 55 minutes, the muffins took 25. I added a little extra zucchini (about 1/2 cup extra) since I had it and used 1/2 less sugar since I was running out. I didn't use the nuts because of my picky kids.  They came out moist and tasty...perfect really! This is a really good recipe!

Everyone raves over this one!  Super moist and yummy!  I used all whole wheat flour, 1 1/2 cups brown sugar, 1/4 cup canola oil, and 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, added 1/4 cup ground flaxseed and 1 T. molasses, omitted raisins & nuts, and used lots of spices - pumpkin pie, cinnamon, and a pinch of cloves.  Smelled heavenly baking!

An awesome way to enjoy your zucchini harvest! I also added some fresh lemon zest the second time I made it and it really made all of the warm, nutty flavors pop.

I love zucchini bread but since I'm not the greatest cook I was worried about making my own.  However, with a bumper zucchini crop from my mom's garden I had to give it a try.  I baked this and followed the recipe exactly and it turned out WONDERFUL!  It was thick and moist and full of cinnamon flavor goodness!  Thanks so much for the recipe, I'll be making this again and again! :-)

My kids love this and so do I... I make it frequently.  I don't change the recipe but I do have to grease and flour my pans.  I live at high altitude (6000 ft) and have had no problems using the recipe as is.  I have tried other zucchini breads, usually with lemon flavoring, and I much prefer this vanilla-based flavoring.  Thanks!!

Terrific! To make it more healthy, I substitute 1 1/2 c. of quick oats for the equal amount of white flour, and for good measure stir in a few tablespoons of milled flax seed. I've also replaced some of the zucchini with shredded carrots, and used applesauce instead of oil. I always cut the sugar to one cup. Delicious and versatile. My 2-year-old eats it up!

I have made this recipe several times now and it is really good! The one thing I would like to say is I have found the best thing to use is all white sugar and don't squeeze the liquid out of the zucchini. Another thing I learned is to take the zucchini bread out of the pans a couple minutes after they come out of the oven and immediately wrap them in foil. It helps to keep the bread moist. My grandkids just love it when I make zucchini bread. Thanks for such a tasty recipe!

This bread smelled great cooking and tastes even better the next day!  As other reviewers suggested, I added another teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and a dash of ginger. Then, for good measure, I threw in some apple pie spice! I like things with a lot of flavor, and this worked for me. Great recipe, loved how much zucchini it called for. The nuts are a must. My roommate walked in the door and said she could smell the bread all the way down the hall! I'll definitely make this again.

I love this recipe! I couldn't find my loaf pan (we just moved), so I made these into muffins. They were so good! I cooked them for about 25 minutes and they were perfect. The only other change I made was using a jar of pear/plum baby food as a substitute for half of the oil. Great recipe!

I made this for my husband and myself.  We love it!  Instead of using vegetable oil, I used applesauce (1 cup).  It was still moist and it was simply delicious.  Can't wait to make it again!

I made muffins with this recipe instead of bread, and used butter instead of oil.    Next time, I'll use much less sugar - maybe 1 c instead of 2 - for a healthier snack.  Raisins or dried cherries could be added for extra sweetness.  I also added nutmeg.  I baked the muffins for 17 minutes for perfection!  Very good recipe overall.

Very good. I used whole wheat flour and brown sugar and pureed the zucchini in the blender instead of grating it. I also substituted applesauce for the oil and eggs. Moist and delicious, although I'll probably add a little nutmeg next time. Made it as muffins and it made 12 large ones. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

This is wonderful zucchini bread.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and it was great.  It was still delicious after I made the following changes: substituted whole wheat flour for one cup of white flour, substituted applesauce for all of the oil, and added 2 tablespoons milled flaxseed to the mix.

Very good!!!  Very mild and soft.  I used 1 can of pumpkin puree instead of oil (healthier for my toddler) and omitted the nuts, added a sprinkle of nutmeg and cloves with the cinnamon, so it kinda tastes like a really mild pumpkin bread with a zucchini twist.  GOod though, that's for sure!!

Quite a nice, moise zuchini bread recipe. I added raisins on the advice of another reviewer...I wouldn't do it again. I think this bread can stand on it's own!!!! Thanks! My cooking time went over by about 15 minutes, also, and my oven is at normal temp.- just keep an eye out- and ENJOY!!!! Thanks!

This was my first attempt at zucchini bread.  Based on the reviews of others I added (about a teaspoon) nutmeg and used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce.  The bread tasted great, but I had trouble getting it out of the pan (maybe because I decreased the oil?).  Also, about 1 cm of the middle of the top of my loaf (where it split after rising)didn't cook.
Still, this is a great recipie.  I took it to work and got rave reviews from the rest of the faculty.

great recipe as is- but also a few changes help:)  I used applesauce for 2/3 of oil, then added the remaining oil.  I also used 2 t. cinnamon and 1 t. pumpkin pie spice.  It made two loaves, so I did one as above and one with chocolate chips.

I've made this recipe three times now.  It's very moist, even though I'm using whole wheat pastry flour and everyone loves it. The only correction I have would be the cooking time: it's a tad too long, 52-55 minutes is more like it.

This bread came out excellent !!
I put my own little twist on it by adding the zest and juice of one large lemon, a little more than a cup of fresh blueberries and about a 1/4 cup of flax seed.
Very, very good.
Thanks, Sophie !!

I had never made zucchini bread before, but after using this recipe I don't need to look any farther. I greased the bottom of the pans, as others suggested. A perfect way to use up unwanted zucchini gifts.

Great recipe!  I added 1 c. of dark chocolate chips and used pecans instead of walnuts. Next time I will be sure to grease and flour the pans though..... loaves were quite hard to remove.

I'm not much of a baker, but this Zucchini Bread is excellent.  I've got a lot of Zucchini from my garden that needs to be used up, so I'll be making a combination of loaves and muffins for the freezer and for my neighbors.  Great recipe!!!!!

I don't do a lot of baking, so I don't have a lot to compare this to...it is a really easy recipe and extremely tasty!! I didn't make any changes - everyone loved it! One thing that I occasionally do when making muffins is substitute half of the oil with applesauce. It doesn't really change the flavor/texture but lightens it up a bit. However, this bread is fabulous as is!

I didn't really care for this recipe. The texture was all right (maybe a bit too dense and even chewy like actual bread) but when I tasted it, all I could say was, "Cinnamon". It was overwhelmingly cinnamon, in my opinion. If I ever try this recipe again, I'd reduce the cinnamon or experiment with some other flavorings.

i baked it for 47 minutes in a bundt pan, i added 1tsp allspice, used 1 cup light brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar, and white wheat flour instead of white flour. tasted delicious, next time maybe less white sugar bc i found it kinda too sweet, but the flavor mellowed out deliciously after a few days! great recipe!

This is just like the one my mom used to make!!!  Do NOT peel the zucchini, that's what makes it so beautiful and healthy.  I also used 2 cups regular flour and 1 cup whole wheat.  Reading other reviews that said it is good with cream cheese, I did something different.  I mixed up one beaten egg, 8 oz softened cream cheese and 1/4 cup sugar and swirled it into the bread.  I used 2 3x5 pans and one smaller pan to give away.   It was FANTASTIC!!!  Next time I might try using the applesauce like others suggested to cut down on the oil..(nasty cholesterol!!)   YUM

this was by far the best zucchini bread recipe i have ever made!  i did find however that i needed to bake it for one hour, open the oven door to let some of the heat out, then shut the door and leave the bread in for an additional 7-10 minutes..voila perfect!

I thought this was just ok, it was a little dry for me but others at work really liked it. If I try it again, I will try adding some chocolate chips like I do to banana bread and will spray the pan as I had a hard time getting the loaves out.

Really, really good......even my picky, non-veggie eating 6 year old devoured it!  Based upon previous reviews I thought it would be too sweet, but was just about right.  I prepared it exactly as written and after tasting it, I personally wouldn't make any revisions.  Took an idea from a previous reviewer & made it in a Bundt pan, baked for about 65 minutes.  Yummy!

This bread was fantastic!  I always try to make a recipe healthier, so I cut back on some ingredients and it still tasted scrumptious!  I reduced the amount of sugar to just 1 1/2 cups and added about 3 packets of Splenda sweetener.  I also reduced the amount of vegetable oil that I used to only 1/2 cup.  Lastly, I used 4 eggs (1 entire egg plus 3 egg whites).  With all of these changes, I can tell you this tasted so moist and perfectly sweet!  Thanks for sharing!!

Great zucchini bread. I add raisins to mine, although it might be too sweet with raisins for some people. Wonderful when it's warm, with a bit of butter spread on top. If you're lucky enough to have it last several days, then it keeps very well. Just pop a slice or two in the microwave, and there's your snack. A definite must try for anyone who likes zucchini bread and/or banana bread.

People always ask me for this recipe. I've made it so much I've got it memorized. It's really easy and freezes well. I always make several loaves with my garden zucchini and then freeze it for the holidays.

I'm not normally a big fan of zucchini bread, but I had some leftover zucchini I wanted to get rid of. I was really surprised at how wonderfully the bread turned out! I followed the recipe exactly and it resulted it a perfectly moist, light bread. I made sure to drain the zucchini well  and also removed excess moisture with a paper towel just before adding it. The texture and taste were wonderful. I will make this again!

This turned out really good, BUT I had to make a few adjustments since I was short on a few ingredients.  I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour, and the same with the sugar...1/2 white and 1/2 brown.  I only have one loaf pan so I baked this in a 9x13 inch pan and made a zucchini cake.  Mine did turn out a little dry (I'm assuming it's because I used half whole wheat flour) and so I made a powdered sugar glaze to drizzle over the top.  This made it perfect. I believe 2 large zucchini equals about 3 cups shredded. Yummy cake Laura...thanks!

I varied the recipe by baking it in a bundt pan instead.  I set it to 375 and baked it for 50 mins., which was fine, but I wasn't too pleased that the cake wasn't fluffy, but densed.

I just finished baking this bread.  It is absolutely wonderful!!  The only thing I did different is that I sprayed my pans with cooking spray.  My husband and I had a warm slice with butter.  Yummy!!  Also, the zuchinni was fresh from my sister's garden.  Thank you for such a great recipe!  I will use this one for the holidays!!

This is the moistest zucchini bread I've ever had.  Wondeful recipe although a little sweet for my liking.  Next time I might try it with 1/2 the sugar.  Like other reviewers I heaped in the spices and zucchini. FANTASTIC.

Made several for the holidays. Everyone loved them.Sliced and froze several for winter supply which can be taken out a few slice at a time. I added grated ginger and carrots a few times. Works great with zucchini and cinnamon.Have even exchanged the zucchini for pumpkin from the garden. Best recipe all the way around. Loved using the other suggestions also to cut down sugar.

Wonderful flavor and texture. Very moist I used a Bundt pan so all the mixture went into the one pan and it rose beautifully. Baked with the Bundt pan for about 55 min. I used 1c white sugar 1c packed brown sugar and added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the recipe. This is a keeper! Raisins would be a nice addition to the recipe.

I increased the zucchini to 4 cups, added allspice, nuts, extra cinnamon and cut down the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  I used half white half brown sugar.  I also used applesauce instead of the oil and it tasted great.  I was very pleased!

I didn't have any zucchini but did have a big, light-green mystery squash, as long as my arm.  It was not as moist as zucchini, but I pulsed it in the food processor and added the quantity specified.  I did add walnuts.  Before putting it in the oven, I also topped the bread with fresh, toasted coconut pulp that I happened to have in the fridge, left over from making coconut milk.  So the top was crunchy-coconuty!  We all loved it and I will make it again, maybe trying to substitute with some whole wheat flour.

DELICIOUS! I used frozen, shredded zucchini that had been thawed and excess water squeezed out, added 1 tsp extra cinnamon, then baked the batter as muffins at 375 for 15 minutes. PERFECT! Fluffy, moist, delicious!

I use this recipe with my summer camp, which is all about eating healthy foods (especially fruits and veggies). I replace half the oil with unsweetened applesauce to make it even healthier, and the kids love it! I usually add a little allspice too, since I put that in nearly everything I bake.

The best way to use the bucket-fulls of zucchini my husband brings from the garden.  I freeze them and, voila, I have a great snack or dessert for picnics or road trips.

I have been making this recipe as is for a very long time!  However, recently, I have been experiencing difficulty with wheat!  So, I substituted the flour with a gluten free flour mix!  In addition, I used the Truvia baking mix (it is part stevia and part sugar) instead of sugar.  Lastly, I added extra egg.  It was just as awesome as ever!  Next time, I plan to mix my own gluten free flour mixture (white and/or brown rice flour with xanthan gum (maybe potato starch?)).  I will let you know how it turns out!

Apparently the best zucchini bread I have ever made according to my parents....since I gifted both loaves....I never got to try it....I made one mini change and that was to use 1c brown sugar and 1c white sugar....other than that, it smelled wonderful and cooked up beautifully. Thanks!

I experimented with the recipe the 1st time substituting apple sauce for the oil (big oops!) and it came out a big gooey mess after 1.5 hours of baking. The 2nd time I followed the recipe to a T but set my oven at 375 degrees. After an hour it seemed done but after cutting into I realized it still wasn't completely done. I knew it would be dense but it hadn't even fluffed up a tiny bit. The flavor is okay, but the consistency and quirky baking times is a no-go for me.

Great recipe. Thank you so much!
I tried many recipies for zuchini bread and this one is the winer for me. I like that it calls for a lot of zuchini. It is moist , when you cut a slice it doesn't crumble and looks prietty.

I made this with my sister and we rocked it! I thought it was disgusting before because there are zuccihinis in it. I was so wrong. It tastes like cinnamon and sugar! I love it and it deserves 5 stars!

I am of Asian background and do not like breads/cakes that are too sweet, oily or taht have an overpowering flavor.  I made some adjustments to this recipe that made my bread come out perfect- a light, fluffy bread that was extremely moist and not too sweet or oily. Decreased cinnamon to 2 tsp, decreased sugar to 1 cup (and changed to pure maple sugar), and decreased oil to 1/2 cup.  Increased baking powder to 1 tsp.  Added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.  Also partially drained the zucchini liquid.  My husband and daughter couldn't get enough! Thanks! This will be a regular treat in my home!

This is wonderful! We make the 2 loaves and they last less than 2 days in our family. This is a perfect bread and a very easy to follow recipe! The only thing I followed from suggestions was to get some of the water out of the zucchini prior to adding it to the mixture. Doing that yields PERFECT bread. Thanks Laura - this bread is divine!

This bread was fantastic! We had some zucchini lying around the house so I decided to try this recipe. It wasn't very difficult to make and the flavor was great. I added walnuts. Awesome recipe!

I took some other reviewers advice and I squeezed out the excess water/juice in the zucchini before adding it to the mix, I also substituted 1 cup of sugar for brown sugar.  Either way I think this recipe couldn't have came out wrong it is delicious, my kids love it and I can't stop eating it.  Very moist and flavorful!!

This was very good.  I did however adjust it a bit.  I used organic whole wheat spelt flour, 1 cup sucanat, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 4 cups grated zucchini, and just eye-balled the walnuts - way more than a cup.  I cut the oil to 3/4 cup.  It turned out good, although I had to bake a little longer. I think this is probably a versatile recipe that will accept plenty of adjustments.

Made this exactly per the recipe. It did not come out as I expected. It was not very moist at all, even though I did not expel the excess water from the zucchini. It tasted more like a dry muffin than a piece of moist zucchini bread. In my opinion it needs much more zucchini added to it to actually be able to taste the zucchini flavor.

Great recipe. I've made it twice and it comes out moist and delicious. I use apple sauce instead of oil and add cream cheese chunks to the batter. I bought some zucchini bread at a market in D.C. and it had the cream cheese baked in. I couldn't imagine making eating it without the cream cheese. It is so yummy!  I haven't tried it with the nuts, but I'll throw them in next time.

de-lish. the only change I made was adding 2 tsp of baking powder because I had run out of baking soda. I will definitely make these again and add the apple like others suggested. I would also cut half the oil with applesauce.

So good!!  My whole family loved this, even my 2 and 4 year olds!  Easy to make, although a stand mixer would have been better to use since I broke my hand mixer making it!  It reminded my of my mom's recipe, I think next time I will try adding some nutmeg to add to the flavor!  Thank you!!

I made this tonight - an absolute keeper.  Instead of 2 cups of sugar, I used 3/4 cup Splenda, and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Alos exchanged 1 cup of whole wheat flour.  When you try to be conscious of eating too many sweets and treats, there's no guilt in eating something made at home, from scratch with healthy ingredients.  Also made it in a tube cake pan.

This bread is so easy and so good!  I used a huge zucchini from my dad's garden, which was enough to double the recipe. I added a little grated lemon peel for freshness.  It not only tasted good, but the slices were beautiful with fresh green pieces of zucchini and nuts in them! Thanks Sophie!

This is a great recipe!  Thank you for sharing!  I don't have any loaf pans, so I used a deeper baking dish.  The recipe made a little more than I had room for, so I put it in the fridge and am going to try to make pancakes out of the left overs.  But anyways, because I used a baking dish, that is more shallow than a loaf pan, I had to keep an eye on the time, so I didn't dry it out, and now that it is all said and done, it turned out wonderfully!  My roommate has already eaten most of it-and it hasn't even been 24 hours....so it looks like another batch is in store.  This time I am going to try replacing one of the cups of zuc with carrots like another reviewer suggested.  All in all-loved it!

I thought this recipe was just okay.  It was moist, but it didn't have as much of the flavor of zucchini bread that I was familiar with from my childhood.  I think it was the cinnamon.  Overall, a decent recipe, but not necessarily to my taste.

just made this last nite.  3 stars for taste!  4 stars for texture.  needed a little more spice and i think it will be great.  where's the nutmeg?  will make it again with more spice to give it a little something!  instead of 1 c oil i did 1/2 apple sauce and 1/2 oil. a little more healthy just like the other reviews said!

Awesome!  Delicious!  This has become my new zucchini bread recipe.  I even substituted whole wheat flour (1 1/2 cups all purpose & 1 1/2 cups whole wheat) to increase the fiber.

The best I have ever made and will look no further for other recipes.  I make muffins (24 per recipe) This is not too sweet tasting , just right.  I ran out of zucchini and used 2c zuc and 1 c summer squash and it made up great.  Dough frighten me at first because it is doughy until zuc is added then moisture comes into batter.  Enjoy.  My fam liked it so much I had to make enough to last through winter.

I really like this recipe but my kids needed incentive to eat it because i told them their was zucchini in it?  I don't want expectations of choc chips every time so i mixed a little butter and a little brown sugar together and sprinkled on top and made muffin tops out of them.  Next time I'm using protein drink to replace the oil???  This time i used 1/2 oil 1/2 applesauce it was good.

Very moist and delicious.  The kids loved this and have told me to give this 5 stars.  I didn't put walnuts but some chocolate chips in the one loaf.  I also used half white and half brown sugar  (sorry, I tweaked it).

Wonderful bread! First time around I substituted the applesauce for the oil. It was very good, but a little on the sweet side.  Second time around, I packed down the zuccini so it was a solid 3 cups, added 1 tsp of nutmeg, added 1 cup chocolate chips, and actually poured the whole batter into a 9x11 baking pan and baked for about 25-30 minutes and made Zuccini "Bars".  I brought it to a pickies / dessert party and it was great!

I chose this recipe primarily because it used up more zucchini than many of the other recipes.  Because several recipes included orange and/or chocolate, I eliminated the vanilla and added the grated zest of two oranges and used a cup of chocolate chips in place of the optional nuts.  Absolutely delicious and moist.  Thanks for a great master recipe, Sophie!

This bread was pretty good.  I made the recipe as is.  The batter I thought was much better than the bread was when it came out.  Next time I'll sub out the walnuts for chocolate chip for a sweeter bread.

This was incredibly moist and delicious!  We used 2C unbleached white flour and 1C wheat and it came out just incredible.  Also used evaporated cane juice in place of the sugar (check out Bob's Red Mill) to cut down on the intensity of the sweetness.  Truly delicious!  Fun to pick at as it sits on the counter or slice, toast, and smear a breath of cream cheese-YUM!

This was excellent! I took another reviewers suggestion on putting the whole batch in a bundt cake.  I also used about 3/4 cup of the half sugar/half splenda blend instead of the 2 cups of sugar. I tried 1 cup previously but it was too sweet. After cooling slightly I drizzled a cream cheese frosting on top and let it ooze down the sides. It was incredible and my family loved it.

I wasn't too impressed with this bread, it seemed to lack something and I'm not sure exactly what. The texture was a little spongy and dry for a quick bread recipe. While it wasn't bad, I've certainly have better zucchini bread before.

I give this recipe a one star because it was just okay. The moistness was to wet. Also the height was small for two loafs.

This was pretty good.  I don't have bread pans so I used a glass dish and the cook time increased to about an hour and a half, though the outsides didn't burn at all.

Best zucchini bread I have ever had!  Followed the recipe and it came out just as all the other reviews said....crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.  Next time I'll try substituting the oil for applesauce.

This is my go-to recipe for zucchini bread especially right now when I have zucchini coming out my ears.  This stuff is fantastic tasting, stays moist and has wonderful texture.  I don't have to change a thing.

This was a very moist and delicious recipe, my husband loves carrot cake so the second batch I made with slightly less zucchini and added shredded carrots.... It's wonderful both ways!

I thought this was just about perfect the way the recipes way presented.  I did add about 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1/2 cup of golden raisins just because I wanted to use them up.  It was an instant hit with my family!

Awesome as a gluten-free bread too!  We substituted Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Baking Flour for the regular flour, and followed the suggestions of reducing oil to 1/2 cup, adding 1 cup applesauce, and cutting the sugar to 1-1/2 c.  It cooked well and the whole family loved it!

An amazingly tasty bread with a great texture.  I added semi-sweet chocolate chips and used 3/4 cup brown suger and 3/4 cup white sugar instead of 2 cups of white (just because I love chocolate and usually find baked goods a little too sweet for me)

Fabulous bread! I used cinnamon applesauce instead of the oil and cut the added cinnamon by 1/2 a teaspoon. I also used an 8x10 (I think that is the size) pa since I didn't have two loaf pans and baked it for 45 mins. It was perfectly golden brown and just crunchy on the outside and moist and delicious on the outside! Definitely will be making this again!

This bread is AWESOME!!  I have never made zucchini bread, found this and decided to give it a try.  It is SO easy to make and my kids LOVED it!!  They ate an entire loaf in one sitting.  They have asked for it every day and I'm on my 3rd batch of bread in a week.  I'm going to try the bundt pan suggestion tonight.

Ok, so I made this a couple weeks ago, and added chocolate chips. It was so great that my fiancee requested that I make it again as soon as possible. Well, this time I realized I didn't have any vegetable oil. So I used the applesauce substitution and used the walnuts instead of chocolate. IT'S AMAZING! Try it in muffin format if, like me, you can't help having two servings.

Wonderful recipe!  Instead of walnuts I use chocolate chips.  I also bake this in a loaf pan that has 8 mini loaves.  I bake for 20 minutes and they come out perfect.  I get about 18 loaves.

I have been using this recipe since 2001 and I love it!  I omit the walnuts (most people I share this with are not a fan), make sure to lightly squeeze the zucchini before mixing it in, and sub 1/2 applesauce/1/2 oil instead of the full amount of oil.  Fantastic!

This is my kids most requested quick bread. I have added things occasionally (nuts, raisins, choc chips) but like it plain the best. I also never have drained my fresh zucchini- never had a problem. Frozen shreds- yes I do drain.

this is the second time I have tried this recipes in 2 days.  the first batch did not turn out well, but I thought i was due to adding additional spices after reading some of the of the other reviews.   The second time I tried baking this, I followed the recipe to the letter and after 2.5 hours of baking, it was still uncooked in the center.   I will not try this again as it was a waste of money and time to try this out at all.

Want it savory and vegan?  I wanted savory Zucchini Bread and couldn't find a recipe, so I altered this one.  I only used 1/2 c sugar and didn't use any vanilla or cinnamon.  I added 1/2 c Sriracha Hot sauce, 1 fresh sliced Jalapeno pepper, and about 1 c of fresh herbs.  The result was herby and delicious!  I also used vegan Egg Replacer instead of egg.

It was OK. Nothing fantastic. I thought the cinnamon was really strong, and it was really all you tasted. My hubby liked it but even he said it was far from the best he had ever had. I won't make it again.

This was a good recipe. the bread was nice and moist. Baked up nice, not a hard crunchy crust like some other recipes. I did use the 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce method to cut the fat..Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe!! came here to find recipes to use zucchini from the garden and this is the first one I tried. Very happy I did. I made a few minor changes to make a little healthier. I used unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil. Used splenda baking for 1 of the cups of sugar and used 1 cup of whole wheat flour in place of one of the cups of white flour. I then made into 24 muffins. On weight watchers they come out to 2 points each muffin. Again GREAT recipe!!

Ok, I thought the recipe is great. I had tyo make some changes due to the fact i didnt look in my pantry to make sure i had everything before i started. So I used half golden brown suger and half white suger. I also went half and half with wheat flour and regular flour. The bread came out very moist and sweat. Lots of flavor. I love making breads. The cinimon is a very nice touch to this recipe, makes it so you can eat it for breakfast or lunch or as a dessert. Will make many more times.

I have made this many times (always substituting plain applesauce for 1/2 to 3/4 of the oil) and it turns out great every time.

OMG can you say, AWESOME... This was just the right amount of moistness and density  that I like. I just add a sprinkle more of sugar and a dab more butter to make it rich..

My family loved it. I added 1 Tbsp of cinnamon, 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 granulated sugar, substituted applesauce for 1/2 of the oil.  To one loaf I added 1 cup of walnuts, to the other loaf I added 1/2 c of walnuts and 1/2 c of mini choc chips - yummy!

OMG!! This recipe is great! I followed each step that is explained very simple but the only different things I did was reduce the oil and cook the bread more than a hour. I love this recipe and I can not stop cooking it!

The bread tastes good, but I trusted the recipe and did not grease the pans and the bread did not come out, so no we have zucchini chunks-o-bread.

I also substituted 2 c. wheat flour & 1 c. white flour. I used 1 c. brown sugar
& used 1 1/2 c. sweetened applesauce in place of the oil & white sugar. I have found that it comes out better by cooling 10 minutes in the pan & then taking it out. Also added pumpkin pie spice.

Out of desperation from out of the control zuccini plants from my garden, I tried making zucchini bread yesterday for the firt time and it turned out delicious!!  My 10 year old refuses to eat zucchini but he tried this after smelling it all over the house and he LOVES it.  I made half a batch and followed directions exactly except I used a 8x8 pan and cooked it for about 45 minutes.  Came out soft, moist, and perfect and completely gone before dinner even started.  It is now a day later and I am making 2 full batches.

I made this recipe just as it is and it was delicious!  I made one loaf and 12 muffins.  My 2 year old ate 2 and half muffins herself and asked for "another one, please".  Big thumbs up for us!

Great! I used 1/2 C whole wheat flour in place of 1/2 C of white. Next time I'll do 1 cup whole wheat flour. I also used half unsweetened applesauce for half the oil. Very moist! I probably used a little more than 3 C Zucchini and again, it was great! Kids were very happy!

This was great.  My mom brought me two very large zucchini and I pretty much had to make bread.  I lost my old recipe and couldn't find it anywhere.  Thank goodness for allrecipes!  It turned out beautiful.  Nice and moist but still dense, which is how I like my bread.  I printed it out and this will be my new go-to recipe for zucchini bread from now on.

Yummy. Just like my mom and grandma makes.  I omit the nuts most of the time since I am only one who likes nuts and usually double the recipe and freeze half.

This is not the best zucchini bread I've ever had, but it's pretty good. I added carrots in place of some of the zucchini and used half brown sugar. My main problem is that I would like to give a loaf to a friend, and I can't get them out of the pans. Perhaps I waited too long to try (it's been about 20 minutes). I guess he'll be getting the pan as well!

This bread is wonderful, very moist and flavorful. I made a few changes to the recipe, however. I only had enough zucchini for 2 cups, shredded. So I shredded a Golden Delicious apple, and that made up for the third cup. (I'm sure it would be good with shredded carrots if you wanted to use that, rather than the apple.) I used 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also sprinkled in some nutmeg and ground cloves. Very, very good!

Sooo good!  I make this every year when my zucchini comes out of my garden.  Can't mess up this recipe, always turns out great.  Watch your oven as it will brown on the top fast, sometimes I cover with foil to avoid a too dark top.  But the taste is always great.  I add about half brown sugar and half white sugar, and a little extra cinnamon.

This was my first attempt at zucchini bread, and I was pleased with the results. Because I was using only what I had on hand, I substituted 2 cups of summer squash for the zucchini - but it still came out tasting great! I did take someone else's suggestion and only bake for 53 minutes... next time I'll shorten it by a few more minutes, as it came it out a little dryer than I like. But overall I am pleased with the result... and so is my hubby! :)

I've tried several different zucchini bread recipes. This was by far the best. I decided to experiment a little and added 3/4- 1 cup of dried cranberries and used chopped pecans in place of walnuts. The cranberries really add to the flavor and help with the texture.  I also used canola oil rather than regular vegetable oil. I don't know if that made a difference or not. This will be the zucchini bread recipe I stick with.

I made this recipe at 6:00am took one to work and everyone loved it. My husband who does not like this type of bread said it was wonderful. I shared this recipe with a friend and she can't wait to made it herself.  Thanks

I just made it and served it to my parents after lunch. It is awesome. I did add only one teaspoon of cinnamon and 2 of pumpkin spice. I will certainly make this again. Yummy!!! Thanks for sharing.

I loved this zucchini bread recipe.  It's very moist and flavorful!  Have made it 3 times already! Made extra to freeze for later.  Tasted even better after a couple of days in the freezer. This is my new zucchini bread recipe!

This bread was a huge hit at work! Everyone loved the texture and the moistness of the bread.  I used 3.5 cups of zucchini and 2 cups of almond slivers.  Yum!

I chose this recipe randomly and am so glad I did!  My family is asking for the recipe.  It's very easy and great tasting.  I made mini muffins rather than loaves and baked for about 10 minutes (still at 350).  Thanks to Sophie for a great recipe!!

This recipe makes excellent zucchini bread! My family raved. I used pecans instead of walnuts. Made it extra yummy. I made 2 loaves with the intention of us eating one and freezing one. But both loaves disappeared in a blink! I'll make this again and again! Thanks, Sophie! And thanks, Allrecipes.com!!!

This is a very nice moist loaf.  I made the changes recommended by other reviewers, to replace 1/2 of the oil with 1/2 cup applesauce, using 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour.  Since I did not have quite enough zucchini I made it up with grated carrots.  The only thing I did have to watch is how I poured it in my pans, try to measure half into each loaf pan.  I also found it helpful to grease the pans.  This is one of the nicest tasting zucchini loaves we have tried though.

Absolutely delicious and very moist. It was very popular at my potluck.  A little bit too rich to eat too much of -I'll try substituting part applesauce for oil next time as others have suggested.

This was really good. I used olive oil since I was out of vegetable oil and I substituted half of it for applesauce. Still very moist and delicious! Also, I added choc. chips instead of nuts.

Awesome flavor and aroma. I added 2 carrots to the shredded zucchini  and used 1 cup of each white and brown sugar.  My kids can't wait to eat it for breakfast in the morning and I am enjoying it as a bedtime snack while it is still warm!

I made the recipe as directed, but I also added a teaspoon of Allspice to the batter.  I will never make any other zucchini bread recipe because this one is perfect!


4 years later and I want everyone to know that this is the only zucchini recipe I will will ever use!  We like our zucchini bread spicy, so I always add extra spice to it, but that is the only change I made and now, every year at about this time, the people where I work and where my husband works start asking when I'm going to make it for them again!  Let the anticipation build!  Haha! 
A million thank-you's to Sophie!!!!

Tried this recipe again.  The first time I made it as per the recipe.  This time I put in less sugar. (more due to lack of sugar)  Used 1 1/2 cups.  And I omitted the oil and used unsweetened applesauce instead.  Also added a cup of chocolate chips instead of nuts.  It turned out great.

Perfect!  We made these as muffins instead, and even my "vegetable-allergic" family loves them.  They'll probably be gone by tomorrow!  I did add half a grated apple, just because I happened to have it there.

I am sorry--I did not like this zuchinni bread recipe and neither did my husband.  It is so wet, heavy and soggy!  I have been making my mom's zucchini bread recipe with much success for many years, but I just tried this one based on all the good reviews.  I always drain my zucchini well after I grate it, but even with doing that, it was wet.  My mom's recipe calls for 2 cups and I am going back to that.  Mom knows best!

We decided to make this in a cake pan and frost it with cream cheese frosting!  It was incredible!  We used 8 oz cream cheese, 1 stick butter, and enough powdered sugar to make it spreadable and sweet!  Delicious!

This is absolutely wonderful.  I would not change a single thing.  It comes out dense, with just the right sweetness, with a nice crust on it.  I really like this bread, and cant see a reason to ever use another recipe for zucchini bread again!  Thank you!  (I had to leave it in about 5 to 7 minutes longer til it was completely cooked)

After receiving some zucchini from a friend, I went to make my recipe that I've had for 20 years.  However, the recipe calls for 4 eggs, & I only had 3.  So I found this, & figured I would give it a try, after reading all the great reviews.  WOW!!!  DELICIOUS!!!!!  Thanks Laura for my NEW Zucchini Bread recipe.  Great way for my kids to get their veggies!

This is an awesome recipe!  I made one loaf following the recipe exactly and to the other loaf I added 1/2C coconut, substituted pecans for walnuts, and drizzled 1/4 C melted butter over the bread during the last 5 minutes of baking.  Both loaves were EXCELLENT!  I've been looking for a good zucchini bread recipe for a long time and this one is it!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!  As my 3 year old says "it's delectable"!

My mother made a version of this recipe in 'coffee cans' to give at holiday time.  People couldn't believe zucchini was in it.  The recipe was missplaced after she died last year and this is the closest one I have found.  It was great - but try baking in an old coffee can - the 1lb. size is the best - no the large 3lb. cans.

This was delicious bread!  I used 1.5 cups of sugar instead of 2 and still found it a little too sweet. Next time will use less.

This bread came out very moist.  Too moist.  I don't know if it was the zucchini I used or what but I cooked it for a little over an hour and the crust browned beautifully and the bread itself was gorgeous.  It was very mushy though.....

The pans DO need to be greased, especially glass ones. My (mostly) whole-wheat loaves stuck to the bottom of the pans with all their might, and removal ruined them.

I ready did not changed anything.  My husband thought it 
could used more sweetness, because I used splenda instead
of reg sugar.  This is coming from a man who has a sweet 
tooth a mile long.  It called for 2 cups of regular sugar.  I use
1 cup of splenda.  Now, my co-work thought it was great.
Thank you so very mcuh

I'm so glad I saved this recipe in my Allrecipes file!  I haven't made this in years, but I still remember it fondly--and now I have found the recipe again--thank you Allrecipes!!!   In the past I've used the basic recipe and then added walnuts and/or chocolate chips (makes it sweeter) and/or shredded coconut (gives it more "texture" to chew).  Sometimes when cooking time was over I would have to "tent" the loaf and bake it a little longer, because a toothpick inserted in the middle would come out still wet.  ...maybe my zucchini wasn't drained enough, or I probably added more zucchini than recipe called for (too much of a good thing).  But it was always a success, and a family favorite.

I made this and it was very good! I didn’t have enough white sugar so I used brown sugar and I didn’t have vegetable oil so I used olive oil but not the amount the recipe called for I used less. I also only had a 9 by 13 pan and only had it in there for 40 minutes. Still turned out very moist and very yummy!

I decided to make this recipe this morning. I (as always) made my changes as I like to keep things a little healthier. I'm sure the recipe as is is wonderful as the flavours were perfect. What I did was substitute 1 cup of the flour for garbanzo bean flour, I did not use I cup vegetable oil, instead I used unsweetened apple sauce with only 1 TBSP. of the oil. I did add the walnuts but my family does not like to see the walnuts, and walnuts are healthy, so I ground them before adding. As far as the sugar goes, well I reduced the sugar by roughly 1/4 cup....I probably could have eliminated even more. I used a bundt pan and it took 55 minutes in the oven!! Very easy recipe, it's the cleanup that is not fun... Thanks so much Laura for the recipe, I will be making it again and again....

I halved the recipe to start. 
Even for one loaf, the amount of sugar  recommended is totally unnecessary. I cut the sugar by 75% and added about a tablespoon of honey. Replaced the oil for unsweetened applesauce. Replaced almond extract for vanilla extract. The loaf rose beautifully and tasted great! Next time I will use even less sugar- I feel that even with the amount I used, it was still a little too sweet for my liking. This will also make it a healthier option to use for weekday  grab and go breakfasts.

3 cups zucchini was way too much.  Bread was too dense and gummy/unbaked.  It still taste good but when repeated the recipe with only two cups zucchini,  it came out perfect.

The point of rating a recipe is to give a factual account of actual results.  Just because it tastes good doesnt warrent 5 stars.  U wouldnt buy a wet blob of loaf at a coffee shop so why are people so eager to over rate this loaf?

Very happy with this recipe. Moist and flavorful. I added a few dashes of nutmeg and allspice. Smear it with butter and you have a lovely breakfast.

Just made it and brought it out to friends. We all loved it. Followed the directions but cut sugar down by 1/2 a cup. It was so moist. Even my husband who doesn’t care for zucchini went for a second piece. I made a loaf cake and 8 muffins. Will definitely make it again!

This has been my “go to” for years. Sometimes I double it and make 5 or 6 shallow/short loaves. Thanks for a great recipe!

It is very tasty, but very fattening, especially with 1 cup oil for 2 loaves. Will remake using unsweetened applesauce instead of oil. Also omitted walnuts due to allergies.
Update: made again but substituted applesause for oil, and granulated stevia for sugar. It turned out awful, I threw it away. I like lower calorie options but it did not work with this recipe.

This was an outstanding recipe. I did use about 4 cups of zucchini and I did not squeeze out any liquid as it adds to the finished product and keeps it moist. I did not have 2 bread pans so instead like another reviewer I dumped it into a bundt pan. It was terrific. A little dense, as it should be, very flavorful and love the amount of cinnamon. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe! However mine is a little bit different due to the ingredients I had on hand. First I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and the rest all purpose. Second I used canola oil since I don’t have vegetable in my home. And I excluded a small amount to make up for the moistness of the zucchini. I also added a dash of nutmeg. And last but not least I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar since I ran out. However I could have used brown sugar but this ended up really well since the loaf is not too sweet. The recipe makes two loafs such as these.

Delicious!! I used 2 sm-med green zucchini’s and 1 yellow which was about 4 cups shredded. I used 1c almond flour + 2c regular, used butter instead of oil, and 1c white sugar + 1/2c brown sugar (instead of 2c white). Great recipe!! :-)

I made this just as written, it came out good but a bit sweet for my family taste. After reading some reviews I think I’m going to add brown sugar and pumpkin spice to bring out more warm flavors. Thanks for sharing

My family really loved this zucchini bread as originally posted, but I made a few changes the next time I made it and thought it improved things.  1)  I sprayed the pans with non-stick spray because the first time I made it it  got stuck in the pans; 2) I added 1 teaspoon of nutmeg; and 3) I substituted mini chocolate chips for the nuts.

Good recipe.  I replaced 1/2 c oil with apple sauce and reduced the sugar to 1 c and added 1/2 c chocolate chips.  My daughter loves it and it isn't too sweet for the grown ups.

This was delicious exactly as the recipe calls and also with macadamia nuts and white chocolate added. I also added an egg. It was so incredibly moist. Have made it twice and have people begging for more. Just need MORE zucchini!

Great recipe.  It makes a dense, moist loaf without being too sweet.  The only change I made was to add some Chinese 5 spice.  Yummy.

I have been making this for years... I make as printed for some & also add all kinds of fresh/dried fruits.. chocolate and nuts to this recipe. For the diabetic family members I add an extra egg & substitute sugar with 1/2 the amount of Splenda. It is everyone's favorite! Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful and got rave reviews at the company potluck.  I made two changes. I substituted 1 Cup of almond flour for the white and 1 Cup of brown sugar for 1 cup of white.  I didn't have two loaf pans, so did as someone else and put in my Bundt pan and baked that way. Sprinkled with powdered sugar  when cool and voila-perfection.

I love this recipe. It also takes a while to bake though. It was great I highly recommend this recipe. It is very cinimmoiny and sugary. So if you have problems with sugar you might want to add half the sugar the recipe says.

I made this recipe and it turned out excellent. I changed only one thing due to having no baking powder. I am wondering if it is this change that made it the best ever. Instead of baking powder which is essential for rising, I added about 3/4   teaspoon baking soda (still used the same amount of soda it calls for as well), but the extra 3/4 teaspoon to about half a cup of lemon juice. This creates the same chemical reaction as baking powder. I thought it might make it too moist ... that I would have to add extra flour but not so..... the consistency was  perfect.

Delicious!  Made it exactly to the recipe.  Took longer than an hour to bake  but I will definitely make again.  I had to slice it in the pan because I couldn't get it out of the pan so I'll be using parchment paper or preparing the pans some way next time.

The BEST!!  I've made this recipe many times and did not change the recipe the first 5 or 6 times.  Last weekend I decided to play around with it and added a half cup of cocoa powder .  Delish!!  Still moist and yummy.  I have also made muffins with this recipe, just reducing the time in the oven.  Everyone loves this!!

Baked this for 45 minutes instead of 1 hour and it was perfect. 
Next time I will use less cinnamon because it seemed like it was a bit overpowering.

Made this and everyone raved about it!
One of my secrets to making all recipes just a bit better is substituting cinnamon for pumpkin pie spice to add a little extra. I did that here and also my cups of zucchini were piled high so that they were more like a cup and a bit.

I have been making this recipe for years. It', my favorite. It is excellent! I did make a change to the recipe. Instead of using 3 cups of flour, I used 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of steel cut oats.  Other times, I have used 5 grain mix or 12 grain mix and the result is also excellent. I find the additional crunchiness added by the steel cut oats or the grain mix to make it very satisfying while eating it. Also, you may need to adjust the baking time.. When it is close to 50 min, I start testing it. If the knife or toothpick come out clean, then its done!

My family loves this recipe. We do 1/2c oil and 1/2c applesauce (usually cinnamon applesauce) to help cut the fat but this makes such a nice dense bread. I don't have the right size loaf pans so I use a bundt pan, 9 x 13 cake pan or 6 mini loaf pans (about 1 cup of batter per pan) to make this dependent on who I'm making it for. I've made 5 batches in the last week.

I've tried a lot of different zucchini bread recipes and this is by far my favorite.  I have made it several times and it always gets eaten right up.  I usually make several loaves in a day and freeze them.

I made this yesterday exactly like the recipe said (except for the walnuts since I didn't have any) and it was perfect! I did squeeze some of the water out of the zucchini like suggested and it worked perfectly. My family loved it and I will be making this again! I wouldn't change a thing.

I ran out of white sugar so used mostly brown sugar but I cut back on the amount a bit since I added 1-2c-1c of chocolate chips. I also used half whole wheat flour and subbed half the oil with apple sauce and added nutmeg and cloves about 3/4 tsp each.

I used whole wheat flour and substituted applesauce for oil and the result was amazing.  I ended up with 1 large loaf and 6 good sized muffins.  Per other reviews, I reduced the cook time to 50 mins & it was perfect (about 20 for muffins).  The true testament of how good this is is my 4 yr olds both requesting it every meal the past 2 days and asking for 2nds, 3rds... Will definitely be making again and again!

I followed the recipe except that I decreased the fat by using only 1/2 cup of oil and adding 1/2 cup of applesauce. The cinnamon adds a great flavor. It was so moist. I put about 2/3 cup finely chopped pecans in mine. I used medium sized paper loaf pans that I had so it made 5 loaves. Delicious!!! thank you.

I followed the recipe exactly and this bread is delicious! It is moist without being too wet.  The sweetness is just right.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

Used 1 loaf pan & one 12 cup muffin tin.
Cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, added 1/2 cup cacao nibs & 1 cup walnuts.
Extra 1/2 teaspoon baking powder.
Cupcakes were light & fluffy.
Measured the zucchini after squeezing the liquid out.
The toothpick test works.

Wonderful recipe that's simple & easy to make while tasting amazing! We did two loaf pans and then did it again and used a bundt pan to make another batch. The loafs baked as the recipe said but the bundt pan actually needed a little more time to bake through.

Okay, I admit: I hate when people give a recipe 5 stars, then write about all the modifications they made. And that is what I'm going to do right now. First of all, I used 2 C zucchini and 1 C carrots because I didn't have enough zucchini. I followed the suggestions of draining the zucchini, but I didn't drain it all. I also used 1 C white sugar and 1 C brown sugar. I may have added too much vanilla (I tend to get heavy-handed!). I rounded down my cup of oil. I rounded up my cup of walnuts. I baked it in a Bundt pan for 45 minutes because I don't have two loaf pans. And my bread came out delicious! I, personally, would do it the same way if I were to make this again.

This was a wonderful recipe.  My 11 year old twin daughters made it with little to no help and it did come out with incredible flavor and texture.  They did add raisins for a more contrast of flavors and texture.  We finished the 2 loafs in 4 days!!!!!  Not good for the waist line, but great for the culinary experience...

My husband had never had zucchini bread before and we are growing (lots) of zukes in our garden this year.  This bread was awesome.  My husband and kids all loved it.  Dense but moist, like a banana bread.  I could see adding raisins in it if you like them.  Next time I'm going to light grease and flour the pans as they did NOT come out of the pans easily and I was worried about scratching up my bread pans.  Within 15 minutes the one loaf was more than halfway gone and I don't expect the rest to last much longer.

Perfection! The only tiny difference I made was to reduce the sugar. There's plenty of sweetness in the vanilla, so going from 2C to 1.5C worked better for me. I would also suggest well-draining the zukes before adding them to the mixture. Splash city! Otherwise, just terrific!

First time making zucchini bread and I wasn't dissapointed. I used whole wheat flour, brown sugar. I wanted to cut down on the oil and used 1/2 a cup and 1/2 cup of applesauce as suggested by other reviewers. I added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I will make this recipe again. I think allspice would be a nice touch

Great recipe! This was my first time trying zucchini bread - I used the arabic koosa instead of the dark green zucchini because that's what's available in my country. I reduced the sugar though to 1 1/4 cups, did not add any walnuts, and added 1tsp of vinegar (for the soda). Huge serving though it made one loaf and 6 muffins! Fantastic recipe, highly recommended! :) - I added some pictures.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but had to make it a little healthier: instead of a whole cup of oil, I used 1/2 c. applesauce and 1/2 c. oil, cut the sugar down to 1 c. "white" sugar (just less processed natural sugar) & 1/2 C.rapadura (least processed sugar, includes the molasses and nutrients from sugar cane), and I used white whole wheat flour (less dense than red wheat, but still whole wheat!).
Very moist and yummy!

What a great recipe, we are it all summer. One change that is a nice add is a cup of over ripe bananas and subtract a cup of zucchini. Just a nice addition definitely not necessary as this is great as is.

Wowzers!  I've never made zucchini bread before so I didn't know exactly how.  This was the first recipe I tried and it was great.
I read all the reviews and so I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  I cut the oil in half and used a heavy half a cup of crush PINAPPLE.  I do this with my carrot cakes to.  I also thought I'd like it a bit lighter so I used a teaspoon of baking powder instead of the quarter tsp.  I only have one large loaf pan so I made muffins out of the rest of the batter like someone else did.  They were fantastic.  I may just make muffins.  The crusty tops are the best parts.

This was my first time making zucchini bread and I have to say, I was nervous about trying a new recipe. I found that this recipe was very easy to follow, nothing complicated about it. It's your usual wet and dry ingredients type of bread recipe and I couldn't be happier with the results. This bread is perfect !

I just took my loaves out and flipped one over, after running a knife around the sides. Of course it didn't want to come out and when it did, it left a chunk in the pan. And was gonna leave it for an hour but luckily I checked it at 55 min cuz it came out dry. Gonna maybe take it out at 45 min. Any tips on how to get it from not sticking to pan?

How bizarre. I have 20 year old recipe card from my mother in-laws box that has THIS EXACT recipe on it. In the notes, it says it was from a church bake sale. Apparently, 20 years ago, this recipe got around! Never the less, I have made it a zillion times and it is delicious! You can sub oil for sour cream and it is even better! It freezes well too!

This was pretty good and I will make it again. I don't have a food processor so prep time was longer than stated, because I hand grated the zucchini. I also cut back the sugar by 1/2 up.

Wow. This was my first attempt at zucchini bread, and I'm SO glad this is the recipe I opted to use. Phenomenal! I did cut some of the fat by replacing 3/4 c of the oil with applesauce (adding only about 1/8 of a cup of oil. Didn't miss a thing. And, don't tell her, but I think this recipe is better than my MOM's. Lol. Two thumbs way up!!

This is a fantastic recipe! Made it, then made my husband take it to work for his coworkers to have. If not, I would've got my hands on some cream cheese and ate the whole thing by myself. Good stuff. This will definitely be my "go to" recipe!

I have made multiple loaves of this and everyone I make it for loves it. You know its a great recipe when you have to get the finished product out of the house asap or you will eat it yourself.

Great recipe! Why use two cups of zucchini when you can use three? A great way to get veggies into my son. Moist and flavorful! Thanks Sophie for a recipe I will keep forever!

Just made this.  It was very dense as described.  My taste buds like a little more sweetness and salt and spice to it.  I will try another recipe with pumpkin in it this time.  :)

Love this recipe, but every time I have made it if sticks to the loaf pan.  So this past time, I greased and floured the pan and the loaf came out perfectly.  So I would suggest to grease and flour the pan.

I was very skeptical about trying this recipe, but boy was I wrong! My entire family loved it! Even my kids who hate veggies, I got three small loaves out of this recipe and all three were gone by the next morning! Followed someones advice about doing only 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c applesauce, I used chunky applesauce with cinnamon and it made the bread awesome! Making another batch tonite to have friends at work taste it! Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!

I've made this bread several times and its always a hit!  I substitute 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil in the recipe to lighten it up a bit, and the bread stays very moist!

JUst made this!  So amazing.  I followed the directions, except for adding fresh cherries, and using slivered almonds instead of walnuts.  It was also completely ready after 50 minutes.  It is so moist and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this recipe 3 times in two weeks.  I have loads of summer squash (yellow zucchini) out in the garden right now so that is what I use. I substituted all of the oil for an equal amount of applesauce and double the nuts.  Everyone raves over this one and it is so easy....gotta like that! :)

This was a great recipe!  I made two batches. The first one I followed the recipe exactly, which turned out great. The second I decided to cut the oil in half and substitute the other half with apple sauce as I saw a few others suggested, it was so good! Of course my daughters and I had to have a taste of both batches and we decided that the apple sauce batch won both in best taste and for being super moist. In the future I will make it with the apple sauce but either way it was a really good recipe. Oh and I increased the temp of the over to 350 because it was taking to long to cook.

Wonderful recipe.  Used 4 cups of zucchini; 1 tsp of baking powder and used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar.  Also used pecans instead of walnut.

I used half whole wheat flour and a mix of 1 T of ground flaxseed with 3 T water (let stand 2 min) in place of one egg.  By far the yummiest Zucchini bread I've ever tasted!  I will be making this again.

It didn't seem fully cooked in the middle when I took it out of the oven. But after cooling it firmed up and was very moist and delicious.

This is a go-to  Fall recipe-fills the house with that sweet, cinnamony smell.  I have a four mini-loaf pan, so I bake it for 30-45 min. It turns out moist and delicious every time. My boyfriend likes it with chocolate chips, so I usually make one regular, one loaf with nuts, and the others with chocolate chips and nuts. Everybody is happy :)

Absolutely delicious.  I halved the recipe when I originally made it b/c I didn't think we needed 2 loaves.  My family devoured the whole thing at one time, so next time I'm making the 2nd loaf so that we can have some the next day.

Very good stuff!  Substituted half of the flour with pastry whole wheat, used 1 cup dark brown sugar and 3/4 of white,  cut down a bit on the oil too.  Dense and moist with a great flavor!  Try it.

Best Zucchini Bread, only recipe I make, tastes just like my grandmas!  It is very forgiving, If I have extra zucchini I have thrown it in and it makes no difference.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out a little dry.  I liked the extra zucchini, though.  I will try a new recipe next time.

This is a easy recipe and very tasty. I have never made zucchini bread, but my entire family loved it. Next time I might add some carrots and apples, as another baker did, and some cream cheese drizzle. My son, who does not like zucchini was eating them after school and when I told him what they were, he frowned up his face and continued to eat them. Definitely a keeper.

Delicious!  No changes to the recipe at all.  My oven tends to be hot, so we shortened the cooking time to 45 minutes.  Whole family loved it!  Yum.

Wonderful recipe!  Good base for banana bread too.  Teens who HATE vegys will eat this (& love it) as long as you don't tell them and they don't ask 'what's in it' or 'what are those stringy things'.

I made this gluten free by substituting the all-purpose flour with gluten-free all-purpose flour plus 1 tsp xantham gum.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it was SO good!  I've had nothing but compliments and noone can tell it is gluten-free. One of the best sweet breads I've ever made.

I absolutley LOVE this dessert. It is a great way to get kids to eat veggies without even realizing it. I recently got a Salad Shooter - a machine that chops and cuts up things for you so I am excited to use it for this recipe.

I'm not sure what the problem was but this bread was dry.  Believe it or not 1 whole cup of oil was not enough to remedy that problem.  The only other different thing I did was use a large, mature squash but it was moist enough, I thought.  I will not make this recipe again.

This was good, just a bit overly dense for me. To make it healthier, I used one cup whole wheat flour, and the rest while, cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 applesauce.

My boyfriend is going to write this review because he is such a sweet fella and he loves zucchini a bunch!! Take it away baby...... Hello all of you culinary master-crafters! I thought that the zucchini bread was extra delicious. I had my doubts being a vegetable used to make bread, but it has a wonderful flavor and it is especially good when it is toasted. I liked it when it was well done and a little crispy with a good helping of butter. I liked the way my girl put in the walnuts, too! Thanks for letting me rant on and on about how great this zucchini bread was!

As recommended I greased my pans. I also used 1.5c whole wheat flour and 1 c all purpose. I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and cut the sugar to 1.5. It is fabulous. Great way to get some veggies into the kids and make a great fall smell in the house :)

Loved this recipe. Followed some suggestions by others. Used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 2 cups white flour. Added fresh nutmeg. Used both walnuts and golden raisins. Next time, I'll add 2 cups walnuts.
Yummy!

I substituted non-gluten flour in the recipe and it still turned out great.  My only problem was the loaf sticking to the bottom of the pan.  The recipe says non greased, but next time I'll grease the bottom.

GREASE YOUR PANS!! This recipe was wonderful, except I didn't grease the pans, and destroyed the first two loaves I made because I couldn't get them out.  After that, everything was perfect!

I can't complain about this recipe. I baked it according to the directions and didn't change a thing, except to double it and to grease the pans! I made 6 medium loaves and 24 mini muffins! I made half with and half with out nuts. Tasted great!

This recipe is okay. I followed the recipe and didn't grease the pan... BIG MISTAKE! The bread stuck terribly, even with a non-stick pan.  At a minimum grease your pan. I would recommend greasing and flouring your pan. I also thought the bread was a bit dry due to baking temperature and bake time. I would bake this at 325 degrees for an hour like many other recipes I've tried.

Pretty good, although next time, I think I'll shave off about 5 minutes baking time as I found it to be a bit dry.  I also should have trusted my gut and lightly sprayed my loaf pans as they were somewhat difficult to get out.

This recipe was pretty good, but 3 tsp. of cinnamon is definitely not enough!  The cinnamon flavor was very subtle, and therefore, the bread was a little flavorless.  I also only used 1/2 c. of vegetable oil.  The bread itself turned out fine.

I didn't have two loaf pans so I made muffins. I took another reviewer's advice and used 1/2 cup brown 1/2 cup white sugar. I added nutmeg as well. Even with these additions the muffins were just "eh". They're really quite tasty with butter on them but otherwise there just isn't a whole lot of taste. The time it takes to grate the zucchini isn't worth the result in my opinion which is why I won't be making this again.

This recipe was great. I added a little more zucchini and used a little less sugar, as it was sweeter than I like. Very moist. Everyone complimented on this great bread.

I was a little disappointed.  I followed the recipe completely the first time.  Way too much cinnamon and it has a cake like texture.  I prefer a moister bread.  The second time I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour, brown sugar instead of white, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/8 tsp cloves and it turned out more to my liking.  Still a good base recipe.

I followed the suggestions from other readers such as 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 2 cups of white sugar and used 1 cup of applesauce instead of 1 cup oil.  I did bake the loaves for 1 hour as stated in the recipe.  As soon as I took them out of the oven the loaves deflated in front of my eyes!  The texture was awful!  I usually always follow the recipe to the letter and after this fiasco I will ALWAYS follow the original recipe before trying the suggestions from other readers.  I was very disappointed!

THIS IS AN EXCELLENT RECIPE.  HOWEVER, I USED 1 1/2 CUPS WHITE SUGAR AND 1/2 CUP LIGHT BROWN SUGAR. I ALSO USED 2 1/2 T. CINNAMON AND 1/2 T. NUTMEG. I THINK A TOUCH OF BROWN SUGAR GIVES IT A BETTER FLAVOR AND THE NUTMEG IS MY PREFERENCE.

MMM - loved this one!  Mom brings me tons of zuch all summer, and I'm always looking for new ideas to use it up.  I followed recipe, but must admit to adding more spices tho - a little ginger, a little nutmeg, and a dash of cloves.  Big hit at family bbq last night, and roommate finished off the 2nd loaf this morning.  So much for MY portion!  :)  Good thing it's zuch season.

Nice recipe. I subbed 1 cup almond meal for  flour and 1-1/2 cups ground flaxseed for 1/2 cup oil. I also increased zucchini to 4 cups. Bread came out moist, delicious and healthier.

This recipe was great, but for someone who does not bake often, it would have been helpful to know how much batter to put in each loaf pan (as I only have one, so can only do one loaf at a time).  My husband, who hates veggies, loves this bread.  I went sans the nuts, but it was still wonderful.  Thank you for posting.

Exactly what a person is looking for in a traditional zucchini bread.  I am overrun with yellow summer squash, so that's what I used, and 2 cups of white whole wheat flour for some of the all purpose.  I also sprinkled in about 1/4 teaspoon allspice, and the whole thing was lovely.

Very good!!  I was given a HUGE bag of freshly picked zucchini and needed something to do with them.  I've made 2 batches of this bread.  One as muffins and the other as mini loaves.  Used the recipe as it is written with 2 minor modifications... I added some nutmeg and left out the walnuts.  My husband likes them alot!  He even asked if there was enough to make muffins to take to work in the morning!  A Winner!!

My bread stuck to the pan although it was possibly my fault.  I added some mini chocolate chips and they went straight to the bottom.  I did add 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  The flavor of the bread is great.

Absolutely delicious and very moist. It was very popular at my potluck. A little bit too rich to eat too much of -I'll try substituting fat-free yogurt for oil next time.

ENJOYED,My husband is a diabetic and I used 1&1/2 cups Splenda and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I added the Flax seed as suggested earlier, I was out of applesauce to replace the oil but have done that in other recipes. I did also add in a touch of ground ginger,cloves and nutmeg. I love any recipes I can use things out of our garden.

This recipe was okay.  Thought it was WAY to sweet.  Also was very sticky once cooled.  Thought it tasted best right out of the oven, but the next day did not taste good at all.

This is exactly like my grandmothers recipe that she adds a cup of chocolate chips.  This bread freezes really well.  My husband has told me to fill the freezer full so that he can have one loaf a week all winter.

Wow this Zucchini bread is amazing. It's the best I've had. Very moist and delicious. I made 4 loaves and planned on keeping just one, but I think I might just keep a second one for myself also! The only thing in the recipe I changed is added just a pinch of nutmeg as suggested by some others and I cooked them for about 53 to 55 minutes and they came out great. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I've had some really good zucchini bread, but this recipe takes the cake! Being the first time to ever make it I was so worried that I wouldnt be able to make the bread right that some how I would do something tragically wrong with the mix, but it was so easy I decided to make a double batch half way through mixing the ingredients up. Absolute best zucchini bread I've ever had, it looks beatiful it tastes great and every one who has tried it tells me how good it is. I wont use any other recipe. Thank you so much!

Just your average zucchini bread. Not sure what all the rave reviews are for.  Okay recipe, but will try another next time.

great recipe but i'd suggest adding raisins... makes it perfect.  I also think that the pans do need greased/floured.

I baked my loaves at 350 degrees for 2 hours and they were still mushy.  I'll stick with my usual recipe for that reason.

This bread is fabulous.  The only thing I would change is to grease the bottom of the pan.  I had a hard time removing the loaves from the pan (after a typical 10 minute in-the-pan cooling).  The bottoms stuck but not the sides, that's why I'd grease the bottom.

I had never tried zucchini bread before, but because the boy refused to eat zucchini any other way I went with it. I must say, this turned out great! I added chocolate chips as per other suggestions and omitted the nuts and it turned out nicely. Thanks!

This recipe was a big hit at our house.  I especially liked it because it used up more of the zucchini my husband grew in his garden!

Excellent.  I had a gigantic zucchini and so I printed off many recipes to make with it.  I made this one first, and decided it was so good, to just stick to this one.  I got great reviews from my family and boyfriend.  I made three loaves in a span of a 5 days.

My mother, whose name just happens to be Sophie, makes the very best zucchini bread.  I thought I would try this just because of the name. I wish I had stuck to my old favorite.  This was way too sweet.  Perhaps using the applesauce/sugar combination that others suggest would work better but I'm not going to try it. I'll go back to my own recipe.  Thanks for the post.

This is the same recipe I always use!  I substitute fat free sour cream for all of the oil and add raisins or chocolate chips!  It is so yummy!  I often double and make 4 loaves and pop some in the freezer to enjoy it in the middle of winter!

This had great consistency, and baked up quite nicely.  The only change I recommend is to reduce the amount of cinnamon.  I love the stuff, but the amount used here was a little overwhelming.  Otherwise, top-notch! Thanks!

Great recipe.  I made this last night and it was a hit with everyone- even the kids!  It's hard to believe that zucchini can be so good in a dessert.  I did substitute 2 stick of melted butter for the oil, and, used one cup of brown sugar and one cup of white sugar.  All in all, it is a great recipe!  Tender and moist, and great with a cup of milk!

I took this out of the oven about a half hour ago and I've already eaten two slices.  This bread is fabulous; very moist with a nice crispy crust.  I added a bit of nutmeg, substituted 1/2 a cup of brown sugar for the all the white, and made it without nuts. YUMMY.

Yummy bread. Followed the recipe exactly. Ungreased pans? I have made this twice now lightly spraying or greasing nonstick pans and still have a tough time getting them out. I definatly recommend greasing. I used 9 in pans for big loaves. Give it a try.

Great! I reduced the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon and added a pinch of nutmeg just to fit our taste. I did not put the walnuts since nuts are not allowed in daycamp and school but it would certainly be great with them (or with pecans).

Delicious!!  This is my favorite zucchini bread recipe.  This recipe makes the best-tasting bread ever!  I gave a loaf of this to a neighbor a couple of years ago, and now he gets the first two loaves out of the oven every summer.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have only one word- Yummy!!! Everyone loved it. My husband took it to work and everyone wants the recipe. It was moist and the smell is wonderful. I used 3 heaping tsp of cinnamon and added a 1/2 tsp lemon peel (the kind that comes in a spice jar) but I'm not sure if that really added much to it. To keep it healthy I just spray a little I can't believe its not butter spray on it and it tastes great. I did peel the Zucchini and then shred it. This was my first time and I couldn't find anywhere whether to peel it first or leave the skin on. Maybe others can post whether they peel first or not.

Great zucchini bread.  I added a little applesauce, as recommended by other reviewers. I think it helps keep the bread moist.  I have made it with and without nuts--both turned out beautifully.  I prefer eating it after it has cooled completely--it takes more like a sweet treat and less like a bread.

extra zucchini is the KEY to making this the best zucchini bread on allrecipes. however, i made a couple modifications.. adding brown sugar instead of all white sugar. i can't imagine a zucchini bread recipe without brown sugar. i love my zucchinni bread sweet and extra moist. i also added more cinnamon, and a touch of clove because i do that with my own recipe. this recipe is the same as mine pretty much, just it doesn't use brown sugar. great recipe.

best recipe for zucchini bread I ever tried. I lost an old recipe and have searched for years for one like it, finally found it. Got nothing but rave reviews from all friends and relatives. Don't know how anyone could say its dry. I thought it was very moist.

AWESOME!  It very much reminds me of an excellent banana bread in weight and texture.  The green flecks from the zucchini make for great presentation.  I halved the recipe to make one loaf and served four people with half the loaf left over.  Also, I used pecan pieces instead of walnuts because I just happened to have them on hand.  It turned out great!  I can't wait to make this for others!

It was good, my husband would eat it again, but it wasn't quite what we were expecting.  Very dense bread, which I don't mind.  My 2 year old son on the otherhand, LOVED this bread, I might make it again, just to get him to eat some veggies.  He was the one who made the biggest dent in the loaf.

I halfed this recipe because I only had one loaf pan, and I left out the nuts (just happened to prefer it without nuts. Turned out amazing! I took it to our bible study and it was a huge hit, even with the kids. Tons of compliments.

I was looking for a zuke bread recipe because the recipe my family has used for years is just too blah, and it always came out like a brick (at least, I thought so). I tried this recipe -- with some of the modifications others recommended -- and it WOWed everyone who tasted it. (I think the most important shared tip was squeezing out the excess water!) I doubt I'll ever replace THIS zuke bread recipe, but the family recipe has already been relegated to the BACK of the file! It's an awesome recipe that results in TERRIFIC bread.

Very good. Perfectly cooked in the hour, the loaves look great and it is really tasty, moist, not too sweet.  I used almonds instead of walnuts and added some clove as someone had suggested.  I will use this recipe again.

This turned out great! I made sure to drain the zucchini well before I added it to the rest of the ingredients and that worked well.  I didn't peel the zucchini before I grated it either and that worked out fine.  Wonderful recipe!

I thought this was quite good.  I had no loaf pans, so I had to bake it in a bundt pan, but it turned out just fine that way.  I would have liked the addition of nuts, but my son is allegic to them.  My older kids really enjoyed it, but my 3 yr old saw the zucchini, and wouldn't eat it.  I can see this will come in handy when we become overrun with zucchinis!

This was an "ok" zucchini bread.  The consistency is a little rubbery or chewy.  I've had better was it wasn't horrible.  I probably won't make this again.

Fantastic, some of the best Zucchini bread I have had.  I added about a teaspoon of allspice just to get a little more in the way of flavor.  It turned out GREAT!

This is great bread; moist with a very fine crumb.  I made it in a bundt pan (instead of two loaves) and that worked great.  You simply MUST grease the pan though.

This zucchini bread is FANTASTIC!!!  I used a cup of walnuts and a cup of raisins.  We mowed through 2 loaves in one day.  My husband, our 2 girls (6 & 8), and I loved it.  I'm planting zucchini next summer just so I can make this bread.  Thank you for sharing your recipie.
