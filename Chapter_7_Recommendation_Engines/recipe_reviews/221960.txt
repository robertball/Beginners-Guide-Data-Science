This is one of the best Beef Chili's I have encountered for a very long time. The second time around I added teaspoons of cumin and coriander powder to the chili and, instead of water I used a good quality bitter. Don't use light beers. I used dumplings instead of the chips. It was yummy, and my two daughters who are the biggest fuss budgets in the world said it was the best meal they had eaten in a long while

Too spicy for my hubby but the rest of us thought it was great!  The meat was very tender!  I used the beef broth that came from browning the meat in place of the water.  I did have to add a little water to make the 1 1/4 cups.  I also added canned beans, light red kidney and chili beans after it was done, and just cooked it a few minutes before serving.

I recently purchased a WP electric pressure cooker & I'm having a great time with it.  Made this & pretty much stuck to the recipe.
Instead of water I added V8. No corn chips so I thickened it with 
instant potato flakes. I also added a can of drained & rinsed kidney beans. For leftovers I added a small amount of pasta for Chili mac.
Chili is always a good comfort food. When grandkids are over I add
canned or frozen corn.  Depends on what"s on hand.

This recipe is a KEEPER!!! Thank you so much, Chef John. This has really hit the spot for my chili fix today. I made this earlier and it was perfect, so easy to make. I also made your recipe for Tzaziki sauce to go on top of it!

By the way, I had to tweak the spice down because my dad can't handle hot food. If you can't handle those spicy chili powders that he adds, just use plain chili powder only. I also increased the cumin and oregano just a touch, to counteract the other missing chili powder flavors. I also used beef broth instead of the water as well. That was just my preference, is all. 

Enjoy guys, this is something you'll never regret making. People at my culinary school would love to eat this.

I don't need to prepare this recipe to know that, after cooking AZ Green Chile - Chile con Carne (de Res) - for decades, that this'll be excellent! I can tell just by seeing the essential ingredients! Note for others: The corn chips need to be ground to replace otherwise available corn "masa" (or wheat flour roux in AZ) The tomatoes are okay, even trace amounts in Green Chile, but I'd experiment reducing that. I concur with one cook who added more cumin, and I'd make sure I used plenty of black pepper. Of course, even though it would drastically change the outcome, this AZ guy'd add lots of chunked green chiles, i.e., roasted & peeled green New Mexicos or Poblanos! Maybe we could experiment w/ canned red or green enchilada sauce, too. However, even I would make this recipe as written by John first to get a good baseline - and to enjoy it!

This is a pretty easy and tasty chili to make. However, it was way too spicy. I'm going to scale back on the recommended amount of spice next time I prepare this.

I loved this chili and will use the recipe often.  Hubby thought that it was too spicy for him but not for me.  Really bold flavors and so easy to make.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  By the way I did add a can of beans because we do love beans in chili.

I'm an Arizona lady, been making green chile all my life. This is a very good recipe, very close to what my abuelita (grandma) taught me. Just a reminder: green chilies and jalapenos are two very different products. Be careful; it is possible to burn yourself with hot peppers. I added two 7 oz. cans of Ortega brand diced green chilies to my batch. Nummy.

Wonderful recipe.. a little dry, so added 1 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes... did not ruin the flavor... as I thought it was a little spicy for me... husband prefers the original... One of the best recipes ever... Going to try it at our next club campout.

Really good.  No mods to the recipe, but I would eaither add beans (cannellini or black) or Anaheim chilis next time.  Need a bit more complexity in this recipe.

the recipe was easy to follow but it was so spicy it was unedible. I'm going to try to readjust the spices and try again.

I added 2 cans of crushed tomatoes, (didn't read directions and already had opened cans...) and just threw in some more spices. It was delicious.  Also used sirloin steak that I cut up myself, very tender.  This chili has great flavor, different than the classic hamburger and kidney bean chili, I like it and my son said he prefers this one and he was a regular chili fan.  Gave 4 of 5 stars, only bc as written it doesn't make very much.

hands down best chili I ever made.   I have an new instant pot which made this a very easy recipe.  I followed other comments and cut down on the spices, and it was perfect.   For good health I did shred about a cup full of zucchini and added it with the onions and garlic.   zucchini adds some good nutrition and fibre from this under rated fruit! 

It will be my go to chili recipe!

Browned more like 2 onions and  3.5 lbs of meat in skillet. Added 2 cans tomato paste, 2 cans of small tomato sauce. Cooked it down with the meat. Added spiced to oil in pressure cooker pot and cooked for a few min on stove first stirring seasoning into the oil. Added 2 cups of broth instead of water to scape up seasonings. Then added the meat to that Insta pot. Put Pot back in Pressure cooker unit and after 25 min, very tender and delicious (said my family - I don’t eat meat, but they do). Cooked rice on side. Green paper garnish and sour cream garnish super to “cool off” the spiced nature of this one. Used left over to make yummy sandwiched on good crusty bread, with cheddar cheese, peppery arugula.

This is the first Chef John recipe I haven't given five stars.  I followed the recipe to a T.  The chili had some heat, but a really "flat" flavor.  Won't be making it again.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time. It was a bit hot eating it plain, but after garnishing it with cheese or sour cream it sweetened back to just having a nice kick. When I added all the spices to the onions, garlic, and oil, it got kind of clay-like and I had to add a little more oil. Second time making it I added one can of pinto and one can of kidney beans. I drained the liquid from both cans into a measuring cup, then added water to that to get to the 1.25 cup that the recipe specified. The starchy bean water thickened the broth a bit.  I might experiment adding a little cocoa powder or some roasted corn. Will definitely keep this as a base recipe and tweak it according to my mood.

This dish is perfect for a cold winter day. Made a couple changes, mainly lowering the heat index. Added extra tomatoes, sliced carrots and a bag of frozen corn.  Topped with shredded cheese and cilantro. If my avocados were ready would have added that. Cooked on the stove top for about 3 hours and it came out perfect! Next time I will try my crockpot. Will keep this one for sure!

What a great recipe!  Because I'm whimpy about spicy stuff, I did cut back on the cayenne pepper just a smidge, and added more of the chili powders, I seasoned the cubed meat with salt and pepper, then I used my instant pot and seared the meat in a little olive oil first, then sauteed  the onions and garlic, then added the dry seasonings. I set the pot to manual for 15 minutes and then let it natural release for 10 minutes. Turned out really well.

This is the best chili recipe I've made so far. I use the instant pot for this. The only thing I changed was to use 1 tsp chili powder and 1/4 tsp cayenne because the original recipe is pretty insane with the chili. I also add 2 cans of diced tomatoes w/green chile and 1 can of pinto and 1 can of kidney beans, drained, because I like beans in my chili. After the 15 minutes cook time, just manually release pressure,  season with a little more salt and it's perfect.

5 stars for the basic recipe and pressure-cooker concept. This was awesome! I did sub regular chili powder for the chipotle, and used a bottle of dark lager to deglaze after browning my meat (which I had lightly floured). Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was so very good! I improvised a little just because I didn't have the required amount of meat, and held back on a little of the chili powder (used 1 1/2 of the first, and omitted the second as I didn't have any chipotle chili powder).  We like heat, but I knew this was going to be a bit more than we usually enjoy. I added a can of black beans, and we ate it over rice topped with sour cream. I think next time I will plan ahead and have more meat on hand, use all 2 Tbs of chili powder (skipping the chipotle, and adding some home made adobo seasoning) as the rice and sour cream 'cooled' it down.  The taste was excellent; so satisfying for a fast throw-together meal! Thanks, Chef John!

This was super easy to make and super delicious. I do not look at this a Chili but more as a Chili Colorado,  I suggest trying it with warm flour tortilla's. A definite keeper.

Great recipe for pressure cooker chili. It has replaced my previous favorite due to its work-to-flavor ratio. I've made it several times now, starting with the base recipe and then tweaking as I go. Each time, it never fails to deliver an excellent dinner. We like beans so I usually add a can of pinto and a can of black beans at the end with the corn chips. The chili can be a bit spicy for delicate palates (i.e. My 11 year old daughter) as written but it's relatively easy to adjust the spice level by changing the amount of the chili powders or even the type of Rotel Tomatoes used (regular, spicy, or plain diced). As I continue to play with my pressure cooker, this recipe will continue to be in my rotation.

Wow this was the first thing I made with my first PC. Loved it. I really really tried to stick to the recipe as written. With that said I did add two cans of rinsed kidney beans (just personal preference) and I had to replace the garlic with intense onion powder. Served with shredded cheese, green onion and corn bread. It was really fun and delish. Thank you Chef John for this recipe!

After reading other reviews, I cut back on the spices but it was still too  hot so I added tomato paste and broth.  For us, it was still too hot.  Flavor was good but just too much heat.

Okay I did make some changes, as I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used 1.5 pounds ground beef and one can of black beans.   I didn't have chipotle powder, so I used a healthy 2 TBSP Adobo sauce and 3 chipotle peppers, that I pureed with the water.   I didn't have a can of tomatoes with green chilies, so I used 1/2 cup medium salsa and 2 TBSP tomato paste.  I skipped the corn chips, I am trying to eat low carb...  I can now say it turned out pretty good, a little spicy, but it is chili!!!  Great recipe and I'd make it again and continue to experiment with it.  I love using the pressure cooker and it makes things like chili taste like you let them slow cook all day, when it takes less than 30 minutes to make!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe

I'm surprised I didn't like it... I like so many other recipes by Chef John. Most of the beef was chewy, the heat was at the end, but flavorless at first taste.

Great quick dinner! I used ground sirloin for the meat and added shredded cheese; it turned out really good. Next time, I will add kidney beans. I will be making this again.

I haven't tried this recipe but for Tomboltic you made the chili hotter with your change. Ancho chilies are dried poblanos a relatively mild chilie. Chipoltlies are  much hotter.

I have been pressure cooking chili for many years.  I use the 21 quart canner, mix up a full canner load and bring it up to 15# before turning off the heat.  When the pressure drops, I immediately fill my wide mouth jars and can up about 14-18 quarts or so, saving the remainder for the for the current meal of two.  Because the pressure cooked chili was jarred immediately, it can then be canned by just bringing the canner up to 10# for about 10 minutes.  The greatest caution is the impulse to over fill the jars.  That alone has been the cause of losses of canned chili.  This process also works with pork, venison, elk and mutton varying the spices as you desire.

instead of the ancho chili powder, we used about 2 teaspoons of chipotle chili powder.  I like it hot, but this was really pushing it.  I also used a bit more than a pound of ground venison.  I froze it, and then cut it into chunks and browned those.  It came out in nice chunks.  To make up for the less meat, I used some red kidney beans.  Wife liked it, but it had some good heat!  I'll cut back on the chili powder even more next time.  Served with shredded cheddar and sour cream.  It'll be nice reheated for lunch on a cold day!
