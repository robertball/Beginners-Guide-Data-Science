I thought this was really good, but had to downgrade a bit since my 3 and 4 year old kids, and their 3 year old friend, would not eat them.  Maybe that's because the texture is different than what the kids are used to (soft but top layer is crunchy).  I picked this recipe since it has a bit of nutrition to it - peanut butter, cereal.  At least that's what I told myself as I wolfed them down.  Note that these bars probably would not travel well, since the top layer softens easily in warm weather.

Made these for years, always a hit.   The bottom layer is meant to be thin, this is not a cake.  Also, it is very easy to overbake the bottom layer, put the marshmallows on when it isn't quite done.  Also, this recipe was first published in the March 1979 issue of Better Homes & Gardens.

I thought these were really good as did everyone that tried one, the only change I made at the time was to  add about an extra half cup of marshmallow to the layer for a nice even coating...however, next time I make I will make a couple of changes..I didn't think the peanut butter came through enough and would add peanut butter chips to the brownie layer, would also increase the brownie layer by half as it seemed a bit thin, I would also add more crispies to the top layer for extra crunch

I've had this recipe for years now, and never got to trying it  until yesterday. However, this recipe belongs to Nestle and cooks.com was where I got it from. Anyway, it is really delicious. Omitted the nuts due to personal preference. Perfect texture and taste. Everyone loved it! I looove the crisp of the rice cereal with the chewyness of the marshmallows paired with the chocolatey flavor, yummmmmmmmmmmmmm!

Awesome recipe!!! I used a small jar of Marshmallow Cream since I didn't have the marshmallows on hand and still turned out great. Kids loved them.

YUM! I have been making this same recipe since I was in high school (late 80's). Our home-economics teacher had us make them once and I have been addicted ever since! I still make this recipe on occasion and noone has ever complained!

I wanted to try this recipe only because I had all the ingredients in the house. I halved the recipe and baked the cake portion in an 8x8 pyrex pan. I also did not have any marshmallows and used marshmallow fluff and it came out great. The whole thing tasted really delish. I hope it still tastes good tomorrow....thank you for this recipe.

My husband and I really liked these bars.  The only reason I did not rate them a 5 was because I felt that the "brownie" part was too bland and cakey.  My husband loved them though!

I have been making these for years, it is one of our family's traditional Christmas bars, in fact.  I use 2 cups Chunky Peanut Butter though, and a bit more chocolate chips than just one cup.

I would have liked it if the bottom layer weren't so 'fluffy,' rather more chewy or crust-like, but the recipe was still delicious and we really enjoyed it.

Very sweet but tasty. I liked the 2 different textures unlike some people. Overall I think this is a quick dessert/snack that will satisfy the sweet tooth with a big, cold glass of milk.

This is an excellent recipe - I have made this several times & everyone always asks for the recipe. I like the suggestion that another reviewer made about using marshmellow cream instead of actual marshmellows - turned out excellent!

This is a great chocolaty treat!  If it is too time consuming mixing all the ingredients of the bottom brownie layer....I just substitute a boxed brownie mix, baked according to the directions on the box, and then top it off with the marshmallow, pb/choc, krispie topping!

Pretty good, but not excellent.  I brought it to a family gathering and the kids really liked them.  I don't know why the recipe has the name "Crumble" in it, they are more crispy than crumbly.

Finally an easy recipe for all occasions that turned out prefect. My kids and husband loved these and next time I think I'll get the kids to make them since they both love to bake. I did everything exactly the way the recipe says and it turned out great.

These may be the best bars I've ever tasted!  They come together very quickly, as well.  As recommended by others, I used a brownie mix and baked for 4 minutes less than recommended.  I used slightly more mini-marshmallows then the recipe calls for -- probably about 2 1/2 cups, enough to cover the top without any large gaps.  I returned to the oven for about 4 minutes.  As the marshmallows melt, they puff up and cover the space in between.  I think this was much easier than trying to use marshmallow cream would have been.  I let it cool for about an hour, then topped with the peanut  butter/chocolate chip/crisp rice cereal mixture.  I put the whole thing in the freezer for about an hour, then cut into bars.  They are very rich!  I recommend cutting into smaller-sized bars.  I think these taste much better when they're chilled, so recommend keeping them in the refrigerator or freezer, as directed in the recipe.

Increased the brownie base by 1/2, baked it for 20 min. I increased the peanut butter by 1 scoop and melted in microwave in 3.5 min.  I increased the crisps to 2 cups

The top 2 layers are really yum! But the brownie was a little bland & cakey texture. Next time I'll prob make my favorite brownie batter as the base. Taste better after chilled.

Made these (followed recipe exactly) for a bake sale and they sold out in record time. Everyone seemed to love them.  Got many recipe requests.  Also tried it with 2 separate substitutions for my husband who doesn't like peanut butter that much! Used 1 cup Biscoff cookie spread OR a combination of heavy cream plus butter instead of the peanut butter.  Both were delicious as well.

These taste delicious but take FOREVER to make.  I enjoyed them once but would not put in the effort to make them again.

YUM!  I made a couple of deviations only because of what I had on hand.  I used extra crunchy peanut butter and cocoa pebbles in place of the plain rice cereal.  They were SO good!!

The only thing I don't like about it is that it has to be refrigerated. Really tasty though!
