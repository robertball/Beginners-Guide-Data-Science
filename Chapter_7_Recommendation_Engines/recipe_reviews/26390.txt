As a chili seasoning this does not work for me because it is missing the Cumin, a necessary ingredient for chili and southwestern dishes.  and the use of seasoned salt and pepper is very strange indeed.  there are so many different varieties of seasoned salt and pepper.  however, as an everyday seasoning, using plain salt and pepper, it is good.

Great as a place to start, but WAY too salty for our tastes. About half the amount called for is better for us. I left out the thyme and oregano (those don't go in chili in this house), and added 1Tbsp cocoa powder (that ALWAYS goes in chili in this house). Once we "fixed" it it was delicious!

This worked perfectly for me. I'm in a location where I can't find pre-packaged Chili Seasoning Mixes and this did the trick! I found the amounts to be a good start and allowed me to feel more confident in altering the flavors of the chili I was making. I made extra, placing in little jars and gave it to the people who attended the gathering, with a list of suggested uses. It was a big hit.

This mix is OK if you are in a pinch and need chili seasoning mix quickly, but I prefer to just buy it and not have to make it.

Just fixed this with some combo lean ground turkey/ground beef for a healthier chili. I'm on a diet program right now with very specific requirements and as much as I want to lose the weight, I hate giving up foods that I love and eating food that "feels like" diet food. This was perfect for the chili that made, with that little bit of heat to give it a good kick. Hubby even loved it, lean ground turkey and all.

I only used about a tablespoon of the mix for 7 oz. of meat mixed with tomatoes, onions, etc. Next time I may add some cumin to the mix and cut back on the season salt. One thing I did was after everything had been prepared, I sprinkled a little powdered stevia on top and folded it in. It was a nice touch which makes me think I'll do it again.

Either way, thanks for this great recipe!

Tried it when I realized I was out of chili seasoning... NOT a fan. Way too salty and it's missing something... must be the cumin as others stated.

Made this to go into the "bangin steak rub" from this site, which was an awesome rub for our steaks.  I am going to try this in chili soon.  How can it be chili seasoning mix without any chili powder?

I used this in my chili that I normally make and it was the blandest I have ever made. I won't make this again. I will try to doctor it to use in a different batch.

It was tasty, but not the best I've tasted.  Going to add chili powder next time.  It is just the right amount for one recipe of chili beans con carne.

This is the lifeblood of my chili.  I also use it as taco and fajita  seasoning.

As an uptick, I often use Tasefully Simple seasoning salt, onion onion, and garlic garlic in replace of the corresponding ingredients, adjusting each up by 1/2 tsp as they're a larger grind initially.  I also give everything a quick pulse in a food processor to get it all to one level of powder.  The Eight Demon Bag is always a winner.

I loved it!!!  I reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp  as I am not into too much heat and added 1 Tablespoon ground cumin.  I used 4 Tablespoons of this mix in the "Caveman Chili" recipe on this site instead of the packaged chili seasoning--I'm Keto so this was a winning recipe to stay on track and it tasted great!  I also adjusted the cooking instructions a bit--I used the my instant pot on saute for the meat and veggies and then the slow cooker function--with vent open and on low temp when I added all of the ingredients to the pot.  My husband who isn't Keto enjoyed this spice mix in the Caveman Chili.

I liked it, thought it had really good flavor. I didn't use the flour because I don't add water, just what's in my stewed tomato cans. Some of the other reviews are pretty unfair. Like, why would you make this recipe if you know you like cumin in your chili, but this recipe obviously doesn't have cumin. You can't give it 2 stars for that.

Seasoning was great! I browned 1 lb of ground chuck. Added seasoning, 2 cans of mild Ro-tel, 1 large can of tomato sauce and about 1 tbsp of chili powder. Tasted perfect. I love how spicy it is with the cayenne. Great seasoning!!

My wife & I recently cut out all gluten and Wheat Flour in our diet. We were totally surprised how many products that uses Enriched flour products as  thickening agent or binder. Chili mixes, "Chili-Beans".  SO I love chili all the year round, and was not going to give it up. This seasoning is SPOT ON!!!  First time right out of the gate... BINGO!!  WOW!!  PERFECT!!  I could go on, but I think you get the point. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE!!

This one is really good but I add Cumin and exchange GROUND cayenne pepper with just regular crushed red pepper flakes, but still a great start for the flavor direction I was trying to achieve!

Really good. Used this for the Debdoozie's Blue Ribbon Chili recipe. 

Substituted red pepper - like the kind they set out at pizza joints - for the cayenne, and ignored the seasoned pepper, figured that substitution would make it spicy enough.  It was great!
