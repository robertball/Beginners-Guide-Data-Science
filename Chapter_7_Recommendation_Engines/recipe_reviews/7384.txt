Fantastic cheesecake!!  I did have some trouble melting the chocolate, so the 2nd time I made this cheesecake, I just melted the chocolate in the microwave and stirred the 2 Tb. of cream in with with sour cream.  I also combined the 1/4c.water, instant coffee and liqueur & put in the microwave til it was hot.  By doing this, you avoid overmixing the batter and warms the batter slightly so the chocolate blends easier!   Great recipe and I really enjoyed making it!!!  Thanks!!

I have made this cheesecake at least a dozen times and my family and friends request it all the time!!!  I make a few modifications: instead of instant coffee dissolved in hot water, I use 1/4 c. espresso for a little stronger coffee flavor.  If you don't have an espresso machine, you can pick up an espresso at the coffee shop.  I also use 1 1/2 times the crust recipe so that the crust is a bit thicker and I can press it halfway up the sides of my springform pan.  I also buy a 16 oz. container of whipping cream and use the remainder (after using 2 Tbsp to melt the chocolate) to make the whipped cream, which means I double the powdered sugar and coffee liquer.

I can't say enough good things about this recipe!

This is a wonderful cheesecake that is easy to make.  I make a cup of expresso instead of instant coffee and then I melt some dark chocolate in a small amount of whipping cream and pour it over the cooled cake.  It hardens and forms a delicious crust.

Wonderful cheesecake!  I made a few changes including doubling the crust portion, otherwise I thought it would be too thin and used 1/2 cup strong coffee (4 tsp instant coffee in 1/2 c. water) for the coffee and coffee liquer.  I also used strong coffee in the cream portion and increased the amount of sugar (times 3) to make it sweeter.  It got raves and I will definitely make it again!

This was good the first day, but excellent the next, so I would recommend 24 hours for the cheesecake flavors to meld.  I subsituted 4 t instant coffee, disolved in 1/2 a cup of whipping creaam for the coffee and coffee liquer the recipe calls for.  I used chocolate sandwich cookies for the crust and would either use more cookies or less butter the next time, I think chocolate grahams would work better than the sandwich cookies though.  I melted the chocolate in the microwave with no problems.  All in all, excellent recipe.

I made this as a piece of an insanely decadent birthday cake for my husband, so I divided the batter in half and baked it in an 8" spring form- the resulting cakes were maybe 2" thick, so it makes a nice, thick cheesecake. Because I made it thinner/smaller, it didn't have to bake as long (about 30 min). I used 1/2 cup of espresso instead of the liquor and instant coffee and I sweetened it using concentrated fruit juice. I also used low far cream cheese. The chocolate seized with the cream (I used it anyways) and it still smoothed out in the batter. 

The cheesecake turned out fantastic. The final product is really only as good as the chocolate and coffee you use though, so don't skimp and buy cheap stuff. I'd recommend melting the chocolate alone (without the cream) and then just add the cream alongside the sour cream. 

I will make this many times over, I'm sure. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I have made cheesecakes before and this one included is awesome.  Here is some things I did to make this come out the way I wanted.  I used Graham Crackers instead of chocolate cookies.  I greased and floured the spring form pan as well as placed wax paper on the bottom.  I also cooked the cake in a water bath to prevent cracking.  I baked it for 50 minutes.  I checked to see if it was done by tapping lightly on the side to see if it jiggled like jello.  If it does then it is done. I left it in the oven with the door closed for another 50 minutes.  I then removed cake and chilled overnight.  To remove the cake from the pan I took a boning knife and placed it in HOT water and wiped it off.  I gently cut around the edges slowly to loosen the cake from the pan.  I repeated this method until I could get my knife all the way under the cake without disturbing the crust.  Always dip the knife in the HOT water and wipe it off before make another attempt at loosening the cake.  I also took that same knife and cut around the side of the pan to loosen the cake.  Again, I dipped my knife in HOT water and wiped it off and then began the slow cuts.  If your cake cracks then take a frosting knife, dip in HOT water, wipe it off and smooth over the cracks no one will know, PROMISE.  You can sprinkle the ground up crust mixture over the top to change it up a bit.  ENJOY

I love this cheesecake, and so do everyone else who have tasted it!  This was the first cheesecake of any kind that I ever tried to make, and it turned out PERFECTLY!  Everyone thought I bought it from a bakery.  I used espresso instead of strong coffee, and I baked it in a water bath.  It took 3 hours to make.

I see that most of the comments with less than 5 stars have the problem of the chocolate seizing up in common.  Chocolate seizes on a double boiler because moisture gets into the mix (steam from the lower pan).  If your chocolate seizes up, add butter a little bit at a time until it smooths out again.  That will solve the seizing problem.

I could only rate this a 4 because my chocolate kept siezing.  I must have done something wrong with it, but I tried it three times.  I melted 8 oz. semi sweet chocolate and 2 tbsp. whipping cream over a double boiler with boiling water and it started to melt ok, but then it would sieze before it was all melted.  I tried also to melt it over simmering water instead and it siezed again.  So, I just used melted chocolate and did not add all of the whipping cream and it was still ok.  Any ideas would be appreciated.

The cake was indeed sinful but was way too soft. Needed to be firmer and I chilled for 24 hours before eating. Almost impossible to serve, just collasped. Delicious though! I used oreo cookies and 3Tbsp of butter for the crust. I also had trouble with the crust sticking to the sides even though I buttered it. Thank God for the whipped cream to fix the flaws.

I have made this cheesecake 3 times now. Everyone who has tried this cake has raved about it. It deserves 10 stars. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of doubling the crust. I believe the cake needs to cook 5 minutes longer. It was slightly undercooked each time. This time (I just put one in the oven) I will cook it for 50 minutes. I believe there are some tricks for making a successful cheesecake: 1) Make sure all of your ingredients are at room temp, 2) Cook the cake in a water bath. It will prevent cracking, 3) Melt the chocolate slowly (I use the microwave) and heat the whipping cream separately and then mix. My family always requests this for special occasions. You won't be disappointed!

this made 32 cupcake sized cheesecakes.  I dropped an oreo in the bottom of each cupcake paper and baked for just over 20 minutes.  Wonderful.

Delious! I made some small changes cause I had to. I used oreo chocolate cream filled cookies cause I can't get plain chocolate wafer cookies over here, I used the whole package and used about half the cream from the cookies, left out the cinnamon and sugar but still used 1/4c of the butter. This gave it a thicker crust and it held together which I wasn't sure that it would. I also was worried that the cooking time was to short, I used a 9inch springform pan and on the bottom rack I did place a waterbath, I have never cooked a cheesecake without a waterbath so was worried about not having a cheesecake in one and I know some people cook their cheesecakes in the water while others say just put a pan of water in the oven when preheating and leave it there while it cooks. I did this one with the pan under, when I cook a cheesecake IN the waterbath I always had trouble with water leaking into the crust, no matter how many times I wrapped the cake pan in foil (I think the pan was crappy replaced it we shall see). I did replace the instant coffee with 1/4c espresso cause I love coffee and I used french vanilla Kahula liqueur. The cooking time was right on! Infact I bet I could of turned off the oven about 5 mins sooner, cause it cracked slightly, I made a chocolate ganache and poured it over the cheesecake and that hid that crack. The coffee flavor was not overpowering at all, almost hard to taste it actually. Loved it and I will make it again!!

This cheesecake is fabulous.  I do have to say that when using a 9" pan, it takes a little more than the 45 minute baking time, probably closer to 55 minutes, but no matter, it is FANTASTIC EVERY time.  I do add just a few tablespoons of flour for our high altitude, but otherwise, I follow this recipe to a tee.  Delicious.

My hubby was cross-eyed over this valentine!! What a RICH taste, the eight-dollar-a-slice kind. Texture was perfect; the key is room temperature ingredients and careful mixing. Leaving it in the oven meant NO cracks! I had to use unsweetened chocolate, so I added an extra 1/2 cup of sugar; it was perfect, but gave me the freedom to do less, as I prefer bittersweet chocolate. Plain whipped cream is all we used on top. Finally, I really liked the cinnamon in the crust; it offset the flavors nicely. Two bites for me, but perfect for the die-hard coffee/chocoholic like my hunka hubby!

Just received the word from my husband and his co-workers that I made this for that this was the best cheesecake they've ever had!  I've personally made them several kinds in the past, so I know they've tried some good recipes too...  They said it was silky and a perfect balance of flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly, using kahlua and instant coffee, except I used chocolate graham crackers instead of chocolate cookies.  I also added the melted chocolate to the cream cheese/sugar before I added the eggs (because I thought that would help lessen the beating time).  I lined the springform with aluminum foil and baked it in a water bath (a jelly roll pan half filled with hot water) for 45 minutes.  After that, I only opened the door long enough and wide enough to PEEK to see if the sides were set.  As they were, I closed the oven door and let the cake cool inside for another hour and 10 minutes.  Then I cracked the door open for about 20 more minutes before I refrigerated.  There was not a single crack.  Well, I guess I will have to hang up my apron because I'll never be able to top this recipe with anything else!  Thank you so much for sharing this perfect recipe.

I won the Grand prize at the church cake-off with this recipe. I did modify it but only because I didn't have the exact ingredients. I also baked it in a water bath and turned the oven off after 45 minutes and left it in the oven for another 45 minutes.

I had some trouble with this recipe. First, their was not enough crust to cover the pan so after making what the recipe originally calls for, I had to cut the crust recipe in half and make it again. That made enough. I also recommend melting the butter, it makes it much easier to mix. I too had trouble getting the chocolate to melt. As soon as I added it to the cheesecake batter it became lumpy. Does it need to cool a bit? The recipe doesn't say. I did serve this the day after making it and I thought it tasted just OK. Honestly, it was a little bit bitter and needed more sugar. I also couldn't taste any coffee flavor. I don't know that I would make this again. Something was off.

I have made this about a dozen times...I am a novice baker and have never had an issue with it...other than it does need to cook about 5 to 10 minutes longer.  In the past, I have forgot the coffee and water, I have forgot the coffee brandy and have over mixed etc.  It still comes out great.  I also make a chocolate graham crust instead. For those of you who have an issue with melting the chocolate, the recipe says to melt it over boiling water.  To melt the chocolate over water, boil the water then turn it down low. The water should not touch the top pot/bowl nor bubble out. (I use a Pyrex dish over a pot) Break the chocolate into tiny pieces, put it into the bowl, put it on the simmer pot, with a whisk keep moving/stirring it and add the cream just as it starts to soften. Once melted, lift out the bowl (have a towel handy to quickly wipe the moisture off the bowl exterior, put it into your batter and mix in.  DO this quickly, then immediately add the 1/4 water with instant coffee already mixed into it to the batter...make sure the instant coffee mixture is HOT... it will finish melting any tiny bits of chocolate that did not totally melt.
You can work on perfecting your cheesecake making if you are going after presentation..but this recipe is fantastic no matter what....and if you mess up...no ONE will know the difference!  The taste hides newbie baking! DO NOT BE AFRAID!!!!  Even with my mess-ups, this is often requested, also been offered $$ to make it for others!

I decided that this would be my first cheesecake.  I was so nervous that it wasn't going to come out right that I did a ton of research on how to make it.  I made 1.5 batch of crust because I like mine a little thicker.  I added the eggs as the last ingredient, and I baked it at 325 for an hour and 15 minutes in a water bath.  It did not crack, which pleased me greatly.  I also skipped the whipped cream on top, and went with a chocolate glaze instead ( a recipe I also got on here).    As for taste, very good, delicious even.  I wish it was a bit more of a full bodied cheesecake.  I like mine a bit more dense, this one came out very creamy.  I think that's a matter of personal taste though.  I think next time I will skip the coffee liquor and just use all coffee to kick up the coffee flavor, because it was a bit hard to detect.  And I am going to add just a little flour to try for that more full bodied consistency I prefer.    I highly recommend this cheesecake.  I am looking forward to serving it to friends tomorrow.

Very good.  Used a cup of water in the oven & it turned out perfectly.  I don't think it needs the coffee flavored whip...good with just plain whipping cream would be enough.   Also, plan to make the day before as it is much better the next day.  Overall....huge hit!

DOUBLE THE CRUST- 
I've made this cake 3 times. Once as written & twice with my low-cal version. Great reviews each time.
I used a Splenda blend for all of the sugar to cut the sugar cals in 1/2.  I used 2 pkgs Neufchatel cream cheese and 1 fat free pkg. I used fat free 1/2&1/2 inplace of the heavy cream in melting the choc. I used reduced fat sourcream.  For the cup of heavy cream I used 2/3 cup heavy cream with 1/3 cup fat free 1/2&1/2. Then I baked it for 50 min. in a water bath before shutting down the oven.

This seriously reduced the calorie content without sacrificing taste.  It's also true if you let it chill over night before serving.

This is my husbands new favorite. I changed the crust  to be gluten free by using toasted pecans instead of cookie crumbs. Melt 1/2 cup of butter, toss pecans in it. Lay flat on a cookie sheet and toast in the oven at 250 for about an hour. When cooled, chop fine. I leave out the butter in the crust. It actually tastes better than the original, it's the only way I make it now.

I made this for a staff Christmas party and everyone raved about it.  Making it was a bit stressful because: 1) the melted chocolate formed soft lumps as soon as I poured it into the batter - I saw this happened to another reviewer. 2) after cooling, I had about 2 tbsp of congealed butter that had leaked through the springform pan from the crust.  I don't know why. I hand-squeezed out the chocolate lumps (it hadn't seized).  As per other reviewers, I upped the crust 1.5 times (good idea), baked it at 325 for 1 hour (only 1 small crack), used 1/2 c espresso instead of the liqueur/coffee and microwaved the chocolate, added the cream after and let it cool a few minutes. Would I make this again?  Definitely.  It took me about 3 hours from start to finish!  I served it with raspberries and chocolate curls on top.

So I cheated and bough Nilla crusts. and the ingredients made about 2 cheesecakes. Also I used mexican cream instead of sour cream and Kahlua for the coffee flavored liqueur. And doubled the amount of Kahlua. I had no problems mixing although it made it easier if the cream cheese was super softened. I've made about 6 of these since the holidays and once it was gone before I even got to taste.Fantastic recipe

This recipe turned out exactly as promised-creamy, rich and delicious! I normally don't like chocolate cheesecakes, but this one was to die for! My guests all raved. I also used espresso in place of the coffee and liquor in the base. For the whipped cream, I used rum extract instead of liquor. I will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe! A couple notes- I did pre-bake the crust to make sure it didn't get soggy. I didn't have liqueur, so I subbed in more espresso. I used giradelhi choc chips, & melted the leftover 3 ozs for a drizzled garnish after it was baked. Whipped cream comes in handy to fill in any cracks, but I preheated the oven with a roasting pan of boiling water on the rack below, & my cake turned out perfect. Seriously, I got sooo many compliments- people asked if I was a professional!

Perfect cheesecake!  I did add 1/2 cup espresso instead of the coffee liquer and instant coffee because I did not have either of those items on hand.  I cooked my cheesecake in a water bath, so I am not sure if that messed up the cooking time or not.  The cheesecake was just a tiny bit too soft in the middle, but it may have been due to the water bath and not the 45 minute bake time.  Next time I will definitely cook it for an extra 10 minutes. Loved the recipe, perfect blend of chocolate, coffee (even those who "hate" coffee loved it) and the cinnamon was a nice, subtle touch.  **One more thing, I have melted chocolate lots of times... adding the whipping cream was not a good idea.  The chocolate got too thick.  It's easier to melt without the whipping cream as it will stay smooth and easy to blend.  Next time I will just melt the chocolate without the cream and add the cream to the mixture instead.

I am usually not a fan of cheesecake, but I loved, loved, loved this recipe.  I used TGIFriday's mudslide mixer instead of Kahlua (no alcohol, so you get almost the same flavor for less than half the price), and I doubled it.  I baked the crust for about 5 minutes and let sit while I was making the cake part so it would set up better.  I would also double the crust portion of the recipe next time if using a 10" pan... I used 1.5 the amount and it was still a challenge to make sure every part of the bottom was covered.

I have made this recipe twice, and it gets rave reviews!  There are a couple of things I do to enhance this already great cheesecake.  I double the crust to give it a nice, thick bottom.  I don't have instant coffee on hand, so I just made some really strong coffee and used that.  I also added about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter, and then sprinkled some on top of the finished product for that real "cappuccino" feel.  I baked it for the designated time in a water bath and then turned off the oven, left the oven door slightly ajar, and let the cheese cake sit for another 45 minutes.  This turned out the perfect cheesecake that friends and family ask for again and again.

I made this as a birthday cake for my boyfriend and it was lovely. I used dark chocolate and I find that gives it the right amount of sweetness. I suggest doubling the crust as the crust to cheese ratio was kind of unbalanced - there was very little crust compared to the rest of the batter. Also, make sure you grease the pan and bottom to ensure that the crust comes out nicely. I suggest lining the pan with parchment paper on the bottom and on the sides to get a beautiful shape. 

Other tips: MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS AT ROOM TEMPERATURE! This is critical for a smooth and lump-free batter. Also, I baked it in a water bath for 45 minutes and left the cake in the oven with it turned off. No cracks whatsoever and the whole cake was very smooth. I think the sour cream really helped with the texture. I also used espresso instead of instant coffee powder which gives it a subtle coffee flavour. I topped it with some dark chocolate shavings and raspberries and it was just so yummy and decadent. I really recommend this recipe for parties or just if you want to impress people. :)

I followed this recipe exactly and the result was a delicious cheesecake, if you like the mousse-like type of cheesecake, you would think this was the no-bake type of cheesecake:). I wouldn't add the cinnamon on the chocolate crust, I'm not sure if it didn't work our because i used Oreo as my crust. Another problem was the part where i melt the chocolate with the whipped cream, i do not know why it became a paste, i have melted chocolates a lot of times but this was the first time it became a paste, at first i thought water was accidentally mixed in while i was melting it so i redo everything but still ended the same result. So there were lumps of chocolates in my batter, if this occurred to you as well, its okay:). I don't mind the chunks of chocolates, i actually strained mine and in the end added the chocolate chunks:), it turned out to be wonderful:), and added a new flavor and texture to my cheesecake:):):)

Amazing. I suggest adding more instant coffee, as it was more "mocha" tasting. I made a chocolate-kahlua ganache for the top and decorated with chocolate covered espresso beans. yum yum.

LOVE the texture of this cheesecake. The sour cream makes it more creamy and less dense than most cheesecakes. It was light yet rich at the same time, and not overly sweet. We all loved it.

This was good but not as great as I was expecting based on the reviews. We found that there really wasn't much of a coffee or Kahlua taste. It was also a bit less firm than we generally like for cheesecakes but it was still tasty. The crust also didnt' really solidify into a real crust, but again, taste was good. The whipped cream was really nice too, we all liked that!

This was a wonderful cheesecake, the texture is so smooth and creamy. I'm not a coffee drinker but the the flavour is not to strong, nor is this cheesecake too rich that you can't go back for seconds. It was a hit at Christmas!

I doubled the crust recipe (as other reviewers suggeted) and had tremendous results! I was baking it for a cake auction at church so I didn't get to taste of it with the exception of the little bitty bit that stuck to the pan.  I believe it was delicious and it brought $40 at auction! I left off the whipped cream on top b/c it had to sit out about an hour on display.  I made a ganache and piped it on in a criss cross pattern then added a few fresh raspberries for garnish! It was the most beautiful thing I have ever made! (unfortunately my camera memory was full (vac) and I didn't get a picture to share! I will be making another one this week!

Really good cheesecake! I took others advice and doubled the crust. So glad I did! I also melted the chocolate in the microwave and didn't bother with mixing in the whipping cream, I'm pretty sure that leaving out only 2 T. of it didn't really make a difference. I used a water bath and didn't have any cracking on the top! This is a beautiful and delicious cheesecake. It's a very expensive one to make though so next time I might stick with my other chocolate cheesecake recipe.

This was my very first cheesecake (and I've been cooking and baking for over 50 years) and it came out absolutely perfect.  The directions were spot on.  The only way this could be improved is to lower the calories, and, better yet, the fat grams.  The easiest way to do that is take a smaller piece!  I won't change a thing.  Thank you for sharing

Spectacular!  I had this at a birthday celebration with eight different cakes; this one got raves and disappeared in no time.  So smooth, creamy and delicious.  I also used espresso for a stronger coffee flavor.  I can't wait to make this again!

This recipe was wonderful!  It is very rich so a little goes a long way.  I took it to a party and everyone thought it was store bought. The only problem I had was it cracked down the middle (I covered the crack with the flavored whipped cream).  I was given the advice that next time I make the recipe that I should loosen the cake from the edges of the pan before it cools which should help me avoid cracks in the top. I will try that next time.

Very good, but next time i will add more coffee. The liqueur in the whipped cream is a nice touch.

I personally do not care for cheesecake; however I decided to make this because it sounded sooo good. I have made this recipe a few times and everytime it is devoured by all. The only comment I get is that it was too sweet. Lots of diabetics in the family. To accomodate this, I used 1/2c Splenda instead of the 1c of sugar and also instead of the semisweet chocolate I opted for the unsweetened chocolate. No difference in the texture for anyone and everyone including our resident chef loved it! This is a great recipe!!!!!!!!!!

I've made alot of cheesecakes in my day, but this was definitely one of the creamiest.  The coffee and chocolate are a great balance...one doesn't overpower the other.  All of my guests and my family thoroughly enjoyed this one.  It's a keeper at my house!!!

A super rich cheesecake!  So rich, in fact, that I can't imagine making it except for company.  A little definitely goes a long way: I made this for a dinner party a week ago and am still trying to finish it!  I followed the instructions about leaving it in the oven after baking and I didn't get any cracks.  I'll definitley use this again for a special occasion.

Awesome! I substitued 1/2 c. super-strong coffee for the 1/4 c. of hot water and 1/4 c. coffee liqueur in the cheesecake portion. I simply added the 2 tsp. of instant coffee to the strong brewed coffee. I also covered the whipping cream topping with mini-chocolate chips. YUM!!!

It seemed I had ruined everything. Just as I was preparing the coffee and Kahlua I got a phone and made the mistake of dividing my attention. 

There is not that much attention to divide anyway. I put in six ounces of coffee instead of two creating a very liquid batter. My solution was to add another 8 ounce packet of cream cheese and a quarter cup of flour  I then baked it at 350 for one hour instead of 45 minutes. The cake was left in the turned off oven for fours hours without opening the door. I took it out placed it on a rack for two hours and the refrigerator for twelve hours.

I don't eat cheesecake, but my wife and friends do. Everyone of them raved that it was the most delightfully decadent cheesecake they had ever eaten!

Got rave reviews from the coworkers, but a bit heavy/rich for my taste. One slice will really do you. My chocoholic coworkers went nuts for it though.

Everyone but me loved it and raved over it, but I don't like coffee so it was no surprise I didn't care for it.  I made it for a coffee loving friend's birthday.

This was amazing. I followed a lot of the comments, in regards to the time (50-55 min) and used a water bath. I also upped the amount of expresso instead of instant. I didn't add the cinnamon to the oreo crust either. It was EXTREMELY rich and more chocolatey than cappucino, but delicious!

I thought this was very good. It turned out a little gooier than I expected. Not as firm as other cheesecakes I have made. However, the flavor was wonderful. I didn't have good luck with the crust. Next time I will add more cookie crumbs. I had butter leaking out the bottom of the pan all over the oven. Other than that complaint, I will probably make this again, just changing the crust.

Absolutely fantastic!  Very creamy with rich taste. Everyone raved about it last night!  It turned out perfectly the first time even though I used the low fat versions of sour cream and cream cheese.

This cheesecake was simply amazing! It took my three-person family an excruciating amount of willpower just to make it last three days. The leaves were a creative idea and give the cheesecake a professional touch. This is now my go-to dessert for parties and gatherings.

Amazing decadent cheesecake!  I slightly modified the recipe.  For the crust, I used two store bought Oreo pie shells and sprinkled cinnamon in the bottom of each.  For the chocolate, I used 60% dark by Ghirardelli.  In the filling, I used three teaspoons espresso in the hot water.  For the frosting, I used 1-1/2 cups heavy whipping cream (balance of the 16 oz minus 2 tbl earlier), 6 tsp confectioners’ sugar, 2 tbl Kahlua, and 2 tsp espresso in 1/4 c hot water.  On top, I put 4 ounces chocolate in a food processor to break into small pieces.  This recipe made enough to fill both store bought pie crusts.  Absolutely delicious!

Found I needed to bake it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe suggested which was just perfect.  No cracking!  Even without the water bath, this cake is so moist & delicious.  Is a real hit whenever I take it anywhere.

I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day and he LOVED it! He said they should sell it at The Cheesecake Factory. I don't even like cheesecake and thought it was absolutely delicious. I used crushed Oreos for the crust and Kahlua for the coffee liqueur and it turned out perfect.

I was slightly disappointed in this, although it was very tasty.  The filling was very good - smooth and delicious.  The whipped cream on top was wonderful.  But the crust?  It was just ok.  It was very hard and difficult to cut through once it was baked.  And almost everyone at the party I brought it to did not care for the cinnamon in the crust.  It just gave it a strange taste.  I think it might have been the combination of chocolate, coffee AND cinnamon.  Either way, I will probably make it again but I will try something different with the crust and will definitely eliminate the cinnamon.

Great recipe.. I've tried it two ways - one exactly per the recipe and the second I took out the cinnamon and sugar from the crust, used 2 cups oreo cookie crumbs and 1/2 cup butter.  Then for the cheesecake portion I used only 6 1 oz cubes of chocolate and no sour cream and it was TO DIE FOR!  Very rich, only small slices needed, but absolutely delicious!  Thanks for this recipe I will use often!

While it was two rich for my taste, the rest of my family loved it and requested it again! I had no trouble with the melting of the chocolate and such, but I had never done it before, so I tag teamed with my Mom. It worked well and we had no issues whatsoever!

This was a most excellent recipe. I followed it right to the detail, but I like my chocolate a little sweeter, I think next time I make this I will take the others advice and use more sugar. This recipe is most definitely a keeper. My family really loved it.

I made it with 2 shots of espresso (1 for the filling and 1 for the whipped cream), instead of the instant coffee and coffee liqueur. I also used 1.5 of the crust. Consistency and presentation were great. It tasted good. Given the reviews, I would have expected it to be 'the best thing I had ever eaten'. Well, that was not the case (it wasn't even in my top5 desserts) but still, it is interesting and I will definately make it again. Thanks for sharing!

I needed a dessert for our 2008 family reunion and after seeing all the five star ratings for this one, I couldn't go wrong.  I had to tweak it just a bit to make it "mine", so added 1 cup of pecans, (toasted and crushed in the blender) to the chocolate wafers to make a thicker crust as was mentioned by previous viewers.  I also used Kahlua mixed with the instant coffee and finally put the cheesecake in a water bath (putting aluminum foil around the bottom to prevent seepage into the crust).  The cake cracked along the edges but after keeping it in the oven (with heat turned off) for 45 minutes, the cake "rejoined" itself.  The comments were similar to those given the original recipe:  velvety, smooth, powerful flavor, restaurant quality, and "did you really make this?!) were typical.  Thanks for sharing this recipe - it is definitely a keeper.  By the way, it took 1st Place!

This is a top notch cheesecake, no doubt.  

I do have one suggestion on making the kahlua whipped cream.  Put the liquor and confectioners sugar in at the beginning (instead of upon peaking the whipping cream).  Doing so will prevent the whipped product from breaking down too much and being slightly mush (rather than a whipped texture).

Also will do 1.5 times the crust next time as others have mentioned.  I used a 9" springform and it was fine.  Can understand if using a 10" that it would be too thin.

This cake is fabulous. I've made it a few times and the only complaint I've heard is that it's "too rich." It is extremely rich, so serve thin slices. My mother requests this cake for every special occasion that comes around. So, here's what I do. I use Kahlua and I always run to Starbucks and pick up two shots of espresso. I melt the chocolate in a double boiler and have never had trouble with seizing. Cooling the cake slowly is extremely important to avoid cracking. You really need to leave it in the oven for much longer than 45 minutes before you transfer it to the refrigerator. The one thing I haven't figured out is how to make those beautiful chocolate leaves. I've tried before, and the chocolate melted immediately when I tried to peel the leaves off. Suggestions?

I am new at making cheesecakes.  Thought I would try my hand at the Chocolate Cappuccino cheesecake.  It tasted good but I noticed it was crumbly when cut.  Also the top had some crackes in it.  The receipe did not state the cheesecake should have been in a water bath.  Should I have placed the cake in a waterbath?

I made this cheesecake yesterday and decorated it this morning.  I then donated it to an auction for a local charity.  It was absolutely gorgeous!  I made the chocolate leaves and put them in a dollop of that yummy whipped cream mixed with Kahlua with more whipped cream around the edges.  Then I drizzled melted chocolate over the top and sprinkled it with more crushed Oreo crumbs.  DELICIOUS!  It sold for $375.

Terrific!  I followed this recipe to the letter, only adding a pinch of cinnamon to the whipped cream for the topping.  I used choclate graham crackers for the crust and I also decorated the cake with the whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and some chocolate covered espresso beans.  Everyone said it was divine!  Only need a small slice, as it is very rich.  Made as a 10 inch cake & if anyone bakes cheesecakes a lot, try the Kaiser pans, as they are the BEST for perfect cakes & pies!!  Dleicious recipe well worth the time for the all the Mmmmm's you get when serving it!

The cheesecake was really moist in the center after baking, but the consistency was great once it had chilled overnight.  It did have a large crack when done - I've made a lot of cheesecakes too adn this was the worst I've seen, but I spread the whipped topping over the whole thing and shaved chocolate onto it so it looked fine.  The taste was fabulous.  I heard over and over at hte dinner party I took it to how it was the best dessert anyone had ever had.  I highly recommend you share this with company (it's really rich as well).

I made this for a cheesecake competition that was held in our building for Easter - It won second place!  I used Belgian chocolate and substituted Starbuck's espresso for the liqueur.  I then used coffee flavoring for the whipped cream.  Was really delicious!

Very good cheesecake. I had to substitute very strong coffee for the coffee flavored liquor. It didn't have a strong flavor, but we still enjoyed this cheesecake. I'll make it again for sure.

Awesome cheesecake! I could not find coffee liq. so I used a TBSP of coffee extract and made it with no crust.  It came out perfect!!!! Just in case you want to eat it right away, after baking/ plus 45 min with the door open, I put the cheesecake in the freezer for about an hour and then in the refrig for about 1 hr. It set enough to enjoy it! Thanks for sharing!!  Jodie

I have been using this recipe for over four years and my family requests it all the time.  I use Neufchatel cheese and the last time I made it I even substituted in Stevia for the sugar.  I removed the cinnamon and sugar from the crust and just do a chocolate animal or graham cracker/butter crust.  Blending the cookies in a blender or food processor makes for a nice fine crumb!  Remember not to overbake this cheesecake; mine cracked every single time for years and the most recent time I made it I finally "under baked" it slightly - no cracks and my family LOVED the creamy texture.  I covered it with whipping cream (made with cocoa, instant coffee, and coffee liqueur) and a dusting of cocoa powder and it was the biggest hit yet.

Having made many many cheesecakes in the past, I have ALWAYS made mine in the food processor with the steel blade. This guarantees a perfectly smooth consistent texture. Always use expresso powder recipes call for 'strong coffee'- really intensifies the chocolate flavor. I've also used cappuccino liquor for an added flavor. I always wrap the bottom of the springform pan with 3 layers of heavy duty foil and bake in a water bath.
This is the method that Juniors'(Brooklyn) uses for its' famous cheesecakes to keep them extra creamy!

Just made this recipe to bring to a family Easter party.  Everyone loved it.  I made the crust with the proportions given (using Keebler Dark Chocolate Fudge Striped cookies).  I would recommend placing the cheesecake pan on a cookie sheet (with edges) while baking. I did not do this, and butter from the crust leaked out and started burning on the bottom of the oven (causing the smoke alarm to sound...and making a big mess).  I also made it 2 days before the event and it was delicious!

First time cheesecake maker and the recipe was easy to follow and the result delicious. I had read a number of other reviews that modified the original recipe. Doubling the cookie crumbs is an absolute must. I also used dark chocolate morsels. I microwaved the chocolate to melt it and it definitely broke. Not wanting to toss it and start again, I added the sour cream and used a hand mixer. It came back wonderfully. I will make this again.

Amazing - absolutely amazing!!  Based on other reviews, we doubled the ingredients for the crust and haven't made the chocolate leaves (yet).  Only make this if you have company, if you don't, you'll be eating all if it by yourself!

Awesome! Made this for Easter dinner and got rave reviews. Changed the crust to keebler fudge stripe cookies and butter, nothing else as cookies were sweet enough. Because some family members are non drinkers i added only a capful of amaretto to cheesecake just for a hint of flavor...it was so full of rich, dark chocolate flavor..I will make this again and again. Thanks!

Oh my was this rich! This was well loved by all that I served it too. Rating it 4 stars b/c I thought the coffee flavor was pretty much absent. Very good recipe, would add more coffee or use strong espresso as suggested by others next time. Thanks for the recipe:)

Delicious after chilling. I use a double boiler and have never had the chocolate seize. I have made this recipe as is and its great...that being said, to make it perfect (for my liking) I double the crust recipe and it needs to be baked in a water bath to minimize the cracks that appear after baking is complete and cool down process is happening. 

I have used instant coffee and tried expresso and both are good. 

I have used Baileys as my coffee liquor and have omitted it, either way is good

This was delicious. I didn't add the cream to the melted chocolate and it turned out fine. I used crushed oreos for the crust and added extra espresso like others suggested. Then I used a ganache for the top. I am going to make it again and add a little lemon juice.

This cheesecake was very good and fairly simple to make.  I ended up cutting the chocolate in half so that it would feature more of the coffee flavor.  My crust was pretty moist, but that could have been due to traveling, etc.

Very VERY delicious.  Everyone that tried it said it tasted better than many restaurants.  I served with fresh raspberries and it served way more than 12 because it was so rich that a half a slice was plenty.  I followed the directions exactly (but didn't make the leaves). Definitely going in my cheesecake rotation!

Great recipe, quite impressive!  I doubled the crust to make it come halfway up the edges of the pan

My fiance and I LOVED this version of the Chocolate Cappuccino cheesecake.  However the second time we made it, I created a bottom layer for a double layered cheesecake.  For the bottom cheesecake layer, I added melted chocolate to the whole filling which consisted of 1 TBS  heavy cream and 1.5 0z white chocolate and 1.5 oz toffee chocolate  added after the sour cream.  Together that will give you a mild carmel flavor. 

 I then went ahead with the recipe and added my amaretto liqueur, salt and vanilla.  I use about 1 cup and 1/3 for the bottom layer of the filling (no coffee flavors yet).

For the chocolate layer I then went ahead as the rest of the recipe calls for and added 1 cup semisweet (55-65%) melted chocolate with 2 TBS heavy cream.  I then also added 1 shot of expresso. 

 This is now more of a caramel macchiato cheesecake.  BOTH versions are very good.  Don't be afraid to vary the strongness of your chocolate preference or coffee strength.  The batter before you put it in the oven will taste similar to when you take it out.  I also let my cheesecake cook for an hour at 350, and then turned the oven off and slowly cracked the oven wider over the course of an hour as it cooled.
Thank you to the person who originally posted this wonderful recipe!

I made this for a small cheesecake competition at my school. It was my first time making a cheesecake, but I didn't find it that difficult. i followed Sally Bray's (a reviewer) changes and they worked wonderfully. It was so smooth and rich. Everyone loved it and it's still being talked about. I especially enjoyed making the chocolate leaves for the garnish; such a nice touch. One of the best cheesecakes I've ever tasted.

Sensational flavor and the family devoured the entire thing. The only problem I had, which might have been resolved to sticking it in the freezer for a few minutes before serving, was that it came apart and was very messy to serve. Mine had a more mousse like texture.

This is an absolutely AMAZING cheesecake! The texture is rich, creamy, and velvety smooth. The cappuccino flavor is definitely present, but not overwhelming. The only problem I found with this recipe was the crust...I made it as written, even though I was wondering at the directions. I used Oreo cookies, and ended up using about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of crushed cookies instead of just one, because the mixture was just too buttery. I also omitted the sugar, because the Oreos are SO sweet. In the finished cheesecake, the crust didn't stick at all to the filling...and tasted a bit soggy. I think that next time I make this, I will melt the butter instead of just softening it, and bake the crust a little before putting the filling in. I also baked my cheesecake in a water bath, which kept it from cracking. For the filling, because I never have liquor around the house, I just doubled the coffee/water mixture and used that instead. For the cream, I just used about 1/4 tsp. of crushed instant coffee granules instead of the liquor. It was the perfect compliment to the cheesecake! I had some problems with the chocolate leaves, so I used some chocolate ruffles that were left over from a different dessert instead. It was a hit at my sister's party...and I'll be making it again! Thanks for sharing!

Amazing, and surprisingly not too difficult to make! Everyone always raves over this cheesecake, and and my family gets so excited when they know I'm making it.   I read other reviews about the chocolate seizing and the crust being too thin. The first two times I made this, the chocolate seized on me too, but it still blended fine with the mixture (with an electric mixer). I just made one this morning, and this time I melted the chocolate in a bowl over boiling water, and didn't add the whipping cream until AFTER most of it had melted. Once you add the whipping cream, I realize now, it seizes. I also like to add more crust to make it thicker. I added a little more liqueur to the mix and may add more coffee the next time I make. Absolutely love this cheesecake!

Beautiful, delicious, and complex in flavor.  I did not use coffee liqueur because I didn't have any.  I just used instant espresso powder + hot water for 1/4 cup, and hot freshly-brewed coffee for the other 1/4 cup.  The only other changes I made were increasing the crust amount as suggested by other reviewers (I tripled the cookie crumbs and doubled the butter) and exchanging ONE block of cream cheese with neufchatel cheese.    My cheesecake cracked during the time it was in the fridge.  I recommend slipping a knife between the crust and the pan edges before putting it in the fridge to cool overnight.  I think this would have prevented the cracking.  Thank you for the fantastic recipe.  We enjoyed it for Valentine's Day and have several more slices in the freezer to enjoy over the next few weeks.

Fantastic recipe a 5 plus. Made this a couple of times, the flavor, texture etc was perfect except the top cracked on every occasion.  Not a fault with the recipe but something i I need to work on.
Update
Made it again, outstanding, no cracks. I topped it with choclate and toffee bits  and a Raspberry topping on the edge of the cake. See pix

I would recommend a cup and a half of crushed cookies. That way the crust comes out a little thicker and it is easier to spread. Otherwise wonderful recipe. So delicious!

This is one dandy of a cheesecake!! I made this for our family for Easter and had a request for the recipe. I thought that batter itself was delightful - and it's a good thing I did because it wasn't done. I baked it in a water bath for the recommended 45 minutes than left the oven door cracked open for another 45 minutes but it wasn't done enough and was all "soupy" in the middle. Since I don't have enough experience baking cheesecakes, I will read up on how to tell if it's done or not. I would highly recommend this recipe but to the novice, I encourage them to find out about how to tell when cheesecakes are done but you must make this recipe!! The flavor is scrumptious!!!

Rich, elegant and delicious. I gave it four stars instead of five since the texture was pretty grainy. I think it may have been the chocolate. Next time I'll melt it alone and add the whipping cream to cream cheese.

I have never made a cheesecake before in my life but this one turned out fabulously! I was really nervous and all I knew about cheesecakes was they will look mushy in the middle, but they'll be done. I had to bake this one about 50% longer as it was not just mushy, but was downright liquidy. But it turned out great and there were definitely no leftovers!

This was very good.  I do have to warn that it has a very strong coffee taste.  It is not for those wanting a slight coffee flavor.  Other than this it is terrific.

I made this for a Superbowl party and it was a hit!  I loved the creamy texture and richness of the cake.  I baked it over a pan of water and it turned out perfect.  The only changes I made were due to ingredients on hand.  I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and Hazelnut Kahlua instead of regular Kahlua.  Based on that I also replaced the espresso with 1/8 c of water and an 1/8 c of additional Hazelnut Kahlua.  I will definitely make this again, exactly as I did this time.  My husband was very happy!

This recipe was great and easy. Instead of making the crust myself i bought a pre made oreo cookie crust. Since the pie crust was small this recipe made two cheesecakes.  I added cappucino instead of coffee liquer since i couldn't find it. I also used the already "whipped" cream chesse which made the mixing so much easier and there were no clumps.

Turned out amazing. This recipe is a little tricky - so you will most likely need to have experience with   cheesecakes to have it turn out "prefect". But keep at it and it will be well worth it. This is one of the best I've made, according to others!

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake, and it couldn't have turned out better. As pretty much everyone else has said, this is a smooth, creamy, velvety cheesecake with a perfect balance between chocolate and coffee. I did substitute a quarter cup espresso for the quarter cup of alcohol, but then instead of two tablespoons coffee granules in water I added about two tablespoons of the liquer, for the sweetness and consistancy. The flavored whipped cream was mild enough to complement, not compete with the cheesecake, and the cinnamon in the crust was the perfect touch. I can't say enough - will MOST DEFINITELY make again. Thank you so much for sharing!

OMG!  This was the best cheese cake I've ever made.  I did substitute the instant coffee for some really strong brewed French Vanilla coffee.  Also, I didn't have Kaluah, so I used Cask & Cream Chocolate Temptation.  Also, I have Celiac (gluten allergy) so I used Newman's gluten free chocolate cookies chopped fine in the food processor.  I did use the water bath method and ended up cooking for a total of 1 hour to bring the temp up to 160.  Turned the oven off and left it closed for another couple of hours, then let it sit with the door open for an hour or so and then to the fridge.  No cracks what so ever!  The texture was delightfully creamy!  I didn't make the topping this time.  Maybe next time!  YUMMY!

We made this for a Christmas party, and got a little ways into the recipe before realizing the time committment we had made! It was fun to make though, and turned out well. The texture on the cheesecake was a 9 out of a 10 on a cheesecake expert's scale. The flavors went well together, SO rich. I think I'd make the chocolate layer thinner nexttime cause it was almost too much. Definitely worth the work if you love chocolate and coffee. One note: don't the mistake my fellow inexperienced chef almost made...if you use chocolate chips and not blocks of baking chocolate you don't have to chop them before melting =) ooh, and "chocolate cookie crumbs" was a little vague so I'm curious as to what everyone used! I ended up using vanilla wafers and teh texture was great and it was still chocolaty enough for this chocoholic.

I was really disappointed with this recipe because with all the positive feedback, I was expecting something truly out of this world. The consistancy was fine, but I didn't really like the taste. Usually I am a big chocolate fan, but somehow it tasted strange. I think I like the classic cheesecake recipes more. One thing, this cheesecake didn't crack at all, and looked really nice. I liked the cinnamon in the cookie crust and I will do this from now on for all cheesecakes!

This turned out great. The recipe as printed in only a 3 or 4 star but with some changes it becomes wonderful! I doubled the amount of sugar in the cheesecake part (I was making for a potluck that had some adults and some kids) I also doubled the crust recipe and left the cinnamon out of it. 45 min was NOT enough, the recipe said that it would be giggly but would firm up. It didn't. I recommend at least an hour or more depending on your oven. With these changes the texture and flavor were both delicious! I also liked it with a sour cream topping with a little Kahlua.

This is the best cheesecake I've ever tasted.  Though I am not a fan of cream cheese anyway.  I used chocolate  ghram crackers for the crust and substituted a rasberry sauce for the topping.  Both times I got rave reviews.  I had problems with melting the choclate but it mixed fine even though it was the consistency of very soft fudge.

This cheesecake is SOOOO delicious!  I made it for my mother for an early mother's day gathering.  She loves coffee and it was perfect for her.  I used strong coffee (as mentioned in previous reviews) instead of the coffee liqour.  The coffee flavor was just perfect, not too strong.  Wonderful!  I plan to make this one again and again!

Everyone who tasted this loved it. I have only made a couple cheesecakes before so I was a little nervous, but this turned out great!!  Texture was smooth and creamy.  Mine cracked across the top so I sprinkled mini choc chips around the edge and filled in the middle over the crack with the flavored whipped cream.  YUM!

This was an outstanding cheesecake and easy to prepare. The end result was rich and creamy.  I used chocolate graham crackers in the crust and added more coffee the second time around.  I took it to a dinner and I am still hearing raves about it weeks later.  I will definitely make this one again.  It is a very rich and elegant dessert.

This was a yummmy recipe, everyone loved it...I used a little less cream cheese than suggested. We tried it with Jamoca flavored ice cream
(Baskin Robbins) on the side, it was an excellent combination. THanks for the great recipe!!!

The cheesecake is so rich although it didn't come out as good as I expected.  Maybe because I omitted the coffee liquer, which wasn't available at the time I made it.

This recipe is outstanding!  A very hip version of a timeless type of dessert.  I served this along with 7 other cheesecakes for a bridal shower and this was by far the favorite!  It isn't as difficult as the directions look at first glance.  I garnished with mounds of the sweetened whipped cream prepared like the directions then I dusted with cocoa instead of the chocolate leaves.  Beautiful!

My wife and I absolutely loved the Chocolate Cappuccino Cheesecake.  They serve one like this at her favorite restaurant.  The other night we couldn't go out because the babysitter canceled--my wife was so disappointed, I looked for something to cheer her up and found this recipe, so I made it for her.  It was faaaaaantastic!  This was the first time I've ever made cheesecake, and it turned out perfectly.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I modified this recipe for one of my classes, and it turned out very good!  If you'd like to try a version that is lower in fat and calories (but still not VERY good for you) substitute the 3 packages of cream cheese for 1 1/2 nonfat cheese and 1 1/2 neufchatel cheese.  You can substitute low-fat sour cream as well, and only use 1/2 cup instead of 1.  Cool whip made a good substitute topping as well.  Enjoy!

If you like coffee and chocolate this is the cheesecake for you.  I've never received so many compliments on a cheesecake before.  The texture is smooth and creamy.
I substituted espresso for the instant coffee and coffee liquer and it turned out wonderfully.

Baked in a 9-inch pan to have a cheesecake with some height. Used espresso powder to give it a little extra punch. Turned out absolutely perfectly. Garnished with some chocolate covered espresso beans for a bit of crunch. Definitely a keeper!

Everyone really liked this cheesecake.  I made a couple small changes, I used chocolate chips (probably 10 oz) instead of the squares and I didn't use any whipping cream.  I also used 4 tsp of instant coffee in 1/2 cup water, it didn't have a strong coffee taste but a nice hint.  I used oreo cookies for the crust, I always do, they stick so much easier.  I also added 2TBSP of flour because a few reviews said it was creamier than classic cheesecake.  Mine came out with a great cheesecake texture and flavor, I dropped a few chocolate chips on the top before baking and then after it was done I put a circle of fresh raspberries around the top and drizzled melted chocolate chips back and forth, very pretty.

Excellent cheesecake. My niece wanted something for her 19th birthday with chocolate, and this worked great. I replaced the topping with a ganache recipe found on the site. Only 2 changes I would make in the future are both with the crust. I love cinnamon, but didn't think it worked well with the crust. Also, crust had a bit too much butter in it and barely enough for a 9" pan, I'd keep the amount of butter the same but would add another 1/2 to 3/4 cup of crumbs.

This took a long time to prepare and to cook. Then again, all cheesecakes take a long time to prepare and cook. This one is definitely worth it. My second cheesecake ever and this was incredible. The resulting cheesecake is restaurant quality, fine restaurant quality. I could easily see this being served at $8 a slice and the customers thinking it was a great value. I love it when a great recipe makes an average cook look great.

This recipe is amazing. All my family loved it. It takes some time but for my first Cheesecake ever I think it was well worth it. If you are less of a coffee person and more of a chocolate person I added cocoa, sugar, and vanilla to the whip cream instead of the coffee liqueur and everyone loved it. It adds some sweet to recipe.

I thought this recipe was very good and quite easy to make.  I didn't do much modification other than making the whipped topping as I always do with granuated sugar instead of confectioners.  Everyone loved the cheesecake.  I would recommend putting parchment paper in the bottom of the pan as I had a hard time getting it off of my springform bottom.  I am making this again next week.  Loved it!

I made this recipe for my son, birthday and Easter I mess up twice. First I did not measure the instant coffee which made it to strong and then I forgot to add a 1/4 cup of something to make up for the liqueur. I would not serve it the first day after I had a slice. It was strong coffee taste. Next day it was so good. I will make it again. Will not eat it the same day.

I hate to downgrade a recipe that most respondents have loved.  Have not the foggiest idea what went awry but it was not smooth and, in fact, was somewhat granular.  I've made plenty of cheesecakes in my life but this one was poor.

So good. Delicious and rich. Also very easy. I followed people's tips about mixing whipping cream with sour cream. Tried to keep in oven for 45min after cooking to avoid cracking, but it still cracked. But was ok - just filled with whipped topping

Made this for my cousin's hubby's birthday and it was better than I expected.  Almost followed the recipe as is...but had to make slight revisions.  Considering the amount of cheesecake being used, i actually doubled the crust (used chocolate graham crackers instead).   Also, I don't know why other reviewers had a problem with the chocolate seizing with the whipping cream as I did not have a problem at all.  I used eight-1oz baker's semi-sweet chocolate (the ones that are in individual 1oz packages.  i added the whipping cream (double the amount that's in the recipe) before melting it in the double broiler.  I continuously stirred fairly fast and it just smooths out.  As for the whipping cream for decorating the cake, i added the powdered sugar as directed, but also added coffee liqueur (1:1 ratio with the sugar) and food coloring.  Everyone loved it.  Decadent and smooth!

An absolutely divine recipe! I'd advise making it at least a few days in advance before serving, especially if you are presenting to a fastidious crowd; it gets much better with every day chilled. I used 4 4.5X1.5 in cheesecake pans and baked for 30 minutes at 325* and then turned off oven and left it a jar for about 20-30 mins. The center will be a little jiggly. Perfect, then of course chill for at least a couple days. Before serving, I placed a cocoa almond on each center rim, which adds great visual. Every elegant and silky smooth were the results.

I had to make a number of changes, but it still turned out quite well. I used ricotta cheese mixed with sour cream as I live in France and cream cheese is not available. I also didn't have any coffee liquor so I used Caramel Bailey's instead (which was a little strong). They don't sell chocolate cookie crumbs here either, so I used chocolate galette cookies instead. My father in law loved it, but I've had/made better cheesecake in the past. Very rich.

this has become a great favourite: I even twist the recipe to accomodate other ingredients instead of using other recipes. The only change I made is that I use cocoa powder instead of melted chocolate to have the chocolate filling: this way I'm also able to avoid the cream and I can assure you that nobody could ever doubt it, it's sinful and smooth enough.

Really great recipe! I made this for my Mum on Mother's Day. I found it a bit too cheesey but everyone else loved it.
I added more crust and dusted the top with cacao and swirled cream/ dark chocolate on the plates before serving it. I added thin twists of coffee-flavoured chocolate on top instead of the leaves.

I followed the recipe exactly, but was very disappointed with the result. The inside of the cheesecake was very soft, impossible to cut, while the outside was hard and dry. The crust was rock hard and would not come our of the pan. The flavor was just okay... way too rich for me, and too sour tasting from the alcohol. This recipe is going in the garbage and I'm off to find something different.

Awesome!!  I followed the directions exactly and ended up with the best cheesecake that I've ever had! I had the misses', my daughter and friends try it.  They all loved it and want me to make it again, which I definitely will!  Tastes better than the restaurant cheesecakes, honestly!!

This turned out to be very good and beautiful to look at, however, I had an issue with the chocolate thickening too much after adding the cream. It was fine before I added it. If I make this again, I might just omit that part because I think it prevented the cake from having the most chocolate flavor it could have. Also, 24 hrs chill time is ideal.

Turned out great bother times I made it. First time was with low fat everything and the second time was all fat. 

I like to add coco and espresso powerder to the crust and 5+ teaspoons of espresso to the filling instead of 2.

Excellent!   I know not to over bake a cheesecake, but I found that 45 minutes was a bit short - needed 55 min.  Perhaps it was the water bath that I always use to bake a cheesecake.

Made this for my son's birthday party and it was a huge hit. 

I made a graham cracker crust because that's what I had and used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of whipping cream. I used cold press coffee, slightly diluted instead of the coffee granules and water. I also used unsweetened chocolate and added some sugar myself. It was nice because I was able to control the darkness of the chocolate. 

Instead of the whipping cream and chocolate on top, we cut strawberries in half and drizzled ganache flavored with coffee flavored liqueur. 

It was a huge hit. I got rave reviews and many requests to make it again.

This had a great flavor and texture however it was a little too sweet for everyone.  I especially loved the cinnamon in the crust.  No one else seemed to notice but I did and I LOVED it!  One downfall was that I couldn't find chocolate cookie crumbs ANYWHERE!  So I had sit and scrape a bunch of oreos and put them in the food processor.  Not the recipe's fault though - awesome cheesecake, even if a bit on the sweet side.

I loved this recipe it was rich, chocolatey and delicious. I did have trouble with the crust and I think it would be easier to spread with melted butter instead of softened. I used amaretto instead of coffee liquor and I topped mine with ganache instead of the topping used here. It tastes very similar to a cheesecake from a local restaurant that we pay $6 a slice for!

YUM!!!! I added a little more sugar, and I think it could have used more of a chocolate-taste. The coffee taste was just the right amount though. Also, I used the 100 Calorie packs of chocolate cookies for the crust, but I wouldn't do that next time! It didn't taste like a chocolate crust should.  Ill try teddy grams next time, or stick to oreos.  All in all-I did LOVE this cheesecake! If only I knew how to prevent cracking on the top :( Does anyone have any tips???  Oh ya-I made the whipped topping, but mine came out very thin so I beat in some whip cream too...very good!!!!! I noticed it thickens when you refrigerate it. Will make the entire thing again! I have a whole bottle of coffee liquor now that I have to use!

YUM, YUM, YUM!!!  I made this for Thanksgiving and am still enjoying it a great deal!  It's SO creamy!  I used crushed oreo cookies for the bottom and the only thing I might change next time is I might bake the crust for 10 or so minutes before filling it.

I made this cheesecake in mini form using one chocolate wafer from an Oreo cookie as the bottom crust.  There was a strong tang from the sour cream that I didn't care for.  The chocolate wasn't as pronounced as I had hoped it would be.  I skipped the whipped cream & chocolate leaves as garnish.  A few members of my family really enjoyed the cheesecake though.  I'll attempt the recipe again using a darker chocolate option & a different cheesecake base without sour cream.

Ok, I have made this recipe many times and it always comes out delicious.  I do have a few tips that might help some people.  

Chocolate tip:  I use baking squares and I put the squares in a ceramic bowl and set it near the back of the stovetop, where it gets warm while the oven is heating for the crust.  This starts melting the chocolate. When time to add chocolate I pour the whipped cream over the chocolate, microwave for 30-40 seconds, remove, whisk until smooth and add to batter.  If the chocolate still appears lumpy or grainy after whisking, I will microwave it for a few more seconds (20-30).  I don't own a double boiler and always use this method for melting chocolate.  If you don't pre-melt it, or forget, microwaving for a little longer works too, 60-90 seconds.  Just be sure to add the whipping cream before putting in microwave.

Basic tip:  I always set out the eggs and cream cheese for a while or nuke the cream cheese before mixing so it is room temp.  This will prevent the chocolate from hardening in the batter.

Fluffy version:  If you like a fluffier cheesecake, put egg whites into a separate bowl and add yolks when indicated in the recipe, then after everything else is added, whip the egg whites until they start to form peaks and gently fold them into the batter, pour into pan and bake as normal.  I sometimes even add an extra egg white when making this version.

I hope this helps people.

I thought the coffee taste was a bit strong at first, but I'm sure for those that love coffee, this would be amazing.  Everyone who tried it loved it! I personally didn't like it the day after I baked it, but it grew on me after a few days.  It has a smooth texture, and a very rich, grown up taste!    I used crushed chocolate graham crackers and doubled the crust in a 10 inch springfrom pan, and it was perfect.  After you spread the crust mixture at the bottom of the pan, it will be a lot easier to flatten and even out the crust by placing a piece of plastic wrap over the mixture, and pressing firmly using the palm of your hand to shape it.  I didn't make the whipped cream, as I think the cheesecake by itself was rich enough.  Also, I made my own coffee liqueur using instant Arabica bean coffee, sugar, water, vodka and vanilla.  If you type "homemade Kahlua" in a search engine, you will be able to find it easily.  It tastes great, and I will probably be using it again soon to make Tiramisu.

My favorite cheesecake.  I use strong instant coffee in place of liqueur, and oreo cookies in the base. I add the coffee in step 4 instead of step 5, as otherwise I have had the chocolate mixture seize up.  Great topped with either whipped cream or ganache.

OMG!!!  I took this one step further and added about 4 chopped heath bars into the batter, and sprinkled 1 more on the top before baking.  Once cooled, drizzle with a melted Hershey's Espresso candy bar, and serve with whipped cream!  TO DIE FOR!!!  Tastes JUST like the one at Cheesecake Factory!

This is heavenly!  The flavor of coffee and chocolate, what could be better?!  I made a change in the recipe and as a result caused me a little bit of problems, however, after talking to some people, I think I can fix it.  After thinking about it, I did not want to buy coffee flavored liqueur as I would not use it alot.  Someone on the RE, suggested using strong brewed coffe where the recipe calls for the coffee flavored liqueur, if you did not want the alcohol flavor.  This still gave the cheesecake great coffee flavor but made it a little too watery.  So I am going to make this again and try dissolving my instant coffee in hot cream, hopefully  giving the same consistency of coffee flavored liqueur.  The center of the cheesecake was watery.  I could not get it done.  It did not firm up much after cooling.  So, I will try this again.  However, it got rave reviews at my mom's house tonight.

I followed the directions to a T, but my cheesecake cracked and just fell apart when trying to slice. Probably not the recipe's fault, I've just never made cheesecake before.

I made adjustments because I don' like coffee.  Instead of the instant coffee I used raspberry flavord instant hot cocoa mix.  Instead of the coffee liquour I used Chambord. I didn't double the crust.  I think that a cheesecake is about the cheesecake.  The crust is merely the vehicle that keeps it from sticking to the pan. I didn't think that the cheesecake was too rich, but it is one of those recipes that you have to actually suck off of fork.  My husband likes a much drier, cakey texture.  No biggy....more for me.

Awesome dessert! I used chocolate filled oreos for the crust (no sugar necessary) and sprinkled a few more crumbs on top after it chilled - looked great and tasted great!  I also used half sugar and half Splenda - nobody knew the difference! Very rich and decadent. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I like to make several desserts for Christmas dinner and one is always a cheesecake. This is a nice recipe that presents well and isn't too heavy. I liked the cinnamon in the crust and the flavoured whipped cream. It set up really well and didn't crack. I would have liked to have used a cake decorating bag to pipe the whipped cream onto the cake top. All in all a good cheesecake recipe.

Okay, so I completely forgot to add the coffee/liquor (left it sitting on the other counter...then wondered why the batter was so thick) but nonetheless, this recipe is to die for! A scrumptious chocolate cheesecake without the coffee ingredients, but next time I plan to try it the way it's written!

Absolutely delish! I did also add two shots of espresso instead of the coffee and the kalahua is a must! It adds great flavor. I also did 1 1/2 the crust... 2x the crust would have been too much. Instead of the whip cream, I dusted the top of the cheesecake with powdered sugar, dark chocolate shavings and fresh raspberries. If you choose to do this, jut make sure you do it right before you set out or serve as the powdered sugar will quickly absorb the moisture of the cheesecake and disappear. When I make this again I will cook the cheesecake about 5-10 minutes more as my center was a little too moist. It still tasted great, but was a little too soft.

SUPERB!!! I made 3 of these for Thanksgiving for each family's house and all loved it!! The first one was GONE almost instantly plus many people taking slices home for leftovers :) I didnt have any coffee liquer and used 2 shots of espresso instead of reg. coffee. I did not make the whipped topping but instead topped it with caramel sauce. Perfectly smooth consistency, very rich but not too much so. Didnt get a crack or anything! Will DEFINITELY be making this again!! YUM!!!!

This recipe is amazing.  It made my boyfriend fall to pieces.  I am making it again to take to Thanksgiving dinner at my bosses house and chose to bring this because her husband is a perfectionist, and I aim to impress.  This one will knock the socks off of anyone, even if they don't like cheesecake.  I also add a dash of cinnamon to the cheesecake mixture with hazelnuts lining the crust.

What a delicious cake! Made this for a birthday party and everyone had a tiny piece (half a small slice each) and called it fantastic and rich. I subbed 2 8oz containers of fat free and 1 of low fat cream cheese for the regular cream cheese. I used low-fat margerine and low fat sour cream as well. The coffee and chocolate flavors hid any taste difference superbly. When I told people it was low-fat, they didn't believe me because each little bite was so rich and filling. However, the taste was fantastic and I received compliments all night!

This is by far the best cheesecake I've ever made, and I've made quite a few! I  feel that you have to follow a recipe to a "T" the first time you try it , and  the next time you make it you can make any adjustments you feel it needs. That being said, I did follow the recipe, and I wouldn't change a thing! I must admit, the crust was pretty soft, but it did not effect the flavor or presentation. The texture was so smooth it was more like French Silk Pie than cheesecake.I will be making this often, I think it may become our new "birthday cake".

I made this recipe for a dinner party and it was a huge hit!  The only change I made was using bittersweet chocolate in place of the semisweet and chocolate grahams for the crust as suggested by others.  Dusted the whipped cream with chocolate curls, cocoa powder and cinnamon.  It was even better several days after I made it.  Very impressive dessert!

The taste of this cheesecake turned out amazing! However, I had to bake it a lot longer than the recipe said and it was still soft in the middle when we ate it. Also, all the cookie crumb crust stuck to the bottom of the springform pan. Even though the cheesecake was delicious I do not think I will go through all the trouble to make it again.

Great cheesecake! I haven´t baked a cheesecake in years due to depressing results (cracked, sunken middle, heavy, grainy etc). Decided to give this a try due to all good rewievs. I wanted to use my 8" non-stick springform pan so I converted the recipe to 8 servings and made a few modifications based on previous rewievs. I doubled the crust recipe (since I couldn´t find chocolate cookie crumbs I used graham cookie crumbs) and slightly increased some of the ingredients (150g sugar, 60 ml espresso, 50 ml kahlua, 2 tsp vanilla extract + 1 tsp brandy). I melted the (38%) chocolate in the microwave on medium for 1-2 min. When I added 20 ml whipping cream it started to sieze. It didn´t help to reheat but when I added the hot espresso the mixture became smooth again. All ingredients were room temperatured and I used my KA with the paddle attachment at low speed. I baked at 175C in a waterbath (wrapped the pan in heavy-duty foil and placed it in baking tray) for 1hr 15 min (the cake was still very lose after 45 min). I turned off the oven and left the door slightly ajar for additional 45 min. I took out the cheesecake, removed the foil and let it sit in room temperature for another 30 min before I transfered it to the freezer. It turned out perfect, (except for the crack I accidentaly made when I dropped my spoon on to of it...), 2" thick nice and it had a nice chocolate colour. I served it at work the following day (thin slices with Kahlua flavored whipped cream) and it was a hit! Ri

I've to tell you, this is the best tasting cheesecake i ever made.
I love the smell of coffee and chocolate when i'm making this cheesecake.
My bottom was a bit soggy, but it turn out fine after i leave it for a day in the fridge. I suggest you use 1 and 1/2 recipe for the bottom part as it just enough to cover my 10" springform pan. 
I was worried coz the batter was runny (i use food processor for a silky smooth result) - but i guess it was to be expected with so much liquid added (i use  120ml espresso and skip the coffee liquor like the other reviewer suggested).

The alcohol cooking off gave it a strange after taste.  Still edible and good, but no where near great in the world of cheesecakes.

i struggled with this recipe. mainly because i could not find coffee liquer, only extract. my chocolate also kept seizing which was a problem and in the end i didn't have quite enough chocolate. it really ended up as a coffee flavored cheesecake, but good nonetheless. i was out on chocolate cookies, and they seem to be a bit hard to find these days, so i used chocolate disgestives and that turned out heavenly. i will definetely look for the liqueor and maybe use bittersweet chocolate.

I made this for husband for Valentine's Day and I would prefer a different type of cheesecake but this was really good.  The only thing I changed was that I added 4 teaspoons of coffee and 1/2 cup of cream since I didn't have any of the liquor.  After baking and cooling off in the oven, the cake came out looking perfect with no cracks in it all.  If you like chocolate cheesecake, this is the perfect recipe for you.

I've made chocolate cheesecakes before and always been disappointed at the mild impact of the chocolate.  This one  blew my tastebuds with its serious chocolate flavor!  I made it with 60% cocoa bittersweet chocolate chips instead of the semisweet chocolate.  Instead of the flavored whipped cream, I made a topping by heating 1/2 cup whipping cream and stirring in 4 oz. of the bittersweet chips until melted.  Spread this on the cheesecake while still in the pan, before chilling.  I took this to work and overheard one of the women saying it was "absolutely the best thing she had ever put in her mouth"! For anyone wanting a deep, strong chocolate cheesecake, this is the one.

I hate to leave mediocre feedback when so many people have left five stars, but I must be honest.  I didn't care for this dessert.  I didn't think there was a strong enough chocolate flavor and my cake was overdone and grainy (I even used an oven thermometer). I just wasn't a big fan. Sort of disappointed after all the great reviews and expensive ingredients.

A bit strong in coffee flavor for  me..next time I may try decreasing the instant coffee a bit...or adding some cocoa powder in to offset it..over all pretty good though.

This was very creamy and yummy.  I left the oven door closed during the time the oven was off.  I was afraid of the undercooking that was posted.  I also used a water bath to prevent cracking.

This was quite creamy and delicious.  Like other reviewers, I didn't have any coffee liqueur, so I substituted an equal amount of strong coffee.  I also had to adjust baking time to accommodate an 8" sprinform pan--350F for 40 minutes and 250F for 20 minutes.  Next time I may reduce the coffee because it was overpowering.  I also added 1/4 cup more sugar.  For the crust, I used chocolate graham crackers, and I must say that the addition of cinnamon was genius!  It really complements the overall taste.  This is definitely something you'd expect to find at a coffeeshop bakery.

Absolutely delicious!  I've tried to make mocha flavored desserts before, but the coffee flavor has always been overpowering.  This is a GREAT recipe!  The cheesecake is almost a mousse consistency.  I used Kalua, which was fabulous.

A fantastic cheesecake.  I used 1/4 brewed espresso in place of the instant coffee, and I didn't use a water bath, just the directions in the recipe.  It's quite dense, and the chocolate crust is a nice touch.

Yum Yum Yummie Yum!  This was just about the best cheesecake I've had anywhere.  It was rich and smooth, with a subtle taste of coffee.  I made it for Sunday dinner at my parent's house and it got rave reviews!  Thanks for a great recipe.

The cake tasted wonderful, but completely fell apart when I tried to get it off the springform bottom.  I had followed the directions exactly, so I guess it needed to bake longer.  What a disappointment after all that work!

Outstanding!  I made this for my boss' birthday today and it is absolutely scrumptious.  I love making cheesecakes, but this is my favorite recipe by far.  It is rich, velvety, and has just the right amount of sweetness.  I used Scharffen Berger bittersweet 70% chocolate because that is what I had on hand, but next time I will try it with a less expensive, semi-sweet chocolate that you can get in the grocery store, just to see if it comes out as luscious.  I'm sure it will.

UMMM! UMMM! GOOOOOOD!!!!!  I made this recipe  twice in one week, for two different occasions, and it was a hit both times.  The cappuccino flavor is so subtle that even the littlest kids love this cake, too. The cake comes out so creamy, that it simply melts in your mouth.  I will definitely make this recipe for years to come!!!

The flavor of this cheesecake was delicious, however, I don't know what I did wrong but it was a little too soft and didn't slice easily.  I baked it a litle longer because it just didn't seem to want to set up right. Then I thought chilling it might firm it up, but it never did get quite firm enough. I will try it again because the flavor is so good.

This cheesecake was wonderful!  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I was told that it should be illegal!  I did make a couple of adjustments though.  I made fresh espresso and used it in place of the instant coffee and the coffee liquer and I didn't flavor the whipped cream.  I plan on making this again on Christmas Eve!

Follow everything in the recipe except for the crust. I didn't have chocolate cookie, so I used Graham crackers with cocoa powder. It was delicious, I made it for my husband birthday. Everyone enjoyed it.

This is soooo good. I followed the recipe exactly for the cake, but I did alter the crust. I used dark chocolate Oreos and butter to make the crust omitting the sugar and cinnamon. I will definitely make this again!

The flavors of this cheesecake were spot on. So rich and velvety smooth. Cheesecakes are stressful, so I did my research before making this one, and ended up with no cracks. It’s important to have all your ingredients at room temperature, so I left them all out of the fridge for an hour before baking. I used Oreos for the crust and omitted the sugar. I also doubled the amount of cookie crumbs and I still would have preferred more crust. I made sure to beat the cream cheese very well so that it was soft and smooth, and then mixed in the sugar about 2 tbsp at a time. I added the chocolate mixture (which I microwaved to avoid seizing) before adding the eggs, because the eggs should not be overmixed. I left the instant coffee and liqueur as written, but if you really like coffee flavor, I would recommend either using stronger coffee (such as espresso) or increasing the amount used. I triple wrapped my springform pan in aluminum foil and placed it directly in a waterbath (jelly roll pan with 1/2 inch of hot water). 45 minutes was not enough time to get that perfect jiggly center and set sides that you look for in a cheesecake. Mine needed 50-55 mins. After baking, I turned off the oven and let it sit with the oven cracked for another hour before chilling overnight. Overall it was a success. I made it for my mom’s birthday and she loved it. I would make it again with some minor adjustments.

Absolutely delicious! Next time, I need to remember to line the bottom of the springform pan with parchment paper though & wrap the bottom of the pan in foil before baking to prevent butter leakage. Otherwise it was incredible! Devoured by all at our Christmas dinner.

I made this as a gift for my hairdresser and at multiple points along the way I debated keeping it for myself because it smelled so good! It did bake up with a crack (I think the magazine recipe calls for slightly different cooking time, or I need to get an oven thermometer!). At any rate, I realized keeping an entire cheesecake for myself was not a great idea so I hid the crack with some chocolate shavings. After I gave it to her she told me it was so good, her and her sisters were debating whether or not I bought it or made it! The ultimate compliment. So now I’ll be making it for my New Years Eve party to share with my girlfriends so I can finally taste it for myself!

The best dessert recipe that I have made from All Recipes. Made mini cheesecakes with foil liners. Baked with water bath pan on lower shelf at 325 for 20 minutes. I topped with a small melted sweet chocolate drop thinned with a small amount of corn syrup.

I made this using gluten-free cookies for the crumb crust and prebaked the crust for 10 mins but otherwise followed the instructions exactly and it was amazing! Co-workers asked for the recipe and were super impressed.

Absolutely wonderful, rave reviews from friends and picky husband. I used 2/3 cup of a double shot of fresh espresso made from Lavazza espresso beans, and 1/3 cup of disaronno liquer instead of the coffee/coffee liquer. I ran out of chocolate crumbs so I topped up what I had with 1/4 cup honey graham crumbs. I omitted the sugar from the crust, omitted the salt. For the topping I used whipped cream, sugar, but whipped in the leftover melted chocolate from making my decorative leaves. It got cut up and eaten before I could take a picture :p.

Made this as JUST a chocolate cheesecake (for the toddlers sake...and ultimately mine ??) and it was perfect!!
Just left out all of the coffee ingredients, and added an additional 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate.

The KEY to the chocolate is to melt it FIRST on the double boiler (one pot over a second filled with boiling water) and THEN add the cream.
I added semi-sweet chocolate chips to the top at the very end of the cooling to allow them to to slightly melt but retain their shape. Turned out perfectly.

I made this recipe as written except I increased (1.5x) the crust.  In the future I will double the crust ingredients as it wasn't as prominent as I would have liked.  I had the same issue with curdling of the chocolate when I added warmed cream.  As someone suggested, I added some butter and whipped until it was smooth again.  Great Suggestion!   I did cover the bottom of the pan and made a bain-marie.  I baked the cake for 60 minutes and it was quite wobbly when I turned off the oven, and was concerned that I should have baked longer.  However, after cooling and chilling, it was perfect!  I made whipped cream with Kahula that was stabilized with gelatin--really made it easier to make ahead of time and put it in the piping bag ready to go just before serving.   It was a hit!

Great recipe. I only made a few changes for personal preference, not as a correction. I did double the crust, and I added 2 tbs of cocoa powder to deepen the chocolate. I also didn't add any powdered  sugar to the whipped cream topping as I like it less sweet. Instead I added 3 tsp of espresso powder and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I used a whipping stabilizer since I left out the sugar. It turned out wonderfully!

Good thing it is low calorie............ not!  Disgustingly devilishly rich and tasty.  Wow.
Pretty much went with the way it was written.  I did 1 1/2 portions of the crust and added cinnamon and cocoa powder to Graham Wafers. 
For the chocolate I used a mixture of dark chocolate chunks and Ghiradelli Dark Chocolate baking chips with a about a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.
Made it the day before and the flavours really blended together nicely.  Great recipe.   Thank you

Yumm I doubled the crust amount for a thicker base, added 375 grams jar of Nutella, took out all the sugar and semi sweet chocolate, and added esspresso instead of the instant coffee stuff.  It is soo good one of our favs.

I had no issues with this recipe... followed instructions exactly.  Folks in the office inhaled it and I actually forgot to try a piece, so I'm rating based on everyone else's raves.  This uses about half a package of chocolate wafers (not Oreo cookies).

Amazing cheesecake! Most silky smooth I've ever made. 
I did double the crust recipe and added a bit of instant coffee granules to the crumbs.
Used espresso as suggested instead of instant coffee and water in the cheesecake and doubled the whipped cream to top it off as suggested by many.
I had read by one person to add a little butter to chocolate so added almost a teaspoon while chocolate and whipping cream were melting and had no seizing at all, only super smooth melted chocolate over low stove flame .
Amazing amazing cake!

Sept 23/16 
This is the second one I have made, the first one had cracked
so I am trying this one at a lower oven temperature then 350
so hopefully it will be fine.  I set the time for 45 min and oven temp 320.  But all in all it tastes great

Probably the best cheesecake I have made. I am not fond of making chocolate cheesecakes as it is a tad bit more work than the others. But it is worth all of the work by far. It looks incredible, it tastes even better. Can't say much more about it. It's a must make if you're cheesecake maker.

The changes I made to the recipe were...I made the coffee mixture a little stronger and added slightly over a 1/4 c of the coffee liqueur. Also I used chocolate graham crackers instead of wafers(my store was out of the wafers) and last but absolutely not least...I 86'd the flavored whipped cream and topped it with a homemade caramel sauce finished with a light sprinkle of coarse sea salt...and wah la you have a "Salted Caramel Mocha Cheescake." LOOK OUT STARBUCKS!!! LOL

I mad this to take to a dinner on New Years eve.  Everyone raved about it.  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfect.  I did melt the chocolate in the microwave.  No cracking in the cake.  But I did the whipping cream differently as I did not want to whip it at the last minute.  I used Cool Whip, added powdered sugar and the Kahlua to it,  I neglected to tell people that it was Cool Whip and no one knew.

I made this cheesecake for the first time and it turned out amazing! I made an Oreo crust using two rows of crushed Oreo cookies and 1/4 butter.  I left over some batter that I blended with extra melted chocolate, and created a marbled effect on top of the cheesecake. Looked beautiful and tasted delicious!

Oh my gosh, the batter tasted delicious, I couldn't help but have some. And it came out perfect! It looked like one you would buy from the store except it tasted better. I would highly recommend making this cheesecake. I was going to make this and give it away, but ended up eating most of it, my bad! So, so good! I will certainly be making this again.

This cheesecake was fantastic, but I need a high altitude adjustment for it.

I didn't have coffee liqueur.  Instead, I used strong coffee.  I should have added something to increase the sweetness.  It was still a creamy and tasty cheesecake, which the coffee and dark chocolate lovers in the group enjoyed.  However, those who have a sweet tooth will need something sweeter.

I had big hopes for this recipe as it was highly-rated. I made my own version of the crust.

The cheesecake turned out to be much creamier and liquid-ish than expected, which is not what I really look for in a good cheesecake. Also the taste of Kahlua was quite overpowering. Next time I would try to reduce the amount of Kahlua to 3 tbsp, and use 200 g of sour cream. I would also consider reducing the amount of chocolate slightly to 200 g.

Great recipe but I think next time I would cut the chocolate and sour cream down a bit and put a little more coffee. At least for my taste its too much chocolate.

This recipe was amazing.  I prepared it just as it is written except I also put a pan of water under the cheesecake to help reduce cracking.  This was the first cheesecake I ever made and I loved it!  It could have had more coffee flavor, perhaps I'll try a stronger expresso next time.  I will make this again and again.

I give this recipe 5 stars!  Very easy directions,  just follow it and your cheesecake will come out wonderful.  My husband, daughter and son loved it.  You can taste the Kahlua, but not so much where it over powers the rest of the flavors.  Cut out parchment paper to put in the bottom of the pan, it makes it easier for it  you to put it on a fancy cake dish later on.   Also, do add the Kahlua in the whipping cream, it adds an extra touch to it.  Only one thing, you have to double the crust for a 9 inch  cheesecake.  Will make it again.

This cheesecake is fantastic.  I served it for Thanksgiving along with 3 other desserts.  Everyone raved about it, and I have had requests for the recipe.  I made it just as written.  The only thing I would change is the crust.  I would double the crust as another reviewer recommended because it was too thin and difficult to remove from the pan.  It tasted amazing so I think doubling it would take care of the problem.

I made a "tester" cheesecake before I make one for an event. Altered the recipe a bit by using coffee flavoring instead of vanilla extract, doubled the instant coffee mixture instead of using liqueur, used vanilla cookie wafers and some instant coffee granules (no cinnamon) for crust (doubled the crust after reading another review)topped with a poured dark chocolate ganache and melted white chocolate design for fun; this was gone in a hurry, devoured by men who aren't necessarily black coffee drinkers!

Unfortunately, I am one of the few in the minority with this recipe.  Although the cheesecake tasted good, after 45 minutes in the oven, it still jiggled - a lot - but I followed the directions, turned off the heat, and left the oven door open. It did firm up somewhat in the fridge but was very mushy.  I was never able to get it off the bottom of the springform pan and thus just served it on the pan.  Could not get a good "slice," of course.  Oh, and during baking, oil from the butter and cream cheese oozed all over the bottom of my oven and smoked up the entire house.

This was amazing! I made it for a friend's birthday and there weren't even crumbs left. 

For those having issue with the chocolate seizing, don't use anything but Baking chocolate. I never have any trouble with Baker's chocolate. Chips and bark seize on me every time.

Wonderful recipe!  I did notice that the chocolate seized a little but I continued blending it and had no problems after that.  Just stick it out and it should turn out great.  Very smooth texture and glorious flavor!

Great cheesecake!  Lovely coffee/chocolate taste.  The only things I did different was to bake the base first, just put the chocolate in without the cream, and I put a water bath underneath the rack.  It came out perfectly, I timed 45 minutes exactly, it was really soft in the center but it set up really well without any cracks.

My first time making a cheesecake and it turned out AWESOME. (Even down to the chocolate leaves!) I made this for Thanksgiving for two different houses (both sides of the family) and everyone raved. It is rich so it serves quite a few people. Will be sure to make this again.

This cheesecake was excellent!! I followed it exactly, except I didn't have any liqueur and didn't want to buy some for just the recipe. I simply went to a very popular coffee chain, and asked for their strongest coffee. I used that for the liqueur and coffee it called for. The whip cream was great and I piped it on...I also got chocolate molds at the craft store and put leaves on top. I will use this again and again!!! OH! I used teddy grahams for the crust! Delicious!

I'm a chocolate fan, but this cheesecake was a tad too rich for even me!  Could have possible used more cooking time, as the center didn't firm as much as it should have.

I made my own coffee liquer using a recipe from this site - and I thought the cheesecake turned out good. It actually tasted a lot like the cappuccino bon-bons my Mom used to make. My only sore spot was the crust - I used oreo cookie crumbs because the grocery store didn't sell chocolate graham crackers - and the crust was rock hard and tasted slightly burnt. I think if I'd had and used chocolate graham crackers it would have worked better.

This cheesecake is awesome! I did not use the coffee flavored liqueur but used stronger coffee instead. Wonderful flavor!! I baked mine in a 13 x 9 in pan in a water bath. Had no problems with it being to watery in the middle. Thanks for such a great recipe!

AMAZING!!!!!!!! I originally made this for my co-workers in the office, but it didn't make it to the office.  This cheesecake is not a stiff cheesecake, but has a velvet texture, almost like a mousse.  Yes this cheesecake takes more time and dirties more than most cheesecakes, but not any more time or dishes than a lot of other cakes.  Make it, you won't regret it.

This was very good.  I didn't have any regular bailey's so I used mint flavor.  It was a nice touch.  When I make again I will use more cookie crumbs to make a thicker crust as it was a little thinner than I liked.  It was so good that I wanted more of it.

I made this for a Christmas party and everyone loved it. I used espresso instead of instant coffee from the other reviews. It wasn't as rich as i thought it was going to be, but very yummy.

I thought this cheesecake was really delicious and full of flavor, but nothing extraordinary.  In my opinion, the crust was a little "thin", therefore, if I did make it again, I would double that, for sure.  I made the cake exactly as instructed.  Everybody went crazy for it, but a little part of me wished I had just stuck to my original New York style cheesecake.

Two words to describe this one: "AB"..."FAB"!  This was a terrific cheesecake!  I made it for a potluck with pretty finicky friends. It tasted like chocolate mousse - just melted in your mouth.  Everyone loved it.  It's alot of work - it's tougher than most cheesecakes.  Use the liqueur - I don't care what everyone says.  There IS a difference in the taste and no, you won't get drunk.  I'd also recommend leaving the key refrigerated ingredients (cream cheese, butter, etc.) out for 4+hours before starting the process.  Finally, someone recommended baking the crust - good idea.  I crushed up chocolate cookies with the butter and baked for six minutes - it was a great idea. I'd make this again in a heartbeat - great holiday recipe and a sure winner!

I made this for my husbands birthday and he loves it. I doubled the crust recipe but I only put 2 tbs of sugar. I also only put 7 ounces of chocolate in the cheesecake instead of the 8. I will be making this again.

Very Rich!  I made this for a coworkers birthday and I work with a bunch of chocoholics and they loved it!  No one finished their slice, so I recommend thin slices of this cake.  I followed the directions to a T with the exception that I doubled the amount of instant coffee and didn't add Kahlua.  I didn't double the crust and it was fine as is.  I did let the cake cool in the oven with the door open for 45 minutes and I only had one very small insignificant crack- which is irrelevant with the whipped cream topping.  This cheesecake was too rich for me, but I still recommend this to chocolate lovers.

Thanks so much for the recipe. I used rum and ameretto because I didn't have coffee liqueur, and it turned out just fine. And instead of adding coffee liqueur to the whip cream for the topping, I just added some instant coffee and powdered sugar.
I will make this again soon.
Thanks again.

This was my first attempt at cheesecake and it was wonderful. The whole family enjoyed, even my picky husband. I use shot of espresso and Kaluha, for the coffee liquer. I will be making this again.

Everyone raved about this cheesecake. I used espresso in place of the instant coffee, but besides that, stuck to the recipe. My mother-in-law said I get the duty of making her birthday cake from now on, and her husband has been doing it for 30 years! Thank you!

I made this for Christmas Dinner.  Although the flavor was fantastic, I had trouble cutting this cheesecake.  It completely fell apart and the bottom crust was soggy.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I'm not sure what I did wrong.  I'm thankful I didn't have dinner guests.

This was my first ever cheesecake, I bought my first spring pan to be able to make it!  I made this cheesecake last valentine's day, and it turned out PERFECT!  My boyfriend I was dating at the time owns a high-end restaurant and served gourmet food and desserts, so I was pretty nervous about how it would turn out.  I followed the instructions to a T, but served it the same day.  We took the left overs to his restaurant and let all the chefs try it out.  Would definately make this again!!

A friend of mine works at the car dealership I bring my car to. Everyone treats my car like their own. I decided to treat them to something special.  My cheesecake got rave reviews. They haven't stopped talking about it.
FABULOUS!!!
11/2/07  I made this cake again for a girls get togther the other night. My friend Nancy said " I believe that was the best thing that has ever passed my lips".  All of our families will be together again this weekend and I was volunteered to bring dessert and guess what Nancy voted for. I have to agree. It is a fabulous recipe just the way it is. Everyone should try it.  A BIG THANK YOU to Cigdem Buke Ugur for sharing your recipe.  Happy Holidays to All

this recipe is fantastic, by far my favorite. i too used a expresso instead of the coffee and liquer, and also used chocolate grahams. i got a tiny crack in the top but who cares when it tastes that good? mine had to bake for just under an hour and it was perfect!

looks good and i had no problem with the process.  for those who had trouble with the chocolate seizing, you might try omitting the 2T whipping cream.  worked fine that way.  i gave four stars because it didn't turn out as dark as the picture.  i will definitely make again.

I wouldn't say this is the easiest cheesecake I've ever made, but the responses were great!  One friend even told me that this cheesecake is on par with the Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes.  I double the amount of whipped cream b/c it is simply delicious (and, as per my mom, I stick the beaters and mixing bowl in the freezer for 10-15 min before making the whipped cream).  You will not be disappointed!

I've prepared this cake for the first time for the Christmas evening supper. For me, insted of Whipping cream with Kahula, I covered it with coco power juste like in the picture. Nobody believed that I make it myself.  Everyone thought that it was from a high-notch professional bakery.  It was supreme to have a rich and deep chocolate flavour and a smooth velvety melting cheese texture in the mouth.  Absolutely recommended!!

This was absolutely awesome.  Instead of using a springform pan, though, I would recommend putting it in a water bath to bake it.  It turned out very creamy and smooth and the whipped topping to go with it made it divine.

Delicious!  Since we don't drink, I used 1/2 cup cream mixed with 4 t. instant coffee granules instead of the coffee/alcohol mix in the cheesecake.  The topping I used 1 cup cream mixed with a couple of tsp instant coffee and then sweetened to my liking.

I made this for my husband for his birthday and while it gets pretty expensive to make and takes a lot of effort, it was worth it!  Sinfully rich and unbelievably good, if you're a cheesecake fan, you've got to try this recipe.  Yum-yum!

Was excellent even w/o the Chocolate Liquer - I just added some extra instant coffee to compensate.

the 1st time i made it, the cake cracked at the centre. but it was fine the 2nd time i made it. cut down on the sugar though, and added 1 tsp more of coffee. also made more crumbs as i prefer a slightly thicker crumb base. definitely a VERY rich cheesecake but everyone loved it! my boss even asked me for more :)

Made this for Easter, was the only dessert with no leftovers - even the kids ate it up.  Mine did crack though despite the water bath & all. Will definatly add to my cheesecake favorites.  One person thought tasted salty.
