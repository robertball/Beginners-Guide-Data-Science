YUM! I hate going out and spending money on coffee milkshakes or smoothies so I was pretty jazzed when I tasted this and found that it was pretty similar to one you could get at a coffee shop. It's not exactly Starbucks here, but it's good and it's cheap. I used just a regular packet of hot chocolate mix instead of the breakfast mix, and it still came out just fine.

This would be 5 star if you used a richer milk, but with the non fat it is very good.  I didn't think 1 tsp of coffee crystals would be enough but it was for me.  I tried it with and without the cinnamon and prefer without.  This will save me lots of trips to Starbucks and therefore lots of $$$!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was my first attempt at making an iced mocha lette and I am pleased with the result.  I enjoy the little dash of cinnamon that the recipe lists as "optional" and I think it adds to the taste.  I used generic Stop & Shop instant coffee rather than Tasters Choice simply because of the price difference, and I'm still very happy with the result.  I could drink these alllll day!  Very quick and easy, too! YUM!!!

I made this for my kids last night.    They usually can't get enough of the icy mocha lattes that I make at home but 2 out of 3 glasses got dumped down the drain.   This tasted like a instant breakfast made with water.   There was no richness at all.   Maybe using whole milk would make a difference (I used 2%).
