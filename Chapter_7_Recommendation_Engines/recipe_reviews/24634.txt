Wonderful, quick, easy appetizer that looks and taste both professional and elegant.  After reading through numerous reviews, following are the most common listed changes:  1.)  toast the crostini;  2.)  add a clove of minced garlic;  3.)  less mayo - 2 vs 5 tablespoons;   4.)  add tomato;  5.)  reduce the red onion to 1/4 cup finely minced or substitute shallots;  6.)  top with cheese prior to baking.  With or without the changes, this appetizer is wonderful!

This recipe is awesome!  I love it!  I've served it at multiple parties, and it's always gone right away.  My only tip - lightly toast the bread under the broiler on each side before adding the topping and broiling.  The bread holds up much better this way.  Otherwise I find that it tends to get a bit soggy.  Otherwise, delicious!!

These are delicious!  This recipe will be a regular on my hors d'ouevres menu.  
I only used two tablespoons of mayo and added a good splash of olive oil and ground pepper.  It was still very creamy, so I think you could get by with just 1 tablespoon of mayo.
Also, make sure you use the MARINATED artichoke hearts or these will be bland.
These are quick and easy, and a great change from the usual hors d'ouerves.

Yum! Yum! YUM!!! This was sooo good. I made it for a potluck at work and everyone was raving about it! I followed the recipe exactly, plus added 1 clove of garlic, 1 totamo, 1 tablespoon of olive oil and then sprinkled parmasean on top. I put all of it in a big bowl and put garlic bagel chips around the bowl for everyone to dip instead of putting it on the bread. Great recipe! Will make over and over! Thank you!!!

This was very good.  Next time I make it I think I will add a little fresh garlic.  Definately toast the bread before topping with the artichoke mixture.  I tried it both ways.

WOW! These are so good!  We made them last night and have vowed to take them to the next party or event so we can impress everyone.  We made the receipe exactly as written, however when we do it again we will add some tomatoe's and a black olive to the top of each. I just can't imagine why some reviewers felt that these were bland...the only thing that I can think of is that unmarinated hearts were used.  The batch that we made was both full in flavor and delicious.  I'm SOOO happy to have found this recipe.  Thank you, thank you, thank you Roxanne!

I LOVE artichokes, so knew I would like this recipe. I did as other reviewers and added some chopped tomatoes, as well as used less mayo (probably 2 T). I agree that the crostini needs to be lightly toasted first to prevent sogginess. I added a step to this and melted approximately 1 T butter with 1 clove of garlic and very lightly brushed each crostini prior to the first toasting. Don't leave it in the oven long, just enough to begin to get a "crustiness" to the top of the crostini. Remove and add the artichoke mixture and bake as directed. The garlic butter gives it just a hint of garlic with the tiniest bit of buttery richness. YUM!

I'll have to say this was a flavorless dish.  Even after I tried to spice it up with some garlic it still tasted pretty bad.  I ended up throwing most of it away.

This is excellent.  I was looking for an easy but yummy appetizer, and this worked perfectly.  I used the ingredients stated, plus I added one chopped plum tomato and a little chopped spinach.  It was not only delicious, but colorful and pretty, too.  I also used whole wheat french bread.  My dinner guests ate every last piece and I also received the comment that they would've been satisfied with that as their dinner!  I agree that this is not a bruschetta.  I would classify it as more of a crostini (Even that might not be quite right), but whatever you call it, it's good.

This is a delicious topping for a baguette . However , the recipe is not for bruschetta . The word bruschetta - pronounced brew-sketta - implies a slice of toasted Italian bread that has been rubbed with a clove of garlic , then drizzled with quality olive oil , and finally seasoned with salt . This basic bruschetta may then be heaped with any of innumerable toppings , e.g. the artichoke topping in this recipe .

Buon appetito !

Very good Bruschetta, I also added one clove finely chopped garlic, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and i sprinkled shredded mozzarella on top before putting in the oven.  Excellent.

This was quick, easy, and FABULOUS.  I used only 1-1 1/2 tbsp of red onion, and added some diced tomato.  I must admit I love artichokes, but I can't say enough about this bruschetta.  Terrific both warm and cold.  Highly recommended!

This recipe was great except the onions really overpowered it. I would reduce the onions to 1 tablespoon or to omit it. Thanks! I've passed it on to several friends!

I added spinach to this and it was great!  I especially found this good as an accompaniment when having a chef salad as the main dish.

Nummy stuff!  Based on other reviews, I did cut back on the mayo.  I tried both toasted and untoasted bread, and I prefer the toasted. Aside from reducing the mayo, I initially followed the recipe. I tried the spread only on a single bruschetta, and, as others suggested, thought it could use some garlic. Tried another single toast and tought it was still missing just a little something.  Lemon zest did the trick.  Micro-planed about 1/2 tsp. It cut through the heaviness of the cheese and chokes and livened it up without overpowering.

This was very tasty. I sliced the bread in thin slices, brushed the slices with garlic oil and toasted them before topping with the bruschetta mix. Next time I will add a little more cheese.

This is *very* yummy ... it really hits the spot as an appetizer. Some artichoke dips are too "mayonaisse-ey" for me; this is not. The red onion gives it a nice bite, too. I added a dash of celery salt to the mixture before spreading it onto the sliced baguette.

This is truly amazing stuff...my husband couldn't even wait for me to top the baguette slices with the artichoke mixture and broil them, he just started dipping the bread right into the bowl (it was just as good!)  Very easy and quick to make - will definitely use this recipe again and again!!

Once again, my failure to prepare effected the end product.  Luckily, these were still a wonderful compliment to our penne pasta dinner.  However, the fact that I only had Miracle Whip and not regular mayonnaise effected the end product. Tangy miracle bruschetta... didn't quite have the effect I was looking for. There's always next time?

Really simple foolproof recipe.  I added Parmesan instead of Romano and added a few black kalamata olives.  I lightly pulsed everything in my cuisinart and topped with mozzarella cheese.

I TOTALLY changed this recipe to fit whatever I had on hand and incredibly, it still tasted great!  I used 2 T light mayo, a tablespoon of onion powder and garlic powder instead of red onion, a little less than 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese instead of Romano, half of a can of artichokes in water instead of marinated, and baked it in a small individual casserole dish on 375 for 15 minutes instead of putting on baguette.  Will use to spread on bread or crackers.  I can't believe it turned out good!  I would have tried the original recipe if I had the ingredients, however, the recipe was a great base and the reviews provided great inspiration for subs and adds.

This was a great recipe. However, I did make some changes. I added 4 small cloves of garlic, 1 whole (jarred) red pepper, and I only put in 1/4 cup of parmesan/romano cheese and 2 tbl of light mayo. Also, I put the onion, pepper and garlic in a food processor to chop very finely. Then I mixed all the remaining ingredients with the onion & pepper mixture. I think that made it nice and smooth. This was a huge hit!

Unbelievable!!  I used lowfat mayonnaise, and only 2 Tbl. red onion (just a personal preference), and topped with chopped tomatoes for a bit of color.  Big hit!  I served it with "Chicken Danielle," also from this site.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

The kids wouldn't touch this but the adults at the baby shower I hosted ate this up!  It's a keeper - easy, fast, and sounds/looks elegant!  Be sure sure just shrug when you serve it and say "Oh...it's nothing...".  Some diced tomatoes are a nice touch.

My husband and I recently attended an international wine tasting party. Each couple had to prepare an appetizer from another country.  We chose Italy and prepared this bruschetta.  It was voted the best appetizer by the 12 couples attending!

If you like artichoke dip, you'll like this recipe.  Quite tasty...  I used Parmesan cheese instead of Romano (by accident) and it came out just fine.

OMGOMGOMGOMG!!!!! This is so amazing!!!!   I just made this and devoured it and it's one of my all time favorite foods now!!! WOW..   I followed directions exactly except my can of artichokes was 14.5 oz, but since I don't like the slightly harder leaves, I trimmed them so that maybe made the artichoke mass less :)   I also guestimated the mayo, but probably used 4-5 tablespoons cause I LOVE mayo :)    I also used a pre-sliced baguette which made life so much easier!   I will make this ALL THE TIME!!!!!!!!

This is super easy and very tasty.  I like to toast my baguette rounds a little before I add the topping and bake, for a little extra crunch, but not necessary.  I realized I wanted to double this recipe AFTER I already had a single recipe made, it was a breeze to double.  Awesome!

I was craving something for a light lunch and couldn't decide until I found this--delicious! Only used 2 TBS of mayo, and added 1 clove minced garlic, and toasted the bread slightly before topping and broiling--This was one tasty, though odd, lunch!

A+ and easy to make!  Tip - Add a 1 tbsp. of lemon infused olive oil!  If you don't have that, do 1 tbsp. EVOO with 1/2 tsp. of lemon juice.  I also added 1/4 tsp. of sea salt.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I toasted the bread before adding the topping and I added tomatoes on top--very good. The only downside is that it does require you to be in the kitchen during a party. Artichoke dip is easier to take care of ahead of time.

A very versatile recipe--using ingredients on hand, I used bocconchini and green onions.  The only changes that I recommend is toasting the bread before and adding garlic.  I will make this again.

I added tomatoes and garlic because of the other reviews, but I would recommend leaving the recipe as is.  I think it is better.  I will also use artichokes in water next time, rather than marinated, because I think it will have a less sour taste.

These are really good, but I do think that you can cut back a little on the mayo.  I also think that next time I will try adding some chopped roasted red peppers for a little color and taste.

I give this four stars as written, but if you lightly toast the bread first, and add a little garlic to the artichoke mixture, this bruschetta is absolutely amazing. I could eat it every day. Thanks, Roxanne!

Great appetizer recipe! I toasted the bread before putting on the artichoke mix. Next time I'll saute the onions first (I don't like the raw flavor) with a little garlic maybe. I was really surprised as to how tasty this turned out though!

Like the previous reviewer, I added a chopped garlic clove and a chopped, seeded Roma tomato.  It was sooo good!  I used a whole wheat baguette and half light mayo.  I'm afraid to use the broiler :) so I baked it at 375 for 10 minutes, then turned it to 400 for another few minutes.  Just right!  I will make these often!  (I buy the big jar of marinated artichoke hearts from Costo, much cheaper!  I just use shy of 1 cup.)

I made these yesterday for a pre-Easter dinner and they were a hit.  I didn't add all of the red onion called for because it seemed like way too much and I'm glad that I omitted some because they could have used even a little less.  Still they were very good and very easy to make.  Also, I didn't put them in the broiler.  I put them in the oven at 325 for about 5 minutes.  I'll definitely be making them again.

When I made this, it seemed very bland even after adding tomatoes.  I found that I could taste the onion more than the artichoke!  I would not try this recipe.  I don't know why everyone raved about this?!

I thought this was good. I would make it again but I would reduce the mayonnaise. It was too overpowering. I did add garlic and I pretoasted the bread like other reviewers suggested. It was really good. I would have given it 4 stars but my husband wasn't as much of a fan as I was.

This was just ok.  I found it a little on the bland side, next time I will add garlic to see if that helps.

I was excited about trying this recipe, and thought I had all the ingredients, then realized too late that I di not have artichokes, and instead had a can of hearts of palm. Since I had already planned on making it, I decide to forge ahead and see how it turned out, and it was actually quite good. The only other changes I made were to add a tiny bit of minced garlic and use Gorgonzola instead of Romano. My BF, who hates mayonnaise, actually ate this and loved them. I'm looking forward to trying these again with artichokes!!! Sure that it will be as good if not better.

Excellent dip! I did have a few changes...I added a little cream cheese and used onion powder in stead of the fresh onion. But with the small tweaks I made, this tastes just like Costco's artichoke dip, which I can no longer buy because I don't belong anymore. And now, I don't have to keep asking my mother-in-law to pick a container up for me every time she goes to Costco. Thank you for sharing!

Everyone really like this.  I added 1 small clove of crushed garlic and just eye-balled the mayo.  I recommend broiling the bread a bit first, then add the topping and broiling again.  The kids have requested that I make this again already!  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum. I did add fresh garlic as well as 4 oz. of cream cheese. Next time I will add a fresh spinach to the bottom before toasting. It's a keeper!

Family and friends lived this one. Doubled the recipe and also put the artichokes through my food processor for a finer chop. Also reduced the mayo to just 2tblspns which was plenty. Added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and some cracked pepper. Served with store bought crostini toasts. Delicious!

these were a big hit at a recent dinner party.  A tad salty for my taste though, might have been the marinated artichoke hearts, might use plain artichokes next time and see if it makes a difference.

This wasn't quite flavorful enough for us despite adding a couple gloves of garlic and a serano pepper. Next time I think I will use a more potent cheese than parmesan.

This was fantastic!  I will be making it again.  I followed another reviewer's advice and toasted both sides of the bread before placing the topping on it to keep it from getting soggy.  Also brushed it with a little EVOO (before toasting) and scraped a garlic clove over it (after toasting) to add some additional flavor.

I followed a suggestion to use my George Foreman grill and brushing them w/EEVO before adding the artichoke mixture...this was a great recipe!  I made everything ahead of time (even grilling the bread) and made them up later in the day - everyone loved them!

This is a wonderful, basic recipe that takes alterations very well. I always add finely sliced garlic and a bit of sea salt to this, but sometimes I mix up other elements, as well. The red onion can be subbed with scallions. Diced roma tomatoes make a nice addition. Smoked gouda makes a good change of cheese. Given the flexiblility and solid quality of the base recipe, I highly recommend this one.

I made this recipe last night as an appetizer for dinner for my boyfriend. He enjoyed it. I took others advice and lightly toasted the bread slices before putting on the topping. Then broiling for the two minutes with the toppings on. I think I may cut down on the onion next time or add tomato. Very good as written though.

This recipe as written has to be wrong! If you use 5T of mayo to a small can of artichokes it would be swimming in mayo! I added 2 tomatoes some mozzarella and only used about 2 1/2T of mayo, and I probably could have used less than that even. I also added some lemon juice, toasted the baguette before putting the topping on, and added salt and pepper. I sprinkled the top with Parmesan before broiling and broiled for about 90 seconds (watch this stuff, it will burn fast)! The end result was great, but as written it's wrong and is probably what the 1 star reviewers are reviewing. Just use less mayo and this will turn out great!

Would be better to toast the bread with olive oil on it and warm mixture separately. Bread was nothing special without seasoning and did not toast well with mixture on top. Topping needs to be modified. Mayonnaise makes it heavy and greasy.

Made this last nite, my guests loved it! I added some chopped capers and toasted the bread as some here suggested. I also added mayonnaise as needed to the desired consistency and some chopped spinach. It's definitely a keeper, I well be making this again!

I was looking for a low calorie dip but couldn't find one.. Most of them need ton of mayo.. Well, this will be good base for my dip! As reading reviews, I did tweak a bit.
1) I used vegan mayo ( 60% less calorie and amazing taste!)
2) I did add one clove of garlic and tomatoes.
3) Instead of using marinated artichoke, I used fresh artichoke hearts and added 2 table spoons of my cilantro, jalepeno pesto which I also found the recipe from allrecipes.com.
I reduced the serving amount to half from the original recipe called for, and did the math, which the calorie came out to be only 301 calories for the entire serving! Great way to enjoy my new dip!
Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I put everything in the food processor which was a mistake. The taste was good but the texture would have been better if I had just chopped it and mixed it all together. I will make again following the recipe.

Turned out fantastic! Brought these little appys to a pot luck at my girlfriend's place and the ladies loved 'em. I used about 3 tblsp of artichoke dip I had leftover in my fridge as a base along with the 3 tblsp of mayo, and this helped add some extra kick. I also added tomato and garlic. Yummy!

This was great as a bruschetta spread.  I thought it also tasted good uncooked (cold) as a dip for crackers.  I made double the recipe and took as a pre-dinner snack with Townhouse crackers to Thanksgiving.  It was gone in under 30 minutes and three people asked me for the recipe!! Everyone loved it

Soooo good! I just made them and my husband and I ate them all up for lunch. I added a bit of tomato. I don't think you have to add it, but it was a nice touch. These will be great for the holidays! You could make up the topping ahead of time and preslice the bread and keep in a ziploc bag. So then putting them together with guests there would be a snap!

This was good, but definitely not a brushetta. We added tomatoes (from suggestion of another review), which was so a great idea! We eye-balled the mayo since 5 tablespoons seemed like a bit much. This was easy to make and a great hit at Christmas Eve dinner with my family! It is also good cold, so it can be used as a dip!

Really good, made with cream cheese instead of mayo, also blended everything in a food processor, still good. Have this with a salad for a complete meal.

The first time I made this was for 80 people.  At least 15 people asked me for my recipe!  I only changed it a little by adding finely minced tomatoes and substituting green for red onion.  Yummy

SO yummy!  I added some diced tomatoes, and took other reviewers' advice and toasted the bread before adding the topping.  Delicious!  Even the kids loved it!

I have made this according to the recipe and it is very delicious. However, after making this several times, I prefer to omit the onion and add 1 cup cooked spinach.

Very good recipe.  I was looking for an alternative to the normal tomato bruschetta for my husband (he hates tomatoes).  We nixed the onion and added a few chopped jalapeno circles instead.  It added a nice kick and a little more flavor.  I highly recommend!

Delicious! I added a can of diced tomatoes, drained. I only used about 2 tbs of mayo and I brushed the bread with olive oil and broiled it until it was crispy. Yummy yum!

Wonderful taste.  My DH who normally won't touch anything without meat liked it (so that's saying a lot lol!).  I only used 3 tablespoons of the mayo but added 1 tomato and 2 cloves of garlic.  Also toasted the bread in a 450 degree oven before putting the topping on.  (My oven at the broiler setting will burn most things within minutes so I avoid using that setting at all costs.)

I made this last night for our weekly LOST party and it was a huge hit! Next time I'm going to try to use a little less mayo like everyone suggests (maybe 2Tbsp) and a splash of olive oil. After I took it out of the oven I left it for about 10m then served- AMAZING! I will totally be making this again. =)

These are great!  I toasted the bread before adding the topping.  I also used cheddar cheese rather than romano, and used canned, unmarinated artichokes.  They were a hit.  Even someone who said she doesn't like artichokes said they were fabulous.

This recipe was delicious, but I had to modify it a little. I used half of the mayo it asked for, as it looked like a lot as I was putting it in. I also added some garlic and tomato. One of my favorite Bruschetta recipes and will make again!

Delicious and simple to make. I only made one adjustment to the recipe. I added 3 cloves of garlic, minced. I did not broil the bread ahead of time and my husband and dinner guests devoured them. Thanks for a great recipe.

Outstanding! I toast the bread in broiler about 2 min before adding the topping and broiling until a little brown. I have used the italian blend cheese the last several times and its worked great.  Awesome recipe, a real crowd pleaser!

This recipe was a hit at my dinner party.  I made a few adjustments...added some garlic, chopped up some tomatoes, chopped some fresh spinach, hand full of fiesta blend kraft cheese, italian seasonings, salt & pepper.  I did have a little left over so for dinner the next day I made chicken and topped it with this.  Yummy!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it was a hit!  I made it for a New Year's Eve party and it was gone in a heart beat.  Even the kids liked it!  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was very good. I did put tomatoes in it, because others in my family like them. I don't think I will next time. I will definitely make this again.

Very good although I made a couple modifications. I like tomatoes so I add chopped romas. Also use hald mayo and half sour cream b/c the consistency is better. I also cook them longer, b/c we like the bread nice and crispy. Haven't tried it but I bet it would be better to crisp the bread first, add toppings, and then heat toppings through. Very good bruschetta recipe though!

Fantastic!! I love artichokes, but I really adore the typical tomato bruschetta, so I added a drained can of chopped tomatoes (as that was all I had on hand). The canned tomatoes made the mixture so juicy that I cut down on the mayo, which really made it the perfect consistency (even without the tomatoes I don't think it would need all 5 Tbl). And the flavor was awesome!! I will definitely make this again.

This was really good.  I I toasted the bread separately and served this as a spread along with a crab spread.  It went over really well.  We actually liked combining the two spreads together as well as having them plain.

All around fabulous.  I added 2 tomatoes.  My family ate them ALL as an Easter appetizer.  Even my 15 month old devoured 2 of them.  It was SO quick and easy. Many requests for the recipe too.

This was a big hit but I did make a few changes. I doubled artichokes and cheese (Parmesan), 6 tbls mayo, omitted onion, added garlic, basil, oregano, and sun dried tomatoes. Delicious!! Thank you for basic recipe! Variations are endless!

I bought the marinated artichoke hearts from Costco, as well as the hunk of romano cheese.  I spread the marinade from the artichokes on the bread before putting on the spread, just because it was there and seemed a good idea.  I didn't use the onions, but for color sprinkled diced pimento (red peppers) on top.  I thought it was a little on the salty side (but that may have been the type of romano I used) but this got RAVE reviews and everyone took seconds.  So simple, pretty and crowd-pleasing!!

With alterations, pretty dang good :) There's no problem using non-marinated artichokes as long as you zuzh it up with other flavors. Here in Seattle we have a product called Mama Lil's Peppers. I chopped up a couple tablespoons of these peppers, added in a tablespoon of the pepper oil, then also added a crushed clove of garlic, a couple tablespoons of minced shallot, a couple tablespoons of mayo, some parsley, and parm. Topped this mixture on toasted bread, then sprinkled more parm on top before broiling. Really great!

This is a VERY delicious appetizer.  My only alterations are for the sake of adding color.  Suggestions for tomatoes, spinach, etc. are very nice.  I tried to add shrimp once and didn't get the full punch of a seafood dish so I'll try again with more.

first time reviewing - awesome recipe and listened to others: added garlic and reduced mayo. lightly toasted bread first. Had the 'king of artichoke dips' over and he said I did well and to keep the recipe, so I'll take that as a winner. may want to experiment with the diced tomatoes next time?

These bruschettas were good but I thought they would be tastier. 
Next time I might use miracle whip instead of real mayo, and maybe add some garlic. Definitely broil the baguette slices on each side before adding the topping.

Made the recipe with half the mayo and some sun-dried tomatoes, and thought it was good.  But the next day I added fresh diced tomatoes and served it cold with warm toasted baguette slices on the side and LOVED it!

This was good but not outstanding. It was very easy and quick to make. Per other reviews, I toasted the bread slices prior to topping them and then rubbed them with garlic. (Be sure to spread the topping to the edges of the bread if it's pre-toasted or they may burn.) They were tasty, but I think the addition of spinach and/or some drained Muir Glen roasted tomatoes would punch up the flavor.

I didn't like this at all, but my girl loved it.  I thought it was just wayyy too onion-y and didn't like the way it cooked.  Next time I'd lay off the onion, realllllly drain the artichoke or use spinach instead.  A nice idea, if you use ingredients to proportion.

Instead of topping each baguette with the wonderful dip, I just placed everything in a shallow casserole dish and baked. So wonderful and addicting!! Thanks!

Delicious appetizer.  I skipped the onion-used onion powder instead-cut down on the mayo-about 2.5 T.-and it turned out delish!

This is now my "go-to" party food.  I just mix it earlier in the day or the night before, and then borrow the host's oven to toast them right at the party.  They are really yummy!

Absolutely delicious!!!  I was not expecting thos to be as tasty as it is.  Next time I'll cut back slightly on the Romano cheese, as I think it is a bit overpowering.  Also, I used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise and added 1/3c of spinach, which I'll continue to do.  I definitely recommend this recipe!

Yum!  This was very good.  I love garlic so I rubbed a clove on each piece of bread before adding the topping.  I also only used 3 Tb. of mayonnaise. Five Tb. scared me.

I recently served this at a dinner and they went over *very* well.  We did feel they were a tad tart, probably due to the marinade from the articokes, but sure to drain very well.  I also added a couple roma tomatos for color.  They were lovely and very impressive.

I got rave reviews of this dish!  Every last one was devoured quickly.  I doubled the recipe, but kept the original amount of onions to keep from overpowering, and added a diced tomato.  It turned out great!  Be sure to spread as far to the edges of the bread as possible to keep them from burning.  It took mine about 5 minutes under the broiler instead of the suggested 2.  I will definitely be making this again!

Ridiculously good- this was a HUGE hit at a party recently. I cut down on the amount of onion- as suggested by others, lightly toasted the bread first- as suggested by others, and made sure to add plenty of cheese! I will absolutely make this again- without a doubt! Lots of people asked for the recipe.

Quite good! I toasted the bread in the oven under the broiler for a few moments before doing the spread. It was a huge hit - next time I won't put quite so many onions in. It overpowered the spread just a bit too much for me.

I loved this recipe as did my office.  I only made the following changes.  I heated up olive oil with crushed garlic.  I discarded the garlic & brushed the bread with the garlic oil.  I also did not add the red onion to the mixture.  I put a few pieces of red onion & tomatoes which I marinated with basil on top of each piece of bread.  This recipe delighted all the people in my office.  You will now have more people checking out this website!

The recipe was good, but for my own personal taste I added garlic powder and reduced the ammount of onion. My bread didn't get very crispy, either.

Very, very good.  My bread burned on the edges, not sure how to prevent that, but the bruschetta was wonderful.  I am going to make some more today, just as a dip.
Thanks for sharing... it is a favorite appetizer in my house now.

I have made this several times and it's wonderful!  It's easy and impressive!  One of my favorite appetizers!  I do tweek it just a little bit by brushing with melted butter/garlic powder and toasting the bread slightly on both sides prior to adding the topping.  I also add a mixture of mozzarella and cheddar to the top!

Gross! Followed the recipe verbatim and no one in my family could eat this dish.
Too much mayonnaise. 
If I decide to redo it, I would toast the bread first, put WAY less mayonnaise, add tomato, maybe some spinach, and more cheese.

The author has no clue what bruschetta is, and this is not bruschetta. They must have overheard the term somewhere and thought it meant anything placed on to bread.

I made this as part of our New Year's Day dinner--this was the appetizer.  I thought it was quite bland.  The only ingredient I changed was from romano cheese to parmesan cheese.  I even toasted the baquette slices ahead so they wouldn't get soggy and several reviewers suggested this step.  I let my mixture sit in the 'fridge to blend flavors for about 3 hours before cooking.  Anyway . . . there were lots left over--not super  popular.  Just bland, in my opinion.

This recipe is delicous! The only thing I did different was i added 1.5 cups of fresh spinach and baked them in the oven at 400 for 15 minutes. This has become one of my husbands favorites.

I made it exactly as written. Guests gobbled it up. But my husband and I both thought it would be even better with a little more kick. So next time, I'm going to add a splash of Tabasco and try that.

I made a few changes based on necessity: I replaced French bread with Italian and Red Onion with White Pearl Onions (because I didn't have and don't like red). It definitely needs the onion to balance out the mayo, though. Next time I'll probably put less mayo but otherwise keep the same. You could probably use Mozzarella or even grated Parmesan and not notice either - save yourself a few bucks.

As well as toasting the bread prior to adding the bruschetta, I added tomatoes and fresh garlic and only used about 3 tablespoons of mayo. It was a great appetizer and very easy.

Yummy, easy, might use fat-free mayo to feel less guilty next time. Half dry parm and half shredded mozzarella substitute well, as does multi-grain or wheat french breads, but may need a little pre-toasting if you want more of that chewy crunch.

The end result was amazing, but I think mainly because I added fresh garlic, it really enhances the flavour.  Also use a good quality mayo!

I made it in a hurry and didn't read any of the reviews, so I made it exactly as it is written. We liked it but agreed it could use a "kick." It is SUPER fast to whip up (put the artichokes in your mini food processor) and broil. I will make it again but will check out some of the additions others liked. Thank you - I love simple app recipes!

Wonderful idea!  As other cooks suggested, I used only one tablespoon of mayo and substituted the rest with olive oil. I also added pepper and used shredded Romano cheese rather than grated.  Instead of broiling the dip, I put it in the oven along with another app at 375 degrees for 5-10 minutes.  Meanwhile, I brushed a little olive oil on the baguette slices and toasted them in the toaster oven. I presented the bread on a plate and the dip in a bowl.  Next time, I'm going to try it without mayo. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was delicious. I used fresh artichokes, which I prepared by boiling in water with freshly squeezed lemon juice. Used this as an appetizer for dinner with friends. They loved it! Thank you.

Pretty good-- the mayo might have been slightly overpowering. I will add garlic next time as well. I took other users advice to lightly toast beforehand to prevent it from becoming soggy. Overall, pretty solid appetizer.

Delicious!  It was artichoke dip on bread(my favorite)  I also toasted the bread first and rubbed garlic on it.  
I added the tomatoes for color, but got most the moisture out first.  Next time I'll try adding spinach...Yum

Made this several times and have been a winner each time.  I reduce the onion a little as I am not a huge fan...BUT don't eliminate, needs the onion.

This bruschetta is just OK.  I guess I am partial to the traditional tomato and garlic version.  We found the artichoke flavour was quite heavy in this recipe.  So for those people who like the "oil marinated" artichoke taste, then you will indeed enjoy this recipe.

This is great! I make it all the time!! Very, very good! I've made it with greuer and jack cheeses (separately) and it's great with any type of cheese! This is super easy to make. I've been making it as a little snack for my boyfriend to have when he gets home from work while I finish dinner. :)

Was good, but a little disappointing.  I think it needed some salt and garlic.  Would try again with some minced garlic and 1 tsp. salt to see if this improved the taste.

Delicious.  I cut down the mayo like other reviewers and added some seedless tomato chopped.  We loved it and so did my 4-year old.

This recipe was very tasty!  If I had not read other reviews, I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much, but after reading them, knew better.  I added 1 chopped tomato, and only used 3 tbsp of mayo.  Will definately make again!

This was delicious. I put a can of tomatoes on, which added a great flavor. I didn't add all the mayo it called for, it would have been way too runny.

This recipes calls for a ridiculous amount of mayo. I took others advice and cut it down to 3tbl, but that was still far too much. We threw it out, it tasted just like mayo. If I make this again, I would use 1-1.5 tbl of mayo only.

I expected that I'd really like this one, but I think it was a little too heavy on the mayo for my taste.  I'll try it again with that edit.  Also, I would recommend adding the tomatoes as well.  It added a little extra flavor.

This recipe was great the first time.  The second time I made a few modifications, it was even beter.  I added two tablespoons of cream cheese and chopped roasted red peppers.  My guests raved.

This is really good for a fast and impressive appetizer - I added some frozen thawed spinach and diced roma tomato - very pretty. I cheated and used Panetini garlic toasts instead of bread - I had it ready to serve in about 15 minutes.

The taste of the artichokes was lost in the cheese. To me it tasted like bread covered with romano cheese sauce. It was still pretty good, but I would look for another recipe if you want to showcase the artichokes.

We loved this - can't wait to make this again - have to buy some more artichokes!!! The only thing I did differently was take others advice by adding some olive oil and some minced garlic.  This original recipe which said fed 8 only served 2 of us!  And we could have gone for more!!!

I agree with the others.  Revise the recipe by toasting lightly first, go heavier on the cheese, lighter on the onions, and it is a wonderful appetizer!

Sorry, we didn't care for this. Maybe next time, I will try the tomatoes or spinach.
