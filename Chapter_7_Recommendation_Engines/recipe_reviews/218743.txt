1 1/2 Tablespoons of liquid is not enough to dissolve 1/2 cup sugar into (butter will not dissolve sugar) After following the recipe as it is posted here I ended up with a seized-up sugar-butter-whiskey mass and had to do the syrup part over with changes. My recommendation is to make the cake according to the directions on the box without adding whiskey to the water. Then make the syrup by mixing 1/2 cup whiskey and 1/2 cup sugar stirring to dissolve sugar.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium and cook 5 minutes. 1 or 2 Tablespoons butter can then be added, stir until butter melts. Gently apply the syrup over the warm cake layers with a pastry brush until all the syrup is used or poke the cakes all over with a skewer and drizzle the syrup . To me, a whole cup of butter in the frosting is excessive. 1/2 cup is plenty.

This cake is delicious but really time consuming.  For those having trouble with the beer caramelizing, it needs a touch more sugar and it has to be cooked at a high heat.  Next time I will use a little less sugar in the frosting because it was really really sweet.  Everyone loved this.  I was prepared to hate it and liked it too.

I had a really hard time with the stout caramel reducing to an actual working consistency, so instead I just drizzled it like the whiskey butter sauce. Also, I added a lot more baileys to my frosting, almost another half cup... It was a lot tastier! I brought them to a party and everyone thought they were to die for! Thank you

This cake was the best cake I ever made! Thank you for sharing this recipe! The next time I make this cake I think I will add a thin layer of frosting to hold the two layers better.

A crowd pleaser for sure- IF you can get the consistency of the frosting and caramel right.  I only used 1 stick+2 tbsp of butter for the frosting and it wasn't too soft for the cake.  I have not yet figured out how to make the caramel without it getting too hard.

This cake was fantastic and moist. I did have some issues with the Guinness Caramel but no one seemed bothered. It instantly made it to my spouses top favorite desserts list.

The Guinness-carmel never caramelized, and the Baileys frosting was so overpowering we couldn't eat the top of the cake. So disappointing, especially since it was my boyfriend's birthday cake. I even followed other reviews and tried their techniques.

I made this wonderful cake over the weekend for an Irish friend's birthday party. He loved it and so did everyone else. I did have to adjust the icing, adding about another 2 cups of confectioner's sugar and about 3T more irish cream ( i used carolan's) Because you could taste nothing but the butter. , however, it was probably one of the best icings ever, very smooth, wonder flavor, excellent. The next time i make this cake, I will double the stout beer carmel, as it was only enough four one layer. but still a wonderful recipe thank you.

I am the original poster of this recipe!  It's crazy to come back a few years later and see people trying (and rating) a recipe you created.  I know that All Recipes edits everything before they post, and I am wondering if things were lost in translation when edited and officially published.  When I originally submitted, my instructions were to prepare the cake according to the box recipes, only substituting 1/2 of the water for whiskey.  This right here might produce different results as some box mixes are very different than others!

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday and it was a hit! Followed recipe  except for the frosting..I cut the butter and sugar in half and added more Baileys. The Guinness did not caramelize, so I poured onto first layer of cake. I also put a layer of frosting in between the stacking and it worked out perfect! This simple but delish cake has inspired and motivated me to get in the kitchen and bake!

I overlooked the Jamison syrup so it was a little crystallized and that turned out to be everyone's favorite part of the cake - the crunchy part. Only used one stick of butter in the frosting which seemed like the perfect amount to frost my 9 x 13 cake. My Guiness syrup caramelized beautifully, I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar to it. I thought it balanced out the flavors of the Jamison, Guiness and baileys very nicely. It did taste like an Irish car bomb.

I am in NO means a cook, but I really wanted to make my favorite holiday a good one! I found this recipe and gave it a whirl. I have to say, it was very difficult for someone like me but I did accomplish it! 

My difficulties were when I made the whiskey syrup, I made it quicker than I was thinking it would take me, so it hardened up before I could pour it into the cake, so I had to do it again. Next, was the caramel sauce! That was the worst part! If it was necessary to have it, I would get rid of it! It was soooo hard! And sticky. When I finally got it as caramelized as I could, which I had to do all of the additions everyone said in the previous comments, the parts that dripped over the cake, but landed on my cake dish would not come off! I had to scrap it off with a knife. I was so scared at that point. Next came the frosting. It didn't thicken up, which judging by 2 of the pictures, there's didn't either, I'm guessing because of the baileys. But it tasted great! 

Then came serving time. I was terrified, still about the caramel sauce, and that it was going to ruin the whole cake, make it hard to eat and sticky. But it was AMAZING! It was so soft and delicious! You could definitely taste the alcohol, no complaints here! I sent this recipe to my mother in law and sister in law who are both great cooks and waiting to see if they have the same difficulties I did.

Great recipe. Would most likely do it again next year!

This cake was so much fun!! It has quite a few ingredients, and I was really careful making it, but came out great and everyone loved it.  The car bomb theme and all the alcohol in it made it a party all it's own!!  Fantastic!!

Awesome!!  Cut the icing recipe in half.  Take care that the guinness caramel doesn't burn... it didn't taste that great, consider using some real caramel instead

The cake was good, guests had at least two pieces and ignored the Guinness "caramel" dripping all over or the crystallized whiskey "syrup". The Bailey's frosting actually saved the cake in the opinion of our guests. Will try it again. and maybe try a different way to handle the Guinness caramel and the hint on the ""syrup"

I was prepared to completely hate this cake, as I don't like whiskey or Guinness. I made it for my boyfriend's birthday, because he loves Irish car bombs and whiskey and Guinness, so it seemed perfect. And as far as he was concerned, it was! He loved it, and most of his friends loved it too! I wasn't a huge fan; the description is not lying when it says the whiskey flavor is dominant, but I still liked it more than I thought I would. I did use yellow cake mix instead, just because I didn't have french vanilla, and I couldn't get the Guinness to caramelize like it said, but I just drizzled it over the cake and it was perfectly fine. I'll be making this again!

This cake is not worth the time energy and effort.  The Guiness caramel sauce never did caramelize and was more like a Guiness syrup.  I would do a variation of it using a 9x12 pan and poke holes in the top of it and use the guiness syrup to saturate the cake.  The Baileys butter cream frosting is nice,so you could add that on the top.  I thinkjthe recipe needs reviewed.  Caramel sauce usually has a fat element in it.  This caramel sauce did not.

This was really good! I especially loved the caramel sauce. HOWEVER, the frosting was very buttery. I think next time I will try to use 1 stick of butter instead of 2. It would definitely be healthier that way!

I see that many had problems with the Guinness caramel sauce. Also it was quite bitter. I drizzled it over the icing trying to go for an Irish spiral. But next time I will not even make the sauce, the rest of the cake is wonderful!

I made this cake for work and everyone LOVED it!!  I have been asked to make for a couple people's birthdays as well.  I would recommend this to anyone as it is very easy to make.  I made it as a sheet cake instead of a layered cake and just adjusted the baking time accordingly.

I made this for my bf birthday. the recipe was actually easy to follow and tasted great.  I noticed with the measurements for the frosting, it made it tasted like salted buttercream, adding a touch moe confectioners sugar and baileys fixed that . Also, the whiskey in the batter is really strong, but does seem to cook out a bit. It turned out to be a big hit, especially topping it with chopped heath bar.
