This is a delicious soup.  I did make a few changes, not because it is a bad recipe, but because I'm on a diet and I'm always looking for ways to alter full-fat recipes without sacrificing too much taste.  I did make this soup with only 1.5 tablespoons of butter - I found that the onion sautes fine in that much or even less.  That alone saves 150 calories and 15g of fat off the total recipe.  I also used 1% milk and a tiny bit of cornstarch for thickening, without great detriment to the taste.  That also saves 300 calories and 28g of fat.  In the end, my product has 120 calories and 5.6g of fat, and I think it tastes just as good!

Our favorite pumpkin soup recipe.  We use fresh pumpkin, baking it covered, cut into quarters until tender (1 hour), then scraping out the flesh, then pureeing.  We use rice milk instead of half and half because of a milk intolerance in the family.  Wonderful.

LOVELY flavor!  I like to be a bit heavier on the curry for my own personal affection with the spice.  I also cut out about half of the butter and use skim milk - the flavor does not suffer!  To thicken slightly I combine 1 tsp of cornstarch with the skim milk to make up for the cut fat.

Simply the best! I followed the directions to a tee and it was wonderful. My guests enjoyed it as well. I did not puree it and found that it was still great. I served it with a spinach salad and warm homemade bread. Will definitely do it again!

this is a wonderful recipe!  i used fat free half and half and the taste was great.  make sure that you really mince the onions or they can be over powering.  enjoy!

This was really good and easy to make!  I made a few changes, but overall it was the same recipe and as is was delicious!  The only changes I made were to sub evap. milk for the heavy cream (unavailable right now in all the stores..the evap worked just fine and saved some calories at the same time!) and added some extra curry, and threw in some extra salt, pepper, nutmeg (just a dash or two) and ginger.  Right now there is no sour cream here either, so just had it straight up and hubby and I both enjoyed it for Halloween dinner last night (and I am enjoying a 2nd bowl for brunch right now!). Yummmm! Next time I will puree some celery and carrots in as well as the onions I think for more flavors.

I read many pumpkin soup recipes....but tried this one for the holidays.  I substituted the boullion and water for 1-1/2 cans vegetable broth as my daughter is a vegetarian. This soup was a perfect blend of spices and everyone loved it.....even those that were afraid to try it went back for seconds.

I didn't think I liked pumpkin soup, but I LOVED this.  My husband, who was very negative at the idea of pumpkin soup, ate 4 bowls.  My 3 year old, who didn't even want to taste, asked for a bowl for herself, once I put a few drops in her mouth.  We used 2 cups of our own pumpkin puree, and since I wasn't too sure about the quantities meant by 3 bouillon cubes, I used two cubes (each of the cubes I use would normally make 2 cups of bouillon).  We used half 35percent cream and half 2percent milk, but I think I could reduce the cream content without a problem.  It didn't need the sour cream or chives in my opinion.

This recipe was excellent. Lots of smiles all round the dinner table. I didn't user the Libby's Pumpkin in a can but rather an organic sweet dumpling squash which i roasted.

Wow!  I have been looking for a pumpkin soup since we had a fabulous one on our honeymoon 10 years ago so I have tasted many bowls of pumpkin soup over the years.  This one is the best and may be what we had 10 years ago.  I added a teaspoon of nutmeg and used cream instead of half and half.  Yum!

Wow! I didn't know what to expect from this.  To me, pumpkins are for dessert, not soup.  But yum!  I used olive oil instead of butter and homemade broth instead of bouillon.  It did need way more salt, but I am sure that is because I did not use the bouillon cubes.  A keeper!

This was a fantastic recipe, and it was the HIT of my Thanksgiving dinner, along with an AllRecipes dish, Spinach Muenster Quiche.  I added a touch of ginger, and served it in bread bowls!  Everyone loved it so much, they didn't have room for much turkey!

This recipe is wonderful. The soup was so creamy that my roommate didn't believe that there wasn't any cream in it. I substituted vegetable broth to make it vegetarian. I also tried using less red pepper (or omitting it altogether) to make a milder soup that my girlfriend prefered.

I added 1 cubed yam and a big can of lentils for substance.  Also I didn't use the cream but instead a can of coconut milk.  Yum!  Oh and I added about a tablespoon of cayenne for some bite ;)

only ok.  The only thing I did different was to use 3 cups chicken broth and a tad more salt.   I was able to eat mine with chopped chives and sour crean on top.  No one else in my family liked it.  I thought it had to much curry flavor and my husband thought it had too much pumpkin (squash) flavor.  I know it wasn't my cup of tea (although I ate mine) when I didn't want seconds.

Very, very good! Since I wasn't sure of my company's preferences, I went easy on the curry and the crushed red pepper. It was still delicious, and the sour cream calmed down the spiciness nicely. I look forward to making this again.

This is the best pumpkin soup I've ever had!  I made it for Thanksgiving, and even my picky grandpa that hates pumpkin with a passion asked for seconds. I made one small change though - I didn't have crushed red pepper so I used cayenne.

I loved the scents that filled my kitchen when I was making this--exotic and delicious.  The final result had a very strong curry flavor, almost too strong by itself (I served this with a hearty Irish Soda Bread, good dipping!).  My husband despises pumpkin though, and isn't a huge fan of curry either, but he really enjoyed this.  

I did forget to put that dollop of sour cream on it though.  Today I had the leftovers for lunch, and remembered that addition; it really helped tone down the curry flavor--then it was really good.

I pretty much followed the recipe to a tee, but I did use cream as opposed to half and half.  It had an awesome texture.  This is a great autumn/winter comfort soup for a cold day.

Oh, this was heavenly! It tastes so exotic. I wouldn't skip the last step of blending the soup even though it's extra cleanup--it really makes the soup smooth, slightly thick and oh-so-creamy! I might throw caution to the wind and try it with cream instead of half-and-half, to really spoil myself :)

Absolutely amazing.  I love this soup so much.  I didn't blend it because I didn't feel like making a mess and I like the texture.  Next time I make it I may not even add the milk just to reduce fat and calories.  I followed others adviced and added red pepper flakes, double curry extra salt a dash of cumin and a dash of nutmeg.  WOW excellent recipe.

Overall a nice recipe. I really enjoyed it. I thought the amount of spice was just right. Husband and family felt it was okay.

This got mixed reviews at our house.  I thought it was excellent and my husband didn't care for it.  Gee, I guess I'll have to eat all the leftovers!  Before I added the pumpkin and half and half I used a hand held blender to puree the onions.  It worked great and I didn't have the mess of cleaning up another appliance.  Great recipe.  I enjoyed it.

This was soo good. I did add some nutmeg, and I might add some more red pepper  next time ( I like things a little more spicy), but overall this was one of the best soups I have made. Perfect for fall and winter. I served it with a nice rustic bread...mmm good!

This soup is truly great!! I only substituted fat free half-and-half for regular half and half and for some reason the soup was blended enough and thin enough not to need blending. Tastes Great!!

I altered this recipe to make it vegan since I had some vegan guests coming over.  Instead of butter, I used Earth Balance spread to saute the onions and garlic, and I used Soy creamer instead of half and half.  I was afraid that it would give the soup that weird soy milk taste, but it didn't.  It was a creamy and tasty soup; I actually wish I had doubled the recipe because it was gone in about 5 minutes.  Everyone loved it.

This is THE BEST soup i have ever made. I used fresh  pumpkin, which I baked before. I used only half of the half and half and the other half low fat milk. It was absolutely delicious!

Superb!  I loved this soup. To make it even better, add 6oz of button mushrooms (sliced and sauteed) to the soup after putting it through the blender. Perfect soup for guests.  They'll be very impressed and it's so easy.
