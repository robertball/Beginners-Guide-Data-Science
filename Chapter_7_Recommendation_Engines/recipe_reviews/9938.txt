I was wary of being the first to try this recipe, but I figured I'd take the chance.
My problem was that I wasn't sure what these were supposed to look like in the end.  I ended up rolling these out as flat as I could and then using an upside-down cup to cut circles so they would all look consistent.  Then, after filling with strawberry preserves, I crimped them shut with a fork.  The dough seemed a bit crumbly at first but got easier to work with once I started rolling them out a bit.  While cooking, some of the jelly seeps out and hardens on the cookie sheet (but can be easily cleaned off with very hot water).  In the end, they ended up tasting like mini strawberry pies.  They have a nice appearance for giving as gifts.

We make these cookies every year, at least 10 batches of them. You have to chill the dough, or you will not be able to work with it. Then we make them in the thumbprint style. This is a great recipe for the kids to help with. Fill thumprint with home made preserves, we use raspberry and strawberry. Also, we just bake them until the bottoms are just turning golden, and cool on a wire rack. Very easy made this way, and LOTS of compliments.

I make a cookie almost exactly like this.  The dough is much, much easier to work with if you chill it for an hour or more in the fridge after mixing.  Roll it out with a rolling pin on a floured surface, and use a cookie cutter to get the flat rounds.

I wish there was a way to get more filling into these cookies. It's such a small amount of jam, that when the cookies puff during baking, there isn't much filling in comparison. I refrigerated the dough overnight, but needed to let it warm up for quite a while before I could work with it. Like others, I rolled the dough out and cut it with a 3" round cutter. I made some cookies with apricot jam and some with homemade cherry-raspberry jam. I used a little water to help the dough stick to itself and pressed it with the tines of a fork to help seal in the jam. Some still leaked out, but it did help. This is a very tender, flaky cookie. They are best eaten the first day or two. I haven't had the opportunity to try freezing them. I would like to try using a chunkier fruit filling in the future. Tip: If rolling out the dough for cutting, roll between two sheets of waxed paper lightly dusted with flour. This makes the job much simpler!

Trust me, if you refrigerate the dough overnight the dough is much easier to work with. My hungarian grandmother made these cookies! Very good!

These were a pain in the butt to make.  The dough was sort of difficult to work with and the filling all bubbled out.  but, they did taste alright.

Love it! After reading the reviews, I rolled out the dough used a cookie cutter and crimped it shut so the preserve does not seep out. It worked beautifully. These cookies are delicious.

These cookies were no good!! They have no taste except for the homemade jelly on them. Must be something missing in the ingredient list.
