This was a really good base recipe.  It can be tweaked based on what you have on hand.  I added in some celery, carrots, and Andouille sausage and a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning.  I only used about 5 nice sized potatoes, a pound seemed like a lot, and 1 bag of corn.  It was so rich, creamy, and flavorful!

I just finish preparing this dish as is.  I accidentally bought frozen sweet corn in a butter sauce. I have to say even with the sweet corn and butter sauce the dish was very tasty.

This was really good! I decided to make this last minute and did not have any leeks, clam juice, or frozen corn so I added some onion powder, chicken broth and a can of sweet corn in their place. I also added some old bay seasoning for some extra flavor.

I had to add a lot to give this flavor. I saut√©ed celery and carrot with the leeks.  I wish I had Old Bay, but added Cajun seasoning along with smoked paprika, garlic powder and parsley. I used milk for less fat, added half the clam juice (reserved the other half for later) and threw a couple of bay leaves in while I simmered for thirty minutes or so. I added the corn and a little bit of chopped catfish for more of a fishy flavor and simmered about ten minutes longer before adding the cooked, chopped shrimp. Simmered it down maybe another ten minutes or so before adding the reserved clam juice and lemon juice. Chopped chives for the top. For an extra nutty, cheesy boost, add nutritional yeast! It thickens the broth a bit more and adds another depth of flavor!
