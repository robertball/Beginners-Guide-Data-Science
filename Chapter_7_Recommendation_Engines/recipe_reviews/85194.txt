My husband and I spent part of our honeymoon in Bavaria.  These are THE dumplings that we ate.  Don't be fooled--I thought that the recipe looked a little weird, but it is perfect.  Follow the instructions exactly, and you've got Oktoberfest in the making!

My mother used to make these and I loved them! This is the first recipe I've found (I never got hers) that tasted right! I followed the instructions exactly, (except I did make eight medium-sized dumplings instead of four huge ones)and they turned out perfectly! I didn't have to add the extra bread crumbs.  Delicious comfort food! Thanks!

Made almost according recipe. I used 8oz regular white bread, and 8oz seasoned stuffing croutons. They were delicious.

Oct 26, 2008: These are great. I sauteed the onions with 3 strips of bacon, diced. Delicious.

Update: Nov 13, 2008.
I recently made this recipe again as a side dish for my parents 50th wedding anniversary party. We had about 70 guests, 90% of whom were German immigrants. We served these dumplings as a side dish with traditional German rouladen. We got rave reviews, and many requests for the recipe. Thank you!

As I mentioned previously, I did add fried bacon to the recipe. I had to multiply the recipe by 8 and made them in 2 batches. I flash froze them on a cookie sheet and then put them in freezer bags until the party. They defrosted wonderfully, and only needed a quick reheating before serving. 

I still have about 2 dozen left in the freezer, and can't wait to serve them again.

This is the recipe poster. Thanks for the positive reviews! This is my first recipe on allrecipes and I'm so happy to know people tried it!! By the way ... not sure how they calculate the number of servings in the summary. Eyeball it and get however many dumplings you get, but usually this recipe makes me around 8.

I made this to accompany the Sauerbraten I was making for Christmas dinner, and they were fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and I was a little afraid that they'd be a bit bland, but the weren't at all and they were wonderful with  the gravy from the Sauerbraten.  The only thing I did change was making a bunch of smaller dumplings instead of the 4 large ones.

These turned out exactly like my mother-in-law's.  I will flavor them a little bit more next time, and also use 2 loafs of bread, as this only made about 7 knoedels.  I will make again for sure, and thanks so much to the submitter as I now have written directions rather than just a verbal recipe from my m-i-l.

I am German, well actually Bavarian :) and I always have these dumplings in my freezer for a quick lunch/dinner after uni. I highly recommend prepearing the dumplings and then freeze them without cooking. If you put the frozen dumplings in the fridge for defrosting and cook them in the evening, they are just perfect and taste like you just made the dough. Enjoy this recipe!

I grew up in Germany and used to eat these things all of the time.  Great recipe.  They are not the same unless you caramelize some unions and add over the top. It adds some sweetness as well as moisture.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Yum! While my entire batch of dumplings didn't turn out, the ones that did were REALLY good! From my experience, I found two things to be key. First, do NOT boil too many dumplings together. I did (in a large, tall stock pot) and some of them fell apart. :( It requires patience, but you really must boil these in batches. Second, when removing your dumplings, be SURE to place them on a FLAT surface (i.e. cooling rack set on top of a cutting board or serving platter) so that they drain properly. I placed my dumplings in two separate bowls. When I removed them from my pot, some water collected in my ladle (there was no getting around this for me - it's to be expected, IMHO). I couldn't avoid pouring some of that water into each bowl and my dumplings became extra soggy as a result. I tried my best to drain the water that had collected and this helped quite a bit. If you allow your dumplings to set for a few minutes, they will firm up and lose most of their "mushy" texture. Once I cut into one of these gems (after having followed my own advice lol!), it was nice and firm and absolutely DELICIOUS. NOTE: Peachy's directions call for making 4 large dumplings. I made double that amount and they were still HUGE! I can't imagine how big these would be if you followed her directions. Covered with gravy, these were great (it makes ALL the difference). Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe on here, Peachy. :-)

These are very similar to the Serviettenknodel my mother and Oma used to make. They didn't use onion, but did add a pinch of nutmeg to the seasoned cubed bread and sprinkled a handful of flour over the bowl and let it sit to dry for a few hours. They added the milk and egg mixture, and either formed orange sized dumplings, or tightly tied the whole thing into a large white linen napkin, or servietten. Then simmered it in salted water for about 1/2 hr. on both sides (turn it over in the water). You could always tell when it was done because it would give a nice hollow sound when thumped with a spoon. We let it rest a bit on a platter, then slice it and serve with pork roast and sauerkraut, and of course the pan drippings from the roast. Delicious!! Thanks for the recipe!

I'm Czech so know a thing or two about dumplings and these ROCK!! The addition of the sauted onions was awesome!! Be sure to let the bread soak for the 15 minutes so it's evenly moist and squishing all together is genius. I plan on doubling the recipe and tray freezing them so I always have them on hand!

Thanks so much for this recipe. This was just one of the many different types of "knoedels" my Austrian Oma made for us. I made these for a chicken "stoup" we had for dinner last night and they were delicious. Didn't even need the bread crumbs. The only dumpling recipe I have of my grandmothers is the Potato Plum Dumpling which I have posted on this site. I remember her making a dumpling with fried pieces of pork fat in the center. To die for (literally), but worth the risk! She called them (Kram-eek) Knoedels. Anyone out there know what I'm referring to? Again, thanks so much Pietzsche!

This is the original bread dumplings recipe.  If you stick with the measurements, you will find it very easy to make these perfect dumplings.  What I would add is that it's very easy to know when the dumplings are ready:  as soon as they rise to the top of the pot, you're good to go.

Really happy with this recipe. I made eight half sized dumplings using a quarter loaf of multigrain wheat bread, two hamburger buns, and the heel of a homemade wheat sourdough loaf, so basically a bunch of scraps, and it still made great dumplings.  Topped 'em with bacon & mushroom gravy.

Made these for my german boyfriend, he just closed his eyes, grinned, and said they are "the real thing".  Not sure the praise comes any better than that!  My only advice would be to add a little milk, 1c didn't seem to be enough in mine, so I added a bit more and the consistency was great.  Keeper recipe!

this is exactly what I was looking for! I have tried to make these from a verbal recipe from my Oma, and they'd always fall apart. I did use a 12 pack of rolls from Smith's bakery, and since it was so dense, I added an extra 1/2 cup milk. after mixing, I let it all set for about 30 minutes, to kind of dry off the top. I brought water to a gentle boil, and did 2 batches of 5 smallish dumplings.  excellent with any gravy, especially mushroom :)  Vielen Dank, Peachy!

I tried this last night and the first batch came out terribly.  Even though the test ball stayed together, the rest of them completely fell apart and I had to throw out the entire batch.  I addded half a cup of bread crumbs to the remaining mixture and tried again using low low heat.  They stayed together for the most part and people ate them but I don't think I'd make them again.

I lived in Bavaria for several years as a child and fell in love with Knödeln, especially Semmelknödel, and have searched for a good recipe for years. This one hit the mark. Even after going through several German and Bavarian cookbooks and several internet searches. Everything I found was so complicated but this one seemed very authentic and it was!! And it was so simple and was done in a snap. We made a mushroom gravy to top it off. The only change I made was adding teaspoon of ground nutmeg. It reminded me of my childhood. Thank you for sharing your Oma's recipe!

I have tried to make these many times, they always fell apart.  These were perfect!!!  Just like my Austrian grandma made.  They taste exactly like hers.  Now i guess I will have to make a pork roast to eat them with, or i could just eat them all before dinner.

Just like my grandma used to make! I have made these several times now. I also like to make the dumplings smaller (I make 8 instead of 4) and cook them on the top of a simmering soup, covering the pot in the last 10 minutes.   You really need to use stale bread for best results.  I have tried many different breads and potato bread does NOT work! Wheat bread is also iffy. Stick with any stale white bread and you will love these!

Made these today, had it with beef roast and gravy.  Followed the directions to the letter.  Turned out SUPERB!  They are not heavy in flavor, but what dumpling is?  Dumplings are enhanced with what they are served with.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I am very sorry to say that this recipe did not work out for me at all. The Knoedel fell apart in the water to make a big bread stew. I had to toss it all away. I don't know if it did not have enough eggs, if I should have pressed them into tighter balls...no idea what went wrong.

Mine fell apart in the water - I actually used beef broth instead of water to cook them in. I missed the step that said add more bread and pulled it out and made it in to stuffing. Still received rave reviews from my German friends.

So delicious! Thank you! Like other reviewers I thought that the they might turn out bland (the recipe list is deceiving) but they were perfect. I didn't have any fresh parsley so I used some dried rosemary instead. Very good and served them as a side to Dijon Tarrogon Cream Chicken on this site. If you are using that recipe be sure to add mushrooms. Thanks again!

These were a great change of pace from mashed potatoes and gravy. Turned out perfect and so yummy. Got me thinking of what other kinds of breads I could use.

My mother is from Munich and she uses the left over dumplings in 2 different ways. One - she cuts them in half, slices them into 1/4" slices and then pan fries them in butter until lightly browned. Serve along side any meat dish. Two - do the same cut as above, add water to a large bowl, add cider vinegar to taste until you get the tartness you like and then add salt to taste. In the bowl, add the sliced dumplings along with 1/2 moon thin sliced onions. Refrigerate for at least 24 hours. Serve cold. The dumplings take on the vinegar taste and these are what I looked forward to when it was dumpling day.

They were a bit flavorless and just kind of mushy-ish bread. We brought them to a German themed party and they were edible, just not that great.

Delicious as stated many times previous to me.  I used Potato Flour instead of regular, and did a few minor changes, but it turned out perfect, thick & creamy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe! For a heartier version, I add about 3 heaping tablespoons of whatever leftover meat I have pre-cooked in the fridge (chicken, bacon, ham, beef, pork...) Just make sure not to add too much or the bread balls can fall apart. YUM!

Not as good as my Grandma's but my first time trying these and I think my dough was just a bit too wet altho they did not fall apart.  My Grandma always used stale brotchens which I highly recommend.  These tasted great and the gravy from my pork roast was perfect drizzled over them.  Gonna keep trying till I can make them as good as my Grandma. I just had to add that these are really incredible the next day!

I'm a little confused about this recipe.  My dumplings are falling apart in my pot as we speak, despite adding bread crumbs.  I'll try this recipe again, but only because it got such great reviews.

Haven't made them yet but will very soon! My paternal grandmother was from Osterhofen and always made these with roast pork and steamed apples! Not sure what I will serve 'em with though as I have been vegetarian for oodles of years now...I am sure O Mommy would not have approved ;)

My husband is slovak and grew up with his grandma making these. I was a bit weary of how this would turn out..But he loved it the kids loved it too. I omitted the onions since my husband doesnt care for onions..flavor was a bit too bland for me but he really liked it. I will be making this again.

This recipe works (and tastes!) far better than I would have thought. I made this with my German-descent boyfriend in mind with very few changes (halved the onion and butter and did not need breadcrumbs). The dough was much more moist than I thought it would be, but the dumplings held shape on the water! Received great reviews at home! I went all out German and served with sauerbraten.

I have been eating this since I was a child in the 1970's. If you have a bakery that makes Brotchens ( a German yeast roll) then I would make them with those. Slice them thin and let them dry out  well before making the dumplings. Also make sure after you soak the bread with the hot milk to let it cool before adding the egg so as not to cook the egg. Remember the bread doesn't have to be soaked only moist the egg will help hold them together. For those of you who had theirs fall apart you got them too soggy

I'm so happy I found this recipe! I had left over garlic bread sticks from Papa Johns and didn't want to throw them out.  I don't understand the people who said it was bland. If you like lots of flavor, add more spices! It's not rocket science Lol.
I used 6 sticks, halved the recipe. For the milk I used 1/4c milk & 1/4c broth from the homemade chicken soup I was making. Made the balls the size of ping pong balls. Simmered 10 minutes. They were awesome dumplings for the soup!

I just made these for my daughter's German IV class.  They taste exactly like the bread dumplings that our German Exchange student made for us; when she was here last April.  I also made a mushroom gravy to serve over them.  They are awesome!

I was so glad to find this recipe.  I've made it from memory of watching my husband's grandma (Omi) make it and never had it written down.  You can make variations as others suggest, but my two cents is that the leftovers are great!  We slice the balls and put a little butter in a skillet and sauté the slices until they're a little toasty on each side.  Thanks for getting this in writing!

Awesome in a goulash as well.  And leftovers are great to cut into little pieces and mix in with scrambled eggs and ham for breakfast.

I followed instructions to a "T" and thought it turned out bland.

These were just ok.  I served it with German Beef Rouladen and German Red Cabbage (going with a German theme).  Used the gravy from the Rouladen on the dumplings.  While my "test" dumpling held together they all started to sort of fall apart at the end.

This is a very tempting recipe to eat!!!!! I couldn't stop and neither could my mom. I'm taking German at school though, and I think the spelling is SEMMELKNÖDEL

This recipe turned out great. I modified it with the items that I had in my fridge/pantry. Which were a loaf of stale gluten-free sourdough, which tastes  better than it sounds. I also only had dried herbs. I used oregano parsley and dill. It came out tasting somewhat like a meatball since the bread was a bit more crumbly than a French loaf would be. So I topped it  with some tomato sauce. I definitely think I need some sort of sauce with it.  But all the same very delicious!

I used the recipe but cooked in plastic wrap and foil in a log shape and sliced. It was soooo good. My bf is vegetarian so we used veggie sausages. Also had with a side of red cabbage cooked with apple and caraway seeds.

If you don`t like the soggy outside and have it  an easy way try baking the dumpling "dough" in a square pan (great alongside a roast)
separate the eggs ,beat egg whites and fol under last, spread in greased cakepan and bake for 30 min at 200°C
serve in slices just like you would serve  the boiled dumpling

These are fun to make and the texture is awesome. Chopping up the rock-hard bread was awful though. They also need more flavoring, they don't taste like much on their own.

I remember having bread dumplings when I was little and I was so pleased to see this recipe. I used rye bread as it was what I had. The dumplings turned out pretty yummy!
