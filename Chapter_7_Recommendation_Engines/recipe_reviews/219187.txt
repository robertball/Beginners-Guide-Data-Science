My friend, Brandy, brought this dip to every Mom's Group gathering we've ever had. She calls it "Crack Dip". Always disappears so quickly. Sometimes, she'll vary it and use cream cheese or sour cream in place of some of the mayonnaise and she doubles the cheese and she's even thrown in some taco seasoning, too. It's so good any way you choose to make it, really. Everyone loves it. This is good hot, too.

I saw this today and thought since I had the ingredients on hand. I'd throw this together. While I thought it was okay and nice flavor. I only questioned whether or not I should have drained the Rotel. Which I didn't leaving it with juice made it very soupy like but had a nice flavor. I took the suggestion of Sarah Jo and added Taco seasoning. So the next time I might 4oz of Cream cheese to thicken it up some.

Was a bit bland in taste and unappealing to the eye.  Ingredients MUST be drained well or you'll end up with a watery-looking dip, making iteven more unattractive.  I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo, and doubled the cheese but it still needs something to boost the flavor... garlic? chopped green onions?

This is pretty tasty! I agree it does need a little something to kick it up. The next time I make it I will use HOT Rotel. That might do the trick. Make sure u drain everything!!!

Add jalepenos! Had this at a party but with 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream, 1 small can green chiles (instead of Ro-tel), 2 cups cheese & diced jalepenos to taste. Fantastic! Use some juice from the chiles/jalepenos to get the consistency you want.
