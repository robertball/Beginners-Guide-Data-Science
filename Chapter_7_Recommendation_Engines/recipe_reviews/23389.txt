My husband and I loved this dish, with a few alterations...
1) I sauteed an onion with 2 cloves of garlic and added this with the broccoli, ham & cheddar cheese.
2) I added some chopped sweet red pepper for extra flavor and color.
3) I added 1/2 tsp. each of onion powder, black pepper and dry mustard.
My husband took one bite and said, "This is a keeper!"

Awesome recipe. This is very versatile. I cut down the milk - 2% - to 1 1/2 cup and this was perfect! The eggs turned out light and fluffy! Instead of broccoli I used one box of spinach, thawed and drained. I added sauteed onion, salt and pepper. Next time I will add some dry mustard and chopped red pepper to spice it up a bit. 50 minutes was too long though, it got a little toasty - be sure to watch yours at 45 minutes. Be aware - this is a big recipe, use a big mixing bowl and if you use pie plates for your quiche you will need 2. I used a 9 x 9 pan and it was perfect, but it did make it look more like a casserole than a quiche. I can't quite decide if I like the baking mix crust or not, it is easy but I guess I just miss the good old fashioned pie crust. I think I will try it next time without. Hmmm, all the possibilities! I can't wait to make this again and again!

Delicious!  I always make this dish for our family holiday pot-lucks.  I put the mixture in little individual muffin pans and it's always a hit and cooks much faster!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and tasty recipe. I wanted to serve this at a brunch but not worry about cutting it up for everyone.  So I made mine in a 24 cup mini muffin pan for bite size quiche.  Recipe made 65 minis.  Used spinach and added fresh garlic, mustard powder, salt and pepper. I also used fresh grated parm. and lessened the amount of cheddar.  Very good! Perfect for an appetizer.

This is a really great "desperation dinner,"  that I almost always have the ingredients on hand for (it helps that I buy tons of different cheeses on sale and stick them, unopened, in the freezer).  You can make it low fat with no real appreciable difference in taste by using skim milk, egg beaters and a mix of low fat and no fat cheese.  A definate keeper.

So quick and easy! Delicious, and with it's own crust too. I've added peppers, onions, used spinach, bacon bits, etc. Can't go wrong with this one.

I made this last night for dinner and it was fantastic!  I didn't change the recipe at all except to add a pinch of salt, and I baked it in an 8x8 dish.  Cooked perfectly in exactly 50 minutes.  Will definitely make this again, and maybe change up the veggies next time!

A huge hit!!!!  This is an AMAZING quiche - so fast, was love over the holidays as a breakfast made from leftovers.  I used leftover ham and added mushrooms, onion, and some chopped basil. I also use 1/2 package chedder, 1/2 package mozzerella.  Have made once with kielbasa and a frozen spinach, and with bacon and mushroom - very moist and tasty!

Delicious! I made half the recipe and made my own baking mix ( 1/3 cup flour, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/8 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp sugar) although I did have some leftover mix from that... I also only used 3/4 cup milk, and used only cheddar bc thats what I had, and sauteed the broccoli in garlic. I Also only had deli ham slices instead of cubed ham.
Half the recipe fit nicely in one 9 in pie dish. It was great and sooo easy thanks for the recipe!!!

We use the basis of this recipe for almost all quiche in our house.  This is a great recipe for using up leftovers, I have used red peppers and leeks, salmon and green beans, three kinds of cheese.  The possibilities are endless.  I often substitute 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 tsp of baking powder for the biscuit mix.

I have made so many different version of quiche's and I honestly think I will never use another recipe, and my boyfriend agrees.  This is so easy to do and can easily be made with whatever you have in your fridge!  I didn't have parmesan cheese so left that out and instead used 10 oz. shredded extra sharp cheddar.  I replaced the frozen spinach with about 1 cup of a sauteed onion/garlic/mushroom mixture.  And lastly, used pancake mix because it was all that was in the cupboard.  It took me 10 very easy minutes to prep and we both had 2nds and are bickering about who will eat the rest for breakfast!  Don't hesitate on trying this!!

Loved it! I made these for a potluck at work and it was all gone! Instead of using a quiche dish, I put the batter in muffin pan. This recipe yielded 24 mini quiches, filling each slot 3/4 full. I didn't add the vegetables, meat or cheese until I was ready to fill the pans. Instead of using broccoli, I sauteed mushrooms and boiled fresh spinach before hand. For one muffin pan, I added mushrooms, spinach, and parmesan cheese. For the other, I used cubed ham, parmesan and cheddar cheese. Baked these for about 20 minutes just like I would regular cupcakes! Took them about when a toothpick came out clean. Even my husband raved about them! I had to stop myself from eating the bite sized goodies before going I got to work!

Loved this recipe.  Added a lot of veggies I precooked like cauliflower, mushrooms, onion.  Also added a can of smoked jalepeno peppers.  Didn't have biscuit, so I used 1/2 c flour.  Everything turned out wonderfully.  This recipe is very accommodating.

What a wonderful and easy recipe! I made this for a shower at work and everyone wanted the recipe. I used pre-cooked bacon pieces instead of brocoli and ham and it was perfect! I also used fresh shredded parmesan which I think works better. I mixed everything up the night before and put it in the oven before work and it was great!

Very good. I always had a problem with quiche not setting right.  Tho this isn't a typical quiche as the crust is baked in, it's really good and looked very appealing.

This is one of my favorite recipes on this site.  I stretch the recipe and bake it in two 8 in pie pans instead of one 10 inch.  Also, you cannot go wrong with variations of the recipe.  Spinach and bacon, onion and mushroom, broccoli, asparagus...you name it and that's not even the best part of this recipe.  The best is how easy it is to make.  Forget about making a crust!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I just made this for a brunch, and it was a huge hit!  Instead of broccoli I used frozen spinach, (thawed and drained) and a cup of sautéed mushrooms.  The best thing about this dish is that I prepared it last night and just stuck it in the oven this morning.  I kept thinking it wouldn’t work, but it did!

I love that this recipe makes its own crust! The recipe is so versatile-I added about a 1/4 c finely chopped onion and red pepper, 8 sliced of cooked chopped bacon, salt and pepper as I did not have any spinach, broccoli or ham on hand. I also added a about  1/2 tsp of cajun spice for a little zip. I only cooked the pie for 40 min. Was perfect!!

The base recipe I give a 4, but with changes to boost the flavor, a 5! I used spinach instead of broccoli, and sauteed it with some onion, garlic, a little chopped red bell pepper, and salt and pepper. I halved the recipe and left out the butter, used mozzarella and cheddar (instead of just cheddar), 1/2 tsp of dry mustard, a few shots of hot sauce, and used 3/4 cup milk instead of 1 cup. I baked in muffin tins (made 12) and cooked for 23 minutes. After setting to cool for 3 mins, I used a thin stiff scraper spatula to get the muffins out. Yum! This is a keeper.

Pretty good.  I added the sauteed onion and garlic, a little pepper, decreased the milk to 1 2/3 cups.  Still needs something, can't quite figure out what though.  My family was not crazy about this dish so I won't be making it again.

I love this recipe!  I volunteer at a restaurant where we raise money for Food for the Needy.  We sell soups and rolls.  Some days I fix this to serve with the soup and people love it.  A cup of soup and a slice of quiche is just enough for lunch and it's cheap.  I make variations with spinach and mushrooms or spinach and sweet peppers.  Its a great versatile, inexpensive recipe.  I love it!

This was soooooo good!  I used 1C bisquick and the egg-beaters equivalent of 5 eggs. Used FatFree Mozz and FatFree Cheddar shredded cheeses and about 2/3 of lowfat parm cheese. i omitted the butter completely and used skim milk... these changes made it healthier but kept the recipe about the same. I didnt use ham, just 1box spinach, 1box broccoli cuts, 1 red bell pepper, 1 cubed zucchini... next time will add carrots, onion and mushrooms. good an healthy and filling! i made it as muffins like others suggested. definitely versatile- love it!!

This was really good - my husband and kids really enjoyed this.  I followed the recipe exactly but the only thing I had to change was the baking dish.  The filling almost overflowed out of my pie plate but it actually fit perfectly in a 9x13 glass dish - baked for 45 minutes.

Tasty quiche impostor.  How cool is it to make up a quiche without needing a pie crust?  
It is very cool.
I made this just as directed and it was yummy.  
I would recommend cooking a little bit longer if you like your eggs 'well done' because this came out on the moist side when baked as instructed.

NO need to add salt.  The parmesan, ham and cheddar all have enough salt and if anything I would look for a way to cut back on the salt/sodium.

You could sub just about anything else for the broccoli, ham, cheddar and parm.  Another reason this recipe is being added to my recipe box.

Made this for Christmas Eve since my vegetarian daughter was going to be here.  I would say this is pretty adaptable, basic recipe.  I did saute and add one onion and three cloves of garlic. I don't own any quiche pans, but one recipe of this made enough to bake in a 9 X 13 pan.  Everyone liked it, including my picky eater son-in-law

Super!  I didn't have Biscuit mix, so I used this recipe (proportionally, because this would be too much for this recipe) 1 cup flour 1-1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon shortening   Combine all ingredients

While I think this recipe has potential, it ended up a little "watery" and not firm enough for my liking.  Next time I might add more cheese to firm it up more and some seasonings.  A good basic recipe though.

I didn't have all the right ingredients or equipment for this quiche, but I tried it anyway. Here's what I learned: it is absolutely imperative that you use a ten inch quiche pan. I tried using an eight inch cake pan and it overflowed everywhere.  Also grated cheddar cheese gets really greasy when you cook it...at least cheap cheddar cheese does.  But it still tasted great! So with my lessons learned I will deffo be making this quiche again.

This recipe was pretty good and could be a 5 with some changes. I made one for hubby, with the bisquick mix, and one for me, no bisquick (south beach diet) He thought his was a little dry, yet mine was not. Next time I will add 2 tsp; garlic and saute with onion, will add mushrooms and olives because I love them and I will cut back on the bisquick. I think that is why my hubbys was kind of dry. My hubby eats quiche at the country club alot and he thought it was real close to theirs, just a little bit dry. Probably will add just under the requirement of bisquick next time like a little more than a 1/2 cup. I felt the cheese amount was fine, would also add a little ground pepper and a dab of dijon mustard

Delicious! I didn't have biscuit mix so I took another reviewer's suggestion of 3/4 c. of flour, 1 tsp. baking powder and a dash of salt instead. I omitted the broccoli and made mine a meat lovers-6 slices of bacon (pre cooked extra crispy so it crumbles easily), 3 slices of ham, and 2 slices of salami.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Very easy....one bowl mix.  I used this an added brocoli, no ham, cheese, sauteed onions and tonight I'm going to try spinach.  I got my boyfriend to try it and he loved it...he has some kind of thing that "real men don't each quiche" however, he loved it.  Very good.

Made this for Father's Day and it was yummy.  I made it my own by sauteing some bell peper, onion, a little garlic and fresh rosemaryafter I cooked the  pancetta.  I used panceta because that's what I had. Cut the milk to 1 1/4 cup as recommended by some other reviewers.  Used 2% grated cheeses and 1% milk to cut the fat al little.  This recipe is so easy and you can change the ingredients to your liking. It could use a little salt and pepper to make it perfect.

Grabbed this recipe when friends from out of town "popped in" overnight and I had nothing in the fridge for breakfast.
I knew I wouldn't have time to slice & dice in the morning, so dashed to store, got the cheese (a mozarella/cheddar mix), a few red peppers strips for color, broccoli florets, some scallions & mushrooms from the frest salad bar section. Just eyeballed the quantities. Had the deli slice a nice wide piece of black forest ham, and they even cut off the dark skin and cubed it to see if the portion was right. Used prepared pie shells. FYI: this was my first ever quiche. FYI: unbelievably easy. FYI: EVERYone loved it, even quiche-hating husband. I think the bisquik makes this one really special. I'll do this again and again, varying the ingredients. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS ONE. Thanks for another Keeper.

This was unbelievably great! All 3 of my sons, 10, 5 & 4 had second helpings. And the 5 year old hates veggies! I used 10oz spinach and bacon in place of ham/broccoli. I also added some onion powder, dry mustard and pepper. We will be eating this often. Soooo easy and so delicious!

This quiche had a great flavor, but like another review said, it turned out very watery.  I'm wondering if that was caused by my using skim milk?  It also could be because I made a double batch--sometimes doubling a recipe necessitates making alterations to the amount of certain ingredients.  My husband added that the only thing that could have made the flavor any better would be mushrooms.  Overall, it was very easy and a big hit with the family.

I was anxious to try this recipe because I liked the biscuit baking mix instead of a crust - my favorite pumpkin pie recipe is with biscuit mix instead of crust.  I'm one to tamper with a recipe but with this one, I only added a couple of dashes of pepper and about 3/4 c shredded swiss.  OUTSTANDING!!  I made it for a luncheon with my friend and we both 2 pieces!  This isn't a recipe if you're on a diet but if you're looking for a dish to bring to a brunch or luncheon, it's perfect.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.

Very easy and quite satisfying. I wanted to try this on behalf of my college-age stepson--trying to work up a set of recipes for him. I prefer to make a pie crust myself, but this is very easy and as others have noted, you usually have everything you need on hand, as the ingredients can be flexible. I made mine with leftover frozen fresh broccoli (thawed first, chopped up) and sliced ham, "Mexican" mix of shredded cheeses, and parmesan, in a square Pyrex (8"), which was just right. Had to bake a little longer than suggested, but everybody's oven is different.

I lightened this recipe by using skim milk, egg beaters, heart smart Bisquik, fat free margarine, 96% fat free ham, and fat free cheddar. I also used 12 oz. steamed broccoli prepared and added imitation bacon bits. It was great, but there was a bit too much liquid (probably because of the substitutes that I made). I had to cook it extra time to get the center to the right consistency, which made the outside a bit too crispy. Next time I will reduce the milk by 1/2 cup. 

Great base recipe that you can personalize with different veggies, cheeses, and seasonings. Thanks, Mishy!

This is a super easy recipe (and this is coming from someone who is no a very good cook) and tastes AMAZING!  My husband who is pretty picky even came back for seconds.  I don't eat meat, so I left out the ham and it still tasted great! Will definitely be making this again!

Pretty easy and really good! Will make this again for sure.  I like the fact that you can throw anything in there that you like, veggies, meats...and it will still turn out great! I made it for my in-laws and they loved!  Thank you!

I made this using turkey sausage links that I cut into bite size pieces, asparagus and swiss cheese.  I omitted the butter figuring the sausage would have enough grease to replace the butter.  It was wonderful!  I mixed it all up the night before and just poured it into a greased 8x8 pan in the morning.  It was very tasty and it will be easy to modify using whatever ingredients you have on hand.

Wow!  How could something so easy taste so good.  What a pleasant surprise.  For those of us who are gluten free - this recipe conforms easily.  I made the recipe as written but with Bisquick GF pancake mix. The flavors meld beautifully and the texture is perfect.  If you like Quiche, try this.  I used to make quiche in an amazing pie crust (my mom's recipe).  I've missed that since going gluten free.  Using this recipe, I don't even miss the old one.

Very tasty, easy to make, minimum clean-up, and doesn't require you to have a crust on-hand. My kind of dish. I used skim milk and skimped on butter and cheese a little to try and cut down on fat, but otherwise, great dish!

Very easy, very good!  As others have noted, the butter was not needed.  I used bacon (instead of ham), sharp cheddar cheese, fat-free milk, egg substitute and low cal biscuit mix (in a half-hearted effort to not add too many extra pounds!).  Even with these changes, this was a great quiche.  I also cooked it in a 9x13 pan for about 40 minutes.  I highly recommend this recipe to anyone looking for an easy quiche recipe.

Made these for an early morning staff meeting and they LOVED them!  Disappeared in minutes.  I made 3 different versions...  mushroom, bacon & cheddar, spinach, artichoke & swiss and roasted red pepper, black kalmata olives & smoked gouda cheese.  Use your imagination...these are a great "go to" that are easy for you to make yet easy to impress those eating them!

One of my favorite recipes on this site! It's so easy and seems unconventional but somehow turns out just right. It's very easy to make and I love the fact that the crust is mixed in. I omitted the ham but made the rest just as the recipe stated. Excellent!

This is the most delicious quiche in the entire world. I followed the recipe but used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, also added tomatoes, sauteed onions, salt, pepper, ground mustard, and crushed red pepper. My husband loves this, and so do I!!!

A very easy and versatile recipe! I did mine with imitation crab & artichoke hearts. Very yummy! Will try it with kale or spinach next time. It's a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

Love this easy recipe! My husband, who thinks he "hates quiche," gobbles this up! It's such a great base because you can add any vegetable mix and it tastes great. I didn't have Bisquick and used a healthy oat/wheat pancake mix and it was still so savory and delicious. I think lots of cheese is the secret.

I thought this was a wonderful and easy receipe!  I changed it up a bit as well, I added some onion powder and only used 1 1/2 cup milk.  I used a deep dish pie glass pan and cooked it in 45 min.

This was yummy. I forgot the melted butter but it didn't matter because it was so good. Not sure the butter would have made much difference. I also added some minced onion, garlic and black pepper. I would definately make this again.

Yum! This was easy. I mixed it up ahead of time and stored it covered in the fridge until time for dinner. My husband doesn't like breakfast food for dinner but admits that this is one of the things I make that is so good, he can't stop eating it! We'll have this one again!

We used fresh torn spinach instead of broccoli and added mushrooms and artichoke hearts, and it turned out wonderfully.  My boyfriend had three helpings! I would give it a 5, though it’s on the salty side and I missed the golden flaky crust that quiche usually has.  The baking mix did give it little pockets of crust, so I think I’ll use more of that next time.   P.S. My baking challenged boyfriend made this almost entirely on his own and remarked at how easy it is.

Even easier and less calories is to spray your pie plate with buttery cooking spray then sprinkle bread crumbs over it.  Mix 6 eggs with s&p and a dash of hot sauce, pour that over your cheese and other ingredients you have put in the pie plate. I pre-cook any vegs and shred any kind of cheese. You can also add ham, cooked sausage or any other cooked , chopped meat you please. Quick, easy and a lot less caloried than using a crust.

Awesome!  I didn't have any ham, so I used chopped chicken instead- very good with the broccoli!  My kids also helped with this one, it's a great one for "kids in the kitchen".  I'll be making it often, varying the ingredients for a different taste.  Maybe bacon, mushroom, and tomato!

WE make this all the time, it is so easy when you don't feel like cooking. Kids like this too. And you can make it up uncooked and put it in a freezer bag and cook it later and still good!

Made this for a potluck the other night.  I used a 9" pie pan, and cooked for about 40 minutes.  It turned out okay, but I'd recommend using a deeper dish if you have it.

However, I had a lot of batter left, so I put it some ramekins.  Voila, mini-quiches! I cooked them for 35 minutes and turned out perfect, moist, & fluffy (a million times better than the pie pan version).  

Great recipe, so quick and easy, I'll be making this again.

This was my first time to make a quiche.  So I cannot rate it in compared to other quiches, but as to itself, I think its great.
Although I did add dried basil, oregano, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and seasoned salt.  I also added grated gouda, and swiss cheese as oposed to the chedder.  
I think I will definitely try this one again.
Thanx!

I just want to say this is the best quiche I have ever made. I made this for breakfast when my father-in-law came to visit and he couldn't stop talking about it. I also was very surprised on how good it was because I am rather picky on how my eggs are cooked. But they weren't hard, they were so fluffy and light. I also used bacon instead of ham, but like another review said it is very versitile. This is a keeper.

We had this for "breakfast for dinner" and it went over well.  Seemed to brown too fast on the edges so next time I will tent it with foil for the first half then remove to brown at the end.  I added a few dashes of salt and pepper and I am sorry I added the salt b/c it was too much with the saltiness of the ham, cheese, and butter.  I might venture away from the ham and broccoli next time to see what other combinations work!

My sister and I made this and we loved it. We didn't put any ham in, and we used spinach instead of broccoli. We also used shredded Parmesan cheese. We used Jiffy brand for the biscuit mix. The recipe filled two pie pans, but luckily it was good enough that we could finish it in a couple days! 
We didn't soften the butter enough, so it hardened again when we put it in with the cold milk, but it still came out great! I will definitely use this recipe again.

This is easy and good, but then again I don't think I've ever had a quiche I didn't like (except for a low-fat version once, yuck).  I just much prefer a pie crust.

My favorite thing about this recipe is its incredible adaptability!  I used sausage instead of ham, spinach and red peppers instead of broccoli, and Swiss cheese instead of cheddar, and it was still really yummy.  I did take the advice of another reviewer and cut the milk to 1.5 cups.  This is a great recipe to pull out to use up vegetables and things from the freezer, and I'll definitely keep it close!

Fantastic recipe! The quiche was a huge hit. I started with a 14 oz pkg of frozen spinach. I used all the spinach, well drained. I replaced the cheddar with half feta, half goat milk cheese and omitted the ham. I was first looking for tasty ways to hide liquid eggs, leftover from a house mate's cooking gig. :-)

I'm sure there are more fancy version of quiche and have tasted a few myself; but, the ease of this recipe makes it a real keeper!  I was out of baking mix, so I made my own using an internet version.  That recipe called for 1/2 stick of butter as did the quiche recipe. I found the only thing wrong to be too much butter in the dish, so if you are out of baking mix and whip some up I would highly recommend omitting the baking mix butter and only use the 1/4 cup of butter the quiche calls for. I promise it will be more than enough.  For the add in's you could definitely substitute a different type of cheese, vegetable and meat.  I also used skim milk because that is what we drink and used 2% cheese and bacon instead of ham since that is what was on hand and it was still great!  You could make a dozen different types of quiche using this recipe.

I just made this today and it was delicious!  I used the biscuit baking mix from this website and I didn't have any broccoli on hand so I substituted with green onions instead.  It came out great and was a great use of leftover Easter ham.  I cut up the leftovers into squares and put into plastic bags to reheat up and eat tomorrow for breakfast.  This was my first quiche, I look forward to making this again with other veggies too.

Easily customizable and easy to make because you just mix all ingredients in one bowl.  I make them in a minimuffin pan.  I accidentally cooked one batch under the broiler for 18 min and they were STILL good!

Definitely a keeper!!
I looked this recipe online at the last minute for dinner, I wanted something quick and easy to make. 

As I didn't have all the ingredients, I substituted broccoli for frozen spinach, ham for turkey, and ran out of cheddar- so only put 5oz instead. It came out perfect though, but next time I'll bake it in less time  since the top came out a lot more brownish as I was hoping for. Other than that, it was delicious!!!

I switched this recipe considerably (with respect to the additions and my husband loved it.   I halved the butter and used it to saute some leeks (instead of broccoli) and then added 8 oz. 'fake' crab in place of the ham and swiss cheese (`2 cups) in place of the cheddar and parmesan.    It became a great crab quiche.

Very easy, very good. I substituted 3 tablespoons light olive oil for butter and skipped the cheddar. I also didn't use broccoli or ham - instead I chopped up some uncured fresh salami and threw in some dehydrated onion. You can pretty much throw anything into this mix and come out with a great tasting quiche. That's what I like about this recipe!

Great recipe. The biscuit baking mix is a great trick for making the texture firmer. I have modified this recipe by changing out cheeses, breakfast sausage and various veggies (mushrooms, spinach, sun dried tomatoes). I also added an extra egg and eliminated the butter. Still turns out great.

I made this quiche for my birthday and everybody loved it. I cut it in small pieces and served as an appetizer. Just one tip: this recipe is quite liquid before being heated and it is not a good idea to use a removable bottom baking pan. I made a mess in the kitchen, but the result was just great.

one of the best recipes I've found on this site. I never use broccoli, just what ever veggies I have on hand, and I always sautee them with a bit of garlic in a pan before mixing it all together. YUUUMMMMMM!!!!! great for breakfast or with a salad for dinner

Great, easy recipe.. I added spinach and mushrooms. I also made it into two separate pies instead of one and it was big enough for my family plus one whole quiche to take to my work! Will definitely make this again!

DH said it was good.  I baked in a 9x13 for less time (per others reviews).  Had some leftover garlic roasted broccoli I used mixed with some cooked frozen.  I would recommend cooking the broccoli.

This is a great basic quiche. You can substitute any of the ingredients and it is always delicious! I usually make this one with green pepper and onion instead of the broccoli. However, last night I put crab claw meat (instead of ham) in it with red pepper, green onions and a four cheese blend and it was to die for! TIP: I find that it is usually done at 45 minutes instead of 50.

Just made this dish for overnight guests.  It was FABULOUS!!  Lots of compliments and the perfect breakfast/brunch item for those who were up early, and those who chose to sleep in a bit (myself included!)  Served it with bagels and fresh fruit - PERFECTION :)    Based on my lack of time to saute I simply added both garlic powder, onion powder sea salt and pepper.  Next time I am going to try the extra ingredients (garlic, onion, red pepper and dry mustard)    LOVE the idea to put them in muffin tins to bake faster!  That was the only drawback w/this dish was the 50 minute bake time.    Still, this dish certainly offers a high end flavor and presentation with little effort!  Laurie

Awesome.  I made this in muffin cups, put in the fridge, and took to work throughout the week for breakfasts.  The nice part is that you can use up the one or two slices of cheese, or three leftover broccoli florets.

I used this recipe for a Bridal Pot-Luck Luncheon at my office.  With the suggestion of other members, I used mini muffin pans & substituted spinach for the broccoi And since they were mini - they cooked in half the time. Thank you for a fabulous recipe - it's a keeper! 5 stars for easy preparation & the clean serving dish I get to take home.

Fabulous! This was the best quiche I've ever made- and I've made a lot. I don't know if it was the baking mix that gave it such a nice fluffy texture, but it was great. I used a ton of fresh spinach, and although I love spinach, you really couldn't taste it, so the kids devoured it. My daughter even asked to take some for lunch the next day. Thanks for this awesome recipe! This is all I will use from now on...

i never put broccoli in my quiche, and i use different meats all the time and i love this recipe. i am giving it four stars b/c the first time i cooked it using the suggested temp it didn't cook right. so i lowered the cooking temperature to 350 degrees and cooked it for 40-50 minutes. much better. my favorite thing about this recipe is that you can interchange meats and veggies and the "base" of the recipe is perfect the way it is. also, it makes a lot. i use a deep dish 9 inch pie plate, and whatever doesn't fit into that goes into my regular sized pie plate and i get two decent sized quiches from this one recipe.

I made this in small foil baking cups (held 1 cup of raw mix each) and it turned out great - and I only had to bake for 30 minutes, not 50. I made it with artichoke hearts, onions, sundried tomatoes and garlic cloves which I sauteed first. 
By the way, I NEVER use biscut mix, but in this recipe I didn't even notice the taste. Great recipe!

This is great!  Easiest, best quiche ever.  Sometimes I change up the extras and it's still good.

Very easy recipe that came out GREAT!  I completely forgot to add the butter and it still tasted perfect.  Definitely an addition to my recipe binder.

I had a leftover pie shell so I decided to pour the mix into that and it was pretty good.  I also substituted turkey-ham for pork ham & added green onions, salt and pepper and it turned out delicious!!  I was really glad I added the green onions & spices because it really gave it nice flavor.  It was very easy to whip together and I quite enjoyed it!  I'm adding this to my recipe book for sure!

Have never made quiche until now! I loved this! It was so easy too - I had my 4 year old son help me! I was planning to follow this recipe exactly, but I ended up having more broccoli (14 oz. bag) and more ham (about 1 1/2 to 2 cups diced), so I added one more egg. It seemed like a lot , so I put it in a 13x9 dish, which ended up being perfect size! It turned out great! I will definitely be making this again and will be playing around with different add-ins. I forgot this time, but next time I will season with a little S/P.

For something to do with leftover ham, this recipe really fills the bill. I followed it exactly. From turning up his nose when told what we were having for breakfast, my 15 year old son asked for seconds and had another piece for lunch! I'll definitely hang on to this recipe. It's almost more like a frittata than a quiche with the biscuit mix right in the recipe but it's excellent whatever you want to call it!

This is so easy and so versitle.  I make this dish all the time, subbing spinach, broccoli, apsaragus or whatever veggie I have in the fridge.  I also sub out the cheeses and meats and no matter what, it always tastes fabulous!  I did cut down on the parmesan cheese.  I use grated and it adds a bit too much salt to the dish for my taste.

This was delicious, my husband went back for seconds.  I left out the ham and added a minced clove of garlic, some sliced mushrooms, and a handful of diced onions in addition to the broccoli.  I also used skim milk, which didn't affect the thickness, and baked it in a lasagna pan.

I made 2 quiches tonight, this one and the caramalized onion & bacon one.  This one was definately easy, and it set up beautifully.  My husband loved it.  I liked the flavor of the other quiche better but it was much more work, and the consistency was kind of watery.  So for my future quiches I'll use this basic recipe and switch the filling ingredients.

Very quick and easy.  I left out the butter completely to cut down on the fat and also left out the ham but only because I didn't have any.  This recipe is very adaptable.  My BF wants me to make this again using olives and bacon.

This turned out great.  I used an unbaked pie crust, and substituted canned asparagus for the broccoli.  I probably added more cheese, but that's my taste.
I will make this again!

I'm not a cook; I follow recipes exactly as written. And when I realized, after pouring the quiche into my large muffin tins, that this didn't call for any extra seasoning (salt, pepper, dry mustard), I was a little concerned, but they turned out PERFECTLY. The broccoli and ham add great flavor. The recipe made 6 large muffin size quiches and 1 small souffle size quiche, which are perfect personal portions. Now to figure out how to store the leftovers for tomorrow morning!

I loved this recipe!! I made a few changes I only used 1 1/2 cup milk because some people suggested it before. I baked it in 2 deep dish pie shells (just because I love crust). I didn't have broccoli so I used fresh spinach chopped up. I sprinkled garlic power, salt and pepper in the mix. I also didn't have any ham so I left it out!! My daughter is a VERY picky eater I was amazed that she ate this 2 days in a row!!! Defiantly a keeper!!

My husband and I loved this dish, with a few alterations...
 1) I sauteed an onion with 2 cloves of garlic and added this with the broccoli, ham & cheddar cheese.
 2) I added some chopped sweet red pepper for extra flavor and color.
 3) I added 1/2 tsp. each of onion powder, black pepper and dry mustard.
 My husband took one bite and said, "This is a keeper!"

This was a delicious and super easy dish! I had some deli ham I needed to use up, and I used a bag of parmesan/mozarella instead of just plain parmesan. I loved the convenience of the one bowl prep - a great way to use up any leftover veggies as well. This could easily be turned into a breakfast/brunch dish as well.

I was unable to find the frozen cartons of pre made quiche mix...so I tried this recipe being very skeptical of how it would turn out as I have never tried making it from scratch.  Both my husband and I agreed it was the best ever.  However, I did add one teaspoon of dried mustard and onion powder.  It really is amazing!!!  I wish there were ten stars I could give this.

My husband is not a broccoli fan, so I used a 10 oz pack of frozen spinach instead.  I had pancake mix instead of biscuit mix.  It turned out really yummy.  It was a little sweet because of the pancake mix, but still good. I definitely want to try it again using the biscuit mix (and broccoli.  Ssh.. maybe he won't notice.)

This was very easy to make!  I omited the broccoli because it had not thawed in time and the square pan I used did not have enough room for it.  My husband was surprised this was the first time I'd made a Quiche.  He was impressed with the fluffy consistency.  I think it helped I used the hand blender.

Four stars because I found it needed more seasoning; made without meat and it really was delish. My teens loved it and I love the easy preparation.

I made this quiche for a potluck brunch last weekend, and it got rave reviews (and was one of the first dishes to be finished).  My deviations from the recipe: used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, cut up chicken sausage instead of ham, and added chopped onion, salt, and pepper.  The other reviewers who mention that this is a lot of batter are right -- only about 2/3 of it was enough to fill my standard pie plate.  Overall a very impressive-looking and delicious quiche!

I love this recipe! It turns out perfect!! I've replaced the broccoli with anaheim green chiles or poblano peppers & added cheddar cheese in place of the other 2 & it is wonderful!!

WOW!! This quiche is very good!! I followed recipe exactly the way it mentioned and this dish came out great. What I did differently was change the temperature. Instead of 375 degrees, I cooked mine at 350 degrees. I was in high school when I tried quiche for the first time in my "cooking class" and just now decided to try it on my own. I have to say this is the best quiche I tried from this recipe, and I think the broccoli goes well with this quiche dish!!!

Great basic recipe that you can use with so many different combinations of meat/veggies.  Had on hand some chicken/red pepper/spinach sausage, mushrooms, and some cheddar jack cheese and it was delicious.  Comes out light and fluffy and I actually like it better with no pie crust.   Couldn't have been easier to make.

Wonderful dinner. My family loved this recipe, the only glitch in the recipe is that mine cooked in 40 minutes so watch yours carefully so you don't over-cook it. Also, I left out the butter entirely and it was still wonderful and plenty creamy even with skim milk.

Very good. I was surprised the baking mix kind of blended in. I didn't have broccoli so I put chopped green olives in. I also added some green onions and spices. I have been searching for a morning casserole dish but they are all very plain. I will keep making this one.

This is perfect for week nights.  Totally customize it for your families preferences. I added just a bit of ham and had broccoli on the side. And the parm cheese adds a great extra kick we love.

Made these gluten free with Bob's Red Mill g-free pancake/biscuit mix, and they turned out amazingly. I would add less butter as they seemed a bit greasy. I also put them in muffin tins to make them easily transportable to a morning tailgate - what a hit!

For a change I decided to have my family over for a brunch versus the usual grilling out for Father's Day.  I made two of these quiches, one with broccoli, the other with spinach.  People were ranting and raving about the quiche, and even a week later I was getting compliments.  I said I'd make it a yearly event!  So easy and almost full proof.  I didn't change a thing.  This is definitely going to become one of the classic recipes I use.

I made this when we were low on groceries, I was shocked I had all the ingredients. I really like that it didn't require a dozen eggs, just 4. The taste was exceptional, I really like that the bisquick made it less eggy. This is my new go-to quiche recipe.

I changed this just a bit.  Did not have ham, had Oscar Meyer Bacon Pieces, used them instead.  Added Salt/Pepper/Garlic Powder.  Also cut up some green onions (2) and through those in to the mix.  Pre-cooked the frozen broccoli for 3 minutes in microwave.  I also baked this in a 9 x 13 glass pan.  Made it more like a casserole.  This is by far the best I have ever made!  Will make it again, and try spinach the next time.

I recently made this for the first time for a party of 8. Everyone raved about the quiche. It was very easy and quick. I substituted thawed spinach for the broccoli, as it would be less lumpy. I also used veggie sausage patties (Morningstar "Maple flavored" sausage patties"). Even the non-vegetarians LOVED it. This is a keeper!

This is my all time favorite quiche recipe.  My family just devour it and it is simple to make.  Sometimes I use spinach and mushrooms instead of broccoli.  It's very easy to modify and always comes out great.

This was incredibly delicious.  After a few bites, my kids declared a "makeover!"  Which means they want me to make it again.  It didn't say which type of enchilada sauce to use - red or green.  I used green.  I did not make my own tortilla strips, but used tortilla chips, sour cream, cheese and avocado as garnishes.  I'll make it again as soon as next week!

Made this EXACTLY as written, very good, and very easy to make!  Made one large quiche as written, it only took 42 minutes vs. the 50 minutes listed in the recipe, probably depends on the quiche dish that you are using.  Will make again.

This is very similar to the "Impossibly Easy [fill in the blank] Pie" series of recipes by Betty Crocker, which call for Bisquick.  I make them fairly often and they are seriously impossibly easy.  Lots and lots of alternate variations (beef, chicken, turkey, vegetarian, etc.)

Easy, Perfect and Delicious!  I did, however, substitute the ham and broccoli for cooked chicken and mushrooms sauteed in Pam and a small pat of butter with garlic, salt and pepper.

I RATED THIS 5 BECAUSE OF IT'S EASY AND VERSATILITY.  USED HAM INSTEAD OF BACON AND CHEDDAR CHEESE INSTEAD OF SWISS.  ADDED SWEET RED PEPPER AND SOME BROCOLLI. TOOK LONGER TO COOK, AND IT FREEZES AND COOKS UP WONDERFULLY!  IT'S A KEEPER!

There is waaaay too much cheese in this.  If I make this again I will cut back at least by half on both the parm and cheddar and maybe add an extra egg.

I love,love this recipe.  I wanted a quiche recipe that was easy and tasted great and this is it. I have made it just as the recipe states and it is great.  When I don't have all the right cheeses I use what I have.  I have added real bacon bits and sauteed onions,mushroom and bell peppers.  I sometime use spinach.  My oldest son believes real men don't eat quiche.  He loves it.  I just don't tell him what it is.  He takes the left overs for lunch the next day.  What real men don't know won't hurt them.  lol  Thank you for a winning recipe.

This was great! I made it last night and it was gone this morning. I used a package of Sara Lee honey ham slices, and a palm full of bagged salad topping real bacon pieces. I wanted to use spinach but my husband and son will rarely go for anything green! Next time I will make one manly meat quiche for the men and a broccoli spinach and ham for myself. thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made two versions of this recipe for an office breakfast (one with bacon and spinach and the other with asparagus and ham) and they were both delicious! It's light and fluffy. Makes for a great presentation. I baked them in two 9X9 square pans and leftovers in muffin tin that made four mini quiches. I'd definitely make this again. Thank you!

All these ingredients sounded really good, but we weren't impressed with the results. I would rather take the extra time and make a real quiche.

I used spinach and 1 1/2 cups cheese, added an egg and used a bit less milk.  Pretty good considering how easy it is.  Fits perfectly in a 9x11 in. pan.

I made this recipe and used 1 1/2 cups 2% milk, no fat cream cheese, no fat shredded cheddar cheese, "I can't believe it's not butter" light, and 1/2 cup parmesean cheese (instead of 1 cup)along with the remaining ingredients. I baked it in a 9" x 9" glass pan.  It turned out very good and I reduced a lot of the fat in the recipe.

made this last night as a try out for a xmas potluck. Very good. nice flavor makes a large batch. I think it would have overflowed in the oven in a 10 inch pie pan. I used a lg casserole dish. Also used fresh broccli (steamed 1st). Will make again. YUM!

Fabulous!  I needed a quick and easy dinner dish last night but didn't have ham or broccoli so I substituted spicy sausage and frozen spinach.  My husband was still raving about it this morning and was thrilled that there was enought left for his breakfast.

Quick, easy, delicious!  No alterations necessary.  Whenever we have ham, I dice a couple cups and freeze for another meal.  I used that frozen ham for this recipe.  It worked out great.

Lives up to its name: Easy.  I even didn't have biscuit mix on hand, so I just put 3/4 cup of flour in the bowl first and cut in almost 3 T shortening and 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Then continued with the recipe as written.  It worked out well.

Threw this together for a last minute brunch.  SO GOOD!  Had all of the ingredients on hand, substituted bacon for the ham, and did add sauteed onions and mushrooms since they were also in the fridge. Didn't have beaters, so just mixed with a wisk, and still turned out GREAT. Made it in a 13x9" dish and it was delicious!  Will definitely make again and again! A+++

I'm not a huge fan of quiche buy my husband loves it. What I loved about the recipe is that because it has no official "crust", all the ingredients were in my pantry or fridge. It had a fluffy texture and I didn't miss the crust AT ALL! I cut back on the parmesan though to make sure it wasn't too salty. It was so fast to make! Will definitely use it for a brunch.

This was awesome!!  I did make some changes that did nothing but add to the flavor and texture. I used a pkg. of thawed, drained, chopped,spinach instead of broccoli, put in saute'ed onions and mushrooms plus added bacon.  I think I added an extra egg as well and upped the bisquick a 1/4 cup.  It got rave reviews at our church's Easter breakfast and it was my personal favorite as well. I think you can do anything you want with this and it wouldn't fail. I baked in a 9x13 and it took about 40 min.

We say: this recipe turned out great, but definitely use LESS Parmesan cheese and less milk. we bought a ham steak and cubed it ourselves for that "holiday ham" taste.

My husband said this was the best quiche I ever made. It was super easy, and it only took 40 minutes in the oven. 
I omitted the butter and cut the cheeses in half to make it lighter, omitted the ham (didn't have any), and used spinach instead of broccoli. So even as a "healthy" vegetarian quiche it is still quite tasty.
I also added a little bit of crushed red pepper flakes, tumeric, and extra black pepper. 
The crust was almost indiscernible but it was still great.

Although this recipe is NOTHING like quiche, it does have one HUGE advantage: you can easily modify it to take advantage of those refrigerator odds and ends!  The first time I made this, it was just ok.  Like other reviewers, I found it to be a little bland, in that "growing up in the Midwest" sort of way.  The second time, I added pepper, onion salt, garlic powder, a couple of shakes of hot sauce and a healthy dollop of dijon mustard - huge improvement.  Very forgiving recipe, though; one time I realized I did not have sufficient milk, so I just topped off the milk with sour cream...came out perfectly.  Scraps of cheese, leftover roast, a hot dog...it all works great in this recipe.  When it's time to clean out the fridge, you'll love how easy this comes together!

My husband LOVED this. We were a bit apprehensive because there was no crust but it turned out great. He tore it up the first night and the leftovers were just as good (accd to him haha). 

The only things I changed was a bit more broccoli and a bit less ham. VERY EASY RECIPE!!!

This was very good!  It was easy to make!  I made this on Christmas morning, added fresh baked ham from the night before, bacon, red and green pepper, and onion (I omitted the broccoli).  This is our new Christmas morning "special" breakfast!!

This recipe was certainly very quick and easy to make.  I only have a few criticism/changes to make.  First, the amount of broccoli recommended in the recipe seems to be a bit much.  I ended up with an overwhelming broccoli flavor to mine, so if you're not a huge fan, you might want to scale back a bit on that.  Also, I added a bit of sauteed onion and bacon to mine, as well as salt and pepper.  The key thing with this quiche is to bake it in the proper pan.  It did well going into two pie pans for me.  Anything deeper and it would have been soggy.  Otherwise, the easiness of this recipe is definitely reason to try it out!!

Surprisingly good.  Honestly, I only made this because I had the ingredients sitting around and needed to use them up before they spoiled, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I sauteed fresh broccoli with onions and garlic instead of using frozen, but other than that I followed the recipe.  I don't know if this was intentional but the biscuit mix sort of raised to the top making a delicious crust over a light eggy filling.  Loved the texture.

This was really good. I added in some chopped onions and traded the broccoli for spinach. I also used 2 eggs and then egg whites in place of the other 2 eggs. My 4-year-old had 3 helpings, and that is very unlike her!

This was both easy and yummy!!  I made it exactly as the recipe was written, these are ingredients I always have on hand.  Just for fun, I can't wait to try a variety of meats and veggies to put a little different spin on it.  However it is GREAT as is!!!

I made this last night for the first time.   I substituted one cup of Southwestern Eggbeaters for the four eggs, and cut back a little on the butter.   I did cook it a little longer than the receipe calls for, I added diced bell peppers (three colors) in addition to the broccoli and that probably increased the baking time.  The Quiche turned out great.   I definitely will make it again.  Very versatile easy recipe.   Thanks.

I've made this recipe many times and my family loves it. The only changes I've made are that I add 1/2 tsp. black pepper and I only bake it for 30 to 35 minutes. Thank you for the recipe!

This is great.  I used a little fried bacon and some veggies that I had roasted the night before.  The combo I used was cauliflower, red pepper, zucchini, eggplant & onion.  The hubby LOVED it!!
I used a bit less cheese more like 5 oz, what was left in the 8 oz pouch.  Be merry use what ever you like in this one!

Very easy and very good.  Somehow the baking mix separates itself out and forms a bit of a crust on the top and bottom!  I didn't have cheddar or ham so I used muenster for the cheddar and about 1/4 of crumbled bacon instead of the ham.  Really good.  Will definitely make it again.

Excellent! Super easy to put together and versatile!  We will definitely be making this one again!  I poured the mixture into premade pie shells so if you plan to use a real crust- make sure you buy two.

this egg dish is yummy! i made a half recipe however used extra ham, cheese & broccoli which fit well into a 9" pie plate. the "quiche" browned beautifully & mine was done in 40 minutes. i like how the bisquick makes it's own crust. next time i'll experiment with bacon, swiss cheese & spinach. thank you michele!

This is terrific! First time making quiche and I was not dissappointed.  In fact, I made it for Christmas morning brunch and was hoping it would turn out. I am so glad it did.  Next time I will try sausage and spinach. It seems very versatile.  And it baked up beautifully. It will definitley be added to my repertoire!  Oh, I used 1/2 cup less of milk, and added an egg.

Tastes excellent.  I added a 1/2 cup less milk and it turned out great.  I added broccoli (next time i'll use fresh steamed broccoli instead of frozen, tastes better) bacon and fresh mushrooms sauteed in the bacon grease.  It was delicious.  I will definetely make again.

Just made this a whim as I had ingredients on hand.  Im so happy I did.  Very easy and delicious.  I made my own baking mix, using whole wheat flour and baking powder.  I also subbed butter for olive oil.  I used red bell pepper, onions, and brocolli.  I will definitely make this again!!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Made this using fresh spinach instead of the broccoli (that is what I had on hand) and it worked out fine.  This was easier than the traditional quiche I make.  I would make this again, when I have some ham that I need to use up.

This recipe was super easy and delicious!!  I sauteed EVOO with minced garlic, peppers, onions, & spinach.  Would love to have added mushrooms.   Then added this to the egg and milk mixture.  I baked in muffin tins for 25 - 30 min.  Perfect.
Thank you for sharing!!

Deeeeelish....mmmm...I made this for my daughter this morning. I used turkey  sausage and spinach and everything else was the same.  I cooked it in a pie crust. It just looked so beautiful coming out of the oven. This melted in my mouth. Was buttery and savory. We just loved it. I can't wait to try it with bacon. Thank you for the recipe.

Very good. Used skim milk and two whole eggs with three egg whites...low fat mozarella and low fat cheddar (half cup of each). Makes it low cholesterol,  low fat. And 97 % fat free ham and I can't believe it's butter. Added fresh dill about 2-3 tbsp. Unbelivable! Will be making it again for sure and also changing veggies too maybe turkey next time. Yummy.

This is a great, quick recipe. It might not be "real" quiche but "real" quiche is more complicated to make and this is delicious for what it is. I've made this a few times and found that adding onions added another dimension, and it could probably be tweaked with other ingredients too.

I made 2 of these, one with ham and broccoli, one w/spinach and no ham. I was short of butter so used just 2 T, melted, in each. It was fine and I would use that reduced amount next time. I used 2% milk and a bit of 18% cream that I had in the fridge.  Really nice quick meal with easy-to-vary ingredients. I wouldn't call this a quiche but it is a good dish in its own right.

I was looking for something new and easy, and I found just that! I used 1-1/2 cups of 2%milk, 1 tsp of dry mustard, a tablespoon of garlic powder, and spinach instead of broccoli. I used gluten free Bisquick mix instead and was VERY pleased with the results. Cooking time was just at 50 minutes and the texture and moisture was perfect. We will be using this recipe again, most definitely!

This is one of the best quiches I've had, and I've tried many different ones. It's also the first quiche I've ever made. It's very easy to do and tastes wonderful. My husband doesn't like eggs (or anything that tastes like egg), but he loved this so much that he wants me to make it for him in single-size versions so he can eat them before work! Not having to make a crust is a huge bonus.

I made a couple substitutions to fit our preferences and what I had on hand: substituted mozzarella cheese for the parmesan; cooked and crumbled 8 pieces of turkey bacon in place of the ham; and 3/4 cup flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp sugar, and a pinch of salt instead of biscuit mix. 

There is a slight crust once it's cooked, that's like a soft biscuit on the bottom and sides.

Love this quiche! I make it for every family brunch and my co-workers ask me to make this for every school breakfast! Love that everything goes in one bowl and right into the pie plate to bake! I did cut the butter to just two tbls, and the the parm cheese to 1/2 cup. I also use skim milk as well. Didn't seem to change the taste, so why not cut some of the calories!!

I followed the recipe but after 40 min the top was too dark and after 50 min it was still runny in the middle. No idea where I went wrong. I've heard quiche is really hard to make but the recipe looked easy enough. Still came out horrible for me :( guess we are having pizza tonight.

I really enjoyed this. As per other suggestions, added only 1.5 cups milk (skim); and sauteed onion and garlic. Also, it only needed about 30-35 minutes to cook, but my oven cooks a bit hot.

This was easy and delicious. This is what I did differently: I used fresh broccoli that I blanched before adding to the mixture. I used chopped sautéed cremini mushrooms instead of ham because I am vegetarian. I added salt, pepper, dehydrated onions and a pinch of nutmeg, as well as half a teaspoon of mustard powder to the egg mixture. I baked  longer, and it could have been longer still, but I think that's my oven's fault. This was a great inspiration. Thanks!

very elegant looking!
I took the suggestions of some of the reviewers, I added sautéed onions, bell peppers, mozzarella, some cayenne and black pepper and crumbled turkey bacon.
I took a risk by preparing the recipe for a wedding brunch. I used mini tart shells-the ones made from cardboard,
I was nervous to serve em but I put them out and they disappeared and not into the garbage. my friend's picky eater said they were pretty good and she wanted a whole one for herself- 7 yrs. old rule! I actually did not get to taste one cuz they were all gone! but I did get several responses that they were good, and that people liked the little kick from the pepper. Maybe next time I will get to taste one for myself.

This was really terrific!!!  I used skim milk and spinach. I work 10 hr days and need to feed a family when I get home.  This was PERFECT! Served it with soup and breadsticks.  The 1/8 serving was more filling than any other 1/6 serving of a typical quiche.  Something about the dough being mixed in seemed to make it more filling and satisfying.  Really liked this and will try to mix it up with some of the suggestions.

Oh my! Good for any meal of the day! The biscuit mix added a taste and texture different than other quiche recipes I have tried. My son didn't like the broccoli, but the other 5 loved it! And in my house 5 outta 6 ain't bad.

This was incredibly good. I substituted Black Forest Ham lunchmeat for the cubed ham, because that's what I had on hand. Per others' reviews, I sauteed a little bit of onion and garlic, and cut the milk to 1-1/2 cups. It came out perfect! So yummy! Will definitely make this again.

Absolutely love this recipe! The only changes I make are what goodies I put in it---whatever I happen to have in the fridge, and of course, garlic and seasonings to taste. I serve it most often for dinner.

I've made this so many times, I had to write a review.  It's so easy, good, and versatile.  I do use 1/2 cup less milk and add a 5th egg to make it eggier.  I've used various cheeses and vegetables and it always turns out great.  My favorite variation was onion, mushroom, and spinach which I sautéed before folding in the mix (excluded the ham) with a share white cheddar cheese.  Hats off to the creator of this recipe. It has been a star dish at many brunches special breakfast occasions in my apt!

This was delicious! I only used 1 1/2 cups milk, 4 strips of cooked bacon crumbled (instead of ham), a handful of frozen spinach thawed and drained(instead of broccoli), 1/4 of a red onion finely chopped, a small amount of fresh chopped mushrooms and a sprinkle of each: feta, mustard powder, parmesan, garlic powder, salt and pepper. I will definitely make this again. Best quiche yet!

I cut the recipe in half and I used turkey instead of ham and Monterrey jack instead of Parmesan.  I sprinkled some pepper on top and it worked out great. Next time though I may set the oven to 350 and just let it cook longer than at 375.

This was easy, very versatile and fantastic.  I took someone's advice, doubled the recipe and made these in a muffin tin for 21 minutes.  Though I doubled the recipe, I didn't put in as much milk or butter.  I also added some diced peppers, and several dashes of salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  I only used shredded cheddar cheese, and about 1.5 cups of it.  I also reduced the amount of diced ham (packaged) and the broccoli.  The extra batch is now freezing for later use!

Absolutely wonderful!. 
I use pepper Jack cheese instead with spinach and don't use fresh Parmesan either. 
I noticed that in making this four times now that it does require a little more than 3/4 up biscuit. I just add until it looks right. 
My kids just love this recipe' and so do I. 
I place it in two pie crusts and we will have one for morning breakfast.
Truly a quick, wonderful meal for before school too!
Thank you Mishy for the great easy Quiche recipe.

Wonderful and easy!  I agree with other posts that the saltiness was a little too harsh with ham and Parmesan.  Great though! I would use less Parmesan next time.   Will make this again using just veggies and crab meat. Some fun veggies and I know my son will love it!  What a wonderful idea to use biscuit mix!  Thanks!!! Keep posting!

Excellent!  This is a great recipe for when you need a quick easy dish to bring and wow people.  I do add a bit of salt and pepper, but other than that the recipe is perfect!   Works well with any veggie or meat... I made one with broccoli and bacon.   Probably going to use spinach next time.

Excellent recipe!  The only chane that I made was to use one small bunch of fresh broccoli instead of frozen.

Everyone loved this recipe! I did cute the mile down a little as others suggested, added a little salt, half an onion finely chopped  and instead of broccoli i made it ham and mushroom. Was my first quiche and was told I have to make it again :-)

I've made this several times, and it never disappoints. I usually substitute finely-chopped fresh broccoli for the frozen, but otherwise make as described.   Savory and delicious, and reheats beautifully!

Delicious!! I made it with spinach instead of broccoli because I enjoy spinach, more.  It was great!  I especially like the flavor and texture of the biscuit mix.  I used the cheap Jiffy biscuit mix and it turned out yummy!  This is a keeper recipe.

First, I'll say that I think this is a great recipe which can be easily customized to your individual preferences. It tastes great but the consistency or the texture was nothing like traditional quiche, or at least it wasn't in my case. However, I really liked it and intend to use it again. It was not perfect but good, especially if you're cooking for someone who isn't crazy about eggs because the flour offsets the eggy-ness.

DISASTER - I used a loose bottomed quiche pan.  Major leakage.  A complete mess.  I guess it's the pastry that holds the filling in a regular quiche.  Luckily, I had put the pan on a cookie sheet.  Sheet is ruined. House stinks.  Where's that take-out menu?

This was great! I had fresh not frozen broccoli, so I steamed it a little before I added it. I also didn't have a whole cup of parm., so I just added a little more cheddar. I also added a little garlic powder, black pepper, paprika, and mustard powder. It was amazing. This is a keeper!

easy and delicious.  I did as some others suggested and sauteed a small onion and a lg clove of garlic in the butter to mix in.  Added 1/2 tsp. or sl more dried mustard, pepper and a pkg of thawed, drained spinach (squeezed)  Baked in a 9 x9 pan for about 47 min., at 370 and turned it down to 350 for last 10 minutes.  It was perfect!

Excellent!  I made it the first time in a 8x10 rectagular pan.  The second time I used mini muffin cups for more of an appetizer.  I added a 1/4 cup extra Bisquick mix to each recipe.  Came out great both times.  This is a great recipe for customizing ingredients to your taste.  And so much easier than making and filling a crust.  Delicious and a keeper!

Nice recipe!  I needed something quick to make for work tomorrow.  This looked hassle-free, with ingredients I already had at home.  I used onion, spinach,  mushroom, 1% milk and halved the amount of cheese.  Came out of the oven beautifully and smelled so good the kids (self-claimed taste testers) devoured the leftovers I baked in a separate dish.  What a simple, nutritious, and economical snack to have around for anytime of the day.  I imagine this versatile recipe will be put to good use in our household. Thank you for sharing, I joined allrecipes and this is my first saved recipe.  Expecting rave reviews tomorrow!

Fantastic and easy recipe.  Didn't change one ingredient.  There are just the two of us, so we had leftovers which were just as good if not better.

LOVE IT!!!  I prefer crustless quiche and used fresh baby spinach, added mushrooms, zuccini, onion and red peppers.  It was enough to fill 2 9 in pie plates.  I also didn't add the ham.  Sooooooo goooooooood!

this was quite tasty but not actually very Quiche-like. .. the biscuit part made it very dense. I will make it again and maybe try some other variation on this base. Tasted delicious just wasn't quite like I'd hoped.

Love this recipe! I am so happy I came across this. It is a definite keeper. I added chopped onions, garlic, and red pepper as one reviewer suggested, and it was excellent. My guest loved it as well, and asked for the recipe. And, this is the first time I ever made quiche!

I wanted a portable snack, so I made quiche muffins instead of a big pie. This worked very well as written.  I didn't have any baking mix, so I made some, using the recipe for "Biscuit Baking Mix."  I changed that recipe to make only one serving, which worked out to be exactly 3/4 cup.  Instead of the white flour and shortening, I used whole wheat flour to make these healthier. I used broccoli and turkey ham. I was trying to use up some leftover turkey ham, so I ended up with almost 2 cups of ham.  I added 2 eggs and a splash of milk to the bowl.  I used a standard muffin tin, and this made exaclty 24 quiche muffins.  I only gave this four stars because I'm the only one in my family who liked it... I'm going to have to keep working on the kids, since I was hoping this would be a good snack to take in the car.  Maybe I will try different ingredients next time.

Made this just now for football playoff Sunday - my husband loved it, even though "real men don't eat quiche!" I used 2% milk, several different bits of leftover cheese, low fat Bisquick, spinach, onion and bacon bits from Costco. Good basic recipe to use when you open the refer to play "what's this?"

This was really good and super-easy. I like how you don't have to make a crust for this, and instead just throw in the bisquick. I used spinach instead of broccoli, and about half the cheddar cheese. 8 oz was the whole pkg, so I thought in addition to the 1cup of parmesan it was a bit too much cheese. super good!

Amazing!! Best Quiche I have ever made or eaten with a few alterations! I sauted 2 cloves garlic, 1 medium diced red pepper, and 1 medium diced red onion...I added that to the batter mixture. I used a half a package of frozen Spinach (instead of broccoli), and then I added 1/2 tsp Dry Ground Mustard, 1/2 tsp Onion Powder and 1/2 tsp of Blk Pepper (as others suggested).  So many people asked me for the recipe! It was a huge hit!

Made this morning to rave reviews. Really couldn't be easier. Looking forward to making this my go-to "quiche" recipe. Only change I made was to use fresh broccoli instead of frozen -- and I think I was a little shy of using the whole 8 oz block of shredded sharp cheddar because I didn't want my 9" pie plate to overflow. Definitely let it sit for at least 10-15 minutes before serving. It sets up much more nicely that way. Can't wait to start mixing and matching ingredients to suit various tastes in the family (vegetarian, for example.)

My go-to recipe for almost any occasion.  You can change it up a million ways - spinach and sausage is another of my favorites.  I've even made it with spinach and "fake" sausage for my vegetarian sister.  In this recipe even "fake" meat is good!  The recipe is great as written though!

I was so impressed by this quiche, i barely have words! I doubled the batch to have around the house for a weekend when a lot of people were staying with us because I had a lot of eggs. The first bite I too, I never wanted to put it down.  I made it with frozen spinach because that's what I had a round and OH my gosh its good. I will be making this easy dish again and again!

I made a lot of changes to the recipe after reading the other reviews, so maybe it would be better as originally written.  I substituted spinach for the broccoli, omitted the ham and baked in muffin tins.  They browned too much on top and didn't set up in the middle.  Despite greasing the tin, they stuck. Had to trash them.

This quiche was so easy and delicious for dinner and then as leftovers.  I threw in whatever was in the fridge (in this case spinach, bermuda onion and orange pepper), can't wait to make it with some other interesting ingredients.  I only had a 9" pie plate, and all went well although it was touch and go in terms of overflow for a few minutes!

This was my first time making quiche and it turned out delicious!  I made a few small changes because I wanted use ingredients I had handy...I omitted the meat, and used fresh broccoli, mushrooms, and green onion for the veggies (I steamed the broccoli and then sauteed all three in a very lightly oiled pan).  Also used mozzarella cheese instead  of cheddar.  I will absolutely make this again!! Yum!

I've never made quiche before, and I really liked how easy and tasty this was. I switched up the ingredients a little bit--- I used frozen spinach, turkey, cheddar and parmesan, and made them into mini-quiches. They're very light and airy, and have a lot of flavor. I'm serving them at brunch tomorrow, so we'll see how others like them.

This is the easiest quiche recipe around ... I've made it for just myself and my husband and I've made it for a crowd. Always gets rave reviews. I'm going to go make it with some ham leftovers from Easter! :) If I add veggies, I do saute them a little before throwing them into the mixture but that is the only adjustment I make. The hardest part of this recipe is waiting for it to be done :) Enjoy!

I LOVE this recipe, its so simple to make and you can add anything you want.  Usually I add a package of frozen spincach (thawed and drained), also mushrooms, diced ham and cheddar cheese.  I also did not have bisquick, so I just use Krusteaz pancake mix and it still turns out great!  Its also really good the next day, my husband loves this and its usually gone in one night.  Love love this recipe!

This is one of my go-to recipes for my family, and as a meal to serve or give others.  I always split it into 2 pie dishes (decreases baking time to 35 minutes), and often substitute the ham and broccoli for other meats and veggies (whatever is on hand).  A fan favorite was chopped bacon and sauteed onions! Another plus is that the mix freezes well in a Ziploc to save for later; just thaw and prepare as directed.  It's great for leftovers, too -- no soggy crust like traditional pies/quiches.  YUM!

Used 1 1/2 cups of sausage instead and left out the veggies but only because I didnt have any ham. This is going to be wonderful with left over ham. Can't wait to make it again the way it was written

This quiche turned out beautifully, but the real success came when both my husband and daugher ate it happily.  There's only 3 of us, so we had some leftovers, but it reheated very well.  The only things I changed, I used Spinach instead of broccoli.  Next time, I will be sure to use unsalted butter, it was a tad salty.

Good basic recipe.  I took the advice of others and added some extra spices.  I had a limited amount of extra veggies I wanted to get rid of, so I sauteed dice tomatoes and green bell peppers and added it in with the broccoli at the end.  I used the Biscuit Baking Mix recipe from this site.  I decreased the milk quantity a little, and it made 2 quiches.  I had this as a vegetarian dish and it was good. I wouldn't say this dish is amazing, but for its simplicity and decent taste, it's a 4.5.

Im giving this 5 stars for the following reasons: 
-Couldn't have been easier to put together. 
-You can change this around to suite your taste (delete the ham, add mushrooms, etc.)
-I baked it the night before, re-heated and it was just as good at room temperature the next day. 
This isn't fancy, its just super good and easy which is all you need sometimes. :)

We really liked this.  I cut the parmesan and cheddar cheese in half to make it a little healthier and sauteed the ham with and onion and some minced garlic.  I also added some garlic salt and pepper.  I don't have a quiche pan so I cooked it in two 9" pie pans and reduced the cooking time to 40 min.  We will be making this often.

This makes a beautiful presentation. For years I have made quiche the old way..rolling out the pie crust. But this! Ooh la la!!! Beautiful and delicious. What a wonderful recipe. I use bacon instead of ham, spinach instead of broccoli. Sometimes I add onions, sometimes not. That's the beauty of this perfect recipe--you can add or substitute. I make 2 and freeze one or give it as a beautiful, tasty gift. Thanks for this perfect recipe! If there were 10 stars, I'd give those.

I served this as part of our New Years breakfast buffet, it was a huge hit!  I used just a little more biscuit mix then called for and cut down on the cheeses just a little.  It was perfect, and will make it again!  My only suggestion is to either line the pan with parchment paper or grease the bottom, as it tends to stick.

LOVED this Quiche - easiest and best tasting one I have ever made.  The way it creates its own crust is fabulous!  I will probably be making this Quiche or a variation of it at every brunch I have.  I used Asparagus instead of Broccoli, sliced ham instead of cubed, and Colby Cheese instead of Cheddar.  D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!

WOW!  I was skeptical to try this recipe out at first -- but boy, was I glad I tried it!  This dish is absolutely delicious and rediculously easy!  I am normally a crust lover but I didn't even notice that this one had no crust.  Also, the baking mix adds a richer flavour than with just egg and cheese.

I used spinach instead of broccoli, and could only find plain muffin mix at the grocery store... which is sweet so I was worried it may effect the quiche... but I lightly caramelized my onions, so perhaps the sugar complimented it?  Because it still turned out great. Anyway --- AWESOME RECIPE!!!

I've always wanted to try this and I was not disappointed!  I didn't have any broccoli or spinach so I ommitted them completely.  I also added 1 T dried minced onion and only used about 6 oz of cheddar cheese instead of 8.  Very tasty!  Highly recommend making it ahead of time and letting it set for a few hrs before eating.  I also forgot to add that I did not use the 1/4 cup of butter in the recipe (I overlooked it the first time) and taste was still great so will probably continue to omit in the future.

Wonderful recipe that can be customized many ways! I tried making it with sliced fresh mushrooms (sauteed in butter for 5 minutes before I added them) in the place of the veggies and shredded Monterey Jack cheese in the place of the cheese, and it turned out great -- I'll try it with another veggie/cheese combo next time. Great served warm for dinner, and the leftovers are delicious cold for lunch the next day.

My 19 month old loved it, however, we did not add any veggies only extra ham and cheese and it turned out wonderful.  I put it all together then put it in the fridge for about 5 hours then baked it .. it still turned out great!

It was a little buttery/greasy.  I did use premade deep dish pie crusts and doubled the recipe and it made three quiches.

Very tasty! I didn't have any ham and I halved the amount of cheeses to reduce fat and cost. Added diced red bell pepper, black pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Came out great and made a quick dinner for us. Good basic recipe that can be played around with. Thanks for sharing!

This quiche is quick and easy, especially if you don't have a pie crust on hand and don't feel like making your own. It really needs to be refridgerated overnight before serving though and requires a few added spices or it tastes rather bland. There are better recipes out there.

I just finished cooking this recipe for the second time and IT IS FABULOUS (My boyfriend went back for 3rds!!!).  The first time I tried this I didn't have ham so I used spicy sausage and it was just as good!  The only problem I had was that I don't have a food scale and I had a hard time measuring the cheese once I scaled it down to fit our family (2 adults and a 2 yr. old).  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Very easy quiche recipe!  I substuted two packages of frozen chopped spinach (thawed and WELL drained) added three more eggs and I had enough for two 8X8 pyrex dishes - one of which went in the freezer for later use!  (I'm thinking you could put it in the fridge the night before to defrost and just pop it in the oven for a quick breakfast)  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used frozen spinach instead of broccoli...cooked in a 9" casserole dish, so it came out more like a casserole than quiche, but was so awesome and easy...brought it to my playgroup for breakfast and everyone loved it...this is a keeper recipe! Thanks

I’ve made this recipe many times over the years with ham and broccoli or sausage and spinach or bacon sometimes.  The substitutions For meat and vegetables are endless, but the core recipe is the same.  It has never failed.

This was very good. I only changed it slightly, as another reader suggested put on 1 1/2 cups of milk and forgot to add the butter and put in about 1.5 tablespoons of melted butter right before I threw it in the oven. It turned out great. Served it with a fruit salad.

This recipe is so versatile and very forgiving!  I ran out of Parmesan so five Cheese Italian and some Parmesan Romano was subbed in.  I was in a rush and also accidentally added in too much homemade bisquick.  No broccoli but fresh spinach was subbed.  Also the ham was lunch meat cut up into bits.  No quiche pan so used 9x13 glass pan smeared in butter.  Holy moly that couldn’t have been easier.  I put it in the oven & hoped for the best.   It turned out really good!  Probably will add some spices next time and try adding in some more yummy items like minced onion, garlic, and maybe some bell peppers.  I have a feeling this recipe will accept a lot of variations.  Thank you for sharing!

My husband loves this recipe! I'm a huge fan of how quick and easy it is. 
In terms of calories, if you use 1% milk, a full pie is 3193 calories and 1/8 (or one slice) is 399 calories.
If you're a pig like me and decide to also use a Pillsbury crust to line your pie pan (totally unnecessary), then it's 3993 calories for s full pie and 499 calories per slice.

In my recipe, I added chorizo. I salute onions, with chorizo and added to the mix. I also made a second one with broccoli and mushrooms but the chorizo version was favorite..

I couldn't believe how wonderful this turned out. I didn't use ham because I wanted it to be vegetarian. I sauteed some green peppers and shallots and several cloves of garlic and used fresh broccoli in the mix. I also sprinkled the top with chipotle pepper to give it a little kick. The flour made a little crust on the bottom and the top browned nicely.  It was delicious and I will make it again.

This was good but the cooking time and temperature listed is too long and too hot. I cooked mine at 350 for 45 min and it was definitely done! Next time I would use more Bisquick mix as well.

Like many others, I kept the basic recipe and made a few additions.
I added about 1 1/2 to 2 packages of spinach. I used 1 1/2 cup of milk.
Added both cheddar and parmesan cheeses,  1 onion,  3 cloves of garlic as well as a little green and red pepper for color. 
It is a 1 pot wonder. I will make this again and again. There were 3 women at my gathering and we almost finished it. They raved & asked for the recipe. My roommate will probably finish it off tonight. 
I used a large pie pan/ Quiche pan.
I can't express how great this recipe is. Thanks to the original cook.

This is so good! The only change I made was using fresh broccoli. I used ham that was already cubed so it didn't take long to put together.

This quiche truly is as easy as adding everything in one bowl and then transferring to the baking dish! I typically don't like to modify recipes until I've at least tried it once, however I was missing a few items and had to swap out some things. I don't use cow's milk so I used the unsweetened unflavored almond milk I had. You honestly would never know it because it has the cheeses to add richness. I also didn't have ham so I swapped that out for a package of pre-cooked bacon with no nitrites/ates. .

As I'm sure you've read in other reviews, this recipe yields much more than one pie. In fact it filled two pie dishes perfectly. I baked the filling in a pre-made Pillsbury crust from the frozen section. It was $1.99 for a pack of two. INCREDIBLY TASTEY! My partner is a veteran of restaurant management and LOVED this quiche. Looking forward to trying this next time with no crust and substituting other vegetables and cheese. That's really the beauty of dishes like this; once you know how to make it there are so many options!

This is one of the best recipes ever. It's also one that I usually have everything on hand for. It is delicious and I get compliments everywhere I take it. I have sent the recipe to so many people! I accidentally OMITTED THE BUTTER one time early on and my friends and I liked it better ! I NEVER put the butter in it and I think it's fluffier and firmer without it. The combinations I make are: spinach and mushroom and Spinach and bacon. Wilt the spinach and mushrooms in some water in a pan, drain and blot as much water as you can with a paper towel. Brown bacon and blot with paper towel.

Loved this recipe! I’ve never made quich and this was super quick and easy to throw together last minute with rave reviews.  Only changes were that I used a bag of  chopped cauliflower & broccoli mix and used my hand chopped to make bits a little smaller. I also used shredded Parmesan instead of grated because that’s what I had on hand.

Amazing!  I will DEFINITELY be  making this again.  I used sausage instead of ham this first time and added way more herbs (shallot, green onions, cilantro, red bell pepper, garlic cloves) and I used spinach instead of broccoli.  Still amazing!!!!

I will make a few changes next time. Definitely use 2 pie plates because i used a 1.5 qt dish...and it was over cooked on the outside and under cooked on the inside! Bigger dish next time because it was delicious! I also added half a cup of sliced scallions and used a couple cheddar brats in place of the ham. I may cut the milk in half...thinking maybe why it had a hard time cooking through. But thank you for the great recipe! Really it was wonderful.

I made this for a group of friends.  I followed the recipe with two exceptions: 1. I used bacon instead of ham 2. I added a bit of garlic powder.  Everyone loved it.  I used a 9-inch deep dish pie pan and it fit perfectly.  Anything smaller would have overflowed.

Everyone loves this casserole!  Sometimes I change it up and add fresh asparagus instead of broccoli, 2 extra eggs and 1 teaspoon powdered onion.  Either way, it's always yummy.

OMG!  you have to make this at least once to see if you like it!
I swapped out the frozen broccoli with steamed fresh broccoli and again with asparagus. Tastes great with either vegatable.

I read the reviews before I made it and I did some of the ingredient adjustments like the comments say and it turned out great! I used 1 1/2c of almond milk, sprinkled some mustard powder and pepper. I also used freshly shaved Parmesan because I wanted bigger chunks of cheese! I added red, green, and yellow bell pepper along with the bacon and broccoli. My husband doesn’t like quiche but he really likes this! Thank you all for your comments! Definitely helps!!

Super easy, super good just as written. I used fresh broccoli, chopped small, and that worked fine. Next time I'll maybe add some onion or other seasoning, but it really is fine without.

I had been looking for a green chile quiche recipe that was going around in the 80's. Although I think the one I was looking for had cottage cheese in it, I decided on this one. I used 6 eggs instead of 4 and used canned green chilis instead of broccoli. It came out very fluffy, and I think even better than the recipe I was looking for.  There are endless possibilities with just the basic recipe. This morning I'm making it with chopped potatoes, onions and bell pepper.

This is one of my favorite recipes of all time. It doesn't matter which meats and veggies you add, I would just recommend cooking a few pieces of bacon and then sauteeing your veggies (and some garlic) in the fat. Baking this in a cast iron skillet creates the most amazing brown "crust" on the outside with a ton of flavor.

SO good. Used Bisquick for the baking mix, added less cheddar, maybe 1 cup of freshly shredded cheddar cheese (not an entire 8 oz block of cheese). I also used fresh broccoli florets and microwave steamed them for 1 minute prior to adding to the mixture.  This is a good base recipe to add any fillings you like.

I never leave reviews. I also almost never ask for recipes. When a friend of mine brought this to a potluck I had to have it.
It's so easy and so tasty. Lucky for me I'm the only one in my family who likes it, so lots for me!
I do everything but soften the butter (I'm lazy) and I add in whatever spices smell good. usually garlic salt and a spice mix from Costco. 
Ah-may-zing!

This was very good and very easy!  I made two quiches, one with broccoli, kale, shaved carrots and cheddar cheese, and one with asparagus, mushrooms, shaved carrots and swiss cheese, and they were both amazing!!   I also used Jiffy Baking Mix as that is what I had on hand.  I will definitely make this again!

I could not find the small 10oz packages of frozen chopped broccoli or spinach so I improvised and substituted a 10oz package of broccoli slaw mix. I cut the milk to 1 2/3 cup, and added 1/2 tbsp minced onion flakes. I put the whole mixture in a 9x13 glass pan and baked it for 45 minutes. It turned out really good! My husband and I both went back for seconds. The veggies were crisp-tender and the slivers of carrot added visual appeal. Will definitely make again!

This is just the most reliable meal/brunch/snack food there is!!  Always a hit!  I cut the parmesan to 1/2 cup, so salty, and reduce the butter to 2 tbsp.  I also add 1/2 of onion.

Surprisingly yummy given how easy it is!! I also chopped and cooked an onion and used turkey bacon instead of ham. I had a ton of pepper jack cheese to use up so I used that instead. I threw some tomatoes on top. I used Bob’s Red Mill gluten free pancake mix. I was really skeptical when I poured it in the dish and put it in the oven but an hour later it was golden brown and smelled wonderful. It is so fluffy and yummy! Will be making again! Great way to use up cheese or vegetables you don’t know what else to do with.

Mishy, pat yourself on the back! 
By far the BEST quiche I've ever made/had! I did make "minor" adjustments.

I sauted 1/4 cup onion with the butter in a saucepan. I also mixed up the cheeses, using half cup mozzarella and sharp cheddar. 2 tbs. Grated fresh garlic .  

I might eat the entire thing! It's that good!

I used turkey bacon, diced and grilled first.  Also added chopped fresh broccoli and chopped fresh spinach (1 C each). Because of the extra ingredients, I increased Bisquick to 1 cup instead of 3/4 C and added an additional egg.
Bake time was a bit longer.  Delicious!

I have been making this quiche to the recipe, and my family loves it. Today I needed to cook for 50 with a volunteer team. I wanted a vegetarian option, so I replaced the ham and broccoli with fresh spinach and fresh portabello mushrooms (diced). Oh my! It's even better.

We used what we had on hand, spinach instead of broccoli and Krusteaz instead of regular baking mix.  We also used 6 eggs instead of 4.  We poured it into a slightly larger quiche dish and only had to bake it 40 minutes instead of 50.
It was excellent!  Quick and simple -we will definitely have this again!

Really enjoyed this. I omitted the ham to make it vegetarian and added sautéed onion and red pepper instead. The latter especially added color and taste. I used mozzarella instead of cheddar but either will do. I decreased the milk a little otherwise it wouldn't fit in the pie plate. 45 minutes was just right so the top doesn't get too dark.

Made this into a large buffet brunch dish, filling a 9" x 13" baking pan, with on-hand pantry substitutions by adding 2 extra eggs (total 6) and, lacking broccoli, using a splash of olive oil for 1 sautéed medium chopped onion, 8 oz can mushroom stems and pieces, further chopped into consistent smaller pieces, and 4 minced cloves garlic,  with Polska Kielbasa (turkey, pork, and beef)  all sautéed together with onion till fragrant. Throw in a chopped roasted red pepper if you have some. Season lightly with salt and pepper (~1/4 teaspoon each) due to sodium content of sausage and other ingredients.  All other ingredients and process were the same. Onion-sausage mixture was added in place of the broccoli step. Baking time of 50 mins was perfect for the 9" x 13" version, with excellent browning for "toasty-cheese" flavor outside and creamy texture inside.

Cut the recipe in half.  I had fresh broccoli, that I par-cooked first.   Used a round 8" cake pan.   Turned out great.  at the 30 min mark turned the pan, convection oven tends to brown the front edge faster.  at 45 min the centre puffed up nicely.  So I turned the oven off and let it sit for the last 5 mins.   cooked through,  broccoli and ham evenly throughout.

I made changes just  because I had red, green peppers and spinach. Oh and onions.  I did have to put this in 2 pie plates but this was delish and was done in about 40 min.  I let it cool while I  cooked  chicken breast.  So good!

My go to—no ham, no biscuit mix added-just red & green peppers, maybe broccoli or asparagus if I have any. Doesn’t need all that cheddar 1/2 cup. I also sometimes add lump crab meat. It’s perfect!

This was excellent.  I added 1 tsp. of dry mustard to egg mixture and some finely diced yellow onion.  I layered turkey then broccoli then the cheeses before pouring egg mixture over it. Next time I will put foil over top for last 10-15 minutes to keep it from browning as much.

I have made it three times in the last 3 weeks for different weekend guests and it continues to please.  I will now have the ingredients as staples so can make it on the fly.  Haven’t tried the spinach substitute so that may be my next try.

Followed the recipe except I added 1 cup baking mix. Used Swiss cheese instead of parmesan and bacon instead of ham. Love this recipe because it's easy and so versatile.

I made it for a tea party. The children were skeptical, but the adults LOVED it! I used half spinach, half broccoli. I thought it require additional seasoning, but the cheeses and ham were salty enough.

I figured I give this one a try as my family and I love a good quiche and am I glad I did.  It was delicious!!  I did not make any changes at all.  Make sure you preheat the oven as said so it's nice and hot when you put the quiche in.  It baked for exactly 50  minutes.  I let it sit about 15 minutes before cutting it .  This will be my Sunday morning routine now.  It's a keeper!

Good base but definitely needed something.  Next time I'll add a dash of cayenne.  I also sautéed yellow onions and garlic to add to the mix.

I don’t like when some reviewer‘s change a recipe so that it doesn’t resemble the recipe being reviewed. So I’m just going to tell you that I did two things : I sautéed a little onion and used cooked bacon instead of ham. This is really yummy quiche!

I enjoyed making this recipe with my little son. I added some onion and a yellow pepper (sautéed in half the butter), used fresh broccoli that I steamed, substituted a cup of cubed feta for the ham, and omitted the other half of the butter. There was way too much for my 10” quiche pan, so I also made 6 small quiches in a muffin tin. The muffin quiches were done in under 30 minutes and turned out perfectly. The larger quiche I left in for the 50 minutes and it was over cooked - next time, I’ll remove it around 40 minutes. Taste was great - didn’t really get the crust at all but it held its shape really well.

Update:  I have made this quiche (with various seasonings and add ins) 4 times in the past several weeks since the 1st post.  We love it every time!  Great as leftovers, too!

I love this quick quiche.  I used turkey bacon, sautéed onions and mushrooms with a little red pepper, too, and it’s really good.  It’s especially good the next day warmed up.

This is a great recipe. I used it as a base and added my own ingredients. We had all kinds of leftovers...some roasted potatoes, sautéed mushrooms, bacon, a bit of broccoli, tiny sausage meatballs, some peas, tomatoes, green onions..... I added all the bits of pieces I found in the fridge and sautéed with a little onion and garlic. To this I added the milk, eggs, bisquick and cheese and voila, a great quiche. I also did two thinner quiches which meant baking time was down to 25-30 minutes.

I made this the first time with leftover ham from Christmas dinner. I didn't have broccoli so I threw in some spinach. The hubby and I both loved it! So easy to make after a long day at work.

This was very good.  I made it gluten free by using GF Bisquick.  When I cut into it, the very center was not done, so I just left the center in the dish and put it back in the oven for about 15 minutes.  (So 50 minutes wasn't enough for me)  I served 2 slices without the center and it was fine.  Instead of broccoli, I had a bag of stir fry veggies--broccoli, carrots, onion, sweet red pepper, water chestnut and celery--so I used that instead and it added a nice texture and flavor.  I used a 10 inch quiche pan and filled it to the top, so the quiche was quite deep.   My husband really liked it, and so did I.

Very good, and super easy.  I've made it twice, and both times it was delicious. I used chicken instead of ham, and the second time I used about half the butter to make it a little less rich. My 3 year old loved it!

One of my favorite recipes of all times. But I almost couldn't bring myself to mix the Bisquick right into the filling that first time ! I always have the ingredients to make some version of this. I've made it with ham and spinach, spinach and mushrooms but our fave is bacon and spinach. I've used fresh or frozen spinach, make sure to wilt the fresh spinach and squeeze all the water out. This recipe is delicious and one of the easiest recipes I've ever made. It's great reheated. I'm known for making this dish and give out the recipe routinely. I leave the butter out entirely, not for health reasons, I just like it better that way; it's fluffier and not greasy. If you don't used ham or bacon, I would recommend adding a 1/2tsp. of salt.

This is a great basic recipe.  It could be a little bland, as is, and can be customized infinite ways.  I have completely changed up meats and vegetables and it always comes out great.   Addition options include onions, tomatoes, bell peppers, salt, pepper, red chili and other spices.  This is a great way to start getting veggies early in the day.

Yes, it was easy, but it really wasn't quiche. I thought it might make a nice make-ahead breakfast for the week. Too much batter for a pie plate, too wet for a spring form pan, I  went with a round cake pan. In the oven, it separated into three layers: a biscuit-like "crust",  a custard, and a cheddar topping. I mean like  A LOT of cheddar topping ... greasy and salty and rich. One small piece was so rich I had to stop, but one small piece left me hungry. I won't be making it again.

Delicious! I used a 9 x 9 square pan and substituted the Biscuick with 1/4 cup flour instead.   The whole family loved it. I also used bacon instead of ham because that's what I had.

I didn't have the baking mix so I subbed in Corn Muffin Mix and that worked out great!!!  I also added in some chopped peppers and fresh tomato.  It did take longer than the 50 minutes but was worth the wait!

Excellent recipe! Base is great and can be used with many different meats, veggies, cheeses. I did cut milk by 1/4 C.   Made for a brunch and had to share the recipe. :) Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a big hit with everyone. Very easy, simple recipe but just make sure you have the right size pan to cook it in or it will overflow. I made it exactly the way recipe states with no substitutes.

Way too much butter! I cut it down to 1/4 stick, because the butter rises to the top and congeals there once the eggs settle from an almost souffle state.  I would also substitute the ham for bacon or bacon bits for a vegetarian version. The combination of cheeses and butter becomes too oily. I used Zatarain's biscuit mix, and it seemed too little too cake up the quiche.  Use your discretion with the butter, but definitely go less than a half stick.

I don't care for ham and wanted to use what I had on hand. My alterations--
1) I made crunchy bacon bits to sprinkle on top with about 1/3 of the cheese (mixed 2/3 in)
2) 1.5 cups chopped fresh broccoli
3) half small vidalia
4) 1/8 c yellow pepper
5) I used raw, extra sharp cheese and it makes a big difference compared to the kraft kind of stuff. So much more depth and flavor. 
6) we had smashed red potatoes w it. Next time I will chop up a couple boiled potatoes and put them in the quiche 
7) all veggies went in raw

So yummy! And really is easy. I enhanced a bit as some other reviewers suggested. 
Didn't have any frozen veggies so I added a 5oz container of "super spinach" fresh greens. I sautéed half of a small red onion with a heaping 1/2 teaspoon of jarred minced garlic. Added a 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper. 

I stirred the fresh spinach in last and was worried that it looked like too many greens. There did not seem to be enough liquid mixture, but everything came out beautifully. In fact the crispy edges of the spinach mix was an unexpected and delicious thing. 

I did have to cook for a little more than an hour before the center was set.

I made the quiche in a tart pan...couldn't fit in all the ingredients as the pan was shallow but beats buying a special pan. Also I used fresh broccoli that was par cooked and then chopped. It was delicious!

This is my go-to quiche recipe. I've made it numerous times, & it always turns out perfectly. It's a versatile recipe as well. I've made it "as is" with ham & broccoli, also sausage & cheese (make sure you drain the grease from the sausage well), also a Greek version with feta, spinach, & tomato. You really can't mess it up, & everyone always enjoys it. It's nice to serve with a fruit salad or fried potatoes.

Great recipe, easy to follow.  This is a great basic recipe where you can modify the ingredient to taste.  I'll change out the protein, veggies, and cheese based on what I have on hand or what I'm in the mood for.  Just as good leftover.  I'll make double batches ahead of time and reheat when serving large number of guests.

I would definitely make this again. It's now a favorite of my family! They went back for 2nds! 

 Easy, one bowl recipe.

I used spinach instead of broccoli (only because that's what I had in the fridge). And I had some grated parmesan cheese that was garlic flavored, so I used 1/2 c. of that and 1/2 c. of the plain grated parmesan cheese. This probably gave it more flavor.

Mmmm....Mmmmm... Good!

I love this recipe and have made it several times.  I substitute Egg Beaters for the egg, use skim milk, and change the meat, cheese and vegetable to what ever I have on hand.   Highly recommended for a simple and easy dinner along with a side salad.

Delicious. I didn't have all the ingredients the recipe called for so I had to make do with what I had. I didn't have biscuit mix so I used flour and added about a teaspoon of baking powder and baking soda and salt. I only had fresh broccoli. I used cheddar plus Swiss cheese.

I let it cook about three minutes too long and the top got too brown. Not burned, just real brown. So be watchful. Otherwise it was incredibly tasty. Definitely five stars

I've been making this now for years. It is my go to quiche recipe and it never fails to disapoint. I always use fresh veggies and whatever ham type thing l have on hand... Canadian bacon, diced ham, even lunchmeat. I rarely have the time and in the past haven't had the space to make my own crust. But now that l have the space l still say why bother. Because this turns out perfect. My husband even loves it. I always make it in a glass pie plate and everything fits perfectly. Thanks so much for this recipe!

I made it pretty much as written of the quiche ingredients at the same time of cleaning out my fridge.  I lightly browned some  ground sausage with some green pepper and some chopped onion.  I finished off 3 bags of cheeses that were open, and about 1/4 opened package of cream cheese.  Yummy!

This has become our favorite Quiche!  The only change I made is to add bacon; this is how I got my husband to like quiche.  He's happy and I am happy with adding greens!!

Love this recipe!! It’s a go-to in my house. If you don’t have biscuit mix laying around, a good substitute is 3/4 cups of four, 1tsp of baking powder and a pinch of salt. I also found that if you sift the dry ingredients (using a sifter) into the egg and milk mixture while whisking it won’t clump up. Over all a great recipe!

a great and easy base recipe. we don't miss the crust at all.
bakes up light and fluffy, my picky husband loves it.
i use the recipe as stated except...
i change the veggies/meat depending on what leftovers i have in the fridge.
this has become an almost weekly meal for us. at least once every 2 weeks.  to use up the leftovers-- LOL
i've made it in a pie pan and in cupcake pan. i just take it out when it's brown. about 40-50 min in pie pan and about 20+ in cupcakes. i prefer the pie pan-- it's more fluffy and moist.
the more veggies/meat you add, the more you make lol!
sometimes this makes 1 pie, sometimes 2. depends on my leftovers. LOL!

This  is a great recipe, I took it to a lunch potluck & made it before I went to work. I didn't use ham as there is a vegetarian in our group. Used mushrooms instead. Everyone loved it! So easy using Bisquick!

Made this last night and it was really good. I used a little less than 2 cups of milk. Didn't have any ham, but chopped up some spinach and mushrooms to go along with the broccoli. The recipe as is filled up 2 of my "deep dish" pie crust that I bought. It tastes pretty good, but it could use a spice or two to give it some kick.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! My family requests I make this at least 2-3 times a month. The ingredients are so easy to swap out in this dish. I will make it with bacon and spinach, ground beef and onions, or asparagus and green onions. They have all come out very good.

So yummy!  I've made it with different veggies; asparagus, mushrooms, etc depending what I have on hand.  I followed the recipe exactly but I had enough filling for two pre-made pie crusts.  Maybe I accidentally got smaller pie shells but luckily they came two to a pack so I just made them both & popped the extra in the fridge for breakfasts that week.

I also added the sautéed onions and garlic and blanched fresh broccoli ' then chopped fine. My Parmesan was coarse grated, which really made it flavorful .....simply awesome. Wish I could find a more wholesome baking mix than general commercial one. Don't really want to make my own, but easy peasy and delish.

This is so good and sooooo easy! I did cook it at 350 for 60 min, instead of the recommended 375 for 50 minutes. It was a little runny with  the recommended time/temp. But, otherwise, delicious :)

Made this a couple of times and it always turns out excellent. It's an incredibly forgiving recipe so it's easy to play around with - my favorite so far is substituting 1 cup of caramelized onions + 3 cups of sauteed zuchinni in Greek seasonings for the ham and broccoli. I also found the increasing the biscuit mix proportion led to a lighter, fluffier texture.

Super quick and easy to make. Delicious as written. For variety vegetable and meat can be easily changed. I have made with spinach or kale and crumbled sausage. Be aware the picture posted does not look like the finished quiche.  This quiche does not have a crust.

Turned out great, took it for Friday Treats at work and it was gobbled up. Two changes- I didn't have broccoli so I used frozen spinach, didn't have ham either but I did have Italian sausage. Both substitutes worked out well. It was delish.

This was very good and easy. After looking at the ingredients, I used some leftover homemade cheesy broccoli soup. I just added the eggs, biscuit mix, and sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on the top. I baked the quiche in muffin tins and they only took about 15 minutes. Very tasty! I always love to find a way to use leftovers  too.

My family just loves this dish.  I've added onion and ham, replaced the broccoli with spinach and even squash.  Experimented with different types of cheese.  And each time I've made it I was never let down.  I now have my sisters making this recipe for their families as well.

I made this tonight and it was phenomenal . So easy.  I put it in another 20 minutes, and topped the quiche with dried wild mushrooms. Thanks to you Mishy. This is from an old guy

Made this last night after ingredient search for a way to use leftover ham & turkey lunch meat and gouda & muenster cheese slices, with whatever else I had on hand.  This fit the bill, was easy, and I was impressed how it turned out and tasted.

I had fresh broccoli, and purposefully over-measured/guestimated slightly on the base since I had lots of lunch meat and cheese to use up, and it made 2 nice 9" pie pans.  Threw in a can of mushrooms and some diced onion I had leftover.  I used gouda and muenster cheese slices that I broke up into bits, and threw in some shredded taco-blend cheese for good cheesy measure.  Seasoned the batter with Nature's Seasons to taste.  I had some errands to run so I set it at 330, covered loosely with foil, and cooked for about 50 minutes while I was gone.  Finished it off uncovered at 375, and then broil, for the last few minutes after I got home.  Came out perfect!  I'd never made, or even tasted quiche before - but now have a new, staple recipe for "throw together" ingredients that can be varied.  Thanks!

I substituted spinach for broccoli and used feta cheese instead of Parmesan cheese. Cook time was closer to 25 minutes.

Outstanding!  This dish is delicious but the actual prep time  is closer to 30 minutes - still quick to make.  I also added garlic and 1/4 to 1/2 small onion for better flavor. Will fill two pie plates so it will last a long time in the fridge.  I used  the Red Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuit mix as that was all I had on hand and it turned out perfect.

Had lots of eggs left over from Christmas, so I decided to do a quiche.  My sister has used this one and her are always good.  This is such an easy recipe and has good flavor.  I did use spinach instead of broccoli (just as good) and I put in more ham than the recipe called for because I love ham.  Just know that this is a big recipe and I used two deep dish pie crusts (one to eat, one to freeze for later!)  Thanks for two nights of dinner!!

*I didn't have bisquick, so I used a recipe from all recipes for that, too!!

Nothing is complete without at least a little salt and pepper.  So I added both to my egg batter.  I did change the recipe from broccoli to fresh sautéed spinach and mushrooms.  I also decreased the milk to 1 1/2 cups.  I did like that the biscuit mix helped form a bit of a crust.  It baked up firm but fluffy.  This is a good starter recipe, that can be changed to any specific taste.   Oh and it was pretty yummy too!

This dish is a timeless classic..with some alterations that cater to your preferences.   I've never used this recipe as is, more as a baseline to jump off from.  I've made three-meat quiche; veggie lovers quiche, and currently in the oven is a chicken bacon broccoli quiche that my wife and I can't wait to try.  One thing we always (at least I do, she's made this recipe a few times in the same fashion-using what we have available) is add some sauteed onions, and some garlic.  Ground or dried mustard and paprika make for some strange killer combo that dances around your mouth and hasn't failed me yet.  

In conclusion, quiche works as dinner, lunch and breakfast, and this is a recipe I almost am always pantry-prepped for.  Tweak this recipe to whatever your taste buds be, and you'll be in for a treat :)

I made this tonight, it was absolutely amazing. The only change I made was adding sauteed onions and mushrooms, also swapped out the broccoli for spinach. I will probably cut back the milk by half a cup also next time.

It was great! Followed advice of other reviewers: reduced milk to 1 cup, used extra broccoli and cheese, and packed the cheese into the bottom of the pie crust and baked it a few min before adding the other ingredients. It made just enough filling for a deep dish frozen pie crust!

This was absolutely delicious! I had more ham so I added it and I used cooked chopped red peppers as I did not have any spinach or broccoli. I used a 10" quiche dish and cooked it in the center of the oven for 50 minutes. It came out perfectly. My husband LOVED it!

I loved this recipe.  Was easy to make but I used what I had on hand which was bacon, spinach, sautéed onion and roasted red peppers.  It's one of those recipes that you can add whatever you like.

Brought this to a football tailgate!  Baked the day before and reheated morning of the game.  It was a HUGE hit!  I will definitely make again and have already shared the recipe.  Added 1 extra egg and tbsp. of bisquick.  Dry mustard and garlic powder.

Excellent recipe.  I made my own biscuit mix (froze the rest) as I prefer a more savoury taste (i.e. no sugar).  Took the advice of most helpful positive review and added sweated onions and red pepper.  Very good taste.  I took it for breakfast all this week. I would have no problem serving this to guests.  Very pretty.

very good. Added 1/2 t. ground mustard and some dried onion.  I would bring mixture to room temp before baking.  In glass pan (turn oven down?) the top and bottom burned a little at 1 hr.

I used egg/bisquick mix but then just used available veggies. Loved the consistancy and that it seemed to hold heat better than the standard quiche. Also good with or without pie crust.

I put mine in pie crusts! Partially baked them first (7 minutes at 400). I used ground turkey for the meat, browning it with sautéed onions. I also threw in some kosher salt and mustard powder. I used the same amounts of everything else and had enough to fill 2 pie dishes plus 6 muffin cups. My filling was really runny but I baked it for about 47 minutes and it turned out perfect. Not runny at all and crusts were super flaky.

This was really, really tasty! I think I put too much in my dish and had to cook it about 6 minutes longer than suggested, but that was OK. I put in pre cooked sausage, Sauteed onions and broccoli and both kinds of cheese. I also used one cup whole milk and one cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk. It gave the quiche a nice, savory taste. I will definitely keep this recipe and change around the vegetable/meat options based on what I have in the kitchen. Thanks!!

Love it! The only change I make is to use 6 eggs.  And like others, use what veggies and meat I have on hand. Never fails. Seriously never.

I omitted the ham and broccoli but added the following: baby bell peppers, onion, mushrooms and baby spinach. I didn't have enough parmesan so I added some low fat feta cheese crumbles and omitted the cube of butter.

I followed the advice of some other reviewers and sautéed 1 small onion and a couple cloves of garlic, then added the broccoli.  I also added red and green bell pepper.  When those were soft, I added spinach and baby kale.  Added 1 teaspoon dry mustard, then salt and pepper to taste. While the veggies were cooking in a 12 inch cast iron pan, I made the batter (decreased the milk to 1 1/2 cups).  I added the batter to the cast iron pan, mixed everything thoroughly, then put the pan in the preheated oven. In a 12 inch pan, it took only 30 minutes to bake to a beautiful presentation. Hubby loved it!  It should reheat great for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks, Mishy, for the great recipe!

I thought this was just okay though it was better the next day. I think with some adjustments I might like it better but written as is, it was fair.

Love love love this recipe. So easy and you can basically add whatever you want as a filling. If doing a lot of vegetables cut down on the amount of liquid you add as it can get watery. Great with a pie crust as well.

I use this recipe, but omit the broccoli & ham, adding instead frozen harvest apples and a little added sweetener.  Cheese & apple quiche--a not-too-sweet apple pie, great for brunch.

Biscuit mix and pie crust quiche taste is exactly the same! I used cheddar/garlic biscuit mix & it was very flavorful.

Tried this quiche recipe as a way to use up some leftover ham and broccoli. Very easy recipe and we loved it.  I used fresh broccoli because that's what I had.

Very easy to make. My husband loved it - he's a picky eater. The only changes I made was substituting spinach for broccoli, personal preference. Since I don't have a casserole dish, I used two round cake pans. It was ready in 45 minutes. I will definitely make this again!

Excellent recipe. I only made a few changes. I use skim milk, skip the ham & broccoli, I add a bag of frozen peppers and onion mix straight from the freezer. I bang it a few times so it is not stuck together. I use margarine that I melt in the microwave for 30 seconds. It is my go to recipe for when I don't feel like cooking. Kids and my husband love it.

Great recipe! Have made this twice and swapped ham for bacon and broccoli for sauteed spinach and mushrooms the second time. Also added sliced scallions and felt this was a great addition. Love the simplicity and pretty fool proof, will continue to make this for large groups.

This was my first quiche that I have ever made and it turned out FABULOUS! The only thing that i did differently was sauteing some onions and green peppers then added it to the mix. This make a great dinner and then breakfast the next morning.

This was my first attempt at quiche.  I'm not sure if it needed more cook time or what but it tasted like good soggy bread.  Wish it was firmer, it did taste good though.  My onion loving husband said it needed onions but I don't care for them so I was fine without.  Thanks for sharing, glad I tried it.

Baked in a 9x11 glass baking dish at 375 for about 40 minutes;  it was delicious and perfectly done.  I used cooked frozen broccoli, bacon, chopped up ham slices, and sharp cheddar cheese.  Added sauted onion and some garlic powder.

So easy - I added a Swiss-gruyere cheese mix instead and used ham and spinach. I've also done asparagus cheddar and ham. So versatile and using Bisquick instead of a pre made crust is so much tastier.

Five yummy tummies! Everyone who ate this quiche when I made it raved about it! I add a few extra ounces of fresh broccoli I parboil and use a healthy bacon I bake first and then chop up. I prefer the bacon to the ham. I have made it a few times with the ham. I also have used mozzarella cheese with the recipe.

Don't try to double the recipe unless you are using more than one dish to bake it in. I also added onion powder and garlic powder, it really needed it.

Quick and easy! Since there are no broccoli fans in my home, I substituted yellow and red peppers and baked for 45 minutes instead of 50. This recipe is very versatile. Our favorite version is bacon and mushroom with pepper jack cheese. You can pretty much throw anything in here and it will come out tasting delicious! I've made this several times using different meats and cheeses and it always works.

I did try it; I used fresh asparagus instead of broccoli or spinach.  I steamed it until tender and added it to the mix.  It had a wonderful asparagus flavor.

Love this recipe! Usually omit the butter as the oil from the cheese makes it too greasy! I always add whatever left over vegetables that I have. This time I added smoked salmon and asparagus. So yummy and easy!

Wow, I have to admit I am pleasantly surprised. I thought the whole biscuit idea versus pie crust was going to take away from it, but it didn't at all. I used fresh broccoli instead, and it turned out delish! And it was so simple.

Since I am celiac, I substituted Pamela's baking & pancake mix -- worked perfectly. Having read other reviews, I added sautéed onions, mushrooms and garlic; used spinach in place of broccoli and reduced the milk to 1 1/4 cup.  Also used a deep 10" quiche dish which was filled almost to the brim -- this makes a HUGE amount. Baked it for 40 mins and it was a bit overdone.  Next time will either reduce temp or time and may try gorgonzola with mozzarella. Great dish for a potluck.  It was a hit.

This was outstanding, delicious, and so easy.  I used reduced fat bisquick and lowfat milk as well as using parmesan cheese since i ran out of cheddar cheese.  Very simple and its idiot proof.  Will become my go to recipe for quiche.  I will try it next in muffin tins so I can freeze individual portions.

I love this recipe! I make it all the time for my husband and I and whenever company is visiting. I usually follow the recipe but instead of butter I use coconut oil, and use almond milk instead of regular milk. I don't usually measure out my cheese either... I just add as much as I think necessary along with whatever veggies and meats I have. It always comes out just perfect! The bisquick kinda gives it a slight crust as well. :)

Better than any other quiche I have ever made.  We substituted a little muenster cheese and gave it a great flavor.  We also made the quiche in Ramekin dishes which turned out beautifully.  This would be perfect for a brunch.

It would have gotten 3 stars but I think with editing in the future is would be great. I agree with others, it has way to much butter. I also had a problem with the middle setting so in the future I'm going to cut back on the milk by 1/4 cup and cook this in a casserole dish instead of a quiche dish. I omitted the broccoli because no one in my home will eat it and added sauted onion and mushrooms. Next time I also plan to add spinach.

So good, this is hubby's favorite dish.  In use spinach instead of broccoli and add various veggies (this one had the spinach as well as mushrooms and onions, as well as ham!).

Loved the flavor... I used asparagus, broccoli cuts, and fresh spinach... Diced up some Oscar Meyer cold cut turkey (the one with no nitrates- because it's what I had on hand) salt & pepper sprinkled on top and also used mozzarella and mixes of cheddar instead of Parmesan - because I didn't have any... I also made some thin slices of red onion.. And sprinkled those on top after I put all ingredients into the pie plate.... Hubby loved it and it was so easy!

This is an excellent recipe,  I brought it to a potluck today at work, and it disappeared very fast!  Very easy to make and very tasty.   I changed the recipe just a little by adding sautéed shallots and 2 cloves of garlic, and a 1/4 tsp of black pepper.  I was surprised the recipe didn't call for salt and pepper, but I thought maybe the  cheese would make it salty enough.... Not so... Next time I will add salt too...it was a little bland, but this recipe is a keeper!   Oh, and I used fresh broccoli florets...not frozen)

Simple, endlessly customizable quiche recipe that always gets rave reviews. For parties (like the brunch I hosted today), pour the batter into muffin tins (with or without liners), and not only makes the perfect individual portions, but cooks faster!

I have made this quiche numerous times with great results.  I use whatever cooked veggies I have on hand.  I really like using oven roasted veggies. I typically roast a mix of: cauliflower/onion/zucchini/green pepper/eggplant tossed with EVOO a light dash of salt and sometimes a dash of Italian Seasoning @ 425 until soft/browned approx 30-45 min . I have also used fried bacon.  I add some of the shredded cheese into the quiche filling and then more on top.
I never use 1/4 stick butter..more like 1-2T, I'm not even sure if it's necessary.  I love that this has no formal crust to get undercooked or soggy. This reheats well and I have literately eaten this for every meal of the day!  Great way to use leftovers. Try this one!

I made this for my family using the left-over ham from Easter. They all loved it so much that I've been making it like so far 2 times a month. Love it because you have hardly no prep time and you put it in the oven and you can forget about it until you smell it and everyone starts saying "oh it smells good" or the timer goes off. How easy is that...

I have used this so many times! sometimes I caramelize onions, sauté sweet peppers and spinach and bacon bits instead of the ham and broccoli , this recipe is so versatile . I sometimes bake it in individual quiche pans and take one to work for lunch. Thank you for sharing this one and others.

I accidentally left the melted butter in the microwave and baked it w/o it and it was still yummy! For the cheese I used Colby jack cheese, and used turkey deli meat and broke it into smaller pieces. I also added grilled chopped onions. It was delicious! I will definitely keep this recipe in hand and swap ingredients depending what I happen to have in my fridge. LOVE how versatile this recipe can be!

I have made this recipe many times. It is awesome! I have made as it was written, and I have used chicken instead of ham, frozen spinach instead of broccoli. My favorite is using spinach with whatever meat is available. It would also be good using bacon. It is so easy, and delicious. We have it for dinner about once a month.

Well, this was my first time making quiche. I can't believe I'be been cooking 30 years and haven't made one, but there you go.  I love this recipe, although i would likely call it a brunch bread as it is not the texture of quiche, which is just fine!! I caramelized some shallots and finished them with balsamic vineagar, added cooked asparagus, parm adn shredded Tex Mex blend cheese (basically what I had on hand). They I realized that what i thought was biscuit mix was actually pancake mix, so I improvised with a teaspoon of baking powder, 3/4 cup flour, pinch of salt and that butter that everyone else was deleting. I also added a teaspoon of dried mustard powder, thyme and some pepper. It was definitely lumpy and dense, so i finished it by laying some sliced tomatoes on the top. I baked it in a 9x9 glass pan for 45 minutes and it was perfectly done in that time. I did not eat it hot, I was actually making it for lunches this week.  I just tried it and it was delicious! much denser that quiche, without the jiggle (which puts my family off anyway, so this is a good thing).  I will definitely try this one again!

My family loved this- I made a few changes:
I used gluten free Bisquick, fresh broccoli & frozen chopped onions- no ham. Since I didn't cook the broccoli or thaw the onions, I was a little worried - but it was great! I served it as a side dish with roasted chicken- a nice change from usual side dishes.  I DEFINITELY see this as a regular meal option.

This was easy and delicious! I made it exactly as it was called for but did not have a quiche pan so split it up amongst 2 cake pans which was even better because one came out with more ham and broccoli and one came out with more broccoli which made it seem that we had 2 dishes. Next time (just for something different) I plan to add different ingredients such as mushrooms, onion, etc. Also, by making it in cake pans (splitting it up)(yeah, there is that much) it did not have to cook as long (shaved about 15-20 minutes off cook time).

My husband (who likes really hearty meals) raved about it and said "we will definitely be making this again." 

Perfect as is! Thanks for the low budget meal (got all ingredients at Aldi!)!

Not sure if I like the idea of using baking mix.  With 2 cups of milk and 3/4 of a cup of mix, the batter was not anywhere close to lumpy.  Giving it a try to see how it goes though.  Hope I am wrong and its great!

This recipe was super easy to make and it was delicious! I loved that no crust was needed. Felt it was healthier that way. I substituted veggies for sweet plantains and my kids loved it!  I'm looking forward to mixing different ingredients. I will definitely use again and again!

This truly is an EASY Quiche recipe.  Not to mention easily convertible.  I used Cheddar, Ham, Bacon and added a little Onion and Garlic to it.  It turned out great.  I get asked to make these all the time now.  Using leftovers works great for this too.

Super easy family meal. I've made this twice now, my family requested it after trying it the first time. It was yummy and easy to make. I made it without the ham since I'm a vegetarian, but my meat-eating family didn't complain.

Good, basic recipe.  I changed a lot so unfortunately it wasn't just a one-bowl recipe.  I sautéed onions and garlic, added broccoli and zucchini and used mozzarella and sharp cheddar instead of parmesan.  I baked it for 40mins then broiled for 3.  Came out perfect .. though I should have let it rest before I sliced it :3

Super Tasty...i added onions and green peppers to mine.  The recipe did make enough for me to fill my 2 auiche pans.  It was even better the second day when it was cooked a little longer and got even more brown around the edges. YUM!!

Turned out wonderful!!!! I don't have a quiche pan, so I did it in an 8" spring form :) I followed the directions exactly including cook time, no substitutions or alterations were made, was overly cheesy though, so middle was a little bit runny, but I think it's because I used a block cheese and shredded it, so I am not sure if maybe I added a little too much cheese, also, not really any crust to speak of, but again, could have been the pan I used, nevertheless was still delicious :) Great recipe, Thanks!

Awesome!  Made this with a box of frozen spinach (thawed with water squeezed out) and gruyere cheese.  Beautiful, thick, crustless and held together perfectly!

I made this for my husband and he LOVED this recipe. He asked if there was more and that never happens! I used chicken, broccoli, red & green peppers, 4 cheese blend, romano and parmesean grated cheese, milk, eggs, biscuit baking mix, and butter.

Great.  So easy, just what I was looking for on a lazy evening.  I did add 1/2 tsp of dry mustard, 1/2 tsp of onion powder and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder.  Easy enough to do.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I was skeptical about this, but it came out very nicely. I still missed not having a crust, though. I'm actually thinking of trying the recipe out again, but pouring the batter into a premade crust, instead of just a dish. I used only a 1/2 cup of parm and didn't miss the other 1/2. I also used tuna instead of ham. Very tasty and cooked up great, wasn't runny at all (which is a problem I sometimes have with quiche) Will try again!

This quiche was a litte too oily, I think it was the amount of cheese the recipe calls for. I did mine with spinach and mushrooms. I'll cut down on the amount of cheese next time.

I made this recipe for brunch today and got rave reviews! The only changes I made were due to necessity (items I had on hand)  So here they are: chopped fresh kale instead of spinach, 1 1/2 cups of milk (all I had) and colby jack instead of cheddar. I also added a teaspoon of garlic powder and a pinch of salt and pepper. After reading another review I opted to use muffin cups which cut the baking time down to 35 minutes and made 15 individual muffin sized quiches. This recipe is excellent and lends itself to so many different variations which means it will definitely go into my regular breakfast rotation. I'm also going to try to freeze a few "muffins" to see how well they reheat, which would make them even more convenient!

Made this on Sat night for supper - will definitely make this again.   I use 4 sliced of crumbled bacon cooked in the microwave instead of ham.   Added fresh pepper and salt after cooking.   The bisquick isn't really noticeable. It just adds to a more dense texture than a plain quiche.  This makes a good hearty option for breakfast-for-supper.     I used an 8x8 pan instead.  My husband and I finished about 2/3 of the dish.

I am not a very good cook, but this was even easy for me.  I made a few adjustments; I added about 3/4 of a package of mini pepperoni and took out the veggies.  Everyone loved this, especially the men!  I made two, one for my fiance's family and one for mine on Thanksgiving.  I had people requesting the recipe all day!  Thanks!

This quiche was wonderful and easy. The only difference I would make is to put perhaps 1/4 to 1/2 cup less milk although it turned out perfectly as is. I highly recommend it!!

This COULD BE the best quiche I've ever made and/or TASTED!!!!   I cut back just a little bit on the milk and a little on the cheese - I'd rather go a tad bit more dry than wet with quiche and it was PERFECT!!!  I will make this whenever I have a brunch or lunch!!!

We really needed to get away from fried eggs, bacon and potatoes in my home!  This is a great EASY recipe to cut fat and be creative.  I used skimmed milk, low fat Bisquick, and turkey bacon.  I subbed spinach for the broccoli and cut the cheese in half using what I had in my fridge (swiss and a cheddar/jack blend) along with the parmesan.    I also added green onions that I had left over from a previous recipe.  I love that everything went into one mixing bowl!  I baked the recipe in a square glass pan and it came out great.  We will share this over and over again on the weekends!  Thanks for the great recipe Mishy!

I didn't have any broccoli when I tried this recipe and ended up just using onion. I also added blue cheese. This quiche was incredibly delicious and ended up being just as good reheated (both microwaved and in a toaster oven). I plan on making it again next week.

i absolutely love this recipe.  i do sub in spinach for the broccoli and use chopped, cooked bacon instead of ham.  if you manage to have any leftovers they are great warmed up again too.  i make it in a cake pan often, which works well.

Very easy and delicious recipe.  I had leftover ham, and fresh spinach on hand to make the quiche.  The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is that my personal preference on quiche is more dense and custardy, but my husband thought this was the best recipe hands down, and he especially liked that it was fluffy and light.  The Bisquick is what 'rises' the egg/milk/cheese mixture to create a texture that is lighter.   Instead of using cheddar cheese, I used a mix of gruyere, parmesan, and asiago, which gave it a wonderful rich medley of those fragrant hard cheese.  I will make this again.  The quiche looks very appealing because of the nice browning effect from the Bisquick.  Thank you for sharing!

If you add a little extra parmason cheese it gives it a little bit of a better taste.

I thought there was too much cheese in this recipe. I told my husband this and he responded, "Is there such a thing as too much cheese?"  Well, personal preference I guess, but I like it to be more eggy. I also added a little onion powder, garlic powder and salt for extra flavor.

This is really good for people who don't love traditional quiche. My 15 year old thought it was a bit too fluffy so I am adding an extra egg to see if that helps.

I made this today for brunch for my husband and me, it was great.  The only alteration I made was substituting spinach for the broccoli.  I don't like broccoli, but my husband does so I'll have to try it with the broccoli for him sometime.  We both agreed that next time mushrooms should be added.  Thanks for sharing.

Love it! We had this twice in one week, the first time with swiss cheese, ham and spinach.  The second just used the exact recipe and added a little bit of bacon.  My husband said it was a keeper and my 2 yr old gobbled it up.

This is definitely easy, but not my favorite. I made it for a baby shower and the guests liked it, but something about it left a bad aftertaste in my mouth. I might try again, but like real quiche better.

This is a GREAT basic recipe.  I only gave it 4 stars as to me it was more of a egg casserole than a quiche.  Per other reviewers I added sauteed onions and mushrooms and also sauteed 1/2 of the ham as well.  Added sprinkle of tastefully simple's Garlic Garlic and dash of salt/ppr.  I only had pancake mix instead of bisquick (couldn't tell the difference) and used 1 cup of that.  Added another egg.  Also added sprinkle of ground mustard powder.  Took this to my MOPS group and there was only enough left for me for lunch.  I will make this again...thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe.  We're trying to watch calories and fat, but we still love dishes like this.  Not having the traditional pie crust helps cut down on the good-tasting but bad-for-you crust.  I did not have ham in the refrigerator, so I used some real bacon bits (but not too many).

We didn't really care for this.  I thought it was a bit salty.  My husband only ate one piece, but had seconds of everything else, so thats not a good sign.  I will stick with my usual egg bake recipe instead.

I've made this twice now.  First time with fresh tomatoes and bacon and the second time with ham.  Great recipe that you can alter depending on what you have on hand including the cheese.  It's great as leftovers too.  Next time I will grate my own cheese.

My husband loved this! He had it the next day for lunch...it reheated great. It is a little too cheezy for me. I will make it again, but next time I will cut the cheese down. I also added roasted red peppers to add a little more flavor and substituted bacon for the ham. Very good!

We really liked this recipe - it was so easy to make and tasted really good. We substituted cooked bacon for ham, just because that's our own personal preference. I also added fresh cracked pepper and a couple shakes of garlic powder. Next time, I'd use fresh steamed broccoli, or maybe try substituting spinach. It's the kind of recipe that's easy to experiment with. The best part is that the biscuit mix and cheese make this yummy golden topping. My husband loved it, and he's not a big quiche eater. We'd definitely make this one again.

More like a frittata, but super yummy and easy. I found it to be a bit greasy, so next time I'll half the cheese and butter. As written it is VERY cheesy.

Great recipe!  The family loved it.  It's easy to make, and we did not miss the crust.  Will make again....and again.
Thanks!

Loved this recipe - my first time making quiche and it was awesome.  I followed the recommendations posted by the other cooks - added 1/2 tsp onion powder; 1/2 tsp garlic powder, used spinach instead of broccoli and used bacon instead of ham.  Loved it!

Just cooked this quiche up.  It was very easy. I used fresh steamed broccoli and the "Biscuit Baking Mix" recipe on this site for the biscuit part of the quiche. (Which I prepared half whole wheat & half white flour.) I also used a casserole dish (9x13).  That way I could fit everything in with no trouble.

Awesome quiche.  I made one the regular way, then made one with spinach, shredded swiss and mushroom.  It was probably the best.  Had them Christmas brunch and New Years brunch.  Everyone raved and kept going back for more.  This is definately on my menu list.  I'll even make it for dinner some night.
I did add some dried onions and it was really good, especially in the spinach one.

Just DELICIOUS!  I used a bit less Bisquick and cheese, and a bit more ham.  Couldn't ask for a yummier breakfast.  I'll try this with sauteed mushrooms, too!

Fast, yummy and healthy too!  Used Heart Healthy Bisquick and for the veggies used leftover cooked cauliflower and frozen spinach.  Hubby loved it.

I made this for a brunch and it was the hit of the party. SO delicious! I took the advice of a few other reviewers and added some chopped red onion (sauteed), red pepper and some turkey bacon. I also used spinach instead of broccoli. I will definitely be making this again.

This is my first at eating and making quiche and it is delicious. Easy to make and the whole family loved it. Followed the recipe pretty closly i only added a little chopped onions. Cooked it in 2 pie plates and it is great to eat for brunch. Great way to get your broccoli.

Very good and easy. Used spinach and a mix of cheeses (gruyere, fontina and cheddar) and cut  down on the butter a little. Also, it was done after 40 minutes.

Part of what I love about this recipe is that it only uses 4 eggs but has a true quiche taste.  It's easy to make and always a hit.  I add a little onion, other than that, I don't change a thing.

I made this recipe for the first time for guests, and it turned out well.  I used a package of fresh spinach.  The quiche would probably have turned out better if I had steamed or wilted the fresh spinach first.  The quiche was a bit watery, but still delicious!

Because of a lack of ingredients I didn't put in any ham or broccoli and I used Monterey Jack cheese instead of Parmesan, and it still came out delicious and cheesy.

I made this recipe to sell as a "snack" at a rummage sale at my church, and it was a huge hit!  I had to go to the store twice to get more supplies to bake even more.  It is still really good luke-warm or almost cold, so it's possible to make them in advance if you have to!

This was my first quiche.  I put artichoke hearts, button mushrooms, and half a packet of onion soup mix in mine.  It came out alright but it wasn't fluffy enough for me.  Next time I will try adding an extra egg.  There wasn't really a crust either, but I was pleased that the quiche came out of the pan easily.  I baked it in a fluted pie plate. Finally, it needed way less than fifty minutes, so keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't burn.

I add two more eggs (to firm it up a little).  I bake it in a 9x11 glass dish and only put broc on half.  This way my kids will eat it.

OMG! It was so good, I put in Turkey Bacon instead of the ham because we don't eat pork and it was so good! My little sister, the critic, went back for more, and my dad who used to work in food and beverage did too! He doesn't go for seconds unless it  is really good. You can't screw this recipe up!

This is great.  Both my kids (2 & 4) and the neighbor girl had large helpings.  I found it to be a nice, warm, easy-to-prepare comfort food.  I added pepper and used mozzarella cheese instead of parmesan.  Mmmmmmm.

Very Yummy.  Very Easy!  I brought this to 2 brunches and received rave reviews both times.  I used sausage/spinich and crab/mushrooms instead of ham/broccoli, and they turned out excellent.

This was great! Made exactly as recipe stated but added a little onion, garlic powder,and some dry mustard. I used my 10"   quiche pan that i never use. It came out perfect. Also I cooked it 5 min less, so keep an eye on it. Thanks Michele!

Use a bit less milk, and a baking stone if you have one...it makes the crust much more "crusty"!  I used spinach, bacon and seasonings, and it was wonderful.  Can't mess this one up!

Excellent, easy recipe.  Very versatile too.  I'd made with spinach/bacon, sausage/mushroom and as the recipe states.  It sets up nicely and tastes great.  Thanks Michele!

This quiche is a wonderful start, but you do need to add more vegetables, or else it'll be too "simple". I sauted some green onions in olive oil, and added mushrooms after 5 minutes. Then I added to the mix.
I divided the recipe in 2, and cooked only 35 mn. Will do it again =)

This was soo easy and came out very nice. But this is really a frittata because there is no crust. But overall a great recipe with good results!!

I add extra ham and a mixture of spinach and broccoli. This makes a fantastic supper that even the children will eat.

I thought this was very good and extremely easy to make!  Thanks for the recipe!  I made mine without the ham and it was still delicious.

Yummy! And, as easy as it sounds! I made this for a baby shower and received rave reviews. It's a perfect base recipe to which you can add your own favorites -- I added spinach, carmelized onions and mushrooms. This one is going in my favorites file!

Another ditto that this is an easy, delicious quiche.  I made mine in 8 mini pie pans and they turned out beautifully!

Very good and very easy. I used spinach instead of broccoli. I would definitely make this again. I did add some salt and pepper to give it a little more zip!!

This has been one of my favorite recipes for years.  If you don't have a quiche dish, the mix fits nicely into two deep-dish pie crusts.  Be sure to check the crust after about 35 minutes and put a ring of aluminum foil around the edges if they are getting too brown.  We bake both together, then eat one and freeze the other for a night we don't want to cook.  The frozen one is even better than the fresh!

Great recipe.  I made a few changes.  I used already made pie crusts and ended up splitting the batter in two.  ( I had 2 round pyrex baking dishes). I also added half on onion, finely chopped and sautéed. My baking time was reduced to 35 minutes and they still turned out golden brown. thanks michele!!!

If you like a recipe with endless possibilities, this is the one for quiche!  I have made this several times, in a vegetarian form, and with several different types of veggies and meats.  It's great every time.  I love that it is so easy.
