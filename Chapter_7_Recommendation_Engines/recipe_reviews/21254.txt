Easy and delicious! I cut down on the serving size and since I like my cocktail sauce a little more on the hot side and a little less sweet I decreased the amount of sugar to suit my tastes. I would suggest starting off with a small amount and adding in until you find the taste you like.

Delish!! This was so good. I used ketchup and added extra hot sauce. Since I used ketchup instead of the chile sauce I cut down on the sugar.

This would of been a good sauce except for the sugar.  I made it for a dinner party and it was very sweet.  I ended up using bottle cocktail sauce with a little doctoring up.
I would not put in any sugar.

I made this three hours before the luncheon. The ladies loved it and the men felt it needed more kick. Maybe if I had made it earlier, the horseradish would be stronger. Either way, it has be much fresher taste than premade sauce and it was loved by all.

Don't be afraid of the spice. I added lots of extra hot sauce and my whole family loves it!  My wife will not eat shrimp anymore unless I have this to dip it in.  The horseradish is perfect, and the key to this recipe.  FANTASTIC

Good, but I like it "pika"!  A few dashes instead of drops of heat, and  a teaspoon of wasabi give this just the right amount of pop. Never thought I'd like the sugar, though, but it works!

Very hot but expected this based on the ingredients. Good, fresh flavor. Will leave out the hot sauce next time.

Very Good Recipe.  I added a bit more sugar and left out the hot sauce as I like cocktail sauce more on the sweet side.

Loved it!  I had bought chili sauce for another recipe that I ended up not using, and put it to great use here!  Used slightly less horseradish to suit our taste.  Will definitely make again!

I served this at a party with some shrimp.  It was just spicy enough for everyone to enjoy.  I would suggest making half of the recipe.  A little bit goes a long way.

The ingredient list caught my eye until I saw the sugar. Omitted the sugar and it became a 5 star recipe.

I don't eat shrimp but I made this for hubby. Based on previous reviews, I added one drop of hot sauce only. Hubby liked this but didn't act like this was all that special. Thanks for the post!

We don't like spicy, so I left out the horse radish. Easy and better than going back to the store!

Very easy and tasty.  I even used catsup instead of chili sauce since I did not have it and it still tasted great!

This was really good.  I scaled down the recipe quite a bit, and I did not have any lemon juice and I forgot to add the hot sauce but it was still really good.  Thanks for sharing!:)
