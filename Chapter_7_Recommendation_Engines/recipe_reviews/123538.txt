I did use olive oil insead of butter. I also didn't baste the fish but spooned the mixture over the fish while broiling. Very tasty; I will definitely use this recipe again!

This was a great recipe. Heart the mixture! well i mixed it up a little and added two tablespoons of lemon juice and one and a half table spoon of soy sauce, and tripled the garlic to serve it with rice and 'lemon asparagus', another recipe i found on here. Loved it! Will definitely use it again.

This will be a repeat here. We all loved it. Followed the recipe except prepared 1 1/2 times the glaze and used all of it while grilling. The salmon flavor shines through the perfectly balanced glaze in the background. Not too sweet or overpowering. Thanks for sharing!

GREAT. Used fillets.  I changed the 2 tablespoons butter for one tablespoon olive oil and one tablespoon butter.    I like it smothered, I used the directions for 8 servings on 1 lb.  Served over white rice.

This is our favorite way to do salmon . I have done this for years, getting it from the large weber cookbook. I use half butter and half olive oil.

Followed others suggestion of using olive oil in lieu of butter.  Soaked salmon in milk for 30 minutes or so before grilling.  Turned out great...our son really loved it!

This was pretty good. The flavors were not very strong, but grilled fish is always good in my book.

Amazing! The sauce was everything I thought it would be! The only thing I added was a teaspoon ketchup and a dash of rosemary. Otherwise, the sauce was sensational!
