Looking at this recipe you would never think it would taste like the classic Sloppy Joe stuff in a can.  Decided to give this a try and surprisingly, it wound up being delicious and very very close to the classic, only better!  Husband thought the taste was better then the can and he preferred the consistency as well (must be the fresh onions and such).  Never would I have guessed Taco seasoning was a good idea.  I did think it was a tad bit sweet so next time I may only use 1/2 the sugar.  Husband decided he liked it so much that a hot dog wasn't a big enough vessel.  Instead, he "slopped" it on a bun like the usual Sloppy Joe stuff and ate it for lunch and dinner.  The only change I did make was to leave celery out since I can't stand the taste of it.  Yum!

I may be making this every time I serve hot dogs - we enjoyed it that much! Really added a nice flavor to the hot dog. Skipped the celery but added one packet of Sazon Goya Con Culantro Y Achiote.
