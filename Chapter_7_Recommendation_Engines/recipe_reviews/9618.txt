I will give this 5 stars even though, as stated before, it needs some tweeking.  Not super sweet, that is where the jam comes into play so take that into consideration when selecting your filling, which really makes them good.  I followed the directions to the tee BUT increased the second baking time to 15 minutes which makes a big differance.  I didn't raise the temp as this cookie needs to cook slow so the jam doesn't get out of control.  It is skimpy so quadrupling it is my suggestion.  A great christmas cookie.  I didn't need to chill the dough at all. This will remain a Christmas regular.

I made these, but changed two things:
1) I didn't roll them in walnuts, but opted for sugar.
2) I made them miniature sized.
I loved how they turned out!  I will be making these again...and again...and again!

Normally I wouldn't leave a 5-star review for something I had to tweak, but this cookie is SO worth it! I got 3 bakers dozen from this recipe, measuring my dough about 2 tsp per cookie. 

USE BUTTER. I cannot stress this enough. This is a shortbread cookie. It is not sweet, it will not spread, it will crumble slightly if cooked properly. Also, cream vanilla into butter/sugar/yolk. Most bakers already know to mix their wet, then mix the dry in a separate bowl and add to wet, but a novice baker might not.

CHILL FINISHED DOUGH before shaping into balls. 

ALLOW COOKIE BALLS TO WARM to room temperature before pressing your fingerprint. Cold dough will crack and make your cookie brittle.

FILL BEFORE BAKING. After cooking for 5 min, my cookies had a crust that broke and left a brittle cookie with ugly bare streaks. When I pre-filled, the cookies were smoother, but had no coating because my daughter needed a nice looking batch for her bf. I will test this again with black sesame for good photo contrast and because it's yummy. :)

BAKE FOR 15 MIN AT 300. I also lined my pan with ungreased foil, it makes it easier to move to cooling rack and keeps the bottom from burning.

COOL THOROUGHLY BEFORE TOUCHING. The filling is HOT. YOU WILL GET BURNED. And it's just not fun to run to the sink with jam hardening onto your skin.

These would be a great project for kids over 3 to help with. Just make sure they don't poke through the bottom!

These were very good.  I changed them up just a little, because I wanted the kind with icing in the "thumbprint" rather than jam (nostalgic for cookies Grandma made when I was a little girl).  Then, I realized I like the cookie better with more even distribution of the icing, so the next batch didn't get "thumbprints" at all -- I just drizzled the icing over the little cookie balls.  These were one of the best-liked cookies on my holiday trays.

The only changes I made were as other members suggested: I baked 15 mins longer and didn't turn oven temp. up as jam needs time to set, I used a sweet jam - Smuckers Rasberry Jam, I used a sandwich baggie filled with jam and cut a small hole in corner to fill the thumbprint (my thumb is small so I presses deeper bigger dents because I love LOTS of jam - I pressed too hard and some of the cookies stuck to the pan). This recipe is a perfect amount for 2 people homes like mine. These cookies are exacty the way I remember them!!  Thank you C. Keith for this classic cookie recipe!

very good recipe, i changed it up a little though. I added 1/2 cup sugar, and put crushed pecans in the cookie dough instead of the outside. I also baked them for 17 minutes at 350deg. They came out perfectly crunchy

I make these cookies every year because my children and their spouses love them. I find them to be a lot of work; chopping the nuts up fine; rolling the dough in balls, then dipping them in egg whites then nuts. I triple the recipe because my oldest son can wipe out a batch just by himself. I use almond extract in lieu of vanilla, and I use the bottom of a wooden spoon to indent the cookies, then, I redent them after I remove them from the oven. I have never tried putting the jelly in prior to baking; perhaps I will give it a try this year. Also, I use blackberry; grape; and strawberry jelly. Apple hasn't been as well received when I've used it. These are not my favorite cookies because I think they're more trouble than they are worth, but I only make them once a year and my family so loves them, and that is what Christmas is all about, family and love.

The only thing I do differently is, I bake these at 350 for 10 min's or until light brown on the bottoms. I then cool to a wire rack and freeze until ready for the holiday. I then fill when I'm serving. Great cookie!

I made these cookies for my family and I swear they didn't even make it 5 minutes and they were gone. They were perfect! Flaky and tender and sweet, I will definitely make these again! Oh, also I substituted the walnuts with almonds and pecans and used apricot white-cherry jam, mmm...now I'm hungry...better make some more!

Just finished making these delicious cookies.  The only change made was the baking time.  I followed other reviews and baked another 15min instead of 8min.  Also, if you put jam in a plastic sandwich bag and cut a small hole in a corner, it'll be much easier to squeeze the jam out of it and not messy as using a spoon.

very good.  I used strawberry jelly and I had to bake them a little longer but I think they are a good Christmas cookie and very easy.  

I used my "easy accent decorator" from Pampered Chef to fill in the jelly and it worked great!

My whole family loves a good thumb-print cookie and I have searched high and low for the perfect recipe...I found it here.  The only problem is that now this is the only type of cookie anyone ever wants me to make.  I have a whole recipe book full of other good cookies that is collecting dust now...oh well, this is a truly perfect recipe.  I am going to experiement with various jam flavors and see if I can find a substitue as tasty as the regular jam (I'm thinking cranberry jelly might be good).  Thanks a lot for giving making me a baking-hero to my family=:)

I took these took a holiday party and the host hid them from the other guests! This recipe is pure genius. I find that I need more nuts when rolling the cookies so be preparred. I bake for 8 minutes, take out and use a spoon to make my indent, fill with preserves and bake for another 8 minutes. They come out perfect every time.

I'm changing the rating from 3 to 4. These cookies tasted better the next day and didn't taste undercooked like the day before. I baked them until they weren't 'glossy' (about 12-15 minutes at 300 deg F), and I also ended up using 3X the amount called for nuts. These cookies have a wonderful flavour and melt in your mouth. This is going into my keeper file. Thanks for sharing, C. Keith!

Oh yeah, these are THE BEST thumbprints I have ever had...EVER! I originally chose this recipe because it only made a small amount and that was what I was looking for, but I never thought that they would turn out this perfect and delicious. I used butter and baked them on parchment  paper. My oven is super hot, so I did the 'first bake' for 3 minutes, removed them, indented and filled them and did the 'second bake' for 5 minutes and they came out perfect for me that way. These are so tender, buttery and flavorful with just the right amount of sweetness. I filled them with strawberry preserves this time, because that's all I had, but next time I will do a variety. This is definately my new 'go to' thumbprint recipe~YUM, YUM, YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great recipe!  Increased baking temp to 350 degrees for the second bake time.  Also, didn't use walnuts or egg whites, and rolled the cookies in sugar before baking.

These were very good.  I followed the recipe exactly with no problems.  They are very pretty and festive looking for holiday platters. I went the simple route with plain old Smuckers Strawberry jam.

I've made this recipe many times and everyone loves them. I follow the recipe exactly and have had no problems.  These are more of a shortbread cookie than a sweet cookie, that is what we like about them. I have so many cookie recipes it's nice to have one that isn't the sweetest cookie. I include these on holidays with my beautiful Italian butter cookies which are dipped in chocolate & have jelly in the middle & everyone loves that some are sweet & some are not. These beautiful cookies fit right in with our celebrations. We love them. Thanks for a great recipe.

I've made these twice now. The first time I made the recipe as written. There were some issues with the wetness, the cooking time/ temperature and I didn't care for the molasses flavor of the brown sugar in a shortbread cookie. The second time I made them I made a few modifications: I used only 6 tbls of margarine instead of 8, I substituted white sugar for brown and I used almonds instead of walnuts. Reducing the fat in the recipe helped the dough be less wet. I baked the cookies at 325° (up from 300) which helped them bake a little firmer and get a little bit of color. I baked for 8 minutes then put in the indentation and jam then baked another 6 minutes. This only made 9 cookies using ay 2 tbl portioner. The flavor was good and I will probably  make these again using my adjustments.

These are very good! I used almonds instead of walnuts and a couple of different jams. Love the texture of these delicate, not too crunchy cookies. I doubled the recipe, but next time will make even more. These are going to show up in my cookie exchange assortment every year now. My friends and family love them!

I'm usually a little liberal with rating my recipes, as I try to account for variations in individuals' tastes. I tried to give this recipe a 4, as there were so many positive reviews... but I just couldn't. I noticed that most of the good reviews had alterations added to the recipe... but to me, if I have to alter the original recipe to give it a 5 star rating, then it doesn't 'deserve' it. (but that's just me)  I have been baking for the better part of 40 yrs., so it's not that I'm inexperienced. Also, cookies are one of my "specialties" ... but this recipe needs some improvement. I agree with several other reviewers that there simply was not nearly enough walnuts! The dough is very sticky & is actually difficult to roll in to a ball without adding some flour to your hands. I did consider that my butter may have been a tad too soft, so I refrigerated the dough with little improvement. Mine also were too soft to make a good indentation in the cookie, after the 5 min. suggested baking time... plus needed a longer total baking time, as well. I used Amish cherry preserves, which held up well & were delicious! On the positive side, they did have a rich, buttery flavor & I think that with some of the suggested "tweaking", this could be a very good cookie recipe, indeed! I may give it another try around the holidays and see.

I put the thumbprint in the dough as opposed to taking it out of the oven and doing it.  Much easier that way.

Great recipe!  After making these a few times I tinkered with the recipe a bit.  One time I left off the walnuts and instead of jam, I placed a chocolate kiss in the thumbprint.  It was pretty yummy.

This is an awesome cookie.  My family ate them up as fast as they cooled.  I used marionberry jam for the filling.  I also made a double recipe but from now on I will quad the recipe.  I did not have walnuts but I had pecans.  It just made them better, if that is possible.

I live at a high altitude, and I found the dough to be too crumbly to hold together.  I added an extra egg (with the white), and it worked great.  I also extended the baking time per the other reviews, and found that to be helpful.  Delicious cookies!

This tasted great, but I could not get it to cook all the way!  I added 5 minutes onto the cooking time and it was still a raw texture.  Not sure how much extra time would be needed.

I think perhaps the temperature is wrong. Mine were not cooking at 300 so I bumped it up to 350 and they did much better. They are very yummy though!

I make these cookies every year but this year did not put them in the white of egg.  It is messy to do and there usually isnt enough of the white....skipped the white and just did the nuts and some skipped the white and nuts....very good recipe....dont pile on top of each other if u put in the jam after baking like i do.

I bake these at 375 for 5 minutes, take them out make the indent, bake them again for 8 more minutes and then after they've cooled, I fill them with powder-sugar frosting (red and green for Christmas).  They are a huge hit at my house!

These turned out well, but if you didn't get a good bite of jelly, they weren't sweet enough.  I would probably add 1/4 cup sugar to the nuts and roll the cookies in that mixture, that way you are adding sweetness without altering the dough recipe.

The cookies looked very pretty but the taste was not what we expected maybe due to my choice of filling. I used lemon pie filling on half and milk chocolate chips{melted)
 on the other. I thought these would add some sweetness since the cookie dough is not very sweet. The cookie was not very sweet and kinda doughy tasting. It was not bad but just not very outstanding in taste either. Also I had to cook longer about 13 minutes on second baking. I doubled the batch and only got 35 cookies.

Wow! Although I can't stand that moronic recipe buddy, these cookies are worth having to deal with him. I am frantically pawning them off on visitors so I don't eat the whole tray. I had to bake them a bit longer than the recipe said.

I had this type of cookie once at a friends house and could never find the recipe that made them so perfect! Now I have! Thank you! I made them last night and my family (husband and 3 kids) and I ate them all up! Today I made a double batch because my husband was hoping to bring some to share at work because he loved them SO much! I used apricot butter from the local fruit stand for the filling! YUMMY!!

I did something wrong after doubling the recipe and the dough was too dry. I added water to fix. I think I made them too big as well, they needed an additional 15 minutes baking time. All that said, they were fantastic! Just like I remembered as a child. I made them at Christmas time and of all the thumbprint cookies I tried from other family members, everyone agreed that these were the best. I will make them again, and I won't be waiting until next Christmas! Thanks C.Keith

I have these in the oven so I haven't tasted them yet but they look pretty good. Someone posted before me and I will concur, DO NOT COOK THE COOKIES BEFORE YOU MAKE THE THUMBPRINT AND ADD THE  JELLY.  If you precook them, they begin to crack. Do it all in one step.

I made my first batch following the original recipe exactly as written and they were ok. The next batch I made, I doubled the recipe since I bake for a crowd for the holidays ! I also put the "thunmb print" and jam in the cookie right from the start, didn't need to bake for 5 minutes first, and baked them at 325 degrees for 13 minutes. It worked mutch better and the cookies didn't seem as under-cooked as the original ones. My family also are not fans of the nuts so I left them out and the cookies were still very good.

The 300 degree temp is way too low to safely cook cookies with eggs...I cranked the oven to 350 which all other Thumbprint recipes call for.... Not the best cookies to cook with kids as they can burn themselves on he hot pan and cookies (I realized today when made these with y granddaughter!

Good idea but a poor recipe.  The cookie seemed bland to me, plus the dough was too sticky and runny.  First, substitute hazelnuts or slivered almonds for walnuts.  Then add an extra 1/2 cup flour,  1/4 cup coco powder, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/4 cup granulated sugar and remixed it.  After scooping the dough onto the greased cookie tray, spoon cherry jam into the center of the dough balls.  bake for about 15 min.  Dust with powdered sugar to finish.

These were exactly what I was looking for. I baked them at 350 degrees and for 8 minutes the first round and then 10-12 minutes the second round (the listed bake time is too short). Other than that, the recipe is great!

Loved this cookie.  I wanted to go retro with my Christmas cookie trays this year so I needed a good Thumbprint Cookie recipe.  I read all the reviews for this one and everyone said to quadruple it so I did.  The dough was very soft so I did have to add a half cup more flour to be able to work with it.  I also followed the reviewers advice and baked them 8 minutes each time.  They turned out great!  This one is a keeper, retro or not.....

Delicious, but the recipe has some fatal flaws.  The dough is extremely sticky and yo have to handle it with a scooper or two spoons.  Add more flour possibly?  Also, I ran out of walnuts about half way through my cookies.  Double the walnuts.  Also, note the number of cookies this recipe makes in only 12 small cookies.

These were so delicious, yet so easy to make! I used toasted pecans instead of walnuts.  I used the handle of a knife to make the thumbprints so as not to burn my thumb in the hot dough.  I took an earlier poster's recommendation and put the jam in a ziploc bag with a corner cut off so I could pipe it in, and that worked very well.

Delicious! When I couldn't find my the original recipe I'd been making since childhood, I found this one...pretty close. I raised the temp to 350, made my thumbprints before baking (12-15 min) and added the jelly without a second trip to the oven. Perfecto! just as I remember! Thanks!

If you roll in sugar instead of walnuts, don't use the egg white.  The one I did without egg white (I forgot at first) came out prettier and better than all the rest.  The egg white gave the others a strange crust.  I'm sure it's great with walnuts, though.  Great taste to these cookies!

These came out exactly as expected: delicious, slightly crumbly, and a nice balance between sweet (jam), savory (nuts) and salty.  I made these while away from home when  didn't have my regular recipe and these cookies did not disappoint me.  As always, I substitute half of the all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour, make the well in the cookie before baking, heat my jam/jelly in the microwave and add it to the cookies in the last few minutes of baking (this keeps the jelly soft and runny).

this is a good version of a thumbprint cookie but i did make some of my own alterations. i added a 1/4c extra of brown sugar and a 1/4c of quick oats. i also didn't roll it in the walnuts (since we are not fans of walnuts). the cookie also needed 13 mins extra of baking time after the first 5 mins. other than that delicious!!!

Awesome recipe.  I did increase the time as someone else suggested as my family likes the outside a little crunchy.  A+ for this one.

I am rating the recipie as written and have to rate it1 star.  With all the suggestions - increase temp and baking time and using more nuts -I might give it a 4.  I was hoping for something like Grandma's recipie and this wasn't it.

This is my first review here, but I had to add my rave about this recipe.  I made it just as set out in the recipe.  These are the best cookies of this type I have ever made.  I have actually just finished a second double batch today as the ones I made yesterday are all gone! They are sooooooo good!!

Super easy to make and I am not a baker. The dough was Great to work with. If the directions are followed correctly there should not be any problems.I did not use egg white to roll them in since they were sticky enough, the nuts adhered beautifully. I did however read the reviews and I did increase the oven temp to 350 instead of 300, other than that not other changes. They were incredible !!  Awesome recipe.

Yummy! I altered the recipe slightly: I upped the oven temp to 350 and lowered the bake time. They came out buttery, nutty and delicious! These are some of the best thumbprints I've ever tasted!

yum..yum..yum...just out of the oven and hubby has eaten 4 so far.

I used nuts on only half the cookies, as my kids won't eat them with nuts. I kept some plain and rolled others in sugar. All were good, just depends on taste.
I used raspberry jam, will experiment with this one.
Very skimpy recipe, double or quadruple as others have suggested

I followed this recipe exactly and thought they were great! So yummy that my husband even ate them. Except I did use pecans instead of walnuts. They were quick and easy and I will definately be making them again. I'll probably make these to give to neighbors for Christmas.

ok....here's the honest to goodness bottom line review on these cookies.  I did a trial run because of all the reviews and differences of opinion.  I wanted to get them right.  They have been a long time favorite of mine since childhood and since mom has passed, it's my turn to bring the memories back.  This recipe has a delicious shortbread flavor.  You can use either walnuts or almonds.  I followed the ingredients perfectly....although I prepared more nuts than suggested. It doesn't yield much so if you want at least 3 dozen, ya gotta double or triple the ingredients. Since the cookies DO NOT spread, make them as large or as petite as you prefer and this will obviously affect your yield.  I cooked them at 300 on non-stick aluminum foil.  I refrigerated the dough just a bit. If you chill it too long, it gets really hard just like re-refrigerating a stick of butter.  Once I rolled the balls in the egg white and nuts, I place them on the cookie sheet.  I then used my thumb and made the center hole.  I found that by making the hole after they have cooked for 5 minutes, they cracked on the sides.  Do not go all the way down to the bottom...just enough of a dent to hold the jelly.  I then filled each of the holes with my choice of jelly.  I put the jelly in a zip lock bag; cut the bottom tip off and piped in the jelly.  I baked them at 300 for 13-15 minutes.  All you are looking for is a lightly browned bottom.  This cookie has a buttery, flaky, shortbread texture.

This is, in my opinion, the best thumbprint recipe I've ever found. It was exactly what I was looking for, and I make it year after year now. I usually have to Triple or quadruple the batch to make enough for a gathering, so keep that in mind when making them. Also, to those complaining about the cookies spreading or being too wet, I have experienced this issue too. It's important to keep this dough chilled. After I make the dough I always chill it for around 30 minutes before making my first batch, and then make sure to keep the dough refrigerated in between batches. Occasionally I'll add a little more flour as I go to it as well if it doesn't seem dry enough. Otherwise these thumbprints are perfect! Thank you so much for making this recipe available. I love it.

This is my favorite thumbprint cookie recipe and my go-to for cookie exchanges! I make them exactly as described. The buttery lightness of the cookie balances nicely with the sweetness of the jam. Be careful not to overcook or the bottom will brown too much. Let them continue to cook during cooling instead.

Definitely loved the flavor of brown sugar. I added a little cinnamon in the batter and with the walnuts. I put the batter in the fridge for a few minutes before and after rolling because batter felt too soft. Definitely appreciated reviewer tips: Baked at 325 for 10min then 10 min again after jam. They were moist and held together perfectly.  Yielded 13 cookies. Love that cookie is not too sweet. I used 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon to make an indent and piped preserves into cookie  using small plastic baggies( had 2 flavors). I will use  this recipe whenever I'm in the mood for superior thumbprint cookies  again! Yummy!!

First try at thumbprints and these are 5 stars with just a couple modifications! (4 stars as written). My changes, based on other reviews.
*Fill the thumbprints prior to baking.
*Bake at 300 for 15 minutes. 
I'd reduce the salt a little next time. Also, I was in a hurry, and didn't do the egg white (just rolled them in the nuts) and it worked fine. As written, it made 15 cookies with my regular cookie scoop.

Because others' review of this recipe not being very sweet scared me, I added 1/4 cup of white sugar.  I thought they turned out great!  Someone else said the baking time wasn't right, so I did this: 350 degree oven, after 7 minutes, I put the indentation and jam into the cookie.  Then I baked it for 10 more minutes.  Perfect!

Love these cookies! I'm not a very good cookie baker so these were easy and turned out great. The only change I had to make was the timing and the temperature. I cooked them at 325° for five minutes, took them out , filled them and then cooked them for another 13 minutes.

I cooked them exactly as written abd I had great results. I also did a variation where I rolled in sugar instead of nuts and I put the thumbprint and jam in before baking so jam could cook longer and become sticky and it still came out great! I used raspberry, strawberry and grape jam. All were delicious and next I am trying apricot. YUMMY!!!??

These are soooooo good! I make them every few weeks, I double the recipe and they're gone in less than a day. Cooking does take much longer, at least 25 minutes in total. This is what I do for double recipe: I grind 1 cup of walnuts, add half a cup of almond meal, then use half of it for rolling and add the other half to the dough (taking half a cup of flower out). I don't make very small cooking, because I like to use round measuring spoon instead of my thumb (1. Tsp size), this way I don't burn my finger and prints come out uniform, then use the same spoon to fill up the cookies. Yuuuuum! I think I'll be making them today

if dough is stickier than expected, don't add more flour to it. didn't try rolling it in walnuts: do u really need all of the egg whites? try with peanut butter next time if too sweet. really good if u have extras (easily puts away in freezer to take out at another time to put jam on and eat). cost: 2$ jar of jam (you only use 1/4 cup not even)

I made these cookies last night and the next day I immediately had to make more because when I woke up in the morning my siblings had devoured them. I didn't use nuts or egg whites and instead just rolled them in sugar before baking. The cookies turned out great but I did have to add two extra minutes to the baking time. I would recommend double or triple the recipe, but otherwise it was great, really simple.

I got rave reviews the first time I made these... The second time, not so much and the depth of flavor wasn't quite there. I finally realized what I did, I had read the directions incorrectly the first time and added finely chopped walnuts into the dough PLUS rolled them in nuts as well. Nuts in the batter made it amazing!

I like these very much...finally a cookie that is NOT loaded with sugar. I did increase the heat to 325 and kept them for 15 min on 2nd baking, to brown up bottoms more. Will make again.

these cookies turned out very good.  I baked on convec at 300 for 10 minutes and instead of nuts (due to alergies) I rolled in coconut......they were very yummy!

Thank you so much,  I've tried other thumbprint recipes and they have never turned out for me.  Thumbprints were the first cookie I could not conquer in all my cookie recipes.  Then I found your's and they were PERFECT the first time.  My boyfriend is away on deployment and will be so surprised to find these in his box.  Happy Holiday's Y'all!

Exactly what I was looking for. The only thing I changed is I rolled in white sugar instead of walnuts as I had none. I used strawberry jam and they were perfect. Thanks for sharing!

I used a 350 degree oven and rolled batter in raw course sugar and indented prior to baking.  Baked for 10 minutes, added jam and baked additional 5 minutes.  Recipe made 18 nice size cookies.  Took them to a meeting and came home with a clean plate.  Excellent recipe.  And I was asked for the recipe.

Soooo Goood! I substituted the walnuts for almonds and cooked them a bit longer at a higher temp.  They just didn't seem ready when I followed the recipe instructions. But, these are so easy and I will definitely make these again.

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Made the cookie twice and both times it spread very thin.  The crumbles were tasty too bad it wasn't much of a cookie.  If someone has a suggestion, please let me know.  I'd like to rate it higher.  Maybe too much butter?

Yummy!  I have always loved eating these and now I can make them!  I would definitely bake these for at least 15 minutes after adding preserves.  I chopped up pecans in a pulsing blender.  I needed twice as much nuts as recommended, but I like them to be fully covered with lots of nuts.  I am excited to finally be able to make these classic cookies on my own!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I could not find my original recipe for these cookies.  However, these seemd pretty close.  The only thing different I did was to up the temp to 350 and put the thumbprint in BEFORE I baked them.  Then, baked them for 8 mins.  When I removed them from the oven, I put the jam in them and then let them cool.  They look SO much prettier than when you bake the jam.  Plus, the jam doesn't go all over the place. I made these with homemade raspberry jam.  Delicious!

Good flavor in the cookies, but the cook time is way off and the yield is a little off too. (unless you make tiny cookies) I quadroupled the batch for holiday baking and I got about 38 cookies using a small disher so I know the cookies were equally sized. Also, I cooked them for 8 minutes, put my thumb print in, then for another 20 minutes and they came out well. Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutly LOVED these cookies!!! I made half of them strawberry and half of them apricot. The apricot was my favorite. Also i rolled some of them in pecans intsead and that turned out very good. I am going to make these for a Christmas party this year. I do agree with some of the other reveiws that this does need to be quadrupled.  The original recipe didn't make quite enough. But overall a VERY good cookie.

My mom and I used to make these every year at Christmas time.  This recipe is very close to the one we used to use.  A few tips to make them really good: chop the walnuts coarsely, make the balls on the small side, bake for six minutes then pull them out and push indent in them, then bake for 4 more minutes (at 350).  Use a jam or preserve that is tangy and tart, as that what give the cookie it's awesome flavor.  The dough is not meant to be too tasty on it's own. Follow these things, and you will have a tasty treat!

These are just okay..... I did as someone else suggested and added the nuts to the dough instead of rolling in the egg & nuts..... not sure if I like it this way or not but it made them more palatable to my children.  Also, I made 1/2 with strawberry jam (delicious!) and 1/2 with blueberry jam, but the blueberry ran slightly when they baked so they don't look as pretty.  Overall still pretty good, but very small recipe; made 14 cookies

These were and are fabulous!!  Little nutty balls of buttery goodness.  I found that I needed way more than 1/4 cup chopped walnuts.  Maybe mine just stuck more but I used close to a cup.  And I increased the second baking time to 10 min.  Perfecto!

terribly frustrating!  The dough needs to be chilled before rolling into balls, the flavor was not sweet enough, the cooking time was longer than stated and the cookie falls apart.  awful

Very good and easy but the recipe needs to be tweaked a bit.  First of all, they are delicious and 2 dozen is not enough.  I would double or quadruple it.  A quarter cup of diced walnuts ran out on the first dozen so double that too.  I haven't figured out how to cook them long enough yet - I ended up adding 8 minutes to the cooking time and they are still underdone; I will consider cooking them at 350 degrees (as another person suggested) next time.  I used Raspberry Peach Champagne Jam from Stonewall Kitchen and they are delicious.

I followed the recipe perfectly and they were wonderful!  I used seedless strawberry jam after a while i ran out of nuts to roll them in so i just cooked them plain and even those were delicious!!!

This recipe turned out tasty cookies which my boyfriend, his daughter and his mother all enjoyed. I substituted almond extract for vanilla and almond pieces for the walnut and used seeded raspberry jelly for the center. I measured correctly, but had to increase the flour to get the dough firm enough to make balls. The recipe wasn't nearly enough for 2 dozen like it says it yields, and the nearly 2 dozen cookies that I did make were a little too small for thumbprints, so I made "Fingerprint Cookies". The nuts were a bit too much trouble, and I doubt I'll try using any kind again on this type of recipe, but all in all, I think this is a good basic recipe for thumbprint cookies which an adventurous baker can use to try new ideas.

Very nice textured cookie, but make sure your jam is a type that has zip...or could be a little bland.  (I tried with peach and blackberry, the blackberry was better.)  Nice looking cookie on a cookie tray during Christmas!

I remember having these cookies around the holidays, and searched for what I remembered, and this was it!!  The only thing I would recommend, is that you double the recipe!  I made one batch and they were gone in no time!  I sent them to my new in-laws and they called for the recipe!

I upped the oven to 350 and didn’t roll in the egg white.  Fist batch was a total flop but after I adjusted the oven and didn’t roll in the wash they turned out fine.

So delicious! I used pecans instead of walnuts. I had to cook them a LOT longer than the recommended amount. My husband said it is hte best cookie I have ever made! They will get gobbled up quickly, so I triple the recipe! Make sure you use good preserves, that makes a difference.

Dough was *way* too dry. I added just enough heavy cream to make dough workable. 
Maybe my oven, but suggested cooking time was tooo short.
Have to admit that the taste was great, though.

Another good tip - after I finely chop the walnuts in the processor, I mix sugar in the walnuts before I roll the dough in them.  Adds a nice sweetness.  Also I use mainly raspberry and apricot jellies.

I took the advice of previous commenters and chilled the dough before cooking, but otherwise followed the recipe as written, other than quadrupling it. I found the first batch not quite as sweet as I’d like, so I added some sugar to the walnuts and loaded the next batches up with as much jam as they could hold (homemade raspberry/gooseberry/red currant jam). I basically turned them into jam-delivery vehicles.These cookies are dangerous — bite-sized and buttery, with a nice crunch from the walnuts. It was a struggle not to eat each one as I took it off the baking sheet.

I've been making these cookies for at least 60 years!  I always found that rolling in egg white then nuts was a hassle.  So I just add the chopped nuts (we like pecans) to the dough before rolling into balls.  Same great flavor but less work and mess.  My family prefers a simple tinted icing in the center rather than jam.  A must for every Christmas!

i just made these and they are delicious! I did as others recommended and increased the oven temperature to 350 and also baked them for a total of about 19 minutes (5 min, then added jam and baked for an additional 14 min.) They are so good.

I made mini cookies and dipped them in white sugar (followed another suggestion). I also baked them for 12 minutes the second time; they seemed doughy after 8 minutes. I loved the combination of egg white and sugar, adding a meringue topping to the cookie!

Well the oven temperature is either too low or my cookies are too big.  They came out of the oven still raw.  I turned up the oven temperature to 325 and then I felt like they were baked.    A little frustrating but the recipe itself is easy.

A holiday hit last year and will be a repeat for this year as well! We don't like overly sweet desserts and these were just perfect. In fact, I tweaked a bit and added less brown sugar. I also did a mix of crushed walnuts on some and coconut on the rest just to change it up and add variety.

These were perfect. The only thing I did differently is separated one egg and use the yolk in the cookie dough and used the white to roll the cookies in. Still works the same and less waste.  I also made half of my batch rolled in sweetened coconut flakes and they were loved by all!

These are wonderful. Yummy shortcake with jam and not overly sweet like some cookies.  Tastes like my mother-in-law's (Scottish) shortbread.  I made these to use us some of the crabapple jelly I made last summer and they didn't last long at our house.  I've made them 4 times and they come out perfect every time.

I love these and always make at Christmas! They are not supposed to be super sweet as they are more of a shortbread type cookie.  So yummy with a cup of coffee.  The video shows the jam being added prior to cooking, which is how I cook them.  (Recipe states to cook part way before adding jam.) One of my husband's favorites! (If using jam be sure it is seedless)

My family loves these cookies but it takes at least three times as long for them to cook than stated in the receipe. I also have stopped adding the jelly until the last five minutes in an attempt to get them to cook faster. It also makes a lot less cookies than it states. I tripled the receipe and it only made about 32 cookies. Overall an excellent cookie just needs a few minor tweaks.

These are fantastic! Our gas stove always takes longer than the recipe time so after the first 5-minute round I put them back in for another 15 or so. They were nicely done on the outside and tender on the inside, and our homemade blackberry jam finished them off perfectly. I'm DEFINITELY making these again!

These are a family favorite at the holidays. I was thrilled to find the recipe here.  I used a tiny cookie scoop to make the balls.  It also took a little longer on the second baking (12 minutes).

Just made these.  Need much more walnuts.  I doubled recipe, made @ 3 dozen.  I also had to bake about 6-7 minutes longer on second bake.  Used strawberry preserves.  Looked for walnuts to brown before removing from oven.  They do look beautiful and my husband loves them!

As written, this recipe didn't work for me. Based on other reviews, I doubled the recipe and it allowed me to make some changes after the first batch that helped a lot. First of all, I made a mistake by adding the whole egg (without reserving the white, as the instructions indicated). To compensate for this I added an additional 1/4 flour. I didn't have any walnuts to roll the dough balls in, so I put some oatmeal in my food processor along with some brown sugar. I then followed the instructions of rolling the dough balls in egg white and then in the oatmeal/brown sugar mixture and this turned out nicely. I kept the oven temperature at 300 and baked as instructed for five minutes, then removed them, pressed a pocket in the partially baked dough and put in the jam. I returned them to the 300 degree oven and baked for an additional 15 minutes. My first batch failed because an additional cooking time of 8 minutes in a 300 degree oven just isn't long enough. I agree with other reviewers that this is not a sweet cookie without the added jam. I used homemade jam that was made with minimal sugar so mine are even less sweet. I may not make these again because in my opinion, they're not worth the work. They're easy but recipe needs adjustments. If you make it as written, it's a small batch and the cooking time is off.

I don't think the temperature of 300 degrees is hot enough.  I thought the dough was raw and rebaked them for a while at 350.

I lost my decades old thumbprint recipe last year.  Ugh.  I decided to try this one even though I didn't recall mine having brown sugar... These were good and I will use this recipe again.  Here's my variation (that I've been making for a few decades now).  I use ALMOND extract instead of vanilla.  I roll the cookies in ground or finely chopped almonds.  I fill with homemade raspberry freezer jam (with amararetto added to the jam, carrying out the "almond" theme).   Also, I don't know if my old recipe was written improperly but I do NOT fill with jam and continue baking.  I don't want the jam cooked.  I cook the cookie until done, indent a little with the small end of a melon baller and then carefully fill with the delectable jam!  It all sets up fine without baking the jam too.  Hope this inspires someone to try other variations on a great, classic recipe.

Wonderful! Makes a light airy and tasty cookie. I didn’t chill the dough and used coconut instead of wslnuts. Filled them with my Christmas jam made with strawberries and cranberry’s.  Very good recipe but I will make them smaller next time.

This recepy is supper easy and the only thing i did different was add a packet of vanilla pudding to it, this is like a binding ingridient that does not take away flavor but adds just enough and helped my cookies no fall apart. Also i would recommend baking these cookie at 350 not 300 otherwise it would take double the time to cook. Anyhow my family loved them! This recepy is awesome

I have made these cookies every year for the past 3 years and they are always a huge hit! As stated in previous comments they need to cook longer, and also I have friends with nut allergies so I always bake some without the walnuts and they're still amazing.

I used 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar. Baked for an additional 10 minutes after adding the preserves instead of 8 and made 4 batches. Each batch makes only 12-18 cookies depending on how big you roll them out. They turned out amazing!!!!

These came out perfect.  After reading the other reviews I did make one small change I added 1/4 tsp. of baking powder, this solved the problem of them coming out flat.  They puffed up nice and the taste is perfect not to sweet .  They are a hit. Now the only problem is I hope to have enough to freeze for the Holiday everyone is eating them as they come out of the oven.

I would make these again....was a little messy with the egg whites dropping into the walnut mix....the jam I used was homemade & not so dense so I just left the cookies a little longer in the oven after it was turned off...L Wojick , Thunder Bay, On

Don't bother - the recipe makes "maybe" 12 cookies and this recipe does not work - the baking temp is too low and they remained gooey  - a waste of ingredients.

Such a simple yet delicious recipe! These remind me of a richer Mexican wedding cookie with delicious jam. I did the second bake at 15mins as many have recommended and it was just right. I also used almonds that I had on hand and they were great. Looking forward to trying these again with different variations on jam and nuts.

I subbed whole wheat flour for the flour. These came out crumbly to hell (Doesn’t mean they weren’t yummy!)

I tried both peach and apricot fillings. I’d easily recommend peach over apricot.

I made a batch of these for dessert at the assisted living facility where I work. I did make some of the commented changes. I replaced nuts with sugar because we have some with nut allergies. And I used some leftover frosting for the middle rather than the jam! But this is a very good cookie. It’s soft and chewy and very good flavor and texture. The 34 residents I cook for loved them as well!!!

My family loved it !

It’s their new favorite cookie.   I added boysenberry jam in the center and they’ve been begging me to make more, only thing is I doubled the recipe because it didn’t make enough.

I had to rate this recipe lower because I feel like I wasted my time and money by setting the oven to 300 degrees and cooking for the time mentioned. My cookies  were raw and I had to throw out the entire batch. They looked fine until I bit into one. This needs to be at least 350 degrees. I'll try again at the correct temp when I'm less angry :(. Lesson learned: read the reviews before you try.

I gave them a 4 because I haven't tried them yet but they look great. Just keep in mind that this recipe will not give you a lot of cookies as I only got 14. I did 2 tsp per cookie, and used my index finger to make the indent. I also pre filled the jelly as someone suggested and baked for 15 min. I'm sure they will taste as good as they looked

Since my kids are not fans of nuts with cookies, I omitted the walnuts.  I, instead, rolled the cookies in "Sugar in the Raw" to give it some additional character in the absence of the nuts.  They turned out great.  It was a nice colorful addition to my Christmas cookie tray.

Had no choice but to give a 1 star rating because 0 stars is not an option.   I lost my origina recipe for thumbprint cookies and looking at the pictue these ones looked exactly as the ones I used to make.  Everything went well until I had to bake them.  Temperature on recipe too low.  Brough it up to 350 and still came out under cooked and flat as a pancake.

My mother made these cookies every Christmas, using 1/2 Maraschino cherry in the thumbprint (except for the years when Maraschino cherries were banned b/c of red dye #7;  no longer an issue).  The bright red makes them very festive looking.  I didn't have her recipe with me but this one seems very similar.   I baked them for about 7 minutes longer than the stated time.  The recipe says "12 servings", which means about 1-1/3 cookie for 12 people.  Double the recipe at least for a plentiful amount.

It's a shortbread -  not sugar - cookie, thus it's not too sweet & it is crumbly.   I don't understand putting icing on these cookies, but then again, Maraschino cherries probably sounds awful to many.

I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and mixed the nuts into the batter. These were good but not quite what I was looking for. They didn’t stay together well and I did both putting jelly in first and then next batch put jelly in after baking for 5 minutes. I will have to tweet this recipe a little to get what I am looking for. Good start though.

Please do NOT add more sugar (as some reviewers have suggested).  I made this recipe as written, and trust me, you do not need more sugar than the original recipe - it's very rich, and plenty sweet enough.  Actually, the first time I made it, there was a fair bit of butter bubbling out from the cookies onto the parchment paper, so the second time I made it, I cut the butter a bit, and it turned out nicely (I had doubled all of the ingredients, so it was supposed to be 1 cup of butter, and I took it down to a shade over 3/4).  I didn't cream the butter - I melted it so that if you pop the cookies into shape quickly, they still hold fine (no need to chill the dough, as the batter is less soupy due to less butter), and it's a wee bit healthier.  The slightly reduced butter version is what I'm sticking with, because it reminds me of the ones my grandma made.

I made these and although they are good I gave it one less star because they need a lot longer in the oven than the recipe says. Mine ended up having to be in an extra 7 or 8 minutes on the end bake but I didn't discover that until my final batch went in the oven so it was too late for the first 2 batches. (I tripled the recipe) I also did a variation rolling a batch in toasted coconut and then putting a Hershey Kiss in the middle.

This recipe is great, however the cooking instructions are not. I cooked them as directed and it was raw and fell apart. I increased the oven temp to 325 degrees, made the dent in the cookie before baking. Baked for 8 minutes and again dented and finished baking for 12 minutes. they came out perfectly golden brown and crispy. Instead of jam, I filled them with chocolate ganache.

Excellent recipe and a great thing to make for people dropping in, since it contains ingredients most have in the kitchen.  Recipe also works well without nuts if you're baking for someone with a nut allergy.

These were a huge hit with everyone!  The cookie itself is so light and buttery/savory.  It's not overly sweet, which most seemed to appreciate.  I made an 'apple pie' variation of these for a themed cookie exchange, filling it with chopped up canned apple pie filling instead of jam and mixed just a little cinnamon in the chopped walnuts.

Like others, I baked higher and longer - at 325 for 16-20 minutes.  I filled them at the beginning instead of taking them out in the middle of baking.  I tried both ways, and it didn't make a difference,  so I kept it simple.  I also used someone's suggestion of letting the individual dough balls  come back to room temperature before indenting, and that kept them from cracking.  I used the back of a round 1/2 tablespoon to press the indentations, and that also kept them neat.

In response to other comments concerning sweetness, I thought the cookies were perfect.  The cookie is light and with the walnuts and filling a perfect balance.  

I will definitely make these again!

These are incredible but we ended up baking them a bit longer. 8 mins in the beginning, then thumbprint, plus jam and then 12 more mins. These were made in a new gas Kitchen Aid oven/range with accurate heat and they came out great!

Definitely needs 15 more mins baking time.  Used organic raspberry jam and spelt flour.  Very yummy!

Since these are my favorite cookie I tripled the recipe and I used icing rather than jam. Other than that I followed the cookie recipe exactly and they were perfect. Thanks

Changes?  Yeah... cooking them forever so that they at least looked cooked.  I couldn't find my original recipe, so searched and found this one. The picture looked exactly the same, so thought this must be it. I never looked it over util we started to make the cookie dough. This has got to be the first recipe EVER that makes only 1 dozen normal sized cookies!!! And 300 degrees? Also ridiculous.  We eventually turned it up to 350 and then even 375 because they weren't even browning the slightest bit.  Another thing never heard of in the history of making cookies.  I found my recipe.  It's a zillion times better than this one. Oh, and it makes 6 dozen!! I'd be happy to share MY recipe! Besides, I'm thinking this recipe was a joke, and I fell for it.

I had to bake the cookies a fair bit longer. Ended up baking about 18-20 minutes. I ended up quadrupling the recipe but I think tripling it makes ample amounts of cookies. I think it all depends on the size of ball you roll. These were a HUGE hit with our Chemistry Department for Xmas. I made them in Raspberry, Apricot, Cherry, and with a Hershey Kiss center. People asked for the recipe!

I made these thumbprint cookies almost exactly the way the reipe says and they came out delicious and looked perfect. The only change made was to bake them for 10 minutes the second time, and not 8 minutes. The only change i might make next time would be to double the batch. This recipe made 16 cookies when i made 1 inch balls.

Would be 5 stars, but agree with others - upping the bake time in the last step to 15 min is a must and consistently yielded good results. With that change, it's a stellar recipe that I look forward to revising. I rolled half my batch in chopped walnut and half in sanding sugar, and both turned out well. Jam in a baggy with a cut corner worked for filling purposes in a jiffy.

The cookies turned out good.  But the bake time was way off.  I finally ended up baking them at 325.  The first five took them out, put the jam in and then for another ten.

I read some of the other reviews and agree with their adjustments. Double the recipe  and you'll have about 30 cookies, refrigerate batter before forming into balls,  as they are easier to form after chilling.  I also had to double the amount of walnuts needed. I baked each batch about 15 minutes and filled with jelly before baking. Delicious cookies!

These cookies are amazing! The only thing I did different was I used pecans instead of walnuts and I used raspberry Jam in half and Saskatoon Jam in the other half. They are delicate, sweet and oh so delicious! Thank you so much for sharing the recipe. I will make them every Christmas.

these cookies were easy, but didn't stay in balls...melted on the pan.  Not happy.  When I googled it, it says too much sugar when that happens.

So good! I rolled them in pecans because I hate walnuts with a passion unexpressable. I also baked them for a long time, about 45 minutes total, at 300 degrees to get them to the right cookie hardness. Worth it! I'll make these again, but I may experiment with a higher temp to reduce baking time.

This is a fabulous recipe! I doubled the recipe and  made mine with 2 teaspoonsful of batter for each cookie.. This made 4 dozen small cookies which was the perfect size.. I did not take the cookie out and fill in the jelly. I instead dipped in egg white, then in nuts, then made my thumb print, then cooked until the cookie looked cooked .  The cooking time had to be increased to at least 5 - 10 mintues (I just kept checking until cooking looked done and cooked at 325 due to my higher elevation in ABQ NM.) They came out fantastic..  I place the jelly (rasberry) in the cookie before serving..   I plan on freezing some, and serving on as needed basis, but I have the feeling that I may need to make another batch.

Made with butter and added a scant tablespoon of finely chopped fresh rosemary to the dough. I ended up using double the amount of walnuts required. Filled with blackberry jam. And had to bake a little longer then specified. Let cool completely before truing to eat.  

Not too sweet. A perfectly balanced cookie. Will definitely make again. Batch made 23 cookies.

Wonderful cookies! I wish I had walnuts, but since I did not I just rolled them in sugar instead. I used a raspberry jam (warmed in microwave for easier application) and made an orange drizzle (1 cup confectioner sugar mixed with 1 Tb orange juice) for the top after they were done baking. Will make again. Thank you.

I made these exactly as described and they came out perfectly.  They are not super sweet, which is good. They were sweet enough.  Think Russian Teacakes for the level of sweetness.  They were a bit delicate out of the oven but I had no trouble with the cookie falling apart.  I used Bonne Maman Rasperry Preserves for the filling.   The recipe  does not make a lot.  Definitely need to double the recipe for a decent number of cookies.  These will go into my Christmas cookie rotation.

I made a jar  of Zucchini Bread Jam,  I saw the thumbprint cookie recipe and light bulb moment, what a great combo!

The jam is super sweet and the cookie isn't sweet-

I did take the advice to bake longer and they came out great.

I filled mine with CHOCOLATE COFFEE BUTTERCREAM ICING from this site and it was a perfect match!  So Good!!  My guests raved about them and took home the remaining cookies. When I make them next time I will make them smaller - the size I made were about four bites each and I'd rather make them one to two bites next time.   Also, I'm sure they'd be delicious without the nuts.

I made a double batch since we love cookies. The only changes I made were,  I used half whole wheat flour and half regular. Since I had no jam I topped them with cooked dates. They were excellent and I'll make them again for sure.

Best thumbprints I ever had! Will use this recipe from now on! I did triple the recipe and got 45 cookies. You will need more nuts also. At least double the nuts. I also increased the baking time.  I did press them down after 5 minutes but baked for 14 minutes afterwards.  And I used a measuring  teaspoon to press them down. Don't use your thumb! You will get burned!  The rest of the recipe is great! The dough is the most important part and it was light and buttery and crisp. Just right!

These are the best cookies EVER! I made them first for a school bake sale, and my teacher (who didn't know me by name) LOVED THEM, said they were her favorite cookies of the bunch! Since then I have made them a few times, given them to people as gifts, and they are always a hit. This is my go to dessert!!!

My husband said it is his new favorite cookie! I am allergic to nuts, so I supplemented  walnuts with toasted coconut and rasberry preserves as filler. They turned out amazing! We, husband and self, ate almost all cookies in one night!

I liked these a lot - I have made several similar recipes, and what I like about this one is that the cookies are partially baked, filled with jam or jelly, then baked again.  Filling with jam before or after never works out well for me, but these looked nice and I liked the way the jam melted just a bit.  The recipe doesn't state  what size the balls of dough should be, so you can make them large or small, I suppose.  However, I found that rolling them just shy of an inch (think large marble-sized) was perfect.  The cookie itself is not very sweet, and frankly would't taste that great on its own, but with a little bit of cookie and a little jam, they were wonderful.

These have quickly become a holiday favorite in our house. Yes, they are a bit of work but SO worth it. I find them to be light and buttery, and the jam (I use a good raspberry jam) makes them more than sweet enough. The only change made was I prefer pecans to walnuts, otherwise, followed exactly and they turned out perfect. You do have to make sure that they are rolled into very small balls (no more than an inch in diameter), and don't soften your butter too much or they tend to flatten out as they bake. LOVE these!

I had to increase the baking time to 15 minutes, no adjusting the temp though.  Next time I make these, I'll roll the balls half the size then the cooking time should make more sense.  The only changes I made to ingredients was I rolled the balls in Pecan nuts and added a half tsp of almond extract.  Very good!

This recipe is great! I dislike walnuts so I omitted those and rolled it in coconut. The coconut was a great addition. It is a very dry cookie, but everyone loved it. It tastes very similar to scones at the fair.

When the dough was finished mixing, it was way too soft to roll into balls. So, I added a bit of flour and then chilled he dough for about an hour. We rolled the dough into balls easily, then put the cookies in the oven (300 degrees) for 5 minutes. When I took them out to add the thumbprint and jam, the balls were a melted mess of batter. Completely melted:(.

I make these cookies every Christmas and they are really delicious. I usually double the recipe because people start eating them as soon as they are done and out of the oven. I do, however, use pecan meal instead of the chopped walnuts. Much easier to use.

I made these cookies following the recipe exactly and they were perfect!  I used Irish butter instead of traditional butter, and I used black raspberry and strawberry flavored jams for the filling.  These are my new favorite, everyone was raving over them at my cookie baking party.

I doubled the recipie, and still only made about 24 cookies. Maybe I made them too big, although they were the size of a walnut, so not too big, but they were very doughy and took twice as long to bake. Kind of disappointing.

These are tasty.  I made as instructed and they were very good.  The second time I used vanilla and almond extract and used almonds instead of pecans.  Baking in middle rack was an excellent tip.  They over brown on the top rack.

This is the second year in a row I've made these! With or without nuts and with preserves or chocolate. The only thing I changed was the cooking time. I bake for about 6 minutes, fill, then bake for 9 more minutes. I use sugar free preserves or candy melts to fill. I get a lot of requests for these!

Delicious! I like cookies more buttery than sweet, so these suit me perfectly. I follow the recipe but use whole wheat flour, which I prefer, and about double the amount of nuts called for. The first time I did as directed (rolling balls of dough in egg white and nuts) but found the process rather messy. The next time I experimented by mixing some nuts into the dough and dropping it by spoonfuls onto the baking sheet. I then used a small paintbrush to apply the egg white and shape the cookies a bit, then sprinkled the rest of the nuts on top. That worked fine as well. I finish with cream cheese frosting instead of jam. Baking note: My oven doesn't go below 180ºC (a little over 350ºF) and I find the cookies need 12-13 minutes' bake time nonetheless.

These were great. I did chill the dough before rolling them. I also doubled the recipe because it doesn't make many. I did double the cooking time after applying the jelly and still could have used another minute, but they were great. Used strawberry and raspberry jam.

I opted for the 36 cookie recipe. since it called for room temp butter, it did give the cookies a drop batter consistency. I remedied this by altering a few things. to start, I did add whole eggs. I used a cup of sugar and a cup of brown sugar, I also used 4 or 4 1/2 cups flour. I don't remember.  I did chill the dough, but not until after I formed the balls for the first batch.  I put it in for five minutes, then to make the "thumbprint " I sprayed the back of a measuring tablespoon with Pam.  I'm obviously going to get more than 36 cookies, but they are yummy.  I still haven't found the right amount of time for the jelly to set,  I've been using 8 minutes after adding jelly, but I am making bigger cookies. oh, p.s. to roll the first batch I did rub a small amount of crisco on my hands to avoid sticking, but after you chill it while baking, you won't need the crisco again.

I made the recipe exactly as directed.  The cookies were much too big for my taste, and no where near being cooked through in the stated time.

The flavor and texture was very good, though.

They get a little dry, but I really liked they're not that sweet, which is perfectly compensated with the jam filling. Very easy to make too!

Excellent cookie recipe.  I have also omitted the jam and put fill-ins (like pistachio & white chocolate, Callebaut chips and pistachio & white chocolate).  Awesome cookies- not overly sweet.

These were great it makes a nice little snack with tea or coffee. The only changes i made were instead of nuts i put cornflakes on the outside and cooked them for 15 min in total on the same temp and they came out wonderful. Will make over and over. Thanks for the recipe.

These are really simple and delicious! The only thing I did different is I left out the nuts and after I put the jam on it I cooked for 15min. They are perfect. The cookie is not really sweet, but I used the raspberry jam from Trader Joe's & they are perfect. I doubled the recipe and it still wasn't a huge amount. Will make again!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I made as written with the exception of the cooking time.  I, like many others, had to increase the by at least 20 mins. The other thing is that the most number of cookies that I have been able to make with the recipe as is,  is 19 and I did not make them very big.  I am assuming that they are intended to be a lot smaller which may account for the shorter cooking time indicated in the instructions...?

This recipe was wonderful - I did follow it as directed but here are some other variations that were successful.  One tray I rolled in coconut instead of nuts (ran out of nuts) and they turned out well.  I filled some with icing after they were done baking instead of jelly and they turned out well also!  Happy baking.

Recipe is great.  I wish I would have read the reviews first because I had to bake longer than the second 8 minutes.  But I had to figure that out.  And the recipe only makes 12 so you definitely need to double/triple the recipe.  I like the idea of adding sugar to the rolling walnuts.  It is not a sweet cookie.  But they are great cookies and not crumbly at all!

Not a horrible recipe but it only makes about a dozen cookies and not 2 dozen like it says. The middles were a bit undercooked so after the first batch I pressed them down a little before sticking them in the oven. I also used about a cup of chopped walnuts per dozen. These aren't my favorite type of cookies, but I like that they weren't too sweet.

The base of this cookie is just what I was looking for to use up the lemon curd in my fridge. It didn't disappoint! Very soft and the perfect shortbread consistency. They do crumble a little, so eat em in one bite! Not a problem in my book :)

This is great and easy recipe. Had to cook a little longer (2 min), but once they cooled off, they're delicious. My family wants this a holiday tradition.

good recipe! this was the first time i had ever made them.  the only minor problems i had was cook time needed to be a bit longer and the quantity of them.  two dozen???? not even close...my cookies were tiny i am not sure how much smaller i would have to make them to get 2 dozen.  do yourself a favor and double the recipe the first time!

I love these cookies!!! Tried them last year at Christmas, this year my son (5) and I were wanting more. The yolk, butter, and brown sugar are so rich and tasty. 

I roll them in sugar instead of nuts, I actually prefer them with nothing, I like my cookies more buttery than sweet though. 

I find them a little delicate but the mouth feel isn't too dry. 

Remind me of danish butter cookies. YUM!!!

I used white sugar, decreased butter as suggested in a review, did not use egg white, increased flour by 1-2 tablespoons, rolled in almond meal. Delicious with Aldi blackberry fruit spread.

While these did have a nice flavor they were awfully dry.  When we made the cookies we must have made them too large as the quadrupled recipe only made just over 2 dozen cookies.  We also rolled them in pecans as we didn't have any walnuts.  The cookies took over 25 minutes to bake and the jam still hadn't changed consistency.

This is almost the same recipe my mother has used for over 40 years. Her original states shortning instead of butter, we've switched to butter over the years, and to bake at 350 for 7-10 min. I tried it at 300 and liked that I didn't have to have my eyes glued to the oven to prevent burning. We've always filled after baking, this year I'm going to try as writen, exept changing to 96 servings - that will last 1 week in our family.

Love this cookie. I didn't have walnuts so I substituted pecans which were a bit hard to roll the cookie in.  I used raspberry jam which didn't melt as well as I wanted but I will definately put this cookie on my Christmas cookie list!

I gave these away along with several other types of cookies this Christmas and everyone LOVED these the best!   Like others have said though, make sure to put them in the oven for longer than 8 minutes after you've dented them. I put mine in for 15 mins and they came out soft and flaky. Delish!

Four stars as my kids didn't think much of these cookies.  My husband & I thought they were great (not just because the kids didn't eat them all on the same day!) and I will definitely make them again.  Will perhaps sprinkle with a sprinkling of icing sugar next time as the kids didn't think they were sweet enough LOL!

These cookies were a big hit with my husband & myself. I used crushed pecans, and for the filling,I made half with rasberry jam and half with orange marmalade. I wasn't sure about using the marmalade,but it gave them a really good 'twang'. My husband liked them best. He said they reminded him a bit of macaroons,so that got me to thinking I might even try adding a bit of coconut to my next batch. I will definitely be making these cookies again!

So the recipe was very small - only made 2 dozen VERY small cookies. They needed more cook time as well after adding the jam than the recipe said.  I rolled them in finely chopped almonds and aside from being slightly underdone  - they were tasty.

they look amazing! Bake time is longer than the recipe states. I cooked them for 15 min like others stated. They still look a little underdone but i'm going to let them cool a bit and see what happens.

I was looking for a thumbprint cookie that was similar to one my mother used when I was growing up and I found it with this recipe! I make these every year for Christmas with locally made jams. I don’t usually add the walnuts though. I always use a tablespoon to measure my dough and a teaspoon to dent for the filling. You definitely need a good portion of jam in these and a glass of milk as I find they are type of cookie to stick to roof of your mouth. Soooo worth it though

Absolutely Perfect. This is exactly what I wanted. Not too sweet almost like a shortbread YUM! Did it exactly like the directions told me too, only I baked them for 12 minutes after I added the jam. I used Apricot Preserves.  I have also used Lemon Curd which is Heavenly!

I've made these cookies every year since I can remember.  At Christmas, I like to put the red and green candied cherries in the middle, instead of the jam. YUM!

I just finished making these cookies and they are delicious!.My only suggestion will be to bake them a little longer or raise the oven temperature.also keep in mind that you're only getting about 13 cookies from this recipe, so if you need more just double up! Enjoy!
