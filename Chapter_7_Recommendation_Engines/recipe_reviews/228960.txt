Very good and basic recipe...I love a good Asian salad. This was fine. I used up a bunch of mini peppers that I received and the used white corn verses yellow. But it all came together beautifully and was simply stunning with vibrant colors from the veggies.

I made this per recipe and it was great! I kicked it up a notch a second time with pomegranate seeds and bean sprouts.
