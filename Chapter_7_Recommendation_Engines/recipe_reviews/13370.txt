Yum Yum! I had the most incredible soup while on my honeymoon in Rome. Since returning I have craved it and have been disappointed by the American version which resembles Chili with pasta. This recipe is as close as I could find with few minor changes: I omitted the tomato juice and used 1 can of crushed tomatoes instead. I used Great Northern Beans instead of the red beans. I used fresh basil. I used Acini de pepe pasta. I added 1 cup fresh chopped spinach. I also added 2 more cups of chicken broth. Delicious!!

This was very good, but with modifications:  hubby and I love this soup from Olive Garden, so I used 2 lbs. of ground beef instead  of the proscioutto, and I doubled the cayenne and added a couple drops of tabasco sauce for added quick.  Also, I didn't have tomato juice, so I used two cans of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce.  Lastly, I threw in a little brown sugar to carmelize the onions as they were sauteing.  Lastly, top with freshly grated parmesean!  Fabulous!  (I tried the recipe exactly as written the first time, but it was bland, so I couldn't quite give it a full 5 stars).

Delicious!!!  I made a couple of changes, that you might want to try though.  I added a can of crushed tomatoes and a small can of tomato paste to thicken the soup slightly.  But the flavor was not changed one bit.

Excellent recipe!  We ate all the soup in one sitting.  I substituted 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar for the white vinegar, 8 oz tomato sauce for 8 oz of tomato juice, and used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.

I made this recipe for my Italian father -- he loved it and has already shared the recipe with friends.  For storing leftovers, be sure to store the soup and pasta in separate bowls or the pasta will absorb most of the broth.

Followed others advice, used diced tomatoes and a bit of tomato paste.  Added green beans and white beans.  Tripled the garlic and used chopped carrots vs. grated.  Also didnt have enough broth so added water and turned out FAB!!!  Husband and mother-in-law raved.   I impressed myself even.  Thanks for the great soup.

Made several times already. Everyone enjoys this recipe, especially during the winter months! It has been put in the "favorites" file. Thanks Kathy. I  have modified the followng just for preference sake: red onion, lean ground beef instead of prosciutto, 1/2 chicken 1/2 vegtable broth, tomato sauce instead of juice, balsamic instead of white vinegar, and upped the seasonings to taste.

I made this for a potluck at work and everyone really enjoyed it.  I had to add a lot more liquid but it still turned out good.  I had a friend come over to help me finish off leftovers and she couldn't stop yapping about how great it was!

An excellent recipe.  We too substituted the crushed tomatoes for the tomato juice.  One suggestion from my son; perhaps add less pasta next time.  One of those recipes where one can be creative as you wish and add whatever sounds good from the fridge -or- garden ........  we added some sliced zucchini, fresh basil.  Will definely make again.

i make this with minced ham and i put the white beans in the blender (husband doesn't like texture of whole beans). also, to keep the pasta from swelling up and taking over the soup, i cook it separately and add to the soup bowls, not in the whole pot of soup. this is a wonderful recipe. thanks for sharing!

Used bacon instead of prosciutto, fresh herbs instead of dried, threw in some garbanzo beans, added some tomato sauce in addition to the juice, and used whole wheat rotini noodles. I wanted the broth a little thicker so I cooked the noodles in the same pot. This is a really nice basic recipe, endlessly customizable for what you have on hand.

This soup was good.  I followed other reviewers suggestions by chopping the carrot instead of shredding and by adding a large can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice.

I wasn't really fond of the meat used in the recipe, so next time I'll likely use italian sausage.

I froze the leftovers in individual size portions to use for quick lunches.  They reheated very well.

This is a great soup. This has been a favorite each time I've made it. Although, one box of pasta is definitely too much. We only use about 1/3 of the box when we make the full recipe and it turns out perfectly.

This is delicious!!!  It is so easy to make, I just chopped all the vegetables up in my 
mini chopper, including the prosciutto ham.  I used thin noodles, because I couldn't
find the noodles that the recipe called for.  I made this after I came home from 
work and it was so easy, quick and tasty!!! I will be making this over and over again.  
Such great flavor!!! Even my Mother who is 79 and picky loved it and had seconds!
And also my picky husband loved it too!  I can't believe more people haven't tried this
wonderful  soup.  It is number one on my list and  should definately be number 1 on
Allrecipes.com!!!!!

Delicious recipe!  I didn't have prosciutto on hand, so I used lean ground beef instead.  It turned out very good and made A LOT of soup!  I kept the pasta separte from the soup to keep it from getting soggy.  We'll make this one again.

This was great - followed the recipe pretty closely, except for minor changes.  Instead of prosciutto I used 1/4 lb smoked turkey sausage (Hillshire Farms).  Didn't know what ditalini was and didn't have any, so I used some Maltagliati that I had - a very thin spaghetti or fine egg noodle - tossed it with a little olive oil after I cooked and drained it, so it wouldn't stick together.  We ladled the soup into bowls over the pasta, and it was great - great flavor with the turkey sausage I used.  Will definitely make this again.

Excellent soup recipe. I cooked in my crock pot while I was at work and came home to a wonderful aroma. I used a can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of tomato sauce instead of the tomato juice. I also added some fresh baby spinach just a few minutes before serving for added color. Also did not have ditalini pasta (don't really know what that is) so just used small shell pasta. I don't think you need a full box either, seemed like to much pasta for our taste. Otherwise this was so very good and easy, you probably have most everything in your home.

This thick concoction was even good cold, and it kept for quite some time!  Very filling, and excellent after a salad with a good, tangy dressing!

This is one of the best soup recipes I've ever tried!  I made it exactly as the recipe called for and will make it over and over again exactly the same way (though I'm known for changing every recipe I make!).  This was excellent and even my pickiest eaters liked it!  I think the proscuitto is the key to the flavor.  This is a keeper!

I made this for my roommate, and we both loved it. It was a bit too salty for my taste, however, because of the prosciutto.  I'll halve the amount next time, and use reduced sodium chicken broth. As somebody suggested, I used a small can of tomato paste, and also some stewed tomatoes.  It was so easy!  Throw everything in the pot, and leave it to simmer!

I love this soup. Its so nutritous and a great comfort food. I substituted ground turkey meat for prosciutto. It's probablly not as tasty but definitely still delicous, yet a little healthier.

Wanted to use what I had on hand. Used center cut bacon in place of prosciutto and used the fat from the bacon instead of olive oil. Towards the end I brought the soup back up to a boil and added a cup of pasta.

The recipe itself can be improved, so make sure you listen to the reviewers.  I used proscuitto, which is rather expensive, and wish I hadn't since you can't even taste it in the soup.  Would rather have used beef or regular ham or something.  I upped the spices (basil, parsley and cayenne) and was glad I did because it was well seasoned.  I used the tomato juice, but added a can of diced tomatoes as wel.  Good started recipe, but needs modifcation to be good.

This recipe is great on cold night!  I used V8 juice in place of tomato (because thats what I had in house), omitted the cayenne pepper, relpaced beans with canalenni, and used 8 oz of ditalini pasta (1/2 box) in stead of whole 16 oz, which was plenty thick and chunky...watch adding salt to taste is key because all ingredients have plenty of salt already....thanks for great dinner!

I halved this recipe, used white beans instead of red, eliminated the tomato juice and used concentrated crushed tomatoes.  I have tried a few difference recipes from this site and this one called for procuitto.  I used the procuitto but could not really tell a difference in the taste of the soup.  It is a hearty, flavorful soup.

Very good and very filling.  I didn't use the prosciutto.  I added diced tomatos.  Delish.

Yum Yum Yum!!!!  We don't have the Olive Garden here in Germany (we have real authentic Italian food made by real Italians LOL), but I miss the soup/salad at the Olive Garden sooo much!  This recipe was pretty close to what they serve.  I followed the recipe except for the following:
1. I used 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb italian sausage 
2. I substituted tomato sauce with 2 cans diced tomatoes and 1 can tomato sauce

It came out beautifully and we had leftovers for days!

This was one of the best pasta e fagioli's that I have ever had.  The only change I made was that I added white beans in addition to the red beans.

I made this soup tonight and my husband and I rate it four stars. It was a very filling soup--- perfect for diets! It was a bit too spicey for my husband's taste (I did two shakes of the cayenne pepper, but I liked it with kick. THe only other complaint was that it didn't have enough broth for the amount of pasta--- we were left with more pasta at the end than the broth. I would make it again, but just add more stock.

Excellent recipe!  The first time I made this soup I used prosciutto.  The second time I made it, I substituted the prosciutto with ground beef.  Equally as good, and much easier to brown ground beef than chop prosciutto! 
Very filling and completely satisfying.
This soup met with rave reviews at my last party.  Thanks to Kathy for submitting!

Omitted carrots and celery, and substituted fake meat crumbles for the prosciutto. Fresh basil was key! Great soup.

We just didn't enjoy this due to texture. If I followed the recipe exactly, the beans were not cooked through when the rest was ready to eat. If I were to try it again, I would either use canned beans or soak the beans overnight.

Delicious! I didn't use prosciutto, and so I added a couple tsp. beef bouillon. In place of tomato juice I used 2 c. (14.5 oz can) italian style diced tomatoes and 1 cup tomato sauce. As suggested, I only used 1/3 the pasta. Such a wonderful soup!

Mmm.  I really like this soup, and so did the bf!  I did change a few things--didn't have onions or proscuitto, so I just left them out and upped the garlic.  I subbed garbanzo beans for the kidney beans (I know, I know, but I'm out of kidney beans and have tons of garbanzo beans), used sliced carrots instead of grated, and had no tomato juice so I subbed tomato sauce.  Bc of the tomato sauce and the fact that I simmered for about 2 hours, not one, it ended up a really thick soup, almost like a pasta sauce or stew.  If I want it thinner less time I'll either use tomato juice or add some water.  I didn't cook the pasta entirely--letf it a bit underdone so it would be okay in the leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll definitely make this one again!

I loved this soup.  I didn't have prosciutto so I didn't use it.  I substituted 14 oz petite diced tomatoes and 3 T of tomato paste for the tomato juice.  I used a can of cannelini beans.  Everything else I followed.  Heavenly.  Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.  As I took this to a party, I added the pasta right in.  You wouldn't want to let it sit too long, though, as the pasta would likely absorb the broth.  The taste was superb, and I received many compliments.  One Italian friend even commented that it was just like his grandmother used to make.

Just as good as the soup at my favorite Italian restaurant!  I generally like this soup a little thicker so I reduce the chicken broth to about 3 or 4 cups.  I don't keep tomato juice on hand so I've successfully substituted a can of tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes and a little extra broth.

Served this on a rainy night and my husband loved it.  Used one can of red beans and one can of black beans, used a bit of prosciutto and two slices of canadian bacon, and searched everywhere for ditalini but ended up using whole wheat baby macaroni...it was delicious!

Just realized that--oddly enough--there are two pasta e fagioli II recipes on this site. I made THIS one last night. Hubby, who thinks I'm a good cook but rarely comments on particular dishes, RAVED. Substituted hormal black label bacon for the prosciutto and cider vinegar for white. Reduced chicken broth to 4 cups, 2 low sodium, 2 fat free (all I had on hand) and, in order to accomdate that, reduced noodles to 8 oz. Served with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, which--IMHO--makes an enormous difference and is worth every penny.

Great recipe.  I added ground turkey and fresh spinach.  The kids loved it.  I did keep the pasta separated and mixed it at the last minute in separate bowls.  Another option is to spoon out the center of small crusted loaf bread and pour the soup in the center.  Makes an edible bowl and saves on dishes.

yum, yum, yum!  This soup is great!  The only thing I changed was to substitute one large can of crushed tomatoes for the tomato juice. Ditalini are a very small tube pasta, and authentic pasta e fagioli needs to be made using this particular pasta.  Barilla brand pasta does make ditalini! I'm sure I'll make this again and again. Thanks for a great recipe! :o)

This was the perfect soup tonight to battle the cold and the wind.  My family fell in love with the soup. I too went with the crushed tomatoes in place of the tomato juice and instead of red beans, I went with cannellini beans.  I topped it off by having some warm, crusty bread and Parmigiano cheese to top off the soup at the table.  Delicious!

This was AMAZING!  I used a combination of beef consomme and beef broth instead of chicken broth and a couple shakes of hickory flavored liquid smoke instead of prosciutto.  It was out of this world (I couldn't stop tasting it while it was cooking)!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Even better the 2nd day. I had to substitute 2 teaspoons Italian Seasoning for the parsley. Used a 15 oz can of kidney beans for the red beans.

Awesome, I have tried three different recipes so far and this one was the best. I subsituted hamburg for the ham. And crushed tomatoes for the sauce. The next time I will add more vegetables and beans though.

This was good soup! I accidentally used more cayenne than called for, so it was on the spicy side, which my bf and I like. I added zucchini to the veggies, and instead of using pasta, I added a can of lima beans in addition to the can of kidney (red) beans. All in all a healthy, hearty soup! Virtually fat free. One reccommendation: Tomato juice and chicken broth have lots of salt in them already, unless you get low sodium liquids. Use any additional salt sparingly, if at all.

This was delicious.  I added way more chopped veggies, though, and chopped the carrots instead of grating them.  I added fresh zucchini and fresh peas toward the end of cooking.  Recommend cooking the pasta separately and adding as needed if you will have leftovers.

WHOA!!! This recipe is OUTSTANDING!!! I'm so glad I tried it. I've made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks. EXCELLENT!!! I completely omitted the prosciutto because we don't eat pork, doubled the garlic as usual, used 1 can of drained red beans, and instead of tomato juice, used 2 14.5 oz cans of organic Italian diced tomatoes. Also, I could never find ditalini pasta, so I've been using radiatore 2 to 2.5 cups uncooked). I've tried cooking all the pasta and j

INCREDIBLE!!! It doesn't get better than this! I used leftover (unsweetened) baked ham, chopped, & I added one can of sliced, stewed tomatoes. I also added a Parmesana Reggiana cheese rind.  I ate this for every meal for 3 days!  I loved it!

I would give this a mixed rating.  I really liked it.  It was a very hearty vegetable soup.  My husband, on the other hand, said it was "adequate" but he didn't love it.  Of course, I have a hard time getting him to eat his veggies.    These are the substitutions I made.  I used turkey bacon rather than prosciutto (my grocery was out of it).  I used half tomato juice and half tomato puree.  I added some broccoli and zucchini because I had some I needed to use up in my fridge.  I used balsamic vinegar because I really love it. I added more cayenne than it called for.  Next time I would use white beans rather than red.

This soup was good, but was kind of missing something until I added fresh parsley and, more importantly, a parmesan cheese rind.  The rind made all of the difference--it really rounded out the flavors.

excellent cold weather soup.  I followed the recipe almost exactly (at least, as close as I come).  I used diluted pasta sauce because I didn't have tomato juice, and cut down a little on the basil.  I also used balsamic vinegar.  This was the first time I used proscuitto--I think it added to the depth of flavor.

Fabulous!! The only change I made was adding a can of diced tomatoes. I was shocked that someone left out the celery and carrots, among other changes, and then only rated this 4 stars. I also thought the prosciutto was a great ingredient and can't imagine this being quite the same without it. Ham doesn't have the fat that prosciutto has, and bacon, while tasty, doesn't have enough meat to it. This makes a big enough batch though that the price of the prosciutto is really not much per bowl. I really liked the stuff:broth ratio in this soup. With all the ingredients it was quite hearty, yet it was still the more authentic broth consistency. I agree that the herbs are important. Go easy on the salt your first time - you can always add more. I eyeballed it but think I easily could have used less salt. Like others recommended, eat this with crusty bread and store the pasta separately. Thanks for the recipe!

Soup was good.  I didnt have the proscuitto, so I subbed finely chopped ham (which worked out just fine.  I also used canned great northern beans instead of the red because thats what I had on hand. I did have to add in some more sugar to cut down on the acidity (maybe thats because I used my own garden canned tomato juice, instead of store bought) and a few extra spices to taste, but all in all it was pretty good.

Really great recipe!  I used about a pound of ground beef instead of ham, and I only had half the amount of tomato juice so I used a can of diced tomatoes. Also added a few drops of Tapatio hot sauce.   Next time I'll add a couple more carrots and celery stalks, they are delicious in this soup.  Other then that, my partner and I loved it!

Put me on the list of satisfied customers! This soup is delicious and quick and easy to make. I didn't think it was bland at all. A definite repeat that I'll be eating all weekend.

I took the suggestion of someone else and used hamburger as it seemed as if it would add a bit more substance to the soup than proscut. I also threw some grated parmesan on top just because it was there. Mangia!

I just finished making this for a Tuscan-style dinner party. I didn't put any proscuitto but used 1/2 pound of Jimmy Dean Italian sausage instead. Also, I put the ditalini noodles directly into the soup, and I used cannelli beans instead of red beans. My husband said no one is going to believe it's homemade. It's better than any restaurant! Will definitely make this again and again!!!

Very good. I substituted chopped tomatoes for the tomato juice, and red pepper flakes for the cayenne pepper as I didn't have any. The prosciutto gave the soup great flavor. Per my own taste, next time I would add more beans.

Great use for leftover ham. I have made this three times so far, and I am happy with my modifications: used diced tomatoes (tried crushed tomatoes, but it made it too thick/saucy). A little extra cayenne for a bit more bite, and balsamic instead of white vinegar. Thank you for posting this great recipe!

Wow.  This was awesome!  I added an extra 2 cups of chicken broth, a few extra shakes of cayenne pepper, and put in a can of dark red kidney beans and a can of navy beans.  I also served it with a small handful of shredded 6-Italian cheese blend over the top.  It reheats really well.

I wanted a heartier fall version (i.e. more meat) so, I read all the reviews and tried: adding fresh spinach (1/2 bag), 1 can diced italian tomatoes & an 8oz can tomato paste (instead of tomato juice). In addition to prosciutto, added 2 links each of turkey sausage & hot sausage to give it a little snap (although the cayenne pepper may have been enough kick). No dried parsley but didn't miss it. This recipe is very flexible/easy to play with. I'll make it again - great cold weather eating.

I had pasta e fagioli at the Salt Lake City airport in August. It was so outstanding. I e-mailed the restaurant for the recipe to no avail. I tried this recipe and it is close to the delicious soup in Utah. I used half white beans and half red. A definate keeper!

This soup was delicious. I can't wait to make it again. I left out the tomato juice, and used a can of stewed tomatoes instead, and a little tomoato sauce. I also left out the ham, as we dont eat pork. Thanks for the great recipe!!

So good! I didn't have enough chicken stock so I used vegetable stock. I added spinach and used leftover couscous instead of the noodles. It was very very good.

Really good and sooo simple to make.  Has a little kick which is different for a veggie soup but still awesome!  Only downer is it doesn't keep for that long. I'm a student living on my own so I only cook for myself and usually eat what I make all week.  Found it to loose its spark after about the 2nd day.  Would still make again though

This soup had a very nice flavour, but I don't think that the prosciutto stood out enough to warrant it's high price.  I will make this soup again but either omit the meat, or add a little of something else.

The proscuitto seemed to get tougher the longer it cooked; I wound up fishing it all out before serving! Next time I'll chop up canadian bacon. Also, I thought it was a little bland. I put a couple spoons of marinara sauce in it before eating. Will make again, with my tweaks. It's very filling and makes a lot!

When I first made this I was just learning to cook.  I bought some ditalini because it looked neat, and then searched here and found this.  Switched one serrano pepper sliced for the cayenne, because I like it spicy (in retrospect the cayenne is prolly better)

Very good, but not excellent.  Added some chopped spinach and good parmesean to make it a notch better.  Also, a drizzle of truffle oil in the soup goes a long way...

Very tasty.  Used bacon instead of prosciutto, which I don't like.  More vegetables would make it less authentic but also more filling!  Lots of Parmesan is a must.

This recipe was the best! I loved this! I did make a few changes but overall left it basically the same. I did not have any ham on hand so I fried some bacon and chopped it up instead. I also added some ground chuck in it ( my family is a meat family so I thought it would need a bit more than bacon). I did use the tomato juice but I also added some chopped tomatos. I love the flavor and will be making this over and over. Thank you for such a wonderful soup!

This recipe is great.  I used way less pasta then called for to cut back on the calories.  Approximately 100 grams and found it was perfect.  Will definately be making this soup again and would recommend it to others.  =)

This is quite simply the best soup I've ever eaten. It's quick and simple. I made it with bacon instead because that's what I happened to have on hand and I'm making it again today with sausage instead. Make sure to store left-over pasta seperately so it doesn't soak up all that good juice.

I enjoyed this soup very much.  It was easy to make and the flavor was very good.  I topped it with just a bit of parmesian cheese.  It was a light soup and can't wait to serve it for company.

Great recipe and will definitely make again. Followed basic recipe along with other readers suggestions:  Used left over honey baked ham,  2 cans stewed tomatoes and 1 large can sauce, balsamic vinegar,  extra onion, carrots, and celery. Couldn't make up my mind on the type of beans so used both canned red beans and canalenni. Garnish with parmesan.

This Pasta e Fagioli 2 was absolutely delicious.  I made it exactly as the recipe was written.  I did however, add a little garlic salt to the stock.  Can't wait to fix it again.

A few changes based on reviews- a can of crushed tomatoes instead of juice, half chicken broth and half veg broth. A couple changes based on what I had on hand- I used white kidney beans and ditalini pasta. My husband and son loved it. I thought it was ok, but I'm not a huge tomato fan, so my opinion probably means less!

This soup is delicious!  I did as others did and used ham instead of prosciutto, crushed tomatoes instead of juice, balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar.  Easy to prepare, filling and very tasty!

Huge pot!  Taste is great!  My only problem was the pasta soaked up all the liquid... No worries, I just added more.  Loved it!

Healthy, easy and tasty!  I used bloody mary mix in place of the tomato juice.  Added a lot of flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe!  This time I substituted a link of Hot Italian sausage for the prosciutto.  WOW very spicy but still yummy.  I also use only 3/4 cup of the uncooked pasta, cooked it and added it directly to the soup.  So good, so very very good.
