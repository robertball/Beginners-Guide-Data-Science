Interesting how everyone has a slightly different way of eatting scrapple.  We spray a frying pan with Pam, slice the scrapple thin, fry until crispy eat it with eggs and toast or as a sandwich with grape jelly or ketchup.  We are very picky about the brand that we buy too.

Scrapple is fatty enough that it doesn't need oil, only a hot pan...sear both sides. Instead of mustard, try Swiss or pepper jack cheese.

The key to perfect scrapple is a light flour covering prior to frying.

Scrapple preparation comes down to personal tastes! I like my scrapple sliced around 3/8 thick, dusted and fried in oil, until itâ€™s golden in color. In addition to the bread and scrapple I like an egg fried over medium and ketchup. This makes for the absolute best meal a person can whip up. And not just for breakfast. 5 stars people, 5 stars!

First off the scrapple must be about 1/2 inch thick, a 1/4 inch thick sandwich would be like eating a PB and J sandwich with one teaspoon of PB.
A little canola oil to fry  is just fine as it is low in fat and is actually good for you.
Scrapple is a great addition to breakfast when fried till crisp but you need a good scrapple to start with. A good recipe is here but do not use MILK, USE WATER WITH A PINCH OF BEEF OR CHICKEN BULLION IN THE CORN MEAL.
