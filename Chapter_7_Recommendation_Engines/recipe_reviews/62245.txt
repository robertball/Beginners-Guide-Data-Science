Made this for a backyard party and people LOVED it! I substituted mango juice for tangerine because I couldnt find that.  I had to make a second batch, it's going to be our summer drink!!

I did not care for this at all.  Tasted it after mixing and it was very sour, had to play around with adding different ingredients until it tasted okay so I wouldn't waste all the vodka.  Was able to salvage it, but won't be using this recipe again.

It is December and I have a ton of tangerines - this isn't just a summer time drink.  It is pretty good - it might be a little sour for some people but that is easily fixed by having some lemon - lime soda on hand for those that want it.

This was pretty good.  I did mess around with the recipe a bit to get the taste I wanted.  I didn't have tangerine juice, so I used orange.  I also halved the recipe to make a small pitcher.  Thanks for giving us a great punch idea to try!
