Thanks for this great idea for New Years Eve. Such a relief to have something so fresh and healthy after all that holiday season food. I  made it per the directions.  It was gobbled up with blue corn tortilla chips. the fresh cilantro and fresh lime juice were key.

I like bold spices, so maybe this is just me, but  I found it kind of bland.  Some of that may be that the Jalapeno pepper I had was really mild.

I spiced it up at serving time by adding some pickled Jalapeno peppers on top and stirring in a few Kalamata  olives and tossing in some more salt and black pepper.  Next time I might try adding some hot sauce

I made it exactly as instructed except that I was so eager to taste it that I did not wait long enough.  i finally got a new bean recipe.  Taste good and can't wait to make it again for friends.  It's a keeper

This was delicious. I made it without the jalape√±o pepper since I didn't have one. The recipe makes a lot, I had enough to share with the neighbors (who were very grateful). Make sure to let the pico de gallo macerate before mixing with the peas for a blended and pronounced flavor.
