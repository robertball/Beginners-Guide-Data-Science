I tried poutine for the first time on a trip to Canada last year and just started having a huge craving for it now.  Glad I came across this recipe.  I started making it before I finished reading the instructions so I just did gravy, no chicken broth, but I do want to try that next time.  Also, I didnt have curds so I just threw a lot of mozzarella on. 

The seasonings for the potatoes were fabulous!  I liked that they are baked and semi crispy.

This was well liked by my family.  I like showing them  the world via the dinner plate.  Roasting the potatoes instead of frying them was good way to show them this without overwhelming them with grease.  I couldn't find the right cheese so I used Monterrey Jack Cheese.

I'll definitely opt for a lower salt content next time, but this was super yummy!!
