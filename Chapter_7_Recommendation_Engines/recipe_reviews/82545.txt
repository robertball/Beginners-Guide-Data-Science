I had to make a few substitutions (I Used generic bread, Cream of chicken soup, left out the celery, used thyme instead of sage). I liked the taste OK, the dressing was moist but not soggy but the chicken was too dry, and the onions were still crunchy.  Next time I will saute the onions first and serve with some kind of gravy or another can of soup perhaps.
