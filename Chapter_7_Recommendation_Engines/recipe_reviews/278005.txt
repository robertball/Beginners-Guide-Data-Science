The sauce is a great BBQ sauce on it's own.  Cooked with the hot dogs as long as is stated, not so good.  I have even made the sauce with whiskey and topped a turkey burger, still good.

Lip-Smackin' Good!  This is a perfect recipe to add to a holiday buffet or to a BBQ!  It's good exactly as it is written.  It can be served as is, or over rice, or over egg noodles.  Enjoy!
