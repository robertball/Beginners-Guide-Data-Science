I love jamaican style curry dishes! The great thing about this dish is its easy and very delicious. However when it comes to double the serving it called for 2 cups of water and that seemed to make the sauce thinner. I prefer it thicker so I would have to split that measurment in half to make the sauce thicker. Other than that it was awesome!

I think there's something wrong with the proportions...one-third of a CUP of curry for half a chicken breast? A tablespoon of red pepper flakes?  Half a cup of half and half and a cup of yogurt? I made it and it was a hot soupy mess.

Absolutely a mistake with proportions. I used 1 Tablespoon of  red pepper flakes (instead of 2) and twice the amount of chicken and it's still a spicy soupy mess.

This was a great base recipe! I made a few changes per others suggestions. I sauteed onion and garlic in some sesame oil, then added the chicken so it could brown. Once browned, I added the water and the curry powder. I added chilli powder in lieu of the red pepper flakes (I realised I didn't have any), brought all to a boil, stirring frequently (I noticed when left alone to boil, it was getting clumpy). Brought it all back down to simmer after 10 min (as directed), slowly added the yogurt in . I also realised I didn't have any half & half left, so I had to think fast. I used sour cream, and it was great. Let all that come together, and then added some chopped red & green peppers, and some steamed cauliflower. Let it cook for about 10 more min. then served over Jasmine rice. Was great! Will definitely make this again. *posted a photo as well*

I made a few changes...  Added 3/4 chopped onion and 1/2 small red and green bell peppers.  I also mixed hot curry with regular curry to add a little more heat.  I also browned the chicken with the onion and a tbs minced garlic prior to adding the water.  This turned out great and to keep it low-carb, we served it with some riced cauliflower for an awesome meal (see picture posted)!

Instead of half and half, I used almond milk, and I also used lactose free Greek yoghurt due to milk intolerances in our family.  I halved the red pepper flakes as I have young children. At the end of cooking, I added in blanched carrots and bell peppers to add some vegetables.  Served over white rice.

CAUTION: This recipe is SPICY if you put in the amount of Red Pepper Flake this recipe calls for.

This may taste a little bland without a small amount of salt, but that might just be me.

My sauce also came out runny, but if you boil with the sauce pan lid a little bit skewed, it helps thicken up the sauce during the first half of this recipe.

Overall, this a good, easy recipe curry that could use a little bit more flavor and less heat. My recommendation is to cut down or out the Red Pepper Flake and use some salt.
