I love this dish and will definetly make it again.  I made a few adjustments by omitting the olive oil entirely(I didn't think it was needed), used pitted sliced black olives, and adding a box of frozen spinach that I microwaved and squeezed all the fluid out of.  I also found that I could serve this recipe warm, room temp, or cold.  Yummy !!!

I modified this recipe quite a bit - substituted parsley for mint (didn't have mint), used dried dill, used half of the oil, and added one cucumber and two tomatoes.  I  also added the juice of 1/2 lemon as another user suggested.  Very flavorful, garlicy, fresh, Greek flavors.  We loved it.

This is an awesome salad!  I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it.  The second time I made it I boiled the lentils for about 8 minutes, then added the orzo to the lentils and boiled for another 8 to 10 minutes.  The only difference was that the orzo was a little darker, because it picked up the color of the lentils.  But it saved me time and dishes.

Different from other orzo salads I've made because of the mint and dill flavors, which worked nicely.  I like that the lentils gives it some more texture and fiber.  I cut way back on the oil and added some lemon juice for extra pizzazz!  Also, I halved this and it still made a big bowlful.

This is delish!!!!  Hainvg read other reviews, when I relised I was a bit short on orzo, I made up the 50g with quinoa - it gave just that little crunch.  I also substitued goats cheese as I was out of fets, and the less salty but richer flavor was fantastic.  Will definately do this again.

This was really tasty and so easy to make ahead of time.  I offered warm whole wheat pitas with it for a dinner full of complete protein. I didn't even attempt to offer it to my 2 yo because I didn't think he'd like it.  Well, he wanted to try it and LOVED it.  I never thougt I would hear my toddler say "more lentils please".  The next day I wrapped it in a whole wheat tortilla with cream cheese and he gobbled it down for lunch. I didn't change a thing. Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good.  I did make a few changes to suit my tastes and what I had on hand.  I decided, after I had cooked up the lentils and seen how much there were, not to add all of them.  I probably added about half of the cooked quantity.  I had to improvise a little on my herbs since I was short on the dill and mint so I used the little bit of cilantro I had on hand.  The only other changes I made were to omit the olives (don't like) and add a medium, unpeeled, seeded cucumber chopped.  I also used tomato basil flavored feta cheese.  When I served the salad I added some chopped tomato to each serving since tomato has a tendency to get funky in the fridge.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I tried to make this on a tight budget and it still worked out quite nice. Used half a large cucumber instead of the olives, a cheese very similar in texture to feta that they call 'Balkan cheese' here in the Czech Republic (much cheaper), a combination of white wine vinegar and balsamic vinegar to substitute for the red, and no onion because I am planning to take this to work for lunch during the week. Lots of small changes, but I don't think it affected the outcome negatively. The only thing that doesn't seem to fit perfectly with the idea is the orzo. I am wondering if rice or couscous would have worked better. Maybe next time. I had a bit of the salad at room temperature when it was ready, and I am hoping it will get even better after a day in the fridge. At the moment it's not mind-blowing but good enough to eat it for several days. I'd serve it to friends as a side-dish.

FANTASTIC. I used Trader Joes already made lentils which cut down on time. Didn't cool orzo in fridge, just rinsed in cold water then combined with everything else. Added half a diced cucumber, a jar of rinsed sun dried tomatoes, used sliced black olives too. Used only about a TBS of olive oil total and squeezed a lemon in instead. Going to play with fresh tomatos and artichoke hearts next time. Super good and healthy!

A really good, refreshing and good-for-you salad! I followed someone else's tip about partly cooking the lentils, adding the orzo and finish the two together.  Less clean-up...always a good thing!  I used French lentils, dill weed and 2 garlic cloves.    I also omitted the onion, added chopped artichoke hearts (canned & well drained) and stirred Dijon mustard into the vinaigrette. Wasn't super-picky about measurements.  I toasted some pine nuts and set them to the side for people to put on top if they liked.  Many compliments & requests for the recipe.  Made a ton, so that's what I'll have for supper tonight.  Thanks for a keeper!

Really tasty.  I used french lentils (what I had on hand) and I used a mild feta cheese as opposed to a stronger feta.  The milder feta cheese doesn't overpower the rest of the ingredients.  I added lemon juice as others had suggested which brightened the flavor some.  I think I used too much dill because it came out more dilly than minty.  I guess I will adjust the amounts next time, even though I love dill, the mint didn't seem to come through.  I will definitely make this again!

This is a great combination of flavors. I wouldn't have thought to put dill and mint together, but they work well. I flopped the amounts of the lentils and orzo (personal preference), then I discovered I didn't have any orzo, so I used barley instead, which worked out nicely. I also used shallot instead of red onion for a milder onion flavor. This is good both warm and cold, and it's very easy to put together. A definite keeper!

Good vegetarian dish.  The flavors are strong, so it's not typical kid fare.  (I'm a tough grader -- I've not given a 5 yet so don't let the 3 stars fool you.)

This is such a wonderful, easily customizable recipe. I too change a few things around based on what I had at home: 1/2 orzo 1/2 quinoa (5/8 each), added turkey, cucumber, used balsamic vinegar, no olives, some lemon...it was just wonderful. Light and filling. Thank you for posting. I am going to be making this OFTEN!

I made this last night following all the directions exactly except for that last one--refrigerate.  I was hungry and impatient and I would have rated this a solid 4 stars while slightly warm.  It was really good.  But you know what's better?  Following instructions.  Absolutely 5 stars while cold.  I might even change mine to refrigerate overnight.

This was really delicious. I substituted chopped scallions for the red onion for a less intense onion flavor. The dill and mint work well together.

This is not just an excellent salad, it's a complete meal if you wish it to be.  This is an excellent recipe and is easily adapted to add addtional ingredients as summer vegetables become prolific.  Especially grilled vegetables.  It is delicious as it is, but toss a few cherry tomatoes on top for some extra color just before serving.  We give it 5 stars.  We loved it.

This was a great salad! I used black olives instead of kalamata just because it was what I had on hand. The combination of flavors from the herbs was great! I would not however recommend this to a family with picky-eaters, but the well-seasoned palette will appreciate the combination of flavors and think it to be delicious!

This is flippin' amazing! I even accidentally threw in some red wine (the bottle was sitting right where the balsamic vinegar usually sits!), and this is still great! I omitted olives and added cucumber as per my own tastes, used quinoa per other review and used balsamic vinegar since I don't have red wine vinegar. Also no fresh dill or mint, used dried. SO GOOD!

Yummy! I had to sub dried dill since I didn't have fresh, which I'm sure would have been tastier, and added a wee bit of fresh parsley. Used fresh mint as recipe said, which is delicious. I only made half the recipe and other than following suggestion to add some fresh-squeezed lemon juice, pretty much followed as written. Would make again! May try adding cukes and tomatoes next time for more salad-y qualities. We ate this warmish. Also nice with chicken on the side. Hubby liked this.

I made this salad exactly as the recipe instructed. My entire family loved it and asked for the recipe. I will definitely be making it again. It is a perfect vegetarian supper idea. I was pleased to find kalamata olives in a jar already pitted. A quick trip to the fresh herb section in the grocery store and I had all of the other ingredients. I will be making it for company when they come since it is that delicious.

I made this for a Memorial Day party.  It was a hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe, but then realized how much preparation is involved and decided against it.  However, they told me I have to make it for the 4th of July.  I cooked the orzo and lentils a day in advance and threw it together 3 hours before our get together.  The fresh herbs are a pain but worth it.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Wow, pretty great.  The recipe sounded pretty boring but I tried it because of the great reviews.  We loved it.  I left out the dill because I didn't want to spend the money on it.  I think it's the raw garlic that makes it so wonderful.  I think the juice of a lemon or lime would make it even better!  I will definitely make this again.  Great with a sandwich.

Excellent!  Used less olive oil and simmered the lentils in chicken stock.  Otherwise, no changes.  Thanks for a great recipe.

made this for a baby shower over the weekend.  tasted good, but was alot of work - boiling, chopping, etc.  and i agree with a previous post, that it was somewhat of an expensive pasta salad with kalamata olives, feta cheese, etc.  undecided about making this again.

I have made this twice now and it has come out delicious each time. It got rave reviews at a pot luck and it is was absolutely perfect, as I found that I had some orzo and lentils in the pantry. Thanks!

Tasty and flavorful. Made a huge amount! If I was making it again, I would add more lentils and reduce the amount of red onion.

Tastes great, but gets to be an expensive salad.  The flavor improves the longer it chills.

I changed so many things this is hardly even a review of this recipe but if anyone is interested...I omitted the onion, used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar (just what I had), used black olives instead of kalamata, added quartered cherry tomatoes and toasted sliced almonds. Even without the onion it was kind of a riot of flavors, and I was really glad to have the tomatoes in it because it seemed to balance it out a little bit. It still seemed like it could have used more vegetables.

I soaked the lentils overnight and so did not have to cook them. I like that texture better for cold lentil dishes. Will make this during cucumber season and add as many seeded, diced cucumbers as it can hold.

I've made this salad probably 50 times over the last decade, exactly as-is. No matter where I bring it - foodies, non-foodies, people who think they don't like lentils, etc - it always gets rave reviews. One of my top 10 recipes!

I made this exactly. It was delicious! Perfect! Kids hated it, but that's to be expected with the red onion, etc. Both hubby and I liked it (he usually doesn't like olives but somehow this was delicious for him!)

As suggested, I cooked the lentils  and after 10 mins added the orzo into the same pot and continued for another 10.  Pretty much followed the recipe otherwise.  It was much better than I'd expected and will probably  even better tomorrow after melding in the pot all night long.  I'm new to vegetarian cooking  and looking for recipes that are nutritious, delicious, and filling.  This one meets all requirements.

I did make a couple of changes/additions: used four scallions instead of the red onion, substituted the juice of three limes for the red-wine vinegar, and added two diced Roma tomatoes. If I feel ambitious tomorrow, I may add some lightly steamed asparagus. No need for any additional salt -- the Feta's salty enough.

This came out great! Great balance of flavors. I used a three-lentil blend. I was concerned when my lentils were a bit pastey but they broke up as I stirred everything together and it tasted great.

This was good. Like everybody else I made adjustments for what I had on hand and personal taste.  I cooked the lentils with half the garlic and some of the red onion and a bay leaf. I have to complain about the directions regarding the lentils. It just says to cover with water, well how much is that? I never cooked lentils before so I found that I had to keep adding water, so that was annoying.
Made with couscous instead of orzo to be healthier. Added a little of celery, and used half white balsamic and half red wine vinegar. Used dry dill.  When I served it, I added fresh tomatoes on top; will add cukes as well tonight. This recipe makes a lot.

This was good as a summer vegetable salad. I changed it a bit, adding cucumber, yellow zucchini and cherry tomatoes. I also didn't have olives or feta, so I shredded a combination of asiago and parmesan cheeses and mixed it in at the end. The mint and dill were delicious and I loved the mix of orzo and lentils.

This salad is pretty good as is.  After tasting it as written, I added some lemon juice and quite a bit of salt.  It's also good warm--the feta turns it creamy.

I tried this dish because I had never eaten lentils before and this looked absolutely delicious . . . and it is!  The only change that I made was to use rice instead of Orzo (glueten free this way).  We served this as a cold salad along with the spicy chicken breasts from this site (we cooked the chicken and let it cool).  Absolutely FANTASTIC!  Thanks for the recipe!

Such a unique blend of flavors.  I cut back on the oil by a few tablespoons, but will make this many more times.
