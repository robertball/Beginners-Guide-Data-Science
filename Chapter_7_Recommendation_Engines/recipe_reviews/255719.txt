The first version I made didnâ€™t seem to have the right consistency in the topping for the crumble. For the second pie I made I added more melted butter to the topping before stirring it and adding the topping onto the apple mixture in the pie. It seemed to need more butter to crumble the amount of topping in the recipe. I also found the recipe makes more topping than is needed for the pie, so I ended up with a lot of left over topping, which is why I ended up making 2 pies instead of 1. It tasted great though.

Excellent dessert and very simple to make! 
I added some cinnamon and chopped walnuts to the topping and loved it that way, but I am sure it would be excellent without those changes.  I will be making this again!

Excellent recipe!! Followed exactly except for the pie crust. I used a ready-made roll-out pie crust from the grocery store.

I had some apples that needed to be used. I made 2 of these pies and took them to a church dinner.  Every piece was eaten!  None leftover!

My crisp was made into a full covering. Very good, not too sweet.

This was so good!  I followed exactly except for adding a bit of lemon juice to the apples.

I made it the same as recipe minus the oats and I added a pinch of Cinnamon to topping. Great pie, make it at all holidays now I love it so much and I don't usually like pie.

I made this exactly as written. Great flavour but far too much topping. Thanks for sharing.
