This is a great beer bread. I loved the additions of cinnamon and flax. I only used a tablespoon of melted butter and thought that it was plenty to give it a nice look and crunch. My only issue was the cranberries were so tart, especially since the bread isn't very sweet. I don't have any cream cheese, but I bet that would tone down the tartness a bit. I'll make this again and use dried cranberries instead, which I've added to regular beer bread before.

Great flavor.  I used a dark micro brew.  Next time I will increase to 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I'm a literal person, so I attempted to "whisk" beer into flour... don't try.  Use anything but a whisk.  Recipe doesn't say dried cranberries, so I used fresh.  Decided to dice the cranberries instead of leaving them whole. Dried would work.
