As I always do, I made a few minor alterations to the original recipe, but the results were FANTASTIC!  I used all whole wheat flour, 2/3c. sugar, skipped the raisins & used 1/4c. canola oil instead of 3 Tbsp. veg oil as called for.  I also added about 1/3c. chopped walnuts.  My husband avoids most things healthy like the plague, but this recipe definitely fooled him.  Thanks for the post!  I will be making these often.

I made them just as directed and they're amazing. The recipe is very easy to make and the muffins are quite filling.  A much healthier take on pumpkin bread..

I made this recipe with leftover pumpkin I'd mashed and frozen after making pumpkin pie.  It was quick and easy.  I altered it slightly, using half white and half wholemeal flour which gives a nuttier flavour and is a little healthier.  Which was good, because I ate 3 soon after baking and another 3 later in the day.  My son didn't realise it was pumpkin & bran and he loved them.  Yahoo.
