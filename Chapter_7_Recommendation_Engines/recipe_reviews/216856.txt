So, here's the deal. I marinaded my chicken beforehand in my own homemade fajita marinade before going ahead with this recipe. I think that made a huge difference in the flavor because really, we all felt that the cooking creme was lacking. I luckily was able to coupon the cooking creme so the cost was next to nothing, but I wouldn't have spent extra money to buy spiced cream cheese. Great idea, but I think next time, I'll use plain cream cheese and spice it myself with my own homemade fajita seasoning. Great idea, honestly. We really loved a creamy fajita. It's almost like a quick way to get to a different kind of Pollo Con Crema. I think this would have been good tossed with fettucini noodles, too.

This was great! I have picky eaters so I was surprised that they went for seconds. I also used a half of a package of fajita seasoning as well. trying My own spin on the chicken pasta with the garlic cooking cream tonite!

Good recipe as it is, but I did throw in a packet of fajita seasoning while I cooked the chicken, for a little extra kick, which I think was definitely needed!

Modified this recipe, but overall concept was fantastic! Here's what I did...

Cook peppers first in little olive oil, season with half packet of Lawrys fajita seasoning. Set aside.

Cook thinly sliced chicken in little olive oil and season with remaining fajita packet.

Once cooked, combine peppers and chicken in skillet, let pan cool for 2 min. Add original style Philadelphia cooking creme. Allow to warm throughout. Serve on warm tortillas, topped with shredded cheese. Yum!

This was wonderful! My husband is kind of picky and he even liked it. I did add fajita seasoning to it though. It was wonderful and I will make it again!
