This recipe caught my eye on the Buzz and I decided to try it with bone-in, skin-off chicken breast halves.  Hubs grilled them, applying the sauce the last 5-10 minutes of grilling and they came off the grill looking beautiful.  And the best part was they tasted great!  This was not nearly as sweet as I thought it might be, which is a good thing.  I think you could probably use any kind of chicken and it may also be great on pork.  Weâ€™ll be making this again soon!  UPDATE 4/21/12:  I made this again but used the glaze on pork tenderloin (see my photo), again basting with the glaze the last 5-10 minutes of grilling time.  Excellent!!  Equally as good as the chicken version, try it!

This was super yummy.  We used boneless skinless chicken breast and then cut it up into bite size pieces and served it over coconut rice.  We all loved it including our little kids.

Enjoyed this recipe, but it was a little sweet, so I added some hot sauce to the dipping glaze.

I have been on a wing kick lately and requested that my husband make these for my birthday. He doesn't like the smell of frying oil, and since these were grilled, he was happy to make them. OH MY GOSH THEY WERE AMAZING! I could have eaten hundreds. Ok, maybe not hundreds, but it sure felt like it because they were THAT GOOD! We couldn't find the peach/apricot glaze so just bought peach preserves and apricot preserves seperately and mixed them together. We also didn't have cilantro and so he left it out and they still were to die for. Crispy, sticky, and amazing.

This sounded too good to pass up and it was! I didn't plan on modifying the recipe but when I looked at the ingredients of all the brands of sweet Thai chili sauce and they all started with sugar I had to make a change. I used Thai chili sauce instead and PERFECTION! Just use mild if you don't want it really spicy. Okay, I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts and eliminated the cilantro because I can't stand it, but that just shows how versital this recipe is. I also used peach apricot preserves because that's what the store had. I grilled the chicken on the BBQ (didn't marinate ahead of time). To go with this I made the Asian Coconut Rice recipe from this site. I know my family will be requesting this a lot. Easy & delicious!

Rating the glaze only...I used bone-in breasts and roasted these, so I can't speak to the wings. The sauce was about as simple as you can get, but I thought it was too sweet and not spicy enough, so I added some shrircha to spice it up. There is another Asian-inspired glaze recipe here at AR that I like more, but for ease, you can't beat this one.

Very good. Will use this recipe again but might thicken it up a bit next time so that more will stick to the chicken

Delicious!  I used grilled boneless, skinless chicken breasts for this recipe since we don't eat wings.  I used apricot-pineapple preserves because its all my local store had in stock.  It turned out great and I loved the pineapple flavor added.  The lime juice and cilantro is what make this recipe great.  This is a recipe we will make again and again.

Delicious chicken with a zip.  This sauce was very easy to put together, but yet, added so much flavor to grilled chicken.  I only had chicken parts, not wings, but it served the same purpose.  I even used the leftover sauce on grilled pork, and it was outstanding.  I served the chicken with 'Cabbage-Carrot Casserole' by Paula.  Paula is a regular with the morning crew on "thebuzz".

This is great!! made them for a family barbeque, with a side of potatoe salad, very nice. My local store did not have the apricot-peach perserves, so I tried straight apricot. I used a bit more chili sauce because I like spice and doubled the cilantro. Great on the grill, I can see other possibilities too.

Thanks to all the folks on the Buzz that kept saying how good this is!  I used 1/2 peach preserves and 1/2 apricot preserves because I had it on hand and could not find the Smucker's at the store.  And I cooked them under the broiler.  It is on the menu again this week (yes, it IS that good).  Trying the sauce on a pork roast next.  TIP:  Store your cilantro in a glass with a little water and cover it with a plastic bag - it will keep for several days.  Or you can chop cilantro and freeze it.

These wings were great! I was a bit nervous to try them because it seemed like they were very Asian inspired wings, but they came out delicious. Everyone enjoyed them and they were simple to make!

We used this glaze on grilled chicken breast, it was excellent tasting. I agree with another review would be great on pork too.

I put this on boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of wings.  I couldn't find the peach apricot preserves so I used equal parts peach and apricot jams.  This makes a nice glaze that I'll use again.

I get rave reviews on these wings. I just make a small change and use garlic chili sauce instead of the sweet, but this always turns out wonderful. I am not a griller so I boil my wings first and then bake them.

I was looking for a recipe that would wow everyone in my family. I made this last night and it was amazing. My local grocery store didn't have the Smuckers preserves so I bought one jar of peach and one jar of apricot which worked great because I needed to double the recipe for the family I had over for dinner. I also added garlic hot sauce to give it more spice (still needed more). Everyone loved the chicken. They actually prefered it to the the chicken fried rice my cousin made. I will definitely make this agin.

I understand this is a Wing recipe, But the footnote Does say grilled salmon, pork, etc. So I bought some Beautiful salmon pieces from Costco. Preheated the oven to 375 and layed the fish on parchment paper. I added salt n pepper. Salmon cooks So quickly anyway, I just spoon the sauce on the fish before I baked it. 2 words >>>> DA BOMB!! I served it with cheese/spinach ravioli and corn on the cob. I will keep this one close at hand! Thank You Smuckers :):)
UPDATE::: Hubby n DD- Tina came home and DEVOURED THIS DISH!! Could not stop singing praises for this! ! YUMMO!

What a great summer grilling recipe!  I used this glaze on grilled boneless/skinless chicken breasts sliced thin, they were so crispy and delicious.  Love this glaze and you will too!  Good job, Smuckers!

I used this recipe in a Ultimate Tailgate Challenge against 24 other teams and placed 2nd.  This is a awesome recipe, the judges said it was the best they ever had.  I made 2 changes, I added some green onions and a teaspoon of Sirachia sauce for more heat.

Packs on the flavor.  I would never have thought to pair fruit preserve with the thai chili sauce.  I will definitely make again.

I used sugar free apricot preserves and added minced green onion, minced garlic, and grated ginger root.  Then I grilled the wings a bit without sauce then tossed them in a bit of sauce and grilled a little more.  When cooked I tossed the wings again with the reserved sauce. These were so good I ate them before taking a photo :)~

Have to give this a 4 instead of a 5 because I made alterations to it.  This is fantastic with boneless, skinless chicken breast.  It caramelized nicely and will be a nice addition to my grilling rotation.  Thank you for sharing.

This is delicious on BLSL chicken breasts!  Perfect blend of flavors, although I had to use peach preserves, as I could not find the apricot/peach.  Yum, yum, yum!  Thanks for the recipe, Smucker's!

SO GOOD!!!  I started glazing ( I didn't dip) after the wings were on for about 15 minutes and glazed about 3 times until the wings were done.  Loved them!

I know many of you hate this, but when a good recipe inspires me, I can't simply ignore it and neglect to give credit.  So I had to cobble this together with available ingredients and we LOVED it.  Threw everything into Ninja and blended:  6oz orange marmalade, 2 frozen peach slices, 1/4 cup sweet chili sauce (stuff we have is pretty spicy), squirt of Sriracha sauce, juice of 1/2 a lime, and a tablespoon of cilantro.  Oh my - - - deliciously orangy/peachy - sweet and spicy - this would be great on stirfry, chicken breasts, pork - in short, everything they mentioned.  Thanks so much for the inspiration!  If I every get my hands on a good batch of apricots and can make some preserves, will certainly give that a whirl.  I like the zesty tang of orange and lime, however.

I shouldn't rate this recipe because I used Thai garlic chili sauce. That was all I could find. It was an inferno! I'd still like to try it with the sweet chili. I'm reviewing this just to remind myself. I think it's worth trying again with the right ingredients.

Made these for a birthday party along with marinated chicken thighs and a rotisserie pork butt. The wings were the first to go. There was enough sauce left over that people used it for the thighs and pork, and it was a great compliment!

DELICIOUS! Of the three wing flavors, this was the hands down fave. I couldn't find the peach apricot preserves so I bought peach and apricot, and combined the two. I plan to make this again to use on other things like chicken breasts, fish, baked chicken legs.. yum!
