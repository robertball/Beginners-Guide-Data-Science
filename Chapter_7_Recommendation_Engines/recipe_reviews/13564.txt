Excellent recipe! I cater, and my clients asked me to keep these in regular rotation.

Per suggestions, I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar for the filling, plus butter instead of margarine.

I suggest using the large disposable foil pans found at Sam's Club or Wal-Mart. There is no run-over or clean-up required. Pam eliminates sticking troubles.

I did bake the crust for 20 minutes, per the recipe. After topping with the filling, I baked the bars for 45 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through the baking time to ensure even cooking. There is no way that these bars could be cooked in 25 minutes, per the recipe (unless you expect to eat the bars with a spoon).

To test for doneness, gently shake the pan. If the filling jiggles, keep baking. If you get just a slight bit of movement at the center, the bars are ready to be taken out of the oven. You don't want to cook them until there is no movement. At that point, they'll be too dry. When the bars are done cooking, cool on the counter for about 30 minutes before refrigerating for at least 4 hours, or overnight.  Don't worry about the crunchy edges. As with brownies, lots of people like the crunchy edge. The center is still nice and gooey, yet not requiring utensils or a napkin.

Also, don't be worried by the texture of the crust when you're mixing it. It seems too crumbly, but once it cooks and the filling is poured on top, it is a wonderful buttery shortbread consistency.

Let me share my thoughts on this really great pecanpie bars.  First, you have to have the right size jelly roll pan!  I used a 12X18 inch dark metal pan.  I lined the pan with parchment paper (Make sure it goes up on all four sides, if not and it 'leaks' it WILL stick! But not where the paper is covered.) DO NOT GREASE/BUTTER PAPER!  Since, my pan was dark, I lowered the temperature to 325.  And I did not have any boil-over.
Now, here is how I 'tweaked' the recipe.  In the crust I used real butter and had it soft, I used 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar, instead of white;omit the salt.  Then sprinkle into pan and press firmly making as even as possible.  Since the filling was similar to my pecan pie recipe, I used 5 eggs, increased pecans to 3 cups, threw in a handful of left-over chocolate chips that I had on hand.  I baked the crust 15 minutes; then put on the filling and baked it 27 minutes (electric oven).  These are truly a "keeper" and were enjoyed by family.  But if your pan is not large enough, please stick to the others who used a 9X13 pan.  Either way, I don't think you will be disappointed.  But do use the parchment paper, it makes a big difference.

This was great.  I did not have a jelly roll pan, so I changed the serving from 36 to 24 (all measurements changed nicely except the 4 eggs which equaled to 2 and 3/4.  I just used 3 eggs.) I made in a 9 x 13 pan and cooked at same temp and time. Everything set and tasted wonderful.  I also lined the pan with parchment paper to prevent sticking.

I would have given this five stars, but I did make a few revisions.  I used salted butter instead of margarine, and substituted brown sugar for half of the white sugar (in the filling mixture).  Also, I toasted the pecans at about 300 degrees for about 10 minutes or so to bring out the flavor (watch them close so they don't burn!), then tossed them with about 1/2 TBSP of salted butter before I added them to the filling mixture.  I took these to a bake sale at my son's school and got rave reviews!  I am a big pecan pie fan and I think I like these even better than the pie!  I will be making these often!

First, I opted not to use a jelly roll pan as so many said it made a mess.  I used a 9 x 13 pan, used a lot of cooking spray and did a fast crust by using  1 1/2 roll up dairy case pie crusts. The  round crusts had to be manipulated a bit, but it worked out fine.  They went about 1/2 way up the side of the pan.   I prebaked the crust for about 10 minutes.  The filling fit perfectly, and I also added a couple of handfuls of chocolate chips to the top!  ( don't add too many,  or you will lose the pecan pie flavor!)

The filling did not leak at all, and the crust lifted easily from the bottom of the pan! Because the volume of filling was deep,   I  cooked it in a 325 convection oven for considerably longer than the recipe stated.
Yummy!  Fabulous!

This has to be the best recipe out there! My office insists that I make them. The new Reynold's Wrap Easy Release Foil works well to help get them out of the pan when the carmel sticks to the edge of your pan.

The bars freeze well too!

These turned out so good.  I toasted my pecans for a few minutes before adding them, and I didn't bother chopping them.  Also, I lined my pan with foil and then greased the foil, and had no trouble removing them from the pan.  I absolutely love pecan pie, but often find that it is made too thick and is thus overly sweet and rich.  These were the perfect solution.  Not too thin, not too thick.  The crust was really nice and buttery an excellent texture, and the filling was perfectly gooey and sweet.  Everything about these was great.  I got 32 quite large bars out of mine, and they disappeared pretty quickly!  I'll be making these again!

VERY good.  I followed the reviewer's suggestion of changing servings to 24 servings in order to get correct ingrediant amounts for a 9x13 pan.  It worked perfectly.  I also used half butter, half margarine in the crust, and all butter in the topping. Very tasty and rich.

These were really fantastic!  I made a few changes - I substituted bwon sugar fro teh white sugar in the crust and used unsalted butter instead of margarine.  In the "gooey" part, I only used 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar.  Just about everyone said "These are perfect - not too sweet at all!"  I highly recommend them!

This is a great idea, and serves many, but the crust is all wrong, it simply is not very good. I highly suggest you use my crust recipe instead. (2 cup flour. 1/2 cup powdered sugar (icing sugar). 1cup butter & a pinch of salt)prepared and baked the same way as the recipe. This makes a huge differance, holds together much better.

Yum, yum, yum!  I did make a few changes: I baked both the crust and the bars 5 min longer (25 min for crust and 30 min for bars - but it was probably because of my oven) and I arranged pecan halves on top instead of mixing chopped pecans in the mix.  I made these for an office pot luck and they were gone in minutes!

Because we are generally swimming in pies over the Thanksgiving holiday, this year I decided that I would make these instead of my traditional pecan pie. Am I ever glad I did. The shortbread crust just melts in your mouth and the gooey, toffee layer is the exact taste of the pecan pie in a hand held serving.  I did use all butter rather than margarine. Otherwise the recipe was made as written. These are terribly rich and make so many that there was plenty to last through the weekend for all the out of town, overnight guests, and still have a few to enjoy with my coffee Monday morning. This is a keeper for sure and I will gladly be making these again.

Made for Thanksgiving 2009.  Based on others recommendations I used the 9 by 13 pan, sprayed it with pam.   Scaled ingredients to 24 servings, rounding to 3 eggs.   I used half brown sugar and half white in the filling and extra nuts.    One comment received was, "I think I died and went to heaven!"   I plan to make these again and again.  THANKS!    My husbands favorite bakery in town makes a similar bar and sells them for $1 a piece, for a SMALL piece.  I know for a fact that they often freeze them, so next time we make these we may try freezing part of them for future use.   Didn't have any left this time, as other attendees were glad to all take some home with them.

Yum yum yum. I was worried about the bars being too thick, since all I had was a 9x13, so I used only 3/4 of the recipe (27 servings) and it was perfect. I also used brown sugar instead of white in the filling, as I like the deeper flavor it gives. I did not line my baking sheet, just sprayed with cooking spray. As soon as the bars came out of the oven, I ran a knife along the edges and then let it cool. Cut very cleanly and didn't stick at all.

This was pretty easy to make. I only had a 9x13 pan, so I cut the recipe down to 24 servings and used 3 eggs instead of 2 3/4 like it said. I lined my pan with the parchment paper. Make sure you leave the 1 1/2 inch extra paper around the edges. Makes it easy to keep the liquid mess where it's suppose to be. Also after it was done bakeing I held both long sides of the parchment paper tauntly to remove it from pan. Laying it on a large cutting board. Then I gently pulled the paper away from the edges. After it cooled for 30-40 minutes, I used a pizza cutter to cut it into squares. Using a large square glad bowl, I put parchment paper in between each layer of pecan bars. I don't review everything I try, but I loved these.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY, even using shortening to lightly grease my 10x15 jelly roll pan . 

1st) the crust is too flourly and not buttery at all. I actually think it was about 2x more flour then needed; it needed about 1/2 cup more sugar at least to improve the taste.  

2nd) the filling was a nice taste but really nothing special. It set okay but I was displeased with the foamy appearance. 

3rd)  the cooking time in the recipe is not correct as others have stated in their reviews as well; I would up the cooking time once you add the filling to 30 min on 350, but again be mindful to not burn your pecans or overdry the bars.

Excellent.  I brought these to a potluck and they were the first thing to go.  I adjusted the recipe to 24 servings and made it in a 9x13 pan.  (All the adjustments worked out evenly, except for the egg.  I used three full eggs.)  Even with the smaller pan, I ended up baking the crust for 20 minutes and the filling for 30. It didn't seem quite set at 25 minutes.  Delicious!

This is a great recipe for the whole family.  Even though my dad is the only one who likes pecan pie, almost everyone liked this pecan recipe.  I only made 2/3 of the recipe for Thanksgiving last year and it was still too much because it's so rich and we had other desserts to try.  If you make these bars, don't make anything else for dessert.

Never use margarine.  If you take the time to bake, use the good stuff - butter.  Also, powdered sugar rather than granulated makes a more tender crust and toasting the pecans a few minutes gives them a better flavor.

These turned out AMAZING!  I took the advice of other's and used real butter.  I also exchanged the 1 1/2 cup of granulated sugar for 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar.  I also lined my cookie sheet (or what they call a jellyroll pan) with foil and smeared melted butter on top of the foil with a paper towel prior to placing my crust.  I made sure and crusted the sides of the pan.  This prevented the gooey filling from sticking and made it easier to remove the pecan bars after they were fully cooled down for cutting.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe, my family and I really enjoyed it!

I am big on only reviewing the EXACT recipe, therefor, I can't comment on the crust as I altered it. But, the filling was awesome! You must use the 10X15 inch jellyroll pan, and measure 2 1/2 cups of pecans CHOPPED. Don't measure before chopping. I am betting that's why everyone had "runny" results. Great alternative to pecan pie, which I find too sweet. Also had no problem with clean up using parchment paper sprayed with a bit of Baker's Joy.

Super Yum! I think they are better than pecan pie!  The one thing I try to remember is to make sure to press the crust up the side of the pan to make it where when I pour the filling it will not seep under the crust. Then it will burn and that part has to be tossed. Bummer to toss all that goodness! These are always a big hit at any get together. Thanks for the recipe.

First time I made these.  I followed PieLandyB's review (12/16/06) and they turned out perfect.  I used  the 12x18 pan,the parchment paper, split the sugars between brown and white in the filling and added the extra egg and pecans. I let them back 35 minutes instead of 25.  Wonderful and I don't really like Pecan Pie.

Loved this recipe.  The thick crust adds a balance to the sweet filling. I followed the suggestions on using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugars, baked a little longer (about 40 minutes - did not rotate, I have a convect bake oven). I added 1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips to the filling.  It turned out wonderful - the whole family loved it! (even those who don't like pecans) I liked that it did not taste overly sweet.

Just tried them and I really liked them. I made 24 servings in a 9x13 dark pan, baked @ 325 for the specified time and they came out great. I had no problems with my crust, maybe the ratio of filling to crust is different if you use a smaller pan? I definitely recommend this recipe.

Excellent!!  I followed the recipe exactly except baked for 24 servings and used wax paper on a 9x13 pan and it came out perfect.  Be sure and check at 25 minutes, mine were done.  But several reviewers said it took longer.  I am glad I didn't cook longer they would have been ruined.  Tip, after baking put in refrigerator to cool then they will cut into pretty squares.

OMG...easy, transportable, very pecan pie-like. Made these for Thanksgiving, then daughter made them for Christmas. We are a gluten and dairy free family, and this recipe adapts easily. We love this dish!

i have made these twice now and they are to die for.  everyone loves them and they are addicting.  funny thing is, both times i made them i honestly thought i ruined them b/c of how the top appears (1st time) and then the filling overflowed from my cookie sheet the second time.  but after they had cooled completely, they were fine.  so if you think you've ruined them, think again!  also, they're easy to cut into squares with a (preferably plastic) pizza cutter!

Great!  Just got 4 recipe request at a small party.  I used 3/4 cup each of brown and white sugar in topping.  Plus used 1/4c dark karo, 1 1/4c light.  Make sure to use real butter.  If you are going to spend all that money on Pecans(used 3 c), don't scrimp by using margarine.

I followed the advice of the other reviews and reduced the serving amount to 24 and cooked these in a 9 x 13 glass dish.  The turned out FANTASTIC!  The crust was awesome and the filling was yummy!

Tip - be sure that you keep your butter ice cold and do not handle the dough for the crust very much to make sure that your crust is great!

YUM!  Made them for a crowd for Thanksgiving, I didn't hear one bad thing about them :)  I toasted the pecans for 7 minutes in the oven before adding them to bring out the flavor.

The first time I made these, I made them exactly like the recipes says. They turned out fantastic. Second time, and after reading several reviews, I decided to use parchment paper so could lift them out easier. Well the paper doesn't sit nice in the corners of the pan. I cut two pieces, one for length, and one for width of the pan. I sprayed the corners where there was very little pan showing thinking this would be enough to keep it from sticking in corners. Corners did not stick, but the filling melted and oozed under the paper along the edges. WHAT A MESS. I will go back to using the spray. Parchment paper made a bigger mess then not using it did. I'm sure they will taste just as good. But there is no way they will look as nice. :(

Awesome, but bring corn syrup and sugar to a boil before cooling and adding eggs & pecans. Makes it way less runny.

I wish i could give 4 and a half stars. We loved this recipe, but I cannot give a 5 stars because I  made a lot of changes to the recipe. I reduced the amount of flour in the crust by half. Also, I put it in a 9x13 pan and not a jelly roll pan. Even then, we would have liked it thicker. Also, as other viewers mentioned it was too hard around the edges.

I made these for a work pot luck. I couldn't find a jelly roll pan on short notice, so I did as another suggested used a disposible 9x13 cake pan and reduced the servings to 24, but cooked the same amount of time. I also lined the bottom with parchment. I used brown sugar in the filling, and per another suggestion I refrigerated overnight. It came out perfectly, and there were no leftovers. Will definitely make again.

These pecan pie bars are fabulous! The crust is delicious and buttery and it came together very quickly. For the filling I substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar to make 1 cup white sugar 1/2 cup brown. I also reserved a 1/2 cup of the pecans and sprinkled them over the top of the finished bars along with 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips. The chocolate was perfect and soft but did not lost its shape. This is a keeper for sure!

Awesome! Took to a tailgate party and everyone loved them! I even kinda liked them and I hate pecan pie! Used an 11x15 cake pan and upped the serving size to 40....it called for 4 1/2 eggs so I used 5. Used half sugar, half brown sugar in the filling. Used all salted butter instead of margarine. Got rave reviews--one man said it was not icky sweet but not bland either, just perfect! Used parchment paper. Placed halved pecans on top instead of mixing them in. So pretty. I loved the crust--just like a shortbread cookie! Kind of formed the crust up the sides to hold the filling in. Had to bake for 40 minutes. Will definitely make it again!

The only thing I changed was the sugar and the baking time...to about 50 minutes, and even then it had more than a bit of jiggle to it, but it turned out fantastic!! And I used brown sugar instead of white! These were gone so fast. Will definitely be making for holiday get togethers from now on!!

Excellent recipe.  I used a 9x13 jelly roll pan and cut the recipe down to 24 servings with excellent results.  Also, used real butter not margarine and subbed brown sugar for half white.  These were a big hit at Thanksgiving and I loved the idea of a short bread crust instead of the pie crust.  So much tastier in my opinion.  Thank you for sharing. This will be on our thanksgiving menu every year from now on (as well as any other time I feel like pecan pie!!).

Very good, but I found the crust to be a little too thick and dry. We would have preferred a thicker filling in proportion to the crust, which I made using butter. I did like many reviewers and cut it back to 24 servings, baking it in a 9" X 13" pan. Next time I'll cut the filling back to 30 servings, while keeping the crust at 24 servings to improve the filling:crust ratio. Second bake time was 32 minutes. A Tb of Kentucky bourbon added to the filling gives it that authentic southern flavor. Lovely, buttery taste. No real problem in getting the bars to release, although it did take a little more pressure than with most recipes.

This was a HUGE Hit!!!  However, after reading the other reviews I decided to bake my bars in a 9x13 glass dish, didn't use all the crust mix, used plenty of no stick on the glass pan and this worked out really good!!  I baked the crust for 30 minutes and this was perfect and baked the filling for 30 minutes also..  This was a HUGE hit at work and I will be making them again soon!!!

This recipe is fantastic. I made these for Thanksgiving at my in-laws, and they were a hit. My mother-in-law asked me to make them again for Christmas. My husband, who refuses sweets to eat healthy, could not keep his hands away.

I made this recipe for our Thanksgiving dinner a day ahead of time and sampled it last night.  It's very good.  I think the crust could stand to be baked a little longer though, as it wasn't as crispy as I would prefer.  Thanks for this recipe!

This was AMAZING!!!!  Followed the recipe exactly.   Made sure the parchment paper was high enough and had no trouble with spillage.  I will never make a pecan pie again because this was so much easier and made a lot more.   Also loved the shortbread crust.   TRY THIS AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.

This is a really good start to something amazing but i found it lacking a little.  Another reviewer stated the crust was a too floury and i agree.  i would knock off 1/2 cup of flour next time and keep the salt which i omitted as per other reviewers.  depending on that result i may even add a couple TBSP of butter.  I also used butter throughout instead of margarine.  i would use 100% light brown sugar (or 1/2 and 1/2 white and dark brown) in the filling.  I may even add 1/2 tsp of salt to the filling next time i do this - the flavor was a bit lackluster and i think it needs some more richness w/added salt and molasses would help with.  also, i found a 25 min bake time after the filling was added to be a bit much.  next time i will set the timer to 20 mins and check it then - it wasn't dry by any stretch but it was missing some gooey-ness.  I will def make again as it had the pecan pie taste and texture w/out the "pie" so easier to cut, distribute and eat and of course serving size is smaller (although everyone was going back for 3rds and 4ths so maybe not!!).  really good base recipe - i'm glad i gave it a go and will try again with stated tweaks :)

Love it! I followed the recipe except I use butter instead of margarine, and I added salt to the topping. Be sure to use the proper sized pan and these will bake up nicely in 25-30 minutes. I recommend lining the pan with parchment paper and allowing the parchment to hang over on all sides for easier cleanup and no problems with the bars sticking. The shortbread crust is amazing with the pecan and caramel topping! Delicious!

Halved the recipe.  Used walnuts (that's what I had), added 1 tsp. of water and vanilla to crust with a sprinkle of cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice.  Used half white sugar and brown sugar, also added a sprinkle of cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice to the filling (adds a nice warmth and you can't pinpoint the exact taste).  Will use this crust recipe for my pecan pies in the future.

I followed the basics of the recipe but did change it from margarine to butter.  I changed the filling using equal amounts of sugar & brown sugar, and replaced the vanilla w/ 1 Tablespoon of bourbon. I also upped the pecan quantity, and added in some chocolate chips.  I have successfully used a 12"x17" pan, and it stretched the amount of servings, and I had NO issue w/ the crust or filling not being enough, and it cooked in the given time frame w/ no issues. These were GOOD!!!!!!

These are so addicting. I am a huge pecan pie fan and these are simply amazing. The crust works out very well and they are easy to make! Will be making again for sure. Did adjust to make in the 9 X 13 dish with the suggestions and it turned out fine

I have been looking for a really good pecan pie bar for a long time and now I've found it.  I used butter instead of margarine because I like butter in all my cookies and I used half brown and half white sugar, other than that I followed the recipe as written.  I lined my pan with aluminum foil sprayed with pam.  When they were cool, I just lifted the whole thing out and cut them with a pizza cutter, so easy and no mess!  My hubby really loves this one!

Was not impressed with the crust.  Crumbly.  Tasted too flourly.  My fault?  The recipe? But will not be making again.

I followed this recipe to a t...and they turned out awful! What  a waste of ingredients! The crust wouldn't come up from the pan, no matter how much I pried and prodded, it just wouldn't move! The "filling" was really good, but you can't eat just straight filling! What a disappointment....

So delicious and easy!  Sure to be in heavy rotation at my house.  I used the double-wide nonstick aluminum foil to line my pan to create about an inch lip around all the edges.  The filling would have spilled over otherwise and made a colossal mess.  Plus clean up was a breeze afterward.  Great recipe!

I made this recipe according to the recipe but they stuck so bad that I was unable to make nice squares. I want to try again, but I will try either a non-stick pan or maybe parchment paper. They were extremely good just not presentable.

These were gooey yummy. Maybe almost too sweet, but so good. They were a much easier replacement for pecan pie. We couldn't stop eating them, but gained a few pounds so next time I make these I'm going to play with it a little and exchange agave nectar for the corn syrup. Definitely making them again though.

These are good. I'm not a big fan of pecan pie but these bars are soo tasty. I couldn't stop eating them. I am making these instead of pecan pie for thanksgiving, along with a pumpkin cheesecake. I added a bit of Bourbon to the filling. YUM

I made these for Father's Day, and they were a big hit.  I would highly recommend lining the pan with parchment paper and spraying it with non-stick spray.  The clean up was very easy, but otherwise would have been a lot more work.  I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I baked 25 minutes, but should have checked at 20 because the edges got a little over cooked.  They stay very moist for days.  We have enjoyed heating them up in the microwave and putting vanilla ice cream on top.  Very good recipe!

If you hear of a run on pecans in California or Georgia, it will be because everyone that ate mine is now baking them.  Everyone wants the recipe.  My family says they have given up pecan pie in favor of these wonderful cookies.  My mother is now baking them for the men working on her house, and says more work gets done!     The only change I made is to use butter in place of margarine.  This is BY FAR THE BEST RECEIPE I have found in years and is now requested by family and friends.  This is a real price winner!

Excellent recipe.  Everyone I made them for raved about them.  I changed the serving size to 24, used a 9x13 pan, lined the pan with parchment, used half white and half brown sugar in filling, and butter as per previous suggestions. So yummy.

ADDICTIVE!! We couldn't stop eating this at our Christmas party.  I tried to make them "a little" healthier without altering the taste though.  I also made them in a 9x13 so I scaled back the recipe for 24 servings vs. 36.  I sprayed the pan w/olive oil spray. My alterations were that I used 1/2 Splenda Brown Sugar and 1/2 Splenda for baking, instead of all white sugar.  I also used 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine in the crust and only butter in the filling.  I also found "light" light corn syrup that had 33% less calories so I used that instead.  I also used about 3 cups of chopped pecans for the 24 servings.  They only took 20-25 min. to bake. They were PERFECT and will definitely be on my list to make again next year! THANK YOU!

Fantastic!  Pecan pie flavor without being overwhelmingly sweet, as crust to filling ratio is about 50-50.  Hint: don't bake in stoneware as sides will overcook.

I had to bake the crust for about 25 minutes and when I added the filling I had to bake it for 45 minutes.  The ends were a little hard though.  I never tasted pecan pie but these were great!  I only had about 1 cup of the syrup so I used honey for the extra 1/2 cup of syrup needed.

I would agree with the others to reduce the servings to fit in a 13x9 inch pan.  The longer these sit the better they are - 2nd and 3rd day bars are amazing!

I have made this recipe twice within the span of 2 weeks! Once for our potluck at work and again for Thanksgiving dinner. I cut down the servings to 24 to fit a 9x13 pan, used butter instead of margarine, used half white and half brown sugar for the filling but other than that stuck to the recipe. Everyone was a fan! This might be my Thanksgiving stand-by from now on.

I baked these for the first time as one of my Thanksgiving desserts. I wanted an alternative to another pie. I followed some of the previous suggestions: toasted pecans for 10 min. in a 300 degree oven, lined the jelly roll pan with parchment paper, & used 3/4 cup white sugar & 3/4 cup light brown sugar for the filling. I baked it for about 40 minutes, till the filling had a slight jiggle. After cooling, I cut them in 2x2 inch squares. They were a big hit. I just emailed all my sisters the recipe, per their request!

These are very good, very gooey, and very messy! They are great to eat at home, but they are not very functional for parties or events. They do not stack well on serving trays and people cannot easily pick them up or eat them without getting involved in a sticky mess.

I just finished making these for Xmas about 2 hours ago; as Pecan Pie is my husband and Uncle's favorite. My husband said this is by far better than the pie itself. Like other reviewers I did 3/4 C of sugar and 3/4 C of brown sugar instead of the 1 1/2 C of sugar like a traditional pie would call for. I will most definitely keep this recipe going for many winter holidays to come.

This bar is a chewier miniature version of the classic pie - delicious and great for when you need to make a lot of cookies at one time.  (They are fairly rich so I cut them small and get at least 50 or so out of one batch.)
The recipe is great as is, but cutting half of the granulated sugar and replacing it with brown sugar worked well too. *Line your jelly roll with non-stick aluminum foil and a little PAM for easy cleanup.

This recipe was fantastic!  I read other's comments and decided to keep the serving size as directed by the recipe.  However, I did line the jelly roll pan with foil and made the sides of the foil about 1/2 inch higher than the pan to prevent it from boiling over.  

I would highly recommed this recipe.

I had a tough time with this one. Following suggestions from reviews, I used a 9x13 pan, but it made the whole thing "too thick" and by the time the middle was done, the edges were petrified. They taste good in the center though. I might try again using a bigger pan, but I'm worried about the boil over mess in my oven that some reviewers reported.

These came out incredible.  I (yet again) cut the recipe in half to fit an 8 inch square pan.  Due to a minor oversight, I ended up using equal parts light and dark corn syrup, and i think they really couldn't taste better.  These were gooey-licious and crunchy, and the crust got a bit of crispness after a day.  These are a definite keeper.

These are very yummy! We've been eating these for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I store them in the fridge and love how they taste cold. The only change I made to the ingredients was that I included some walnuts with the pecans, since I didn't have enough pecans. I lined my pan with foil and sprayed it with cooking spray, and didn't have any trouble taking the bars off, although I had to be careful not to tear the foil. Next time I make these, I will try using some dark corn syrup and some brown sugar for a richer, darker flavor -- although as is, they are still so good.

Took these to my grandmother's house for Christmas eve.  My cousins loved them.  I didn't have a jellyroll pan, so I substituted a 10X13 pan instead.  Since the pan was smaller, the bars turned out thicker than they should have, and therefore were runnier than I had expected.  None of my family seemed to mind eating these with a fork instead of their fingers.  If I use the smaller pan again, I'll split the ingredients into 2 pans so that the bars will set better.

yum yum!  these were great, I've had many requests for them.  The key to clean up is definitely to line your pan with foil!  I used a 10x15 pyrex baking dish and had no problems with spillover (higher sides than a jelly roll pan), but I did lengthen the baking time on the crust and the final dessert by about 10 mintues each (due to the thick glass rather than thin metal).  The second time I made them i decreased the butter in the crust to 3/4 cup, but it seemed like it cracked more and the filling seeped down in places, not disasterous by any means, but i dont think i'll do it that way again...just live with the fact that this is NOT a diet dessert!!  :)

This is one of my favorite recipes to serve to guests.  Everyone always loves these.  I cut them into small squares and serve them in paper cupcake baking cups b/c they can be a little sticky.

I thought this recipe was great!  My only caution would be to take care to not overfill the crust with the filling, as it may seep in under the crust.  What a great way to serve pecan pie to a crowd!  This is a definite keeper for my recipe box!  Thanks for sharing, MARIETA!

I tried this recipe for the first time last year & it was a SUPER HIT!
I always try to make my mom a homemade pecan pie for Christmas but choose to make these & I don't believe I will be going back to making the pie anymore!  These were delicious & much easier to serve in smaller portion sizes!

These pecan bars are AMAZING!  This is my go to dessert for any occasion.  I am asked for this recipe almost every time I bring them somewhere.  There is no need to stray from the recipe, it is great as is.  Word of caution:  depending on your oven, cooking times may vary.  My oven tends to be strong, so I bake for 16 minutes each time it I put it in the oven and it comes out great.  Try this, you won't be disappointed :)

It's a keeper. Got nothing but positive feedback from friends and family. I too only used 2 cups of flour and in the filling I used half brown sugar and half granulated. Baked it for 40 minutes and they were perfect. I used foil so I could pull th out easily from the pan.

I also forgot to add that I did not change the stated cooking time. I set my oven timer for 25 minutes after baking the crust. After 25 minutes, I checked it and they were perfectly done, slightly wiggly in the center. So had I followed others suggestions of 45 minutes, they would have been crackers. Be sure to test done after 25 minutes as the recipe states and then according to your oven and/or pan size, give em a little longer if the filling is too loose.

I cut this recipe in half and used an 8" sq. cake pan.  The filling took longer to set (cease to jiggle) than the recipe indicated but the results were wonderful!

OMG!! I made this recipe today trying to re-create a pecan bar cookie that I bought at a Bakery, this is the one!! I read the reviews and changed the servings to 24 and baked in a 9X13 pan. I did this not because I don't have a jelly roll pan, but because I knew I would eat all of it myself(kind of kidding!)that and using real butter are the only changes that I made. Make this today, it is a very easy, Superstar recipe!

Delicious.  Made for Thanksgiving, was a big hit.  Per other reviews adhered to following suggestions.
Toast pecans at 300 for 10 mins
Half brown sugar 
Half white sugar
Don't grease pan, line with parchment paper -
Bake w/topping 30 mins - rotate halfway thru - When jiggles a lil but is mostly firm should be done
Cool 30 mins, fridge overnight

Made Substitutions.
I baked it on a 10 x 13 cookie sheet with sides & it barely fit when I pressed the crust really hard in the middle and sides to make a well for the pecan filling. Per other reviewers, I lined my pan with the new nonstick foil before pressing the crust in & it worked perfectly! I used 3 C. of pecan halves instead of 2.5 C. chopped, used half brown sugar instead of white (in both the crust and topping) & 1/2 cup of Thick n Rich real maple syrup (hard to get a hold of, but they use invert maple sugar which makes it almost as thick as corn syrup)to replace 1/2 cup of corn syrup. (You could probably get away with regular real maple syrup but I used Splenda brown for the brown sugar in the filling and was afraid I might not have enough stickiness if I used thin syrup.) I had watched a Test Kitchen episode where their final product contained maple syrup and brown sugar, hence my substitutions. I'm diabetic so that's why I replaced some of the sugar with Splenda. 

Anyway, I baked it about 45 minutes in a cooler (325 degree) oven until it was no longer jiggly. However, I did take it immediately to a super-cold surface in the garage (which serves as our secondary refrigerator in the winter.) It was about 40 degrees out there, so it didn't continue to cook much. Once cooled I stored it in the house at room temp because if you served it cold you might crack a tooth! :) 

The flavor was excellent! The flavor, texture and appearance were all quite lovely.

Whoooo baby, these are oh so yummy!  Like others, I scaled the recipe to 24 servings and used a 9x13-inch pan.  Used plenty of cooking spray and had no sticking problems.  I used all brown sugar in the crust since that's how I make my shortbread, and half white/half brown sugar in the filling.  Added a splash of maple extract to the filling and otherwise followed the directions as is.  Even used the same cooking times in the original recipe.  They were jiggly when I removed them from the oven but they set up beautifully -- no need to cook until they don't jiggle.  Oh, and I did toast the pecans in the oven ahead of time.  That's just standard practice for me.

I made these for a Thanksgiving desert, because a pecan pie just had too many calories. Now my inlaws expect me to bring to every get together. I've even made a batch for my daughter and her fiance to take home to North Carolina. Everybody loves them.

I made exactly as the recipe states.  These were very , very good.  They are quite heavy though so a tiny piece is all you need.  Very buttery and very sweet.  Since you only eat a small portion, I might want to play around with cutting the recipe in half because the big jelly roll pan makes quite a lot.

These bars are incredible.  I had to put them in another room so I would stop eating them.   I used parchment paper as...you have to use this!  Makes it soooo much easier!   Also, it takes much longer to cook then 25 mins.  I’m not sure if that was a typo in the recipe or not but I cooked mine for almost 60.  I used a 9 x 13 and will definately use a larger pan next time!  You won’t be disappointed.

Most important note:  use a jelly roll CAKE pan, not a jelly roll cookie sheet.  It needs to be deep enough to hold all of the yummy, chewy goodness of these bars.  Made as directed, cooked 25 min. And couldn't wait for them to cool completely.  Yum!  Better than my usual pecan pie, because I can cut them into bars and arrange on a platter, no one will know that I snatched quite a few before I served them!  Wasn't sure about using all white sugar in the filling, I think you could go with all white or half white, half brown.  Back to devouring these....

YUM!!! Love pecan pie but not the overly thick filling layer.  I love this shortbread crust (made with brown sugar and butter) and the thin layer of filling and lots and lots of pecans.  Awesome dessert...and easy on the budget and time.

I loved the bars... they turned out great! I cut them after 2 hours cooling and they were already set. I cooked them with 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar in the filling. They didn't even stick to the pan... I sprayed it with pam really well.

Everyone loved them! I made them for my son's party and even with everyone going back for seconds I still had a a ton to sent to work with my hubby the next day. I guess the guys were talking today and said it was my one of my best cookies ever. I added 1/2 cups chocolate chips just because I had them to finish up but otherwise followed the original directions perfectly.

I was looking for a replication of one of my old school favorites and found this one.  It turned out FANTASTIC! and was a big hit for Thanksgiving.  I did use a 9x13 dish instead and updated the servings to 24 and the bars were perfect.  I also added cinnamin and a dash of nutmet!

This was an excellant alternative to a pecan pie. And it's not as sicky sweet as a pie. This recipe got so many compliments. I lined my pan with foil and left the foil about 2 inches higher on the edges, then sprayed it and had no problem getting them out. I followed the directions exactly. I thought it looked like I baked it too long but it was great.

This is a winner.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out delicious.  My friends and coworkers love these bars.  Sometimes I drizzle dark chocolate over the top!  Pecan lovers beware!  You'll be addicted.

Absolutely awesome!  Very easy to make and fabulous!  Used a large jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper and clean up was a breeze.  Used butter instead of margerine and half brown sugar, half white sugar in the filling.  Other than that, followed the recipe.  This is the first of many times I'll be making these.

These are pretty good, I´m glad I tried the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except that I reduced sugar in filling to 1 and 1/4 cup. I also used half brown sugar-half white. They were still a bit too sweet for me, so maybe next time I would try just one cup sugar. The crust is nice and buttery, but I recommend evening and flattening it out really well because it rises a bit. I used wax paper to line the pan and it did the trick. Good recipe, very nice and rich. Definitely a keeper.**edit * I just made this again but using walnuts (toasted in oven for 10 min) and I decided to make little tarts instead of the bars. They were a bigger hit than the bars! I used a muffin tin very well greased with crisco and patted the crust all around, completely covering bottom and sides. Go crazy with the crisco or you will have a hard time getting them out. Beautiful presentation as gift or for guests. Thanks again for the recipe!

These were made for our Christmas baskets this year. I received rave reviews from all who received them. My only change to the recipe was to use butter instead of margarine. This recipe is is our new family favorite.

When I make a recipe, I rate it how the people I make it for like it. I used these bars in cookie gift plates this year. I am a pecan pie lover! but, I did not like the crust. The 9x13 pan makes the crust too thick and I was careful to press it into the pan.  I also followed the advice of others and used parchment paper. This helped with the sticking but as the bars were cooking, they did bubble a bit and the edges seemed to caramalize. As a result, I could not use the edges because they were too hard and chewy. If i make these again, I will use a bigger pan to spread the crust out a bit as well as the parchment paper.

YUMMY!!! These just came out of the oven and they are DELICIOUS! Good call on the parchment paper, this would have been a real mess had I not used it, and I took the advice of MEleanor and baked the crust for 20 mins and the full essembled bar for 40-45 mins.

Runny! Too much corn syrup in this recipe. I baked it until it was getting brown so could not have baked it longer, and yet it oozed syrup with every cut. Even after refrigeration. Tasty, but I would diminish the syrup by half a cup.

I did so many things wrong in this recipe, but it STILL came out delicious. My crust was a little thick because I used a smaller pan, and not all the sauce could fit on the top layer without overflowing. It just shows that the recipe is so good that it is fool proof. It's great for a beginner baker like myself. I would have liked it if the instructions were a little more detailed, but it still came out great!  I did end up baking it for a little longer to brown the pecans a little more.

I followed the previous suggestions of cutting the quantity down to 24 and using a 9x13 dish b/c I did not have a jelly roll pan. I cooked the bars for about 40 minutes (the original time was not nearly enough). These were delicious, and went super quick at our work potluck. I added some chocolate chips as others suggested, but there was no need, the bars were fantastic with just the reccommended ingredients. I will absolutely make these again!

These were so good. I used butter instead of margarine, and also cooked at 325 for 40 minutes, next time I will cook at 325 for 35 minutes, and I think it will make them perfect.

Like other reviewers, I scaled the recipe to 24 servings and used a 9x13" pan.  I also substituted butter for margarine.  I lined the bottom and sides of the pan with parchment, did not grease, and it all released easily with no mess. I found I needed to increase the second bake time from 25 minutes to 35 minutes.  The edges were just wonderfully toasty and chewy.  This is truly a treat; I like them better than pecan pie!  Thank you for posting the recipe.

This deserves more than 5 stars!! I followed the recipe but baked in a 10X13 (or is it 9X13?) baking dish. I realized while baking that other reviewers cut back on serving size to accomadate the smaller dish which i hadnt done. I was a lil worried that it wouldnt bake right but thankfully i didnt have any problems. It just took a lil longer to bake.These are soOoooOooo good =)

These are terrific.  Definitely make a day ahead so they can set up nicely.  Since they are very sweet, you can cut them into smaller bars and so the recipe goes a longggg way!  I used these on a dessert tray for Thanksgiving. People loved that they could have that pecan pie taste in just a few bites.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

I liked the ida of these and the taste was good but I had issues with the cooking times.  The crust took a lot longer to cook and the pecan filling part just wouldn't set and got over done on the edges and not done in the center.

My modifications:
1. Added 1/4 cup dark brown sugar
2. Added another tsp. of vanilla
3. Doubled pecans. Toasted, lightly

What I'd do next time:
Keep mods 1 & 2.
Add only 1/4 cup extra pecans and would chop them real fine. There's not enough filling and what filling there is is just too light and fluffy to handle many more pecans, imho. 

Even if you don't add more pecans, chop those puppys fine. :o)
I didn't and cutting slices was impossible. A wreck. I had to spoon it.

Nice flavor with mods 1 & 2.  Very simple and fast recipe too.

A very good pecan pie bar recipe.  It is quite different in taste from the one I am used to but I am glad I tried it.  I also cut the recipe to 24 servings and baked it in a 9X13 glass dish.  I baked it longer than the recipe called for maybe about 35 minutes.  I put it in the refrigerator after it cooled because I thought it was not going to set up.  I took it out of the frig the morning I served them and they were fine.  They taste just like pecan pie.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks to the other reviewer who suggested the changes I made.

2 words:  Big Mess!  I am learning very quickly to read these reviews before attempting anything!  These bars boiled over onto the bottom of the oven; it's a miracle the smoke alarms didn't go off!  I will definitely be using a 9x13 pan next time instead.  But they tasted great!  Now I'm off to clean the oven...

These Pecan Bars are so awesome!  I made these for my mom and brother.  I personally dont like pecans but I enjoyed making these very much.  I used people's advice and I baked the pecans first for 10 minutes at 300 degrees. It brought out the flavor more.  And then tossed them in a little butter, then add to filling mix.  I cut the recipe in half and then in half again because it was only my mom and brother eating it!  It was gone before the night was over...haha.. Enjoy!!!

Delicious! I made this 1st for Thanksgiving and already have many requests for Christmas. My only problem is that the filling ran over the edges of my jellyroll pan. My husband is in love, he said it is his new favorite treat.

They are very tasty ,but found them a little too sweet and for some reason very runny. I did not know if they were supposed to be that way or not. Unless I could cut down on the sweetness and make them so they would not be runny I probably will not make them again. Ally 2

We love pecan pie... and these bars are just as tasty!  Its nice that you can grab a smaller piece in lieu of a larger piece of pie & then you feel a little less guilty :)   I followed the recipe as written, except i did use butter &  1/2 brown sugar -1/2 white sugar for the filling only.  I also scaled the recipe back to 24  and used a Pam sprayed 13 x 9 glass dish.  Crust 20-25 min and filling 20 - 25.  Let cool, sliced easily and placed in lined cupcake holders to store - this made for super easy presentation for dessert.  Thank you for posting - This will become a holiday favorite I'm sure!!

I used butter instead of margarine. I also used honey instead of corn syrup.
The cooking time was close but needed another 5 minutes. 
They came out fantastic and everyone loved them.  There was not even one left!

I've made this recipe for many years now.  Always a hit!  My son-in-law looks forward to these every holiday season.  I do use real, unsalted butter instead of margarine. I use a stoneware jellyroll pan and ALWAYS line it with parchment paper.  If stacking bars on a platter, place parchment paper between layers to prevent bars from sticking to one another.

Absolutely delish! This is a major hit with my family at Thanksgiving and this is the second year in a row i've made it. So much easier than baking a pie, but yet it tastes just like the pie in a bar form. Just really grease the side of your pan and bake it on a Silpat lined pan. This year I cut the bar while it was still hot and left it alone until it was cool, then took them out. It seemed to be a little easier to get them out of the pan that way. One recipe was plenty for us all to have a few small pieces and even send some home with everyone. I cut them fairly small because they are really sweet. Great recipe!!!!

Very good but VERY sweet! Followed the recipe except for swapping butter for margarine; next time I'll cut the sugar in half and see if that helps. These would be just as good if a little less sweet!

This is delicious!  It has been a big hit wherever I take it.  I make the crust in the food processor.  I line my buttered jelly roll pan with parchment paper that comes up on all sides.  I also butter the parchment paper.

These are delicious and everyone who's tasted them has loved them.  But they made a big mess in my oven because the 10x15 jelly roll pan was not large enough.  The sticky topping cooked over so I had it all over the outside of the pan and some had spilled onto my oven before I smelled it burning and could manage to get a larger pan underneath it to catch the mess.  If you're going to make these, either use a larger pan or reduce the servings so using the pan specified in the recipe will work.  If not, be prepared for A LOT of cleanup.  I would have given it 5 stars if I hadn't had the issue with the pan.  I used real butter but didn't change anything else. 

UPDATE:  I added another star after using an 11x17 jelly roll pan, the recipe worked much better.  No mess in the oven and they still taste great.

I wasn't crazy about how the crust turned out, but the filling was great. Being a "butter tart" aficionado, I used brown sugar for the filling instead of white. Everyone loved it.

Prepared these exactly according to the recipe and they are addictive.   Made them at Christmas instead of pecan pie; servings were smaller than a slice of pie and perfect for sampling when there are so many dessert choices.  Perfect as written, wouldn't change a single ingredient.

I tried this recipe for a dessert to make for the family. It makes a lot but it tastes really good and it's easy. When I made it I had to run to the store to get the corn syrup. It's nice to add 1/2 cup whole pecans in too, but if you do know that when your done it makes it a little hard to cut when done.

I tried this recipe instead of doing a pie this year.  It was a huge hit with friends and family!  I have already made it twice and am making it again.  I do roast the pecans first for 20 minutes at 300 to enhance the flavor.

This came out perfect.  Followed the recipe to the T; no overflows and didn't cut back on anything. I used some of the tips that were posted such as toasting my pecans and using brown sugar in the filling. I think this is even better than the Pecan pie!

This turned out really good! I rated it a 4 as written, but my husband would say 5 with changes. They are as follows...

I used a roasting pan... About the same size as my jelly roll pan, but higher sides. 
Parchment paper.... Can't imagine this recipe without it
Used 1/3 whole wheat flour, adds more texture to the shortbread and a tiny bit of better nutrition
Kept the pecans whole
And the biggest and most important.......I added two cups of fresh cranberries. 

The cranberry addition makes it - cuts through the sweetness perfectly.

Tastes good after trimming outside dry edges off. Just can't understand why, if you use the pan size called for, that a cup of filling overflows?  I will definelty use a 11x17 jelly roll pan next time for better results.

These were simply awesome - I did half brown sugar in the filling and used foil, I pull the foil out of the pan right when the came out of the oven and kind of separated the bars.  The were still a little soft in the middle, but firmed up nicely when cooled.  Delicious.

I just made these today and am very disappointed in them.   They are not thick enough and moist enough for my liking.   I found them a bit too dry.  I did follow the recipe exactly with the exception of using half brown sugar and half white sugar and I used butter rather than margarine as another viewer suggested.   I would suggest not baking them for as long as it says -  25 minutes seems too long.   I used my large pampered chef bar pan as some one else had suggested.

I made these for the first time and they are amazing!  The only change I made was to use the light version of Karo syrup - the one without the high fructose corn syrup.  They are plenty sweet and rich, anyway.  I will definitely make these again.

Yes I tried this recipe. I was not happy with it all. The crust has too much flour and it tasted dry. The topping was good. When cooking this recipe keep an eye on it because the topping will burn if not watched. The crust needs more butter and sugar.

Great recipe!  Just use the tips offered by the caterer.  Everything he said is exactly dead on!
Use disposable tin pans and double the cooking time of the "goo"  and this recipe rocks!

Probably the BEST thing I have ever made! I did follow one other reviewer and was caution of the amount of baking time of the filling. Mine took around 32 mins. Just make sure that there is a slight jiggle to the center and that's it. I also added a 1/2 bag of semi-sweet chocolat chips.
I ran out of corn syrup and the crust was almost out of the oven so I had to improvise by using about a 1/4 cup of maple pancake syrup. I think it only added to the awesome flavors of this recipe. It is even better then pecan pie!

This needs to be done in a smaller pan instead of a big cookie sheet.  Husband loved it but I like more of a pecan pie filling...  So cooking it in a smaller pan would help a lot!

I scaled the recipe down to 24 servings as I did not have enough pecans on hand for the full recipe. The crust was was fine and the filling set up nice. The taste was good but not great. My complaint was that it really wasn't sweet enough for a pecan bar and something was missing as far as the taste. Additionally, having scaled down the recipe, i made it in an 8 x 12 and it came out very thin. I would absolutely make the full recipe in a 9 x13 or 8 x 12. No larger than that unless you want a very thin bar.

After reviewing others comments, I too changed the serving size to 24; using 3 eggs.  In addition I used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar for the filling. I used real butter throughout the recipe :) Thank you Marieta, I will add this to my regular collection of treats!

I really would rate these at a 3/4 because I have trouble getting them to come out right but Im totally sure that is my fault.  Even if I mess them up these taste amazing!  I always add mini chocolate chips, not sure if thats messing it up or not.  Other than that I just have trouble cooking them right.  Sometimes they are still runny, sometimes very hard.  I have the same problem with pecan pies.  So I know its me but what am I missing?  Is there a trick to knowing when they are done!?!?  I would love to know because these and chocolate pecan pie are probably my favorite dessert!

I made this for my husband's office once, and for a moim's group another time, and it was such a hit!  I don't even like pecans, and I love this! I did it in my big jelkt rooll pan with a lid, so I didn't even need to take it out of the pan to serve.  It was plenty for a big group.  I'll probably make it again for church some time.  I added some toffee chips the second time, as suggested by someone pre iously.  I don't know that I could even tell, honestly.  I chopped my nuts really fine, since I don't like them, and it worked great.

Made these for family reunion this summer and they were a huge hit.  An aunt was asking everybody who made those.  I was actually one of the last people she asked.  LOL

Makes a big batch of squares.  Nice shortbread crust.  I had to bake mine 10 minutes longer.  Set up nicely and easy to cut after a couple hours.  Next time I will use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white.

I made these bars for this last Thanksgiving and they were chewy yummy goodness. I should have taken notes on exactly what changes I made, but I do remember cutting down on the sugar a bit so I didn't sweet everyone out.

These were amazing! I made them in a 9x13 glass pyrex pand, and sprayed the bottom AND sides with non-stick spray, and I had no issues with sticking! I wish I had doubled the recipe because they were gone quick and everyone was asking for more. Thanks for a great addition to my recipe box!

These are fantastic. This was the first time I made this type of bar so when the crust came out of the oven for the first time I thought I had messed up because I had envisioned looking more like a pie crust. But after adding the pecan mix and baking it it turned out perfect. I baked mine in a 9x13 inch pan and lined it with foil to make it easier to cut into bars. They were a huge hit at Thanksgiving and I already have orders in for them for Christmas.

I made these for Thanksgiving this year, and not only did everyone gush about them, people who didn't like pecan pie tried and enjoyed them too.  I didn't change the recipe, but I question the need for so much sugar.  I may try reducing the sugar used in the filling next time.  Also, in our oven, the middle didn't stop jiggling until roughly 20 additional minutes baking time.

Made these for an early Thanksgiving dinner last week because I have been craving pecan pie!  I decided to do bars this year that taste like our favorite pies and desserts so everyone could have a little square of each without being overly full! I cut down to 24 servings and used a 9x13 lined with parchment.  This made for really easy cutting/cleanup!  For the crust, I did as other reviewers did and used half white/brown sugar.  I also used real butter for a true shortbread flavor.  I also used 3/4 c. dark and 3/4 c. light corn syrup in the filling for richness and also used real butter.  Used whole pecans, which I did not toast, they had nice toasted flavor from baking.  Excellent-will never go back to pie because I loved the shortbread crust!  I am sure I will make these often because I love pecan pie!

These were so good!  I made a 12 serving dish - which turned out to be an 8x8 baker - and am so glad I did.  I made no changes except the 1/2 brown sugar substitute in the crust.  Will definitely be making again!!!!!

Yum!  I only had 1/2 cup corn syrup and 1 1/2 cups pecans.  So I added 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips.  YUM.  Baked exactly as written and came out perfect.  Chewy and moist and delicious.  Thanks very much!!!

I didn't understand this recipe at all at first, but then realized I was making a shortbread type crust (can you tell I'm not a baker?).  Anyway, this recipe is out of this world.  Soooo easy, and even more delicious than easy!  This is a treat that I will make over and over again!

these were just okay. definitely not what i was expecting. i've made pecan pie a couple times before without a problem, i assumed this would be a more portable version of that with more crust. ehhh... the crust wasnt even that great. i used white sugar, and it just seemed like there was waaaay to much flour in there. would prob use butter instead next time, and also light brown sugar. the topping barely resembled pecan pie. the corn syrup and sugar congealed into straightup caramel, and the pecans just rested on top, looking glazed. in order to salvage this creation i melted two ghirardelli milk chocolate + hazelnut bars and drizzled them over the top. the result: happy coworkers. but everyone said it tasted like those russel stover turtle chocolates.. with a crust. it wasnt terrible, but i wouldnt call it a pecan pie bar...

People LOVE LOVE LOVE these!!!!!  I don't actually like pecans or pecan pie much so I don't eat them, but I ended up making them 3 times just over the holidays because people liked them so much.  The general consensus is that they taste like pecan pie but better.  People also liked the edge pieces that get a little crunchy.  You could win a contest with these!!

Great recipe with the suggestions of several reviewers.  Used 1/2 white, 1/2 light brown sugar in the filling and butter instead of margarine in the base and filling.  Baked 45 minutes, cooled 30 min.  Covered and placed in refrigerator overnight. Sliced next day.  Layered pieces in rectangular plastic bowl with wax paper between the layers and they come out moist and tender. Perfect!

Given I was not familiar at all with this recipe, I followed it to a T (well, except for using butter).  AMAZING!  Was afraid of it being overly sweet but it wasn't.  I did make quite a mess with overflow which I think can be avoided if I hung the parchment paper/foil over the sides.

Made these for the first time today, for Christmas.  The taste was great and it was easier than anything to put together, but I found after following another cook's suggestion of making 24 instead of 36 and using a 9 x 13 pan, they didn't set after 25 minutes of baking.  I baked them for about 5 minutes longer and I had to cut the edges off them because they went hard.  All in all though, I would make them again...very good!

These pecan pie bars were amazing and a nice change from pecan pie.  I used finely chopped pecans and bigger pieces of pecans too.  Let them cool completely and they will pop right out of the pan.  A big hit at Thanksgiving!

These are to die for! I followed the tip to use parchment paper to keep the filling from spilling over the 10x15 inch jellyroll pan. I did not grease the parchment. It worked like a charm and the bars came off the parchment easily. I think I did cook them a little too long as the middle did not move at all when I took them out of the oven. I kept them in  a little while after the time indicated on the recipe, so next time I will stick to the recipe instructions. I let them cool completely, then lifted the whole thing out of the jellyroll pan by the parchment paper and placed it on my kitchen table to cut into bars. I took them to a church function where there were lots of other cookies, and they were gone in a flash. I got many compliments and a request for the recipe. I will definitely be making these again.

Pretty good. I found 25 minutes of baking the filling plenty of time. My oven does cook a bit hotter though.

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were fantastic and way better than any pecan pie I've had. I did adjust a few things as some of the other reviewers did.  I reduced the servings to 24, used a 9x13 pan, and also used half white and half brown sugar for the filling.  I baked the crust for 18 minutes and then the filling part for 25.  I let them cool on the counter, then covered and put in the fridge for the next day.  I then cut them with the pizza cutter, put in a tupperware and took them out just prior to serving.  Perfect and very well set up.  A definite keeper!

Excellent. I used 9x13 pan for a thicker crust but my hubby said too thick (I thought yummy, depends on what you like). Brought to pot luck and they went FAST! Got lots of compliments.

Used 1/2 margarine & 1/2 unsalted butter (because that's what I had on hand) and I think that the crust turned out perfect.  Also used Vanilla Butter & Nut Extract in the filling.  Everyone loved these and demanded I make them again for the next family gathering.

Wonderful recipe.  I made for a Christmas party and got lots of compliments.  It's like the pie, but with a thicker crust.  My husband loved them!

These were awesome! It was my first attempt at any pecan pie like dessert. To fit into a 9x13 glass dish, I cut the recipe to 24 servings. (Used 3 eggs not 2 3/4) The bake time and temp were perfect for me.  I used a very generous amount of non-stick spray, and these popped out perfectly. I did make sure to go up the sides of the dish with the crust. When I took these out, the center was jiggly, but it set later on in the day.  Easy and a huge success for me :) :)

Excellent!  I've been making these for a few years and they are always well received.  They are nicer to serve than a pecan pie and the shortbread crust makes them much tastier!  I suggest lining your pan with parchment paper and spraying with a non-stick spray.  Otherwise, the filling always leaks and getting the bars out of the pan is very difficult.

Super delicious recipe, but makes too much for 1 pan. My pan would have overflowed, so I ended up with 1 for holidays and 1 for the family (which I don't mind....DELICIOUS!). I also agree with the commenter who said it needs a litle extra time cooking after 20 minutes. Just cook until the middle is slightly jiggly.

Made it exactly as directed and it came out great. Used a 10x15 high quality roasting pan and for some reason clean up was very very easy (not complaining). Next time I will try 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar. But truly delicious!

I didnt have a jelly roll pan, so i scaled the recipe down to 24 servings and used an 11x13'' pan. I used real butter instead of margarine as I do in every recipe. I also used brown sugar instead of white in the topping.  I made the mistake of going with other reviews and baking it for longer. It was too dry. I would recommend cooking for the 25 minutes. From there you will be able to tell if it needs to bake longer. I made the mistake of setting my timer for 35 minutes and not checking it. You want to pull it out of the oven when the center is still jiggly.  Also, I think the crust needs a little more butter. It seemed very dry and floury after it was done. But overall, it is a very good recipe!

Was easy to make and tasted good. My coworkers raved. I'm thinking no need to make 4 pecan pies at Thanksgiving everyone gets a box of squares.

These were good, but very very sweet! I used 3 cups of pecan pieces, otherwise I followed the recipe as stated.  Next time I will make these in my 13x9 pan as other reviewers suggested.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this recipe, not too overwhelmingly sweet like some pecan bars can be.  I used dark corn syrup because I had it and butter rather than margarine because I had it, it was great but next time I will follow the recipe exactly to see what it is like in original form.  Thanks!

I decided to try this recipe for my office cookie exchange and as a novice baker I found this extremely easy to make! I followed the recipe for the most part to a 'T' with the exception of using butter instead of margarine and brown sugar in the filling instead of white. The advised baking times were bang on. Although, after the first batch I started taking them out 5 minutes sooner and batches 2-4 came out with the creamy consistency I was looking for. Word to the wise - this is definitely not for those on a diet and can become slightly habit forming, so make with caution! Great recipe!

These are outstanding. I used dark corn syrup as that was what I had on hand. Subbed 1/2 cup brown sugar for white per other reviewers. Lastly, I used real butter versus margarine. I'm not sure why one would use margarine in a dish this rich. I prefer my oil and water in a salad. lol. Overall, a big hit for thanksgiving. Thankfully, there are leftovers which I just enjoyed while writing this. Will definitely make these again for special occasions only due to the amount of sugar and butter involved. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Used butter instead of margarine.  Used 1/2 brown sugar Karo and 1/2 dark karo for the corn syrup.  Used 1/2 dark brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  These turned out wonderful, had to fight off my husband just for the tasting one (saving the rest for tomorrow) and he doesn't even like pecan pie!!  Thank you so much for this recipe.

This is a great recipe and everyone always asks for these.  I cook the crust first, then add chocolate chips to them and let them melt and spread it, then the rest of the recipe.  It's great with chocolate!

These were so good!  Better the first day as top was a bit crunchy, after that they got a bit soft.  I halved the recipe and made it in a 9x12 food service type jelly roll pan.  I was running out of sugar so I used about 1/4 C brown sugar to substitute for some of the white.

These were excellent! I changed the recipe to only make 24, and cooked in a 9 by 13 glass pan. I sprayed it with cooking spray, and they came out no problem! I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar, and I also used twice the pecans called for because we loooove pecans. The crust was pretty thick; next time I make them, I'll probably half it for less of a doughy taste and more of the delicious topping. I think I cooked them about 5 minutes too long because they weren't quite as gooey as I'd hoped for, but hey, my mistake! They DEFINITELY get better the longer they're around. We finished up the pan on the third day, and that's when they were at their best. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I didn't have a 10x15 pan on hand, so I took the advice of another reviewer and made 2/3 the recipe (24 servings) in a 9x13 glass pan, using 3 eggs.  They smelled amazing baking and the filling is delicious--just like a classic pecan pie, but a LOT easier.  I did have to add about 10 minutes onto the baking time till the filling set completely, but that was probably because I changed the recipe's proportions.  I made these today for a party tomorrow and sampled the bars while plating them...I hope everyone likes them as much as I do!

Yum, I had to use 1/2 cup honey, because I didn't have enough corn syrup. I think the only change the honey did was make it a little chewier. Great taste!

This is a great recipe and a nice alternative to pecan pie. Very rich, with a buttery crust. I also used half brown sugar in the filling and that worked great. I noted another reviewer's comment about a longer baking time, though my time was not quite as long. It might have to do with actual oven temp, so I'd say check at 25 minutes and then every few minutes after that..otherwise it could quickly get overdone. Mine took about 35 minutes and it was perfectly done.

Wow was this good!  I don't even like pecan pie but I made these for Thanksgiving because it looked easier and my family likes pecan pie.  I tried a small piece and WOW!  I will definitely make these again.  They were a huge hit.  Like the other reviews stated, I scaled the recipe down to 24 servings and made this in a 9x13 pan.  Used lots of no stick spray and they came out of the pan no problem.

I've made these bars twice and I'm still not sure they're a good substitute for Pecan Pie.  The first batch "boiled over" in my oven, so the second time through I cut the flour to 2-1/2 cups.  The mixture stayed in the pan, but the edges were still over-cooked.  I did have requests for the recipe, though.

I didn't have enough pecans so I added chopped walnuts to make up the difference.  It turned out great.  I brought these to a party at the school where I work and they were a big hit.  I used butter instead of margarine for a better flavor.

5* for taste, but inspite of extra baking time, my filling did not set up, filling was all runny. Used a 10x13 pan, otherwise followed the directions exactly. Had a great taste.

This recipe tasted really good.  My only problem was that it seemed like there was too much crust--my pecan layer got a little messy because there wasn't enough room after I had the crust in the pan. I even measured the pan...next time I'll either use a bigger pan or I won't put all the crust mixture in.

These turned out really great, much to my surprise!  I substituted a half cup of maple syrup and honey since I ran out of Karo syrup, and it added more diverse flavor.

These bars taste wonderful and once cooled, they cut beautifully. My only problem with them was that in a 10x15 pan, they ran over the edges and made a mess of my oven. The sticky goop was enough to make me throw away my cookie sheet! Use a larger pan, or less filling. I did not use all of my filling and they still ran over.

Awesome!!!!  I did have to bake mine in a 9x13 pan but it still was wonderful.  My husband said, "That pecan stuff isn't too bad."  That's a top compliment from him.  I plan to make this for a Thanksgiving get together.

This was good, but not as good as pecan pie.  I was disappointed in the crust.  It was too thick and "flourey" tasting.  The filling was nice. Made it for a club meeting in my home.  There was a lot left over.  The ladies much preferred the pumpkin cream cheese dessert from this site.

WOW!!  These are very good.  I made the mistake of being too eager and slicing into them when they were still warm (out of the oven for an hour).  They were so runny I thought there was no way they would stiffen up.  Somehow they did.  I recommend making them a day of two ahead of time, they seem to get better with age.

These were really good. I liked having pecan pie in bar form.  I did find, however, that I needed to cook the crust much longer than specified in the recipe so that it didn't taste raw. And since this was my first time making them the edges got really chewy since I cooked them longer to get the crust right. Otherwise, very tasty.

These were really SOO good.  Made them for a family dinner get-together and although none of the kids touched them (there were 3 other desserts) the adults--and especially Grandpa--loved them!  I added a few pecans because I thought it seemed too saucy.

This is excellent.  My son says they are for him and me only.  He wants me to hide them from everyone else.  My 5 year old granddaughter wants to know when I am going to make them again.  A recipe anyone can make but watch the cooking time it can become too crusty.

These bars have an excellent flavor. I made them for Christmas brunch instead of pecan pie and they were a hit. However,  I was only able to serve the bars in the center because the outer edge was over baked and hard. I baked in a 9x13 dish and added 15 minutes baking time as many reviews suggested,  but that was too long.  I will make these again,  but follow the instructions for baking more closely.

This is a very good recipe; however, I did follow the suggestion of others and used butter vs. margarine/shortening for the crust - which was very tasty.  It was too much for a 9x13 pan; however. My family enjoyed it.. I did struggle to get it out the pan; will use a silicone liner (or similar) next time.

My family loved these. 
The first batch was a little gooey so I cooked the second batch lower and slower.  The texture was much better, just like pecan pie.
The other thing to know is it makes a lot!

I make 6 different cookies every Christmas and all anyone remembers are these pecan bars! This recipe is easy and fool proof. Just add at least 10 minutes to the last baking time. I made double this year they are such a hit. Thank you!

Great recipe! I use a brown sugar/white sugar mix as well. I have also played around with dark corn syrup and white corn syrup. The one con to this is that it DOES NOT BAKE IN 25 MIN. Don’t pull it out until it is completely set. Otherwise, good recipe. I make it all the time.

I agree that everything is better with butter, but this is a great dairy-free recipe and there are so few dessert recipes I can say that about.  I used Country Crock's "plant butter" sticks which is made with plant-based oils, e.g., canola, palm and olive oil.  You can substitute a stick of the non-diary butter with a stick of regular butter but do not try to substitute with the non-dairy plant-based spreads.  Similar to previous reviewers, I also used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, and cooked for about 40 minutes.  Enjoy!

These were delish!  The only problem I had was the baking time - it took much longer than described to set in the middle, around double the cooking time.  These were delicious as is, and were devoured.  Next time, I may add semi-sweet chips to half of them for my choc-a-holics.  Easy and VERY tasty!

These were delicious! I used half brown sugar, half white sugar. The only problem I had was I baked the bars for about 52 minutes and they were still under done in the middle, so I cut pieces from the edges and didn’t bring the middle pieces to Thanksgiving. I put parchment on the bottom and sprayed the sides, which worked pretty well.

I have made this twice and it is wonderful.  Every one loved it.  The only change that I made was to leave out the sugar in the crust.  It is very sweet and I didn’t miss that sugar at all.

Very good. Only thing i changed was I added 1 cup more pecans because when i spread out the filling there were bare spots with no pecans so it needed more.  Great substitute for pecan pie.

Giving 4 stars because it needs longer baking time. I generally read reviews before I get started, unfortunately I just jumped into this one last night. Went to cut them this morning and everything in the middle was runny. Super bummed, because I am taking them to a luncheon today, only plated the edges. Looking forward to trying it again with longer cook time. I like the suggestion in the top review to cook until only slight movement remains. Wish I had known that. O-well, they are still yummy.

I took the advice of several people and substituted in some brown sugar for the white. I also extended the baking time. It turned out well, but it was really hard to cut when chilled. Next time I will also go with my first instincts and sub maple syrup for some of the corn syrup.

As a pecan pie lover, I couldn't wait to make these. They were, simply put, soooo good. My finicky teenaged daughter thought they were out of this world too.  Like other reviewers mentioned, there's a moment of panic when you're cutting in the butter and you think it's too dry and won't come together. Have faith. It will become a buttery, shortbread-like base for the bar. The reason I knocked 1 star off the rating is because of the bake time and instructions to "bake until set." Even using other commenters' suggestions, this was hard for me to tell. It looked underdone/jigglyafter checking a couple of times, so I kept baking until it looked "set." The edges were so overdone they had to be trimmed off. They were chewy but okay  the first day, but  by the next day, they were harder to eat. I will definitely make these again, but I will keep experimenting with the proper baking time.

These look tasty and are tasty! My research shows there are three types of chopped pecans; large pieces, medium pieces, and small pieces.  I found a company in Texas  that sells large pieces which is great for this recipe.  Another added touch is replacing some of the all-purpose flour with pecan meal (flour) to enrich its flavor and cut down on the gluten.

So good and easy! Made these for work and everyone loved them. Lined the pan with foil and sprayed with cooking spray and didn't have any problems with sticking. Like others, I substituted half brown sugar for the white and added an extra cup of pecans.

Really delicious! I use this recipe for my customers at the bake shop I work at. I used butter instead of margarine, and added 1/4 tsp of salt in the filling, for a little balance from the sugar.  I have received positive feedback from my customers enjoying this pecan bar.

I never use margarine, always butter. Other than that I have mostly followed the recipe for years. I bake the base for only 15 mins, just a personal preference. This year I added an extra cup of pecans, and a shake of cinnamon to the cookie base. It was probably just a 1/4 tsp. It wasn’t obvious, just a slightly warmer flavor. Yum! Everyone wants to take some home after Christmas or Thanksgiving dinner!

This is now the only thing I’m “required” to bring to holiday gatherings!  I’ve altered a bit over the years, and it’s wonderful every time! 

I bake the crust about 25-30 min, until it’s crusty? I use a 10 x 15 dish. Pack it really tight. For the filling I use light & dark corn syrup (half and half) and also mix brown & white sugar. I cook the second time for close to 30 min, everyone loves the caremelized edge pieces!  I get 48 pieces. 

Thanks for sharing this! Sure saves me having to make 3 pecan pies each holiday!

I have made this exactly according to recipe, and it was delicious.

My daughter made these for a church bake-off and won first place.

Yes, both times there was a little caramelized filling stuck to the side of the pan (we used a nonstick jellyroll pan as specified).  But they mostly came out clean.

So, they're really good.

These were very good.  I used the crust recipe from another viewer which contained powdered sugar but otherwise made the recipe as written.  They had the filling texture similar to pie, which was what I was looking for.  These made a very large pan full.

Please qualify my 4 star review, as I used 3/4 cup each white and brown sugar in the filling. Otherwise cooked as written. 

I'v enever made a pie shell or this type of dough, so I wish there was a better explanation of that process. "Cutting in butter" doesn't mean much to me, and tutorials online didn't show what I should expect the dough in this recipe to look like when I'd done enough cutting. Also there was no indication of how "done" the crust should be when first cooked. I cooked it 20 minutes, but had no idea whether that was enough (should it be golden, still white, what?).

Cooked with filling another 33 minutes until only center seemed to jiggle. Tasted good, not fantastic. But I don't eat many pecan pies so I don't have a lot to compare to. I thought it would have a bit more flavor than it has - mine came out just a bit bland. I may make this again.

Made this based on 24 servings and used a 9x13 pan.  Sub half the sugar for the filling with brown sugar.  Next time I will cut the sugar down in the filling as suggested by some (cut down 1/3?).  Used butter instead of margarine. Used 3 eggs.  Added a pinch of salt with the pecans and syrup.  Cut into small squares as even one is very rich.  Lined pan with parchment paper and didn't spray.

These are amazing, and I don't really like pecan pie. I made them for a cookie exchange because I had all the ingredients. I lined a 12x18 pan with parchment paper and used half brown sugar like many suggested.  These give you the great flavor of pecan pie without too much of the gooey corn syrup filling. My hubby suggested adding coconut to them next time.

Update- I took these to a cookie exchange, and they were voted best tasting!! Thanks for sharing!!

First of all this will not fit in the recommended pan. Second the crust is extremely bland.  Third the cook time is way off. Resulting in a BAD recipe.

These were so delicious and easy to make. I substituted the margarine for coconut oil in the crust and butter instead of margarine for the filling. Great in cupcake papers!

Made this in lieu of our traditional pecan pie, as we were celebrating Thanksgiving in southern Italy with our daughter & her family. The guest list ballooned from 6 to 20, and I had only brought limited supplies from the states for a pie, since they don’t know what white Karo syrup is in Italy - and pecans are scarce & very expensive. I used a 12 x 14 foil pan, based on a couple of the other reviewers and buttered it thoroughly. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written, including cooking times, with the exception of half brown sugar and half white for the filling, also as suggested in several of the reviews I read. I was glad I checked on the cooking time after 25 minutes, as it would have been burnt if I’d left it in any longer. It was the hit of the day & Italians attending all asked for the recipe. The sad part was I had to tell them without Karo, it wouldn’t be the same. I may have found a new business - shipping Karo to southern Italy, LOL!!  Thanks for a great recipe that I will definitely use again - so much easier and more portable than traditional pecan pie!

The finished product was not pretty, but I salvaged what I could. I have three jelly roll pans, none the exact size called for, made the recipe in the smallest I had. #1-Noticed after baking the crust it had cracked. #2- while in the oven with pecan filling added, the liquid ran to the edges, leaving the nuts in the middle without much filling. To cut the cooled bars, I had to use heavy pressure to cut and take each square up from the pan. I will give credit to the one submitting this recipe, as my pan was a little larger than recommended and my oven got a little hot.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars as written.  I think my crust needed to bake longer in the oven as the middle was still kind of soggy when I went to cut them but that's on me. The only thing I did differently was add some salt to the pecan mixture as it was WAY too sweet for my taste. Other than that it was a pretty easy recipe and the finished product was delicious.

I have made these several times for holidays and special occasions, and they always get rave reviews. The way that the recipe is written, I would probably give 4 stars. I’ve made a couple of alterations over the years that make these 5-star worthy. The most important is USE BUTTER, not margarine. I do also usually cut the amount of sugar down from 1.5 cups to 1 cup because the corn syrup adds so much sweetness, and I like to use brown sugar instead of white. I even accidentally forgot sugar entirely one time and they were still plenty sweet! I buy bags of pecan halves or pecan pieces and don’t chop them any smaller. I don’t have a jelly roll pan, so I usually use a 13x9 cake pan, and they still come out great. I sometimes have to bake for a little longer since they do come out thicker that way, but I like them a bit thicker anyway. These are one of my favorite desserts and they’re pretty simple to put together!

I've made this numerous times and get asked for the recipe  repeatedly -even by people who don't love pecan pie. Use Reynolds nonstick foil and you will have no sticking problems. No spraying or buttering, lifts right out of the pan. You can use a 9 x 13 pan, the ingredients divide by 2/3 except the eggs (just use 3). Substitute brown sugar for the white sugar in the filling. Cook til the filling hardly jiggles,  ovens vary and over cooking them makes them less rich and gooey. Chill a little after cooling to facilitate cutting into squares. Use a serrated knife to saw thru the Pecans, then you can press down vertically thru the crust.  This will keep the squares nice and tidy without any "smoshing'. I think chocolate makes everything better but this recipe doesn't need choc chips. Thx so much for this recipe!

Was really great, served a large crowd. Although not as good as pecan pie. Changed recipe as follows: used whole wheat flour instead of regular, used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar as suggested by other reviewers, left out the margarine in filling also to be healthier, used dark Karo syrup instead of light just because I already had dark in cupboard. I would make this again to feed a large crowd.

I took a previous bakers advice and cut the servings down from 36 to 24 to use a 9x13 pan.  The only other substitution I made was honey for the corn syrup.  It was fully cooked in 40 minutes

These are awesome - the taste of pecan pie, but in smaller bites (and therefore fewer calories)!  The only change I made in ingredients was the use of dark Karo syrup, but only because I ran out of light.  I changed the servings from 36 to 24 and baked it in a 9x13" pan.  I also used parchment paper to line the pan, so had no problems with sticking (used my pizza cutter to cut into bars). Loved the flavor of a shortbread crust with the pecan topping!

I will make this again! I actually didn't taste this, I don't care for sweets, but my husband, and son loved them. I set out a quarter of the pan for eating whenever, a quarter in fridge for holidays (made a week before thanksgiving) and the rest in the freezer. My husband ate all from counter and fridge and my son was eating them straight out of freezer and said, "don't tell dad these are in here". A week before Xmas and I am going to make more and just put them all in freezer. 

I followed the recipe but highly reccomend using a pan you don't mind ruining or parchment paper. These are tough little buggers to cut.

Love this recipe. I used a 12x12 cake pan with parchment paper, mixed brown & white sugar for the filling, and added maybe 3/4cup of toffee bits. The vanilla flavor & scent was very strong, so I might reduce that when I make it again. Great recipe!

Made these gluten-free and they turned out great. Only changes made to the recipe:  Substituted gluten free flour for the regular flour  and shortened the cooking time by about 8 minutes.  Everybody loved them and couldn't tell they were gluten free!!

This was a great recipe. The only complaint I have is the jelly roll pan was too small for all the ingredients. I used a 11 x 16 which was even larger then the recommended size in the recipe. Be sure to put foil down at the bottom of your oven and be prepared for smoke. It will bubble over.  Other then that it was delicious!

Nice time saver around the holidays. I made this for Thanksgiving. I didn't want the oven mess like so many others noted, so I used my big "lasagna 10x12" pan. I sprayed it well, but wish I would have also lined with parchment as it did get a bit sticky in places. I also use butter and should have baked the crust only 15 minutes - mine got a bit overbaked. I had enough filling and baking time start checking at 20 min. I did mine 30 and it could have benefitted taking out at 25 as recipe directs. YUMMY.

We all loved it!  I made mine gluten free and dairy free and it was a huge hit.  I followed the exact same recipe just changing the flour to be a gluten free flour and using dairy/soy free butter substitute.  Nobody could tell that it was modified and loved it!  This was the 2nd time I made it and everyone is asking me to make it again.

Loved it and so did my family members who never eat pecan pie!  I did substitute butter for the margarine only because I despise margarine...if you do, just keep an eye on the crust as butter burns faster . Use baking parchment in the pan because the pecan mixture flows over and is very very sticky....easier cleanup.

These were a big hit! Their texture is fabulous and they taste delicious. I did use butter instead of margarine. Also, I ran out of light corn syrup with 1/4 c left to go, so I added 1/4 c. of maple syrup which if anything, enhanced the flavor. People are asking for the recipe, and it will become a holiday regular for me.

This is so good, but way too sweet.  I reduced both the light corn syrup and sugar to 1 cup each.  Also, I use butter, not margarine.  People ask me for this recipe whenever I make it.  Excellent, with the changes.

Yum! Pecan pie in  bar form! I made these in a 11x16 pan (I was making them for a church supper). There was plenty of crust for this size, but if I make it this big again, I'll double the filling. My pecans were frozen, so I put them in the oven to toast a little while the crust was cooking.  I followed the recipe with the the exception of  substituting 1/2 cup of brown with the white in the filling. And the directions say use a full CUP of (softened) butter when the ingredients say 3 TBS! I had to cook it for about 30 minutes to get it completely set.

This is the second time I have made these. The taste is wonderful however the first time I made them I put them in the 10x15 jelly roll pan as mentioned in the recipe and had filling all over the bottom of my oven! Luckily I have a silicone liner!
This time I used the larger (11 1/2x 17 1/4) and it is much better. Not sure how anyone that used the smaller pan didn't have the mess in their oven. That said, my husband loves them!

Yum!  I made 2 batches today.  The first batch I made exactly as the recipe - except my daughter called just before the crust came out of the oven, so it cooled for 15 minutes or so before I poured the topping over it.  OH!  And I used dark Karo instead of light.  I made it on a 15x17 cookie sheet that I sprayed liberally with Pam and cooked  them for an extra 6 minutes, jiggling the pan every 3 minutes until they were pretty well set.  As they were cooling I ran a sharp knife around the edge of the pan to help loosen them.  It took a firm hand and sharp knife, but when they were completely cooled they cut and released from the pan beautifully.  AND, they are Delicious!  For the 2nd pan, I used a 9x13 cookie sheet and used the website adjuster.  It made a little too much crust and topping.  The topping spilled over as it baked even though I didn't use it all.  And this time I used about 3/4 cup combined of light and dark Karo and finished with maple syrup.  I was scrounging since I didn't realize 1 1/2 cups is just about a whole bottle.  The 2nd pan also turned out great.  Good recipe!

Everyone loved these.  I baked them for 1-2 minutes longer and added a few extra nuts.  I used butter instead of margarine.  Easy to make and delicious.

I don't like pecans so didn't eat them but my family absolutely loved them. I would suggest putting something to catch the overflow in the oven, what a mess they made :)

I absolutely loved this! I made it exactly as directed. I put it in a flatter longer dish to put in the oven and it came out PERFECT! It was still bar sized, and tasted delicious! Everybody ate it all. Not a single one was left over. Now I'm expected to make it every year haha!. Thank you! Absolutely going to make it more than just Thanksgiving though.

I love the recipe because the pecan mixture is not cooked before it goes in the oven. This makes the filling lighter and less toffee-like.  For my pecan pies, I always replace about 1/3 of the corn syrup with Lyle's Golden Syrup and a little molasses. This worked wonderfully here. The only thing I would do differently is to have a little thinner crust. Not too much, though - it still has to hold up the luscious pie filling!i will definitely be making these for the Holidays!

Like another reviewer I used real butter and brown sugar instead of corn syrup. I spread the crust a bit thinner too, using a bigger pan. They were incredible.

I made it in a 24x8 at 24 servings. I didn't have parchment so I just greased the pan good. I needed a metal spatula to get the first part out then the whole thing lifted. Very chewy with a dry crumbly crust. I was looking for more gooey like the picture. I might make it again with a few modifications.

I used butter instead of margarine and my pan was a tad smaller than suggested but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and I loved it! I got a little concerned that I had so much crust mixture but it pressed down just fine and left plenty of room for my filling. I lined my pan with aluminum foil and sprayed it lightly with oil. I had no sticking problems on the bottom, just on the edges where the gooey filling touched the foil but it wasn't bad. Next time I am going to work the crust up the sides just a bit to prevent that issue. The crust was great, kind of like a shortbread cookie and the filling just like pecan pie. I sent this to my husbands work along with Iced Pumpkin Cookies, Best Brownies, and Peanut Butter Bars I and these Pecan Pie Bars were the first to go! A couple of people even said it was the best pecan dessert they had ever had!

Fantastic.  I live at high altitude (5000 ft) and upped the temp to 375F.  Used butter for margarine, did 1/2 c dark corn syrup and 1 c light corn syrup, baked in aluminum trays lined in parchment paper.  Crust baked for 25 mins, filling for about 40 minutes.  Took out when center wasn't jiggly anymore but still soft and edges were caramelized.  AMAZING!  I'm a Southern girl and a pecan pie freak and these are the best thing ever.  The crust is ridiculously good.  I made a double batch for a Southern BBQ we are hosting.  Serving with maple bacon ice cream.  Mmmm.  I cut them with a big knife and a pizza cutter. The large knife was less destructive/more accurate and made for prettier squares.

I did not care for this recipe. The creamy part did not set after 25 mins nor an additional 25 mins and by then it looked burned. So i baked it for nearly an hour and even the crust seemed doughy. After the additional cook time I let it cool for 2 hours and when i cut into it, the top part seemed partially set but the bottom just above the crust was all liquid! :(

These were ok.  Not as tasty as actual pecan pie, though I can't place my finger on what is "missing."

I made these for a potluck, and they were very yummy. I baked for 25 minutes and that was perfect. I made them in my pampered chef stoneware bar pan. I did not line with foil, and next time I will definitely do that. The edges really stuck to the pan!  Also, I didn't have enough light corn syrup, so I substituted some with honey.

I made these for the first time last week, and boy what a treat. I swapped out the margarine with unsalted butter because I don't like margarine. I didn't have any problems with the crust or the baking time. I followed the recipe and they turned out perfectly. After it was completely cooled, I cut into bars, and got 36. These are so rich and luxurious that I will cut them smaller next time. Soo good!!!

Awesome!  Only change I made was instead of using 1  1/2 cups of white sugar for the filling, I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of dark brown sugar. This is a really good recipe!

Mine leaked under the crust and made for a kind of hard stickiness around the edges.  I'll use parchment paper next time.  Tasted great.

I made these this morning and will serve them to guests tomorrow.Of course I had to taste them to make sure they were ok to serve. They are great! I made  exactly as the recipe stated except I baked the crust 25 minutes before adding the filling and 30 minutes with the filling. I lined my jellyroll pan with foil, leaving it long enough to hang over the edges. That made getting the bars out of the pan easy. I definitely  will make these again .

We loved this recipe. I made it with rice flour to be gluten free the first time and I brought it over to my daughters the day before Thanksgiving for out Thanksgiving meal and everyone loved it so much they ate all of it the night before. Now my husband keeps asking me when I am going to make more of the pecan bars.

I made the recipe as directed using pecan halves vs. pieces; I do think smaller pieces would have been better. These bars taste exactly like pecan pie, and they are rich. I only have a 9x13 pan, so that's what I used; I just didn't use all the crust or filling.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Used the Pampered Chef large bar baking stoneware pan and had zero spill-over. Clean-up was a breeze and the bars were delicious! (Did add five minutes cooking time, but probably won't next time since the edges were a little over-done)  Great recipe!

I love this recipe I followed it exactly but instead of using spray I used parchment paper to line the pan before I cooked the base mixture.  I did have to cook the mixture another 5 min .  I let them cool 10 min on a wire rack in the pan and then I grabbed the parchment paper and pulled them out of the pan to cool the additional time .....they are rich and good .....thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Fantastic.  The only issue was the somewhat dry 'crust'.  I'm not sure how best to remedy this...perhaps adding an egg or some milk? It was crumbly and very hard to cut.  But even as messy as they were, they tasted great!

One problem...I will NOT stop eating these if they are in my house! Great recipe, Marieta. Oh, I remember what I did...I found out too late that I had only half the light corn syrup I needed, so I subbed maple syrup for the rest. Turned out delicious.

These bars have a much better texture than Pecan Pie.  I will not make Pecan Pie again!  I was asked for this recipe mutliple times after just making these one time.  Great recipe that I will make year after year.

Loved by all!!  Not one negative comment.  Only change was to use butter instead of margarine.

These were awesome.  My family likes pecan pie, but a slice of pie was just to rich.  I made them for a Christmas party and they were a huge hit.  The parchment paper is a must.

I really enjoyed thisbut I have to say I wasn't impressed with the crust.  I found it way too crumbly and it fell apart when i took the pieces out of the pan.  I tried it again but with adding and extra 1/2 cup of butter and it was much better that time.  I works great with raisans instead of pecans which is what I did when I made it the second time

These were great, I've made them twice.  What I did differently that worked better?  The 1st time I made them the filling ran under the crust and made about 1/4 of the bars inedible.  So the 2nd time I made them I made a 1 and 1/2 recipe of the crust and made sure it went up the sides of the jelly roll pan to keep the filling on top.  I do like crust so a little extra wasn't a problem for me.  (I used parchment paper underneath both times).  I also used walnuts instead of pecans (it's what I had on hand), and called them walnut tart bars, or something like that.  Everyone at Christmas parties and at work loved them!!!

Delicious!  Took other users suggestion and did 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and cooked for about 35 min..  I preferred the juicier middle pieces so next time will probably only cook for 30 min.  Many rave reviews!  Thank you.

This is absolutely to DIE for!  There are not words to describe how delicious these are.  Sweetness is exactly perfect.  I used a little bit of Splenda 1/2 cup in place of 1/2 cup sugar and for half of the flour I used white whole wheat flour.  I don't think this changes the flavor at all, but makes me feel a little better about how many of them I eat!!!

Just tried today-they turned out great! I did have to bake slightly longer than recommended(40 minutes instead of 25)   Can't wait to have family try them this Christmas! Thanks for a keeper!

These were excellent! I had so many compliments and people asking for the recipe. I followed directions exactly. I did roast my pecans first and I put parchment paper on the shelf below to catch any overflow. Worked perfect! Making more today. Ü

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers. I used butter instead of margarine, used 3/4c. brown sugar and 3/4c. white sugar in the filling, and I decreased the pecans by 1/2c. and added 1/2 semi sweet chocolate chips. I brought this to girls night out.  I have already recieved 2 requests for the recipe. Very easy and will make again.

These were a huge hit! I had to tweak the recipe a little because I ran out of white suger. For the crust I used brown sugar, and for the filling I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I also recommend adding chocolate chips. I used 2 cups chopped pecans and 1/2 cup choc. chips.

These are awesome!  They are by far the most requested dessert that I make.  Lining your pan with parchment paper saves a lot of time and messiness when it comes time to slice them.

These are awesome!  I had no trouble with the bake time, although I baked them in a Pampered Chef stoneware pan.  They came out perfect.  I added a little more nuts.  A friend of mine who supposedly doesn't like pecan pie said, "I think you just turned me into a pecan pie lover!"  And others thought they were better than pecan pie!  This one's a keeper!

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving! I had an 11" x 16" jellyroll, so I made 1 1/2 times the recipe - followed it to the letter except for substituting crisco butter flavor stix in the crust. It only needs the 25 minutes to cook if you use a jellyroll pan, more if use a cake pan as it thicker. Awesome recipe - I usually buy a boxed mix to make pecan bars but never again. These were easy to make and tasted way better. Thanks for sharing!

I think these turned out great...only thing was I did have to bake them considerably longer then the recipe stated, and my oven is usually really hot, I almost always take things out a couple minutes early.

Pretty good.....I halved the recipe and made it in a 9" pan for a thicker bar. Was tasty, just wish it was more of a richer deeper pecan pie taste....maybe use brown sugar next time. Will try these again.

These bars are fantastic! I followed the recipe exact, with one change. Cut the recipe in 1/2 into two 8x8 pans. They taste just like pecan pie - and maybe even a little better. Did need to cook the bars about 20 minutes longer than what the recipe called for.

I adjusted the recipe for 24 servings so I could use my 13x9 pan as others suggested.  Used parchmant paper which made taking the bars out and cutting them a breeze.  I had made extra pie crust for Thanksgiving so I used my husband's grandmother's pie crust but followed the recipe otherwise. Cooking time required additional 15 minutes.  Very good and got rave reviews and a few requests for the recipe!

This is my first review & I've been on this site for 4 years.  I just finished making these.  They are not even cool yet.  They are awesome, I can't wait until they cool off.  I did have to turn down the oven for the last 5 minutes, but that's because of my oven.  I will make these again really soon.  This is the best.

I served these at a dinner party last night and everybody complemented me. We really like these and to me they're better than pecan pie itself.

This recipe was great I baked the bars in a 9x13 pan In the filling I added 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar instead of all white sugar.  Next time I will probably add 1/4 cup bourbon to make it more like a real bourbon pecan pie!  Otherwise they taste just like pecan pie. Even my fiance loved them!

Delicious! Made these for my boyfriend's birthday today and my family almost ate all of them before he could get one! Pretty simple.  Followed suggestions to cut down to 24 bar serving size.  Added some chopped chocolate to some and very rich.  Definitely a keeper!!!! My dad's new favorite dessert!!!

Loved these bars, I increased the recipe to 48 servings and made it in 2 9 by 13 aluminum pans.  They were perfect didn't change anything.

I made this without any substitutions.  They were very good but for some reason the filling didn't set up.  I've never tried pecan pie before so I'm not sure why.  I wanted something you can hold in your had but we had to eat it with a fork. I will probably make this again, hopefully next time it will be firmer.

Nice texture, fairly easy.  Make sure to line or grease your pan very, very well!

These tasted fantastic (sweet and gooey - just how we like it!) but they REALLY stuck to the baking tray, even though I greased it well! I will definitely make again but will line the tray with foil or baking parchment. Thanks for the recipe, Marietta!

Amazing!!  I made these for thanksgiving this year and they were a huge hit.  Everyone asked to take some home.  By the end of the day there was not one single bar left.  I did manage to get one bite of one bar and I have to admit they are really really good.  Will make again and again.

My teenage daughter prepared this recipe on Thanksgiving morning.  We didn't have the 10 x 15 jelly roll pan so she used a regular 9 x 13 cake pan and a round, 1 layer cake pan, which worked fine.

She assembled the bars easily, and didn't make any substitutions with the recipe.  We waited a few hours to cut them so they would set properly.  They were a little goo-ier than your average bar, but they tasted so wonderful no one complained.  We'll definitely keep this recipe.

These bars are SOOOO very good!!!  I tried another recipe and it did not taste like pecan pie.  These, however, do.  These would be a great give-away Christmas cookie.  Very easy to make also.  I used Splenda for the sugar and would not know the difference.  Yum!

All the taste of pecan pie in the convenient form of a bar. Not much mess nor dishwashing, and all ingredients are either in your kitchen or in the nearest store (except in Belgium, where I live, where corn syrup is only avalaible in import!!!)
