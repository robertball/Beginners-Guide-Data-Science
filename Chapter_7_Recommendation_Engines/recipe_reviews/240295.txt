I make this several times a year.  I use cranberry jello for thanksgiving, and just about any other kind I have on hand in the summer.  There are never leftovers when I take it to potlucks.  Sometimes I add miniature marshmallows to it too.  The kids and adults love it.

Such a delicious salad, and it comes together so quickly. I prefer it after it has had time to sit awhile, so I usually make it quite a few hours before I plan to serve it, even the day before. I prefer the small curd cottage cheese, but the large would work just as well. And, of course, any flavor of gelatin will work.

Simple. Quick. Tasty. Was looking for a salad with no nuts or coconut and here it was. I added some mini marshmallows.  I will be making it again and I can tell you before hand that my guys will love it.

Extremely simple to make and I had a fan club after the salad was tasted!  What is particularly nice is the ability to alter the color and taste easily by simply substituting any flavor of jello as you like.  This is a nice blend between desert and salad since the cheese makes it less sweet and amazingly delicious.  I made it ahead by 2 days and it was perfect when it hit the table.  For those who enjoy these types of salads, this is a can't miss dish.

This was a summer staple at our house growing up.  We used whatever flavor of Jell-o we had on hand.  A super easy side dish that goes great with hot dogs on the grill.

I love this dish with any kind of Jello. Either lime, like this recipe says or something red, as the photo indicates. ;-)
