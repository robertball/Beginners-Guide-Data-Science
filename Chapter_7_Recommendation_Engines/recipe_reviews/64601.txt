I made this vegan with vegetable bouillon and omited the cheese for my vegan sister and added a minced shallot to the onion mixture, but it was a hit with the carnivorous memebers of my family.  I served it with a few other bruschetta recipes and they agreed it formed a nice companion in contrast to the other tomato and olive-based tapanades.  Will definitely make again (but with the REAL stuff in it next time)

I thought this was wonderful: tasty, out-of-the ordinary, and relatively simple. Did not have fresh sage so used dried. Not too popular with my kids, but who cares! The adults enjoyed it very much.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this was just so-so.  I found it to be dry, and ended up putting some tomato on top for some flavor and color.  Not a hit with my guests, would maybe try a variation next time--maybe adding some tomato or basil, plus I didn't have a food processor, it might have helped.
