This recipe was really good, but I have one suggestion. If you substitute 1 cup of the water with 1 cup of red wine, the soup will turn out all the better. With this substitution, I give this soup a 5 star rating!

A delicious recipe for certainly all occasions, the tomoato gives the soup tangy favour and the ingrediants was so easy to obtain, no mess and no fuss at all. A great treat for everyone in the family and easy to prepare as well. A must try for chowder lovers.

I cut the recipe to 3 servings. I didn't use bacon or salt, too much sodium. I did add a vegetable buillon cube to the water. Used black pepper instead of white. I had to add a lot of water to serve three people. Also added some cornstarch to thicken it up so it would be more of a chowder instead of a soup. Yes, I'd make it again with the necessary changes.

This Clam Chowder is labor intensive. The grated carrot and chopping of the veggies takes me longer than 20 minutes to prep, but maybe I'm just slow.
The end result is heaven. I serve mine with fresh Ciabatta Bread, kiddos are always pleased!
***Most importantly it's dairy free!

This recipe was very easy to make and super tasty.  I did use the substitution of one cup red wine (for one of the cups of water) tip.  I also omitted the bacon, choosing to saut√© onions and celery in a bit of olive oil instead, in an attempted to lower cholesterol. My last adulteration was a healthy squirt from the sriracha bottle, for some "zip." Anyway you make it, this recipe has a very healthy portion of clams to other ingredients and was delicious.
