This is an awesome recipe.  It is served at the Continental restaurant in Saugus, MA.  We've enjoyed it for years....if you let it sit for at least 24 hours, the flavors are enhanced.  It's just great.

A unique and tasty topping for crackers, this recipe is delicious.  I think it is best on a buttery type cracker.  I'm always asked for this recipe.

I grew up eating this dip it is one of my favorite dips. I have always known it as Boston Bean Dip but this is pretty much the same. The recipe I use calls for fresh garlic (2 small cloves) minced, and no horseradish but the next time I make it I will add some horseradish because it sounds good. I love this dip served with triscuits. So easy to make yourself no need to buy it at the deli.

I have lived in New Englad all my life and got tired of spending top dollar at specialty food shops to buy this delicious snack.  I made a few modifications to try to copy the recipe that I am familiar with; I omitted the onion and used red pepper relish instead of pickle relish.  With these two modifications, the dip was exactly what I am used to for New England Bean Dip.  For a while I had been reticent to try a mayonnaise-based recipe because the dip doesn't have a mayo flavor at all, but I am glad I finally gave it a try.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

We're from Ipswich Mass and this is as good as the Hart House Bean Dip  - or Bells Market Bean Dip - which turned into Star Market.    Eat this with Triscuits and it's a meal.

This is a great easy to do recipe. In the midst of my exams and the Canadian winter I did not want to spend a lot of time making food or venturing out for ingredients. Having most of the ingredients on hand (except relish and horshradish, as well as using fresh garlic instead of powdered, and red onion instead of white) and throwing them all in the food processer I had exam food within 5 minutes with little clean up. The recipe was great even missing some ingredients.

I've been searching for this recipe!  It's absolutely delicious...the only thing I would change is a little less on the relish, but over all FABULOUS!

I was really disappointed by this recipe, considering it was so highly rated.  I found the onion was overpowering, even though I used a sweet onion.  I cut the relish in half, and it was still too much, the mayo made it too rich, and it was bland.  I added some sour cream to reduce the richness and also added some chili powder and tabasco sauce to give it some more flavour.  Also, the recipe did not say to make in the processor, so initially the beans were whole, but obviously that doesn't make much of a dip.  After all my changes, it is edible, but I still wouldn't make it again.  Sorry!

This is an ACE dip recipe.  Easy to make with ingredients usually in the pantry/fridge and delish with crackers of any sort.   A dip that seems to be surprisingly unknown.  I've introduced it at many a potluck, evening get-together.  Gotta try it....

Excellent!  I have been looking for this recipe and was very excited to have found it.  And what's better is that this is more yummy than the one I remembered.  The only change was to sub garlic salt for the garlic powder and salt.  Perfect blend of flavors.  We served this with the new Town House Bistro (Multigrain) crackers and it was a definite hit!

I grew up in New England and although I never ate this New England Bean Dip myself my Dad used to make it all the time. We just gathered in the Berkshires for my Mom's Birthday and since she had fond memories of this dip I decided to make it. All the comments about this being a New England favorite at restaurants around the Boston area sparked my interest. This was served at the Continental restaurant and my parents knew the owner who shared the recipe with my Dad. It was a big hit and brought back lot's of nostalgia. Very easy to pull together! Serve on a nice platter with a large variety of crackers.

Hooray! We lost our copy of this DELICIOUS cracker and bean appetizer. This is especially good during the many fall and winter holidays.  Strong wheat crackers can handle this hearty "sweet and tart" dip, and most who try it request the recipe. Everyone sends thanks for submitting this recipe, so, again, we can enjoy it  here in our part of New England!

Absolutely Delicious! My family just couldn't get enough of it! I think next I might substitute the mayo with a low-curd cottage cheese and yogurt combo to take away a lot of the fat and calories. You probably won't even be able to tell the difference with all of the spices. Great recipe!

This is a very good dip, bean salad, sandwich.  Too much dressing though.  I usually half the dressing ingredients, only 1 Tbsp of relish, and add extra beans.  This is tasty in a pita, or sandwich roll.  I will make this again and again.

Thank you for the recipe! Its delicious and easy to make. I did not grow up eating this dish so I found it easy to modify because I didn't have any particular taste expectation. I like to chill the recipe but usually end up eating half of it before it gets in the fridge! Thanks again for this delicious recipe!

Excellent recipe!!  I did add more horseradish, only because I love the taste, approx. 1 good heaping teaspoon full.  I did taste the dip approx. 4 hours after chilling and  thought it was a little bland.  I let it chill overnight as other reviewers suggested and the flavors were more pronounced and it was nearly perfect.  The only thing that I think I will do differently next time is not to add the full amount of sweet relish, it was a little too pronounced for my taste (just a personal preference).  Thanks for the recipe.

We have never eaten this as a dip.  My dad learned to make this from his dad who learned to make in WW2.  We have always eaten it as a bean salad side dish.  To make it more filling, diced boiled egg has been added at times.  We have also done this with canned pinto beans for a slightly different color and flavor.  And we have doubled the recipe with  half kidney and half pinto beans.  You may have to experiment with relish.  The wrong kind can make this too salty or too sweet.  I usually leave it out of mine.

Great, Great, Great.  Everyone loved this dip.  I added about a 1/2 cup of cottage cheese to it, as that's how I've had it in our local restaurant.  Thanks so much for this easy, delicious recipe.

I would almost give it 5, the appearance intially was a bit strange to me...but I ended up mixing it in a blender and it looked much better.  I also like the taste better letting it sit overnight in the fridge.  Also I thought there was a little too much mayo I ended up adding more beans to the mix to make it thicker.  Some of that might be personal preference.  More horseradish too! I am from New England and had not had this in years so thanks for the recipe!

I love this bean dip that was always a popular appetizer served with crackers here on the North Shore of Massachusetts. Beans are good for you too, right? I am going to make some right now! Thanks JOJO!

I guess I have to be the lone dissenter here. :( (Sorry!) I didn't care for this. I kept thinking as I ate it, that it tasted like I meant to make tuna salad and just substitued beans in place of the tuna! Not the taste I was expecting. I am a HUGE bean lover, so I still ate some. I guess it's a different way to get beans in your diet, but I wouldn't serve it at an event.

I really liked this recipe. It was easy and fast and tasted good on Triscut and Ritz crackers. It reminds me of tuna salad without the tuna because I use sweet pickle relish in my tuna salad. This dip wasn't the first thing to disappear at our football get-together (infact was still have about half of it) but everyone said they liked it.

This "New England Bean Dip" was good; however, it had a lot of mayonnaise. I guess I was expecting something like a regular bean dip to use as a sandwich spread or with pita bread (which I did). Next time I make it I will "eye ball" the mayo to suit my own tastes, and I may even try a vegan mayo. Thank you JOJO121864 for sharing your recipe.

I wasn't sure my family would be into this, but surprisingly, even my 17-year-old brother asked to try some and gave it a positive review! They enjoyed it with Triscuits and as a sandwich spread.

We did not like this one! I don't think I have ever given a recipe one star! I was looking forward to this because I love everything in this....but together, no good! Sorry!
