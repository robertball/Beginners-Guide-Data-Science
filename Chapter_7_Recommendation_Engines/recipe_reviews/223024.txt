The sauce was just wonderful. First time out I didn't have any wine on hand, but it was very good. Made it again with wine and it just blew me away. The only changes we made were to substitute Splenda for sugar and for the meatballs we sliced string cheese into small rounds and hid them inside the meatballs. The recipe says it serves 6 but we served 8 good eaters, with a small salad on the side. Simply a great meal.

The sauce part of this recipe was really good although I had to use a large 28oz can of crushed tomatoes. The meat balls made 12 balls, about golf ball size - I had to add a splash of milk to get the meat and cheese mixture to hang together.  The meatballs might have had a better texture if I had added to milk to the bread crumbs and egg rather than at the end.  Thanks for a good recipe.

Absolutely amamzing meatballs.  Very easy to make.  I use it with a jar of prego and a jar of alfredo sauce mixed together.  I just cook the meatballs in this as called for.  They are out of this world.  Also great heated up the next day.

I always buy a large pkg of pork neck bones. I roast them at 350 degrees for 1 hour & freeze them.  When I'm making sauce I wrap a few in cheesecloth & add to the sauce.  This makes the sauce even better.

Great recipe, although I didn't have wine on hand, just added water and tasted great. I'm anxious to make it with the red wine. Looking forward to making it again soon!

This was the most AMAZING sauce and I make a pretty darn good sauce myself! The wine was the PERFECT complement to the sauce.  It made the taste very authentic to Italian.  Meatballs were a huge hit too.  Guess I will be making this sauce from now on and not mine - :)  Thanks for sharing!

I think there is an error in the seasoning and wine amounts.  Sauce was Very strong.  Meatballs saved this recipe.

There must be something missing or something wrong with the proportions. I had to add water to thin down the sauce and the spices were overwhelming.

I tried it, I love it. However, I replaced the mozzarella in the meatballs with Parmesan, the parsley with basil. Meatballs should be pan-seared until golden brown before being put in the sauce, so that's what I did. I finished them in the sauce which was simmering on low heat.

I did not have mozzarella cheese so I used mexican cheese mixture and some Monterey  Jack.  I also added about a tsp of Basil in the meatball mixture.
Cook meatballs in oven at 400 degrees for 10 min. Turn once after 5 min. Then add to the sauce.

This is a very good meatball recipe I've made, this recipe has become my signature dish and I don't know how many times I have made this. I would like to recommend! My husband loves it too.

I don't know if using my "old fresh" tomatoes in place of the canned crushed  ones had much to do with the flavor, but the red wine really adds to the sauce. (I used a Red German Dornfelder wine & cut back on the sugar.)  I didn't follow the recipe exactly in "measurements", but used the listed ingredients to season the sauce & meatballs.  I like the mozzarella cheese in the meatballs & did brown them in the oven before adding to the sauce.  (I used a fine shredded mozz.)  Next time, I want to try adding the raw meatballs to the sauce but will need a lower fat ground beef to be comfortable with that idea.  Good recipe to adjust seasonings to your liking.

I was hoping to enjoy this but it was way too sweet. Tasted like bottled tomato sauce. I like my tomato sauce on the smoother side and actually tasting like tomatoes! Family wasnâ€™t impressed.

I didn't use any wine, and used sauce, but overall, the dish was delicious! The meatballs were the best I've ever had!

The sauce was good but the meatballs were bland. Next time I'll season the meat mixture.

This recipe is fantastic!! I loved the flavor. I skipped the salt since the garlic salt and the tomatoes added enough flavor for me. My son loved it. This will be my go to recipe!

I agree with the title.  It's amazing!  I was a little leery of not cooking the meatballs before putting them in the sauce, but I simmered them in the sauce with the lid on, kept flipping them, and they were actually done in 30 minutes.  This goes under my favorites!

We added red pepper flakes a few more herbs and garlic. Very good. We cooked it a little longer (bc we were waiting on the garlic bread) and had to add a little broth to thin it out a bit. Great base and the meat balls were amaze-balls.

I hate to be Debbie Downer, but neither my hubs or I liked this at all (sorry!). For one, this sauce is WAAAAY too thick! My grocer doesn't sell 16 oz. cans of crushed tomatoes but it's a good thing they don't. Even after adding an entire 28 oz. can of tomatoes, my sauce was super thick, almost a tomato paste consistency. Another problem I had with this recipe was partly my fault. Setting my burner to medium burned my meatballs! Admittedly, I should have stirred every now and then, especially since I simmered everything in my Dutch oven (which isn't non-stick). Everyone's stovetop is different and apparently mine runs hot. I never thought I'd say this, but Jeremy's Italian Spaghetti Sauce & Meatballs blows this out of the water. Maybe this will float your boat, but it didn't do anything for us. Thanks anyways, Megan.

This sauce has a lot to be desired. Too much spices, and it was very acidy. I added some hot pepper flakes and more sugar then it tasted better. The meatballs were O.K. I would not make this again.

I really liked this recipe (I'm a Megan too!). I made both the meatballs and tomato sauce and stuck to the recipe pretty dead-on. BUT I struggled with the ingredient portions. My grocery store sells ground beef in 1lb portions, so I went ahead and doubled the meatballs (froze half for later). Also, I could only find crushed tomatoes in 28oz cans - but that ended up being a blessing because if you like plenty of sauce on your pasta, this recipe does not serve anywhere near 6. Next time I'll use the full 28oz and adjust the seasonings/wine accordingly to get more sauce. The meatballs portion of the recipe worked perfectly though - I was able to follow it to a T and had perfect meatballs!

Megan is right! It is amazing! I put about a 1/4c of shredded parm in the meat balls... oh and they were made with gr beef, gr italian sausage and gr lamb, as well. This made them tender and so yummy! Had enough leftover to keep it for the weekend and something to munch on! Way to go Megan!
