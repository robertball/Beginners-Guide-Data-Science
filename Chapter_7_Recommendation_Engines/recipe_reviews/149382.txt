I made this over a fire while I was camping with a few friends and it turned out surprisingly well. I used Tilapia since my grocery store didn't have Halibut. I cooked the foil packs on a tripod grill over the fire for about 25 minutes rotating the grill occasionally to make sure the warmest part of the fire hit all 4 packs. The only thing I will do differently next time is season the fish prior to cooking, it was a bit on the bland side even with the dressing. Also, don't be afraid to add in extra spinach. I t looks like a lot when you put it in the pack but after it cooks down it turns out to be less than you'd expect. Definitely an easy camping meal that's a nice change from burgers and dogs.
