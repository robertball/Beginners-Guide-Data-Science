This got great reviews from everyone that tried it. I substituted an old beef roast for the brisket and also whisked the cornstarch right into the crockpot at the end (not sure how much I used -- I just kept dumping in a little at a time 'til I had a nice thick consistency). This made a lot that way and was quite tasty.

Excellent choice. I modified this recipe in the following manner.  I marinated the meet for 3 days, then smoked it for 12 hours between 200-220. I wrapped meet in tinfoil for an hour and kept it in warming oven while I made the sauce.  From the fat drippings I caramelized one large onion, then added chicken broth, and the remaining marinade and boiled that down to a gravy. Note, I didn't use corn starch because it would have reduced the flavor of the marinade.

This made some really great barbecue. Great tangy smokey flavor. Nice blend of flavors and it was a hit with my family. Both my husband and son ate seconds. I used a chuck roast, hickory liquid smoke and substituted dried minced onion and some onion powder for the real stuff. The only change I would make is to thicken the sauce more as it needed more body, maybe more cornstarch? I loved that this used a homemade sauce and not some bottled stuff, thanks Adrienne, we really liked this barbecue! This is a keeper.

I loved this recipe.  The only changes I made were to saute the onions and garlic before adding to the pot, and to omit the liquid smoke because we didn't have any.  I cooled it, skimmed off the fat from the broth, and let the brisket rest in the broth overnight.  The next day it was just delicious.  The large amount of vinegar gives it a lot of tang, so you could adjust it there if desired.  My girls are native Texan BBQ fiends and they loved it.

Leanest, most delicious BBQ meat I've ever tasted!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, using the leanest brisket I could find.  Trimmed whatever fat I could see before putting the meat in slow cooker.  I was a bit weary about the liquid smoke flavor, but am happy to report it wasn't overwhelming at all.  This is the most delicious BBQ meat I've ever tasted - definitely a keeper!!  It should be noted that despite adding corn starch at the end as directed in the recipe, the liquid sauce is still very then - like broth.  Next time I'm going to shred the beef, add it back to the corn-starch-thickened sauce, mix well, drain in a strainer, and then serve.

Adrienne, this is awesome!!!!  I tried exactly as written (always do this first time before making changes) and found it to be incredible.  It was even better the next day after the meat soaked in the wonderful sauce all night.  I plan to do this again and again.  Next time I might caramelize the onions first if I have time.  Also, I did not have the 10 hours needed so I cooked it on high for 4 hours and then low for 2.  The meat wasn't as tender as it probably would have been had I had the whole 10 hours to just cook it on low.  Next time, I'll plan ahead.  One great thing about your recipe is I had all the ingredients on hand - no special trip to the store needed.  Even my picky husband who isn't a huge brisket fan went back for seconds!  My mom wanted me to tell you that she loved it too :).  Kudos!!!!

The meat got really tender and juicy, but the flavor was terrible.  Way too sweet for a beef dish.  Had to rinse the meat off and add some bbbq sauce to the rest of it.

Born and raised Southerner so you know I'm big on barbecue, and picking up the cooking hobby but not so skilled yet, and I just wanted to thank you for posting your recipe.  Easy to prepare, easy to shop for, and absolutely amazing. It was the hit of our LSU tailgate this week, and I'm pulling it out for one of the bigger games later this season.  I may have even added a little too much liquid smoke and Worcestershire, and didn't finely-chop the onions enough, but it still came out amazing.  Thanks again!

I have to admit I was sceptical about this recipe, it has a lot of ingredients, then while it was cooking it smelled great, but looked like a chunk of beef in soup: very watery.  But I continued on and followed the directions shredding the beef and thickening the sauce.  It was absolutely delish!  I might add a few more drops of liquid smoke, as we prefer a more mesquite taste, but I wouldn't change anything else.  Got rave review by the family as well, and they were actually looking forward to the leftovers.  Definate keeper - Thank You!!!

Delicious!  Served this for my son's 13th birthday to family & friends.  Grandma & Auntie asked for the recipe :)  We froze some & did add a splash of bbq sauce to liven up the flavor before serving, a few weeks later.  Thanks for a new family favorite!

I wasn't a very big fan of this.  I used more of a pot-roast type cut of meat, because my store didn't have brisket, so to me, it tasted like pot roast with BBQ sauce.  We probably won't make this again.

This was pretty good but as previous reviewer's mentioned: too sweet. We topped ours with BBQ sauce and that evened it out and was delicious but on it's own...way too sweet.

This turned out nice and tasty and good for hot beef sandwiches and toasted tortillas.  Although too much liquid for my slowcooker but not too much of a problem as i always have this problem so ladle most of the gravy out and reduce to a nice thicker versionm.  Definately would make this again.

It was a wonderful recipe. I added some bbq sauce after I put the meat back in because it looked a little runny. Will definitely be making this again.

This was a winner. My husband said he loved it more than pork BBQ in the crock pot with the BBQ sauce added later. So I'm thinking I will use this recipe and add pork instead of beef next time. I think I will omit the 1/2 cup of water since it was not really needed. I did not use the cornstarch but I did drain off 2 cups of the liquid and froze it to use somewhere else in another recipe! So delicious! We don't come across 5 star recipes very often, so I have to thank you for a great recipe!

Used chuck roast, smoked paprika but no liquid smoke.  2 cloves, adjusted salt.  Did not thicken juice but did skim fat.  Beef broth instead of water.  Loved the outcome but think there is a lot of wiggle room to make your own adjustments and still have success.

It turned out just ok for us. The round eye round roast that I got was also tough. The spices weren't to our taste. I won't make it again, but thanks to the chef for sharing the recipe for us to try it.

It was ok.  A little too  much vinegar for my taste so  had to add more brown sugar.  After whisking in the cornstarch the consistency was still too thin for hubby.  He prefers a thicker sweeter sauce.  If you like a tangy more vinegar barbeque sauce then you should like this

Taste was phenomenal, I would have liked the beef to have been a little more sturdy, but I think that's more the fault of the cook than the recipe... Overall, great flavor; my mother is not a fan of brisket and she loved this for the sweetness the brown sugar brings.

My daughter tackled this recipe as she is learning to cook this summer and it was very good. I'm not a brisket fan, but this was moist and tasty and very easy. Might encourage her to add the brown sugar as another reviewer suggested next time.

it was very good, I did have to add a couple of Tsp of extra brown sugar. I would not add any extra oil, the brisket has enough of its own.

Has good flavor but it was too tough for me. I have another slab of meat I am going to try it again and leave it overnight this time. Maybe that was the reason it was tough. My husband thought it was delicious.

This is my "go-to" recipe anytime I want to make BBQ sandwiches. I have made it with chicken, pork, and beef (not all at once) and each time, it all turned out wonderfully.  I have cooked it and frozen the meat for future use.  You can cook it in batches and have enough for a huge group.  This recipe never fails.  Just don't overcook it or it can get that slow-cooker burned flavor.

This was really delicious, though I used a beef roast because brisket is so expensive.  That barbecue sauce is REALLY good.

Was great. Used half the sugar and double the corn starch. Turned out wonderful.
