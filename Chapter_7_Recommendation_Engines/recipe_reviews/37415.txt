I could not find the specific brand of salsa, so used a cheap, generic chunky salsa and it was still excellent.  The only thing was there were no instructions to chop the whole tomatoes beforehand.  Next time I'll stick them in my blender on chop for a few seconds.  I also wouldn't call this chili.  There were nowhere near enough beans for that.  I'd call this a good hearty vegetable soup.  Next time I'll add a can of chili beans or some other type bean to make it more of a chili.  I used medium salsa and it really wasn't very spicy at all.

This wasn't terrible, but it just tasted like salsa with corn and zucchini in it. maybe it would be better if you added another can of beans, because the beans are very sparse, which makes it hard to think of this as chili. It also needed a lot more spice than the recipe calls for.

Not spicy; add more chili powder, green chilis, and possibly jalapenos.  Pretty good for yourself but I wouldn't make if trying to make an impression.

I have been using this recipe a lot, so I thought I should finally give a review.  This is THE BEST chili I have ever had!!!!  So delicious and perfect for vegetarians!!!!  We did a few modifications.  We added a package of morningstar veggie crumbles, an extra can of black beans (as previously suggested), about a cup extra of zuccini, and lots more chili powder mix (just keep adding to taste).  This time we used Newman's Own salsa (we usually use the taco bell salsa as suggested which is really great) which is great also.  Just wanted to say thank you and this is the BEST chili ever!!!!

Always a favorite with my housemates-- and only one of them is a vegetarian! It takes no time to make and tastes great with shredded cheddar on top.

I was skeptical of this recipe since it was so easy and didn't require an onion or garlic!  It was EXCELLENT.  My father-in-law, mother-in-law and hubbie LOVED it.  My husband is so excited that even he could make this chili (he is not gifted in the culinary arts).  Very tastey.  Thank you!

Very easy!  I added more veggies, carrots, yellow squash.  I added a dash of red wine and let it simmer for an hour.  Another good adjustment has been adding crumbled tempeh for a thicker chili.

I used one pound of dried pintos, soaked overnight and then added 6 cups water, beef bouillon, onion and garlic powders and a chopped jalapeno and finished cooking the beans.  Then I added the rest of the ingredients (except the can of black beans) along with some cilantro.  Tastes great! I try to cook meatless once a week so this is something that I will definitely be making again!  Served with cornbread and you have a hearty meal. Yum!

Our son is a vegetarian and I prepared this for him.  We found out that chili does not have to have meat to have a great taste.  He is winning us over little by little to the vegetarian way!!!!

Exceptionally good recipe!!  Makes a very chunky chili --- just the way I like it.  The one thing I'm going to try next time is to follow the advice of another reviewer and use the low sodium versions of certain things because it did taste a bit salty.

My 3 year old even had seconds on this one!  It tastes more like vegetable soup that eats like chili.  It was flavored just right for our tastes and was not spicy at all.  We didn't use any cheese.  Only took a few minutes to make and only 1 pot to clean.  Ideal!

This was the best vegetable chili I have had!  My sister is a vegetarian, so I had meat chili along with this-and I actually liked this one better.  I used the additions suggested by Ashley, along with a jalapeno salsa.  Some people may prefer to add a little "kick" to it-but it is a wonderful, easy meal.

For the ease of preparation this would be a 5 star. It is very good even aside from that but I did make a few changes. I added a can of kidney beans and a can of baked beans in tomato sauce. I also added a small can of crushed pineapple. My crew found it too spicy. Guess I will have to go for mild salsa next time---is there such a thing!! I will make it again sometime when time is short and I don't feel like cooking.

For the amount of time that it took, this was pretty good.  I did add some things ---- it definitely needed more chili powder, some cumin and a dash of cinnamon.  However, I wouldn't make it on a regular basis --- just when I was in a time crunch.

This recipe definitely has five star potential with a few minor modifications. Upon the suggestion of others, I added more chili powder (probably 3-4 teaspoons). I tried it with the one and it didn't taste enough like chili. It was more vegetable/bean flavored. However, after the additional chili pepper and an added can of kidney beans, the chili was really good. Like others have stated, I would highly recommend cutting the zucchini into smaller pieces, so they cook better into the chili. Overall, great recipe. I'm glad we tried it.

We loved this recipe! I took another user's advice and added more chili powder (1 T.) and a can of cannelini beans, cut the zucchini in chunks and simmered about 45 min. to an hour. We ate leftovers tonight over a baked potato with cheese melted on top. Yummy!

I really didn't like this chili. Neither did my family. Maybe it was because I used homemade salsa instead of the Taco Bell brand. I didn't add the zucchini either, but I don't think that was the problem. Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

My husband and I enjoyed this quite well. Very filling. I added an extra tablespoon of chili powder. I chopped up the zucchini rather than just halved slices. I did add an extra can of beans - I asked for Kidney beans, but my husband brought home pinto. It still tasted fine. One thing that I did do, just out of curiousity - another reviewer mentioned adding a dash of cinnamon - that was the only thing about the taste that we didn't like, so we won't be doing that again.
I added a bit of chopped jalapeno for extra kick.
Really good with corn chips or tortilla chips.

This is a great recipe!!  I have to admit though, that I did mess with it a little.  Like others suggested, I doubled up on the beans and the chili powder.  I also added some leftover mushrooms I had and a couple of cloves of garlic, minced.  I also found that it wanted to be simmered longer, and my total simmer-time was an hour.  Next time, I'll bring it to boil on high in the crock-pot, and leave it to simmer on low for a few hours.  Even with my modifications, the original recipe gets 5-stars, because it is so simple and easy to make, and I think it is a winner!  Thanks!

My family really liked this. My husband is definitely a meat eater, but he never said anything about there not being any. I did add an extra can of beans, and a little bit more zucchini. It also needed to be simmered a little bit more. I served this over rice with cornbread and it was a hit.

We all liked this. I served it with Cornbread Muffins II from this site which was good. I used a different brand of thick and chunky salsa (Newman's Own I think), and it was great. The only thing I might change is use crushed or diced canned tomatoes instead of whole because I didn't like the big tomato chunks.

I've made this a couple of times, and its a pretty decent quick and easy meal.  It does taste a lot like salsa though.  After it was finished the first time exactly as written I tasted it, and decided it needed something, so I added more chili powder and worcester sauce.  This helped a little, but still tastes a lot like salsa.

This was so good. I added an extra can of beans and multiplied the rest of the recipe by 1 1/2 because I thought the beans were a little sparse too, and it turned out PERFECT. I also added two small cans of mushrooms. My entire family loved this, including the vegetarian and the very meat-oriented eaters.

This is an excellent base for a great vegetarian chili. I agree it does need more chili powder. I used 1T at least and some chopped cilantro, topped it with 1T low fat sour cream and cheddar cheese. Yum!

Now THAT was easy and tasty, too. Follow the other instructions re: zesty chili spices and extra beans. All in all, a nice addition to the ol menu list.

This was a good chili, but it tasted a lot like salsa, and it needed a good bit of salt.  VERY easy to make, though.

Surprisingly, Very Very Good!! I did make a few changes/additions. I found that the tomatoes (I used diced) made it quite runny, so I added a small tin of  tomato paste. It was fairly bitter/tomato-y so I added a tbs of brown sugar. I also added cumin and much more chili powder. I topped it off with sour cream and parmesan cheese. So simple to make, everything was in the kitchen except for the zucchinis!! Will make again and again!

I needed something quick one evening after work because I needed to go to the store first and then go home to make dinner.  I found this recipe and it is the easiest dinner I've ever made!  Everyone loved it.  I have brought left-overs to work and two co-workers asked me for the recipe.

I used 3 small zucchinis, which was about 5 cups, so I added a couple small cans of tomato sauce. I also increased the chili powder to 1 tablespoon. This is a very delicious, healthy meal. I'm sure I'll make this often.
