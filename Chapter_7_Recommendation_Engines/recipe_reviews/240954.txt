Really good flavor, but I had to add one very important step.


Bake the chicken for about 45 minutes, then remove the chicken and transfer to a roasting pan and return to oven to finish baking. Pour all drippings (butter, seasonings, etc) into a narrow container and set aside while you begin the pasta, let the mixture separate, and pour off the fat before adding to  the pasta.  Otherwise this would end up a greasy fatty mess. Everything else was perfect and the flavor was great. (ps, use fresh spinach)

Since I don't eat pasta I used a zoodle maker and twisted out some Zuchinni instead of Linguini. I also reduced the amount of butter. I baked the chicken as directed but took out at 45 min. I took the chicken out and put the zucchini and sautéed fresh spinach in the remaining sauce and tossed it. Then I added the chicken back in the dish on top of the zucchini and baked the remaining 15 minutes. Just before serving I grated some parmesan on top. Delicious and a bit more healthy.

I first saw this recipe in Sunset Magazine in 1986.  It is FABULOUS.  I have never made it that I was not asked for the recipe.  My grown children ask for this meal first when I go to visit them, their childhood favorite meal memory.
The only thing I do differently is to slice the onion thinly instead of chopping it and I add  2 ladels full of pasta water to the pasta- spinach mixture to make just a little creamier.
Definitely give this recipe a try !  It will be your new favorite go to and likely your children's favorite meal memory as well.

The flavor was great! I will do this again. I did 5 chicken tenderloins, instead of the chicken they called for, in an 8 X 8 dish. I kept everything else the same. Next time I will cut down the red pepper; it was a little too spicy. But, everything else was the perfect amount!

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and covered the dish for half the baking time. Excellent results...moist, flavorful, with just the right amount of spice. Will definitely make this easy dish again.

This was so good. I used chicken brests-browned first in a skillet, then followed the recipe. So delicious.

Really, a hit for the whole family!  I cut out the bones, skin and fat to make it an easier meal. A bit more work upfront and a little less time in the oven but so much easier to eat. Our just-2 y/o girl is a very picky eater and this dish had her full attention : )  Great for left-overs and will definitely make it again.

We really enjoyed this! I used my own home grown basil that I had in the freezer, and fresh spinach. I had a handful of sun dried tomatoes in the frig, so I threw those in as well. This was an easy weeknight dinner. Served it with a tossed salad. Yum!

Oh my goodness, this is heavenly.  I reduce the amount of butter sometimes by as much as half, depending on how healthy I'm feeling :) You can add or subtract just about any of the ingredients and it is still delicious. Thanks for this recipe!

I made this with the same ingredients cooked it differently. I browned the chicken in an oven safe pan, and added the onion and fresh basil, along with a little splash of white wine. Then I put  it  in the oven to finish cooking. Delicious!

It's fine just very mild in flavor other than the spice which is just too much. I cut it in half and can handle "medium spicy" food and this is just too spicy for the lack of flavor in other ways. I don't think this is kid friendly at all as is. I also didn't use all the butter sauce over the noodles since the fat from the chicken thighs just adds to it and makes it too much grease without any added flavor. I probably won't make it again. Good in concept.

I made this with a few modifications.  I cut the butter in half and added olive oil. My husband won't eat spinach, which I love. I added some fresh green beans to the pasta mix, and I pressed some fresh garlic onto the tops of the chicken thighs. My husband liked the recipe, and it is good for his diet.

it's OK.  I ended up adding lots and lots of sun-dried tomatoes and like 2 times as much basil.  if I had not done that it would have been very bland. I also carmalized the onions and browned the chicken to cut the oven time in half.  I used less hot pepper as well as I'm not a huge fan of spicy food. I think next time I will add Italian spice mix

I used boneless skinless thighs, and frozen kale (what I had available) and it was great!  I shortened the cooking time by 15 minutes.  The whole family enjoyed it! :)

We found this a little bland the first time I made it, so the second time I made it I added a whole head of crushed garlic - we love garlic! I also added a few more tablespoons of butter and used fresh spinach. I did not have dried basil on hand but I did have Italian seasoning so I used that. My son declared tonight that “this is my favourite dish that you make mommy!”

This was a hit with my family. The girls had it for dinner and breakfast...lol. It was super easy to prep and make. I added a teaspoon of minced garlic but didnt use spinach. Next time I would use less pepper flakes....a little too spicy.

I used boneless skinless thighs and fresh spinach rather than frozen.  Other than those two minor changes I followed the receipe directly and we all LOVED It!  Even my picky teens thought it was delish.  Thank you for sharing!

This is a great recipe for improvisation. I used boneless, skinless thighs. I sliced and quartered the onion, used a few shakes of crushed red pepper, minced a clove of garlic and sliced about 6 oz. of mushrooms. I used 1/2 the butter and drizzled olive oil over the chicken before baking.  I did not have spinach, but I did have a frozen spinach soufflé that I thawed in the microwave. Once the chicken was done, I removed it from the dish, added the spinach to the sauce and poured the sauce over the cooked pasta. It was very good! I am anxious to make again with frozen or fresh spinach.

This was really good and easy. I didn't have spinach so I used steamed asparagus instead and I added chicken broth to the chicken while it cooked to make more sauce for the pasta and it turned out great! I will cut back on the pepper next time tho, a bit spicy for us.

Delicious.  I made some changes but few.  Instead of bone-in thighs I used boneless and browned the thighs, onions, mushrooms, a few garlic cloves and shallots, which were my additions.  Then I covered the pan and baked it for 30 minutes.  While that baked I made fresh pappardelle pasta which absolutely worked perfectly with the chicken.

Entirely too spicy for us.   I should have known that 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes was too much, but I was hoping some of the heat would cook off.   It's a great recipe otherwise.

Great flavor with just enough kick.  I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs and fresh spinach and there was not a tiny bit left over.  Based on suggestion, I added about a cup of pasta water with a bit of white wine to the spinach/pasta mixture which gave it a bit of a more creamy texture (not overly so).  Will certainly become part of our rotation - DELISH!

It was a hit for my family. It was both delicious and easy to make. The only thing that I would change probably the amount butter. I'm trying to cut back and 1 cup is way too much :)

Second time I have made it. It was good and a little bit too hot. I followed the recipe. Don't use as much red pepper flakes as the recipe is called for. I used boneless chicken thighs. They were really tender. I'll make it again. Easy dish.

I MADE THIS TONIGHT, THE FLAVOR IS GOOD, I CUT THE RED PEPPER FLAKES BY HALF AND IT WAS STILL TOO SPICY FOR ME.  NEXT TIME I MAKE THIS I AM GOING TO CUT THE RED PEPPER FLAKE DOWN TO 1/4 TSP., OR JUST USE FRESH RED PEPPER. MY HUSBAND ALSO LIKED THIS AND HE IS THE ONE THAT GIVES THIS A FOUR.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and I loved it.  The chicken thighs browned beautifully by baking as the recipe instructed.  After 1 hour the chicken was beginning to brown.  I left it another 5 minutes and the color was perfect.

Very flavorful dish! Easy to make. I used fresh baby spinach. The pepper flakes make it spicy, so be mindful if you are sensitive to n
heat. My husband loved the dish. I cannot wait to make it again for my family members who love spicy foods!

This dish is delicious.  I added artichokes, used garlic salt, and fresh spinach.  My family and I really enjoyed it.  I already had boneless/skinless chicken breasts thawing, so I used those instead.  However, I can't wait to try it with the chicken thighs.

Very simple and tasty!  It is spicy though.  I made it for my family with young kids and so only used 1/2 the red pepper flakes and it was still too spicy for them.  (Perfect for me, but I love spicy).

I made this with 4 boneless skinless chicken thighs. I reduced the other ingredients and as I didn't have any basil on hand I used parsley and rosemary and tasted great. I used fresh spinach and added it 5 minutes before I took the chicken out of the oven so it wilted nicely. With only four boneless chicken breasts, the cook time was only 30 minutes.

My hubby loved it!  It was a nice change up to the usual weeknight meals we have. I did only use a couple pinches of pepper flakes instead of the amount recommended, I'm not big on heat but my husband is so I figured he could add more later but he said it was perfect for him. So thumbs up on this one!

Delicious! I cooked for the full hour and had some burned edges (halved the recipe) around the baking pan, so I added a tablespoon of heavy whipping cream and mixed in the linguine.

I halved the recipe, because there were only 3 of us at the table that night.  Four thighs, half of each ingredient except the hot pepper, which was just 2 shakes, since we are not fond of overly spicy food.  I added a small, diced clove of garlic.  Had no spinach, so I steamed some cauliflower and broccoli and used that instead.  This was delish!  As you can see, it is amenable to changes.  Will make again.

Bailed me out on a weeknight! I am normally exhausted & can't even contemplate cooking a dinner after meetings & a long workday. This recipe popped up & I had it in the oven before even changing out of my work clothes. It was a success with the entire family & I will definitely make it again.

Really, really amazing flavor! I cut the butter to 1/4 cup and that was plenty. The red pepper flakes were spicy, too spicy for hubby and daughter, although I liked it. Next time I tried 1 teaspoon instead of 1 tablespoon and it was still too spicy for them. Now using 1/2 teaspoon and just add a little more to my plate.
