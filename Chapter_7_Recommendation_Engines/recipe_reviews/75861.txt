This recipe was fantastic!  Everyone in my family loved it.  I was a bit concerned because this was my very first time using a slow cooker, and the directions say "cook on low for 4 hours", whereas in my crockpot (Rival 6 qt oval time programmable) the 4 hour option is in the "high" temp.  It wasn't a problem at all.  4 hours was the perfect amount of time for my 2.69 lb pork loin.  I followed the instructions to the letter because the ingredients seemed perfect---and they were.  For the wine, I used the wine I was drinking that night---a cabernet sauvignon.  Also, halfway through the cooking time I did stab the pork a couple of times so that the sauce would seep in.  I served this with some mashed potatoes (perfect side dish because there was plenty of sauce left over). I did thicken the sauce a bit after the pork was cooked and had been taken out of the slow cooker.  I used 2 tbsp of cornstarch and enough water to dissolve it and remove any lumps.  I poured this into the crockpot and stirred for a minute and let it sit in a high temp for 10 min.  It was great---a definite keeper!

I wish I could give this 6 stars.  My husband made obscene noises when he tasted it and my daughter who is sick and has no appetite even ate a large helping.  Here is what I did - we are not big garlic people, so I made a dry rub of salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder and rubbed the tenderloin down.  Then I seared it in a pan before putting it in the crockpot.  The rest of the ingredients, I mixed them all in a bowl (used the liquid to deglaze the pan I seared in for the heck of it), and poured that over the pork.  When it was done (cooked it for 6 hours on low), I poured the juices in a saucepan, brought them to a boil, and added flour and water to make gravy.  Amazing is right!

Good, simple recipe which turned out excellent with a few additions.
My only major change was in replacing the dry onion soup with a fresh onion, cut in rings.To the cup of water, I added a tsp. of beef stock. My choice of wine was what I had... a Chianti. Other than that, it came down to adding a bit more flavor. I added rosemary, thyme, celery powder, a splash of worcestershire, granulated garlic and parsley. Cook time was right on, and the Tenderloin was "melt in your mouth." Strained the onion into the au jus to thicken the gravy slightly, (which was delish,) and served with mashed potatoes. Thanks for the post, LLAU.

WOW!  This is the best thing I've ever made in the crock pot!  I almost always make a recipe exactly as it states the first time, and then make my modifications.  After reading a couple of reviews that complained about it being bland, I decided that I was going to put slivers of garlic in the roast before cooking it.  I LOVE garlic, and ended up using half a head (yeah, that's not a typo) throughout the roast.  If you've never done it before, all you do is stab the roast and shove a clove or half a clove in the slit.  This way the flavor permeates the meat.  Anyway, I used LOW SODIUM soy sauce and everything else as stated.  It was done and super tender after the four hours, but I cooked it on low for about another half hour then kept it on warm until my husband came home.  I decided to add a little corn starch to thicken the juices, and man, was this roast incredible!  I could cut the meat with my fork!  Everyone should absolutely try this once!

How foolish of me, an experienced cook, to even contemplate trying this recipe. What a way to ruin a beautiful (and expensive) pork tenderloin. Let's save crock potting for the less tender cuts of meat.  Smelled heavenly but tasted oh so mediocre.  Sorry for the bad review. Different strokes for different folks I guess.

My family loved this dish, even our picky eaters!  The recipe calls for it to be cooked for 4 hours on LOW.  Reviewers have reported out in a variety of ways on the setting issue.  However, I can tell you that it was not done at that setting.  I had to jack up the heat to HIGH and dinner was late.  Next time, I will cook it for 4 hours on HIGH.

Quite a few said that this recipe was too salty.  I make my own dry onion soup mix (equals 1 packet) -- 8 tsp. dried onion flakes, 1 1/2 tsp. dried parsley, 1 tsp. onion powder, 1 tsp. tumeric, 1/2 tsp. celery seed, 1/2 tsp. sugar, and 1/4 tsp. ground pepper.  Hope this helps.

At the risk of sounding like a know it all I should like to pass along a few hints about salt content on this recipe. Dry onion soup is high in salt and also  contains MSG another salt/flavour enhancer. Better to use either a sliced fresh onion  or 1T of dehydrated onions and a cup of low sodium beef broth. Soy sauce is another source of high sodium; the alternative is low salt soy sauce. For a crust, roll the tenderloin in salt free crackers and potato flakes mixed with herbs de provence (basil,parsley,marjoram,chevril and oregano) or herbs of your choice. For those who want that extra kick of salt add it to your own serving at the table.

One of our family faves. So easy to make, and so tasty, and the best part is it's in the slow cooker, so you can get out and enjoy the day!
I see a lot of people are complaining that it is too salty, but I didn't think so, the trick may be to use a good red wine, not a cooking wine, as those are loaded with sodium!

This was so easy and tasted so amazing!  I did not brown the pork before adding it to the slow cooker, and I did stud it with fresh garlic (as recommended by another reviewer).
I served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli, and was a delicious meal.  Will be making this time and time again!

I made this last night and it was truly AMAZING!  Thank you LLAU!  I skipped the soy sauce, as we don't like our food too salty, I used Merlot and it was quite nice, very tender, the pork fell right off our forks!  My hunny loved it too, which is even better!  Thanks again for sharing!  *****

Very good flavor. However, I made a HUGE substitution. I used a PORK LOIN instead of a Tenderloin. Pork tenderloin is tender, succulent & does not EVER belong in the crockpot! That makes about as much sense as boiling a filet mignon! Just do not do it. Plus it's expensive. Oh, & I also added rosemary.

This was just what I was looking for!  So easy and delicious, it also makes your house smell wonderful.  I did add 1 TBSP. Worcheshire sauce, used Shiraz for the wine and it came out delicious!  I will definitely make this again!

Ended up making this with a 5-pound pork butt for a New Year's Eve dinner party.  I'm usually not a red wine drinker but knew that some of my guests were, so I decided to try and find a recipe that I already had all the ingredients on hand for and this one certainly fit the bill.   Oh boy, was this good!!! I followed the directions for the most part, but studded the meat with garlic slivers and used my best Merlot as per other reviews.  Cooked it on low for 7-8 hours, pulled it out, the meat literally fell off the bone, piled the chunks on a pretty platter, covered it loosely with tin foil while I thickened the sauce with cornstarch on high for a few minutes and then poured a little over au jus style, leaving the rest for my guests to use over potatoes.  As a side dish, I sauteed a mixture of sugar snap peas, baby pearl onions and roasted red pepper strips seasoned with garlic salt and a little red pepper.  Added our favorite cheese bread from the deli and ended up with an extremely easy to fix meal that all 10 of our guests raved about.  And me, the white wine drinker, can't wait to dig into the leftovers tonight!

Sure this may have been fav'd by lots of home cooks, but that is more representative of how many people will put the WRONG cut of meat in a slow cooker. The flavor profile looks fine, just DON'T use tenderloin. Instead go choose a cheaper shoulder or leg cut for this and the flavor will be even better. Save tenderloin for grilling or quick roasting where you can even leave it slightly under done, like med-well. It will be very tender, and you get to taste a high quality cut the way it's meant to be served.

Best Recipe Ever!! I found this recipe years ago on this website before i was a member. It was emailed to me today in my daily dish, (now im a member) so I thought that I would come one here and tell everyone how great it is. My husband loves it and requestes it often. It also works with just about any kind of pork, sometimes i just dont have a tenderloin and will use chops.  I make it just as the directions say, and it is perfect everytime. I love this and so does my husband. anyone who has been a guest when i have made this has raved. Im sure i will be making this forever. I recommend this to EVERYONE!! THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE RECIPE!!

Used pork loin roast - much less expensive - wonderfully flavored and tender.  I skip the searing of the roast, simply place all in the crockpot and go to work.  
Superior flavored gravy.  
Also, this freezes well. Great to make, cool and slice, put into containers with gravy for meals for shut-ins or freezer meals elderly parents that refuse Meals-On-Wheels.  Reheats well in microwave after thawing.

This recipe truely deserves it's name.  I don't cook much with wine, but the underlying flavors were to die for!  Today, I did follow some suggetstions of others, opted for fresh onion, and beef flavored granuals, and being a "gravy lover" did thicken the "au jus."  Had mashed spuds and kernal corn along side...  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with us!!

I made this for Sunday dinner for my family and my parents, and it was a hit!!! I did take some of the suggestions from other reviewers, like adding fresh rosemary and thyme plus I substituted chicken stock for the water (which I do in most recipes that call for water). I also put carrots, onion slices, whole green beans, and cut up baby red potatoes in with it as well. Everything was WONDERFUL and the moans from everyone as they ate it was priceless! My husband who doesn't like vegetables ate them all and said they were great, "the best he has ever had". Thanks for the recipe!!

Delicious!  Used low sodium soy sauce and probably extra garlic, merlot for the red wine.  Cooked on high for 4 hours.  Served with brown rice, carrots, and broccoli.  The juice was sooooo tasty!

This recipe was good, though I found the flavor of the red wine to be rather sharp and somewhat overpowering.  A tenderloin was rather an odd choice for this recipe as they are not as flavorful as a shoulder or butt would have been.  I will try this again and tinker with the recipe as it shows great promise.  4 stars for time management, ingredients usually found in any cooks kitchen and ease of preparation. Thank you chowsito for the submission!

I found this recipe really easy to make and tasty, my whole family enjoyed it.  I stuck to the exact recipe and I agree with some of the other reviews that it is salty.  Next time I make it I am going to half the amount of soy sauce and I'm sure the taste will be the same.

This recipe is great! My 7 year old daughter asked if we could have it every night...there weren't any leftovers. I read a couple reviews that mentioned it might be a little salty so I threw in a can of whole berry cranberyy sauce to add some sweetness. It was just the right ingredient and it actually made the presentation a little prettier as well. Definetly the BEST pork tenderloin I ever had.

Ive made this twice, the first time was as directed except with a roast instead of tenderloin and it was a bit salty. SO the secondtime i left out the soy and instead of the onion packet i took some of the onion i have dehydrated and crushed them and used that instead w/ half the garlic and a little basil added to the top of the roast. This time it was mouthwatering and very juicy. FYI since i'm using a bigger roast i cooked it about 6 low for the 4lb i used the first time and 8 for the 5.5 the second time.

The first time I made it, I thought 4 hours was a bit too long of a cooking time.  Made it again tonight and reduced the time to 2 hours on high and it was perfect.  I was able to slice the pork really  thin.  I added sliced mushrooms about 1/2 hr before it was ready and just before serving  mixed in corn starch to make the sauce into a gravy.  Served it over mashed potatoes and it was delicious!

This recipe is delicious! My meat was pork loin roast versus Tenderloin.   I followed the advice of several reviewers to reduce the sodium and step up the healthy eating.  I minced up onions in lieu of the soup packet, and used homemade chicken broth instead of water.  Also, I used 1.5 T of Soy sauce and 1.5 T of Worchestire Sauce. This is an easy delicious meal that goes well with mashed potatoes or baked potatoes.  I also made the drippings into gravy!  Try this for an excellent meal worthy of company!

Of course it tasted fantastic. Just check out the sodium content on the package of onion soup. Somewhere there has to be a recipe to get that same flavor, but without all the salt. Those of us on a salt restricted diet should not eat this. But, it is still fabulous! I only give it 4 stars because of the salt.

Excellent. I used the two pork tenderloins from Costco. I used 1/2 an envelope of the onion soup mix and did not add any other salt. I cooked for one hour on high then 3 on low. Next time I will just cook on low for 4 hours. I served with mashed potatoes and peas. This was really good and will definitely be used often. Thanks.

i give this recipe 5 stars because it is so easy and very tasty for the amount of effort required.  I don't use dry soup mix but substitute chicken bouillion instead.  I think 1-2 tbsp of garlic is all you need.  I sometimes use beer instead of wine and it's delicious.  I've used rose instead of red too, and it worked wonderfully.  I also add about tblsp of cumin, and 1 or 2 tblsps of mustard and a few bay leaves.  I often will throw in some potatoes and carrots too.  I just add a little extra beer to cover the veggies - it always turns out amazing.  Seems like a very flexible, versitile recipe - easy to alter and always tastes rich and delicious - so easy, too!

Made this for dinner yesterday and the result was hardly worth the expense.  I think there may be some confusion -- a pork tenderloin is different than a pork loin roast.  Perhaps it would have been better had I made it with the loin and not the tenderloin that the recipe called for.  Save the tenderloin for oven roasting and use less tender cuts for the slow cooker.

I didnt addthe wine, and used finely-chopped onion and some garlic powder in place of the minced garlic. Turned out great, although I woul have preferred more of a gravy-consistency instead of au jus.

I would also give this a 6*if I could. I usually change recipes just after reading one that suits my cravings. This one has been made exactly as directed, over and over again. Have a lot of coworkers and neighbors making this on a regular basis ....enjoy everyone....

The dish was actually delicious, but the reason my rating is low is that it was terribly salty.  Either use reduced-sodium soy sauce or less soy overall.

Why use a tenderloin when a pork boston butt is available & much cheaper?  This cut of meat takes very well to slow cooking & adding wine plus stock makes it even better.  Serve either w/a good zinfandel or an excellent beer such as Abita from LA or Red Stripe from Jamaica.  Pop in some sweet potatoes while cooking & you really have a meal!

Tasty!  I did use apple juice in place of the wine, and I liked the results.  I used 2 TB of soy sauce instead of 3.  Still plenty salty- went well with mashed potatoes.  My roast was still almost completely frozen when I put it in, so I let it cook a couple extra hours.  I added lots of baby carrots to the crockpot and they were delicious!  I may try fresh onions next time instead of the soup mix.

I'm on a roll with my new crockpot! This was very good, the family loved it. The pork was so tender I could barely get it out of the pot without it falling apart. The only thing I changed was the red wine, used beef broth instead. Will definitely be making again! :-)

Oh my goodness, the meat was soooo tender... Have never tried tenderloin in the slow cooker before, but I will be soon! My husband said I could make this again and again.

My version was 2lbs porkloin, 1 c fresh mushrooms, 1/2 cup frozen pearl onion, 1 pkg dry Lipton soup, 1 can chicken broth (low soduim), and 1 can cream of chicken. + seasoning (garlic, Mrs. Dash, oregano...)

I would suggest to put the mushroons in after a few hours on high. Cooked on high 4 hrs, low for another 1hr. Be sure to use a thermometer to check meat temp 170deg.

Just made this dish tonight... and wow, it was scrumpdillyicious!  Yes, I changed a few things and here they are:  first, I did a dry rub consisting of garlic powder, pepper, paprika, italian seasoning, cayenne and basil.... then seared the meat before putting into the crock pot.... I used chicken broth instead of water; I used 1/2 c. wine instead of 3/4 c.; and I added soy sauce without measuring, in addition to worcestershire sauce.  I tasted NO wine!  I had purchased a pork tenderloin at the store that came with onions, carrots, celery and red potatoes.... all were perfectly done after about an hour on high, and 4 hours on low!  And yes, this tastes like a prime cut of beef!  We will definitely be making this one again!

Wonderful recipe!  I made this exactly as the recipe called for, except I had two tenderloins in the crockpot, so about 4 lbs. total pork.  The meat was very tender and moist and the broth was so flavorful.  I served the broth over jasmine rice and it was delicious.  Leftovers the next day were even better.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I really like this recipe, and I thought the jus was amazing. I added some dried rosemary and thyme. I doubled the recipe and overcooked a little bit as I left the slow cooker on high while I took a nap. Next time I will be a bit more diligent with the timing.

Amazing is right.  So tender, incredible taste, easy to prepare, presentable. All I did to make it my own was to rub the pork with onion and garlic powders, coarse ground black pepper, paprika, italian seasoning and cayenne pepper, then I seared it in olive oil before adding it to the slow cooker. I used Shiraz for the wine. I even had some for breakfast this morning with an egg and toast!

Very salty and the smell of the garlic was absolutely overwhelming that I couldn't eat it. My husband ate it and said it was not something he would ask to have again. The plus to this recipe is that it was easy to assemble and the meat was very tender; just falling apart.

This was GREAT...and super easy! It even reheated later for leftovers & was just as good (gravy, too!)  After I removed the tenderloin to a platter, I ladled out the juice through a strainer so the gravy would be smooth (personal preference).  I also wondered if this would be ok on low for the 9 hours we were out of the house that day - PERFECT! So - for those of you wondering in you'd ruin it during a weekday, you won't!  It's wonderful.

This was a good recipe. I cooked it all day on low and I think that may have been too long. It was so fall apart tender I couldn't even slice it! It did taste good, but it wasn't a favorite.

Amazing doesn't even describe how wonderful this is!!  My whole family absolutely loves this!  I've fixed it several times using thick sliced pork tenderloin or a pork roast and either way it is great!  I use lite soy sauce and red cooking wine.  It is delicious with the Red Garlic Mashed Potatoes recipe from this site!  I did use regular Idaho potatoes instead of red potatoes, but the combination of these 2 recipes is immaculate!  Use the au jus from the meat over the potatoes, and be prepared for a mouth watering experience!

Not until I came home and smelled my kitchen did I remember I tried this recipe once before.  The ingredients are all tastes I like, but the mix of them is not good.  My crock pot was set for 4 hours and my 3 pounds (yes I adjusted amounts) of pork tenderloin was way overcooked and just plain nasty.  Tried to save with shredding and bbq sauce

Really good, took one star off for presentation.  These slow cooker dishes that aren't seared first never look very pretty.  I wouldn't plan to serve this to company unless you sear first.  This was really easy and a great thing to make when you don't have a lot of time but want something a little special.  My tenderloin was one of those grocery store 2-packs, total weight was 1.7 lb.  I didn't adjust the time at all and the only change I made was to use 2 tbsp. of garlic instead of 3 because I was feeding a 2 year old and didn't want too much garlic.  I strained the juice into a saucepan and thickened with a little cornstarch to make a really tasty gravy.  I bet this would work fine with a cheaper cut of meat if you don't want to waste such a tender cut in the slow cooker.

I don't generally like to give bad ratings if I simply don't like the taste of a certain recipe...but this was a real disappointment.  I followed it to a 't'.  Can't figure it out.  The taste of the dry onion soup mix overpowered my finished product.

I simply added the onion mix and water over the tenderloin, nothing else.  I wasn't hungry for dinner because I couldn't stop eating it from the slow cooker.  Delicious!

OMG this was SO delicious & my husband could not stop smacking & licking his lips....
HOWEVER... it was too salty.(i even added 1 chopped peeled raw potato to the pot to try to de-salt it.)
so next time, i'll add a couple of quick splashes of soy sauce (& i used low sodium by the way) rather than the recipe amount AND i will NOT salt the loin prior to cooking (HUGE mistake..) the stock & soysauce & onion soup mix ALL have salt.. so please do NOT salt the meat..
so this is what i did;
i rubbed my 3 lb loin w/ salt , pepper, dried basil, celery seed/seasoning (not celery salt) & dried parsley.
then i seared it quickly on all sides.
then i placed it in the crock pot & added the stock, wine, soy sauce & onion rings on top of the meat & i pocketed raw garlic in slits on top..
high for 4.5 - 5 hrs.
then i strained the liquid & added 2 full tbsp of starch & let that boil on the stove . & that made the MOST DELICIOUS gravy we have both EVER had in our lives.
i served this w/ mashed potatoes (TIP: if you plan on mashed taters, do NOT salt the boiling water or the mashers themselves.. the gravy will be heavenly on a bed of soft plain ((well w/butter of course)) mashers.. i can NOT stress this enough).
this dinner was just jaw dropping.
trust me.
i will forever use this recipe
THANK YOU SO MUCH recipe poster :)

This pork is truly amazing!  I followed the suggestions of several other reviewers and used sliced onion in place of the soup mix and some additional flavors (couple tbsp of worcestershire with the soy sauce and a sprinkle of rosemary and thyme).  If you're making potatoes or noodles with it, the cooking juices make a delicious gravy.  Just bring to a boil and whisk in some gravy.

I did make this recipe with a pork shoulder roast when I didn't have tenderloin handy and it turned out very good.  It was definitely more fatty than the tenderloin, so the au jus made a VERY rich gravy, but it was tasty nonetheless.

Overall, a very easy "company" dinner that tastes like it was a lot of work!

This was great -- it is so easy and tastes delicious. I also sprinkled (heavy handedly) garlic salt on the pork prior to cooking -- the garlic seeps in the pork better.

This recipe was featured as the "Recipe of the Day" around June 12, 2012.  With the thousands of recipes available, why would you showcase this recipe twice in such a short period of time?

It wasn't that great the first time around.  Too salty and no flavor.  A waste of an expensive piece of meat.

Easy and very yummy. Used low sodium chicken broth instead of wine and inserted whole garlic cloves into pork loin. Let it go all day on the cooker on low for a 3.5lb loin and it was perfect.

This was very easy and good.  I had 4lb tenderloin...so I doubled the other ingredients.  You don't need that much liquid for a 4lb loin.  Will make this again.

we did not like this at all. I stuffed the pork with garlic, but it was way to salty! And that says a lot because I LOVE salt, but not when its the only thing you can taste. I won't be making this again. sorry for the bad review

We enoyed this recipe as it was. I took half the sauce from the slow cooker, added a little flour and made gravy. I served Jasmine rice and gravy along with the tenderloin. As a winemaker, I would like to comment that you should never substitute cooking wine for wine. They are very different and cooking wine has a really high percentage of salt (I have no idea why). I never ever use cooking wine. You should cook with the wine you plan to have with your dinner (unless, you're planning a very special wine for dinner). A day or so later, I took the leftovers (about 1/2 lb), cut the slices in half, and stuck them in the skillet with about 8oz sliced mushrooms, the gravy, and the rest of the sauce from the slow cooker. We put this over the leftover rice and, along with a salad, it was a great, fast dinner!

Very good and easy.  I used white table wine instead of red and did use the reduced salt soy sauce.  For the tenderness you must use a pork tenderloin and not a pork loin roast.  I've never had a tough pork tenderloin in any recipe, but I've never successfully had a tender pork loin roast.

This recipe will now be one of my regulars.  My husband, who is a very picky eater, LOVED this pork tenderloin recipe.  
Couple of changes - Instead of cooking it for 4 hours, I put it on low for 8 hours (more convinient for me). Also, I added a few cut and peeled potatoes and also a few carrots.  Because of the extra ingredients, I added more liquid (beef broth).

The pork fell apart (but not too much) and was just melt in your mouth good!

So I made this a couple of months ago and it turned out amazing!! So tender that to be honest I thought at first the pork might have been undercooked. But since then I've tried to replicate my results but with larger roasts and each time I have ended up with a dry roast. Why is that? I have been keeping the liquid to meat ratio the same (so for instance just tonight I tried with a four pound roast so i doubled the liquid), as well as the cook time and settings, but it still turns out dry. Any advice?

This turned out FANTASTIC!! I did a few things different, I used a meat tenderizer on the loins (the one that pokes a bunch of little holes all over the place so the juices can really get in there) and i marinated it for 24 hours covered in the fridge and cooked it on low in the crock pot form 7:30 am to 6:40 pm. adding a cup of water at about 5pm to cover the meat. The meat was so tender and juicy that it fell apart when i picked it up. the only noise at the dinner table were the sounds of chewing and mmmmm. I served it with Baked beans and a bleu cheese salad!! yum yum! it is almost so perfect that i can used the left overs to make bbq pork sandwiches, another fav!!

My husband liked this much more than I did.  The flavor was pretty good, though a bit too "winey".  The meat was very tender and moist but then it's tenderloin and I expected it to be.  On the advice of others, I thickened the liquid to use as sauce/gravy, but it was so salty I just didn't enjoy it and couldn't finish the potato I put it on.  This was very easy to put together but I probably won't make it again without some changes.

Took the suggestion of the Start a Tradition: Slow Cooker Sunday article and made this recipe today for Sunday dinner (lunch according to my oldest daugher).  Okay, so it drives me crazy when someone reviews a recipe and has made so many changes and substitutions to the recipe, that they haven't made anything close to the original recipe - but here's what I did: Fixed a 3.19lb pork loin I had in the freezer. After rinsing the pork loin, I made slits and inserted 1/2 cloves of garlic about every inch or so, as suggested by another reviewer.  I omitted the wine and used beef broth instead.  Also, I wasn't sure about the taste of the soy sauce in this recipe, so I used worcestershire sauce.  The house smelled fabulous when we returned from church!  I did cook it on high for about 4.5 – 5 hours.  The meat was terrifically moist and fell apart as I was cutting it.  Using cornstarch/water, turned the juices into gravy.  It was little on the salty side, but not sure if that was due to the substitutions I made.  Overall, it was a great recipe and I definitely will be coming back to it again!!

I read MOST of the more recent reviews before I made this today but when i put the two 1#  tenderloins in the slow cooker I followed the recipe exactly. I had heard too many people rave about the flavors and the amount of juices for gravy to not give it a try. It is aptly named Amazing and I concur. I will say that i'm aware of the new Dept of Agriculture guidelines for cooking pork to a temp of 145º  so after 2 1/2 hours i used an instant read meat thermometer and my meat was DONE. I turned off the slow cooker and kept all in the juices for another hour, took out the meat and made a little thicker gravy with flour/water added to the juices in a saucepan, returning the meat to the slow cooker to just stay warm. BIG HIT with my family when i served it over rice. I would guess that those who thought it was too dry or not cooked enough have issues with their slow cooker. Best tip I can give you? invest in a meat thermometer and you will not be disappointed with under cooked or over cooked meat. Definitely a keeper!

I never thought I'd make something with onion soup mix, but I used this and enhanced it. Instead of water I used beer, I added thyme, bay leaves, potatoes, and carrots. I too put the garlic into the meat, but I also salt and peppered both sides and seared it prior to putting it into the crock pot. I cooked it all for 4 hours and then let it sit on warm for an additinal hour. I made a lovely sauce by adding corn starch to the juice. Everybody loved it.

This is possibly the best 'pork tenderloin' that I have ever fixed...
I didn't add the red wine (maybe next time) because I fixed it with grandchildren in mind and I wanted it to be more in keeping w/ their tastes.

Fabulous... I've made it numerous times and every time it's awesome.  I do add 1-2 Tbsp of Worcestshire sauce, 1 can sauerkraut and 2 tbsp of brown sugar so it's not too tart.  Served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  Melts in your mouth.  Even my kids love it.

One word - FABULOUS! Reading the reviews on saltiness, I used low sodium soy sauce. Other than that, followed the recipe as written. It is "Amazing" and it should be cooked as written. I used cabernet, and kept the minced garlic 
(mostly) on top of the tenderloin per
recipe instructions. The flavors in the cooking liquid are perfect to serve as au jus. I usually like to thicken the cooking juices to use as a gravy, but not with this dish.  It's worth it to experience this dish as submitted.

Just wonderful!  Will make over and over!

And I would like to add that it isn't the soy salt that makes it so salty.  It is the dry onion soup.  Have you ever read the label?  It is over 900 mgs. of sodium.  So use something else and low sodium soy salt!  Sodium is bad for us!!

I made this recipe according to the directions.   With the onion soup mix and the soy sauce, it was way too salty.  If I make it again, I will definitely cut the soup mix in half.

I love this recipe!  I've used a similar one for years made with a beef sirloin roast, sliced thick for added taste throughout the meat.  I cooked with a pound of fresh mushrooms and served over rice.  Both meats cooked with the dry onion soup mix are so tasty and ones that I save for that special meal.  Don't leave out the wine; it gives it a very special taste.

awesome!!!!! I did not add any dry soup mix or soy sauce.
I replace it with: red prpper,tomatos,2 big tablespoons of dion mustard,fresh mushrooms, cellery,carots, one potato. I salted the meat in the begining when I searded it.Added litlle bit of flour on the end to thicken the sauce. Half of the vegetables I took out and mixed (for fussy kids) so they can't se it and they will eat it.

Excellent recipe, however I modified a few things that really worked well.  Rather than coating the roast in pepper after it's in in the pot, I coated it in fresh ground pepper and sea salt(pressed in the meat) and pan seared it in olive oil.   For the soup mix I specifically used Knorr French Onion, which has the best flavor in my opinion.  I quartered 2 yellow onions and added them to the mix.  With 1.5 hours remaining I added 24oz baby portobello mushrooms.  With 45 minutes remaining I added baby Yukon gold potatoes.

Fantastic! Like other reviewers, I tweaked this just a bit for my own taste. Added a pinch of dried rosemary and thyme, added a package of sliced mushrooms, and cut the garlic in half. WOW! Everyone raved about this and it was SO easy!

Couldn't have been any easier and tasted great! I didn't change anything other than thickening the gravy with corn starch like some of the other reviewers did before serving over mashed potatoes! Awesome recipe for the slow cooker that doesn't call for cream of something soup!!

Absolutely Amazing.  I used a pork loin (abt 4lbs - it filled the slow cooker) and the ingredients as listed with only perhaps about 2tbsp garlic in total, inserting some in slits in the meat.  I cooked it about 7 hours in total as it was still partially frozen. It infused my kitchen with a wonderful aroma while cooking.  The gravy is wonderfully rich and tasty -I thickened it with 2 tbsp cornstarch.  Don't be afraid of the amount of Dry onion soup mix - it works.  The meat was so moist, so tender, and so delicious - I don't think I'll ever cook a pork roast in the oven again.

Great recipe! It came out tender and moist. They best I ever had! I used a 2 pound tenderloin and it was done in 4 hours. I substituted the red wine for one cup of low sodium beef broth and used 3/4 water instead. I used 2tbsp soy sauce and 2tbsp garlic. It came out fantastic, I will be making it again. Thanks!

This recipe was great.  It is so easy and delicious.  I added cornstarch to the juices and boiled it on the stove top and it made a wonderful gravy.  This is now my new recipe for pork tenderloin!  Not too salty at all for us, although we did use low sodium soy sauce.

This was fantastic! My 10 year old said it was the "finest pork" I've ever made (she's super picky). I cooked it on low for 8 hours (my crockpot options are limited) and it was fine.  Will definitely make this again..and again

I have a picky eater (my boyfriend) that loved this recipe as much as I did!  It was perfect!  I used a pork tenderloin (1.92 lb) and a Malbec wine, and it cooked on low in four hours with no problems!  I did make a few adjustments based on some reviews.  I didn't use onion soup mix.  Instead, I used a sliced red onion, fresh thyme, fresh rosemary, and 1/2 tsp of coarse sea salt.  I also substituted the soy sauce with Worcestershire sauce.  I also added a few whole garlic cloves into the meat while it cooked for extra flavor, as well as the minced garlic on top.  This is a recipe we will definitely repeat!

My family loved this. My children will hardly eat anything and they ate it with a smile on their faces. I let it cook for about 6 hours on high and it literally fell apart.  I thickened the juice with corn starch and made gravy out of it. Very tender and wonderful taste. We will be making this again.

I made some additions based on the comments.  I made a rub of minced onion, garlic powder, salt, and pepper and rubbed that on the pork loin before searing it.   After searing, I deglazed the pan with the pinot noir I was using in the rest of the recipe. I put about half of a sliced onion in the bottom of the crock pot and put the roast on top of it.  I then put the rest of the ingredients called for in the crock pot.  About halfway through cooking, I put in a bag of baby carrots.  When it was done, I added some corn starch to the juices and made a DELICIOUS gravy.  Best way I've ever made a pork loin, and I normally hate pork loin.

Agree with other reviewer's comment (which I read too late). This should be made with pork LOIN, NOT TENDERLOIN! While the taste was nice, the tenderloin cut was wasted, and cooked to falling apart, rather than sliceable texture. I think it would be excellent and hold shape far better with a loin. May try again.

Very good.  Followed directions as listed, using a 2# pork loin.  I rubbed it in Goya adobo seasoning and browned it in cast iron skillet.  After 4 1/2 hours, it was very tender.  I poured the drippings into a pan and thickened it w/ cornstarch.

I've made this dish several times and it's a favorite in my house. I follow another reviewer's advice and pierce the meat several times thenn place slivers of garlic in the slits. This also alows the sauce to marinade in the tenderloin. Don't throw out the sauce, serve with mashed potatos! This recipe never has leftovers in my home!

Made this  yesterday using a  3 pound Boston Butt pork roast. Changes I made was using a very good Sherry wine, beef broth in place  of the water, thin strips of a red onion, baby carrots cut in half crosswise &  2/3's of  a bag of Ore/Ida potatoes O'Brian.  Cooked on low in the slow cooker  for 6 hours then raised it to high for 1 hour.  It came out wonderfully moist and tender. Most definitly a keeper. Have added it to my recipe box.

My boss came in yesterday with a pork tenderloin and 2 bell peppers in one arm and a slow cooker in the other.  She said she had an appointment at 5:00, and asked me to cook it so it would be ready for her family by 6:00.  Up to the challenge, I went to allrecipes.com and found this wonderful recipe.  We had all the ingredients in our office kitchen except the onion soup mix.  I had dried boullion, and used that with the sliced peppers.

It was way too salty (even with low sodium soy sauce) and very unappealing visually. The meat was edible but overall a waste of a nice pork loin.  I will not be making this again.

Hubby made this for dinner tonight. He followed the recipe exactly. We all enjoyed the meal. This is a tad bit salty but was expected due to the use of the onion soup mix packet. Will make again. Incidentally, the gravy was delicious and went well with the mashed potatoes we served. Thank you.

The pork was tender, that's for sure. It just wasn't that tasty. I probably would not make this again, but I would add something - perhaps BBQ sauce or cajun spices - to make it less bland.

This tenderloin was exactly like the name says-AMAZING! I followed everything except instead of using wine, i used plain water. Afterwards cooking, I added flour to some of the "Au Jus" and made gravy out of it! SO GOOD!

This past weekend was the second time I made this terrific recipe but there are definitely minor modifications you should make.

The first time I made this, my loin was about 2.5 pounds and I set it on low for four hours.  Pork is cooked at 145 degrees.  After four hours, the thermometer shot up to 175 in about two seconds.  I don’t know what kind of slow cooker the original poster used…maybe it was old or weak.

This time the loin was three pounds.  I set it for THREE hours and at the 3-hour mark the temperature shot up to 150 degrees.  

So do NOT cook this for more than three hours and if you only use a 2-lb loin, I’d go way less than that.

Also, as many have said, this recipe is very salty.  I didn’t change any of the liquid quantities for the 3-lb loin and there was still MORE than enough delicious au jus.  I did use a little less than the whole onion soup packet (to cut the salt) and just added extra onion powder.  With the bigger loin and everything else the same (oh and I only use low-sodium soy sauce), no one complained that it was too salty this time.  It was REALLY delicious.

It goes VERY well with roasted string beans (roasted with a bit of olive oil, a thinly-sliced red bell pepper, crushed red pepper and the kicker, the zest of an orange), and some boxed pine nut couscous.

Definitely a go-to recipe for company because it’s so good and SO easy.

This was amazing.  I made it for a staff lunch and there were 4 plates practically licked clean and people begging me for the recipe.  I think I even got some brownie points with my boss!    Anyway, I did make a few modifications.  I used white wine instead of red.  I had used red another time I made this and the white tastes much better to me in this recipe.  Also, the entire envelope of onion soup mix made the au jus too salty last time so I used only about a TB of it.  Closed the envelope back up and will save the rest for other times I make this again.  I used less garlic as well - probably about 1 TB.  It was plenty.  Used lots of peppercorn.    Otherwise followed the recipe and it was very very good and extremely tender. I served it with mashed potatoes and folks poured the au jus over the potatoes as well.

This was absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe to the letter except that I used low-sodium soy sauce and cooked it for 10 hours on low.  Since I made this on a weekday I prepped it the night before; I trimmed all the fat from the pork loin and let it marinate in the water/wine/soup/soy mixture in the refrigerator overnight.  In the morning all I had to do was pour everything into the crock pot, spread the garlic on top and sprinkle with the pepper.  When I came home the house smelled heavenly.  The pork was fork tender and had tons of flavor.  Even my super-picky two-year-old liked it!  This is definitely going in the recipe rotation at our house!

I eliminated the soy sauce as I'm on a low-sodium diet.  In place of the red wine, which I didn't have, I used 1 cup Blackberry Merlot Wine and cut the water to 3/4 cup.  It was GREAT!!!! My husband even used the juice over his baked potatoes!  I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband and children loved this. Came out very moist. I made it as written. I personally thought all the onion was overpowering. Oh, it makes a nice gravy too. I added a tsp of beef boullion to it.

This was excellent! I made it twice in one week! I used chicken stock instead of water. If you increase the recipe do not add more onion soup mix if you intend to use the au jus to make gravy...it is way too salty! I alternatively made it with all chicken stock and no wine for a friend with allergies and it was just as good. But I do prefer the flavor the wine adds. Also, don't use one of the pre-seasoned tenderloins...this is so good just the way it is!

Made this pork for Christmas and my family talked about it for days. It is so moist and flavorful.  Served the sauce on the side instead of your typical barbecue sauce. Marking it as one of my favorites. Just as yummy the 2nd day.

I tried this recipe exactly the way it is, and it was pretty good but a tiny bit dry (I may have overcooked it that time).  I would give it 4 stars as it is.  The next time I made it I used 1 can of french onion soup instead of the dry soup mix.  It was fantastic!  This is my fav pork recipe.  My husband loved it (Note:  Husband once ate turkey that fell in the river, so he's not exactly a reliable source).

the first time i cooked this, i followed the recipe, and it was very good. the second time i cooked this, i made some changes, and it was unbelievable! used a 4 lb pork loin (not the tenderloin), doubled dry onion mix, water, red wine (i just used a cooking wine), and garlic (but not the soy sauce!). added about 3 tblsp worcestershire sauce and a little more than 1/5 tblsp each rosemary & thyme. cooked on low approx 11 hours. W-O-W!

My husband absolutely loved this. I listened to other reviews and used good wine. Mine cooked for 8 hours on low, and it wasn't dry, it fell apart it was so tender. I sauted 2 cups mushrooms then added the juices, making a gravy, best gravy I've ever made.

I just made this recipe last week; was looking for something to do with a pork tenderloin and came across this recipe.  Very easy and very yummy!  Since there are only two of us, there were leftovers; but not for long!  A repeat for sure!

This is fantastic! I have made it now 4 times and my husband wants it every week! I do cook it longer than it says. I usually cook a 2 lb pork loin for 5 hours on high, and it literally falls apart. The sauce is wonderful! Thank you :)

Just made this for supper and it turned out very well.  Instead of the onion soup mix I used one sliced onion and added a beef boullion cube.  I was disappointed when I went to the cupboard and did not have soy sauce so I had to omit it but added a little Worcestershire sauce.  I cooked it for 4 hours on low in my slow cooker and it was perfect,very tender and saturated with flavor.  Served it with mashed potatoes and thickened the broth a little.  My picky kids loved it and it is not often they compliment me on the meal! I will give my husband the left-overs on a bun with barbecue sauce for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for a recipe I will be making again.

Truly amazing at how yummy this is!  I cooked in the oven in a roaster pan tented with foil 425* for 30-40 min (155-160*).  So simple and flavorful!  Be sure and pair with mashed potatoes to take advantage of the juices leftover!

This was one of the best slow cooker dinners I've ever had! It was  tender juicy and the flavor was out of this world! I had a 3 lb tenderloin and followed the recipe the only difference was I used 1/2 the soy sauce and cooked it on high. I did use 1 tbsp corn starch diluted in water and added it to the juice after I removed the pork loin. I left it on high about 10 minutes and it made the perfect sauce/gravy. I have picky kids and they loved it.My hubby said i need to cook this for is parents...thats a compliment! They are really picky and only eat top notch so to speak. this is a great recipe!

I did 2 pounds (2 tenderloins, 1 lb/each). I doubled the soup mix, water -- and left everything else as is. I think as other reviewers had indicated it came out just a little too salty. Next time I will add less soup mix. I cooked 2 hours on HIGH and the 2 hours on LOW. Came out perfect. Very tender, too tender to cut into medalions. Served with potatoes and veggies. My BF loved it. I will definitely make this one again!

This was a big hit with my mom and my boyfriend!  I'd just bought the slow cooker and wanted something simple.  This was fantastic.  

The next time I think I'll go lighter on the garlic and put in some sliced onions and maybe some peppers.  I LOVE garlic but it was a little overwhelming here.

Yikes!  I used a drinking wine as others suggested, and the meat turned purple!  It tasted okay, but will try a cooking wine the next time.  Used 1/2 the onion soup mix to cut down on the saltiness.

The name really suits this-it is amazing!Amazingly easy and delicious! When I found this recipe, I knew it was a great base to start with...and after reading many reviews I decided to make some additions and substitions. First, I seasoned the loin with pepper, onion powder, garlic powder,bay, rosemary and thyme. Then I seared it on all sides before putting it in the crock pot with 3/4 cup Malbec, 1/2 c. h2o, 1/2 c. reduced sodium chicken stock, 1/2 of a package onion soup mix, 1/2 sliced onion, 2tbls. soy sauce, and more of the herbs that I seasoned the pork with. I cooked it on low for 5 hours...the pork shredded beautifully, and I drained the juices from the crock pot into a sauce pan, brought to a boil and added 1 tbls. cornstarch and made a delicious gravy...served with steamed broccoli and mashed baby red potatoes...this earned raves from my hubby and even my 2 year old (who never eats, I swear she is going to waste away to nothing) ate it up happily!!! Will DEFINATELY make this again!! Thanks llau!!

Just finished dinner and thought I'd get the family's impressions down right away. Over all it's a good recipe. It went together very quickly I have never had a pork tenderloin cook up as tender as this one did. Because so many reviewers warned about it being too salty I cut the soy sauce to 2T, and it was borderline salty. I cooked it for 6 hours on high because my crock pot although it's a fancy digital thing it doesn't have a choice of settings and 6 hours because I wasn't going to be around until then to deal with it. The meat was so tender that it fell apart. So I went ahead and pulled it apart, put the meat into an ovenproof dish, then I thickened the sauce with some cornflour and poured it all over the top of the meat. I had already started to make tiny new potatoes but at this point it looked so much like a "comfort" food, I pulled out the instant mash potatoes (I know, but the kids love them!) and did a big bowl up in the microwave. The kids made swimming pools in the potatoes and filled them up with the meat & gravy mixture and everybody was happy. Next time I might add some carrots and mushrooms. I'll make it again.

NOT amazing.  Came out very dry and not tasty at all.  Was hoping for a hearty home-cooked meal, but instead was very disappointing.

I loved this recipe.  I took others advice and changed the wine to apple juice and only added 2 TBSP of soy sauce and 1 TBSP of Worchestershire Sauce.  I also seared the pork tenderloin first.  I then deglazed the pan with the liquid ingredients. Put it all in the crock and 5 hours later "pigged out"! Yummy!!

OUTSTANDING and EASY!!  I made it for the first time for company and it got RAVE reviews...we all kept "Mmmm"ing through the whole meal.  I used just over 4 lbs. of pork, but only one soup mix.  I doubled the wine, water and soy sauce, but used half worsteshire with the soy sauce. Last, I added 8 oz. fresh mushrooms and 3 small fresh onions.  I served it over mashed potatoes,and the au jus was SO GOOD, and with a spinach salad...delicious!!!!!

This is the best.  It will now replace my old slow cooker roast pork recipe.  I followed someone else's suggestion and thickened the gravy with cornstarch at the end.

Wow!  Hard to say anything that hasn't been written about how good, fast and easy this is.  I made just as written except I forgot the black pepper.  I used a 2 3/4 lb pork tenderloin and cooked on LOW for 4 1/2 hrs. and used Merlot and jarred minced garlic.  It was NOT too salty or too garlicky.  My only issue is putting this on at the appropriate time so as not to overcook for dinner at 7:30.  This is perfect for a midday Sunday dinner, leaving time for church, etc. 5 stars all the way.

Found a pork loin in the freezer.  Looked for a slow cooker recipe to prepare it.  Used this recipe; had low expectations.  Made no substitutions and added no extras.  Used good wine.

This is a "just doesn't get any easier" type of recipe.  Throw the ingredients into the slow cooker, turn it on and leave it alone.

Hardly any aroma while cooking (unlike some slow cooker recipes).

My wife tasted it while I was otherwise occupied.  She exclaimed how very good it was.  I tasted it and thought, "Can pork loin get any better?"  Probably the best tasting pork loin I've ever sunk my teeth into.

I was looking for a recipe for pork loin, which I had never made before. I assumed pork tenderloin was the same, but it is not. My guess is pork loin would be the better meat to use for the crock pot as a tenderloin is smaller and, well, tender. Tenderloin can be seared on high heat in a short time. The five pound loin I bought could not. 
I wasn't sure how to adjust this recipe for my 5.5 pound boneless loin. After four hours on low I checked the temperature because I was so afraid it would dry out. It was done. However, it was not falling apart done. I left it on warm a few more hours, sliced it thin and served it in the sauce. 
Btw, although the meat portion was tripled, I only doubled the sauce. There was plenty because of the juices from the pork. I used a Cabernet Sauvignon. Next time I will use fresh onion instead of the soup packets. 
I planned on using the bits of leftovers for a quick supper over baked potatoes, but there were no leftovers.

Probably won't make it again.   Something just tasted off...I followed exactly  what was stated.   Perhaps it was the garlic and/or wine.   Should have thickened the au jus.

I didn't have the onion soup mix so I took another reviewer's advice and added onions, beef broth, garlic, thyme, rosemary, worcestershire sauce and fresh parsley.  Served with the au jus over mashed potatoes and meat.  It was melt in your mouth deliciousness! The whole family loved it and asked for more.

I was hesitant about this one, because I don’t think pork tenderloin needs to be cooked in a slow cooker.  It is already a very tender cut of meat and doesn’t need to be cooked “low and slow” to become tender.  This recipe would be better suited to a pork loin roast, but I needed the ease of using my slow cooker, so I forged ahead.  I made half the recipe and mine was actually overdone in 2 hours, 40 minutes.  The “au jus” was so salty I had to dilute it down with some water to make a decent gravy out of it.  This was ok and Hubs ate it without complaint, but I won’t be making it again.

I suppose that this recipe does not need one more positive review, but I wanted to thank Chowsito for sharing this great dish with all of us. We are big fans of pork tenderloin, but I find that it often dries out in the crockpot. That's obviously because I have been cooking it for way too long. I couldn't believe that only four hours would suffice, but it does. The meat sliced beautifully, and stayed tender and juicy. I did sear it first, and added some fresh mushrooms that I also sauteed, then deglazed the pan with the wine. Served over noodles. It was just perfect, and I will use this recipe often.

While we loved the recipe (my 13-year old son said it was OUTSTANDING!), we weren't thrilled with the use of the dry onion soup mix. Will try the 'healthier' version next time around. If you do make this recipe, it is very, very good and very, very tender. We like our pork a bit on the medium rare side so I cooked it for an hour on high and about another hour on low (put it in too late!).

Love this recipe.  As another reviewer noted, I thickened the au jus to be more of a gravy.  I was amazed at how good this recipe was.  My husband gave rave reviews.

Just OK. Meat was tender, but then, tenderloins are already a tender cut of meat. This should be done with a pork butt or shoulder roast. Save the more expensive pork tenderloins for the grill or oven. And it has waaaaaay too much sodium. Either use the onion soup mix or the soy sauce with some sliced onions but don't use both unless you really love a lot of salty taste in your food.

Great pork!  I made this recipe about a month ago & my family couldn't get enough of it!  The only change I made then was to use low-sodium soy sauce.  Love it!  I'm making it again today & using two 2 pound roasts.  I thought that I'd need to double the liquid but it almost covered the roasts with just the regular amount.  I added sliced red onion to the bottom of the pot as my family wished I'd added some last time.  I may add some mushrooms towards the end.  Either way, this is a great recipe as it is!  LOVE IT!

Great recipe. My family loved it. I used 2 1 lb-ish tenderloins that came pre-marinated. One was teriyaki, one was peppercorn. The peppercorn one came out very spicy, but the teriyaki was great. I'll either use that one again, or go with non-marinated. Excellent!

I love pork tenderloin and was looking for an easy recipe. This was definitely easy, but I was disappointed. As others have mentioned it is very salty (and I really like salt) If you try this you should probably be a big fan of the dried onion soup mix because the pork really absorbed that taste. Based on the reviews I wasn't really sure whether to cook on low or high. I opted for high because I started it so late in the day. I only ended cooking it for about 2 hours. I checked the temp. about every 30 minutes and pulled it out around 155 degrees. It was moist.

Delicious!  Flavor is amazing with the garlic and onion.  The red wine cooks down and adds an unexpected and fantastic taste.  I like to poke the meat and rub garlic into the holes.  I also love garlic so I added enough to coat the top of the meat well.  Turns out moist and flavorful, great recipe!!!!

This sounds very good, but if you're really lazy like me, I have an alternate. Thoroughly cover the pork loin with pepper (LOTS of pepper), add 2 cans cream of celery soup, cook in slow cooker for 8-10 hours. Gravy is amazing.

I skimmed thru the reviews of this recipe and saw everyone raving about it so I wondered if it would be as good as everyone said.  It totally is!  I made it just like the recipe states with the exception of 3 tbsp of garlic (i used 2 tbsp) and I used Sangria red wine.  No other modifications necessary and it was so easy and ready in 4 hrs on high in the crock pot.  I also used a crock pot liner for the first time and clean-up was a snap.  Will make over and over again!

I fixed this for supper last nite.  Both of us loved it.  I used the wine on hand, chillable red, (icky sweet), & the sweetness did not come thru.  Will most certainly make again.  Thanks to Miami Mama for the review.  Also the sauce makes a perfect au jus.

This was good; I added some sage & thyme for more herb flavor.  However, I wouldn't use tenderloin next time.  It's such a tender cut of meat to begin with; cooking the bejeezus out of it just seems to ruin it.  Maybe a chunk of pork loin or butt next time; something with a little more collagen to break down.

This is a wonderful, simple recipe.  I used a boxed Shiraz/Cab blend that I had in a box on the counter.  I could only squeeze 1/2 cup from the bag before it was empty, but it provided wonderful flavor.  Like another reviewer, I studded the loin with about 9 cloves or chunks of garlic (in lieu of rubbing pressed garlic on the meat surface), which I removed at the end of cook time before cutting the meat.  It added good flavor.  After removing the meat, I poured the juices into a sauce pan, simmered them, and stirred in some cornstarch (which I had spooned into a small dish and mixed with some water first to avoid lumps).  This quickly thickened the sauce to a lovely brown gravy, which we served over homestyle mashed potatoes (skins on, sour cream and butter mixed in while mashing).  My husband and kids LOVED it!  Next time, I am going to use low-sodium soy sauce, and consider taking it back to 2 T, because the saltiness was just on the edge of being too much.  Also, I have to admit that my meat was a bit tough and dry (the gravy smothered it oh so nicely, so it was fairly easy to ignore), but I think that has more to do with the cut of meat, or the amount of time I left it in (7ish hours on low), than a problem with the recipe.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The sauce and flavorings are great, but I would never use a tenderloin again for this recipe.  Maybe boneless loin, which is a biiger cut with higher fat content, but the texture of the tenderloin changes too much when slow cooked..  love the technique and sauce but I'll do my tenderloins marinated and oven roasted going forward. Thanks for sharing, I could get a lot of ideas from these flavors...

This really isnt a good way to cook a   tenderloin.  Mine was over cooked and not as tender as when I cook them in the oven. Tnederloins are tender anyway.

Made this yesterday and everyone loved it! A few tweaks: Added 1 tbsp Worcestshire Sauce, some rosemary, a couple of garlic cloves, substituted low-sodium beef broth for the water, used low-sodium soy sauce.  I had recently opened a bottle of pinot noir so I used that and everything blended well. I cooked it for about 4 3/4 hrs on low and it was perfect!

Just amazing! I added some potatoes and carrots while the pork was cooking. I also seared the meat before putting into pot and deglazed the pan and added that to the pot as well. I didn't use wine, instead I used chicken broth. I made a butter/flour roux and thickened up some of the broth the meat made and turned that into gravy to go over everything. Just great! Thanks for sharing!

I used a pork shoulder roast and cooked it on low for about 10 hours.  I also used low sodium soy sauce.  Great flavor and very tender.

We made this for a nice Sunday meal and boy were we impressed!

I used Pork Country Ribs and Onion-Mushroom soup mix, only because it was what we had on hand.  But it didn't deter from this dish being excellent!

We served it with Roasted Potatoes and Veggies and it all turned out so great, we're fighting over the leftovers. :)

Absolutely loved.  It was so tender and flavorful.  I followed the recipe as originally written, but did add extra cloves of garlic in "slits" in the meat and quite a bit of freshly ground pepper.  Delicious with mashed potates!  Will definitely make again.

Made this last weekend, amazing.  As Lauri suggested, I studded the tenderloins with garlic.  Then I seared the roasts.  One twist I added was to throw in a sliced medium onion on the bottom of the crock pot.  Placed the loins on this, added the soup and more garlic, the liquid, and let it cook.  Absolutely wonderful.  Served this over a bed of egg noodles.

I slightly modified this recipe according to some suggestions: I added slivers of garlic in the tenderloin before cooking it (by making holes in the tenderloin with a knife and putting slices of garlic in the slits). I also used 1/2 of what the recipe calls for of LOW SODIUM soy sauce and replaced the other half with worcestershire sauce. And I used 1 cup of cooking red wine (instead of 3/4 cup). Everything else as stated. I cooked it on low for four hours. I cut the meat and cooked it for an additional 30 minutes. I served it with the Tasty Green Beans and the Easy Mushroom Rice recipes which were a great compliment. AWESOME MEAL!

WOW! Words cannot describe how WONDERFUL this recipe is! I was worried by the number of reviewers that mentioned that you could really taste the "red wine" in the end result so I substituted beef broth for the red wine.  I was out of soy sauce so I also substituted with 2 TBL of Worcestershire sauce.  Very good meal! We used the extra sauce as a dipping sauce along with the meat.  Very moist and tender!

Outstanding.. gets a five for ease and flavor.  I took the advice from several reviews and used only a third of the soy sauce and two thirds worcheshire sauce.  After about 4 hours and the meat fell apart so nicely, I took the liquid, added some water - enough for the amount of gravy I wanted and brought that to a boil.  I mixed up some cornstarch and milk(can be water but I like creamier gravy) and poured it into the boiling drippings.  Makes an incredible tasting gravy for potatoes, rice or noodles, and over the meat.  My significant other told me dinner was very good 4 times before he left that night.

This was very tender and moist. I actually did not have red wine so substituted red wine vinegar and some honey and brown sugar and molasses to even out the bitterness of the vinegar. I cooked it for 4 hours on low in the slow cooker and it was delicious! I will be making this one again.

This pork tenderloin was fabulous!! I made this for the first time with company over, a little nerveous about that but was relieved when I cut into it and it fell apart.  I might try low-sodium soy sauce though next time to cut down on the sodium, but overall fabulous, would highly recommend.  Great with mashed potatoes:)

I've made this before and I love it. Here's a GREAT idea for the next day left-overs. Pull the pork apart with your fingers and warm in a pan with your favorite BBQ sauce. Voila! Pulled pork BBQ sandwiches.

Not good.  Made for dinner tonight, andI wish I could rid my kitchen of the smell this dish made.  The reviews are all over the place - maybe I didn't use a good quality soup mix.  I refused to eat it, my husband did eat it.  Check out Kabob Marinade on this site, and use that for your pork tenderloin!

This recipe was OK.  Way too salty for my taste.  Maybe next time I'll only use 1/2 of the onion soup mix. The roast smelled delicious while it was cooking though.

This was sooo good - everyone we've made it for has loved it!  Very tender and the gravy is excellent.  I use the same wine in the recipe that we plan on having with dinner, as previously suggested.  I also did the suggested garlic rub and then used constarch to thicken the gravy.  A truly great (and easy) recipe.  Thank you!  :)

I wanted a recipe that was easy to start and walk away from on a hot summers day for a delicious supper. I was very disappointed with this recipe!  It was tender (most tenderloin recipes are), easy (most slow cooker recipes are) and easy clean up which ends the positive part of this rating!  It was not tasty at all!  The garlic dominated the taste!  Will never make it again!

Wow, this is how I'm making slow cooker pork from now on. Only thing i did different was use a non tenderloin roast. I forgot to put in the soy sauce but i don't know how much of a difference it made. My roast was closer to 3lbs so it took about 5 hours. So good!

This recipe has a major flaw ... cooking time/temperature. 
After 4 hours at low, I tested the temperature ... only 105 degrees. That is far too low for pork. 
Perhaps 4 hours at high ... perhaps 1 hour at high and then 3-4 hours at low might work. In any case 4 hours at low is inadequate from a food safety point of view.

I am a Nanny/House Manager and part of my responsibilities is to make dinner every night.  Sometimes I am at a loss as to ideas.  I came across this and decided to give it a try.
By the time I got home that night I had several text messages from my employer stating that it was AMAZING! My boss said "this tastes like something I would eat in a nice restaurant."  I followed the recipe exactly except that I added a little more wine and when the 4 hours were up I turned off the crock pot and sliced the pork into serving sizes and let each piece "soak" in the broth.  Yummy!!

Incredibly tasty and very easy to make.  Cook it for the suggested time and you have a tender pork loin that tastes great.  I did find different ways the more I used the recipe.  Once, it worked out that it cooked longer than the suggested time (5.5 hours) I found that the meat simply broke down and became a lovely "pulled pork" dish. For leftovers, I simply threw the "pulled pork" into a pan with some spicy BBQ sauce, caramelized it a bit, then served it on fresh hoagie rolls.  Yum!!!

FANTASTIC! I used a pork loin roast (did not sear) and did change up a few things.
-I swapped the wine for 1/2 cup of Wild Turkey Bourbon 101 
-used fresh sliced onions in addition to the onion soup mix
-used almost a whole bulb of garlic, minced by food processor
-added thyme
-added sliced (canned) mushrooms towards the last 30 mins of cooking (4 hours on high)
-thickened the final sauce with a heaping tablespoon of cornstarch in 1/4 cup water

I have cooked this cut of meat before, using different methods, and have never been as pleased as I was today. The flavor had an aromatic sweetness to it, the meat was soft and tender, and it was easy to throw together. Served with rice & broccoli and my 19 month old son gobbled it up just as enthusiastically as his mom and dad did. :-)

Great recipe! However, some changes are needed. I, too, found the tenderloin to be a bit too salty even though I replaced the regular with the reduced sodium soy sauce. Also, I used a 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (never cook with something that you wouldn't drink, and cooking wines are just plain heinous), 2 frozen garlic cloves, and added a pack of fresh cremini mushrooms, two small pinches of rubbed sage and thyme, 3 lbs. of tenderloin along with the rest of the listed ingredients in a 5 qt. cooker on low for six hours. The house smelled amazing, and the juices were extemely flavorful. Also, I placed the meat on a dish to rest. Strained the liquid and placed it in a pot and added some cornstarch along with H20. I served the meat and gravy with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.

Again, it was a tad bit salty for my taste even with the substition (I added a little sugar to the gravy about 2-3 pinches to help mash the salty taste). Next time I'll cut the reduced sodium soy sauce in half and maybe add worcestershire sauce.

Oh my yum!  This was awesome!!  I think I could have drank the juices left over in the crock pot, it was that good!  I followed the recipe exactly and couldn't think of any way to improve... loved it!

Started with 4 pd pork loin and made a second awesome meal with leftovers.  Doubled all ingrediants plus added one sliced whole onion and worcestershire sauce.  Cooked on high 2 hours then low four.  Took 2/3 juices and made gravy with adding a bit of beef soup stock and cornstarch.Served with mashed potatoes and salad.  Son and husband loved gravey, daughters and I loved remaing juice over it.  One half of all was leftover so I threw gravy in with meat and juice and put in fridge . Two nights later I put all back in crockpot for 2hrs. On low. I shredded the very tender meat and we had pork and gravy over brown rice ! A second huge hit from one original recipe !!

I'm not sure how so many reviewers have this recipe 4 & 5 stars. I am an experienced cook and decided to try an easy crock pot recipe. I was very disappointed as the meat turned out flavorless. This was little more than boiled pork.

I have made this a lot and we love it.  The smell is amazing as it is cooking.  I always make as stated except I do not brown before putting in the crockpot and I usually use a 4 pound pork roast.  I actually put this all together before going to work in the morning and let it cook all day.  Great recipe!

This was delicious. I doubled the recipe and ended up cooking it on high for 4 hours because of this, which made it so tender it fell apart.

I drank most of the leftover wine while this was cooking, so my review may be somewhat off.  I liked it a LOT, used a cheaper pork roast, low sodium soy sauce, and served it with the au jus over garlic mashed potatoes.  *hiccup* I cooked it for 7-8 hours on low, perfect for a 2+ pound roast.  Sear it first if you are serving for company, but for family, it would be just fine the way it is.

The recipe was amazingly simple and delicious! I cooked it on high instead of low for about 3.5-4 hours. I didn't have the onion soup mix so I looked up a recipe on here for it and found it. Dry Onion Soup Mix. I didn't have the bouillon granules so I looked to see if there was a reccipe for that! No go, I didn't have the celery seed anyway so went to the store and got the ingredients to make the Onion Soup Mix for my Amazing Pork Tenderloin. I used a 2009 Chambourcin red wine grown in Gold Hill, NC at Morgan Ridge Vineyards, about an hour away from where I live. Great wine, great recipe, great tenderloin! Served with fresh zuchinni  from my garden sauted in olive oil and Mrs. Dash.

I was nervous about the amount of saltiness from other reviews, but made recipe as written.  Came out SOOOOOOO tender and delicious.  I did not thicken the au jus because I served green bean casserole and mashed potatoes, so the au jus was a "lighter" addition than a thick gravy.  We'll be loving this again soon!  Simple but tasty recipe to serve to guests too.

Wow!  This was wonderful!  I used a large pork loin in my crockpot, and turned it on in the morning.  The house smelled great.  I was unable to get home when I planned to turn it off and it cooked several hours longer.  It turned out wonderfully tender!  The meat fell apart and melted in our mouth!  Thanks for sharing a dish I will definitely make again!

Boy, I really wanted to like this, but there was just so much liquid (nearly 2 cups including the soy sauce) that what happened was the pork loins just slowly boiled to death and ended up all shrunk up.  Tasted okay but I'm glad I tried this for myself before planning a dinner around it.

It is a very tastey and easy recipe!   I put my pork in still slightly frozen and had it on low all day - the meat was very tender (and slightly overcooked) and fell apart.   Next time, I will put the tenderloin in the crockpot straight from the freezer.   Thanks to Chowsito for a different and tastey recipe for pork that my whole family loved!

I have never written a review although I cook from this site all the time. Like another reviewer I had my doubts using pork tenderloin in a slow cooker as well, but I followed the recipe which I usually don't do either. I did add a lot of garlic cloves in slits in the pork, lined the bottom of the pan with sliced onions I had on hand, and covered the pork with jarred chopped garlic (we like a LOT of garlic). Cooked on high for 4-5 hours (was slightly frozen when I started)and basted with the wine sauce 4-5 times. When I went to go take it out of the crockpot, it fell completely apart. So what I ended up with was the best and leanest pulled pork you have ever had- on a toasted roll and some of the au jus- awesome. Not what I started out expecting, but really good just the same.

The vast majority of the reviews sounded amazing, so I tried this recipe yesterday.  I had a 2.30lb pork tenderloin that I cooked for the 4 hours on low and followed the instructions exactly... the result was a dry, overcooked disaster.

Delicious!  I was a little skeptical after reading the other reviews about there being too much salt or having too much garlic, but it did not.  Great flavor, very moist, and easy to make!  This will definitely go into our dinner rotation!  The only change I made was halving the recipe and subbing cran/raspberry juice for the wine, since that is what I had on hand.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

My boyfriend made this, and it was great! I never would have thought about it.  I can see how it could be too salty for some....the soy sauce plus Lipton Soup mix is a salty combo.  If salt is a problem, I would suggest using half the Soup Mix envelope and Low Sodium soy. I wouldn't skip the soy because it gives it that extra little something.  If anything add some more water?  I can see this being waaaay to salty if you were try try to use the sauce as a gravy.  Just a few spoonfuls over the meat on a plate is all you need. Less is more!!

Absolutely fantastic! I took advantage of some of the comments already posted. I used an onion instead of the soup mix and cut slits in the pork for the garlic - used about half a clove. I cooked on high for 4 hours and low for one. It was so incredibly tender - definitely no knife needed!. The flavor was great. I also added carrots which cooked perfectly in the juice. This was my first time cooking tenderloin and I will definitely be making this recipe again!

There was an aftertaste from the wine that was just bitter.  The meat was fall apart tender and I accidentally used 2 tenderloins instead of what I thought was 1 giant one, I am thoroughly disappointed.

This pork turned out delicious, the whole family loved it. I followed suggestions and used LOTS of seasonings for flavor, seared the meat too. Just add any & all types of seasonings that appeal to you, it's very versatile. I don't think the soy sauce added anything, just salty. The gravy was wonderful, just too salty. I would leave out the soy and not even salt the meat next time. I strained the juices into a saucepan, thickened with corn starch. Even the kids loved it. Will make again, with less salt next time. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I made this for our Sunday dinner and it was delicious.  We don't drink, but I bought a bottle of Cabernet Sauvinion... (SP)...  It was worth it to make the recipe using the ingredients called for.  I, too, thickened the juices with cornstarch and adjusted the seasoning with worsteshire sauce.  I made scratch garlic/sour cream mashed potatoes and steamed whole green beans.  My sister in law made corn as well and we had Hawaiian rolls.  Dinner was a Sunday Blessing.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It is in my recipe box for sure.

LOVED this! Made a few minor changes based on what I had in the house. Onions and beef broth for soup mix and water. Worcestire for soy sauce. Other than that, I made it exactly as it was written, and I was tempted to lick my plate clean!

We loved it!  Used chicken stock instead of wine and browned the roast before baking.  Had a 1.5lb sirloin pork roast.  Didn't have time for crock pot so I cut it in half and baked it in the oven at 375 for 45 min.  In a 9x13 with chunked potatoes, both the pork and potatoes turned out fabulous.  Served both smothered in the extra juices/sauce.  Really good!!!

Super delicious! Was looking for a healthy Easter meal to cut down on calories and this fit the bill! 4 stars, not 5, why? The fresh garlic was a little heavy at 3 tbsp. I will lessen to 1 tbsp. next time and may substitute for something other than dry onion soup mix to be a little heathier. Also, I will add a little bit of a spice rub to the top. Used an extra lean pork tenderloin and it was super tender and not dry in the least bit.

Other than that, served with some small red potatoes and a delicious salad and we had a yummy, healthy Easter dinner that didn't feel low-fat! Great recipe!

Just made this today. I put it on low at 9:00am and just pulled it out (8.5 hours). It has good flavor, but quite salty. Is it because I cooked it too long? I also sliced little holes in the loin and put whole garlic cloves in (as well as the minced garlic). I think I'll make it again... not sure how to not make it as salty though, I didn't add any salt.

I am glad that I read the reviews before preparing this because it would have been really bland if I hadn't.  I browned the tenderloin before putting it the crock pot, I added garlic to the inside of the meat by poking it into the meat, I also added the spices that someone else suggested in their review.  I can't remember them off the top of my head but the review is on here.  The final product was very good.  My son had a friend eat dinner with us and I have never seen a kid eat something so fast.

I love this recipe. Top reason is simplicity. The short list of ingredients and no prep is key for me with a toddler around! And yes, it tastes good! 

I end up doubling it due to the pork loin packs we get at Costco. I also skip the garlic - not because we don't like it but because we use it too much.

On day two, I keep some meat to the side and the rest I shred to either add BBQ sauce for pulled pork sandwiches or soak in the sauce and use for pulled pork quesadillas/burritos.

I'm giving this 5 stars because the end result was fabulous. Tender, sweet, yet savory. Oh and of course EASY! I did not have dry onion soup mix on hand so I created my own (fresh onion, dry onion powder, dry beef broth powder, chili powder, cayenne, turmeric, salt and pepper). I also added a touch of worcestershire sauce.

This is delicious. The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that I used fresh onion instead of onion soup and I liked it better that way (less salty.)

I'm giving this a 3 because my husband loved it but I didn't really care for it. He wants me to make it again but truthfully, I think I'm going to keep looking. Don't get me wrong it was decent but definitely not worth it (for me anyways). I did find it too salty but then again I anticipated that it would be because of the previous reviews so I served the tenderloin with mashed sweet potatoes and that was excellent;especially with the sauce. I also cooked the meat for 3 and a half hours in the slow cooker and the meat was perfectly cooked. I thickened the remaining juice and made a gravy. I thought it was good for a one-time deal but I don't think I would serve it at a dinner party. I even used low sodium soy sauce as well as only half the package of onion soup mix but still incredibly salty. If my husband didn't like it, I may have only given it a 2. He was crazy for it though, had 3 servings. He said on a scale of 1 to 10 he'd give it a 9.8 (and not a 10 because he says nothing is ever perfect). So really my advice is try it. From the variety of reviews some people really love it (my husband amongst them), some people find it simply ok (me for example) and some people truly detest it.

I have to say that my family did not like the recipe.  I don't know if it would have come out differently if I used a different type of wine; I used a Cabernet.  But regardless, they did not like the taste.
The texture however was perfect.  I can however appreciate how others may have liked the flavor;  just a little strong for us.

Using the suggested "I did not care for this recipe" site-prepared, white-washed statement for a one-star rating at All Recipes belies the disappointment this recipe wrought. My first review of this was considered too harsh for this site if that's any indication of my opinion of it. If you are more the Julia Child, Barefoot Contessa brand of cook, keep looking for a pork tenderloin recipe.

Made as written except only used half the garlic.  It was wonderful.  The meat was tender and juicy and the flavor was out of this world!  Definitely a keeper.  Made really good sandwiches the next day also.

Excellent.  I waited to add the wine until the last hour, when I whisked in some cornstarch.  Very tender and tasty.  I'll definitely be making this again!

LOVED this recipe! It was my first time using a crock pot (6 qt oval) and I was hooked. I made two other dinners in it that same week! I took some advice from other reviewers: 1) Seering in a pan made a prettier loin in the end. It also eliminated some of the fat. 2) Poking a knife into the meat a few times and shoving in a half a clove or even a whole one was easier and a fantastic treat inside the meat. I couldn't be more pleased with this recipe. Shared it with all of my co-workers!

This is an awesome recipe.  I added some Taragon and used fresh onion instead of the dry onion pack.  I also made my au jus into a gravy by making a quick rue to mix with it.  Served over homemade mashed potatoes.  This was A-MAZING!!!

I made this for dinner last night. It was tender and very flavorfull! I doubled all of the ingredients because I had a 6 lb. roast.  I also diced 3 slices of bacon, sauted them in a skillet then browned the roast in the bacon drippings.  I added the diced bacon to the juice in the crockpot. I also made the onion powder/galic powder rub that someone else suggested and used Port wine.  This meal was so flavorful I will definitely make it again.

cooking a true pork tenderloin in liquid over 4 hours is oing to yield a tender meat. This recipe has good bones but I did not enjoy the end result. My loin was two pieces weighing just above 2lbs. I followed the directions as described. My ending result was a tender meat. The fat and other pieces floating were grey rown all over the meat. It was not an attractive presebtation, yes I wiped it off but it wasn't a "pretty" result. Taste was why I will not make this again. It tasted like red wine with a garlic kick. I think this recipe would be better with a red meat roast because the meat itself has strong flavor vs. Pork and would be partnered well rather than overwhelmed. My three kids and I all give it a thumbs down.

Absolutely the best! My guests raved about this pork. And it was so easy! The only thing I changed was based on other reviewers suggestions, I seared the pork first and substituted 1/4 cup worcestershire sauce for soy sauce and used 1 1/2 tbsp fresh thinly-sliced garlic for minced.

My only major change was in replacing the dry onion soup with a fresh onion, cut in rings.To the cup of water, I added a tsp. of beef stock. My choice of wine was what I had... a Chianti. Other than that, it came down to adding a bit more flavor. I added rosemary, thyme, celery powder, a splash of worcestershire, granulated garlic and parsley. Cook time was right on, and the Tenderloin was "melt in your mouth." Strained the onion into the au jus to thicken the gravy slightly, (which was delish,) and served with mashed potatoes.

The pork came out very tender.  Crockpot times always differ so mine was done in less than 3 hours.  I will try searing it next time like one reviewer suggested before putting it in the crockpot.  I added way too much garlic so I will use less next time.  I thickened it to make a gravy but I think it's best left as an au jus as the gravy was too salty.  Basically, I should've left the recipe as it is!  But delicious overall!

This recipe is so delicious, but i changed it just a little. instead of placing the tenderloin in the cooker whole, i sliced it into three large pieces so that it absorbs more of the flavors of the broth :)

This recipe was fantastic! Everyone in my family loved it. I followed the recipe to the T because the ingredients seemed perfect---and they were. For the wine I used a Merlot. I served this with some mashed potatoes and baby carrots. I did thicken the sauce a bit after the pork was cooked and had been taken out of the slow cooker. I used 2 tbsp of cornstarch and enough water to dissolve it.  It was the best pork tenderloin I have evert made.  In my recipe box it goes!  Thanks you for a wonderful recipe Chowsito :)

My family loved this when I made it a couple months ago as written. So, yesterday when my daughter and I were coming up with a father's day menu she thought of this. It's cooking in the crock pot now. Serving with mashed potatoes, carrots and the Country Apple Dumplings from this site.

Very good pork tenderloin.   Loved the ease of cooking.   Added an additional hour to cook time because I like my tenderloin well done.   Worked well, and did not end up dry at all. Would recommend.

Easy and delicious! Prepared two tenderloins at once, just added more wine and water, and they were perfect. Cooked about 6 hours. Leftovers will be great in tacos, enchiladas or with BBQ sauce.

ok - this was terrible. I followed the directions EXACTLY - it was dry and chewy and the flavor was... not good.  I can make a great pork tenderloin in about 20 min or so - why anyone would put a pork tenderloin in a crock pot is beyond me - I don't know what i was thinking.

I should have known from the recipe ingredients.  The meat was moist and had great flavor, but way too salty!

Fabulous!  Whole family loved it, especially 12-yr old son!  Made as directed except for adding a couple of dashes of Worcestershire and adding cornstarch to thicken the gravy. Thank you!

We made this for New Year's Day, and it was awesome! Followed directions pretty much as written, except for adding a chopped onion, and a little extra red wine and soy because the tenderloin was close to 3 lbs. Also cooked it longer...closer to 6 hours on low. Meat was delicious...very flavorful and extremely tender. Wonderful, impressive main course...I'll be making this one again and again. Thanks for sharing!

I got very nervous after reading the mixed reviews on this, but it turned out really good.  Although I changed the recipe as well.  I put the onion mix w/ the water as directed- but changed my mind after I was looking at the LOADS of salt in crock pot...so I bailed most it out.  I would use the mix but 1/2 and 2 cups H20.  I used Shiraz and splash of Worchestershire instead of SOy.  I agree you can use cheaper cuts but I had the tenderloin so I went ahead.  I also cooked on LOW for 6 hrs and meat was tender and moist.  Very yummy and good left overs

We did not care for the flavor of this recipe at all.  I will not make this again.  I agree with another review that it may be better flavor for a beef roast instead of a pork loin.  Having said that I will add that it was perfectly cooked & tender in 3 hours on high in my corck pot.  Along with the pork, I cooked whole yukon gold potatoes and they were perfectly done as well.

I also used a 3 1/2 lb. pork loin,and clos du bois carbernet sauvignon for the wine. I cooked it all day on low while I was at work and then turned it up to high for the last 1 1/2 hour. Really tender and great flavor. A nice change of pace from the normal roasted pork loin. I will make again!

Delicious! My husband just loved it. To my dismay I didn't have the onion soup so I diced up 1/2 an onion and added that to the top of the meat. It wasn't as moist as I thought it would be but that was my fault. I let it go about 5 hours instead of 4. It was such a busy Saturday and the time passed by. It had some great flavor to it. Others say it's bland. Not at all. Mashed potatoes complimented this nicely with the gravy. I did add some cornstarch to the gravy to thicken it up some. Will have to do this again when we have another busy, busy day.

This recipe has potential, but I thought it needed some changes.  The amount of garlic was WAY too strong, and I think the pork should be browned before placed in the crock pot.  I will try this recipe again and hope that these changes make it yummy.

I really enjoyed this recipe -- it couldn't be more simple.  Great for a week-night quick meal.  I did as others suggested and seared the tenderloin first before putting it into the crockpot.  After it was done, I also removed most of the reserved juice and put it into a sauce pan with some sliced mushrooms and thickened it just a bit with a cornstarch mixture.  Made a great gravy for the pork.  My 8-year old seafood-lover of a daughter even asked for seconds of this one.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and 7 year old LOVED this.  I'm back to make it for the 3rd time. We change it a little each time to try various flavors. We all loved it just as much when we used a rich dark beer instead of the wine and used a spicy pepper blend rather than black pepper.

Husband made this for us tonight. It was really good. He did as others suggested and used chicken stock instead of water, browned the tenderloin before adding and left out the soy sauce and used real onions instead of the onion soup mix.
The smell of it cooking nearly drove us crazy. We will be making this again soon.
Would of given it more stars, but since he changed it so much, I do think it would of been pretty salty if cooked per recipe.

FANTASTIC!!! This recipe is a keeper. Followed the directions but used 2 cans of low sodium chicken broth in stead of water and low sodium soy sauce. We like alot of gravy which is also out of this world. You won't be disappointed. I plan on trying this on a regular pork roast.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a HUGE HIT!!  I followed other readers advise and cut out the soy sauce, however, I followed everything else exactly.  The meat was just falling apart, it was so tender and juicy.  The flavor combo of red wine, garlic, and onion was fantastic!!

Pork was tender and tasted good without the sauce.  I did thicken the sauce with some cornstarch but it was way too salty (and I love salt).  I think I will look for a better recipe next time.

Great recipe. I skipped the soy sauce (salt!) because the soup has a ton.
I added a bay leaf; put slivers of fresh garlic poked in all over the roast, then chopped, fresh mushrooms.
I started on high, but lowered it to low after two hrs. Thickened gravy with corn starch & water last five mins.
It was mouthwatering.
Served mashed potatoes, glazed carrots, and steamed, fresh broccoli.
This will be made again!
P.S. I put in a 2 lb. roast, I should have cooked 3 lbs. Almost no leftovers!

Oh My Goodess!  This roast was soooo yummy!  I let it cook all day in the slow cooker while I was at work and it was still tender and delicious.  I poured the juice through a strainer to get out all the particles, then added cornstarch and water to make a gravy.  My family loved it!  Thanks for a great easy recipe.

This recipe was wonderful!  I added a bit of real onion and layed it on top of the cooking pork.  I put it on low for about 8-9 hours and  it just melts in your mouth.  Made awesome gravy from the juice also.

Made this yesterday and it was wonderful.  Both my husband and his brother really liked it (and that' saying for my picky brother-in-law).  Made it as stated (except for the wine which id didn't have) and it was perfect.

This recipe was another slow cooker tenderloin disappointment. The broth was nice on the potatoes and vegetables, but much more than the broth was necessary to make the meat palatable. It was tough even though I removed it before the estimated cooking time was completed.
I am a frequent user of successful slow cooker recipes but this did not provide me with the one recipe that was worth the price or the effort. I am still searching.

Okay, so normally I don't change things in a recipe that looks great but I only had center cut pork chops...so I used them and all the same ingredients.  I put them in the oven on 350 for 40 minutes and it was delicious!!!!  Wonderful all the way!

I'm sorry to say I didn't like this.  I had high hopes and followed the recipe precisely, despite the fact that I usually take some liberties to adjust to our taste.  This seemed like something we would be ok with.  Nope!  

The texture of the meat was amazing - very moist and falling off the fork. Absolutely perfect!  However, I can accomplish this by cooking pork in any kind of liquid for hours in the slow cooker.

I actually let it sit on low for about 8 hours in the slow cooker (had to work and no timer on my pot) and it was at 160 degrees when I got home - the temp the package said the tenderloin would be perfect at.  I was a bit worried at first that it would be overdone but it worked out wonderfully.

The sauce though - not a big fan at all.  It was overly salty and very, very garlicy.  I think the soy sauce overpowered the wine immensely and didn't go well with the pork flavor at all.  Neither myself or my boyfriend found the smell appetizing and we both agreed that it was almost as if this dish couldn't quite figure out what flavor it should embrace.  I also think a whole packet of onion soup was way too much.

I don't think I'll be making this again.  It was an unfortunate bust for us.  If I could've saved the meat without the flavor I would've been happy but as it was, I just threw it out as there was no hope for seconds, let alone leftovers.

Very good.  I used beef broth instead of red wine (as someone else suggested) b/c I wasn't sure if everyone would like the wine taste.  I also used 1/2 soy sauce and 1/2 worcester sauce.  I added red potatoes and carrots 2 hrs. after I started the crock pot and they were just right - not to soft, not too hard.  Will make this again.

I thought this was great! I used a pork loin, and followed the directions exactly, except that I put it on HIGH for 4 hours, thinking it wouldn't be done it time. Afterwards, it was still excellent but 4 hours on LOW would have been fine. Also, next time, I will double the ingredients to have more sauce left over. Thanks, it was fantastic! ~~And note: a lot of complaints about the recipe say that it has a strong red wine flavor... which makes sense because wine is one of the main ingredients! Be sure to pick a wine you like to drink, or you won't like the end result of the recipe. And if you don't like red wine, you probably won't like something cooked in red wine, but don't give it a bad rating. This is really one of the best meals I've ever fixed!~~

Hands down - this was the tastiest meal I have EVER prepared!!!

Not only was it tender enough to cut with a fork, but the Au Jus drizzled on top made it almost sinful...

Thank you - I now have something easy to whip up for an Anniversary dinner I have coming up in a couple of weeks :):):):)

AMAZING! Every pork tenderloin I've ever eaten was sliced thin and still dry. Pork is usually pretty bland unless you drown in it something. Wow! I could eat this everynight! I followed the recipe pretty closely... I upped the garlic a bit and omitted the soy since I thought the salt from the onion soup mix was enough. I'm glad I did because eventhough I did add a little more salt, the soy would have cut the aroma of the wine. Use the richest red wine you have, it was just delicious. Took about 2 cups of the juice stovetop and made a thicker gravy with some added cornstarch & black better. Then served with garlic mashed potatos. Was planning to slice it but the meat just falls apart. This was just PERFECT! Can't wait to make it again!

Unbelievably tender and delicious.  Thickened cornstarch makes more than enough gravy.

Wonderful flavour. I did have a few problems however. I cooked it the night before intending to reheat the next night, but after the 4 hours, the meat (2 1-lb tenderloins) was tough. (I've never had a tough tenderloin before!) So, since the longer you cook the tenderer it gets, I salvaged the situation by adding enough water to almost cover the tenderloins and left it on low for an additional 6 hours overnight. (Mine is a new, 6-quart slow cooker with a hotter low setting than I'm used to, but I'm unsure whether this contributed to the toughness.) The additional cooking definitely made it tender. I also substituted apple juice for the wine as other reviewers did since I never have wine on hand, but left all other ingredients as specified and the flavour was fantastic. Will definitely make again, but will increase liquid and will not hesitate to leave it to cook all day. A+++!!

It was wonderful and easy to prepare.  I took others advice on the second preparation and reduced the soy sauce.  It was too salty with 3 TBLS.  I used maybe 1 tsp.

I gave it a 4 and not 5 stars because.  It was a bit to saltly.  So I added more wine and water.  Later I added Half and Half and cornstarch to thicken it.  It was a hit will make again.  I also use pork loin instead of tender loin.  Next time I'll listen to the others add less soy sauce.

This was ok, the pork was very tender, but the sauce had such a strong wine flavor...next time I may omit the wine and add some pork gravy instead....

This is quite good. Five minutes to toss together and put in the crockpot. I didn't have dry onion soup so I used a sliced whole onion and a cup of beef broth, omitting water. A keeper.

Oh my "LLAU", was this ever good! O.K. I didn't use the onion soup mix because it's just way too salty, but I think that I pretty much replicated what the packaged stuff has in it minus all of the sodium, preservatives, etc. Used a low sodium soy sauce and subbed the water with low sodium beef broth. I seared my tenderloins first and deglazed the pan with the wine. I also added my usual garlic and onion powders along with some fresh garlic and about a tablespoon of dijon mustard. I'm not a meat eater, but I always taste and this was incredible. The meat literally melted in your mouth. I found the need to add some more liquid as it cooked and during the last 30 minutes, I decided to throw in some cremini mushrooms. My family went nuts over this and the wine sauce was to die for. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Too many strong flavours in this, and much too salty. We like garlic but the smell of this cooking was enough to make you open a window. The meat was tender but had absolutely no taste at all. Will not make this again.

This recipe is so easy to make and tastes great! I didn't have red wine, so I used beef broth and it turned out wonderful. I did leave it in the crockpot on low for 9 hours because my boyfriend went fishing. It still turned out awesome...possibly even better because it longer to cook. Will definately make again for years to come!

Fantastic!!!  This is my new pork recipe. Everyone loved it.  Used a Chardonnay instead of the red, it was the wine I was serving with dinner.  My son who likes only peanut butter even ate it without being told to at least 100 times.

My wife complains that I sometimes spend too much time in the kitchen cooking when guests arrive.  I decided to try this slow cooker recipe to reduce the active kitchen time.  Well, much less time away from guests and absolutely excellent results.  Guests raved about it.  Adjusted ingredients to accompany 3 lbs pork tenderloin to serve 8.  To reduce salt, followed advice of other reviewers.  Made my own onion soup mix substitute.  (10 oz frozen diced onions, 1 1/2 t dried parsley, 1 t onion powder, 1 t turmeric, 1/2 t celery seed, 1/2 t sugar).  Also replaced 1/2 of the soy sauce with Worcestershire.  The result was not at all salty but no one added salt at the table.  Several had second helpings and there were no leftovers.  Strained the juices to have a simple and easy flavorful gravy.  The quantity was more than adequate.  Will definitely make this again.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe for the crockpot.  My family enjoyed it.  For those who have had problems and issues with the cooking time, this recipe is for a "TENDERLOIN' pork roast.  I believe most of the problems result from people using a "PORK LOIN".  This is a completely different cut of meat and will not cook as quickly as the tenderloin.  Be sure what you are buying.  If you use the tenderloin it will cook in about 4 hours.

This is one of my new favorite recipes!! My only issue was the cooking time , I cooked mine on high temp for 4 hrs and it came out perfect...The sauce is yummy!I also browned my roast on al sides first to keep the meat juices locked in ..tender and juicy fit for company!

This was so delicious!! I cooked it for 4 hours as suggested, and took it out of the crockpot and covered it with aluminum foil for about 60 minutes while I made oven roasted baby red potatoes and fresh green beans. I strained the au juis sauce and poured it into individual ramekins. This is a keeper and I definitely would make it for guests.

My husband and I both thought that this was excellent. I used all of the ingredients as listed, but I also did a dry rub of: black pepper, white pepper, salt and Rosemary, then seared the roast on each side before placing it in the crock pot. I also added steak cut mushrooms, baby carrots and white onion wedges. I cooked this on high for three and a half hours, (1.6 lb tenderloin), and served it over mashed potatoes. It was so yummy!

I  make  this  often.  The  flavor is  good,  but then, we  love  garlic. I would  reccommend for those  who don't, to  cut  back to  1 1/2 Tb. I  also added  my Simon and  Garfunkle spice  mix.  On occasion,  I  trade  out the  red wine  with  apple  juice.  It  is  less  overpowering than the  red wine. (Parsley ,Sage. Rosemary, and  Thyme) That  adds the  extra  flavor  some people  crave in pork. Overall, this  is  a wonderful  basic  Pork  loin  meal, We will have this  again.This  came  out  very  tender,  These days,  crockpots  vary in times, and  heat. For those  who had a dry roast,  maybe  it  was  cooked too long. I have 3 crockpots, and  have  learned to adjust  recipes  accordingly,  to  suit the recipe. If you wound  up with  a tough texture, but  it was  not  dry,  it  probably need  more  cooking time  in your  crockpot. If  it  came  out  dry, your  pot  probably cooks faster than the  one that  was  use  originally.

Amazing is the word. This was so good. I didn't have any wine so I substituted chicken broth. The flavors worked so well together. I did brown my tenderloins in a little olive oil (trick my mom taught me). Enhances the flavor. I deglazed the pan with the chicken broth and poured it in. Took the juices and thickened it with a little corn starch slurry. The meat was so tender and juicy. Will make again. Thanks for this AMAZING recipe.

I have made this recipe several times now. It impresses every person I make it for. It is absolutely delicious and needs no variation to the recipe. I serve it with home made creamy garlic mashed potatos, and it is sensational. The sauce is amazing, and I use the sauce till it's gone. I wish I could give this 6 stars!

I made this just as the recipe called for with one exception. The prep was done at night and refrigerated over night so I could just plug it in the next morning at 6:00am. The marinade time didn't do it any harm, it was so delicious it surprised me because it was rather simple. Couldn't keep hubby out of it before eating time. The au jus was great over the meat and veggies. Thanks so much.

This was the perfect way to prepare a tenderloin that had been in the freezer for quite a while. I didn't have dry onion soup mix so I used a modified version of a homemade mix I found on this site.

It's super easy to prep, but I thought the gravy was way too salty. Cut the onion mix in half.  Rather bland.

This made the pork loin bitter and left an unpleasant aftertaste.  Can't imagine why anyone would do this recipe more than once.

Fantastic recipe!  Made this last night and it was a huge hit.  The only change/or/addition was to fry the pork roast in olive oil only on the fatty side in a pot on the stove, so it will give it some color as if it was roasted in the oven & added to my slow cooker & followed the directions exactly.

Chowsito, thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us all.

I tried this recipe and my boyfriend and I were not happy with it.  The pork tenderloin turned out dry.  We rarely find a crockpot recipe we don't like…this could be because our pork was slightly under 2 pounds - maybe our bad but we won't be trying this again :(.

Easy and delicious! After reading the reviews, I decided to set my slow cooker to 'high' instead of 'low', and I'm very glad I did. Four hours on low would not have been enough time, but four hours on high was perfect! The meat was fully cooked but still tender. The only change I made was to add rosemary, and then used a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce into gravy. The flavor was amazing, especially with the gravy poured over top! Served with roasted red potatoes and asparagus, my fiance loved it!

I've made this 2x now. My kids & Hubby rave about this meal! This is one of the few meals BOTH my 11-yr-old & 5-yr-old clean their plates!! This is a keeper! Yum!
I made it with the PORK LOIN. Omitted the soy sauce... didn't need it. Once I cooked at high for about 3 hrs. Another time I cooked low for about 5. Came out perfect both times. When the loin is fully cooked, take it out, slice it into individual serving slices. While it's out, I add 2 tbsp flour to the sauce in the crockpot and stir/whisk. It makes a nice, thick gravy. I add the slices back into the crockpot to stay warm until serving.
I served it with oven roasted new potatoes and carrots. My kids love this dinner! Hallelujah! It's rare to find something they both like. :-)

Wow - this was super easy and super good! Followed exactly, except cooked on low for about 8 hours - it just fell apart when we pulled it out.  Very tender and juicy.  Used Marsala cooking wine, with low sodium onion soup  mix and low sodium soy sauce. Delicious! Will make a again and would serve for company.

I read the reviews listed on the main page (most helpful, most critical) and made some adjustments when I prepared this recipe last night.  I made the rub as one reviewer suggested, and then seared the tenderloin before putting it in with the other ingredients.  I used a red cab that was already opened and low sodium soy sauce.  FYI- the tenderloin I used was only 1.5 lbs so I probably should have scaled the other ingredients becaaaause, I found that 2 tbs garlic would've been better than 3 (and I LOVE garlic), and it was too salty.  The salt issue may have to do with the rub I made, so I'd skip the salt all together as there's already plenty of sodium in soy sauce.  The pork came out fork-tender though, and was definitely ready after 4 hrs on high in my 6 qt. crock pot.  I served mine with steamed baby carrots and mashed potatoes and the au jus is perfect for drizzling over all.

We really liked the general taste of this pork tenderloin.  However, I think I need to lessen the soy sauce (I used Bragg's as a substitute) because it was too salty.  Also, the meat fell apart that I could not cut it like a traditional slice of pork tenderloin.  It fell apart into strings and was more like pulled pork.  All the kids would eat again, which is a huge accomplishment!

I made this delicious meal tonight and my husband and I loved it!!! I actually cooked mine in the oven at 350 for about 40 minutes, and it turned out wonderfully!! I was pretty nervous about the results considering I never cook, but was so pleased and will definitely make it again!! Yummy!!!

The original with the dry soup turned out a bit too salty.  I substituted a can of french onion soup instead of the dry soup and cup of water, and it turned out wonderfully.  Very simple and great tasting.

This tasted great.  Ended going 4 hours on high instead of low and it was cooked perfect.  2 lbs was way to much for our family of 4 with 2 kids so next time we'll cut back.  At least we have lunch for tomorrow.  The other great thing about the meal was how good the house now smells.  Thanks for posting this.

Super simple! My family doesn't like anything prepared with the dry onion soup mix...so I seasoned with rosemary, thyme, garlic, salt and pepper. Cooked on low for 4 1/2 hrs. Smells great while cooking and has a great flavor!! Definitely will be using this recipe again! Served with red mashed potatoes and fresh green beans. Family loved it!

TRUST ME.  It is smack yo mama good.  I did exactly what it called for, except I added a Spring floral wine and an Au jus packet instead of an onion packet. And added onion slices.  Everything she promised and you are doing your family or guests a favor. TENDER AND JUICY!!! BAM!! BAM!  BAM!!  One, two PUNCH. and a TKO!!!  we loved it...

The pork turned out really well.  I did cook on high, instead of low, so it became pull apart pork, but it tasted fabulous!

I made this dish following the recipe and family ate it all no problem. Meat was very tender but I thought I might try it again only lightening the flavor a bit. I will try less wine and omit season packet and use real onion and my own seasonings.

I used Marsala cooking wine and thickened sauce with corn starch and water mixture, which made a gravy to serve with mashed potatoes. My husband loved it and he is a picky eater:)

Okay, so we tried this randomly about a month ago. (Pork loins were on sale, and we are fans of the crockpot meals)......

Since then... we have made it 3 times... thats practically once a week. (Heck we even made it last night). The only thing I would suggest, is mincing half the garlic, but the other half leave in bigger pieces. (This is if you are a garlic lover), because then you have pieces to eat with the meat. This is seriously MY FAVORITE RECIPE OF ALL TIME

Just about the most simple,yummy recipe I've tried on this site!  My tenderloin was about 95% frozen at 9:00am, just threw it in the crock with the sauce (used half marsala, half dry sherry, as that's all I had) and it was just phenominal!  Fall apart tender at 7:00pm.  I'll use the rest for pulled pork sammies.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR, a WINNER!

This recipe is amazing.  I doubled the sauce because my tenderloin was over 3 lbs. and cooked it for about 6 hours on low.  I also added a small can of portobello mushrooms when it had about an hour to go and cornstarch dissolved in water to thicken it up at the end.  I had a ton of sauce but it is so delicious I froze it to use with other things later!  The tenderloin was perfectly done, melted in your mouth, unbelievably good flavor.  I served it with mashed potatoes (which we also slathered the sauce all over), salad and bread.  Definitely a keeper - I can't imagine preparing pork tenderloin any other way now!

Delicious! Add a few teaspoons of cornstarch to the crock pot during the last half hour of cooking time to create a nice gravy for the meat. This is a fantastic recipe full of flavor!

I served this recipe to dinner guests last night. I followed the recipe as written. While it was cooking, I was worried that the garlic was going to be too strong.    My guests all gave it a" 10".  I did brown the pork before putting it in the crock pot. My biggest hesitation about making this recipe, was using the crock pot method with such a fine cut of meat. No worry, It turned out wonderful

I used two 1.5lb pork loins, which I rubbed with 1 teaspoon granulated garlic and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper (total, not each) and seared them with a teaspoon of olive oil before putting them in the crockpot; I did *not* add more pepper to the liquid since I'd already used it in the sear. I flipped the loins halfway through cooking and thickened the jus to a gravy consistency on the stove top, whisking in 1 tablespoon each corn starch and flour. I got 2 full cups of gravy after thickening, so it went a bit farther than the meat itself. It is fairly salty, so use a homemade onion soup mix and/or low sodium soy sauce if that is a concern; or just serve it over unsalted potatoes. 4 hours on low should be perfect for a 2lb loin (at least in my crockpot), but it was a bit too long for two 1.5lb loins.

This recipe was just fantastic! I have saved this one to use when I have company. It presents well and can just sit if they are running late. I did use the one suggestion to add 2 tablespoons of corn starch for thickening the gravy. Also don't use a wine that you wouldn't drink as that is one of the primary flavor layers.

This recipe lived up to its name - AMAZING!!  I did a few things different.  I used a 4lb boneless pork loin and browned it with lemon pepper and garlic pepper before adding to the slow cooker. After placing the browned loin in the crock-pot, I followed another member's advice by poking holes on top side of loin, then poured the sauce mixture over it.  I sliced a yellow onion and placed along top and sides, and added a jar of mushrooms as well.  Before cooking, I drizzled olive oil over top of roast.  I cooked on low for 5 hours.  Served with mashed potatoes, steamed broccolli and french bread.

Awesome roast & sooo easy.  I used a 2.59 lb. tenderloin and followed the recipe to the tee.  Made green beans, and mashed potatoes to go with it, and served the au jus from the crockpot on the side to put over roast, potatoes, etc.  My husband and son raved about how good it was, & I "could make it again anytime!!"

This was our dinner Saturday night. I had left it in the slow cooker whilst we went shopping. The pork tenderloin was one that had been in the freezer since the time when our local supermarket was selling them at a really low price.   l would have liked it better if I had used a low salt soy, but that would have been my only complaint. I served it with Colcannon. Colcannon is traditionally made in Ireland from mashed potatoes and kale (or cabbage), with scallions, butter, salt and pepper added. It can contain other ingredients such as milk, cream, leeks, onions and chives. There are many regional variations of this dish.It is often eaten with boiled ham or Irish bacon. At one time it was a cheap, year-round staple food,though nowadays it is usually eaten in autumn/winter, when kale comes into season, I cheated a bit of making this, I had prepared everything, (i only used potatoes, white cabbage and scallions as that was all i had to hand)  in advance, popped the potatoes etc into a microwave rice cooker pot (daft but it does work) and simply put the microwave on for 12 minutes whilst i put all the shopping away when we came back so the only job left to do was to mash the spuds and veg then serve the pork and colcannon which  was dribbled over with the au jus as suggested in the recepie.  Boy what a feed! Two happy campers went to bed happy, full and content.

BORING! I took other's suggestions and added fresh garlic and onion. It still didn't have a lot of flavor. I won't be using this recipe again. I gave it a three because it was tender and an easy recipe.

I would give this 10 stars if I could! This is one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten!! I did a few alterations: 1) I used 1 cup of Merlot and 3/4 cup of beef broth instead of water. 2) I seared the tenderloin as per other suggestions before cooking. 3) And after the pork was done I deglazed the pan with the sauce and made caramelized onions and portebello mushrooms with just a bit of flour to thicken it up. Perfect!

I think you have to be a fan of red wine to like this one.  Too bitter for my taste.

Great recipe!!!  Will definitely make it again.  I know this is weird, but I didn't have the soup packet, so I used a Buttermilk Ranch packet.  I also had a 4 pound tenderloin, so I cooked it on high for 8 hours.  It was incredibly tender after that long in my crock pot!  So good!

Because this recipe had a lot of great views so I decided to try it. This recipe was AMAZING for sure!
Like it said I used the sauce on the side for dipping and I made it into a sandwich using french bread. Toasted the bread and put the pork in the middle and dipped it in the sauce. FANTASTIC! Also, I wanted some veggies so I put potatoes, carrots and onions in the sauce and turned out amazing! This recipe is for sure a MUST TRY!

This was Amazing!  I was totally surprised that it was as good as it was. There is just two of us so we had leftovers and we ate it for several days just in sandwiches.  It is an easy meal to throw together...but tasted like you slaved over it.  Thanks for sharing.

DELICIOUS! I made this tonight and it was a big hit. Didn't modify anything in the recipe - kept as is and it came out perfect. Very tasty and the extra leftover juices were perfect on top of mashed potatoes! Will be making again for sure.

Delicious as is. We are not fans of onions, and usually the dry onion soup is too strong a flavor for me, but everyone raved about it, including I. 
I used a four and a half pound pork loin. It was so tender afterwards! We served it with roasted potatoes drenched in the au jus.

I found this recipe cooked well but the salt content was way too much.  Remember the dry onion soup mix already has salt, soy sauce has salt.  For the amount used here for 6 I would use half the amounts of the soup mix because there is alot of juice when this is done in a slower cooker and I would reduce the soy sauce to 1 1/2 TB.  I thickened the juice right in the slow cooker using Knorr Veloutine Instant Thickener which is used for brown gravies as there are no lumps guaranteed.  Will make again with less saltiness.  Served it with brown rice and pineapple chunks and carrots.

This is the best pork recipe I'ce ever eaten. It is also one of the easiest I've ever made. My husband took one bite and said "I'm in love". Used a 2 3/4 lb 
tenderloin so extended cooking time 1 hr. Trimmed every bit of fat I could find. Used a cooking fork to pierce tenderloin one in the cooker. Followed the recipe with fantastic results. Thanks for this one. I'm putting a copy of it in my will.

Well, after reading 1369 reviews + the high ratings, I thought that this would be a great way of doing my 2 1.5lb tenderloins.  I love garlic but reduced the amount cause 3tbsp is a lot.  Maybe that is a typo and it is was to be tsp.  Which would be reasonable amount, I only used 2tbsp. and with all the talk of it being too salty I also reduced the soy sauce to 3 tsp  NOT the 3 TBSP it calls for. The roast was moist and firm after 4hrs on high, the aroma was great but the taste was just bad. The taste was burnt on garlic!!!!  Even with my adjustments.  In my house we don't throw a bad cook dish out so we chocked it done.  I strained the drippings and turned them in to a great gravy. My hubby that loves garlic more then me did not care for it.  If anyone makes this reduce the garlic to 3tsp or less not tbsp.  SO upset that  this dish didn't turn out and I should of listened to my guy on this but all the great reviews made me want to follow it closely. :(  Also I want to know why all the ppl that have gave it such high ratings are not posting pics of their's.  The pic are by ppl that gave 3+ stars...I would like to seen more pics form 5 star ppl.  DON'T MAKE WITH OUT REDUCING THE  GARLIC TO 3TSP AND SOY SAUCE TO 3-4TSP!!! If you want you can add more salt/garlic but you can't remove it once it is cooked!!!  SOrry this was not even good as written or with my adjustments! :(

Outstanding and easy recipe.  After cooking was complete, I added cornstarch to the liquid for gravey instead of "au jus".  This was a hit at my dinner party.

This was just amazing. I recommend making double the sauce so that there is extra gravy and adding about 2 tbsps of cornstarch to thicken.

I just shred the meat in the sauce and let it all mingle before I server.

Followed the recipe exactly.  The meat was tender.  I had to rinse the meat down, shred it, and drown it in barbeque sauce in order to make it edible.

I made this on two nights ago for dinner, it was delecious! The next time I make this I will check the internal temperature of the pork at three hours, and continue onto the fourth hour as needed. The meat was a tad dry, maybe it only needed 3.5 hours, i cooked a 2.69lb tenderloin. I would also try using some fresh onions along with the onion packet, and alittle more garlic. This is a keeper, served it with garlic mashed potatos and a garden salad. Delicious.

I used this recipe with a 5 lb. Pork Roast.  I double all of the ingredients except the minced garlic and it was succulently delicious!  The red wine I used was a Shiraz and put in a slow cooker.  I'm glad I made the extra trip to the grocery store for the soy sauce because it was worth it.  DEEEE-LISH!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was fantastic!  I've always grilled or roasted pork tenderloin and was looking for a different recipe.  I made a couple changes, partly due to what I had on hand.  I didn't have the onion soup mix so used a mushroom beef mix and added onion powder.  I substituted Worcestershire for the soy after reading another post and thought that sounded good.  The wine I used was a petit syrah which is a nice light red.  The tenderloin I had was only 1 lb.  I put it in my cooker on the Auto setting which starts high then goes down to low.  I checked it after 3 hours and it was already fork tender.  I left it in for another 20 min. or so while I got the rest of my dinner ready and it was perfect.  Served with jasmine rice and fresh green beans it was a super easy yet yummy dinner!  I will definitely make this again and will try adding some herbs like rosemary or sage.

I am a vegetarian and I am the queen of this recipe! There are ooh's and ahh's over this, not by me of course. It is my boyfriend's favorite recipe of all time! He literally cannot get enough of it! I throw all of the ingerdients in a crock pot for 10 hours and it comes out the most tender, juicy piece of animal carcass that it can possibly be! I am told that the Malbec wine I use is supreme over anything else and instead of soy, we use Braggs Liquid Amino Acids. All you carnivores, ENJOY!!!! I'll stick with my side dishes on this one :)

We loved this recipe! The only changes I made was to add 1-sliced onion instead of the onion soup and 1-C. of Chicken broth (in addition to the water because the meat was over 2 lb). The tenderloin was so tender we cut it with a fork. I strained off the liquid and added a roux and butter to make the gravy. Yummy!

Nice. Replaced dry onion soup mix and water with 1 cup French Onion Soup. Dry soup mix has MSG in it & gives DH migraines. Added some Vidalia onion I needed to use up.

This was delicious and easy. I made it for my BF and his response was, "I'm going to be requesting this all the time!" Couple modifications: I didn't have any wine on hand, so I used chicken stock instead. I cooked on low for 4 hours, and while the meat was "done," it was not so tender as to cut with a fork. I let it cook for a couple more hours and it was perfect. I strained the juices and used half to make a gravy and let half as is. Served with creamy, garlic, and parm mashed potatoes.

I love pork loin in the crock pot.  So easy. It was done in 4 hrs and split with a fork.  However, the soup mix did make it salty.  I'll try to find a low-sodium mix or make my own next time.  

My husband was excited about the au jus.  I tried to hand him a plate but he insisted on a bowl!

The pork was good - loved how it just fell apart.  The au jus was a little salty for my taste, even though I used lower sodium soy sauce.  Next time, I'll try using lower sodium soup mix.  Or maybe only a half of the package.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Will make again.

Wow.  My husband LOVES pork tenderloin, and  requested I never ruin a tenderloin like this again.  It was okay to me, but certainly didn't live up to all these reviews.  I'll just stick to making it on the grill, even though it takes a lot more time!

Disappointing that I didn't get it as tender as the other reviewer's raved about.  It smelled great while it was cooking...but the wine was over powerful for the kids.  I use cab. I probably won't be making this again.

Amazing! Oh my gosh the flavours that come out of the meat as you bite into it are heavenly. The wine flavour is great. We cooked ours on low for 8 hrs and it was amazing. Next time I want to add veggies to it. I just told my husband that this needs to be a weekly meal :)

Out of this world!!! The best pork tenderloin I've made. It was so juicy and tender and the flavor was so very good! The key to this is to make sure the garlic stays on top and that you spoon the juices over the meat when done. I cooked mine on HIGH for a good 5 1/2 hours. Simply Amazing!

I read all the reviews before I made this recipe, and went with some of the other reviewers on the lower sodium soy. I still followed the rest of the recipe pretty much all the way. I put the pork in the crockpot, covered with the soup mix, then poured the liquids around the pork and covered the top of the pork with the garlic. I just eye balled the garlic amount. I made sure to cover the whole top of it with garlic. I let it sit on HIGH for about 5-6 hours, and the meat just fell apart. I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it! Great and easy recipe!

based on other reviews and my own opinion you either love this or not. My family did not. I will never make this again. Did not like the taste at all. Shredded the meat and added bar-b-q sauce and baked in oven for 30 min at 350. This was at least edible. I was very disapointed.

This was good, it definitely wasn't bad.  But it wasn't anything special either.  I feel like I've had some really great pork tenderloin recipes I've tried for the slow cooker and this was just a little too disappointing for me.

I have never made such a tender pork tenderloin! My family loved it! Made a few changes from the original. 1. Seasoned the meat with garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper. 2. Browned meat prior to putting it in the slow cooker. 3. Added lots of garlic. 4. Replaced chicken broth for water.  The only other change I would have made was my selection of wine. I used a Shiraz as that is all I had on hand but next time I would use something a little lighter like a Merlot.  My husband loved the use of Shiraz though.  Overall a great recipe, thanks!

This is probably the best dish I've ever made in the crock pot and I didn't change a thing.  I often read the reviews and think "this recipe has been tweaked so much I'm not really reading a critique of this dish at all."  Served in over rice pilaf, but sure mashed potatoes would be delicious too.

AMAZING!!!!  We loved it, my husband and 7 year old son devoured it!  I did use both tenderloin that came in the package (unsure of the weight related to what the recipe called for) and used red wine vinegar instead of red wine since we were out.  Fabulous!
EDITED - we did NOT use 3 TBS of garlic, I probably used about 4 cloves.  I could see how that would cause some of the more negative reviews.

My husband is a fantastic cook and we were both amazed and delighted by the simple yet powerful taste this recipe delivered.  You must try it, invite your friends.  We cooked it for 9 hours on low and the loin literally fell apart getting it out of the crock pot.  Good balance of salty and savory.  Pairs well our homemade European cheese and herb bread and mashed potatoes!  Enjoy!

Used ribs because the store was out of unflavored tenderloin. Worked fine.

I was having my family over for dinner and worried that my pot roast wouldn't be enough. At the last minute, I rushed to the store and picked up a pork tenderloin. I jumped online to find a good recipe, and this sounded simple enough.  It was SOOO good. I didn't change anything and was able to just leave it to cook in the Crock Pot while I fussed with everything else. I ended up with a little bit of beef leftovers, but the pork was devoured. Everyone loved it. We used the juice as a gravy (I didn't thicken it, but it was very good as it was) I will definitely be making this again.

Pretty good - I cooked almost 4 lbs of pork tenderloin on low though, and it was done is just over 2 hours!  Thankfully the recipe has a lot of liquid, so it didn't dry out while it sat waiting for dinner time.  Nothing spectacular, but very easy and pretty tasty.

This was a wonderful dish.  I will definitely make this again.  It is a little salty, so you won't need to add salt (I enjoyed the flavor, so not a criticism).  Great gravy for potatoes, or I made kasha to go with this.

Absolutely incredible, and possibly even better the next day! I agree with other reviews that poking holes in the tenderloin and studding it with whole garlic cloves is a nice touch. My fiance and I love salt, and this recipe doesn't disappoint, but as he's watching his blood pressure, we take the soy sauce down to 1.5 tbsp and substitute water for the other 1.5 tbsp. Still delicious!!

Didn't work for our family for dinner...however, I have to say...the leftovers (there were tons) made great sandwiches. We won't be making this again especially with a tenderloin which is a little pricey.

I followed the recipe and then inserted slivers of garlic into 'pockets' of the tenderloin and sliced an onion into rings and laid  it across the top. This smelled heavenly and tasted divine. SO EASY and so good! I can't ask for much more... It's been saved for future use! Thanks for the recipe!

I went by some other reviews & substituted 1 T. dried onion flakes for the soup mix, & used low-sodium soy sauce to keep it from getting too salty.  Didn't have red wine so I risked it by using cooking sherry, but only 1/2 cup, then increased water amount to 1 1/4 cups.  It turned out to be spectacular.  The sherry gave it a nice subtle flavor, & it had just the right amount of salt flavoring.  I thickened the gravy from the crockpot by heating a small pan, melting 1-2 T. butter, then whisking in a few tablespoons of flour, & cooking for a minute.  Slowly added some of the gravy from crockpot to the pan until there was enough for the meal & thick enough for gravy consistency.  Cut pork into medallions & placed on rotini pasta. Poured gravy on top. Awesome!

This was excellent, I followed the recipe and added some garlic from the grinder along with minced garlic like it calls for and it was perfect however I cooked it on High for 4 hours.  I hope other get the chance to enjoy it especially because the ingredient list is what most of us have on hand.  Enjoy!!!

I've made this several times as is, and it's become a "go to" recipe.  4 hours on slow is correct! Great served with Garlic Red Potatoes.  Tender and juicy - really really a treat.  I also make this as a freezer meal - put the meat and sauce into a ziplock, freeze, thaw and dump into slow cooker. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

this was pretty good, fork tender but not necessarily moist. i added a splash of worstershire. also chopped the onion soup.  didnt have the issue with burning. used cornstarch to make gravy directly in the crockpot. gravy made this recipe. tasted perfect with carmelized onion and horseradish smashed potatoes, and mushrooms w/ soy sauce glaze (both from this site.)  Everyone enjoyed dinner (all 3 recipes together would surely bump this to a 4 star for sure, but just rating the tenderloin a 3.)  so i would probably make again, but possibly slow roast instead of crockpot.

my $23 organic farm raised pork tenderloin ruined!!! i agree with a previous comment that it tasted like beef. and not a very good beef at that. since i'm a newbie slow cooker user -- and even then i've only used it to make soups -- i followed the recipe as directed except for worchestire sauce instead of soy. and yes, i used good wine and fresh garlic.   what a major disappointment.

The tenderloin turned out beautifully! Very moist and tender. Mine was only about one pound however, so the 4 hour cooking time may need to be adjusted for the larger tenderloin. I didn't have soy sauce on hand, so I substituted Worcesteshire sauce. My husband and parents loved it!

The first time I made this it was sooo salty - so the next time I used a can (14 oz) of low sodium beef broth and one half of an onion chopped instead of the onion soup mix and water.  I left out the wine and added 3 tbs of balsamic vinegar.  I left out 1 tbs of soy sauce and added 1 tbs of worchestershire.  It didn't come out as tender as the first time, but it was still really good.  

1st Review: delicious - almost too tender though.  i left out the wine, added 3 tbsp of balsamic vinegar, and about 1/3 c extra water.   i left out one tbps of soy sauce, and added 1 tbsp of worchestershire.  i tried to turn the sauce into gravy but it was waaay too salty.  i also turned the crockpot up to high about halfway through.

Good but didn't have the deep flavor I hoped for.   May try to marinade overnight next time without water and then cook.

This recipe is fantastic and so simple.  Halfway through cooking I threw in some quartered mushrooms.  I am not a huge fan of pork, but this was definitely the best I have ever had.  I think this would be a great meal for company, and I know everyone would want seconds.

Fantastic recipe!!  I used a tenderloin that was just shy of 2 lbs and 4 hours was a tad too long in my crock-pot but this is still definitely a keeper!  I slit the tenderloin and put sliced garlic in the slices.  I foloowed all of the measurements to the tee and then added 3 tablespoons of Lea and Perrins Worchershire sauce as well.  I let it marinade in the refrigerator for about 3 hours before cooking in the crock pot.  In the last hour I added a whole chopped up onion (which was perfect, the onion was still crunchy but fully cooked at the end of the cook time).  I, too, thickened the sauce up with corn starch and served as a gravy.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and fresh greens beans and cornbread.  It was excellent - my guests ate every bit of it and went back for more!!

Made this for the first time, so yummy and tender. I doubled the recipe exactly as directed and it came out perfect. Even my picky 5 year old ate it and my 7 year old told me to put it on the list. Even being doubled, we barely had enough for leftovers. Having the right red wine is key, I had a cabernet sauvignon that had been sitting around a while in the kitchen (I leave the remainders of any opened bottles to use as  cooking wine, the longer it sits, the better it is for cooking.) Don't use a newly opened bottle, it needs to breath a lot before cooking with it. The sauce/gravy was perfect as well. Can't wait to make this again!

Very moist & very tasty.  I did add a few additional spices, like garlic.  Of course not a meal without garlic

This was OK. To be fair, I'm giving 3 *, b/c honestly, I just don't think it deserves more than that (sorry!). My favorite tenderloin recipe on this site is Burgundy Pork Tenderloin (BROWNDOG). Yes, it requires more effort (slow cooking is the EASIEST way to prep. food - period!), but the end result is SOOOO worth it (IMHO). This had a very "odd" taste. I can't put my finger on it exactly tho... it could be the saltiness or maybe it's the combo. of soy/wine (???). My fiance liked this, but he too agrees that burgundy tenderloin is MUCH better. For those of you wanting to try this, I will say that the submitter's direct. are right on. Four hrs. on low is perfect. My 1 lb. tenderloin (all I could find were pkg. of 2, ea. 1 lb.) was fork tender (no knife needed). Other than using a sm. cut of meat, my only other ch. were rubbing a sm. amt. of herbs de Provence on both sides of my tenderloin & inserting several garlic slivers thruout, but I don't think either add. to the end prod. Even tho I "tech." 1/2'd this recipe, I did make the full amt. of gravy called for. I could not justify using 1/2 of an $$$ Lipton onion soup pk.! To make my gravy, I dumped all of the liquid from my sc into a sm. pot, add. 1 T cornstarch dissolved in 1 T H2O & brought to a boil to thicken. Served w/ mashed pottoes, green beans & Parm. knots (Cathy Adams), this was a nice meal on this cold, dreary fall day. Tx. for sharing, chowsito :)

This was fantastic. I did make a couple changes; not using wine, but substituting it with water instead and adding in a TBS of worchestershire (sp?) sauce. I also added in some quartered redskin potatoes and carrots. After it was done cooking I removed the extra liquid and added a few TBS of cornstarch and water to thicken the gravy and YUM it was really fab. The meat was so tender and delicious, I'd for sure make it again.

This was yummy!  I would recommend perhaps cutting the amount of onion soup mix.  The taste of onion was almost overpowering and it made the whole house smell like onions.  My husband isn't a big onion person but I figured it would be ok since it's just the soup mix, not raw onions.  Boy was I wrong.  He said all he could taste was onion flavor.  BUT I liked it so that's why I gave it 4 stars.  It's a good dish, just not for anyone who remotely dislikes onion.

Yum! This was so good. Kinda salty next time I think I'm only going to use 1 tbsp soy sauce. i left out the wine too because I just didn't have any and didn't feel like running to the store. I added the corn startch to the juice. i served it over steamed rice and summer veggies on the side.

This recipe is awesome.  It was too late to use the slow cooker so I put all of the ingredients into a roasting pan and into a 425 oven uncovered.  I took it out when the meat reached 160 and it was unbelievably good.  My Husband is a fussy eater but he loved this recipe.  I will be using it often.

Love my slow cooker! This recipe was true to it's name...amazing! The pork was so flavorful and tender. The garlic was a bit much for my husband and kids (they scraped it off), but I loved it (might spread it on only half of the pork next time). The au jus was delicious as well. I strained it to make it a little more smooth and the flavor was awesome. Excellent recipe!

I made this as directed, except to reduce the soy sauce (because I didn't have low sodium kind) and probably added a little more garlic ... but otherwise as directed.  It was fabulous!  Wouldn't change a thing.  Put in a frozen tenderloin straight from the deep freeze in the morning, mixed all of the flavors, poured on top, set it to low, and when I got home 8.5 hrs later, it was pull-apart tender.  I added corn starch to thicken, then pulled it all apart with a large spoon, and mixed it all up with the sauce.  Delish!!  Doesn't make a pretty picture that way, but sure is good.

I used Lipton beefy onion mix b/c it is what I had on hand.   Also, I thickened up the sauce on the stove with cornstarch and tossed it back in the crock pot.  It was fabulous !!

Seriously, this is the best pork tenderloin I've ever eaten.  It was so juicy and tender.  The flavor was excellent.  I did follow the advice of some others and stuck whole garlic cloves into the tenderloin.  Yum!!

This pork was very good. Moist, tangy and very easy to make. I did not have a pork loin so I substituted with a pork roast that I had. It still turned out well. I also didn't have any red wine, but I had red cooking wine and added a bit of sherry to it. My family loved it.

This recipe was no doubt, very good. My mother made it and I tried to recreate it. The problem was that I had 2.7 pounds rather than 2 and they were in two separate pieces of meat. I jacked up the amount of all the ingredients to account for the extra poundage. The problem is that I did not take into account that fact that they were two small pieces. It turned a bit too salty as well as a bit too garlicy(I followed the advice of putting slivers of garlic into the meat). It was definitely not too bland. I would recommend following the recipe exactly or  perhaps putting in a little less than the recipe calls for. Just be careful if you are sensitive to salt or garlic. Good recipe overall. The family liked it but also complained of an excess salt/garlic taste.

Bravo! This is a real keeper. I followed the recipe to a T except for using all chicken broth instead of water . I also thickend the jus with corn starch mixed in water for about 10 minutes after removing the pork! It was GREAT! After tasting the gravy, I added no salt to the mashed potatoes I served with it. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Though the overall flavor was fine, the sodium in this recipe was a tad bit overwhelming (even using low sodium soy sauce).  We usually don't add a lot of salt to our food, so we may be more sensitive to it.

I will try it again using a little less soy sauce and only 1/2 to 3/4 of the onion soup mix. Hopefully that will cut down the saltiness.  
The meat was perfect, though!

This is an excellent slow-cooker recipe!  I have made it several times and each time it comes out so tender and delicious.  I have used many different kind of wines but usually use Riunite Lambrusco since I usually have some on hand.  Perfect for a cold night with mashed potatoes and veggies and the leftovers are just as good the next day.

I followed the original recipe except used half tablespoon less of the low sodium salt and it was still so salty. I will try the other recommendations listed next time.

I went by the recipe with only a few small changes.  I also did the slits in the tenderloin and pushed garlic inside and I added a whole sliced onion.  Very, very good recipe and very flavorful.  My husband and my kids loved it.  Will definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious!!  The only changes I made was to add an extra cup of water (since I used 4 pounds of meat), used only 1 tbl of soy sauce and added 2 tbl of Worcestershire sauce, layered big chunks of onion on the bottom of the pot, and added a package of whole fresh mushrooms to the top.  Yummy marinade!!  Good with mashed potatoes.

I seared the meat in a skillet first, after seasoning with salt & pepper. Then I followed the recipe exactly. The meat was very tender and delicious. 4 hours on low was perfect, but I had two small tenderloins instead of one large one. Very good recipe.

This was great!  I followed the recipe exactly and the meat was flavorful, moist, and delicious.  The leftovers were served up the next day on hoagies butter toasted under the broiler with the aus ju on the side.  Wonderful!

Sorry, didn't like this one.  I think we've decided we're just not huge pork loin roast fans.  I sprinkled the meat with garlic and pepper, then browned it before placing in the crockpot.  Too garlicky for us, although it smelled good cooking.

We loved this!  I cut the wine back to 1/2 cup because I'm not a big red wine fan.  And, after reading other reviews, I cut the soy sauce back by 1/2 and added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.  I left it in the crock pot all day while I worked, and it was perfect when we came home.  The meat was very tender and moist.  I served the liquid on the side for dipping, and it was delicious.  I think it might have been too salty for us if I had used the full amount of soy sauce. I'm usually disappointed with most crock pot recipes, but this one is a keeper and so easy.

Absolutely fantastic.  DH doesn't usually like meat cooked in the crockpot because, he says, it comes out bland, but not in this case! I substituted beef broth for water, which just seemed right with the red wine. Also, I cut the soy sauce in half and added the same amount of Worcestershire sauce. I also cut garlic cloves into the port and rubbed the outside with sofrito and Goya Sazon. I used a Cabernet Sauvingon on a previous reviewer's suggestion. I'm not a red wine person, but this dish was fantastic! Will make over and over again.

I was doubtful about this, but after cooking for 4 or 5 hours, the juices turn into the base for an amazing gravy.  Mix cornstarch and water and add.  I served it with mashed potatoes and everyone loved it.

It took a little less than 4 hours to cook the pork in the slow cooker. The flavor was delicious, if not a little overdone. Thx!

I've made this 2 times already and my husband and 4 children love it.  I slice it and put it back in the juices at least 30 minutes before serving.  Also, if you let it cook 4 1/2 to 5 hours, it's even more tender.:)

After reading the reviews, I had high hopes for this one but was thoroughly disappointed.  Followed the recipe but cut back on soy sauce as other reviewers recommended.  Used Merlot wine - maybe that was the problem.  Wine flavor was overwhelming.  I'm going to try to salvage by making pulled pork and smoothering w/ BBQ sauce.  I don't think this recipe needs a tenderloin.  If you like the ingredients, seems that a loin roast or less expensive cut would be just fine.  Won't be making this again at my house.

Easy & delicious!   Even our 4-yr-old liked it.  I used two small pork loins (about 1 lb each) and browned them before adding them to the crock pot.  I used "Golden Onion Soup Mix" and added 2 tsp crushed dried rosemary and 1 large bay leaf to the crock pot during cooking.  I cooked the meat until it was falling apart tender (about 6 hours on med-low).  The pork was very tender and the sauce was a nice compliment to the meat and garlic mashed potatoes.  The sauce was a bit thin and probably would benefit from thickening as some others have recommended.

I don't understand how this is not a five star recipe for everyone.  So tender and moist, very easy and full of flavor. The juice is excellent and works great poured over some Uncle Ben's wild rice. I did not use as much garlic - I just put 2 tsp of the minced garlic from the jar on top and I think I will do that next time, too.  Can't wait to make again!

This was very good and really easy.  I did find a little salty though.  Will use low sodium soup mix / soy sauce next time.  It's a keeper.  Will be trying with a chuck roast!

Ugh. I don't like to give bad reviews & usually don't, but man oh man, I just had to say aomething about this pork. The meat itself turned out fall-apart tender, but c'mon... it's a tenderloin. The sauce however is another matter entirely. As a person who LOVES salt, salt, and more salt, I couldn't believe it when this sauce turned out to be so salty that I could hardly stand it. I think an entire package of onion soup mix is just way too much. If I ever attempted this dish again, I'd follow someone else's suggestion & replace the soup mix with fresh sliced onion. The salt could be had from the soy sauce or by using broth instead of water. I did only use half of the soy sauce along with 1 and a half TBSP of worchestershire, and I think that would've been good if it hadn't been so overpowered by the soup's salt.
I served this pork over white rice, but could only stand to use a little bit of the gravy. My husband and son skipped the gravy all together. Pity, because it was so darn pretty.

This was just plain bad! After reading reviews, I cut the soy sauce to 1 TBSP. I used a Spanish red wine. My husband says I'm a salt-a-holic, so I do like salty food, but I had to throw this out...I tried putting a can of cream of mush soup, more water, etc. but could not stomach it. Yuck. Sorry.

The juice (sauce) had a good flavor, but my husband and I thought the dehydrated onions overpowered the recipe.  I may try using an herb soup mix next time.

I agree that this was definitely not amazing.  I made it with a Trader Joe’s pork tenderloin and a medium-quality zinfandel.  Per other reviewers suggestions, I reduced the amount of soy sauce by about half.  The result tasted heavily of pork and wine.  Couldn’t detect much garlic, soy, or onion flavor at all.  Even with a better wine and a high-quality tenderloin, it would be, at best, nothing special.  Since I can think of much better things to do with a good cut of pork and a nice wine, I won’t make this again.

This was an excellent recipe.  I cooked it 2 hours on low and then 2 hours on high, and it was so tender. I also took the advice of another, and did 1 Tbsp Soy and 1 Tbsp Worchister Sauce.  I used Burgundy Wine in mine since that's what I had on hand(also one of the cheapest) and it turned out great.  This is a keeper in my recipe box.  Thanks!

This is my favorite receipe.  The pork was tender and the sauce was scrumptious.  I probably will use the low sodium soy sauce next time and thicken the sauce to see which way I like it better although it was just about perfect following the original receipe.  However, there is not enough meat for 6 servings.  I would make 2-2lb tenderloins for 6 servings.

Excellent recipe, the only changes I made the second time around was to use less of the onion soup mix and switched to light soy sauce. Also, I used a Merlot wine which made a fantastic gravy. I served it with roasted potatoes and butternut squash. Toooooo Goooood!

This was a good easy recipe. I took the advice others and cut the soy sauce back and only used 1/2 cup wine and increased the water by 1/4 cup. I had to let mine simmer for 8 hours, but it turned out fine. Nice and moist. Good flavor. I served the Au jus with potatoes. I also took the suggestion to use leftovers for BBQ pulled pork sandwiches - good! I'll probably make it again if pork tenderloin is on sale.

This was good - not amazing for us, but good! I subbed low sodium beef broth for the wine, used 1.5 T soy sauce, 1.5 T worchestshire and it was not too salty. Thickened the juices and served over egg noodles. Five hours on low worked for our two pound tenderloin. Will make again.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 because my husband and I thought it was a little bland for our taste.  However, we had leftovers the next night and it was much more flavorful the second day!  Next time I think I'll prepare it ahead of time and let it marinate in the fridge before I cook it.  My 2 and 4 year old even liked it!

Delicious. We used 1 C wine and 3/4 C water and cooked it for about 6 hours. We also chose to take some of the juices and thicken with flour to make gravy. The meat was so tender and flavorful. Will definitely make again.

The next time I make this I will use beef broth instead of red wine.  The red wine adds a tang that doesn't really compliment the meat.  I used a CA Cab. Sav. - so maybe a Pinot or less bold red would have been okay.

I used 1/2 pack onion soup mix and cooked it on low for 6-8 hrs.

I agree that the wine is overpowering and takes away from the potential here. Pork is tender, but has no flavor. I think maybe add some worcestershire and 1/2 broth, 1/2 wine. Not big on the onion soup and wine combo, it was just okay.

I read all the reviews before making this and I was anxious about how it was going to turn out. After all the reviewers who said it was too salty, I increased the wine to 1 cup and the water to 1 1/2 cups. I also put a couple pieces of raw potato in the liquid to soak up the salt. I agree with the other reviewers who said the meat was very tender, but a little dry. Overall, it was a good dish, easy to prepare but I don't think I will make it again.

The title is perfect for this pork...amazing!!!  It smelled great and my husband gave it great reviews (and he is picky).  My pork weighed 3.75 lbs and I added 1 envelope lipton onion soup mix, 1 & 2/3 c. water, and I mixed 3/4 c. red wine vinegar with 3/4 c. white wine (did not have red wine), about 4 med. size cloves of garlic minced, & 1/4 c. (low sodium) soy sauce.  I cooked it for about 5 1/2 hours.  It was tender and melted in your mouth.  I AM NOT a person who is a salt fan and I thought that this was perfect (contrary to other reviews).  Don't be afraid to try this recipe, it is great!!

I was looking for a quick to prepare pork tenderloin recipe and chose this one. Even though I used a rather large piece of meat, there were no leftovers. My family doesn't want to eat pork tenderloin any other way from now on. I left it in the slow cooker cooker for longer than four hours but that just makes it even more tender. Excellent recipe.

For my 1st time cooking pork tenderloin, I think it was quite good.  I took the suggestion of other reviews to use only 1/2 the onion soup mix and used low sodium soy sauce.  With 2.4 lbs of tenderloin, it was still plenty salty to me, and I love salt.  I did not have any red wine, but I mixed red wine vinegar and water together and it worked well.  Thanks, LLUA, for sharing this easy recipe.  It made a lovely main dish for Easter.  This is excellent with the Strawberry Spinach Salad that is also on this website!

I used low sodium soy sauce.  The ingredients (except pork) can be premixed and frozen (in ziploc bag) and pork can be frozen (in separate bag).  Put the pork in cooker first and then the sauce, cook on low for 6 to 8 hours.  We loved it, very good flavor and very tender!

i followed this recipe to a T...and it came out as one sloppy mess..i read the reviews, good and bad, and took them with a grain of salt and didn't deviate from the recipe but this was terrible..i followed many recipes from this site as well as others and none of them  came out as bad as this...but if you are going to go through with it, use beef broth instead of wine and worcestershire sauce instead of soy...it was too salty and the wine did not mix well with this recipe.

This was very good. I did follow some of the reviewers' tips and used what I had on hand. There's nothing wrong with cooking a pork tenderloin in a slow cooker. I wouldn't do it with a beef tenderloin but that's another story. I browned the loin first with some olive oil, salt and pepper. I also used a fresh onion, sliced. I had some French onion soup in a carton, so used that instead of the water and soup mix. I added rosemary, thyme, sage, cumin, and Worstershire sauce. I think the extra herbs helped. Four hours on low was probably enough but I let it go longer until we were ready to eat. I strained the juices and added cornstarch to make a gravy. It turned out great! And we have leftovers for open-faced hot pork-and-gravy sandwiches. Loved it!

Pork was very tender, but the flavor was a bit off tasting a little bitter. It was ok, but not something I would make again.

Will not make again!  Sauce is too oriental but not in a good way and did not like flavor at all.  Pork tenderloin did not come out as tender as expected either.

Dang! This was delicious. I used the written recipe as a guide and the previous reviews for inspiration. I started with a 4 pound pork roast (and I'm a single lady!) so I doubled all other ingredients. I substituted the water for beef broth and added one sliced onion, half of a minced ghost pepper, fresh thyme and fresh italian oregano. I made it nice and garlicky by shoving whole cloves in slices on the top of the meat. I left it in the crock pot on low for 8 hours and turned it up to high for the last 30 min. The meat fell apart beautifully. With the juices, I made an easy gravy using a heavy pour of whole milk, a heaping tablespoon of flour and nothing else. So freaking good. Seriously. Try it!

I liked the idea of slow cooking with nice seasonings listed.  However it was unpleasant.  Bland color and au jus was bland.

Wow, this is so good and so easy.  Didn't change anything except cooked it on high for about 3 hours. I bet on low for 5-6 hours would be even better.  The gravy it makes is awesome!

This was easy to make and very flavorful! I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was done after 4 hours on low. I cooked it an additional hour because my hubby wasn't home yet. After reading the reviews, I did decide to pull out the pork and add corn starch to the liquid, turned the slow cooker up to high for a few minutes, then added the sliced pork back and turned it to warm until my mashed potatoes were done. I think by making the gravy is what made it so delicious. This recipe is a keeper!!!

I had a 4lb pork tenderloin and needed a quick slow cooker recipe I could leave all day while I worked.  This turned out delicious!  The only difference was that I had no Lipton onion soup , so I used dried onions, onion powder, celery salt, parsley, black pepper and a 14oz can of beef broth.  Followed the recipe exactly for the rest.  Cooked on high in my crockpot for 5 hours.  Turned out tender and juicy and the broth was rich and delicious, not too salty.  I will definitely do this again.  So easy and wonderful!

OH MY...This is locked into my recipe box! I made exactly as directed using a cabernet. I was skeptical it would be done on low in four hours, but it was perfect! I sliced it up and put it back in the red wine gravy it creates and it was fabulous! My husband loved it and when I ran a sample over to might neighbor she immediately wanted the recipe. This is a WINNER! I will be making the next time my kids come into town.

I used two large bone-in pork chops and cooked them on high for about 2.5 hours and low for about 2 hours after that.  Incredibly tender, fell off the bone.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Used lots of au jus for the pork and the potatoes and served more to each person on the side.  Best pork chop I have ever had!

This was certainly easy, and it turned out very tender. However, it was quite salty.  The next time I make this, I will likely use low sodium soy sauce and see if that makes a difference.

Very disappointed.  I followed this recipe exactly.  It was salty and very dry. Had to add a little more water because of the high sodium content midway through cooking. Could not chew it. I think pork tenderloin is not made to cook for so long because of the low fat content.  I think pork shoulder would have worked better and less of the onion soup mix. It worked out for some but not for me.

Loved It!  Put the dry rub (onion soup) and mixed all wet ingredients the night before so the next day only had to add wet ingredients, garlic and turn on.  Yummy

This was my first time cooking pork tenderloin and went looking for a slow cooker recipe.  I was skeptical with the ingredients but followed the recipe exactly and after reading the reviews cooked about 1 and 1/2 hours longer on low.  I used sodium reduced soy sauce and Merlot.  I added flour and water to the cooking liquid and made a delicious gravy.  Thank you chowsito, I'll definitely make this again.

Way too salty!!! We used regular wine, not cooking wine too. I would use way less soy sauce next time, or something else entirely.

I LOVE this recipe! I usually make it just as it is posted....if I have red wine I add it, if not, I don't. Either way this is fantastic! If you love slow cooker cooking then you have to try this recipe!

Fantastic recipe!!!  I cooked it longer so it completely fell apart. I cut into the tenderloin so the sauce would seep in as well. 
Wonderful with mashed potatoes!!!!

Wonderful- also works well with 6 thick smoked pork chops. Strain the drippings, add cornstarch and water, bring to a boil for an awesome gravy!

I tried this recipe today and the pork tenderloin was good but the gravy (I added flour to the juice) was way too salty! It ruined my dinner. Mashed potatoes are no good without gravy in our house. If I ever make this again I would use only 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of soy sauce! No more!

Excellent excellent. After cooking, i take roast out and let it sit for 15 mins. I put the au jus in a pot and whisk in 3 tbls of flour to turn it into a gravy that i put over mashed red potatoes. My 5 yr old is the pickiest eater ever and loves this!

After all the talk about using a cheaper cut of meat than a tenderloin, I bought a 2# boneless Boston butt for this recipe, but had to trim alot of fat from it.  I used the low sodium homemade "Dry Onion Soup Mix" from this site, low sodium soy sauce and Merlot. I used the cup of water this time, but I don't think it needs that much liquid.  I'll try it with little or no water next time.  I cooked it on Low for 4 hours and it was exactly 145 degrees, perfect!  I thickened the juice with cornstarch and a little water to make gravy for the meat.  My SO is sick and really didn't like all the garlic but I loved it and didn't really detect a strong garlic taste.  Great recipe, thanks, chowsito, for submitting.  UPDATE:  I  used this recipe again to make a Smithfield fresh pork loin filet which is about the size of a tenderloin and almost as tender.   This time I went strictly by recipe. The sauce was great though quite salty and made a wonderful gravy but 4 hours on Low in the slow cooker is way too long.  Meat dried out as I'm sure a tenderloin would too.  Using tenderloin should only take 1 1/2 to 2 hours to be done at about 145°.

Oh my gosh! Ultimate comfort food!
This was insanely good. I'm not sure why it only has 4 stars. I cooked it on high for exactly 4 hours, and it was just starting to fall apart. I would not advise going any longer or you might end up with shredded pork.  I served with brown rice generously topped with the au jus and lima beans on the side. This recipe will go straight to the favorites folder.

This was the perfect recipe for a beginner. Personally I'd recommend less garlic, partly because clean up was difficult and 3 tablespoons is a lot. But over all, we loved it!!

I used pork chops instead of pork loin because it was much cheaper.. My boyfriend and I both loved it! Easy to fix it and forget it. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was a hit with my family.  Recipe is perfect as is.  I added a little cornstarch at the end of the cooking time, just to thicken the gravy.  Everyone raved over the flavor.   Definitely a keeper!!

I used a 2 lb pork loin, seared first, and cooked on low for 7 hours.  I also only used 1 tsp. of soy sauce because the first time I made it it was too salty.

Have this in the crock pot right now, but just sampled a taste and oh.my.word. it is deelish. Such a simple recipe. I did read several reviews prior to making it hoping for an onion soup packet substitute simply because I didn't have any on hand and didn't feel like going out to the store. Having found the review, I used a large fresh onion, cut slits into the pork and inserted cloves of garlic - because you can NEVER have too much garlic, added thyme, rosemary, celery seeds, and instead of wine I used a cup of chicken broth. The pork is tender and full of flavor. I am looking forward to eating shortly and will be making a gravy with the liquid to go with mashed potatoes. Thanks so much!!!

I thought this was a great recipe and unbelievably easy.  I did not have dry onion soup so I took another reviewer's advice and substituted the cup of water with a cup of beef broth and added a tablespoon of dry minced onion.  I agree with someone else that this recipe may be very high in sodium so I did use low sodium beef broth and I always use low sodium soy sauce.  I cooked this for about 5 1/2 hours on low though I do believe it was done sooner.  Either way, it was very tender - whole family really enjoyed it.

I made this exactly as directed. It was very moist and tasty. The only thing I would change is the amount of soy sauce. I thought it was overpowering in taste, so I would decrease the amount next time. Otherwise, we all enjoyed this roast very much.

I was a little hesitant to make this (only due to a few reviews) however I decided to make this on a cold autumn day and it was DELICIOUS! it literally melted in my mouth - sooo good! I added a bit of cornstarch and water to the gravy and it was a hit!

This was fanfreakintastic! I know most people don't like adjustments, and I am not here to do that. I didn't have the wine or soy sauce as was called for. I substituted the wine with a 3/4 cup of water and a cube of beef bullion. Everything was to the letter except that I used a pepper medley rather than opting for the black pepper. Came out tender and smelled heavenly. I took the sauce and made a gravy with it as well. I had more water I believe than another post so I had to add 4 tbsp of cornstarch to the juice to get it to turn into gravy. We almost gobbled up the entire dinner. There are very few left overs. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic! I even threw in some cut up red potatoes the last 45 mins of cooking time to make it more hearty (hubby has a big appetite for such a slim guy!) it was fantastic!

This is the easiest tenderloin recipe I have ever tried. My husband asks for it at least once a week and he is not a fan of the slow cooker. Don''t change a thing!  Chirrio

Wow, what a recipe!  This is the best pork tenderloin recipe I've ever tried.  My son, who normally doesn't eat anything from the slow cooker, devoured it. I did what some other reviewers did and made a gravy with the juice and some cornstarch and water.  I made some mashed potatoes and beer bread to go along with it.  I will be making this often! If I could give it 6 stars, I would.  You have got to try this recipe, if you haven't yet.  Glad I found this!

This one is a keeper.  The pork came out so tender, and my daughter who doesn't normally eat pork, liked it!  I added a package of quartered mushrooms & a few squirts of worcestershire the sauce.  At the very end, separately thickened the sauce with some cornstarch/cold water mixture.  I used a cabernet sauvignon...Delicious!

I don't like to rate a recipe that I have altered- but I got home and had everything started and discovered I had no soy sauce.  Soooo, I added about 1-2 tbsp of dijon- and a few sprinkles of worcestershire sauce.  The pork was tender and the sauce amazing.  We loved it!

It tasted like overcooked pork.  It does fall apart, as said in other reviews, so if you're just looking for a really tender piece of meat that doesn't require much chewing, this is the dinner for you.  

I will use the leftovers (there were a lot since no one liked it) to make BBQ pulled pork sandwiches tomorrow.

Very good, but the onion soup mix makes it very salty. I'll try an alternative next time. The marriage of merlot, onion and soy sauce, though, was great! And the pork fell apart as I cut it.

Every one loved this.  I felt the au jus needed lightned up a bit but you will just have to taste it yourself to make that decision. We dipped Kings Hawaiian bread in the au jus and it was delicious.  I am getting ready to make it again.  The best thing I can recommend for you to do with this recipe is to double it because you everyone will want to have left overs

Absolute best pork tenderloin that I've ever made!!  My 3 boys loved it.  I did not use the wine, adding bouillon and water instead.  Didn't have garlic either, but garlic powder worked just fine.  The gravy was delish!!!!  With homemade rolls and mashed potatoes and garden peas, this was a wonderful family meal!

A bit dry - definitely need to serve with the au jus.  So easy to prepare that I set out the ingredients and had my husband (who rarely cooks) get it going in the slow cooker himself.

I just made this today and it is SO wonderful. I stuck exactly to the recipe but used a pork loin roast,(only because I had one in the freezer)the meat melts in your mouth and what a beautiful flavor..I think this will be great with pork chops or any pork. I used Merlot wine..FANTASTIC!

Gotta say this was a simple and delicious way to make pork. I didn't have a full bag of onion mix but I improvised and added what i had and half sliced onion, some onion powder and kept everything else as recipe states and it turned out fantastic.  Even my picky 6 year old had seconds. The au jus makes even tastier and juicier. Thank you for the recipe is a keeper. Will be making again for Xmas dinner.

Comments like, "Wow," "This is great," and "Awesome," make this the best recipe for Pork Tenderloin I have used in a very long time.

Recommend a few variations that I used  to enhance this dish a bit.  Use a full cup of dry, rather than a fruity red wine, like a Merlot or Burgundy, which will add a very likeable and distinct essence to the pork.  I like garlic, so I added 4 tablespoons vice 3 of this essential, which when summed with the Onion Soup Mix, Soy Sauce and wine infuses the pork, with what you'll agree is "Nirvana."  Be sure and generously spoon the hot Nirvana Au Jus over the sliced pork when serving.

Oh my - this is delish! I had to leave it in for 5 hours because I was away from home. The loin was melt in your mouth! I did cut slits and slide slices of garlic in instead of laying on top. After removing the meat from the pot I added a couple tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce for gravy - my 8yo ate the potatoes with this gravy first! It really is a keeper! Froze the leftovers for reheating later.

Made this last night, and as with all first time recipes I followed the recipe to the letter. WAY too much garlic! Did I misread the ingredient list? 3 tablespoons really overpowered it. Should that be 3 teaspoons? The pork turned out very tender, so I rinsed what I could of the seasonings off and made some packaged pork gravy to go with it.

I followed this recipe exactly and found it to be a horrible waste of a good pork tenderloin. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because my husband did eat it, but he asked me not to make it again.  The taste was overall terrible, and it was incredibly salty (and I love salt).  I love pork tenderloin, and this was a terrible waste!

Used 5 lbs tenderloin with 1.5 times sauce recipe and cooked on high 4 hours.  Next time, consider pork roast.

The ingredients in this recipe were great and the roast turned out very tasty.  My only complaint is that it needs to cook on HIGH for 4 hours, not LOW.  Luckily I read the reviews before I started so it helped me get my dinner done on time.  I also used a meat thermometer just to double check myself.  Ingredient wise, I added a can of mushrooms.  I have some left over so I was thinking about using the broth to make a gravy for mashed potatoes for tonight.

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers, this wasn't a good use of a tenderloin.  Unfortunately, it came out a bit stringy.  The onion soup mix gave it a strong flavor that masked the taste of the pork.  I will try the recipe again, but next time will use a larger, different cut of pork and play some with the spices.

TENDER, Tender. Hands down.cooked on high for 4 hrs. With some quartered baby red potatoes. Did omit the soy sauce, because of the salt. I don't think that really makes a difference. Had Merlot on hand. Next time for our preference, may quarter some sweet onions and add some mushrooms and some thyme for the extra flavor. Thank You for sharing the recipe.

I tried it, and it came out sooo dry..cooked 4hrs...the only 4 hrs on my slo cooker is on the high setting, but I did check it about once an hour, and it just never softened. No problem with the flavor, used low sodium soy sauce. I think I would use my electic pressure cooker next time...best chopped and covered with the gravy.

Wow! This was so...Good! I change it up a little, because I was afraid it was going to be too salty as written. I used a 2 pound lean pork roast. I cut slits in the roast & add slices of garlic. Than seasoned the roast with 1/2 teaspoon of Thyme, 1/4 onions powder, & black pepper. I seared the meat in a pan first & cooked some fresh onions also. Than add to the slow cooker 2 Tablespoons of the dry onion soup mix, 1 cup of beef broth,a red sweet wine ( that's what I had on hand) & low sodium soy sauce. One hour before serving I add 2 TSP. of flour & 1/4 cup of water to thicken the sauce. Serve with brown rice. My husband couldn't stop talking about how much he loved this dish!

After reading a lot of the reviews I decided to make this on Friday when company was coming over.  I usually have a rule against making new recipes when people are coming over, but the reviews were so good I thought I'd be safe.
The first thing I did differently was that I used a pork loin instead of a tenderloin. I couldn't make myself put a tenderloin in the slowcooker.  My loin was about 4.5 lbs so I put it in on low for about 5 hours. I also only put in 2 tablespoons of (reduced sodium) soy sauce, I only used 1/2 a cup of red wine (not cooking wine for fear that it would be too salty, I chose a cabernet sauvignon), I used reduced sodium beef broth instead of water.  I also added bay leaves and about a table spoon of worchestershire sauce. I took it out after about 5 hours on low, put the slow cooker on high, mixed a bit of flour and water together and added it to the sauce and stirred until there were no lumps.  The sauce thickened perfectly!  The pork was so tender it fell apart when I was taking it out, and then was almost impossible to cut properly.  My guests LOVED this!  I made it with rice and corn.  So delicious!  I am definitely going to make this again!!
Thanks for the recipe!

First off let me say I'm not a cook, but I can follow a receipe.   I followed this one to the letter.   I didn't alter one thing.   That said this turned out incredible.   The taste is out of this world.   I wanted to just let it sit in my mouth to savor it.   I didn't use expensive wine either.   I've made it twice and both times it was a hit.  I didn't even mention how ridiculously easy it was either.

Followed these directions to a T, doubling for a 4+ lb tenderloin. We like our pork cooked through so I cooked it in my Crock-Pot for 4 Hrs on High after reading other reviews.  It was tender, juicy, and full of wonderful flavors! Highly recommended!!

Made this recipe for New Year's Eve.  I worked that day, so had the dude put it together.  The night before I made the sauce, including the garlic, and placed it in a jar in the fridge.  I used a 6qt crockpot.  It has a thermometer, so we set the goal temp at 140 F and placed the crockpot on low.  We allowed 6 hours, since other reviewers had said it took longer.  The tenderloin had reached 140 F in about 2.5 hours, it sat on low until I got home.   Was very tender and moist.  The au jus was not too salty, maybe because I used Bragg's amino acids instead soy sauce.  I like 
 Gravy, so I thickened it up before serving.  I am saving the remaining juice/au jus to use in a future stew.

Wonderful!  I took some suggestions and omitted the onion soup mix.  Added 1/3 onion cut in rings, 3T beef stock, 1/2t rosemary, 1/4t thyme, 1/4t garlic powder.  Inserted 4 slivers of fresh garlic into the meat.  I had a 2.12lb roast and cooked it for 5 hours on low, and kept it warm on warm for 1 hour.  Perfect!

I followed the recipe exactly as stated, and the meat was so tender and delicious!  Everyone loved it, and wanted the recipe.  I used a cab. sauv. for the wine, but really I think anything would go.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Thought this was delicious.  I didn't have onion soup mix on hand so I cut onions into rings added some onion powder and used the majority of a garlic clove and placed those on top of the tenderloin during the cooking process.  After 4 hours of cooking, I strained the cooking juices to take out the onions and added a packet of brown gravy mix, more red wine, more soy sauce and a couple of beef boullion cubes to make a robust gravy.  So yummy!

5 star meal, 4 star recipe. No complaint, just needed changing for our taste. Thought this turned out wonderfully - with just one small change... Way too much garlic for our taste... We drastically reduced the amount of minced garlic. We use the minced garlic from the jar, and it was incredibly overpowering after about an hour in the slow cooker. I had to remove about half from the tenderloin itself. With that change, we all loved it!! Very tender and juicy! Great flavor!

I've made this a couple of times now, and it's a very delicious recipe. It makes the house smell wonderful! The only change I've ever felt I needed to make was to remove the meat after cooking and let it rest under tin foil, then poor the left over juice from the slow cooker into a pot on the stove and boil it for about 10 minutes, stirring constantly. I'll add a little bit of corn starch to thicken it up and serve it over mashed potatoes and the sliced up tenderloin. So good!

I decreased the onion soup mix to 2/3 packet and soy sauce to 1.5tps and found it to be a little salty for my taste.  Hubby said it had good flavor but I sadly don't think it will be a staple in our home….

Simple, yes. But the flavors were a muddled mess. We ate it, but my husband asked me not to make it again. The pork was dry, the garlic got lost in the wine, it didn't even taste much like onion soup. There are much better, just as easy, things to do with pork tenderloin. Sorry for the bad review, but this recipe just didn't work for us.

I don't get what the fuss is about this one ... it was OK, but nothing to rave about!   I followed the recipe exactly.   It was a solid weeknight meal, and easy to make.    Nothing I'd serve for company, though.

I too was surprised that this was cooked in 4 hours on low.  The texture was wonderful and it was very flavorful.  Next time I will do everything I can to reduce the saltiness.  Waaaay to salty for our family's taste.

I did not find the flavor that good. I think it was the Lipton Soup mix that turned me off (have never used/tasted it before). But what I found wonderful was having it as leftovers. Not sure why but after being in the fridge overnight and re-heating it I liked it more.

had it for Sunday dinner & it was fabulous !  Everyone loved it & there were hardly any left overs.  I used 2 pork tenderloin roasts ( about 5 pounds total) and I substituted apple-kiwi-strawberry juice for the red wine cause i didn't have any wine.  I also cooked it on HIGH for 4 hrs.   Everything else was the same.

Followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the soy sauce by half, as I don't like salt in general. Also reduced the red wine to two glugs because my boyiend doesn't like wine based recipes. I also added carrots, ushrooms, sliced onion, and red peppers just to give the au jus a bit more flavor. Now, I left it in the slow cooker overnight (oops) thinking I'd turned it to keep warm but having really set it to low; 10 hours later and the veggies are obviously very soggy, but the pork could be cut with a spoon. Great recipe! You wouldn't know it was a $5 pork tenderloin.

Like Miami Mama, I was a bit nervous as I hadn't used a slow cooker before, nor had I cooked a pork roast! I used my Crock Pot on high and followed the recipe, but left out the pepper as my roast was pre-seasoned. I ended up leaving the roast in for 5 hours as the center was still a little frozen when I put it in the Crock Pot. At the 4 hour mark, I put in some quartered yellow potatoes, baby carrots and a couple of small onions. It turned out great and smelled amazing! I contemplated making a gravy with the liquid, but the au jus was perfectly flavorful and made for a nice, light dressing. Served with cucumber salad (using 2 Tbsp ranch dressing + 1 tsp white vinegar for sauce) for a nice, refreshing contrast.

Pretty good taste and super tender. But like other reviewers, I am wondering why you would put a very tender cut of meat in a crockpot. A less expensive cut of pork (like pork butt) will give much more flavor and be better suited to slow cooking. Also, to cut down on the saltiness, use low-sodium soy sauce and low sodium onion soup mix. I used a good merlot for the wine, but also added some beef broth - very tasty. But next time I'm using a cheaper cut of meat and saving the pork tenderloin for the grill.

This was very good!  I used beef broth instead of wine and less garlic.  It was juicy and cut-it-with-a-fork tender!  I cooked about a hour longer than recipe called for!

The title doesn't lie; this does taste amazing!  I've made it as is, many times.  After cooking, I strain the liquid.  Sometimes I thicken it to make a wonderful, flavorful gravy.  Sometimes I shred the pork and then add the liquid for amazing sandwiches.

I don't even like pork tenderloin very much but I thought this was amazing. I started with a frozen tenderloin so I cooked it three hours on high and it turned out to be extremely tender. I used some opened red zinfandel for the wine which gave it a great flavor. Toward the end I put in perogies and added 2 T. cornstarch to thicken up the gravy. The only thing I would do differently as others suggested is half the amount of soy sauce as this was on the verge of being too salty.

I made this tonight and it was very good.  Not quite as tender as I would have thought.   I covered the tenderloin with garlic and onion power, salt and peeper.  I added about 1/2 cup frozen mirepoix.  And then added mushrooms in the last hour.  Didnt do any thing else to the au jus, just ate it the way it was.  Served it with roasted apsaregus and cauliflower au gratin.

My main complaint was that the soy flavor was overpowering. When I was preparing this dish, I actually checked the amount of the soy3 times as it seemed high. My suggestion on this is don't try it for company the first time.

Loved this receipe.  Only difference was I had a center cut roast about 2 3/4 lbs.  I cooked on high for 5 hrs.  Delicious.  Followed all else exactly.  Will definitely make again.  The family loved it.  The gravy was terrific.

Really good. Made it exactly as directed.  My slow cooker is little hotter then norm so the pork was just this side of being overdone.  But it was delicious anyway and this now in my favorite file.  Thanks!

This recipe was incredible! Today will be my 3rd time making it. I have gotten rave reviews from everyone I've served it to so far. It is never bland. I recommend using the 2 lb pork loin that the recipe calls for and/or adding more seasoning if you have a larger cut of meat. Also, you can substitute red wine vinegar for red wine if you don't have any on hand.

Small effort, huge payoff! This was so easy and came out so tender, delicious and flavorful. I took the tip from another reviewer and added 2 tbsp. of cornstarch dissolved in a little bit of water and added it to the liquid in the crock pot (after removing the cooked pork) and turned it on high for 10 minutes to thicken up. It made a delicious au jus that was fabulous on the simple smashed red potatoes that I had on the side. Add dinner rolls and salad and you'll impress all of your dinner guests!

It was fair, but way, way too salty. May try a few of the other suggestions, but I really doubt I will make it again. Wasn't anything special and again way too salty. I even added some raw potateos to reduce the salt in the sauce, but that didn't help. Couldn't even eat the sauce. Had leftovers and no one wanted to eat them. May mix in with some barbeque sauce and make pulled pork sandwiches. Maybe that will salvage it...

I am amazed at the good reviews for this recipe. It was way too salty (and I added none) and so overpowered by garlic as to be inedible. I've always been pleased with allrecipe entries, but definitely NOT this one. My husband, who is not a picky eater at all, did not care for it either. Not a keeper.

This was amazing!  I followed this recipe with a few tweaks; I used red cooking wine and fresh garlic.  The first bite in my husband's mouth was accompanied with a moan.  Our original plans were to BBQ the remaining pork, but my husband informed me it was too good and that he wants the left overs tomorrow!  As recommended by others, I made gravy out of the juice and served it with mashed potatoes, the taste was amazing.  I have a Hamilton Beach crock pot.  My pork tenderloin was just shy of 3 pounds and it cooked perfectly on HIGH for 4 hours.

This was perfect! I'm a lazy cook so the idea of the crok pot really appeals to me and this recipe delivered. 
Super tender and flavorful. I added a layer of carrots and potatoes to the bottom just because I like the flavor they add (and added a little extra wine and water to compensate). Roasted some veggies to serve with it. So good! I'll make this again for sure.

We made this for dinner tonight and loved it! Even my husband who dislikes any kind of roast loved it. I did exactly what the recipe called for and it was so easy to make! I accidently forgot to put the crockpot on the day I intended to make it, and it sat for 2 nights in the fridge marinating. I know other reviewers said the onion soup and/or garlic overtook the flavors, but I have to disagree. We thought it was perfect. We will certainly be putting this into our meal rotation. Thanks for the recipe chowsito!

This was tender and moist with good flavor, but WAY too salty.  Plus all of the dry onion soup mixes at my grocery store have MSG in them.  I might try this again minus the soy sauce and with my own seasoning mix and I think it could be 5 stars.

Very tender and the flavor was mediocre. Just not my cup of tea.

Made this tonight and no one enjoyed it.  Not sure where I went wrong.  :(
I cooked it a little to long so the meat was dry.  We could have gotten past that if the flavor was good, but it too was unpleasant.

It was tender, but my family really didn't care much for the wine.  It made an otherwise amazing roast kind of gross tasting...

This recipe is DELICIOUS!!! I have to say I usually change recipes up, but definitely didn't need to at ALL with this one. Sauce is perfect as an au jus on the side to dip the meat into, works perfectly with mashed potatoes. Be careful of the pork you buy, however!! I purchased one tenderloin from Stop & Shop and it was too salty the first time I made it, however Trader Joes tenderloin was PERFECT last night. I also used a cheap merlot for the wine. Delicious, can't wait to have it again :)

I adapted this recipe for the pressure cooker, just as it was printed, and prepared it twice.  My prep time remained at about 15 minutes, but the cook time was reduced to 40 minutes.  The second time, I added potatoes and baby carrots to the pot for the final 10 minutes of cook time.  My family can't get enough!

This is truly amazing!  My wife and everyone that tried this, simply loved it.  I made one slight change.  I added no water and used 2 cups of wine.

Thanks chowsito for sharing this recipe.

This is the best thing I've ever made in my crockpot.  The juice that remains after cooking s one of the most delicious thing's I've ever eaten.  We pour it in a bowl and dip the tenderloin in it as we eat.

All I can say is WOW! The au jus in this recipe is absolutely to die for. I used the reduced sodium soy sauce and only about 2 tbsp of it and added rosemary and green peppercorns to it, also a bit of Italian seasoning grinder thing. I beg everyone to try this! I literally wanted to drink the jus right out of the bowl, and I did! A++++++++++++

Awesome! Best pork tenderloin I've made. I didn't have onion soup mix either. To a Costco package of tenderloin (2 tenderloins) I added 4 cups of water, 2 whole onions, 7 garlic cloves, soy sauce, Worcestershire, beef boullion, red wine and thyme. Yummy! Blended all the liquids in blender and made gravy.

Followed recipe exactly but felt garlic over powered the entire dish. So many people loved this recipe, wish I knew what went wrong. Are you sure it is supposed to be 3 tablespoons of garlic?

I wasn't sure about this recipe based on other reviews. Let me tell you, it is amazing!! Perfect the way it is, no changes needed. Tender, juicy, and full of flavor. Pour the extra cooking liquid over top for extra flavor! Fantastic!!!

easy to make, similar to a recipe I do with beef roast in the crock pot.  My recipe does not call for Soy sauce.  Even though I use lite Soy, it was way to salty.  I would make again but with the Lipton onion and Soy it was over the top salt.  SKIP THE SOY SAUCE.

Being a former chef, I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. Sometimes what is simple works better, so why change it. I am not a fan of red wine for cooking but I do like white wine and beer. I substituted 6 ounces of wheat beer for the red wine and added some freshly ground peppercorns into the batch. Turned out spectacular plus the peppercorns added a little kick to it. Family loved it. Plus after everything was done, look at what was left in the cooker, it is basically onion soup with some pork stock in it. I saved it and turned it into soup for next day's lunch. It was great.

Was not really a fan of this recipe. I think I will try and make it again, but with the suggestions of some of the other viewers. A lot less vinegar I think is a must, it totally overtook the pork.

This really was amazing.  I used a 2.5 lb pork roast because it was cheaper and I cooked it in the crock pot on low for 8 hours.  The meat was like butter.  I would use half the amount of soy sauce next time though, the juice was a little salty for my liking.

I followed the recipe exactlly and found the sauce extremely salty. Also, the garlic would be better mixed into the liquid, leaving it on top caused the garlic flavor to be unpleasantly strong and I love garlic! The pork was cooked nicely though, it was tender and moist. I'll make this again, but only add one tablespoon of soy sauce.

I used Worcestershire Sauce instead of soy and took advice of other reviewers to add onions and make the  leftover sauce into gravy.. the end result was Delicious. Paired with mashed potatoes, steamed asparagus and biscuits this meal was perfect for a chilly fall night!

I made this and it was great.  Added cr. chicken soup and cr. mushroom soup(both the healthy request types) and mushrooms when I put the chicken in.  I used red. fat cream cheese...it was delicious.  my husband and kids will not eat chicken breast because it is dry but not in this dish..they didn't even know it was chicken breast. my hubby said I should make this more often...and I will!

This was absolutely delicious.  It's the way I'm always going to cook my pork tenderloin from now on.  I added a little rosemary.  I strained the juice and thickened it with a little corn starch, very good!

We made this for supper this evening with our new Crock Pot, my 20 year old son claimed it was the best meal he had in months! I think I would cut back on the onion soup mix next time to half package, as I did find it quite salty. The port literally fell apart, no knives necessary!

Not enough flavor within the meat for our family, at least we had somewhat flavorful au jus.  I would definitely sear the meat after perhaps a dry rub if there ever is a "next time" for this recipe.

The au jus is amazing -- I made mashed potatoes to go with the meal, and the au jus drizzled over the potatoes were absolutely delicious. The pork was okay -- not really great, not bad either.

Absolutely the best and easiest recipe i've come across for the crockpot! So tasty, my home smells like i slaved over thanksgiving dinner! My hubby is the cook of the house so i hope he likes it :-D... I used marsala cooking wine, 4hrs on high, came out juicy and fork tender with plenty of au jus for the mashed potatoes...THE BOMB.COM!

This is the BEST crock pot pork loin ever! I didn't have soy sauce so I used worchishire and added a small onion. I also cooked it on low for 10 hours, it just fell apart! I highly recommend this!

Okay, I'll confess.  I didn't make this exactly but the basic concept is great.  I was looking to do something different with my country style pork ribs that involved slow cooking in my oven and this turned out perfect.  Sliced a onion for the soup mix and I rubbed the ribs down with thyme, black pepper, some salt and garlic powder.  Skipped the fresh garlic because I didn't have time just then to chop it up.  I cooked it in a covered casserole dish at 300*F for 3 hours.  Drained the juices into a small pan.  Skimmed the grease off the top (remember I'm using country style ribs instead) and added a roux to thicken the stock for a gravy on the side.  YUM.

I Made this yesterday, I followed the recipe, except my tenderloin was 4.5lbs, and I added 1 cup of water to have more liquid. The house smelled amazing when I got home, the broth tasted great, and my pork was super tender, now the only problem that I had with this was the fact that the wine flavor was very strong in the meat, I didn't like that very much. I think you could probably knock that 3/4 cup of red wine down to 1/4 and it would be good. I'm just happy I was thinking straight and didn't add more wine since my roast 2.5 lbs larger. 
Now the family loved it, or so they said, And I think it was pretty good, but really my personal opinion is these ingredients are better suited for a beef or lamb roast.

With so many great reviews, I was excited to try this recipe, but should have heeded all the negative ones.  I followed the recipe exactly, but also studded the pork tenderloin with fresh garlic cloves. I also used Low Sodium soy sauce. After cooking it for 1 hour on High, and 3 hours on Low, the pork itself turned out moist and tender.  But the sauce was horrible.. so salty as to be inedible.  I rescued dinner by opening a can of Campbell's Beefy Mushroom soup, then adding a splash of Balsamic Vinegar, ground black pepper, and 1/4 cup of the juice from the slow cooker, and heating that up-- it made a great gravy.  The one in the cooker was just too horribly salty to eat as is.  I will make slow cooker pork tenderloin again, but not with the same ingredients--next time I'll try using the Campbells Beefy Mushroom plus some wine and fresh onions.  Thanks anyway.

The smell of this wasn't pleasing to me when I first opened the crockpot, although once I got it out of the sauce it was much better.  I think it was the soy sauce.  My family can only handle so much soy sauce.  The meat was tender and moist when dinner time came around.  I cooked my 2.7 lb roast on low for 5 hours.  I might decrease the soy sauce next time.

This recipe was okay.  It really didn't have a lot of flavor other than onion which was too strong.  I didn't like the consistency of the pork at all when it came out.  It was edible and the husband and kids ate it... but it was just edible.  That's it.  Nothing special.

I love this tenderloin.  I did sprinkle it with garlic powder, minced onion, salt and pepper and seared it before putting it in the crock pot.  I added the other ingredients to the pan and scraped it all together into the crock pot.  Delicious!  4 hours on high was perfect.

Absolutely delicious!  My daughter (who is 18 months, and a picky eater) also loved it.  I served it with mashed potatoes and also added baby carrots to the slow cooker.  Defintely a new favorite in our house!

We had this tonight for dinner, put the tenderloins in the crockpot frozen before I left for work. Cooked all day, fell apart when slicing it up, probably not the best presentation, but looking forward to hot pork and gravy sandwiches tomorrow night.

Really good. Didn't have onion soup mix so used the recipe on here.  I thought it was a bit salty, but my family loved it!!!  I served with white rice and some sauteed veggies.  Will definitely make again. Thanks.

Although I'm not typically a fan of pork, I thought this recipe was great - simple and tasty.  I did add a few sprinkles of some spices I saw suggested in comments, but not much.  I also added mushrooms, just because I love them.  Even my picky three year old ate all of his pork.  I paired it with garlic mashed potatoes.  The au jus was a little salty, but I just didn't add salt to my potatoes and enjoyed them with a little au jus.  It would have made a very tasty gravy if I had corn starch on hand.

I made sure it was ready before my husband left for work this afternoon, and I left it on low for another hour and a half until the kids and I were ready to eat.  It was just right both times.

This recipe was delicious. I love anything in a crockpot! I cooked 4.5 lbs of tenderloin, so was unsure about the cook time. I recalled 1 member saying that the meat was so tender is just fell apart, instead of slicing it. I cooked it for 5 hours on high and it still did that. I'm not complaining tho, because it was still delicious. I covered my pork tenderloin in a mixture of garlic powder, salt, pepper & onion powder. Then added the other ingredients. I used a pinot noir wine and it went nicely with the pork. I also added in a bit of sugar, because I found it to be a little too salty for our taste. At the end I thickened the sauce with cornstarch. We ate the gravy with the pork & over the mashed potatoes. I'll definitley make this again!

Very easy, tender, and a real pleaser!  The next time I make this, I will follow an earlier suggestion by omitting the dry onion soup mix (because of the sodium content) and use a cut up onion and a few spices.

Super good but I did change things up a bit. I used the same ingredients but made my own onion soup mix and replaced the red wine with chicken broth. Marinated in a ziploc in the fridge for 2 or so hours. Instead of using a slow cooker(I researched and a lot of people said its a waste to slow cook since it is already a tender piece of meat and baking in the oven was better:)) I browned in a skillet on each side(ab 5 mins total) before baking in the oven for 15-20 minutes. Did not cover. And OH MY GOSH! It was good! Hubs loved it and I(not a huge meat fan) loved it! Served with the sweet and spicy sweet potato recipe here and a salad. Clean plates for both of us!! :)

I made this on the weekend. I followed exactly. This was fabulous, everyone loved it. I took some of the liquid to make a gravy with. Make sure you use good wine, wine that you would drink. Makes a huge difference. I cooked this on high for 3 hours.

This was a hit in my house. I follow the instructions but then addmy own twist to it. I did not have red wine so instead I added red cooking wine. Next time I use less with the cooking wine. I added more mushrooms and green onions.  I threw in some spices as well. If I do 4 hours on my Crockpot then the settings is on high so I cooked it for 6 hours instead. Pork came out nice and tender. With the gravy, meat and mashed potatoes it all worked out great! I will most definitely make this again.

My husband and daughter loved this! I thought it was good.  My dish looked very dark, probably from the onion soup mix I used.  I think next time, I'm going to use white wine. We'll definitely make it again.  This is the moistest pork tenderloin I've ever had.  Quite often, it's dry. Thanks for the recipe!  It's so easy!  It's a keeper!

I made this for dinner a few nights ago and it was delicious!  Husband LOVED it.  Great flavor!  It was very moist and tender.  I did cut slits into the pork before cooking and stuffed it full of fresh garlic.  My slow cooker has a 4 hour setting that is "high".  After 3 hours the pork split down the middle because it was a little too tender.  I turned it to warm after that to finish preparing the side dishes.

Wow was this good! Although I completely forgot to put it in the crock pot and ended up searing it on the stovetop and finishing it in the oven (4 lb. 350 deg. 80 min.) The sauce made it super-special, and we spooned it out of the baking dish onto mashed potatoes. The next day, the tenderloin made for excellent sandwiches w/ tomato, a smear of the sauce, and provolone.

This is the first online recipe I have given 5 stars!  This was so good.  My only change was substituting the soy sauce for 2 tablesoons of worcestershire and I sprinkled a gunpowder seasoning called Southern Flavor on the roast before adding to the crockpot.  Finally when I removed the roast from the pot I too added 1/4 cup of flour a turned the pot on high to make a gravy which I serverd with mashed potatoes.  I used Shiraz.

I was disappointed in this recipe. I halved the onion soup mix, put in 2 T of minced garlic instead of 3T and still found it to be too much onion and garlic.  Also, even though it was covered the whole time it was cooking, the liquid cooked down until it was so strong that I had to add a can of low-sodium chicken broth.  Without the added broth, it would have been uneatable.  Other than the above, I followed the recipe.

This was great and cooked perfectly.  I sent some home with my mom, and days later she was still talking about how good it was. Later:  have now tried it twice and it's still a 5!  It slices so perfectly, too.  The au jus is wonderful.

This was ok, but the tenderloin just fell apart after cooking.  Probably too nice of a cut of meat for this recipe.  I also thought the meat was a little bland.  The juice left did make a nice gravey and was saltier so that helped it out quite a bit.  I won't make it again unless I use a different cut of meat, and maybe I'll brown it first and salt and pepper it before putting it in the slow cooker.

This was an awesome dish. I made it pretty much exactly as shown, used some cheap red wine and 4 hours was plenty of time for the 2.59 lb tenderloin. I served it with Garlic Red Mashed Potatoes and Fried Asparagus wrapped in prosciutto. I think the best part was the Au Jus... I put the fatty pieces in a sauce pan with 4 table spoons of flour and simmered it for a few minutes. IT WAS AWESOME!

Wow...can we say salt!  This recipe was almost too salty to eat.  Maybe I used the wrong kind of onion soup mix, but if I were to do this again I would cut the mix in 1/2 and leave out 1/2 of the soy sauce.  I might substitute real onion and go with sodium free soy.  The pork was tender and it smelled good while cooking.

My boys all loved it! I browned the meat first and I am glad because it gave it a better look.   Flavor was amazing and made so much juice!  Love it...

Incredibly tender!  This was absolutely delicious and couldn't be any easier.  No prep - in the crock and out the door - fabulous dinner when I got home from work.

Deliciously tender, tenderloin.  Only variation was I cook it on low for 6 hours. The sauce has great flavor.  I thickened it with corn starch and served it over mashed potatoes and veggies.  Great meal.

This was a wonderful meal. I usually follow the recipe as given the first time I make it , then tweak if needed. This will be made exactly as is. I used a merlot and low sodium soy sauce. Next time I will have some mashed potatoes to go with the yummy au jus. How divine that will be! The meat was even more delicious the nexy day after being in the sauce. I may try marinating it overnight before cooking next time.

This was very good! My whole family enjoyed it. I did cut down the soy sauce because of the sodium content and only added 1/4 of the soup envelope. It was great!

This was absolutely amazing!!!  I cut back on the garlic just a little and added a bit more wine (about 1/4 a cup more) only because my pork loin weighed 2.5 lbs instead of the 2lb as stated.  This was filled with flavor and sooooo tender that it was falling off of the fork while I was cutting it.  I cooked it on low for 4 1/2 hours and high for the last 30 mins.  My children, ages 10 and 4, loved it!  Others said it was very salty, strong garlic flavor, bland and strong wine flavor but mine had none of that.  It was a perfect balance.  I will be making it again soon!

Being honest, 3tablespoons minced garlic was too much for me:(  The aroma of garlics was too strong and I had to throw some away. this pork tenderloin wasn't one for me.

I have made this dish several times for company and it is always a hit. I like to serve it over mashed potatoes and with a side of green beans. Make sure you use a decent red wine since it will determine the quality of the au jus. I like to use a Shiraz most of the times that I make it, but any good red wine will do.

I HATE PORK LOIN ROAST.  But I had an extra one in my freezer just sitting there and had just got a brand new slow cooker for my birthday and saw this recipe and decided to try it.  OMG! It was delicious.  I did the cornstarch thing with the sauce and it turned out perfect.  I served it with rice pilaf and poured the gravy over the pork and rice and it was delicious!

fixed this the other night for my hubby and I. The meat just fell apart after 4 1/2 hours, and it was 2.5lbs. Plenty of time. Very flavorful! My husband made sandwiches with the meat to take to work for 3 days after I made it and said it was awesome. Will fix again! I did substitute on tablespoon of the soy sauce with Worchestershire Sauce, and put 1/2cup red wine. I'm sure it would have tasted just fine if I followed the recipe exactly though. Thanks for sharing!!

It is GOOD. I was a little nervous making this dish because it was in a crock pot and my recipes always turn out dry, but it was really moist. Diffinitly add beef stock it give it lots of flavor. My dad thought that if I used the remaning onion and liquid from the pot I could makt an good gravy with it It turns out that my dad was right. It had lots of flovor to it and it didn't have an overpowering onion flovr to it. For the gravy I used 4 tb. of flour/butter and a cup of liquide to it and then added some of the onions to it.

OMG it is so yummy!  I was worried because of the mixed reviews, it seems like people either love it or hate it.  From what I can tell, if you hate the smell of it cooking, you will hate it.  I LOVED the smell, it drove me crazy!   I followed the recipe for the most part - 4 hrs on low is the correct timing, although I don't see how an hour more could hurt, but I wouldn't risk more than that.  The only differences I made were adding a dash of Worchestire sauce and I used a packet of pork gravy mix.  Also, I did not have any red wine on hand, so I used a white Zinfandel (Arbor Mist to be exact) instead.  I also poked a fork through the tenderloin about 4 times and about halfway through cooking I turned it over.   I served this with Stovetop chicken stuffing, and put some of the juice on top of it, and also made Hawaiian bread in the breadmaker - it takes 3 1/2 hours, so by the time the tenderloin was done, the bread was at the perfect temperature to eat! A fantastic recipe!

This was great!  Cooked for only 3 1/2 hours not 4.  Added extra garlic to have more flavor and added only 2 tblspns soy and 1 tblspn worcestershire sauce.  Will make again.

Tried this for Easter dinner today and it was a big hit.  It looked dry but was very moist.  It was very easy to prepare and leave cooking while at church. Will definitely make this again.

Don't waste your time on this one.  I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with an absolutely flavorless, mediocre meal.  This is a wonderful, versitile piece of meat that is deserving of a far better treatment than this.

this recipe is definitely a keeper! So easy and a wonderful flavor. I did sub beef stock for the water and worcheshire sauce for the soy sauce. I actually made double the sauce - b/c we really like to have extra gravy... I also used 2 packs of the onion soup mix since I was making extra broth. I over cooked it because I get nervous about cooking pork. So, FYI 8 hours on low is too long, probably would have been good at 6 hrs. We didn't think the wine flavor was too overwhelming... I used Granacha. I agree with the person who said it tasted more beefy than like pork (which was fine with me since I don't love pork). Definitely will make again!

This was incredible! I don't use dry mixes so I used onion salt along with a tablespoon of Worcestershire, a dusting of Tony Chachere's original seasoning, a tablespoon of Chipotle Chile powder, and a splash or two of Tabasco Chipotle Pepper Sauce.  I didn't have any red wine so I used red apple cider vinegar instead.  Everyone raved about how good it was.  It was bright and spicy but not too hot and fall apart juicy and tender.  Will make this again and again.

I make this with 2 2pound pork roast instead of tenderloin and it is great! Using 1 1/2 envelopes of onion soup mix cuts down on the sodium without losing any flavor. Low sodium soy sauce helps cut down on the sodium as well. I serve one roast and freeze the other with the au jus in seperate container.

Very tender.  One note, I followed some suggestions and made a dry rub and seared the meat prior to putting in crock pot.  If you do this I would recommend using ingredients that are not very salty.  I used onion powder, salt, garlic salt and black pepper and it made the gravy a little too salty.  Wish I would have left out the salt.

This is a very good recipe.  I browned the meat first.  The only problem I have is that for pork tenderloin you really need to S L O W cook this meat. The  4 hours on LOW  stated here in the posted recipe  really isn't enough time for the tendons in the meat to break down. Ideally 8 to 10 hours on LOW is good for pork. When I don't have 8 hours, usually start the meat on HIGH for 2 hours then another 3-4 on LOW. The meat should be fork tender.

This was amazing and so easy.  The sauce, I made into a gravy and I could not stop eating it. I am keeping the gravy for leftovers.  It was simply devine.  A real keeper.  I didnt use a tenderloin, just a regular pork roast and was so tender.

It definitely had a "different" flavor, I think due to the wine, but my family and I enjoyed it. I thickened the au jus with cornstarch and made a gravy which I served over mashed potatoes. I reduced the soy sauce slightly after reading some of the reviews and used fresh chopped garlic instead of the pre-made minced garlic.

Fantastic!!! Made a few  modifications: 1.  Took  others recs on adding 1 chopped onion 2. Used one packet of french onion soup mix 3. Made small holes in the meat and placed half pieces of garlic into them. 4. Only used 1/2 cup of wine an could taste it nicely in the meat, I think 3/4 cup may have been overbaring for my taste. 5.  Used about 1/4 cup of soy sauce, hard to tell b/c I just added it without measuring. 6.  It took about 6 hours to cook on my crock pot.  I did 3 hours on low cook and then another 3 hours on high cook.  Everyboy loved it, it's a keeper.

I made this as a special dinner for my husband but it was not good....at all.  I followed the recipe exactly but I did not care for the aroma or the taste.  We ended up cutting away all of the outside of the meat to get the sauce off and just eating the inside (with was cooked perfectly, by the way).  I don't know why we had such a bad time with this but it won't cross our plates ever again!

This was AMAZING. I used whole garlic instead of minced and inserted into the loin. I also used a regular pork loin instead of a tenderloin and seared it on all sides in a hot pan before putting it in the crockpot. I threw in about 7 or 8 whole button mushrooms. The mushrooms absorbed most of the strong alcohol flavor and kept it from being imparted on the loin. This is going to become a standard in my recipe book. DELICIOUS!!

I'm not really crazy about red wine but I thought I'd try it and see what happens.  I made it exactly as per the directions.  I ended up taking the pork out and b/c it was so tender and I didn't want to waste it, I doused it in bbq sauce and let it sit in the fridge until dinner and we warmed it back up and had bbq pork sandwiches.  They would have been really good if not for the slight red wine flavor that still lingered. Definitely won't try this again. You have to really love the flavor of red wine to like this I guess.

this recipe was okay, I am a big garlic lover and i tried what one of the other reviews said and put the garlic in the meat, it was horrible it gave the meat a bad flavor. i added potatoes and sliced onion and they were great! the meat that was not close to the garlic was better but i would not use this recipe again

This was truely AMAZING. I fixed it as written except did not add the water. I didn't serve it with the juice either as the meat was so juicy and tender, it didn't need it. I used whatever wine I had open and cooked it 8 hours on low. I will definately fix this over and over.

A little less garlic and it would be GREAT.  It made for some amazing leftovers - either by itself or as a sandwich.  It was very tender and just fell apart!

Oh MAN!!!  This is absolutely AWESOME!  I have never had such a moist and tender piece of pork.....EVER!!!  Only substitute I made is like another person suggested, was to use garlic powder and rub on the loin, rather than use minced.  Our family likes the flavor, but not when you get a hunk!  :)  Other than that, this is by far THE BEST pork I've ever had. Received many compliments during dinner!    Thanks so much for sharing!!!

I thought this was way too salty. I browned it before putting in crockpot and thickened the sauce with cornstarch added some shiitake mushrooms to it. It was just okay.

I absolutely loved this recipe. My boyfriend and his guest came back from hiking in the Sierra Nevada and needed a hearty meal and this was the perfect fit. I added fresh onion slices to it and made sure to cut slits into the pork and stuff it with minced garlic. I used a wine that had a mix of merlot and cabernet sauvignon. It makes the home smell beautiful all day long!!! Then when it was done I put some sauce in a pan and brought to a boil and then added a couple tablespoons of flour until it thickened into a nice gravy.

Wonderful recipe!  I browned/seared pork loins in pan prior to putting in crock pot.  The smell while cooking all day was heavenly!  When meat was done I transfered the sauce from crock pot to simmer pan. I added corn starch (dilluted in a little water) to simmer pan to thicken the sauce to more of a gravy consistency.  The whole family absolutely loved this.  Super flavorful and super tender.  This one is a definite keeper. Thanks!

My family enjoyed this recipe. I'm not a pork fan, but I really liked the flavor of this. Like others, I made changes to the recipe. I didn't have any wine on hand, so I substituted brandy. I used 1/3 cup of brandy and then added water to the 3/4 cup mark. It was fantastic.   Unfortunately, I overcooked the meat (4 1/2 hours), and it was falling apart.  My results would have worked better as a sandwhich on a roll of crusty French bread.  Otherwise, in the future, I will (and recommend) check the meat after 3 hours or so to ensure it will cut nicely as a roast.

I made this for the first time yesterday, to (hopefully) impress my grandmother, father and step-mother (who is a nutritionist and foodie).  It was a HIT!  I am a novice cook but love using the slow cooker for meals and this worked out perfectly.  The only changes I made were to substitute a can of Campbell's onion soup rather than the dry soup mix, doubled the wine, and cooked two pork tenderloins at once.  Amazing!  Thanks!!

This was wonderful.  My 5, and 8 year old loved it.  My boyfriend loved it too.  This was a major meal.  I stabbed it with garlic as other mentioned.  When pulling the pork out of the crock pot it was falling a part which was just perfect.  I havent mastered how to make gravy as I am a newbie to cooking.  Timing was perfect.  I served it with mash potatos (instant) as I didnt have a ton of time. I made it two weeks in a row. The second time I turned the left overs into pulled pork bbq.   This is a wonderful recipe.....  Thank you so much.

It was really good, but I'd use a less expensive cut of pork next time,  It seemed a waste to cook such a tender cut of pork for so long.

I wasn't wild about this. The garlic on top of the pork got kind of bitter and funky tasting, and the au jus wasn't that good. I don't think the crockpot is an ideal cooking method for a tenderloin because of the dryness factor. I won't make this again.

I made this a few weeks ago and it was amazing. As a habit I brown anything that plan to put in my crock pot, I seasoned my tenderloins with crushed black pepper, and some adobo, I also didn't use an entire packet of onion soup mix, opting for fresh sliced onions instead. I added a little less wine and a little more water. I also added two dried bay leaves to the pot. The meat virtually falls apart! I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch and served with hot white rice and seasoned green beans. Yummy. I plan on making this dish again and again.

Good flavor and very easy to put together.  I made it exactly as directed except my roast was 3 lbs insted of 2 lbs.  So I cooked it on high instead of low because I was afraid it wouldn't be done in the middle.  It was so tender it almost fell apart when I cut it to serve it.  The leftovers were just as good if not better than the first day since it had time to soak up more of the juice.  I'm thinking I may discard the remaining juice and shred the rest of the leftovers and add BBQ sauce for sandwiches.  YUM!

This was absolutely fabulous! I used a pork loin closer to 3 pounds. Cooked on high for 1 hour then reduced to low for the remaining 3 hours. It truly did melt in your mouth. And oh, so easy! The sauce was great. This will make wonderful sandwiches or burritos as leftovers.

Meat was very tender and tasty but waaay to salty. There is a lot of salt in the onion soup mix and a lot more in the soy sauce. I will make this again but use either real onions or regular onion soup

This made a delicious gravy!  I used a pork roast (top loin), not a tenderloin.  (Tenderloins are expensive and really not necessary for a slow cooker recipe.)  Followed the recipe exactly and took another poster's suggestion to add a corn starch/water mixture to the crock after removing the meat to thicken the gravy.  The meat was very tender & the gravy was the best part!

I made this last night. I followed the recipe exactly.  It was very good. The only thing I would change is that next time I will use a pork loin instead of tenderloin, and I will brown it shortly before addding it to the slow cooker. I will definitely be making this again, so easy and delicious.

I made this according to the recipe, but I turned the loins every hour or so.  It turned out yum! Not too sweet, not too salty.  Will definitely try this again!

This recipe worked out very well. I've had poor luck with tenderloin in the past, but this one was a hit! I didn't have any red wine on hand, so I substituted 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, and 1 1/2 cups water, and used low-sodium soy sauce. Even my picky 6 year old son gobbled it up and asked for more! I cooked it on low for 4 hours, and then on high for another 1 1/2 hours, as it was not quite tender enough, but and the end, it was falling apart and I could cut it with a fork. THANKS!

This was great.  I thickened the juice with a roux and used it on both the meat and mashed potatoes or baked potatoes.  Will definitely do again.

This was so delicious my family went crazy for this so easy.  I took the advice of others by adding the cornstarch and some milk to make a gravy for the mashed potatoes and green beans with this.  So easy and yummy.  I would like to make this some way with low sodium cooking for the next time I did use low sodium soy sauce.

What a great meal. Looks and tastes very gourmet when plated.  I used a lemon garlic tenderloin and added four sliced celery stalks, a package of small whole mushrooms, one can cream of mushroom, one cream of celery and one cream of chicken soup, one yellow onion cut into eighths and half a cup of Chardonnay.  I did sear the tenderloin before placing in the slow cooker. This meal was a family pleaser and warmed up fantastically the next day in the microwave.  Thanks for the great idea!

Wow, I hardly eat meat, let alone pork and this recipe was awesome! The Au ju was very salty to serve as is, so I made a gravy. I started in a saucepan making a rue with butter and flour. Then added 3 or 4 laddles of the au ju and a couple of splashes of milk. Whisked and boiled it for 30 seconds and voila--gravy. To throw everything in the slow cooker took five minutes. Simple and tasty dinner!

Sorry, but this was not amazing, at least not for me. Now my 13 yr old on the other hand couldn't get enough! The meat was very tender and fell apart, but the flavor was actually too much for me with the wine. I would probably cut back some on the wine next time.

I love this dish. Have made it a couple of times now and every time it is delish. Couple of things though, the pork is done in way less time than 4 hrs on high in my slowcooker. I have a newer one, so perhaps the heat is higher (?). The last time I seared the pork after inserting garlic cloves as another reviewer suggested. While searing I added salt and peppar. Then I deglazed the pan with 1 cup warm water and used that tasty juice/water as the 1 cup water the recipe called for. I highly recommend trying this one out.

Based on my tastes this recipes gets 4 Stars... my Hubby would easily give it 5! This recipes as written was a bit salty for my taste, however the Hubby loves salty foods and he dug right in eating 2 helpings! Overall I think it has a good flavor, I think next time I will cut back on the salt a bit by using low sodium products. We served this with mashed potatoes and a nice green salad, Good meal option. Thanks for sharing!

This was EXCELLENT! I used a can of beef broth instead of water and at the end added a dry pack of brown gravy mix to thicken it up a little.  I thought the soy sauce combined with the other ingredients tasted really good.  My husband and my mother LOVED it!  Thank You!

This was pretty good.  I left out the soy sauce, just seemed like a strange ingredient to me.  I also browned the meat on all sides before placing in the slow cooker - this adds a nice color to the meat instead of the typical pale slow cooker color.  Per suggestion I rubbed the garlic, salt and pepper all over the top - also added rosemary - then left it alone all day.  Smelled great, not overly dry and good flavor.

You know I wasn't sure what to think when I saw the reviews about how good it makes your house smell, but those folks are dead on. I also have this weird habit of laughing if I try something for the first time and it is amazingly good. So, let just say I got a good chuckle about this whole Pork Tenderloin Recipe. Three words to describe this recipe; Simple, tender, and delicious. OH ! Don't forget to plug your roast with cloves of garlic ! THANK YOU !!!

I just served this for our family's Christmas dinner and it was amazing!  I left out the soy sauce (it has a particular flavor that I wanted to avoid) and we pan seared the pork before putting into the slow cooker.  I also used chicken stock instead of water because I knew I was going to make the liquid into gravy before serving out meal and wanted it to be extra flavorful.  Delicious!  Served the gravy over the pork, mashed potatoes, and stuffing and also served some fresh spinach cooked with olive oil and garlic.  The perfect Christmas dinner with very little work on our part.  Thanks you, thank you, thank you!!!

Just made this for Sunday supper and it was absolutely delicious, didn't alter a thing. It's a tad salty like other reviewers have written but I wouldnt change anything. Used the gravy as a dipper with crusty rye bread and swathed over the mashed potatoes. This dish is "Amazing"!

Very good recipe.  Here's what we did...

1.8lbs of tenderloin
some rosemary
sliced onions (not soup mix!)
2 cups of water (instead of one)
some beef broth
bit of soy sauce 
minced garlic.

gave the tenderloin a pan sear with olive oil, salt and pepper.  put it in the crockpot with all the other listed ingredients and let it go on high for probably 3.5 hours.  Not dry at all and it just fell apart.  

Our only complaint was that it is a bit salty, but since we used the liquid as an au jus, it was fine.  

we'll def. make this recipe again!

This was a great recipe, the meat was moist and tender.  I cut back 1 tsp on the soya sauce and added 1/4 cup HP Sauce to bold up the flavour.  Really nice, will use again and again.

LEFTOVER ALERT:  I cut the meat into cubes, placed it in a 9x13 pan, poured 2 cups of cooked elbow noodles over meat, then topped with slices of American cheese, and poured the left over gravy over all.  Baked at 350 until cheese melted.  Better than the original meal!

I have no idea what went wrong with this recipe, followed everything to a T and my husband wouldn't even eat it.  I thought it looked so good and it got so many good reviews I thought it was going to be. I will try it again, just to see if it was an off day for our taste buds.

I agree with another reviewer who wrote that the gravy would be better with beef. It was a bit strong for pork. However, the tenderloin was moist. The taste was not that bad; I will try some alternatives later. I browned the tenderloin in a skillet first after seasoning with a little salt, pepper, and some of the garlic.

This pork was great!  My husband went crazy over it and said it was one of his new favorites.  The only changes I made were that I browned the pork first (looks better) and turned the cooking juices into a gravy.  Will make over and over!!

This was good. It's a good idea to put the juice in a small pot at the end and to thicken it to serve over noodles. I served the 2nd tenderloin sliced and reheated in the left-over gravy and it was still good 2 days later.

This recipe came out awesome!  Used the full amount of garlic (which was not overpowering) but added only 1 TBSP of soy sauce ... ended up in crock pot for 6 hrs and came out perfect!  A definite keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

I used a burgundy and the reader's tip to use 1/2 head of garlic. I found the meat tender but the overall taste was too salty from using the whole packet of dry onion soup and soy sauce quantities called for. With the reviewer's tip to insert 1/2 head of garlic, it was too overpowering for that delicately flavored meat. I think it would be good to do this with a nice red wine as the recipe calls for and perhaps 1/2 packet of onion soup mix. Doesn't need garlic beyond the minced garlic quantity called for to get a nice flavor w/o being overpowering. Tender roast, convenience of crock pot. Try adding mushrooms during last phase of cooking for another version of gravy.

Great! I have a comment on the reviewers that thought it was too salty.  Whatever you do, DON'T USE COOKING WINE - It has sodium in it.  USE A GOOD CABERNET and it will turn out great.

My whole family, including an almost 4 yr old and 6 year old, thought this recipe was outstanding!  I also made a gravy out of the juices with a little bit of cornstarch to thicken it and we had that over smashed red skinned potatoes.  This is definitely a keeper and great if you are crunched for time!

Good, but not great.  I'd make it again if in a time crunch.  It's good poured over mashed potatoes.

Wow, this was great, follow the recipe to the tee, but also made slit in the tenderloin and place garlic sliver all over the tenderlion.  This is a keeper my family love it. Finally found a receipe for pork tenderlion that is yummy to the taste buds.

This was good. I did switch the wine for apple juice (we don't do wine) and used low sodium soy sauce & worcestershire as suggested in previous reviews. I definitely will make again. Loved being able to cook in slow cooker and meat was very tender.

This was wonderful! Meat was done after 2 1/2 hrs. I only used 1/4 c. wine and the rest beef broth. I made gravy from the au jus that tasted delish over the meat and some mashed potatoes.

This was very good.  The meat came out tender and the broth was delicious.  I added a rub seasoning that I use on many meats, but otherwise did just as the original recipe called for and we all enjoyed this pork dinner.

I used red "cooking" wine instead of regular red wine, and I increased the cook time to 5 hours (because I wanted to make sure it was done...but 4 hours would have been plenty). The pork was so tender and tasted delicious. 
I made side dishes of rosemary potatoes and steamed asparagus for a wonderful Easter meal. 
Thanks so much for this recipe! It's going in my permanent file.

Excellent Recipe.  I replicated it for the most part with the following exceptions:  I used a pre-marinated pork loin (Smithfield Garlic & Herb) and while cooking added chopped onions and thinly sliced garlic to the broth.  These minor changes/additions were enough to create a VERY flavorful dish that is sure to please.  For a side, I added a basic macaroni & cheese casserole.  Perfect comfort food for the chilly winter!!

This was very good. I didn't use a crockpot, I put it in the oven for 350 for about 2 hours then increased the temp to 400 for about 1/2 hour. Tasted great, nice and tender. The red wine gave it a nice flavor taking a lot of the pork taste away, which my hubby loved!! Will make again.

Really good! I use a large pork loin roast and double the sauce, put it in the crock pot(I Have an extra large crock pot) with red potatoes, carrots and celery (no onions because of the soup mix). I have made this many times. If you use store brand onion soup mix it is VERY SALTY, But if you use name brand soup mix it is NOT TOO Salty. Juice is awesome as gravy over the veggies! Makes great leftovers.

I made this recipe for Christmas last year and so far EVERYONE who ate with us then has requested that I make it again. Looks like we've got a new tradition! It's so easy to put together, so I don't miss spending the holiday with my family; yet it's special enough to really be an impressive crowd pleaser! I'm not much of a chef so I followed the recipe to the letter and it is DELICIOUS.

This is a delicious alternative to grilling a pork tenderloin!  I also added 1 Tbsp. of liquid smoke to the liquid and it really enhanced the flavor.  The meat turned out so tender and the aujus is delicious as well which is good served over rice.  This is definately a keeper for me.

This is a good recipe, however, it came out tasting VERY salty.  If you like overly salty tasting meat, then this is perfect for you.  I didn't use a crock pot, I just cooked it very slow on the stove in a pot for the same amount of time.  Perhaps axe the soy sauce...

I think this is one of my favourite recipes from this site so far.  I took the advice of another reviewer and added sauteed onion and mushrooms in the last hour of cooking and that was great.  I also only added 2T soy sauce since I was worried it would be too salty and I thought it was perfect that way.  I'll put this in the recipe box and make it often!  Thanks!

I really disliked this recipe.  I would not make it again. But to those who do, I would leave out the red wine.  It really can give an off-putting taste to the dish.  

The tenderness of the pork was perfect however.  We will use leftovers for bbq pork sandwiches.

I made this for my daughter and son-in laws party of 50+ people to renew their wedding vows. It was a huge hit. Even my extremely picky grandsons liked it. I used marsala wine and a little less garlic. I cooked it in my large electric roaster on low for about 5-6 hours.

My husband said this was the best pork of any kind that he's ever had.  We absolutely loved it!  And it was SO easy.  I threw all the ingredients together in just a few minutes, cooked on low for 6 hours and it was wonderful.  The meat just fell apart.  I served it with veges and mashed potatoes.  The only thing I changed was adding 1 Tbls of Worcestershire.

This was excellent. I made it as written except I added some chopped leeks since I had some and it sounded good. You can really taste the wine in this, so make sure you buy a wine you really like. I used a merlot.

Only change I made was I reduced the soy sauce to 1 1/2 Tablespoons. I liked it better the next day. The gravy was fantastic.

I marinated it overnight and reduced soy sauce due to reviews that said it was too salty.  THe meat was so tender and moist.  We loved it.

Extremely easy to make!  I never thought you could actually make pork that was juicy!  I omit the soy sauce though.  The dry soup mix is very salty and the added soy sauce was just too much.  My kids love this!

This truley is amazing. My husband is hard to please and he loved it. The simple-ness of it has won me over. I had a smaller tenderloin and it still was fantastic and I didn't have onion soup mix so I used a cup of chicken stock instead of the soup mix and water. I bet it would be even better with the soup mix. Out of this world - definately a keeper.

This had a good flavor.  Only used half the onion soup in an effort to reduce the sodium. If I made it again, I would sear it before putting it in the slow cooker.

This Pork Roast lived up to it's name!  I cooked it longer than the recipe called for, and at the end, I thickened the sauce with a little flour.  It was a little salty, for my tastes but the flavor was great, and very easy to prepare!  I will make this again.

It's hard to believe that ANYTHING this easy could be so-o-o-o-o good.  I followed directions exactly and it was delcious--melt in your mouth delicious. The flavors are subtle but wonderful--I will make again and again!! Even my picky 2 and 6 years olds ate it. One last thing--it made my home smell decicious. note-I used Pinot Noir wine and it turned out excellent.

This recipe is easy and the result is excellent!  The ONLY change I made, after reading other reviews, was a change to use 1 1/2 T. "lite" soy sauce and 1 1/2 T. worcestershire sauce, rather than using the 3 T. soy sauce called for.  Everyone loved the pork, and the reheated result of leftovers was also very good.

Very easy! I didn't have wine on hand, so I used chicken broth.  It was well received. Don't leave it in past the 4 hours, though, or it will get tough.

MELT-IN-YOUR-MOUTH DELICIOUS!!!  I made this for company and everyone savored each bite!  The soy sauce ingredient did throw me off too, but I included everything the recipe said, and to measure.  The au jus was wonderful!  It went perfect with mashed potatoes, veggies.  Will DEFINITELY make this again!!

I did a variation of this because I had two pieces of pork tenderloin in the freezer I wanted to use.  These had been packaged with a "Dale's Seasoning" marinade, so I opted not to use the onion soup and in place of the wine I used an 8 oz. carton of beef STOCK (not broth).  This is absolutely incredible and gives me inspiration to try other seasonings/flavors for pork tenderloin in the slow cooker.  This tenderloin literally melts in your mouth and the au jus is wonderful.  Thanks!

Excellent but used light soy sauce which is less salty.  My whole family loved this - very tender pork and the au jus is tasty.  I would be careful not to overcook this one because i think it would affect the flavor.  Very easy - definitely a keeper.

I followed the instructions exactly and it was really quite delicious and very simple to make.  also we didn't think it was too salty.  I used some corn starch to thicken the sauce some on the stove top afterwards and served it with mashed potatoes and veggies.  Will definitely be making this again.

Delicious!  I was worried it would come out tender, but it literally melts in your mouth.  I added 2 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce along with the other ingredients.  The flavours are incredible!   YUMMMMY!!

Absolutely delicious. I served it on a bed of mashed potatoes and covered it with the au jus. My family loved it. I almost passed up this recipe because I tend to pay too much attention to the rating and why cook a 4 star when you can cook a 5? Well thank goodness I actually read them. Some of the bad reviews were because the cut of meat used was too high quality. Others were from people who didn't even make the recipe based on their theories of how it would turn out and others were from people who didn't actually follow the recipe. People like this really hurt the rating system. If you actually follow this recipe, you will not be disappointed. It is absolutely incredible. If you want to modify it, that is your choice, but please for the sake of the review system, don't rate it. Because, you won't actually be rating the recipe and you will give people a false impression of the actual recipe.

Love this recipe. I give this 5 stars exactly as written.

Note - I sometimes use Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce, but my rating is based solely on the recipe as written.

I think it would be better with loin instead of actual tenderloin. We had a cut of tenderloin that turned so dark that I thought it was beef for a moment. I look forward to trying it with a regular loin cut.

I made this exactly as instructed and it was WAY overcooked and tough when I pulled it out of crock pot. I will try this again for a much shorter cooking time, probably in oven. The sauce was delicious as promised.

Easy and delicious.  Used low sodium soy sauce and did not add any extra salt.  I also cut down on the salt in my mashed potato side dish because I served the au jus on the side.

This recipe was good, but not mind blowing. I might make it again because it was very easy and quick to put together, but if I had more time, I’d probably try another recipe before I’d make this again.

Delicious flavor and meat is so tender.  Must trim all fat if you wish to use the juice as au jus.  Second time I made it, I halved the water for a stronger flavor and preferred it that way.  Awesome recipe.

This was WAY too sweet. Add cornstarch to make it more of a gravy, but we will be looking for a new savory recipe as this was just way too sweet.

Needed some type of gravy with it since au jus was mostly minced garlic. Overall pretty good taste and cooked with pork shoulder rather than tenderloin.

What a terrible thing to do to a pork tenderloin.  The meat is already low fat.  Cooking it for four hours in liquid renders the meat tasteless and seemingly dry.  The juice is good, but the meat is ruined.

I made this dinner for 2 and cut ingredients and cook time in half since it’s just me and my fiancé. I added garlic powder as someone suggested and it was fantastic. My only issue is that the pork was too dry, so next time I’ll do 1.5 hours. At 2 hours my pork was well over 160 degrees Fahrenheit, which for me 150 is the perfect heat.

I made with a 2 1/2 pound roast. Didn't have any wine on hand, so left that out. My crockpot required cooking time of 5.25 hours. I also made a gravy with some of the sauce. Heated in saucepan over medium heat, beat 2 TBL flour in enough milk to dissolve all clumps, added to removed sauce. Served gravy over pork loin, mashed potatoes and served with green beans. Hubby loved it.

This was great, but a little tart.  Use any kind of pork, even boneless country ribs, but add a little honey unless you like it real acidy. Someone mentioned that onion soup mix contains MSG - they have eliminated this in the mix, thankfully. My kids are allergic to MSG so I have to read all labels and Liptons onion soup mix doesn't have it any more.

Moist, tender, and great flavor! I cooked mine just a bit longer than called for, about 5 hours instead of 4, and I substituted cranberry juice for the red wine.

I used a pork loin roast that I had in the freezer for too long. I thought it was a bit dry, but could well have been starting freezer burn on the meat..  The gravy had very good flavor. My husband doesn't generally volunteer comments either way on food, but I asked and he said "I think it tastes pretty good"; which means "it's OK with me to make it again". Next time I'll use a pork tenderloin and follow the cook time.

Used white grape juice instead of the wine. It turn out awesome. All my husband did was add more pepper.  He usually adds all kinds of other spices but he didn't with this recipe.

First off, I didn't have red wine so I didn't put it in.  But without it this recipe was top notch.  Pork Tenderloin in a slow cooker is great, no matter if you are an accomplished cook or an inexperienced one.  The onion soup mix doesn't overpower this recipe (which I served with a wild rice/pasta mixture) and neither does the garlic.  This will be another slow cooker recipe for pork tenderloin which I will make again.

I read many of the reviews that did not use the onion dip packet. I used a regular onion and added extra seasoning. Not sure what happened but I won't make it again. I agree that the tenderloin is not the right cut of meat for this. It was too "mealy". My family enjoyed it but I didn't.

Very tasty!
I pretty much followed the recipe but omitted the red wine. I didn't have any. I added some chicken broth and included fresh onions in the crock pot. Turned out very well. Had it for lunch and dinner for several nights.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful!  Responding to the review from the 'experienced chef' who felt foolish after making this with a more expensive cut of meat.  I too am an experienced chef and have found that there are some wonderful slow cooker recipes out there.  This is one!  Pork tenderloin can easily be overcooked on a grill or in the oven and get dried out because it is so lean.  The outcome of my pork with this recipe was very tender and juicy.  Flavors were great and I loved the minced garlic on the top.  One change out of necessity - I didn't have dry onion soup mix but did have a can of Campbell's condensed french onion soup.  Used this with about 1/2 of the water called for in the recipe.  Otherwise made this as is with the exception of searing the meat on all sides before putting in the slow cooker; I ALWAYS do this.  Thanks for a great recipe that I will make again.  My husband loved it too!

Agree  that it wasn't amazing, and the pork turned out relatively tough and overcooked. Not impressed - it tasted fine, but I wanted more taste-splosions...

This has to be one of the worst recipes I have ever made from this site - and I have been a member for over 20 years.  I followed it as written, except for the black pepper.  My husband thought it was very bland.  I am surprised that it received so many good reviews.

Yes ... and only because i am so stuborn and have to try things for myself even though lizzitish said exactly how it is. It was close to ineddible!
When i use crockpot i expect to put thing in and come home 8 hours later , from work to have dinner.
This dinner was very expensive piece of bark! Never again!
It totaly makes sense - it is lean piece of meat and when you think of it logicaly - it can not stand being warm for 8 hours! Not even on low, not even with switching to warm after reaching 150F.... 


so in conclusion : if you want best out of your meat - get sousvide! keep slowcooker for spaghetti sauce, stuffed peppers, cabage rolls and soup.

Negative stars if I could. 

Use pork butt/shoulder for this recipe and it will turn out great!

Follow the instructions to waste your money and pork tenderloin.

Pork tenderloin has very low fat and connective tissue, just like beef tenderloin. Would you also recommend cooking filet mignon in a slow cooker?

I was expecting this recipe to be over the top.  Not.  I purchased the wine, made the recipe exactly as specified.  It had way too much liquid.  Would have been better with less water and/or more wine.  I used an entire bulb of garlic since that's very popular at our house.  The meat was moist, but the flavor was truly nothing special.

This recipe makes the pork tenderloin so moist!  I couldn't find any 2 pounders, so I bought a 4 pounder, doubled the sauce. Then cooked it on high for the first 2 hours, and low for the last two.  It turned out perfect!

This is a keeper!! I used a pork loin (5 lb.) rather than a pork tenderloin. I seasoned it with garlic powder, onion powder, pepper and beau monde seasoning. Cut it in half and seared it on all sides in avocado oil. Took it out of the pan and let it rest for about 10 minuets. I followed the basic recipe except for the following... I used chicken stock instead of water, used 1/2 packet onion soup mix, added fresh diced onions and mushrooms, a little extra soy sauce and added some   worcestershire sauce, all to my tastes. Then I thought, why not? I added about 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar over the top. Added rosemary, thyme and sage and put the crock pot on high for 5.5 hours. Oh my goodness!!! The aroma in my house was fantastic! The pork was so tender and the flavor was to die for. I thickened the juice with cornstarch and water to make a gravy and ladled that over the sliced pork and served it with roasted baby red potatoes and asparagus. It just melts in your mouth. My husband said we should have this once a week lol! He loved it and I was amazed by the flavor.

Made this last night and it had rave reviews from everyone.  I did not use the onion soup mix and made my own to eliminate all the sodium.  I did use the pork tenderloin and it was very tender.  The gravy gave it an extra kick.  This is a keeper.

Simple and delicious.  After reading other reviews warning of high sodium content I substituted one thinly sliced onion for the onion soup mix. I rubbed the roast with a teaspoon each of garlic powder and salt free seasoning (Mural of Flavor) from Penzeys.  I poured the soy sauce and wine over it all.  (Skipped the water.) Cooked on low for six hours. I served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli.

This was amazing!  I used a 2 lb pork loin roast, and when cutting it, the roast was so tender that it was just falling apart after 6 hours on low in the crock pot!  The sauce made a wonderful tasty au jus for the pork, and I still had plenty to take out and make gravy with after adding some milk and corn starch (which was heavenly over the mashed potatoes I made as a side).  My only issue is that this was pretty high in sodium, even when using regular wine (not cooking wine).  I normally never complain about dishes being too salty because I like my food to be flavorful, but this was such a sodium bomb that I had a headache after dinner!  I used Lipton Onion Soup Mix, but next time I make it, I'll use a lower sodium MSG-free alternative such as Simply Organic French Onion Dip Mix instead and possibly switch to Worcestershire sauce instead of soy.  But this recipe is a keeper for sure!

Sorry, just not to our taste.  Felt like a waste of a good tenderloin. Of course it is a tender cut of meat to begin with and 4 hours was just too long in the slow cooker.  Fell apart and had to use a spoon to get it out.  Followed the recipe and left the house for an afternoon meeting. Four  hours later it was way past the slicing stage.  Flavor was OK on first bite, but had an underlying bitterness. Also, very salty.   Won't be making this again.

I used this recipe for a pork shoulder roast.  I only had white wine on hand, and used that and cooked it all day on high.  It literally fell off of the bone and was juicy and delicious.  I had enough left over for carnitas tacos the next day.  Terrific.

Have never attempted pork tenderloin, I always thought it was too hard and fancy for me to make. I've been trying to make new things and broaden my horizons. I tried out this recipe and was not disappointed. I over did it so it was more like pulled pork because I left it in the crock pot too long; but the family liked it and the flavor was great! Will defiantly make again.

Way too salty!  Will try it again but will cut the onion soup mix in half and use sodium-reduced soy sauce.  Flavor would have been good except for the salt.

Made it x2. Was good the first time but too salty. Used only half of the onion soup mix and 1 tbsp. soy sauce. Left the wine as is. For the water , I used half apple cider and half water. Instead of au jus, I strained and thickened it, as a gravy. Had the same people over and they liked it better this way.  Great slow cook recipe.

Loved this recipe except for the amount of soy.   Too much for my family's taste.   Cut back.  Other wise, very good.

I was so disappointed.  After having read all the great reviews, I was excited about trying it.  Several of the reviewers mentioned that it was better to use regular pork loin instead of tenderloin, so I took their advice.  Big mistake.  It was too tough to eat.  Also, it had way too much garlic and didn't even smell good as it was cooking.  What a waste of good meat.  I probably will never make this again, but if I do, I will not use the garlic at all, and I will use the tenderloin as the original recipe called for.

Flavour was ok. The red wine/soya sauce combo is kind of weird. I used pork loin (not pork tenderloin). Was tender enough, i guess, but very dry. I followed others' advice about reducing the soy sauce to make it less salty. I used 2 tbls instead of 3 and upped the water a bit. Was just right and not too salty. My husband said it was wayyyyy to garlicky though.

I have made this recipe several times with good reception each time. Based on other reviews complaining of high sodium, I used low sodium soy sauce. Additionally, I add celery powder, fresh rosemary, a dash of red pepper flakes, fresh onions, and Worcestershire. I also substitute the water with chicken broth (no sodium). My favorite wine to use is a merlot. Four hours on high has yielded good results for me. Finally, I always use a pork loin, since  pork tenderloin is a nicer cut of meat that does well in the oven.

I followed the recipe and maybe did a little bit more this or that with the seasonings as I am not one to measure but tomorrow I make it for at least the 10th time and when looking up the saved recipe saw that someone called it mediocre. This is anything but mediocre. If it is a first time just follow it and then get a bit creative. It is amazing. And I am always a student but in many circles considered one heck of a cook especially when I can dig into something a bit more gourmet or exotic. I rarely if ever review but in this case could not help but defend one of the best slow cooker recipes I've ever run across. Bon appetite!

I followed the directions exactly and found the pork to be very tender and flavorful.  I did put some slits in the top of the pork roast and pushed some of the garlic in to permeate the meat.  My fiance loved this and went back for seconds and thirds.

This is absolutly delicious! I made it just as the recipe says, and loved it! I did make a gravy instead, and it was to die for. I was worried as other reviews mentioned not using a tenderloin in the show cooker, but it was excellent! I will be making this for Thanksgiving this year instead of turkey!

Extremely  easy to make and very  moist. Even my 17 mo. Old grandson liked it. But what really pleased me was that my picky eater also praised it. Served it with garlic mashed potatoes  first night and had enough  for leftovers  with Spanish rice and  beans!

Skip it.  I followed the directions exactly and it was way too salty (I like salt).  The onion soup mix totally overpowered it and gave it a odd processed flavor.  I strained the juice and added water and cornstarch to make gravy.  It did not taste great so I added Rosemary which helped but will not save it.  I will serve it over mashed potatoes in an attempt not to ware it but with So many great pork recipes do something else.

I also added some crushed red pepper and some Goya adobo seasoning. Next time I will decrease the water by 1/4cup. I found that there was too much liquid at the end, but otherwise I thought it was pretty good.

I was hesitant initially based on the reviews and hated the idea of putting a tenderloin in a crockpot.  But the tenderloin was on sale cheap so gave it a shot and I couldn't be happier I did.  I added some sliced baby bella mushrooms and extra wine (merlot) and water to get near the top of the pork and let it cook at low for 4 hours.  Incredible taste and simplicity.  Even as leftovers the pork remained fork tender.  Definitely will be making it again and trying with a less tender cut of pork.  Can't wait!

This was fine.  We did enjoy it, and it was easy.  It was not special tho and I probably won't make it again unless my boyfriend requests it (he seemed to like it more than I did).  My pork was done after 3 hours.  The au jus was very salty on its own but was pleasant over the pork.  Nothing wrong with this recipe, but lacking a wow factor.

Amazing and super easy recipe! I followed the advice by others and cooked it on HIGH for 4 hours - came out as juicy and melt in your mouth pulled pork! Served it with puréed cauliflower with goat cheese and steamed veggies. Than had enough for pulled pork sandwiches the next day! Family raved, ate it up and asked for seconds.

I'm a solo cook and I use  'cook' loosely.  The smallest tenderloin was 2.6 lbs. so I cut it in thirds and adjusted the recipe accordingly.  But.... I cooked it in the crockpot for the recommended 4 hours and it was fantastic especially the sauce which I used liberally.  Because of the size of the loin I had it for two meals. By the way I have never cooked any kind of roast before this.

The overall flavor is good but, four hours is too long for a tenderloin.  The meat was a bit dry even though I topped it with the au jus as suggested.  If I try this again, I will drop the time to three hours at low.

This is the best pork roast recipe I've ever tried.  I am not a huge crockpot fan for meat but this is really good.  I sometimes thicken the broth and make gravy.  Very yummy and super simple. Today I will make it in my Instant Pot!

I haven't heard my husband rave about a recipe as much as he did tonight! He LOVED it (I'm a vegetarian so I didn't try it). I used a 1.3 lb. tenderloin and cooked it on low for 3.75 hours. He said it wasn't dry at all. I followed the recipe to exactly as stated. Great recipe! So easy for a hot summer night!

Loved it. Used Vegeta and Aji-Mirin for onion soup and wine, respectively. So simple and FANTASTIC.

Don't know how one could mess up a slow cooker recipe but by reading some of these reviews it seems many have. Not too salty, and four hours in the slow cooker seems like plenty for a pork tenderloin of this size.

Because I only had a half pack of onion soup mix available, I took someone else's suggestion of adding fresh onion, garlic powder and herbs.  Awesome!

I've made this dish about 3 times now. Each time it's been awesome. I served it for a dinner party, it was a hit. I have learned cooking the pork on low heat is key to a much more tender meat. Last time I used the left over pork bits and sauce to create a kale soup.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it's pretty good.  The beauty of this recipe is it's convenience.  Afternoons/evenings can be a time-crunch for me with my 3 busy kids, and on those nights, my crockpot is my best friend.  I admit I prefer tenderloin marinaded (or dry-rubbed) and roasted, but the flavors here are nice and the house smells awesome when you get home!  It really couldn't get any simpler and I will be making it again.

Doubled everything except for the dry onion soup mix, to reduce the sodium, and it was still tasty! Easy one to place in the slow cooker in the morning and forget until dinner.

Lovely dish; the red wine really adds to the flavors.  I decided to follow some of the advice and used fresh slivered onions instead of the onion soup and also decreased the soy sauce initially.  I think that change was a bit too drastic and added more soy at the end.  With some recipes, there isn't enough au jus at the end, but this one I'd think would be adequate.  I had some pork that we had butchered, and so a 2lb bag ended up being less than a 1lb after I finished trimming the meat.  I kept the liquids amount the same and ended up with more than enough au jus to turn into gravy.  (3.5 hrs on low was adequate for the decreased amount of meat...maybe even 3 hrs).  Also, I added fresh rosemary at the beginning of the cooking time.  I read that woody herbs like rosemary, sage, and thyme hold up very well in the slow cooker.  We all liked the flavor that it imparted.  Thank you for a simple yet delicious dish!

I used a pork loin roast - much less expensive - wonderfully flavored and tender. I skipped the searing of the roast.  I placed all of the ingredients in the crockpot and cooked it on low while I was at work.  Pork fell apart when I tried to take it out of the pot.  Paired this with the Gourmet Mushroom Risotto from this site and peas.  Great dinner.

It turned out very dry and the au jus had little flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I threw in 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms before putting the meat in.  For a cut of meat that is already very lean, I think it needs a longer cooking time - not shorter

We make this mostly as is (with the exception of using a pork loin rather than a tenderloin) and we love it.  I tried some of the variations in the reviews and like the original best.  Once I didn't have any wine on hand (shocker in my house) and used cooking wine instead.  It was SO salty we threw it out.  A big key is to use real red wine (we've found Merlot to be a winner) and not cooking wine to avoid salt overload.  The extra au jus is awesome.  We thicken some up and have it with mashed potatoes.

Delicious! We followed the recipe exactly and the pork just fell apart. Served it with mashed potatoes and carrots, used the sauce from the slow cooker as a gravy. We're going to try it with rice next time. The meat on its own was flavorful. My fiance thought it was a bit too salty, so in the future we might use less soy sauce, but overall a great recipe that we will use in the future. Thanks! EDIT: Been a few months, we've made this numerous times, still sooo delicious! And wine to drink on the side! Definitely recommend using half the amount of soy sauce to reduce salty-ness. It really made the dish perfect for our taste buds! We serve the meat with a side of white rice, pouring the juices from the slow cooker over the meat/rice to soak up - best side dish we've tried so far. Sometimes add broccoli, too. My recommendations!

This is my husband's FAVORITE! I have made it several times as written and also with modifications always comes out excellent  I like to add garlic slivers into the tenderloin (use almost an entire head of garlic).  I also use low sodium soy sauce or cut down a bit on the amount of soy sauce.  I always use dry red wine like a cabernet or chianti. I do add some corn starch at the end just to thicken the gravy a bit. Serve with mashed potatoes and green beans.

The other changes I make--our family preferences--I like to add "fresh" herbs like thyme and rosemary. I also at the end add sauteed mushrooms to the gravy.

Again, this is my husbands favorite recioe from this site!

This was an amazing hit!!!! My son and husband drooled, my son wants the recipe. I have never had a moist, juicy pork in crockpot as good as this. I did do a couple things different. I put small red potatoes in and cooked it about 15 minutes longer, I also on the side of the the roast added a jar of heinz gravy as I was worried there would not be enough gravy. While the pork rested I put all the drippings in a pan and used 3 tbl cornstarch to thicken and it was fantastic. Also as it did say I used Merlot!!! Big, Big hit!!!!

I used a pork loin (not tenderloin) and added worcershire sauce as recommended in other reviews.  The pork was tender as promised but I don't think I love the red wine in the sauce (and I drink red wine and love it). I am trying to eat healthier but I think for pork I will stick to the sweeter preps... apple/maple/brown sugar.

Not great but it has potential.  The garlic was too much.  But the au jus was good.  The next time I try this one, I will take out the garlic and put in a couple of fresh slices of onion.  Then I will use real red wine (I used red cooking wine).

My mom made this for New Year's Day 2015 and it was incredibly delicious. She doubled the recipe, and we loved it so much, we've been having it for dinner every night since...and I don't usually like pork at all. She used my "lucky" wine: BV Coastal Cabernet and reduced sodium soy sauce. The "juice/sauce" is amazing spooned over the pork and mashed potatoes. She cooked it a little longer, possibly 5 hours, then turned off crock pot and left it in there another hour because we were engrossed in a football game. The pork came out so tender it can be cut with only a fork. Served with mashed potatoes, black eyed peas, and green beans. My favorite New Year's day meal yet!!

This was good. I used a pork rib eye roast instead of tenderloin. I put a dry rub on the roast including rosemary garlic and herb spice and salt and pepper. I mixed remaining ingredients together and put it over roast. I cooked on low about 5 hours. Turned out very moist and fell right apart.

Made this in a pinch, and it turned out great! I didn't have onion soup mix, so I chopped 1/2 yellow onion and 2 cups of beef broth. I also put the pork loin in frozen, cooked on High for 1.5 hrs, and then turned down to Low for 4 hours.

I'm on the fence with this recipe. It was the first time cooking a tenderloin in the slow cooker and the meat was tender and tasty. This was a huge hit with my son, but the sauce was too salty for my taste.

I added fresh garlic, onion, rosemary and some potatoes to add some more flavor. The meat was tender and good a long as you avoided the potatoes, onions, and sauce. The taste was just off.

Made this last night with a 3 lb Pork Tenderloin and a very large iron skillet.  Used dried herbs because that's what I had.    I brined the pork loin for about 4 hours ahead.  Used a meat thermometer and took it to 144.  Perfect.  Highly recommend this recipe.  Will make this again.  Once I had it in the oven that was it.  I made 7-up biscuits from scratch and called it a meal. Husband loved it.

This was the most tender and moist pork tenderloin ever!  Not wanting food too salty, I used only a half packet of dry onion soup and lite soy sauce.  I would recommend no more than 1 T. of garlic (or less) even though I like garlic.  I thickened the juice and made gravy.  Everyone loved it!

AMAZING! We loved it...definitely going to be part of our regular meal plans.  I did add some cornstarch at the end as suggested in a previous comment and I used pinot noir for the red wine. It is what I usually have on hand.

Wow, great recipe. Easy to prepare. Simple ingredients. I have to admit that I changed the contents just a bit: added a full cup of cooking wine, also put in some thick sliced ginger, a spoon full of brown sugar, then threw in some cilantro that I found in the fridge. After about 4 hours, maybe a little more, sliced up the pork, covered it with the juice, and served it with some fresh baked garlic bread to soak up that glorious juice.

I made this exactly as written --  I gave it a 4, and not a 5, because the au jus left over at the end was not to our liking; it was a bit thin, and a little too wine-flavored.
I turned it into a gravy, and with this extra thickening, the flavor of the wine was toned down deliciously.

My company all said this was the best pork tenderloin they have had. It was so moist and flavorful even after I messed up my timing an had to leave it sit in the turned off slow cooker for an extra 30 minutes. This will be in permanent rotation at my house.

I Made this last night exactly how its says and yes it was very tender....However that is the only positive thing I have to say about this dinner. I used 50% of the garlic they used and all we could taste was overwhelming garlic.

This is the 1st negative review I've ever given. Based upon all the wonderful reviews, I bought an expensive pork tenderloin. The reviews also said it was to salty with the soy sauce so I left it out. We were very disappointed at the results. If I had used some oregano and basil, it probably would have been more tasty, but there wasn't much taste to it.

This was absolutely delicious! Even my 18 month old toddler ate it up! I took one reviewers advice and added worcestershire about two hours in. Then, thickened the juice once all the meat was removed with organic wheat flour. We devoured it and it was the perfect amount of cook time!

I made this for a group at church and all got many comments and questions on "the recipe". I will make it again. There was nothing left from a almost 3 pound Smithfield port loin roast. And this was at a pot luck where there was lots of food choices.

Too salty and I used lower sodium soy sauce.  The 2 1/2 pound roast was tough and dry after 5 hours on low setting.  So I shredded the meat, continued cooking it overnight on low.  Then added a bottle of barbecue sauce to make it edible because I hate wasting food.

This was delicious! I didn't have the wine it called for, so used a red sweet wine and only 1 TBS lite soy sauce. I also put slivers of fresh garlic inside the meat plus minced on top.  Will be making this again.

Easy to prepare. I followed the recipe for the most part, I just added extra minced garlic and garlic juice along with garlic powder (we are garlic lovers) and onion powder. Cooked on low for 4 hours and it was tender as can be. The salt content was high, however it did not taste overly salty. I think the garlic cut down on the salt taste greatly. Will definitely do again!

I made this twice and it turned out wonderful.  I got lots of complements on it.  The meat was so tender that it was hard to pick up.  I definitely will use this recipe again and I gave the recipe to my family to use too.

I tried this recipe tonight. I thought it was pretty good but my family didn't like it. There is way to much garlic in the recipe. I didn't even use the full amount quoted and it was too much. If you make this recipe I would probably only use half of the amount of garlic the recipe calls for!  The au jus sauce was really good over the mashed potatoes.

This was wonderful! Even my kiddos ate it! I did double the liquids and substituted beef broth for the wine as I did not have any on hand! Will definitely have this meal again.

I made this last week and it turned out very nicely.  The only thing was I thought it was a bit heavy on the garlic.  I'll make it again but use only half as much garlic next time.

If you're checking out the reviews before fixing this dish, check out the Most Helpful Positive review. Miami Mama offers great tips. Other than that, this recipe worked great for us. After taking the tenderloin out, I added some cornstarch for a thicker gravy to pour over the meat. Delicious!

This recipe was pretty good. It gave my tomngue a different venue, as far as pork loin goes. I only had about 4 pork loin that weighed n about 1.69lbs so I adjusted some of my ingredients. I pre-seasoned them first, I only used 1 1/2 tbsp of both the minced garlic and the soy sauce. As well as just a lil under the recommended amt of soy sauce suggested. In total I let mines marinate for 4 1/2 hrs and during the last half hour, I added 2 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken up the Au jus!! It was great! My bf enjoyed it. Thank you

This was OK. I personally did not like the soy sauce in it, though my husband did. Next time I may try worcestire or just leave the soy sauce out. I did not have any red wine on hand and ended up using beef broth, which was just fine. I also didn't plan ahead to only cook for four hours. It was in crock pot all day... so we shredded and made sandwiches out of it... which were good. Just the soy sauce tasted out of place to me

This recipe was very disappointing.  I would not make it again.  The only plus was being able to fix the pork roast in the crock pot. I followed the directions, only cooked for 4 hours.  I did set the slow cooker on high because of some reviews I read.  I guess that was a mistake.  The roast came out like shredded pork, not a good piece of loin roast.  I shredded the leftovers and put my homemade BBQ sauce on it so the boys can have sandwiches later in the week.

Easy recipe and nice, tender pork.  Unfortunately the onion soup packet ruined it.  It tasted salty, cheap and processed.  I will make this again but use a different marinade.

The jus is delicious. The pork was very tender. The combination together didn't do anything for our family. We didn't like the flavour of the pork. We won't be making this again.

This was fabulous! Even though my boyfriend messed up the garlic, he's very special but he at least tried, even without the garlic it was delicious and moist and the au jus was delicious! We took the leftovers and sliced them thinly, laid them on a sliced baguette and broiled it with some cheese over it to make sandwiches and dipped them in the leftover au jus. So we got two great meals out of it!

Excellent recipe and extremely quick and easy to make.  Would go great with an apple and fennel salad.  Also mixed up some spicy mustard and a little mayo which was a great accompaniment.  For leftovers, I took the au jus, put into a skillet and concentrated it down a bit.  Should make a fantastic lunch for work.

I made this - I did not have onion soup mix so I subbed with another reco - rubbed the pork with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. Instead of red wine, used cranberry juice with a shot of red wine vinegar & sugar. It was a great idea!

This was pretty good. Used pork sirloin roast (half the price of pork tenderloin) Left out soy sauce based on other reviews. Husband and I agreed the wine flavor was a little strong. And the dry onion soup mix was a little artificial tasting. Next time we will use real broth (vegetable or chicken) and add a real chopped onion and crushed garlic to the broth. Recommend flipping roast at least once so flavorful juices get into entire thing.

I followed this recipe exactly and was really looking forward to having it for dinner, however, after having it I was going to give this a 1 but my husband thought it was a 5! I really thought there was too much wine and I simply didn't care for the taste-and I love to cook with wine. I'm not that picky-I love garlic and love red wine. It may have been the type of wine-I used a good cabernet and it this beautiful tenderloin turned a little purple during the cooking process!

I gave it 4 star because how easy it is to prepare,it tastes good but I think it needs more seasoning,it's still good don't take me wrong and the gravy was a little runny but it can be thickened with cornstarch.

I just made this. The family really, really liked it. I mean really!My only changes were to flour, salt & pepper four 1+ lb. tenderloins and then brown them. I deglazed the pan and used 2 cans of beef broth, omitting the water. I used two packets of onion soup mix and also added 1 lb. of fresh mushrooms after lightly sautéing them to get out the excess water. I did stick with just 3/4 cup of wine. After cooking I removed the meat and added considerable flour while the slow cooker was on high. I thickened it to the most delicious gravy I've ever made. This is an absolute keeper! Thanks for posting!

This was *very* just okay. Not terrific flavor--tasted kind of coffee-y to me (I think that was the onion soup). Ended up chopping it up and freezing--hopefully will remember to use for tacos or enchiladas!

I made this tonight and it turned out perfectly.  Very delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated but used a low sodium onion soup mix.  This was perfect.  Not too salty at all.  I will definitely do this again.

It was delicious, however, I changed it up just a bit. I used apple juice in place of the red wine, and I added a packet of dry brown gravy mix and some worchestershire sauce.

I used a pork loin roast-turned out delicious! I would use half the soy sauce next time, though, and add a dash or two of worcestershire.

Was delicious! Cooked the pork loin in the crock pot on low for almost 8 hours and made the drippings into a gravy by whisking in a little flour. Did follow the recipe except only added a tablespoon of the soy sauce rather than the full amount. The pork was really good but thought the drippings was still kinda salty. Will definitely be making again!

it would have been good if it wasn't so salty.  I would greatly reduce the onion mix next time.

I used 1.5 lbs boneless pork loin and a Spanish Cabernet. Pretty decent; one of the best slow cooker meals I have made. It was pretty salty; maybe next time I will try low sodium soy sauce. I served it with steamed fresh green beans, and buttered rolls. Soaking up the au jus with the bread was delicious, too.

I made this today for dinner. First it made my house smell soooooooooo good.  I kept the pork in the crock pot for 3 1/2 hrs.  Went to slice the pork it's so tender it fell apart.  So yummy.  I added all the ingredients - used fresh garlic gloves (3) of them.  Just perfect dish.  Served with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Rated 10 stars.....  My family loved it....

The best part of this recipe is that is appears to be a meal that you have worked hard on. In reality, it's one of the easiest meals that I've made.  Serve it with some mashed potatoes and asparagus, and it appears to be a very fancy meal.  Very tasty and flavorful.

I was really skeptical when I first saw that the recipe called for the meat to be cooked for only 4 hours on a LOW setting, especially since normally meat needs to be cooked for around 8 hours on low, but I decided to give it a try anyway. I can definitely confirm that 4 hours on LOW is completely fine.

I couldn't find any dry onion soup mix, so instead I used 1 brown onion, thinly sliced. The red wine I used was the cheapest I could find (the meal still turned out great so don't worry about using your most expensive bottles) and cost about 10 dollars.

With the juices from the cooking, I added a few gravy granules and made an incredibly rich gravy. Delicious!

I thought it was a very good recipe.  The only changes: I seared the loin before adding it to the crock pot,  and I used about 1/2 of the salt mixture in the dry soup mix, and used all of the dried onion.

Maybe I did something wrong although I followed the recipe exactly. The pork was dry and the taste of soy sauce was overwhelming. This is only the third recipe I've made in a slow cooker. The first two, Beef Stew and Pork Loin with Sauerkraut and Polish Sausage both were fantastic.  This recipe was very disappointing. Sorry.

I have made a very similar dish to this recipe, although i always feel like something is missing, aside from what is required above and what little i add as seasoning for the pork. it is a big hit at the dinner table by all guests. Especially my dad, who does not do red wine when cooking. He is the best cook ever!!!

Very delicious meal served with brown rice and salad. I didn't have any opened red wine and used 3/4 cup sake that was in the fridge and that was perfect.

My husband raved about this recipe. I used a little less red wine (Cabernet Sauv.) and a little more water than the recipe called for. I don't know much about wine; in fact, I only bought some to use in this recipe. As I was adding it, it smelled like it might come out too wine-y, so I diluted it with water. As it was cooking, I thought it might have a strong Asian flavor due to the soy sauce, but it didn't. My tenderloin was only 1.25 pounds, so 4 hours was too long to cook it. It was a little dry, but that was my fault for not taking it out sooner. I thickened the sauce with cornstarch and it was good.

This was awesome!  Everyone that tasted it LOVED it!  I used a Pork center Loin and it was so juicy.  I followed the directions exactly with the exception of the cooking temp and time.  I cooked on High for 3 1/2 hrs. Then reduced to low for 45 min.  It was perfect.  Tonight we had sandwiches on sour dough toast with the couple of leftover pieces..  YUMMMMMY

My boyfriend just loved this recipe.  I didn't have onion soup mix, so I used a mushroom gravy mix and added potatoes, onions, carrots, fresh mushrooms, and some red pepper.  We were getting anxious as I started the crock pot late so turned the heat to high and cooked until the pork was 165 degrees.  Turned out fabulous!

Cut garlic in slivers & inserted all over pork. Everything else I did exactly the same. I thought this was ok but my husband loved it! I'm just not a huge fan of onion soup mix. Maybe I'll use fresh onions next time.

This turned out pretty well with a few modifications.  First off, I had to leave mine on low for twice the amount of time called for.  I was not able to slice my pork, as it literally fell apart upon being pierced.  It was not dry and was very very tender and flavorful.  The juice was a little strong tasting for my tastes so I added at least another cupo of water to dilute it before adding a thickener to make gravy.  This made the most awesome gravy!!  My family requested this recipe be put in the "keeper" file!  Thanks for sharing, chowsito!

I didn't have time for the slow cooker so I browned the tenderloins well in a skillet and followed the recipe for the rest. I put it in the oven at 300 for an hour then 275 for another hour and a half. Wonderful!!!

I made this recipe as written using Woodbridge Cabernet Sauvignon for my red wine. It was pretty good but the wine in the au jus was a little overpowering. I decided to separate and boil the au jus for a few minutes, then added 2 tsp of cornstarch blended with water to thicken it into a gravy. Still strong, until I added a sprinkle of sugar (yes sugar!) and some onion powder. Then the flavors seemed to blend perfectly. My husband and I loved this five star meal and served it with mashed potatoes and a broccoli vegetable medley. We will definitely make this again. Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

This recipe was AMAZING!! This was my 1st recipe I have made in a crock pot and I was just looking for something simple to make and something that calls for pork tenderloin because thats what I had in my fridge. Man was I not expecting how well it would turn out. My daughter is the pickest eater I know and only likes a handful of foods and she even asked for 2nds!! thank you so much it was a great success!! :-)

My husband and I tried this recipe yesterday and this is the very first time I have felt a need to rate a recipe.  We followed the recipe exactly and the only change we made was thickening the juice from the meat when it was done to make gravy.  Delicious.  A repeat in our house!

I very much disliked the flavor of this dish. The meat turned out tender, but I thought the soy sauce and all of the onion soup mix kind of ruined the pork.

This recipe was fantastic. The only change I made was instead of putting the garlic on top I cut small slits in the meat and place the garlic in the slits. That was they stay in place. Thanks for the recipe!

This was the first pork tenderloin I have truly Loved This recipe was responsible for having a roof erected over the BBQ deck! I bought extra pork on sale and am freezing it in the marinade. I do agree that there tends to be more marinade than necessary. 
Thank You!

Turned out great! Very tender, just fell apart.I used less of the dry onion soup mix and used 2 tablespoons of low sodium soy sauce and still found it a bit salty. It still tasted great though.I will make it again for sure.

I agree this was very good, but a little salty.  I think next time I'll try using and onion and my own seasoning instead of the soup mix because that has so much salt in it.  The red wine, soy sauce combination made an excellent gravy though.  I'll make again with modifications.

I followed the recipe instructions with only one exception. I used a generic onion soup and the I must say it was a total disaster. I should know better than to experiment with a new recipe when expecting company but the reviews were so encouraging and the recipe appeared simple enough. I had to order pizza!

Easy to prepare and absolutely delicious.  I didn't have any dried onion soup mix today, so I sautéed sliced onion and minced garlic in a little olive oil and poured it over the meat.  The house already smells wonderful and this meat is great for leftovers and sandwiches.  Oh, and a lean pork loin is much healthier than a beef roast. Thanks!!!

Amazing is correct...I followed this recipe exactly as written and it turned out totally delicious.  My family loved it.  The only thing I did was added a little corn starch to thicken the gravy but I don't think it really even needed that...very good.

This is an absolutely delicious and easy dish to make. I lowered the amount of wine by half for our family. I usually but a three pound tenderloin - same ingredients, and cut it in three pieces, and then freeze the other two for future meals. 
I did extend the cooking time by two hours, and I always set a slow cooker on high for the first hour if possible.

I only had white wine in the house, since we can't drink reds, so the flavor is surely a bit different.  Even with using the white wine substitution, this was tasty and easy.  Love those crock pot recipes!

This was pretty good.  People are saying it's too salty but I didn't think so.  I did find it to be a tinge dry though.  I think I'll cook it for less time next time I make it.  Thanks!

Pork was decent tasting, but the au jus was very pungent andhad  too much garlic.  Would not make again.

Delicious, but too salty.  Cutting back on the soy sauce next time.  I cooked it on high for 2 hours and turned it down to low for the last 2 hours.  Came out tender and juicy.

This recipe was truly awesome.  I didn't have the onion soup mix so I threw in some dried minced onion, and some Lawry's seasoning salt and it was great!

My final product was delicious, but only after doctoring up the recipe. My first taste of the sauce was way too tart. Perhaps my wine wasn't sweet enough. I added a considerable amount of sugar. I also added a gravy packet and some cornstarch to thicken. I diluted the sauce with some water, as it was a bit salty. All in all, my family loved it, when I was finished with the changes. I think the slow cooker concept is wonderful, but I would do a different sauce.

Very simple and good recipe - pork came out delicious, but a bit too much garlic for my taste. Next time, I will either use less garlic, or just add whole cloves instead of minced. Thanks!

I followed the directions exactly.  This has way too much garlic.  The pork just tasted like garlic.  The meat was very tender but the flavor was not good.

We loved this recipe! I took all juices and put in pan, heated it and added flour and brought to a boil. Then I put gravy through strainer to get a nice smooth au jus....oh the au jus was awesome! I will definitely make this one again!

Was not a favorite. Juice was overpowering and too salty even for me who loves salt. The red wine was a mistake in this recipe. Next time I'll just use chicken broth instead of water and wine.

Made this exactly as the recipe stated. Way too much garlic, it wiped out the taste of the pork. Also too salty. Would skip the soy sauce or use a low sodium sauce. The onion mix is very salty. If I made this again I would use half an envelope and add a can of cream of mushroom soup and the wine.

This was excellent--very tender!  I did not have red wine, so I used a red wine vinegar--I'm guessing that this would be really tasty with a balsamic vinegar as well.  This recipe is a keeper and perfect for days that are busy!!

I often cook pork tenderloin and this is one recipe I will repeat. Next time I will use half the soy sauce and may add a little brown sugar!

I just made this and it was good But not great. I probably will not cook it again the way I did. I used chicken stock not wine so maybe that is what screwed it up.

I gave this 3 stars because I thought that my pork tenderloin was overcooked.  I followed the directions exactly as stated. I understand that my crockpot just might cook a little faster so I might try this again but cook for just 3 hours.  The flavours were good, especially with the garlic on top of the pork tenderloin.

Simply delicious!  So easy and the flavor was spot on.  I served it with roasted squash, potatoes and carrots.  Simple and easy weeknight dinner.

I just made this and WOW!!  The fiancé loved me tonight!

Changes... Cooked in oven at 350 for an hour.  Didn't have dry onion soup mix so used a "zesty herb" seasoning packet, red pepper powder, garlic, fresh pepper, soy sauce.  Towards the end, I added mushrooms to simmer in the sauce then took the pork loin out to chop up, put the sauce remaining on the stove, added more mushrooms and a mushroom gravy packet and served over mashed potatoes!

I will def make this for guests. Yum!

Absolutely delicious.  The pork was moist and tender and very flavorful.  It also smelled great  cooking and filled my home with a great aroma.  I served the sauce over the meat.  My huband also put the sauce on his potatoes.  I will most certianlly make this again.  If you like pork you should love this dish.

This is wonderful! I made this for our Christmas dinner and it was a hit!  This was almost the same recipe that I use to make my beef slow cooked roast too.  So I knew that I had a winner!  I used beef broth and water to make a very rich Au Jus.  I was preparing myself for the task of making this into a gravy but when I tasted it, I immediately used it on the platter under and on top of the pork.  It was soooo tender and juicy.  Anyone can play with this simple recipe to make it their own too.  But you really don't have to, its delicious!

Tasty, but not to die for....and definetly NOT worth spending extra $ on a pork tenderloin.  Use boneless chops instead for a tasty, more affordable meal.  Yummy with Jasmine rice on the side.  Use reduced soy sauce, if you can.

I could repeated word for word the review by the "experienced cook."  I too found this disappointing.  I will admit that I used a brand new crockpot for the first time so that may be a contributing factor, but I suspect this would not have been wonderful even with my old crockpot.

Very good and flavorful.  The only change I made was to use about 1.5 tbsp of balsamic vinegar and 1.5 tbsp of worcestershire sauce instead of the soy sauce (didn't have any).  Was wonderful and easy and my whole family loved it.

I served with a brown rice and steamed broccoli.  Easy and healthy!

This was the BEST pork tenderloin I have ever tasted!  It was so tender even after just the 4 hours - I was skeptical. The flavor was outstanding.   I made the sauce into more of a gravy consistency.  I will DEFINITELY be putting this in my repertoire!

The title describes it, AMAZING!!  Very flavourful and easy. Followed the recipe exact, except I used a pork roast so I cooked on high for 4 hours, turned out perfect.  Added cornstach to the sauce and used as gravy on potatoes, yummy! The whole family loved it!

Just ok in my opinion.  The roast turned out tender but very dry.  I had also added potatoes and carrots in the cooker which took on a nice flavor from the juice but overall it just did not come together the way I expected it too.

Amazing is spot-on!  Truly one of the most delicious pork tenderloins I have ever eaten!  My family could not get enough.  Next time I will put two tenderloins in the crockpot and double the recipe!  I did follow another reviewer's suggestion and studded the meat with garlic, which was a fantastic tip.  I also did have to add chicken broth over the top to completely cover the meat (maybe my crock was a size too large?).  It turned out just AMAZING!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!!

Absolutely delicious. My first time cooking pork in the crock pot and will definitely not be the last! Very easy recipe for such a tasty meal.  I made it exactly as stated in the recipe (red wine I chose to use cabernet sauvignon) but sat the tenderloin on top of sliced onions. Yum.

This was 100% EASY and VERY TASTY!  I did omit the soy sauce (first inadvertently, then just decided to skip it), because we're not big on salt/salty foods.  It won RAVE reviews from my family that joined us for dinner. I strained the sauce from the crockpot into a sauce pan, added 1/2 cup COLD water and 1/4 cup flour mixture to the sauce, boiled for about a minute to make a wonderful gravy to complement the pork.  Served it with Boursin mashed potatoes, spaghetti squash, and steamed brocolli ... Highly recommended the whole thing!

I really wanted to ignore the other bad reviews and find this to be delicious, but I shouldn't have.  The meat was tender (of course it was because it was cooked in the slow cooker!).  However, the flavor was not to my liking.  If you love strong strong strong onion flavor this one is for you.  The only good thing I can say about it is that the gravy made from the juices was pretty good.  It was like a strong brown gravy.  I'll just stick with my recipe that is slightly sweet and made with apricot or peach preserves, cranberry sauce, chili powder, salt and pepper (I know it sounds goofy, but it is very good).

Made this weekend and family loved it.  I chose recipe because I had all the ingredients already in my pantry.  Super easy to make and slow cooker is my new best friend.  Next time, I will pierce the pork loin to let the flavors seem in to the meat, although the juice was a perfect gravy to serve with.

I was really excited to try this recipe since (1) I am always looking for new crock pot recipes, and (2) there were so many positive reviews.  I really wanted to  like it! I followed the recipe exactly although it cooked for 5.5 hours since my husband was late from work.  Unfortunately, my husband and I decided this was just OK.  Nothing special.  The flavor was nice and the meat was tender (but not fork-cut soft, as some state), but the recipe on the whole was pretty average and nothing that I'd go out of my way to recommend to anyone.  Maybe I did something wrong, but it seemed a pretty easy recipe to follow...

I was pretty dissappointed in this recipe.  I can't give it one star since I didn't make it exactly as written.  The only difference was that I didn't use red wine.  Used stock instead for dietary reasons.  The meat was stringy and dry.  The sauce was ok and tasted fine over mashed potatoes.  The meat was so dry it needed the sauce to make it edible. I cooked it for 4 hours on the nose.  We won't be making this again.

While the recipe it very easy, I have to agree with a review that called this bland.  I think next time I will use a stock rather than water and use some sort of dry rub.

A busy week staple in our house!  Instead of water I use stock for additional flavor.  I also use the juices to make a fabulous gravy versus an au jus.  Dried herbs can also be used in place of fresh if on a budget or time crunched, as this is done in the crock pot.

Hello All,
I will give 5 Stars and is wort it. This recipe is amazing don't be looking at the bad reviews. I just finish Chef school in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and I had some amazing Chef teaching me. 
You can get very creative with this recipe and add your own spices and herbs.  And from the jus you can make different sauces that will go very good with pork.

This was fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly (okay I added garlic but I do that to almost everything!) and it was so good.  Lots of flavor and very tender (even cooked on LOW for 4 hours).  I will definitely be making this again and I won't change a thing!

This was fantastic and so easy to make.  I am not particularly a great cook, so this went over well with my family!  Thanks for sharing!  The only change I made was to add wondra to the sauce to thicken as a gravy!

Meh I was disappointed with this one. I had high hopes some of my favorite recipes are simple crockpots recipes. But I didn't like this one. My husband an daughter thought it was ok. I will not be making again.

I agree twith other reviews hat a pork tenderloin is not the type of meat to slow cook in liquid.  Instead I used a pork loin.  It certainly came out tender, but lacked flavor!  I like spice, salt and heat typically so it was not for my taste buds -- very bland.  Bet it would be a winner for kids though!

Delicious!  Followed the recipe as closely as possible, but used Lipton's Beefy Onion soup mix because it was what I had on hand, and a cabernet sauvignon for the wine.  The meat was so juicy and tender and it tasted marvelous.  Definitely on our menu from now on.

We really enjoyed this!  I didn't have the onion soup mix but I followed the recipe from this sight and it was perfect!  I cooked mine all day from frozen, but I think it may have cooked too long.  Hubby thought it was wonderful, but I thought the meat was a little dry. Not a fault of the recipe but from a little too long of cooking time.  I would probably try low sodium soy sauce next time, because the next day the leftovers tasted a lot more salty than the first day.  Very good over potatoes!

This is super easy and just amazing!  I did use light soy sauce.  My son has an allergy to garlic so I just eliminated it.  Didn't even miss it!  DELISH!!!  Will make again...often!

The pork was melt in your mouth tender! Yum yum! The sauce was a bit salty. Maybe I will use a little less soy sauce next time. Also, I think I will use a tad of Worchester sauce.

Really good recipe! I had a 4 lb. pork loin instead of just 2 lb. but you don't need to double the other ingredients. It would be a bit overwhelming. I just gave it an extra splash of water, wine, and soy sauce so the meat would be covered sufficiently. Easy!!

Wonderful recipe...Browned the pork tenderloin in a skillet  before placing in slow cooker. Deglazed skillet w/ red wine and water. After cooking I put the au Jus in a sauce pan to make it into a gravy; and thickened it with about 2tsp flour since i didnt have any cornstarch. My husband and I loved this. Will definitely make this again

I made this for my family and my husband LOVED it!! Meat was tender, au jus was wonderful. Instead of red wine I added Port. I had to strain out the onions from the onion soup mix as there was a lot of it. But it was amazing. We will definately make this a regular in our home.

Definitely do not skimp on the wine - we used a red cooking wine which made the pork a bit tart.  However, still a dish I will make again but will use a good chianti next time!

This does not melt in your mouth.  I followed the directions to the "T" and was sadly disappointed.  I ended up wasting some good red wine, and a beautiful pork loin roast.  Not only was it salty, but the aroma was a tease for the disappointment.  My suggestion would be low sodium soy sauce and a piece of meat you don't mind ruining.

Very very good! My family loved it, but it was a little to salty for my taste even though I used low-sodium Soy sauce. Next time I'll try it with half the onion soup mix.

Delicious.  I cooked my tenderloin in the oven as per the package instructinos and the flavor with this marinade was great.  I did baste the tenderloin a few times while cooking, and if using the oven be sure to use a deep dish/pan so the liquid won't spill.  My grocery store has a low sodium dry onion soup mix that I use.

after three hours on low heat this 2.5 lb tenderloin was WAY overcooked -- it tasted like sawdust.  I threw the whole thing out.  what a waste! the sauce tasted bad too -- it was overpowered by the wine.

Good flavors in the sauce. I doubled the recipe but still kept to the 4 hour cook time and our loin came out a little dry. I would recommend checking the meat about half way through and monitoring from there. If the meat was moister I would have given this 5 stars.

This tasted amazing....I didnt have some ingredients but i used others. I didnt use the onion soup mix or red wine. I used shiraz wine i believe and i added mushrooms to the mix. I also added italian herbs and fresh onions. I also cut the pork loin about an inch thick before and put it in the oven instead, this cut time to about 1 hour & 1/2...This still tasted great. I would recommend.

This was delicious! It was so tender it looked like a brisket! The meat was falling off. I loved it! The only thing I did different was seasoned it with a Southwestern mix and pan seared it to brown the outside of the pork tenderloin and I used fresh onions. Will make it again! Thank you.

This was truly amazing!  My husband fell in love all over again! (with me and the pork! :)  all I had was cooking sherry on hand and it was great. Next time I'll try wine but the sherry worked just fine. Will definitely be making it to our table on a regular basis.  And awesome with mashed potatoes. Yum!!

Excellent dish - The only thing I would do next time is eliminate the soy sauce because the pork was very salty - The onion soup mix add enough sodium so you really dont need the soy sauce, and the soy sauce flavor was undetectable anyway.....very moist meat, delicious even as leftover and pork normally tends to dry out quickly -

I followed the recipe exactly and the pork had very little flavor.  No one wanted to eat it but hopefully the pork can be used for sandwiches with a lot of mustard.

I made this exactly as the recipe states and it was the best pork tenderloin I've made.  This will definitely be part of my rotation in the future.  Even my husband, who is picky, loved it.  We have enough for  lunches tomorrow and we're so looking forward to it!  You have to try this one!

Not a great winner at home but worth trying.  Tenderloin was moist and tasty but a cheaper cut of pork may be better suited for this recipe. I followed the recipe to the tee.........the gravy was the best part. (add cornstarch after "resting" pork and cook broth or au jus for 10 minutes on high while in crockpot)  Next time if I were to follow the ideas I might try to sear ahead of time and or use a cheaper cut of pork.  All the seasonings and such were just right for us and my daughter who did finish almost all of her plate!

I loved this recipe. I made this with a 4lb pork loin cooked on high for 3 hours in my slowcooker. I used the digital probe to get the temp to 160 F. My family loved the au jus. My 9 year old daughter who normally sits at the dinner table picking at her food was the first to finish. I will make it again.

This was wonderful; very tender. I used freshly chopped garlic and might use a little less next time. I served with applesauce v. the au jus which was a big hit with my boys.

The sauce is excellent.  I had some sauce left over and I poured it on my left over meatloaf the next night.  I cooked the pork tenderlion on high for 4 hours and I thought it was a bit over done.  My tenderlion was just shy of 2 lbs.  I did use fresh garlic and inserted it inside the pork as a previously mentioned and it gave the pork more flavor.

I LOVE garlic, but this was too much. I did as the recipe stated by keeping it all on the top. It was not very good at all. I wouldn't say horrible. The inside of the tenderloin was good and tender, but I would definetly cut back on the garlic, or either mix it in with the broth. It was way too much!! I have been cooking for over 11 years now and I can honestly say this was NOT one of my top tenderloins.. I didn't adjust a thing the recipe. Other than cutting off the outside of the pork before serving it.. Sorry for the bad review. :0(

I made this pork tenderloin tonight and I have to say it was the best recipe for pork that I ever made. My family loved it. It was so easy to prepare and the meat fell apart. I loved the taste of the gravy. This will become a must have in my recipe book.

We made this last weekend and loved it!! Talk about melt-in-your-mouth good! The only thing we added was about 1/4 cup worcestershire sauce. Some of the reviews said it was bland, so we did that for kick. It tasted awsome. This will become a regular in our house for sure.

This was so good and so flavorful.  I worried when I read through some of the reviews that it might be too salty; but I am SO glad I decided to try it.  I used a 2 lb "pork sirloin tip roast" from Costco, and instead of 3TBS soy sauce, I tried 2TBS soy sauce and 1TBS Worcestershire sauce.  I also probably only used 2TBS minced garlic (mainly sprinkling it on the top of the roast).  And for the wine I used was a Pinot Noir.  I cooked it in the slow cooker for 6hrs on high and it was moist and delicious!  I don't really recommend using the gravy though; because it is very salty.  But do try this---it's good--my picky kids ate it up as well; even asked for seconds!  Thanks for the yummy recipe.

I LOVE my red wine and I was dying to make this recipe. After my first bite, I wanted to throw it away. I kept eating thinking maybe I would enjoy it if I got a bite with less "stuff" on it. OMG! it kept getting worse and worse. I ordered pizza. I was so bummed! This mixture of ingredients DOES NOT delight my tastebuds.

I made as written but also added garlic to the roast. Next time I will add more garlic. It cooked for about 4 1/2 hours on low (but I have a HOT crockpot) and then I turned it off for an hour or so because we weren't ready to eat. I served it fried sage beans and acorn squash (both from this site). The flavors worked wonders together. My husband said he could eat this every week.

I MADE THIS WONDERFULLY EASY CREATION FOR SUNDAY'S SUPPER.  MASHED POTATOES ARE A MUST.  ALSO SERVED FRESH GREEN BEANS FROM OUR GARDEN.   I DIDN'T HAVE EVEN THREE TAKE OUT PACKETS OF SOY SAUCE SO USED YOSHIDA'S INSTEAD.  AMAZING RECIPE...THANK YOU FOR SHARING!

This was very good, nice combination of flavors.   And easy too, not a ton of ingredients which I like.   I made it as written except used reduced sodium soy sauce.  I still found it to be very salty though.  I am a salty food person and don't usually have that complaint when others do so next time I'll take the suggestion to just use the flakes from the dry onion soup mix.  Overall though its a keeper.

I made the mistake of starting this before going to work for the day. The gravy worked out wonderfully (I substituted one real onion for the onion soup mix) but the meat was very dry. Next time I won't go light on the garlic either (I used 3 cloves... needed perhaps 6).

Loved it!  With the wine we used, it tasted pretty strong so I added more chicken broth (substitued for water) after it cooked, used cornstarch and water to thicken and then salt and pepper.   I noticed the recipe says it is for 6.  There are 2 adults, 2 girls ages 11 & 9, and we had a little left - not enough or 2 more people though!  This will be a regular for us.

I followed the recipe exactly.  The texture was lovely, but the flavor was overpoweringly of wine.  I use a decent ($12 Wine Spectator 90) Cabernet.

I rate this a 4 star.  This is the second time I made this dish.   I love the  flavor of onion, garlic, red wine and soy sauce while cooking in the slow cooker.   The recipe is easy to prepare.  Loved by my whole family.  Simply delicious.

I liked this a lot and so did my picky eater husband. I prepared as written and thought that it was probably a little too salty, but otherwise perfect. I'll try a low sodium soy sauce or just cut it in half next time. Thanks!!

Well, I am writing this review as a note to MYSELF to try this again.  I had to leave the recipe for my husband to put together.  I need to try this again, first of all, by the time I finally got around to making it, we had run out of the tenderloin slices I had bought for this recipe, so had sent hubby to the store the night before.  He came home with Pork Chops instead of Pork tenderloin! So, next day, I went back to the store (a different store cause hubby said they didn't have anything like that!), and was too late to get into the crockpot.  So, then, he made the next day and I went off to work.  Came home to a wonderful smelling kitchen, and Very Hungry!  I could hardly finish it, it was SO spicy!  I think he must have put in the soy sauce, AND the same amount of black pepper, not reading to the end where it says, "to taste".  don't know for sure, but with all the other reviews, will definitely have to try again.

This recipe was wonderful and so easy.  I was a little worried about the amount of garlic so I cut it to 2 Tbsp instead of 3.  I also noticed it was not done in 4 hours on Low.  I ended up cooking it on low for 7 hours and made shredded pork sandwiches.  My picky eaters loved it.

I have to start off saying that I don't believe an expensive cut of pork tenderloin should be cooked in a slow cooker. But, my freezer broke and defrosted a ton of meat so I had to get cookin' even though it was over 100 degress. Ugh. So, I tried because it was a fast slow cooker recipe. I was hoping to not heat up the kitchen even more than it already was. It was very bland and came out an ugly gray-purple color. I detected no wine or onion flavor. I pulled it out after 3 hours because it was done but still came out dry. Everyone had to eat it with BBQ sauce to give it some flavor.

this was truly a fantastic recipe! so easy and it made the very best gravy for mashed potatoes - a true comfort food. actually used wild vines blackberry merlot didnt have any good wine on hand it made the gravy so yummy! i think this would be equally delicious using a roast beef for potting...also added a tablespoon of worcestshire sauce i did not use but just a tadd of garlic as we dont like alot of garlic...

Easy as 1-2-3! Both my boyfriend and I loved this recipe and I am not a big fan of pork at all. It was melt in your mouth delicious. I only made a few simple changes. I used Beef broth instead of  water, only 2 tbsp's of soysauce (based on other reviews I was afriad it would be salty. It wasn't) and used  homemade red wine. Cook time was perfect at 4 hours on low. Will definitely make this again.

This was a great recipe! I had to alter it a little because I made a 3 pound pork tenderloin but it was great. I did have to replace the soy sauce with worchestershire sauce and the minced garlic with 2 cloves of slivered garlic but it did not matter it still turned out great!!!

Excellent!! Boyfriend raved!! I used some Cabernet that was open and inserted garlic slivers into the meat. I use a pork roast instead of a tenderloin and it stil so tender. I added a pkg of sliced mushrooms about an hour before it was done. Served with red-skinned potatoes and broccoli rabe. Will definited make again, may try it with chicken thights!

I did not like this at all.  I made a 4 pound roast and doubled all  the ingredients.  The juice was very overpowering.  The roast took on the wine flavor more than anything.

This was really good, but I agree with reviewers who have written that the wine you use makes a big difference. The first time I made it it was restaurant quality and one of the best dishes I've made, but the second time it wasn't as good and the wine taste was much stronger, as I had used a different variety of wine. I like to serve this over a bed of mashed potatoes and drizzle the drippings over the top.

Not bad, not great.  Was moist and tender. The wine was a nice, subtle flavor, but it needed something more. Thought wine did give it a nice flavor.

Didn't care for it, sorry. don't really care for any kind of roast in the crockpot, don't like the consistency of it, but thought i'd give it a try. Quite salty and a very prominent wine taste, couldn't even tell it was pork.

this was outstanding! i was worried because of all the mixed reviews but this was great! a lot of people said they found this salty, but i needed MORE salt on mine! I made the recipe almost exactly as written (I cut down on the wine a little because I'm not a huge fan-used 1/2 cup instead) and thought it was fantastic. Hubby loved it too. Will make this anytime I make a tenderloin. Will definitley make when I have a dinner party too! Would be perfect!

Really yummy and tender.  I sprinkled the meat with a bit of garlic powder and pepper, seared it and then put it into the slow cooker to give it an extra flavor boost.

Great taste and simple. I used a white zin for the wine and it was not overpowering.  To make the meal complete I included potatoes and carrots.  I thickened the sauce for a nice gravy.  Good stuff!

Very good.  The only thing I did differently was substitite the water for 1 can of beef broth.  I threw in the prok tenderloin frozen with everything else and let it cook on low all day.  Will make again

I was afraid because of the mixed reviews and haven't make this in a crock pot before.  It was incredibly EASY and SOOO delicious!  Made some changes as suggested.  Exchanged the red wine for chicken stock and used Teryaki instead of soy.  I also seared in a pan just because others complained it was too bland.  Great taste, and everyone was right about that gravy ... a lot of my guests didn't use it, but those who did thought it was WONDERFUL over mashed 'tatoes!  Thank you!  Will make again!

I made this recipe because it looked really easy and I am a busy Mom of 2 little girls. It was so easy to prepare, and actually cost me around $25 for the whole meal! (Including the wine!) We have a Hamilton Beach slow cooker so after 4 hours on low (like the recipe says) I checked it and the pork wasn't fully cooked. I cranked it up to high for 2 more hours and it was cooked perfectly! (Every couple of hours I dumped the juice/sauce over the tenderloin while it was cooking.) My husband and oldest daughter liked it, I liked it as well but when I make this next time I'm going to use less wine. I felt the wine was a little bit overpowering. (I used a $10 bottle of red Chianti so maybe that was why?) All in all it was an easy meal, that fed our family twice for around $25 which is something you can't beat!

Honestly, this was okay.  I was very excited when reading the reviews, however after following the recipe exactly it seemed like the onion soup mix overpowered the meat.  I didn't get the same results as others therefore, I do not plan on making this again.

This is very good! I did revise this a little, instead of red wine, I used a can of beef broth(I don't like red wine), I did half cup of water, about 1 1/2 tbs. garlic and the soy sauce I just shook some in it so I don't know how much I used but it wasn't 3 tbs. It really tastes good on top of toasted texas toast!

Good, and great texture. Felt like it needed more wine than the recipe called for. Also, considering adding whole white mushrooms to the crock pot 2 hours in to add flavor.

so delicious! my hubby and i have added pork tenderloin to our diet once a week because its healthier than red meats. the crock pot is the best way to cook tenderloin and this recipe is a real keeper! i let mine simmer for 5 1/2 hours and it just fell apart and was so juicy! yum-yum

Sorry, but I found this to be overly salty with little finesse--and it's not because I'm afraid to cook with wine--I do it all the time, but it all just totally overwhelmed the mildness of the pork.

This is as good as it sounds! I fixed this for Christmas Day dinner and we were not dissapointed! I put it in first thing in the morning and enjoyed the family-no fuss main course! I served it with cheesy hashbrown casserole and Oriental Cole Slaw, among other sides. It was SO tender and moist, everyone raved about it! Don't forget to use those wonderful slow cooker liners and clean-up's a breeze!

My girls (5 & 8) gobbled this up!  They both asked for the recipe for when they can cook. I followed the recipe exactly.  I can see where changing the red wine would make a big difference. The next time I might use less garlic, but other than that this truly was simple and definitely amazing!

This came out pretty well....not the best tenderloin I've ever made but it was easy to make. If I didn't already have a bottle of red wine open at home, I don't think I would go out & buy one for this recipe. I would probably change out the 1c of water with something else...maybe a beef broth. It was missing depth of flavor. Maybe mix in a little honey with the sauce just before serving. It was a decent, weeknight meal.

This was okay.  My family and I did not care for it.  It was edible, but not great, or even that good. Would not make again.

Outstanding recipe!!! I made a few changes before I tried because I was worried my kids wouldn't like it. I used Lipton's Savory Herb with Garlic dried soup mix, about 1/3 cup of red wine, and one heaping tbls of minced garlic. We omitted the soy sauce but will try some the next time we make this recipe. It went great with potatoes and carrots. The leftovers did not go to waste. One of the simplest recipes that I've ever tried in the slow cooker.

I agree that this pork tenderloin is amazing! I have made it several times now and it is always fantastic and incredibly easy! I have had people ask for the recipe saying it's the best tenderloin they have ever eaten! The au jus left behind is really great! The only difference is I add extra garlic and some mushrooms. This recipe is tucked into my stock of recipes and I will be making it for years to come!

I didnt add red wine b/c I had none. I added carrotts, potatoes and red onion in the crock pot as well. A dash of worcetshire made it extra tasty. i used freshly crushed garlic. this dish has the potential to be 4 star if your are an experienced cook. I should have seared the top before anything else.

This recipe is amazing.I made this recipe exactly as it was written the first time and we loved it. Now I use pork loin because it's cheaper and my family will eat pounds of pork cooked like this. I do double the wine when using more pork obviously. I also do I add fresh mushrooms while it's cooking to use as a side dish. When it's finished I make a roux and make the sauce into a gravy. Truly fabulous. Thanks for this recipe.

Wonderful flavour! I add chopped onions and sliced mushrooms, and slightly thicken with corn starch when cooked.  This recipe also works great with any kind of pork loin oven cooked.

Good results for me!  My roast was tender & juicy.  Everyone liked it.  I cut back a bit on the wine & used Lipton onion mushroom soup mix because that is what I had on hand.  I used corn starch to thicken the gravy.  Served it with rice this time but next time I would definitely make mashed potatos to take advantage of the yummy gravy.

Pretty good basic pork recipe.  Liked how easy it was.  It seems like it's pretty versatile too:  we ate the pork just drizzled with the juice from the crock pot, but will probably shred the pork tonight, add BBQ sauce and have pulled pork sandwiches.

meh...I didn't like the taste of the red wine on the pork. The onion broth, and adding the vegetables, good idea, but probably would omit the red wine or use a lot less if I made it again.

This was great! I made it for a goodbye dinner for my brother who left for the military, and we loved it!  Next time though I will make sure I use the lower sodium soy sauce and may cut back on it all together because it was a little salty for my taste.  We turned the juice into a gravy and served over mashed potatoes with steamed green beans.  It was a good homestyle meal.  I cant wait to make it on a cold winter day.

I didn't have a simple red wine, so I used the Blackberry Merlot that I had on hand.  It was the most tasty meal I have had in a long,long time!  Everyone loved it...and it was so tender that it just fell apart when you touched it with a fork!!

I made this according to the recipe, but did make some slits in the tenderloin and inserted slivers of a couple of extra cloves of garlic. My brother-in-law, my son, and my hubby thought it was WONDERFUL!  I didn't eat here tonight, but will be partaking of the leftovers tomorrow night.

I liked it, but pork tenderloin does cook fast even in a slow cooker!  LOL.  Keep an eye on it.  I made this exact recipe and enjoyed the gravy, the kids thought it was "tangy" maybe due to the wine and soy sauce?

Very good, 4 hours on low is plenty of time, I thought it wouldn't be but it was. The au juice is tasty. My only qualm is the galic. I love garlic, but in this recipe it over powers much of the other flavors. I will use half of the amount next time. Very good recipe thanks for sharing.

Very delicious.  I cooked mine on high for about 5 hours and then let it stay on warm until dinner was ready.  Also threw in a handful of rosemary.  YUM!

Oh, how tender and EASY this recipe was!  I was a little uneasy about using red wine, but a friend told me, whenever something calls for red wine, not to use the cooking wine because of all the added salt.  She said just to use regular wine.  I had my mom and dad over for dinner that night, since it cooked so much, and everybody just RAVED about it!  The flavor and tenderness were unbelievable!!  This one's definately going in my recipe box!!

This was easy and tasted great!  Not a morsel left.  I added potatoes and carrots and it turned out perfect.  I cooked it for 5 hours on high setting.

This was so flavorful and tender!  The meat didn't dry out at all!  I was so surprised.  I served this with mashed potatoes and green beans it was definitely a hit with my family.

I used a 4# pork loin roast rather than a tenderloin.  I let this cook for about 8 hours on low and then shredded the pork and served on deli sub rolls with the au jus along side for dipping.  I will probably add some rosemary or herbes de province next time, but this was very good as the recipe states.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

My family really enjoyed this! I added some fresh sliced mushrooms and thickened up the gravy with 2 tbsps of flour. Other than that, I made as directed and it was delish. Thanks!

This was a big disappointment - the only way I can describe the result is the meat was "grainy" and in all, not much flavour.  I'll stick to my other "non-slow cooker recipes from now on for pork tenderloin.

This was not a horrible recipe, however, it was more suited towards a cheaper cut of meat.  If you are going to use this recipe, please please please do not leave the meat in longer than the four hours prescribed in the recipe.  I left this in for about 4 hr and 45 min and this came out tasting more like barbeque then it did melt in your mouth tenderloin.

a waste of an expensive piece of meat. The meat is too tender for the slow cooker, it dries the meat.  Good sauce but needs the help of cornstarch and water to thicken, if not is like water.

I made this for dinner last night. I used a Shiraz for the wine and it turned out very nice. I followed what everyone else did and turned the broth into a yummy gravy for my mashed potatos. Served it with garlic roasted broccoli and I was in heaven! :) I will make this again.

Quick & Easy. I used 7 boneless pork chops. I added extra garlic and a little worcestershire sauce plus what the recipe calls for. The meat was tender & juicy but lacking in flavor. I will make this again but will add more seasonings,

Since I've only seen TENDERLOIN of pork in 1-1 1/2 pound pieces, I can only assume you are using pork LOIN.  That's pork chops that haven't been cut but boned.  The reciipe is great but I used low sodium soy sauce.

This was very good. I gave it four stars because it was definitely a little too salty. I followed suggestions of other reviews and put garlic in pockets of the meat and used 2 Tbs of soy sauce instead of 3. Served it with corn, mashed potatoes and used the sauce from the crockpot for gravy. Just thickened it up with some flour. I will definitely make again, but may use half of a package of soup mix instead of a full one.

Awesome!  The meat was nice and tender, the au jus was very tasty and also went great on the mashed potatoes!  I didn't use the entire amount of garlic...just a personal preference.  I only used 1 tblsp. This is a great recipe, everyone in the family loved it. Thanks!

Wow!  This was surprisingly good!  I did not have the Onion Soup Mix, but subbed a couple tablespoons of a product called Onion Onion.  Other than that, and adding 8 oz of mushrooms to the top, I made it as instructed.  The mushrooms were a delicious addition and soaked up the flavors of the au jus.   Also, I made it the  night before, so it sat overnight in the refrigerator in the crockpot marinating.  My husband started it at lunch, so it cooked 5 hrs on low and it was perfectly cooked.    Even my 2.5 year old ate it up, and he is picky!!

I was looking for a new recipe for pork tenderloin and this was great. I studded the meat with small garlic cloves as other reviewers suggested and added a little minced garlic to the liquid as well (I really like garlic). I flipped the meat halfway through the cooking time (4 hours on high) since there wasn't enough liquid in the pot to cover the meat. I do think the cooking time could use a bit of tweaking since there seems to be some question on low vs. high heat but I'm not sure what the correct answer is; 4 hours on high was probably more time than it needed, but 4 hours on low may not have been enough. I added some cornstarch at the end to make the au jus into a gravy and served it with potatoes. May be too salty for some, but overall very good.

tried this about a week ago. followed the directions to a T since this was my first go. it turned out amazing! the only things i noticed were that yes, it did need extra cooking time in my crock pot and that next time i make it, i may back off the red wine a bit and maybe add more water. i will definitely make this again though! moist and delicious!

This recipe might be better suited for a pork roast not a tenderloin. Delicious but too much garlic. Next time I am going to cut the garlic in half and in it's place add a bit of honey and ginger to livin' it up a bit.

This one is truly Amazing. Served with rice and green salad and got raves. It's on my permanent list of 10's for simple and delectable. Reduced soy sauce to lower sodium and made gravy with cornstarch.

This was a pretty good recipie.  I enjoyed the flavor of the gravy.  Thickened with flour and I also added mushrooms to the cooker just before done.  Easy, throw in cooker, leave and dinner is served hours later.  POrk always does well when cooked slow.  It was juicey and full of good onion and garlic flavor.  I will make this again!  Thanks for the recipie

I made this dish to take to my boyfrien'ds house so we wouldn't have to cook on a FRiday night. Coming from a hutning and "meat & potatoes" family, he definitely enjoys and knows his meats. I absolutely loved this dish, but he actually said that this was probably the best pork tenderloin/roast he had ever had in his life. And it was super easy as well! 5 Stars - we absolutely loved it!!!

Tenderloin should not be cooked in a crock pot.. and I should have known better. The combination of wine, soy sauce and onion soup mix was interesting and made the pork taste sour. Perhaps browning in a skillet before putting in the crock pot would improve the flavor and its appearance. If you do attempt this recipe give yourself a few minutes at the end to make a sauce from the crock pot liquids.

This was GREAT! I used a shiraz because it's what I had on hand, and it turned out great. I think I'll try some of the other suggestions to thicken up the sauce at the end on the stovetop though. But besides that I thought the flavors were great. Went GREAT with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.

With such high ratings I expected way more out of this recipe.  The flavors were not good together.  The only good thing was was that the pork did stay tender.  We couldn't even eat it.  I guess everyone really does have different tastes, but I won't be recommending this to anyone no matter how easy it is.

It's hard to believe that something that tastes so good takes practically no prep time or effort. I used port for the red wine and thickened the sauce with a flour/water mixture before serving over mashed potatoes.  Next time (and there will be a next time!) I plan on doubling everything but the meat and adding onion, mushrooms and baby carrots to the crock pot.  It's a keeper!

This was so delicious. I didn't have any onion soup mix so I used a can of french onion soup instead. I also rub the tenderloin with some spicy mustard along with the soy sauce. I cooked it for about 5 hours on low. Everyone loved it and there was none leftover.

I usually don't mind things a little on the salty side, but would agree with cutting down or omitting soy sauce.  I used a 1 1/2 lb tenderloin; it took 2 hours to cook.  It is still a good / easy recipe and one worth keeping.  Maybe just needs a little adjustment.  I liked the suggestion about using fresh onions instead of onion soup.  I also have a rosemary bush in the back yard and put 2 sprigs of rosemary in the crock pot.

This was quite good, though I felt it needed a little something.  I added some rosemary towards the end of cooking and it certainly helped make the gravy more flavourful.  Next time I will add it at the beginning to make the pork tastier.

Aside for being easy to put together, my family did not enjoy this at all. It had a very funny taste to it that we just couldnt put our finger on. I ended up throwing a $12 piece of meat in the trash. What a waste!

Not nearly as great as I thought it would be. Pork tenderloin does best baked in the oven. This same recipe with a nice beef roast is way better.

Meat was very flavorful and tender but it was too salty for my taste. Perhaps would be better if using a low sodium soup mix.

I ended up using a cheaper cut of meat, pork steaks. I braised the steaks in garlic and EVOO and layered the steaks over a large drained, rinsed can of mushrooms. I ended up adding a little brown sugar (felt like it needed SOMETHING) and I only added 1/4 c. of 
water with the red wine. I omitted the soy sauce, as I thought it would make it too salty. I'm glad I did. I also added a can of golden mushroom soup, to thicken it up a little bit. It was good. The bigger kid, my husband and I all ate it but the baby wouldn't touch it.

EDITED TO ADD ONE DAY LATER: I changed my rating. WAY better the next day. The flavor of the wine mellowed a bit and was a nice combination with the rest of the ingredients. I suggest making this the day before, letting it rest overnight, then warming it the next day.

This was very tender.  The husband loved it. I did subt. stock for water but I do that in any recipe that calls for just water.  It's just more flavor..  Be careful not to overcook.

This was a great recipe!  I used white wine instead of red (all I had) but the flavor was still amazing!!  The pork was a little dry though.  I followed the recipe but will perhaps reduce the cooking time.  Will definitely be using this one again!  Thanks!

Wow this was amazing. I've had this in my recipe box for almost two years and just decided to make it. The pork was so tender and the gravy was so flavorful. Even my four year old daughter like it. She cleaned her plate! That says just how good it was. I will definately make this again.

Very good.  I made one change, I used the mushroom/onion soup mix (because it's what I already had).  It turned out so moist and tender.

This recipe was absolutely delicious and easy---only changes i made were to brown in olive oil and after the roast was cooked...i strained the sauce into a saucepan and thickened with cornstarch---made a wonderful gravy to go with mash potatoes.

This pork was out of this world!  My 3 kids, all picky eaters loved it.  Made garlic mashed potatoes and corn on the cob.  Fabulous meal!!!

This is a wonderful recipe.  The Pork was so moist and delicious. I thickened the juices with a little flour to make a nice gravy and made garlic mashed potatoes to have a nice comfort meal.  
Thanks...

I added more garlic as suggested by one user but that was a bit to much for me I think next time I will try the recipe as is the pork was cooked perfect very juicy and tender.

The roast was tender, but I thought the marinade overpowered the meat. It tasted more like beef. I might like to try the same marinade with a beef roast to see how that works.

The pork tenderloin couldn't have been easier to make and it tasted pretty good too. I used low sodium soy sauce because of the other reviews and that was a good move. I think regular soy sauce would have made it way too salty. I added a cup of sliced portobello mushrooms for the last 30 minutes and thought that was a good add. I'm not a big fan of pork tenderloin, but I'll make this recipe again.

My family loves this, even the picky eaters who don't particularly like red meat.  Use low sodium soy sauce to make it less salty.

This is a definite keeper!  I made it for Mother's Day dinner with my extended family. Everyone raved over it.  It was so tender, and if you add a little corn starch to the broth and bring it to a boil, you got yourself a nice gravy for the meat and side dishes!

I found this dish to be way too salty. The meat was tender but came out stringy and dry. Using a pork tenderloin in a crock pot makes as much sense as using a beef tenderloin for pot roast.

Very good but be careful with the garlic.  I overdid it a bit and thats about all I tasted.  Next time, I might try apple juice instead of wine as another reviewer suggested.

I love this recipe!!! It was fabulous. We modified it slightly per other suggestions. Once the meat was done, we took the juice and heated it on the stove adding corn startch which had already been dissolved in cold water to thicken it into a gravy. We also added a couple of Tbs. of butter. This was delicious and I don't even like pork that much. Can't wait to make again.

excellent dinner.  Served it with steamed broccoli and little white potatoes.

I used a crock pot liner so when the pork was "done" (see next paragraph)I picked up the liner and dumped the sauce into a pan that I had a roux going in and made the best pork gravy ever.

I don't know about 4 hours on low.  I had a tenderloin that was under 2lbs and it was cooked rare after 3 hours on high and one hour on low.  I will definitely cook this alot longer next time.  

I was really expecting this to be shredded when it was done, but it wasn't.  

Will definitely make it again, and will futz around with the cooking seasonings.  Maybe some ginger and orange juice?

I will be making this recipe again!  I love meals that cook themselves in the crockpot and this one has very little prep involved.  The only thing that I don't suggest is trying to make the au jus into gravy.  I tried this and it just tasted really strongly like soy sauce.  I think next time we will just enjoy it with just au jus.  Very good recipe!  Thanks for the post!

This couldn't be any easier to put together, took all of 5 minutes the night before!  I put the crockpot insert in the fridge overnight which I think allowed the flavors of the sauce to permeate the meat and infuse it with a more intense flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly as written except that it cooked longer than the recipe stated.  The meat was very tender and we were able to break it up with a fork; no knife needed.  I served with homemade mashed potatoes and corn with the gravy on the side which we poured over the potatoes and meat.  My husband and son both thought it was very tasty.  I will be making this again when Pork Tenderloins go on sale at the grocery store.  Nice, easy, hot comforting food for a cold winter's night!  Thanks for an easy, tasty pork recipe!

Sorry, just didn't work for me! I followed the recipe exactly, and found it to be extremely dry.  The flavor was okay, but a little bland.  The pork was a gray/brown color which I also didn't think was very appetizing.

Pork tenderloin is one of my favorite meats to cook.  But, not by using a slow cooker.  I thought for sure you would still have the same moist and delicious meat but blah...I would rather roast a pork tenderloin or slice it and broil it than prepare it this way...Blah! And leave out the wine! Tasteless and dry.  If it wasn't for the juice, I couldn't have finished the small piece I had.

Not so amazing.  Not a lot of flavor.  Meat was tough.  Won't make this again.

I made this for the first time about six months ago and it was fabulous. Started making it today and thought better do a review. I just use an inexpensive cut of pork, all red wine other then that its exactly the same. Mmmm..the meat was juicy and tender and very tasty. I love red wine in dishes so this was perfect for me. Thickened the juice afterward to make a gravy to put over potatoes which was soooo good. Not too salty at all for me but then I love salty things. Thanks for a wonderful recipe which I will make again and again. :)

Mmmmmmm!  I made this dish on a busy day, and what a suprise when walking in
the door, it smelled heavenly and tasted
better!  The pork fell apart and was so juicy. Everyone loved it!  The best part for me was dipping crusty bread into the gravy I made from the juice!  It's a keeper!

This was really good. I used Chianti, the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce combination, and an Onion/Mushroom soup packet. It was good, but not something I'd crave more than once a month or less. Thanks for the recipe.

I really enjoyed the gist of this recipe, but I modified it quite a bit. I cut the wine, soy sauce, and onion soup mix by a third, and added carrots, mushrooms, and celery, and an hour before it finished a partially cooked cubed potato. I cooked it the same amount of time as was recommended, and the meal was fabulous. The pork was so tender and succulent. I give this meal two thumbs up.

This is fantastic.  Used Garlic powder and sprinked all over top, used knife to poke holes to allow flavor to seep inside.  Almost 3 pound tenderloin for 4 hours on high.  The meat was super tender the gravy was awesome.  Even my picky 6 year old loved it.  Made with potatoes and mixed veggies. Will definetly make again.

I used a 4 lb tenderloin so I doubled up on the ingredients.  I omitted the soy sauce, added 2 TBSP of Worcheshire sauce, and used a Merlot for the wine.  My family complained about very pungent smell while cooking and although I usually LOVE garlic, the recipe calls for too much for my taste.  Used corn starch to thicken juices for a nice gravy to pour over mashed potatoes. Quite tender and tasty over-all.

I thought that this meat was wasted in a slow cooker.  However, the left overs were great in a pork stir fry the next night.  My family enjoyed this better than the first night it was made.  Next time I will bar-b-que my port tenderloin as usual as my family prefers it that way.

I tried really hard to like this pork but it just did not do it for me. It had a very strange taste(maybe the wine). We ended up putting BBQ sauce on it to be able to eat it.

++++ If I could give this a ten I totally would!  This was amazing.  I did add a few more cloves of garlic than it asked for.  This recipe was delicious!  My husband let me have a little taste and ate the entire roast himself.  Right after he was done, he asked me to make another one.  We loved this!

Produced a very moist loin, but we didn't really care for the flavor.  Think this would work really well w/a nice cut of beef, but the flavors just didn't seem to mesh well w/the pork.

I would have given it 5 stars but my husband thought it was too salty, so 4 it is.  We used low-sodium soy sauce and it was still salty; my husband thought too much, but I thought it was really good.  I only had cheap cooking wine and I still thought it was really good.  I might use less soy sauce next time but I will make it again.

I really wanted to like this recipe, but although the flavor was great, my roast came out tender but dry- maybe I'm just pork challenged, I always seem to have the same problem with pork roasts!

This recipe really is amazing as the name says. I don't have a crock pot, so I cooked it in the oven, with some minor changes to the recipe. As someone else suggested, I used more garlic than called for, and cut slits in the meat, and pushed the garlic inside. I also cut up some red potatoes and put them in the pot. I just used a large pot with a lid, and cooked it for 2 hours at 250°F, then for another 70 minutes at 300°F, and it came out perfect.

I made this recipe because it was pretty much the only thing I could find that I had all the ingredients for and I didn't want to go to the store.
I sure got a pleasant suprise!  The meat was so flavorful and moist,  and my family loved it.  I actually cooked it in an electric frying pan on low for about 3-4 hours and had to add some water a few times so it didn't dry out.

Very good, easy recipe.  Just wish the tenderloin was cheaper!  But could apply this recipe to other cuts I'm sure.  Just haven't tried yet. . . Thanks!

This recipe is definitely a keeper. The aroma when cooking was amazing. The pork was actually moist and the flavors came together in a very delicious way. I served with egg noodles and a green veggie. I too reduced the amount of soy sauce. This will undoubtedly be a regular on our household menu.

This was very tender. I kept it in for 5 hours & used same measurements & ingredients as directed. I liked it best the first night. Leftovers I found just slightly strong. That could be the Merlot or the lots of garlic I used. :-) My husband liked it and said he would eat again.

This was just okay for us - not spectacular but not terrible either.  We didn't care too much for the red wine in this dish.  I might omit this next time.  Also, it didn't look too appetizing when it came out of the slow cooker.  But, the pork was tender and we served it with some steamed white rice.  Thanks for sharing.

Not sure (as the title says) that is was "amazing", but was good.  I used a boneless pork roast in slow cooker.  Was good and left overs made good sandwich.

This was good and very easy to prepare! The pork was nice and tender. My husband and I thought that there was too much soy sauce in it, which made it pretty salty. I'm going to make it again, and put less soy sauce in it. Thanks for the recipe!

YUM!!!  I used 3, fairly thick, boneless pork loin chops.  I seared the chops with salt and pepper and followed the rest of the recipe (used white wine instead of red).  I cooked on high for 1 1/2 hours and then added cubed butternut squash and zucchini.  I cooked on high for 3 hours and the meat was very tender!

This was super easy, and ohhh so tasty.  I rubbed the tenderloin with a seasoned mixture called Pinch and seared it before putting in the crock.  It was wonderful, my family raved.  It was a little salty for us, but we are not big salt people.

This was pretty easy to make, but I too thought it was pretty bland considering all of the flavors going into it.  I used way more garlic than the recipe called for, rubbed and browned the meat before cooking, etc., but it was still really lacking in flavor.  I won't use this one again.

I usually prefer grilled pork but on a snowy night in Maine I couldn't get motivated to go outside to turn it on, so I tried this. My husband loved this! I am giving it 4 stars because the sauce was a little too salty for me,really easy and nice enough for company..

I searched and searched for the perfect recipe and THIS IS IT! It's super easy, super tasty and mine came out perfect.  

I've done a few pork roasts in the slow cooker before, and they come out like pulled pork...  I didn't want sandwiches this time, and this recipe was perfect.

I served this to 4 other people, who are all picky eaters, and gobbled it up.  A side of rosemary oven roasted red potates, steamed broccoli and apple crisp for dessert... and my guests were happy!

My daughter and her friend loved this!  They kept pouring the au jus over their meat.  I'll cook it again when my husband is in town.  I replaced the 3/4 c. wine with 3/4 c. of beef broth just as crystalmt04 recommended.  Next time, I'll make gravy!

WOW! This is the BEST pork tenderloin I've ever tasted. I used pinot noir and I let cook for 5 1/2 hours on high. This recipe works best with smaller tenderloins. Followed recipe to a tee and it is wonderful...kids & husband raved about it!!

The pork was extremely tender and moist.  Unfortunately, the recipe called for too much wine and it was a little overpowering.  I may make this again and cut the wine in half.

This is DELICIOUS!!I can't believe this recipe isn't 5 star.  I have made this twice now and it is my very favorite pork.  My husband isn't a huge fan of pork but he LOVES this.  Must not overcook.  Leave in low in slow cooker for no more than 4 hours!!!

The meat was tender and moist, but the sauce just didn't hit my head right.  Since I dislike salty food, I only used half a packet of onion soup mix and low sodium soy sauce.  Although I am a red wine lover, the red wine and onion soup didn't go together well; the sauce was thin and had the chemical taste you sometimes get with onion soup mix.  This might have been better with broth in place of some of the red wine, and maybe a can of cream of mushroom soup to thicken it up. A one pound tenderloin was done in 2 1/2 hours.

This was soooo yummy. I even had it cold the next day sliced up in a salad and mmm mmm good. I did make a couple of changes, I used a tbls bottle minced garlic, 1 large clove minced, and then some garlic powder to top it off. I also used the same amounts specified for ingrediants but used a 1 lbs pork tenderloin because of the small amount of people in my home, The pork was ohhhh so tender, and yummy. Will make again!

I did the suggestion from a prior post about thickening the au jus with cornstarch after the tenderloin is cooked.  It makes a wonderful gravy over mashed potatoes.  I normally use only a 1 lb tenderloin, which cooks on High for almost 3 hours.  I use my meat thermometer to ensure the pork is cooked to the right temp, and it's never come out dry.  This is my favorite "impress company" dinner which is very easy to make.

This recipe was good, but didn't blow me away.  I think next time I'll try my own variation.  Beef stock, minced garlic, wine, pepper, maybe some fresh onions.  I didn't really like the soy sauce/onion soup mix combo.  The meat was tender and leftovers would make great sandwiches.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes.

One star only because the dish was easy and the meat was tender.  But I did not think the flavors were good together.  What was I thinking...red wine and soy sauce??

My whole family loved this!  Even my 2 1/2 year old son who is a picky eater ate it up without a word.  I didn't have onion soup mix so I used Knoor leek soup mix instead and it was out of this world.  A definite family favorite!

I really like the base for this recipe...It's easy, flavorful, and tender.  My husband and I did find it a bit on the salty side, but I could always add a potato to the pot to remedy that next time.  And definitely serve with crusty bread for the juice left over.  Great with roasted carrots and homestyle green beans.

My family loved this recipe. I must admit that I grew up not eating pork so the smell of the tenderloin cooking was a foreign and unpleasant smell to me, but none of my family complained. The meat was tender and flavorful and I will be making this for my family again.

This recipe totally lives up to its name. It was very easy to put together, made the house smell great all day, and tasted incredible. It did take longer than the recipe said to cook--almost six hours instead of four until it was really tender.

YUM, YUM & YUM.  My husband and I loved this!!  My kids didn't like it but they don't like anything if it doesn'tcome out of a happy meal box.  I forgot the minced garlic so I added garlic salt and it was ok.  Next time, the garlic will be used.  The tenderloin was so tender.  It just melted in your mouth.  Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!!

Yum, but WAAAAY salty!  I LOVE salty food, but even I thought this was over the top.  Next time I will definitley use light soy sauce and see if I can find a reduced-sodium onion soup mix.  Other than that, great flavor!  I used a regular pork loin and cooked for 10 hours on low, because tenderloin was more expensive.  Turned out great, and I will definitley make this again!

I wanted to try this recipe for two reasons. I am not a fan of pork and the reviews here were so mixed that I was curious to find out for myself. Taking tips from others here, I used 1/2 the onion soup mix and poked holes into the meat with a fork both before cooking and then about 1 hour before it was done. Result? The most moist, flavourful meat ever! My husband is a pork fan and absolutely loved this melt in your mouth dish.

My family didn't find this too salty and it was super moist.  So full of flavor and easy.  I will make it again.  I substituted the onion soup for a garlic soup mix and added pearl onions.

So easy. And so delicious!  Wow.  I was leery after reading the mixed bag of reviews, but I'm very glad I prepared this recipe anyway.  Salty?  Well, admittedly, that's a matter of personal preference, but I stopped using table salt years ago and I'm extra sensitive about too much salt--and I thought the saltiness factor was just fine.  I poked a few holes in the tenderloin, which helped the juice penetrate the meat.  I prepared a 2 1/2 pound loin on low (as the recipe suggests) and it was done in three, not four hours.  Crockpot recipes always seem to get done far faster in my crockpot than the recipe calls for.  We had this for LUNCH--HA! I didn't bother with real potatoes--just instant with the meat and au jus.  It was a feast fit for a king.  My picky eating son rated this 8.2 (you would have to know him) on a scale of 1 to 10--a most high compliment!  I may thicken the sauce with corn starch the next time I make this, but it was terrific "as is."

I found this pork dish to be too salty and the flavor simply too strong.  The meat, while tender, was very dry, and I did not like the au jus enough to pour it over the meat.  IF I make it again I will use 1/2 packet of soup, and only use 1/4 c of red wine, substituting 1/2 c of low-sodium chicken broth for the rest.  I will also reduce the amount of garlic.  I served it with brown rice and steamed carrots, and the au jus was pretty good when used sparingly on the rice.  My husband really liked it, though.

This was easy, for sure.  But there was definitely something lacking.  I gave it three stars because my husband liked it, but I found it dry.  It was very tender, but the meat, itself, was on the dry side.  I cut back on the garlic based on what others said. We did not find it too salty, but we did not use a lot of the juices.  Tonight it will be shredded with BBQ sauce to use it up.

Very easy to make.  Gravy is salty, but does not overwhelm the meat.  Served with Garlic Mashed Potatoes Secret Recipe (from this site) and gravy tasted very good on the potatoes.  Overall, good recipe.  Will make again.

The best thing about this was the tenderness of the pork...perfect.  The flavor/taste, however, was dreadful.  I can't even describe what was wrong with it.  Will never make again and I am a HUGE fan of garlic.

This is my go to recipe. Anyone who doesn’t rate this 5 stars has something wrong with their taste buds. I’ve made it for family, friends, coworkers, etc and have not met a person who didn’t rave about it and beg for the recipe. Serve with egg noodles, bread, and a side veggie like carrots. Mmmmm, so good.

Maybe it was me or the pork tenderloin but it was not good. I was looking forward to eating this but it was lacking flavor and just was not what I expected. I did it exactly as written too

Followed the recipe except used pork loin. Too much onion soup mix and too much garlic. Will cut out the soup mix and use onion instead and about 1/2 the garlic

I agree with the person who said it ruins a great cut of meat. We did not like it. It tasted very “flat”, like it needed something. My husband, who likes bland foods didn’t even care for it! Oh well. I’ll just not save this one.

Frankly, this was a disappointment, although I was able to salvage it.  I followed the recipe but took the advice to stick slivers of garlic in the meat.  I also used the substitute for the onion soup mix suggested by one of the reviewers.  The meat turned out a bit dry - don't know how that could happen when cooking in liquid in a crockpot, but the really bad part was that the sauce had a bitter aftertaste.  With company coming, I was desperate.  I added honey to the liquid, and the result was good.  But I doubt if I will make this again.  There are better recipes for pork tenderloin.

great recipe, easy and delicious. yes, pork loin roast is sometimes too good to use in a crock pot but to each their own.

I cooked on low for 6.5hrs and then strained the liquid, added corn starch and served over french fries and cheese to make crock pot poutine. I had leftover Pinot Noir in fridge so it paired well with the ingredients. will certainly make again.

Yummy!!! I used my Ninja slow cooker (The oven setting is same as high on crockpot) The 21/2 lb pork loin roast was very moist, the meat was pink & perfect. I used the gravy drippings after I separated them from the grease and added the 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and made a delicious gravy and I also made a 2 lb pork loin roast in the oven and did not get any juices from it that I could make a gravy like I did using a slow cooker. Thanks for sharing! I can’t take a picture because it’s gone!

The pork tenderloin I had was a bit smaller than than the recommendation size in the recipe so mine wasn’t quite as tender as I had hoped. Because I wasn’t home, it cooked the full 4 hours. Next time, I’ll make adjustments if needed but I will try again.

This turned out to be really good. I thought it was full of flavor (I used Better than Bullion instead of plain water), which might have punched it up. Before serving, I put the liquids on the stove and added cornstarch to thicken it up and that was delicious over mashed cauliflower. Easy to make, uses pantry staples, so this is a keeper.

This was delicious, though a tad salty (due to the onion mix). Adjusted the second time to use 1 c. red wine (whatever you have on hand - I've used a Montepulciano and Chianti, both were great!) and an additional half cup of water. I also added some diced fresh sweet onions the second time, and they softened nicely.  Also, I strained the sauce and thickened with  2 Tbsp of cornstarch mixed with just enough water to dissolve and breakup clumps.

I didnt have the onion soup or minced garlic, so I use Au Jus and minced up about 5 garlic bulbs (probably wrong wording) . I added garlic salt and some Tony Chachere's.

This? This recipe turned out FANTASTIC. The first time I used a pork tenderloin, and just doubled the amounts of everything to make sure there was enough (we were expecting guests).  The trick, I found, to making sure all the pork was tender was to chop it up into half-fist sized chunks.  Due to oversight, a couple of ingredients were different - half of the red wine was Sangria, and half of the soy sauce was actually teriyaki sauce. 

The second time, I used a pork shoulder roast, carving off chunks of the meat and then just dropping the whole bone into the sauce to cook for the full time.  Everything came out tender and moist and delicious all over.  It was really easy to remove the meat left on the bone from it with just a fork, it was so tender.

I had a couple of 2lb tenderloins, so doubled the recipe, and added my own quirks.  Rubbed the tenderloins with my favorite rub, and seared them briefly in a cast iron skillet to get a nice dark crust started, then put them on top of a bed of onions and mushrooms, added the soup mix, subbed vegetable broth for the water, and added a sliced jalapeno and sweet red pepper.  Added the red wine and garlic.  Smelled heavenly while cooking, and delivered wonderful flavor.  Served with fried rice and the cooking liquids on the side.  It was a hit with my guests, who were both more seasoned cooks than I.

The recipe was good I did add red and green bell peppers and instead of red wine I used cooking Sherry that's all I had it turned out well. I did cook it a little longer than 4 hours because of my slow cooker...but it was juicy and tender.

I made this last night.  We are not fans of soy sauce, so I left that out.  My husband and i both loved it!  Very favorful, very tender and overall luscious.  One of latest favorites.  I will definitely make it again.

Ok, I am NOT a pork person. I’ve tried it soooo many different ways and I just am not a fan. But this with the au juis was an absolute hit. I only used 1 lb of loin because that’s all I had in the freezer but everything else I did exactly as the recipe calls for. I used Cabernet for the wine as I prefer to cook with that type. Will definitely be on rotation in our home.

UPDATED 12/11/19
I did basically the same thing as the first time,  but added sautéed onions with the mushrooms.  As another reviewer did, I made a rub of the spices (added smoked paprika - use sparingly) and  seared the pork, added garlic slivers  into it. Didn't use wine (don't like it, I'm boring) , used Worcestershire sauce and one cup of chicken boullion instead. . Cut up russet potatoes and carrots. Made a gravy with flour and water and it was so good.  All in all, this is REALLY good!  Made two tenderloins for the leftovers. Will definitely make this again; maybe I'll try it with chicken breasts or pork chops. Thanks!

Everyone loved the flavor, but 4 hours on low is way too long for a 2 lb pork tenderloin. The meat was terribly dry. Next time I will use a pork loin roast.

I loved this recipe and so did my family.  I cooked about a half hour longer than suggested.  It was very tasty!  When my husband really likes something he says it needs more practice!  He said it needed more practice!

I used a can of French onion soup and omitted the dry mix and one cup  of water.  Super easy to make, smelled great while cooking, and my 16 year old son gobbled it down (mom and dad liked it too). I also used a pork roast instead of tenderloin but that was only bc  the store didn't have any unseasoned tenderloins in stock

It was really good, and my whole family loved it.  I will definitely do this one again.  Plenty of left overs for sandwiches!  I used two tenderloins.  It was amazing the amount of meat we got. 
Very tasty.

I followed the recipe  closely. It was disappointing. The pork was dry; the onion soup flavor was obvious. Yes, it was an easy recipe, but it showed the corner cutting in the result. Will not make again.

It wasn’t bad but found it extremely salty.      If I was to make this dish again, I would use a chopped up onion instead of onion soup mix and like others, I would use a cheaper cut of pork.

This recipe was really good! I used a pork roast instead and a Moscato white since I'm not a big wine drinker and that's what I had in my fridge lol The flavors were really nice and I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was amazing.  Melted in your mouth with flavor. My one word of advise would be if u use two 1lb loins instead of what recipe calls for, cut cook time. I also used a little wondra to thicken au jus just a little. Will definitely keep this recipe around for awhile.

change up slightly in the recipe. 1) coat the tenderloin on all sides with DRY onion/mushroom soup mix, vacuum seal and 
refrigerate overnight then proceed with the red wine and garlic and soy sauce and an 8 hour cook followed by a 45 minute rest  wrapped in foil before slicing.......YUM

I have made this twice now, and everyone loves it (even the picky 5 year old)!  

I did not use a tenderloin either time, just a cheaper picnic pork roast and used low sodium soy sauce, both times it came out super tender and delicious.  It is such a simple recipe, and is now in regular rotation at our house.

I was skeptical of using a tenderloin and only 4 hrs in the crockpot. Being a restaurant cook, it went against the techniques I knew but it totally surprised me. It was cooked to a perfect 160°. I thickened the au jus with cornstarch for a lovely gravy for the meat and mashed potatoes. My husband and I could not stop eating it! I will definitely make this again. Great for making for company.

I've made this many times with various cuts of pork. I typically take the pork out and then make a gravy with the leftover juice.  I serve it with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables. The recipe is pretty perfect as is.

5 stars for ease and simplicity of ingredients. Very flavorful and on the salty side (fine by me). I used just half a cup of water to create a richer sauce. Served with brown rice and garlic and red pepper flakes sugar snap peas. Delish!

I baked for 1 hour. We had a tenderloin so I didn’t want to crockpot it. Used half the onion soup mix. Very good with a baked potato.

Made this exactly as listed BUT the timing for cooking was not even close to having the meat done. I ended up cooking another 4 hours on low. Maybe I have a strange slow cooker, but the next time I'll just start it earlier in the morning. The taste was excellent!

This was amazing. I’ve made it twice over the last couple of  months. The meat is so tender, it literally melts in your mouth. Four hours on low and it turns out perfect.

I've made it twice. The first time my son eat all the left overs. My husband did't get to have any so he had me cook two the next time and I was even better the second time I made it and I didn't do anything different. It will become a monthly dinner in my home.

Very good! Used a Costco pork tenderloin package, substituted chicken stock for the water, which probably gave it fuller body. Agree with an earlier comment that red wine (not cooking wine) is key--used grenache, which turned out to be a super choice. Fall-apart tender and juicy. This will be an easy favorite. Thanks for the recipe, chowsito!

The family loved this and requests it now. I find it difficult to fine exactly 2 lbs of pork loin, it's usually closer to 3 lbs. So I put in 1 cup of red wine and 1 & 1/4 cup of water and and extra dash of soy sauce and it came out great! Put in some potatoes for a nicely marinated starch.

The au jus was very good, but the meat was kind of dry. If we didn’t have the jus to smother the meat this would have not been a good meal at all. I’ll probably try another recipe next time for pork tenderloin.

I did not use onion soup mix and added sliced mushrooms the last hour in the crockpot. I cooked low for 4.5 hours which was too long so the pork was not as moist as we would have liked. I would end cooking at 4 hours. We sliced the pork and served with smashed potatoes and French style green beans. Very flavourful!

Very good and easy recipe!  I followed the exact recipe this time, but would cut back on the amount of liquid for the next time.  I cooked on low (the 8 hour setting) for a bit over 4 hours and it was perfect.  My whole family enjoyed it.  I've been sending this recipe to all of my busy mom friends :)

I used more garlic, but that's personal preference.  I also highly recommend Goodman's Soup mix, not Lipton's, for less salty taste.  This is really worth making just for the juice!  We put that on everything.  But the pork came out fantastic and went too quickly!

I cooked this as prescribed and it tasted like pot roast, not terrific.  This was a waste of a great pork tenderloin - took all the good flavor out and inserted mediocrity!

I honestly don’t understand why people think this is so salty.  This turned out perfectly.  I subbed chicken broth for red wine.  Added cornstarch to sauce to thicken it after everything was cooked.

Wonderful.  Has been added to my easy comfort food.  I used boneless spare ribs instead of whole loin since there is only 2 of us.   I used one whole garlic clove, lightly crushed, instead of minced as a family member can't eat garlic chunks.

The pork was tender but it shrunk it tremendously. Nobody in the family liked the flavour.

OMG !!!!!!!!!! This is beyond delicious !  I had bought a Smithfield Roasted Garlic and Herb pork tenderloin and really didn't want to just put it in the oven and make pork gravy.  I found this recipe and used red cooking wine (found it at the local grocery store) and followed directions as written.  I had fresh white onion I bought this summer and had freezer saved so I put that in.  I cooked the pork on low for 8 hrs.  I scooped out the juice and put it in a sauce pan and used tapioca starch mixed with a little water poured that in and thickened up the gravy.  My husband loved it !  You could cut the pork with a fork.  We had purple sweet potato's and green beans along with the pork and gravy.  DELICIOUS !!!!!!!!!! Thank You for the recipe !!

This did indeed keep the pork loin moist - always my biggest challenge.  And, it was tasty.

I used fresh garlic and onions (as I didn't have the jarred minced stuff or soup mix).   4 hours on high as well.   I used some old wine in my fridge, and the smell in the house was a bit overpowering, so I wasn't expecting much, but it turned out great.  Thanks for the suggestions!

I prepared the Loin in the Crock Pot the night before, juice and all.  I doubled the recipe for a 5 lb. Loin.
  I added 1-1/2 Tablespoon Siracha.  Used Chicken Broth and a Tablespoon White Vinegar since I had no Red Wine.  Pierced Loin in about 12 spots and added a very small clove of Garlic in each hole.  I used squeeze bottle Minced Garlic out of laziness and for convenience.  After I poured the Juice in, I SCOOPED THE GARLIC OUT OF THE BOWL AND STRATEGICALLY PLACED IT ALL OVER THE TOP OF THE LOIN.  (Sorry about all caps.)
  Turned Crock Pot on low before I left for work and when I returned 9 hours later I could smell it as soon as I stepped into the attached garage.  (Seven hours would have been plenty as my internal temp was just just a little higher than preferred.)  I served it with Sauteed Mushrooms and Brown Pork Gravy and a side of Creamy Super Buttery Mashed Potatoes.  Needless to say it was very very delicious!!
  Would have added pics if I knew how

The pork tenderloin was very dry.  Perhaps a pork loin roast would be a better choice.  Will not make this recipe again.

I was afraid my 12 year old would not like this because he didn’t like the look of it, but he did. My husband and I also liked this a lot. It was easy to make - I took the liquid out and put it in a pan with some mixed cornstarch and water to thicken it for a gravy. I made this with mashed potatoes and it went together very well. I don’t think it would have been nearly as good without the potatoes and gravy.

I used pork loin (not tenderloin) and low-sodium soy sauce, and slow cooked on low for about 8-9 hours--that must be a typo in the cooking time! The taste of the wine was a little strong for me, but overall the meat was tasty and tender!  Next time I will use less wine and dilute with a broth.

I disagree with some of the reviews.  If you are a cook,  you can look at the ingredients and tell if the sodium level is going to be high. Also, if you use a cooking wine, cut out all other salt, as they are heavy in sodium, as another reviewer mentioned.  So, rather than trash the recipe, adapt for what you think will be too much.  I did use a 2.47 pound pork tenderloin from my local grocery, which is wrapped in a plastic wrapper, not a high end pork tenderloin from our local butcher.  They were B1G1, so it was too good a deal to pass up.  I followed the recipe, but adapted.  No one in our house has a sodium problem, but I don't like excess sodium, so I used a lower sodium version of the onion soup mix, used reduced sodium soy sauce, and drizzled a very small amount (maybe 1-2 tsp) of hickory syrup and maple syrup on top of the meat before cooking.  Since my crockpot has 4 and 6 for high and 8 and 10 for low, I turned it to high for 4 hours.  After that, I turned it to warm until it was time to eat.  My daughter was home when it finished and she did not know what we were doing with it so she shredded it for sandwiches.  It was a delicious mistake!  Next time, I will leave it whole and cut into slices and serve with potatoes and a green vegetable.  This time it was served with brioche buns, sliced onion and slices of cheese.  I will tweak the recipe a little each time, to come up with new flavor combinations we like.  I can see this with sage, thyme and rosemary in the late

It was very tender and juicy! It was a bit on the salty side for me, so I may alter the onion soup mix slightly.  My husband loved it, so this will be a keeper.

My Hisband and I loved this!!  I made this as written using  a pork loin roast.  After 3 hours on low, I added 1 can of sliced mushrooms, cut baby carrots, cut celery and 1/2 cut up yellow onion.  This was perfect with cut up baked potatoes.  .  I kept the ‘au jus’  separate.  With the left overs I made pork loin dips., with sautéed mushroom, onion and garlic, provolone  and rolls with deli mustard.

No alcohol,so used chicken stock in place of water+wine.Changed temp. to high 4-6 hrs. Low 8 hrs. Added some hard veggies and made gravy at the end of cooking. Besides that I would'nt change a thing. exellant meal. Very homey and comforting .would surely make again.

We did not think the soy added much flavor but did add to the salt. Next time I’m going to try adding a little honey to cut the salt and acid. Overall good.

I was very excited to make this after seeing the reviews, and I have to agree with the others saying that you shouldn't slow cook a pork tenderloin.  This was downright bad....

My Whole family LOVES this recipe!!! My children can’t get enough of it. ( My children are picky eaters too!) My husband loves it soo much, I have to make 4 lbs of pork (double the recipe). Only thing I do differently is double the water ( 2 cups instead of 1 cup). That way it is super moist. If you have leftovers I take the extra cooked juice from the crockpot to the Rubbermaid container. That way when you reheat the leftovers, the tenderloin isn’t dried out. I also prepare the dish the night before, 10 min prep time if that. Next morning take it out of the  refrigerator, put the crockpot on low and move on with your day until dinner time. Perfect meal for a working family that wants a good filling dinner without the hassle. If you are still on the fence about making this meal, go ahead and make it!!!! You won’t be disappointed. **** Side note, if you add 2 cups of baby carrots to the recipe, they come out amazing too. ****

I made this as written and it was very bland and boring. I was apologizing all through dinner even though my boys kept saying ‘it’s fine, Mom.’ I threw half of my dinner away and did not save the leftovers. Will not make this again

Changes were made, I had no onion mix so I subbed in diced onion along with this garlic steak  mixture I found at the spice rack. I was a guest in another home. Anyway, I had left to go home and I received a call from them stating how delicious their dinner turned out.
The only thing they said was that there was too much liquid.

Loved it!  I don't usually like red wine.  I used Marsala cooking wine, which is a bit sweeter.  My slow cooker doesn't have a high or low, it has a 1,2,3,4,5.  I cooked it for 3 hrs at 3, and it was a bit overdone.  Luckily there was plenty of liquid, so I sliced the meat and let it soak in.  It tasted delicious.

I followed the instructions exactly, except I added some sliced onion on top over the minced garlic and I gave it an extra 15 minutes because my pork tenderloin weighed a little more than two pounds. The result was indeed amazingly tender, moist and tasty. It calls for a nice sourdough bread to sop up the jus.

This was pretty good. I sprinkled the dry onion soup on top of the tenderloin, which made it too salty. Next time, I'll put the dry onion soup in the gravy.

Very delicious and savory! The tenderloin just fell apart when taking it out of the slow cooker. I also added some halved red potatoes about 1 hr prior to serving and they were great. Soaked up some of the sauce but there was still plenty for serving!

I adjusted the amount of soy sauce and used less soup mix, adding my own additional onion and garlic. It was a hit!  I will make it again.

This recipe is delicious! I made this the night before making Pork Dip Sandwiches.  The next day I thinly sliced the Pork Loin.  I buttered and applied granulated garlic to both sides of sliced french bread added canned chopped green chiles and used the broth from the cooked pork tenderloin as our Au Jus.  We all loved it.  Definitely a keeper.

Simple and easy. I made it as the recipe says to. Except after it was cooked i removered the roast from the crockpot and added some cornstarch to the broth to try and thicken it up a bit to make more of a gravey out of it and put that on my pork and mash potatoes. It was very tasty. My picky 12 year old even ate all that I put on his plate. I will definitely make this again.

THE BEST pork tenderloin I've ever had - except for one thing.  Would it be wiser to mix the soup mix in with the liquids before adding to the crockpot? I wonder if the salty nature of the finished product is because the soup mix is put directly on the tenderloins before the liquid is added.  Next time, I'll try that and see if it makes a difference.  Nonetheless, I love the flavor (just a little too intense with the salt) and would recommend this recipe.

This is ridiculously good. I used a bit more garlic because my family eats garlic like candy. Our tenderloin was a bit larger (about 3 lbs.) so it cooked for about 5 1/2-6 hours but it was so good and so tender. Not sure I can ever make it any other way again!!

Amazing  Flavor.  I did cook on low for 3 extra hours to get extra tender. After 4 it was still kind of tough.  Loved it!

This was AMAZING! My family and I loved it.  Very flavorful and juicy. I doubled the ingredients, to have  extra sauce for the mashed potatoes. I also cooked it on High for 4 hours and then let it simmer on warm for about 45 minutes while I finished making the  sides.

I used a pork loin not a tenderloin. It was so tender that I was unable to make slices when I cut it so we just at it shredded. There seemed to be something missing in the flavor. It was just ok. I will try again only spicing it up a bit.

The time to cook this is way too long, the meat was very dry.  I cooked it on low like the instructions said.  I think it you lower the time, it would be great, I just don't know for how long.

Made it according to the recipe.  I might try make a gravy from the liquid to serve over the pork slices when I make this again.  The meat was not overcooked but cooked it in less time.  Love the flavor.

Wow. Easy and delicious! My tenderloin fell apart before I could slice it, so we ate it that way. I added some barbecue sauce to the leftovers and we had delicious barbecue pork sandwiches!

Easy and awesome! Even my picky eater likes it (the other kids and husband love it). I use one of those single serving wine bottles (often Sutter Home merlot) and use reduced sodium soy sauce. We serve it with rice, mashed potatoes or noodles and a “winter” vegetable. Super easy and very tasty. I wish more recipes were this easy and great tasting.

We will totally make this again. I did add 1/2 a chicken bullion cube, Worchester sauce, and Italian seasoning. I actually left the garlic cloves whole and let them simmer with the juice. This came out so good! 
I served riced cauliflower on the side and used the juice from the  pork to flavor it. SO GOOD! Low carb, low calorie, HIGH flavor! Loved it.

Whenever I cook tender meats either in the oven or crock pot I always sear it. In the case of pork tenderloin i pre-marinate it then I sear it and then I put it in the crock pot with some chicken stock and elevate it on a bed of onions

I totally agree with lizzitish.  NEVER  cook pork tender in a crockpot!  This might have been good with a pork butt although pretty bland. Instead it was blah and dry.

This is really good served with mashed potatoes. I'm making this again and the only change I'm making is that I'm using pork tri-tip. It's been my experience that pork tenderloin dries out from getting overcooked in the crockpot.

I made this exactly as written, and it was delicious!  While the roast rested, I strained the drippings into a sauce pan and added 1c milk mixed with 1 tbsp flour to make a gravy.  This got rave reviews from my family, and I'll be making it again.  Thanks!

It was really good. I was worried it'd be too salty but I was wrong.
Used my own home made red wine. It was even better the second day.

Family loved it!  I cooked on low for 7 hours, then took out the pork to rest and added cornstarch for the gravy.  Delicious!  could have added casrrots or green beans and small potatoes to make complete meal.  It was too much garlic so I would cut back next time.

I was unimpressed by this recipe. I'd rather roast my pork tenderloin. Family ate it no problem but I didn't really enjoy it.

We loved the flavor of the roast but the gravy made from the cooking liquid was VERY salty. I used low sodium soy, made my own dry onion soup mix without salt because of other reviews that said it was too salty. I will make again but will try using 1/4 to 1/2 of the cooking liquid and unsalted beef broth to make the gravy. Hubby said the roast is a keeper but not the gravy. As other reviewers, I used a pork loin roast and cooked it on low for about 6 hours. Thanks for the recipe!

I did use pork tenderloin because I found it on sale. Excellent recipe. I like salt but neither I nor my wife found this too salty. The juice made an excellent gravy.  I stuck with the recipe but added both white and sweet potatoes in with the roast. I was worried 4hours on low was not long enough when adding the potatoes so I cooked on high for 1 1/2 on high and about three on low.

takes longer than 4 hours on low - and my tenderloin is less than 1.5 lbs.  internal temp should be about 180, after 4 hours temp was barely 150.  put it in the oven till it comes up to the correct cook time.  also, 3 tbsp minced garlic is too much for my taste.

I would have given this 5 stars because the flavor was amazing.  It was, however, a little dry even serving with au jus.  I would like to try it again and cook it for less time maybe?

As I did not have dry onion soup, added raw onion. And I did not have garlic, so used 2 teaspoons garlic powder. The loin was partially frozen so cooked on low for 8 hours; the meat just fell apart. Made the gravy and all was delicious.

I have made this several times. My elderly mom just loves this. Instead of wine, I use broth. Otherwise, I don't usually make changes, except to add matchstick carrots to the liquid. Yummy dish that I serve with potatoes or pasta or rice. I use the liquid as au jus and pour over whatever starch we are having. My mom calls this a "keeper", which is her ultimate compliment to a recipe.

After reading a few reviews, I made some adjustments. I made a pork rub that consisted of salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder and then seared the pork before putting it into the crock pot. Since I did not use the onion soup mix, I added 1/4 cup water and 3/4 cup red wine (Merlot because that is what I had open), 3 bay leaves, half an onion sliced, and low sodium soy sauce (amount adjusted since I used less liquid). I cooked it in the crock pot on high for 2 hours then turned it down to low for another 2 hours (I think it would have been fine on low for 4 hours).

This is now one of our favorite crockpot dishes.  The only thing I did different was cook it a little longer on low.  My crockpot will only let you set the cooking time to 6 hours on low so that is what I did,  It was amazing.

Delicious! I was worried about the combo of red wine and soy sauce, but it really worked. I added in small potatoes, carrots, and whole mushrooms. Yum!

I made this today- what an easy recipe that is perfect for a lazy, rainy Sunday! I took others’ suggestions and used a 3 lb. pork roast instead of a tenderloin, which is a great cut for the grill but wasted on a slow cooker. I also used low sodium soy sauce and my red wine was Cabernet Sauvignon. I cooked it for 6 hours on low. It was wonderfully tender and I lifted it from the crock in one piece using a spatula. I sliced it and it fell apart, so I could’ve easily shredded it instead. I had enough juice to make some gravy and kept some for au jus, since my husband isn’t a gravy lover. Even my fussy boys loved it! I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans. I recommend this for an easy slow cooker meal (and the leftovers are going to make tasty sandwiches.)

The flavor was great, but I think a tenderloin in the slow cooker is a waste of prime meat. I will make this again, following the recipe to the letter, but I will use a less expensive cut of pork.

The pork was very tender but the sauce didn't do it for me. It needed more salt for my taste. I tried to thicken it as someone had suggested but it still fell a little flat. I will try this again with less sauce; maybe second time's a charm.

I sauteed red onions and mushrooms in butter, and added it to the stock, thickening it with cornstarch and water while the tenderloin was resting.  I cut the tenderloin, surrounded it with roasted spaghetti squash, and drizzled it with the thckened mushroom-onion stock. Yummy!

I made this pretty much spot on to what the recipe called for.  However, Since it was just my wife and I, I only used one pound of pork loin and reduced the cooking time to 3.5 hours.  Just delicious.

I made this according to the recipe. It was very easy, and delicious! Had my mother in laws 89th birthday here. Pork is her favorite. After she had this meal she said it would be hard for me to top this! I served it with roasted acorn squash with butter and brown sugar and roasted baby Yukon golds in olive oil and sea salt. Perfect fall meal!

I tried to make this with a onion soup substitute per recommendations. Was concerned onion soup would be too salty. Turns out I was wrong. Making a “substitute” left it with no flavor. May try another time w soup mix.

Easy to make and directions easy. Pork is often very tough due to its leanness, but not this time. This pork loin was perfect, moist and with a great taste. I'll make this again and enjoy the wide variety of recipes on this web site.

I will not make this again.  It turned out kinda dry and bland.  I thought the "slow cooker recipes" were easy and good, but perhaps the slowcooker is not my forte...

I made this tonight for my "picky" kids and they both absolutely loved it. I'd cut down on the garlic a bit next time but otherwise I'd make it exactly like the recipe called for. I'm definitely going to make it again!!!!

The onion soup mix, wine, soy sauce, and garlic combined to create a very tasty broth and flavorful meat. I used my InstantPot pressure cooker, browning the meat before adding the ingredients. I set the pressure cooker for 30 minutes for the 2 pieces of tenderloin (totaling 2.45 lbs).
This recipe is a keeper!

Good taste and very tender, almost difficult to slice; almost more of a "pulled pork".  Thickened the sauce and served it over mashed potatoes.

This was easy and delicious.  I would cut the soy a bit maybe by 1-2 teaspoons because the gravy seemed a bit salty for our taste.  I needed to make a double recipe, since my slow cooker is larger and the liquid and meat from one recipe didn't reach the minimum line.  Cooking two tenderloins/double recipe was easy, and since the two of us only eat one half of a t'loin in a sitting, I cut the second t'loin in half, put each of the three pork halves in a Ball pint (wide-mouth) freezer jar, covered all to the top with the juice (there was plenty left), and we have 3 frozen meals ready to go.  Only need to make a pilaf and veggie to complete each meal.  Using Ball freezer canning jars is the perfect way to freeze up soups, too!  Buy Ball's plastic screw caps for the jars.

I am not a big fan of crock pot cooking, therefore, I missed the beautiful, tasty browned roast from the oven.  But,  I must say, the flavor was wonderful with all the onions and spices added and the au jus was much better the second day.  Thanks for this recipe; I will probably brown my roast next time before putting in the crock pot.

This was delicious, but next time, I won't leave the minced garlic on top of the meat, or I will make it into a paste and coat the top of the meat.  I might also brown the meat before I put it in the crockpot, if I have time, to add even more depth to the sause.  Overall, this will become a new staple in my kitchen.

I added my own twist to the recipe. I followed the recipe, however, I did like one of the other reviewers suggested & I stuffed the pork with sliced garlic. I also added red potatoes to the slow cooker during the last 2 hours of cooking. My husband & I enjoyed if. Our sons did. It not like the flavor.

I used a pork butt roast, cheap piece of meat.  My husband said this was the best pork roast he has ever eaten!  I did not use red wine because did not have on hand.  I did follow the rest of ingredients, kept turning roast as it cooked!  This will be my go to recipe.  I am using leftovers for breakfast burritos, pizza with bbq sauce, endless possibilities!

This was absolutely fantastic!  My husband went on-and-on about it.  He said this meal was so good it would have cost $20 a person at a restaurant.  That's pretty expensive considering that a meal at a restaurant normally costs us $9.00 or $10.00 a person.  So, he was very impressed, and it makes me happy to know I cooked us a very good meal.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will definitely be making this again!

Gluten free version just as amazing!  I sprinkled sea salt, garlic salt, onion powder and pepper on 2 pork loins then browned them  on the stove (I can't find gluten free onion soup mix).  I used the red wine (a mini merlot that comes in a 4 pack which are great for cooking) to deglaze the pan, and added the soy sauce and a 1/2 cup of water to slow cooker.  I also added 3/4 can of gluten free cream of mushroom soup (found at Whole Foods) and a chopped onion.  Cooked on 325 for about 2 hours then lowered to 250 for a couple of hours.  Added a little cornstarch mixed with water to make gravy at the end.  Yum!!!

Simply marvelous!  I think using tenderloin is definitely the way to go.  No fat and no waste!  Easy  peasy to make. This is a keeper and I will make it again soon. Loved it.

I'm always afraid to cook tenderloin in the slow cooker.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this recipe works. I've made this a number of times and browning adds flavor and helps the cooking time.  I usually use a 1-2 pound tenderloin so I  watch the cooking time and check internal temperature at around 3 hours.  I also added a mixture of beef broth and red wine. The meat has always been tender and delicious.

Followed the recipe other than adding some dried rosemary and thyme (and omitting salt on other reviewers' advice).  Seared the pork first then cooked 4 hours on high, came out fork-tender and plenty flavorful.  Served it with fried taters and onions with the thickened juices poured over.  Hubby had 2 plates!  A keeper for sure!

Wow!  Getting this recipe in my All Recipes e-mail was perfect timing!  A recent sale on pork tenderloin caused us to have an abundance, so I wanted some variety.  This recipe was so easy yet so elegant!  Thickened the sauce at the end with a little cornstarch and served it over rice, with some caramelized sweet  potatoes and sautéed spinach for a meal that all 4 of us found delicious.

I made this using two 1lb pork loins.  I cooked for 4 hours on low and I thought the meet was a bit dry and overlooked.  I would have given this recipe 3 stars only but  my girlfriend disagreed about the dryness of the meat and even ate the leftovers until there was none and that  NEVER happens.

Will make again as it's delicious, especially with the broth spooned over it.

Likely would add veggies like potatoes & carrots to the slow cooker as well.

I made a 4 1/2 pound pork loin roast.  I doubled the  liquid and seasonings.  I did not change any of the ingredients. I used Black Box Merlot for the wine.  I believe there is a typo about cooking time. When you cook on low heat it is almost always going to be 8 hours.  High heat is 4 hours. I strained the liquid and put it in a pan and added some water with cornstarch dissolved to make a gravy.  The gravy made the roast and my potatoes delicious.  I am not a real fan of just the meat without the gravy. It was very garlicky without the gravy.  My husband said make it again! Typically his comments are "It's not bad."  So him saying that is something.  I highly recommend making gravy with the juice. Make sure to strain the liquid though.  The liquid is pretty salty so don't add any.  I even used low sodium soy sauce.  The majority of all that salt is coming from the onion soup packets.  Being salty it was still very good and I hate over salted foods.

This was delicious.  I had two 1 1/2 lb tenderloins that I cooked side by side.  I used the same amount of everything else called for in the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to heat up some of the Au Jus with a tablespoon of Tapioca starch to make a gravy.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Everybody loved it.  Pork shredded on the fork and had amazing flavor.

A previous reviewer suggested cooking it on high for 4 hours.  Do not do this.  I used boneless pork loin (not tenderloin) and cooked on high for four hours, and it completely dried it out.  I had to toss the whole pot.

I didn't have onion soup mix, but saw another reviewer used onions instead, so I did that. I also didn't have wine and Google said a sub for that was chicken broth, so I did that too. I would think the broth would have added some saltiness, but I found irt still needed some. Cooked on time and very tender. The onions really gave the juice some extra flavour. Will make again, but next time with wine. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is a great recipe!  For those that felt the original recipe was a little bland, may I suggest substituting the soy sauce with Hoisin Sauce.  I have only used this recipe with this substitute.  A hit with everyone in the family.

This was fantastic! I didn't have onion soup mix, so I sorta 'winged it' (sprinkled paprika, garlic salt, celery salt and parsley on it when I seared it, then added the water and beef boullion cubes to the drippings), and coarsely chopped some onions to put in the crock. Used a merlot.... and OMGosh! It was so yummy, I had to force myself to quit dipping it in the juices and eating it! :D

holy cow, maybe somewhere in all these reviews there is an explanation as to why I should have used 3 tablespoons of garlic!!! What a terrible flavor AND after taste. I used pork tenderloin, cooked it for 4 hours on low, followed recipe exactly and I hated it.
I didn't think my taste buds were this bad, terrible.

My family loved this pork recipe so much that I tried it with a London Broil in the crockpot since the red wine seemed a perfect fit. I used Beefy onion soup with the beef but left everything else the exact same and my family loved it even more. My son had 3 servings and can't wait to eat the leftovers.

We made this as a family tonight. We love to find easy recipes to use as we are trying to teach our 9 year old and 7 year old how to cook simple meals. We followed the recipe for the most part.

We aren't wine users so we substituted it for Red Grape Juice.

We double the recipe

For the garlic we made a garlic paste so it would stick on top of the loin. We took the called for amount of minced garlic and heated it for 3-4 minutes on high until nice and soft. took the same number of tablespoons of mustard and added the garlic to it and then added a romano and herb cheese seasoning (to taste) to the garlic and mustard and made a paste out of it. Once good and soft we spooned it on the meat and let it it cook the full 4 hours.

My kids who are typically picky eaters loved the meat and we served it along side mashed potatoes. 

I'd say we have a "winner winner, chicken dinner."

I made this last week and was a little skeptical. I've never cooked with wine (and I don't drink it either), but followed another user's review and got a Cabernet Sauvignon  I also used a pork roast instead of a tenderloin. It turned out amazing.  It was so good that I plan on making it again this week.

Company good!!! Figure about 1/2 lb./person.  Serve with brown rice (drizzled with the au jus), and pair with pinot noir.

I really wanted this to be as amazing as it sounded however, it was way too salty, and I love salt.  It smelled better than it tasted.  The meat came out very moist and tender though.  Maybe it would be better without the soy sauce.

Meh.  But, I agree it should be 4 hours on high, or 8 on low, like any slow cooker recipe.

Made recipe as stated.  It came out dry and salty.  Wouldn't make it again. Don't know if the onion soup mix made it salty or the soy sauce.

This was really good. I think next time I will leave it in the slow cooker a little longer but my husband thought it was perfect already. I sautéed up some mushrooms right before serving and added them with the gravy over top. Definitely making this again and again.

Like others I also used herbs(rosemary, sage, tarragon, garlic, onion) with olive oil and seared it in a pan before placing in the slow cooker.  I used the lipton onion & mushroom soup mix and also used a pinot noir as my wine.  Instead of water I used chicken broth.  The soy sauce I used was reduced sodium and I only used 1/2 tbls. I also threw in a splash of apple cider vinegar.  Sounds like a lot of stuff but, it made for a very tasty pork tenderloin.  Cooked on high for an hour and the other three hours on low.

Made exactly like the recipe recommended (except used white wine).  My very picky eater loved it!  The rest of the family wanted more.  No leftovers.  This will be made time and time again.

Giving this 5 stars just because it sounds amazing. I'm making it today for a dinner and am using 2 pork tenderloins at 2 lbs each, so I was wondering if I just double the ingredients and cooking time or should any changes be made for a bigger batch.

This recipe is so easy and delicious.  At first I thought it was a little on the salty side even though I used low sodium soy sauce but since  I tend to use very little salt in cooking, I think my taste buds are accustomed to that.  After a few bites I didn't even notice the salt. I made a couple of minor changes.  I put some thinly sliced onions in the bottom of the crock pot and used a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end.  Will definitely make again

I didn't care for this dish. I followed the recipe to the letter. I probably should've tweaked it with more seasoning. I can't put my finger on the exact reason why me or my husband did like it...we just  didn't like the flavor. And it wasn't as tender as we thought it would be.  If you try it....Add more seasoning.

It smelled amazing, and the texture was great.  However, even though I followed the recipe as instructed, the taste was really bland.  The flavor in the meat disappeared as well.

I followed the recipe after reading the wonderful ratings. I used low salt soy sauce. The tenderloin was 2.69 pounds which was not a problem for cooking. However, the meat tasted very beefy and was very chewy. One review stated that you should never put this cut of meat in a crockpot. After making this recipe I heartily agree. It ruined its taste and tenderness. Much tastier  to cook it at 425 degrees with a few spices and olive oil. Very disappointing. House still smells strongly of onions two days later!

Perfect recipe for pork loin.  I have made pork loin with a lot of different recipes, and this is in my top five.  I added cayenne to the recipe, only because I like a little fire in my cooking.

I made this exactly by the recipe in my 1978 Crock pot (yes it's burnt orange). Best pork loin recipe I've tried so far. I served it over coconut rice with a side of sauteed asparagus.

I did not like this recipe at all.  I thought the garlic was too strong and tainted the port completely.  However you should know that I only had pork loin chops so I put them as closely together as possible but the sauce clearly infiltrated every side of the chops.  I love garlic and more is usually always better.  I would reduce the garlic content.

Barely edible.  Did not smell good as it cooked and then tasted it at 4.5 hours, way, way too salty.  Have to figure out how to save my 2.5lb slab of salt meat.  I followed the recipe as is and did not make any changes which I should have done.  Will see if I can shred it into a pulled pork barbeque type dish or will incorporate into a saltless soup, maybe some lentils, whatever...  so disappointed.

This was tasty but dry. I cooked it on the second to lowest setting because I was worried that it wouldn't cook all the way through. I guess if I try it again I'll try the lowest setting. I'm open to other suggestions!

Delicious!! Very flavorful . But next time i think i will omit the soy sauce it was very potent the next day. I  Added a little more  of the liquids after i put pork in pot  it looked a little low. I  Used the left overs for french dip style sandwiches the next day. Big hit in my house  will make this again for sure!!

I made the onion soup recipe from this site for this recipe. It was delicious. Timing was perfect. Many times my pork is overlooked in the crock pot but this was perfect.

I had to improvise on this because my local store (only one in a 30 miles radius) only had pre-flavored pork loin. So I got the peppercorn and garlic one and didn't add any pepper or garlic just all other ingredients. It was so good and so tender. Cannot wait to me again

Good.  However, watch the cook time and you may want to scale the packaged soup mix if your meat isn't 2lbs. Thought my dish was salty. Shaved cook time by 30 minutes and it was perfect.

Made this recipe exactly as shown and it was terrific! Wouldn't change a thing. My husband loved it and is eating the left overs (which he usually doesn't). Great recipe, thank you.

I added carrots, a quartered onion, and mushrooms in the crockpot.  Served it with riced cauliflower.   Will make this again.

Made it in the oven, in a smallish casserole, since my crock pot is too large for the loin roast. 325 degrees for an hour, or a bit more. Checked with an instant-read thermometer for doneness. WAY TOO SALTY, using a whole onion soup mix packet. Perhaps halve it next time. Otherwise, great flavor and juiciness. Will make again with everything the same except the soup mix.

Perfect to warm you up on a cold winter's day.  I used one tablespoon of garlic instead of three and thickened the sauce at the end of the four hours with potato starch.   I will use less soy next time though.  I think it made the flavor a little too strong.  I served it with mashed potatoes and vegetables.  My husband loved it.  There will be a next time because it tastes so good.  And it's so easy to make! Definitely a winner!

I will definitely make this again.  It was so easy and we loved its flavour.  Very different from my usual roasted pork tenderloin and very well done so it melted in your mouth.  I guess because of the slow cooker.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because there was really too much sauce.  The combination of Soy sauce and garlic was wonderful.

I have found that there is no need to purchase onion soup mix since it's mostly dried onions and salt some Worchester...and also contains MSG. I just use dried onions and a few dashes of Worchester, and favorite herbs.  You can save money and have a healthier version of the same flavors. 
When crock pot cooking you can also use a less expensive cut of pork but will need to remove the excess fat from your drippings.

I thought this was pretty good, and my boyfriend loved it. I was a bit skeptical because it doesn't look all that appetizing in the slow cooker- kind of gray and boiled. But once you add the juice over the meat when serving it perks up. The flavor of the juice was great. Next time I'll try low sodium soy sauce. Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it makes a really wonderful, flavorful roast and broth. I used  cabernet sauvignon as the wine. I would make this using a darker meat cut of pork, like a pork butt, in the future, as we prefer the texture of the meat better after being cooked in the slow cooker, than the very lean cut of a loin roast.

We were so looking forward to this recipe.  We made it with a beautiful pork tenderloin and followed the directions exactly.  It was SO very dry we couldn't eat more than the first 1-2 bites.  The au jus was excellent but the pork was so dry that even the au jus couldn't help it.  I even cooked it on the low setting for just 4 hours.

Please, please would someone give me some advice on this as I haven't been using a crock pot for long.  Everything else I've made, so far,  in our new crock pot  has turned out great.  However, we were so disappointed with this meal.  Did I mention that it was very, very dry?  ;-)

I substituted a white wine for the red, still tasted amazing. I also used high setting for 2.5 hours instead of low for 4 hours.

It was very tasty and moist and cooked for 4 1/2 hours on low.  I did slice small slits in the tenderloin and pushed in sliced garlic about two cloves.  Company loved it.

Good taste, a little salty because of the soup mix. Would suggest a little more water. Also cook a little shorter because it was a little dry.

For more, favor, I used chicken stock instead of water and reduced the soy sauce 2 tablespoons to control the amount of sauce. I made gravy using the liquid.

This was super easy and delicious. The au jus was amazing. I thickened it for gravy.  There will be quite a bit left over, which I plan to put in a pot  of homemade vegetable soup. I will definitely will make this again!

Very good and I made as written but used a pork loin (need some fat and pork tenderloins are very lean).  I also put cut pieces  of garlic in the roast by making slits in the meat.  Thanks to the reviewer who made the suggestion.  Used low sodium soy sauce and a dry red wine.   Hubby gave it thumbs up so I will be making this recipe again.

I made this mostly according to the recipe, but I used a pork loin roast and I added herbes de Provence. I used low sodium soy sauce and was glad I did, since it was almost too salty as it was. The meat tasted fantastic, but it was tough. Maybe 4 hours was too long for it to cook, even on low. Next time I will check it at 3 hours.

Absolutely fantastic without any adjustments.  I took the juices left over and added 2 tbl of Wondra Flour in a 1/4 cup water (well mixed) to thicken the gravy.  Left the slow cooker on high, stirred in the Wondra, let it simmer a bit and served the Pork and gravy over white rice.  Delicious!!!

Try this recipe as is... its worth it!

Novice cook here! Made it with Pork Loin and it was awesome as a last minute Late Thanksgiving for my boys. I didn't modifier the recipe. My roast was almost 4 lbs so I just doubled the ingredients. Only difficulty was the crock pot setting. I cooked it in the 6 hour setting for  4 hours and then switched to low for about 2 hours and it was falling apart when done. It was a big hit!

I'll give it 3.5 stars. It was quite salty due to the soup mix and the soy sauce (we used lite soy too). Overall good flavor, but in the future I'd make my own onion soup mix to control the sodium. We also used chicken stock instead of wine. Wouldn't be afraid to try it again.

I followed most of the recipe. The only changes I did was use low sodium soy sauce and add a tsp of Worcestershire sauce. I slow cooked it on the lowest heat setting overnight (maybe I should have done the 4 hour), but I just didn't like the flavoring. The meat ended up being more like pulled pork style not as pictured above like a rump roast. I think that would have been a better piece of pork to do this recipe with. I am uncertain if I will try this recipe again.

I loved this recipe! It was so easy to make the meat was so tender and the sauce was amazing! I strained the juices left at the end and put them on the stove for a few minutes with some cornstarch to thicken it up to more of a gravy thickness. I will be making this again for sure!

OK, so I actually used a frozen pork butt instead of a pork loin since that's what I had on hand. It was absolutely amazing though! It was frozen so I cooked it on high for four hours then low for the last two. I added a cornstarch slurry (3 TBS cornstarch, 3 TBS water blended well) to the drippings in the crock and it thickened up nicely and made a fantastic gravy. I have the Ninja crockpot which has a "stovetop" feature so I didn't have to transfer it to a saucepan. Though I suppose if you remove the met and turn your pot to high it might work just as well. I'll definitely be making this again!

I will make it again.  The only change I would make next time is to use fresh minced garlic instead of jarred garlic.  I had to strain out  the garlic from the gravy.  I did not have red wine so I added more water.  Made a nice aus jus.  I served mashed potatoes and steamed green beans

I used regular pork loin, not tenderloin, and added a bunch of potatoes and carrots (and one sliced onion) on the bottom. Used a homemade "onion soup packet" recipe I found in one of the reviews. Turned out wonderful! Will definitely make again.

Wonderful recipe.  Red Wine wasn't an option, so I used Cranberry/grape juice instead.  We spooned the juice onto our mashed potatoes as sort of thin gravy, it was awesome.  My Picky two year old asked for more!

You will be hard pressed to find a recipe this simple and delicious all in one. 3 cheers for the slow cooker and premixed soups. It literally takes 5 minutes to prepare from frozen and when you come home you have a great meal for the whole family. To make a side even simpler this pairs nice with the rice I make in my rice cooker. 2 pots / 2 Lids and 1 delicious supper.

Enjoy your dinner

Very easy, very good.  I put it on low for 8 hours, and that was fine.  I always use extra garlic, and I had some green beans I wanted to use, so I put them in along with it.  It smelled and tasted wonderful.  I would definitely make it again.

This is a 5 ?? without question. I followed this recipe exactly as written.  I did brown the meat first but this is totally unnecessary. The flavor was great and it was not too salty for us.  The tenderloin was ready in the 4 hours required. One word of caution... if you are using an older crockpot, they are not as hot as the new ones and cooking times are longer. The regulations changed and a low setting on an older crock pot is lower than the new slow cookers. I poured the juice into a pan and thickened it with cornstarch to make a thicker sauce for the meat and the accompanying rice. 
Yep! 5 stars

As written, we did not care for this recipe. I hate it when people review the recipe as 5-stars, then make all sorts of changes from the way it is written. The second time we made this, we considered all of the 5-star ratings and their changes to - reduce the amount of salt in the recipe by using low-sodium soy sauce, and dehydrated onions and broth instead of dry soup mix. Reduced the overall amount of garlic from 3 tablespoons (Good lord, my intestines!!) to a short shake of garlic powder (we can't tolerate garlic, but we love the flavor). Use a nice drinking red wine, not cooking red - if you wouldn't drink it, why cook with it? After the changes, the new version fit our tastes much better than the original recipe. The advantage of this recipe is that you don't have to brown/sear the tenderloins to start off. This might be a sacrilegious act for the tenderloin people, but it's a whole lot easier when you are very busy and need something that's easy to get going for the family. As noted by some reviewers, we changed the heat setting to HIGH for 3 - 4 hours for two, thawed tenderloins.

It was so delicious! My husband urged me to brown the meat first, but I didn't and it was so juicy and flavorful. I made almost 5 lbs of meat though so I had to double the ingredients. I used a merlot as my red wine in the sauce. Sometimes it's the cut of meat that can make or break this recipe.

The wine and garlic smelled amazing while this was cooking, but the finished product was too salty for my taste. Next time, I'll use half a packet of soup mix and see if that works better.

My husband....a very picky eater...loved it! Followed the recipe for the most part. Used pork sirloin bone in roast which cost me all of $3.99. Added a dash of worcestershire sauce and a sprinkle of thyme. Added some fresh onion and cut back on the onion soup mix and it was perfect. melts in your mouth and great taste!! I actually shredded it when done and used as a side to halushki. Thanks for the recipe and all the tips!

All slow cookers cook differently... I was glad I set my timer 1 hour earlier than cook time to check. It was done in 3 hours. Perfect:)

This was really tasty!  The pork loin was falling apart tender & had great flavor.  The only change I made was using ranch dressing mix because I didn't have any onion soup mix on hand.  I eyeballed my measurements, but they should have been pretty close.  At the end of cooking time, I added some cornstarch & mushrooms in to the juices for a nice gravy & served it with red potatoes.

This recipe was delicious. I'm always looking for something interesting to do with pork loin. After looking through some other recipes I cut a few slits in the roast and put about 1/2 of the garlic into the slits in the meat to give it a little extra flavor. The rest I put on top of the meat as instructed  I thickened the sauce with flour & water and it was delicious. The meat was juicy and flavorful. I'm adding it to my recipe box.

Made this used a cheaper cut of meat the center loin.  I used 5lb piece of meat since I wanted left overs.  So I doubled the recipe.  I eyed the soy sauce since some of the reviews said it made it too salty but it could have used more.  I used a cheap bottle of wine it was a dry wine but since I don't drink wine it was fine.  I never add pepper because of my reflux and it turned out really good.

Had a 2 kg. (about 5 pds.) pork loin.  Cooked for 6.1/2 hours at low. Absolutely delicious. Made mashed potatoes, green string beans, and carots.  We were eight at the table.  They congratulated me no end.  Used the remaining liquid of the slow cooker as gravy.

Just ok.  Yes it was tender, but the wine overwhelmed the other flavors.  I used red cooking wine.  Maybe another would be better.

I added  more water than it called for because I thought it would be too salty and  strong. It turned out well and I would definitely make it again.

Have to say it was so nice to have a pork tenderloin which was perfectly cooked. Had my doubts as far as the slow cooker was concerned but it came out perfect just like they said it would.  Tender and juicy ; plus the gravy on mashed potatoes was delicious.  I give this one 5 stars and wouldn't change a thing.

I tried this recipe because I wanted something different that would not heat up the house in the summer. The meat was very tender, both meat and sauce had good flavor, but this reminded me why I never use pre-packaged seasoning, etc., it was unbelievably salty! Next time (and I will use it again) I will take the extra five minutes to chop up a real onion and would use diluted beef broth instead of water.

I used apple cider vinegar instead of red wine but only 1/3 cup.  because I forgot the red wine.  It was very good.

Let it go for 6 hours on low--eyeballed the ingredients--I used a Malbec for the wine.  My husband finished doing the gravy.  OUTSTANDING!!!  Full of flavor and nice on a super hot summer day--didn't heat the kitchen.

I wasn't crazy about the wine taste.  It was just okay.  I will try it again without the wine.  I added a bit of cornstarch to the juice to create a gravy as was suggested by others.  That worked out well.  Served with mashed potatoes.  I used a pork loin and it turned out very tender.  Next time I may add some onions and mushrooms to the mix.

I always read reviews as well as considering the ingredients in the recipe, and I skipped the onion soup mix and used a fresh onion cut in rings and spread on top after everything else.  I browned the pork loin (not tenderloin) after rubbing with simple spices.  My company and my husband loved it, it was easy and the leftovers will be great too!

During the summer months, I love to cook in the crock pot to keep the house cooler and the cost of electricity down.  I really enjoyed this recipe, but I have to say it was a little on the salty side.  I purchased a pork loin with no added salt.   Maybe next time I'll cut back on the soup mix or the soy sauce.  Otherwise, the flavors were spot on.  I did chop up an onion and place it on the bottom of the crock pot before adding everything else, but that was the only change I made.  The red wine really made this recipe!

It really was amazing.  I used a regular pork roast half sliced down the middle to fit and by mistake I used a package of green onion dip instead of onion soup mix and it was still excellent.  The best thing is I can put the slow outside so don't have to heat up the kitchen on 117 Arizona  afternoons

Loved this with no changes to the recipe. My husband normally finds pork tenderloin too dry but loved this.  Will definitely make again. Reading a lot of the other reviews I see some cooks are using pork loin rather than the intended pork tenderloin - not comparable.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years, with some modifications. I make my own onion soup mix, just like the ingredients another reviewer listed here on this site. I use red wine and omit the soy sauce, as I do not see what it adds to the flavor profile. I always use a pork tenderloin roast and not the actual tenderloins that comes 2 to a package.The meat just falls apart when it is done cooking and it tastes delicious. I like that it tastes just as good the next day! I usually add potatoes and carrots to the crock pot.

This was delicious. I had a pork roast I'd gotten on sale and used that rather than a loin cut. I eliminated the soy sauce to cut down on salt, because I used cooking wine which already has sodium in it. And I thickened the gravy a bit. Its fabulous.

The taste of wine was overpowering and the tenderloin was too dry.  Perhaps I should have removed it from the heat sooner.

I used red wine vinegar and hoisin sauce for a bit of tang. A splash of dry sherry instead of red wine.
I will omit the water next time. Made it too wet. 
4 hours on low is enough. I let it cook for 7 hours and it fell apart.

Other than adding more garlic to the top of the tenderloin, i don't change a thing.  It comes out wonderful and very tasty every time.  I make this at least 2-3 time a month.

I had 1.84 of pork loin that was in two pieces when I opened the package so I followed the recipe except cut soy sauce  and garlic down to 2 tbsp. cooked on low for 3.5 hours, removed pork and thickened sauce with cornstarch/ water. This was excellent. I could have eaten the gravy by itself with a spoon! Thanks for suggesting mashed potatoe side, perfect. Hoping to use the leftover for soup this week. I will definetly make this again, thank you.

This is the best and easiest pork loin roast recipe I have ever made. I made it exactly according to the recipe, except that I omitted wine, since I didn't have any. The smells and the flavor were just amazing! I have now found my "go-to" recipe for pork loin. I have had so many dry roasts that I was about to give up. Thanks so much, very good!!

Taste was fantastic! I used more garlic but, other than that, I followed the ingredients. But because my tender loin was a bit bigger than 2 lbs, I cooked it longer. Mistake! My husband loved it but I felt it was a bit tough. Thank goodness for all that au jus.

This was so easy and delicious!  I used 2 small loins, followed the recipe to the letter, and it was a hit!  Guests wanted to take leftovers home, but there weren't any to offer.  I will definitely be making this one again.

I was skeptical, and a little worried while it was cooking, but this came out wonderful. It was very tender and had a great flavor. My pork loin was 3.5 pounds, but I left all ingredients the same and just added half an onion, sliced to the bottom of the crock pot. I let it cook for 4 1/2 hours since mine was a little bigger. I added some cornstarch to the au jus to thicken it up just a bit. This made some really yummy leftovers.

I cooked my pork for 4 hours and it came out perfect. You could slice through it with a fork. No knives needed. The sauce was amazing and using low sodium soy sauce helped cut down the saltiness. I made mashed potatoes and steamed green beans for my sides. I was going to add cornstarch to thicken the sauce like several other comments had said, however I decided to just use it as the recipe said. I even used the sauce over my potatoes. The whole family loved it. Even my 4 year old daughter who isn't much of a meat eater cleaned her plate! I did add other spices while cooking like dried thyme, onion powder, and garlic powder. I will definitely make this again. Also I bought Kenwood Cabernet Sauvignon for the wine portion of cooking. We also drank it with the meal!

I have made this roast many times and usually use a pork loin (less expense and just as tasty).  I actually do not make many changes to the original recipe as it is not needed, only use low sodium soy sauce and a bit less then the recipe calls for.  This recipe is fantastic and is a hit every time  I make it.  I have been reading some reviews and some gave negative comments,  I cannot understand that but think that they "tweaked" it too much, its great as it is.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!  NOTE: recipe states to cook it on "low" for 4 hours, this is incorrect  in my opinion as it should be 4 hours on "high".

I did not make this according to the recipe. I read the reviews and made my revisions as follows: I did not add 3 tablespoons of soy sauce, just 1 tablespoon soy sauce, a few splashes of Worcestershire and 1 tablespoon garlic along with the full amount of wine, water and dry onion soup mix. I had it in the slow cooker for 3 hours on LOW. My temp was between 155-165. I think next time I'll only cook my meat for 2.5 hours. I hate overcooked pork!  The recipe was delicious with the revisions and was easy to prepare. I will definitely make it again. I think next time I'll add carrots and potatoes to make it a complete meal.

Doubled the red wine and added fingerling potatoes to the crock pot.  Delicious and tender.  Very easy to make.  It's become a family favorite.

Loved this tender pork tenderloin and would definitely recommend.  I did sear the meat first and actually let it cook on low for 6 hours (only because we got busy).  I did find the gravy a little salty so may cut back on the soy sauce next time.  But overall a delicious hit.

I've made this many times and it's always delicious. I substituted Worcestershire instead of soy sauce and my family likes it that way a little better. I take the juices and use them to make gravy and it is so delicious!  I serve it with potatoes and carrots!

Very good... I had unused Port wine instead of red - I think it turned out very well - added a little sweetness to the meat!   I also used broth instead of water - I agree with someone else's comment about a little on the salty side so next I will stick to water and maybe even reduce soy sauce a little.   Would make again - very easy and very few ingredients and taste great!

Liked it very much. My picky 4yo had seconds. I used coarsely chopped garlic, instead of minced, about 4 large cloves. I didn't have any onion soup on hand so I used 2 packages of beef bullion.  Made a quick roux, added 2 cups of the juices and made a nice gravy. My family requested it again already.

This was very good. You might try using chicken broth rather than water but still a good recipe. I think I'll use Mexican spices instead next time though.

I used this recipe with a 4lb pork loin and it was fabulous! I did amp up the seasonings and garlic in the slow cooker but this is definitely a keeper in our house. Even my daughter who doesn't care for pork enjoyed this. Made gravy with the drippings and served it with mashed potatoes and a veggie. Super easy!

Fantastic.  I won't make it any other way now.  Very moist.  I would just cut back on the soy sauce or use low salt soy sauce.

My family loves this. I've made it at least a  dozen times. 
Tips:   if you don't have red wine on hand, substitute one can of beef broth for the water and wine.   Also, no need to trim tenderloin. The silver strip will fall right off as it cooks (I  learned this because I flat-out didn't have time to trim it one time,  now I never trim it ).
I serve it with wild rice and a veggie.

Yes will definitely make this recipe again.  Let me say that if there is wine is a recipe along with any other liquids, the wine  will always get the most attention.  I just reversed the amount of wine/water in this recipe.  Great taste and very easy to make.

This was very good.  Used a pork loin, not tenderloin. Added baby carrots to bottom of slow cooker and the flavor was great.  Making again today and added small potatoes (at husband's request).  Did not have red wine so using chardonnay - hope it is as good.

I followed the recipe as is and it came out quite good. However, the gravy was extremely salty and went to waste. However, the tenderloin was very tender and had great flavor. Next time I will take other suggestions and skip the onion soup and just add onion with a bit of beef broth.

The flavor of the pork was wonderful, but the cooking time of 4 hours on low was entirely too long.  The pork was overdone.  A cooking time of 3 to 3-1/2 hours is plenty.

LOVE this.  My husband is very picky and raves about this.  I followed the recipe with 2 minor changes: 1. substituted a dash of granulated garlic for the fresh as I'm not a big garlic fan.  2. substituted apple juice for the wine as we don't typically have any wine in the house.  I usually mix all the marinade ingredients in a plastic container, leave in the fridge and then have my husband start it in the early afternoon. so easy and delicious!

This recipe was just fine to me. Nothing really stood out as being awesome. Followed the recipe, but just kind of blah to me. Flavor definitely relies on the garlic. Not sure I would try this again.

Since this was for company, I didn't want too much fussing near the end.  
Instead of a roast, I used pork tenderloin that I cut into medallion size pieces.
As suggested, I browned the meat before putting into the slow cooker.    
No water, just a cup of red wine.
A half hour before serving, I added whole mushrooms.
Also I thickened it slightly near the end.
Rave reviews.  I'll be making this again even if we're not having company.

This was ok. The wine was way too overpowering. I think it would of been better with beef stock.

Super easy to make and it was delicious! Super moist! I used a little extra wine and only 2 TBS of garlic- I am not a huge garlic fan. Made steamed green beans and skin on mashed potatoes for the sides. A huge hit!

Very good.  I used Red Cooking Wine and added onion.  Definitely do not add salt as the pkg. onion mix seems to have great plenty, more than I would usually use.  After cooking for 7 hrs. on med./low, the pork is very tender and still moist.  I did baste it a few times during cooking.

This pork was great! I cooked it for 6 hours on low heat, it was awesome, the pork pulled apart easily. Only changes I made was the time cooked and I cut slits into the pork and put pieces of garlic directly inside as well as a bit of crushed garlic on top. Thickening up the sauce with cornstarch was a great addition as well and made a nice sauce for potatoes and pork. The pork was very flavorful and I will be making it again!

The meat wasn't terribly dry, but no where near as juicy as it could be.   The seasoning was awful.  I did take the meat out of the crock pot and brown it before serving.

Excellent  pork dish that was very easy and very fast.  Making the gravey is a must!  Everyone in my family had seconds including two kids that dislike pork.  I picked this recipe at the last minute so I didn't have red wine on hand-would be amazing with wine included. I made the onion soup mix rather than using a packet.  My family found it to be a bit salty even using low-sodium soy sauce but we tend to omit salt from most recipes so it is probably personal taste.

Wow, what a fantastic and easy recipe!  I used onion instead of the soup mix and added some onion and garlic seasoning.  I did not brown the meat ahead of time and I used low-salt soy sauce.  Smelled amazing coming in the door and had great flavor!  My meat fell apart so I served it pulled pork style but was delicious!  Next time I'll throw in some mushrooms as well!

The gravy is very thin & really doesn't add that much to the final product.  Pork tenderloin cooks very quickly in the oven so why kill it in the slow cooker?

Awesome easy recipe. Pork loin was on sale so I jumped at the chance to try this. Cooked up great with after I doubled the ingredients for a 3.5 lbs loin in my monster crock pot. Still came in above safe temp in 4 hours. I'll definitely be making this again next time pork loins go on sale.

So easy to make and pretty good, very tender, i would probably omit the soy sauce next time, it was pretty overbearing to the taste. We are not big soy sauce fans...

A HUGE hit with my hubby and kids! There were no leftovers! I made exactly as specified in recipe. We did not think it was too salty at all. I served with roasted potatoes, and we used the juice to put over both the pork and the potatoes. Awesome! Definitely making again, wouldn't change a thing.

My family gave this recipe five stars. The juices and tenderness made it truly amazing. The only change I made was using sodium-reduced soy sauce and I made a very low-sodium onion soup mix recipe (from a low-sodium cooking website).

This is always in the rotation at my house.  So easy to make.  I use only 3 cloves of garlic, leave out the onion soup mix, and ADD a pound of whole crimini mushrooms.  They soak up the sauce and are absolutely delicious.

We usually use this pork for tacos.  Yum.  Also delicious on top of a salad.

This was the most moist pork roast I have ever made. I started with the roast still partially frozen so I added extra time on high.  I also  added large pieces of onion and mushrooms to the crock pot.  I served with cauliflower "mashed potatoes".

This was very good.  I browned the tenderloin in olive oil before putting it in the crockpot.  I also added quartered potatoes and carrots, along with some celery for flavor, and had a fully cooked meal.  I used a Hormel marinated pork roast, and it was very tender and not at all dry.

I made this a few weeks ago for for my husband and myself and it was delicious. I used a pork loin instead of a tenderloin. The pork came out juicy, very tender and full of flavor. I'm making it today for my daughter and son-in-law. I hope it turns out just as good.

Loved it. Made the au jus a little thicker by adding flour to it on the stove. A little salty, and only added 2 tbsp of soy sauce...but it was delicious!

This was very good. It cooked in four hours as directed (6 quart crock pot on low). My husband loved it; I would follow the garlic pretty strictly (I got a bit heavy handed with it) and I might rebalance the red wine and water. Definitely use a good red wine. I read other raters that used honey; I was thinking a bit of brown sugar but either would be a nice enhancement. It was easy and very good. Served with rice pilaf. And NOT a waste of a pork tenderloin. I always buy quality meat and wouldn't hesitate to use a tenderloin again though I do agree that it would be a good recipe for less expensive cuts (which I also use).

Fabulous recipe! I got a good deal on a 4lb pork tenderloin.  I cut it in half for the slow cooker.  Instead of adding the dry mix to the bottom, I put the dry onion soup mix in a bowl, added water, wine, and changed soy to Worcestershire sauce instead. Then poured that over the tenderloin.  About 4hrs later...everyone was in love with me, because the smell made them.  Fabulous!

I'm young and suck at making food. My roasts are always dry, the recipe is always too complicated so I stick to my lame old boring staples.
This was easy, it was delicious, I followed another reviewers instructions for gravy. All I had to do was adjust amounts for everything because my pork was only about 1 LB vs 2, so at least it was easy math. Definitely fantastic for quick easy meal.

No changes made to recipe. My family of 5 thinks this is one of the best dinners we have.  Once we slice it up I drizzle the juices on top, so good, and makes the dish complete.  Served with mashed potatoes is their fav.  So good it's company-worthy.

Tasty recipe. I would cook it for slightly less time next time so the meat would not be as dry when I need to reheat leftovers in the microwave later on.

This was so delicious! We had a four pound roast and doubled the recipe & cooked it on low for 8 hours.  Like one of the other reviewers, we poked holes in the roast and inserted cloves of garlic into the roast. We added cornstarch on high for a few minutes after removing the meat & made a gravy. It was amazing over mashed potatoes! Every one of our 8 dinners guests devoured every last bit! (We don't even get any leftovers for tomorrow, but that's okay cuz everyone enjoyed dinner!) thanks for the recipe! We will be making this one next time we have a pork roast…

I tried, but just didn't turn out like we'd hoped. Read tons of reviews and followed directions and made slight adjustments based on consistent reviewer comments. It was good, but didn't knock our socks off, so likely won't make again.

This recipe was easy to make and tasted great!  My husband loved it, and the house smelled delish while it was cooking.  Very tender and flavorful.  I cooked it on HIGH for 4 hours, and it was cooked perfectly.  I did not have any wine on hand so I substituted Worcestershire sauce (2 tablespoons) and water.   I also removed some of the garlic before serving.  I served it with fried apples and sweet potato casserole.  Great dish!!

I think there was too much liquid in the recipe which diluted the flavor.  I ended up cooking down  (reducing) the "au jus" on the stove to serve as a sauce and give the meat more flavor.
Will not make this recipe again.

It was really good, I wasn't sure about the amount of garlic but it turned out great.  Not dry at all.  My Au Jus was a little watery, I probably should have thickened it up a bit but it was still great.  Will definitely make this one again.

While the pork tenderloin was very tender, the flavor of the garlic and onion soup mix was so unbelievably overpowering, my family and I could only eat a small sampling; with this much garlic, this wonderful cut of meat is barely discernible.

The most amazing pork recipe I have ever prepared! Mt husband and son raved over the tenderness and flavor.  The meat was exceptionally moist.  Even the leftovers were good.  This recipe is a KEEPER.

I did not find this tenderloin particularly delicious...however I think next time I will add a bit of salt because it tasted close to bland...it seemed too dry to me too. I would also thicken a tid bit the jus as is to my taste is too runny. If I make this recipe, I would also slice the tenderloin first so it is not too dry at the end.

Each crock pot is different and mine must run hotter than others because when I checked the pork a half hour early, it was already overcooked.  The flavor was a little off for us but that could be because of the wine I used.

1C of beef broth for the water and 3/4 C water instead of red wine.
Made a gravy by straining liquid and added flour/cornstarch and served over mashed potatoes

This was great!  The only thing was, I think I added too much water....the broth was a bit on the watery side, so I added some bouillon.  I've finally figured out that with my crock pot, 4 hours on low translates to 5 hours on high.

This was fantastic and so easy!  Smelled a little strong as it cooked. Followed the recipe with the exception of having 5 lb. boneless pork loin(not pork roast as others have suggested) so I doubled the liquid ingredients, used 2 onion soup mixes, peppered it up, spread a layer of the jarred minced garlic on top and cooked on low for 7 hours.  The taste was amazing!  Thanks for sharing.

This is amazing - my son and I plan to make it like every week :) - the au jus is incredible - my wife paired it with a roasted red potato, onion, green bean etc chilled salad that was equally amazing.  We fought over the leftovers for lunch the next day.

Definitely needs to cook more than 4 hours.  I may have cooked too long, was really saturated with soy flavor.  Very tender though and a pretty good meal.  Served with rice.

Fantastic, and I'm not a pork fan!  I rubbed the tenderloin up with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder and seared it before putting it in the slow cooker, and then followed the recipe except I substituted beef stock for the water. I added a sliced sweet onion for the last hour.  6 hours on low and hubby was drooling!  Next time I will thicken the gravy, but otherwise, this will become a staple in our house!

This was yummy.  I didn't add all the wine as listed because I didn't have enough but it turned out fine.  I did poke some holes in the meat and put some slivers of garlic in there.  I also browned the meat slightly in a hot skillet before I put it in the slow cooker as recommended by a reviewer.  I added some fresh sprigs of rosemary.  My family loved it and I served it with mashed potatoes and corn from the garden.  This was very easy and a great meal for a  weeknight dinner for this working momma.

This was easy but the chemical taste from the soup-like substance package was overwhelming.  the chemicals did make the meat very tender and it was very convenient.

Fantastic!  Made minor subs due to what I had on hand. The second time I made it I added 2 tablespoons of brown mustard and 2 tablespoons of fruit jam to the pot near the end of the cook time.  Really rounded out the sauce. We serve this over rice.

I used a pork loin, not tenderloin, and cooked it just a while longer than the recipe states; since I didn't want to fight the heat to smoke the loin roast as I would normally do, I tried this recipe and we loved it!! I'm making it again for tomorrow night's meal.

The meat was tender but it still had a dry texture. The flavor just wasn't very good and we ended up putting barbeque sause on our meat! Now I have to figure out how to get my family to eat all these leftovers! I don't think I'll buy this cut of meat again. Very disappointing!

The taste wasn't to my liking.  To much garlic and had a bad after taste.

Good recipe if you like wine. I'm not a fan of wine flavor so that was the only downfall for me.

I changed the recipe in a couple of ways.  First I replaced the water with beef stock and I added tomato paste.  I cooked it with the liquid covering the meat on low for 4 hours.  Prior to serving I removed the sauce and brought it to a rolling boil in order to reduce it by about half.  I found the results amazing.  The tenderloin was very tender and juicy and the sauce turned out great.

This recipe was perfect just the way it was written.  I followed it to a tee.  i think it is important to make sure you use real red wine (I used one of those little bottle of Cabernet).

Wow - so good it was gone fast.  No leftovers.  The kids were even trying to get to it before I got all of dinner on the table.  

I followed the recipe exactly, except for the fact that I had a lemon pepper flavored pork loin already in the freezer so I used that.  

I loved it too, and I don't usually like pork.

This was such an easy and yummy recipe. I have very picky kids when it comes to eating . The pork loin was the first thing they finished off there plate and they both loved. We were very pleased with the recipe and we will be  making it again

Loved it! If you aren't sure what kind of Red Wine to use, I used a French Merlot that worked fine. i did however cut the garlic back to two and a half tablespoons. But like I said LOVED IT! Hope you have a good results with this recipe as I did :)

I had second thoughts upon seeing this recipe. Pork loin is lean and as a rule I don't crock pot lean meats.  That said I was in a bind time wise and gave it a try.  The family really liked it.  The meat was not as succulent as when roasted but with the au jus it took on a French Dip quality and was quit tasty.

This recipe was amazing!! Even my pickiest eater absolutely loved it!  The ingredients were perfect; however, if you want the liquid to cover the pork, I would add more water and wine, otherwise, it was awesome!

Wow!  This recipe is a keeper.  So easy, filled with flavor and low in calories too!  I made it with a 1.3 pound tenderloin but kept the rest of the ingredients the same and ended up throwing away a lot of wonderful sauce/gravy.  I did end up adding some flour to it to thicken it up.  I also only had to cook it for 2 1/2 hours instead of 4 hours because our cut of meat was smaller.  I think it had a tad too much garlic and maybe too much wine but again, we used a smaller cut of meat.  I ended up slicing it into the sauce and letting it sit in the crock pot on warm.  We put in on dollar rolls with some cheese slices and it was fantastic!  Great recipe that will be part of our dinner planning from now on!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I will be using this "broth" to cook roasts, pork chops, etc.  It will taste great with all meat or veggies you decide to use.

My family likes this recipe and it is a fairly healthy one as well.  I serve with mashed potatoes that have chicken broth in them and a tbsp of butter instead of all the fat with a side of veggies.  I do not use a tenderloin. I usually use a country style pork chop with no bones.

One of the best slow-cooker recipes my family has ever tried! For us it did only take 4 hours on low and like another reviewer recommended we made the sauce into a gravy, this was fantastic! I will definitely be making this one again!

I have many better recipes for pork tenderloin.  The soy sauce and onion soup mix made it salty and the garlic was lost.  The "sauce" was very thin, so maybe a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup would thicken things up.

There are no words for this one -- it is marvelous!  I cut the amounts in half and used a smaller pork roast [only 2 of us] - then into my small [2 qt.] slow cooker. The flavors blend wonderfully.  We ate it as au jus the first night, then thickened the liquid for wonderful gravy.  Shredded it the 3rd night for hot pork sandwiches.
NOTE: I did use the entire package of soup mix. Took longer than I anticipated - about 5 hours on high... but worth it.

Not overwhelmed with this sauce. Was thinking it was one I'd tried before that was outstanding. Will have to keep looking.

Was a fabulous meal. Only change I made was to increase cook temp on crock to high as suggested by other reviewers. Was incredibly soft loin that tasted great! A family instant favorite meal.

This was terrible.....  I followed the recipe, exactly.  Pork tenderloin is one one my families favorite.  We always either smoke it or grill it on the BBQ.  Since it was raining yesterday, I thought I'd try something different.   We were disappointed.

This came out amazing.  I did not use the garlic as my husband does not like garlic and it still came out tender and the juice was perfect.  I made mashed potatoes, cinnmon apples and asparagus with it!  SO YUMMY

The smell and presentation was less than appetizing to say the least. The tenderloin was cooked according to published directions. The taste just didn't do it for me or my wife at all.

I made this recipe exactly as the recipe stated.  I am a very good and experienced cook but this recipe was really lacking. I would not make this again at all.  We had it for our supper (my husband and me), but we both agreed that it was not very good and would not save the leftovers.  I have made some very great recipes from All Recipes, but this is not one of them.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for and it was superb! I would go with less minced garlic for crusting it on the tenderloin next time (and I love garlic).  I used the remaining juices as an au jus as recommended and it was a nice treat! I served it with a sweet potato and dipped some of that in the au jus as well.  SO easy and I will be making it again!

SIX STARS, if it was possible!  Can use a beef tenderloin instead of the pork!  Beautiful meal! Especially great for company when you've worked all day!

This recipe really was amazing!  I did use a cheaper cut of pork (in the crockpot everything gets tender) and I did not have red wine so I used some white, some water and some beef broth (everything leftover in the fridge) to make up all the liquid needed.  My family loved it.  My husband usually doesn't like anything with soy sauce but I don't think he knew it was in there.  It has a real suttle flavor.
We are having the leftovers tonight.

This pork was very tasty.  I used a roast instead and i stuck a few garlic cloves inside the roast.  it was about 2.67 pounds so i cooked on high for almost 4.5 hours.  the sauce was very salty (as other reviewers stated) but the roast tasted perfect.  even though the sauce was salty it was still very tasty.  next time i will use low sodium ingredients and/or real onions.  my boyfriend loved the roast, he said it didn't need any sauce.  i used very minimal sauce.  i will make this again, but i will tweak it a little bit.

I just tried this recipe. I used vegetable soup instead of onion and I omitted the red wine and use 1 tablespoon of vinegar.... It was delicious. Even my picky 4 yr old ate it. I will be putting this on our menu more frequently.

Holy moly! My fiance gobbled this up like someone was going to steal it from him! I substituted tart cherry juice and a splash of apple cider vinegar for the red wine since I had none on hand. I also added a sliced red onion and thickened the au jus with cornstarch. Yummo!! This will DEFINITELY be on the "Sunday Dinner" list!

I liked it, but none of my family including my not picky husband did. Unless I am planning on feeding a different group of people I will have to skip this in the future. I think it was the wine flavor that was too strong for them.

Wow I loved this roast!!! So yummy and easy. I did layer the bottom with sliced onion and some mushrooms, cooked as written then thickened the sauce with corn starch after removing roast.  My boys devoured this dish and they loved it!!!

I must have done something wrong.  It was only...okay.  It was easy, the meat was tender but the flavor from the onion soup was not so good.  Too bad, it kind of took away from the wonderful roasted brussel sprouts I served it with.

I have never written a review on this site but this one deserves one. I made it as written and it came out fantastic. It was very tender and juicy. The next time I make it I will thicken the juices a bit to make more of a gravy but I will make it again and again. I served it with the smashed potatoes and zesty broccoli from this site and there wasn't  a bite of anything left over.
Post script, this time I  dissolved 2 tbs corn starch in the water and it made a perfect gravy in the end. I didn't have to do anything but serve.

Made this today for Sunday dinner. The wine overpowered dish and had to smell it all day while cooking. So bad gave away the newly opened wine bottle. Kept adding beef stock to disguise the wine. Strained, and thicken with flour, poured over pork and mashed potato's.  Actually wasn't that bad, not a favorite.  First time cooking with wine and probably my last. Was a little salty.

This is such an amazing recipe! Simple yet it comes out tasting like a gourmet meal.. I make it with either rice or potatoes and a fresh steamed veggie. The pork just falls apart . You will definitely not be disappointed. Great meal!

I was eager to try this but I wasn't that impressed with the outcome. It tastes ok and I will finish eating it but I felt that all the flavors were just too strong all together. I used a Robert Mondavi Cab Sav as my red wine. The garlic was very strong and was too much along with the onion soup and soy sauce. I think cutting back on the amount of garlic and increasing the water while decreasing the red wine might help. This recipe was just too intense in all directions for me to really love.

Dreadful. The flavor of the packaged onion soup mix was over whelming and the meat had an unappealing appearance.

Too well done at 3 hours on low. Not sure if it is my crock pot, or the cut of meat (the butcher cut the tenderloin in half length-wise), but I took it out to test at 3 hours and it was cooked through and then some, making the texture to tough.  The au jus was excellent, I really want to love this b/c it is so easy! I will have to try it again and I apologize for the mediocre review.

I have made several recipes from this site but this is only the second I've left a review on. I was so disappointed with the results on this recipe. The flavors and smells are abrasive. The flavors here just don't mesh well and the result is a pungent and salty sauce on top of a texturally strange piece of meat. 

First off, I used a 2.40 lb pork loin roast instead of tenderloin. Secondly, I added two EXTRA cups of water since I was afraid it would be too salty per other reviews. The meat was at 170 degrees after only 3 hours of cooking on low. It was very tender meat, that's the only thing the recipe had going for it. However, it had a weird rubbery texture to it. I think searing it beforehand would help with that. The sauce was just like salty wine with onion chunks. I threw half of it in a pan to make a gravy out of it since it was so brothy and dull. It didn't help much. 

I would not make this again but if I were to, I'd suggest replacing the onion soup mix with a handful of spices (thyme, rosemary, sage, dried or fresh onion, etc), adding beef broth, and using half the wine with no soy sauce, or using the soy sauce with no wine (I  don't think the soy sauce with wine is a good combination at all). Maybe throw some vinegar and a hint of brown sugar in.

Instead of pork tenderloin, I used boneless pork chops but we both found the pork to be very dry. I added additional water as I checked on its progress. Sorry, but I'm deleting this from my recipe box.

I should have read the other reviews before making this.  Even though I only put 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, it was too salty.  Maybe it should have said 3 teaspoons.  If I ever try it again, I might use Worcestershire instead of soy.  Also, if you cut the pork up, the inside gets the flavor, too.  One good thing, the meat is very tender.

I have made this recipe for my family several times.  I have had to make it with white wine in a pinch.  My family devours it ever time.  I personally add 2 tbsp sugar, and Mrs. Dash to it.  I don't add pepper ever, as Mrs. Dash has some in it.  The Mrs. Dash I use is the Original blend, or the onion one with the purple top.  My family is full of picky eaters, and this recipe is a big hit.  Also, I nix the soy sauce.  The onion soup mix has so much salt, it isn't needed.

I tried this recipe and was disappointed that the meat itself did not have more flavor.  It really needs the gravy to complete it.  I also agree with one of the reviewers in that you cannot use cooking wine due to the high sodium content.  The recipe should state this.

The flavor was really good on the pork and the sauce but it was too salty for me.  My husband thought it was great. I did put 4 cloves of garlic into the pork loin while cooking.  Also poured the sauce into a pan and added cornstarch to thicken it up a bit.

This made the pork tough.  Cooked slow and low.  Tweaked with some spices and still came out bland.  Won't be making this again.

The "broth" smells like beef consume and tastes like extra salty soy sauce.  Pork tenderloin is my favourite cut of meat.  Perhaps this recipe could be saved if you put the tenderloin on a bed of fresh onion then rubbed it with herbs.  Then omitted the soy sauce.

Well, we ate it, but did not enjoy it.  The garlic smell while cooking was very unpleasant and overpowering (and i love garlic). I agree with others that it was also way too salty.  But the main problem was the toughness of the pork. I have roasted the same brand/cut of pork for 20 minutes per pound and it has been delicious; tender and juicy. I'm not sure why others rave about this recipe. . . .

I've got to be honest - I really didn't like this recipe.  I usually LOVE most recipes I try, but this was not very good.  Had a weird taste to it.  Had to use HP Sauce which helped, but really not a fan.

Not impressed at all. Just boiled pork roast with onion flavor. Sad waste of a pork roast, sad  waste of a good cup of wine. Unfortunately there were 2 small pork roasts in the package so we have to eat the other for left overs. Going to try shredding it and adding BBQ sause and put it on a bun. On a good note, made the house smell really good even the day after.

Everyone in my family had seconds!  I substituted 1/2 c. coffee + 1/2 c. water for the 1 c. water.  Next time I will just add a dash of soy sauce.  Thickened up the sauce to make gravy....delicious!

Enjoyed this recipe overall.  I too used a pork loin and found the cooking time too long on high, might be 4 hours on. low  it was done at 2.5 hours on high in my crock pot.  I added 1 1/2 tablespoon Herb de Provence to onion soup mix, coated the loin and let it sit for a few hours before I added the liquid and turned it on. Inserted garlic and coated with garlic. The sauce was great just thickened a bit with cornstarch.

Super easy and everyone in the family enjoyed it.  I used red wine vinegar instead of red wine.  Used apple juice instead of water and didn't use the onion soup mix packet.

Really loved the taste. Fast and simple, which is what I like! I cooked for 7 hours on low. I used Pork Loin. I slit the Loin in several places and shoved Garlic down in there. Turned out great!

This recipe is SO EASY and comes out amazing every time! My husband is asking for this almost every week!!! I use the broth to make a quick gravy. The broth can be a bit salty because of the onion soup mix, so you may want to add some water.

Really good pork tenderloin! Moist and flavorful. I made my own dry onion soup mix (also from this site) I put a thermometer in the meat and cooked it until it read med 160. Sorry, I cant remember how long that cooked for.

bleh! I was looking forward to a nice healthy tenderloin. juicy and tasty.  This was bland and dry, like a boiled pork.  After salting it, it was edible, but not a recipe I want to repeat without drastic changes.  I gave it 1 star because my kids ate it, but then again they were hungry, coming home from practice.

This was really good. I had to change the proportions to make it for a 3.6 lb. roast (so I just multiplied everything by 1.8) I used normal white wine (a chardonnay I think) instead of the red wine, and onion powder instead of onion soup mix (but less than what it called for), because that was what I had. I cooked it in the crockpot for 1 hour on high and then about 4 hours on low. It was tasty! Served with homemade bread and sauteed spinach, tomatoes and feta on top. Took a break from cooking and just served ice cream for dessert. Success! :)

My husband and I reallyenjoyed this recipe! Pork turned out so juicy and moist. After I took the pork out of the crockpot and carved it I added some Wondra flour to make the gravy a little thicker. I served it with some crusty bread and the gravy was great to dip the bread in!

This was ok, but I think a less lean cut would work  better. Mine came out a little dry and I didn't think the broth was very tasty even though I used  good red wine.

I put this in my slow cooker this am before I left for work at 7:30 am and we didn't eat dinner until 7:30 pm.  I made some changes because of other reviews  - I used a whole onion instead of onion soup mix and next time I would use only half.  I did the rest just as the recipe said, and it turned out to be the most remarkable pulled pork - fork tender and great flavour.  I added 2 tbsps corn starch mixed with water and poured the sauce into a pot, so I could bring it to a boil and thicken nicely.  The gravy was amazing.  My husband is not aj big fan of pork tenderloin and this he liked this a lot!

This was, indeed, easy..4 hours on low would not have worked for us..turned it up to high after 3hours, and cooked for a total of 5 hours. Towards, the end, I threw in roughly chopped carrots and potatoes. While the broth complimented the veges well, our pallets did not care for it overall..seemed to be missing something..perhaps a little worstechesire? might try again to play around with it..everybody ate it..we just werent crazy about it..

Made this recipe true to the original recipe, and it was tasty, but the jus was way too salty!  After I added the potato water before thickening, it was simply amazing!!!  Definitely going to be a fav... and yes, had to cook it a bit longer as the other reviews have stated.  Closer to five hours, but it was very tasty!

My BF and I cooked this for Sunday dinner and were thrilled with the result!  We used a 1.5lb roast from Walmart that had an onion and garlic marinade already and I think it really added an extra element of flavor.  The wine we used was a Marsala (just what we had), low sodium soy, and used enough garlic to put a decent layer on the top of the roast, probably more than the 3 tablespoons called for.  We followed some of the other reviewer's advice and put a few fork holes in it prior to, and about an hour before it was done cooking and periodically basted it.  When it was finished, I added 2 teaspoons of cornstarch to the remaining liquid and made an awesome gravy.  It was a touch salty, but we chose not to add salt to the mashed potatoes and it balanced out beautifully.   Great meal that I will be adding to our repertoire!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! Instead of au jus, though, I strain the drippings into a pan and add some cornstarch and water to thicken it up for a gravy.
The other day I had boneless, skinless chicken breasts and was looking for a quick easy way to fix them - I adapted this recipe by switching the red wine to white, and the chicken came out GREAT. So it is definitely an interchangeable recipe.

My Daughter even liked the taste, however, the cooking time is too long.  It was quite dry, which made me sad.

I seasoned the pork with salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder.  also used a little bit of rosemary. I then seared the pork in a pan (to brown it) and then put it in the crock pot. There was a lot of liquid left over and next time I'm only going to use 1/2 cup of water. Also next time make slits in the pork and put garlic slivers in it.

This is DELICIOUS.  I made this to try because it was so very easy and I wanted a different pork recipe. I gave some to my adult son and he asked for the recipe. This one is a keeper!

This was a really good recipe.  I ended up cooking the pork loin a little longer than stated.  The meat was still very moist, tender and flavorful.  I actually shredded the meat and put it on buns for sandwiches.  We used the sauce from the slow cooker as an au jus.  Yum!

I used 4.75 lbs of meat so doubled the ingredients. One package of onion soup would have been enough. It was too salty with 2 packages. Next time I will use low sodium soy also. Meat was very tender and enjoyed by my family. Easy recipe. Served with rice and vegetable.

Very easy!  I used low sodium soy.  I also used boneless, lean pork chops and they were tender and tasty. I used half the marinating amount because there were 2 4oz chops for just my husband and I. There was no need to baste them either. I also do not use any marinade the meat has been in for basting.  Enjoy!

Great meal.  I used pork loin instead of tenderloin to save some cash.  We added beef bullion and served with mashed potatoes.  It was a hit!

I made this using about 2 pounds of pork loin...didn't change anything else.  Results were good.  Jack and I liked it.  Alex was OK with it.  Jenny actually liked it...very strange.

This is a nice recipe but I made some changes in it. Too the next time I use this for pork I'll use something besides tenderloin. It was really tasty but a bit dry and this would be better suited to something like a regular pork roast. I changed out the dry onion soup mix for a beef and onion dry soup mix and dropped the soy sauce altogether. Cut back on the garlic to one small section not 2 tblspns and the wine I used was Due Mari 2008 Primitivo which made the best tasting au jus and everyone couldn't stop dipping and pouring more on their plates - it was a hit. I may make the au jus by itself it's so good. That and some garlic bread would be a fine meal. However this was good just could be improved on with a different cut of meat I think.

This was a big hit at our house!!  Husband & teenage boy loved it.  I liked it too, so it's a keeper & will be making it again. I didn't know what to expect when it was done.  I thought I would be slicing it up, but when I went to pull it out it was falling apart & so tender.  Some of the pics on here look like slices.  Not sure why they look different.  I followed the recipe to a T & it was great.

I made this the other night exactly as directed in the recipe. While it was very tender the flavoring was nothing to rave about. Overall it was OK but it isn't a "keeper" recipe for our family. I'll probably keep the method since it did result in tender meat but I'll change up the flavor.

I read the recipe and thought maybe what I know about pork tenderloin was wrong. Never, ever, over cook pork tenderloin! I wasn't wrong. The jus is needed because, while the tenderloin is tender, it is also arid, saharan, dry. The jus is tasty, but there are better ways to make a pork tenderloin sing.

This was so incredibly salty I could barely stand it.  Now I realize what I should have done differently (low sodium soy sauce, raw onion, etc)

I did this recipe as-is, and I thought it was firmly mediocre. It wasn't bad--we still ate it--but it wasn't terribly good, either. The meat was fairly tough after basically boiling in the water/wine mix all afternoon, which is a bit of an effort with something like tenderloin. I'm glad I tried it, but I think I'll stick to oven roasting next time.

I should of read the reviews BEFORE I made this.  Way to salty and overcooked.  My famiy tried it but said it was to salty and to much garlic.

I followed recipe on a 1 1/2 lb loin using half the garlic. Won't make again. The wine was too dominate and was WAY TOO salty!! Juice made a very salty gray not adding any seasoning. Didn't need the wine, soy sauce, or garlic.

Absolutely one of the best sauces I have had in a very long time.  With mashed potatoes it was wonderful.  However, would double the sauce my family loved it so much, wanted more.  This would be great with any meat or poultry.  THANKS for the recipe.

This was incredible good. The only changes I made to the recipe were to use a 5lb pork loin - I kept the other quantities the same - and made a gravy with the juices with a bit of cornstarch. I dissolved about 3T cornstarch in about 1/3 C of water and boiled the gravy on the stovetop in a saucepan until thickened. I will definitely make this again.

I don't know what I did wrong but 4 hours was too long. My 2.3 lb tenderloin was dry at a 3 hour check. Maybe my crock pot runs hot since I don't see a cooking time problem with any of the other reviews. The house did smell heavenly though.

This was very good, it just pulled apart beautifully when it was done cooking.  I cooked it on high for 5 hours.  I used the same ingredients and I think the red wine gave it too strong of a taste for my kids though I liked it, and it could have used some herbal seasoning like rosemary or thyme perhaps.  Great recipe though.

This recipe was excellent.  The meat came out SO tender.  The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because I personally don't care for a lot of onion flavor in my food, but even so, I will be making this recipe again and again!

I didn't actually get to taste this recipe, I made it for my kids and ex husband as I had a work function. I did two tenderloins and there wasn't a scrap left. All 3 said it was amazing, so I will definitely cook this again!

This was awesome!  I used a(3 lb) pork loin instead of tenderloin and it turned out amazing (I cooked it on low for 8 + hours).  I added a little chopped onions.  Everyone in the family loved it.  Yum yum yum!

So because of prior reviews of too salty, I used 1/2 of onion soup mix, low sodium soy sauce, chicken stock instead of water. I used merlot for wine ...that's what I had. I added rosemary and thyme. Cooked 3.5 hours on low. It was good but not the best pork tenderloin I have had. I think the wine used is very important keeping in mind that it is a white meat. I also thought it needed to be flipped half way through cooking. The broth was good to use to make a gravy. I would not repeat the recipe but will try agin in a even more modified version. Overall it was good not great

Not the best pork recipe...I think these parings would have gone great with a beef dish, but with pork it overpowered the meat and did not really taste good.  All I could taste was wine and soy sauce, not going to be making this one with pork again.

This recipe was amazing! I used a tri-tip pork roast and it worked very well. I added a bag of baby carrots and I poured the juices into a saucepan and thickened it with cornstarch! All 3 of my kids and my husband LOVED it! I serverd rice on the side with some gravy on top. The gravy with the meat is also excellent! Good Luck!

I loved this pork tenderloin! It was so tender, moist and juicy!  And best of all, my 6 year old loved it too!  She turned down McDonald's to try this new recipe!!

Terrible waste of a nice pork loin - might as well just boil it (ugh) cooking time is too long pork was way overdone and dry.

This was good, but not great. I followed others' suggestions and put slivers of garlic in the tenderloin. I also added rosemary and thyme to the crockpot. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and cooked on low for 4 hours. The meat was very tender, but the taste was not that amazing. I would make the recipe again.

My entire family loved this Tenderloin!  I used a lower sodium soy sauce as well and the delicous flavor still came through!  I served this with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed fresh green beans, very scrumptious!

The recipe was ok.  The meat pulled apart easily but not exactly what I consider "melt in your mouth".  Also, this was VERY SALTY.   The amount of salt in the package of onion soup and the soy sauce is way more salt than necessary.  Strongly recommend using low sodium soy sauce if you make this.

Amazing! After reading a few reviews on this recipe I was skeptical. But decided to give it a shot. I followed the directions exactly how they were given (I used a Shiraz as my red wine of choice and low sodium soy sauce). This turned out perfect! I will definitely be using this recipe again. The flavor was just right. I paired this with buttered noodles, green beans and Hungarian rye bread. Delicious meal! Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe was delicious!  I used White Zin instead of Red Wine and it complemented it very well!  I checked the internal temp after three hours and it was done!  The meat was nice and moist.  Will definitely make again!

At 3.5 hours, the pork was really dry. The flavor of the AuJus was very yummy! When I try it again ill only put it in the slow cooker for 3 hours, Hopefully that will be more juicy!

I have a smaller crockpot so I used a tenderloin that was just over 1lb and halved the liquid ingredients.  I was worried that it would be way too soupy but then I ended up getting sidetracked in the evening and totally forgetting about the roast.  So when I got home late that night, I put the entire thing in the fridge.  It smelled really strong (spicy) so I didn't have high hopes for it.  Today I took it out of the crockpot and set it on the cutting board to prepare it for lunchboxes tomorrow.  I stuck the fork in and attempted to cut it in half...it crumbled.  So then I could resist and I quickly boiled up some red potatoes.  Mashed them slightly with a touch of butter and milk and tried a little pot roast with just a ladel of the juice from the crockpot...delicious.  I have never had such a tender roast.  Thanks.  I will definitely use this and share this with others!

This is probably the best pork tenderloin recipe ever! It is so tender and flavorful.  I used some dried onion flakes, and a mixture of tarragon, cumin, and oregano instead of the dried onion soup, and added a shot of worcestershire sauce, I will be making this often, I'm sure. Thanks!

This was tasty and a quick way to prepare pork with items in the house.  Au jus was nice but think next time I'll dredge tenderloins in herbed flour.  Think a little more texture will make it enven more flavorful.

This came out nice and juicy and because it was done in the slow cooker it was tender.  The house smelled sooo good while it was cooking.  I didnt have an onion soup mix but used a garlic and herb dip mix instead.  I would make this one again!

I didn't really like this recipe...the flavor was just "so-so", and kind of odd.   I agree with the comment about ruining the wonderful taste of a good cut of pork.  All the other additions were too overpowering.  I think I will go back to roasting my pork tenderloin in the oven.

A little disappointed after reading all the hype in the previous reviews!  Made the house smell TERRIFIC and it was very, very tasty.  Too much liquid so maybe follow the others' suggestions and thicken before serving.

Outstanding flavor! Make a little bit bigger roast and enjoy left overs on french bread slices with the leftover juice the next night- can't beat it!

Smells amazing while cooking!  I follow the recipe exactly, except cooking on low while I'm gone at work all day.  I've also used this "seasoning combo" on other meats and LOVE it!

This was OK, but I found it to be very salty with both the onion soup and the soy sauce.  I don't think I would try this recipe again.

I was looking for a way to slow cook pork tenderloin and this was the recipe I needed. I did not have red wine so I substituted chicken broth for the liquid in this recipe (with the exception of the soy sauce). I also added some quartered yukon gold potatoes and two sliced carrots to the slow cooker to turn it into a one pot dinner. It was tasty this way, although I would like to try it next time when I have red wine in the house.

Okay, I'm trying to find the appeal here . . . I followed the recipe exactly. Found the tenderloin to be dry (I use an oval crock pot . . . perhaps it cooks more rapidly than the found ones?). Used a good merlot as my red wine. As another reviewer suggested, I tried to thicken the sauce by adding in some cornstarch/water and turning up to high for 10 minutes, but that did not work at all. I just did not find the tenderloin to be that flavorful. I would not make this again; tenderloin is too expensive to turn out so bland. UPDATE November 2013: it was better this time; used 2 1/2 pounds tenderloin, 2 pkgs soup mix, 1 1/2 times water and wine, and double amount of garlic. Layered chopped red potatoes into bottom; pork on top. Much more tender, not as dry, and flavor was "okay." Still not a terribly impressive recipe, but for the ease of preparation, I'll make again.

My Hubby and I love this recipe just the way it is.  One cooking rule I've learned is, never cook with a wine you won't drink.  We use either a Cab. Sav. or a Shiraz blend.  Basting peroidically seems to keep it nice and moist.  The au jus is awesome on the meat and as a gravy for mashed potatoes.

Easy and delicious! The only comment - the wine taste overpowered the rest of the marinade. Instead of tenderloin, pork loin was on sale, so I used 4 lbs of pork loin. Doubled the water, wine and dry onion soup. Added 3 tbsp of worchestershire and added 1/2 can of beef brouillon. No soy sauce. Sliced  inserted peices of garlic and inserted into the meat.   Next time, I would reduce the wine and add the soy sauce to see if that helps with the overbearing wine taste.

I was skeptical based on all the mixed reviews, but was pleasantly surprised! I did not find it too wine flavored (and I don't even drink red wine) -- I used pinot noir and subsituted low sodium beef broth for the water and threw in some chopped shallots. I did find it slightly on the salty side, but not overpowering -- next time I will probably just skip the onion soup mix and use real onions! Came out perfectly tender though with lots of flavor. Will definitely make again.

I thought this recipe was great and it was so easy!  Turned out very moist and flavorful.  I made my own "dry onion soup" mix and used Sherry because that's what I had on hand (the real thing, not cooking Sherry).  Served with roasted butternut squash and the Italian Kale from this site.  Definitely will become part of my regular recipes.

This was amazing!  Next time I will put the slow cooker outside because all the garlic really stunk up my little apartment.  I did use beef broth instead of water and cut 4 slits in the pork and stuffed in garlic cloves.  I cooked on low for about 4 1/2 hours and then had it on warm for about another 30 minutes.

You must be a huge fan of the heavy wine flavor.It was a little too much for us..I would recommend using about one half of the wine called for in the original recipe.

this was so easy and the aroma was driving us nuts all afternoon.  The only change I made was to cook for 6 hours on low (like several others recommended).  Next time I am thinking of adding some potatoes and carrots to the pot - won't those be yummy in that sauce?  A winner for sure!

I used a 2lb Pork Roast which worked great.  Also I was nervous about this recipe because of some of the reviews.  BUT it did cook in 4hrs! and it wasn't too salty (I followed the recipe to a T).  I will say I tasted the juice before serving and worried it might be salty but drizzled over the pork it was PERFECT.

The flovor was ok but a bit overwhelming for the pork.  The tenderloin was swiming in the liquid so I'll cut it in half if I make this again.

I made the recipe verbatim and while the flavor was great, the meat was very dry.  In my opinion while gravy is a nice compliment to the dish, gravy only masks the problem (the real challenge is keeping the meat moist).    The next time I make this I will heed the advice of others and sear the meat (hoping that will help keep the meat moist).  In addition, instead of using wine maybe by using beef broth it won't be as dry (just a thought).    I think this recipe is worth having in your rotation, it just needs a little tweaking.

A very good and easy receipe.  I used a fruit based wine and it gave it a different twist.  I think the big key to this, as all other "slow cooker" meats is to not over cook.  Check your temp on the meat.  Just because you cook it for 10 hours doesn't mean it will be good.  It reaches a point that the flavor and tenderness is cooked out.  I'll sure use this one again.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  I had Merlot on hand so that is the wine I used.  We are not big wine drinkers so the heavy flavor of the wine in this recipe was overwhelming and none of us liked it.  I will say this, it has probably more to do with our personal taste than it does with the quality of this recipe.

This was so good.  I don't cook with wine, so I added some chicken broth.  So flavorful with the garlic on top and I also poked it with a fork so the flavor would go throughout the meat.  Keeper.

I really only had to cook the tenderloin for 3 hours on low to make it the perfect texture.  It does taste a lot like a red meat when done.  I thought that made it pretty good but my husband loved it and wants it again soon.  Plus it was SOOO easy.  I went a little light on the garlic (3 tsp) b/c I cant eat a lot of it.

Delicious! Like others said I seared the meat first until it was brown.  I added more garlic because we like it.  My husband thought it was delicious.  The meat was very tender and flavorful.  Thanks!

I made and served this to my friends. They all loved it. Some ate it with barbeque sauce on it...it would make a great sandwich that way. Every bit of this meat was consumed. I added tiny carrots and small Yukon potatoes to the crockpot about an hour and a half before serving. The broth flavored them nicely.

This was a great comfort food recipe.  I think I cooked it longer than the recipe called for by accident....it was fork tender but falling apart.  Yummy taste especially with mashed potatoes and thickening the leftover juice w/cornstarch to make a gravy.  Hubby loved it and will make again...although not what I would call outstanding, it was easy and delish.

Absolutely Delicious...I didn't brown it used fresh onion - Pinot Noir- Soy- no garlic- rosemary- pepper-a teaspoon of whole grain dijon mustard- a pinch of oregano ----can do same with chicken breasts but hold the red wine.....perhaps white wine...stick of celery


on the side - baked Potato- garlic buttered ciabatta- fresh shaved corn from the cob steeped in milk and butter then strained off.  Total hit for Myself and Hubby!!!  The dog loved the strained milk from corn!! 
By the Way I did roast on low for the 4 hours then turn it on high for another hour or so after the man came home IT FELL APART.....excellent!!!

I am not usually a fan of Pork but my husband loves it so I tried this one for him. I made this recipe last night and I have to say it was one of the best pork dishes I have ever eaten! My husband loved it too. The meat was so moist it fell apart when we cut it and the juices were perfect for dipping and using as a gravy on the potatoes. Awesome dish!

Fantastic meal.  Hubby loved it. I took the advise and used Teriyaki Sauce instead of the Soy Sauce; it would have been too salty otherwise.  The taste of this meal reminded me of a Portuguese meal called Alcatra.  Because we had so much left over I plan on shredding the leftover meat and try adding a BBQ sauce to make sandwiches.

What a waste of a tenderloin.  It was not tasty at ALL and there was nothing about it that I liked.  Don't waste your time or money and find a better recipe, there's no way to alter this to make it better.

Loved this recipe.  I used a bit more red wine, maybe about 2 cups.  Great with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables.  I will definitely make this again.

Ho hum recipe.  Might be worthy of 3.5 stars, but I thought it was awfully garlicy.  If I made it again, which I doubt I will since there's better recipes out there, I would only add 2T garlic.  Don't get me wrong, the overall flavor wasn't bad, it's just not something I would make again.

Not bad, not bad.  I agree with another poster that it is missing that "depth" of flavor, but I cannot put my finger on what that is.  I used a large, Costco loin, cut in half and cooked it on low for 5 hours.  Came out moist, not chewy.  The wine was a nice, subtle flavor, but it needed something a bit... more.  Maybe kick it up a notch with chili flakes, or add onions to the "broth".  We tried to make a gravy out of the liquid, but it never thickened.  I think maybe reduce the water by half.  Might make again with some additions.

Enjoyed this.  Served it with instant brown rice, and the au jus was very good with it, and used some red wine vinegar instead of wine. Also made the house smell wonderful.

All we could taste was wine. Maybe we just don't like the flavor red wine gives food though. That was what was wrong with it. I used a red that I like to drink occasionally but it was still WAY overpowering.

Sorry to say I will not be making this recipe again.  I think the wine you use makes all the difference, you have to use a good one.  Besides that, it smelt bad and tasted so so.  Could be the mix of an ok wine with the soya sauce....

Smells wonderful when cooking, very tender meat but much too salty despite use of low sodium soya sauce - must be the onion soup mix??

This WAS awesome!!! I served it with another recipe from this sight, Mushrooms with Soy Sauce Glaze.  Also with corn, boiled new potatoes (tossed in butter, parsley,salt and pepper) and warm sour dough bread. The juice was so good we poured it over the potatoes and dipped our bread in it. All family and friends loved it!!!! FYI-use a wine you would drink. "Cooking wine"" from grocery stores are not as concentrated with flavor and contain a lot of salt:)

Loved this dish. All I added was the fresh garlic slivers tucked into the meat. The sauce made a really lovely robust gravy when thickened with cornstarch. I'm loving the slow cooker these days and this recipe was one of the easiest to make.

I'm sorry, I did not like this recipe at all.  What a waste of a lovely cut of meat.  After four hours, it was cooked but still rather tough and dry for some reason.  I also thought the combination of soy sauce and wine would be intriguing but it was just kind of odd and I didn't care for it.  I would have given it only one star but my husband ate about 2/3 of it and said he would have given it three stars.

Yummy!!! I used a pork roast, tenderloins are so expensive, you really shouldn't waste them in the slow cooker when a cheaper cut of meat works just as well. But the sauce was super delish!

Ok, so I tweaked this one a bit...I used one packet of beefy onion soup mix (that's what I had).  I added 1 T. Worchestershire sauce.  I also used a 3 lb. port loin cut rather than the tenderloin-it just has more fat and cooks better in the slow cooker I think.  Great recipe!

I made this recipe as posted with no modifications and cooked it for a little over four hours on low. I used low sodium onion soup mix and low sodium soy sauce so it didn't have the overly salty taste others complained of. The flavor we mostly got was from the red wine and garlic. After cooking for about 4.5 hours it was dry and coming apart a little bit--not how tenderloin should be--so I would recommend not cooking it longer than 4 hours, if that. Also, I couldn't get my sauce to thicken even after adding quite a bit of cornstarch, so it was more like an au jus than a gravy. Served with white rice and roasted carrots, it was a pretty good meal, satisfying, but I probably won't prepare pork tenderloin this way again. As others have said, the crockpot does wonders on tough cuts of meat--tender cuts that you pay for are better pan roasted, in the oven, or on the grill.

Very good and easy.  I thinked the sauce with cornstarch/water.  It was a hit; served with mashed potatoes, broccoli and french bread.  Will make again.

I finally love pork tenderloin!  I have tried and tried just about every kind of pork tenderloin the grocery stores sell (flavored or marinated ones), but I never like the taste of them.  The only change I made was the cooking time.  I was not at home while this was in the crockpot, so mine ended up cooking 6 hours on low, but it came out perfect.  I also added corn starch to the juices after it was done cooking and it made a delicious gravy.  Overall, we loved this recipe; however, I could see where some people might think it's too salty.  We liked it very much though.

Not a wow meal but good!  The sauce is delicious but roast did not pick up any flavor at all.  Had it not been for the au jus poured over the meat, the meat would have had no taste at all, and I followed the recipe exactly.  I will make the sauce again (very yummy) but will continue to cook my pork loin seperate.  I think mushrooms would be a very wonderful addition to the au jus!

I did not put the tenderloin in the crockpot.  I planted the minced garlic into the tenderloin and placed sliced onion rings on the top of it.   I put the wine (shiraz), 1 c. beef boullion, 1 Tbs of soy sauce and 1 Tbs Worchestire. I cooked it @ 425 for 45 min, in tented foil, basted it with the sauce, left the foil off for the last 15 min.  Basted it again.  Poured the juices & drippings into a saucepan, added a TBS cornstarch to thicken it.  The tenderloin was great but we pitched the gravy.  TOO salty.  I should have cut the boullion in half.  Smelled great. Hubby loved the meat not the sauce.

I made this last night but instead of the crock pot, tried it on the grill.  I put all of the ingredients...minus the water...in a large plastic bag and put the pork in for about an hour. I grilled it on medium heat for about 25 minutes.  I served it with mashed potatoes and it turned out great!  Will have to try it next time in the crock pot!

In the crock pot it practically falls apart and the au ju sauce, I strained it to get all the onion out, was so fabulous it put it on my rice and mashed potatoes. I am so excited I found this recipe and i hope to pass it on to many others, thanks stacy

Yum, we enjoyed this for a Sunday dinner. I thought the sauce was great, and next time I make this I'll use it to make a gravy. I think that I would prefer this with a pork roast rather than tenderloin however. I didn't have a problem with mushy pork, I just prefer to use the slow cooker for tougher cuts of meat. But it did taste great and made a wonderful meal with mashed potatoes. Even my 14 month old who has been on an eating strike lately gobbled this up.

This was very salty, even with low-sodium soy sauce, but everybody loved it.  I used a cheap Merlot, and the sauce was great, made tasty gravy.

I was snowed in yesterday and decided to fix something different for dinner. Found this recipe, and had all of the ingredients. It turned out GREAT!!!! Cooked it all day on Low (since I had plenty of time) and the meat fell apart and was very juicy :-) Served with buttered garlic noodles, italian green beans, and hot bread and butter. Fantastic meal, thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe as written and it actually turned out really good.  I made it for about 5 people and used a nice sized tenderloin.  If there were one thing I would say negative it would be that it is a bit salty.  But, by the time you add gravy and other sides you don't notice it as much.  I will make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly, and I didn't like the results.  The meat was dry, yet falling apart (because it's already a tender meat), but the flavors of ingredients didn't work well together. The only saving grace for this was cutting the tenderloin very thin and making sandwiches out of it by adding melted swiss, and horsey sauce (mayo and horseradish).  I WILL NOT make this again...

OK so it's still in the crock on warm, waiting for DH to get home but I had to review---the roast is moist, not overpowering of garlic or salt I might add. I don't think the wine did anything to it, altho I eyeballed the ingredients and may have been a bit shy on the wine...I'm definitely liking that it is moist, but given the fact that I cooked my 6+ lb tenderloin on low in an AllClad 7 qt slow cooker for almost 9 hours on Lo, it should be moist!!!! :) I used 4 small onions in the bottom, quartered, and about 4-5 pounds small red potatoes in the crock, potatoes were a tad overdone tho.. :(  I think I might make it again and play with the ingredients. Update: I had DH try it and he said it was excellent! The jus is actually very good on the meat, I didn't make a gravy, as he doesn't like gravy. I made this and Sauteed Garlic Asparagus with Karen's suggestion to add the balsamic vinegar and use olive oil - very good!!!

I don't understand the enthusiasm for this recipe.  For one thing, meat which has basically been boiled is not that great.  NOT too salty: hardly salty at all!  I would not make this again.

this recioe worked out fine for an everyday dinner, with items that I usually have on hand. I added a little more garlic and ground pepper to the rub, along with some herbs de provence.

Wonderful recipe! I made this for company, and doubled the sauce and then thickened it up with a little corn starch before serving it with potatoes and carrots! YUMMY! Will certainly make this again. :)

We think this recipe is great! I don't make any changes...I do however press my own garlic--probably ends up being 1-2 heads of it but cooks down into the sauce nicely. We serve it doused with plenty of the au jus!

Delicious flavor and SO easy to make. The only thing I will do is cut the soy sauce in half next time. My 12 year old son could pick out the soy sauce flavor right off the bat, so I thought it was possibly too much. I will definitely make this again.

I didn't use the onion soup mix but used real onions and garlic in with the wine.  The meat became very tender. I made gravy with flour and it was delicious.  Will definitely make this again.

I don't even normally like pork nor soy sauce (made it mostly for my hubby) but this was absolutely fantastic!  So easy too. The tenderloin just fell apart and the au jus over potatoes was very tasty.  I would caution not to overcook this as it might get too dry.  I changed nothing in the recipe and will make again and again.  Thanks for changing my mind about pork and this great recipe.

Very good but a little too salty. Followed this recipe to a T, maybe next time I will use low sodium soy sauce. I also added some corn starch to the slow cooker after the tenderloin was done to make a gravy. Yum! I would have liked this with rice, but I didnt have any.

This was good, but not great. I follwoed recipe, except flowing one reviewer and adding more garlic in slits and using low sodium soy sauce.  I liked it, no one else in my family did....they said it was way too salty and had a strange taste.  Probably will not make a second time.

I am always in competition with my fiance as to whom is the better cook. I get really nervous cooking for him so I found this recipe and cooked it for myself. This was the best rendition of pork tenderloin that I've ever had! And it knocked my fiance's socks off too!

I put baby carrots in the cooker with the tenderloin to soak up the flavour and I also used shallots for a sweet flavour.

MMM!

This was so wonderful!!! I will definitely make again. So tender and flavorful. I did not use the wine but used beef broth instead. I also had a different seasoning mix that is similar to onion soup. It was fabulous!!!
Thanks for the great recipe!

This was tasty, but a little too salty to suit me. I will make it again but will try to use low sodium ingredients. I loved how easy it was!

This was a very tasty tenderloin.  I started it on high for the 4 hours and then added potatoes with a little more water on low.  Very yummy !

This was delicious!  However, I was afraid of too much of a wine taste for my kids.  I used 14 oz of reduced sodium beef broth(to reduce salt as others have said) and 2 oz of red wine.(no water either)  I only used 2 tbsp of w. sause too.  My husband thought is was really one of my best recipes.  I added 4 tbsp of cornstarch mixed with a little water at the end to thicken sauce into a gravy. Served with mashed potatoes, spinach and carrots.  Yum!!

This recipe is ok, but not my favorite for cooking pork tenderloin. After eating, my boyfriend said he prefers when I cook the tenderloin in a roasting bag in the oven. I had to add alot of spices and flavors to get it just right. (and ALOT of garlic!)Also, dont try to make a gravy out of the jucies. I tried to add some cornstarch to the liquid, bring to a boil, and make a gravy. Didnt work! Ended up with a great tasting, but otherwise lumpy and corn-startchy gravy. Overall, im not making a pork loin in the slow-cooker, the oven variation works better for us because its more tender, and has more flavor! Thanks though for bringing a new idea into the kitchen.

We didn't care much for this. The meat was very tender (cooked on low for 5 hrs.) but the garlic was wayyyy too much! If I make again, will only use 1 tablespoon of garlic.

My husband made this and loved the receipe. He added a few things of his own I am sure, but he wanted to use the receipe again which is my indicator on how he liked the dish. It was yummy. We used it like a soup, then for tacos. Recommend

I used a pork roast, not a tenderloin.  Tasted good, was a little salty but I like salt.  Perhaps you can use half of the envelope of dry onion soup mix to cut the salt. Tasty leftovers. Yummy with mashed potatoes.

Wonderful way to prepare pork! I used pork medallions and followed the ingrediants just like they are in the recipe. I did keep it in the slow cooker for about 6 hours on low, though. Incredibly tender and the extra broth made a wonderful gravy when I added a little flour mixed in with warm water. I made the gravy right in the crock pot and set it on high for about 15 minutes. I will definately make this again!

this recipe was alright, although i really didn't care for the dry onion soup mix. it gave it a weird stale/processed taste and smell (i cant put it into words). if i decide to make this again, i will leave that out and add in some sliced fresh onions.

I wasn't so fond of this, and neither was my husband. It has a very funny taste to it that we didn't really like. We tried using center cut chops like someone else did, and ti turned out being very tender, but completely dry.

WONDERFUL!!! Definitely a five-stars recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as it is written, except since my roast was 3.5 lbs. I added a little more wine and water. Made small slits in the meat with the end of a paring knife and poked garlic slices into the slits all around the roast. Amazingly, it was done in 4 hrs. and was delicious. It made lots of gravy which I thickened a little with corn starch. Served it with mashed spuds and broccoli. The next evening we had it again on open face sandwiches with lots of gravy. YUM! My DH is still raving about it.

Sorry, we just didn't like this recipe at all and even threw out all leftovers. It was very heavy on the wine taste but was otherwise tasteless. It was also too salty and I used low sodium soy sauce.

This recipe was a total disappointment.  I followed the recipe for the most part, only I added 1 cup of beef broth and no soy sayce.  The meat was very tender like previous reviewers had said, but there was absolutely no flavor.  I ended up shredding the meat and topping wtih barbeque sauce for some yummy pulled pork sandwiches.  The only reason I give this recipe a 2 is because I was able to re-use the meat.

I thought this was okay. For some reason the taste was not that great. The meat (realized after I opened it was just loin, not tenderloin) nearly fell apart which was nice (crockpot for 6 or so hours, 2-3 on high rest on low) but it just didn't taste that great. We don't like wine and I was worried about it being too salty if I used all cooking wine after reading the other reviews, so I only put about a 1/4 cup of cooking wine & the rest water with beef boullion added. I won't make this again.

The most tender pork I've ever had! Perfect because we love garlic. Might cut soy down a Tbsp. next time, other than that, it was perfect for our Easter dinner!

Delicious! I added cornstarch to the juices after removing the tenderloin to make a yummy gravy. Served with parmesan garlic mashed potatoes. Yum yum yum. Definitely a keeper.

I loved this recipe!  I was a little hesitant about all that red wine would make the pork sweet, but it didn't at all the onion really offset the wine perfectly...This was a really great slow cooker recipe, and i will for sure make this again, my husband also loved this, and he's pretty critical when it comes to cooking meats!

My husband requires this once a week.  He even told co-workers about it and I've had several requests for the recipe.  Needless to say, it's made it into our regular rotation.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added cornstarch dissolved in water after removing the meat, then cooked on high for an additional 10 minutes to thicken the au jus so it's a gravy.

I have just finished this - and the house smells wonderful!  I doubled the "sauce" ingredients and made a gravy to go over the meat, and it tastes great.  Next time I think that I'll add some green beans and cook them along with the tenderloin.  Thanks!

This was awful. I love pork tenderloin, love red wine, but did not love them together. I absolutely would not waste the time or money to make this dish. The flavors did not meld well, and it was too garlicky as well.

I dodn't have onion soup mix, so i used garlic salt powder and dirend minced onions.  th result was very tasty ;)  I also increased the garlic ( by a lot) and the soy sauce.  I didn't add the wine until about 15 minutes before I served it so it would still have some flavor.

GREAT recipe!  Mine came out a bit salty too, but I think it's because I had to substitute seasonings for the onion dip package because I forgot to buy at the store.  I cooked the tenderloin for 8 hours on low (consistently flipping and basting) and it came out so tender.  In case you're like me and forget the onion package soup, I patted the tenderloin down with onion powder and then sprinkled with McCormicks grill seasoning and adding a healthy dose to the wine/water mix.  I think I may have added a bit too much of this...leading to the extra salt.  I also did half soy sauce, half Bragg.

I registered as a member just to say how delicious this recipe was. Perfect, tender, but my sauce was a little salty because of soy sauce, but awesome dish! Saltiness was my fault.

This was pretty bad.  I followed all the directions exactly, even sprinkling the tenderloins with garlic powder as well and it came out VERY bland.  The hubby ate it, but said it tasted like a boring pot roast.  There are MUCH better things I can do with an expensive pork tenderloin cut!

Exactly like most other people said with this recipe, it's pretty much the best meat I've ever prepared. My fiance went crazy for it and wants it again -- which is rare with his picky tastes. I did sear it with a rub of garlic powder, salt and pepper first, which does help with the color of the pork, makes it not greyish. I didn't find the red wine overpowering at all, but I did use beef broth instead of water which might account for that. My slow cooker has a probe, so I cooked it until it reached the right temperature (160 degrees) and it was perfect - and still sliceable! Amazing is right.

Amazing!  So tender!  Definitely very winey- I might do half the wine with more broth.  And I used Italian Seasoning.

This was very good and tender. Although I thought the onion taste from the soup mix was alittle strong. The next time I think I'll use brown gravey mix instead of the onion soup mix and I'll add fresh onions. My bunch loved it though, there was only one small slice left out of a 3lb tenderloin!!

I was not too impressed with this recipe.  While it was good, the “au jus” really needed some thickening up to stick to the pork, which was needed because the pork was on the dry side.  Overall, it had a good noticeably red wine flavor, but probably not worth making again.

This smelled really yummy while it was cooking. I could even smell it outside! Unfortunately, my roast did not slice well and ended up mostly shredding the pork. Still tasted very good. I'm going to try mixing bbq sauce with the leftovers for pork sandwiches.

Really good. A little salty - so I dropped the soy sauce to 2 tablespoonsfull. Might even drop the onion mix to 1/2 packet. Served it with potatoes (your pick) and sauerkraut. Great dish. Will make it again.

I read a lot of the reviews for this before I actually made it, and I decided to give the soy sauce a shot. I also added some Worcestershire. Let me tell you: leave the soy sauce out! It did smell a little funky.

The pork was cooked perfectly, though. Very tender. And if it weren't for the soy sauce, the gravy would have been amazing.

Easy and delicious!  I made the sauce exactly as written.  The pork was done in only three hours (on low), but my 2 pounds of meet was divided in half.  I added cabbage, baby red potatoes, and carrots to the slow cooker and the result was excellent.

This was definitely easy to make and smelled delish...but, it was way too salty.  I used low sodium soy sauce, but I think the recipe would be better w/o any soy sauce at all.  I should've read the other reviews before making it and replaced the onion soup mix with fresh onions.  I made it with smashed potatoes, and that helped cut the saltiness.  If I do this again, I'll be sure to listen to the other reviewers.

The pork was fantastic, a little dry but thats because it was cooked in the crock pot, but all in all a great tasting tenderloin.  The pork pulled apart beautifully, so much so I decided to add some Devil's Spit (from Famous Daves) and mix it together and make pulled pork sandwiches for left overs.  Would make this again, for pulled pork though.

Fantastic...made it twice now. Pricking it with a fork half way and turning it over really helps. I pricked it many times the first time I made it, and forgot to do it for the second and the tenderness of the meat was affected. Well, I'd also doubled the recipe so I may not have cooked it long enough. Thinking about using a flavor injector next time too!

I followed the advice of many other reviewers and instead of using 3 tbsp of soy sauce, I used only 1 1/2 tbsp soy with 1 1/2 tbsp of Worcheshire. For the wine I used a Beaujolais we had left from our trip to France. The pork came out beautifully. It was so tender you could cut it with a fork. I used the juices to make a gravy and of course made mashed potatoes to go with it. It is an easy meal to make, and definitely a keeper.

My family & I did not care for this recipe. The pork turned out tender however, the seasoning & aroma was too strong for us. I did take the advice of one reviewer and made BBQ pulled pork for sandwiches which turned out excellent! Now I know what to do whenever I have another pork recipe that I do not care for. (Pork loin will never go to waist in my house again!) :-)

Although the loin was amazingly juicy and tender, my husband and I did not care for the strong soy sauce taste. It was even stronger in the leftovers. If I made this again, I would leave out the soy sauce.

Unsure what red wine to use we decided on a Merlot, our favorite red wine to drink. Our roast was bigger as the one in the recipe so we had to change the amounts a bit and ended up with almost covering the roast with the liquid. We cooked it for 7 1/2 hours on low. It was really good. Next time we'll probably add some garlic in the roast to flavor it even more.

Very yummy!  My husband and I both loved it.  I used marsala wine (cause I didn't have anything else), and made my own onion soup mix.  Gravy was terrific too on mashed potatoes.

This recipe was really good, but as others said - I may cut down on the amount of red wine. The meat wound up tasting and smelling a bit like the Merlot that I used.

This recipe was ok but, as someone else mentioned, not too appetizing looking but it was tender.  I omitted the soy sauce and thickened the gravy in a saucepan with a flour/water mixture.  It's nowhere near "amazing"

My DH and I thought this was wonderful. We loved the onion flavor. The broth in the slow cooker made great gravy. I used a little less wine than called for and might lessen the soy sauce a bit next time. My DH is already looking forward to eating this again. Easy and yummy.

I also used this with a beef roast in the slow cooker and it was just as good as the pork.  The meat just fell apart. My husband doesn't like leftovers but he liked this even when I put it back in the crock pot a couple of days later with some canned whole potatoes and let it warm through.  What a wonderful au jus gravy this makes.

This is a very appropriate name for this recipe, even though I used beef stock in place of wine.  Definitely a winner in this house!

This was really good.  I usually try to follow the recipe exactly the first time I try a new dish.  But, after reading the reviews I made 2 small changes.  I only used 1/2 of the soup mix and a 1/2 cup of the red wine b/c my husband does not like it at all, so I didn't want it to be overpowering.  I replaced the other 1/4 cup with water.  I made a gravy from the juices and it was great...still very salty but wonderful with mashed potatoes.  I made it after work so I didn't have time to use the crock pot, I baked it at 325 for about 1 1/2 hours.  Excellent meal.

This turned out wonderful.  I didn't have the packaged onion soup mix, so I substituted 1/2 package of low-sodium beef oxo and threw in some dehydrated onion flakes.  I also used sodium-reduced soy sauce so mine did not turn out at all salty.  Will definitely make again.

My husband loved it, that doesn't happen very often.  It was a bit salty. I made gravey with the extra sauce and it turned out really well.  Easy to do, great Sunday meal.  Left overs were great too.

Reduce soy sauce, add potato to absorb saltiness:I (who an the world's biggest salt snack lover) thought this was extremely salty. On the other hand, saved the left-over pork (without sauce) and used it for sandwiches, which were great.

I was excited to try this after reading all the great reviews but I found it to be kind of bland which is surprising given all the flavors out in during cooking.

Loved it!! The tenderloin was so juicy! I don't have a slow cooker, so I just put it in the oven and cooked it at like 250 degrees for like 3 hours. I spooned the juice back over it several times while it was cooking.  My 5 year old usually only eats steak quickly, but he finished this in record time.  Great flavor.

a very good recipe - our tenderloin was extremely tender & delicious (hubbie loved it).  It made a great main course, but did not wow me like I had anticipated (thus the 4).  A good midwestern meat dish.

I made 2 pork loin roasts for a party, and used 2 different recipes.  This was the one everyone raved about and the easiest to make!  Super tender super moist and the au jus was raved about as well.  I will definitly use this recipe again and again.  I had a larger roast..almost 4 pounds and cooked it on high for 4 hours....perfection!

I've been looking for a different recipe for pork tenderloin.  I've been cooking it similar to how I cook a beef roast.  The name of this recipe is perfect, the tenderloin roast flavor was Amazing!  My husband has decided it's his favorite recipe for a tenderloin.

This was very tastey. I did not have red wine on hand so I used Burgundy instead. I did not find this to be salty at all, bt then again I used a 3 pound tenderloin. The leftover liquid was delicious over the tenderloin slices. Suggestion: I wanted to used up some shallots so I made the shallot butter from the Lover's Burgundy Beef recipe  and let it melt over the tenderloin slices...MMMM-MMMM.

I made this last night - I used about a 1 - 1/2 lb roast and my husband loved it.  I did not have any fresh black pepper to crack so I used regular black pepper and it was still good.  It was very tender and we love garlic.  I did not find this to be too salty either.  My red wine was a sweeter type wine - maybe a drier wine would give it even more flavor but this receipe is a keeper!!  Thanks :)

This was great!!  I made it as stated, except I used rose wine (since that is what I had), and my tenderloin was a little over 4 pounds.  It was wonderful.  The gravey I made from the sauce got mixed reviews.  Definitely will add to my recipe list.

Very easy and delicious!
Thank you from the Sanford Family!
Oh yeah, I didn't have onion soup mix so I used the vegetable soup mix instead...still a winner and a keeper!

Will definately make again.  The au jus is wonderful.  I served this over rye bread and used some of the au jus to sautee some mushrooms, which I then poured over the bread and topped with the pork tenderloin slices.  Wonderful!

We loved this recipe!  I was worried when I saw some of the negatives, but I followed the recipe and it came out perfectly!  I even used a pork loin instead of a pork tenderloin and it still was very tender and cooked perfectly in the 4 hours.  There wasn't really any problem with the salt content for our family, but you could easily substitute real onions & spices for the soup mix.  Awesome!

The reviews about the salt were very useful, I have to agree.  However, despite that I loved this receipe...great marinade for BBQ season as well.

This recipe is exceptional. I do not like pork, but I loved the pork tenderloin using this technique in my slow cooker. I substituted Worcestershire sauce for the soy sauce because I had that on hand. Also, my tenderloin was a little more than 2 pounds so I added a little extra red wine. Excellent for a quick dinner and leftovers for the next day.

I made this recipe for a group of friends.  We LOVED it.  During the cooking, I basted the pork every couple hours or so.  The au jus was great and added so much to the entire experience of eating this dish.
