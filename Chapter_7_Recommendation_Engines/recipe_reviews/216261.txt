AMAZING..... the only modifications that i made was doubling up on the sundried tomatoes n also i used about a quater cup of diced garlic to the stuffing... and to the turkey itsself i sliced half inch holes all over the turkey under the skin about a dozen and a half and inserted half of a peeled garlic clove into the holes in the meat itself and the garlic caramelized like candy... mouth watering and DELICIOUS!!!!

The Stuffing was good. Didn't really care for the tasted sun dried tomatoes gave the stuffing. Will make it again but will try it without the sun dried tomatoes.
