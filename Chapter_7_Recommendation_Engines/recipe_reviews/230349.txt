I bought premade meatballs.  I used the chili sauce and grape jelly as the sauce.  They were great!!

I cheated and used frozen turkey meatballs.  My husband and son went crazy for these sweet and sour meatballs!  Can't wait to make them at camp for a snack to munch on.  Just put everything in the crockpot on low and enjoy them all day!  Great also for a pot luck supper.

I have made this recipe with both frozen and home made meatballs and both ways are great.  I add a can of pineapple chunks and they are always a big hit,

This is the recipe we always use, except we use equal amounts of chili sauce and grape jelly, and they are fantastic.  I can't imagine using three times more chili sauce than jelly. Also, for all you people who use frozen meatballs - you don't know what you're missing.  Frozen meatballs have a coating on them to help preserve them, and the sauce doesn't really penetrate them like it would a homemade meatball.

I have been making this for years but only use 1 jar of chili sauce & 1/2 of a large, or all of a small jar of jelly per pound of meatballs.  I sometimes add a small can of sauerkraut !  I use frozen meatballs most of the time.

48 ounces of chili sauce for a pound of meatballs?  Meatball soup. After significantly changing the ration is was just okay.

I did not like the sauce, too hot, I like hot, but not that hot. I won't make it again. Also the meatballs were too hard.

I have tried this twice, once exactly as written (the four star rating) and found it more of a Sweet and Hot than a Sweet and Sour. I would suggest on cutting down on the hot sauce to about half or so.

The 2nd time I cut the chili sauce down to two bottles added pineapple, red onions and green and yellow bell pepper.  I also added about one third to one half a cup of the pineapple juice and a little corn starch to thicken.   This I served over rice. To me it was very good.  But since is really a new recipe I did not include it in my rating.

Served these at a company party and everyone loved it. I did cheat and used frozen meatballs in place of making my own.
