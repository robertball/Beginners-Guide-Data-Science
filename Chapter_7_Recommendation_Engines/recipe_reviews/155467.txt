I made one according to the recipe, only leaving out the crushed peppermint candy cane as I didn't have one. Very peppermint-y. The next one I added in 1 oz. of chocolate liqueur. Even better. I like it both ways. Very creamy and very rich tasting.

Made these for the holidays. Unfortunately, nobody at our party liked them. Too minty and just...not good. Personal preference I guess.

Really good. Super minty, and great for the holidays. I think my only problem is that you can really only stomach one...
