These were fantastic!    We loved the addition of the cornmeal for a slightly different texture.  Using butter instead of shortening gave them great flavor.  I can see these being made with any herb and maybe even some cheese.  Thanks!

I changed the flour to whole wheat flour, the shortening to oil, and omitted the salt.  The family loves these!  Next time, I will increase the amount of sage!

I couldn't decide between cornbread and  biscuits so I searched for a cornmeal biscuit. These were really good, paired with chicken and dumplings, excellent! Used butter instead of shortening.

Absolutely amazing, and easy. I used rosemary instead of sage, and a whole stick of butter. And just for fun I used a Halloween cookie cutter and had bat biscuits, my husband and friends thought they were adorable and tasted great.

I never review stuff so here goes:left out the sage, added 1/4c sugar but no honey just dropped them on the cookie sheet and baked for 10min=a great homemade version of the corn variety of a popular big biscuit in the blue can.  They were tender, light and fluffy and no one used butter because they didn't need it.

My picky preschooler couldn't decide if she wanted corn muffins or biscuits for school this week, so this recipe was a  good compromise.  I used unsalted butter instead of shortening, grated it into the batter (a trick learned from the Simple Scones recipe on this site) and used my food processor to work the dough together very quickly.  I had 4 ounces of sharp cheddar on hand so I grated that in prior to the addition of the milk.  It resulted in a very sticky batter, so I patted it with my hand and formed about eight biscuits by just grabbing pieces--worked out nicely.  The sage flavor is just about right, maybe because it balanced the cheese I added.  They had a light and fluffy texture and would be nice with a roast or stew dinner...or sausages and eggs for a southern-style breakfast.  Not something you want to eat on their own but a nice complement to hearty fall and winter meals.  My family wasn't wild about them, but I liked them well enough.

I am eating these now and dropping crumbs in my keyboard. They are very good. I might try a little more sage next time, but maybe they are perfect as is.

I made this recipe without the sage to go with chili - yum!!  I plan to make them the next time we have ham & beans instead of cornmeal.  They would be good using a variety of herbs, too.  We have a new favorite biscuit.

I made these following the recipe to a 'T'. I think maybe it was the sage, but we couldn't get one bite down!! However minus the sage they were terrific! I guess maybe sage is an acquired taste!?

These turned out dry. I was hoping that they would be like the corn biscuits that I can no longer find in local grocery stores.

We had these with chili when I didn't have time to make my usual cornbread. My family liked them well enough. Didn't rave over them and I couldn't even taste them because of a terrible cold. :(   Because of what some people said about them not rising enough, I made the last tsp of baking powder heaping. Mine were nice and fluffy and light, though I wish the bottoms hadn't hardened so much. Maybe next time I will do 9 minutes instead of 10 or even knock the cook temp down to 425 instead. Thanks for a good basic recipe. I am sure I will use it again.

Excellent exactly as written, only change was to dust surface with a bit of extra cornmeal for even more crunch. Thank you!

I really liked this recipe - but I didn't use sage b/c I didn't know how it would go with the soup I was serving -  beef lentil.  Instead I used 1/4 c of white sugar and my goodness was it good.  It could be just my oven - but - these cooked FAST.  They were done on the bottom before they were done on the top, I wonder if the temp should be a few degrees less. ?

I didn't care for these. They didn't rise much at all, so they ended up like hockey pucks. I left out the sage, and the taste was OK at best, but they needed a little sugar or honey. Won't make again.

These weren't as good as I'd hoped. I was thinking I'd make them as the Biscuits for the Veggie Biscuit and gravy I wanted to make, and thought the sage in the biscuit would complement the gravy. While the tastes were good together, I found these to be very dry, and they didn't "fluff" up, like I expected them to. I'll stick with the traditional southern buttermilk style biscuits next time.

Interesting combination of biscuit and cornbread muffin. I couldn't really taste the sage, so I'll probably spice it up next time.

These were okay, but not at all what I expected.  We couldn't taste the sage at all, even though I added more than twice the amount called for.  Besides the extra sage I followed the recipe exactly, and they didn't turn out fluffy at all; they were a bit crispy and didn't rise all that much, even though I was very careful not to overmix.  I did like the addition of the cornmeal, however, and they weren't too bad with plenty of extra butter slathered on top.  Overall, though, very bland.

The texture of these is great - fluffy and light with a popping of cornmeal between the teeth.  The sage flavor didn't stand up as we expected; they need to be served with a zesty meal.
