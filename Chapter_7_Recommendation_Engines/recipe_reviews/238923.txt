This chicken is wonderful but I just wanted to save everyone some grief.  DO NOT USE A PYREX DISH UNDER THE BROILER.  Pyrex is not safe under the broiler, it will shatter. I speak from an experience several years ago.  I  use the broiler pan with out the insert. I am a huge Chef John fan but I was surprised to see him using glass under the broiler. Hope this will save someone a lot of trouble.

When you broil in a gas oven, you close the door, as opposed to an electric oven, in which you leave the door open a crack to let out any smoke that occurs during broiling. The gas absorbs the smoke, or at least that's what I learned in my home economics class many years ago.

This was great AND easy.  I used drum sticks and thighs.  Added a little pepper with the salt.  Very tasty, easy and well received by all!

The finished photo with Chef John cutting into this perfectly broiled chicken hooked me on making this. It is a simple and delicious recipe.  I followed the directions using bone-in chicken breasts with the skin on and 
everything turned out great.  Now that your chicken soup recipe is on line, I think I will use those onions and the bones to make a stock.  Thank you again!

This was SO GOOD and so easy to make. I added a little bit of fresh cracked black pepper and a pinch of rosemary. Lunch was awesome. Thanks, Chef John.

Very easy, very quick and delicious. I watched the video which lemon was suggested. I used lime juice...very nice added flavor. The onions were great too. TY, John.

I made the recipe as is and felt that it was good, but nothing really extraordinary. It is  great that it is simple and quick to make. For that reason, I will incorporate this technique using different ingredients.

So easy and so delicious. I can't believe this doesn't have a million five-star ratings. We paired this with the Roquefort PEAR Salad from AllRecipes, and it was a success. Thank you, Chef John!

I added pepper with the salt. After 14 minutes I lowered the rack one notch as I feared it was going to burn. The onions did. When I turned them each time, I scooped the onions under the chicken so they stayed moist and didn't burn anymore. It could be variation in ovens and mine only has one broiler setting. I left the door ajar. It took 30 minutes and we loved it!  So easy and fast. Served with potato salad, corn on the cob and Caprese salad.

I tried and it was easy and delicious. I added garlic powder oregano and pepper, but it is the salt that brings out the flavor.
I cooked it in an electric oven with the door closed and it set off smoke alarm every time I opened the door. I will try with door open next time.

Very easy, quick and delicious.  I did add a bit of rosemary and pepper.  The whole family loved it.  I made gravy with the drippings and everyone said it was the best gravy ever.

Delicious!  Simple and straightforward.  Perfect in 35 minutes at 450 in broiler.  Springer offers a cage -free humane certified 3 pounder.  Used aluminum broiler pan.

I have a question has anyone used this recipe but with boneless, skinless chicken breast? Just wondering if they would be good with no skin and bone. Please help :)

Wow! This recipe was soooo good!   It took a little longer because my chicken weighed more,  but as always with Chef John, it did not disappoint!   Still didn’t take as long as roasting a whole chicken so that was great.  The only thing I added was some paprika along with the salt and it was just perfect.  Side dish was vegetable tikka masala and it paired so well! This is a definite do over. My family loved it. Thanks Chef John!  God bless you for your talent and enthusiasm in the way you teach!  You always come through!

Couldn't be easier. I had no idea chicken this simple could taste so good. I'll add a few spices next time but they're probably not even necessary! Served with rice and salad.

Chicken was excellent.   All that salt on the skin was delicious.
I'm never doing the onions thing again though.  They charred to black and the smoke billowed out and burned my eyes when I opened the oven door.  The whole house smelled for hours.
My oven rack is either 7" or 5" from the broiler elements, so I picked the 7" and put the broil on high.  Next time I'll chose the 5" and put the broil on medium.  I'll also take off the wing to better expose the thick part of the breast to the heat.

This chicken was delicious. After reading some of the comments I realized I shouldn't use the Pyrex casserole dish I had planned to use because I found out that Pyrex  could possibly shatter or crack under the broiler. I also added lemon pepper seasoning to the salt to flavor the chicken. I love how easy and delicious this was, especially the crispy skin! Definitely a dish I will make again and again. Thanks Chef John!

This is just a wonderful, simple, old school broiled chicken recipe - the kind I grew up on - made by my mother or grandmother.  The only thing I did just a little differently was I raised the chicken slightly above the onion rings and added a few lemon rounds to the onions.  Perfect!

Made it as presented, but, meh, kinda boring. My favorite way is using bottled Greek Salad dressing as a marinade, and marinate for 1-2 days...It smelll SO good when it is cooking, and is so very tasty when ready. I use leg quarters or just thighs, lot's more flavor!! My family raves about it!  If your broiler has a high and low setting, use the low setting to prevent burning.

I’ve made this chicken many times. At first I used to buy a whole chicken and cut it up and that was a lot of work. Now for a quick dinner I buy pieces according to my family’s taste and I broil it in the same manner. Usually roast potatoes along with it. When the 28 minutes is up I usually move the chicken down lower and the potatoes up in the oven just Incase the chicken needs a bit more time to roast. In about 45 minutes I have a delicious meal ready, chicken is always moist.
