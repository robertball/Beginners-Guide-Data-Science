I've made this recipe at least 10 times and I absolutely love it!  People I've made them for can't get over how good they are!  A friend told me they are WAY better than any candied nuts she's bought at stores/festivals, etc.  For a pound of nuts, I only use 1/3 C of sugar as I don't believe in using much sugar in anything.  They are PLENTY sweet with that amount!  I also add a t. of vanilla extract to the wet mix!  YUM!!!!!  I've never tried walnuts but I am right now...they are currently baking.  Will let you all know how it turns out!

It was DELICIOUS! I changed some things, though. Instead of water, I used vanilla extract. I also lowered the sugar amount to 2/3 cup-- 1/3 being regular white sugar and the other 1/3 brown sugar. The first time I did this, I didn't lower the salt amount, and it tasted like a salty-sweet snack. They were delicious! This time, I'm lowering it to maybe half a teaspoon for a sweeter taste. You can't go wrong with this recipe!

UPDATE: I lowered the salt to 1/4 tsp as recommended by some users, and I definitely recommend it.

I thought these were very good with the sugar reduced A LOT.  1 Cup sugar for a pound of nuts just seemed like to much to me.  I used just a bit less than 1/3 cup sugar and it was more than enough.

As is, this recipe makes a delicious candied nut. There's no need to change anything -- the amount of sugar and salt are perfect. But if you want to kick it up a couple of notches, here are a few suggestions:
- As mentioned before, replace the water with vanilla.
- Add 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the sugar/cinnamon mixture. The unexpected heat makes people go crazy for them! 
- After you mix the nuts in with the egg mixture, remove them from it using a slotted spoon and then toss them into the sugar mixture. All of the excess egg is not necessary. 
BTW, this recipe works with mixed nuts, as well, but pecans are best. Enjoy!

Everyone at work raves about how delicious these are! I double the batch using 2 pounds of pecans, 2 tsp of cinnamon and 2 egg whites, but then I make some changes:  I replace the water with 2 tablespoons of vanilla, I also cut the sugar to 2/3 cup and only use 1.5 teaspoon of salt.  My co-workers beg me to bring these in when we do our monthly pitch-in lunches.

Out. Stand. Ing.  Addictive and dangerous, as well. I followed the recipe to the letter, eschewing the addition of vanilla or playing around with the amount of sugar and salt.  If you follow the recipe to letter, you will be elated with the results.  Try it once as is, if you feel they're not insanely perfect, then I guess start making additions, subtractions or substitutions.  I certainly won't .  They're a perfect 10 and would make a very welcome gift for special occasions or the holidays.  Helpful hint:  to coat with sugar mixture, place sugar in a large plastic bag, add egg wash coated pecans and shake the bag to coat them.  Each piece will come out evenly coated.

The recipe and directions are overall great. I recommend either omitting the salt all together or decrease the amount to 1/4 teaspoon. An entire teaspoon makes this treat more salty than sweet. I also replaced the water with a teaspoon of vanilla. I never understood the use of water when you can replace it with flavor. And I still had plenty of wet mix to coat the pound of pecans.

Sooo good! I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and they were lightly sweet and perfect for us! Will make them often, specially to add to couple  spinach and goat cheese salads that we like from this site, mmmmm!

This is a great and simple recipe! I read all the reviews first to see what people did different, and I did them all plus my own twist.
First I reduced the sugar to only 1/2 cup, and added honey! Replaced the water with vanilla, same amount of cinnamon, a dash of water,NO SALT but what I did different is instead of mixing the sugar mix separate i just added it in when the pecans were coated with the egg mix.  Then to give it a good twist for the adults I added a cap full of whiskey and vodka. 
Such a great snack for everyone, naturally for children leave out the alcohol but still a great snack. Believe me by adding the alcohol gives it a different sweet taste, can't wait to do this again!

I've made this and it was delicious--an instant hit at a party. It's pretty effortless if you set an alarm every 15 minutes for an hour. Since the pre-packages pecans at my grocery store went by volume, not weight, I found "1 lb" to be unhelpful. I used 3.75 cups of pecans and it was perfect.

Don't skimp on the sugar!!! This recipe is identical to the one I've made for years.  i tried the suggestion to reduce the sugar, and without the full cup of sugar they don't taste nearly as good.

After reading many reviews, I noticed something... the egg whites! they really need to be frothed, I found this key. FROTH well, i did by hand and it really bonded everything together. No liquid left. I did add a 1/2 tsp of cayenne powder and was great! No you cant taste it, just adds a kick.I cut back on salt, but did like some in the flavor. I did half white and half brown and used vanilla instead of water. Great recipe! Thanks for posting

I  just made this recipe and just ruined an entire pound of pecans. I made only slight changes, as suggested by other viewers, but the taste was not entirely the problem. From my experience, it was largely the duration of the baking that ruined the pecans. Not only did mine become WAY over cooked at the 45 minute mark after being  stirred every 15 minutes, but they became unbelievably dry. From what I can sort of taste with my burnt batch is really not all that impressive. This is not a recipe I would use again.

I did the recipe as is.  Perhaps a little less salt then the recipe called for but other then that, I followed the recipe. I thought they came out great. I suppose you could use less sugar but I did not really think they were too sweet. I would do this again. My kids liked them too! They were great in the salad I made them for.

I've been chopping the pecans up into little pieces and doing the recipe and then cool and put in quart jars to use on salads...  I've also been experimenting with stevia instead of sugar with great results... Sometimes I freeze the little pieces on a cookie sheet and then put in the quart jars in freezer if I make more than I need.  Great addition to salads or for a little sweet snack!

The reviews of other cooks were wonderfully helpful. I loved seeing about using less sugar. I wish I had made the association to use less salt as well. As an inexperienced cook, I would have loved to have seen a tip about lining the baking sheet with aluminum or some other advice to prevent the mess I had. Maybe I was supposed to remove the nuts immediately. Regardless, except for too much salty flavor, they tasted good. I will experiment again and do like someone else suggested-mix brown sugar with regular sugar.

I halved the recipe since I only had an 8 oz. bag of pecans.  I used 1/4 cup of sugar and only 1/4 tsp. of salt since the nuts were already salted.  I didn't mess with trying to cut the egg white in half and used the whole thing along with a splash of vanilla with the water before whisking the liquid mixture.  These are delicious and I can't wait to use them in salads (if I don't eat them all first!).

Sweet, salty & crunchy, a perfect recipe. I did not have pecans so I used walnuts & lined the cookie sheet with parchment paper. A pound of nuts equals about 4 cups. Today I am using almonds & gifting these tasty treats to a lucky friend. Also chopped a few to use in a salad.

I tested three candied pecan recipes. They were all relatively simple, but this one was the least easy,  but not bad. This recipe won for taste, texture and overall addictiveness by far! I did make one change each time I made it. The first time I used a mix of sugar and sugar substitute, that included turbinado sugar, brown sugar, and xylitol. The second time I simply mixed white and brown sugar. I love brown sugar recipes so I had to try.  The egg white gave the nuts a great crispiness and ensured they were adequately coated. Personally, I liked the balance the salt provided and no one thought they tasted at all salty. One of the recipes I used (not this one) called for vanilla. It seemed to dilute and alter the sweet cinnamon nutty flavor. I really thought this recipe was perfect!

I've made these twice because they disappear so fast. They are fabulous with no adjustments. I did try a little variation with the second batch. I added some brown sugar in place of the white because I love brown sugar, and I made a half recipe and didn't measure the water or get exactly half of the egg white. They didn't turn out as good, and were stickier.

Love them, wished I've  would've  added full cup of sugar that recipe  called  for instead  of lesser amount that  i read on reviews. I'll  know  better  next  time cause I'll  definitely be making these again. And the added vanilla  was a nice touch next time i might try rum extract?

USE CLOVES for a nice twist! 
I doubled this recipe with the following changes: For TWO LBS: 1 cup of sugar (1/3 raw, 1/3 brown), went scant on t of salt and added 1/2 t of ground cloves. they came out perfect and so aromatic from the cloves. used 2 t of vanilla and 2 t of water along with 2 egg whites.  plenty of coating for me, I want to be able to taste the nut too, not just a hard ball of sugar. thanks for all the suggestions in the reviews.

Really enjoyed this very easy to make recipe.  A touch to sweet for me I followed the recipe the first time then remade it with 3/4 cup of sugar and added 1tsp of white pepper and another 1/2 tsp of salt to give it a little kick and balance that sweetness. With those changes it was the perfect candied pecan recipe for my family.

My first try was with a spiced pecan recipe that ended up burnt.  I tried this one since the temperature was dramatically dropped. I used recipe exactly except for the following:  1 TBS water and 1 TBS vanilla.  I cooked them only 45 minutes since my pecans looked dry at that point and I was afraid to burn them again.  My only fear is that I'll eat them all before Thanksgiving tomorrow! So good.

This is a great, easy recipe! I made these on a Saturday evening and they're almost gone (it's Tuesday early afternoon as I write this). I was going to give some to friends but there are only a few handfuls left!! I doubled the batch using 2 pounds of pecans. Since this was a double batch, I used 1 tablespoon vanilla and 1 tablespoon water instead of all water. Regarding the salt, I only used the one teaspoon as originally called for in the recipe for 1 pound of pecans. I would, however, double it next time like all of the other ingredients for a little saltier taste. It all comes down to personal preferences, though. Thank you, Alix, for this wonderful recipe that I will continue to make for years to come!!

Used the changes recommend by others.  Lowered the sugar by half, and added vanilla.  Everyone loves these nuts.

I made two batches. One as written and one where I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup and used bourbon instead of water. We liked the bourbon flavor much better. Next time I will try brown sugar or on the grill with som hickory chips for smoke.  This is a keeper.

I've made these as posted several times, they are great.  I have also added a tsp of vanilla to the egg mixture and that turns out great as well...adjust salt/sugar to your personal taste and you won't be disappointed.

Hard to mess this simple recipe up at all. If they are done earlier than an hour, great, if not, then be patient, some ovens run hot, some cold! They are tasty and addictive. Eat them alone, or in salad, or with ice cream!  Even friends who DON'T like candied anything, or nuts,  eat them when I make them! GREAT!!!

These are very tasty! They can be eaten on their own, or I chop them and put them on top of my zucchini bread and muffins.  I made them originally for  green salads but they were two cinnamon sweet and didn't go over well for that.

So easy and turned out great... just like the expensive roasted nuts we buy at the mall and shows. The little bit of salt creates a buttery taste when the nuts get warm. The amount of sugar & cinnamon is perfect. You could probably use walnuts, almonds, cashews or a mixture of them.

AMAZING recipe. The entire family loved them, I did follow the suggestions and only used 1/3 cup of sugar,  definitely a new family recipie ESPECIALLY for picky eaters. After about 30 mins I take it out and sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top just for some extra sweetness!!

I have made this recipe 4 times in the past two weeks.  I have used pecans, walnuts and almonds.  They all have turned out great.  Our favorite are the pecans.  As another reviewer suggested, we use vanilla instead of water and use brown sugar and white sugar.  I double the batch with no problem and they never last more than a day.  They are addicting!!

Made this with pecans several times during the holidays and everyone asked for more!  I used vanilla instead of water, 1/2 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar instead of all white, tried sea salt this time. This is probably my 5th time making this recipe, but this time I’m using cashews. They are baking at this moment. I froth the egg white mix really well, mix in the nuts, then throw them in a zip top baggie with the dry ingredients. I pour them out on parchment lined baking sheet and it’s Easy Peasy. Wanted to try just few with cayenne, but did not have any. Will give it a try on next round!

Very tasty & easy recipe. Made a few alterations based on the experience of others. Used half the amount of sugar, substituted vanilla extract for water & used half pecans, half walnuts.  So good on salads or just to much on as a snack, but beware, these are addictive!

I've made these from other recipes and they did not turn out nearly as well as these did. That said, I was having an off day when I made this recipe and did not follow the directions as written but still they turned out great! I actually mixed up all of the ingredients (and added vanilla beans and a teeny bit of powdered cardomom and fresh ground nutmeg) and coated the nuts and it all worked out fine. Mine had more of a crystallized coating on them but it was crunchy and oh so divine! I made these to add to my chicken salad recipe but it's been really hard not to sit down in front of the tv and just eat the entire batch as a snack!

I added rum extract with the cinnamon and cut back on the sugar to 2/3 of a cup.   Smelled so good in the oven that my teens got off their PS4 to come see what was cooking.  
Delicious!

I wanted a great topping for my sweet potato casserole, and I wanted it to be sweet, savory, and crunchy.  I made a full recipe of the sugar mix and used half of it on 2/3 lb of pecans, then mixed the extra super with 1/3 cup of brown sugar and used it to candy some pre-cooked bacon as well. The bacon won't harden in the oven, but it will once it cools on parchment paper.  Once everything cooled I chopped it up and mixed the bacon and pecans together. Everything is super delicious,  and I'm pretty sure my sweet potatoes are going to steal the show at Thanksgiving!

I made these last night and they are amazing!!  Usually I follow recipes exactly, but I was trying to find one that I saw a few days back and I couldn't, so I altered a bit to be closer to that.  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon.  YUM!!  After reading the reviews, I used vanilla instead of water and I only used about 3/4 of the salt.  Turned out amazing!!  I made these for Thanksgiving (in two days) and I really hope I can stay out of them until then.  They are just that good.

I love it! They are not gummy as some recipes turn out. I normally salt nothing, adding only 1/3 of the salt called for in recipes when absolutely necessary. On this one it is important to add the salt. I do not fill the spoon to the top but near there! That is my only concession.  It balances the sweet and spice. It is possible to retain the 'candied' aspect with 1/3 less sugar but I've found to reduce it further loses that sweetness and doesn't balance with the salt and spice.
I have an old Wedgewood gas stove so my oven is about 250 degrees all year round. I just put them in and stir every so often. I noted from some reviews the need to suggest lining the baking sheet! I use foil to line my pans for almost every thing! Reduces clean up significantly. I bake cookies on parchment which is now available everywhere at reasonable prices. 
I made about 5 lbs of these for our Church Gift Faire and we let people sample the little fragments as many were unfamiliar with them. We sold them in little ziplock bags weighing 2 ounces. Naturally they sold out! 
I'm ready to start the ones for Christmas today!

I made a test batch using pecans, walnuts, and almonds. This is so good! Changes I made: I put half tbsp water/half tbsp vanilla (I think I might do all vanilla next time), I only used a pinch of salt, I add a smalllll amount of ground cloves and nutmeg. They only ended up cooking about 45 mins and then I felt they were done for my taste. 

Very delicious! However, I feel like this recipe worked the best with the pecans. And I might not add the cloves again, as even that small amount came through a lot (if you love the taste of cloves, add it!). This is what I'm making for christmas gifts this year! :)

Fantastic!  My changes: I use half water/half good (real) vanilla; I decrease the sugar to 3/4 cup and they're still "candied" enough; and I increase the cinnamon to 1 tablespoon (I generally triple the cinnamon in anything I make).  Everyone I gift these to LOVE them.

So simple and delicious!  We aren't fans of cinnamon so we leave it out and add about 1/2 tsp more of salt. I use the extra fine himalayan salt so it disperses well.  Really love this and have made several batches.

I used the measurements called for, but after reading the reviews I was a bit nervous they would be too sweet.  Since I'd already combined my dry ingredients, I added about 1/2 teaspoon more salt.  They're certainly not healthier this way, but they're delicious! I also sprinkled some chinese 5 spice on about 1/4 cup of the nuts to try them that way and those were really good too. I'm excited to experiment with different seasonings to see what other combinations will taste like. YUM!

I loved this recipe. Super easy. I added twice the cinnamon and some cardamom. Just because it sounded good at the time.

Um, these are amazing. Planded to give a bunch as a gift, but ended uplease eating half before we could get the rest wrapped. Planned to follow other reviewers' suggestions and switch vanilla for water, but had none as we have just moved to a new house. I did, however, have bourbon on hand (priorities). What a fantastic  match. These bad boys taste great. Haled the salt as recommended, but left the sugar as is for a nice thicK coating. Crunchy.sweet.deliciousness.

I made these last-minute for munchies on Thanksgiving, and I'm so glad I did! They were gone lickity-split, and I'm making more to send in Christmas boxes because my family kept raving about them. Even my non-snacking cowboy husband looked at me and said "These are REALLY good." which from him is extremely high praise. The best part? This recipe is so simple and takes just a minute to throw together. Definitely recommend.

I've tried this recipe as is and then with a reduced amount of sugar.  Frankly, I prefer the original recipe. Either way, it's easy to make and super delicious. A great little Christmas gift for friends and family.

Reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup per another reviewer's suggestion and kept the salt the same and nuts came out more savory than sweet. Will reduce salt as well next time and add some chili or cayenne for a kick. Keep stored in airtight container as nuts will quickly absorb moisture and lose their light crisp. Will be making as gifts for Christmas!

Very good and sweet I only rated it 4 stars because the 1 cup sugar calling made the pecans almost a little too sweet. I will probably try them again sometime except maybe with a half cup instead of a full cup very good snack as well though! If you have one, you have to have a few more!

Made these for teacher appreciation week tonight and we must really appreciate these teachers because otherwise my family and  would have eaten them all!  Soooo good!!! I added a vanilla glaze in stripes because they reminded me of cinnamon buns so I figured, what the heck, lets guild the lily. I can't wait to get these out of my house or the teachers won't have many to munch! Thanks for the great recipe!

Very easy to prepare and very good!  I used half the sugar as others here have, and did a mix of brown sugar and turbinado raw sugar.  I also added homemade vanilla (vanilla beans in Brandy) instead of water to the eggs.  Wonderful!

I made a batch of these, as is, with the addition of some vanilla for flavor. And I also made a different batch that was cooked on the stove top. Of the almost 20 people who tried them, they all agreed this was the favorite of the two. I WILL be making these again for Christmas. Thank you for the use of your recipe. I believe I will try some alterations for next time.

This recipe could not have been easier or more flexible!! You could add any spice you like. I used a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, sea salt, and white pepper. In a lot of the reviews the amount of sugar was reduced, I didn't, because I used the full amount of sea salt. My family loves that salty sweet combination. Very happy with the results! This would be a great "no sweat" recipe to use for an economical, personal, from the heart edible gift. In these hard economical times my family and friends really appreciate yummy gifts!

This was my first time making any kind of candied nut. The recipe was super easy and didn't really take that long. I did change a few things. I subbed in Vanilla extract for the water and did not at the salt since my pecans had salt on them already.

This recipe is AMAZING!  Thank you for some great suggestions.
mine turned out perfectly.

I did make some minor changes (below) and didn't find them too sweet or salty. I get a hint of the salt but probably due using a coarser grind pink sea salt. They are sweet but I dont find them as sweet as some of the store bought ones I've tried. 

I will say that I do have a sweet tooth and do use salt (only sea salt- not sure if that matters). I only state this because some people write reviews but don't give an indication to their level of tolerance, or a comparison to something relatable.

So, if you're like me and are wondering is this really too sweet or salty? I just did a taste test with mine (as made below) against a finger dollop of honey and against a snickerdoodle I made the other day. Bite for bite, both the cookie and honey were sweeter tasting than these candied pecans.

I substituted:
• 1tbsp of vanilla for water 
• 1/2 c Brown Sugar & 1/2 c. White Sugar
• Approx 3/4 tsp Pink Sea Salt (fresh ground and a bit of a course grind. Not fine).

I added all sugar and spice into a large ziploc bag and shook to mix it.
I frothed the wet ingredients until stiff (no liquid left) and stirred in pecans.
I added the pecans to the ziploc and shook to coat them all.
Placed them on parchment paper lined cookie sheet and into the oven. I stirred them around every 15 min for an hour.
After they cooled they were crunchy perfection. 
Try them, you won't be disappointed.

This recipe is perfectly delicious!  I've actually made it 5 times previous to today.  I have tried other candied pecan recipes both oven baked and stovetop methods.

This particular recipe is simply divine and is "my go to" recipe as of 3/28/2018.  Gift giving is yet another reason that this version of candied pecans is "my go to" recipe.  I can always give these candied pecans with confidence and assurance that I'm gifting the best.  Enjoy!!

I made exactly as written and they were very good.  My only critique is that I think I may reduce the salt by half next time.  I am actually notorious for salting my food, so I didn't worry about the teaspoon called for in the recipe, however, the salt taste jumped out at me when I tried them. Maybe I was expecting a stronger cinnamon flavor?  Regardless these are still tasty, and I suspect will be excellent in a salad.

These candied pecans are so good and so easy. I followed the recipe with one exception. I had to increase the baking time in order to get the pecans to dry completely. After they were cooled I put them into jars and gave as gifts. People raved over them. The salt, cinnamon and sugar combine to create the perfect blend of flavor and though there is no butter in the recipe they have a buttery flavor as well. I will continue to make these on a regular basis.

These are great!  Adjust the seasoning/sugar according to your taste. So much better than the premodern stuff bought in the stores. I made them to add to some Praline Pecan fudge that is totally nostalgic to my brothers and sisters (our great aunt made this for us every single year she was alive). I’m not thinking about adding additional nuts and giving them as part of my Christmas gifts next year.

I put them in for 1 hour stirring every 15 minutes. They are burnt. Ruined a pound of pecans! 45 minutes is probably long enough!

Just pulled these out of the oven--and they are amazing! I used a pound and a half bag of pecans, 1.25 cups of sugar (because most of the reviews said they were too sweet?) I used 1.5 tbsp vanilla, .5tbsp water, 2 egg whites, and added nutmeg and a pinch of ginger. I did use ~1tbsp of salt, I guestimated in my palm. I have to say that next time I will be using 1.5 cups of sugar (to this pound and a half conversion) as I think I enjoy my nuts a bit sweeter, but everyone else loves them as I made them :)

I made these for the first time--and it worked well.  I followed the recipe, no changes, and it turned out just fine.   I think 'frothy' is open to interpretation though. Total oven time was 1 hour, but it took longer to cook because I took them out every 15 minutes to stir/turn them.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the sugar coating remained fairly granular--I'm not sure if that was me or something I did, but maybe it has to do with what frothy egg whites are supposed to be.  End result--really yummy!

Delicious! I They turned out perfectly. To my personal preference I used a little less sugar and cinnamon. I made them to use in an Arugula salad (with red grapes, gorgonzola, candied pecans and orange fennel vinaigrette).  Because this recipe makes more than I needed for the salad, I used the leftovers in the banana oatmeal cookies III from this website, instead of the walnuts it calls for, and I reduced the sugar in the recipe a bit. Also delicious! But even on their own, they are  a very yummy snack!!

Awesome! Made this with walnuts (personal preference), and subbed vanila for the most of the water, and reduced sugar just a little, with half brown and half white sugar.  What a great recipe - no need for a candy thermometer or getting a sugar syrup to the right temp.  I love recipes like this.  Sending most to my sister, but keeping a handful for us.  I'll have to make this again just for us two!  Thanks for posting.  UPDATE: Made this again using almonds and, separately, peanuts.  Yum times two!

Great recipe and very easy.  Similar to others, I cut the salt to 1/4 t, doubled the cinnamon, reduced the sugar to 1/2 C (mix of white and brown), and replaced part of the water with 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.  Will definitely make again.

I got this recipe from a coworker in 2011 and I make these every year now for Christmas. Whether it's as gifts for family or for work potlucks they're always a big hit. I add a little fresh grated nutmeg and about 1 1/2 times the cinnamon that the recipe calls for though.

I have made these many times and found that using 2/3 cup sugar is enough to be sweet but not candied.  I also add 1 teaspoon vanilla to the frothy egg.   Adding 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the cinnamon/sugar mix gives the nuts a sweet bite in the beginning and a spicy bite at the end.  So good.

This is an excellent recipe for Candied  Pecans.  Give it away as a Christmas  or Hostess/Host gift! I'll be doing it this year, again. The low temp and stirring them every 15 minutes is worth the effort for the tastiness. And you won't burn it the nuts. Wrap a present, make a phone call : ).

Adjusted the ingredients to: 0.75 cup sugar, 1.5 teaspoon cinnamon, 0.75 teaspoon salt, 0.5 teaspoon chipotle powder. To the egg white I did not use any water but added: 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1 tablespoon Bailey's Irish Cream. Used both pecans and walnuts, and baked on a parchment lined pan which made cleanup a breeze. The nuts had lots of crunch factor without being sickening sweet, and the chipotle added just enough pleasant heat and no mouth on fire.

I've made this several times... Easiest thing to use is a Gallon size zip lock bag... I put 2/3c sugar..1 tsp cinnamon..1/2 tsp salt ..in small bowl.. Whisked 1egg white with 1 tsp water til frothy..(use a small glass).. Pour egg mixture into bag.. over the pecans....then shake..  Pour sugar mixture into bag.. shake.. pour onto baking pan.. Use parchment paper for easy clean up.. ..bake 250.. 1 hour.. stir every 15 mins.. .. after completely cool.. store in air tight container..    (I cut back on the sugar because I was ending up with a lot.. in the bag.....but with 2/3 cup sugar..I did not... I cut back the salt... due to wanting it sweeter..not salty..

My husband couldn't stop eating these!!! I did use vanilla instead of water and cut back the salt like other suggested but I also already had a cinnamon sugar mix I keep around and I know it has more cinnamon in it than called for but I LOVE cinnamon! I am going to  make this again with different mixes you could easily do a sweet and spicy or savory recipe with these. Thanks for posting!

I've made this recipe at least a dozen times, and my friends and family fight over it.

I've found they're equally as good (in fact maybe better) with only a 1/4 cup of sugar... they're not quite as "candied", but they're still sweet and delicious and won't send you into a diabetic coma.

Followed this recipe to the letter; it came out perfect! Everyone who treated them couldn't believe I made them, they're much better than the overpriced candied pecans that you can buy.
I'm making my 2nd batch right now. My family lives them!

I didn't have any vanilla but, next time I'll try adding some in place of the water.
This was so easy and so tasty.  I made them for Christmas gifts for friends - they're lucky to get any of them!!
I've always loved them roasted and salted, but, this is my new favorite!  I won't be waiting for the holidays to make them again.

I made this on Thanksgiving and it was a hit. My aunt who is picky loved them and could not keep her hands out of the dish. I did change a little. I added 2eggs, 2tablespoon of vanilla, no salt, 1/2 cup of sugar and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Will make again for Christmas!!!

Big hit!  Made these to put on a pumpkin cheesecake. Instead, everyone gobbled them up before dessert.  I did cut back on the amount of sugar.

I followed other reviews and used 1 T. vanilla instead of water, reduced sugar to 1/2 c, decreased salt to 1/4 tsp, and added a dash of cayenne. Sooooo good--super sweet with just a hint of salt and spice. Not enough egg wash for a pound of pecans, though. I would double egg and vanilla next time and drain off the excess before tossing with the sugar mix. Spices would be easy to play with--maybe 1/4 tsp. each of ground cloves, nutmeg, and/or allspice in addition to the cinnamon. This is the recipe I've been looking for! :-)

I cut both sugar and salt in half, and we still couldn't stop eating these! Wonderful texture and flavour without being too sweet. I was wondering about them having too much cinnamon for the salad I used them in, but it worked out fine! The best part is that they are so easy to make, not being done on stovetop. I always burn them if I have to babysit them too closely. With these I just set the timer for 15 min turned them and then repeated until 1 hour was done. I even missed the 45 min "tossing" but they still turned out great. This will be my go-to candied pecan recipe from now on.

Great recipe. I was recently at a festival where I bought a bag of candied pecans. They were very expensive, and I ate the whole bag very quickly. So I decided to make the pecans using this recipe. I'm very happy with the way they turned out. I was unsure about adding the salt but it really makes the flavor pop. I will make this again.

I made this recipe with three minor modifications, I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and I used chopped pecans instead of halved. I think it turned out perfect and all the pecan pieces are evenly coated.  I can see how this may be a bit too sugary if you use pecan halves as there's not as much surface area to cover.  That said, I love them and I've found my new go to snack, salad topper and ice cream mix in.  YUM!

Only made 4 ozs.  I used 1 tbsp egg white, 1.5  tbsp white sugar, used 1 teas  vanilla and 2 teas water,  1/4  teas cinnamon and omitted the salt.  Baked for 1 hour stirring every 15 minutes.  Yummy in salads.

I made these candied pecans for the topping of a treat that I made with my granddaughters for Christmas gifts this year.   I also used half the salt and the pecans were delicious.

Made this low carb!  Also, doubled the cinnamon and used 1 t vanilla in place of some of the water.  I subbed the sugar with 1/4 cup packed brown sugar (about 53g carb and about 214cal) and 1/2 cup Splenda granulated (NOT the sugar blend, 12g carb, 48 cal).  The pecans themselves (1 lb) have 3100 cal and 62g carbs.  The other ingredients are negligible (ok, egg white is 17 cal).  For a total of about 3380 cal and 127 carbs for the whole recipe.  You'll have to do the math yourself to see a per serving count, cause you know it's hard to stop eating!  But you definately are going to save on cals and carbs using the Splenda and it still tastes great.  Everyone at work raved over these!

I've taken this recipe and several others and actually made them enough now to not require referring to the site.

Variations include:
 
-half brown sugar and half white sugar (preferred by every sampling I've put forth).

-sub 1/2 to 1 tsp of water with vanilla extract (my preference here, less cared about in either direction from samplers)

-vegan friendly substitute unsweetened applesauce for the egg white (of the 6 varieties I've made, this was about 40/60 split on egg white vs unsweetened applesauce as the better version).

You can go a little heavy on the egg whites/applesauce but not water/vanilla when making these and add about 10 extra minutes for baking time.

As written above these were good, and I occasionally make them with original recipe, but generally at least include 1 of the above adjustment options, currently in the middle of making two pounds pecans for a potluck tomorrow with all 3 mentioned substitutions. (These are essentially the expected offering for any and all family/friend/work functions now).

I tested a small batch of the candied pecans in preparation for a ministry fundraiser.  I also made the candied pecans for my daughter-in-law for her birthday.  They are awesome.  Simple ingredients and preparation.  Great gift ideal.

As a friendly reminder,   don't wander out of the kitchen while the pecans are in the oven.  I burnt two batches during the time I step away from the kitchen and lost track of time.

everyone loves these.  what I did was go 3/4 white and 1/4 brown sugar or dark brown plus a pinch of cayenne.    I don't think the entire coating is required for one pound so I save some for later in  a glass jar.  parchment paper, baking  cover for the pan is a great idea.  gets sticky.

This is an amazing treat! As with others, I tried it as is first, then tweaked a bit. Used vanilla instead of water, and just used a very small amount of salt.  My co-workers loved them, so now I'm the candied pecan person for holiday treats. Very easy recipe, and very good!

Delicious!!! I took the advice of others who posted their reviews and substituted the 1 tbsp of water with 1 tbsp of vanilla extract. I also reduced the salt from 1 tsp to 1/3 tsp.

Some have suggested reducing the amount of sugar used. I used 1 cup of sugar as outlined in the recipe and could see how reducing that amount might be better. There was plenty of excess sugar that didn't coat onto the pecans and just sat onto the baking sheet.

In the end, this recipe has absolutely made it into my collection of must-haves.

If you double the cinnamon, and add a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of cardamon, it's fabulous!

Worked perfectly. I made this recipe with pecans and almonds, (separately). Note: with almonds, you need 1 and 1/2 lbs for this recipe. People were so impressed they thought Blue Diamond made them!!

These are simply fantastic!!! They are so addicting. The only thing I would suggest is to make sure you flatten them into a single layer on the baking sheet when baking.  Hubby can't stop eating them so make sure you make lots of them as they won't last long!!!

I made 4 individual batches. This is a great recipe. For each batch, I used 3/4 cup sugar and 1tbsp vanilla instead of water. It worked out fine with less sugar.  For 2 of my batches,  I wanted a spicy sweet version so  I added 1 tsp cayenne pepper. They turned out so good!  I can't wait to make these again. I'm jarring them up to give as gifts to my neighbors. Give this recipe a try, it is so easy & you wont be disappointed! Thank you!

Like so many people, I love these pecans. They’re like crack. And like many people, I had to fiddle with the recipe. Reduce the sugar to 1/3 c, add 1/4 t cayenne, add 2t vanilla to the wet mix. This works with 1/2 c pecans without adding extra ingredients. I use Penzeys Apple Pie spice in place of the cinnamon (2 different cinnamons, nutmeg, mace and cloves).

I'm amazed at how delicious these came out.  I did make some changes after reading some reviews. I used vanilla extract instead of water with the egg whites. I cut back the suger to 3/4 c and I cut back on the salt and used 1/2 tsp. It was the perfect amount to salt. Looking forward to making these again.

I made this exactly to recipe. They are super easy to make and very good. I feel they are missing just a little something, so I will try the vanilla extract so many other reviewers have added. I made a double batch this first time and I am sure they will all get eaten up in no time!

This was real easy to make.  My 8 year old daughter and I made a double batch using a two pound bag of Kirkland pecans, because bulk is better?  I used 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, along with the cinnamon, and the result was epic.  They didn't last very long, and I also gave them out as gifts to neighbors in mason jars.  They were all gave five star reviews.

The first time I followed the recipe to the letter but like other reviewers found the amount of sugar a bit too much (there was a ton of loose sugar in the bottom of the Ziploc bag I put them in) but I decided not to alter the sugar or salt amount the 2nd time. I did however sub homemade date syrup for the water since I had it on hand. To make these vegan I would sub the egg for aquafaba.

Very tasty but have more of a bumpy than smooth coating, compared to Dawn's Candied Walnuts, also on this site, which have a smoother coating.  These take more time to make, but they are very good as well.

This is a great recipe. My wife and I are on a low carb diet and I replaced the sugar with a cup of Swerve. No one can tell it's not sugar. It has become our favorite snack. I've also replaced the pecans with raw almonds and they turned out great also.

I personally add nearly double the cinnamon and a teaspoon of apple pie spice as well. A few shakes of red Pepper gives it a little heat.

Just made this and OMG, they're amazing! I followed some suggestions and used 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, and vanilla instead of water. Perfection!

This recipe was better than I ever expected. I did add some red pepper as mentioned in another review and it was perfect.  In fact I am adding these to my cookie boxes that I give out to my friends and family at Christmas this year.

Easy and delicious. I might use a bit less sugar next time to avoid “clumping” of sugar on the pecans, just my preference. Makes a great hostess gift in cello bag with ribbon!

Took some of the reviewers suggestions and decreased the sugar and salt, used vanilla extract instead of water. Wonderful flavor! Cooked a little longer and got a nice crisp. Only issue I have is that the sugar stays grainy. Thinking next time I'll either mix the sugar with the liquid first to try and dissolve it, or use confectioners sugar.

I made these for my husband and didn’t read any reviews beforehand. I’m glad I did. He thought these were amazing, and we made them twice today! I agree they were salty, which I wasn’t expecting, but I think it brings out the flavor.

Turned out very well   Found if you use 2 egg whites you get a more moist coating when you put sugar mix on. It gets into the cracks and gives (I think) a better finished product

Hello all. These candied pecans are so amazingly simple to make, yet so scrumptious! I've made them the traditional way, but also sugar-free, I mixed the sugar free recipe with Splenda and also added a teaspoon of vanilla and they come out so very good. They are a huge hit at parties and pot lucks. Happy baking

These tasted great.  I made them as gifts to friends and family.

I did use almonds (tasted great), I think I'll probably try it with the pecans so I can evaluate which I like best.

I smoked these in my smoker for about an hour at 250, but they didn't pick up much of the smoke flavor.  I think I'll try smoking for an extra 1/2 hour next time.

I read some of the reviews and I think salt to sugar ratio is spot on.  I may also add vanilla and a little heat next time.

There are many ways you can take this recipe to satisfy your own tastes.

(update 11/15/19)
I just made this recipe again, this time using Pecans.  I added about 1 Tblsp. of vanilla to the egg mixture and these are fantastic!!

I've doubled the recipe both times I've made this and its never enough.  (About 1/4 of the nuts disappear before making it into containers.)

This is a great technique! One egg white whipped with 1 Tbsp. Water is the perfect coating for 1 pound of nuts.  The sugar/cinnamon/salt mixture is prefect.  These are great as a topping for a pear/blue cheese/red onion/greens salad!

Amazing! I accidentally mixed the dry ingredients with the wet without coating the pecans with wet mix first so I put pecans in a colander and rinsed with water and then coated with mixture. This made the recipe a little more wet so I baked and stirred at 17 minute intervals. Came out perfectly! Will definitely be making this again!

So easy!  They are delicious and make a great gift!  I have made this several times and each time it turns out perfect.   I want to try giving it a little kick with some cayenne pepper.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit!  I originally used water as written, but the last few times I have used vanilla in place of water (same amount).  I like that even better!

Perfect for holiday gifts. These seem impressive even though they are so easy. We loved them as is but I also made a batch with a bit less salt and more cinnamon and enjoyed those as well.

Delicious - I really enjoyed the candied pecans from this recipe. I would like to try and increase the temperature slightly to see if the pecans can be less dull.

Love these!! After reading many of the reviews, I did make a few adjustments.  I reduced the sugar to 3/4c (mixed white and brown sugar), used half the amount of salt, and instead of water used vanilla extract. Parchment paper made clean up a breeze!!

So good!!! On the advice of some of the reviews here, I switched out the cup of sugar for a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a 1/4 cup of white sugar and left everything else the same. 
I use these in a salad with leafy greens, sliced strawberries, red onion, raspberry vinaigrette, and crumbled goat cheese. My favourite warm weather lunch.

I made this with 1/3 c sugar  and with 1/2 c sugar. 
1/3 is plenty and the texture of the pecans is more visible instead of being buried in a sugar glaze. 
As another review suggested-make sure to froth the egg white and the liquid amount is just right. I also add only 1/4 t salt. 
This recipe is a hit every time!!!

AMAZING !!! House smelled delicious while these were baking .Per others reviews,I also substituted vanilla for the water  & placed the cinnamon sugar mix into a ziploc bag .I stirred the pecans thoroughly to make sure all were coated and wet with the eggwhite mixture.Toss into the bag for the sugar coating then bake I made these to bring to a party and we can’t stop eating these fresh out of the oven !! I may have to make another batch now for the party KEEPER for sure!!!

Yum! These are excellent - hard to stop noshing on them. Like others, I cut the sugar to 2/3 of a cup and used half brown; I replaced the water with vanilla, and I removed the pecans from the egg white mixture before tossing them with sugar rather than mixing the sugar in so there wasn't too much liquid. With those changes, this is a serious winner!

Everyone loved it. The only thing I changed was the sugar.
My husband is a diabetic, so I used 3/4 cup of splenda instead of sugar. It came out great. Will make them like this from now on. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made one batch with the cinnamon and one without for our Christmas get together, and everyone loved them and wanted the recipe. We all preferred without the cinnamon though!

Easy and , oh so yummy!  I used raw, unsalted pecans and thought they came out slightly salty.  Next time I’ll use a little less salt.

Taste and texture were exactly what we hoped. Cut recipe in half due to amount of pecans on hand. Read where someone complained they were dried out  / burnt, lowered bake time to about 25 minutes = absolutely perfect.

Well this recipe isn't to my liking. I have a recipe I use but it's packed away.... So I tried this one. I should have know better about the salt... 
It was too salty and the sugar didn't become smooth. Maybe I didn't have enough egg white.. I think 2 egg white or use less sugar and unless you love salt, I'd omit it. Well good luck to anyone who tries this.

SO good! Followed directions and sprinkled kosher salt on the pecans while they were cooling. It cut some of the sweetness and made it more of a "sweet/salty" combo. Have made it a couple of times over the holidays - for a party and then for gifts.

A little to much sugar.  Next time I’ll cut it down by a bit, and cut the cinnamon down too.  Overall , they turned out good.  Every one loved them at Christmas time

I've made these many times, everyone loves them. I always add extra nuts because there's always leftover sugar mixture. 
My SIL 'hates' when I make these cause she can't eat just a few they are addicting.  Great to make and bag for gifts.
++Still making these for years now, 
MY TIPS:
-I've cut the sugar in half and they are still GREAT (everything else stays the same. 
-When I use dehydrated egg whites and hydrate according to directions with warm water and I omit the 1 T water listed in the ingredients
-I've learned that if I suddenly have to leave the house while these are in the middle of baking, or just plain out of time....I just turn off the oven and when I come back later in the day or next morning they are done!

I make these for Thanksgiving and Christmas for my fellow coworkers. They are a huge hit. The very first time I made them, I followed the recipe exactly. They were delicious! I then did like so many other reviewers and substituted the water for vanilla. OMG, YES! Regardless of any substitutions you can/will make to this, this recipe is delicious AS IS!

Sooo delicious.  Just like the kind at the fair but better!  I followed other people suggestions and used 1/2 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup brown.  Reduced the salt to half teaspoon.  Also added a dash of ground cloves.  I was short a few ounces of pecans(they are good plain too), they still weren't overly coated.  I only needed to do 3 15 minute intervals.  I'm not sure if that is because I was short some nuts. I will be making again in the future.

OMG these are really really good. The only thing I changed was swapping the water for vanilla extract and adding the 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Everything came out perfect. I would definitely make this again. This was so easy to make.

Phenomenal. I used a teaspoon of vanilla instead of the Tablespoon of water per suggested and cut the salt to 1/4 teaspoon. It's so dang delicious I know they aren't going to last long!  I'm going to use this same recipe for some cashews next.

I read all the reviews and wished mine turned out as good as all yours sound and look. They are okay, but not as good as what I expected. They don’t look coated, just cinnamony. My froth seemed to melt off when I was mixing them in the powder mixture, is that normal?

I made this and love it!  I also made some changes based on another cooks suggestions. We like things a littler sweeter so I did a full cup of sugar, BUT I did a half cup white sugar and half cup of brown sugar.  I also did the suggestion of vanilla instead of water.  I used the full amount of cinnamon and salt.  I used parchment paper on the cookie sheet.   This is an easy and yummy recipe.

I made this following some of the alterations.  I substituted vanilla for water and reduced the salt to 1/4tsp.  Wish I hadn’t altered salt; came out needed more salt.  Super yummy and going to try again with original salt measurement.

I just made this recipe and Oh My.....very easy and very good.  I did cut the salt measurement in half .  I usually like to make as is, but made the change due to dietary requirements.  It sure didn't do anything drastic to this recipe.  I'm going to make this again before the holidays are over.  Thank you for the recipe..

I made only half this recipe and I was so pleased with the results I immediately made the other half.  For the half recipe I used one half cup white sugar with one half teaspoon cinnamon and one half teaspoon salt.  I used one egg white to which I added one and a half teaspoon water and one and a half teaspoon vanilla.  I then frothed the mixture and measured out half of it to which I added 2 cups pecan halves and mixed well (I reserved the rest of the egg mixture for the second half batch.) I then put the sugar/salt/cinnamon mixture in a large Ziploc bag to which I added the pecans and mixed thoroughly to make sure all the pecans were completely covered with the sugar mixture.  I baked them as directly in the recipe.  They turned out wonderful.  I will definitely make these over and over again.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

OMG these were awesome.  I did read a lot of the comments before making the recipe and adjusted a bit as follows.  1/2 C white sugar & 1/2 C brown sugar; I used kosher salt instead of regular; added 1/2 t ground cloves; 1 t vanilla instead of the water with the egg white.  I mixed all the dry ingredients in a large ziplock bag and added the egg covered nuts to the bag and mixed everything up.  Also lined the pan with aluminum for easy clean up.  My nuts were done in 45 min.  I will definitely make this again and may try with mixed nuts, as one person suggested.   Watch out neighbors, y'all are getting yummy nuts for Christmas!

I make these every single year at Christmas time not only for my family but for gifts as well and all of my friends beg me to either make them more or beg for the recipe. I do have one reccomendation though. I love adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the egg white/water mixture. It makes all the difference.

Like many of the reviews I decreased the sugar to 1/3 c and replaced the water with vanilla.   I absolutely recommend the vanilla part. It’s amazing.   I used less salt too so I didn’t really get the salty part which I was okay with.  I’d make it again for sure but might use 1/2c sugar instead

I've made this several times around the holidays. Perfect as is but I switch it up sometimes. I used only 1/3 cup superfine sugar and used 1 tsp maple flavoring along with water to make the 1T as I did not have vanilla.  Baked on parchment paper. Yummo!!

Delicious and very easy! I did reduce the salt to just 1/2 tsp, and I used pumpkin pie spice mix for a little zing. I also took the suggestion of another reviewer to use a plastic bag to toss the sugar mix with the nuts, which made even coating easy. Will make again!

Everyone loves these and I get lots of requests for the recipe. Like many others I use 2 egg whites and add a tsp of vanilla to the egg mix. I also use gallon ziplock bags for both the wet and dry mixes. Finally I cover my baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup and no sticking. I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could. Thank you for sharing!

who doesn't love these roasted pecans? I subbed 1/2 cup packed brown sugar and reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup. Tossed in 1/4 teaspoon of pumpkin spice for added dimension in the flavor.  I'm going to chop these up and toss into a quinoa and forbidden rice mixture.  I'll have a touch of feta cheese crumbles on hand for those that want to add cheese to it.

I did cut the amount of sugar I used to 1/2 cup.  Also used one half water and one half vanilla to equal one Tbsp. Very good with a cheese tray.

Delicious. Next time though, I'll definitely cut the sugar in half or so. This went into a salad with spinach, strawberries, bleu cheese, and poppy seed dressing. It was perfect!

I've made these every holiday season for years. My recipe is almost identical except for the addition of a half-teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Try it. You will never go back. Thank you!

We enjoyed this very much! My only suggestion is to not make as much glaze because it clumped them together and made some too sweet.

So amazingly delicious!!!! I'm vegan, so I ditched the egg. Since the egg in this recipe only serves to get the sugar 'n' spice mixture to stick to the pecans, I thought flax would be the perfect answer since it has a mild nutty flavor on its own. So I swapped in 2 teaspoons ground flax seed with 2.5 tablespoons of water I had let sit for about 5 minutes. That gave it the same consistency as egg white+water (standard flax egg replacer is 1 tablespoon flax to 2.5 tablespoons of water but I wanted it a tiny bit more watery so I reduced the flax). That worked GORGEOUSLY! So happy with the results.

It is SO easy and SO delicious I've made it a few times!  I garnish my pumpkin pies with whipped cream with these candied pecans.  My husband hides them on me so he can have them all to himself...

Stopped short of saying I loved it, but it is now the base for my candied pecans I make. I modified the recipe just a bit - decreased the sugar by a smidgen, omitted the cinnamon, and added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. I also cooked about 5 min longer (this of course will vary with your oven).

I’ve made this twice—once following the receipt exactly and once with my own tweaks. The original recipe is good but I wanted something less sweet with more of a kick, so on the second round I used vanilla instead of water, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/3 c white sugar, 1/3 c brown sugar, and 1/4 tsp ground chipotle chili pepper.

EASY AND EXCELLENT.  Used exact measurements as listed.  I used the whisk from start to finish for mixing.  Didn't stir them every 15 minutes while baking like it says -- too lazy.  They came out well browned on all sides anyway.  Didn't think 1 tsp. salt was too much -- depends on individual taste I guess.  Only baked them 45 minutes but they came out brown and perfect.

I actually made an account to leave this comment. Things have been tight and I haven't been able to make cookies like I usually have on hand, I only had a few items to make something with, and had been given some pecans, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I did replace the water with vanilla extract, as I had seen a couple comments about. Specifically, I use the Molina brand found in the Hispanic section at Walmart that does not taste like alcohol, like others I have bought. I was very happy with how easy this recipe is, it is the perfect amount of sweet to curb a sweet tooth, I will definitely be making this more in the future, but am very happy with the results thus far.

Love this recipe!  Have made this five times already since I found it.  It's just perfect as it is, but I like to take 1 TBSP of sugar away and replace it with 1 TBSP of Coconut Sugar.  It adds a little sumpm sumpm.

This is a great basic recipe! I did reduce sugar and salt by about half as others recommended. This makes for a more savory pecan (I prefer sweeter). But that’s what’s great about the recipe - adjust to your taste! Have already made more than one batch and friends are asking for the recipe! It’s a keeper!

We are on a Ketogenic diet and this created a wonderful and satisfying snack.  They are so delicious! I know they would be just as great the regular way; I just simply substituted Swerve for the sugar.  I followed the recipe and only made this sugar-free alteration.  Side note: super easy!!

Very easy and delicious.  I was specifically making this to add to a salad, so I didn’t use quite as much cinnamon as the recipe called for.  I try to keep some of these candied pecans  on hand in the freezer and that works great.

Very popular treat. I sub out the cinnamon for apple pie spice. This is a great base recipe.  You can choose walnuts, pecans, cashews, etc and use cinnamon,  apple pie spice, allspice, etc.

Being the hasty teenager I am, I offered to make these when my mom needed them in 20 minutes. I began making the recipe and got to the end before realizing that they needed to bake for an hour. Instead, I cooked them on the stove in a couple tablespoons of butter on high heat. They were ready in about 5 minutes and were delicious despite the fact that I accidentally burned them. I will have to compare them to the real recipe some day, but I must say that this works pretty well.

This recipe is awesome. I was looking to buy candied pecans and couldn't find them locally. I found them online for $27!  It's so simple, and the only thing I didn't already have on hand were the pecans. They taste as good as anything you could buy. I did end up cooking mine longer than the recipe says, but I'm not sure if it was necessary or not.. the pecans are soft until they cool.

These are delicious! Made them to go in a green salad with beets and goat cheese and they were perfect. Terrific by themselves as a snack too! Thanks!

You will NOT need a teaspoon of salt for this recipe. For 1 pound of pecans, MAYBE an 1/4th teaspoon of salt. If you put a full teaspoon, you will ruin them.

I took a little bit from a few of the other reviews and the results are heavenly.  Instead of all water, I used one teaspoon each of water, vanilla and bourbon.  I also added a couple of dashes of ground cloves to the sugar mix.  I mixed the pecans and the egg mixture in a bowl, then put the nuts with the sugar mixture into a ziplock to coat.   Otherwise all the same as instructed in the recipe and these are the most fantastic candied pecans EVER!!

Always turns out great! This year I doubled the batch and there were no issues. I do like to add just a lil nutmeg (1/4 tsp)  to give it a bit more holiday flavour and I always mix in some walnuts. They are a bit cheaper than pecans and you can hardly tell the difference when they’re all done!

I made these for a Christmas treat and they were delicious. I used vanilla extract instead of water and 1/4 teaspoon of salt instead of 1 teaspoon. I also used 2/3 cup of sugar - 1/3 brown and 1/3 white like someone else suggested. I would definitely make these again!!!!

Addictive. I made the recipe as is, no changes. I do find it easier to put the sugar mix in a freezer bag and shake the pecans around in there. Less mess, saves time, and it really gets them mixed and coated.

Super easy to make and extremely yummy. Made these for office Xmas gifts (along with candied almonds) and they were a hit. Found I couldn’t bake any longer than the 60 minutes though as they start to burn fast. Excellent recipe. Will be an Xmas tradition now.

These were definitely the easiest Christmas gifts I have made. I added almonds, walnuts, peanuts to the pecans. They were so good and had to bag them right away so my family did not eat them all!

I read some reviews before making this; I didn't put the salt in, and I used vanilla instead of water.  Delicious!!!!  My husband was worried there wouldn't be any for him as I was making these and putting them in canning jars, but I overbought the amount of pecans, so he is one happy guy!  He took some to work, and his coworkers want the recipe.  Will definitely make again!

I love candied nuts. This is a great base recipe for candied nuts. Like other reviewers, I replace the water with vanilla. I like a lot of cinnamon, so I use a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon.

These are delicious! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used vanilla instead of water.  Also, I only roasted for 45 minutes instead of the full hour. This would probably only matter according to your personal taste.  It is so easy and good!

Great recipe if you follow it exactly. You will be thinking you have too much sugar but just go with it. After baking you will have a nice amount of crumbs that's fall off of the pecans which are great for seasoning another dessert or bowl of ice cream.

Also very easy to modify, none of the ingredients are too scary to get into, ive added vanilla, maple syrup, more salt but to be honest my favorite so far is to do exactly what the recipe calls for. 

These are SO Good when you are able to eat them still hot from the oven but will last for weeks in a sealed container and are enjoyable well after baking is complete. 

Enjoy!

I wish I could give this a 10! My co-workers and family would agree! So easy, quick and addicting! You can switch things up to fit your taste, as I did w/adding vanilla instead of water.  The end results are heavenly. Thanks so much Alix for sharing this recipe. Now off to make copies for co-workers :)

This was a great recipe and everyone seemed to love it (I hate nuts so no tasting for me). We picked 106 lbs of pecans and turned them into gifts for the holidays. I made over 14 trays of pecans today. The one piece of advice I would give is to use Egg beaters or something similar instead of egg if doing large quantities such as we did. I also used sea salt and it gave it that extra edge to the taste.

No need to change anything. These are delicious.  I've made them for years. I always give as gifts and they always ask for more. These are better than anything you can buy in a store. Store in cookie tins to keep best crunch and  flavor.

Excellent recipe as written. I've made it several times. But I have since modified it to our own tastes. I substitute half the white sugar with brown sugar. It gives it a more subtle and earthy sweetness. I also substitute water with some vanilla. As one other reviewer commented, why not substitute water for flavor. I think I'm going to try some Jamaican butter rum flavoring. I bet that will be awesome. Thanks for this great recipe.

This was my first batch and they are delicious, I am so excited! I added a little vanilla to the wet ingredients just like I had read in one of the reviews because it sounded like a good idea, and I"m really glad I did. I've always wanted to know how to candy nuts.

Delicious as is, and I love them every time I make them.  This time, I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  I used applewood smoked salt and added 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper.

I made this recipe exactly like it was written.  To be honest I wasn't that impressed with it.  The flavor is very  mild (I was hoping it was going to be something like the carnival pecans) I won't count it out just yet.  I  will make it again but tweak it a bit.  If that works I will be back on with another review and what tweaks I did to it.  I would just like a bit more taste.

I love this recipe.  Very easy. I thought there was a lot more to these.  I did a mistake first time and mixed everything together.  Anyway follow the recipe and all will be good.  I did add a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper other wise just the same.  It makes a big batch, love in salads and will freeze some in a couple of batches.

I make this over and over always with success.  I do double the amount of egg whites and make sure they are very frothy.  I also sprinkle with freshly ground sea salt each time I stir the nuts while baking.  This is sooooo good it always makes a great gift as well.

I used maple extract in place of water but only one tsp. I used half brown and half white sugar. I used sea salt instead of table salt. I made them and then baked them on top of my maple pecan shortbread but they were crispy and delish on their own!  So yummy!

I had to cut the recipe in half however, I still used a whole egg white and I did add a teaspoon of vanilla and it did not take away from the flavor of the pecans. It was wonderful! My husband can't stop eating them and bragging about how good they are.  Will try this recipe with walnuts.

So  easy and so good? Great as a snack, and also I used them to top a spinach strawberry salad. 
Like other reviewers, I believe you can halve the sugar amount and still get great results. Used vanilla as my liquid.
Would definitely make again.

I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and the salt to 1/4 tsp. Also added 1 tsp. vanilla. I had requests for the recipe and to make them again soon. The second time I made them I used half white sugar and half brown sugar,  and replaced all the water with vanilla. They were great.

This is an excellent recipe as is.  My daughter made it with a few changes with delicious results.  She used brown sugar and white sugar (1/2 cup each); and she substituted bourbon and  vanilla extract for all of the water.   I followed her lead, and made the following changes:  
1.  Use  only 1/2 cup sugar;   
2.  Use only 1/2 teaspoon of salt;  
3.  Instead of 1 tablespoon water, use 2 teaspoons of Vanilla Extract, plus 2 teaspoons of Bulleit Bourbon. 
4.  Line the baking sheet with parchment paper.  
Use 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 egg white, as recipe states.
The package of pecan halves I used was 12 ounces (recipe calls for 16 ounces), but I did not adjust the measurements of the ingredients, nor did I try to strain off the excess as some reviewers did.  I cut back on the sugar and salt because I personally don't care for too much of those.  Using the full amounts will give delicious results, so that's strictly a personal preference decision.  However, my daughter and I do highly recommend swapping out the water for bourbon and vanilla extract!  
If your results are too dry or too browned, the likely problem is that your oven runs too hot.  I roasted the pecans for a full hour at 250 degrees F, as stated, and they were perfect.  My daughter turned her oven down to 225 degrees F after the first 15 minutes because she thought the pecans were roasting too fast.  
Thank you Alix for the original recipe!

I made a double batch and used 1 cup of sugar because about 10 people said to and it taste like normal baked pecaunes . I recommend using the full recipe for it. But besides that it is very good.

Honestly I listened to some of the reviews that said cut the sugar and I wish I hadn't. If you like your pecans to be rich and decadent stick with the original. I'll be retrying the original recipe, great with less sugar and I imagine wonderful with more!

We were looking for something like the nuts we get at Cabelas, and these are even better! Unlike the store-made, none of these wound up rock hard and impossible to chew. I can't recommend it highly enough.

This is great as is, but I like mine smoky and spicy as well. So, I use the recipe, remove the cinnamon, and add a teaspoon of cayenne powder and a teaspoon of paprika. I sometimes also add a cup or two of broken pretzel pieces. When I add pretzel pieces, I add another egg white so I can coat all the pecans and pretzel pieces. Delicious!

I followed the original recipe, though had to use walnuts as I was out of pecans. I used a zip lock bag for coating the nuts and baked them on parchment paper as someone else had recommended. They turned out beautifully though I didn't care for the hint of salt (disclaimer: I don't care for salted caramel or chocolate either). I'll use far less salt and add some vanilla to the water for extra flavor next time.

These have become a must for our family Christmas get together!  And I follow this recipe exactly!  I did see on one of the reviews that they used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar...I think I’ll try that next time!

I make these every year for the last 23 years from a different recipe book but I also add a bit of nutmeg. I made 4 batches this year which gave me about 30 cups of pecans.

Like many others, I cut the salt in half. As well as the sugar, used 1/3c.  brown sugar and 1/3c.  granulated. I also cut the water to 1/2T and 1/2T vanilla. Wonderful!

Like others, I reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp., only because I don't love the salty/sweet combo, and I also reduced the sugar to 2/3 C, using half white and half brown sugar. They are delicious!

My mom made these for Christmas for many, many years. Her recipe is slightly different. More like some of the reviews here.  Instead of 1 tsp of cinnamon, she used 1 tbsp.
Instead of 1 tsp of salt, she used 1/2 tsp salt.
Instead of baking at 250 for an hour, she baked at 300 for 33 minutes, stirring twice. (I usually cook them for 30 minutes.)

I have made this recipe many times and it can stand on its own as is.  However recently I've added more salt and changed the white sugar to brown sugar and also added cayenne pepper (I really love the little punch from the pepper).

This is a quick, easy and delicious treat which I'll be making again soon.

I took suggestions from others and lowered the sugar to 2/3 c. ( 1/3 brown sugar and 1/3 white sugar). Also, I tried a microwave version where I cooked in microwave 6  min. Stirring every 2 min. Spread out to dry and they were every bit as good as the ones in the oven.

These are wonderful and easy to make.  Especially delicious warm.  The only change I made was taking the advice of some other reviewers and substituted vanilla for the water.  Will definitely make again.

These are sweet and crunchy, should have read reviews before I made it, as 1cup of sugar is too much, I think 1/2 -3/4 Cup would be plenty- used it as a garnish to pumpkin pie by sprinkling them on the cool whip on top!

We made this recipe several times, it is perfect!  I have tried other recipes and nothing compares.  We made a ton of this for Christmas and everyone wants me to make more this year!  Texture is amazing, flavor is exceptional.  I did reduce the salt, but other than that, followed recipe exactly.

I made a few changes based on what I had on hand and my craving for chocolate. I used Sucanet instead of white sugar, left out the cinnamon and salt and added in 1.5 TB of raw cacao. Mine were done when I went to stir them at 45 minutes, but that may be because I only had pecan pieces on hand and not halves. This is a GREAT base recipe, taken to the next level with the addition of chocolate!

A 1 good!
I only had half pound of pecans so that’s what I used. I didn’t change the recipe to accommodate or “make up” for it only being half a pound. They turned out great, and the half pound was plenty for me and to share.

I simply cannot stop eating these. I originally made them to put on my salads (greens with tomatoes, dried apples, blue cheese, apple  dressing and pecans, or greens with strawberries, blueberries, blue cheese, Apple dressing, pecans), but I cannot stop eating them right out of the container. I reduced the salt and used vanilla because I could. I've made almonds in the crock pot with a similar recipe but they didn't develop the same crunch. This will be my go-to recipe for pecans, almonds, walnuts, you name it. Thanks!

I set the oven to 250 C instead of 250 F - oops - and yet they were ready in 10 minutes. Perfectly, deliciously ready. No need to do the slow 1 hr of checking and stirring, just set the temp higher and enjoy it sooner! Yum.
Changes: halved the sugar and cinnamon, used only a few shakes of salt.  Still so good!

BOMB!  I always wanted to make this.  I followed people's suggestions and only did 1/3 cup of sugar and it was enough.   I did not have enough cinnamon but wish I did as it needed a little more.  As I did not have 1 lb of pecan on hand I did half walnuts and half pecans and I am glad I did!  Next time, I think I am going to use brown sugar and some maple syrup to get a little more of that candied appeal.  This has turned into a new favourite and

These were fantastic!  I read through some of the reviews first and took the advice to lower the sugar (I used 1/3 c. White sugar and 1/3 c. Brown sugar) and reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp. I found my pecans were done after 45 minutes, but they are fantastic! I cannot stop eating them!! I didn't have any bourbon, but loved the suggestion of adding it instead of water-will definitely try that next time!

after reading the reviews, i decided to only use 2/3c of sugar and substituted the water with vanilla extract...they were very good, but really still way too sugary for my liking...next time, i will try ½ c of sugar as a few other reviewers suggested...i will be making these for a treat to put in the hotel goodie bags for my son's wedding...

I finally made these pecans and they were excellent.
As recommended by others I made some changes.
I reduced the sugar to 1/2 C. , the salt to 1/2 tsp. and added about a tsp. of vanilla. I have praline pecans from trader joes which are good but they are a lot sweeter. These ones let the taste of the pecan come through without being over powered by the sugar.

Made it twice. Really like it. It's not too sweet but just wondering if it'd be just as good with half the sugar/cinnamon mixture. Will try halving it next time. A bunch is left on the baking sheet anyways, so maybe there'll be less wastage if the mixture is halved.

I made this a couple of times now. The first time I made it as written. It was really good but was really sweet for my taste. The other time I made it, I decreased the sugar to about 3/4 cup of sugar and as advised by the other reviews, added vanilla. I didn't completely omit the water. I put water 3/4 of the way of the tablespoon and added enough vanilla to fill it. It was just the right amount of taste to me.

Great recipe! My variation is to use 2/3 cup white and 1/3 cup brown sugar. Also use half tsp. apple pie spice and half tsp. cinnamon. Makes for a good holiday flavour!

My husband likes his pecans to have a light coating so I doubled the egg whites and pecans but left the sugar the same. They are delicious! They make great little gifts too!

Made as written, then read a few reviews (kind of backwards, I know) and decided to drizzle a little vanilla through the mixture.  Came out delicious!  I might cut back on the sugar mixture by 1/4 next time.  Wonderful recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I love candied pecans especially on a cold night in autumn or winter. I did make a few changes I used 1/2 of a 24 oz bag (1lb 8oz) instead of using water I added about 1/3 of a cup of honey. 
I used about 3 tbs of ground cinnamon, 1/3 of a cup of white sugar, 1.3 of a cup of light brown sugar, and 1 egg white, I mixed the dry ingredients  first in a small bowl then added the honey and lastly the egg white. I mixed thoroughly then tossed the pecans in folding them in the mixture with a cake spatula. I spread them out on a cookie sheet one even layer and baked at 350 for 30 min at fifteen minutes I tossed them to check for even browning and added a pinch of sea salt on each side. I hope this works well for you it was perfect for us!

I made these in a quadruple batch to divide up and give as teacher gifts for Christmas. They turned out great and I received many compliments. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar because I had seen another similar recipe use brown sugar. And, I added a half teaspoon of vanilla to the egg whites/water. Instead of tossing pecans in the eggs first, I just mixed the sugars and cinnamon into the eggs first and then poured in the pecans and mixed. So yummy!!

Mine did not turn out as shiny as the photo shows. Less a glaze and most of a seasoning look. Not sure if I did something wrong but they still taste very good.

This is an excellent, easy recipe to share with others as a gift or during parties. Instead of water in the egg wash, I used vanilla extract. Otherwise I made it as is!

Never made candied nuts before.  It was so easy and they are the most delicious things ever.  I needed for a recipe and could not find them at the store.  I think they saved me a lot of money.

I have made these twice now. The first time I followed the recipe 100% and they turned out GREAT! Super crunchy and sweet, but also that hint of saltiness I enjoyed. The whole batch was gone in less than 24 hours! The second time I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp vanilla. Again, they were delicious! I think this is a no-fail recipe and can be adjusted to your own individual preferences.

As is my habit, I tweaked the recipe a bit by adding a bit of butter and vanilla, and stirred ever 20 minutes, which was fine.    My trial went well, and these will make great holiday gifts!

I only had an 8 Oz bag of pecans..nuts are expensive..so I had to make a few changes. I used 1/3c white sugar, 1/3c packed brown sugar, substituted water for vanilla, cut cinnamon down to 1/4 of what it called for (cinnamon makes things taste too dry) and lined the baking sheet with parchment paper (made stirring during baking and clean up simple!).  This was an easy and delicious recipe that I'll definitely be making again!

My family loves to get these as part of their gifts over Christmas time. this will be my 3rd year making them, last year I did over 2 pounds and still didn't have enough.
