I took these to work and ended up giving the recipe to 10 people.  I used a cake mix with chocolate chips. I loved the ease of the recipe with only 4 ingredients.  I did find that spraying my hands with cooking spray helped to be able to dole them onto the pan.  Loved them.

These should be called 5 minute cookies! I have never made cookies so fast in my life. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer ... put everything in the bowl and turned it on thatâ€™s it! I used fat free plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and I used sugar free chocolate pudding instead of the regular and they turned out fantastic! Mine were done in about 8 minutes! WOW Great find!!

These cookies are good, but a little tricky to make. Yes, the batter is very stiff so its hard to break up all of the cake mix pieces. I would reccomend really whisking the dry mix before adding any wet ingredients. They're also REALLY sticky so its a pain to get them onto cookie sheets. Once you bake them, its near impossible to tell if theyre done because they look fine on the top but burn quickly on the bottom if you wait too long. Stick with the ~9 minute mark. Otherwise, theyre great!!!

Very rich and moist cookie.  I think that the only thing I'll do different next time is add some chocolate chips....you can never have too much chocolate!!

I used a spice cake mix and the limited edition Pumpkin Spice pudding by Jell-O (although I'm sure vanilla would work too if you add a little bit of pumpkin pie spice)then frosted them with cream cheese frosting. I got lots of requests for the recipe.

OUTRAGEOUSLY GOOD!  Used a chocolate pudding mix with a white cake and then frosted them in the middle of two - tastes just like a fudge round but 100 times better!

I made these yesterday & today there is only 8 of them left! (Actually, I shared some with friends). They are simple to make but the batter is VERY stiff. Overall, the taste is good & they are very moist. Mine took longer to bake than the recipe stated,though, approximately 12-14 mins.

Not one of my favorites.. would rather have made it into a cake.. Cookies stick together even after they have cooled.. But I do have to say they are moist..  Cooking time was not even close.. I baked for 12-15 minutes and they probably could have baked a little bit longer but did not want to burn bottoms.. Wil

I love the simplicity of this recipe. I omitted the frosting since im not a big frosting fan, but i did add a bunch of chocolate chips. The cookies are so yummy! I think I might add some crushed walnuts next time too. Thanks for sharing!

I made two versions to take to a cookie swap.  The chocolate version and the spice cake version using vanilla pudding since I couldn't find the pumpkin pudding.  I got second place with the spice cake version.  Now I'm going to try the chocolate version again with german chocolate frosting.

Not a bad little cookie... I wanted to make cookies and had no butter. I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I used a yellow cake mix, a 1 oz. package of sugar-free/fat-free white chocolate pudding, 6 oz. 0-fat plain Greek yogurt and 1/4 cup of light sour cream plus the 2 eggs and chocolate chips. hey turned out pretty good and were very cake-like and moist. Hubby loves them!!!

These were really good! The batter may be more tasty than the cookies. :)  After reading the reviews, I made sure to whisk the dry ingredients to break up the chunks. I used 3/4 c vanilla yogurt and 1/4 c low fat sour cream to cut some calories.  Also, I used spoons to form the dough and plop it on the cookie sheet. Otherwise, that dough would've never come off my fingers.  Next time, I'll definitely add chocolate chips (maybe white chocolate?) to add a different consistency to the cookie.

These cookies were alright. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, but I don't think that made much of a difference. Not bad, but just a bland chocolate flavor. Might be better with some white choc chips or marshmallows thrown in

Just finished making these and I will make them again. The recipe should state the dough is VERY stiff - anyone with weak hands or wrists would have problems mixing by hand. They have a chewy texture and flavor is good. Not a strong chocolate taste, so if that's what you are looking for, you will definitely want to frost them or even add chocolate chips. And, this is one of the few recipes that actually made the quantity stated - 48 cookies!

So I read the reviews and cooked my first dozen at 350 degrees for 8 1/2 minutes.  The bottoms of the cookies were close to burning and the tops were just browning, so I turned the oven to 325 degrees and cooked them for 14 minutes.  PERFECTION!  The tops and bottoms are equally done and they don't stick together in the cookie jar.  In case you were wondering how I knew they were browning,  I used white cake mix with banana cream pudding, then filled the center with Cool Whip vanilla frosting.  YUM!  My family loves this recipe, definitely a keeper!

I used spice cake mix with butterscotch pudding mix and added 1/2 cup pecan chips. Then I used cream cheese frosting for the filling. They were amazing! The key is to make the cookies with no more than a teaspoon of batter. Any more, and you end up with burnt bottoms or gooey centers. I learned the hard way. :)

Don't use sugar-free fat-free pudding mix in these, I think it was responsible for them not turning out so well, and I don't like the frosting, but they'd be good with some other kind of topping, like melted chocolate chips, white or semi-sweet.

The cookies were AWESOME!  What a great, fast treat!  I used my mixer which made the mixing even easier - not that it was hard.  The only thing I had to do was cook them much longer than what it called for.  At 10 minutes my cookies were not near done on the inside so I bumped it to 12 minutes and they turned out great!

Great cookies!  Very moist!  I didn't frost them, though.  I knew I'd like them better without.  I used an ice cream scoop with a lever to scoop out the batter onto the cookie sheet and it worked great!

So incredibly easy, and such moist and delicious results. I used yellow mix and banana pudding, and added half a bag of mini morsels. Delicious! 

Next time I might try a spice cake mix with vanilla pudding and white chocolate chips for a special fall treat.

I did not have the sour cream, so used mayonaise, and no instant pudding so used the cook & serve kind and then added 1C of milk to recipe.  These turned out good!  They were very chocolately and moist, really good.  I frosted with vanilla frosting too.
