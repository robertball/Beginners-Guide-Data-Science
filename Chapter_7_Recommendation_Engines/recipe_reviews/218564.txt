If you use the packet of HVR dressing mix and make it with Hellman's Light Mayo it tastes just like it wasn't light salad dressing.

This is a quick and easy, kid friendly pasta salad.  I didn't have either Romanesco or broccoli but I added red onion and finely diced celery & some halved cherry tomatoes.  The grandkids love all things "Ranch" - this will be a hit with them.

I have been making this recipe for years and it is always a great go-to for pot lucks.   I use a spicy italian dressing and you don't have to worry about spoilage.  Also use any combination of raw veggies in this, broccoli is good or zucchini or yellow squash in slices.  Personally I would never spend the time cutting anything into stars or crescents, but if that's your gig go for it.  The flavors combine nicely.

This got mixed reviews at a cookout yesterday. Some thought it was too much ranch and others loved it. I thought it could have used a little less dressing and maybe something to give it a little kick. Also went to 3 stores and could not find Alien Broccoli or Whole Wheat Wagon Wheel Pasta - went with regular broccoli & tri coloe shapes with wagon wheels. We will try it again with some twists.

Very good! I didn't have a yellow bell pepper and only had roasted red bell peppers in a jar, but it worked out well. I couldn't find Romanesco broccoli, but regular broccoli florets were a fine substitute. Simple flavors, but very tasty. The Light Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing is sooo good... works great in this salad. Thanks :)

This would be good to take to a potluck or something like that. I found it to be just ok. Cutting stars and moons from bell peppers is for the birds, so I just cut mine into thin strips. I could not find Romanseco anywhere so I used regular broccoli. I think it may need some thinly sliced red onions and cucumbers...I don't know, but it was lacking something. My dinner guest commented that this was like one of the salads that you purchase at the deli counter of the grocery store and pay big bucks for, and I think he may be right, so I will probably make this again for a crowd, but if it's just my husband and myself, I'll find another salad that's more suited to our tastes. Thanks for submitting this.

Tonight I made this recipe as a side dish to go with Polska Kielbasa and I was not disappointed.  I used a cookie cutter to make the shapes but it really would taste just as good chopped and save time as well.  If you're a person who eats with their eyes, go for the shapes.   I could not get whole wheat wagon wheel pasta, so I just used the whole wheat spiral pasta and it is something I will use again.  The only change I would make is to sprinkle with parmesan cheese prior to serving.  This was yummy!  Thank you Hidden Vallley Ranch for your recipe I couldn't tell the dressing was "light".

Ahh, this one was not a keeper in our house. Ranch and cold pasta is not for us- I even added some lettuce to break it up but it didn't work. 
What I will keep using is the LIGHT dressing- That was truly amazing.  EXCELLENT TASTE for 80 calories a TBS!
ONE FOR THE RECIPE- FIVE FOR THE DRESSING....OVERALL 3. :)

This is one of those perfect for unexpected guests or for a crowd or a pot luck dishes - made quickly and served with crusty French bread and butter. Can also be made using balsamic vinegar dressing (Paul Newman's if store bought) and Feta cheese. It's a standard around our house.

Good pasta salad. It's easy to make, has good flavor, and looks pretty with all the colors. I used regular broccoli, which was fine.

Wasn't a fan of this recipe. It was bland and hubby and I felt it needed a lot more seasonings. I ended up adding 1/4 c of parmesan cheese and some garlic seasoning. That helped quite a bit, but it still wasn't enough to make this a keeper. I didn't cut the peppers into shapes, and looking back, I'm actually glad I didn't waste time doing so. I doubt I'd make this again. It was very easy to make though!

Love Hidden Valley products but did not particularly care for this pasta salad. Taste was mediocre at best. On the other hand, it might encourage children to eat their veggies because of the cute shapes of the veggies and mild taste of the dressing.

I don't think this was very interesting and somewhat bland. Noodles with ranch is how my sister described it.

I too could not find the "alien" vegetable. This was easy to make but it is lacking something for sure. Not one of my favorites. It needs something.. not sure what, maybe onions, cherry tomatoes, cheese cubes? I don't know, I used the bottled dressing light. Maybe making the packet would have given it more zip? 2.5 star at best

I think this would be a very popular dish at a potluck barbecue.  To make it even more colorful, I used tri-color rotini in addition to the wheel pasta.  Romanesco broccoli was not available at my local store so I used regular broccoli.

First, I have to admit that ranch dressing is not one of our favorite dressings, and at a restaurant, it would be my last choice on the salad bar.  That being said, IMO this pasta salad has very little flavor outside of the ranch dressing.  Every other ingredient in this salad does not have much flavor on its own.  After taking the photo, I added some of my homemade pickled jalapeno peppers, and that REALLY did improve the flavor (at least for us).

We thought this recipe was just so-so. I skipped the wagon wheel pasta and skipped cutting the peppers into shapes (an unnecessary tedius task if you don't have kids). I couldn't find the Romanesco broccoli, so just used regular. I have loved Hidden Valley Ranch for years, but I think we prefer Italian dressing on our pasta salads.

This was very good! I made it as written except I used regular broccoli...I couldn't find the alien kind! And I used all wagon wheel, no spiral. I may add some green onion next time...just for more flavor! I did use the black olives, as suggested, and it went very well with this salad!

Like the other reviewers, I could not find the Romanesco broccoli, so I used regular crowns. I also couldn't find wheat wagon wheels, so I used all fusili. My store didn't have regular wagon wheels either. I like the pasta and the veggies together. I feel like the ranch is a little underwhelming. I'd boost it with some salt or dry ranch dressing/powder to up that lovely ranch flavor. Since I am serving adults I did not use the fun veggie shapes, but I think that is awesome for a kids' party.

This was just a swing and a miss for us, on many levels.  It is very bland.  I will be adding some other ingredients to help us "get rid of this" throughout the week.  I discovered my green bell was rotten when I cut into it, so I have to leave it out.  Other than that, I followed the recipe w/the exception of using broccoli crowns because my produce department didn't carry the "alien" variety.  Even though I'm lazy, I considered cutting the peppers into the shapes until I realized what a PITA that would make EATING the salad and went w/a dice instead.  I needed to use most of the bottle of the HVR Light dressing to coat.  At first taste, I knew it was going to need a lot of doctoring, so I added some shredded purple cabbage that needed using; that added a nice crunch and bitterish taste to cut the sweetness (onion should be a no brainer in a salad like this).  This definately needs some acid and I will be adding a jar of diced banana peppers to our next serving (sadly, this makes a TON).    This will not be a repeat in the LTH house.

This is an especially easy kid-friendly meal--especially if you add some type of protein like chicken.  For adults I think it needs a little more flavor, like adding some of the dry Hidden Valley Ranch mix to it.  I did add some parmesan cheese.  Thank you for the idea of this dish!

This was just okay in my book.  I modified the veggies to fit our tastes (and what was on sale at the store) so I left out the black olives (olives belong in martinis, in my book.)  I couldn't find the alien broccoli, so I used regular broccoli like most of the other reviewers.  I think the sauce needs some kick - if I try this again I might take other reviewers' advice and add some dry ranch seasoning to it.  Anyway, it was just okay, although my husband seemed to like it.

This is rather versatile.  I didn't find it necessary to cut the shapes and I only had red of the bell peppers.  I did add the black olives, and also green onion and halved cherry tomatoes.  I think all those peppers would have been way too much!  I used regular broccoli as I couldn't find Romanesco, and used veggie rice spirals in place of the wheat pasta.  I had to use a bit more dressing than called for b/c after the 2 hours in the fridge it was a little dry.  Also perked it up with freshly cracked pepper.  It's a good once-in-a-while change from classic pasta salad, or good when you don't have time to make a mayo-dressing of your own.  I would give it 3.5 if we could give fractions.  This might be good with crumbled bacon...hmm...

Very good, had to substitute the veggies for different reasons (can't have broccoli and only had red bell peppers) and used the pasta that I had in the pantry. I added tomatoes from the garden and it was super good. It is very good and the best thing is that you can vary the ingredients and it is still yummy!!

I wasn't very succesful at cutting out shapes so I got frustrated and basically diced everything. I used regular broccoli because I couldn't find romanesco. After tasting the salad, I decided to throw in some minced red onion because I really like the touch it adds to salads of any kind. I liked the crunch of the vegetables and the colorful presentation.

Good and easy. I used only Veggie spirals for the pasta. I could not find Romanesco broccoli so I used regular, only used green bell pepper, added red onions, cucumbers and broccoli slaw. Also skipped cutting out shapes in the veggies, I was short on time. I had to use a lot more dressing than what was called for but then I always overdo the veggies. I really enjoyed the Light dressing.

This is a good base for a pasta salad but it needs some help. It is a bit on the bland side. Cutting the veggies into shapes is a nice touch for special occasions but a simple dice is just fine for everyday. I chopped our carrot instead of diced as well. Alike others I could not find the alien broccoli so used regular florets. 

I have made a ranch pasta salad similar to this in the past when I needed something last minute, tomato, cheddar cheese, red onion, bacon, chicken along with a few seasonings to add to oomph it up  can turn this salad from eh to yum!

This isn't anything I would make again.  Like many other reviewers I couldn't find the romanesco broccoli aka roman cauliflower but I don't think the addition would have changed my thoughts.

A quick, easy weeknight meal.  I doubled the veggies and added a few extras I had in my refrigerator, including chopped zucchini and red onion.  I used light mayo and fat free milk to mix the packet and it was yummy.

Very easy and delish! I diced the veggies very small instead of making the fun shapes, and I wasn't able to find the "alien veggie", but regular broccoli works well in this salad.  Thanks Hidden Valley Ranch!  Just want to add that this salad is even better the next day!!  I will definitely make this up a day ahead next time!

This got mixed reviews at a party. The fun shapes were perfect for the kids, and they thought it was great. The grownups on the otherhand thought it was just pasta tossed with ranch dressing. I might try to make this again, maybe adding som efresh herbs like dill, mixing the ranch with something else to make it less ranchy...I'm not sure. The birthday boy really loves the stars and moons though!
