Trying to introduce a new variety of healthy foods to my junk food junkie family. Made it just like the recipe except used two pressed cloves of fresh garlic instead. Served them with some fantastic Tzatziki I made fresh and what a hit!  Can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. ;)

These really are OMG good. The cooked quinoa gets toasty during the second cooking process and crunches slightly and bursts with that nutty flavour. Everything comes quite well together here. I played around with this recipe and it is quite forgiving. I had to use buckwheat flakes instead of oatmeal and ended up having to use about 4 times the amount written. Evidently the two have different absorption qualities. I found that after letting the mixture set a while it firmed up to create a sturdy patty. I baked some "meatball" sized ones in the oven at 175°C for about 10-12 minutes. I flipped half of them halfway through. Any way you cook them, fried or baked, they come out perfectly; fried was just more flavourful. I served these with an assortment of homemade sauces like tartar, mustard and bbq and they went well with any sauce you dipped them in as well as being delicious on their own. Thank you MaryLou Hunter for your very nice recipe.

These really were yummy. I was just cooking for 2 so cut recipe in 1/2. I made guacamole to go with them. Also tried some with a little remoulade type sauce we had on hand. Seems to go with all kinds of flavors. May add a little red pepper too next time.

I love these!   I made the recipe as is except used ground up almonds instead of oat groats.  I fried them in coconut oil and they held together and got nice and crispy on the outside.  I am looking forward to playing around with this recipe.  I halved the recipe and got 16 patties.  Made this recipe again and added some leftover black beans and cumin, love it!  I did have to add extra ground up almonds so they would hold their shape.

I modified to fit what I had on hand. I excluded the zucchini, added a small baked sweet potato based on the ingredients for a similar recipe, used fresh garlic instead of powdered, used only two eggs, and used coconut flour instead of powdered oats. I refrigerated the patties before frying, but had a little trouble keeping them together, because I made them too big, so I switched to broiling close to the element two minutes on each side. Sweet, savory, and hearty! Thanks for the inspiration!

The patties were crispy and tasty and I'll definitely make them again. I modified the recipe slightly based on what I had on hand. I didn't have any zucchini so I used peeled & grated broccoli stalk instead. I put in two large cloves of garlic instead of the powder.

Pretty good. They didn’t stay together too well. Worked better by using more oil to fry them in.

only okay, pretty bland by themselves.  Never did find Groats, but used ground oats instead.  I did eat them all by putting them with other tastier foods and they added a nice crunchy consistency.    Underneath a fried egg, or underneath a dollop of cauliflower mash, anything that has a gravy works well too. I had made canadian pork chops with dijon sauce and they were perfect underneath those.

Made according to recipe. Added a few chopped fresh mushrooms and still very bland. Next time may add green onion, maybe Italian seasoning?   High protein non meat means I will try it again.  I used leftover cold patties broken up to add to lunch green salad.

Very happy with this  recipe. Before I finished mixing the ingredients,  I wondered if it were a bit weak in the spice category so, I added two large garlic cloves( minced) in the zucchini carrot sauté and then added about I teaspoon of dill weed.
I fried two patties for dinner and decided to bake ( 400 degrees ) the remaining patties on parchment paper for about 20 min. , turning after 10 minutes. Personally, I liked both , although my husband liked the fried better. 
I made a quick Sriracha mayo to serve as a sauce and it was a hit!
Will keep this recipe! Thanks.

Delicious and a new favorite in my family! Followed the recipe exactly with fantastic results. You could top this with just about anything and it will taste great but we especially enjoyed it with salsa and sliced avocado. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe I will be making it often!

I really enjoyed these. The texture and taste is just right for me. I just ate the patty topped with some avocado, no bun or anything.

Missing any discernable taste.
Needs chili powder or cumin or something... 
Not bad, not great either.
