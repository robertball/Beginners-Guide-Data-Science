WOW!!! With a little doctoring this soup is out of this world. By far the best soup I've ever eaten. I added 1 Tbsp of extra finely chopped garlic an extra cup of potato doubled the onion and pepper and added 1/4 cup thinly sliced carrot. It was delicious!!!

I would suggest making this a day ahead of time.  It tastes better after all the flavors have set in.  I added dill and skipped the cheese.  When I serve it, I sprinkle cheese and some bacon bits on top.  Great recipe that can be made many different ways!!!

What a terrific recipe! I was searching for one that did not use potato flakes or cream soups to thicken and this one was just right. I made very minor variations like adding a little parsley and extra salt for flavor and adding some grated carrots. I also used Yukon Gold instead of red potatoes and skipped the cheese since I made it to accompany a main course. Yum...even the children enjoyed it!

GOOD SOUP!!!!! SOUPERB! I followed the directions with some minor changes: I used turkey broth instead of chicken broth. When the potatoes were tender I used a potato masher and slighty mashed some of the potatoes the make the soup thicken and omitted the cornstarch. I added leftover turkey pieces and various herbs and spices like paprika basil garlic salt and pepper. I don't like cheese in my soup and I thought 2 cups of cheese was a little much anyways so instead I just sprinkled some cheese on the top when I dished the soup up in individual bowls. It was a great change from my usual "leftover turkey from thanksgiving soup" and a delicious way to use up leftover potatoes and turkey! Thanks for the recipe it's a keeper!

This was a real easy recipe. I mashed the potatoes up some once they were cooked and instead of using salt and pepper I used a hickory smoke/pork chop season mix for a little flavor. Very good!

This is my daughter's favorite meal of all time. My only modifications are to use colby-jack cheese instead of cheddar because that's what we usually have on hand and to add about three tbsp of crumbled bacon when I add the potatoes so the flavor cooks in. I do use Kitchen Basics gluten-free broth since we are gluten-intolerant and this way I can be sure it's safe. But this is hands-down the best recipe I have found for potato soup.

I am rating this recipe based solely on the content--I made it exactly as written. It is an excellent base recipe but a little bland without some additions. I did garnish with real bacon bits before serving. Next time I will add some more seasoning components: bacon in the soup green onion and maybe some garlic. A really good start to what could be a 5 star knockout recipe!

This was wonderful. I have family that can not have wheat or gluten and I can make this with butter and keep it gluten free. I added ham and carrots for a change. Very good!!!!

Great recipe. I added 1 1/2 cup steamed and pureed cauliflower halfway through simmering potatoes otherwise followed directions as given. The soup turned out great I will use this recipe again and know I will find new ways to add to it yet retain this very satisfying and flavorful soup.

Very good base soup. I added cabbage rosemary and smoke flavoring. Instead of adding cheese while cooking I garnished with it. Very good!

Really simple & solid recipe. I agree with others that you can cut down the cheese and doctor with garlic or other things. I believe any potato type would work. Thank you!

I came to this recipe w/ high hopes since I love a good potato soup & this one seemed low-fat & used healthier & more natural chicken broth for flavoring. I must have done something wrong because this came out too thin. Perhaps I can give it another go w/ some modifications (i.e. mashing some or all of the potatoes & using less milk and/or broth).

My family loved this soup! I followed the directions for the most part. I didn't have any onions so I used Ms. Dash's Original Seasoning Blend (salt free) approx 1 Tbsp Black coarse pepper approx 1 Tbsp Sea salt approx 1 tsp; Chicken Roasted Bouillon (paste) approx 1 Tbsp. I mixed that with the 4 cups of chicken broth; potatoes; celery; and chopped carrots. Cooked on medium till soft not mushy. Then added the milk; corn starch; water; and cheese. Stirred till all melted together and thickened. Then turned it to warm for about 5-10 minutes and served. I put a bit more shredded cheese on each serving when I gave it to my family! OMG they all raved! This one was a definite winner! They want me to make it again YAY!!

this is a great basic potato soup recipe. next time i think i'll make it with leeks instead of regular onions or maybe even shallots. i like making it with red potatoes and leaving the skins on as well. what i DID do this time around is drop about 1T of cajun seasoning in it to give it a kick and the next day upon re-heating it for my lunch it was soooo wonderful. thanks again!

this is a wonderful Potato Soup. I also added crumbled bacon and a shredded carrot. I had a partial can of evaporated milk leftover from holiday baking and used it for part of the milk. Will definitely be making this again.

This recipe satisfied my Potato Soup craving and then some! Easy to make I mashed the potatoes a bit while slowly adding the milk; It made for a very creamy and delicious soup. Leftovers plentiful and tasted just as good as the first night.

My kids and grandkids loved it. I added more potatoes and used corn starch for thickening. Topped each bowl with a little cheese and celery salt. The left overs were gone in a day.
