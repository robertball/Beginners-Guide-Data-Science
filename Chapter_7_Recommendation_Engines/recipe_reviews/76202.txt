Excellent! I made the recipe as written and it turned out just great. The apple froze solid overnight in my freezer, so when I put all the stuff in my food processor and processed it, it was almost ready to serve with very little additional freezing. I agree that the peel does add texture (as indicated in the recipe), but in this case, that is not a bad thing. I will be making this one often!

The flavor and texture are fantastic - but I think next time I will only leave half of the skins on the apples.  They made it a little too grainy for me.

MMMMM! One of the most delicious sorbets I've ever tasted-though i cut back a little on the sugar & i enjoyed it more, but other wise yum! The LEMON was to the touch- it complimented the desert. Well done!

This dish was very good and very easy to make.  I was skeptical about not peeling the apples but the previous reviewers were right, it makes for a very nice texture.  You can also adjust the amount of sugar to get it as sweet (or tart) as you like.

A good sorbet, but definitely too sweet for my taste if made as directed.  It tasted a bit like frozen applesauce.  I used a blender, and it came out a little grainy/mealy; next time I'll try the food processor.

This was frozen sweetened applesauce!  It tastes good; next time, I might add some cinnamon and nutmeg!

well - it was good - all my guest ate it up - my husband liked it - but it was not by far the best i've ever had -- i prefer the Lemon Ice 1 on this site to this... that was a 5 star treat -- maybe if this had some cinnamon instead of lemon to spice it up -- that might help.

This was a fun recipe to make!  I tripled the recipe as I was making it to bring in to my daughter's class.  I did peel about 1/2 of the apples.  The flavor & texture were excellent.  I was worried because I tasted it before I churned it & the lemon was very strong - but when I served it the next day, the lemon was not overpowering, it just enhanced the apple flavor.

This turned out super creamy and super delicious! I would use about half the sugar next time, but I'm sure it depends on how sweet the apples are to start with.

YUM!

I can say that this is good .But i use this recipe for Applesauce and add Truvia .It is real sweetner that has no caloric count and if your a Diabetic then Its better for you than sugar or Honey.If you add cinnamon to this its great also.4 starsi rate it.
