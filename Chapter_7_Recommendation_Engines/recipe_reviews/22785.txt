The main part of the pie had a great taste-gooey and sweet, though not at all like a custard pie . It tasted more like a canadian sugar pie.  Following the directions exactly, the pie remained soft, had to eat it with a spoon.  The meringue was pointless-didn't really go well with the rest of the pie.

Instead of brown sugar delight, try molasses delight! Substitute 2 cups mild molasses and 2 cups granulated sugar for the 2 cups of brown sugar.
