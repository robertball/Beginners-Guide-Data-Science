Instead of using ice cubes, I used frozen banana chunks. I added two packets Truvia. I drank this when I got up at six and it kept me full until about one. Not bad.

I tried to make this smoothie as written, but my high end blender is broken and the regular one just would not break down the ice. Since my banana was not frozen to compensate for the lack of ice I added some vanilla yogurt-omitting the extract-to thicken it up. My biggest problem is the bitterness of the cocoa- I used the type specified- regular, unsweetened- and found the whole smoothie overwhelmed with a bitter chocolate flavor (even though I only used a scant tablespoon). The extra sugar in the vanilla yogurt could not compensate, nor the extra bit of banana I added. On a positive note:this IS filling...I don't think I'll be hungry for hours. (Sorry to be one of those pesky reviews that hasn't completely followed the recipe, I just can't imagine the flavor itself being much improved by perfectly crushed ice.)

I liked this banana chocolate concoction. Very easy to make. Next time I am going to try making it with frozen bananas.

I added more banana, almond milk and used less ice.  Plus I added a pinch of chai seeds and whey protein.  Each time it comes out a little more to my taste.  I was looking for a good and simple shake.  This one works.  Thanks

I was not pleased with this shake.  it lacked flavor.  I added more vanilla, milk chocolate powder and it tasted worse.  I eventually added a table spoon of sugar so that i could drink it.  I will try frozen bananas next time.

Very little flavor, too much ice! My kids asked if they have to drink it. Disappointing!

I followed the recipe as written.  My daughter and I found it to be a bland icee at best.  Very watery.
I just finished pouring the almond milk into an icecube tray and then covered with saran wrap.  Next batch I'll try to use that with frozen banana and leave water ice cubes completely out and see how that tastes...but it's a great idea to start.  Tweaking to fit individual tastes:)                                                          
Update:

Remade 8/25/16:  8 frozen almond milk cubes
                  1/2 cup almond milk
                  2 heaping tbl Hersey's non-sweetened dark chocolate powder
                  2 Splenda fiber added individual packets
                  1 medium frozen banana
Much, much better.  Tasted like a smoothie and not an Icee.  It is still definitely not what I would call a "shake".

Made this every day last summer - 2015. It is a bit bitter, but I made it sweeter by making sure my banana was ripened like you would for making banana bread, cause it's naturally sweeter and added the whole banana instead of 1/3. You can also add 2tsp. granulated sugar or 1tsp. Truvia. Delish!!! PERFECT FOR HOT DAYS!
