I was looking for something very quick and easy (which it was) that the kids would eat (which they didn't).  There was a total lack of flavor...my apologies to the person who submitted this one...but maybe all those spices are there for a reason, because this was very bland and the texture of the cake was just "wierd"...I don't know how else to describe it.  I took it to a party and ended up tossing most of the cake when we came home.  We will not make this one again, but will go back to the tried and true recipe with all of the spices and the crushed pineapple and coconut.

This recipe is very close to the one my mom was "famous" for. I used all-purpose flour and did not add baking powder or soda and it is just fine. For those who do not like a lot of "spice", this is a great recipe. I only used 1 teaspoon and it is just right for us. I also did not add nuts this time. Yummy!

This is an excellant carrot cake. I used less oil 1 3/4 cups and added raisins as my kids love the raisins as well. Then we added 1 cup of original unsweetened applesauce. This was awesome and it was like Grandma's recipe. Great Job.

I've made this cake on several occasions and I love it. I am not a fan of raisins or pineapple in carrot cake, and have found this recipe to be a great stand by. People love it when I bring it to parties, and I've always found it to be easy to make with fantastic results. I sometimes add a bit more spices to it, but depends on my mood. 

I'm not sure what the reviewers who found the texture to be weird or gross did, but for me, this recipe has always been moist and delicious.

I LOVED this cake! WOW! My kids couldn't even wait until it was frosted. It was super sweet and moist. I think the problem some of the others had was that they may have missed the self-rising flour. I did! I had everything mixed and had to go back and add salt and baking powder. (3 tsp baking powder & 1 tsp salt) I also baked this in a 9x13 pan and it worked well. Great recipe, Diane! Thanks!

this recipe was quite possibly the grossest and weirdest tasting and looking "cakes" (and i use that term loosely) that i have ever made, tasted, and seen. eeww. sorry to the person who invented this cake, but it is lacking ingredients and its not a good thing! they're there for a reason...TASTE.

I halved the recipe and only made one layer, but this cake came out great.  It had a moist, tender crumb inside but there was a slight crispness to the top and bottom that I just loved.  Next time I will try adding 1/2 cup golden raisins.  I may also try making it with grated apples or Fuyu (hard) persimmons instead of carrots!  Thank you.

I am sorry to say but I don't think this recipe deserves even the one star. This cake was really bland and oily. Sorry to the person who submitted it.

I made this cake twice.  I wanted to give it a fair chance.  Both times this cake was a big disappointment. The texture and appearance were really bad.

This cake is delicious and so easy to make. The hardest part is grating the carrots, make sure to set aside enough time for that!

I have made this cake before and was not happy about all the oil it required.  Today, I made it with only 1 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce.  It was every bit as good.  Next time I'll try it with half oil and half applesauce.  -The people that gave this cake only 1 star I suspect their problem may have been that they did not use self rising flour.

I made this today and it was really good!

I made some changes: I used 1 cup regular flour and 1 cup whole wheat, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 cardamom, and I added 1 tablespoon honey for extra flavour. Also, I flavoured my frosting with maple extract instead of vanilla, and it is YUMMY! Thank you for sharing!

Perfect recipes for people who don't like all the extras.  For those who want more spice, try using heaping teaspoons of cinnamon.

Easy to make. I haven't baked a cake for years, so this was a great one to start with. I personally will add less sugar next time. I have already eaten 2 slices and it is not cold enough to ice yet...
