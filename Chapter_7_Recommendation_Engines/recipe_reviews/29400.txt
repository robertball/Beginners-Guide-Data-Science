This was very good you can't tell that i has jam in it.  The one thing i would change is that i would fold in chopped strawberries into the cream cheese mixture and i would pour the sauce over the cut slices of pie instead of over the whole pie.  I  had found the sauce a little too runny, it could be that i blended it too much that or i would try to thicken it with some constartch.  will be making this one again

This pie was DELICIOUS! And very easy to make.  My 8 year old helped and she thinks it's the best pie ever! I will make this one again and again.  The only sub I made was to add an extra 3-4oz of cream cheese and put a few chopped strawberries in the cream cheese - whip topping mixture, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it wasn't too soupy - it was just right.  I didn't over-puree the strawberry mixture and left it a little chunky as the recipe called for and it turned out great!  Thanks so much!

WOW is all I can say about this recipe. I made this for our Memorial Day cookout. I could tell that my father in law was a bit disappointed when he learned that I did not make traditional strawberry pie. That was quickly replaced with raves over this dessert. He has requested this one again for Father's Day. I followed the recipe exactly except that I accidentally bought a ten inch crust instead of a nine inch. It worked just fine and the four of us ate the whole pie over two days. Yum!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious. We made our own graham cracker crust and added chopped strawberries to the cream cheese filling. DELICOUS. I would definitely make this many more times!

This is an extremely easy pie to make.  Deliciously, cool dessert for those hot summer nights.  Definately though will add slices of strawberries to the cream mixture next time for more berry taste.  Will be trying it with other fruits too in the future.

I made it exactly as the recipe called for- except mixing strawberries in with the cream cheese. cool whip. It was phenomenal. I am going to make it again for a picnic tomorrow- but using miniature graham crust pies for individual servings!

This pie was very easy to make and tasted great to boot. It's a bit on the messy side as there's nothing much in it to make it solid and the topping is a bit runny, but that's OK with me. It still tastes fantastic. I added strawberry pieces in a design on the top of it, which made it look nice and added to the taste.

This is easy but it isn't anything exceptional.  The top part is WAY too runny, you need to use it as a sauce served on top.  Easy recipe to fall back on if you have to make something fast and you have berries on hand.  The people I served it to all seemed to like it, but I just think this recipe as it is written is not the best.

So simple to make!  I added sliced strawberries to the cream cheese mixture. Doing so seemed to make the taste complete without needing a topping.  I didn't have grenadine syrup to use for the topping so I used 1/3 cup of strawberry preserves and replaced the granulated sugar with 1/4 cup of powered sugar. I also waited until the pie had chilled before adding the topping. I now consider this a "must have" for our summer bbq's.

We are planning on making this today...but....QUESTION.  Can whipped cream be substituted for "cool whip"?

Added 1/2 cup confectioners sugar to cream cheese and folded in the berries and cool whip. I just did not think the taste was strong enough without adding the sugar and then a squeeze of lemon juice.
