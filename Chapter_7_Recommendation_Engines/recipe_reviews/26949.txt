I used all different types of peppers.  I thought it looked a bit boring, but it was the hit of the party!  People wanted more.  The recipe really makes 3 packages of rolls.  It's a bit messy rolling, but it's worth it!

Wow, this had so much flavor.  Everyone loved these.  Followed recipe pretty much as written, maybe a little more hot sauce.  Nice and spicy.  Mixed frozen veggies had corn, peas, carrots and green beans.  I want to have another BBQ, so I can make them again.
