This is an excellent recipe.  The first time I made exactly as the recipe stated, however I have found it to be a little too sweet for my taste.  Now whenever I make this, I reduce the amountof honey in half, add two tablespoons each of chilli sauce and balsamic vinegar and 1 cup of chicken broth.  Makes a wonderful sauce.

Definitely a keeper.  Made this for Easter Dinner yesterday and even my pickiest eaters loved it. Lots of leftover sauce (no pork though); my mom even wanted to take some of the sauce home and find some other meat to soak in it.  Easy and delicious.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe except that I browned the meat the day before and put it in it's baking dish covered overnight in the fridge.  I also made the sauce the day before in a separate container and poured it over the meat just before putting it in the oven. Try it. You won't be disappointed.

The best tasting pork tenderloin I've ever had!!!  My husband and I LOVED this recipe.  So easy and yummy.  I made the Russian Salad Dressing from scratch (got recipe from All Recipes).  I also placed carrots and potatoes around the tenderloin and sprinkled some freshly chopped garlic on top of the veggies.  A complete meal that was hard to stop eating.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated except I used chicken, I didn't have honey so I used sugar and I didn't have Russian dressing so I used ranch and I didn't have onion soup mix so I used powdered milk. Oh and don't have an oven so I put it outside on a metal tray to cook in the sun. It was perfect! I wouldn't change a thing!

I made this recipe in the slow cooker and let it simmer on low all day. (Approx. 10 hours)  It was absolutely delicious.  The aroma was wonderful and the meat was fork tender and juicy!  The leftovers were used to make a yummy tortilla wrap!

This was really good.  The pork turned out moist and very tender.  I agree with other reviewers about cutting down on the honey.  I used maple syrup because at the last minute I discovered I didn't have any honey.  I cut that back to 1/2 a cup but I think 1/4 of a cup would be plenty using either honey or maple syrup.  I found the sauce too sweet to be pouring over the meat once everything was on the dinner table.  I will be making this again.  I didn't have Russian Dressing so I made it following the recipe Chilled Russian Salad Dressing from this sight.  Thanks for sharing.

This turned out great, my notoriously picky wife even liked this after I made it.  I do use a little bit less honey than the recipe calls for.  Also, once I forgot to pick up the honey , so substituted mayple syrup, and that came out great also.

This was absolutely delicious. My husband who isn't a big pork fan has already asked when we can have this again. 

If I can get my KIDS 3&5 both loved this too and they don't eat meat! 
For sure a WHOLE family favorite.

I have to give this 5 stars because it was SO good, but I did alter the recipe a bit. My tenderloin came pre-marinated in teriaki, so I wanted to go with that flavor. I used half a bottle of asian salad dressing with a quarter cup of maple syrup for the sauce, and skipped the onions. Came out so tender! Thanks for the recipe!

I used Vidalia Onion dressing instead of Russian (out of convenience), and it was terrific. Loved the sauce.

Absolutely YUMMY!!! I did cut the honey down to 1/4 cup, I suggest mixing the dressing & soup mix together first, then add honey a bit at a time to taste. Be sure to remove the silver membrane from the pork tenderloin before cooking it... otherwise the roast will draw up & be much drier. LOVE IT!!!

This is really tasty and tender (as advertised) and also easy to make.  BUT the onion soup powder mix it calls for it too much.  I used a whole pack like it said and it was too onion-y.  Half a pack would probably be better.

Delish and easy!  After reading some of the reviews about the sweetness, I decided to use less honey than the recipe called for - about 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cups.   Also, I used a reddish/brown Russian dressing - but there are so many different kinds - some that look more creamy, like 1000 island.  I think the dressing was just right.  My husband and I will enjoy this again and again!

This really is a good recipe! I only had a little bit of Catalina dressing left in the fridge, so I made a real small batch of the Russian Style Creamy Salad Dressing from this site and mixed it with the 3 Tbs of Catalina dressing I had, as well as honey to taste and half a package of the onion soup mix. I had 2 - 1 lb pork tenderloins. I seasoned with salt and pepper, and browned on all sides. I put the tenderloins on a lined baking sheet and covered them in the sauce. Because I used the Creamy Salad Dressing, it really adhered to the pork. I did not need to baste it all. I left it uncovered and baked at 350 degrees for 40 minutes (all depends on your oven temperature and size of the meat). They came out at 150 degrees. I covered with foil and let rest for 10 minutes to come up to temperature (160 degrees) before I sliced them. Amazing results! Never would have thought combining the dressing with honey and onion soup mix would be that delicious! My family loved it. Thanks, Christine!

My husband loved this recipe. The pork was very tender and tasty. He loves the sauce on other meats as well. He wants to bottle the sauce and sell it.

This was so good I even liked it and pork is not my favorite meat.  My husband liked it so well he said I should always fix it that way.
I didn't have Russian Dressing so I used Kraft Catalina dressing. It had excelllent flavor.  And the pork was unbelievably tender.  I liked it so much I used it on Pork Country Ribs with the same result.
I will definitely be using it again and trying it on other meats.

Oh, my! This is so good! I used Russian Salad Dressing from this site (Thanks, Ken!) I used a ham eye fillet ( BOGO ! ) I didn't have honey so I used 1/4 C. mollasses, and only 1/2 package onion soup mix. I sliced the meat thin, and tossed it in the pan with the sauce. Everyone loved this, and I will make it again soon. (BOGO!) Thank you, Christine!

Did not like the taste at all.  I found the onion flavor overpowering along with the sweet taste a bit odd.  I would never waste food, so I did eat it, but my whole family gave it the thumbs down.  Sorry but this will not be on my list to ever make again.

I browned this in a pan and then stuck it in the crockpot with the sauce on his for awhile (maybe 2 1/3-3 hours?). I served it on white rice, and it was really good. It sort of reminded me of sweet and sour pork, like you'd get at a Chinese restaurant over rice. Not exactly, but it reminded me of that and everyone loved it.

Quick & easy to prepare.  Although I didn't have the Russian-style salad dressing, I substituted it with Italian dressing and it was still excellent. Very delicious & most definitely a keeper.

Simply Delicious! I didn't think this recipe sounded as good as it actually was. I have been trying different recipes for pork tenderloin for years because my husband just doesn't like pork tenderloin, but this one he chowed down! Thank you!

This is delicious!  Russian-style salad dressing is not in your every day grocery store and can be really hard to find. So, I made one from scratch that took about 5 min.  Added it to this recipe and it was perfect!

I browned cubed pork and threw everything into the crockpot.  Served it over brown rice.  Very good.  When I made it the second time, I shredded the meat and served on buns, the kids ate it all!

WOW. This was fantastic! I was a little wary while I was making it because the bright pink color (and the smell too) of the sauce kind of put me off, but when I took a bite it was AWESOME! My boyfriend LOVED it, I caught him spooning leftover sauce into his mouth while I was cleaning up! I cut every bit of fat off the tenderloin so I was a little worried it wouldn't be as tender but it was still very tender. I didn't have bottled Russian dressing so I made my own from one of the recipes on this site. I would highly recommend!

We made this exactly as written.  Delicious!  I would honestly order this at a restaurant.  Easy to make, easy to clean up.  Add a nice side and a salad, and it's good enough to serve company.

This was my first attempt at cooking pork and I am no longer afraid! I grew up hating pork because I always thought it was so dry. Thanks to this recipe, I have officially changed my opinion of pork! This recipe came out incredible. Using my mother's advice I ignored the time suggestion and cooked by temperature (to 160 degrees). The pork came out perfect, and the sauce was amazing. I served it with the Honey Roasted Red Potatoes recipe also from this site, and it was a great dinner.

Delicious! Easy! Just my style. For a tenderloin that's 3 or 4 pounds no need to increase the receipe. I'm going to try it on chicken.

My pork tenderloin turned out real tender. The sweet sauce wouldn't be something I'd choose again in the future, even with adding less honey as a lot of reviewers recommended.

BEST Tenderloin Recipe EVER!!  I cut down the honey to 1/2 Cup as some reviews stated and it has turned out great!  I've made it both in the oven and the slow-cooker and both are fantastic!  This is one of my make ahead and freeze meals.  I make it to step #4 and then cool and freeze in a freezer bag.  Unthaw a day ahead and then dump everything in the slow-cooker in the morning.  Add a side of steamed veggies, rice/potatoes and a salad.  Low to no fuss gourmet!

I made this the other night. I was a little hesitant because of the russian dressing and honey, but it turned out wonderful! My guests loved it. My fiance doesn't even really like pork, and he thought it was great! I didn't adjust anything.

This was fantastic! There's not much that my bf get's really excited about.  I usually get "It's good baby" This he really loved and requested that I make it often!  Usually I have to ask if he liked it and is it worth making again.  There was no question this time.  I didn't change a thing!

if i could give 6 stars i would. this was the best pork tenderloin i have ever made. i have actually made this recipe 5 or 6 times now but haven't reviewed it until now. for the russian dressing i used the "russian style creamy salad dressing" recipe from this site. so so so good. served it with roasted red potatoes and asparagus.

It can be so easy to dry out a lovely pork tenderloin of one isn't careful.  This recipe was easy and delicious and the pork was very tender and moist.  My husband said I could make it anytime....now that's his ultimate compliment.  I was leary of the sweetness since I don't like really, really sweet things, but I did exactly what the recipe said, and I found it was not a cloying sweetness, at all. The only thing I added to this recipe was some heat...about 2 tsps of dried chile peppers...and quite frankly, I would use more next time.  I love that sweet/hot contrast...the next time I may try some finely chopped jalapeno or serrano chiles.  I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe and will use it again.

The whole family LOVED this recipe, based on alterations I made. I followed other reviewers' advice and halved both the honey and the dry soup mix. Instead of using a bottled dressing, I made the Chilled Russian Salad Dressing that is on this site, doubling the chili sauce the recipe asks for. Cooking pork tenderloin for such a long time also dries it out. I used a probe and removed it from the oven when the internal temperature was 145 degrees and tented it under foil for five minutes before serving. Yummy!!!

I found this recipe to be far too sweet and almost inedible.  The syrup makes the sauce more like candy and not an entree.  I will not make it again and would not recommnd it to anyone.  Should have expected it will all the sauce ingredients being processed items.

The first few bites had a nice tangy taste to them, but after that, both my wife and I found it to be too salty on the taste buds. The culprits being the Onion soup mix and the Russian dressing, which are loaded with sodium. If you are on a low sodium diet, then you really need to avoid this recipe, it has over 1700 mg of sodium, which is 2/3 of your recommended daily allowance.

Just finished cleaning up after this wonderful dinner.  My tenderloin was smaller than 1 1/2 lb so I used less dressing and should have cut back the onion soup mix.  It was still very good but borderline too salty for my taste.  I also cut back the honey and used Chilled Russian Dressing from allrecipes.  The meat was very moist, tender and tasty.  I know I'll be making this one again!

This was yummy.....very tender and tasty, just like the name says!  Of course, I didn't have any Russian dressing but mixed Catalina with some mayo and hot sauce and a bit of horseradish followed the rest of the recipe and both my husband and I really loved it.   Next time I am going to thin out the sauce before serving and put it over rice.  Maybe will have to add a little more dressing to do so, but it will be worth it.    As is, it was delicious.

This is one of my favorites! I have tried it with both tenderloin in the oven (awesome but expensive) and a loin roast in the crock pot (still very good and much cheaper). I get so many compliments whenever I make this that I feel guilty it's so easy!

The usual marinated pork tenderloin is almost always what I prepare. I have been lucky with that method but I must admit that there are times when I don't feel like doing that much messy prep work in the evening. However, I did make Russian dressing from AR the night before. I followed the recipe as it was written and my family really liked it. I had to use a mixture of honey, corn syrup and maple syrup as that is what I had on hand. I guess I can see where some may find the sauce too sweet. I didn't find this myself. I might use 3/4 of a packet of onion soup as it stood out a little too much. I really liked browning the meat prior to it's oven time. It added a nice texture as well as flavour. Next time I may cut the roasting time by 10 - 15 min. My meat thermometer is broken so I couldn't check doneness and the meat was a little on the dry side. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I'm sure I will make it again.

What a crowd-pleaser at my small dinner party! I was not able to find Russian dressing in our market, so used Catalina.I doubled all sauce ingredients, as I was roasting a 3-lb loin, but only used a total of 1/4 cup honey, as 2 guests are diabetic, and I took that into consideration. The Catalina added sweetness of its own. I added 1 cup chicken broth to the sauce ingredients. The result was incredibly delicious. Guests asked for the recipe.

Very tasty recipe! I was leery about using this combination, but it was delicious! I did follow some of the other reviews here and reduced the honey to a little less than 1/2 cup. I measured in 1/4 cup increments. Added from there. I also used the "chilled russian dressing" from this site. 
One of the things I did different was to add a few tsps. of balsamic vinegar to the sauce, I love balsamic with pork and this helped cut some of the sweetness. I cooked mine in a reynolds oven cooking bag at 325,till it reached 160 degrees and it was perfect with mashed potatoes and a salad on the side.

I didn't expect to like this recipe, but thought it sounded interesting enough to try.  I was surprised by how good it turned out.  Not only was it simple to make with fairly standard ingredients, but it was absolutely delicious!  

I am definitely adding this one to my favorites and will be making it again.

This was very simple and easy to make.  I only found one brand of Russian dressing and thought it looked too creamy (like Thousand Island) - but, it actually worked perfectly.  I only used 1/4 cup of honey based on other reviewers suggestions and it was plenty - any more would be too sweet.  In my oven I only needed to cook it for 45 minutes instead of the full hour - I cooked until the pork registered 160 degrees and then took it out, covered with foil, and let sit for 10 minutes.  I thought this was really good - my husband liked it, but, he thought the onion taste was a little strong for his taste.

Perhaps I did something wrong...the only Russian salad dressing I could find was made by Wishbone and wasn't creamy (or mayonnaise-based).  Anyway, the pork was very tender and moist as others have indicated; however, the sauce had a sweet-and-sour flavor.  The onions from the soup mix were still a little crunchy--even after baking for the full amount of time.  Good, but not great.

Went over very well in my house...even my "picky eater" son ate it! I did as was suggested and cut the honey down to 1/2 cup and it was still very good. This is definitely a "keeper".

We loved this! My hubby stepped on broken glass getting to this in our garage fridge - had to go to the dr. to have it removed. He said the pork was so good he can overlook the incident : ) Followed others' input - reduced honey to 1/4 c - other than that - followed to a "T" (used Ken's S'house brand dressing - lighter in color, seemingly creamier than other brands.) Curious how this would be cooked in a crockpot or wrapped in foil in the oven (to make clean-up easier.) Thanks so much!!

This one is difficult to rate as my husband gave it a 5 and my son and I gave it a 3.  My son and I don't care for the taste of honey and this had a strong taste of honey.  However, the cooking method produced a very tender and juicy roast and I don't usually have good luck with pork.  So, I will try this again and reduce the honey to perhaps 1/4 to 1/2 cup and if that doesn't work maybe I'll try maple syrup instead.  The sweetness of the sauce did compliment the pork, it was just the honey flavor that was the problem.  I took the advice of JeannieBeannie and used the "Russian Style Creamy Salad Dressing" recipe from this site too.

I have made this 3 times now and it is awesome. I made it for my father-in-law, a man hard to please and he was going back for forths. Give it a shot you will not be disappointed. The only thing I do different is I put Rosemary  and some other spices on about an hour before I brown it.

I'm giving this 5 stars for taste, because the pork was very tender (no surprise for the cut of meat) and the sauce/marinade was an awesome tangy compliment to the meat.  My husband stated this was the best pork he's tasted yet!  I omitted the honey altogether (not my choice, went to get my honey and it was hard as a brick) and doubled the salad dressing per other reviews. (Kept the onion mix the same). However, I would only give this 2 1/2 stars for presentation........the salad dressing separates in the oven and leaves you with an oily mess of a "sauce" that does not look appetizing.  Perhaps the honey changes things by keeping it thicker.  Either way, this was awesome served over rice.  I used Uncle Ben's Converted Rice which stays much more moist than regular white rice. Definitely a keeper, although next time I will add the honey and see what happens.

yum!!!!  This is so tender.  I'm not a big fan of super sweet things, so I cut way back on the honey (as russian dressing tastes really sweet to me all ready).  I only used probably 1/4-1/3 cup of honey.  I've been burned too by onion soup mix in that it is incredibly salty...so I put in about 3/4 of the package.  So easy and tasty!!  Definitely a keeper.

Good recipe, I will use it again.  The pork was very moist and the 'sauce' was very tasty.  Buttered noodles and green beans went with it well.

This recipe worked out great. I used a tenderloin, but also used up a couple of pieces of pork I had in the freezer. I added some water as the sauce was too thick to cover it all. It turned out sticky sweet - perfect with rice!

Hands down the best pork tenderloin I've ever made, and I've made lots!  The only changes I made werer to make my own Russian Dressing from this site as another reviewer suggested, and to decrease the cooking time after removing the aluminum foil to ~ 8 minutes (I inserted a meat thermometer after removing the aluminum foil).  Juicey, savory, tender - an absolute KEEPER!  Thanks so much.

This was absolutely horrid. It was salty, strong, and almost inedible. I would never make this again. My daughter refused to eat it, my son just looked at me, and my hubby said not every recipe is a winner.

Roasted this today for Easter dinner. Cooked rice and spooned some of the sauce over the rice.  Along with fresh carrots, hot rolls and salad it was a feast.  I used 1/4 cup of honey but next time I will use a little less. It is a keeper though.  QUILTERKAY

I had some pork tenderloin in the freezer so I decided on this recipe. The Russian Dressing, honey, onion mix sauce was fantastic; very, very delicious with pork. I opted to slow cook in the crock pot and it was just fine.

Just finished serving this delicious dinner.  The flavor is fantastic and so simple to put together.  As suggested by others I decreased the honey and only used about 1/2 package of onion soup mix.  It makes a lot of sauce, you could really cut that quantity in half also.  This is a keeper.

FANTASTIC!! I didn't have Russian dressing, so I substituted a raspberry hazelnut vinegarette and it was great -- more of a sweet glaze. Hubby and kiddos cleaned their plates and asked for more!

This recipe is wonderful, and does not necessarily need to be used with a pork tenderloin. I've also made this recipe with pork chops and chicken breasts. For the sauce, I use 8 oz. Russian dressing, 1/2 C  honey (3/4 is too sweet), 1 envelope soup mix and 2 tbsp balsamic vinger (per a suggestion from another review). I set aside about 1/2 c. of the sauce and used the rest as a marinade, marinating the chicken breasts for 5 hours.  (Next time I will marinade them for longer.) I then grilled the chicken, using the sauce I set aside, as a baste. The important thing with this sauce is to not baste too soon, as the honey can cause it the chicken to burn. It's best to begin basting when the chicken is 3/4 cooked. Enjoy!

I substituted Vidalia Onion dressing instead of the Russian dressing.  It was great.  I recommend checking the temperature after 45 minutes.  The 1 hour cooking time allowed the pork to be well done.  I think at 45 minutes the roast would be medium to medium well.  It was still very juicy and tendder with the 1hour time.

Made this for my family and a friend's when she was recovering from surgery. Very tasty. Kids loved it because it is on the sweeter side. Got great reviews from both families. I had to triple the recipe and it still turned out great. Served it with green beans almondine and a rice dish.

This recipe was ok, I did find it too sweet even after cutting back on the honey as suggested, i only used half a cup, well it was half a cup of honey, half a cup of maple syrup (thats all i had), and the onion mix was a little overpowering and i just thought overall it was a different taste that was just ok.

I usually follow a recipe exactly when I make it the first time.  Unfortunately, I discovered that I only had 1/2 cup of honey on hand.  I made the recipe anyway because I noticed that some reviewers said it was too sweet.  It was very good and I will definitely make it again.  I think I will probably continue to use 1/2 cup of honey because it was great that way.

Normally pork tenderloin is kind of dry and flavorless, but this recipe is great!  The russian dressing is an odd sounding combination, but is very flavorful and delicious!

THE BEST EVER!  I doubled the recipe (5 lbs pork tenderloin) and put it in the slow cooker on low for six hours.  Added Vidalia Onion vinegrette dressing since I didn't have enough Russian.  This was the absolute best.  My kids have had it on sandwiches for lunch.  You could add some wing sauce and it would taste like spicy bbq.  A versitile recipe for a busy mom, thanks!

Very tender. Used Creamy Vidalia Onion dressing, 1/8 cup of honey, 1 tsp Balsamic Vinegar,1/2 cup of  onions, 1 tablespoon of garlic. Sauteed onion and garlic. Mixed in with salad dressing. Browned meat and put in a baking dish lined with aluminum foil. Baked for 55 minutes and internal temp was 160 degrees. Definitely a keeper!

I just made this pork for my family.  I use the Chilled Russian Salad Dressing like everyone suggested.  The results were fantastic.  Usually when I cook pork it turns out dry and chewy.  This was not at all the case when using this recipe.  After taking the meat out of the dish I added some water and corn starch to make a gravy.  Served with mashed potatoes, green beans and broccoli....dinner done!

Very tasty, tender and simple to put together!  I am not a fan of Russian dressing; the onion soup mix enhanced it greatly.  (I also used the Chilled Russian Dressing recipe: doubled the Worcestershire sauce, added Tapitio sauce for zing and used reduced fat mayo).  The honey was essential in giving the sauce clingability while roasting, but I reduced it to 1/2 cup. I served this with mashed potatoes, stuffing, lima beans, and sliced tomatoes and cukes.  We have leftovers which makes me happy!

What a wonderful recipe.  I throw it in the slow-cooker because I love the smell permeating throughout the house.  I did cut down on the honey but that's a matter of taste.

I live in a small town and couldn't find Russian dressing. I used Catalina dressing instead and it was tangy and wonderful. Friends who have access to larger grocery stores have tried making it both ways and actually prefer the Catalina!

Great recipe and so easy. The kids loved it and so did me and my husband. I also put carrots and sliced potatoes in the pan. It cam eout great. I only cooked the pork for 45 minutes. Any longer and I think it would have been over done.

This sounded strange, but I fixed it based on reviews, and my family LOVED this dish! I am not a big Russian dressing fan, but it really turned out nice and was so simple. My family definitely wants this served again (soon).

I found the flavour to be a bit strong, by the third bite I was finished. Maybe less onion soup mix. May have been better with a bit less sauce on the pork.

Very tasty, and easy. Didn't have russian dressing on hand so found a recipe on here and used that. Worked out very flavourful, tender and juicy. If you have kids picky about onions, filter them out of the onion soup mix or just use onion soup base. Us grownups loved it as is though. Sauce drizzled over sliced medallions is delicious. Will make again!

I was tired of fixing my pork tenderloin the same old way I always do, so I came here to see what I could find...I found this recipe--very different from anything I've ever done--and it was terrific AND easy!! I saved some of the sauce and used it the next day on chicken--that was great, too!
Thanks for the recipe!!

I printed this recipe a while ago but hesitated to try it; now I wish I hadn't waited so long.  What a great meal this made.  We had noodles one night and with the leftovers, rice. This is one we will repeat many times.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

This was excellent.  Not what I expected, you can opt Thousand island dressing, maple syrup and leek soup mix.  Just the right proportions of zest, sweet & flavor not to drown out the more subtle flavor of the pork.  Even the left overs remained tender and deliscioso.  Great w/brown rice.

This is an excellent pork dish.  Initially, I thought it was going to be too sweet, due to the honey and the dressing, but it was just perfect.  This one's a keeper!

This was a nice change of flavor.  Everyone in the family gave it 5 stars. I used Western dressing and just slightly reduced the honey. Used the sauce to put over the mashed potatoes (most of us) and had no leftovers! I am def keeping this one! Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe has a very unique yet delicious flavor profile mixing the beef/onion mix with Russian dressing.  Who would of thought.  Try that beef/onion mix  to doctor up baked beans as well.  It took me by surprise!

I loved the sauce, but after reading other reviews, I may tweak it some when I prepare it again. My only reason for giving it three stars was that it was not tender. I know how finicky tenderloin is, so I used a thermometer.  The meat still took about an hour to reach 145 degrees (which is supposed to be perfect for this cut), but it came out tight. I will try it again. Maybe it was my new oven, but it would be nice to have had a meat temperature to shoot for.

Delicious! Very tender & so tasty.
I also reduced the honey to 1/4 C and it didnt take away from the recipes yummy taste at all!
I serve this with Garlic & Herb mashed potatoes, Cinnamon glazed carrots and Green beans with cashews and an onion glaze.
One of our favorite recipes!!

So delicious. I was amazed at the flavors that melded together into something so special. I served with roasted red potatoes and Brussels sprouts. Brown bagging tomorrow can hardly wait!

Delicious, Per other reviews I used just under 1 packet of onion soup mix, left out a bit of the powder part, and much less honey about 1/4-1/2cup and added 1 spoon of chili garlic sauce - very tasty! This made plenty of sauce and I served it with a rice medley with peppers and onions. I also used a probe for the meat and took it out at 145 and let it sit which raised it to about 150

I made this tonight and will definitely make it again. It was very easy and delicious! Both of my kids enjoyed it-so big success!  I used another reviewer's suggestion of mixing the dressing and onion mix first, then added honey until I reached the right amount to taste. I also added quartered red potatoes to the pan and baked with the meat. Very good!

This is an excellent recipe. I didn't have Russian dressing at hand, so I used Greek dressing instead. For personal taste, I also cut down on the amount of honey so that it wouldn't be so sweet. I served it with a dish of rice with finely chopped green and red peppers and sweet onion incorporated in it.

This dish was so yummy! I made it for my whole family and everyone gave it 2 thumbs way up.  The glaze basically tastes like a honey glaze that has extra flavor from the other 2 ingredients.  I made this with a 2 lb pork tenderloin and still had a lot of leftover glaze, which I will definitely be using to amp up some chicken or rice in the next few days.  I used Wishbone brand Russian dressing, basic clover honey,  and Lipton brand onion soup mix. I served this with rice, which went awesome with the glaze, and brussel sprouts. Tasty and easy- Highly recommend!

Great, easy recipe! I used Kraft's Russian Style Dressing which has a lot of sweetness to it on its own. Cut the honey back to 1/4 cup and it tasted great. May even be able to cut it back a bit more without losing anything. I will try that next time because I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe, guests and family loved it. I did, however, add less than half the honey, and I think it would be better to leave the honey out altogether. Nice part about this recipe is you can adjust to your family's tastes. The pork was somewhat dry when it was all done, but that could have been from leaving it in too long or the pan i used.

I wasn't sure about this recipe, but since my husband LOVES Russian dressing, I thought I'd give it a go. Wow, is it ever simple! I followed the recipe exactly to see what we thought about the full package of onion soup mix and the full amount of honey based on other reviewers complaints. I served it with rice and roasted brussel sprouts and put the sauce all over the pork and rice. I cooked the pork for about 10 min less  than stated because we like ours a little pink. I didn't have to baste it because there was SO much sauce (I kind of eyeballed the measurements).  I am giving it 5 stars because it was SO simple. I usually cook complicated dishes with tons of steps and flavors, so this was a nice change. It would be great for those who have kids and are constantly on the go.  The onion soup mix was a nice touch, but the chunky onion bits were a bit odd at first, however, we turned out loving it. My husband had seconds. A very simple, quite tasty dish that we'll make again. Oh and I used Kraft Russian dressing.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was too late to get the exact ingredients so I used what I had.  Thousand Island instead of Russian dressing and crunched fried onion rings instead of onion soup mix.  It was GREAT!  My husband and son said 'let's have this again'.  The next time, I will use the original ingredients.

Awesome  recipe. I suggest going with your taste buds in determining the correct measurement for each ingredient, and it will turn out fabulous.  My boyfriends favorite, can never make enough! Have with brown rice and the sauce goes great with it. Definitely suggest!

This is SO good!  I had Catalina dressing, which is similar enough to Russian to work well.  My tenderloin wasn't quite a pound, so I cut the honey to 1/3 cup, the dressing to 3/4 cup and 3/4 of the packet of dry onion soup mix.  I jazzed it up just a bit with 1/3 tsp sriracha sauce and deepened the flavor of the sauce with 2 packets of chicken broth concentrate.  It's too hot here to bake, so I put it all in my 9.5" square stove top dutch oven and it cooked up perfectly.  Served with broccoli and was made to promise I would make this often.

I reduced the honey as others did. Unfortunately my husband did not like the sweetness  so this will be a one-time recipe.

It is often difficult to get pork roast to stay moist, but this was outstanding.  My husband remarked several times how good it was and made a sandwich with leftovers later in the evening.  This is a keeper for sure!

I just made this and it is excellent. I did what other reviewers suggested and reduced the honey to 1/2 cup. I also omitted the flour simply  because I forgot it. I cooked it in my crackpot on low and it came out wonderful. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe and so does my family.  I changed two amounts of ingredients.  I use a little over a 1/4 cup of honey and 12 oz of Russian dressing.  It is way to sweet if you use the 3/4 cups of honey.  The extra dressing makes it so you have extra sauce to spoon on like gravy.

This is a go-to recipe at our house! I take the easy route and throw the ingredients in a crockpot and let it go on low all day. It falls apart by dinner time!  I skip the flouring and searing. I just use one pot and it's done!

Very tasty! Very tender! Great flavor combo! Tried it because I did not have time to marinate but the sauce marinates the tenderloin as it cooks! Will definitely make again!

Delicious. Followed recipe but added 1/2 a cup of chicken broth and balsamic vinegar, diced garlic and cherry tomatoes. Absolutely delicious. Never made a dish with pork loin of any kind and the whole family loved it. Served next to an avocado and Marzano tomatoes salad.

I did not care for the flavor at all.  I cut the honey as suggested but still found it way too sweet.  The other flavors just did not come together.  I will not be making this again.

Made this with thousand island because it's all we had. Made mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. This was fantastic. Loved it. For leftovers, I thinned out the sauce with water to make salad dressing and put the pork over a salad. That was good too.

This was everything I love in a sauce - sticky sweet tangy yumminess.  I don't know that I've ever tried Russian dressing before.  I only found one kind at the store and that is what I used.  We loved it.  I didn't like having to baste it every 10 minutes for an hour but I did it and it was worth it.

So I made it tonight for the first time.  I carefully read the recipe and instructions AND all of the comments people have posted.  I decided to go with the recipe, using 2/3 cup honey, about 2/3 of a package of onion soup, plus a Tbs Balsamic vinegar, a sprinkle of cayenne pepper powder and 1/4 cup chicken stock.

I tasted the mixture at each stage and found that it improved (IMHO) with the addition of the extra ingredients.  The chicken stock was only used to thin it out a bit as I was definitely worried about ending up with a paste instead of a sauce.  

I tied my tenderloin using butcher string and prepared it according to the directions.  It turned out fantastic!  Going forward, I will probably drain off the "sauce" at the 30 minute mark, when the recipe calls for the removal of the tinfoil.  This way I can prevent the sauce from hardening at the edges of the pan and minimize the grease from the tenderloin, floating on top of the sauce.  I will put it in small bowls and use it for dipping sauce.

I paired this with K.I.S.S. Brussel Sprouts (from allrecipes's) and Suzy's red mashed potatoes (also from allrecipes's).

I prefer savory or spicy to sweet so I followed another's advice. I made homemade Russian dressing with mayo, chili and garlic sauce, horseradish, parsley and paprika. I did not measure but cut back on the honey. Did two tenderloins. One at a time in the skillet and then tossed them in a foil pan. I was also making roasted Brussels sprouts so went for 375 covered for 15 and uncovered for 20. Let rest for 10 and served sauce for dipping with some honey-cinnamon roasted sweet potatoes too! Yummy! The next day I made a cold pork sandwich on a five grain bread with mayo, arugula and provolone. Delish!!!

Just made this for the 2nd time and loved it just as much this time as last time. I made a couple changes to try to lower the calorie count on it. I only used a tablespoon of oil, no flour (browned the pork without it), cut the dressing to 1/2 cup and the honey to 1/4 cup. It doesn't make as much sauce but it makes enough to make the meat very moist and enough to give everyone a couple->three spoonfuls! My husband loved it and the guests we served tonight loved it too. They even asked for the recipe. A keeper for sure!

I took the slow cooker route with this recipe as well and couldn't have been more pleased.  I grabbed a bottle of Russian dressing and used it to cover 4 small tenderloins; cooked on Low for 6-7 hours, shredded them and let sit in the liquid to absorb the flavor for another 45 minutes before serving.  Everyone loved it!

5 stars for taste but feel guilty when when it comes to using prepackaged ingredients.  I have made this several times for dinner parties.  I mix the glase up ahead of time because I'm guilty of what is in it but when it comes out of the oven it is a crowd pleaser

I made this recipe exactly as written.  The meat was tender, moist and flavorful, and it sliced up nicely. My husband and I loved both the meat and the glaze.  I wouldn't change a thing.

I used everyone's suggestion and cut back on the honey. Also I didn't have enough Russian dressing so I had to use some ketchup. Loved it!

I only added 1/2 pkg. of the onion soup mix. Didn't bother browning the pork tenderloin, just threw it in the slow cooker, mixed all remaining ingredients and poured over the meat. Cooked on low for 8 hrs. Came out amazing and very tender.

I was very happy with the way this turned out! I didn't have Russian Dressing either, so  I made it from a recipe I found on the internet. I also used a little bit less honey. Very easy to make! I will be making this again!

I have been a vegetarian for most of my life, but recently moved back to Ohio to help out my folks, so I was unprepared for cooking meat and pretty much... Terrified! This made it easy! I made it for guests last night and will definitely make it again, but with less honey.  I used Kohr french onion soup with the chunky bits which is not as strong as the "normal" and added cranberries to the top to create festivity! Thanks!

I was disappointed in this recipe, since after reading the reviews I was looking forward to making a really tasty pork tenderloin for my family.  It also seemed very easy to make.  It was easy, but that was the only plus in my opinion.  
All we could taste was SWEET.  I even cut back the honey as others suggested.  The meat had no flavor.  It was almost candied.  I don't mind some sweetness, but this was all wrong.

This was fantastic! I was looking for something different and this is what I went with. I was very pleased. I think next time I may add a few dashes of cayenne to the sauce to give it a kick but it is wonderful made just the way the recipe states. I give this five stars for how yummy it is, but also because it is unique, and is a great weeknight quick meal for those of us in a hurry.

I made this for my family last night.  I did not have any Russian dressing on hand so I used Western. I know the two are pretty different but I was using what I had on hand.  Everyone loved it! The tenderloin came out very juice and tender.

I liked it fine, but the others at my table had issues.  My daughter did not like the onion soup mix flavor and my husband thought it was too sweet, even though i decreased the honey.  I really liked how easy it was, though.

This was great!  First time making Pork Tenderloin and the whole family loved it.  I had leftovers because I had two loins - might want to just stick to one if you are feeding a family of four.

The pork turned out excellent, but I did not like the sauce.  The onion soup was too strong, and overall the sauce tasted like it came out of a box/bottle (which it ultimately did).

I have made this lots of times, always so tender and moist.  The sauce is thick and flavorful.  On the advice of another reviewer I made this in the crockpot today and it was wasn't good!  It was dry, stringy and the sauce was so runny.  It was burnt on the sides of the crockpot. So stick to the recipe!! It's so easy, not much more work than the slow cooker.

This was delicious.  And I just realized prior to rating it, that I forgot the 1st step.  The dusting with flour and browning part.  Will do this the next time but regardless, it turned out great.  I have seen an identical recipe with chicken breasts.  I also used the chilled russian dressing from this site.

Love love love this quick and easy recipe!  Made it for Christmas for my in-laws who are very particular about what they eat and they loved it too.  It's super easy and I've made it for diner a few times since then.  Even my 1 year old and 3 year old love it.  Very happy!!

VERY good!  Easy, too.  I also did not have any Russian dressing in the house, but made the Chilled Russian Dressing from this site.  My husband raved about it!  Leftover will make great sandwiches or wraps later.  I made twice as much of the Russian dressing as needed by mistake, so I gave the other half to a friend.  I made mine in the crockpot and he made his in the oven.  Both extremely delicious!!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is delicious!!!  My entire family enjoys this tenderloin at least once a week (even my fussy eaters!)  It is simple to make and delicious to eat.  Thanks for the recipe.  I do cut back on the honey to 1/4 cup as recommended by others.

Love, love, love this, great meal for entertaining.  Reduce honey to 1/3 cup and use whole 16oz bottle of dressing.  I serve with either rice or baked potato and a veggie and salad.

Like some other reviewers, I made my own Russian dressing (couldn't find it at the store) and reduced the honey to ¼ cup. This was my first attempt at pork tenderloin, and I thought the recipe was very tasty! Be careful not to overcook the pork; use an internal thermometer.

I thought that this wasn't bad since I'm usually not a fan of pork. My kids would only eat a few bites and hubby didn't care for it. I did what other reviewers suggested by using 1/4 c. of honey. It did turn out very moist though. May make it again but it will most likely be awhile.

Meat was tender but sauce was too salty.  I'd try again but omit onion soup mix and just add some sauted onions.

I'm new to this cooking thing and look for "quick and easy."  This is not only quick and easy but very good.  My kids love it.  I've already made it twice in two weeks.  Comes out great without any changes.  Thank you!

YUM! I made this just as the recipe suggests and it was yummy. I might try cutting back on the honey next time or using maple syrup. This was a quick & easy recipe that my family loved. Perfect paired with wild rice and veggies.

I really don't like pork, but my husband loves it.  I haven't been able to find a recipe that I could handle.  This is by far the BEST tenderloin that I have ever eaten!!  I followed the advice of many and cut the honey to 1/4 cup but everything else stayed the same.  Very simple recipe with excellent results.  Thank you for sharing :)

I was looking for a recipe for ingredients I had on hand and this did the trick.  I substituted Catalina salad dressing and reduced the honey to ¼ cup.  Also used boneless country style pork ribs which are not as tender as a tenderloin, so I baked them covered for 1 hour and uncovered for 15 minutes.  My only complaint is that the sauce was really greasy but would not have been had I used the tenderloin.  Really good served with cole slaw.

This recipe was extremly delicious!  I have never cooked pork before, and this was so simple.  However, I took the advice of others and cut back the honey to 1/4 cup.  It was perfect!  I used the recipe from this site "chilled russian salad dressing" for the sauce.  That was great as well!

Very good.  I used a small pork roast because it was on sale! Cooked a little longer because of that but was excellent.  I did substitute 1/4 cup of maple syrup instead of honey.

I served this for Christmas dinner. My husband took one bite and said this recipe is a keeper. He thought it was very delicious. My nephew couldn't get enough of it and my brother-in-law said as he was putting a big piece in his mouth, "I don't eat pork, but this stuff is delicious!"

Like someone else said, this sounded strange, but I was looking for some new ideas for pork tenderloin.  We loved this!  My pork was just over 2.5lbs, so I doubled the dressing (I used Ken's Rusian Dressing) and the onion soup, but based on other's ideas, I did not double the honey.  I served with Cowboy Mashed Potatoes from this website.  The sause from the pork was good on them, too!

This DOES taste even better the next day! Although it's not my favourite pork tenderloin recipe, it was very quick and easy and full of flavour. Both kids devoured it. I reduced the honey to 1/2 cup and found it to be plenty, but I do think that the honey is necessary to keep a good, thick consistency in the sauce while the meat is cooking. I'll make it again sometime, whenever I've forgotten to take the time to marinate the tenderloin as required by many other recipes.

I made this last night and the whole family loved it! my 2 youngest, 2yrs and 4yrs had seconds. I didn't have any store bought russian dressing so I made my own.  I didn't measure the honey and I think I put in too much, it was really sweet, but it still was great!

This was very simple and tasty.  I've made many recipes from this website and this was probably in the top 3.

Easy and full of flavor.   The sweet sauce goes wonderfully with the pork.  This is definately a keeper!

Perhaps I did something wrong, but this didn't turn out well for us. The combination of flavors seemed strange and a little oniony--but I did cut some of the honey as suggested, so maybe that was the problem.

This was a special recipe. My whole family loved it. We used the leftover sauce to simmer with meatballs, and they were as good as the pork. Thanks.

A good way to prepare tenderloin if you don't feel like grilling.  I served this with Orzo & Rice side dish and got rave reviews.  Even my picky husband asked for more!
