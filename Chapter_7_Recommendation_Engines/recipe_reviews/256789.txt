Really tasty and super quick to throw together. We liked it more with tortilla chips than with the bread cubes. The bread didn't seem to "hold" much of a fairly chunky dip. Definitely have some other dippers on hand if you're serving this one. It would probably be killer with Scoops or pita chips.

I wasn't sure about using gravy in a dip however this was fantastic. It tasted almost exactly like a Philly cheesesteak! I made my own loaf of Italian bread that was a little smaller than a store-bought loaf so I only needed half the recipe however I still used the full packet of mix. Next time I'll add some mustard to complete the  cheesesteak flavor.

This would also be good as a filling for a grilled cheese sandwich.

We enjoyed this dip. I found the dip slightly to salty but my brother said it wasn't.  Also dipped some slices of bell pepper that was yummy. I would definitely make this again using leftover roast.

I make a partial batch of this to fit into a rather huge roll that I happened to have at hand.  This was pretty good, but next time I would use meat from a leftover tasty roast rather than the deli meat that I purchased for this.  I'm sure that would make a lot of difference for me.  We did enjoy this as made according to the directions.  Thanks, McCormick!

We LOVE this dip, but it is SALTY!    So, the next time I made it, I searched for ways to lower the salt.  I found McCormick makes a lower sodium beef gravy mix (use it if you can find it), and  I switched to Velveeta (just cube it up and let it melt) instead of the Cheez Whiz because it's a bit less salty as well.  With those 2 changes, it made a  difference in the saltiness (although it's still a bit too salty for our taste).  We scoop it up with bread chunks so that helps cut the saltiness as well.  Next time, I may omit the gravy mix altogether and try a small amount of low sodium beef base to see if that does the trick!  I'll keep trying because the dip is delicious!  What an easy way to get your cheesesteak fix!

This was easy and a big hit! It tasted exactly like a Philly cheesesteak. I used the cut up bread for dipping but also bought Ritz Thins Cheddar Cheese crackers because it didnâ€™t seem like enough bread for the amount of bread there was.

After reading the reviews I added smoked gouda.  I also got the roast beef from a local pit beef stand.  This was great.  Everyone loved it and wanted to know how I made it.  We ate all the dip and I didn't even end up serving the main course we were so stuffed.

I made this last night for a game night.  Everyone loved it.  I made according to the directions, but I added 3/4 lb. of roast beef to make it more beefy.  Next time, I will maybe add some sauteed mushrooms, and some hot pepper rings.  This was very good.

I used jar cheddar and tortilla chips (my favorite dip side) instead of bread to serve, but otherwise, did this exactly as written--and it's delicious! Very quick to make if you skip the bread part.
