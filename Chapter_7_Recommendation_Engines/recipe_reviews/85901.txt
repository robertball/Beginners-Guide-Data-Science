I've always added tomato to my GC sandwiches... but I have to say the addition of onion and jalapeno really turned an otherwise fairly boring lunch into somwthing special!
Taste is  GREAT. I used part of a red onion, sliced into very thin rings, and added about half 
the jalapeno, already diced in the can.
I put all the extras between the 2 slices 
of cheese... seems the melted cheese helps hang on to the tomato, onion and pepper much better than putting it on top... and it's alot easier to flip that way, not to mention a bit less messy to eat. Butter is much better tasting on GC's, and I really wouldn't even TRY them with Margarine. Totally different taste, and the butter browns up so much nicer. I think I may have
   found my new fave GC right here in this recipe! Next time I'll add a bit more jalapeno! 
Thank you, PATELGURL... these GC's rock!

I've made these adult-style grilled cheese forever and LOVE them!  The only difference is that I butter the bread then dust the slices with garlic powder-perfect!

I changed this sandwich up to suit my personal tastes. I used a couple slices
of hothouse tomatoes that had been 
left to "drain" on paper towels, to remove some of the excess moisture. I used extra sharp white cheddar sliced
cheese, jarred jalapeno slices, and ringed bermuda onion. Very good sandwich.
I paired it with organic tomato soup.
It was a great change from your basic
grilled cheese.

Yummy!!! One of the best grilled cheese sandwhiches I have ever had. I don't eat white bread soI used wheat. I don't care for onions so I left them out. I used vine tomatoes and added some bacon. Oh my! I think I am going to go and make another one.Thanks for the great idea of adding the peppers.

Nice and spicy! A delicious twist on classic grilled cheese.  I used a combinaiton of green onion, Cheddar cheese and sourdough bread along with the other ingredients. This was simple to put together for lunch and it went great with soup.

My husband HATES grilled cheese, and he hates tomatoes, but he asks for these all the time! We are stationed in Okinawa where there arent always fresh jalapenos, and if there are, they are almost $2 ea and are never really spicy, so I used crafts jalapeno cheese and it works great.

This Recipe is really delicious. The onions, tomatoes and peppers takes a good ole grilled cheese sandwich and kicks it up many notches to a whole new level. The spicy peppers in the cheese gives a pepper jack like flavor and the onions leaves a nice tingly feeling on the tongue way after you have finished the sandwich. You'll never make grilled cheese the same 'ole way again  after eating this spicy grilled cheese sandwich. Thank You for posting it.

I was hesitant to make this as I'm not too big on not cooked-through vegetables, but this was absolutely amazing.  Honestly the best grilled cheese I've ever had.  I think it's important to use a thinly sliced red onion, and with it all the flavours are perfect.  I was also surprised how actually spicy the jalapenos were.  I'll definitely be making this to spice up the gluten-free bread my mother has to eat as she has a gluten intolerance and can't eat normal bread.

I never knew adding a few simple ingredients to a grilled cheese sandwich would make it taste so amazing.  This is absolutely the best grilled cheese sandwich I've had.  It is perfect as written!  Thanks for the awesome recipe that is now going to be the only way I eat grilled cheese :)

Throw out the sandwich maker! I love the simplicity of this sandwich and it's so infinitely versatile as you can sub in and out ingredients as to what's on hand. I never made toasted sandwiches because it was always a hassle to pull out the sandwich maker and this method is so easy, quick and less clean up. Bonza!

This recipe is so simple I don't know why I didn't think of it myself, but it tastes soooo good!  I cut down on some of the fat by using cooking spray instead of butter and it still tasted great.  I actually like my grilled cheese sandwiches better that way because they are less greasy.

Outstanding grilled cheese! I always add sliced ripe tomatoes to mine all the time, but the addition of the onion and jalapeno really is a wonderful, delicious change! I prefer to thinly slice the onion instead of chopping and I add an extra slice (or 2) of cheese. Can't beat this simple full flavor sandwich. Thanks for sharing, I'll make these again for sure :)

I usually put banana peppers on a grilled cheese the tang and just enough spicyness is very good.

These are sooooo good! Depending on what kind of mood I'm in, I'll sometimes omit the onion, but it's great either way. The peppers give this sandwich an awesome kick and the sweetness of the tomato with the creamy, melty cheese balances out the heat perfectly. Don't be afraid of this one...IT'S GREAT! :)

I've been doing these for years, but after moving to CO, I have gotten used to the taste of chilis.  using cheddar and adding fresh green chilis really makes the sandwich.  when I don't have tomato, I serve with cream of tomato soup or ketchup to dip in.  EXCELLENT!

Really great, I did use Velveeta instead of American cheese. The addition of jalapeños and onions was a great touch. My son and his girlfriend said they were to die for...LOL. I used red onion and sliced it really thin. I omitted the tomatoes this time because we were serving these with Jersey Tomato soup here on AR's. But sure the tomatoes would be really great along with the other ingredients.  Thanks Patelgurl.

This was a good grilled cheese but I don't think it was worth all the work of cutting up the veggies. I used pepperjack cheese. I thought it would be more spicy from the pepperjack and the jalapenos but it wasn't spicy at all. Thanks for the creative way to make a grilled cheese.

I added cilantro and used deli sliced sharp cheddar cheese instead of american.  I also used whole wheat bread.  Amazing!  Will absolutely make it again!

I agree! Better than the original. I made them for lunch and my husband actually wanted more for dinner!

This is really good!!  I changed it a tad; I used sliced sharp cheddar cheese, topped with the jalapeno slices, topped with aged swiss cheese, and then the tomato.  I didn't have any onion so had to omit that.  But wow - so good!

Best Grilled Cheese sandwich EVER.  I used a yellow onion and the flavor was perfect.  The jalepeno is not too hot if you remove the seeds.  The tomato fits in nicely.  I also sprinkled a little bit of monterey cheese shreds on top of the onions.  Served on wheat bread.  Cooked it on medium heat for 3-5 mins each side.

Oh. My gosh.  This was incredible.  I didn't think that tomatoes, japalenos and onion would make SUCH a difference on a regular ol' grilled cheese.  I used 2 slices of pepper jack cheese (just personal preference) and put the veggies in between.  I only had jalapenos in a jar so I used a few slices.  At first I didn't think the onion would be all that great on it, but WOW.  So good.  I don't think I will ever make a grilled cheese any other way.  I want to go make another. And another.  I'm still in awe.

Didn't have jalapenos so I couldn't add them... I know that this took the whole "spicy" feature away from this recipe, but the tomatoes and onions are amazing! And I'm sure the jalepenos would only add to the great taste. I also added a few slices of salami and it tasted awesome with it.

The best grilled cheese ever! The recipe is very versatile. One of my favorite variants is to leave out the peppers (can't handle them) and add some thinly sliced fresh basil.

Different. Not quite to my liking though. I didn't care for the green taste of the jalapeno or the onion flavor on this. I left the tomato off since I do not like them. I thought it might have a nacho flavor but it didn't. I guess I am a grilled cheese purist because I only liked the bread and cheese on this one. Thanks though as I know my family would like this one.

Oh my goodness, sooo good!! Thought about cooking the veggies before hand, so glad I didn't. Only one change was too use two slices of cheese. I will try this again with different cheeses (probably tomorrow). Had to try this one because these are three of my favorite veggies.

Modified the vegetables that were added to my liking and even tried to put ham in the sandwich.  Turned out excellent and deliciously spicy.  I will definitely be making this again!

Normally I do not rate a recipe if I make a change (pet peeve of mine) but I figure everyone is just gonna use whatever cheese they like anyway soooooooo I hate American cheese and used mozzarella instead. I think it is a great sandwich. Very tasty, I expected it to be good but not 5 stars good. I will make this very often. Will probably try different cheeses too, I think provalone or mild/medium chedder or colby would all be good. great way to sneak healthy food (tomato and peppers) into food my kids like which is another +. Thank you for the recipe!

Have made these before using Pepper Jack Cheese. These are a staple in our home. Also instead of using butter I use Mayo as it spreads easier. What a great sandwich. Nothing like comfort food kicked up a notch.

Superb!  Family loved it.  Had only two slices of American cheese, so I only made two sandwiches with Amercian cheese - the rest with shredded cheddar.  The cheddar tasted great too!

I don't like jalapenos so I made this for husband with peppers from a jar. He really enjoyed it but said it could have done with a little more cheese (although this may well have been because I used homemade bread quite thickly sliced). I'll be making this again. Thanks!

I know what you're thinking "a recipe for grilled cheese?" That's what I thought but tried it. It was wonderful! My 13 yr old said it was the best sandwich EVER! I fixed it exactly as stated. Butter does taste better. Next time I'll try using pepperjack cheese and adding garlic powder to my buttered bread like other reviewers said. If you don't have fresh tomatoes, use canned diced tomatoes. I always keep that in stock.

Made this for the first time yesterday (paired it with a homemade tomato soup).  It was absolutely amazing.  My husband and I have BOTH eaten another one today.  It's so easy and so delicious.  (I used two slices of white american cheese - tucked the onion, jalapeno, and tomato between them.)  If I could give over 5 stars I would.

Very good grilled cheese!  I usually don't give reviews anymore because I'm seriously guilty of altering recipes to my taste and I don't think its fair to give a review unless the recipe is followed per instructions.  Ok with that said, I made this last night for my dinner and I loved it.  I will probably never make a regular grilled cheese again.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

These were a little too spicy for me. Hubby loves spice so he thought they were delicious. I just added onion and tomato to mine. I did not grill these on the stove, but baked open face in the oven.

These are awesome. All the veggies added to an old favorite are great. I used sliced black olives in addition to the onions, tomatos and jalapeno and they turned out great.

Boy I've been on a grilled cheese kick lately, I just can't seem to get enough of them. This version is perfect if you're looking to kick up the heat levels. Instead of chopping the peppers, I just cut slices of jalapeno. The heat was a bit more intense, so maybe I will dice them next time. Great grilled cheese version, PATELGURL.

Very good, extremely simple and quick. Made with mozarella instead of american cheese, works just as well.

my take on this sandwich is using seedless rye bread, sharp cheddar cheese, minced green onion and chopped (seeded)tomato. Shake a little garlic salt and dried oregano over tomato.

Do not underestimate the simplicity of this recipe. I have always put tomato on my grilled cheese sandwiches but the addition of the jalapeño and onion just kicked it up to make one great sandwich. I must confess I had one for lunch and it was so good I made another for dinner. Thanks for the great idea!

I add "real" cheese, and pumpernickel or rye bread rather than the white stuff.   Love the addition of the onion and tomato and would cut back a bit on the jalapeno

Although I would have probably preferred my onions and peppers to have been sauteed first (they were pretty crunchy), it didn't bother me to much.  Easy and tasty!

This was really good, and a welcome change to the same old same old grilled cheese. I popped on AR to see if I could find a recipe for tomatoes because I couldn't remember if they were a good addition to GC sandwiches and I found this recipe. I used thinly sliced red onion and fresh red pepper slivers because it was all I had on hand. I don't typically use jalapeno because it's too spicy hot for me, so I don't have it on hand. If anything, I thought the onion was slightly overpowering. I'll definitely make this sandwich again.

I used sourdough bread and no onion. Very good, but watch the hotness of your jalapenos! Mine were very hot! Will make again.

Great sandwich! I've made this version a few times as well as one with the addition of bacon and avocado. Both are VERY yummy. The only difference is I leave the onion in rings instead of chopping it.

Nice variation to a plain ol'grilled cheese.  I omitted the onion, used jar jalepenos, and two slices of cheese (as suggested by another to help hold everthing in the sandwich).  Thanks for the recipe idea!

It was sooo spicy and I usually love my food spicy. I just didn't like it all that much. Next time I'll just try it with the Jalapenos from the jar the pickled ones.

This sandwich is delicious! I'm glad I came across this recipe because I never would have thought to make a grilled cheese sandwich this way otherwise! I also used jarred jalapeno slices in place of the fresh pepper - spicy!

Ok, I had to review this recipe to tell you about how hubby likes this made. He likes it with monterey jack pepper cheese plus jalapeno's - can you believe it? Wowee! I like the mild banana pepper rings and that is about as hot as I can go. Thanks!

Ok so I had one slice of cheese left and was skeptical- switched out the jalapeños for serranos and the onions for shallots. (Minimal amounts because, again, only had one slice of cheese.) It was soooo good! I was incredibly surprised and impressed! Thank you!

I used all the same ingredients but I did substitute quantities of the same to suit me.  I used 2 slices of thin sliced American Cheese, 4 slices of Toasting Bread (the $5. dollar loaf stuff, it's a more solid grilling kind of bread, doesn't smash down to nothing), I Roma Tomato ( chopped well and put on a paper towel till used),  just 2 TBS minced Onion and I small Jalapeño seeded and minced (not chopped).  I followed the cooking instructions to a T.    Delish!!!! The best Grilled Cheese Sandwich ever!

I was surprised at how delicious this came out! I used a 10-grain bread and omitted the tomato this time. I used chopped pickled hot and sweet jalapenos with the onions. Never would have thought to add these ingredients. I also followed a reviewer's suggestion of sprinkling garlic powder over the buttered bread. It all surely gave a flavor boost to a standard grilled cheese! Will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe!

The jalapenos , tomato and onion change  a grilled cheese into something very exciting.

This sandwich was delicious!!  My daughter and I are vegan so we used Daiya Cheddar style vegan cheese slices.  I used Nature's Balance butter-like spread (it's really good) and sprinkled a little garlic powder on the buttered bread.  I used regular tomato slices (thin)  but I drained the pulp and moisture by placing tomato slices on paper towel.  I used white onion because it's milder and pickled jalapeño slices and chopped onion and jalapeños into small pieces.  Using two slices of cheddar helps keep all the stuff inside because the cheese melts everything together.  Wait until you make this!  You are going to make this a regular!!

First time: Whole wheat, swiss and green pepper instead of the jalapeno.

Second time: same as the first except with banana pepper and a second slice of cheese on the other slice of bread (really helped keep all those veggies in the sandwich).

Wow! My grilled cheese just became an adult! I loved the crunch and flavors of this idea. I did use sharp cheese that I had on hand. YUM!!

This recipe is amazing! Hands down the best grilled cheese I e ever had! Only thing I did different was add garlic powder to the buttered side of each piece of bread as another user mentioned they did. I'll definitely be making this again!

excellent sandwich which coupled with rich roasted tomato soup made from our garden tomatoes was delicious. Only changes I made was to use mayo instead of butter on bread for a nice brown crisp crust and used onion rings and jalapeño thin slices that don't fall out when sandwich is flipped.  This grilled cheese sandwich cries out for the wonder bread white bread style that is so tasteless in anything but a grilled sandwich… Grew up with that as a child and can't mess with success!

pretty good, but i would maybe add extra cheese or some diced ham next time. also be sure to dice your vegetables really small, including the tomato.
