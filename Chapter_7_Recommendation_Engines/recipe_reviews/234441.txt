This recipe can get someone like me in trouble LOL!! This is about the best tasting hot fudge recipe I have ever made. I made it to a T and I couldn't have asked for a better turn out. This made roughly 2 wide mouth pints of this deliciously sinful chocolately goodness. The bad thing is about this recipe...it's not going to last long ;-) EXTREME happiness!!! TY

This recipe was really surprising. I kept it simple and instead of using chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk, I just used a prepared sauce with basically just both of those same ingredients. I then mixed in some caramel and flavored Kahlua. I scaled the recipe way down to see how it tasted. The Kahlua added just the right amount of extra flavor. I even made a really delicious one with butterscotch sauce and pumpkin spice kahlua mixed, together, yum! Great on top of whipped cream as a garnish or ice cream. ty

This sauce was good, but not excellent. If you're thinking you love Kahlua like me and think you'll taste it, you won't. When reheating it ends up being a bit runny for what I wanted. So if you need a quick fudge sauce it works fine, but I'll keep looking for a thicker sauce with a better flavor.
