Great recipe.  I added chopped pecans and served with fresh whipped cream.  A new Christmas dinner favorite.

I used gluten free bread, skim milk, and half and half, which may be why it took at least 40 extra minutes to cook. Apples never got soft like pie. I would cut them much smaller next time or use raisins instead.

My first time making bread pudding and it was a hit! Next time, I'll use tarter apples and a little more cinnamon.
