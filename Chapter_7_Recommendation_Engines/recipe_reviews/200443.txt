I mixed up the ice cream ingredients according to the recipe and put it in the ice cream maker. It just would not freeze, and we suspected that the ratio of sugar to everything else was off, which would make it harder to freeze. I ended up doubling the cream. I worried that it might make it have too little flavor, but it was still very good, and it froze very nicely after I added the extra cream.

Made this for a dinner party and did not set up at all!  Good thing my guests had a sense of humor and that we had cookies for dessert instead.  Next time will try suggestion to double cream.

Tried it and it was delicious!

I'm not a huge fan of over sweetness, so the only thing I'd recommend is use a little less sugar.

Very yummy and my family loved it. I definitely doubled the heavy cream.
