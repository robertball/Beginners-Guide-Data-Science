Turned out delicious!! BUT.. the only problem i had was in cooking the potatoes. i ended up cooking the mixture about 25-30 minutes longer than the recipe stated. Next time i'll semi-cook the potatoes first.
   I also added:
1 Tablespoon of finely chopped fresh ginger (cooked with the onions) 
1 teaspoon Cumin
1/2 teaspoon of chili powder (1 1/2 tsp total)

All of my kids (ages 3-14) ate this -- not too spicy, but very flavorful. The sauce was very thin, more like a soup, so I'll omit all or most of the water next time.  I diced the veggies pretty small, so no problem with undercooking there.  I knew chicken breast wouldn't take 20 minutes to cook, so I put in the veggies to start cooking while I chopped the chicken.  And I wrote "start rice" at the top of my recipe so I'll remember to do that next time.  :)  We ate it with naan bread.  Thanks for the recipe.  I wanted to use some coconut cream I had purchased, and this turned out great.

THANK YOU RAVEENA!  VERY GOOD!!  I also used chicken breasts.  The meat was tender, moist, and flavorful. I skipped the carrots,cut red potatoes in larger size pieces skin on and added  garden fresh beans. I also added 2 chopped Thai hot peppers with the garlic. Finished with greek yogurt. AWESOME and EASY.

Chose this because I wanted a curry and it called for veggies I wanted to clear from my fridge. Made 2x for that reason. I was surprised at the amount of chili powder, and worried it would taste like a chili, but it didn't. This was quite good! It makes a nice curried stew. We ate it over rice in a bowl. Even better the next day. Oh, added about a tablespoon of fresh ginger, and used chicken stock instead of water. (Had the stock on hand, and it needed to be used.) Coconut milk instead of coconut cream. I also ignored the final two cooking times, just bringing it to boil, and then turning down to med-low for maybe 30 minutes--until the potatoes were cooked through.

I love this recipie. I also add curry  and 3x the spices and is not too hot at all , and I double the sauce.
I like the coconut cream instead of the milk cuz it's thicker, otherwise too thin.  Freezes well too. I agree with other review good to precook potatoes a little too, unless using pressure cooker.

Very Good! 
I cooked the chicken first in 1 cup of water. then added the seasonings onions and garlic. At the end I only added the coconut milk. Put in a little bit of flour to thicken.

I made this tonight and it was very good per my husband and myself.  I made a couple of changes though.  I used ketchup instead of tomato puree because that is what I had on hand.  I also used a whole can of coconut milk instead of 1 cup of coconut cream.  Coconut cream is thicker and sweet for mixed drinks normally so I used the coconut milk.  I quartered my potatoes lengthwise and then sliced them into about 1/4 inch slices which allowed them to cook in the amount of time given in original recipe.

I think this has the potential to be a great curry. Think it might need more spices and possibly more heat. It is not easy for me to get coconut cream so I used coconut milk instead... Am sure that took some of the richness away :( overall tasty but taste and adjust the spices to your liking.

Extremely watery. Bland. Tried to make it twice now and I will not make it again.
