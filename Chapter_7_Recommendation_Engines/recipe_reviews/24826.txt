I tried this recipe for St. Patty's Day because of it's green color.  It fit perfectly in my 4cup four leaf clover gelatin mold.  I used sugar free gelatin mix and light cream cheese, but not a diet lemo-lime beverage.  No blarney, everyone loved this.  I'm sure I will continue to use it every year for our March 17th dinner.

I made it for Thanksgiving and it held up and was delicious!  Most of my family won't eat jello salad, but they like this one. It was a nice change of pace from stawberry and cherry jello salads.  It people don't like nuts you can take them out, but I liked the texture.  It is a keeper.

I eliminated the white sugar, used sugar-free jello and a juice-based soda (no sugar added), and it turned out great!  It has a wonderful taste and texture, and I'm making it again today :o)!

MYSTERY SOLVED!(I think). I simply do not see the purpose of one teaspoon of sugar in this recipe. What difference could it make? I used one tsp. UNFLAVORED GELATIN to improve the set-up. Eureka! This was the perfect firmness and kept its shape in a mold. Flavorwise, this is mildly flavored, not overly sweet or tangy, and has a bit of fizz sensation. The cream cheese does stay slightly chunky (even though I mixed it, with the CRUSHED pineapple, in my Kitchenaid) but is fine. I was extremely skeptical of adding nuts, but feel they added greatly to the flavor and texture. Last tip: BE CERTAIN that the gelatin is COMPLETELY dissolved in the hot water-- you should not hear or see ANY grains or it will not set up. To speed set-up I did put this in my freezer for one hour and then refrigerated another two. It worked perfectly. The End :)

I made this for Mother's Day and it was gone in minutes.  This is an awesome recipe, loved the fizz in your mouth when you ate it.  I have been asked to make this for Father's Day now... let's see how long it lasts this time!!

I thought this salad was wonderful, and I'm not much of a jello salad eater!  This will definitely be added to our recipe box and used often.  Extremely easy to make and sooo good!

Love it!  I don't know why other's salads have been runny.  I followed ingredient amounts, except I didn't use nuts (allergic) or mayo.  However, as another poster stated, use canned pineapple.  Fresh pineapple will make gelatin not congeal.  To get cream cheese to incorporate into the salad well:  Boil soda, add marshmallows till melted.  In a mixing bowl, whip cream cheese with mixer until soft and smooth.  Then pour in a small amount of lime mixture.  Mix.  Scrape sides of bowl.  Add more lime mixture, mix.  Repeat until all is mixed and smooth.  This really doesn't take much time. Then mix in pineapple and juice.  Then, fold in whipped topping.  Chill about an hour.  Should be slightly congealed.  Stir from bottom to top to get the pineapple that has settled to the bottom.  Then pour into the dish you want to serve it in and chill till set.  Best to make the day before.

So happy to run across this recipe! It is very similar to one my mother made for all of the holidays. I made this exactly as stated in the recipe and it was very good. Next time I will try to re-create my mother's by using cottage cheese instead of the cream cheese. Also, the lemon-lime soda does add an interesting texture, but you can use water instead for a more traditional jello. Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled the recipe to fit into my jello mold.  Made no changes to the recipe.  As others have mentioned, the gelatin was soft (even after 11 hours in the refrigerator).  No one in my family liked the taste.  We ended up throwing out the uneaten portion.  Sorry!

By the time the gelatin finally set, the cream cheese had risen to the top and made a layer that was pretty awful tasting. Not a good recipe, and I would never make it again.

This is similar to the recipe my mom used to make for every holiday dinner.  She used cottage cheese to get the lumpiness.  The method I prefer is to slowly beat the room temperature cream cheese into the gelatin so that the mixture is creamy not lumpy.

I used sugar free strawberry jello and chopped 2 peaches and a handful of strawberries.  I added the standard 8 oz pack of cream cheese and 1 cup boiling water and stirred it all together.  Then I added 8 oz of cream soda. We'll wait for it to set up and see what happens!

Great recipe!  the traditional recipe included sour cream, and a two-step process.  I like this one because you do it all in one step.  The only thing was that the pecans dropped to the bottom of the mold that I placed it in.  Other than that, it was fantastic!

We really enjoyed this "salad", though it did kind of separate once it was left out for a while.  In short--great right out of the fridge, but maybe not the best potluck fare!

I made this recipe its the closest to the one my Mom used to make, and it was perfect exactly like I remembered, I did read the comments first and added the gelatin to the hot liquid and mine firmed up just fine.

This was really quick, easy and yummy.  I love the way the cream cheese makes a base when you mold it.

Edited to add:  3 years later and my kids are still requesting this for every picnic and potluck we attend.  Great recipe.

I found this receipe quick and easy and very tasty.  I used Pineapple soda pop as I didn't have lime.  The cream cheese was something like cottage cheese throughout, I think next time I will cream the cream cheese first. I also left out the nuts.

i really liked it, but the family wasn't thrilled about the texture.  The cream cheese stayed a bit like cottage cheese.  it did lose it's shape quickly, not great for a pot luck.
