First time I made the salsa as written, it was good. I made it again with the beans on hand, which were not low-sodium and I have to say, it tasted even better. I did rinse the beans to rid them of excess salt, and it may just be me but I could tell the difference. We used it to top tacos, in quesadillas as well as a dip for chips. Also, I added just a dash of cayenne. It's now a raceday staple. Thanks for posting it.

Great salsa! I used canned diced tomatoes, and instead of tomato juice, I just used the liquid from the tomatoes, which worked well. Only regular black beans on hand, so I used those. I had to use canned corn, so I dried it very well and sort of 'roasted' it in a pan (I know it's not the same, but it worked). Everyone really enjoyed this...I will def be making it again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

It was just okay for us. Lacked seasoning. We didn't care for the tomato juice/sauce combo either.
