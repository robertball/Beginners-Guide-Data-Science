This recipe rocks! I love the idea of a dump and shake salsa. The flavor can't be beat. I didn't have cilantro paste and the only canned green chiles I had were whole serranos so I pureed some fresh cilantro and the serronos together. I also added about a 1/4 tsp of distilled vinegar. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!!
