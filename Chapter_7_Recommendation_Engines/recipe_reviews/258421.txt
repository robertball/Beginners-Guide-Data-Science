Delicious, complex flavor.  Not for those watching their sodium intake, but wonderful, smokey flavor--even after I reduced the soy sauce requirement by 50%

Use 1/8 meaurement of allthe ingredients and  bake it over a rack. Opt out puting it on top of vegies. Nice flavour. Made it 3x already.

I made it from the recipe, short on soy sauce, only 1/2 cup, and used German white wine, as I had no rice wine.  I liked it, but wife thought it was "too fishy" (not for me, though).

This is one of the best fish recipes I have ever tried. It has such flavor. I will try it with other than Pompano - I think any white fish would be great with this recipe.
