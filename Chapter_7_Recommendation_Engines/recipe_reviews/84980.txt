I think the people that are giving this a low rating are simply using the wrong type of cheese. You HAVE TO use white american cheese (not white cheddar or monterey jack). You can get Land O' Lakes sliced white american cheese in the deli and it is the only type that will melt correctly. Other than that, I use a can of jalapenos and some of the jalapeno juice and omit that butter. This is the recipe they use in Mexican restaurants...I know because I asked my favorite Mexican place and they told me the same thing. It. Is. Awesome.

I made the dip exactly as written & this dip is not edible. I gave it 3 stars because I worked on it this week & the recipe is fixable. I am a garlic lover & all my life I have said "you can never have too much garlic for me".  Well I can't say that anymore.  2 tsp of garlic powder is equivalent to 16 cloves of garlic! in 1LB of cheese?!?  >> On to the fix...
1st let me address the best cheese to use...  "Land o Lakes Extra Melt American Cheese".  This comes from the Land o Lakes Foodservice (a.k.a. restaurant) line which is sold in large quantity & not readily available at the grocery store.  I found it at a local Mexican Supermarket but I had to buy a 5LB package for $18.  That's a lot of cheese!  Also key is to heat the milk & butter in your pan (no dbl broiler req'd) on low heat until hot.  Then grate the cheese & add a little bit at a time to the hot milk stirring & letting it melt slowly.  Do not be temped to turn the eye above the low setting even for a sec :o)  >>  Ok now on to the ingredient amounts that I used:  16oz Land o Lakes Extra Melt American Cheese; 1-1&1/2 cup milk depending on your thickness preference (if you want to use half & half you will need to use more); 1 TBSP butter; 1/4-1/2 cup diced jalapeno peppers with juice from a jar (adjust for your heat preference); 2 tsp cumin; 1/2 tsp garlic powder; 1/2 tsp onion powder; 1/2 tsp dried cilantro.  Use those ingredients in those quantities & you will have a 5 star rated taste-tested crowd pleaser!

I used exactly what the recipe called for - white america cheese. In fact, I could only find it in individually wrapped slices and the end result was fantastic. I will say that during the stirring and adding more milk I probably used double of what the recipe called for and added some more spices to account for that. I'm making it again this weekend and plan to be a little heavier handed with the spices to begin with since I know I'll be adding more milk than it originally called for. Either way, this is a SUPER easy and SUPER tasty white cheese dip recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

This was a nice change of pace from the usual velveeta and rotel dip.  It is a similar recipe to mexican restaurants that serve the white cheese dip.  The restaurant cheese dip isn't spicy to me, just flavorful and kid friendly, as is this dip.  It is pretty thick so I added quite a bit more milk to bring it to the consistency I prefer.  You can easily make this more spicy by adding more cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, or even subbing jalapenos for 1 or both of the green chiles however, I don't think it's necessary.

My daughter had this sauce at a restaurant recently.  I used this recipe to duplicate what she called, the best sauce ever.  After tasting this sauce, she said, "No, this is THE BEST SAUCE EVER!"  I used the Land O Lakes white american cheese and it melted perfectly.  This is now a must have on Mexican Night!

I was so excited to find a white queso recipe, it's one of my favs, but this did not do what I've had justice.  Velveeta actually makes a whie American cheese in the big blocks now (in the unref part of the grocery store) to use for this.  I halved the amount of spices, and I can't imagine adding all of it.  I would suggest doing half, and then adding more to your tastes if you are interested in making this.  I also think the Mexican place I get this at uses jalepenos, and not green chiles.  I will keep searching, as this one wasn't for me.

I just made this and used WAL-MART brand white American cheese. Don't waste your time chasing down a certain brand! It turned out great!

Very good! I did make a couple changes. Used half the recommended garlic and omited the onion because we were out. Found the white american cheese at the deli. Came out perfectly! For those having difficulties this is one of those things you can't rush. I cooked it on low (1 to 2) on my glass top, it took a good 30min to melt perfectly smooth.

this is similar to the reciepe that my family used when we owned a restaruant.  the biggest difference was that instead of using peppers we would use the juice from a small can of jalapenos.

To the reviewer mentioning the velvetta being the same thing, it is not. You need white american and the white queso velvetta is not the same thing at all. That stuff will not make this recipe even taste remotely like it is supposed to. You need to go to the cheese counter and ask for Land O Lakes white american cheese. 

This recipe is really good, though I'd start low with the spices and go up to what you think tastes right.

Well, I used yellow American cuz that's all I had, and thought I'd replace the green chilies with jalapenos. I was on the phone while putting this together, and meant to only put in 1/2 of a 4oz. can of the peppers, but ended up adding the whole thing! We really like spicy food, but that was a bit much. My BF also didn't care for all the cumin - said I should halve it next time too. I'll try this again, without the phone next time, lol.

This is a very tasty white cheese dip, I took the advice of other viewers and increased the milk to 1-1/2 cups using 2% milk to save a little bit on calories. :) I also used about 1/2 cup of diced jalapeño & 1/2 cup of  juice from the jar.  I used 1 can 4 oz of diced green chiles,1-1/2 teaspoons of cumin and followed the rest of the recipe as written. It was wonderful, I plan on using it on top of my tacos for tomorrow's dinner a.ong with lettuce & diced tomatoes, slice of avocado  too ! Cooked on low heat stirring consistently until cheese was melted at the last minute threw in a handful of fresh chopped cilantro because I had it on hand for Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce ( on this web site)  for the viewers who love Cilantro this is a great recipe also. So Thank You Leah ! The recipe that you shared is wonderful ! If you haven't tried Amy's sauce please do it is awesome !

Excellent.  I used Velveeta Queso Blanco in the one pound block and it tasted just like what I get in the Mexican restaurants.  I only used 1 can of chilies and left out the crushed red peppers simply because we don't care for the heat

There are restaurants I go to only because I love their queso and I've never been able to replicate the creamy spicy dip. Who knew it was so easy! I used the grocery store brand of American cheese and it was perfect. Thanks for this great treat!

Where do i begin? Wow weee what a great recipe. Just what i have been looking for. My only issue (which is minor) is the cheese thickens/cools up way too fast. So i found myself reheating when we went back for seconds...and thirds :) Thank you so much for the recipe!

First of all let me say that I modify almost every recipe that I come across. I think everyone prefers things seasoned differently so I never blindly throw spices in a dish.

I used Boar's Head white american cheese. I asked the deli counter to give me chunks and I shredded it at home. I used 1/2 cup of half and half instead of milk. I used almost 1/2 of a jar of pickled, diced jalapenos instead of green chiles. And the seasonings I sort of eyeballed.

The directions to make the dip are spot on. Keep your burner on low, gradually stir in cheese to milk/butter. I wisked the entire time. Adding jalapeno juice from the jar or extra half and half will loosen the consistency if it is too thick.

This was a definite crowd pleaser. I would make this again. It tastes better than what you get in the Mexican restaurants.

Good. I started out using 1/2 teaspoon of all the spices, and that was plenty for our taste. I can't imagine using all 2 teaspoons! I ended up using about 3/4 cup milk. It was still pretty thick. I only used 1 4 oz. can of green chilies. Anyway, my daughter requested this and said it was just as good as what she was craving from the mexican food restaurant.

Too much garlic. A more simple recipe of cheese, milk and green chiles would have been better received I think. My son liked it though.

We love this dip.  We only use one can of chilies and 1 1/2 tsp of cumin, but it still has great flavor and is so yummy.  We've always been a fun of white cheese dip from Mexican restaurants, and we're glad to be able to make it at home now.

Awesome!	IF & only IF you use the ' land o lakes' american white cheese, just other day I found a velveeta that was 'queso blanco' a white cheese it worked great too. Hopefully it stays on shelfs easier to get for me, as the store I like going to doesnt carry the land o lakes in deli section. Top this with green onions & it rocks, thanks for the recipe!

This was really good! I made this sauce and put it on top of "Chicken Chimichangas with Sour Cream Sauce". I replaced their sour cream sauce with this white sauce and OMG, it was better than Hacienda's! Great job and great recipe! i only have one question, how do you stop the cheese from hardening so fast???

So good, exactly like the sauce at my favorite Mexican restaurant!  I put this over burritos and make mexican rice for a side.  A great meal that I don't need to go out for.

The cheese sauce was fabulous! My daughter and I truly loved it.  I used half and half instead of milk. I used the leftovers the next day to put in and on top of an omelet.  One of the best omelets I ever had.  Thanks for the recipe.

I purchased my American cheese at the deli.  They cut it in 2 big sliced chunks so it was easy to cube.  To avoid lumpy dip, melt the butter first, add a little milk, slowly add cheese allowing it to melt.  As cheese begins to melt, add more cheese and milk accordingly.  I also doubled the milk.  I used the same measurements for spices but I'll also say that with cheese dip & many other recipes, you have to add those to your taste.  Garlic may be too much for some & not enough for others.  That includes the milk as well.  Add milk to your desired consistency.   I thought it was an excellent guide to making white cheese dip.

Let me start by saying that I live in an area where the closest thing we have to authentic Mexican cuisine is our local Tequilas Restaurant. One of my favorite things there is Nachos Fajitas Beef. This dish includes a white cheese sauce I absolutely love. I have wanted to try recreating the sauce for some time now. I recently started using all recipes.com, and I have found many excellent recipies! I came across this recipe for the cheese sauce/dip and decided I would give it a try. I truly do like how it turned out! I used land o' lakes white american cheese (purchased at walmart) and it melted perfectly. I made two variations from the recipe. The first being that I could not find green chilies, so I substituted a 7oz. can of pickled jalapeños diced, and 1oz. of juice from same can. The heat level was perfect for my tastes. Secondly, I used about 1 1/2 cups milk as the dip was too thick to suit me. The end result was excellent!

Excellent! Just like the mexican restaurants I have been going to since I was a kid. I have been trying to find a cheese dip recipe that doesn't clump up for 25 years and this is the only one that works. Keep adding milk slowly until you get your desired consistency. I use jared jalapeno peppers (about half the jar for super spicy).

I used the land o lakes cheese from the deli and it melted real good.  I thought it was too garlicky for my taste. I would use less garlic next time.  My son really liked it.

I saw other people cut the seasonings in half so I did the same and there was still too much seasoning in this! I had to throw away the first batch and make it twice. The second time I just used american cheese, milk, butter, and added jalapenos and it tasted great. As tweaked I would give it 5 stars.

Followed the recipe almost exactly.  I just diluted the recipe with a little extra milk at the end because I thought it was a little too cheesy.  It was addicting...not quite like the kind you'll find in a Mexican restaurant...nonetheless very good.

I should have read all of the reviews before making this recipe.  I followed the directions and regret adding all of the spices.  Way too much garlic.  I think with some modifications I will use the recipe again.

We don't eat peppers of any kind, so I used some jalepeno juice instead. I also had to use packaged cheese slices but I couldn't tell that it made a difference. Nice alternative to regular nachos, but I didn't think it tasted much like the ones from the Mexican restaurant. We will make this again.

SO Yummy Just like the restraunt back home! I let the cheese come to room temperature, then popped it all in the microwave stirring every half minute, then I put it all in the blender because I dont like the chunks of chili's then heated it up some more and it was perfect!

This was very salty, but I think that was due to the cheese I used.  Overall, pretty good, but still not quite like the dip I was trying to re-create from the restaurant.

I use deli white American cheese. Sometimes I just buy a chunk and cube it at home.  Had a few slices of Colby jack that I added also. I didn’t have onion powder so I used 1/2 tsp. onion salt. A few tbs. chopped onion and a couple green onions. Put in my small crockpot. I might recommend adding milk towards the end of melting as needed.

We love this recipe!  It is very much like the restaurant version. We use yellow American that I buy from the deli in a block-no need to unwrap slices! I’ve used Boar’s Head and Publix brand and both were successful.

I loved this dip when I first made it. Since then, I substituted one of the cans of Green Chiles for a can of Ro*tel Original. I browned 1/2 pound of Ground Beef and 1/2 pound of Hot Breakfast Sausage together and added them to the mix. I made the recipe in a 12" non-stick skillet.

I did not go into this expecting it to be as good as my local Mexican restaurant. The restaurant near me is superb and serves some less common dishes. 
For a make at home, I am craving cheese dip or need white cheese, this suits the bill for me. Only change was less garlic and more heat. As for people who diss a recipe then post 'their' COMPLETE different recipe and claim it five star, go post your own and deal with your own negative reviews. Give your opinion and state you are posting your own recipe. Putting something out there for critique is hard. Stop being a coat tailer. 
Follow the directions and season to taste and this is very good and easy!

It tastes nothing like restaurant-style white cheese dip. I'm sure white American cheese was the way to go, but the cumin makes it taste like cool ranch Dorritos and the green chilles and cayenne don't positively add to the taste.

I made this for the Superbowl and several people loved it and others could leave it. I thought it had too much cumin. Next time I will cut back on the spices and see how it is with just the melted cheese and add spices a little at a time.

I have made it with and without the addition of the cumin and green chilies, I personally like this without them. Have to add more milk to get a good consistency. Good recipe.

With a few changes this is a solid 5 star recipe that we really enjoyed!  The ingredients are right but the amounts are definitely off from any white queso sauce I've ever had.  Thankfully I didn't dump all of the spices in at first so I had some room to play.  I used white Velveeta and I doubled the amount of cheese called for because initially this resulted in a very thin sauce and I wanted to be able to use it to dip chips in.  I used the full amount of milk, butter, and chiles called for.  I only used 1/2 tsp each of cumin, garlic powder, and onion powder and 1/8 tsp of cayenne.  We LOVED this sauce after those changes were made!  Will definitely be making this again and again!

This doesn't taste anything like the Mexican white sauce in restaurants, but it is good.  My family liked this with tortilla chips, salsa, and sour cream as a snack.  I halved the recipe but ended up using over 1/2 cup milk after thinning it out, because it does get very thick the longer it simmers.  I used dried chopped onion flakes instead of powder because that's all I had, and it was fine.  I got the White American Cheese from the Kroger deli, freshly sliced.

I did like this one!   The easiest part is all at one time, all in one pot.    It was good.  Just a quick dip for some chips was all I wanted.

I used Mexican Cheeses from the Mexican food section so it was a little lumpy but fantastic! I followed the advice on here about using 1/2 the garlic, onion powder, and cumin and that was perfect. I did substitute a couple of pinches of Chipotle chile powder and Ancho chile powder instead of cayenne, much better flavor. Was great over chicken enchiladas, I will try it on seafood enchiladas next. -Tim J. Carlsbad, CA

FINALLY!!!! I've been trying for SO long to make this like my fav Mexican restaurant!!! You MUST, MUST use white American cheese! White American is NOT Monterrey Jack as I once thought it was...it is the processed kind of cheese. You can get the Land 'o Lakes brand at the deli counter, OR you can get the sliced pre-packaged cheese which I found just next to the regular American cheese slices. It is much cheaper to just to the slices in my experience. Instead of cayenne pepper, I just used a tsp. of chili powder and it was perfect. LOVE THIS! If you're using it for a sauce as opposed to a dip, you'll definitely want to thin it out with a little more milk. I put this over Chicken Flautas from this website...SO YUMMY!!!

We recently moved to Sicily and were looking for a queso dip that was similar to our favorite Mexican restaurant back in the states and this is it! Absolutely amazing! The secret to this is the cheese you use...if you use the wrong cheese it won't melt right and the whole thing will be terrible (used pepper jack the first time, not a good idea). I also make this in my fondue pot not on the stove and I make sure to pour in the butter and milk and cook until the butter is melted before I add in the cheese. Other than that I follow the recipe exactly and it is great every time! :)

Close, but no cigar. It's a good enough dip on its own, but no match for the kind found in restaurants. You will not find an exact recipe for the restaurant-style dip because the restaurants use a special kind of processed cheese purchased in bulk and melted for dipping with a few ingredients added. (This cheese is packaged for restaurants and, in my travels, has not been made available to the public.) This is satisfactorily close, however.

I'm so glad to have found a cheese sauce recipe that turns out smooth and creamy instead of lumpy.  However, the next time we make it, we will stop adding ingredients after the chilies.  All the powdered spices just make it smelly and over-the-top.

I put 1/2 the amount of garlic in it and it was too much.  Four people ate it - all 4 said NO GARLIC.  Other than that I would go ahead and add a little more milk to thin a bit.  We added jalapenos too.

My husband liked this, but I didn't really care for it.  I think it had kind of a smoky flavor to it.  I have had other white cheese dips at restaurants that I like a lot better.

Not quite as good as the restaurants, but pretty good for homemade!  Next time I'm going to do just one thing of green chiles (I don't like it too spicy), and less garlic powder and more milk.

Worked/tasted great!! I was a little concerned when my grocery store only had reduced fat white american (Land of Lakes- @Deli counter). It melted perfectly, I even used skim milk and skipped the butter. I didn't use the suggested seasonings, I used a drained can of rotel instead. Delish!!

This is a great cheese sauce recipe! The cumin, garlic powder, and onion powder make all the difference.  I used a pound of velveeta and it was awesome, my boyfriend says its better than the resturant! I do use more milk though because I don't like mine as thick.

I followed the recipe without exception.  I was disappointed.  As soon as my sister tasted it she commented - "too much cumin".  If I decide to try it again I'm either cutting the cumin in half, or maybe even completely leaving it out.

Personally, i think some of these reviews are overblown.. Like, it's a recipe online, probably from a person who cooks as a hobby, and not a job. It takes like 10 minutes to do if you have everything prepared ahead of time (unlike me who took 10 minutes searching for cumin COUGH). 

The measurements are a bit wonky, but it's workable. Basically, do spices to taste, and don't dump in a pound of garlic. Add half of the recommended, taste, and then add the rest if you think it's good. It makes for a good midnight snack, seeing how quick it is to make, and how little it takes.

If you want a small idea of how i changed it, i dashed in the spices and used 2 slices of cheese. I also added tomatoes, mostly because spicy cheese goes well with them, and they add something to the dish both sightwise and tastewise. Don't use as much spice, add chillies to taste, etc.  Good recipe, would have made a second if i didn't run out of cheese.

I use this base recipe White (swiss) AMERICAN cheese, butter and garlic for many sauces/dips.  Folks see the American cheese ingredient and seem off put but it works for me and if they don't know what's in it they like it too.  Change the liquid to pinot grigio and it's fondue, beer for beer cheese - you get the idea.

To make it easier (or to take portable refills to a party) put all the ingredients in zip lock bags (enough to fill or refill your serving container), squeeze all the air out that you can and seal.  Now you can heat it up in a microwave using 30 - 15 second nukes (longer at first), between each heating cycle carefully take the bag out and gently massage (not so hard that the bag pops open)  the ingredients together to mix and equalize the temperature if the bag puffs up carefully open it and remove the steam and reseal, do this until the bag gets too hot to handle with your bare hands. 

Enjoy

I love this recipe! Was so sick of making queso with Velvetta. Didn't like the taste. This is so much better. Very easy too. I am a Texan and this is a great tex/mex recipe for queso!

I have been trying to make white queso for a month now I have used every kind of cheese known to man, Monterey Jack, Colby jack, pepper jack, Gouda, you name it I tried it only to get either a big clump or gritty cheese. FINALLY A SUCCESS! I got a hunk of white American from the deli. I used boarshead brand. I followed the recipe with a few adjustments I didn’t have cumin, only 1/2 teaspoon of garlic, chopped jalapeños with some juice and more milk. THIS IS SO GOOD. Perfect texture great flavor. Finally a cheese dip recipe that works!!!

Too much green chilies, cumin, garlic and onion powder.  I'll leave out the chilies, onion pwder  and reduce to 1 teaspoon cumin and garlic.  I added a pinch of Ancho chili powder.

I thought it was a little heavy on the garlic powder and a little light on the chiles.  I wanted it chunkier and more chile flavor.  Otherwise it was delicious.  Better than what I get at my local Mexican restaurant.

Yum.   I made the butter, cheese, milk mixture and half the chilis at first and it was good.  Then I added a dash of all the spices and it was soooo yummy!  I agree with other comments, each person has to adjust the spices to their taste, you might want to start light with the spices and then add more as needed.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Exactly like what we have at our favorite Mexican restaurant!  Didn’t use the chiles due to picky eaters, but did add jalepeno juice and all the other ingredients.  It was so easy.  Must stir pretty consistently.

Quite disappointed. I made this recipe exactly as written. It's NOTHING like the white cheese sauce any Mexican restaurant I've visited. And I've eaten at dozens in multiple states. This recipe called for way too much Cumin which ruined my entire batch. I knew it the second I started stirring and noticed it didn't look right. Perhaps one teaspoon... but definitely not two.

It had to much Garlic powder in the recipe.  It was so expensive to make it and no one ate it. I would say add fresh garlic instead of powder, it was awful.

This is TheBomb.com!! Made it for my step daughter's 17th birthday party and was very nervous it would disappoint her as she is a huge Moe's queso fan. Thankfully, it was a huge hit! You have to use deli white american cheese, for sure. Our deli only had their house brand (Publix) but it was great. I only used one can of chilies and was cautious with the spice do to the varied palates in attendance. I also did it in my crockpot so had to add a little milk to keep it fluid. Overall, a huge success and gone by the next day! Will make again!

I'd always wondered what kind of cheese was used in the restaurants, now I know! I've always loved Land O' Lakes brand white American cheese for sandwiches, and it was perfect for this. I didn't use the peppers or spices, as I was eating it with already seasoned food, just the cheese, butter and milk amounts and directions (very simple). It turned out great, though some of the other reviewers are right in that a little more milk may be necessary. Even though it starts out perfectly, it thickens very quickly.

Very important to use American Cheese. The first time my wife tried to make this she used cheddar and it was a broken mess (that did taste delicious). Tried again with American and it was perfect.

It was just ok. The taste was basic. After it melted, it went back to being solid. It did not stay liquid the queso dip hardened unlike what other queso dips I've had.

I think there are to many changes to make to improve on this current recipe.  I did use the Land O' Lake American White cheese found in the deli.  I did use all ingredients as per requested amount except I omitted butter and added jalapenos instead of chiles because we like a little spice. I think there is to much in it.  I will be looking for a different recipe with less stuff in it.

The ingredients wouldn't mix together. It was clumpy, "watery", and there was way too many chilies.

It was good.  The cumin I thought was over powering and so were the peppers.  I also used block cheese and cut it into cubes.  I've made it a few times since and cut down on the cumin and added chopped jalopeno.  The first time I made this it came out really thick so I added more milk and butter the second time.

I have the same problem other people had it just separated for some reason. It actually started out like it was going to be a good dip. I tasted it and it was good (Halved the season, I would 1/4th is next time). I was just heating it up and put it into a bowl and just like that is seem like the milk and cheese was separating. I had a soup and the cheese started to get back together. 

Idk, I went to the deli and got a block of american white cheese. per the recommendation of getting the right cheese. But it didn't work.

Definitely has to be american cheese- it melts in under a minute! I added a chopped jalapeno instead of the green chilis and used more milk than was called for to make it more of a pour-over sauce for burrito bowls. Great recipe!

This is exactly like the queso I have eaten in many Mexican/Tex-Mex restaurants. But, I like the control I have with the ingredients I usually cut the butter to 1/2 Tbsp, add some sriracha to make it spicier, and add some milk to make it thinner (this recipe does get thick very quickly after taking it off the heat).  I agree with the reviews to use deli white American cheese but I have used Velveeta's Queso Blanco with decent success.  It is not as good as the deli cheese but is 1/2 the price in our market. I have also subbed the plain green chilies for Rotel with green chilies, which works very nicely.  With this dip, you have lots of options!

When my little brother asked me to make his favorite Mexican restaurant cheese dip for his birthday, this is the recipe I chose. It turned out even better than the restaurant, which I always found a little runny). My brother loved it so much he made me promise to make it again.

I have been making this recipe for years I just forget to review it.  I make it AS IS and it is incredible. We hardly ever have any left and if we do its a fight to see who gets the left overs! BTW You have to go to the deli and get a pound of white american cheese, you probably wont ever find it in the "Cheese isle".

This recipe is delicious! Have your deli cut a pound of White American cheese, the slices melt easy and make a smooth dip! It would be hard to mess this recipe up.

I don't know why people had issues with this recipe. My husband wanted to
Make a quasedea burger and wanted the sauce they serve at Mexican restaurants. I found this recipe, got a few ingredients I did not have and threw it together like it says to do. I used yellow American cheese not individually wrapped and I only made 1/4 of the recipe, since I did not need much. It was awesome!!

I did not care for the flavor.  i was really hoping it was going to be like what i get from our local restaurants and IT. IS. NOT.!!!  i know they don't use cumin, and i know they don't use green chilis or cayenne.  PLUS something vital was missing that makes their's awesome.

Very good, added 1 pkg of  Mexican Melting cheese along with the White American (I did have to use the individual wrapped cheese)...used 1 can of diced chiles and 1 can of diced jalapenos. Added some juice from a jar of pickled Jalapenos for some extra bite. Used a bit of salt and pepper to taste. Heated in a small crock pot.

Oh my gosh!  I signed up for an account just so I could post on this recipe.  GREAT.  I did need to add a little more milk as I didn't want it quite that thick, but all the other measurements are perfect.  Please remember to heat the milk and butter first, LOW heat, never more than low heat, and add the cheese little at a time letting it melt before adding more.  It takes time.  Shredding the cheese instead of cubing it makes it melt better in my opinion.  And you really do need to use Land O Lakes white American cheese from your deli. If you've ever made fondue, you know how to slowly melt the cheese.  This tastes awesome.  love it.

This is really good! I just finished making it a day ahead of my party. I am planning on warming it slowly in a mini-slow cooker. I did not measure my milk so it is a little thin - I am planning on adding more cheese to thicken it more. I will also add some Rotel tomatoes and chilis when I reheat. Getting the right cheese makes all the difference! I purchased my white American cheese at the deli counter in Kroger sliced in 1/2 inch pieces for cubing. this is WAY better than Velveeta dip or the queso blanco in a jar.

Pretty good, I burnt the bottom because I was trying to go too fast and do too many things at the same time but good flavor. Will make again. Caution it cooks quickly!

I've used this recipe many times and it's always great.  I like my sauce like they make it in the midwest Tex-Mex cafes.  I leave out the garlic and onion powders.  On occasion, I may add a small amount of cumin or cayenne, but not as much as the recipe calls for.  White american is hard to find in the midwest but no other cheese will work.  I first found it at H-E-B grocery stores in south Texas (San antonio and the Rio Grande valley).  I'm asking my Kroger manager to find it and stock it.

Made this for a Super Bowl party tonight and it was fabulous! It tastes even better than our favorite store-bought dip we get in the deli. Wasn't sure how well the cheese would melt, but it did fine. I didn't have any cumin at home and it just didn't taste right, so I added some when we got to the party and it was perfect...cumin is a MUST!! We used it as a dip for tortilla chips but I'm sure it would be a great sauce over burritos, chicken enchiladas, etc. Rivals any I've eaten in restaurants!

Very good and tasty - I served it to my guests Saturday night and they couldn't get enough of it. Sooo good, as is.
