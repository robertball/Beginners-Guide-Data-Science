I made this instead of mashed potatoes and it was absolutely delicious. It has a nice, delicate flavor. So easy to make, too.

My family is from Ireland and I grew up with this recipe. As kids we used to call it Carsnips and Parrots. This combo is great in a soup too.

This was great, I did not blend it though (I was wanted texture to the dish) so I hand mashed the veggies and it was a super side dish that was lighter than mashed potatoes and a nice change from plain carrots-thanks for the recipe, will include it in the rotation.

We LOVED this recipe.  The only change I made was to add about 1 Tbsp of real maple syrup when I was blending..apart from that, I kept it the same.  It was absolutely delish!

I only used carrots in this (I had some left over that I wanted to use up) and they still turned out great.  It's so simple, but much better tasting and more interesting than just boiling carrots. I think I will try a little less butter next time. Will definitely make this again.

Great flavor in this dish. I added 2 pinches of brown sugar, a dribble of maple syrup and topped of with a few dashes of cinnamon for extra flavor! Yummy.......

I needed an excuse to use my new food processor I got for Christmas and didn't even know what a parsnip was, but i found its very close to the texture and shape of a carrot which made them blend together perfectly.  It doesn't taste like anything else, it is very unique. I added extra butter and a pinch of sugar which helped to blend the flavors.  I loved it!!  My fiancee, however described it as "interesting" and did not ask for seconds. I guess it's not for people who are opposed to new tastes.

Really good!  My husband loved it, a new way to eat parsnips.  I loved it because the sweetness of the carrots covered the flavor of the parsnips for me!

I am not really a root vegetable fan, but these were really good. A nice blend of flavors, and simple to make. The family liked them.

This was such a tasty side dish!!!  Wow, I never expected to so thoroughly enjoy whipped carrots and parsnips!!!  It took longer to peel the veggies than to cook them and whip them, but it was totally worth it!   The only changes I made was I added a bit of paprika and nutmeg, everything else was as is and completely awesome!!!!

I make something similar to this called a "parsnip puff". The extra steps I take make it so much tastier! After parboiling the carrots and parsnips together, mash them with a blender, stir in a 1/2 cup diced onions, 2 eggs, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour mixture into a casserole dish, sprinkle nutmeg on the top and bake until a knife stuck in center comes out clean approximately 25-30 mins. It tastes awesome!

A wonderful substitute or even addition to sweet potatoes or mashed potatoes.  Very easy and very tasty!  I'll definitely be making this for our next Thanksgiving dinner.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Love the taste of this, and it won over my picky hubby.  The only thing I didn't do was put it in the processor.. I wish I would have.  I just used a potato masher and it left some strings from the parsnips.  I will make this again!!

I just wanted to try this, it sounded very different, but, in a good way. We were not disappointed with the taste. Good idea with a tasty ending. Next time I make it, I will increase the amt of nutmeg, S & P.

These were just excellent.  The nutmeg was just the right amount.  I prefer a blender over a food processors and reserved some of the water used to steam the veggies (approx 1/2 cup).  Next time will try with olive oil for my vegan friend.

My husband is not usually a fan of parsnips, but he rated this a 4/5!  I switched that ratio so there were more carrots than parsnips, used white pepper, and added a little maple syrup, as suggested by others, but not so much to make the dish sweet.  This was a nice change over mashed potatoes!

Absolutely delicious. I used olive oil and Smart Balance because it was what I had on hand, and it turned out so good. I also didn't blend completely to leave a bit of texture.

I thought this was a great way to introduce parsnips into my preschooler's diet. However, he's suspicious of things he can't identify (so is my DH!) It didn't go over very well with them, but I enjoyed it. Parsnips are a little bitter, so it turns some people off. I don't mind it, and I thought it was good.

This is an excellent vegetable dish. It has a nice, light flavor... I go for seconds every time. It's a nice change from having just carrots.

I changed nothing in this recipe & made it exactly as suggested.  This is a REALLY tasty alternative to having mashed potatos.  Everyone in the family LOVED it.  Will definately make again.  Thanks Linda for this recipe!

Good flavor but it felt like I was eating baby food.

This was just ok, I think next time I would rather make some kind of glazed carrots instead.

A little bland and lacking in texture.  I added ginger and we ate it with bagel chips.  Otherwise it was good and very healthy. :)

These were ok, at best.  I probably wouldn't make them again, but I guess they're a good alternative if you're avoiding starchy food.

This was OK as a change.  I cooked the vegetables longer to soften them, substituted margarine, & used an electric mixer to whip them.  I added a little nutmeg to some at the table & preferred them without it.

I've  made this recipe countless times over the years. The trick to have the carrots cook a bit before adding the parsnips is key, I think. Mine always turn out creamy and lovely.

Made this following the recipe. Was a bit underwhelmed by the end result   Added  a bit of chimichurri spice to “zip”it up. If I was to make this again I’d add onion, chilli, etc. (My preference is more savory than sweet) and wouldn’t bother to purée, I’d just use the potato masher.

New to parsnips, we did not enjoy the flavor of this dish. The parsnips added a somewhat bitter taste and I only used half as many parsnips as it called for. My kids, who are usually very good with veggies, did not like it at all, and they absolutely love carrots.

Uhmuhgawd. These were amazing. So light, but with lots of flavor. I served them opposite a spicy hungarian goulash, and it was a huge hit. They were the perfect compliment.

Good flavor but I just couldn't get this puréed. I tried using a blender, mashing it and whipping it.
