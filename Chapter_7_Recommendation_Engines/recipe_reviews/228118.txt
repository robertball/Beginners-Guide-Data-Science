This turned out amazing. I noticed one reviewer indicated their loaf was dry - I used a full cup of orange juice and used frozen cranberries and increased the cranberries to 2 cups. My loaf was really moist and I got rave reviews at work at a pot-luck. I will definitely be making this one a lot.....I also left out the nuts because of allergies and I don't think anyone minded.

I just made this bread and it turned out great. I used 1 cup of light brown sugar instead of white. I also put whole 12oz bag of fresh cranberries without chopping them. Although fresh cranberries are tart, I think it works out great in combination with sweet bread.

This just came out of the oven, and WOW is it good.  I made a small loaf and a mini loaf.  The mini baked for 40 minutes at 350 and the small loaf was done in 50 minutes. As I baked this for a gift, for a friend who can't have nuts, I added pomegranite seeds as a substitute for a little crunch.  I also added a tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp each of ginger & vanilla.  Very yummy, moist and orangey.  I would definitely make this again.

I tried this recipe last year and thought it was too try for my taste even though hubby loved it.  I tried it again this week and it turned out wonderfully after making some changes.  I used self-rising flour and decreased the amount to 1 3/4 cups, grated 2 oranges for the zest and melted the butter rather than in chunks.  Sugar was reduced by couple table spoons.  I also lined my loaf pan with parchment paper so the edges could stay nice & moist, not overly crusty.  And a dash of cinnamon certainly helped with the lovely aroma.

Delicious! This is almost the exact recipe from the Fannie Farmer cookbook which I have used for years.  I'm glad someone posted it and I was able to read what others have done because I also increased the oj to one cup. The FF version has been my standby recipe for many years but, I always thought it could be a little more moist.  Oh, I also melted the butter and added it with the oj and egg.

Outstanding!!  Substituted 1/2 of brown sugar for a 1/2 cup of the white sugar the first time I made it as suggested in a few reviews.  Used all white sugar the next time I made it.  Both were excellent!  Not sure which I prefer so I guess I'll have to make it again. ;).  Made no other changes.  Bread was moist and wonderfully flavorful.  I originally made it to have something to go with my cranberry butter but the bread was so good by itself I forgot about the butter!  One of the top 3 quick bread recipes I've ever made.

A very good recipe! I increased the orange juice to 1 cup and added a tsp of cinnamon, but otherwise didn't change anything except that I used dried cranberries. It's moist and delicious!

This is a coarse coffee bread.  I found the flavor to be fine as written, only change I made was to increase orange juice to a scant cup.  I used dried cranberries, and did not take the time to presoak them.  I think I've become used to some of the newer coffee breads which are moister, and at first was surprised, almost thinking this bread was on the dry side.  After my second piece slathered with cream cheese, I decided it's not - it's a "coffee bread" in the old fashioned sense of the term.

I have used this recipe several times and I love it. The only thing I changed is the amount of sugar because I thought it was a little tart, I used a full cup instead of 3/4cup. My boyfriend said it tastes just like his mom used to make and my neighbors loved it for a homemade Christmas gift. The recipe also works well with mini loaf pans; it splits into three mini loaf pans per the original recipe(bake mini loafs at 325 degrees for 25-30 minutes, then bake at 5 minute increments until desired texture, checking with toothpick until it comes out clean).

I just got finished making this bread. I love the combination of orange and cranberries. The bread texture and taste was nice. I used fresh cranberries and I thought they came out a bit over tart. Next time I will use dried cranberries and see how it turns out.

Very good & moist with my tweaks...thus earning 5 stars... Used whole wheat pastry flour,  used 1/2 cup brown sugar + 1/4 cup regular white sugar,  1/2 tsp cinnamon in batter, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, used zest of entire orange and almost a full cup orange juice. Added 1/4 cup oatmeal & 1/4 cup sour cream to batter. I also softened butter well in microwave so it would mix in well.  I used my muffin top pans and before baking them I sprinkled tops with a little oatmeal tossed with sprinkle of cinnamon.  Husband loved them with his coffee this morning

UPDATE ON MY REVIEW Made French toast this morning using the cranberry bread. Soooooo good. Instead of using powdered sugar or  pancake syrup for topping, I made an orange syrup to pour over. My new favourite French toast recipe. Plan to try a bread pudding using cranberry bread. This recipe is definitely one of the best I have found on this site.

I love anything with cranberries so was most anxious to try this recipe. It did not disappoint. I changed only one thing  -- I do not like nuts in any of my foods so opted for chopped mandarins.  My mandarin tree is touching the ground from the weight of all the fruit so am looking for recipes to use them in. I used to juice and freeze them but found the juice was bitter once defrosted.  This recipe is a definite keeper.  Thank you, thank you.

Perfect holiday season recipe. On;y change I made was to increase the orange juice to 1 cup. Oh, and I used whole wheat flour. The bread was perfection. Whole family loved it. One warning: The bits of butter looked strange since they were not fully mixed into the batter. I was a little worried, but it came out great. Definitely a keeper. Thank you!

just made muffins out of this recipe and we are really enjoying them. i omitted the nuts because i don't have any and i don't think it took away from the recipe at all. i used frozen cranberries chopped in half, trader joe's organic sugar and unrefined, unbleached flour for extra fiber, followed the recipe portions exactly and they are not dry at all. the texture is great and the smell when they were baking was wonderful. they were ready in exactly 20 minutes, so not only super easy but super quick too. good to have around for a grab-and-go breakfast.

Delish!  I made muffins and baked for 20 mins at 375 like suggested. I got 18 perfect muffins. I followed the directions to the letter, except I did add a cup of OJ like some reviewers suggested. I also added the zest of an entire orange and topped each muffin with a sprinkle of sugar before baking. Perfect accompaniment to coffee.

Yummo! I did slightly increase orange juice as batter was quite stiff. I also cut up the orange I zest  and mixed it in as suggested by another writer. I used a bit larger bread glass pan and only cooked in my convection oven for 50 minutes. It is very moist and quite yummy. I will sure make it again. Maybe tomorrow :-)

This was a very tasty breakfast bread. It baked for the full 75 minutes and the top, bottom & sides turned out very well-browned & crunchy, just like we like it. Instead of chopped cranberries, we used dried cranberries that we had soaked in hot water first to plump them up.

Wasn't sure what to expect and was pleasantly surprised.  It was a tad on the dry side but no one else thought so.  I am use to a very dark banana bread recipe I have that is extremely moist so I might be biased but the flavor was excellent.  This is a keeper!

I have a cranberry orange muffin recipe I love that uses orange juice as a sweetener so I knew this would be good.  I couldn't resist giving it a little extra health value though after reading many other reviewers suggestions.  I have no doubt this recipe is delicious as is, but for those of you who might be vegan, avoiding dairy, or just want healthier in general, read on.  :)

 I added 1 cup of rolled oats and then upped the other ingredients by a 1/3ish to match.  Except the sugar which I left at 3/4 cup. I used coconut sugar instead of brown or white (I like to take a 1/4c of it and mix it in with the chopped fresh frozen cranberries while I'm putting everything else together so the cranberries absorb the sugar.) I used 1/3 cup melted coconut butter in place of real butter.  (I use Earth Balance). I used white, whole wheat baking flour.  Since I was using a denser flour and upping ingredients by 1/3, I also used 2 eggs instead of 1.  This made two beautiful loaves.  (See pics)
A tad crumbly for some but, to me, it's perfect!  Not too sweet but still a nice treat. 

Cook time was more like 45-50 minutes for 2 loaves. 

Thanks for posting!

the bread was great.  I used fresh cranberries for the first time.  They really made this recipe rock!  Added a little bit of vanilla just because I like vanilla.  For a breakfast bread or snack this recipe is worth while.

This turned out very dry. Don't know why. I used half brown sugar and half white and I added some cinnamon and vanilla. To be fair, I just moved to a high-altitude city and perhaps my baking skills aren't perfected yet. The flavor was good, though. I will try again and see if I can correct whatever I did wrong.

I like this bread, but it is very different from others I've tried. I found the texture to be really interesting - tender, yet chewy. I bet it would make amazing toast! I baked it into mini loaves for my children's lunch boxes. My son said that it tasted like a cookie and it really does, probably because of all the butter. The bread was a little too greasy because of the amount of butter, but the little air holes where the chunks of butter melted while baking were pretty cool.

This is just the BEST!!!  I've made it as is and it's very good, but I love cranberries, so I started adding one cup chopped and one cup whole to it.  Then I did the 1 cup of orange juice - and if I didn't get quite  a cup of juice from the oranges, I topped off the cup with orange liqueur.  I used all the zest of the two oranges - can one ever add too much zest?  Finally, I added a glaze of pwd sugar, orange juice (or orange liqueur) and a tablespoon of milk or so, for consistency.   I am making sure I have plenty of cranberries in the freezer this year so I can make whenever the craving comes on!  Thank you for an awesome recipe!!!  
Update: I made several loaves last week and the last one was almost a week old before cutting into it.  The flavor was sublime . . flavors had matured and the loaf was taken to the next level.   Personally, I think it needs a  glaze on it - the sweet glaze with the tangy cranberries is an absolute joy to your taste buds and the glaze looks so festive.  I will try to make a couple loaves at a time to enjoy the flavors as they mature over time.  Reminds me how fruitcake tastes better if you let it ripen.  Love this recipe.

Tastes fantastic but it's too light to be a holiday bread and it WON'T slice at all. I'm just going back to my tried and true bread. Bummer because it was a lot of work for a 77 yr old woman with much pain when standing. I am so disappointed.

This recipe is awesome! The bread is so moist! I used applesauce instead of egg because my son is allergic to egg (applesauce works as a binder, also banana) and I followed the tip to increase the orange juice. I made muffins and a loaf of bread. It was delicious!!! Also I didn't have walnuts but still great tasting :)

This recipe is good! I add a 4 ounce container of applesauce to my nut breads and then can use only 1/4 C of oil instead of butter. Low calorie/low fat. Since it is a holiday I used butter and wow is it good!

I need to make several dozen muffinns for an up coming Christmas bazaar, so I tried this.I turned this recipe into 12 delicious muffins. I did not add any nuts and they are not needed. I did not alter the recipe.  I might add a little cinnamon-sugar mixture on the top the next time, before baking.

This is one of the best recipes I have found. I have to admit to doing some things differently though. I used juice straight from an orange to reconstitute the dried Cranberries I used. I then put water over them to help them reconstitute. I just poured it all into the mixture and it worked out perfectly. I made muffins, not bread out of it also. They were moist and very good.

Tried since too dry - " I used a full cup of orange juice increased the cranberries to 2 cups."

Only problem is it falls apart too easily

Cranberry Orange Bread is an all time favorite of mine, however when I made this recipe it turned out very dry and crumbly.  I made one loaf and the baking time was way too long.  I only baked it about 50 minutes.  I followed the recipe exactly and don't know why it turned out so dry.  Maybe it needs some vegetable oil.  Very disappointed.

I was looking for a recipe that was simple.  I had cara cara oranges, and it took about 2.5 oranges to yield 1 cup of juice (which I strained).   Cara cara oranges are a bit sweeter than standard oranges.  I also melted the butter vs. adding it in chunks.  These are the only changes I made.  I actually made this recipe as muffins and it turned out really well.  Delicious tart cranberries, very moist, just sweet enough.  I actually think I could reduce to 1/2 C sugar next time, especially if I sprinkle a little turbinado sugar on top for some crunch.  This recipe is actually pretty low cal!  I just added up the calories and it's only about 105 calories per muffin.  I might try and use this recipe as a base for making something with a protein boost for a healthy breakfast.

It was pretty good. Not as good as my banana bread. I added a lemon glaze to the top of it because I felt like it needed something. It was plenty moist though, and I only used the 3/4 oj, and everything else as the recipe called for.

I  added two cup of chopped pecans and two table spoons of vanilla flavor.  I also chopped some of the cranberry in half and left the other whole.  I also shocked the cranberries in sugar for a longer period of time.   By adding the additional nuts and flavor the overall flavor of the bread was greatly enhanced.  My family loved the bread and can't wait until I back more.

Made three loaves of this bread to take to my parents for Thanksgiving. My husband, kids and I ate one loaf within a 2 hour period, it was sooooo good. The other two were eaten over Thanksgiving weekend. My dad doesn't like cranberries, but ate a lot of this bread. Mom asked me to make 8 loaves to hand out to her neighbors for Christmas. I followed the recipe except I added 1teaspoon of cinnamon and 2 tablespoons of sourcream. Amazing!!!!

Soooo good! I followed the recipe exactly minus the nuts, using fresh cranberries and freshly juiced oranges for the juice. I noticed some other reviews saying the bread was sour. This was not the case for me at all, I'm thinking due to the freshly squeezed juice versus juice from a carton or concentrate that the other reviewers may have used. Next time I think I'll go with 1.5 cups of cranberries though, because the tart against the sweet(ish) background was my favorite part! So much so that I was nabbing bites from my husband's slice that had cranberries sticking out from them. :) For the baking part, I had to cover it with foil the last 10 minutes because it was getting dark. Will definitely make again.

Easy and delicious as muffins! I creamed the butter and sugar, beat in the egg and then the oj and zest before adding in the dry ingredients. The changes I made: I opted to use whole wheat flour, folded in two tablespoons each of sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and almond chunks with the cranberries. To add more flavour I added an extra tablespoon of oj, almost doubled the zest and folded in 1.5 cups of chopped frozen cranberries.  Topped the muffins with a sprinkling of pumpkin seeds before baking. Light, fluffy, flavourful, yet healthy. Huge hit, will make again!

I followed others suggestions and added 1 tsp vanilla, and increased the OJ to one cup. Sprinkled sugar on top of the batter after spooning it into muffin pans. Baked at 375 for 20 minutes(made 12 muffins)
LOVE THIS RECIPE! Thanks for the original recipes and all the great suggestions :)

Just made this into muffins. Added extra (melted) butter and twice the orange zest cuz we like it that way.  Very yummy, will make again for holidays.

Substituted chick pea four and added 1/2c blueberries. Then I glazed them with orange juice mixed with icing sugar. So yummy and gluten free this way!

I just made muffins exactly the way the recipe was written, except I cut the butter in. They were moist and delicious. They were fast and easy to make. I will be making again. Thank you LaurasFaves for the great recipe.

I've made this recipe several times, it's really good. I prefer to make them as muffins (I baked them for 20 minutes) because it's easy to portion out. I do use 1 cup of OJ because I read the reviews and people commented it was dry. 1 cup works well for me, whether I bake it in a loaf or in the muffin tin. I also skip the grated orange zest because I never have it. It's still delicious. I reduce the butter for health reasons and even though I grease the muffin tins, it still sticks. It's never an issue for me, I'd prefer it to be healthier and just take extra care removing the muffins.

I really liked it alot!  I doubled the recipe using one 12 ounce bag of cranberries, so I have one to freeze.  I did use one cup of orange juice for each batch, added the orange zest and a little orange extract since I already had it.  Both loaves were done in 45-50 minutes using one oven.  I am wondering if reviewers thought it was dry because they overcooked it?  Sixty minutes would have been way too long in my oven.  My original recipe from a friend says "Do not over cook!!" - Marsha Smith

I followed my gut and used a more traditional way of mixing these ingredients by creaming together the (softened) butter, sugar, egg, juice and zets in my mixer.  I also followed the advice of another reviewer and added cinnamon and a little vanilla to the wet mixture. I combined all dry ingredients in a bowl and introduced them a little at a time into the wet mixture. Once combined, I folded in fresh cranberries.

This recipe turned out great, I just think the directions need to be modified.

I cut the recipe in half and substituted two heaping cups of mini marshmallows for the cream.  I also used crunchy  peanut butter.  Finally, I reduced the boiling time to 5 minutes.  Excellent recipe.  The candy was perfect.

I just made two loaves of the delicious bread.  I did make one small change however. Instead of 3/4 cup of o.j.  I put in about a 1/2 cup and then added a splash or two of orange extract and the rest of H2O. The final product was so moist.  I definitely  will be making this one again. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband loved this bread.  I used a full cup of orange juice after reading the reviews. I also made 3 small loaves in the foil disposable tins.  I baked them for 40 minutes at 350 and they are moist. Personally, I expected more orange flavor but not disappointed with the results.

OMG this was absolutely delicious!  I was right in the middle of preparing recipe when I discovered my son had polished off our orange juice.  I panic'd, but then remembered I had a small jar of mandarin oranges, so I ran them through a food processor and used in place of juice with little bits of sweet oranges mixed with the cranberries.  Thank you SO much for recipe!

I actually doubled the recipe since my family tends to blow though sweet breads, coffee cakes and the like, like there will never be anything like it available again. The only thing I altered it I added an extra 1/2 cup of cranberries (I doubled the recipe, remember, so for the recipe for the single loaf, that would be 1/4 cup extra) and I threw in an extra 3 TBSP. of orange rind. We really like the fruit component!

The only reason I gave this a 4 is because I think it would be better using unsalted butter.  Other than that, these are delicious, light, and fluffy

I am not very good at zesting oranges so I substituted a small amount of orange extract I had.  Used frozen cranberries and left them whole instead of chopping them.  Used a little more than a cup (didn't measure that exactly).  It came out yummy!  I did add an icing of powdered sugar, oramge juice, and a tad orange extract. It was super yummy and very easy!  I will definitely make it again!

Well I only had left over cranberry sauce made with orange juice and orange zest  and apples and apple pie seasoning with a touch of orange liqueur  but not much sugar. Used it for the cranberries and not as much orange juice. I guess you have to call it "cranberry sauce bread".  Turned out with red tint throughout but was very tasty with good texture too, who knew!!! thanks.

This is a great recipe!  I’ve made it twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, just adding a cup of orange juice as several people recommended.  The second time I melted the butter and added it and the beaten egg to the orange juice before adding it all to the dry ingredients.  Either way, it’s delicious and a big hit.  I made three mini-loaves with each batch.

Left out nuts due to allergy.  Did it in glass loaf pan. Mistakenly baked in 375degree oven  luckily set timer for 60 minutes it came out very dark on bottom. So I overbaked it. Saw the temp for muffins and assumed it was same.  So be aware.  Even though I overbaked it was so delicious. will be a staple for us. We really enjoyed it. The recipe said 60- 75 min . I would try next time a check at 55 min at 350

Very good recipe, with a couple changes. I did as other reviewers suggested and added 1 c sugar (I think it could've been less) with chopped dried cranberries instead of fresh. I also took a reviewer's suggestion and omitted the orange extract and instead I used my food processor to combine the cranberries and two mandarin oranges (whole, with peel) and it came out so flavorful! I also added about 1/2 c of sliced almonds and processed them in with the cranberry/mandarin mixture. One last thing, I substituted lemon yogurt for sour cream to add a little extra citrus flavor. Yah, yah, I didn't follow the recipe exactly as written, but who cares(?!) The suggestions from other reviewers improved upon an already great recipe, so I went with their suggestions. I personally hate it when other people bash reviews based on changes (improvements!) made. Get over it.

I didn't bake it as long as the directions said because I checked on it after 35 mins. And it was golden brown on top but I knew it wasn't done yet so I put it back in and checked with toothpick it came out clean! I hate this stove I had a big stove in my house with a big oven. Now I'm in a tiny apt with little dinky stove. It bakes completely different with temp and time. I have to get used to it and adjust the time and temps.

Made this recipe just as written (otherwise, if you make changes, you're not reviewing the actual recipe!) and it came out perfect.  My husband was a huge fan of everything except the walnuts (who knew he didn't like walnuts?!?!?), although, I thought they were great in the bread.  This is definitely a keeper!

I changed some things after reading some comments and comparing this recipe to other loaf breads I've done. I bumped up the 3/4 sugar to 1 cup, 3/4 tsp salt to 1 tsp, and 1/2 stick butter to 1 stick. I used frozen whole cranberries and did 2 cups instead of 1 cup. I found that 2 navel oranges provided the suggested 1 tbsp of grated rind and 3/4 cup juice, but it was obvious that the batter was too dry. I added the juice and rind of a 3rd navel orange, which I approximate was 1.5 tbsp rind and 1.25 cup juice. I also baked this at 325 degrees for 75 minutes. (I think it could actually used an additional 5 minutes or so because the very top center wasn't quite done.) I also found it sort of crumbly when I cut into it, but I suspect that might be the nature of baking with whole cranberries. After letting it cool and refrigerating it, I found it much easier to slice into and enjoy. Overall, I'm quite pleased with the flavors and would love to make this again.

I used 2 cups frozen cranberries, cut in half; 1 cup of OJ; plenty of orange zest (a whole orange's worth); and a little cinnamon.  Love this bread!  It's not a sweet dessert bread, so it's wonderful with a cup of tea.

Made this today. It came out just wonderful. moist with just the right amount of tanginess from the cranberries. Only thing I did different was add 1/2 tsp cinnamon and an extra 1/2 cup of cranberries. Is definitely a keeper.

I lost my original recipe and found this one to be pretty close to my old one. I loved it! I followed the recipe but added more walnuts and for a twist I added about 1 cup of white chocolate chips! It came out moist & pretty! I love the combination of tangy cranberries with the sweetness of the bread.

I also melted the butter, added cinnamon and a dash of Cointreau, and doubled the cranberries, really nice texture.

Why on Earth does the recipe ask for butter pieces to be used instead of the usual liquid fat {oil or melted butter}, makes no sense.

I almost put it in the oven without the sugar.  Sugar is listed in the ingredients but not in the step-by-step.  Fortunately I caught it before it was ruined.  It turned out great.

This recipe was great! I did change it a little. I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup of whole wheat flour to 3 cups white unbleached. I also substituted half a can (15 oz) of mandarin oranges for the orange juice. I made 2 loaves that baked in 45 minutes. Will make again!

This bread is a little dry.  I was hoping for WOW because I love the orange/cranberry mixture.  I wrap the breads in plastic wrap, overnight, before cutting...it was still a bit dry.  I didn't stray from the recipe at all and checked doneness.  I'll try it again.

Very similar to what my mom made every Thanksgiving. Moist and yummy with the tart cranberry and orange complementing each other. I always cut the sugar a bit and didn't have quite enough oj so used some apple juice to finish it off. Very good.

This bread is amazing! Super moist and delicious. I added an orange zest glaze (confectioners sugar, water, orange zest) to to top to kick it up a notch.

If I could give this ten negative stars, I would.   SOUR AND BITTER and does not rise.  Crust comes out almost BLACK and the in any given bite you get a big chunk of something nasty, like unmelted butter.  Huge waste of very expensive ingredients. Wish I could sue whoever did this recipe. Disgusting.

I made this in muffin form! After looking at the comments I decided to add a tablespoon of canola oil and a squeeze of honey to make it less dry and bitter. 

I also made a quick cranberry compote with the cranberries I had leftover and swirls it into the muffins before popping them in the oven, which added a pop of flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly as written except for the fact that I melted the butter and added one extra tablespoon:) I squeezed the two oranges I zested and use fresh orange juice. This bread is moist and delicious and I don’t even love the cranberry /orange combo. Definitely will make again.

I don’t understand the rave reviews.   This was fine.   But it was definitely not exceptional.    A little dry and a little bland- couldn’t taste the butter.   Based on reviews I expected holiday-worthy fare but in the end it was a nice snack and not too much more.   The kids and I had fun making it- in fact that was priceless- but taste wise it was not worth the extra steps of zesting and cutting etc. or the saturated fat from the butter.     I made one loaf for casual company to test it,planning to save the other loaf for Thanksgiving.  Guests didn’t seem wowed- there were leftovers.  My kids gobbled it up though and wanted more so that plus the quality time counts for a few stars.   I decided not to bother freezing it since I didn’t think it was exceptional and my husband agreed.  My husband  erroneously suspected I had tampered with it to make it “healthy” like I occasionally do to reduce fat and sugar.    I would like to find a recipe like Panera’s.     I think in the meantime i’ll Go back to the old pumpkin bread standby- easy always moist and festive for the holidays.I’m going to send my extra loaf in slices as a school snack and the kids will be delighted.    I’m no professional chef so there is room for error in technique, or it could  be it just wasn’t my cup of tea.

I made this and it was amazing. I made the following modifications:
1 cup of orange juice,
1 cup of chopped dried cranberries,
1/2cup sugar,
1 vanilla bean,
2 teaspoons baking powder.
1/2cup soft butter
It was SO FREAKING GOOD.

This is the perfect recipe!! A couple things I’ve adjusted over the several times I’ve made it are - leaving the cranberries whole. Also, fresh or frozen don’t seem to change it at all!
Last thing which is key, adding a course sugar on top after applying some melted butter. I still use the same amount of sugar in the mix, but I add the top layer of crunch sugar - I haven’t added to much yet, and I’d say i add a couple tablespoons on each mini tin.
Thanks for the easy great recipe!

So i changed the flour out for Pam's artisan gluten free flour and that made the baking powder and soda overwhelm the recipe if you are changing this to gluten free I would recommend reducing the baking powder and soda by half

This is the best recipe I have ever used for cranberry orange bread. I usually use a little more juice than the recipe calls for because I use fresh squeezed orange juice along with the sweeter dried cranberries. It is moist and delicious.

Lovely bread! I added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla to mine, nixed the nuts because my family is not a big fan. I used brown sugar and about a quarter cup less than what they called for. I did add in about a third of a cup of mini semi sweet morsels to mine. It had a wonderful consistency. I did not mix mine like the recipe called for, I've always mixed my wet ingredients first including sugars and dry ingredients in a separate bowl and then mixed the two. Cutting in the fruits chocolate chips and or nuts afterwards. I added in a little bit extra orange zest wine which made a wonderful Tangy orange flavor.

I made this recipe exactly as indicated except I did do a full 1 cup of orange juice since so many reviewers recommended that.. and it was amazing! Nice and moist and it is a beautiful loaf. I sprinkled a couple of chopped cranberries on top before I put in oven and it came out so pretty. It presents really well. Might make a nice gift during the holidays. I intended to add a splash of orange extract but to my dismay, my orange extract either evaporated or I used it up. There was an empty bottle in my cabinet (bummer). Honestly, this recipe doesn't need it. The orange flavor comes through nicely. I added a basic cream cheese glaze on top that really enhanced the loaf. I will definitely make this again. Soon.

INCREDIBLE!!  I doubled the recipe and got 7 mini loaves.  I cut in the butter as if I was making pastry and upped the OJ to 1 3/4 cups and added 1/4 cup of vegetable oil.  Moist and incredibly flavorful!

Awesome recipe! Just making it now, but on the advise of others, I did use 1 full cup of orange juice.  2 navel oranges equals 1 cup of juice and about 2 TB of zest.  Added it all and it smells wonderful!  Added 2 cups of halved fresh cranberries also.  I trust this will be the best bread of its kind that I've made ever!

This was good and moist, with crispy top. Instead of fresh cranberries, I streamed in the cranberry sauce I made for Thanksgiving. That made it more cake-like, but it was all good.

Excellent, tasty bread.  I followed others who said they added 1 cup of orange juice to the recipe.  This was the only change that I made.  Made mini loaves for gifts. Got four out of the recipe.  Cooked at 350 for 30 minutes and they were perfectly cooked.  Thanks for the tasty recipe.

I made the loaf as written and then again with some of the suggestions of other cooks. The original was a bit dry. The second loaf, where I decreased the flour to 1/34 cup, increased the juice (fresh squeezed) to a cup (I had to add a bit of water to make it a scant cup), and increased the cranberries to 1 1/2 cup. I liked the second loaf so much better as it was moister and had more flavor, it seemed. I will indeed be making this recipe again--but with the changes.

This recipe turned out really well. I saw some reviews about it being a little dry so I added a little bit more orange juice and about a quarter cup of Greek yogurt. Plus I used fresh cranberries and sugared them before I put them in the mix.

I use my cranberry/orange relish leftover from Thanksgiving. Since the relish had sugar in it, I cut the sugar down a bit. Use pecans instead of walnuts.

I lost my grandmother's recipe and this recipe is perfect in my opinion. I do substitute the white flour with my own mixture of several flours and it did not come out dry as sometimes happens with substitutions. This recipe is not too sweet either.

I will use this recipe from now on every year!

Wonderful recipe! I used though 1 whole bag of fresh cranberries, 3/4c sugar, 3T orange zest and their juices of 2 oranges, cooked down to 1/4c rather than the called for 3/4c.  The extra orange intense flavor with moisture of extra whole fresh cranberries is great! My family leans toward tart and intense sans fillers.  Immediately after the initial loaf was cooling in its tin, I began another loaf, this time with sourdough starter, extra pack of yeast, double the flour and identical orange/cranberry ratio as before. This time, it's a rising dough that is split between two bread tins. It's rising now... As last time, it will be wonderful!

I love anything orange and cranberry.  I read all the reviews before starting out. I Added a couple of teaspoons of sugar to the chopped frozen cranberries and orange zest. My butter wasnt soft enough, so my batter was a little dry. I added just enough buttermilk to bring It all together.  The bread was moist and just sweet enough.

I made this twice.  Instead of making it in a bread I made muffins.  The only change I made was not chopping the cranberries.  They were a big hit at the church potluck.  No leftovers!

I was 1/2 way into this recipe when I realized I had no OJ ( in fact I didn't even have any oranges ) BUT I did have some pineapple juice.  So, I used it instead.  wow   I won't ever use OJ again!  Moist sweet and tangy!  A very big hit with the family!

I made muffins instead of loaf,  cooked for about 20-22 min.   I added nutmeg and cinnamon and a smige of vanilla.  I used fresh oranges but didn't get enough juice out for a cup of juice. I think they would have been more moist if I'd used a cup.  I really liked them.   Would have done 5 stars if a bit more moist.

Delicious!! I basically made this according to the recipe, though I did swap in some brown sugar and whole wheat flour. I used freshly squeezed OJ since I only had oranges, as well as fresh frozen cranberries that I was able to chop with my Pampered Chef chopper. Didn't have walnuts so I used pecans. I made one normal size loaf (smaller than called for) and 12 mini muffins. The smaller loaf cooked for 40 minutes and the mini muffins for a little over 9 minutes. This bread is outstanding. I lament that I probably will have to share with the rest of my family :).

Very nice recipe -- one I'll return to a lot (we have a lotta local cranberries here in Oregon too). I used whole spelt and emmer flour cuz that's what I had on hand. Same with coconut oil instead of butter -- I cut it in as if making pastry and that seemed to work just fine (tho I had to add a splash of milk too loosen up the batter -- will melt it next time I think). Happened to have a bunch of nice oranges, too, so I squeezed the juice fresh (!) and probably doubled the zest out of enthusiasm alone. ;-)  Its a great breakfast!

Definitely making these again! I used a full cup of OJ, heated the juice up and soaked the dried cranberries in it. I also used 1 1/2 cups of flour and a 1/2 cup of oatmeal to add texture.

I used King Arthur's Gluten-Free Measure for Measure flour in this recipe and made mini-muffins. I think they are fantastic and my four-year-old loves them too. The texture with this GF flour produced a pleasant, chewy, scone-like texture, but with more intense flavor than a typical scone. Not rich and heavy like a banana bread or pumpkin bread, but more bright and refreshing.

I was disappointed in this bread. It was heavy and not sweet enough for my taste. I followed one of the other revier's suggestions to increase the cranberries, so that might have been the problem, but I wanted something a little sweeter.

This is a simple, tasty recipe! But I would recommend changing a few easy things:
- Melt the butter and then pour in the OJ, whisking it. Then add the egg and orange zest.
- Check after 40-50 minutes. Mine was done in less than an hour
- I used 1.5 cups of chopped cranberries and felt this worked better.

Loved these scones!  the best I ever made. The only change I added was some cinnamon in the batter and sprinkled sugar on top before they went into the over (just a personal preference for this).  Wonderful recipe!

This bread is delicious. I found fresh cranberries on sale at BJ's and decided to make this for friends' gifts for holidays. Read other reviews and I tweaked this slightly. The first batch I doubled and it made enough for 3 small disposable aluminum pans and enough left over for about 5 muffins. I cooked the 3 pans for about 55 minutes. Like others I used a full cup of OJ (2 cups for doubled recipe), 1 tsp. Cinnamon, 1 tsp. Vanilla (again for the doubled recipe; probably could have used a bit more), and I added 2 tbsp. Brown sugar because the batter didn't taste quite sweet enough. Zested the peel from one whole orange and that was just under the 2 tbsp needed for the doubled recipe. I did not double the nuts for this batch and used pecans. When finished breads just the right size for gifts. I tasted one of the muffins - FABULOUS. The second batch I used orange extract instead of orange zest. I used 1/2 of what is suggested on the label of the extract bottle because I wasn't sure if it would be too strong. Glad I did, it was plenty. With the orange extract you can still taste the orange flavor, but more subtle than the zest. However, for cost, I will stick with real orange zest in the future. Other changes I made for preference was rough chopped the cranberries in processor and melted the butter. As I said, makes very nice gift breads or muffins, and fairly easy to make. Highly recommend this recipe. With or without the tweaking I think it would taste great!

I took advice of another reviewer on here and used 1 cup of brown sugar in place of the white, and I also added a 12 oz bag of fresh cranberries, and 1 cup of orange juice. This bread is incredible!

Love this bread, delicious and can't get enough.  Loaded with cranberries and nuts. So easy to make.  I left it in a shorter time, found that 60 minutes was too dry. YUM!

Fabulous loaf!  I used a more traditional method making it and tweaked it out a bit.  Started by creaming the butter and sugar together, then added the egg, then the zest (closer to 3 TB - as much as I could get off the orange) and orange juice and a tsp of vanilla. ... Then added all the dry ingredients at once: I increased the sugar to 1 cup and the baking soda to 3/4 tsp and added 1/8 tsp of cardamom.  Stirred till just mixed and folded in the cranberries and walnuts.  I like to lay a strip of parchment paper along the bottom and long overt he ends to make for easy removal from the pan afterwards.  I'll make this again, and again.

This was delicious!  I made them into muffins (made about 9 over-filled muffins.) The only change made was the flour- I used 1.5 cups whole wheat and 1/2 cup all purpose. They were moist and were totally eaten by the next morning.

I decided to make muffins instead of the bread, largely because I didn't have a bread pan. I thought it would make a good breakfast grab-n-go item. Unfortunately, my family decided to have it at breakfast, morning snack, afternoon snack, and late night snack. All 14 muffin didn't make it past the first day. So yeah, they were very good.
I used dried cranberries because I have no idea where to get fresh ones. I also followed the advice of the other reviewers to use 1 cup of orange juice instead of 3/4 cup. Fluffy, flavorful, right amount of tartness and sweetness. I also didn't use nuts.

Great looking bread, good flavor of the bread, but not much of a fan of that many walnuts.  I plan to try again with these changes: half as many walnuts, toast walnuts first, use very, very ripe cranberries.  I used the cranberries straight from the store and they were too fresh. I would add two more tablespoons butter, as the bread seemed a bit dry.  Great toasted, but not so good plain.

I added a quarter cup water because it didn't seem to me that there was enough liquid. I hadn't read the reviews. This bread is amazing! Fragrant, flavorful and moist. I am making a triple batch right now for a bake sale. I used 1 cup orange juice instead of the 3/4 cup recommendation.

Excellent!  This has a true "quick-bread" texture and is not cake-like or oily, yet it is nicely moist.  I cut the cranberries into halves, and toasted some chopped pecans before stirring them in.  The batter was very thick and full of fruit and nuts, and baked up perfectly.  In a well-greased and floured bundt pan, it finished in about 33 minutes.  It removes easily from the pan if you loosen it and tip it out within 5 minutes out of the oven.  This bread was absolutely bursting with flavor, and I will definitely make it again. Thank you for the recipe!

Delicious! Increased to 12 servings (18 muffins), reduced sugar to about 1/5 cup. Added 1 TB vanilla extract and 1 sliced banana to make up for sugar. Chopped cranberries and walnuts in food processor. Super tasty and nice texture.

The flavor was okay, but it was too dry so I had to add more orange juice just to moisten the flour.  Although I barely mixed it, I felt it turned out a little rubbery.  I tweaked the recipe by adding about a teaspoon of cinnamon, melting the butter, reducing the orange juice to 1/3 of a cup and adding 3/4 cup of buttermilk, and then it was much better the next day.

I found basically the same recipe in one of the old, popular cookbooks. The only difference was that the butter was replaced with 2 tblsp of cooking oil (which I did). I used the baking option of 3 mini loaf pans (baked perfectly at 30 min). It also had a nice glaze of 1 cup of sifted confectioners sugar and 1-2 tblsp of orange juice. Then, top with grated orange zest. SO good and perfect with coffee on Thanksgiving morning!

Almost perfect.  It's got a great orange taste but it was a tad bit dry and I only baked it for 55 minutes.  I did add a few more cranberries, but wished I had added more orange juice too as one reviewer suggested.  Still, it's great with a cup of tea, glass of milk, or cup of coffee.

I baked it 1 hour at 350.     I did not like the flavor using whole wheat flour.   I would not make it with whole wheat flour again.

I make this every year around Christmas.
Perfect for mini loaves as well to give as gifts and people love them!
I will say the first time I made this it didn't turn out so well.
The cooking time is off so you will have to watch it and set this bread by your own standards and oven settings.

Came out great! I used pecans instead of walnuts, and frozen cranberries that I pulsed in a mini-processor.  My baking time was probably 65 minutes total - I started checking at 50 minutes.

My family loves this bread when Autumn pays a visit! I use dry cranberries, which I soak in orange juice... My 17 yr old daughter came in today after her soccer game and said the house smelled like love!!! Fantastic bread!
Also great with an orange glaze drizzled on top of the loaves!

Delicious!  Instead of a loaf, I made 12 muffins.  I used 1 cup fresh squeezed OJ and  I added   the pulp and the zest from the 2 oranges.  The rest of the recipe I followed as is. The muffins are flavourful and moist!  Will definitely make this again

Just saw that I never reviewed this cranberry bread.  I have made many cranberry breads before but, by far, this is the most outstanding.  I have made this particular recipe at least five times and it never lets me down.  It is moist and very delicious.  I've made as gifts and everyone loves it.

I would have given this 5, however,  because there is just a bit too much batter for the pants to cook evenly. Maybe 1 loaf and 2-3muffins would have worked for me. Overall flavor is excellent.

Made it with fresh frozen cranberries, fresh-squeezed oranges (1.5 oranges), brown sugar and chopped walnuts, thought it might be dry based on other reviews, but it's perfectly moist the way it is! Maybe the brown sugar made the difference? Will definitely make it again.

Did as others suggested and added 1 cup of Orange juice, half of it was freshly squeezed.  Also, I used Orange flavored dried cranberries (from Trader Joe's) approximately two thirds of a cup.  I heated the o.j. up in microwave for about 35 seconds with the cranberries in it, to moisten them up.  Last I put it into 3 mini-loaf pans and baked for 30 to 35 minutes.  On the top, I added 3 mandarin oranges, and slightly pressed them into dough. What a pretty presentation!  It tuned out  moist and delicious.

At the suggestion of others, I increased the OJ to a full cup. Let me preface by saying I didn't intend to make additional changes, but math and I are sworn enemies. Long story short, I ended up using eighteen 1/2 teaspoons of orange peel . Is that three tablespoons? I don't know because I don't math. In any case, I didn't realize the error until after mixing. I was afraid the flavor would be overwhelming, but it wasn't. Everyone loved them (made muffins). I will definitely make these again.

This recipe was great. It was super easy and quick. Tasted wonderful. I increased the orange juice to 1 cup for moisture and used dried cranberries as well as changing the sugar to 1/2 Cup regular granulated sugar and 1/4 cup of light brown sugar and it turned out absolutely perfect. A fantastic treat for the holidays.

I loved the taste - not too sweet, and a good balance of cranberry flavor (used fresh).  I took the suggestion to throw the whole orange in the blender, to get both juice and zest.  I removed the white pitch first, trying to avoid some bitterness. I think the extra pulp helps keep the bad moist. I also took the suggestion to use a cup of OJ. Otherwise, followed the recipe as-is, with great results!

I would give 4.5 stars.  I used 1 Cup fresh squeezed OJ with the pulp and decreased the sugar to about 2/3C because I used sweetened cranberries.  Next time I will decrease the sugar to 1/2C.  I also added a dollop of sour cream, since some people said the recipe was dry.  Placed it into 12 muffin tins and baked for 18 minutes.  I would make this recipe again.  It is light and the buttery.

This recipe is excellent as is. To make this a SIX star recipe, here are my changes: 1 cup of orange juice, 1/2 cup light brown sugar, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1/3 cup greek yogurt (or sour cream), 1 to 1.5 cups whole, fresh cranberries (depending on preference). Wow! Those changes make this the most moist and irresistible bread! I make it every Christmas and we eat it while we open presents on Christmas morning. Another note - cut the butter into small chunks and then mash it with your whisk into the dry ingredients (almost as if you are making pastry). This technique will result in an incredibly buttery bread!

Yum yum yum!! I increased the juice to a full cup as I thought it was a bit dry the first time. Include the walnuts, they really make a difference. I used gluten-free ingredients. This recipe is great because so many gluten free recipes call for a lot of dairy and this one doesn't. I will definitely be making this again. Tastes as great as it smells.

I was just playing around and threw all these ingredients (plus a couple spoonfuls of ground flax) into my bread machine and let it go on light crust setting...came out great! as for dry vs. moist, this recipe made a dense slightly dry loaf, which is more like a true bread and not so much like those cake-ish box mixes. this was an easy recipe for a delicious, naturally flavored,  sweet BREAD; if you want moist cake then do something different.

I am not sure if I did something wrong....I did make it in muffin instead of bread because was running low on time.  The dough was way too dense.  I love these muffins that I had from Meijer one year and I haven't been able to find a recipe that lives up to what was store bought.

I've made this twice now, once as written and once with the addition of 1/4 cup sour cream for extra moistness. Both versions were delicious and I don't think the sour cream was necessary at all. Mine was done in 55 minutes so be sure to start checking it well before 60 minutes.

I did what some suggested: 1 cup orange juice, used brown sugar, and melted 2Tbsp butter into the batter.  I also like spicy breads, so I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp clove.  I also used up a left over bag of fresh whole cranberries, 12 oz bag.  I did not add any nuts.  I also did them as muffins to cut down the baking time to 15-20 minutes so my boys can have a grab-n-go snack.  They are moist, sweet, tart, and as my 19-year-old son says, "Yummy and warm!!"   on his way out the door this morning.  Definitely a keeper recipe and it will look pretty on this Christmas Eve bread tray!!  I bet they will freeze well too!!

This is my 'go to' every year at Christmas. I made it exactly as instructed.  The secret is to just fold in everything until just combined and then bake. I always get so many comments and for the recipe. Yum!

I just made these and followed the advice of previous reviews and added 1 cup of orange juice (fresh) and a cup of brown sugar instead of white and they are delicious. Super moist and just enough sweetness. Thank you

Very good and versatile! I used part brown sugar and part almond meal. I also used a full cup of orange juice. Half w walnuts and fresh cranberries and half with raisins. I added some vanilla, cinnamon and ginger and made them as muffins. Could have added a bit more zest, but were very good!

This is a delicious breakfast bread made just like the recipe.  I did add raisins the second time - just made it a little sweeter.  My husband toasts it for breakfast.  Warming orange juice was a great idea.

I doubled this recipe and made muffins and a loaf of bread.  I froze the bread, but enjoyed and shared the muffins.  I followed the recipe and used the walnuts.  The muffins were delicious even without butter!

I make this on a regular basis and everyone who has tried it has liked it. I prefer fresh cranberries but have used dried when they were handier and it always turns out great. I don't think its dry at all. It reminds me of the loaf cakes you buy at the grocery that are pre-sliced in clear plastic. It looks just as good or better than they do and it always tastes waaaaaay better.

We didn't care much for this recipe.  The consistency of this recipe was too dense, almost chewy, and the flavor was like orange-cranberry cornbread.

I loved it.  I used the dried cranberries and orange extract instead of the orange rind.  I also used teaspoon of vanilla, white chocolate chips and some cinnamon.  It turned out great!

Very tasty...good texture, too. Be careful with cooking time! The recipe calls for 60-75 minutes; I pulled mine out at 55 and it was perfect.

Followed others suggestions in that I used 1 cup of orange juice, 2 cups of frozen cranberries, 1/2 teaspoon Vanilla. Moist, delicious and a scrumptious accompaniment to my morning coffee!

Wonderful morning bread to have with tea or coffee.  I made it with toasted slivered almonds, instead of walnuts and also made a drizzle of powdered sugar, a smidgen of orange zest and fresh orange juice that I poured on top after it cooled.  I was asked not to make it again because it was too good. I made it again the following weekend!  ;D

My bread came out quite dry, I had to make my own OJ because I had oranges but no juice. I made my own zest too and the orange flavor was great. I did use multi grain flours (white, whole wheat, and oat bran) combo. Which is something I do all the time and is always great so I think I will try using 2 eggs next time. I  will let you know.

I followed the suggestion to use 1 cup of orange juice instead of the 3/4 cup, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  The bread was moist and delicious right from the oven. Cranberry orange bread IS tart, so expect that.

Good recipe It was a tad dry. Next time, I will add some orange liquor.
