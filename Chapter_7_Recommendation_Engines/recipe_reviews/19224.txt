This recipe produces a delicious variation of the classical Sicilian fig cookie known as ( il )cuccidato . The plural form is ( i ) cuccidati .
Typically the cuccidato is not curved but is formed by cutting 2-3 inch segments from the baked 18"-long fig-mixture stuffed pastry . The festive nature of the cuccidati ( normally served only during the Christmas Holiday ) can be enhanced by adding colorful sprinkles to the frosting mentioned in this recipe .

delicious and not difficult to make. 

i rolled four long strips, about 18x4 inches each, put filling along the center from end to end, then brought the long edges together and pinched to seal. i used a pizza cutter to cut cookies from each log. i got 52 cookies this way.

my baking time was about 15 minutes. the tops did not come out brown, but they were not doughy at all. 

i used a simple sugar glaze of 1 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar, 2 TBS orange juice, and 1/4 tsp vanilla extract; and then put some pretty sprinkles on.

A very unique cookie!  I really enjoyed the rich flavor of the filling.  Instead of doing bars, I cut 3" circles, spooned the filling in the center and folded the pastry dough over, sealing the edges.

Made these on a whim when figs were lying around and they are GREAT.  The pastry is wonderful and flaky, could use it for other recipes, and the filling is sweet & chewy.  Nothing is hard to do, the dough did not stick to the board (with a bit of flour).  For anyone who does not know, the direction "snip" in step 4 means to pinch the ends together, my sister tells me.  They baked great in 20 minutes and tasted delicious _without_ any icing (I didn't put any on at all).

Wow What a fun cookie, and healthy!  I left out the sugar and substituted 1/2 of the figs with prunes, left out the almonds as well.  Next time I think I will use a sugar substitute and make it diabetic friendly! Thanks! Great cookie!

Awesome recipe.  I added a teaspoon of orange zest the first time and not the second time.  The first batch was much better ...the touch of orange adds complexity to the flavor.  My Italian friends were very impressed!

Last year I gathered Italian recipes to make for christmas gifts.  These were a hit!  The dough needs to be kept refrigerated so that it does not fall apart.  It kept well in a sealed container but did not last long...delicious!

I was looking for the cookies I remember from my childhood.  These are so close, and they came out amazing!  The crust is so flaky and tender!

Wonderful recipe! Thank you so much! My fiancé and I loved them so much. Rolling pastry part was little bit difficult for me because I was impatience, couldn’t wait until dough became cold enough (it was sticky). 
I accidentally cut pastry 2*3, although those bite-sized-cookies were good for share with friends. This became one of my favorite cookie recipes!

My secret is to add the grated rind of an orange to the dough and a shot of spiced run to the fig filling. These cookies are labor intensive, but fantastic. They remind my dad of the fig cookies my Italian grandma used to make when he was growing up. Family, friends and co-workers look forward to these fig cookies every Christmas and ask for them year round!

These were good...reminded me of a fig newton.  They were easy to make.  I took the advice of another reviewr and cut the dough into four long strips, filled them, and cut it into pieces that way.  I wasn't sure what it meant by "snipping them three times," but I used kitchen shears and did exactly that and they looked pretty.  I just drizzled all of them with a confectioner's glaze.

This was a fantastic recipe. My sicilian grandmother and great aunts would always make fig cookies at Christmas time, but I don't have their recipes. I have been on the search to find one comparable. This isn't like my Grandma's, but it is really good. My husband loved them. Funny, when it said "snip" on the recipe, I actually took scissors, and "snipped" the dough to give them a slotted look. I didn't know that it meant to pinch the dough. I thought the slotted look was neat though.

Fantastic !  Solid 5 Stars !  I made these for a man I work for who is Italian/Sicilian and he loved them.  I did not put the nuts in b/c I am allergic.  I did add the suggested shot of spiced rum, juice from an orange, and part of the orange itself.  I also drizzled glaze and sprinkles since they were a gift.  He said they tasted like the ones his Aunt use to make.  The best part is that he thought they were BETTER then his Aunt's !!

These cookies were definitely distinctive and the pastry was one of the most successful recipes I've found.  I made these to take to a dinner party and to a funeral.  Several of the guests at the dinner party ate half.  The guests at the funeral said that it was the best "fig newton" they'd ever tasted.  I didn't personally think this recipe was worth the amount of effort it entailed, but I love figs so much that it was a nice treat.  Also, the cinnamon and pepper really is delicious "right out of the oven" but is hardly discernable at room temperature.  I served these without the glaze, but if I make these again I will try the glaze to see if they're more of a hit.
