This stuff is great!  I am preparing to make it my second time.  We have a bunch of hoity-toity friends coming this weekend and they will love it.  I have found that Chef John's Crostini Dijonnaise are a perfect match for this spread.

I try to follow Chef John's recipes to the letter but somehow manage to forget something or fail to have an ingredient.  This is one recipe that will forgive an inexperienced chef.

Since I have all the grace of a seal peeling potatoes, I find the most challenging part of this recipe to be pulling the cooked meat from the bones.  Last time I managed to get just under 24 ounces of meat from a six pound duck.  This time I am shooting for 30 oz.  If I can manage to find that much meat I'll serve half to the invaders and hide the other half for later consumption.  This spread lasts a long time in the fridge (if it is well hidden).

Geez is this good. And it's really very easy - just time consuming. I wanted a recipe that used a whole duck since I had one in the freezer. Recipes that don't call for just parts are pretty hard to find! Amazing how much flavor is imbued in the meat from the aromatics. I particularly love how the orange peel sneaks up at the end. Served with cornichons and grainy mustard. Drop dead perfect.

So do I have to chop the garlic, ginger & thyme for the "potpourri"? Or just bung 'em up there?! And later, when taking the meat off the bones, do I include the potpourri or discard? TIA :)

I used Chef John's recipe from a food wishes you tube video, which is very similar. The video is awesome, Chef John is quite the character.
I've made this 2x now. Both amazing. I packed the rillettes into Mason jars topped with a layer of duck fat, sprinkled with chives & orange zest.
It lasts for months in the refrigerator, the longer it sits, the more flavorful it becomes.

I've made this twice and it has come out better than each time. It's really best if you let it sit in the fridge for a week. Great addition to a charcuterie/cheese board and stores for quite a while if you do frequent entertaining.

Astounding flavors! I followed this recipe to the letter and it was not as complex as it initially seems. The hardest part was gathering all of the ingredients and that wasn’t a big deal. Frankly, this is simply a roast duck that’s been mixed with some fabulous flavors and the process is nice t difficult. Try this at least once. You will be more than pleased! I’m hooked!
