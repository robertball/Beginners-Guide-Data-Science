Cream cheese is a great cheat! This sauce was not grainy and turned out beautifully. I added more grated parmesan to suit my taste (prob 1c total), plus a handful or two of chopped frozen spinach (defrosted). I put the spinach in the sauce about 5min before serving. The spinach gave it a beautiful color and texture. No white pepper or nutmeg, just black pepper as that's what i had. Hubby loved it too! Easily reheats with a splash of half and half. Consider your own mix-ins like mushrooms, yellow squash, peas and pancetta (carbonara substitute), etc. Skeptics--you'll be glad you made this cream cheese cheat recipe!

This was absolutely amazing for being so easy. The only thing I did differently was leave out the nutmeg... only because I forgot. Next time I will add it.

Very Good. No need for the nutmeg or white pepper. I was also out of garlic too. I mixed cream cheese, butter, and Parmesan cheese in pan with a whisk until melted. Then added to noodles. Good flavor and not gritty. Awesome.

Just used the Alfredo sauce and loved it. I used Neufchatel instead of cream cheese and only 3 Tbsp of butter.

This was very easy to make and I thought it was very tasty.  This recipe was far better than jar sauces that you can buy at the store.  This is my new go to recipe :)

Pretty good but a tad bland. I used real parmesan from a block to add some flavor but next time I will use more garlic.
