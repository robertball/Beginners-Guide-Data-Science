Deserves a 10.  You're nuts if you do not stop searching and make a batch of these!  I happened to use a combo of Apricot Preserves and a bit of Smucker's Pineapple Ice Cream Topping!  The bars are thick and they just melt in your mouth one after another :)

Taste was good, but I agree with the other reviewers that there was too much crumble.  Perhaps reducing the amount of oats would help, as 1 1/2 cups seems way too much for the amount of dough you save for the topping.  You couldn't eat these like a bar because the crumble all fell off.  Also, they seemed too thin, and I will try it with a 9x9 pan next time.

These came out great except I made a few changes.  I added another 2 tablespoons of softened butter to the topping because it seemed dry.  I substituted chopped almonds for walnuts.  Also, I realized I didn't have any plain oats, so I used apple/cinnamon flavored oats instead...it turned out great!  Would definitely make these again!

These really are great tasting bars.  I was looking for a recipe that would come close to those sold in delis and bakeries, and this comes very close.  It's chewey and rich, really yummy.  I'd cut back a lil on the oats/nut mixture next time as there was too much topping.  I also added almond flavoring to the butter flour mixture and that put it over the tope delicious.

These are really more like a raspberry crumble than a bar.  I added about 2 tbsp extra butter to the dough because it looked way too crumbly to bake well, and I didn't want a dry, crumbly dessert.  I also stopped adding oats after about 1 cup because it looked like enough to me.  The first time I baked these, they did not turn out.  After 35 minutes in the oven, the top looked golden brown and the dessert seemed done; I took it out of the oven, let it cool a bit, cut into it and found that the bottom layer was not done at all.  You can't really do the toothpick test on these because the raspberry jam will stick to the toothpick regardless of whether or not the whole thing is done.  I had to put these back in the oven and it's been about 15 more minutes now and they still weren't quite done.  The second time I baked these, I used a 9x9 dish and bit less jam and left them in the oven for 30 minutes exactly; they turned out perfectly cooked.  I think the first time the jam may have been keeping the bottom layer too moist to cook properly, but I'm really not sure.

Pretty good. I did however make some changes. I didn't have and raspberry jam, so instead I used frozen. I also made a mixtire of cream cheese, eggs, sugar, and vanilla, and poured that over the berrys before topping it all with the streusl. Turned out very tasty :)

These are delicious. I make them in a 9 x 9-inch pan and they come out thick and chewy. Brought them to a party last night and they were a hit.

I agree with a few other reviewers in that the top comes out really crumbly but the taste is really yummy. Half of the pan is gone and it only came out of the oven a half an hour ago. I think this would be great served when still warm over some vanilla bean ice cream, kind of like the applecrisp at Chilis.

So yummy. I made these to go in Christmas baskets and really had  a hard time giving them up. Had to promise my husband I would make a batch just for him.

This was a tasty recipe my only recomendation is once you place the base onto the bottom of the pan, to bake in a preheated oven about 5-7min or just before the crust starts to completely brown. it helps the crust set up better and easier to take out of the pan for cutting.  I used preserves since I had no jam on hand.. the bars were still tasty but gooey and didn't set as nicely. I added about 1/4 cup o add'l walnuts for added flavor. great recipe i'll do again!

Everyone really liked these.  A few things I would change for next time: I would make the bottom layer mixture less dry, and I would make more of it.

These were simple to make. I used additional raspberry jam because it didn't seem like much when I spread it but then all the flavor was from the jam.  They were good though.

Yummy!  I didn't have any walnuts on hand, but did have some almonds so I used those.  They turned out very well.  What a quick and easy recipe!

Delicious bars.  Used Polanar all fruit raspberry for filling.  As to complaints about the top being too crumbly-I set about 1 1/4 cups of the flour mixture for the crunchy topping aside and added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of softened butter to it.  The topping is crunchy and doesn't fall off. Very good!

Easy and delicious!  I added 1/2 cup of the oatmeal to the butter/sugar/flour mixture.  It weighed 617 gm, so I pressed all but 200 gm into the bottom of the pan.  Then I added almost 1 cup of the oatmeal to the 200 gm and pressed it over the raspberry layer.  Next time I think I'll use a full cup of jam.  So good!!

Very good. I think I will make a few changes next time I make it, though. I hope that some of the mistakes I made were simply from elevation difference (in Denver) so I will adjust the temperature and time. There was also quite a bit of crumble for me as well and I think I used too many oats. Excellent recipe otherwise--I can't stop eating them!

this is now my go-to recipe for bars. i've used leftover jam, my sister's homemade apple butter, my leftover thanksgiving cranberry sauce... if you have a sauce or spread, you can sandwich it into this recipe and be totally happy.

I thought these looked awesome when they came out.  I was so excited!  Sadly, they weren't very popular and only a couple were eaten.  There was just something missing from the recipe.  Not sure, but I wasn't a fan.

this recipe is exeptional. I added 1 cup of coconut and omitted the nuts bc i didnt have them. I also added alittle more jam to the middle, maybe a cup of jam used over all, just so it was a little bit more moist in the middle. i will use this time and time again. thanks

The flavor of these is great, however, the top was a little too crumbly and most of the oatmeal fell off.  Maybe reduce the oatmeal by 1/2 a cup?  I don't know but they taste fabulous.

I made these bc my boyfriend had something like them at work and wanted me to try and replicate them. This recipe was perfect. It was easy, and delicious. I used a little less raspberry jam than it called for (probably about 1/2 cup) bc I prefer them less "gooey". I also added coconut to the topping, and I put chocolate chips on half the batch. Big hit either way!!

I made these for Christmas and gave them to my friends, it was a nice change of pace, since most of the things I made were chocolate.  I thought they a little to greasy for my taste, but everyone else love them.

These are good! I just served them for morning tea. I didn't follow the recipe exactly - I used peach jam, cooked it in a 9x9 inch baking dish and failed to read the recipe and only mixed a 1/4 of the mixture with the oats and walnuts - so my topping is super crumbly. Still its worked out fine, tastes good and I'll be making this again.

Excellent...I followed the advice of adding more butter...the topping didn't stick any better.  These are just crumbly!  But delicious

These were really good, but even better the next day after baking. My topping didn't bake well. Mabye I didn't add enough of the dough, but I think next time I would add a little butter and brown sugar to make it thicker instead of so loose. It all fell off the top. If not for that they would have been excellent.

This is a keeper recipe! I followed recipe as written and agree that there is too much crumble on top. Next time  I'll reduce oats to 1 cup. Otherwise my dad and brother could not stop raving and asked me to make them again.

The topping was just too crumbled. Needed extra butter or less oats. Tasted good tho. Has potential for switching up any different jams.

I have made these several times now and they come out beautifully.  Some of the reviewers have complained about the 'crumbly' topping.  What I do to the remaining mixture with the oatmeal is add just another tablespoon and 1/2 of butter, and not quite 1 cup of oats.  Mix that with your (clean!) hands, sprinkle on top evenly and press it down onto the jam so it's well pressed in.  Wella!  No 'crumbly' topping and it's well incorporated onto the bar mixture.  They are awesome!!

I thought it was great.  The only thing I did differently was that I added some fresh raspberries to the filling and it turned out delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy and buttery-everyone loved it. I, too, worried about the amount of topping, but in the end, it was just right!

These are great just as written, and loved by my family. If you want to go crazy-decadent (you certainly don't need to but I had a hormonal hankering haha): sprinkle chocolate chips on top of the jam & then proceed with recipe. The chocolate mixes with the jam to form a soft chocolate-raspberry sauce.... But that is awfully sweet, so be forewarned. Seriously good as is though. :)

The bar holds together quite well. I used more jam than it called for, because I wanted it more jam than bar, and it stuck just fine. Will definitely make again.

Very dry and seemed like it needed way more jam.  It became ice cream topping.

These are awesome!  I had a similar recipe, and it called for 1/4 cup sliced almonds.  I found that adding 1/2 tsp. almond extract to the mixture made it really special.  Note that you can use 'quick oats' in the mixture.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious and so pretty! I have to give it four stars only because I found that there was too much topping in the recipe as written; I sprinkled the topping over the raspberry preserves until I covered but still had about 1/4 cup of topping left over.  The flavor, however, is so nice and the bars are chewy (which is just as I like them to be).  Thank you for sharing Stacey :)

I like these, my hubby not so much.  They were easy to make.  Only problem I had was that all the oatmeal topping fell off.  Thanks.

These were very good.  My only real complaint was that the crumbly topping didn't stay in place and I was left with nearly a cup of loose topping in the bottom of the pan by the time I cut all the squares (from two batches).  (I've been eating it by the spoonful for the last few days).  I might decrease the oats next time.

Pretty good.  When they come out of the oven they don't seem like they'll be bar-like, but when cooled they are.  I halved the recipe and used a 9x9 pan.  I had to cook mine for about 10 minutes longer and they probably could've gone for another 5.  I like a crisp top and bottom though.  The only change I made was to use raspberry preserves instead of jam.  The topping is a little on the extra crumby side so next time I think 1/2 c of oats would suffice.  Thanks for helping me satisfy my raspberry craving.

These were delicious and I'll definitely make them again.  When I do, I'll try some of the suggestions to make the topping less crumbly.  I sprinkled milk chocolate chips on top because I thought it would be a tasty addition. But next time I'll put them on top of the jam layer since they rolled off along with the topping.  Yum!

Such a good recipe, The thought of them makes my mouth water! I used low sugar raspberry jam because I prefer a filling that's a little more tart. Thanks for the great recipe:)

These turned out pretty good!  They are very buttery and chewy, which I like.  I used blueberry jam and it tasted fine.  I think I'll try it with the peach jam next.

This recipe tastes great.  The top layer is very loose though and flakes off.  As the other reviewers have stated something needs to be added to the top mixture to make it stick.
