I was very impressed by this recipe. I came home in the mood for French food, but also had to get dinner on the table asap, and use up some chicken tenders. This recipe seemed to fit the bill. I followed it pretty well. Variations were (1) using chicken tenders rather than breast halves; (2) dredging chicken in a flour/paprika/pepper/garlic powder/onion powder mix before cooking; (3) using a combination of olive oil and butter in lieu of vegetable oil; and (4) being more generous with the wine, sugar, onion powder, tarragon and garlic powder (I was not measuring anything, so I can't be more precise). It came out great. The sauce was the star, light and creamy with a definite French flavor. I am still astounded at how easy this was to whip up. We will definitely make this again.

The recipe is good and is very simple and easy to make, my boyfriend and I really liked it am giving it a 3 start because all of the flavor is in the sauce. The chicken by it self has no flavor, will do again but next time I will at least salt and pepper the kitchen before browning.

Yummy!  I used the 98% fat free soup and that it was super creamy!  Not watery at all!  My ONLY complaint is not enough mustard flavor, it was hardly there for us!  Other than that...deliciousness!

I really hate rating this a 3, but I had higher hopes for this dish than what came out.  I thought it smelled so good cooking, and I liked the flavor somewhat, but I think using 98% Fat Free Cream of Chicken soup made it way too watery (and the only reason I am rating a 3 is b/c the recipe says you can use either regular or the 98% FF), but it was not really creamy enough for what we were thinking.  The BF ate it, but didn't care much for it.  I think I will try again sometime, and use regular soup.  I am dieting so I thought the 98% FF kind would be best to try for now, but once I make again, I will review again.  I just think it's best to use the REAL soup...also I served w/ whole wheat noodles and roasted veggies, and I think next time I will try it w/ potatoes of some sort.

Delicious and so quick and easy.  The only thing I did differant was add more dijon than what the recipe calls for.  I've yet to be let down by a Campbells recipe!

Pretty simple chicken recipe. I used twice the amount of mustard (we love the mustard flavor). This recipe is in my usual rotation. I serve it over couscous/rice or angelhair pasta.

So good, i needed a good recipe to make up for the awful meatloaf i made the night before to redeem myself, and this one definately did the trick.  I did use 1/4 cup half and half and 1/4 water, but other than that, kept everything the same.  Thanks so much for a GREAT recipe!!!

I also seasoned the chicken breasts before cooking.  Served with sweet potato fries which were good for dipping in the yummy sauce. Easy!

It wasn't zesty enough, and the brown sugar in it made it extremely sweet. It wasn't what I was looking for. My husband loved it, which is why it earned 4 stars. I wouldn't ever make it again the way this recipe orders it.

I feel bad about giving this 3 stars, because I really liked it.  Also it was fast and easy.  However, hubby hated it; so, I need to make a note only to make it when he's out of town!

Used half water half wine and also more Dijon.  Next time I will omit the brown sugar.   We wanted more of a twang than sweet.

This was delicious. I would substitute 1/4 cup of wine for 1/4 cup of water. I served it over fettucine and it looked and tasted like something you might get at Olive Garden. I also recommend sprinkling shredded parmesan cheese over the top. Yummmm

This was just the thing I was looking for.  Lots of flavor and  easy to make. Justs looks like it took a lot of work!  I didn't have the condensed soup but had the ready to serve. Left out the 1/2 cup of water.  I served it with noodles and used the sauce on top and served with a side of vegetables.  This dish would be excellent with rice or potatoes!  Definitely a keeper!

Really delicious!!! Following reviews, I added a little less water, but made up for it with wine. Will omit brown sugar next time and add more mustard. Husband did not like the hint of sweet. Made this on a Monday and finished the leftovers on Wednesday. I think that the leftovers were even better!! More flavorful. Will definitely make again!

My boyfriend said this was the best dinner I've ever cooked for him. I served it with wild rice and green beans. What a healthy balanced meal! 
I'll make this one over and over again. Its so easy! 
Next time I'll substitute salmon for the chicken and see how that goes.

Very quick and easy to make. Tasted good, although a little bland. I served with instant brown rice, and dinner was ready in 20 minutes. Can definitely make with fat-free soup.
