This is my favorite pot pie recipe.  It's so simple.  We've made this for years, it works equally well with chicken or beef (just change to cream of mushroom soup, and add a little beef base).  My kids, who are very picky love it.  I just have to say, when you change a recipe completely, before trying it as written, how in the world can you honestly give it a review???  I love this website, but the reviews drive me nuts, lol.  Changing a few small things, because you didn't have something on hand is one thing, but to change the entire recipe, turn it into a mashed potato casserole, then call yourself reviewing a turkey pot pie??  I'm sorry, vent over:)

This was VERY good! I was concerned that it would taste like cream of chicken soup, but it didn't at all. I made a few substitutions and additions that I think made it even better.

I substituted 2t. minced, dried onion for the fresh (which reduced liquid content slightly) and 1c. evap. milk for 1/2c. milk. I think this made it creamier but not runny.

I added 1t. chicken boullion granules, some pepper, and 1/2t. of each of the following spices: poultry seasoning, paprika, dried parsley, and garlic powder.

My husband put it together, and he cut out small gingerbread shapes from the extra pie dough and put them on top of the top crust to entice the kids to eat. The refrigerated pie crusts are MUCH better than the frozen, by the way.

I was in a hurry this morning to get something made that is easy enough for my husband to finish since he gets home before I do.  After glancing over the other ratings, I could see this is a very versatile recipe.  I omitted the onions, added dried minced onions, garlic salt, oregano, lots of freshly goudn pepper, and substituted cream of chicken for cream of mushroom with roasted garlic. I used the refridgerated pie crusts, the mixed veggies from Costco's freezer section, and extra turkey from Thanksgiving's fried bird.  Left it in the fridge all day for my husband to bake when he got home, and I came home to a delicious and tremendously easy dinner.  This is definitely going into our winter dinner rotation.  THANKS!!

My family loved this recipe.  Keep in mind my 13 year old normally hates any kind of pie, including fruit pies.  He ate two pieces of this.  I made the following modifications: instead of frozen mixed veggies I used freshly cut carrots, celery and diced potatoes. I didn't saute the onion first--just threw it in. I put the turkey & veggies in, mixed the soup & milk together and poured that over the turkey & veggies.  I used store bought refrigerated pie crusts to make it super easy.  I also used an egg wash on the crust to make it nice and golden brown.  

I plan to use this recipe on a regular basis.  Delicious homemade pot pie!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This recipe is fantastic. Not only was it easy as 1-2-3 to make, but what a GREAT way to use all the Holiday Turkey leftovers! I changed it up a bit adding whatever spices sounded good. I didn't have frozen veggies so I just popped open a couple cans of different veggies from my pantry; which actually gave me enough to make two pies - which is good because one pie was not enough. My family loved it and went back for 2nds and 3rd helpings. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I doubled this recipe to have one for the freezer and I'm so glad I did!  This turned out great with leftover rotisserie chicken instead of turkey.  I used broccoli, carrots & cauliflower mixed veggies, then added a bit of frozen corn too.  After sauting the onions I added the milk to the pan, and I added 2 bouillion cubes as another reviewer had noted it needed more flavor.  I used the Pillsbury pie crusts.  Outstanding, my husband loves pot pies & I never wanted to make one - this was super easy and delicious!  I'm  sure this will be a cold-weather favorite.

This is a great recipe for kids.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I wasn't able to follow to a T.  I left out the onions because I'm the only one who likes them.  And I didn't have pie crust, so I melted a little butter and mixed with plain bread crumbs and sprinkled it over the top.  My family loved it.  My 5 1/2 yr old had 2nds and is asking for leftovers today!  Couldn't ask for anything better than that!

I'm almost starting to prefer the Boxing Day turkey pot pie more than the roast turkey on Christmas Day. I make this with fresh veggies - carrots, celery, potato, green beans/peas - and this year I ended up adding some leftover turkey gravy to the mix. It needs a lil freshly ground pepper and a wee shake of garlic powder, and it turns out really good. Thank you!

This is a great basic recipe.  I made a couple of substitutions, based on my leftovers.  Instead of the frozen mixed vegetables, I used leftover cooked whole green beans with browned mushrooms and instead of the pie crust, I spread the mixture into a greased casserole and topped with a layer of leftover Make-ahead Mashed Potatoes (recipe also on this website). The results were excellent and everyone asked for more.  Easy, economical, versatile and delicious.

My only modification to this tasty dish was to add celery to the onion , season same with celery salt, and to use table cream instead of milk.  Following other suggestions, I per-baked the pie crust.  My husband was wild for this delicious and easy to make dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good "start" but needs more spices to suit me. Overall....too bland and boring for us. I added for spices: 1/2 tsp each of salt and pepper and 1 tsp poulty seasoning.

5 stars with changes.  I followed the recipe except adding my own combination of veggies.  Potatoes, corn, carrots, celery, and onion to total 2 C.  I did not cook anything before putting it in the pie and it came out fine.  Just chop everything small enough.

Made mine with chicken, carrots, celery, and potatoes. My husband went crazy over it! I didn't have any onions in the house so I had to use powder. Next time I'll add pepper too.

I used this recipe just made it in a big batch with my turkey leftovers from the holidays. Used the shredded turkey and mixed vegetables. Then for the filling used some of the leftover turkey gravy and mixed in some cream of chicken soup. Added salt and pepper for taste and vualah-it was very good. I ended up having enough to make 8 pot pies and covered and froze for future dinners ; )

Wow, amazing recipe. I followed it primarily as mentioned online. I only added some additional seasoning such as garlic, Ms. Dash, pepper, salt, chicken boullion, and lastly instead of milk, I had heavy whipping cream on hand. This was really good and my husband loved it as well and he's somewhat a picky eater. I will most definitely make this again.

This was fantastic!  We made it with a single crust and a sprinkle of cheese on top instead.  Also, we used cream of mushroom soup and chicken rather than turkey, because that's what we had on hand at the time.  Delicious!!

This was really good. I used store bought pie crust and followed the advice of another reviewer by using 1c evaporated milk rather than the 1/2 c regular milk. I didn't want to make more dirty dishes so I used minced onion instead of fresh. I also added salt, pepper, garlic powder and parsley. Very easy and a great last minute dinner solution.

My family of 4, including 2 picky kids, gobbled this up!  The only changes I made to the recipe were substituting some leftover turkey gravy for some of the cream soup.  I will definitely make again - it's simple and a great way to use up the Thanksgiving leftovers!

5 stars for taste & simplicity!  The only thing I would do differently is to make sure the turkey doesn't have any broth with it.  Mine was a little runny, but that was because I threw all of my leftover turkey into it, including the broth.  I didn't have any frozen veggies on hand, so I used canned mixed veggies instead.  It was very good, but I'm sure it would be even better if I had used the frozen veggies.  Great way to use up leftover turkey!

I just finished eating this and had to leave a review right away. It is so amazing! I used frozen puff pastry sheets and used half and half instead of milk. I didn't see the part about cooking the onions first (oops!) so they went in raw but came out completely tender. I added thyme, oregano, coarsely ground black pepper, garlic powder and a little parsley and the flavour was outstanding. It did boil over in the oven a little, so put a cookie sheet below it.

I love this recipe!  It is not only delicious, but SO easy!  I did substitute half of the mixed veggies for about 1 cup of cooked diced potato, and added an egg wash to the top.  A great use for leftovers!

My mom has made this recipe for years.  This recipe needs a little "punch,"  Try adding a teaspoon of ground sage and some freshly ground black pepper.  That would make it a 5 star recipe.

Thanks for the great recipe.  Made my own pie crust and coated the pie pan with butter flavored shortening.  Used soy milk instead of regular milk and added some additional spices (a few dashes of cayenne, rosemary and thyme).  Also sauteed garlic with the onion (I can never have a dish without garlic!)  Add a bit a flour for thickness and extra turkey and veggies.  Fantastic! Thanks again.

This is a great basic that you can make a variety of ways!  The soup was perfect in it.  I changed up the veggies and added a little shredded cheese but it is a perfect recipe for friends and family.  I will use this one for years to come!  It turned out so good i had to submit a picture! Merry Christmas all!

I used spinach and broccoli in the place of mixed veggies and added 1/2C shredded cheddar cheese. My three picky eaters loved it! Next time I will add a bit more spice.

Great recipe!  Used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup.  Adds more sauce.  Also used the "Buttery flaky pie crust" by Dana.  Turned out wonderful.  Great crust for this recipe!

Sorry for all the changes I made to this recipe (why only 4 stars)  but it was delicious!..   I used leftover roasted turkey that I had brined.   I made the following changes/additions:  Someone said it was bland so I added 1/4 tsp. black pepper, 1/4 tsp. of poultry seasoning and 1/2 tsp. of rubbed sage, also onion powder since my kids don't like seeing any chunks of it.  I used a can of "ready to use" Creamy Chicken Soup and omitted the milk in the recipe.  I added a pinch of flour to thicken the sauce since it wasn't condensed and 1 can of Veg-all for the veggies; I really like potatoes in mine.  I did an eggwash on top and it came out beautiful!  Sooo comforting on a cold day! :)

I have been making pot pies like this since the beginning of time and it is a quick way to use left over chicken, turkey or roast beef. I sometimes use cream of mushroom soup or celery.Always good and I agree with some of the others. When you add this or that and the other then review it you are reviewing your own recipe not the one that is given.

Although we did enjoy this recipe very much, for my taste it was a bit bland, even after adding garlic powder, pepper, salt, poultry seasoning and sage.  Next time I will add even more of the seasoning.  The kiddos really liked it as it was though, and so did my husband.  They would probably give it 5 stars!

This is ridiculously delicious.  I don't usually go in for turkey leftovers but Mom sent us home with four pounds of turkey so... I started off by sauteing the onion and adding two stalks of chopped celery.  Then I threw in some shredded carrot and a spoonful of minced garlic.  I added some (leftover) Lima beans and some frozen peas.  I also added several small potatoes finely diced before I threw in the soup and some extra milk to offset the starch from the potato.  I cooked it on the stove top until the potatoes where almost done before transferring to a rectangular baking dish and spreading a tube of crescent roll dough on top.  My husband and daughter dislike pie dough.  Oh and I seasoned liberally with Zender's chicken seasoning.  So good we had to force ourselves to stop eating.  I had to promise to pack it up for lunches tomorrow.

This has great flavor but it needs more liquid.  We like to have a bit more liquid to wet the pie crust.  I may try again but add some chicken broth.

Yummy comfort food! Of couse, I had to tinker. My changes: I sauteed half an onion in butter, added in pepper, poultry seasoning and garlic powder. Also added in a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken. Love this! Thank you!

This was wonderful!  First time making a pot pie and it turned out great.  I used leftover turkey, a cauliflower/broccoli/carrot veggie mix and followed the rest of the recipe minus the onions (I did use minced onions).  My 14 year old daughter loved it as did my boyfriend!  Thumbs up!!  Can't wait to try it with chicken! Thanks for the recipe Diane!

This was really good! My only changes were: I used 2 cans of cream of chicken and mushroom. I used at least a half a cup of onion. I used a glass dish to cook it in. The crust cooked evenly top and bottom. I will cook this again!

AWESOME!  I made this in a deep dish with one thick crust on top.  It was soooo good and I had to control myself from eating the whole dang thing.  It had a wonderful creamy consistency yet held together for slicing.  My whole family loved it.  I will use this recipe again and again possibly trying chicken, pork and maybe shrimp.

Great and easy recipe.  Made it again and used 2 cans of cream of celery soup and 1 1/2 cups of milk.  I also added 1 tsp of salt, 1 tsp thyme and 1/2 tsp of pepper.  I made this in a 10" deep dish crust.  My family loves the extra creaminess with the extra can of soup.  Might try this in individual casseroles next time.  Leftovers are good reheated also.

I had some left over turkey from Thanksgiving and decided to make this pie. At the top of the recipe it states that you can assemble it and freeze to bake at a later time so that's what I decided to do. So I decided to bake it today. There were no instructions included as to how to bake once frozen. I wasn't sure what to do whether I should thaw it or cook frozen. I asked the question twice on the recipe exchange and although some people were kind enough to respond there was no definative answer. I decided to do it frozen at 400 degrees. I took two hours to cook and probably could have gone longer but my family was complaining that they were wasting away and needed to eat. I would say it probably could have gone another 20 minutes to a half hour because the bottom crust was a little gummy still. Was it worth the two hour wait? No but it was tasty and I would make it again but I would bake it right away. I would never freeze again.

This was FANTASTIC!!!! It was very simple which is good because I'm not the most advanced cook; I'm only 15! This was very yummy! I was so excited to try it and I loved it! Insted of using cream of chicking soup I used cream of mushroom. And I also didn't use frozen veggies. Instead I peeled and cut carots and diced canned potatoes. Also I used Pillsbury pie crust because I don't know how to make it from scratch. Other than that I didn't change anything. THIS WAS DELICIOUS!!!!!!

I don’t usually enjoy leftover turkey, but that’s what I used to make this great one-dish meal. I poured the filling in a frozen deep-dish piecrust and topped with a frozen regular depth piecrust for a perfect fit. I used 1/2 C carrots, 3/4 C peas, 3/4 C corn and subbed 4 T frozen seasoning blend (onions, celery, peppers, parsley) for the onion. When combining all of the ingredients, I generously sprinkled the mixture with Nature’s Seasons Seasoning Blend. It is also great made with cooked turkey cutlets. To make extra-special individual pot pies, I pour the pot pie mix into 4 oven-proof bowls, top with puff pastry cut to fit and bake 15 minutes at 400 degrees. Beautiful and delicious.

We had turkey last week and I froze enough for a pie, checked this one out but it sounds a little too anaemic so I will add some lightly cooked celery, onion, poultry seasoning, white pepper,and a dash of sage, marjoram and thyme, canned gravy(no msg like canned soup)then brush the top crust with egg white and water for that lovely browned finish.

This is a GREAT recipe!  Used leftover turkey, a can of potatoes which I diced, a can of peas & carrots, a can of cream of chicken soup and about a little less than a can of milk, parsley flakes and poultry seasoning. Mixed in a bowl and added to a Pillsbury Pie Crust.  This really came out great, even my picky teenagers enjoyed it!

You will want to give this one a try! It was really easy and did not disappoint. However, when I try this next time I will play with some seasoning. It definately needs some salt and pepper, perhaps some poltry seasoning. I made the recipe exactly as called for and it was really easy and came out as expected. I used store bought premade crusts, frozen mixed vegetables. Always looking for ways to use up left over turkey!

This is a great way to use up left over turkey.  Definetly need to add salt and pepper.

This was really good. I was actually surprised at how good it came out because the ingredients are so simple. I would even use this with left over rotissiere chicken. I also used fresh, boiled potatoes and carrots instead of canned.

Excellent recipe.  Family gobbled it down, had 1 small piece left for lunch the next day and it was just as good.  It took others advice and added poultry seasoning, white pepper, garlic powder and a dash of celery seed.  I also left out the onions and used leftover Thanksgiving turkey and some half and half instead of milk.  Next time I'll make two and freeze the extra.  Yummy!!!

This was fantastic. Did as was suggested we added 2 crushed chicken bouillon cubes. this added the perfect amount of seasoning. We like ours very wet so I simply added a 1/4 extra milk. but would not be necessary. Instead of 2 cups of the veggies I added one cup of the veggies and 1 can of sliced new potatoes. since they are already cooked they heated with everything else perfectly. very yummy everyone had seconds!!! thanks for the recipe.

Really good, fairly easy to make.  I used 1/2 c. milk, was fine.  Also added 1 tsp. of paprika, bouillon granules, dried parsley, garlic powder as suggested.  Used chopped onion from a jar also, was fine.  As long as you plan a little in advance, and buy the crusts, soup and mixed veggies, it's a good meal to make on a Sunday for leftovers on Monday and Tues.  I will definitely make again!  Thanks!

i was searching for a turkey pot pie like i made many years ago, and this is very similar, i did not remember how long to cook it.  this will be perfect for my leftover turkey and leftover veggies from a veggie tray, which i will saute carrots, celery & broccoli w/ the onions. Thanks!

This is a quick and easy way to get rid of leftovers. To skimp on calories, I didn't use a bottom crust, and it turned out fine. I also saved a lot of time by heating the turkey/vegetable/soup/milk mixture in the microwave for 2-3 minutes until it was hot. The top crust on the pie baked in 20-30 minutes, and the inside was nice and hot.

This meal was very good.  Lacked chicken flavor slightly.  The flavor could be enhanced by adding chicken base.  We will have to try adding additional flavor next time. Extremly easy to make. Great for busy family.

This is a great recipe for a basic pot pie! I subbed heavy cream for milk and added a splash more. Try adding half a pinch of rosemary, a full pinch of marjoram and 1/2 tsp of thyme to this recipe and it will be amazing for you too.

We love this recipe, I have made it a few times now.  It's absolutely perfect for leftover holiday turkey and it tastes so nummy!  The vegetables I use are a mix of peas and carrots, and it's the only I can get my picky toddler to eat peas.  I use a whole small onion, sauteed a bit first, and if I have a lot of turkey, I'll add a little more milk, some garlic powder and pepper.  But, the recipe works wonderfully as is!

Ok my search is over! I tried several recipes and this ones the winner! Its perfect just what I was craving. I used "Kae's turkey pot pie "receipe from this site for the crust, its perfect!!! I had fresh carrots,celery,onion and potatoes on hand, so I added butter in a pan and cook them untill soft I also added some frozen peas! All together was still 2 cups of veggies. What makes this recipe so Good is the cream of chicken. I shared with my neighor and shes been a chef for 30 years and she ask for the recipe! I really LOVE this pie. Will keep and pass on!Thank you so much for sharing! God bless.

I must say first that this recipe is great as posted, but I love this as a stepping-off point recipe.  I usually saute mushrooms with the onions, and make 2 pies (freeze 1) using a pound of leftover turkey.  I sometimes add leftover gravy instead of some of the soup if I still have any left as well as some poultry seasoning.  This is pure comfort food.

Great reviews from all the family.  I made my own crust and made a double batch in a 9x13.  I also cooked the veggies to speed up the time and baked at 425 for about 40 minutes and it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

Okay, the convenience is nice, but I'm not usually a real big fan of condensed soup recipes.  Having said that, oh my gosh, was this good.  I did not saute the onion, just minced it fine, and added a little bitty sprinkle of garlic powder to the filling.  Also cooked some white rice (about 1/3C, dry) and put that in the filling to help bulk it up.  I did make a home made crust (No Fail Pie Crust III) and this was an AWESOME pot pie.

I liked it except I forgot to add the usual suspects, salt and pepper! Also forgot to add the milk, so not as creamy, but still yummy.  suggestion: red pepper flakes.

Followed the recipe with the exception of leaving off the top layer of crust to save on some calories.  Great for using up leftover turkey and super easy to put together.  Will definitely be making this again!

I thought this was very good. I added some garlic salt and a little bit of paprika to the mix. I also used an egg wash on the crust and wrapped the edge in foil to prevent it from overcooking. I had hoped this would be a fave for my kids, but only the baby seemed to like it. (In all fairness, my oldest craves salads and my middle loves junk food, but doesn't like normal "kid stuff" like mac-n-cheese. They are just odd.) It was a good use of leftover turkey though.

I needed something easy and hearty to make with the leftover turkey, this fit the bill.  We thought this was pretty good and I would make it again if I had leftover turkey to use.

my first try EVER at pot pies...  I was sooooo happy I found this recipe.  I changed a little cause hubby doesn't like peas and carrots...  *rolls eyes*  so I added more potatoes, celery and onions.  Doused it with hot sauce, put the crust on and baked...  I was wonderful...  that was last night... This morning I made it the way it's created and I love it!!!!  I will keep this for winter nights as long as I have turkey leftover...  who knows, might have to have turkey for Christmas too now...  just to have the pot pie from leftovers!!  NEXT I am making it with leftover deep fried turkey, can't miss, I am sure!!!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!!

This is my #1 favorite turkey pot pie recipe and I've tried them all.  The frozen mixed vegetables- thawed (as opposed to canned veggies - yuck) makes all the difference in the world.    I like to throw in some onions and celery to the mix as well.   This is a recipe that I don't worry if I have exactly 2 cups of turkey or veggies and it's equally good each time.   Sometimes I make several to freeze and I reduce the milk to 1/3 cup.

I loved this! The crust was delicious and it was simple and easy for someone just starting out cooking. I added about 1/2 can more soup and a few more vegetables to fill out the pie, and it was great. If you have leftovers, heat the pie back up in the oven at the same temperature for 20-30 minutes and the crust will be crispy and delicious just like the first day.

I would use this recipe again!  It is a good way to use leftover turkey.  I would cut down on the veggies next time and add more turkey.  Husband and kids loved it. Very easy to throw together :)

I didn't mind this recipe, it seemes to be missing something, but then again how exciting is pot pie supposed to be in the first place?  I ended up using a can of reduce fat mushroom soup because that was all I had in the house and I added a little bit a spice and a clove of garlic.  I didn't mind the flavour at all, I was quite impressed with my first pot pie.  Thanks for sharing

This was really good.  I wanted to use up some things I had so I used a canned veggie mix.  I also used cream of mushroom soup.  I will be making this one again!!

We love this recipe!!! We cook it regularly, and I use leftover chicken most of the time.  We skip the onions. When I don't have leftover turkey or chicken, I cook some chicken in a skillet with olive oil, s&p, and thyme (because that's what we use to season our turkey at thanksgiving!). Thanks for a delicious and sooo easy recipe!!!

This was really, really, a great recipe!  I don't particularly care for recipes using cream of anything soup but this was great. When we were first married, my husband and I used to live on Swanson pot pies at least once a week.  I haven't had pot pie for ages so I was a little reluctant to try this.  I used both milk and white wine for the liquid, added fresh mushrooms and cooked fresh carrots and added a bit of the water the carrots cooked in.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of powdered garlic. REAL COMFORT FOOD!!!

very tasty!!  Added fresh herbs (sage, rosemary & thyme) since I had them leftover from Thanksgiving.  Didn't make a crust (I can't!) and used crescent roll dough instead.  Very tasty - even my husband ate it and he doesn't like turkey!!

Made 2 casseroles from it - the other one is in the freezer and I layered the bottom of the dish with leftover mashed potatoes so I will let you know how it turns out!

Yum! I used a deep dish pie shell & one of the Pillsbury rolled crusts for the top. I used 2 packages of the Louis Rich pre-cooked chicken chunks- oven roasted. I had a can of mixed veggies, so that's what I used.(drained, of course!) I also added 1/4 t. garlic powder & 1/2 t. poultry seasoning- after reading the reviews. My husband ate half of this in one evening! I only let it cool about 10 minutes, but we were hungry & didn't care if it was "runny"- isn't that how pot pies are supposed to be? Thanks for submitting- so easy & good! Comfort food to be sure.

Divine!  My modifications:  did not add onions, and used turkey gravy instead of soup, because we were out of soup.  Used premade pie shells as well, for quicker prep time.  Awesome and pure comfort food at its best! Thank you Diane.

I thought this was pretty good, but just not the best.  the sauce was very runny.  I added 1/4c. chicken broth and 1/4c. milk.  Without the chicken broth, I think it would have been a little on the bland side.  Very fast very easy, convienient way of using p turkey.

I had a turkey hindquarter which someone had given me and am not overly fond of dark meat. So I stewed the hindquarter and used it in this recipe, along with Pillsbury pie crust and restaurant style mixed vegies. It was absolutely delicious. I will definitely make this one again.

I used premade crust and substituted a bag of broccoli/carrots/cauliflower for mixed vegetables.  It was the best version of this I have ever made.  Excellent!

We used leftover Treager grilled smoked creole seasoned Turkey, frozen carrots and peas, added chicken broth paste and a dash of creole seasoning for more flavor. It's definitely a hit in our house, no leftovers.

Recipe is a good start.  I used fresh carrots, celery, onions, and potatoes.  Sauteed the carrots, celery and onions and boiled yukon gold potatoes  cubed for about 8 minutes.  Cooked down to 2 cups total veggies plus a small handful of frozen peas (husband doesn't like too many peas).  Used 1 1/4 c of chicken broth in place of water, adding a bit at a time.  Combined everything in the skillet to heat through.  Per another review I pre baked the bottom crust for 8 minutes in advance of adding filling. I had extra filling that I used while plating...mmmm good.

Love this recipe.  This will be my 3rd year to make it post Thanksgiving. It’s one of my staples for leftover turkey use.  I add in some leftover gravy as well!

Turned out great!  I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey and went with fresh veggies rather than frozen. I used condensed milk and added a little paprika. My wife said it was the best pot pie she ever ate.

This was easy-peasy. I used frozen leftover turkey from Canadian Thanksgiving. Great idea for empty nesters with too much meat to eat the week after the holiday.

The only change was to saute some fresh garlic with the onions.  Used store bought pie crusts.  It came out beautifully and my wife gave it a thumbs up!  Thanks for sharing.

I was looking for a recipe to use turkey leftovers from Thanksgiving - my husband went for seconds on this, so this is definitely a keeper! What I love best about this recipe is that there's room to adjust to your tastes.

For my pot pie, I made the following changes: instead of onions and mixed vegetables, I used one small red potato, diced, and green peas. Next time I plan to use green beans, onions and potatoes.

I double the recipe and used 1 can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken. Boiled potato cubes, carrots, celery, onion, corn and peas. Mixed altogether and added a hint of cayenne for spice! I baked the bottom crust first so it wouldn't get soggy. Absolutely delicious!

I used this recipe to make mini pot pies in my electric pie maker, and I doubled the recipe to make 12 pies except I didn't double the milk. I didn't make any changes to the recipe, and the pot pies were great. I froze the extras for future meals, and they rewarm wonderfully. A single recipe will make the filling for about 6 4" mini pies. The packaged pie crusts for a double crust is enough for 4 mini pies with top and bottom crusts with some leftover dough that would possibly be enough for one more pie or two crusts for tarts or quiches.

This is an easy recipe as there isn't much going into it, but for me, I will need to make revisions next time. I would advise to leave out the milk. It's not necessary. It took well over an hour to bake so be aware when preparing. Over all, an easy recipe to follow and make your own

This was a terrific recipe for our hungry family!  I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  I opted not to use frozen mixed vegetables, rather, I chopped up carrots, used frozen peas, and added some new potatoes (from a can in the pantry).  Also, since my family is not onion fans, we used onion and garlic powder instead and then salt and crushed pepper to taste.  We also chose to make small, individual pot pies instead of the large pot pie.  They turned out great and the family can't wait to have them again!!

Came out GREAT!  Next time I'll leave out the milk or add less of it so the inside is not quite so watery, but I'm sure it'll set up a bit after it's been refrigerated.  Love it though!

Following the comment it might be too bland, I sprinkled some of the leftover stuffing made with sausage meat and poultry seasoning. I also do not add onions to things since many don't like them, instead I sprinkled some dry onion soup mix to the filling before adding everything to the pie crust. It smells delicious while it is cooking!

Super easy! I did add salt, pepper, and a cube of chicken bullion, but I'm sure it would have been good without those additions too. For frozen vegetables I used corn and broccoli, which tasted great with the turkey. The perfect meal for a cold day.

Excellent. If you are not making loads of changes to this recipe then 1/2 cup milk is too much. We used 2 tablespoons instead and the consistency was perfect! We also used fresh carrots in place of frozen veg (just our personal preference). Serve on a bed of mashed potatoes. :)

My family and I loved this recipe. I doubled it (lots of leftover holiday turkey) and made 6 individual pies. I actually quadrupled the onion for more flavor. My hubby suggested some salt and pepper in the mix, so I'll try that next time. Overall this was a winner. Can't wait to try again.

This recipe was great.  I added a little oregano and garlic powder as one reviewer had suggested and I omitted the onions.  Everyone had seconds and raved about how good it tasted.

I love this recipe - and it's a great way to use up those Thanksgiving leftovers.  One addition - I sprinkled the pie crust with some fresh rosemary and thyme before assembling.

I think this is an excellent recipe...nothing fancy...just good.  I followed the recipe but probably used more turkey and two cans of condensed cream of celery soup and then added half and half by "eye".   I didn't saute the onions, just added them in.  I used pre-made pastry and baked for about an hour til the crust browned.  It's very tasty and leftovers are great.

This was so easy to make and very good. I bought my crust and used frozen veggies, corn, carrots and green beans. I made it ahead of time and my Husband baked it when he got home. He called me at work and just raved about it. I'll do this one again.

This is pretty good and a good way to use up turkey from thanksgiving. I made according to the recipe except I realized at the last minute I only had cream of mushroom soup so that's what I had to use (I think I'd actually stick with this) and I did add some poultry seasoning as well as pepper. Overall a good easy recipe.

I made this for dinner tonight with leftover turkey and vegetables. It was so delicious!!! I will definitely make this again. The thing I love is I can use whatever left over veggies I have and I can make it with turkey or chicken. What a great recipe!

Super easyand tasty.  Our kids gobbled this up.  The only change I made was to use minced onion in place of fresh.  Oh, my veggies were still frozen but came out perfectly.

This is one of my favorite recipies on here. It is so easy and so good! I did not expect much from this, based on the ingredients. I sauteed fresh garlic w/the onion in a tbsp of butter. I added salt, pepper and some garlic powder to it, but thats it....This is so easy and my family loves it.

This was great and plan on making it again for another group of friends. I would have given it 5 stars however the bottom crust was a bit soggy so i think i'm going to take the advice of a few others and bake the bottom crust a smidge prior to putting the filling in the pie.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this recipe twice and my family loves it.  I used two purchased deep dish pie crusts and added 1 1/2 tbl of Itallan Seasoning and 1 tbl of parsley flakes.  It is easy and a great way to use up leftover Thanksgiving turkey.

Tasty, but because it needed some changes I can't rate it higher.  I can not bring myself to use frozen vegetables, so diced celery, carrots, onion, beans, broccoli, turnip...whatever I had on hand, sauted til soft.  I found the pies a bit dry, not as much "gravy" as we like.  The meat and vegetables and crust were dry.  I will make again, but think I will double the soup and milk and give that a try.  I thought my 5 year old grandaughter would like her own "pie", but was put off by the vegs and meat sticking to the crust and would not eat.  She is not a picky eater

This was a great, easy dish. I might increase the amount of onion by just a bit next time, and add some frozen cubed potatoes. I added a few potatoes this time and although I was afraid they might not cook enough, they did and were great in the pot pie. I'll definitely make this easy dish again next time I have leftover turkey.

Very tasty and extremely easy to prepare if you use store bought pie shells. My only criticism is that the recipe made alot of filling so I made an extra pie. Not a problem!

This is a pretty good basic recipe, but it needs to be upped a notch according to individual preferences.  First, we almost never have turkey left over (that's not devoured in turkey salad sandwiches the next day).  So, I usually throw a couple of chicken legs and a breast filet in a pot to boil until done.  I remove the chicken from the water and add my fresh veggies...lots of celery.  They cook until tender in the broth while I shred and debone the chicken.  This sounds like a lot, but it really isn't, and it will make the difference between a good pie and a great one.  After that, I just thicken the broth with all the veggies and chicken in it with a mixture of two heaping tablespoons of flour and a cup of water. If you don't mind the chicken soup, you can use a slotted spoon to remove the chicken and veggies from the broth and add the soup to the chicken/veggie mixture in a prepared (sprayed) casserole dish.  My husband loves crescent rolls, so that is the top I put onto my pie.  I prefer the prepared pie crust, but...you know how that goes...:o)

Yeah! This recipe was great, easy and very tasty! I did change a few things after reading other reviewers. I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, some kind of roasted chicken spice I had in the cupboard and subsituted 1 cup of evaporated milk for the 1/2 cup of milk. I didn't add onion, just because I forgot. This was so good and easy. The only I will probably change for next time is to add a little more evaporated milk, because I would like the filling just a little more soupy. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitly make this again!

5 star for easy
5 star for taste.

Used chicken gravy as I did not have soup.  Hubby had 3 helpings & fussy Father-in-law liked it also.
Very Good

I thought this recipe was great.  Very easy and it tastes great.  I followed other advice and added some seasoning to it.  The only "problem" I have with it is that the center of the top crust never seems to get as done as the outer edges, but that could be because of the crust I'm using.  One of these days I'll make my own pie dough and see if that makes a difference.  Overall - excellent recipe!

Super easy and great for leftovers from thanksgiving dinner! Not one complaint and everyone ate it up. I used store bought pie crusts even though I had one left over from thanksgiving. I also added the poultry seasoning, garlic salt, pepper, and parsley as others had suggested. I love the ease of preperation of this all in one meal and can't forget how yummy it was. Thanks

This is a very easy recipe to follow and a great way to get rid of Thanksqiving Day leftovers! I substituted 1/2 cup of half and half cream for 1/2c. milk. I think this made it creamier.  I used the leftover corn I had cooked for Thanksgiving which amounted to 1 cup and then added 1 cup of thawed frozen vegetables. Following the advice of other members, I added 1 chicken boullion cube, some pepper, and 1/2t. of each of the following spices: poultry seasoning, paprika, dried parsley, and garlic powder. It was very tasty and I can't wait for next Thanksgiving's leftovers!

Absolutely delicious and fun to make, even had my 10 yr old helping me seal the crust. He says "this rocks". I added plenty of spices, and a can of chicken a la king that was in my cupboard that I didnt know what to do with. Came out fantastic! Thanks a bunch, will make this again!

I modified the recipe a tad, by using cream of mushroom soup instead and adding a top crust.  The pie held together very well and I received good reviews from my family.  I am going to add a teaspoon of oregano or maybe tarragon next time to add some more spice.  Overall, this is a good, easy recipe.

This was such a good recipe for all the left over turkey! I will definitely be making this again, hubby and daughter really like it too. Tastes almost like the cheater pot pie-another great recipe!
