We enjoyed this!  I upped the nuts to a cup and made 8 personal-size cheese balls.  They freeze well to put in lunches later with crackers.  Next time I would up the horseradish a smidge and follow Pam's suggestion with the mustard.

One of my favorite cheese balls...instead of the mayo, I use plain old bottled mustard. I think it goes better with the corned beef and horseradish. I leave the nuts off and roll in additional minced corned beef. The guys like this one lol.

Made this the other night for a snack and we enjoyed it okay. I wanted more of a dip so I used spreadable cream cheese and left out the walnuts. The flavor is good but this seems to need something else I just can't seem to put my finger on what I would want it to be  =). Solid recipe that you could throw just about anything into!
