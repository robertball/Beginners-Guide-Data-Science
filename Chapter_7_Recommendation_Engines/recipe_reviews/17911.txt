These were so delicious, especially the sauce, but the crust was amazing, too. I think the dough can be rolled much thinner than 1/4 inch, though and that'd help you get more filling in the ratio. If I make this again for my family, I will just make it into one large pie, so it's quicker.

My family really enjoyed this recipe and has asked to have it again, including my 6 year old. My other daughter even took it cold to school the next day for lunch. I did a few changes such as no pimentos and used sweet instead of dill pickles.  I have even told some friends about it who now want the recipe.  I thought the cheese sauce made it, but the kids were not fond of it.

I found the biscuits to die for, the tuna filling not memorable, and the cheese sauce pretty good.  The tuna mixture needs a lot of tweaking, and there's just too little of it to justify calling this an  entr√©e.  Also, the egg in the mixture makes it too runny to  have easy assembly.   The cheese doesn't need a double-boiler, just use low heat and whisk it constantly.

This needs review. Made more filling and crust and sauce than just 10 3" pies. I wonder if the egg should have been hard boiled as I had egg running all over the place. And my experience with cheese sauces makes me wonder why the double boiler and what ever is the final 1 cup of cheese for in the ingredient list. All in all this was a pleasant slightly festive way to make a tuna dinner. 
Will make again to try to work out some of the questions. Perhaps the poster can make comments.
