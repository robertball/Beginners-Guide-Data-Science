Very good; however, it was a little "dry." I agree with the review that commented that the ricotta cheese "soaked up" the sauce. I used about a jar and 1/3 and when I make this again I will use at least a jar and 1/2 of sauce. In the future I will also add some of my own seasonings. Otherwise, it was an excellent dish. My boyfriend raved over it and we both were very full and satisfied!

i couldnt stop eating it, i must have ate for 30 min. i did add 2lbs off beef, and used 2 jars of sauce. this made quite a bit, instead of one dish i used 2 square 10x10 dishes that way i could freeze one for the next week. it fed 2 adults and 2 kids from one dish.

Great recipe. I used the "Tomato-Cream Sauce for Pasta" (on this site) instead of the Ragu sauce. It was better than Olive Gardens baked ziti. Thanks

Cheesy and good! I used fat free ricotta, whole wheat pasta and added some salt, pepper and parsley to the ricotta mixture. Takes a while to heat and melt thoroughly because it's so thick. Very quick and esy though. I plan on making this one again.

Followed the recipe exactly with a slightly different sauce. Overall, if you want a lot of sauce, definitely serve it on the side/on top because it barely fit into the pan as is (with only 1 jar of sauce). It was extremely delicious though if I had a homemade sauce on hand or in the freezer that was heftier I would have removed some of the ziti or maybe used a casserole dish.

This was very good, but as per other reviewers, you do need more sauce.  I had some leftover spaghetti sauce (I made enough for 2 meals) and it worked perfectily.  A quick and easy meal.  Just serve it with some salad and garlic bread.  YUM

This is one of my favorite dishes, I make it probably every other week. Because I'm just feeding two, I usually split it into two smaller casseroles and leave the other one, unbaked in the fridge for lunch or dinner the next day. I'd like to try freezing the extra but honestly I've never been able to resist eating it.

This is incredibly easy and delicious. Put into 2 smaller dishes, one for us and one to take to my friend who had surgery.  Did put some extra sauce on top and recommend my friend do the same when she makes it.  Very food, thank you!!

It was really good! I would definitely suggest adding more marinara sauce because the ricotta cheese definitely soaks up a lot.

Agreed with others that it needs more sauce. In addition, I felt this had too much ricotta and not enough mozzarella. Next time I'll use 2c. mozzarella and 8 oz of ricotta

Excellent -- I followed the recipe exactly and it made a great meal with a salad and bread. As others have mentioned, all of the ingredients barely fit in the 9x13 pan (a little overflowing sauce), but it works. It wasn't dry at all. I will definitely make this again!

An old family favorite I've been making for over 20 years. Easy and good. I use more sauce though- about 40 to 48 ounces. As written, I think it would be too dry. I also add a little more mozzarella cheese on top

Thought this had great flavor, but definitely needed a little more sauce. (I didn't use Ragu though, we use Classico) So I just warmed up some sauce and poured it on my plate. Once that was done, it was really good!

Made this over the weekend for a baby shower.  First time I made baked ziti, and it came out very good.  I used Prego since thats what I had on hand, and I also used a bit more sauce than it calls for so it wouldnt dry out.  As per the other reviews, I also baked covered.  Had to bake longer than 30minutes though, and did it at a higher temp since I had 2 trays in the oven at once.  I also added a tiny pit of provalone.  Very yummy!  Came home with no leftovers!

I used the exact ingredients but twicked it with my own. I added hamburger and mushrooms in the sauce. I additionally added a layer of sliced sausage between the Ziti/sauce and Mozzarella cheese.  Great dish and easy to make!

Totally easy and completely delicious!  I added more cheese than the recipe called for because I figured, Heck!  If you're gonna eat 3 Cheese Baked Ziti, it should probably be cheesy!  I served it to guests as the main dish with Caesar salad and garlic bread on the side and it was a complete hit!

Quick & Easy!!!  That is what I look for, being a full-time working mom.  My family really liked it and that is all that matters.  I did not change a thing.  Next time, I would add fresh basil.  Ziti, a salad & garlic bread and we were good to go.

I used a different sauce, but I thought this was just okay.  It was really dry when it was done, and I ended up heating up an additional side of sauce to put on the table.  I think I will make it again, but I would saute onion and garlic to add to the ricotta mixture.

After my fiance mentioned that he wanted baked ziti for dinner, I found this recipe and used it as a base. I added fresh spinach and spicy Italian sausage to the layers, and have also added bell peppers since. Ziti pasta wasn't available the first time I made this, so I used rigatoni instead. Delicious recipe that tastes good as leftovers, too.

AWESOME RECIPE!!! I followed some of the other reviews advice, I doubled the sauce, and used prego instead of ragu...hoping for extra flavor. I also added 1/2c. parmasan cheese rather than 1/4cup.  Filled a 13x9in. baking pan perfectly.  Absolutely would have been too dry with the amount of sauce it called for.  With my changes, this recipe will be used time and time again in our home!

OMG this was so yummy!!!  I used Cottage cheese instead of ricotta because I don't usually like the dryness of the ricotta cheese in Lasagna and usually do the same thing with my Lasagna!  It's also cheaper if you are on a budget!  This was a hit with the whole family and my daughter took some leftover in her thermos today and said it was still yummy!!!

This is a good basic recipe but it needs a whole lot more flavor. First of all you really need to double or triple (depending on your preference) the amount of tomato sauce, I used my own homemade sauce. I also recommend some fresh basil and extra fresh grated Parmesan cheese. I made this dish with whole-wheat penne instead of rotini. Baked covered for 20 minutes and uncovered for an additional 10 minutes.

I didn't have any ricotta cheese, so I used mozzarella and cheddar, but it still turned out delicious!  I like my ziti a little crunchier, so I ended up baking it for about 40 minutes instead of 30.

Was looking for something quick and easy with stuff I had on hand, and this fit the bill.  I wasn't expecting it to be great, and was surprised that it was pretty good.  I did add pre-sauteed onions and extra mozzarella on top of the ricotta mixture just because I like a lot of cheese.  I used Paul Newman spaghetti sauce.  It seems pretty kid friendly too.  Some Italian sausage or ground beef would be a good addition.

We liked this, I do agree it is a bit dry and will next time either cut back on the noodles(this makes a huge amount of food!) or add more sauce!  Thanks for the easy and yummy dinner!  I have already passed on the recipe to a friend!

I used whole wheat pasta, additional sauce, and added Italian herbs and garlic to the ricotta mix. It was a winner at my house!

A little dry, but still delicious. My husband loved it. In my opinion, it was even more delicious the next day as leftovers!mWe will definitely make this again.

Very good.  Everyone enjoys this meal.  Pretty easy to throw together.  Absolutely needs an extra jar of sauce.
