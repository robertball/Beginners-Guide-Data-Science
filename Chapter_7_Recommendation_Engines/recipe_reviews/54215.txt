First, I would like to comment that if someone makes major changes to a recipe, I don't understand how they can give it a poor rating when they haven't even made the dish that was posted. I have made this several times and we loved it.

very delicious however I  made some changes. I toasted the corn tortilla's on the oven sprayed w/ pam. Marinated the chicken w/ some garlic powder, salt and lime. Also chopped up some onion and garlic and added to the chicken when cooking. I spread light sour cream to the tortilla's as I was layering and also threw in some corn to the chicken/bean mixture. I also left out the coriander. VERY good :) will make again. I also doubled the recipe so I could freeze the leftovers. thanks! :)

I changed this from four stars to five.  I have made this several times.  It's great for lunch the next day!

My husband and I enjoyed this dish.  I was craving Mexican food and it hit the spot.  For my own personal taste I used 1/2 medium enchilada sauce and 1/2 hot enchilada sauce.  Used light sour cream.  Will make again.

YUM! This was soooo good! Tasted just like something from an authentic mexican restaurant. Everyone loved it including my two picky boys, this will be a regular dinner here from now on. Here's what I changed: First,I subsituted 1/2t of chili powder for the coriander, mixed the sour cream in with the chicken and added a can of (drained) sweet corn to the mixture. I ended up using double the amount of enchilada sauce, using 3/4 in the casseroll and the remaining sauce to top the individual pieces before serving. I used 6 8in. soft low-fat high fiber tortillas, baking them at 450 for about 5 minutes before use. I also used low-fat cheese and sour cream. Even with all low-fat ingredients this was very rich and did not taste low-fat at all!

I was looking for a recipe that I know my family would like but I needed something for the crock pot. So I used diced raw chicken indtead of cooking it first and just added the cuman and coriander to it the pot it in my crock pot and cooked it on low for about eight hours and it turned out great!!
My husband is not a big fan of cassarole but he asked if we had any left overs the next day.

I didn't have any black beans on hand so I made it with dark red kidney beans. I was completely surprised at how much I liked it, plus it is a lot easier than a from-scratch recipe I have for chicken enchiladas. I would highly recommend you make it.

This is so good! Hubby and I both loved it. I used leftover grilled chicken, which made it so easy. Lightened it up a little with low fat cheese and sour cream (which I mixed together per other reviews). I also added some chili powder and tabasco chipotle to the chicken mix, and used whole wheat tortillas. Made during the day, and it still cooked up perfect in the specified time.

This dish was easy to prepare and very good.  I had it warmed over and it was just as tasty.  I put the sour cream on top of it just before serving.

This was good. It is nice to have the chicken. So many mexican casseroles call for ground beef.

I make this almost twice a month with NO changes and I've never had soggy tortillas.  This is one of our faves.  I don't understand some of these reviews by people who've significantly changed the recipe and then didn't like it and therefore rated it low.

This was very good. I ended up cutting the sauce in half because my dish was too shallow to accomodate the full amount. The finished result was still delicious. I also forgot to cover the dish while baking. My oven was a bit dirtier as a result but the recipe seemed to turn out just fine. I think next time I will sprinkle the top with slice black olives and chopped green onions for a decorative effect.

We really enjoyed this casserole.  It was definitely different from other casseroles in my recipe collection- kind of like a mexican lasagna.  Both my girls, ages 5 and 2, thought it was very tasty.  Like other reviewers, I did crisp up my corn tortillas in the oven (450 degrees for approx. 3 min. per side after spraying with olive oil spray).  In doing this, they still ended up with the consistency of lasagna noodles.  I can't imagine how soggy they would be if I hadn't done that.  You would think they would almost disintegrate.  I also made my own enchilada sauce- Red Enchilada Sauce from this site, which I highly recommend.  We don't like the store bought cans.  I did find this to be a fairly time consuming recipe though.  Chopping the cilantro and chicken, crisping the tortillas and making the sauce all really took quite a while.  I think I will make this again, but I will make the sauce ahead and freeze it when I have the time.  I also will try the suggestion of other reviewers to poach and shred the chicken.  That could be done a day ahead.  Then it would really be only the assembly and baking time that would come into play on the day I made the casserole.  It's just a meal you have to plan for, not start at 6:00PM after coming home from work.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's always nice to try something new!

I enjoyed making this recipe as much as I did eating it for supper last night.  I have never made enchiladas before and my family loved it!!!  However, I made a few substitutions since I did not have some of the ingredients on hand.  I substituted whole wheat tortillas and used cheddar cheese and served the reserved sour cream at the table.  In addition, I sauteed 1/2 chopped onion and 1 tsp. of minced garlic prior to adding the chicken.  Finally, instead of the cilantro, I garnished the dish with parsley.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is excellent.  Perfect for when you're craving Mexican.  It honestly has a true Mexican flavor.  I made the Red Enchilada Sauce from this site and it was great!  This dish is even better the next day.  Will definitely make again.

Spicy but yummy.  Follow the recipe and use corn tortillas not flour tortillas.  They make a difference.

My husband and I spent the day Spring Cleaning because we're expecting company for a few days, as a consequence, at 70, we're both sore and tired.  I automatically went to Allrecipes.com and came up with this recipe for my two thawed out chicken breasts. It looked to be the easiest one upon a fast search.  I was too tired to change a thing, just followed the recipe as is........and very glad I did!
It was excellent, I will remember it, I will fix it again, we both loved it!

Excellent! I used leftover roast chicken that I tossed with some chili powder, cumin and Mexican oregano. I also used home roasted poblanos instead of the canned chiles. Make sure you use an enchilada sauce that you love, that will make a huge difference in this dish. I like Frontera brand in the 16 oz jar and that was a perfect amount. I used a light sour cream and that seemed to work just fine.  I didn't bother with saving the last cheese and sour cream layer for the last 10 minutes, I finished all the layering and baked it (covered) for 40 minutes. Worked fine. Black olives and green onions were great toppings after it came out of the oven. Next time I will make a few changes. Like other reviews the tortillas "disappeared" so I'll try the suggestion of baking them a bit. I missed the flavor and texture of onions, to me that is integral to enchiladas, so I will for sure add some with the chicken and bean mixture. Lastly, I had just dabbed on the sour cream, but I think I would like it more incorporated (the dabs just sort of stayed there) so maybe I'll take reviewers suggestion of mixing the sour cream in with the chicken mix. I also agree with another reviewer that this is more like 6 servings instead of 8.  All in all a great and fast meal.

This was phenomenal. Following others' suggestions, I placed the tortillas on a pan in the oven at 450 for about 10 minutes, used fat free plain yogurt in place of sour cream, doubled the chile peppers, used a combination of pepper jack and cheddar cheeses, and added slices of avocado on top of the casserole after baking. I also marinated the chicken in olive oil, lemon / lime juice, garlic salt, 2 tsp chile powder, and 1 tsp each of cumin and coriander.

I used fat free sour cream and medium enchilada sauce.  I added onions to the meat and black olives.  Next time I would add some mexican seasoning or salt to add flavor to the meat.

This recipe was my first attempt at cooking any sort of Mexican food, as well as my first experience working with cumin and coriander spices.  I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.  The dish was absolutely delicious -- both my boyfriend and I loved it.  There was so much flavor in this casserole, and we both went back for seconds.  It was also an extremely easy recipe, especially for a beginner cook like me, so I would recommend it to anyone who is just starting out or wants to try their hand at Mexican cooking.  I didn't change anything about the recipe, and wouldn't.  Fantastic!

Quite tasty!  Due to some reviewers complaining of soggy tortillas, i toasted mine first in a 450 oven for about 3 minutes each side, till crispy.  (give them a quick spray of cooking oil)  They turned out nice and noodle-like in the end.  I also added thin sliced onion and minced garlic to the chicken while it cooked for added zing.  Will make again! :)

Great recipe!! I have made it as suggested and it is good but I have also added the sourcream to the chicken mixture and made regular enchiladas with it rather than the casserole. Also good with green enchilada sauce and I think my family perfers flour tortillas to the corn tortillas :)

Very good!  We love enchiladas and layering them in this casserole is so much faster than rolling each one.  Note: Use corn tortillas... they don't get soggy

My family and I really enjoyed this. I, like others suggested, added onion and a little chili powder. I also added corn to the blackbean mix and mixed the sour cream with the chicken when I spread it over the tortillas. It was quick, easy and tasted great, can't beat that!

This was delicious and easier than doing individual enchiladas. I doubled the cumin/coriander w/3 cups diced chicken. Coriander is fab w/cumin. I used "hot" diced green chile peppers for extra flavor-1 1/2 cans mixed w/chicken mixture. My husband doesn't like cooked sour cream (& I think it's best on the side) so I used more like 20 ounces of
ench. sauce (medium heat mixed w/can of "hot" diced green chiles) since you don't want it dry. I sprinkled chopped green onions on top, baked 30 minutes covered and @15 minutes uncovered till cheese turned slightly golden. NOTE: For those complaining of soggy tortillas, this is a casserole, corn tortillas will absorb ench.sauce, so after it sets 10 minutes, it cuts into nice squares for serving. When doing individual enchiladas, the corn tortillas are fried lightly in oil (the way I was taught), they absorb less and maintain their rolled structure. Corn flavor is a must, I know others who sub w/ flour tortillas - corn is enchiladas, flour is burritos! This was a hit w/whole family.
Thanks DEBMCE4.

Delicious!!  I did not drain the beans - I wanted a thicker consistency for the filling and I added about 3/4 cup of frozen corn.  I also used light sour cream and cheese - you couldn't tell!

It was really good! I really liked the corn tortillas however, it needed more flavor.  Try jalapeno peppers and hot sauce.

It was a hit! Everyone loved it. Very moist and flavorful and baked nicely. Good presentation and great leftovers! The nice thing about this recipe is that you can add and change so many things about it to really make it exactly what you want. The amounts do not need to be exact, which is another plus for me. Just layered it until it looked right and popped it in the oven for 30 minutes. It sat for about 10 minutes and then we chowed down!

I did make a few tweaks, though:
Boiled and shredded the chicken breast (I prefer it this way for a Mexican dish - very tender and quick to cook)
*Here's a tip: use your stand mixer to shred the chicken. It turns an arduous, dual fork process into a one-step wonder!)
Used a packet of pre-made taco seasoning. I love this flavor and cannot seem to create it myself.
Added an entire onion, finely chopped and pre-cooked.
Used green enchilada sauce instead of red just per preference.

Overall great recipe and such a crowd pleaser! Did our own chips and guacamole and some refried beans on the side, a quick side salad and you have a well-rounded meal. Well, don't forget the peanut butter brownies for dessert. ;)

Quick and easy comfort food, very easy to customize.
I added fresh corn kernels and a little more diced green chiles.
I was hoping to have enough leftovers for the next day but my husband polished this off. I'm glad he likes it because this is so fast and easy to throw together!

This was so good.  I made it exactly as the recipe said and didn't have any sogginess.  Next time I'm going to make a double batch so we can have leftovers.  My 9 year old son was gobbling this up so fast so that he could have seconds before anyone else ate them all.

I loved this recipe for it's versatility.  I didn't have any enchillada sauce or green chilles.  I mixed spaghetti sauce and salsa to serve as my sauce and chopped up jalopenos to serve as my chilles.  Excellent! Even my 5 year old enjoyed it.

This was an easy, tasty recipe.  I didn't use canned enchilada sauce but instead used the recipe from here for "Mrs. Espy's Enchilada Sauce" and followed the rest of the recipe from there.  Mine had good flavor and I think it depends on the enchilada sauce you use.  I did end up using more corn tortillas.  Thanks for this easy recipe.

I totally botched this recipe and it still turned out ok.  I didn't have an 11x7 so I used a 13x9... accidentally mixed the sauce in with the meat mixture and added the sour cream and cheese to the top before putting it in the oven.  It still turned out good :).  I'll need to add more to fill the 13x9 better next time, but will definitely do again :).  Oh... I used "The Best Enchilada Sauce" from this site... worked beautifully.

My only slight complaint was the texture of the tortillas after baking - a bit too soft/soggy.  This could probably be remedied by dragging them through hot oil to crisp them up before baking, but obviously not as healthy.  All in all,  solid recipe, and it did get a request for the recipe at my work potluck.  I loved the inclusion of beans to stretch the dollars with some cheaper yet just-as-valuable protein.  I did use chipotle salsa and a chipotle ranch dressing dry mix - kicked it up just a notch over standard enchilada sauce flavors.  Thanks for this recipe!

Very good! Boyfriend and I LOVED it. My 3 yr old son loved it, my 4 yr old daughter kind of picked and my 2 yr old ate some.  **TIP** Use the precooked grilled chicken in the refrigerator case.... cut WAY back on prep time. I just diced it up and threw it in the bowl and mixed with the spices, etc.  I did add sauteed mushrooms and onions, couldn't really taste the mushrooms which was disappointing, next time I'll add more.  ALSO I added 2 layers of fresh baby spinach over the tortilla layers, because I have a lot left over and we all love it.  **NOTE** if your kids don't like spinach it's a great way to add it in because you couldn't taste it at all. Next time I'LL be adding more because we love it but it's a sneaky way to get in some greens!

My husband liked this a lot and asked me if he could take it to work for lunch- a rare compliment. I was surprised I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. We both thought it needed more enchilada sauce, so next time I'll use 12 oz. instead of 10. Also, I need to find spicier green chiles.

My husband and I loved this recipe and the left overs are just as good as the first meal. I couldn't find any enchilada sauce in a can but I did find a quick and yummy recipe that is the perfect amount.  2 tbsp olive oil 3/4 c onion 3 cloves garlic 1 tbsp chili powder 1 c tomato sauce 1/2 c chicken broth 1 1/2 tsp cumin s&p to taste

I have made this twice in the last week. It's SOOOO yummy. The first time, I made it with no sour cream and no cilantro, the next time, I used them. What a difference! I added olives as well. This is SUCH a yummy recipe. I also recommend the "Green Chicken Enchilada Casserole" also on this site! Yum-O!

This was really yummy.  They flavor was fantastic.  I used monterey jack cheese. Next time I would add a little more cilantro, and probably cook and shred the chicken.  I found the cubes to be a little unusual for the dish.  Other than that it was perfect.

This was absolutely awesome!  Instead of cubing the chicken I shredded it (cooked it on high water, chicken broth, and chicken boullion)  After it was done I added the cumin and corriander and tossed it in.  I also added just a bit of cayenne pepper and chilli powder to the sour cream for just a slight kick.  This was definately a winner!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious, and made tons of leftovers. Note: I didn't have enchilada sauce and substituted hot salsa. It worked great. Also, I needed more than 10 oz of salsa (enchilada sauce) to cover my casserole dish. Probably ended up using about 16-24 oz of it all together. I substituted chili powder for coriander and added sea salt and lime juice to the chicken's seasoning.  Also, as another user had suggested, I sprayed my tortillas with Pam and toasted them in the oven before layering. As I was layering, I brushed the tortillas with sour cream. It gave it such a lovely texture. This is one of my new favorite recipes.

This is my new go-to recipe for enchiladas! I love it1 I did add a tsp. of garlic powder to the spice mixture. I also took another reviewer's advice and cooked and shredded the chicken before sauteeing in a couple tbl. of olive oil and spices. Also, I like tomatoes in my enchiladas, so I added one can of Rotel tomatoes to the chicken mixture. Really, really fabulous! Thanks!

We loved this. Boiled the chicken and shredded it like others suggested. Mostly as a prefrence. Left out sour cream and tasted just fine. Also added some diced tomatoes to the mixture before baking. Will become a rotation in our meals. Yummy

Really Really good.  I seasoned the chicken with corriander, cumin, a little smoked tabasco, taco seasoning and garlic powder.  I also sauteed some onion and garlic with it.  I added a larger can of green chiles and put in extra cilantro ( I like lots of flavor) I didn't measure out the cheese and I'm sure I put more then it called for.  Next time I'm going to crisp the tortillas.  The tortillas weren't soggy but I think that a bit of texture change throughout would have been good with crispier tortillas.  It would be super good with jalapeno but my s.o. is wimpy when it comes to spice so I mixed it in to my serving afterwards.

I have given the reciepe to many who have enjoyed this delicious treat.  I have also used groundbeef and I also cooked a roast for a day and then used the meat instead of the chicken.  VERY GOOD

We have made this several times and it is one of a handful that all three kids will eat. I use the enchilada sauce recipe from this site as well to avoid preservatives and msg. Making double batch for a potluck, this is a winner!

Made this tonight and will definitely make again.  Added garlic and corn, but otherwise followed the recipe.  would make a good dip minus the tortillas.  Next time I will probably add taco seasoning and salsa to zip it up a bit.  But did enjoy as is!

Ahhh!  A Mexican dish without soup!  We thought this was great.  Perfect consistancy, wonderful flavor, and easy.  I used fresh hot peppers instead of the chile peppers (cuz I have tons).  Thanks a million for the recipe!

This was a great recipe!! I did not have some of the ingredients, but even then it was super good. I baked the tortillas for 5 min first and they were not soggy at all. I did not have chicken, so we left that out. Used re fried instead of black beans. Added corn to the beans along with chili powder and cumin. Also mixed the first portion of sour cream in. 

Super yummy and huge portion.

I enjoyed making it.  Simple and it smelled wonderful.  This recipe is great on it's own.  My corn tortillas did not get mushy (drain juice off beans) and the different textures and tastes made it a pleasant entre. You could add finely chopped onions or other spices.  The grocery store didn't have fresh cilantro (drat!) so I used dried.  Next time I am definitely going to pursue fresh cilantro a bit more.  My boyfriend rated it at 4 stars and I agree.

I used leftover Carne Adovada in this recipe. This came together in a flash, which I appreciated. I garnished it with homemade salsa and my own mexican rice and refried beans. Thanks for a simple recipe that I could sub in my Carne Adovada.

My entire family loved this dish.  I did use a little more sauce than it called for, as well as an extra cup of cheese.  Next time I'm going to substitute the chicken with pork.

I am not one to make any changes to a recipe, so I made this just as the recipe states...(except I didn't drain the green chilis, I like the sauce) it was PERFECT just as it is.  I made it for a dinner party and it was a huge hit.  Everyone asked for the recipe.

I used this as a base and added a little kick and veggies. Great recipe, I added spinach, zucchini, tomatoes and olives. I used a food processor to puree 2 habanero peppers and three cloves of garlic that was used to simmer the diced chicken prior to layering.

This was more than delicious. I double the recipe and put the second one in the freezer. I used GREEN enchilada sauce which was great. I also grilled the tortillas before putting them in the dish like the previous reviewers did... good idea!

FANTASTIC! I changed things based on other reviews. I marinated the chicken with olive oil, garlic powder, and seasoning salt. Then I cooked it with taco seasoning. I chose not to use green chiles but aded corn and black olives. I used about 3 cups of cheese instead of 2, since I really like cheese! It was a delicious and well-received dish and I will make it again!

This is pretty good.  I made half with chicken and the half with extra beans.  I think I prefer it with green enchilada sauce but it needed a little more than called for as mine was a bit dry.

This was great! We used dried black beans instead of canned and I cooked the chicken with garlic powder and onion powder as previous reviews stated. We topped the casserole with an extra layer of tortillas and enchilada sauce and then cheese (as directed).  The taste was excellent and recipe was easy to make!  Will definitely make this again - quick and flavorful dinner option.

Super easy and yummy!  I followed the recipe pretty closely but followed others' suggestions of mixing the sour cream with chicken, left out cilantro (hubby doesn't like it), and marinated chicken in olive oil, lemon juice, 2Tsp chili powder, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp coriander.  Served with mexican corn from this website and rice.  Yum!!

I had to slightly modify due to what I had on hand. I used pre-cooked chicken, lime & green chili refried beans (instead of black beans) mixed together, then added the cilantro and chopped green onions and a little chili powder to Mexican Sour Cream along with the green chilis - layered like a lasagna - a little enchilada sauce, corn tortillas, chicken/refried bean mixture, cheese and then sour cream mixture - at the very end I topped it with american cheese slices along with cheese to melt in the oven - turned out great! Will  make again - hopefully I can try it closer to the original recipe!

I used rotisserie chicken and substituted chile pepper for coriander. It was fast and easy to assemble, and both me and my husband were extremely pleased with the results. He kept saying that this is a keeper! Next time I will mix sour cream with the chicken mixture to simplify the assembling process even more.

This is delicious! I made some changes based on the reviews.  I put the tortillas in the oven to harden them so they wouldn't be soggy.  I added spinach, corn and chopped red pepper.  I also substituted plain yogurt for sour cream on the first layer and used sour cream for the top.

This is a great recipe to make if you are cooking for the first time for a group people.  It's easy and it tastes good.  It goes really well with green chili cornbread and a salad.

This was a crowd pleaser.I didnt put the sour cream on during the last part of baking tho, i prefer to let them add it as they like, and i toasted the tortillas in a skillet a little first, gave it a nice little smoky kick. But I dont recomend using whole wheat tortillas, my grandma asked me to try them with this once for her, and it did NOT taste right.

Excellent casserolel!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  The only changes I made were to add a can of drained corn, and intead of putting the last 1/2 of the sour cream on the top with the final layer of cheese, I served it on the side.  Delicious!!!!! Everyone in the family was impressed.

Next time I will tear the tortillas in 1/2 and maybe add a few extra.  Might add corn.  Will definitely mix sour cream with chicken mixture before spreading in pan.

Great flavors - my DH and 4-yr-old son both LOVE this dish. I often double the filling and then add an extra can of enchilada sauce if I'm serving more people. This was also very good with ground beef instead of chicken breasts.

This was a hit in our house. Everyone said it was a must make again. We added more chicken however but we decided the next time it was made it needed more beans, more chicken, more cheese...we like our food stuffed I suppose! Anyways it was very good and even better the next day! Its also a good recipe to play around with!

This was really wonderful. I'd make it again. I used a little more than a ten ounce can of enchilada sauce. I also layered it this way: a small amount of sauce on the bottom, tortillas, chicken bean mixture, dollops of sour cream and mexi cheese add layer of tortillas, enchilada sauce, chicken bean mixture, sour cream and mexi cheese, final layer of tortilla, with additional enchilada sauce and finish with cheese. I cooked covered for the allotted time and then uncovered. I made a batch of this for my son and vacuumed sealed and froze it, but not before we each had a small piece of it, it was OUTSTANDING! I want to make this again, easy, economical, reminiscent comfort foodwise of lasagna with a a wonderful southwest flavor

I am giving this a 5 star.  It was fast easy and tasty.  I had guest over tonight and they loved it.  I pressure cooked my chicken and saved the broth for soup.  I added onions to the meat and bean mixture.  I doubled the batch and it turned out perfect.   I can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow.  YUMMY.  Thank you for posting this one.  Will make again.

Very good!  I changed a few things.  I added fresh spinach layers and omitted the sour cream on top.  I boiled and shredded my chicken and added chile pepper and extra cumin when I added the beans and cilantro.  I also combined the sour cream with the chicken mixture for easier spreading.  I pan heated the corn tortillas before adding them and they were not soggy at all.  Everyone who tried it loved and I am eager to make it again.  The leftovers were great the next day!

This was absolutely delicious!  I omittied the cilantro (didn't have and my family doesn't care for it) but made no other changes.  I've made it twice and both times it was gobbled up.  My college son is learning to cook and definitely wants to learn to make this casserole.  Definitely a keeper!

YUM! I left off the green chilis but used HOT enchilada sauce, added corn, and cut way down on the cheese and sour cream. I grilled the chicken with coriander and cumin and chili powder rubbed on. We loved it. I will definitely make this again and again. Thanks!!

This was tasty and easy to assemble.  To make it even easier I used some leftover meat from a deli rotisserie chicken.  I couldn't find canned green chilies at grocery store so I substituted canned chipotles instead.  It added a slightly smokey flavor to the dish.  Also, I dislike coriander and cilantro so I left those out.  I added more cumin and generous amount of chilie powder instead.  I think it would be tasty with some diced onion in there, too.  Maybe next time!

This recipe is so easy and my family loves it! I made 3 casseroles at once and froze 2 for later. They freeze very well. Definitely a keeper.

I love this recipe.  I have made it for 30 people for dinner at a homeless shelter with Rice a Roni Spanish Rice and it was a huge hit.  It is a great make ahead and just pop it in the oven while visiting with guests.  P.S.  I didn't change a thing!!!

Very good!  I did not have corriander so I added some chili powder and I did not have green chilis so I used a mixture of green, red, and yellow peppers saute'd after the chicken.  All in the house liked it and asked that I make it again.  Thank you for the recipe!  Next time I will make sure I have the correct ingredients on hand.

This was absolutely wonderful!  One of the best casseroles I've ever made.  I used fresh jalepenos, as I grow them in the garden.  Just the right about of heat.

This tasted delicious and authentic. I modified this recipe a bit, because it was for only two people. I used an 8x8 glass pan and only 6 tortillas. I also only used one chicken breast. Didn't add sour cream directly into casserole, added it on top of individual servings at the end. Served with pico de gallo and green taco sauce. This was an excellent, quick dinner.

This was soooo good!  My boyfriend loved it and he is very picky about Mexican food.  I didn't add the cilantro or the coriander since I did not have them.  Oh and I didn't do the sour cream.  Still VERY tasty!  I will be making this often!!

I made this on Halloween since we were having guests over.  My husband and kids loved it as well as our guests.  It was easy and quick.  The only thing I did different was to use more enchilada sauce than what it needed.  I was afraid it might be dry......based on other reviews.  It worked because it just the moist enough.

This was absolutely delicious!!  Only changes I made was to use more sauce than called for and didn't have coriander seeds so used Mexican oregano instead.  Also sprinkled garlic salt on chicken in addition to other seasonings before cooking.  Made in the morning and kept in the fridge until popping it into the oven at dinnertime.  Rave reviews from husband and brother and I loved it too.  Easy to put together too.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, I will definitely serve this again and again.

After cooking the chicken I mixed in the beans(not drained) and the enchilada sauce. I put some of the liquid on the bottom of the pan then the tortillas. Next went the chicken mixture. I pepper jack cheese that went on next then a final layer of tortillas on top went the sour cream mixed with some liquid from the chicken mixture. Covered with foil and baked, it was really good

Very delicious and very easy. My only tip would be to not put 8 oz of sour cream on outright. I'd put on half that and then add more to your taste after it is baked. It is just as good without the full cup of sour cream and is a bit better for you that way. I assembled this casserole the night before we baked it. Very handy for a week night meal. I'm thinking about adding a layer of spanish rice next time.

I really liked this dish. It was different and not that expenisive.. unless you dont have the spices on hand. But everything else was really simple. I cooked it for my brother's family and they all loved it. Execpt for his 7 year old dauther. She thought it was a bit spicy, however i did add more spicy season to it because i LOVE spicy food. If you like mexcian dishes, and LOVE black beans you'll love this.

Very good. I seasoned the chicken exactly as specified, which is rare for me, and thought it was perfect. I also mixed the sour cream in with the chicken mixture, which worked out really well for us. I will surely make this again, maybe try shredding the chicken to spread it around a bit more. Thanks so much for sharing :)

My husband and I loved this, the cilantro really gives it a fresh mexican flavor. However, my kids wouldn't touch it (4,2 &1), so if you have small children you may want to find something else.

This recipe was good. I didn't have any coriander so I ommited it but I used garlic and a dash of cayenne pepper. I also mixed the sour cream in with the chicken mixture instead of layering it. I would make this one again.

I used a rotisserie chicken to make the recipe come together more quickly.  Also, I used about 3/4 cup of sour cream, and it was plenty.  This is delicious, and I will definitely make it again!

Loved it!!  What I did slightly different was mix the sour cream & shredded cheese.. I layered it like I would ricotta on a lassange. Once it was baked.. I spread the remaining half of the cheese mixture on top (which was in patches) since sour cream /cheese doesn't spread well.  I then covered w/more shredded cheese and baked for another 10 min.
Delish!!!  I topped with fresh avacado & diced tomatoes and served with spanish rice as suggested. This is awesome if you like mexican!

I made this for a casual dinner with my mother-in-law and some additional family guests.  Everyone loved it.  I doubled the recipe and there were still no leftovers.  I sent the recipe home with 2 guests.  I have since made it for my family and it has become a requested favorite.

Minor substitutes included: Rotel diced tomatoes and chiles (the entire can) instead of green chiles; canned whole-kernel corn for black beans; and adding half the sour cream to one layer and the other half to the other layer of chicken mixture instead of saving it until the end. 

...and you know what? It turned out just as delicious as I thought it would be! It was a definite hit (for the husband as well). ;)

Added a full 7oz can of green chiles and used pre cooked chicken strips (chopped up) instead for convenience. Probably put about 3 cups worth of cheese in it. Served it with rice from a local burrito shop. Served it with cold sour cream for a nice refreshing hit! Delicious and super easy to prepare!

Very good. I mixed the hot enchiladas sauce with mild . I toasted the tortillas as recommended by others and added sweet corn. Would have been good either way.

This was really good! It is easy to change according to what ingredients you have. I added a can of lime and cilantro rotel as I sauteed the chicken, as well as chopped onion and garlic, but I didn't have the coriander or cilantro. I also used much less cheese and sour cream. We also toast our tortillas on a frying pan before layering.

It's because of this recipe that I continue to go to this site! This is a great recipe that I have made several times & always follow the recipe to the letter. Always turns out great & other people have complimented on how good it is when I have made it for them. However, it also freezes very well, so there are times where I make it just for myself & freeze whatever is left over for the future.

Made this dish tonight for dinner.  Yummy.  My only deviations from the recipe were: (1) used a large can of red enchilada sauce because that's what I had on hand; (2) added green onions that I wanted to use up; (3) used 12 tortilla's because I had a 13x9 pan; (4) shredded the chicken instead of cubed; and (5) baked the tortillas at 450 for 3 minutes each side as another reviewer suggested.  Totally delicious and simple.  Served with a side of corn.  Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow.

Absolutely delicious! I have made this several times for family & friends and it never fails that someone asks for the recipe :) I use cilantro paste located in the fresh herb section of my grocery store and use 4oz only because I'm a huge fan of cilantro! Very good, very filling! Thanks for the share.

This was great! I didn't have coriander, so I left it out. I used leftover rotisserie chicken. I also added a bit of chunky salsa to the top layer, and a small can of sliced black olives to the chicken mixture. Next time I might mix the salsa with the sour cream to help the sour cream spread out better. I also used a lot of extra cilantro, just because I love it.

Pretty tasty, made it in a 9x13 by mistake so cooked it a little less and it was fine. Also didn't have fresh cilantro, so I used about 1 tbsp of dried.

GREAT recipe!  I make this at least once or twice a month.  I dice up my chicken, sauté it with some cumin and mix it with the sour cream.  After many a dinner with this meal, I've found that brushing the tortillas (corn) and baking them in the oven directly on the racks until brown and crispy provides the best results... not soggy tortillas like I experienced the first time making it.  I layer as directed with those few changes and it's amazing.  My family loves it.  It also freezes well... wrap in plastic wrap and foil and when you're ready to reheat, unwrap, pop in an oiled pyrex pan, cover with foil and bake at 375 for about 45 minutes!  Thanks for a family favorite!

super amazingg!! but made some changes: first, used ten min enchilada sauce off this site (added lime juice and a tbsp of salsa to it along with fresh crushed garlic). 2nd, I sauteed chopped onion and garlic for 2 min, then threw in cubed chicken breast, red pepper flakes, cumin powder, coriander powder, salt, and fresh ime juice, and a tbsp of salsa--allowed this to cook. then added 2 chopped jalapenos and fresh chopped cilantro. next i added the black beans and mixed the sour cream in with the chicken, as other reviewers suggested. i put enchilada sauce on the bottom of my dish and also spooned it onto flour tortillas [which i dipped in olive oil and crisped until golden brown in the oven on 400], poured all of my chicken mix on top, then sprinkled cheese. i then took the remaining tortillas and crushed into giant pieces, threw them into my enchilada sauce until the sauce was all absorbed and layered them on top haphazardly. i sprinkled more cheese on top of this :) used cheddar montrey jack mix. its amazzzing.

I made this recipe last night for my husband and I. I chose it because it looked super easy to make. I was surprised at how good it was and the flavor it had. 

I actually forgot the sour cream in the layers but remembered it on top. The only change I made was to substitute out the green chile peppers because I don't like them. To keep flavor in the chicken, bean, and cilantro layer I added a little bit of green enchilada sauce. This gave the layer flavor without too much spice. 

I topped my plate of casserole off with some fresh guacamole and it hit the spot!

I have tried two other enchilada bakes and this is the best! Needed a bit of salsa on top to moisten, but otherwise a big hit for everyone from my two year old to my mother (and the three boys in between).

I have no idea why this is rated so high. The casserole was so dry and I even tried adding one more can of enchilada sauce over the top after the fact. Bottom line for me, I'll never make it again it wasn't good at all.

Hmmm...this recipe needs some depth in the flavor. Since I have to take something like this to an event soon, I'm going to play with the sauce. Enchilada sauce alone just isn't very exciting.

For aquick and easy recipe, though, it's fine.

I used crushed light corn chips instead of tortillas in the layers, and served salsa to pour on top at the table. It was great! Reheated very well, also!

Used  1 lb ground turkey instead of chicken breast, added a couple teaspoons taco seasoning, as the cumin and coriander just weren't enough to spice it up.  Omitted the diced chile peppers, but followed the rest of the recipe to a "t".  Very good!  No leftovers on this one :-)

While it's true the tortillas did get mushy (even though I tried frying them first as someone else suggested), the flavor was scrumptious! My dh loved this dish, although he suggested using it as a dip with tortilla chips. I gently explained that the tortillas were already IN the dish. LOL. Still, I have the ingredients on my grocery list to make again this week.

This was very good.  I did not have all the ingredients on hand, specifically the corn tortillas.  I made the Spanish Rice on this site, and used that in place of the tortillas.  I did add garlic (1-2t) and doubled the spices & the chicken and added a can of corn.  Used lowfat sour cream & low-fat cheddar. Everyone loved it and we have enough for another meal later in the week!

This meal was great. I did take other reviews into account when I made this meal. Because I am a vegetarian (but my guy is not) ... I used cuban black beans/corn for half and chicken/cuban black beans/corn for the other half. I also used chili powder instead or coriander and used low fat or fat free versions of any ingredients I could find (sour cream and cheese). It turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

While this tasted fantastic and I was glad to find a casserole recipe that omitted MSG-containing cream of mushroom soup,  the pieces collapsed into a pool of slop when I served it up is. The family didn't complain but I was disappointed that it wasn't more firm.

I was told this was one of my husbands favorite meals ever tonight!  And he is VERY hard to please!!  The best part, is that normally we can't agree on a recipe - I like flavor and carbs, he likes meat - this was the perfect compromise!

This was just OK.  I'm not sure if my expectations were too high or it was just a bad day (I got a stomachache afterward) but I wasn't impressed.  Too much work opening all those cans and cooking the chicken.... wasn't that good.

This is one of my favorite meals to make and it's so easy! I use the left over chicken from when I make the RoastSticky Rotisserie Chicken from all recipes, so I can skip the chicken step completely. I use corn with the black bean mixture, and green enchilada sauce instead of red. It comes out so good and takes no time at all when the chicken is already made.

Wow.  AMAZING.  I did not have any black beans, so I subbed refried (which i like better anyhow).  I also used about 3 cups of cheese because I like it really cheesy.  Added in some olives.  But delicious.  My picky daughter LOVED it!

I can't say it was as much the taste as the consistency that turned us completely off from this dish. I don't know how else to put it, but it was just not for us... any of us. Not even the cats, who normally eat anything and everything. Sorry, but I won't be making this one again. Thanks for letting us try, though!

I made the recipe as written.  I agree with others that it was sort of bland.  It needs some extra spice in it.  We had fresh salsa on hand that we dropped on top and it did the trick!

Mushy...  I bought the soft corn tortillas, that disintegrated during baking. Mush and chunky chicken/beans.

I did not think this was anything great but I must admit it did taste better the 2nd day because all the flavors had blended together.  Hubby liked it better than I did which is why it gets a 4 and not a 3.

Thought it was very tasty but very liquidy- next time I will not even do the tortillas and put the whole thing over rice.  Like I said, very tasty thought.

This is a family favorite in our house!  I like to put chicken breasts in the crockpot with some salsa and enchilada sauce, then shred.  Turns out great everytime!

Made "Charley's Slow Cooker Mexican Style Meat" on the first night and had tacos then used the left over meat for this recipe instead of the chicken.  It was outstanding!

Was a bit bland for our tastes. Maybe the addition of some chili powder and more cumin would solve it. The sour cream is hard to spread, but can't be left out.

So easy to throw together at the last minute and looks so yummy!  A comfort food/casserole.  You can switch up the herbs you use if you done have cumin or coriander, no big deal.  Next time, I will buy a rotisserie chicken instead of cooking chicken before (one less dish to clean!).  But most of the ingredients you can keep on hand for a quick dinner when you do not feel like cooking!

This was easy and very Good.  Only changes I made was to double the cumin and coriander and I added 1t chili powder and 1/2 t tumeric.  We like food with a little kick.  I also added chopped jalapenos (from a jar) on top before baking.  I will be making this again soon!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover roasted chicken and corn tortillas. I have never used enchilada sauce so I had to run to the grocery store to get that but all the other ingredients are pantry staples in my house which was convenient. The only change I made was to increase the cumin and add some onions, black olives, red pepper flakes and garlic powder to the chicken mixture. This was SO delicious. Will definitley make again when I have leftover chicken. The only issue I had was the serving size. It says it makes eight servings but I cut it into six pieces and they were still on the small side.

This was very good, and so easy. I didn't have any red enchilada sauce, and so used the green enchilada sauce I had on hand. For the cheese, I mixed Monterrey Jack cheese and Cheddar. Excellent! I can't wait to make this again, using the red enchilada sauce! Thanks for the great recipe!

So much easier than traditional method of making!! took tips from others, did chicken with garlic and lots of cumin. didn't have corriander or cilantro or sourcream. mixed in some chili powder,corn and plain greek yogurt. layered with high fiber whole wheat tortillas. (probably better w/corn though) topped with black olives. my 2yo had seconds, hubby raved! Will be using this again. Thinking of using shrimp next time, ?????

My husband said this was the best casserole I'd ever made.  I made it pretty much like the recipe except used flour tortillas (because I had them on hand), more chicken, more sour cream, more green chilies, and more enchilada sauce.  I guess I just 11/2 timed the recipe.  Anyway, it was delicious.  Will definitely make it again.

Wonderful! I only made slight changes. I had leftover rotisserie chicken to use up, so I used 2 cups of the cooked chicken. I toasted the spices with cooking spray, then mixed the chicken in. From there, I followed the recipe and I'm really happy with the way it turned out. This is a keeper. (OK, one other change- we think cilantro tastes like soap, so I used green onions instead)

This is one of my favorite things to make! I use already cooked rotisserie chicken to make it easier and just mix the spices in without having to saute them.

Amazing!  Loved every bite and sent it on to the family, and they raved about it too.  Made it with ground turkey and added corn to the recipe, you could throw anything in to the mix.  Awesome, thank you :0)

This was first time to use coriander/cumin and thought the flavor was just right if you're not a spicy person. I almost forgot the cilantro (love the smell) & put it in on the 2nd layer though after reading about cilantro (yes i googled it) it's best to wait til the end since it doesn't hold up to heat. I didn't have the right pan & used a 9X17 which left me with more sauce so next time I will use my 8x8 pan or larger tortillas. I served it with sweet corn bread which was a great side. Easy to make, great flavor, will definitely make again perhaps the traditional way versus mexican lasagna.

My family gave this 5 stars!! I did make a few changes per other reviews. I sauteed chicken, red bell pepper, onion & garlic in canola oil & seasoned with taco seasoning(off this site:). I added 1/2 can rotel, and 1/3 bag frozen corn & eliminated ground coriander(didn't have any). I cooked the corn tortillas in oil till they crisped up just a bit. I shredded my own cheese blend of mozz & cheddar. I also made my own enchilada sauce(off this site:) We added the sour cream on the side, and served with spanish rice. Made for a great dinner! Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  This was easy and fabulous.  I can't wait to make it again.  Went really well with the "Ultimate Strawberry Margaritas" from this site. :)

This was REALLY good!  Not to mention easy to make...especially for someone who burns water.  I love authentic Mexican food and was leary to try (I'm not a fan of black beans) but this surprised me.  It had just enough spice, with a little kick, but not overwhelming.  I think I'll try shredded chicken next time instead of diced, because I WILL be making this again.

Not near enough spice, needs some oomph but is an excellent base. I suggest adding garlic, onion powder, chili powder, a chipotle pepper, more cumin, and more coriander. But not a bad start.

Absolutely amazing. I made it last night and just finished some for lunch! I did change a few things though. I added 1/3 tsp. of GARLIC POWDER, 1/3 tsp. of SALT, 1/3 tsp. of CHILI POWDER, 1/3 tsp. of SAZON GOYA (with coriander and annato [for more of an authentic mexican taste]), 1/3 tsp. of PEPPER, 1/2 of an ONION, and 1 clove of GARLIC. I added all the above while seasoning the chicken. I also accidentally put in a 10 oz. can of green chiles with tomatoes (Rotel) and it came out great,   I would definitely recommend it to others!

The whole family loved it! I have made it twice.  The first time I didn't have any enchilada sauce so I used can of tomato sauce mixed with taco seasoning.  The second time I used a can of enchilada sauce but the family and I  thought it was too liquidity so next time I will go back to using the tomato sauce with taco seasoning.

This recipe took a little too long for a weeknight dinner, but it was definitely worth the wait.  So, so good.  My husband and I both had seconds, and I can't wait to eat more for lunch tomorrow!  I made really minor changes like extra spices on the chicken, fresh jalapeno instead of canned chiles, and reduced-fat cheese and sour cream.  I'm sure that the recipe is perfect exactly as written.

Wonderful recipe. I've made it both for my family and for guests and received compliments both times. I was worried that the tortilla shells might make it a little chewy, but they soften up so much that thye become like cooked pasta. Next time I'm going to add some black olives to the top too.

Wonderful Recipe!  The only change I made was to hand shred a store bought rotisserie chicken instead of using white breast meat.  The added flavor and texture was GREAT.  That is not to say that this recipe is not good on its own because it is.  This one is also good the second day after the flovors have had a chance to meld.  Thanks!

Wow!  This was delicious!  Easy to prepare, although not very quick.  Made 2 small changes:  No chile peppers - not a fan of those.  Also, used white American cheese for the first layer of cheese, which is used a lot in Mexican restaurants.  Fabulous.  Oh, and I used and 8x8 dish instead of 9x7, because that's what I have.  Worked out great.  Says it makes 8 servings.  But between me and DH, we ate all but 1 small serving!  Definitely a keeper for me.

Awesome!  My husband doesn't often demand I make something again, but this one made the list.  I didn't make any changes except adding a little corn.  I may add some Frank's hot sauce or cayenne next time to give it a little more kick!

We enjoyed this dish..I did make a few changes though. I used taco seasoning in place of the spices just a couple shakes. I used kidney beans just because that is what I had on hand. And last I used a spoon of sour cream mixed in with the chicken mixture because I didn't have enough. I will make it like this again.  Great forgiving recipe!

Very good and won rave reviews from my 12 year old.  I did have to change a few things...used flour tortillas instead of corn and didn't use the green chilies.  Oh, and I used a taco seasoning pack instead of the other seasoning because it was easier.  Great flavor will definitely make this again!

This dish was pretty good, but if I make it again I will definitely spruce it up a bit. The chicken was bland so I recommend adding cumin, garlic, and onion- and maybe even chili powder.

This was ok, but a little bland for my taste. The tortillas should definitely be fried before layering them because they're just mushy otherwise. Could hardly tell they were in there. So I ended up heating more corn tortillas and spooning the casserole into them and topping with some hot sauce and eating like a taco. That made it better.

Very good. I served it with lettuce, green peppers, red onions, black olives and sour cream. I omitted the sour cream from the recipe so I could put it on top. I would have sprinkled more cilantro on top if I had any. I used flour tortillas rather than corn. I like the idea of topping it with avocado!! I will try that the next time I make it.

Great recipe!  I gave it 4 stars only because I added corn, jalepanos, onion and green peppers to the chicken/bean mix.  With the things I added I'd give it a 5!  I also used toasted yellow corn tortillas. Thanks

This is a "keeper" recipe.  I think you could add corn or whatever to this and it would be great!  It is great as is too.

This was very tasty, and my husband LOVED it. I used leftover dark meat chicken from the Roast Sticky Chicken Rotisserie Style recipe from this site so my chicken was already cooked & seasoned but I reheated it in the cumin/coriander anyway. I pre-warmed my corn tortillas in the oven as suggested but I'm not sure corn tortillas really need it. They dissolve pretty fast (and by dissolve I do NOT mean get wet & slimy like flour tortillas--I mean they dissolve.) I also used canned black beans with onions, one of the really really huge cans. I forgot to use the cilantro entirely and we didn't notice anything "missing" although I will surely use it next time as I really like cilantro. Lastly, I used only about 4 oz of fat-free sour cream and served the rest on the side. I spread the layers of sour cream extremely thin because I dislike sour cream myself but I could tell the spice of the Red Enchilada Sauce (from this site) required cooling. I suggest to anyone that they try their hand at making their own enchilada sauce--it's so tasty, and you can adjust it to your own taste!

If you are looking for a tasty Mexican dish to make a day ahead of time this is a great recipe.  I followed another reviewers advice and baked the corn torillas to help them stay crispy.  I thought the recipe could use a little more enchilada sauce but it got great reviews from the three different homes that I brought the casserole.  Along with the casserole I brought spanish rice, refried beans and mexicorn.  I also gave them lettuce, tomatoes, onions, black olives, salsa and sour cream to make a complete meal.

Yummm... this was really excellent.  I was hoping for leftovers, but everyone went back for seconds.  I slow cooked the chicken in taco seasoning in the crock pot, then pulled it for better texture in the casserole. Delicious!

Made this for company and it was delicious!  To save some time, I substituted a fresh store-bought rotisserie chicken that I shredded for the chicken breasts.  I probably won't do that again as the chicken was a bit too soft after heating it with the spices, chilis and beans.  I also toasted the tortillas in the oven like some other reviewers suggested.  Served this with a wonderful caesar salad and everyone went back for seconds! I'll definitely make this again.  It's a great recipe for a casual dinner with friends.

Delicious mexican casserole. I assembled it in the morning and kept it in the fridge until an hour before diner.  I added some sauteed onions and garlic with the chicken. Leftovers tasted even better the next day. I plan to make this quite often. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Ive used this recipe over and over, from family events to catering - it always is a hit.  I do add 1/2 cup of diced onions or scallions in with the beans and peppers.  One of my stand-by recipes.

Excellent! I loved this dish. I only used sour cream for the top layer to cut down on the creaminess (personal preference). I could also see onions and rice being excellent additions to this recipe.

This is SUPER easy to make. Great for a beginning cook. The only thing(s) I would change:
Add salt to the chicken when you are cooking it. Never be afraid to add more cumin (to anything) if you like it. Also, I think it's a little heavy on the sour cream. Unless you're one of those people that eats sour cream with everything. 
Also - I accidentally picked up black bean refried beans instead of regular black beans... I think it might even be better this way. Try it. 
Oh yeah, and if you like a kick, I added 2 fresh serranos into the chicken mix. Next time I'll probably add 3 or 4.

The flavours in this dish were really great, the only problem I had was the tortillas ending up mushy, so maybe I would toast them first.

Made this to use up leftover rotisserie chicken, which I diced and used cold in the mixing bowl. Followed the recipe except for adding more spices and substituting dried cilantro for fresh, using crushed tostito chips, and no sour cream. Added some frozen corn kernels and diced onion into the mix along with 1/2 cup Pace Picante for more heat. It fit into a 9x9 glass casserole dish, covered with foil to bake. This is a good recipe as is, to alter a bit to suit your own taste, or to use whatever you have on hand. Goes together fast and my husband enjoyed it. "Make it again" says it all!

Yummmmy!  This was soo good!  For being a casserole it wasn't so heavy and gooey.  Perfect!  I stuck with the recipe mostly.  I didn't measure the amount of cilantro, so I probably added more (we love cilantro).  I seasoned the chicken a bit more with other spices (chili powder, cumin, salt, pepper, a bit of whole coriander - i don't like it much, onion powder, garlic powder).  The only major change was adding onions.  I cut up 1/4 of a laarrgge onion and mixed it in with the chicken/bean mixture.  I left them raw so when eating the casserole it added a bit of crunch and freshness to the dish!  Try it with onions, it's wonderful!  My husband and two year old LOVED this dish and were begging for more!  Also served it with spanish rice. Oh! one more thing - I am not a fan of enchilada sauce, but the flavors all meld together perfectly and the sauce was very good.

I prepared this the night before and cooked the next day for an office luncheon. Excellent with rave reviews from my co-workers!  The only change I made was to use green enchilada sauce instead of the red.

I followed the recipe with the exception of the size pan. I used a square glass casserole as well as a rubbermaid Premier non staining 9-cup container (as the accompanying video did). I put the Rubbermaid container in the freezer for future use and baked the other. We were only feeding four people and it was more than enough. The dish came out great. I was afraid that the whole thing would turn out soggy but it did not. the sides and top were slightly crispy. The cheese was melted perfectly and the combination of the flavors were perfectly Mexican! We let the dish sit for 15 minutes before cutting and it held its shape. We added a dollop of sour cream and sliced olives to the top and served as is. I will be making this recipe many more times, I'm sure.

This is awesome - it's easy and cooks fairly quickly.  Have made this 3 times now and the whole family loves it.  The last time through I took shortcuts: (1)Used a rotissirie chicken, and (2) stirred all the sour cream into the chicken, no noticeable difference. This recipe fed 3 adults and 2 children with a little bit left over.

Definitely a household favorite of ours.  I love how you can add/remove different items based on what you have on hand.  I like to add canned corn and black olives, and I do toast the tortillas like other have mentioned.

This was AMAZING. Easy but time- consuming.  I made a few changes according to taste. I did not use green chilis, I poached the chicken for several minutes, shredded it, then added fresh lime juice, salt, pepper, cumin and corriander. I mixed the chicken with the blackbeans, diced onion and garlic, lots of cilantro and sour cream. I also added a can of drained yellow corn. Crisped the tortillas in the oven, used store-bought enchillda sauce. followed the recipe after that.  It took me about 40 minutes to put it together, plus 40 minutes oven time and 10 minutes cooling. I served it on top of 10-min brown rice. It was a hit w/my hubby and my brother. Great for Monday night football!

This is a good base recipe that you can tweak to suit your families tastes.  I opted to bake my chicken with the seasonings (added garlic powder and chili powder) instead of frying in a pan.  I diced some red bell pepper and onion and cooked till soft in some olive oil and added this into the chicken mixture.  I omitted the sour cream from the top layer and topped the casserole with sliced olives.  You can assemble this ahead and refrigerate.  I served this with chopped tomato, shredded lettuce, sour cream and tortilla chips.

Excellent recipe!  Hubby and I loved it! I did leave the sour cream out but put it on top when it was done cooking.  I also used cumin and chili powder on the chicken instead of the other spices.

We really enjoyed this dish.  I did leave out the cilantro as we do not care for the taste.  Thanks for sharing.

This is such a flavorful recipe, and it is so easy to make. I added one can of corn and 1/2 a diced onion to this recipe. We always use corn tortillas (lower fat than flour tortillas), and we always warm them just a bit in the oven before using them in any recipe. 
What a great thing to bake! Thanks for posting this recipe!

The proportions in this seemed wrong too me -- the sauce overpowered everything else.  We may try this again with a homemade sauce rather than one from a can to see if that helps.

This recipe was great! I added more cheese and more sour cream than the recipe called for, and I cooked the corn tortillas in the oven for a little while, so they wouldn't get mushy. It turned out great and the leftovers were gone in a day.

Hmmm...this was definitely easy and fairly quick but it was a little to tangy or something. I think the cumin AND coriander was a bit too much, I think either/or would be enough. I also didn't have enchilada sauce or green chiles so I substituted a can of Mexican diced tomatoes (ran it through the blender first) so maybe that contributed to the tangy, metallic flavor. Plus, the black beans didn't cook all the way so they were crunchy. This was a good idea and worth a try but I don't think I'll try it again since no one else liked it.

I used green enchilada sauce instead of the red and like the gentler flavor with the chicken.  It is not so overpowering.  Otherwise, great recipe!

My husband is raving about this! He said "I can't believe my wife can make good Mexican food!" He said to make sure I write down everything I did so I can do it again. The only things I did differently were to cook the tortillas in the oven for a few mins as others had suggested. I also used 10 tortillas to cover a 13 x 9 pan (didn't have 11 x 7). I used chicken thighs because that's what I had and quickly poached the chicken with the same spices as are in this recipe. Also sprinkled each layer with green onions and black olives. I used the regular Old El Paso red enchilada sauce. I'd say I'd like to try it with the green but not sure my husband will let me! Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  I made it exactly as directed.  The flavors were great and hubby says it's a keeper!  It was a bit time consuming for my liking, so I think next time I'll "cheat" and use canned chicken.   Thanks for a great recipe!  Will definitely make again.

The recipe is wonderful as written. I have tried it with mixing the sour cream with the enchilada sauce and cheese and it made a creamier sauce.  I've also used shredded pepper jack and it spices the recipe up nicely.

I baked the tortillas and they didn't disappear. For me it wasn't a long process at all--saute chicken with onions and spices, add corn, beans, & Greek yogurt, layer as per recipe, bake, and voila!  excellent. Persnickety husband had two helpings. I like things oil-free or oil-light and this one adapts well to that.

I have a habit of using recipes for inspiration,then using what I have on hand-it works for me. I used Alaskan caribou,[marinated,slow cooked,then ground] mixed w/ground beef,cooked w/onions,cumin,taco seasoning,then layered as in recipe above,adding jalapenos,yellow rice,& corn in w/ black bean layer-extra pico de guyo under 2nd round of tortillas as well as under top layer of cheese. Loaded it w/sharp cheddar! Used cast iron pot! Served w/chopped lettuce,extra pico,sour cream,& black olives-YUM

This was a hiit with my husband & teenage son. I did not toast the tortillas & it was just fine. I did add onions,  garlic & chili powder. I also shredded the chicken instead of dicing them.  We topped it with chopped lettuce & sour cream. Delicious!

THE BEST! I have never rated a recipe on here because I allways make some type of small change to them, but this one I had to. I did make some changes but it was by far the best ever. Toasted the White corn tortillas first, used a lasagna pan, and layered all like. All though the smells are vey tempting to cut into it as soon as it is done baking, you must let it set for about 15 minutes.

The dish turned out so fantastic...definitely the best enchilada casserole I have ever had. Mixed the sour cream in with the beans and diced chiles...and also toasted the tortillas in the oven.  Both suggestions came from other cooks - thank you!!!  Rave reviews by my little dinner party.  Oh, and also loved the avocado on top for a few minutes in the oven...really added to the authenticity of the dish :)

I must admit, i am reviewing this recipe with a BUNCH of changes! 
I used chicken thighs, didnt have cilantro, used pinto beans instead of black beans, didnt have green chiles, and also didnt have sour cream so i used cream cheese instead.... It turned out GREAT!!!! 

Easy, quick foundation recipe that can be modified to suite what you have in your pantry.

When I was putting this together my husband said he wasn't going to eat it. He then proceeded to polish it off. He loved it. And well, I loved be right. Next time I'll add more chicken and cheese just to suit our taste. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

This was very tasty. Enchilada sauce is pretty spicy, so I was shocked when my picky 12-yr-old ate her whole serving as well. We added black olives and used a smaller dish, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. A keeper for sure.

This is a great recipe! It's super easy especially if you pre-cook your chicken.  I cooked a chopped onion with the chicken, and mixed half of the chicken/bean mixture with the sour cream and half of the cheese instead of trying to spread them all in the pan separately.  I didn't put any sour cream on the top layer, just served it on the side with the meal.  I used all cheddar cheese and it turned out great!  I also took another reviewer's advice and toasted the tortillas in the oven at 400 for about 3 minutes a side.  Will definitely be making this again and again!

We are corn free, so I supplemented the tortillas for brown rice tortillas and it was amazing.  Also, I'm not a huge fan of canned or jarred sauces, so I made mine off of the first recipe given by allrecipes; again, it was amazing.  All four of my kids asked me if I could make this tomorrow night!

Awesome. I used a 9x13" pan and increased the tortillas to 16 (8 on botton overlapping and 8 for next layer.)  I skipped coriander..didnt have any on hand. Didnt matter, still delicous. Rinsed beans, for anyone wondering!

I want you to know that I tried really hard not to tweak, and I really did only make 2 TINY changes!  I used a mixture of Cotija, Pepper Jack and Cheddar, since I didn't have any Mexican blend cheese, and I added about twice the amount of cilantro.  This was very tasty.  The only reason for marking it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the tortillas were a little mushy.  It does save some time to layer instead of roll enchiladas, so if you are a purist, this will give you a good enchilada flavor, but not a very good texture.  Since I didn't have the inclination to do the more labor-intensive enchiladas, this was pretty good.

This was just ok. I made exactly as directed and it came out dry and the flavor was just so-so. Maybe next time i wont drain the beans and will add more spices. With a little tweaking this recipe could be really good.

Very very good dish. The beans straight from the can to the dish, still left them a bit crunchy even after being in the oven for a while. Simple & delicious.

This isn't a bad recipie but next time I think I'll just make enchilads instead of the layering It was very soupy. I did change 2 things I used a can of drained rotel because I didn't have chilies and I added corn to the mixture. It tastes great I just like the indivual enchilades better than the layered technique.

i took this to a pot luck at work. everyone loved it. I used slow cooked tinga (spicy pork) instead of chicken. i doubled up on the tortillas because of the other comments about them disappearing in with the rest of the ingredients. I also left the cilantro and the sour cream til the end. I would use more sauce next time to compensate for that though as the end result was a little dry.

Maybe I did something wrong but the sour cream curdled and it was real sloppy and had to be scooped from the pan.   I will try a variation using refried beans leave the sour cream for the finished product..the family ate it but asked NOT to have to eat left overs...It got 3 stars because I am not 100% sure I didn't do something wrong!  I ended up feeding all the left overs to the chickens!

Quite tasty...I added more sauce per the advice of other reviewers.  My only issue was that the corn tortillas turned to mush.  Didn't affect the flavor, but the texture bothered me, and it wasn't very pretty.  Next time I think I'll try whole-wheat tortillas.

This is one of my new favorites. Delicious, quick and easy. I did what one of other reviewers did and spread s/c over the tortillas, great suggestion. Instead on enchilada sauce I used Curry Simmer Sauce (was a special buy from Aldi). Made is sooo flavorful! This is a favorite for sure. Freezes well also.

This was very easy to make and turned out well.  I made as directed except that I used leftover cooked chicken that I had from a full roaster chicken.  I had no trouble with the corn tortillas "disappearing" and the casserole cut nicely into squares after I left it rest for 10 minutes.

Made it exactly and loved it.  Reheats well and seems more flavorful as leftovers.  Second time I made it with ground beef and it was good too.

I made a serving for twelve so that I could use a 9 x 13 pan.  I screwed up and assembled the whole recipe, instead of just stopping at the second chicken layer, coooking and then adding the rest of the cheese and sour cream. I don't think it made a difference. I'm not sure how anyone could spread the sour cream over the whole loose mess, so I just added little plops of it all over. I probably only used about half of it. I also saved time and used rostisserie chicken. The whole thing came out a little to soupy for my liking and the flavor was pretty bland. It was almost like you would want to serve it over rice. Maybe a spicier sauce could help. As far as Mexican casseroles go we like the Taco Lasagna better.

ADD MORE SAUCE. This was dry b/c the corn tortillas soaked up all of the little bit of sauce the recipe called for. I would use 2 cans if I ever make this again. It was just ok.

I just made this for the first time. The recipe as it stands seems a little on the mild side for my taste. However, it was a delicious dish. I think next time I will deviate from the original to kick up the spice factor a notch.

I improvised a few things but it still turned out to be a family favorite.  I exchanged jar salsa for the enchilada sauce and reduced the amount of sour cream.  I used store bought grilled chicken and some fajita spices to flavor the meat.  It was quick and easy and satisfying.

I did not find this bland at all.  I used the "medium" enchilada sauce and not the "mild", so maybe that helped.  I did just use taco seasoning from a packet to season the chicken when I sauteed it instead of the cumin & coriander, since I had no coriander.  As suggested by another reviewer, I added the sour cream to the chicken mixture.  I also added chopped onion and garlic powder and a little corn I had left in the freezer.  The end result was very good.  Next time I will probably double up on the tortillas to give it some substance, I couldn't really taste any tortillas, they seemed to dissolve into the other ingredients.  All in all, this was pretty good and will make again.

Excellent! The only changes I made were to use flour tortillas (just because I didn't have enough corn ones) and I added crumbled queso fresco to the shredded cheese layer. The cilantro gives a refreshing flavor to an otherwise heavy dish. Thanks! :)

A good, solid recipe. I only used one can of enchilada sauce because another one would have overflowed my 11x7 inch pan, but next time I will use a larger size pan and use both cans because the result as a tad dry. Also, I prefer my sour cream to be cold, so I served it as a side--this may also have affected the moisture content of the dish. All in all, the final product was also slightly bland--next time I think I'll throw in some more spices and garlic.

The tortillas were soggy.  This might be better if cooked in a slow cooker and served with corn chips as an appetizer.

This recipe was SO good!  I didn't have any cumin or coriander so I just used taco seasoning for the chicken.  I'm not a big fan of cilantro but I added it anyways...and loved it!  Super simple, super affordable - great recipe all around.

This was delicious.  I added about a half tsp of chili powder which gave it a nice kick.  I also added red pepper flakes and corn.  Next time I make this recipe (which I will) I might substitute the green chile peppers for diced jalapeno peppers to add even more of a kick, but I do like things spicy.

Very tasty!  Just to be easy, I sprinkled maybe half a taco seasoning packet and some extra chile powder on the chicken and chopped onion as it sauted.  And to be even more lazy, I threw the chicken/onion in a bowl with the rest of the items including the cheese and sour cream and then scooped it all in layers with the tortillas in the pyrex.  YUM indeed!

This turned out very good although I will admit I screwed it up :0) I forgot to put the second layer of the tortillas in the casseroles and didn't even remember it until we sat down to eat it! The bottom layer of the tortillas pretty much dissolved for us though so I don't know how much of a difference it really made. We were left with more of a chicken mixture and I ended up serving it over rice. I did add a some diced onion while I was cooking the chicken and threw in some corn to the whole mix. The kids loved it though and anytime I get a meal that everyone eats I'm happy with the outcome!

I made several substitutions based on reviews here. I used black beans instead of corn, I cooked the skinless chicken breasts in the crock pot, I substituted a red bell pepper for the canned chile peppers, I added 1/4 cup of raw brown rice, and I forgot to buy cilantro. I was excellent but next time I will try to remember the cilantro as I think it would be a good addition. I can't really rate the original recipe as I made too many modifications.

I made this recipe today.   I read through a lot of the other reviews and decided to change the recipe just a little.   I used the best tortillas... If you are from CA you can buy, La Tortilla Factory Yellow Corn. They are thick & delicious. They don't dissolve in the cooking process. I did stick them in the oven for about 5 mins prior to layering. My dinner guests were satisfied. It was especially funny to some because it resembled a giant enchilada.  I would recommend this dish to anyone serving a large group or a lot of hungry children!  Suggestion: Use a chicken taco seasoning; and use fresh chicken, not the deli rotisserie! It cooks very quick when you slice it up and saute it. Then just use two forks to shred the chicken after you simmered it with the seasonings.

5 stars from every member of our family of 4!!!  I used Rosarita canned enchilada sauce.  Left out the green chiles for my picky 7 year old.  Didn't have any coriander so just didn't use any.  Served it with cornbread and it was excellent!  This is a new favorite for my family.

Loved it!  My kids did, too!  I quickly figured out that this is essentially a Mexican version of lasagna, with tortillas instead of noodles.  I have one child who hates stuff that is too spicy, but he loved this and begged for more!  My husband and I loved it too and put sour cream and hot salsa on top for a kick.

Very good!  Made a few changes that I think pushed this recipe from 4 stars to 5. Here's what I did differently . . . 1. Seasoned the chicken with Lawry's seasoning salt (any seasoning salt would probably do) prior to cooking. 2. I did NOT add any other spices while cooking the chicken. I mixed those in later. 3. Cooked 1/2 cup, maybe more, of diced onions with the chicken. 4. Drained my chicken mixture and added it to a small bowl with black beans, green chile peppers. 5. Here are the spices I used: 1 1/2 tbsp dried cilantro, 1/4 tsp each of garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and 1 tsp each of chili powder and cumin. 6. I also added about 1/4 c (1 small can) of diced black olives. 7. Let my mixture sit overnight b/c I didn't have enough time to cook it! 8. The next day I added the sour cream and the cheese directly to my chicken mixture. Followed the sauce/layer directions 9. Baked in a round pyrex bowl using two whole wheat tortillas per layer. 10. Topped with whatever salsa I had left in the fridge! 11. B/C of the bulk, would more cooking time while covered with foil -- otherwise the layers won't be all the way warmed.

Loved it!  Was really easy to make and TASTY, but next time I make them I think I will alter the recipe a bit and figure out a way to make a meatless version, my family just tends to prefer less meat.

This was much better than I expected as I was making it.  I used half the amount of cheese to lighten it up a bit.  I think the key is to use an enchilada sauce that has the flavor you like.  Definitely would make again as this was easy and very tasty- between two of us we barely had leftovers.

3.5 stars. A bit bland.  Needs salt.  I used left-over rotisserie chicken, so it was easy to make.  I used jalapenos instead of chilis, lite sour cream, and added garlic, chili powder, green onions, and salt.  I didn't like the consistency of the corn tortillas in this-- they turned out a bit mushy and bland.  I might suggest substituting cream of chicken soup instead of sour cream.  I probably won't make this again.

This was a really easy and delicious casserole.  I seasoned the chicken with my own spices including fajita seasoning, garlic powder, and Lawry's Seasoned Salt.  We served it with mexican rice and guacamole on the side. I would definitely make this again.

I really wanted to like this, but I just can't make myself. I am just one of those people who doesn't like mexican casseroles and layered mexican dishes, I would have much rather used the chicken mixture to make burritos or something. The only things I did differently was to boil my chicken breast then shred it. I cooked the shredded chicken with an onion along with the cumin and coriander called for and garlic powder, chili powder and cayenne pepper that wasn't called for. I added the black beans and green chiles to the chicken, the chicken was realllly good. The only other thing I did differently was to fry my tortillas first in hopes that they wouldn't be soggy, but they still were. Oh well I gave it a try and I don't think I will attemp anymore of these types of dishes. Thanks anyways!! Everyone else seems to love them.  ***** edit ******* I changed my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars because I just talked to my boyfriend to see if he liked it last night and he said it was "the bomb" so like I said everyone else seems to like them.

I wasn't really impressed by this dish. I made it almost exactly to the specs (I added a little more cumin than called for) and just felt like it tasted like nothing but sour cream and black beans. My husband thoroughly enjoyed it, but it was just "meh" for me. I used Old El Paso enchilada sauce, so I thought that if anything would save it...but it was very blah. To kick it up a bit, I would recommend some serious flavor upgrades if you are considering making this...much more cumin and corinader, add some chili powder, and a little onion flavoring. I don't think this will be part of my regular rotation (unless DH requests it), but it was something new to try. Thanks anyway!

Excellent, even though I screwed up the recipe a bit. I accidentally put the cheese and sour cream on top before baking, realized what I did and tried to scrape off making a mess, then tried to add it back on in the last 10 min. Also used jalapenos instead of chiles and hot enchilada sauce rather than the norm. Also just shredded some seasoned rotisserie chicken rather than cooking my own. With my little blunders or changes it was still wonderful, so I am sure once I make it 100% as it should be it will be even better. *** TO ALL THOSE OUT THERE THAWING, SEASONING AND COOKING FROZEN CHICKEN - save money, time and flavor by using a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken. I picked one up at the grocerty store for only $2.50 and now I have pre cooked and seasoned chicken for all my chicken dishes/casseroles this week. They also make a good quick chicken taco. ****UPDATE: Just found out the hubby totally HATED this... he must have just been trying to be nice when he didn't tell me right away. I still thought it was great but he told me not to make it again :( I will blame his poor desire for Mexican food rather than the recipe itself.

I thought this was delicious! I sauteed some red onion in with the chicken and added a little garlic.  I also only added the sour cream as a topping.  Might fine mexican casserole!

I've made this with flour and corn tortillas; sometimes both depending on how many I have on hand. Have never used corriander because I never have it. This is a family staple.

This was SO yummy! I followed previous reviews and added some corn.  Also, I used a rotisserie turkey breast and shredded it.   Topped with fresh avocado slices...MMmmmm  Super easy and delicious.

Not bad, but kind of boring. I would recommend toasting the tortillas to give it a little more texture.

We loved this recipe! Quick and easy to do! My adjustments: I used 2 packages of ready-cooked chicken (i.e. Tyson) instead of cooking the chicken myself. This simplified the recipe for me and made the preparation quicker. I also didn't use sour cream, as it was not on-hand. I followed the recipe ingredient amounts as listed and found that it made 4-5 hearty servings and not 8 (just to keep that in mind). I think I will try this next time with corn, as some other users have done and enjoyed. This recipe will stay in my recipe book!

The only change I made was adding some scallions. Also, I left out the cheese and sour cream because my hubby is allergic. I added it on my serving after and it was wonderful both ways!

We thought this was great. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't make any changes. The next time I make it, however, I think I will double the ingredients so I can add a couple of extra layers. It didn't seem to be thick enough to be a casserole as written.

Very easy using left over chicken, canned enchilada sauce, and added Mexican Ro-tel tomatoes, drained for a little kick.  Toasting the tortillas for a couple of minutes was a great idea!!  Sure kept them from falling apart.  If you like fresh cilantro, a handful is the perfect addition.

I made "salsa chicken burrito filling" from this website the other day and needed a dish to use the leftovers in and this was perfect.  I made my own sauce by simmering a can of tomato sauce with chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, s and p, and chicken broth for about 15 minutes.  In my opinion, the corn tortillas are a MUST.  Like another reviewer said, they disintegrate into the filling and impart a really nice flavor throughout.  It tasted exactly like enchiladas but I didn't have to do the labor intensive task of filling individual shells.

Pretty good...I took others' suggestions and added 1 c. of corn, substituted chili powder for coriander, sauted garlic and onion with the chicken and toasted the tortillas.  It was a nice change from the usual ground beef and refried bean enchiladas.

Delicious! I found canned black beans with diced jalepenos so I left out the chiles. My only complaint was that it was a bit runny.

This was delicious and I will definitely be making it again. Unfortunately, I didn't have black beans on hand so I used dark red kidney beans instead. It turned out wonderful just the same. Next time I might use them along with the black beans. I also added some corn based on others' recommendations. And based on personal preference, I like a lot of gravy, I used about fifty percent more enchillada sauce and sour cream. It was very yummy. My husband (who was making disgusted faces during the entire preparation...at one point even asked if that's the way it is usually made) went back for seconds and thirds. Even my six-year-old daughter loved it and asked for the leftovers for lunch the next day. A definite keeper! Thanks

This was terrific and it hit the spot. So easy to put together too and a nice rich result. It was plenty spicy, I can't imagine adding more spice or another can of chiles, as some have mentioned. I think adding more spice would make it inedible. I had homemade guacomole on the side. The hubster doesn't care for sour cream. We had leftovers all week. It was just as good on the last day as the first.

DH says this was excellent.  I don't eat things like this but loved the ease of preparation (I actually did it just like the video suggested).  It smelled wonderful as it cooked in the microwave.  Make sure to give it the full 10 minutes to set up after taking it out of the microwave.  Thanks for a super easy, fast weeknight dinner.

I think I'd use salsa rather than enchilada sauce next time - it was a bit bland for my family's tastes.  I baked the corn tortillas which kept them  crisper than they would have been had I not baked them.  Will tweak this a bit next time - great basic recipe!

This was so good and to make it even easier I used shredded chicken from a roasted chicken purchased at the grocery store.  Couldn't be easier.  Everyone liked and there were no leftovers.

We really enjoy this recipe.  I prefer the taste of chicken thighs to breasts for this dish (plus it saves some money).  If you don't mind a little more work and mess, it comes out very well if you fry the tortillas before adding them.

Served with cilantro rice and your favorite salsa, this is a great meal! 
I didn't have green chilies or Mexican cheese blend, so I sub'd 2 chipotle  peppers and sharp cheddar. I also left the sour cream for on top after cooking (actually I forgot it in the first layer).  I also didn't have any chicken so I used leftover shredded pork shoulder. Next time I"ll make it as the recipe calls!
Like other reviewers I see lots of room for variation with this dish, which I like.

Looks and tastes great but like others I added corn to the black bean/chicken mix.  Also I made my own Tomatilla sauce and used that instead of the Enchilada sauce.  I also didn't add the green chilies after I tasted the Tomatilla sauce with the two Serrano peppers.  I made my casserole for 16 people.  Very good.

Big hit in my house- used 1/2 package taco mix + 1/2 cup water and heated with pre-cooked shredded chicken. Also, I couldn't find corn tortillas (as others recommended), so I used corn tortilla chips layered- this was fine- they got soft, but added nice flavor- it was definitely a casserole consistency, with great flavor. Will be doing again!

I made this for dinner tonight. I didnt have a few of the original ingredients. I had to use chili seasoning and I didnt have the chiles or sour cream. It was delicious. I served it with chips and everyone chowed it down. I think this is a great recipe to play around with. Get creative and make it your own.

This was pretty good, and lends itself to lots of variation depending on what's on hand.  MY 14-year-old made it on his Friday cooking night.

My whole family really liked this. I didn't have coriander or cilantro so I subbed parsley & pepper. I only had green sauce & sharp cheddar. It worked, it was really easy & good. I'm looking forward to leftovers for lunch.

Delicious!  I used green enchilada sauce because I had it in the pantry and pre-cooked chicken from the grocery store.

This was delicious! I did make a few changes: canned chipotle peppers instead of green chilis, added a little crushed garlic when cooking the chicken, hot instead of mild enchilada sauce, and a couple of chopped jalapenos. The chipotles added a smoky flavor that was especially good w/ that fresh cilantro. The only thing was that the casserole was a little spicy for my husband, with the jalapenos and hot enchilada sauce, too. Next time I'll put jalapenos on the side and use mild enchilada sauce if I use chipotle peppers. But for those of us who like it hot: YUM!

I'm not crazy about this recipe. I used leftover turkey instead of chicken which may be part of the reason. I would definetely use chicken if I made it again. Overall, this recipe is ok- nothing too special and not that easy considering you need to shred the chicken.

I give this 4 stars and my husband gives it 5! 

The first time I made this, I used ingredients already on hand, so this is what we did:
- Canned, drained Tyson chicken breast
- Corriander seeds instead of cilantro (just a few shakes)
- Skip the green chiles (put in some salsa instead)
- Subbed a smooth salsa for enchilada sauce.

We liked it so much that we just stuck with it! Sometimes we use the sour cream, sometimes we don't. It's good either way!

Thanks for the recipe, it's a regular in our home now!

This was delicious!!:] And so easy to make. I doubled up on everything to make sure I had enough for my family. I also added onions (sauteed with the chicken). I do have to admit I cheated though...I bought a whole roasted chicken, shredded it and added it to the sauteed onions. It really cuts down on time instead of cooking the chicken. Its also a lot more tender and juicier.  I also added white corn to the mix. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!;]

This was an excellent recipe. The only reason it got 4 stars is because I changed the directions a little, used homemade enchilada sauce (what a difference) and added a cup of cheese. I made this dish on a Friday night so opted for a rotisserie chicken and cubed it, mixed in the chiles, cilantro, black beans, and sour creme. I used the Enchilada sauce off the website with the cinnamon and chocolate (excellent) Poured about 1/2 cup into dish, layed two corn tortillas down and topped with chicken mixture, cheese, and more sauce. Repeated layers one more time and then topped with another layer of corn tortillas, sauce and cheese. Covered in foil and baked for 30 mins. Let rest 10 mins. I served with spanish rice and a green salad. Everyone loved it!!!

The husband and I both really liked this. In the past, I've made the very similar Burrito Pie (from this site) but I wanted to try something lighter and healthier (i.e., chicken instead of beef, black beans instead of refried beans). Tasted yummy, and he said it was even better for lunch the next day.

It was okay, definitely not my favorite enchilada recipe.  The consistency wasn't right and the tortillas came out extraordinarily soggy.  Not too sure what went wrong!

So I did this as recommended on the "Budget Cooking" tab, and put it together then froze for later use.  I think it worked out really well!  I hate red enchilada sauce, so I used green, and I used about three tablespoons of salsa instead of the green chiles (since I had green sauce).  I toasted the tortillas as recommended, but they still came out all soggy, so I'm not sure that was necessary.  I used the leftovers of a rotisserie chicken, which worked perfectly.  Also the microwave directions say 70% power for 20 minutes, which didn't work at all for us - we are higher altitude, but still, I would say 30 minutes at 80% would have been good.  The meal was good though - we really enjoyed it!  It could easily feed a family of 4 plus leftovers, so I will freeze the recipe in 2 portions next time.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

This was very good, although I made it as actual enchiladas instead of a casserole because that's what my husband prefers.  My son asked if I would please make this every night!  I used 4 tortillas and put a bit of enchilada sauce on the bottom (green since I don't like red), then added the chicken/bean mixture, topped with cheese and more sauce, rolled it up and topped with more cheese and a spoonful of salsa.  I left the sour cream out of the mixture and just let people add it on top as they wanted it.  Turned out wonderful!

This was fantastic! I added garlic, onion and canned corn to the mix.  Next time I think I'll add more coriander and cumin as it needed more seasoning.

Loved this! I thought I had everything on hand but realized I didn't have any black beans so subbed them for white beans which I love. Didn't have any cilantro but didn't miss it and also used flour tortillas as we're not fond of the corn. Added lots more cheese and baked until bubbly and delicious!! Hubby wants this on regular rotation.

I shredded the chicken and used flour tortillas and green enchilada sauce because that is our preference. I also mixed the sour cream in with the chicken mixture and it was wonderful. I made it again the same week for a family get together and EVERYONE raved and asked for the recipe. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Even a picky daughter and Uncle ate more than one helping. I didn't have time to uncover and top with cheese at the end so I just did the cheese topping at the beginning, covered & cooked.  It was moist and delicious.

Very tasty!  Instead of the cumin and coriander, I used 1/2 a package of taco seasoning.  I also just mixed a few big spoonfuls of sour cream right in with the chicken mixture, and I used a shredded rotisserie chicken.  I tore the tortillas in quarters, and used almost a whole 19oz. can of enchilada sauce. After the second layer of chicken, I put one more layer of tortillas, followed with more sauce and cheese.  Delicious!

This recipe definitely deserves 5 stars. It turned out too spicy for my kids to eat so next time I might choose a milder enchilada sauce or red chiles to tone it down. Otherwise, it turned out great for my liking. I did use flour tortillas instead of corn because I don't like corn tortillas.

I made this for friends and everyone loved it! I skipped the saute step and just poached boneless, skinless chicken breasts w/ Rotel, chicken bouillon, sliced onions, salt & pepper. As soon as they were cool, I chopped them up and added them to the black bean mixture. Having plenty of chicken in this dish is key to its success. Take an immersion blender to the bouillon mixture and add enough water to make a fabulous, spicy rice side dish.

Good stuff! I used extra enchilada sauce. As well as toasting the corn tortillas for 3 min on 450 degrees in oven. Cooked chicken breasts in the oven covered with cumin and salt. My mixture contained chicken cut in small cubes,  cilantro, black beans,  minced garlic, corn,  black olives sliced all tossed together. The rest of the way just like the original recipe. I think red or green enchilada sauce according to preference,  I like either. Kick it up a notch with japs or hot sauce. Thumbs way up.

This is yumymy! My hubby loved it so I'll make it again. I cooked the chicken then added black beans, can of diced tomatoes and corn into the pan with it and garlic. Then layered it as per the recipe. Didn't use cilantro or green chile peppers as I didn't have any. Turned out delicious. Baked it about a half hour with lots of cheese on top.

Very yummy! I'll definitely make this again, as it is delicious and takes a lot less work than enchiladas. One tip: If you plan to halve this recipe for a smaller group, keep the same amount of filling and just use a smaller pan and less tortillas. It makes each slice a bit thicker and more filling.

Yummy!! I forgot to save the last layer of cheese till the end, but it didn't matter - I just took off the foil for the last 5 minutes. I added extra cilantro because I love it. I cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 pan and it worked great! My first enchiladas, and the layer style made it so easy.

This was not to my liking at all. Maybe using refried beans instead of black beans and more sauce would help. It was just too dry and cilantro was overwhelming.

This recipe is wonderful!  I only made slight changes, we grilled our chicken first then shredded it.  I used queso fresco for the cheese (from Costco) and shredded it, and since some people in my family don't care for sour cream, I did not dot it on the top but served it on the side instead along with some quacamole and chopped tomatoes but added more cheese on top of the casserole to compensate for the sour cream not being there.  I had this with the Mexican Rice III on this site and it was a totally authentic Mexican meal.  A must have with Margaritas!

I made these as enchiladas instead of a casserole, and in doing so I cut back on the calories and fat. I only added a tiny bit of cheese and omitted the sour cream, and I didn't use as much enchilada sauce as well. I also used smoked chicken (it was what I had leftover from the weekend) and I left out the spices and added plenty of garlic. I rolled these up in big whole wheat flour tortillas and 1 is enough for anyone! These were great!

Snaps for debmce4! This was very good, easy and inexpensive. I had bbq chicken left over so I used that. I didn't cook the sour cream because I thought the cream would break and curdle. I placed a scoop on top before serving and everyone loved it...kinda like a big enchilada.

I had some left over roasted chicken that I need to use up and I came across this recipe. It was at least 95 degrees here in Iowa last night and I didn’t want to turn on my oven so I threw all the ingrediance in the crock pot. To my welcomed surprise this was really good. I can’t say that it held up real well, but that could be because I added an extra jar of enchilada sauce. But the flavor was wonderful and I didn’t have to heat up my whole house.

this was pretty good.  I did not have green chiles so it probably was not as spicy as it would be normally.  I also added a can of corn to it, which gave it some extra veggies.  Serve with a small salad and you have a nice, quick meal.

This was my first try at enchiladas of any kind and it was really good - my husband called it Mexican lasagne!  I wasn't paying attention when I pulled the can of "beans" out the cupboard and didn't notice until it was too late that I had pulled out black eyed peas - tasted good anyway.  I used 6 8 inch flour tortillas (as they were what I had) and layered up the casserole like in the video on this site.  I will now proceed to review the enchilada sauce I used from this site as it really helped make the dish.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

This was really good! I had to make some adjustments because of what I had on hand but it still turned out great. I used about ¼ can of jalapeño peppers because I didn’t have green chili peppers…if you are looking for a kick, this definitely gave the dish that! WOW, it was a little spicy, but still tasty. I didn’t have cilantro either and it still turned out good, but I wouldn’t leave it out if you have it available!! Overall, it was a great way to switch up my usual chicken enchilada recipe!

FANTASTIC!!!  I actually use 2 can of the peppers and add 2 4.5oz cans of diced black olives with jalapenos for an added kick.  I don't use the sour cream and use reduced fat cheese and it comes out great!  My boyfriend and his roommates can't even tell that I cut out some extra cals.

I modified it a bit to make a quesadilla. The chicken and black beans mix was great, but as a quesadilla, it didn't work that well. I would recommend sticking to the recipe.

Very good!  I pre-fried the tortillas in a little bit of vegetable oil as I was afraid they would get soggy like others mentioned.  Easy to throw together for a quick dinner especially if you just buy pre-cooked chicken

I made a few changes. I used canned chicken breast meat to save time, and I used green enchilada sauce instead of the red. It tasted great and it's definitely something I will make again.

This was tasty. I toasted the tortillas, but were still soggy on the bottom??
I didn't have any coriander, but the rest was the same.
Will make again.

YUM, we REALLY liked this one!!! I needed to make more servings (13 x 9 pan) so I added a can of corn and added a can of cream of chicken soup to 8 ounces of the sour cream and doubled the spices. The cilantro really gives it a great flavor so if you are wondering about that, definately try it!!! Thanks!

This was wonderful and easy to make!  I love not having to put tortillas in oil or warm in order to roll.  I used white corn tortillas which added a different flavor.  Next time I will double the recipe and freeze one!

I thought this might be a little dull, but it was really quite good, and the kids ate it, too, which says something.  I was happy to add this to my collection of mexican casseroles.

Flavor was excellent and easy to make.  I wish I had torn the tortillas into bite-size pieces because it was difficult To cut the saturated tortillas.

Great!!! Yes, I did make changes, because why not add more veggies. I sauteed some onion and bell pepper with the spices and lime juice, then cooked the chicken and added black beans, spinach, and corn. Layered with wheat tortillas and used a homemade enchilada sauce. Easy and satisfying meal!

Meh for my family. Definitely needs a second can of sauce. The tortillas sucked up the first can, making the casserole very dry. Also needs more spices - kinda bland.

Fantastic! Subs: cooked the chicken in lime juice with some chopped cilantro, cumin and chili pepper. Added sliced black olives on top for the final baking step and added sliced green onions and fresh jalapeño coins on top after plating for an extra kick.

This recipe was fantastic! Way easier than rolling individual enchiladas and very moist and tasty.  I cooked the chicken in the crock pot on low during the day so I could just shred it when I got home from work. I prefer the texture anyway, compared to cooking on the stove.  I used a larger can of Enchilada Sauce (14 oz?). I also skipped the scour cream layer and served it on the side.  Will definitely make this again!

I made this recipe three times: once as-written, and once with some adjustments, and once by memory. Here are my thoughts.

Two cups of cheese was WAAAAYY too much. It helped to make the recipe more soup-like than a hearty casserole. The second go-round, I used only a little over 1 cup of cheese. Much better.

The first time I made this recipe, the flavors were really good; I couldn't complain. But the second time I made it, I didn't have any sour cream, so I went ahead without it. And wow, was I surprised. The second batch was a lot better. The other flavors in the dish came through with far more zip. My partner agreed. If you like muted flavors, keep the sour cream; if you like it zippier, leave it out.

One last comment. The third time I made this recipe, I didn't have the recipe in front of me (and I couldn't find it on the site). So, somehow, I thought the recipe required a can of cream of chicken soup. Yeah, don't do this. :(

Overall, I found this recipe to be delicious, easy, and popular. Great for Fall!

I usually make my enchiladas the old fashioned way and roll each one up in the pan. This looked easier and I had some rotisserie  chicken to use up, so I thought I would try it!! Seriously, you almost can't even tell the difference in the long version as opposed to this short easy version!! Absolutely delicious!! I did quick fry the corn shells cuz I do it when I do the long version as I feel it makes them thinner and melt in your mouth easier!! No more intensive labor over enchiladas for me anymore!!! This recipe is a keeper for sure!!

I made a lot of changes here because of what was on hand.  After dicing the chicken breast, seasoned with chili powder and cumin (no coriander) and sauteed with onion and part of a red bell pepper.  Added the kidney beans, drained, (had no black beans on hand), greek yogurt in place of sour cream, no chili peppers, the torn pieces of whole grain tortillas, and shredded cheeses to the pan, mixed together and dumped into casserole dish.  Cooked, covered, for 30 minutes as instructed.  Served with a side salad.  Yummy, easy and filling.  Thanks for sharing

It came out delicious - I eliminated The coriander and replaced it with a half a teaspoon of chili powder.  I did not toast the corn tortilla shells. The key to this recipe is when it comes out of the oven to let it sit and sat for about 10 minutes without the tinfoil on. My boyfriend loved it!

Slow cooked the chicken w the cilantro, taco seasoning, ranch packet, green chilies and chick broth then shredded.  Mixed in the enchilada sauce and sour cream and then layered.  I also toasted the corn tortillas (sprayed w Pam) in the oven at 450 about 5 min on each side before kayering.

It was incredible.  It had a nice kick but wasn't too out of sight.  I'd highly recommend it.  We had refried beans and fruit on the side.  What a lovely summer dinner!

Taste was good but too mushy, although, I noticed after the fact that I used the large jar of sauce verses the 10oz mentioned.  I didn't even think about it since the small jar would not have been nearly enough sauce.  I also used a 9x13 and added some corn to the chicken mixture.

Followed the recipe and thought it was okay. A tad bland in my opinion, but the kids ate it. If I make it again, I will have to add some spice. It was easy to make though.

My boyfriend seemed to really like this dish. I thought it was just ok. It was a little bland to me. Next time I'll use hot green chiles and a good dowsing of salsa verde.

We loved this!  I made just a few changes - used green enchilada sauce, didn't have coriander, and added chopped green onion.  I had chicken already cooked and shredded, so I skipped that part and just went straight to the assembly.  I did combine the sour cream with the chicken mixture and sprinkled a little more green onion and some sliced olives on top when the last of the cheese was added.  We three adults ate half; the rest will be great warmed up tomorrow.  Thanks for this great recipe!

This is a good basic recipe that can be modified to suit your tastes and what you have on-hand.  Normally, the first time I make a recipe I keep it as close to the original as possible and then make adjustments for future batches.  I made this for the first time and added some garlic salt to the chicken once cooked through.  I forgot to buy green chilies, so used Poblanos from the garden and a few pickled jalepenos, diced.  I also substituted non-fat greek yogurt for sour cream.  I did not add cilantro, since my kids are not big fans.  I used six tortillas for each layer since I had more than enough to spare. After I added the final layer, it looked like it needed more to it, so I added half a sauteed onion and a 1/2 cup salsa.  Next time I may add a small can of corn and will cook onions and garlic with the chicken, as other reviewers suggested.  My two boys and I loved it and went back for seconds, with enough leftover for another night.

I made this following the recipe as is. It was good. I think if I make this again, I would substitute the spices for a packet of taco seasoning.

This was a big hit in my house.  I made it exactly as stated, and my 4yo son gave me a thumbs up.  Hubby and I made a few notes: We would make more of the chicken mixture and add a third layer to the casserole.  We also love heat, so we would add either a spicy enchilada sauce or perhaps some jalapenos.  Also, on top of the last layer of cheese: Green onion and black olives.  Yum!

Love this recipe.  I made just a few changes and it turned out just as good as any restaurant dish!

First, instead of the cumin, coriander and cilantro, I substituted oregano, basil and parsley.  Then I put canned tomatoes instead of the black beans and some tomato paste rather than using enchilada sauce.  I did not have green chile peppers so I used 1 tablespoon of fresh diced garlic.

My family isn't a huge fan of corn tortillas so we used some semolina-based pasta I had in the pantry and I topped with parmesan cheese, rather than the Mexican blend (more authentic, IMO).

The only thing I omitted was the sour cream.

Delicious!

I made this for the second time tonight. I was not that crazy about it the first time.  The changes I made were as follows: I added corn, Rotel tomatoes, one chopped onion and 7 ounces of diced green chilies. Instead of sour cream, I decided to use cottage cheese (approximately a cup and a half). It turned out much better this time. I thought it needed more spice so we generously added chunky salsa and topped it with plain yogurt.  Next time, I will add some chili peppers or maybe some cayenne.  Very high in protein and delicious. I have made this many times. I made it again last night and I think it was the best. It was very hot yesterday and I keep a lot of canned goods in my garage. I did not want to go out in the heat to get my enchilada sauce so I used mild green chili salsa instead along with my other changes. I also layered in some mozzarella cheese that I wanted to use up and then topped it with cheddar after adding more green chili salsa. It was excellent.

I was searching for a good recipe to use up leftover chicken, and this one was perfect!  My elderly 89 & 86 year old parents and the rest of the family loved it!  It wasn't too spicy for them.  It is an easy recipe to make and the leftovers are just as delicious.  I didn't change a thing!

I used this recipe but like most, I modified it just a bit. I used about two whole skinless chicken breasts, diced up into pieces and seared in a pan. I added taco seasoning, could also use fajita seasoning, to season the meat. I covered the chicken with a can of black beans and let that sit while I prepared the rest.I put half a can of sour cream, I think 8 oz., into a bowl with half a jar of taco sauce, or enchilada sauce, and a whole can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green Chile's. Layered the quesadilla strips on the bottom, chicken and beans next, sour cream and taco sauce mixture on top of that, then a heavy layerof Mexican cheese and then repeat one more time. Bake for about 30 mins on 350.

Need a lot more spice, even though I added onions, garlic, and chili powder.  The family liked it well enough to play with the recipe a bit.  Ended up kind of runny, so we used tortilla chips to scoop it.  That was a success.

My kids don't really like any food that has a Spanish or Mexican foundation. But they love this recipe. I have discovered at the last minute that I didn't have chicken breast and ended up using ground beef. I know it wasn't as healthy but it still turned out great.

I was looking for something to make that'd use some leftover cooked chicken breasts I had and make them taste 'different'.   I just added the spices into the chicken, bean mixture.  Added a can of corn (to clean my pantry) and a bit more enchilada sauce because I didn't want left-over sauce.   The casserole was great!   Even my picky spouse who is not a great fan of Mexican food really enjoyed it.    A great way to change up the taste of leftover chicken.

Wonderful dish - the whole family loved it. I did leave out the coriander since I didn't have any in the house.  I also took the advice of others and sprayed my tortillas lightly with Pam and then baked in the oven for approx. 3 minutes on each side.  I also used a slightly larger dish & think it would've been a bit more moist had I used more enchilada sauce.  I think the amount stated in the recipe is probably fine for the smaller dish.  All in all a great dinner & I'll definitely be making it again.

It turned out ok.  It looked pretty and very appetizing. However, I would shred the chicken in the future.  I didn't like the texture of the chicken cubes.  I did add a little chipotle chili powder.  I just thought it was missing something.

I have 3 teenage boys, and they and my  DH tore through this. I added only a little garlic and onion powder while cooking the chicken. I used green sauce because that is what I had on hand. Very good, served with rice and salad.

I needed a gluten-free recipe for a party.  I changed the recipe by starting with a Rotisserie chicken.  I sauteed some onion, green pepper and celery so I would have something to add the spices to.  I also used 1 plus 1/2 cans of enchilada sauce and it was still a little drier than I would have liked.  If I make it again -- and I probably will -- I will add black olives and diced scallions to the top when I return it to the oven for the second baking.  I also made a homemade pico de gallo to go along with it.  I definitely needs that or salsa to add some moisture.

I am a VERY picky eater, but my husband isn't, and this worked for both of us.  My changes were slight (to me): I used already cooked chicken (seasoned rotisserie; to save time), and I used a can of Rotel instead of green chilies (I don't like the chunks, so I mixed some of the liquid into the chicken mixture, but added the chunky stuff on top of my husband's half). In the end, it came out crazy good. I've never left a review for any recipe before, but I loved this one. I am making it for another family this week who just had a baby. Will definitely make this again!

It was a delicious, easy way to eat "enchiladas" without all the dipping and filling and rolling of tortillas. I make my own enchilada sauce so mine might have been a little saucier than the recipe called for, but we liked it.

This was really good!  I had to omit some items because I didn't have them on hand (cilantro, coriander and sour cream).  Next time, I will try with the fresh cilantro and the green chilies, since I used a can of rotel as a substitution for that.  I also had to make the red enchilada sauce from scratch because I don't keep that in the pantry, but that was simple enough to make and I had all of the stuff to make it.  My husband said to put this in the meal rotation!!!!

My family enjoys this recipe so much that we have it a couple of times a month. When I'm pressed for time I use rotisserie chicken with doubled cumin and coriander. Really delicious!

This was good. I would make it again. I did add a can of mexi corn to the mix and used flour tortillas instead of corn. We just like the flour ones better.

Didn't change the recipe too much.  I had to make a casserole for college students on short notice so used some ingredients in home for substitution.  Used already-cooked chicken breast meat, shredded and added one can of turkey chili to the meat to make more volume for the casserole.  The kids LOVED it!!

Very good, but we made some minor changes to better suite our taste buds. We left out the sour cream and just added it once we served the dish. Next time I think I'll incorporate some of the sour cream into the first layer, but 8oz of sour cream is way too much for our liking.

I have made this recipe 3 times now.  Each time it has been a real hit with my family.  I have 3 'adult' kids==2 college agers plus 1 high schooler---each with very different tastes, but this recipe has been well received by all 3,plus my husband and some visiting family.  Leftovers warm up well, too, a real plus.  I make it pretty much as directed, but added whole kernel corn the last batch and really  loved that addition.  I also saute some onions and garlic with the chicken at the beginning.  I have used both corn and flour tortillas.  There is a difference, to be sure, but we like both versions.  I do recommend boiling and shredding the chicken before anything else is done.  I think the 'dryness' of the previously cooked and shredded chicken will help those who have found the tortillas to be too soft.

Tastes great and is easy to make - just not spicy enough for our tastes.  Recommend getting "Hot" instead of "Mild" sauce.

I have made this several times and it is one of my personal favorites. The only thing I changed is instead of diced chicken, I buy a Rotisserie Chicken and just shred 2 cups of meat from it.I could eat the whole pan myself! This is also one of my go to recipes for parties. People always love it and always ask for the recipe!

Turned this into a canned wonder because it's all I had on hand. You would NEVER think I made this with canned goods! Two cans of canned chicken, one can black beans, add juice of one fresh lime, then blanket of spice to cover beans and chicken: garlic powder, onion powder, coriander, cumin, and a dash of salt. Stir and set aside while assemble other items to give chance for flavors to meld. In baking dish, poured half enchilada sauce can as recipe states, then for my corn tortillas (which I don't think have a lot of flavor on their own), brushed with olive oil and coriander on each side to give more flavor, then layered one layer chicken-bean mixture, then layer cheese then layer sour cream. Added one can diced tomatoes (no salt added) and one can of sliced black olives in the layering, like a lasagna. No green chilies no other ingredients. Came out amazing and quantity yielded 2 meals worth. Hurray for one dinner on table and the rest to batch freeze! And best part, super easy with no grocery shopping! Thanks for a recipe that inspired me!

I make this all the time now... like once a week at times :)  The only change I made to it was to add more meat because my family loves meat so they requested an additional lb of ground beef to be added but that's it.  We crave this recipe all the time!  Thanks so much for sharing!

Made as written, my family & I really liked this recipe. Served with a side of mexican red rice & green salad this was a very filling & satisfying meal. The reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars are because we felt the chicken filling needs a bit more flavor, a tad more sour cream & just a little more sauce on the top for the last 10 minutes because it was a wee bit on the dry side. Not salty as others have said & the recipe doesn't even call for salt (but due my mid-west roots I season everything). A good recipe for those who like their mexican food on the less spicy side.

The only thing I did different was use corn tortilla chip because that is what I had on hand.  It was OK the evening I made it but was so dry the next day I couldn't eat the leftovers for lunch.

Have made this several times.  It is delicious!!  The only change I made, was that I bought a rotisserie chicken at the grocery store and shredded that, instead of cooking the chicken.  Makes it even faster!  Oh, and I add some jalapeno's for some kick.  I have served this at a dinner party and everyone loved it!

VERY bland.  I like the "Mexican lasagna" concept, though, and I'm thinking it's a pretty good base recipe. Next time, I will cook the chicken with chopped onion, garlic, and chile powder, and I'll be sure to add fresh serrano and jalapeno peppers to the bean/meat mixture.

Delicious.  This is a keeper.  I didn't put much sour cream in the casserole itself, but put it on the table to add as we liked.  Seemed to be a good way to do it.  My husband and 18 month old daughter and I ALL enjoyed it!  Great when you can find a recipe that the whole family likes!

As I was dishing this up I plopped it down on the table, frustrated that I had just spent precious time making this dinner, because it did not look very good and looked very dry.  Then I tasted it!  YUM!!!!  It was delicious and very flavorful and my husband and I both loved it.  I will definitely be adding it to my rotation.  The only things I did different was add a bit of chili powder and garlic powder to the chicken mixture and I used flour tortillas that I crisped a bit in the oven first.

I didn't really like how the sour cream was just blobbed on top.  It tasted good.  My husband said he would eat it again and I would only make it if someone wanted it.  I pan fried my white corn tortillas because I wanted a little firmness to them.  I'll try yellow corn if I do make it again.  I thought it was bland overall too.  Used lots of hot sauce.

Family loved this. I used jalapeno flour tortillas and pinto beans otherwise followed the recipe.  Very yummy and flavorful. Also doubled recipe and layered 3 times so increased bake time.

The only problem with this dish is that it is to delicious!  Make sure you make extra because everyone will want seconds or thirds.  I did change the recipe a bit.  I made it one layer instead of two and topped it with tortilla pieces.  That way I didn't have to cover the dish with foil as it baked.  It turned out fantastic!

Wonderful! A very easy and simple recipe. I love cilantro and cheese, so the only modifications there were to add about double the cheese and a large handful of the cilantro. Will definitely make again.

This was quite good! I only had a large can of red enchilada sauce (Rosaritas...it's the best!) and now will continue to only use the big one for the recipe. It's nice to have a new dish for enchiladas. Yum yum.

This is EXCELLENT! My husband and I loved it! He said it tasted like a restraunt. I did add olives and instead of beans I did re-fried beans. I will make this many times! Thanks for sharing!

This is SO good.  I had to modify based on what I had in the house.  I used 1.5 lbs chicken, cooked with chili powder, cumin, garlic salt, and onion powder.  Added the black beans, a 7 oz can green chiles, 1 cup frozen corn, dried cilantro, and 4 oz. sour cream to chicken mixture.  Used 6 whole wheat tortillas (baked at 450 for 5 min.).  Used 1 cup homemade enchilada sauce with about 1/4 cup medium salsa added (all I had on hand).
Hubby raved....said it was fantastic...I agree!

My husband gobbled this up!  We loved it--I couldn't find corn tortillas, so I used taco boats, but they worked fine.  I think you could use taco chips if desperate.  I used a little extra cheese, and enchilada sauce with green chilies.  It was very easy, and delicious.

This recipe was easy to make and tasted great. Paired it with a Spanish Pilaf and some Sangria. Will definitley make again but would add sour cream after cooking.

I made this last November for my family.  It was a real hit!  I brined the chicken first to give it more flavor.  Besides that, I followed the recipe to a T and added some additional seasonings.  Delish!

I loved this!! I had to modify a the recipe a little bit. I couldn't get enchilada sauce - so I substituted with salsa & 1 small tin of tomato paste. Into this I added some Tex-Mex seasoning. I used about twice the amount of sauce that was called for in the recipe.

It was pretty good, but I think if I make it again I will substitute flour tortillas in place of the corn tortillas and add another jar of enchilada sauce.  It was a little dry.  It was pretty good though.

This was great and pretty easy. I made it less spicy (because of my young children) by substituting the green chilies with mild salsa and it was still really good! Everyone loved it.

I actually liked this way more the next day! Seemed like it was much more flavorful after it had sat a day. I used leftover chicken from the night before so I just cut it up and sprinkled the cumin in - didn't measure it, added black olives and didn't use the coriander because I didn't have any, also just sprinkled in the cilantro and went light on the sour cream - used a generic red enchilada sauce which was fine. The only thing I didn't like was how mushy the tortillas ended up - I'm thinking next time I won't put the sauce on the bottom. With tweaking, this is a good, quick recipe.

Great and fairly quick recipe. Served it last night for my son's Birtday! Everyone loved it. I can't wait to make it again. It was gone in a flash! I used a little more cumin and corriander and more cheese. A winner!

Absolutely loved these enchiladas, I did use the amount of chicken from another recipe (6 chicken breasts) and the Enchilada Sauce (the one without any tomato sauce) by Anna Maria from this site and it was absolutely delicious.  My daughter couldn't stop raving about it.

Very good , I changed a lot but really liked the outcome. I marinated the chicken for a day in spices before I cooked it. I nixed the enchilada sauce and mixed sour cream with salsa to make my sauce. Used flour tortillas instead of corn and extra chiles. 
Also used pinto beans, rice , green onion and cotija cheese which I think made it. It turned into several layers but was a big hit.

This was a nice casserole recipe, I used too much sour cream. Next time I would use a little more spice or flavor on the chicken. I will make it again.

This recipe is great for many reasons.  It's simple and basic, which makes it easy to modify or to keep as is.  Try with other types of meat; I used left over roast pork and it was really good!  It's adaptable enough to add or subtract ingredients according to what you might have on hand.  I've added olives and extra sauce.  I also used whole wheat flour tortillas since I'm not a fan of corn tortillas.  Any way you choose to fix it, this is a great "base" recipe.  It would probably be a really good as a vegetarian dish, too.

This is a great recipe.  Based on other reviews, I didn't drain the black beans or the green chiles and the added moisture made it just right.  I skipped the cilantro because I have an allergy to it.  I also used more cheese than called for because I'm a cheeseaholic.  :)

This is a great recipe and it can be tweaked or changed really easily... or not, if you don't feel like experimenting.

this was awesome!! The only thing I changed from the original recipe is I shredded the chicken, crisped the tortillas first, and I didn't add cilantro only because I didn't have any. This was soooo good!! Everyone that ate it had rave reviews.

Great recipe! I diced a fresh chile from my garden, tossed it in a skillet with some oil, garlic and green onion and cooked it until tender. I mixed this with canned chicken, beans, etc., then followed the rest of the recipe. I used the larger can of enchilada sauce (19 oz.) and didn't put sour cream on top while baking, but it turned out so good. I'll never roll another enchilada! Thank you!!!

I added sauteed onion and garlic and chili powder to the chicken, and mixed in half the sour cream as others suggested. I toasted the tortillas before layering them.  Served over yellow rice with a dollop of sour cream. Turned out so yummy!  This will definitely be a regular meal in our home.

This was good, but next time I will tweak it a bit.  Maybe some chili powder and more seasonings...it was just a touch bland.  Good idea though.

This is an outstanding and very easy to fix dish!  I used recommendations from previous reviews and have to say that the chicken should definately be shredded.  I also added about one cup of sauted onions to the chicken mixture and then used fresh avacados for garnish.  To die for!!!!

This was a great recipe.  I used green sauce instead of red & didn't have any coriander...still came out great.  The family loved it.

How bout that photo?...mmmm, good.  Don't let the pic fool you, when properly prepared this casserole is a smash.  The tips above with corn added and sour cream mixed in, I will echo here.   
Great recipe!

I didn't use the corriander (didn't have any)...or the green chiles (forgot).  It was still good.  I will use again, but I think next time I will add a little more cheese.  It was good.  Thanks for the post.

I love this recipe, it is easy and I get rave reviews everytime. I add the sour cream to the chicken mixture as others suggest.  Also, i skip the cumin and corriander and cook the chicken in burrito/taco seasoning.

Tasted delicious, although it came out of the dish as a soupy mushy mess. Not that attractive, but it tasted good.

My husband and I love this recipe! The only change I make is to add more cilantro because we love the taste. It's easy to make and the leftovers great!

This was good and easy.  I did not put in cilantro because I don't like it.  Next time I might try some chopped black olives.  I will make this one again.

We were really happy with this recipe.  We used tostada shells and they didn't turn out soggy at all.  This will be on our regular meal rotation for sure.

This was really tasty and so easy to make.  I only had canned diced jalapeno peppers instead of green chiles so I used about a third of a 4 oz. can and it provided plenty of kick!  I also mixed the sour cream in with the chicken mixture as others suggested.  Next time I might add in black olives.  Thanks for the recipe--it hits the spot when craving something Mexican.

Yummmm!  This was so good!  There were many steps, but mush easier than rolling enchiladas.  My husband called this dish "Mexican Lasagne" and that is exactly what it looks like.  Next time I'll use more tortillas and maybe add refried beans. Did I mention that this is verrry yummy?

I made a few changes. I baked chicked with red onions and garlic first. Shredded the chicken.  Mixed the shredded chicken, onion, black beans, green chile peppers, corn, cumin and coriander together. Then layered as the recipe called for. I put crushed tortilla chips on top.  Overall taste was ok, not fantastic.  Corn tortilla at bottom of dish turned to mash.  Would not make again.
