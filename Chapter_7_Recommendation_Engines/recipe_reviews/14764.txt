Too bland seems to be a common complaint here. Here's what I did. Genorously season chops with salt, pepper, garlic powder,and onion powder, then brown in small amount of oil on each side. place chops over the top of the potatoes in slow cooker. Before mixing the water with the soup, pour water into the pan that the chops were browned in. I used about 1/2 C water. Heat water in pan and scpape up all the brown bits, mixing with water. Then mix this with the soup and pour over the chops. This makes for much more flavor than plain water. Cook on high for 2 to 3 hours. Yummy and not at all bland.

This was wonderful. I used 6 large pork loin chops (really cheap pork) cut in half and even more potatoes than what the recipe called for. I put the pork in my large crockpot with the soup and used beef broth instead of water. Cooked on low for 4 hours and then added the potatoes and cooked another 2 hours, added the green beans and cooked another hour. It was well done and the pork was so tender. Lots of leftovers which I think I'll used to make a pork vegetable stew with. Such an easy one pot recipe! I always spray my crockpot with cooking spray so cleanup is a breeze.

I took the advice of the previous reviewers and did the following: dipped the pork chops in egg batter and then in flour and browned in a small amount of butter.  Then I seasoned them very well with garlic, black pepper, and seasoned salt.  I placed unpeeled, sliced red potatoes in the bottom of the slow cooker and put the chops on top.  Then I poured the soup into the skillet and added milk instead of water.  I scraped up all of the browned bits in the skillet with the soup and milk in it, and after covering the chops with sliced onion I poured the soup mixture on top.  I didn't add green beans to the cooker but instead steamed them and served them on the side.  My daughter, who isn't crazy about any kind of meat, loved the chops.  My husband liked them too.  They were very tender but didn't fall apart...maybe because of the egg and flour coating?  On busy school nights it's a perfect quick meal.

I was moved to write this review because my husband who is very picky, loved this recipe.  It was very easy and hearty.  I did make a few changes based on previous reviewers' recommendations.  I used 2 cans of cream of mush soup, 6 potatoes,  onion and garlic powder.  I diced my potatoes and put 1/3 in the bottom of slow cooker, then sprinkled with salt and pepper.  Covered with 1 can soup/water mixture.  Then placed my previously pan browned chops (1/2 of them) and covered with another 1/3 of potatoes, then remainder of chops, and remainder of potatoes and lastly covered with soup/water mixture.  I seasoned each layer of potatoes with salt and pepper and the chops were seasoned with salt, onion & garlic powder.  I then cooked on low for 8 hours.  Very tasty.  My husband couldn't wait to eat the leftovers the next day!  Thanks for a great recipe.  This is my first review, and I hope it is helpful!

This was so good! I followed the advice of other reviewers and changed a few things. First, browning the pork is a must! I seasoned them with salt, pepper and onion powder first. Someone else said they used beef broth instead of water to deglaze the pan, but I didn't have any. I did find a can of french onion soup that I will probably never use and used the broth from that. I then mixed the cream of mushroom soup right into the pan. It got really nice and brown! I added thick potato slices and seasoned between layers. I cooked the green beans separately for my picky kids. The meat was tender and I thought the sauce was delicious and not too canned tasting.

Very good, next time I will add the potatoes in the beginning and add the beans the last hour or so. That way I can forget about cooking it on high for another 2 hours.

This was great, the pork chops were so flavorful and tender. My modifications were using Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic soup, and omitting the green beans. So easy and delicious!

This a very easy recipe to make.  Used less water and added more seasonings to the chops to give it more flavor.  I put the potatoes in at the start and decreased the cook times to approximately 5 hours on low/1 hour on high.  It came out good, even my husband liked it.  Will make this for dinner again!

I made this yesterday and it was a hit! I used assorted pork chops, added half an onion and a tablespoon of garlic. I did not add the water and my gravy turned out perfect! Served w/ mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. (obviously I did not add green beans or tators to crock)

It was good, but needed just a little something more.  Maybe herbs, tarragon or sage would probably be good.  I will also omit the water next time because the sauce was a little thin.  It is definately worth trying again though!!The meat fell off the bone!

This recipe was wonderful.  I did modify a few things.  I used 2 cans of cream of onion soup instead of cream of mushrooms (I hate mushrooms) and used beef broth in place of the water.  I layered the food as follows: one can of soup mixed with beef broth on bottom of slow cooker.  Then I placed a layer of potatoes.  The pork chops were seasoned with pepper and season salt and placed on top of potatos.  Another layer of potatos followed by second can of soup drizzled over top of everything.  I then cooked on low for 8 hours and had a steamed veggie on the side.  My husband and 14 month old loved it.  Pork chops were so tender and flavor was amazing!  We will definietly be making this again in the future.

This recipe was wonderful.  I did season the pork chops before putting them into the slow cooker, salt, pepper, minced onion, alittle garlic powder and alittle bit of italian seasonings.  I also put the potatoes in from the start and just cooked it on low heat for about 7 hours, the last hour I added two cans of green beans and we loved it!  Will make this again!

This recipe is really easy!  It's a great way to cook pork chops in the winter.  I will probably add more seasoning next time.  Overall, it's a really good dish.

Awesome recipe. Did make some adjustments though. First I used 2 cans of soup (one can goes in first, second goes on top of everything else). I put the potatoes on the bottom of crock pot. I seasoned the chops with season salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and lemon pepper . Put the green beans on top. and cooked the whole thing for 8hrs.

What a wonderful recipe!!! SO close to mine. Mine is different in that, I season my pork chops with sea salt, fresh ground pepper, and garlic salt. Then I brown them in a pan. Place one can of cream of mushroom soup in bottom of crock pot, place chops on top of that and another can of cream of mushroom soup. I cook this all day long. I do buy about an inch thick chops though. At a bout an hour before we eat, I add the green beans. Now my favorite part...I make mashed potatoes and serve the sauce over the mashed potatoes. I never add any water, milk or broth as it makes the cream of mushroom soup runny. When it's time for dinner, we help ourselves to some green beans first, grab a chop, then a scoop of mashed potatoes, and pour the sauce over it all. YUMMY!!! Great recipe. WARNING!!! Not advised for people who don't like salty stuff. Or for people on low sodium diets. But my family LOVES this meal and it's so easy!

My entire family of five enjoyed this meal!  I browned and seasoned the pork chops then added the soup/water to the pan drippings to add more flavor. We enjoy green beans but rather than adding them to the soup mix, I preferred not to mix the flavors and just heated the beans up in the microwave.  The meal was delicious, will make again!

I added 2 cans soup for extra gravy. I also added Mrs Dash for extra seasoning.  I have also done it with the water that is listed in recipe and once I substituted 1/2 water & 1/2 milk.  However you do it, it is easy, it makes a great meal that fills you up, and it tastes good the next day as leftovers.

These turned out really good.  Only thing, my slow cooker did them up earlier than the recipe called for.  I had them on low but cut out about an hour of cooking time before adding the last ingredients and then only needed another hour at the end to finish them off.

If you make this, one can of soup is just not enough. I only had one can of vream of mushroom soup and a can of cream of chicken in my pantry, so i used half of the cream of chicken with the mushroom soup.  It worked okay but it still wasn't enough.  The pork and potatoes came out very tender but it had soaked up all the gravy.  I had to really spruce up the flavor with alot of seasoning too.  This is a great base recipe and you can add different veggies and seasoning to it to cater to your family's tastes.

The pork chops fell apart, and it ended up being more like a stew, but it was still really good! I also added some onion powder, garlic powder, and seasoned salt to the chops, but that was for my own personal taste. Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely make again!

My family loved this recipe.  I used the less expensive bone-in pork chops and a can of sliced potatoes.  Also seasoned the chops with some onion powder.  Next time I might add in some sauteed mushrooms and onions also.  Easy and good recipe.

It was so snowy and cold outside and this warmed me right up. A very warm hearty meal but it needed alittle love. I took advance of others and browned the chops with flour and s+p and some italian seasoning. Than I used 2 soups put them in the pan with the water and 1/4 cup of milk. Put them in the slow-cooker pork chops on bottom than sauce, than potatos. I cooked 1hr on high and 3 hrs on low. I do have a stronger slow cooker. The last 1/2 hr I put the green beans in. The chops where so tender you didnt even need a knife. I had with stuffing and peas and of course the potatos and green beans. The sauce was great on top of the stuffing. You def need to have a heavy hand on the seasoning. I will be making this one again for sure. thx!

This is classic comfort food. Very easy and lots of flavor. I did brown the meat and season w/ pepper, garlic powder and onion seasoning first. Also, mixed the water w/ the pan drippings as another poster suggested. Added meat & potatoes @ the same time. Cook on low 6-7 hrs. Add green beans last hr. Perfect! My Hubby says,"Pretty darn good!"

I browned the chops first and used the water to loosen the brown bits in the pan.  Added a little bit of beef bouillon and also used Lawry's on the chops.  Potatoes went on the bottom from the start, and frozen green beens were added halfway through.

This recipe was pretty good but I think the cooking time is too long.  I added the potatoes from the start and everything was done in about five hours.  I also waited to add the green beans at the very end just to heat them.

This was a typical hearty crockpot recipe.  I added cream of celery soup to the cream of mushroom soup, sliced mushrooms, and quartered red potatoes.  The Costco pork chops were very thick so I cooked for 6+ hours.  The meat was so tender you didn't even need a fork.

This recipe was ok.  I did as others had suggested and browned my chops first with some onion.  I added the soup mix and about 1/4 c. of water to the pan drippings along with some garlic powder.  Put two chops in the crock pot first, added potatoes, placed the other two chops on top and added the soup mix.  The chops were VERY tender.

I thought this recipe was great.  Although I had some trouble getting the potatoes done, I had to cook them for 4 hours instead of 2 1/2.  Next time I will just put them in when I start the pork chops.  I will make this again.

First of all, if I'm going to cook it in the Crock Pot.... that's the only "pot/pan" I'm going to use.  Normally, I don't buy, or eat pork (no it's not a religious thing... it's a personal preference thing".) However, my local meat market had some lovely pork chops... so Why not?
Used this recipe.... modified..... for what I can... and cannot eat.  Into the slow cooker..... I threw in an onion, potatoes, whatever cut of pork chops has bones, sprinkled with garlic and onion powder, salt substitute, pepper, added some "lower sodium" cream of mushroom soup. Let it cook on high for (5-6) hours..Threw in a can of green beans. Another hour or so...... done, and done. Delicious. I've been cooking for about 55 years, or so.... Yes.  I tweak.

Customized version: used another can of soup, more spices, more onion, no green beans, seared the chops & sliced the potatoes. I also layered as another reviewer suggested: half of the potatoes & onions w/ s&p, half the soup/water mixture, the chops in the middle, other half potatoes then soup. On low 8-9 hours did the trick.

Sorry, but I won't be doing this one again.  The chops turned out to be dry & I have never had this happen before.  If anyone has any suggestions I'll be happy to try it again as it is a very easy recipe.

I make my pork chops in the crock pot often.  I mix one envelope of dry onion soup mix to the can of cream of mushroom soup then mix all with one soup can of water.  I then do the same as by putting the potatoes in the bottom.  I am going to try adding the green beans the next time I prepare this.

I've made this twice now.  If you just follow the recipe word for word, yes, you may find it a bit on the bland side - it really is "just" cream soup over pork chops.  But, seasoned to your preference, this is a delicious and easy way to get a good hot meal into your family.  I use onion powder and a good heap of Adobo seasoning.  I also use milk instead of the water.  I find it easier to throw a container of frozen green beans in at the start as well - especially if I'm gone all day.  The first time I made this, I put the potatoes in the crock, but the second I just made some instant mashed potatoes to serve along with the meal and I preferred that.  The gravy was good with it.

I'm giving this 4 stars because it is a great "basic" recipe.  It turned into a 5 with a few tips from other reviewers.  I dredged chops in flour with salt and pepper, browned in a large skillet with garlic in olive oil, then removed from pan, and added the soup to the pan drippings in the skillet with 1/2 cup water and a beef bouillon cube. Simmered, then poured 1/2 sauce into slow cooker, added chops on top, and poured rest of sauce over the chops so they were covered on both sides.  Let it cook on low in the slow cooker while I was at work (about 6 hrs), then added cubed potatoes when I got home and turned it up to high til the potatoes were tender (about 1 more hour).  These chops were so tender, they literally fell apart.  My daughter practically licked her plate clean!  I served green beans on the side.  Will definitely make again.

I am so glad I found this web site. We have been so bored with eating the same thing all the time. My teenager's loved this recipe and these were the best chops my family of 7 ever ate.There was nothing left to EAT!! I would recommend this to everyone. The only thing I change as with the other viewer was I put milk in with the cream of mushroom soup instead of water and added 1 can of beef broth in with the soup mixed together until blend like gravy than poured it over the top of the chops. We ate it with Rice and added the gravy on top of the rice..YUMMY!!! thanks so much. Can't wait to make these for my father-n-law.

decent recipe however definately need to add some spices for flavor. I used cream of chicken soup b/c that's all I had. I also seasoned the pork with onion powder, garlic powder, oregano in addition to salt and pepper. the meat was very tender and tasty. I add french style green beans for a half and hour at the end.

I read from review that the chops seemed to be bland, so I coated them in flour and added some garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper, also a little cumin powder, then I browned them on both sides for a few minutes.  Also for me 1 can of mushroom soup was not enough.  So I used 2 ( you will need it if you have a large crock pot) and 1 cup of milk instead of water.  Overall this was really good, but I believe it was my changes that made it this way. Made as is I could see how ppl would think it was too bland..

This was a really good recipe.  I cooked it in the oven instead of the crock pot because I didn't start it in time.  I cooked it for about 3 hours at 300 degrees.  I greased a 2 quart casserole dish and put the potatoes in first then the pork chops with the soup mixture over the top.  I also seasoned the pork chops with garlic powder and browned them for about 3 minutes on each side before I added them.  The pork chops were very tender and the potatoes were just right - not too mushy or firm.  I also left out the green beans.  Just didn't sound good. I will definitely make this again!  Hopefully I'll start early enough to try the crock pot next time.

Delicious!  I used a lot of people's suggestions on this one.  Browned the pork chops (6 smaller ones) after seasoning with salt, pepper and roasted garlic powder.  Put potatoes and large mushrooms in the bottom of crock pot.  Used two cans of cream of mushrooms with roasted garlic soup. And 1/2 cup water that I used to deglaze the pan I browned the chops in.  Put chops on top and poured one can of the soup on top.  Cooked for 4 hours on high.  YUM.  Green beans on the side.

I have made this several times.  Sometimes I brown the chopd sometimes I don't.  I put the potatoes in the bottom of the crock and they are always done with the chops.  I don't add the green beans I prefer to have them on the side.  Truly a family favorite.  Thanks for shearing this recipe.

peppered the chops to our liking (lots of pepper! :P) and browned them on both sides, skipped the green beans, neither of us like em too much and just added more potatoes with a little more cream soup and water. came out nicely tender. believe it or not i had never really had pork chops (mother had worries about pork going bad in my little tummy when i was a kid) and this was just great, now i love em too. will make again!

Very easy & fast to put together! I also added extra seasonings and salt.  Inplace of real potatoes, I used frozen hashbrowns. It's one I will make again.

Substitute the cream of mushroom for cream of celery and you have an interesting change (or a little of both).  I make this all the time but have never made it in a crock pot until now.  I too season the chops and brown before adding them...season with celery salt, pepper, parsley, seasoned salt and it gets more flavor.

We loved this easy throw together dinner!  I did brown the chops in butter before adding them to the crock pot though, just for color.  We also used center cut, boneless chops instead of regular chops so you can eat it all! Michelle in Ohio.

Not bland, but we didn't follow the basic recipe... Instead of water, we used a mix of chicken broth (about 6 oz) and a vegetable bullion (using a bullion paste called Better Than Bullion). We browned the pork chops, using some garlic olive oil and seasoned with garlic powder, sea salt and our favorite spice mix from Misty's (google it in Lincoln Nebr). When the chops were browned, we set them aside while we added the cream of mushroom soup (2 cans) and the stock/bullion mix to the pan in which we had just browned the chops. Mixed thoroughly to make sure we picked up the dregs from the pan. We cubed the potatoes and put 1/3 in the bottom of the crock, used 1/3 of the onions and put 1/2 of the pork chops. Added about 1/3 of the liquid (soup/bullion/stock mix). Layered again with 1/3 potato, 1/3 onion and the other 1/2 of the chops. Added another 1/3 of the liquid, then topped with the rest of the potatoes and onions and the rest of the liquid. We did not use the green beans. Cooked on low for just over six hours. Meat was fork-tender and not overcooked. Potatoes were cooked to perfection. Very tasty!! Served with some pan fried brussels sprouts. Yummy!! As we were eating, we thought that carrots might be a nice addition, not only for the color but for the taste as well. Other veggies we tossed around for discussion included turnips, squash or cabbage. We will DEFINITELY make this again!

This was awesome! I fixed it for dinner tonight. I did make a couple of changes.I put a can of cream of mushroom soup in the bottom of the crock pot with a little water and 3 beef bouillon cubes. I cut up an onion and quartered four white potato's with skins and put them on top of soup. Sprinkled garlic powder over all. I browned my pork chops with garlic powder, salt and pepper and then put them on top of the potato mixture. I then added another can of mushroom soup and a little water. I drizzled some worcestershire sauce on top and cooked it on med for 7 hours. After 6 hours I added 3 small cans of mushrooms and 2 cans of green beans. It was yummy and had a great flavor. I think the beef bouillon added flavor and didn't make the gravy to runny! This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

I took the suggestion of another rater, seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, garlic, and onion powder and browned them in a skillet.  Then I added the water to the skillet to soak up the flavors and poured that water into the crockpot vs plain water.  I also used red potatoes.  This recipe is a good start but does take some tweeking.

I adapted this recipe a bit.  I used a couple of cans of cream of mushroom soup and less water than it called for.  I also didn't have any potatoes except for mashed, so when it was done I just put the pork chop and some of the gravy (which turned out a little runny) over mashed potatoes.  It turned out so tender.  I absolutely loved it.

I had high hopes, but I was disappointed.  Only modification I made was using bone-in chops because boneless were too expensive.  The gravy was watery and bland, even after I added some cornstarch to thicken it near the end.  It was still edible, and smelled great, but my daughter only had 2 bites.  Oh, well.

Nice recipe! I ran out of milk so I added a few splashes of half & half. Then I added one cup of water(plus two beef bouillon cubes)to the mushroom soup. I also added a pinch of Cavender's Greek seasoning. I would not recomend adding the green beans to this as the beens tend to add way too much water and really thins out the "Gravy" sauce which is great to top off you meal with. Thank You for sharing this great recipe!!!

I read the reviews about this recipe being bland, so I put in the slow cooker everything in the recipe plus alot of spices....garlic, basil, marjoram, parsley, salt, pepper.....I also added a bit of chicken broth and mushrooms.  Oh yea, I also addred bread crumbs to thicken the sauce.  Very good.  This might be really good over the top of noodles.

I seasoned the chops with lots of cajun seasoning and garlic. browned them with 1/2 an onion and deglazed the pan with the water. I put 2 chops in the bottom, then the potatoes, 2 more chops over that. Poured the soup & water over all of it. The finished meal was okay. The chops fell into small pieces and mixed with the potato/sauce so we ended up with a stew kind of thing. The chops were very tender and tasted good but it wasn't anything we thought was good enough to make again unless we were very busy. Like many slow cooker meals, we thought everything ended up tasting the same.

My family loved this.  I browned the porkchops.  I also put the soup and water into the pan that I use for browning, so I did not miss any of the good pan drippings.  I put half the soup mixture in the bottom of the cooker, then added the potatoes.  I put the porkchops on the top of the potatoes and poured the remaining soup on top.  I cooked it for 7 hours on low.  I drained the green beans and added them to the mixture, and turned it up to high for another hour. It is a keeper!

This was a very good recipe.  Instead of green beans I put in fresh carrots.  It was delicious.  It's so easy to just through everything in the crockpot in the morning and forget about for the day.  It's an easy clean-up too.  My husband, who isn't crazy about creamed soups loved this recipe.

Very yummy. Although I did make some changes. I used beef stock and cream of broccoli soup. I seasoned the pork with pepper, garlic powder and Adobo powder then seared. I suggest leaving out the potatoes and serving with rice and/or egg noodles. My 10 year old wanted to drink the sauce!

Loved this recipe. I had 3 pork chops sprinkled with salt and pepper and Adobo (with Cumin), 1/4 water and added one beef bouillon cube. Cooked on high for 3 hours, added small yellow potatoes(left the skin on), cooked for another 2 hours, added the green beans and cooked for an hour. Magnificent. Definitely will make again

I made this recipe and tweaked it to the veggies I had in the fridge needing  to be used.  First off I used Pork steaks since that is what I had defrosted and I always read the reviews first and noticed everyone said too bland so I added potatos at the beginning, quartered onion some garlic, I had some yellow squash and zucchini to use and carrots. I also used cream of chicken soup with milk and added in a can of recipe starters garlic. green beans at the last minute. The herb I used was cilantro as my hubby loves it in everything.  Thanks for the hints everyone

I completed this recipe three times and I found that the Beef broth is truly the key. I normally get my chops in the crock pot in the morning before work so I never have time to brown them. The first time I cooked them I followed the reviews and added the beef broth and the chops came out perfect my 14 year who was begging for new recipes ate it up and so did my mom who came over to visit. I have made it exactly like the recipe calls for with water and it was still good but not as great as the broth so if you are looking to make the recipe as simple as the directions call for simply add the beef broth and it will perfect

Made this yesterday, with a few changes as noted in reviews.  I seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, onion & garlic powder, then browned in a skillet with a bit of oil.  Took cream of onion soup (which was what I had on hand) and mixed the soup with water.  Layered cut up potatoes, browned & seasoned pork chops, then a layer of sliced onion, with the soup mixture on top and cooked for 4 hours.  I cooked the green beans separately.  It was tasty, but I may add a bit more seasoning next time.

With the suggested changes included (from other's tips), it is 5 stars. Here is what I did:
Added seasoned salt to each side and browned the chops in oil. Added condensed beef broth into pan after chops cooked to get the bits from browning. Added mushroom soup and about 1 extra can water. Tossed in a handful of frozen diced onions and a minced garlic clove along with a pinch of general seasoning from our local olive oil shop that has a few dried red bell peppers, parsley, thyme. Next  time will also add 1-2 T white wine. Cooked on high for 6 hours and did not add potatoes or green beans (hub doesn't like). Served over mashed potatoes with peas on the side. These were tender and very tasty. Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

I started my version of this recipe with six half inch boneless pork chops. Heated up a 12" skillet with a couple tbsp of canola oil, some minced garlic and half a medium sized onion. Browned the chops for a few minutes along with the drippings from the pan and added them to the cream of mushroom soup in the crock pot. Added a cup of milk (instead of water) and a can of cut green beans. I then added a dash or so of onion powder, a dash of celery salt and a dash of rosemary-garlic herb, a few shakes of dried chives and a little red wine (probably a couple ounces). I cooked it on low for 8 hours and served it over mashed potatoes that I cooked separately. Very tasty!

Absolutely loved this receipe! Did however change it up a little bit. I read some of the reviews and they all seemed to say the same thing... add more seasoning, more potatoes, etc. Will definately make again.

It was very good but it needed something else.  I used another reviewers suggestion on using cream of chicken with roasted garlic which made it tastier, but I think that the next time, and there will be, I am going to put some mushrooms and double the beans and soup.  Will let everyone know how this goes. Overall I recommend this recipe.

Family was just getting over an illness and wanted something bland, easy and uneventful.  This was it.  Don't get me wrong, I got what I wanted and I will make this again.  BUT I have to say I left out the water and just dumped the soup over the pork chops in the crockpot and boiled little red potatoes separately and nixed the greenbeans all together.  Meat fell apart.  I ended shredding mine and serving over my tators.  It was good.

I found this recipe and thought it would be easy and different. I can honestly say it was different.It had absolutely no flavor and the appearance of the chops was scary to say the least. The chops stuck together in one big clump. I will NEVER make it again.

Followed directions and everything stuck to sides of slow cooker. I think the time is way to long to cook.

I didn't think this recipe was all that exceptional. I did as others suggested and put the potatoes in with the chops. I also added a little seasoning(salt, pepper and garlic powder) to the chops. But it still came out rather bland and the chops weren't all that tender either. I could do the same and get more flavor by doing this on the stove. I won't be using this recipe again.

The pork chops were tough.  The sauce was ok - it tasted like what it was ... cream of mushroom soup.  I added garlic to try to add flavor, but it didn't help much.  I will probably not make this again.  There are better slow cooker pork chop recipes on this site.  In sum, it was bland but passable.

I served this for supper on Sunday. Everyone gave it a five star rating with no hesitation. Instead of water I used chicken broth and I added garlic powder, onion powder, and Tex Joy steak seasoning.

Great Recipe everyone in the family loved it.  Only thing i did different was use cream of mushroom and garlic soup, and canned diced potatoes.  Will use this one in my regular meal planning.
