I had some goat milk that I wanted to use, and came upon this recipe.  I started this in a saucepan, and very quickly changed to a dutch oven type pot.  When this first starts to boil, it will boil up fast, and can potentially make a huge mess on your stove.  Use a pot much bigger than you'll think you'll need.  The mixture took about 20 minutes to reach 245 degrees, and yes, it's a LOT of stirring, but well worth it!  It's a very tasty fudge!!!
