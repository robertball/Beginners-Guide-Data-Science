I needed to make cookies for the Cookie Exchange at my workplace. I didn't have eggs on hand, so I needed something simple. This cookie recipe worked out perfectly! I just dipped the cookie stamp in red sugar before stamping the cookies. I'm sure this recipe will impress my co-workers! My kids loved them, and I think they are delicious and easy to make.

Wonderful twist on the traditional sugar cookie.
Crunchier than I would have liked, I will try cutting the bake time.

I found the chocolate to be overpowering for this delicate cookie.  In addition, I just don't find cookies that are pressed by a glass to be visually attractive. I think I will keep searching for a better almond cookie & pass on making this one again.

very tasty cookie. I rolled mine in powdered sugar after they were baked and had cooled slightly instead of the chocolate. I thought it made for a great taste.

I found this recipe very dry and crumbly.  The balls would not stick together very well and fell apart.  Not very attractive.

Yum.  

This recipe was quick and easy, and made yummy cookies for my poor miserable sick toddler, even though I had no eggs in the house!  He's happily licking off the chocolate drizzle and dipping them in cocoa.  I think start to finish it was only 45 minutes in the kitchen.

These cookies were a great addition to my Italian Thanksgiving dessert.  I served them with a creamy Mascarpone mousse and everyone loved them!!
I did however omit the chocolate as it seemed like it might be a little much.

they smelled soooo good coming out of the oven, i didn't realize they were more of a shortbread cookie, but good for sure! i might add a little more sugar next time so they aren't so bland in the middle.

I didn't think they had any flavor and I made them exactly the way the recipe said minus the chocolate on the top.

These cookies came out perfect the first time.  They taste like something bought in a store.

My Grandmother had a similar recipe that I grew up eating. I made these the other day and they turned out great! I like mine with the chocolate on top and kept chilled in the fridge. Very easy to make!!!
