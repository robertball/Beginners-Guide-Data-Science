Very tasty cookie that will help get some protein in teenagers that seem to always be "too in a hurry" to eat a healthy snack.   I had to use garbanzo beans because I can't find pinto beans where I live. The amaranth is crunchy, the raisins are chewy and sweet and the cookie itself is soft and tender.  A very nice textured cookie I'd say.  The ginger and the cinnamon were subtle and think that might be the garbanzo bean being a bit more overpowering than a pinto bean so might increase the two spices the next time. All-in-all this is a nice treat that isn't too sweet, a plus in my house and a kid pleaser so a keeper of a recipe.  I followed the amounts exactly and it rendered 527 grams of "batter". I made 24 cookies weighing approx. 22 grams each. I used a melon baller to scoop. The cookies were bite-sized which the kids liked. These will be nice for putting in lunch and snack bags. Worked great as a power boost for those after swimming lesson treats. Thanks Sueb for the recipe.

I substituted chick peas for pinto beans, quinoa for amaranth & added chocolate chips.... very nice light cookie... I used the tablespoon to shape these cookies & keep them small, then used a fork to flatten them down just before putting them in the oven... The quinoa adds a nice little crispiness.... could add a little bit more next time... This recipe will definitely be on my repeat list!

Okay, in all fairness, I didn't have pinto beans, so I used northern beans.  I did not care for it.
