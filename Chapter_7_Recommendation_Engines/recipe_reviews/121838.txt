Thank you Arnold for this wonderful recipe! My husband and I both loved it. We like our food on the hot/spicy side so I did use a nice spicy curry and added a small red chili pepper - I could imagine also adding some potatoes and chicken pieces to this recipe as well - but not because it was missing something - just for a change. I will be cooking this soup often - it's a keeper!

This soup tastes like it is bad for you, but really it is quite healthy.  Yummy.  I added extra curry power and some chili flakes to spice it up.  It was very quick and easy.  I will definitely make this again.

Just finished making this soup. Wonderfully tasty and fabulously easy! I did however, add 3 garlic cloves and once all the vegetables were softened, I blended the whole thing. I only used about 3 pinches of curry powder and added some coriander powder as well. Added 1 1/2 cups of milk. Will definitely make again.

Very good.  To make just a little more soup, I added 1 cup water, one more teaspoon boullion, 1/4 teaspoon more curry powder, and a diced Yukon Gold potato. I also pureed about 1.5 cups of the soup at the end.  This recipe has a wonderful curry flavor without being overpowering or spicy.  It's also pretty healthy!

So simple and so good! Thank you! I used the complete leeks and wasn't that fussy with measurements of veggies. I took another suggestion and used coconut milk and it was fantastic. Made it again with just water and a little more bullion and it was still great. Also added red cabbage for a little color. Perfect pot for fall weather!

Great base! I didn't use carrots and celery, instead, I used diced red bell pepper. Not only I had bell peppers to use up, I knew it would compliment the curry. I also followed other reviewers advice and used regular milk.

I have made leek soup for years but never used curry before.... I won't make it WITHOUT curry again!  My husband was skeptical when I told him I was using curry in it....after a few bites he told me this was a keeper...we both loved it...Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is awesome! I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out because it's so simple. I am vegan so I just used vegetable broth, a vegetable bouillon cube, and coconut milk in place of evaporated milk and it was great.

The soup was very good and easy. Everyone loved it! I added a little cornstarch to give it a more silky texture. I seldom repeat recipes, but my boyfriend said "Make this again!" before he was half way through.

My husband walked in the door while this was simmering and instantly said, "Wow,  that smells great!"  Extremely easy to prepare.  I'll be making this frequently.  I added a little bit of Tumeric and ginger to kick up the eastern flavor.

We loved this soup!  It was full of flavor and so filling.  I did add 2 baked, diced chicken breasts and a diced potato just to make it stretch for my family of 6.  I did everything else exactly as written.  Served with buttered SF sourdough, it was amazing.  I highly recommend and look forward to making it again soon.

First curried thing I've ever liked.  I was uncertain as to whether it was red or black pepper...  Went with red.  Added 1 1/2 t curry and ~1 t red pepper, to make it spicy enough for me.  Added about 1-2 C extra water at the end as it had cooked down.

Great soup! I added a potato, ginger, and extra curry powder per recommendation of other reviews. I also didn't skimp on the garlic or pepper. I threw in a llittle dried basil and cayenne (I wanted a little kick of heat)--turned out pretty yummy! :)

VERY tasty. Made it as written except left out the celery, which I don't like. Next time will make it more substantial by adding potatoes, chicken, cashews and substituting half the milk with coconut milk. I'm sure regular, non-evaporated milk would work well too.

Wow!!!  Well I didn't have any problem with the soup being thin...I only had one leek on hand so I used a vidalia onion as well.  I tried the soup with just 1% milk (no condensed) but then opted for half lite coconut and half 1% milk.  Absolutely awesome!!!!  Raves all around.

This soup has a great flavor, but the consistency is way too thin.  I wouldn't call this "hearty".  In fact, it's more like an appetizer soup, than a meal soup.  By the way, I doubled it and it served six perfectly.

This is a very good recipe. My husband who is the pickiest eater in the world loves it. I make it with low fat butter to sautee the veggies and add good chunky whole wheat bread next to a big bowl of this every winter. I have recommended to my friends.

The flavor of this soup is wonderful, but I prefer a thicker cream soup.  Will make again and reduce amount of water or add thickener.  Thanks - we enjoyed it!

This was an easy and delicious soup.  I don't have a blender, so I skipped that step and it still turned out deliciously.  I will definitely make this again, but the second time I plan to add more carrots.

One of the tastier low fat soups I've made. I really like the idea of using nonfat condensed milk. I used veggie bouillon base instead of chicken. I also added 4 small finely cubed yukon gold potatoes, only because I had them. Yum!

Delicious - I did a vegetarian version with no bullion and vegetable stock. Also added some potatoes for texture.

I have to admit I was kind of worried while cooking it, I didn't think I was going to like it at all. But I was very pleasantly surprised.  I used a little more veggies than the recipe called for and I used 2% milk instead of evaporated.  Also I just blended it lightly with a hand blender still leaving it chunky instead of pureeing 1 cup separately.  I don’t typically give out 5 stars but it was great!

Very nice soup - it will be added to my list of favourites.  Next time I might up the curry to 1 teaspoon for a little more zip.

This soup has become something I cook practically weekly. I am severely allergic to chicken so I use vegetable stock and "Not Chick'n" bullion cubes,  I'm also allergic to dairy, so I use either almond milk or coconut milk.  The results are excellent.  I especially like thickening the soup with a puréed vegetables instead of cornstarch or gluten free flour (yeah allergic to gluten too), and I am looking to use that thickening method in my other recipes. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!

Great recipe! I roasted cauliflower and fingerling potatoes in the oven at 400 with some olive oil, salt and cumin for 60 minutes and added these along with a jar of cannelini beans to the recipe and it was delicious. I also upped the curry to 2 tablespoons and - rather than adding the milk - I put 2 cups of soup in th blender and added it back to the soup. It was plenty creamy without having to add the milk. Delicious recipe. Thank you for posting it!

great soup! I added some sweet potato and used veggie broth instead of chicken broth still turned out delicious! (and i didn't puree it) Definately a nice change to the usual leek soup.  Little spicey, little sweet, and all yummy!

I am a vegetarian and so I used Veggie broth instead. I also added a good amount of cracked pepper and 3/4 tsp curry. I  used 4 med leeks and increased the broth. This has a fantastic flavor and I will make it again. Thanks.

I often end up with leeks because we get a fruit and veggie delivery box. At first I didn't even know what they were (I'm young haha), and so did not have any recipes to use them in. I am thrilled to have found this recipe. It is delicious and I make it often. I don't have granules (don't know what they are either haha) but I just add salt to taste at the end.  Delicious! Thank you!

Very good. This soup tasted great and is versatile. I've made it adding potatoes, mushrooms and other ingredients. It works best, tho with evaporated milk or half and half. Thanks for posting!

Delicious! The flavors are lovely. It made a thin soup, but very satisfying. It's great just like it is, but I could see adding chicken or potato for a change in texture.

Fantastic!  Of course I made a few adjustments based on what I had on hand.  I used Videlia onions instead of leeks as mine had turned. So, from there, I took the advise of other reviews and added more veggie and used a hand blender to puree (but left it a bit chunky)  I also doubled the spice & threw in a pinch of chili flakes. The crowning touch was a substitute of lite coconut milk instead of the evaporated... the result was devine!  I served with a honey-glazed bun with a slight sweet taste.  The complimentarly flavors worked very well.

This was the best soup I have ever made. Wouldn't think of using milk in place of evaporated milk. It was rich and creamy. The leeks were such a delight mixed with the curry. Thank you soooo much for sharing.

this soup was very good however i found it to be a little bit salty...perhaps because of the boullion granules..? Next time I will add 1 tsp of chicken boullion granules and some other veggies. Very nice soup...will definitely make again:)

this is a winner! super easy and easy to alter,too,and still get great results. i used veggie broth instead of chicken and half and half instead of evo milk, yum,yum,yummy. but on the way home from the GS i thought this would be really good if i had used half coconut milk and half reg. milk for a really athentic curry flavor. i also added some shallots from the garden for extra flavor. really good stuff. great recipe!
