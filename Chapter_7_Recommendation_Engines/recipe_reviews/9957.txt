I had heard that these were delicious & decided to make them for a cookie exchange. Although the taste was good, there were some modifications that needed to be made because they turned out too dry. Instead of using 5 (5 oz.) cans of noodles, use only 3. This will hold everything together without them falling apart. Also, scoop out about a heaping tablespoon worth, drop on the parchment paper, & then flatten out with the back of the spoon. People found it a bit difficult to get their mouth around the mound so I flattened them. After that, they were delicious.

With just slight differences in amounts, this easy and delicious little no-bake treat has been on my Christmas Cookie Plate for close to 30 years. I use 18 ozs. of chocolate chips, a 12 oz. pkg. butterscotch chips, 5-6 ozs. chow mein noodles (4 cups) and 6-8 ozs. of peanuts (1-1/2 cups). A sentimental favorite.

I started making this recipe back in 1999 for a work party, and have been requested to make these cookies every year since.  I end up having to make a double-batch because my husband ends up eating too many when I am not looking.  I tend to use an entire bag of chocolate & butterscotch chips and a 12oz bag of chow mein noodles and 1/2 a jar of peanuts.  Very tasty!

These were really good! I did however change it a little bit. I didn't put in peanuts because I didn't have any and I used crunched up pretzels instead of chow mein noodles. The combination of sweet and salty is amazing!

This is an annual recipe with my bunch for Christmas.  It isn't Christmas if I don't make them.  Like chocolate bars. Just work fast when you are dropping them so they don't harden too soon.

This recipe is so easy and is great for getting my kids involved in cooking.  I omitted the peanuts b/c my daughter is severly allergic to them.  I added a few more ounces of chow mein noodles to the chocolate and butterscotch to take the place of the peanuts.  Delicious!!!

These are very easy to make - so after making roll out cookies, they really are a breeze. I used 1 1/2 cups of each of the chips (because that's how much is in each bag), still the 12 ounces of peanuts and 10 ounces of chow mein noodles, which seems to be a good ratio of chocolate and noodles. This recipe would be great fun to make with children - just have a facecloth near by :-). Thanks for the recipe Judy.

I ommitted the peanuts and added 1/2 cup peanut butter to the chips instead. I only used 15 ozs of chow mein noodles because it looked like I was running low on melted chips and was afraid it wouldn't stick together well. They came out fantastic!

We make these every Christmas.  We add a little more butterscotch chips than semi sweet chips.  We also use less chow mien noodles (maybe 20 oz. instead of the 25 oz.)

My daughter and I made these little candies/cookies. I thought they were easy to make, a you might have to clump them tightly together so they don't crumble apart after they are cooled. I did change the recipe a bit, so that there was the chocolate/butterscotch to hold them together.  I used only 12 oz. of chow mein noodles and didn't use peanuts, but I did only use the 12 oz. bags of chocolate & butterscotch chips, so that might have been the difference with the moisture for the recipe

Great classic recipe.  I feel like the ratio of melted chocolate to chow mein noodles and peanuts is not quite right.  It doesn't seem to coat them quite enough, so I would use more chocolate and/or less noodles.  I did make a variation of using butterscotch chips and white chocolate chips and mixed in heath toffee bits with the noodles.  That was an amazing combo!

My husband LOVES butterscotch, and these are some of his favorites! 

I made these and put them in my Christmas Goodie Bags. They are a  fab addition to lots of cookies and chocolate, quick and easy to make.

I melt my butterscotch in a metal bowl atop a pot of boiling water (double boiler) and i make sure the water is simmering only.  if it is boiling and the water is touching the bowl you have it up TOO HIGH.   Constantly stir until your chips are melted and them dump the rest of the ingredients and stir.

The tricky part is probably forming them onto the cookie sheet with parchment paper....just use two spoons and push them onto the tray


yummy and easy!!!

These are an old family favorite of mine, but I didn't know the recipe, and this one matched almost perfectly. I use 4 cups butterscotch chips, no chocolate, as that's how my family always did it, but I'm sure they'd be just as good with chocolate, too. Great for the holidays.

delish! reminds me of the ones I enjoyed as a child. Very easy and filling. Wonderful for a sweet tooth. I'm going to try these for "Easter baskets" with chocolate eggs.

Super easy to make and would be a great recipe to make with kids since there is so many variations you can do. I used chopped walnuts on just the top of a few. I also suggest less noodles to start and add as needed

My family honestly requests this over anything else that I'm willing to make, from scratch as well. These are super tasty and easy to make. Great to do with kids.

Very easy and tasty. I found alternating the melted mixture and then noodles helped.  It was easier to mix and made it evenly coated.

This is such an easy recipe and people rave about them every time I make them!  This time I changed it up a bit and my friends loved the change!  I used an 18 oz. bag of semi-sweet chocolate, 1/2 a cup of extra chunky honey roasted peanut butter, 2 cups of Heath bar bits, and 16 oz. of chow mein noodles.  I melted every thing in a double boiler and scooped out  lightly packed 1/4 cup onto the wax paper.  It made 40 haystacks

I enjoyed this recipe until I tried the Peanut Butter haystack recipe!  Both are good but the other one is better!

Be careful with the chips...I cooked them too long twice. I ended up only having to microwave them for 1 1/2 minutes and my microwave isn't a strong one. Other than than they were pretty good. I prefer the all p'nut butter ones, though.
