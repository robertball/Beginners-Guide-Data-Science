This is a great base to start with.  I added fresh basil, garlic, and oregeno.  It would be great with artichokes and/or mushrooms added also.  It got my extra picky husband to eat eggplant so I'm thrilled!

Made this tonight and it turned out delicious.  I started by cooking some onions first, followed by eggplant and mushrooms.  For the sauce I added a combination of Italian whole canned tomatoes, and pureed tomatoes.  The roasted red peppers give the sauce a nice smokey sweetness.  I also added garlic, Italian seasoning, oregano, and basil, as well as fennel seed.  I learned from another excellent recipe on this site to add the fennel and it really make the sauce taste nice and meaty, sans the meat.  I also made the pita cheese bread with the paprika and that was quite good too.

My favorite (obviously).  Please try it, and tell me what you think.  The cheese bread can obviously be made seperately -- it's delicious even alone.  Somehow allrecipes messed up the pita bread recipe.  Here is a corrected version.  Open the pitas, put a light and even spread of butter on the insides.  Sprinkle lots of parmesan cheese and then put on some SWEET PEPRIKA -- i like to make a light sprinkling across each piece.


If you want, you can saute some garlic and onions before you throw in the egglant chunks.  The cubes of egglant should be about 1/2 x 1/2".  

The sauce is even better when you weave in some mozzarella cheese at the end when you're mixing the pasta and the sauce together.

This was a good recipe. It takes a while to cook, but my fiance (who doesn't eat eggplant) even enjoyed it. We did add chunks of chicken the recipe which made it more filling.

This recipe was so simple! I've never even dared cook eggplant before, and the dish just turned out so delicious. I made it with the crushed tomatoes that come with the Italian herbs, and put some slices of provolone on top of the sauce to melt right before I served it over whole wheat pasta. The roasted red peppers put the flavor right over the top!

The only change I made to this recipe (having made it a couple of times) is to reduce the amount of roasted red peppers.  Other than that, the sauce is sublime!

I love eggplant so I enjoyed this, it did however lack flavor.  I added parmesean cheese to the skillet.  I also cooked chicken on the side in butter, garlic and fresh parsley.  When cooked through I added it to the eggplant and tomatoes.  It tasted much better.

The cheesy pita pockets are what make this recipe, otherwise it's difficult to taste anything outside of the tomato stew.  Would probably not make again.

This was just OK, the eggplant took a lot longer than it was supposed to soften.

I found it to be way too sweet.  Also, I imagine sauteed onion would be a wonderful addition.

Really very good. I just didn't add the roasted peppers (didn't have any) and used Gemelli pasta - and it was yum... even for my 4-year-old :)

Fantastic recipe - one of the best vegetarian pastas I have had. 

I did add some onion, garlic, and oregano in the beginning, and a little bit of shredded mozarella towards the end. Also I mixed the sauce and pasta together for a few minutes so that there was no way for my 2 year old to avoid the veggies - turned out he loved the sauce and was picking out the eggplant pieces to eat them directly.

Not my type of sauce. Too acidic. I feel that zuccini gives a very smooth and savory taste. Eggplant just isnt meant for this type of sauce. Sorry

3.18.13 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/73915/ziti-and-eggplant/ ... Since I'm giving this a good review, I don't feel badly about minor changes. I like experimenting & learning from others' trys. I can't help it! :D Added an onion, 4 cloves garlic, 1T dried oregano, no peppers. Blended to hide the eggplant. It worked! KK liked it so much she requested it two days later. :o :) Also added 1/8t fennel, ground. The sauce turned orange-y in one batch so I'll divide it in two next time. Not a big deal, just me being weird. ;D 'Didn't do the pitas, but I'll get there someday. Put about half pound italian blend cheese in & remaining half on top. Thanks for an inexpensive & pretty healthy meal!

This is interesting, needs something else to add some flavor.  I added tomatoes with chili's and that spiced it up a bit, but it still needs a little something.  To make it cook quicker I put it in a pressure cooker for 10 minutes (instead of the 45 min in pot).  The eggplant was very tender and perfect.  Maybe some parm cheese on top would be good.  I will saute some onions and garlic to add next time.

I used whole wheat pasta instead of ziti.  This is SO tasty! The eggplant absorbed all of the flavors and I couldn't even tell I was eating eggplant.

Very Good!!  I made this without the cheesy pitas, I just substituted garlic bread and it was excellent!  The only thing, I had to use a nonstick pan when I sauted the eggplant...started out in a regular and it was sticking since there is not alot of olive oil, and I also halved the red pepper as was suggested.  Will definately make this again!  I cooked for 4 adults and there was nothing left!

I added garlic and onion and sautéed it with the eggplant. Also added spiced pepper paste with crushed tomatoes.  Delicious hot and cold.

I didn't have any roasted red pepper, so I roasted a green pepper at 500 degrees for about 20 minutes. I blobbed ricotta on the top when I served it.  This is a great dish!

Excellent! Subbed coconut oil, used jarred sauce, used dried red peppers.  This was just great and I will make this many more times.  Thanks for giving me the idea of putting eggplant with mac and sauce.

I've made this a few times now. It doesn't wow me--lacks flavor as written. I'll keep making it, but add more Italian seasoning and perhaps simply salt & pepper to make it more interesting.
