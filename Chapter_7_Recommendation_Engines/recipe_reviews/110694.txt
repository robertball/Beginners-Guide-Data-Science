I've been gradually working my way through my pantry and freezer so that I can start from scratch to support my healthier lifestyle while doing my best to eat healthy while I do this. I used organic applesauce, whole wheat flour, I added a teaspoon of baking powder and used pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon. These baked up perfectly and smelled amazing while doing so. My kids each had one for snack and right after, asked for a second. I guess I don't understand the first rating to be a one star. This was great for us, made a little healthier. Moist and fruity and not too sweet.....a great all-around muffin. I'll make these again soon.
