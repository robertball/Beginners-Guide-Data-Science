WOW!   not to brag, but the changes i made to this recipe...i truly think they were the best mashed potatoes i have ever eaten.  used about 7 medium russet potatoes, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 stick REAL butter, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, 2 cloves garlic (mashed up), sea salt, and cracked black pepper.  the KEY to making mashed potatoes creamy is NOT to over mix.  set your mixer on about a "4" and mix until it resembles the texture of frosting.  also, scrape the sides once about halfway thru the mixing.  be careful not to fold too much when you scrape...all that GOOD mixing you are doing to FLUFF your potatoes will be wasted!  total...i mix for about 1.5 minutes, scrape the sides, and mix for another 1.5-2.5 minutes.

I used 3 lbs. of Yukon potatoes. I kept the butter amount the same, but only used 4 oz. of cream cheese. I didn't have fresh chives so I used about a tablespoon of dried. I only used 1/3 c. of parmesan cheese and added 1/4 c. of hot whole milk. I also upped the garlic just a bit, to two minced cloves.

With my alterations, these are KILLER. 
Even my husband who isn't huge on dinner compliments raved about these and went back for seconds. They are so rich and decadent. I wouldn't make them all the time but every now and again is a nice change from my standard mashed potato recipe.

This mashed potato dish compliments the Awesome Pot Roast really well.

EDITED TO ADD 10/07/08: I suggest you try my modifications, double the recipe and eat the leftovers the next day. They are insane good.

I would give the flavor of these potatoes 5 stars.  I would give the recipe as written 3 stars-- my compromise is 4.
I used 3# of potatoes for 3 people and we had a good bit leftover.  I eyeballed the other ingredients and kept tasting them until it had the flavor I wanted.
They're very good, but the recipe is way off as written.

I surprised no one else questioned this, but the recipe says to use 1 pound of potatoes.  1 pound of potatoes is probably one potato.  I used 8 since it was supposed to make eight servings.  I had to use twice as much butter and add milk just to be able to stir the potatoes.  I also only used about half the garlic it called for and it was still extremely strong.  It was ok, but I won't make it again.

Made exactly according to the recipe, the consistency is like glue.  Way too much cheese for the amount of potatoes.  If I made these again I would follow the advice of other reviewers who recommend scaling back on the amount of cream cheese and adding some milk.

This recipe was very delicious!  To make the mixture more garlicky, I boiled several garlic cloves with the potatoes; when they were soft they were easier to blend with the mixture.  I, like previous others, thought the mixture needed some added smoothness.  Milk solved the problem.

So I cheated a little and consolidated this recipe with the "night-before" mashed potato recipe... I had to make them for Thanksgiving (which was at my aunt's house, about two hours away, and to avoid traffic, we had to get up and drive there 10 hrs before dinner would be served).   Only SUBSTITUTING half the parmesan cheese for it's equivalence of sour cream, garlic salt for the garlic since I didn't have any on hand, omitted the chives for the same reason, garnished with sprinkles of paprika, freshly grated salt and pepper, then baked the refrigerated mashed potatoes at 350 degrees, for 15-20 minutes...   THEY WERE A HUGE HIT! Creamy, whipped-like, and flavorful. People who said that they didn't even LIKE mashed potatoes went back for seconds! I was nominated official mashed potato maker for every holiday occasion =) And there were leftovers of almost every other dish, except for these, which was almost licked off the entire tray, AND people were still asking if there were more. I had tripled the recipe! You just can't go wrong. Thanks for the recipe idea!

These are so easy that I make them all the time.  I do have to add a bit of milk because they tend to get a little dry.  I also like to add some shredded cheese (for cheese lover hubby).  These are great.  Thanks for posting.

Very good flavor, but consistency was not what I was expecting.  Agree that you need to scale back on the cheese and add some milk to achieve more creamy texture.  I'll definitely make again with the adjustments.

I've cut the parmesean cheese amount in half and added milk. Otherwise these are just too dry and sticky. I also reccommend light cream cheese as well.

I've tried several mashed potato recipes from this website, but this is the first one like what I've been looking for! These are dense, rich, creamy mashed potatoes like the ones I enjoy at nice restaurants. They are definitely not the healthiest, which is why I cannot make them very often. My boyfriend also agrees that they're excellent :)

Okay, I am not a great cook - No, I mean it!  This was my first attempt at making homemade mashed potatos and I just have to say that it was fantastic!  This recipe is soooooo easy and the results were really tasty.  I followed the recipe to the letter and they were delicious.  My kids were so impressed.  Thank you for sharing this!

It's a great recipe but you MUST ADD MILK, Sour cream or even 1/2 and 1/2 or heavy cream!  That's where the "fluffiness" comes from.

This recipe is outstanding, very decadent, and not low cal so don't make it too often and enjoy thoroughly as all those you share it will.  I have made this several times and last time I boiled the potatoes with the garlic (4 whole cloves) in leftover chicken broth but kept the recipe the same.

I made this for Thanksgiving and no one could get the mashed potatoes off their spoons it was that thick. Perhaps I used too much cream cheese ??? It was thick paste!

No vampires at my house! If you like garlic you will love these.  If you want to keep your wife from passing out when you speak you will roast your garlic in the oven (wrapped in foil) for about 45 mins before you add it to this wonderful recipe.

hmmm, do better potatoes exist? No, not likely. The best I've ever made. No question about it. Changes.... less cream cheese, less parmesan. Just taste it as you go to find your perfect taste. Yummy.

Delish! They were really thick so I added a decent bit of milk. In the future, I would cut it down to 1 cup of cream cheese and 1/3 or 1/4 head of garlic. But all in all, I'll definitely be making these again! A fantastic recipe to toy around with.

Great flavor, but too dry.  I would either add milk or skip the "drying" part or both.  Otherwise, I love the combination of the Yukon, Parm and cream cheese.

Great potatoes. Being a recent college grade and having no electric way to beat these beasts was hard. College took a toll on my upper body strength.

I loved the amount of garlic and chives in this recipe. We left out the cream cheese but they were amazing even without it. They were even better the next day.

Didn't like the texture.  Flavor was good, but they were pasty.  I'll try sour cream instead of cream cheese instead next time.

Wow, I was so impressed with this recipe.  I have never made my own Mashed Potatoes before, and this was relatively easy, and incredibly delicious.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the milk and butter, which made it perfect!!!

I make this for pot luck and the holidays. I’m going to give you my recipe as I have now made this for almost 20 years! 5 lbs Yukon gold potatoes salted and boiled with 4 cloves garlic, 1 cup heavy cream,1 8oz cream cheese, 1 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup Parmesan cheese, 2 tablespoons garlic powder, 1/2 cup of fresh chives, salt and pepper to taste. Make sure to get yours because they get devoured. I found these to be less sticky then the recipe as written.

These were voted 5 stars by all at my dinner table tonight! I had to add quite a bit of  milk as they came out very thick. I did use 3 lbs of potatoes and adjusted the parmesan. I used roasted garlic, 8 oz. of softened cream cheese, and 1/2 container of freeze dried chives. 4 stars for the ingredients, and 5 after I adjusted the ratios.

My family really loved this dish.  It was made for Christmas.  It may have had a bit too much garlic in it.  I would make it with a bit less next time.

Love these.  I recommend to make them close to the original recipe.  Adding extra milk does diminish the great taste, but can be necessary.  Just know you may need to increase other ingredients with too much milk.

This recipe's flavors were phenomenal. We made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it stole the show. Everyone agreed that it was the best part of the meal! The only thing I will change next time I make this is to use slightly less garlic - it was pretty strong, which is why I'm giving it a 4 rather than a 5. If you love lots of garlic though, leave this as is.

I thought these were pretty good.  But I was extremely surprised there is not milk or cream in them.  I followed the directions as written and they were way to dry.  I added a whole pint of heavy whipping cream and they came out awesome.  I will definitely make these again with the added cream.

I Give this Recipe 4 1/2 stars.  I loved the taste but as others have suggested the consistency is a little thick.  I  used a container of Philadalphia Whipped Cream Cheese (cut recipe back to serve 4) but next time I think I'll use half the cream cheese and half light sour cream.  Or maybe add milk...I still have to tweak a bit.  I used red potatoes and left the peel on.  I also added a turnip to the mix and I loved that!  I would cut back on the garlic a bit too.....was a little overpowering.  Great base recipe though!  Thanks!!!!

There is no way this recipe can work as written so I followed tips from other users and adjusted the ingredients, otherwise there would be too much cheese. I also added a few splashes of heavy cream to get the consistency I wanted. With my adjustments they came out very good.

I should have read the other reviews before I started cooking.  I only had one cup of parmesan cheese on hand, and even with that halved amount it dominated the taste of the potatoes! Even with the suggestions of other reviewers I do not think I would make this again.

Love these potatoes! I actually make them ahead then put them in individual size souflee dishes and bake them. If they are cold about 30 min on 350 if frozen about 45 mins to an hour. Throw a few italian bread crumbs, parm and chives on top. They turn out golden brown on the top and are so pretty.

These are the best potatoes with a little adjustment. I only used 4 oz. of cream cheese and 1/2 c of Parmesean cheese. Iy was the perfecr amount for my family and the taste was amazing. I used a little bit of milk when whipping them too.

These didn't work well at all. Too much garlic flavor and the texture was off. The potatoes became all grainy from the parmesan and they weren't creamy enough. I tried adding milk to thin them out but nothing helped. Thanks for the post though!

These are truely The Best Mashed Potatoes.  The name of this recipe does not lie.  I made this recipe just this past Thanksgiving, and everyone went back for seconds.  I also made it again just last night.  I would highly recommend these potatoes with the Aussie Chicken another All Recipes Recipe...............Both Top Favorite Recipes at my house.

I liked the flavor however I found these potatoes to be extremely dry (and I even added some heavy cream). I would probably make these again but add some more milk or cream to make it creamier.

Too gluey and too much chive and cheese flavor. I wish I had read the poor reviews before I started cooking. Hoping I can salvage this with their tips!

The potatoes were great!  My dh even went back for seconds!  I didn't have fresh chives so I used dried and they still tasted great.  Also, I didn't use 2 cups of Parmesan cheese, more like 1/2 cup.  Definitely will make again!

Everyone thought the potatoes were too salty and garlicy. I did just as the recipe said but they are really just mashed potatoes that aren't too special. But they are good.

I listened to some of the other reviews and sub'd 1 cup half and half for 1 cup Parmesan cheese... The potatoes were a beautiful consistency! These potatoes no doubt live up to their name... They are the best potatoes, yummmmmmm!

This is almost exactly my recipe for mashed potatoes but I go one step further on the fat scale and use 1/2 cup half & half rather than all milk.  These are truly the creamiest and best tasting mashed potatoes and you can alter the recipe by adding garlic or cheddar cheese - chives ... whatever your taste buds are calling for!!

I didn't use cream cheese but used sour cream. I didn't measure anything and used this recipe as a guide. Delicious!!!!! Boyfriend had two servings with homemade mushroom gravy.

5 stars on the flavor, but I think this recipe needs some milk added due to dryness.  Next time I will add some milk.

A bit heavy on the garlic, but a great and easy recipe for a first time cook like me. My family loved it.   Cooking time for potatoes was longer than 15 min. The store I went to was out of Yukon Gold potatoes so I used red potatoes.

this recipe was good.  I used low fat where possible and only did half the amount of cream cheese.  Don't overmix... this turns gluey very quickly!!

I added some milk and water so the mashed potatoes would be a better consistency. Without these 2 items, the potato consistency was very sticky and glue like but still tasted great. Served with "Melt-In-Your-Mouth Meat Loaf" and broccoli.

Worked out beauty in my quest to use up what we've got on hand.  Unfortunately, I agree with mandalin84... These were just "meh" - even with the changes I made.  (2 lbs Yukons, 3 oz RF Cream Cheese, 1/4 cp butter, handful of parmesan, garlic, milk - oh, left the skins on the 'tatoes, too).  Doubtful if this will have a repeat performance.

These were very thick, since no liquid was added. My hubby loved them, and while they did have a wonderful taste, I felt there was maybe a bit too much garlic; of course, that could be adjusted by the size of the cloves used. And, per other reviewers, I added some chili powder, and some cayenne (1/4 tsp)and thought the additions were a bit overpowering; maybe cut back to 1/8 tsp of the cayenne.

VERY GOOD!!!!  My family loved these potatoes!!  I couldn't get fresh chives but used green onions instead and the results were still wonderful!  Pretty easy to do but I didn't have a masher so had to use my husband and his muscles with a wooden spoon instead.  Excellent... this is a must-try!

Wow. I have never made real mashed potatoes before, and I have no idea why not! They were very easy to make. I doubled the butter and used evaporated milk, but only 3/4 cup. I think it would've been too liquidy if I had used a whole cup. Check out the allrecipes step by step guide to making mashed potatoes - that helped me out by listing all of the steps in detail. I will never go back to potatoes in the box!

I used half of the parmesan cheese and they still tasted like parmesan with potatoes...instead of potatoes with parmesan.  They were so rich!  I won't be making these again without some serious modifications.

Pretty good! In regards to the "pound of potatoes"..all the yukon golds I am able to get at my grocery store are MUCH smaller than regular baking potatoes. With that said, I used a two lb bag of yukons...which took me forever to peel all those little guys. Also, I used 1 8oz cream cheese with chives instead of adding fresh chives and added a little half & half to make it easier to mash and mix.  Pretty good and went well with our steak dinner last night ("Awesome Steak Marinade" from this site). Would make these again!

I really love this type of potatoes, I order them as a side when my husband & I go out to our favorite resturant.  The kids on the other hand kinda "scanned" over them, (I'm sure it was all of the "green" from the chives).  Thanks Christina!

With a few minor adjustments to suit my family's taste, this recipe made the best mashed potatoes we've ever had!  I used only 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and scaled the cream cheese down to 3/4 cup.  I had to use about 1/4 cup heavy cream to get the right consistency. Soooo gooood

This is a great recipe. The hotel where we have our Christmas party every year serves the most wonderful mashed potatoes and I always wondered how they got them so thick and creamy. Now I know - cream cheese! Tip: I never peel potatoes. I cook my potatoes whole in the skins and then cut them in half when they're done and put them in a potato ricer cut side down. The potato goes through the ricer and the peel stays in the hopper. It does take longer to cook the potatoes whole, but you save all that peeling time! I also think the potatoes have much more flavor when they're cooked in their skins.

EXCELLENT!  I've never had a "perfect" mashed potato recipe...you always just adjust the proportions to your personal taste.  But this combination of ingred's is awesome!  Recommend boiling your fresh garlic with your potatoes and even using chicken broth to boil them in; or throw some bouillon in the water for a little bit extra umph.  Skins on or off....Really Really good.

Definitely too much garlic & cream cheese, even for 5lbs of potatoes, I paired down the potatoes to 3 lbs, the garlic to 3 pods or equivilent to same in finely minced, the cream cheese to 1 cup ...it was less overpowering for my taste, never the less, the recipe is excellent.

This is a great recipe and it indeed could use some milk/cream to make them better.  I hate parmesan cheese so left that out.  Good recipe if you add the milk or cream to make them fluffier.

I made these last Thanksgiving and they were SUPER yummy! I do believe I added more milk and I think this Thanksgiving I'll try sour cream rather than cream cheese. I think I added a dash of rosemary as well, and will probably experiment with that more. Delicious!

Very good!! I didn't follow the measurements exactly, just added in how much I know I like. I didn't have chives with me so that's the only thing I didn't add. However, I added in a packet (like ketchup packets from a fast food restaurant) of malt vinegar, parsley, and panko bread crumbing to give it a more think consistency.  Loved it!

Very very good.  I used all but 4 of the yukon gold potatoes in the huge plastic bag in the grocery store, so not sure how many pounds that is, but it makes a LOT.  Unfortunately I didn't have a lot of milk to add to them, so they weren't as creamy as I'd like, but they were delicious!  Will make steaks next to eat with potatoes.

Wonderful recipe!  I've made the recipe with garlic minced and also tried it with "roasting" the garlic before adding it. We prefer the slightly sweeter taste of the roasted garlic.  Some of us liked all the chives and some of us would prefer a little less, but this will be a permanent addition to my meal planning.

I have made this recipe twice now to rave reviews both times.  I used a little extra garlic and I would recommend fresh chives.  Also, when I had to reheat, I used table cream to soften and it tasted equally fantastic.

These were very good, however next time I will use fresh grated Parmesan for a smoother texture.  I topped with crumbled crisp fried bacon.

I used these as a base for twice baked potatoes.  Only thing I added was about 2 cups grated cheddar cheese-1/2 into the potato mixture, and 1/2 to top the potatoes back in the shell.

The flavor of the recipe was good, but too rich.  I doubled the potatoes and decreased the amount of cream cheese.  I also added some milk to make them creamier.  I added a little bit of cheddar cheese to enhance the flavor.

This is a **GREAT** recipe. The only comment I have about it is that **is** is a bit rich. I'm personally going to try doubling the amount of potatoes in the next run, but that's just me :)

This recipe was quick, easy and delicious.  I used red potatoes and added a 1/2 cup of milk.  Also used dried chives and less cheese.  Went great with my meatloaf.

This was my first time using cream cheese in mashed potatoes. That combined with the Parmesan cheese was just too much! The dish was way too dense. As soon as the mashed potatoes cooled even slightly, they turned into a solid thick mass. It just boils down to me liking a bit more thinner and creamier mashed potatoes. I would not make this particular recipe again.

Great ingredients - I use a different technique

. I cut potatoes in half (do not peel) and cook until desired stage.  I put each half thru a potato ricer cut side down - the peel will be left and you have perfectly crushed potatoes with no lumps. 

Add other ingredients - preferably cut into smaller pieces.  Stir and you are done.  So much easier and the potatoes never turn out lumpy or over beaten.

Simple and easy potatoes to make.  I followed Chef Johns video instructions and they turned out great.  I have made my potatoes in the past with chive and onion cream cheese and that made my potatoes taste great!  I like both recipes, but this one has less fat and taste great.  I made mine with 2% milk too!  If you like Garlic add that when you season with salt and pepper.  I actually only seasoned with Cajun seasoning the first time I made these...mistake of grabbing the wrong spice.  Still amazing.  Great recipe to use and add your own spices too.

I've actually done a similar recipe to this most of the time, i just never used Parmesan cheese. somehow the potato peeler went missing, and i was not sure how i was going to get it all done, so i just cut them into large wedges and discs and boiled them in salted water with 2 cubes of chicken bullion after they finished cooking i tossed in two sticks of salted butter, a block of philly 1/3 less fat cream cheese, just dumped in the Parmesan in approximation to my potatoes (don't think i had quite 5lbs,) and palm fulls of salt and a little lighter on the pepper. One other thing i did different was instead of hand mash, i had a hand mixer and when i taste tested, these are SUPER creamy, the flavor is delicious, and there are still little bits of skin here and there from what didnt get peeled off and these potatoes are just amazing.  this will be my recipe from now on. SO good.

I followed Sarah Jo's modifications and they came out fine, they're just nothing special. I like the flavor better wo the cream cheese and Parmesan cheese and just using cream or milk warmed with the garlic in it.

WOW!!! These were SOOOOO good! I needed a side to serve with stuffed pork chops and this turned out to be a fantastic choice. Other than not being creamy enough for my liking, these are nearly perfect as is. I added a bit of warm milk until I achieved the consistency I wanted (just eyeball it) and voila - perfectly creamy mashed potatoes! Thanks SO much for sharing your fantastic recipe, Christina! These are the most flavorful spuds I've ever eaten! :-)

Not bad as far as mashed potatoes go but I thought this recipe left them fairly dry and heavy; countered with milk and sour cream but it took a lot before I got anywhere.

These potatoes are fantastic! I made them for thanksgiving and boy did they go over great! The only change I made was to add a little  milk, just to thin them a bit, and then they were perfect! I will make these in place of my regular mashed potatoes from now on!

I used this recipe with some tweaks and it turned out amazing. I replaced the cream cheese with a pint of heavy whipping cream, used russet potatoes (what I had on hand) and boiled the potatoes in chicken broth. Otherwise did not change anything, other than to top it off with some cheddar and bacon in a casserole dish and finish it in the oven. Amazing flavor, and after reading other reviews about the dish's consistency, I'm glad I made the sub for whipping cream. Will definitely make again.

I've been using this recipe for years now--I'm so glad it's been updated it to use 5 pounds instead of 1 pound of potatoes (which was kinda silly.)  ;)  I've tweaked it a little to use 10 potatoes which is probably close to 5 pounds (I'll see today!), 8 oz cream cheese, sometimes omitting the garlic, and adding about 1 cup milk to make creamy while mashing.  Enjoy!

These were very good! I also had to add some milk and a bit of heavy cream to make them more moist. I halved the recipe and it was just enough for 2 with leftovers for tomorrow!

I made these multiple times over the holiday season, and there were no leftovers each time.  I only added about 1/2 a cup of sour cream and a splash of milk to make them a little more creamy.  Rave reviews from everyone who tried them.

My husband and my very picky father-in-law gave these a 5. My own adaptation was to leave the skins on - and they came out great! Per the previous reviewers suggestions, I went with  decreasing the Parmesan to 1/2 cup, and decreasing the cream cheese to 4 oz - and then because of the stiff consistency, we added more milk until the consistency was right.  Thanks for sharing and making our Christmas brunch a little more special!

I love this dish.  It has just the right amount of garlic to satisfy without going overboard.  It was very tasty and easy to make.  A new favorite in my house.

This has been a standard "holiday" potato dish in my family for years.  I never really had the exact measurements to give to requesters, but this is a little more precise than my "pinch of this, scoop of that."  Thanks for posting.

The cream cheese and parmesan did nothing but add useless calories. The potatoes were very dry and did not taste good at all. I think I will stick to regular mashed potatoes from now on.

It was a good recipe, but seemed like A LOT of additional calories that didn't pay off in the flavor.  It was alright, but I don't know that I would waste the cream cheese and parmesan again *just* for mashed potatoes

These were not too different from regular mashed potatoes but they were good.I think they would have been a little better being mashed with a masher then a few seconds with a mixer.I think instead of using cream cheese with chives next time i'll do it the way the recipe says. maybe it will bring more flavor to the table.

I made a 1/5th of this for my husband and I and we both looved them...i boiled the potatoes in the microwave and used cream cheese/greek yogurt blend and Chobani sour cream/greek yogurt blend (and black truffle salt) for a healthier side dish.

This version is very good but it's really hard to go wrong with any mashed potatoe recipe, unless you're stingy with butter.  I didn't have any cream cheese so I used the equivalent amount of Mascarpone when making mine for just two people.  What I really liked in this dish was the parmesan.  This was excellent with buttered green beans and a small filet mignon and red wine and more wine! :-)

Way too strong on the garlic. Overpowered everything else on the plate. Also, not adding milk made these gluey when mashing and then they solidified and became one solid hard mass in the serving dish. Still edible, but I won't make these again.

Made these following the recipe exactly... Not sure why I thought they were not as good as the other reviewers, but my family thought they tasted like "good instant potatoes" and that wasn't a real compliment.  The potatoes were pasty and the parm cheese was overpowering, way too much.  Won't make these again.

These are REALLY Good!  So good they almost need to stand alone as it is ashamed to cover them with gravy or other food.  But that's why we make mashed potatoes...right?  I was a little skeptical as I had never made mashed potatoes without milk before.  And I'm sure the calorie count is much higher on these.  But worth it for those special occasions.

I was recently diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis and mashed potatoes have become a staple. When I tried these, I heard angels sing! These are the best. I have been making big batches and eating on demand. Man are these awesome!

Really yummy. Nice variation on the theme.  Try it with smoked Gouda and dill weed for another nice variation.  Remember; leftovers can be 'born again' as gnocchi, pirogi stuffing or loksha . Enjoy!

Made exactly according to recipe.  These were very heavy, thick and sticky.  We could not taste the parmesan or the garlic.  Will not be making these again.

I really liked this recipe. I did not follow directions but it definitely gave me inspiration. I just boiled some potatoes, added a stick of butter, some milk, garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, salt, pepper, and lots of parmesan came out great and buttery.

Potatoes were a hit on Thanksgiving! I just added skim milk to help with the consistency.

Great Recipe! Made a few changes.  First of all raw garlic didn't appeal to me so i sauteed it first in some butter.  The aroma is heavenly and i did cut down on the amount of parmesan and cream cheese and then added some milk for creaminess.  Skipped the chives and salt and peppered well.  Used a hand mixer and combined well ( a little chunky) and transferred to a greased foil pan to be reheated next day for Thanksgiving dinner.  Garnished with some finely chopped parsley.  Excellent!

These are so heavy and sticky, like Playdoh even...  or, a cheesy potato brick.  The flavor is good, but I felt like I could choke by not fully swallowing, and getting them stuck in my throat. They might make good potato pancakes... I have plenty left over to try!

These are decadent and delicious!  My mods: quartered the recipe, and no chives (didn't have any on-hand). I want to try it again and roast the garlic first, there were little crunches, since I didn't mince finely enough, I also might try with half the cream cheese, as they were pretty thick. Otherwise delicious and dangerous, haha.

These potatoes were tasty but VERY rich! Like many others members I ended up having to add some milk because they were too thick at first. Next time I think I'll try using half the amount of cheese to see if that helps.

I followed the recipe without changing a thing except making them into individual muffins. I had two problems. First, the cake batter was incredibly thick and had to be thinned out a bit. The other issue was the salt. Next time I would use half the salt listed and unsalted butter. I was happy with how the topping turned out and only having to cook them an extra 5 minutes.

Changes? I use sour creme. You may substitute Romano cheese this gives a more robust flavor. For your left overs form into patties and sear. Great for breakfast.

These were ok as suggested. I thought they were a little heavy. I think sour cream might be better than cream cheese. Might change that next time.

3 stars "as is" because it was too dry, as others have noted.  Prefer a more creamy texture, so added milk.  Did not cut back on any ingredients and like the taste.

Since other reviewers commented on the cheesiness, I reduced the parmesan by half, and used sour cream and milk instead. I heated the combined mixture in a saucepan, based on recommendations. While the result was tasty, it was also very rich and so it cannot be eaten in large heapings. Also, I took the butter and garlic, used it to sautee onions, and mixed the drippings into the potatoes, and then served the onions on the side. Overall, it came out pretty well.

With some modifications, this recipe was pretty good.  If your family is fairly conservative and likes tradition, you will want to modify this so it isn't so shocking.  My modifications came about once I first tasted them even after already cutting the parmesan cheese and cream cheese in half.  I would definitely recommend cutting back on both of those cheeses, adding sour cream and whole milk.  Otherwise, these potatoes have too strong of a cheese flavor and are way too thick if milk is not used.  I also added extra butter.

Always like to tweak recipes so..followed the advice of amber writes and added half cup sour cream and grated Parmesan, one stick softened butter, and almost 3/4 pint of heavy cream, all at room temperature so not to make them cold.  Also boiled the potatoes with about 5 cloves of crushed garlic..probably the best mashed potatoes ever

Amazing!! I also halved the parmesan cheese and added 1 cup of sour cream.  I refrigerated over night and reheated with butter and parmesan at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. A new family favorite!

I prefer russet spuds, so used them several times now. Great results. Reduced parmesan to 3/4 cup, subbed in 1 cup sour cream; reduced cream cheese to 1/2 cup; subbed green onions for chives; added chicken bouillon to cooking water; boiled 4 whole large farmer's market garlic cloves with spuds & mashed together; added warm milk/cream when mashing. Now a family favorite :)

Made scaled back to six servings and used ingredients as it listed them for that amount.  They were good but had too much of a Parmesan taste to my liking so maybe changing the amount of ingredients made that difference.  I will make again and use less Parmesan.  My husband liked them and that is saying a lot!

I can't rate this recipe as is because I'm a tweaker and tweaking is what I do best! ;)

Most of the time I go with the recipe as a base and build on it as I go.

Heres what I did:
Boiled about 3 lbs peeled and chopped potatoes in chicken broth with a little salt until tender. 

Mashed with a stick of butter,
A dollop of sour cream,
A tsp or 2 of ranch dressing,
1/2 cup 2% milk,
A few slices of havarti cheese,
About 1/4 cup of grated parm,
Tsp each of garlic and onion powder,
salt and parsley to taste. 

Mashed it all up and mixed added the above till I got my desired taste. It was fantastic and even my 2 year old son who hates mashed potatoes LOVED it!. 

Will Def make again.

Loved  the taste, but as some others have mentioned, these came out needing some sort of thinner (Milk?) because it was too thick. No biggie, as I made Irish Stew and we used the mashed potatoes as as base on the plate and poured the stew on top of the potatoes. And, yes, I followed the recipe exactly.

A nice treat for Thanksgiving dinner! I eye-balled all the ingredients, using dried chives which reconsituted nicely in water, so they're soft and like fresh. I didn't add milk (which I always do for mashed potatoes), but these came out great without it. Did add about 1 Tblsp of sour cream though. Delicious, creamy, gourmet-like mashed potatoes. Happy Thanksgiving, and thanks Christina for the great recipe!

It was very thick.  I agree what others are saying about the consistency.  However, I like that it is easy and you are using the same pot for less fuss.

Flavor was great, next time I will whip them with a mixer. I did add a little more milk. Like another reviewer mine were a little gluey, maybe it's the type of potato (Yukon Gold). I'm not sure what causes that consistency. The garlic also needs to be cooked somehow.

I grew up with my family making homemade mashed potatoes with milk and mayo.  It was always so tasty and everyone always loved them, until they asked my folks, "WHAT do you make these with?  They're amazing!"  When they found out it was mayo...usually people dropped their forks in disgust.  For years I've been trying to figure out a way to make mashed potatoes that good without the mayo, and by golly cream cheese does the trick.  Now I can make fantastic mashed potatoes with this recipe and not disgust my guests!

I thought this was very good. I used cream cheese with chives already in it and russet potatoes because that is what I had. Will definetly make again different then plan old potatoes.

This was one of my favorites so far!  I will never make the other kind of Mashed Potatoes again!!  I just happened to have the ingredients so I made it as is - They were perfect!  I scraped the pan.  If it wasn't such a deep pot.. I might have gone in the closet and licked it clean! (mmmmmmmm)
