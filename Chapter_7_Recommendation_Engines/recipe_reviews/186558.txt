This is a true 5-star winner.  Very different and interesting combination of grits and cheese. All who tried this recipe were quite impressed.  No negatives, which is always a surprise. Made absolutely no modifications. (which I never do)

This was truly delicious!  We ate it with grilled shrimp instead of as an appetizer.  If I did make it as an appy, I would make it in cherry tomatoes.  Be sure to watch it at the end because a couple of my tomatoes split in the oven, and spilled on the pan which doesn't make a pretty presentation ; ).  Delicious!

What a tasty side dish!  Since I used heirloom tomatoes from my garden, I hated to waste the innards, so I mixed some of them back in with the cheese mixture and used the more watery part in the shrimp scampi sauce I cooked as my main dish.  I also used basil from my garden instead of parsley.  Delicious!

Delicious!  I wanted to do something different with grits, and this was perfect.  It takes a while but tastes delicious.  I couldn't get ricotta cheese, so I used cottage cheese and it actually turned out (though it made my tomatoes soggy).  I used it to stuff some jalapenos--that was even better.  I might try mushrooms next time.  A great healthy version of delicious stuffing!

For those that don't use grits a lot, you can find them in the breakfast/cereal section. Our grocery store only offered one option - instant grits - so I cooked them as suggested then followed the recipe from that point and these were still excellent. My filling did puff up a little, so I wouldn't recommend filling the tomatoes to the top. These are a hit in our house!

Wow...So Good! Only thing I changed was to add extra sharp cheddar cheese instead of the Asiago because it is what we had on hand. It was amazing. Thanks for a good one!

Very good flavor.  My only comment is that it was very soft - perhaps less water when cooking the grits.

Really different & delicious! Almost a meal in itself. I did not have ricotta cheese so I substituted with half cream cheese and half sour cream and it turned out great. I will make these with the ricotta next time, based on all the great reviews, I can't wait. Thanks for a terrific recipe!

This is an excellent "starting point" recipe. I found it to be rather bland and the texture was something I wasn't loving too much. Next time I would season it a lot more (experimenting with different herb concoctions) and not as much ricotta. What I do like about this recipe is that it is so easy to adjust to your taste while not deviating too far from the original.

These have become a staple side dish in our house. Sometimes I use leftover bacon crumbles, or blue cheese crumbles. They are good "what ever you have on hand works" kinda side dish. They will make your ordinary meal look and taste gourmet!

This dish was raved about at our traditional Thanksgiving family breakfast last year and is already being inquired about this year.  It was such an elegant and delicious addition to our feast.

Loved this recipe! Its different from what I normally cook grits as, which made the change very pleasing. Also, I always try to find the healthier recipes and this one definitely fits the bullet.

Will definitely make again; delicious. Be careful not to overstuff the tomatoes because the mix will spill over.

I made a half batch of the filling (no changes in ingredients or proportions) and filled 25 1.5" - 2" Campari tomatoes. Actually I over-filled them and lost some cheese grits that slid off as they baked. I could have easily filled 5-6 more tomatoes. The grits were salty and garlicky - a nice counterpoint to the sweet-tart tomatoes. These were a hit at a New Year's brunch.

A great alternative to my usual stuffed peppers.  Different and wonderful taste.  Would cut garlic and salt both in half, since they dominate the flavor.  Wonderful!

The filling is delicious! Next time I'll use a bigger tomato. I used "Roma" tomatoes and they were a bit too small.  Served alongside some marinated grilled chicken!
