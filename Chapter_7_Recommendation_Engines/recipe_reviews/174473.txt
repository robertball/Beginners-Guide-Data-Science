This was very tasty!  I used chicken stock instead of water and bullion (sp?).  I also heated the stock and wine per other risotto recipes i've made in the past.

I turned this into a main course by adding shittake mushrooms, shrimp, asparagus and topped with walnuts.  It was easy to make and was enjoyed by all.

We made the recipe as stated, with the exception of using dried thyme instead of fresh.  It was delicious, though we might cut back the chicken bouillon next time.  It tasted more like chicken than pumpkin.

I adore this recipe. I am pretty much addicted to all things pumpkin! This had a good flavor and not overwhelmingly pumpkiny. I made a couple of small changes... I omitted the wine and added a splash of vinegar + water. I used more than 1 cup of pumpkin because I had a large already opened can and didn't want to waste. I used dry thyme. And I added a lot of mushrooms.

Made as written.  Excellent side dish.  Didn't taste too much pumpkin but definitely a different taste than plain risotto.  Was a perfect side dish to pork roast.

This is even better if you can make it with a richer stock (duck is good; use inexpensive duck legs to make a broth). The finished dish is excellent with oven roasted salmon fillets. A tasty meal for a cold, fall evening when you want to serve something special.

This was good.  I changed a few of the ingredients to save money (took out the onions, used more garlic instead; used Italian Seasoning rather than thyme or sage) and used chicken stock rather than the cubes like a previous review had suggested.  It was really good, but I ate it by itself and it probably would have been better along with something else, like chicken.

This was lovely comfort food on a cold evening. I added mushrooms as per a fewother reviews, and also tried some of the mixture with canned tuna stirred in as a complete meal option.

I would eat this every day if I could! I made a smaller batch before Thanksgiving to try it out, and loved it so much I made a double batch on Thanksgiving so I'd have plenty of leftovers! I made it with the mushrooms and served it inside roasted acorn squash halves, and it was a huge hit!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  It is however, time-consuming as risotto is - but well worth it for the excellent taste and texture.  I used a bit more white wine than the recipe called for, and it had a nice finish to it.  I will make this again; the parmesan cheese makes a wonderful topping.

This was okay.  I also thought the pumpkin flavor was rather mild.  Maybe that's the point?  I had a sugar pumpkin I needed to use and it served it's purpose well.  Not sure what the difference would be using canned versus a roasted pumpkin?  It was a great color though and tasted just fine, but nothing amazing.   I also added a bit of chopped mushrooms.  I'll try again next fall.

Excellent recipe!!  I've made this a few times now and love it every time.  I normally roast a sugar pumpkin rather than using canned and toss all of it in so probably have a good 3-4 times the amount of pumpkin called for.  I like the chunky texture of mixing in fresh pumpkin rather than the pureed canned kind.  Also substituting hard cider for the white wine is very tasty!

This was a tasty generic risotto.  This subtlety of the pumpkin was overpowered by the other components of the dish.  I tried to bring out the pumpkin by skipping the bouillon, but the flavor was still lost amongst the onions, garlic, and parmesan.  Still tasty though!

This was delicious. The only thing I did differently was heat the liquids over low heat. I didn't need the last 1/2 cup or so of liquid. Also, I only had dried thyme, so that's what I used. We really enjoyed this, and it let me use up half a can of pumpkin that I had sitting in my pantry. Now, I just need to use up the other half!

A good way to use up Thanksgiving pumpkin (and turkey broth, if you had any!).  This rice dish was tasty; couldn't really taste pumpkin but the colour was nice and consistency was good too.  Like the other reviewers, I used chicken stock, and I did serve with cooked chicken.
