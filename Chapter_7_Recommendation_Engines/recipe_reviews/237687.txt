I would recommend ditching the salt. The soy sauce is plenty.

This was really flavorful! I iced canned chicken because I'm pregnant, but it turned out great.

What an odd combination for tuna salad but so delicious.  I accidentally left the soy sauce out on first batch and figured out I liked it better that way and I am not a fan of ginger so I never include that in my recipes.  I used 2 small cans of tuna with the same measurements the recipe calls for.

Wow! Yum! I had some leftover Ahi Tuna. I didn't have pepper paste, so I used a couple of teaspoons of Sriracha in its place.  Delish! I will make this again and again.

Very good. A little spicy, so I'll adjust that next time. I put it on lettuce wraps to serve.

11.30.19  This one’s certainly “outside the box” for tuna salad, but man, does it work.  Liked everything about this.  Not so sure I’d like it on a tuna salad sandwich, but it was delicious served as an appetizer on Trader Joe’s Rosemary Fig crackers.  And I certainly could see a scoop on fresh salad greens for lunch. This will be frequently making its way onto my summer menu when we have a lot of salad plates for dinner.   If you have time, put it in the fridge for a couple hours, as I think the flavor even improves.  This has been on the site for a while, and I’m so glad I finally found it. In a word, this is “tantalizing!”

This is the bomb! I didn't use as much  chili paste as my stomach can't hang with too much heat, but left everything else the same.  Think these would be great for a party in small portion size sandwiches. My husband says this is a keeper!

Great for broke college students!  I hate the fishy taste of regular tuna salad, and this is creative, completely different flavor.  It's seasoned thoroughly enough that your friends won't complain about the smell when you eat it in front of them.

It's become one of my staple recipes.

This was very very good!  This is a fresh way to make tuna salad plus I love Asian food. I followed the directions as was written and I ate mine on an English muffin with lettuce and toasted. My husband ate his on toasted white bread with lettuce. He loved it also. The only thing I would do different next time is add lemon zest and lemon juice. I think that would add a nice fresh flavor to it. I have a lot left over so I may go ahead and add the lemon zest and juice to it now.
