I thought this recipe was great!  Had to double it for 15 people.  Did use fresh sweet potatoes, approx 4 lbs for that may people, peeled and boiled for ~ 15 minutes till tender, smashed with a fork and followed rest of recipe.  Did substitute brown sugar for white.  Turned out delicious!  Next time will dot with some butter and a tad brown sugar and pecans over top for more of a crust while baking.

Everyone loved the flavor of this dish, the only change I made was I used fresh sweet potatoes instead of canned.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Good way to use up leftover eggnog. I, too, used fresh potatoes and cut back a little on the sugar to 2/3 cup.

I used jarred Valencia Orange Peel and I think that was a mistake. Since it was not freshly grated orange zest, I probably should have used less. The amount I used caused a bitter taste that overpowered the eggnog. Since sweet potato and eggnog are two of my favorite foots, that was a disappointment. In all fairness, it was my fault for making the substitution; so, I'm not taking any points away from the recipe. I will try again with fresh orange zest. I just wanted to share my experience so others wouldn't make the same mistake. Happy cooking!

We're not big on "sweet" sweet potato casseroles, so the only change I made was to reduce the sugar.  This is so easy to make, and the orange zest gives you a nice pop of freshness, really enhancing the flavor of the sweet potatoes.  Unfortunately, I thought the eggnog flavor was lost.  I cut this recipe in half using one can of sweet potatoes, and two of us finished it off (and we didn't pig out, either).   In this house, I think the full recipe would serve 6, not 8, so the number of servings might be one thing that you consider.  Good weeknight side dish served with a pork roast.  Certainly would make again.

I varied from great-grandma's recipe a couple years ago and used this one. Everyone loved it! I did use fresh sweet potatoes and skipped the sugar since eggnog is so sweet already.

Just delicious, and so easy using the canned sweet potatoes.  Certainly one I'll make again.

To sweet, although I loved the subtle flavor of the eggnog.  I would cut the sugar in half and use brown sugar instead.
