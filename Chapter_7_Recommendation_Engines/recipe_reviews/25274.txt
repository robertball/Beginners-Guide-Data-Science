This is so easy to make and it's delicious! I only changed a couple of things. I used the whole 18 oz jar of plum jam, omitted the pepper, used garlic powder, and added a couple of tablespoons of soy sauce. Served as an additional dipping sauce with Baked Teriyaki Chicken from this site.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This plum sauce is perfect for crab rangoons.  I couldn't find plum jam so I used canned plums in syrup.  I removed the pits and peels and blended them before adding them to the pot.  I added extra sugar and it turned out well.  It was a little too spicy for me so next time I would add half the amount of pepper.

This is exactly the recipe I've been searching for.  I had this sauce with chicken once in a restaurant and have been looking for a similar recipe ever since!  Thanks Rayna!

This was really simple to make and I had everything on hand. I doubled this and got 2 pints of sauce. This is sweet and spicy. We ate some with chicken and liked it very much. This is just like you get at the asian take out restaurants. I didn't use jam though, I was making homemade red plum jam and used 2 cups of the red plum puree and 3 1/3 c sugar then boiled it for 5 minutes, so there wasn't any certo or sure jell in it like the jam would hve had. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Good, but you can't make this ahead very easily.  Once it cools down, it thickens up like jam.  You must re-heat and serve warm.

Came out absolutely delicious as is. I've used this on everything from baked potatoes to fried fish to chicken to pork to steak! It's delicious. It's sweet, spicy, and mmmmmm so good.

When I worked as a waiter at a restaurant a few years back, my favorite dish was this pork with plum sauce. It was delicious and one of the most popular dishes at the restaurant. This sauce is very similar to that one. One thing I've modified however, is I first saute the garlic and onion in 1 tblsp of EVOO. I realized the recipe doesn't even call for oil, but I reflexively did it and it was a-ok. 

I actually prefer it that way because I first saute the garlic and onion, get all those yummy juice sizzling and then mix in the ham, vinegar, brown sugar, ginger, and red pepper. Oh and I also used rice vinegar instead because I wanted a more oriental cuisine taste from my sauce. 

Love it!

This sauce went fantastically with the mini sweet potato samosas on here.  I added a lot more red pepper flakes (probably about 2 Tbsp. - we like our food fiery!), and a little more vinegar.  Great flavours, and so easy to prepare... took me no more than 4 minutes to get it all heated up and ready.

I used plum butter instead of plum jam and it was great!  If you do use the plum butter add water to loosen it up.  This was great served as a shrimp dip. I can't wait to try this with pork or chicken.

This is a great sauce for crab rangoons. I've made it twice. Someone commented that the sauce thickens up like jam when it cools, so you have to warm it up again. I encountered this too, so I added some pineapple juice to thin it out. I also used fresh, minced ginger and left out the minced onion.

This was really good with vegetable spring rolls. It does get thick as it cools, but can be loosened again by heating (personally, I kind of liked the thickness of it - many dipping sauces are rather thin). I used rice vinegar and cheap-ish store-bought plum jelly. The color is really cool, too (for those freaks that care about these things, ha). Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a quick recipe I could make with what I had on hand.  This worked perfectly and tasted excellent.  I didn't have plum jam so I used a jar of multi berry preserve (cherry, blueberry and grape) and it still was very good.  Probably even better with the plum jam.  I gave it 5 stars for overall ease of making it, simple ingredients and taste.

I made this for my spring rolls. I used a sugar free raspberry jam and 1 fresh, chopped, plum. The plum really relased juice as it boiled. I liked it a little chunky. This came out great. I used chinese hot sauce instead of the flakes.

I have used this recipe several times to make chicken with plum sauce....one of the best I've tasted and so easy.  Feels like cheating!  I do have a hard time finding plum jelly, though.  Just found a 20 oz jar in our local family farm market.  Big Lots used to carry plum jelly and I scarfed up the last 6 they had the last time I saw it there.  Back to the farm market for more.....

Five stars all the way, soooo easy, and had just the right amount of heat for us.  This was the perfect sauce for Pot Stickers Traditional from the AR site.  ****UPDATE 4.3.18****  Enjoyed this today made with fig vinegar and drizzled over grilled pineapple slices.

THIS is really good, but it's missing some "salty" to balance the sweet and tart - a small amount of salt or Soy Sauce will smooth the sweet edge.

Have made this several times and it is delicious.  I cut the sugar in half, used fresh grated ginger and finely chopped onion instead of the dried.  Served with baked egg rolls for our Chinese New Year meal.  This is also very good as a glaze for pork chops. Thanks for posting, Rayna.

First batch I made a 1/2 recipe. I did make a couple changes in that I used fresh minced onion instead of dried. I thought it was a bit too thick for me, so I added 2 Tbsp Pineapple Juice, which another reviewer had suggested, and this stuff was perfect. Just finished making a quadruple recipe and stored back into the jam jars. For this I did use 3 tsp of crushed red pepper instead of 4 and only put in 6 Tbsp Pineapple juice instead of 8 but otherwise 4 times all the other ingredients. It went great with homemade egg rolls and also for dipping chicken nuggets. Make sure you use JAM instead of jelly and it shouldn't solidify back on you, plus the pineapple juice helps reduce this also.

For everyone who needs an elegant dish you can make a day ahead of time;  you can do it using this plum sauce!
 Rinse your pork loin; I used a half of a large one which was about 3 lbs which I rinsed and patted dry.  I rubbed it with 1/2 Tablespoon cinnamon and 1/2 Tablespoon Allspice (trust me on this do it).  Place loin in crock pot.  Stir in 1/2 cup water and about 1/3 cup of chopped fresh or dried plums (I used dried which were good quality and very moist) to the FINISHED plum sauce.  After you pour over the loan, don't stir. The only other change I made was instead of dried onion I used about 1/4 cup of chopped white onion.

Cook on High or low maybe 6 hours on high.  At the end of cooking, add about a two teaspons of low sodium soy sauce.  Don't over cook pork loin as you don't want it falling apart.  You can eat now but it is so much better overnight.  Slice pork loin.  Submerse it in the sauce and let marinate overnight in frig.   

Easy to reheat and it is delicious.  Going to do this for the next company I have.  Serve with plain white rice (the sauce is so good over it) and either asparagus or snow peas and it is a full meal.

 My husband is from Texas and he his favorite meal is a Texas Chicken Fried Steak and he thought it was fabulous.  This will please anyone who likes pork loin including children.  It has a very nice balance of sweet and spicy.

Oh, I did have on hand my home made plum jelly, but I'm sure any plum will do.

I really enjoy this simple recipe. Locating the plum jam was not so bad check with your local market ie Fairway or Traders Joe. My family really enjoyed this sauce. I did add a little water because I didn't want it to thick. Thank you!

This turned out good but just a little too thick. I used balsamic vinegar, and added a bit more to cut the sweetness. Next time I will used half as much brown sugar.

an excellent compliment to the crab wontons i had made. i found the sauce had a more pleasant texture if it was kept consistantly warm.

I thought this recipe was amazing.  I used it in a Jamaican Asian fusion stir fry.  I could not find plum jam at my grocery store so I used apricot preserves instead.

This recipe is excellent!  I used cider vinegar, fresh onion and garlic. Served with mini spring rolls. This is a keeper.

so I had this case of plums and needed dipping sauce so I took my hand blender to the can, added some sugar and reduced it a bit and added everything except I uses balsamic vinegar.  It was a bit hit and will make it again being that now I have 23 cans of plums left.

My rating is based on tasting soon after making the sauce.  The real test will be in the future when we use the sauce for its intended purpose.  By the way I made double the quantity (abundant crop this year!)but reduced the vinegar.  Next time I will reduced it even further to 150ml and increase the sugar to 150gm - for a double batch.  The sauce is still a little tart for my taste.  I also added garlic and a tablespoon of Sambal (chilli paste).

I have tries this recipe and found it to be wonderful just the way it is. I did find it better to keep it slightly warm. I suggest warming it a bit before serving. Thank you for posting.

This sauce is delicious. I put it on top of baked pork chops and my friends were crazy about it. They even asked me to give them some to take home. Thanks Rayna!

This sauce is awesome. I couldn't find plain plumb jam so I substituted cherry plum sauce and served it with Cajun crab Rangoon. I will definitely make it again

I use fresh ginger,1 tablespoon, then I add fresh orange juice,1/2 cup, instead of the vinager I use fresh lemon juice in about the amount called for. I use the brown sugar,onions and garlic.
the orange and lemon give it a very savory taste
