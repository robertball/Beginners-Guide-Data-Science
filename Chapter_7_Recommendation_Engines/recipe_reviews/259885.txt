These are a LOT of work but very tasty in the end. I may be wonton wrapper challenged but I couldn't get 1 1/2 teaspoons of filling in the wrapper without them tearing. With that being said I put a lot less filling in each one meaning I ended up needing a lot more wrappers. The leftovers are great straight out of the refrigerator cold too. These are really good but be sure to plan ahead. I move fast in the kitchen and you're going to need more than 45 minutes for prep. The cook time is off on this recipe too. There is no way you can cook 6-8 potstickers at a time for 5 minutes let them steam for a minute and be done with all 60 of them in 8 minutes. It's 8 minutes a batch so plan on an hour.
