Can't give it 5 stars, because I made a lot of changes.  But I use most recipes as a base, anyway.  Used 2 chicken breasts, simmered in olive oil with crushed garlic and italian seasoning until done.  Put the chicken in a blender on 'salsa' to chop it up (much easier than tearing with forks!).  Added the oil (which was about 1/8 cup), 1/2 c bread crumbs, 15oz ricotta, 1/2 c mozz, 1/4 c parmesean and mixed together.  Used 1/2 box of shells, boiled and stuffed, then refridgerated for the next day.  I get home much later than my boyfriend, so it was convenient to just pour jarred alfredo and some mozz, throw it in the oven for 30 mins.

I really enjoyed this!  I made a few changes as I was using up leftovers.  I already had 2 cooked chicken breasts that I cubed, and I left out the onion.  (The chicken was already herbed so I didn't use basil or oregano.)  I mixed the egg with 8 oz ricotta cheese and maybe 4 oz of parmesan, and added some dried parsley (to make it more like lasagna cheese, which I adore).  Then I added about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs.  I tossed the chicken and egg/cheese mixture in a skillet and heated it to melt the cheeses, adding in a few handfuls of mozzarella as well.  It looked a little dry (especially with the bread crumbs) so I tossed in three tablespoons or so of sour cream.  For the tomato sauce I used a 28-oz bottle of spaghetti sauce and added a can of diced tomatoes as well.  When I put everything in the pan I first poured in a layer of tomato sauce so that the shells wouldn't stick to the pan.  It turned out beautifully, and the stuffing is creamy and delicious.  Thank you!

I made this recipe for 10 people on Mothers Day and everyone liked it. We all thought the variance of chicken in a mostly italian dish was good. The shells were easy to stuff as the stuffing mixture sticks together very easily. The only thing I changed the second time I made it was taking out the cheddar cheese and doubling the mozzarella and using a jarred spaghetti sauce instead of the plain tomato sauce. Very good!!

Although next time I will use a thicker sauce than tomato, it was easy to make and my family loved it.

I used this recipe as a base and made some modifications.  It turned out very well.  I sauted the onion and chicken with garlic in olive oil. when the chicken was about done I added the spices and then shredded the ckicken.  I also took one beaten egg, 1/2 cup of cottage cheese (all out of ricotta) and 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese and mixed that with the chicken mixture.  Stuffed the shells and topped it with tomato-cream sauce for pasta from this site.  Will make again.

Delicious! Used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and added 15 oz lite ricotta with the chicken and mozarella. Excluded the cheddar and doubled the mozarella. This one is added to the recipe box!

I liked this recipe but cooking the chicken as the recipe described was messy.  Next time I'll cook the chicken first and then throw it in the skillet with bread crumbs, etc.  I also used manicotti tubes and pasta sauce instead (what I had on hand) and that worked well.

WONDERFUL!! Used spaghetti sauce instead of the tomatoe sauce, and added extra mozzerella. No problems with my non-stick frying pan. Definitely worth the work--Loved it!

Excellent, tasted like chicken parm in shells. Was hesitant at first b/c of adding bread crumbs to the pan, but was extremely pleased with the results :)

Very good! Today is my hubby's Bday. I asked him what he wanted for his "special" dinner and his request was chicken parmesan. Unfortunately, I couldn't locate my go-to recipe (argh!). I stumbled across this one, saw a similarity b/t the 2 and decided to give it a go. While my husband & I both liked this, he wasn't crazy about the texture (he is SO hard to please sometimes lol!). Despite his comment, he went back for 2nd's.... As usual, I made a few changes, some b/c I thought I could make improvements and some to clear out my fridge. I cut my chicken into bite-sze. pieces adn THEN sauteed (w/ onions) in a bit of EVOO. When my chicken was nearly cooked thru and my onions were softened, I added my breadcrumbs / egg (I dropped my egg on top so it wouldn't cook!). Shortly after, I added my cheese (Italian blend). My only other change was to use a jar of pasta sauce mix. w/ 1/2 a (leftover) jar of alfredo sauce instead of plain 'ol tomato sauce. I spread a bit of sauce in my baking dish and then proceeded as directed. There are 2 things to note: a) THIS MAKES A TON! & b) watch the clock - this takes a LONG time to prepare. Although this took what seemed like FOREVER to prepare, I do think it was worth the effort (especially since this was my hubby's Bday dinner). Served w/ homemade garlic bread, this was an AWESOME meal. Thanks ECHO2003! :)

I thought the sauce was a little bland. I will make again with my own sauce and will shred the chicken before I stuff the shells.

this was pretty good. it was fairly easy to make too, even stuffing the shells was simple. i made the stuffing the night before because i work late. the only thing i wasn't too fond of was the breadcrumbs. it's a little too mushy for me. next time i will substitute stuffing instead. other than that it was delicious and for sure a recipe for the books.

This was SOOO yummy. I used shredded chicken I had left over. Seasoned it with garlic, oregano, etc. Added a spoonful of cream cheese (sour cream would work too) mixed it all together and filled the shells. Definitely use the biggest shells, I had the medium size and it took forever to fill them all :) Used spaghetti sauce on top. Perfect!

Very good and easy. Kids liked it too! I use the pre-cooked, diced chicken tenderloins. You may find them in the frozen section.  Much faster this way!  I also used a pasta sauce rather than just tomatoe sauce and only 2/3 box of shells.

I used this as a base recipe: I used only about 1/2 the box of shells (I made 21) and almost 2 jars of sauce. I left out the basil, oregano, onion and bread crumbs and salt & pepper. I used 1 1/2 cup mozerella cheese, 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and 4 oz low fat cream cheese. And I used one can of pre-cooked chicken mixed with a chicken bouillon cube dissolved in 1/4 cup hot water. Turned out great!

These were enjoyed. As others have warned they do take quite a bit of time, although they were easy. I too, think a little more sauce is needed not to keep the shells from drying out, mine were fine, but the shells do soak up some liquid when baking and a little extra is required for when they are served. Using all the shells made more than I could fit in a 9 x 13" baking dish so I prepared them and froze the rest. It should feed 2 for another meal which is always nice. Thanks.

This recipe is so yummy! Tastes like chicken parm stuffed shells.
I think the keys are *chop chicken really small, almost a mince and *get yummy creamy mozz, not the salty hard rubbery stuff! Will be put in rotation!

I added a small container of ricotta because I love ricotta. Five stars with or without ricotta! Easy, delicious! My photo is before sauce & baking.

This was fabulous! I put in about 8oz of ricotta cheese and used alfredo sauce since that's what was in the house but everyone raved over it. Will definitely become a new family favorite!

Thanks to the great reviewer suggestions from MARGARETINDC  and Lisa_K this turned out pretty tasty.  This recipe benefits a lot by adding fresh minced garlic, more herbs, and using spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato sauce.  I also used all mozzarella instead of a blend with cheddar cheese and sprinkled the tops with parsley and oregano.

Great.  I followed this recipe nearly exact, except used mozzarella, no cheddar.  For the sauce, I used this site's Best Marinara Sauce yet.

This is incredibly delicious. A few changes that I made: I cooked the onion (and added a few cloves of minced garlic) in oil in a saute pan for a couple minutes, added the chicken, which I had chopped very small, and allowed those ingredients to cook through. I then mixed together the egg and the bread crumbs, and added the cheese. I only used 1/2 a box of shells, and it was the perfect amount. Also, I used one can of Bertolli Tomato and Basil sauce along with one can of Del Monte chopped tomatoes (with basil and oregano), as opposed to the 29 oz. can of tomato sauce. This is definitely a keeper.

This was Awesome! My Hubby and fam really enjoyed them. Although I did add a few things. I added a jar of minced garlic, a can of Italian tomatoes, and a can of rotel. I also added marinara sauce in the chicken mixture. It turned out great will def do this over. Thanks!

I absolutely loved this! It was a nice change from beef manicotti shells. The only thing I changed was I added some ricotta cheese into the stuffing. Next time I make it I'll probably grill the chicken a bit before adding the bread crumbs. Thanks for the recipe!

So I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I was lazy and didn't want to deal with cutting up chicken so I went to the store to look for ground chicken but picked up ground turkey instead. Other than that i followed the recipe exactly.  It was yummy!!!! And all four of us cleaned our plates at the dinner table.  :0)

These were great. Made these for dinner over the weekend. I made some modifications. I like other reviewers cooked the chicken in some EVOO and garlic, then added everything else in. I shredded the chicken and mixed with ricotta cheese and mozz/parm cheese... then stuffed the shells. Topped with homemade sauce... great.

I really liked this recipe. The only thing that i had trouble with was the part of the directions that have you cooking the chicken with the bread crumb and egg mixture. When i did this the bread crumbs and egg got really brown and started sticking to the skillet. So i recommend cutting your chicken breasts up into 1 inch squares first. Then cook your chicken till its about done... add the mixture (crumbs and eggs) with a little (a teaspoon) of oil and cooking till the chicken and egg is completely done. I chopped the chicken up with the end of my spatula once it was done so it would go into the shells better.  Other than that... recipe was awesome! tastes like breaded Chicken Parmesan, stuffed in big shells :) Enjoy!

The shells and filling were a little messy, but oh so tasty! I added little strips of prosciutto on the inside of the shells, and I believe it added a lot to the flavor. Next time I'll also go ahead and make my own sauce, instead of using the premade stuff.

I love this dish! Can be quite healthy if you use light cheese and no egg and still tastes so good. I also find it economical since 2 chicken breasts makes me about 20 shells and 3-4 is a good one person serving. Leftovers just as good. I love making this dish!

This was very tasty! I think it would so much better with ground beef instead of chicken. Next time I make this I will make it with ground beef instead. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

This was a delicious meal! I would recommend using your favorite pasta sauce rather than tomato sauce. You could also use a bit more than it recommends to ensure it is nice and moist. I added half a container of ricotta as well, could have probably used the whole thing. I also shredded my chicken, which made it great for stuffing with! Definitely give this one a try. But the fantastic thing about Italian food is that you can change things a little here and there and the recipe will still come out wonderful. So don't be afraid to experiment and "personalize" this recipe. I think it just makes it more fun!

I love this recipe as a starting point. I did make a few changes.  I used ground turkey instead of chicken. I also added spinach and garlic to the mixture. I used a homemade spaghetti sauce to top the shells in the oven and prevent them from getting tough. Overall great recipe, THANX!!!

I felt this recipe was very average.  I even added extra parmesian cheese and sauted some celery in with the mixture.  My family didn't complain, but it didn't get any compliments either.

I didn't care much for this one- I didn't like the bread crumbs in it whatsoever...so perhaps if you left that out it'd be good.  I also thought the shells got hard because they were in the oven for so long.  I took them out early to avoid them getting any harder.  Probably won't make this again..

Honestly, I can only rate this as 4 stars b/c I took this recipe and another one listed and combined the 2.  I used "stuffing" instead of the bread crumbs and egg and added some cream soup mixtures to my "sauce"....I also used pre-made Spaghetti sauce and only served it on the BOTTOM of the plate for presentation.  VERY PRETTY!  I mostly used the OTHER recipe like this, but wanted to "rate" this one as it gave me some really good ideas too.  Was looking for something DIFFERENT to do with the larger pasta shells and this recipe helped me with that!  Sometime might really make it legit and see what happens, but after my concauction of my 1st recipe, it will be hard to "top" with my family!  Thanks a bunch for submitting this recipe!!  GREAT!!

We loved this recipe, one of my favorites and fairly low-carb. I made a few substitutions to suit our personal tastes and thought it couldn't have been better. I added 1/4 cup red onion, 1/3 cup chopped sundried tomatoes, 1/4 cup fresh basil, 1/3 cup chopped artichoke hearts. Parmesan cheese in addition to the others and I used Monterey Jack instead of Mozzerella. I also chopped everything up together in a food processor before stuffing into shells. I thought the cubes of chicken would be too much and this blended all the flavors together perfectly. I sprinkled more cheese on top before baking. 

I made the recipe for a basil cream sauce which I poured on top of the shells before serving. I didn't have cream on hand so I used sour cream and it will still delicious.

This was incredible!My husband said this was his favorite. I did make a few changes based on other's opinions. Hopefully this will be of some help: I used 8 chicken tenders, boiled and seasoned with garlic salt and italian seasoning. Chopped these in the mini-food processor. Sauteed minced onion and garlic in olive oil and added 3/4C of italian bread crumbs with salt and italian seasoning. Mixed beaten egg, 15oz ricotta cheese,1/2C mozz and 1/4C grated parmesan,stuffing mixture and chopped chicken. Stuff shells,pour 1C spaghetti sauce on bottom of dish,then place shells in dish,next top with more sauce(32oz total)then top with mozz and grated parmesan. They melted in your mouth! Beware, this dish takes about 2hrs to prepare start to finish, but it's well worth it. Thanks Echo!

This is a great basic recipe but I took several ideas from previous reviews.  I cooked two chicken breasts and ground them in the food processor. I mixed the chicken with 1 cup ricotta,Italian bread crumbs,two eggs,chopped onion and the cheeses. I didn't heat this mixture(it packed easily into the shells). I also used jar spaghetti sauce and topped it with the remaining cheese. Perfect!

Very good but felt something was missing.  Next time I make these I'll probably add a small container of ricotta cheese to the mixture to give it some moisture as it was a bit on the dry side.  I used a 26 ounce jar of sauce and will probably use 2 jars next time.   1 jar was not enough.

This recipe is great. My family loves it. But I do recommend using Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and reducing the amount to 3/4c. I also like to add garlic powder to my chicken. Very yummy.

Soooo good.  My boyfriend loved them.  I cooked the chicken in olive oil, chopped it up in a food processor and then mixed with the bread crumbs and egg. I omitted the onion and used 2 cans of tomato sauce and 1/2 jar of pasta sauce. Cant wait to make them again!

What a great recipe! My husband and I loved it. My husband is a VERY PICKY eater and he said it looked and smelled delicious.  He also said it taste EXCELLENT and taste like something you would find at a restaurant. He thinks he wants it at least once a week! I found it very easy to make and used italian bread crumbs and Ragu tomatoe, basil & cheese spagatti sauce instead. Turned out wonderful! Thanks!

This was a pretty good recipe. I use 3 large chicken breasts and it was way more left over so I froze it. I added more seasoning and tweaked the recipe a little. I added spinach. It was great. very time consuming but since I have the filling frozen in the freezer it will be easier and faster the next time.

Great recipe if you use spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomato sauce. And no ricotta cheese! Yay!

I didn't care for the method used to cook the chicken. I liked the taste of the final product although I did modify the ingredients. I sautéed the chicken with butter and garlic and seasoned with Chinese five spice. Just a pinch of the five spice though because of the strong flavor that it produces. I added 10 ounces of ricotta cheese to the finished chicken dish and only placed shredded cheese on top of the filling after the shells were filled. I used a pasta sauce that was already seasoned because the plain tomato sauce leaves a tart and sour flavor with no additional seasonings added. Turned out great with some modifications.

It was okay but bland.  I put in all the normal seasonings 4S, seas. pepper, Northwoods, etc. but it was too bland.  If I ever make again I would add a lot more garlic and onion salt.  I also put in Garlic and Herb spag. sauce instead of tomato sauce, but still dull.
No the second time
Fair to poor the third time!!!!!

My husband really loved this one. The kids and I thought it was just OK, but maybe that was because I used jarred sauce instead of my own, which is what we are used to.

We use this recipe all the time!  Our family doesn't like a lot of onion so I leave them out.  And I use seasoned breadcrumbs and omit the spices.  I also don't bother melting the cheese in the pan before stuffing the shells.  Everything gets melted when it bakes anyway.  Even my 7 year old asks for seconds!

This was a good dish! Made them for a pot-luck style dinner. marinated the chicken first in an Italian dressing, then tossed with the breadcrumbs. Had used "Best marinara sauce" recipe instead of jarred sauce. Made a lot and had few trays for dinner, watched as many had 2-3 on their plate each trip!!  Was a hit!

I thought this looked boring as is so I changed it up. I boiled chicken and shredded it. I mixed it with spinach, rictta cheese, parm cheese, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and nutmeg. I then added one beaten egg and mixed everything together and stuffed manicotti shells with the mixture and put homemade marinara sauce and topped with mozzarella and parm cheeses. I baked until nice and crusty and got rave reviews. I saved 2 shells with mixture and froze to save for next time to make with alfred sauce instead of the red sauce. Thanks for the recipe...you can be very creative with this.

HEAVENLY!!  Though we made a few changes, in lieu of one of the chicken breasts, we used 1/2 lb italian sausage--YUM.  Also, instead of the red sauce, we covered these with the green onion-parmesan mornay sauce from this site which was so very rich and cheesy!  Had some shells left over and those we put red sauce and cheese on.  Two totally different flavors, but both very good!  Excellent recipe that we will use for guests in the future!  Thanks!

Good recipe, but I a few of alterations. I cut out the egg and used some olive oil instead. I cooked the onion and the chicken, along with a couple garlic cloves in a skillet. When the chicken was nearly fully cooked I added the basil, oregano, salt and pepper and sauted for a bit longer. I them removed that from the pan into a bowl and added the cheese. I didn't like the idea of putting cheese into a hot skillet (seems like too much of a mess to me). The cheese melted perfectly and I mixed that, along with some fresh Parmesan. Filled the shells, and put them into a pan and used nearly 3x the sauce, added the cheese and I baked for 25 covered and 10 uncovered. I'm not sure how it would of turned out without these changes, but my boyfriend raved about this and demands it on at least a bi-weekly basis.

Very tasty dish! I used Italian Seasoned bread crumbs and instead of tomato sauce, I used a jar of Alfredo sauce, and WOW did this disappear from the dinner table fast!  Cooking the chicken, onion, egg, and bread crumbs together in the skillet was a little bit awkward at first.  Make sure you use a BIG skillet.  And I let the chicken cook a bit before adding the other ingredients, just so the bread crumbs wouldn't burn.  Great variation on stuffed pasta shells...  Thanks!

The recipe was simple to follow and the taste was alright. My Hb and son really liked it, but I thought it could use more taste. I will make these again, although I will use a heartier sauce rather than plain tomato sauce.

This recipe was delicious!  I made a few changes, however, and it helped a lot.  I first marinated the chicken in an Italian Pesto dressing, then cooked the chicken until it was almost done (to keep the meat from tasting dry).  I then added some ricotta cheese and the Italian dressing to the mixture since many people complained of the stuffing being too dry.  I also didn't bake it as long as it called for, but I'm not sure that matters.  Please try this recipe, you'll be glad you did!  It was a hit in my kitchen!

Just as good as when I make these with ground beef!  Probably healthier too.  I made these up in the morning, then refrigerated to pop in the oven later that night.  I will be making these again.

These were wonderful. I used large manicotti pasta instead of shells and it worked really well. I also used italian bread crumbs instead of adding the separate herbs and once the meat was cooked I used a food processor to make it easier to stuff.

Very good.  I cooked the shells for 5 min. to make them easier to handle while stuffing and used low fat cheddar and low sodium sauce.  My shells must've absorbed some of the sauce so next time I will add more as they were a tad dry.  My picky husband enjoyed them!

These were really good.  I found with the amount of sauce you have to use they're a little too salty...will try mixing a low sodium sauce with regular the next time.

I liked using the chicken.  I blended it in my Ninja and added some rocatta cheese.  That made it easier to stuff into the shells.

I already had cooked chicken, so I cubed it up,  threw in 2 cloves of garlic and onion using the shredding and pulsing button on my food processer. Since I didn't have cheddar cheese I used about a half of cup of parmesan cheese I did put in a kettle for a bit to heat the egg up, then stuffed the shells, layered pepperoni over them then cheese. baked until finished... was so yummy! :D

My absolute favorite recipe!    I was a little unsure about the egg until everything was done, but well worth it. I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of adding the  oregano and basil and added the bread crumbs and egg after the chicken was cooked.   If you like chicken cheese and pasta you will love this!!

I used ground chicken and added 2 minced cloves of garlic.  Cooking everything together made the filling a little mushy.  I should have cubed the chicken like the recipe like the recipe calls for, but I thought the chicken cubes would be a little bland.  I would recommend adding the bread crumbs slowly to just coat the chicken lightly - they added to the mushy filling.  Overall, this recipe is a nice change from the usual ricotta & spinach stuffing or ground turkey.

Stuffing was too dry & needed more seasoning  so I added almost a full container of Ricotta cheese, approx. 1/2 cup sour cream, some other Italian seasonings, & next time would add some diced tomatoes instead of just tomato sauce. I didn't have regular mozzarella cheese so I chopped string cheese. Delicious!

I made this a couple months back.  I didn't love it.  The chicken mixture was pretty dry.  I didn't change much about the recipe.  I did add some garlic, but we add garlic to everything.  Not sure if I will make again.

The stuffing for these is wonderful--very tasty. However, when I make this dish again, I will not use tomato sauce as the topping. It lacked flavor. I plan to make my spaghetti sauce without meat and pour over it. Or a canned spaghetti sauce would work as well. But just using the tomato sauce was not good.

I used other reviewers suggestions and simmered the chicken in olive oil, garlic, and italian seasonings. I used fresh basil and oregano in the filling and also added about 1.5 oz cream cheese to the mixture. I made a whole box of shells and froze half of them for another time. Very good! thanks for the recipe!

Kind of plain tasting, and I didn't have much on hand to fix that. Too much prep for not so much taste.

I did change the method for this . I baked the chicken, then shredded it and cooked the onions in a little olive oil until just tender. I then mixed in the breadcrumbs, egg, herbs and cheeses. My only change to the ingredients was to use pasta sauce instead of tomato. We all loved this and it also worked really well with fake chicken for my oldest daughter. Many Thanks.

I made this for dinner last night.It was very good.I did do a few things my way.I coated the chicken with eggs and bread crumbs instead of mixing them all together in the pan. I used spices my family likes ,garlic salt,onion powder,italian seasong and pepper. I also let the chicken cool for a min then added the cheese less mess than letting it melt together and I used spagetti sauce. We all liked it alot will make it again.

These were pretty good. My family enjoyed them. Different from the ricotta cheese stuffed shells but a nice change. I did use spaghetti sauce rather than tomato sauce. I would make this again.

Overall, very tasty and semi-easy recipe.  Next time I make this I will just use breaded chicken tenders dipped in milk and the seasonings (the chicken and bread crumbs were a pain and breaded meat will result in the same product overall).  I will also use a jar of spaghetti sauce; tomato sauce just didn't cut it!

I didn't think adding the egg and chicken and bread crumbs would work, but even though it looks odd, it tastes great :-) I used a bit more sauce too.

Great recipe!  Really good flavor but needs more sauce and shredded or very small cubed chcicken.  We used a jar of spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce which added to the flavor.  We will definitely have this again.  Great make ahead prep for an event.

MY HUSBAND COULDN'T RAVE MORE ABOUT THIS RECIPE!  I cook ALOT! I vary dishes all the time, this one I only added mushrooms and more onion for him.  For some reason it smells like holidays cooking!  I also added the bread crumbs and then the cheese last. Without a doubt you could follow it exactly and still get awesome feedback!

This was a perfect substitute for stuffed shells with just cheese on the inside.  It's fun to make and has great presentation.  I will definitely continue to make this recipe.  Thanks a lot!

This was VERY good!  I did use speg. sauce (about 3/4 of the jar) instead of tomato and added garlic.  Next time I will use more sauce to really sauce it up.  I normally hate when things get too "saucy" but I thought it was a little dry.  Other than that, this was AWESOME!!!

I used all fresh herbs from my garden -  the filling tasted almost exacty like chicken parmesan. Next time I will use extra sauce and maybe something to make the filling a little creamier. It was a little too thick for my taste.

Thank you! My three year old is extremely picky and he ate every last bite of this dish. I used manicotti, added 2 cloves of garlic, colby jack instead of cheddar and a hearty tomato sauce and it was great; a lot better than I expected.

This was really good and I also made some changes based on a few recommendations of others. I doubled the recipe for our big family and added some cheddar cheese, a package of frozen, chopped spinach, some parmesan and romano, and used leftover rotisserie chicken (put through a food processor).  I did use two eggs but did not use any bread crumbs and it was amazing.  I also seasoned it with some salt/pepper.  I never measure anything when I cook, so just "wing it" and you won't go wrong with this recipe!  This will definitely be one we repeat!

Loved this!  We omitted the egg and used the oil in the pan instead like a previous reviewer mentioned.  We also added some parmesean cheese and substituted the tomato sauce for an italian sausage spaghetti sauce (considering adding italian sausage next time!) yum!

Suprisingly good! I was a little worried but i added some ricotta, as others suggested, to make it a little creamier.  It was really good. Definitly needed much more than the asked for sauce, i used double.  A good alternative to just the ricotta shells

I made this recipe once with an alfredo sauce and once with a tomato sauce.  We definitely liked the tomato sauce better.  The alfredo sauce makes it a little too creamy for my taste with all the cheese that is in it.  Otherwise, it was pretty good.  I would aim for less tomato sauce as opposed to more.  If there is too much sauce on it, the flavor of the chicken seems to get lost.

We loved this recipe!!  My kids and husband ate it up.  I was a little concerned about the egg cooking in the skillet so I cooked the chick and onion (with some garlic) first and stirred the breadcrumbs (panko) and egg in at just before the cheese.  Then like others, I added a small container of ricotta.  I also used pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce.  It was good.  I didn't have any problem with the shells getting hard ... The texture was perfect.  I would serve this to company and there is enough for my family of four to eat a second meal.

I thought this recipe was pretty good, I did as some of the others did and added ricotta. I think that next time I would add less onion. and maybe a bit of garlic. It tasted very good. Its a nice alternative to the "regular" stuffed shells.

I was trying something different with this recipe, but it probably would have been better with a white sauce. Yummy stuffing. Hubby said he preferred the red sauce with the hamburger/ricotta stuffing we usually use.

This was excellent. The only problem I had was that I searched 3 grocery stores trying to find jumbo shells and all were out, so I just substituted manicotti and cut them in half after cooking. This was so good that I had to stop myself from having a third helping.

We just got done eating... OH MY GOSH!  These are so good... Who doesn't like chicken and cheese?!  We didn't have any bread crumbs or onion on hand, instead of tomoto sauce, we used "Marinara" sauce, and instead of Mozarella, we used Pizza mix cheese.  I suspect you could use a pizza sauce also!  They turned out great and my wife loved them! A+

The chicken stuffing is really good, shells got tough in oven.  Will use chicken mix again with an over haul.  No shell pasta, maybe rice.

My whole family loved this recipe, even my very picky 9 year old asked for seconds! And she loved helping stuff the shells!  I added some parmesan cheese because I had only 1/2 the cheddar requested.  We will definitely put this recipe on a regular schedule!

I thought these were boring.  I'm not a big white chicken fan, though, so I should have known.  As I was making the them, I found myself wishing that I had ground beef or pork for more of a meat canneloni dish.  My husband didn't care much for them either.  Maybe it's just us.

I just used this recipe as a base. It was ok, but not worth the time it took to put together. I didn't include the chicken, I just made the cheese/onion mixture. I made a regular spaghetti sauce (ragu and ground turkey) to pour on top of the shells, and topped w/mozzarella. It wasn't phenomenal enough to be worth the effort. I will stick to buying frozen stuffed shells, or look for a recipe w/a ricotta stuffing. Not bad, but only worth 2 1/2 or 3 stars.

This was just ok. I don't mind a lot of prep work if it's a spectacular dish, but it literally takes 2 hours to make (and i have 2 children under 4 so 2 hours to preparing dinner is a stretch anyhow... but it sounded so good) Anyways, it was good, but nothing I would prepare again because the amount of work involved didn't give me a dinner that was worth spending that amount of time to fix. It seemed to lack something, and I had way too much filling for the amount of shells.

This recipe was ehhh.... at the end it was good I guess...the chicken didnt taste like anything. Maybe I needed more seasoning or something. I read from another review that 26oz jar of spaghetti sauce wasnt enough..well I don't know what size pan they used but it was too much for mine. It came out super saucy...overall...OK...would make again? Probably not.

Very good - it was pretty time consuming, but easy to make.  They came out wonderfully, but the chicken didn't have a lot of flavor to it.  Next time, I may try to marinate the chicken first and then stuff the shells - but it was delicious and my boyfriend was very impressed with the meal.

Don't use the tomato sauce! I have made this a handful of times over the past few months and the only way to go is by using a great spaghetti sauce. I personally like mine veggie/chunky so I use that instead. Very good. Time consuming but good.

It's good...if I was to make this again, I would cut back on the amount of bread crumbs and cheese, because it was kinda dry. I did use spaghetti sauce instead of just tomato sauce. My 18 month old ate 2 1/2 shells. So that was good, at least he got some protein.

Everyone in the family loved this dish. I added fresh garlic,and will add mushrooms next time. Use pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce. I will be making this again.

I added garlic and mushrooms to this fabulous recipe and left out the basil. My husband can't stop raving about it! And it makes enough for leftovers!! Thanks for a quick and easy dinner solution!! :)

We enjoyed this recipe fully and it did just fine in our pan.  One thing I did was use our food chopper after the chicken was cooked before the cheese was added - this made it much easier/smoother to put into the shells.

I didn't have any chicken on hand so just made it with lots of onions.  It is soooo good!  Doubled the amount of sauce used.  This is a great make-ahead dish for warm, yummy lunches.  It microwaved great.  Next time, I will add spinich and forget the chicken.

My family thought this recipe was great my girls really enjoyed it. It was very easy to make, although I would put pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce over it. This is a meal I will make quite often.

The bread crumbs and chicken mixture made a huge mess.  It ruined my skillet.  A jar of spaghetti suace would be a better alternative instead of the tomato sauce.  Not worth 5 stars.  Too much work!

Very happy I tried this recipe, though you might wind up using more sauce than what's listed.
