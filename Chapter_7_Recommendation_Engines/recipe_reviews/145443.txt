I used beef instead of chicken and broccoli instead of peas and roasted bell peppers instead of pimentos and it came out good. Very versitile recipe to use what you have on hand! Thanks!

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it. I wasn't sure what to expect with this receipe. I followed exactly except for the pimentos (used red pepper instead). The first few bites were a bit of a surprise but I ended up wanting more when I finished. Needs to be cooked longer than directed - until the liquid reduces - and is delicious the next day.

I would not recommend this recipe as is. The ratio of orzo to liquid is not right. I had to drain half of the liquid, because it was very soupy.  I would recommend reducing the amount of beer and/or broth, and doubling the amount of orzo.  Also, it does not specify what type of beer to use. We used a hoppy amber ale and the result was not as palatable as it could have been. Once I adjusted the recipe the overall result was pretty tasty.

Really not good.  Really really.  In an attempt to save the pan of food, I strained it and rinsed it completely.  Added some black beans and served it on corn taco shells.

Both my husband and I found this dish completely unpalatable (I type this review as I am about to leave to go get fast food).  The only thing I did different was used fresh bell peppers instead of pimentos. I really don't think the use of pimentos would have changed the outcome of this dish. Please save your ingredients!!!!

Sure, it's easy, and it's a one-pot recipe, but it was really bitter. I made it with a pumpkin ale after reading some of the reviews saying it was bitter, and my husband and I couldn't even finish what was on our plates.

Really bitter, weird sloppy consistency, not sure what could save this. I went with it in the first place because it was the "chicken recipe of the day" but I guess that doesn't mean All Recipes vets it first.

Found this to be simple and fairly tasty - though the turmeric is a bit out of balance.  This would be why some found it bitter and unpalatable, of course turmeric is one of those tastes you like or hate.  I was worried it would be soupy, but a little extra time in the pan fixed that.  Can't wait to try the beef and broccoli variation noted earlier.
