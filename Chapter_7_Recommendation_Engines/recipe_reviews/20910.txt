This is a great recipe if you need to make a lot of salsa or want to make a bunch at once and can it or freeze it. We cut the recipe by about a fourth and it still made about 8 cups. We froze it in 2 cup sizes, as the bottles at the store are 16 ounces. 
These are the modifications I made to the recipe, for our 1/4 size batch. I did my own calculations, as I didn't trust the ones on the site to be accurate enough, and they did turn out with different numbers than I did.
I actually didn't have as much fresh tomatoes as it called for (nor did I have a food mill), so I actually just used 1/2 the amount in fresh tomatoes and 1/2 the amount in crushed tomatoes, and it turned out great. I used 4 large tomatoes. With the fresh tomatoes, I peeled them by cutting an x on the non-stem end and dipping them in boiling water to make the peel easier to remove. Then I cut them into quarters and put them into my food processor (I didn't bother seeding them). I put the crushed tomatoes into the food processor as well (one large 28 oz can) of crushed tomatoes and one 6 ounce can of tomato paste. Then you boil all of this and while this is boiling down (to reduce the liquid) you can work on chopping everything else. We used 1/2 bunch of cilantro, 1 bell pepper (seeded) and one onion, 1/2 head of crushed garlic and one seeded jalapeno pepper. I had never worked with jalapeno before, and I used gloves to handle it. I was afraid of making it too spicy, so I only used 1 pepper, but after I tasted a

This is the salsa you MUST make! It is amazing. I halfed the recipe and it was lots for our family. I did add some green onions for colour. Be sure to make this recipe as it is stated then it will be fabulous! I dont have a mill so I just chopped it and pureed it in this little chopper gadget that I have.  Worked great!  Next time I am going to use only 4 jalepenos in the recipe that I halfed because with 8 it was a bit too spicy for me! My husband loves it spicy! 
This is the best salsa recipe that I have found yet.  Just perfect. We are having mexican tonight now!  Highly recommend and thanks for sharing Joyce!

This is a great salsa recipe. I've searched for an "authentic" salsa recipe to mimic my favorite restaurant's recipe and this definitely hits the mark. I've made it several times following the 2o serving recipe and have a several things I changed to fit my tastes. Depending on how many serving you want to prepare you should adjust your cook time. For 20 servings, you will only have to boil 30 minutes at the most to reduce it by 1/3.

I boiled the tomatoes until the skin cracked to help with peeling them. I doubled the cilantro because I love the flavor it gives the salsa. I used 4 large jalepeno peppers and 2 serrano peppers to get a nice medium heat. I did not use the bell peppers because if I wanted that kind of salsa I'd just buy a jar of Pace. I also didn't use 1/2 head of garlic. Just use maybe a third of it.

I made this once and it had no heat at all. I figured out that I accidentally put the peppers in when I first started boiling the tomato mixture. If you do that it'll cook all the heat out of the peppers. It'll smell hot as fire, but actually be kind of sweet tasting. If the salsa is too "soupy" for your taste try saving 1/4 of the tomato chunks that you prepared at the beginning to throw in with your peppers towards the end of the cooking cycle.

I hope this will help others learn from my mistakes. :)

This is great!  The neighbors and I are making our second batch.  Modified by substituting apple cider vinegar and white sugar since it was what I had on hand.  I also did not add the water and cornstarch.  Instead, I let the sauce cook about 3.5 hours until it reduced.  The flavors are wonderful!

Finally, a salsa recipe worth making! As close to and better than the store bought salsa's. I also tweaked it a bit....a little less sugar, chopped cayenne and used Early Girl, Roma, and Sun Gold cherry tomatoes. Yum....

This recipe was delicious.  One thing I would caution about is the time it takes to prepare this recipe.  It took me an entire day, granted I canned the salsa.  I also changed a few things in the recipe...I seeded my jalepenos and boiled my veggies in the tomato sauce for 30 minutes before adding my diced tomatoes.  I ended up with a delicous chuncky salsa that I will be proud to serve at any get together.

Best Salsa Recipe I've found.  I like many others tweeked it a little...but only a little.  I added 1 cup fresh lime juice with zest and 1/2 cup diced carrots (for crunch).  It was really, really wonderful!  I am thrilled to have found a salsa at last that is worth all the time and effort!!

I've made this recipe about 4 times now.  Everytime it has worked great.  Salsa is thick and clings to the chips.  My family and guests just love it.

Sooo tasty! It seemed really spicy when I tasted it during cooking, but after canning, it's extremely mild.  I gave the veggies a quick whirl in the food processor, and it ended up with the taste and texture of the salsa/hot sauce served at Taco Time (a chain in western Washington).  The salsa seems to be universally loved by kids.

I loved this combination of ingredients.  The Cilantro is the key ingredient to making this fresh and authentic tasting Salsa.  I prefer a less spicy Salsa and this is perfect!  I changed the technique a bit.  After I skinned my tomatoes I run through a blender to make the consistency of crushed tomatoes.  I then followed the rest as directed. Now I have the perfect taste and consistency.  I half the recipe and it makes about 10 pints.

Wow, sooo good! I used mostly Romas fresh from the garden. Only 1 head of garlic, 2 bunches cilantro, about 10 huge jalapenos, half w/ seeds, 3 T salt, which was plenty, no sugar and added juice of 2 limes. Everything else is right on and the texture is perfect and it's pretty spicy the way I love it.  Oh, and I did chop everything but 3/4 of the tomatoes in the food processor. Perfect!! My new favorite.

First time making salsa and I LOVED this recipe! For me it was very time consuming but well worth the work.  The only changes that I had, I felt that I didn't have enough bell pepper so I added in some hot banana peppers. This is one of those foods that you can't stop eating once you start!  I will make this again.

I halved this recipe and still got 15 jars of salsa.  It is a great and simple recipe, albeit time consuming to peel, core and chop all those tomatoes, let alone the onion and pepppers!  I made this recipe exactly as written and will make it again this way in future, but may add more chili, as per the author's suggestion as I was worried about ending up with a too hot salsa.  We have already made great salsa eggs for breakfast with this and served with sour cream and tortilla chips to our friends.

Awesome salsa recipe! Scared to make a large recipe of salsa - I did half this recipe the first time around and had family sample for approval. Awesome salsa recipe - mild and slightly sweet.  On the second time around, I skipped the water part = I just removed 1.5 c hot tomato/salsa, stirred the cornstarch in, and added it all back in.  Gets really thick but I have a high salsa to chip ratio anyways. For those of you who've made a few different versions of salsa before, you can play around with the heat (ie: chili powder, red peppers, or hot sauce) without losing the spicy sweet essence of this recipe. A must try for any novice or if you want to mix up your salsa selections.  Thanks!

This is a really great recipe.  I've only made salsa a couple of times, and this one will be my go-to recipe from here on out.  Just sweet enough, just tangy enough, and just spicy enough.  My toddlers even enjoy it!  What more can you ask for??

I was really looking forward to making this recipe, but I must say we didn't really enjoy it. Tasted like jarred salsa mixed with brown sugar. Hard to describe the taste.. just different. It was okay on/in things, but not by itself. It was very time consuming, not worth all of the work.

This was very very good.  I did add juice from half a lemon, which made it a little better.  I would have used lime, but I can't get that where I live.  Thanks for this recipe!

This is the best!  I used roma tomatoes for my first batch, which worked out wonderfully.  I made a half batch and then split that batch in half to make mild and "hotter than blazes."  Used almost twice as much cilantro as the recipe called for and slightly less brown sugar.  I added five or six Thai chili peppers from our garden to the mild batch of salsa.  My husband added a couple of scotch bonnets to his batch.  I cooked the peppers and onions in the sauce for about 15 minutes before adding the tomatoes as recommended.  I also added the cornstarch at the end right before I bottled it up.  I will never buy commercial salsa again!

This is the THIRD year that I've made this recipe from fresh garden tomatoes. The only substitute that I make is that I add 1/2 cup lime juice and 1/2 cup vinegar. No sugar, our tomatoes are sweet enough. ####Perfect replica of my favorite mexican restaurant's salsa. I only wish I could figure out what kind of chips they use. YUMMMY. This makes a ton so be prepared to give to friends. Of course, it is hard to hand over that perfect yummy jar. I have a hard time sharing. : )

While this recipe is time consuming, it is the best homemade recipe ever. We added more jalapenos because we like it hot! We split the batch in two and added one habanero to half the batch. It's hot, but oh so good!

This was very good. I cut the vinegar in half so it wouldn't over power the flavor. I also seeded the jalepenos. I will definately make again. thanks!

This salsa is the best.  I cut the batch size down because I only had 9 lbs of tomatoes. The only changes I made were adding little more cilantro and leaving out the tomato paste.  (I love cilantro and relized to late that I didn't have the tomatoe paste) Otherwise I followed the recipe as stated.  According to my husband, "It is the best salsa I have never had."  That is good enough for me.  I will be making a whole batch to can this weekend.  Thanks

I loved this recipe! I made a half batch and almost wish I had made a whole batch it's so delicious- but even with half I have enough canned salsa to last monthes! I used less jalapenos for a mild salsa, and pureed the onions and peppers as well so the only chunks are tomato chunks(for picky eaters in the house).  I will be making this salsa again when I run out- perfect blend of flavors and wonderful texture. Thanks for the recipe!

This took some time to make but it was so worth it. I canned them but they didn't last long. Sooo good! I would definitely make this again!!!

Excellent recipe!  Made using only Roma and Grape Roma tomatoes.  Blanched tomatoes for about 1 minute to loosen skins prior to peeling. I chopped all of the ingredients in food processor and cooked for 45 mins.  I reduced the salt in 1/2.  Replaced vinegar and jalepenos with a 16 oz jar of sliced jalepenos.

Absolutely excellent salsa.  I made mine like an authentic Mexican restaurant by throwing everything in the food processor. Using this method, I probably saved some time too.  I used twice as many jalapenos and probably could use even more.  I definitely will make this again. Great recipe!  Thanks!

I have a small to medium garden each year...just kills me to throw out the large amount of tomatoes that I have as I take down the garden.  Last year tried homemade salsa for the first time with this recipe....Absolutely wonderful!  I took out the seeds from the jalapenos....should have left about 1/3 in.  (this depends on the size of the veggie too i think since the heat comes from the seeds and center)  Be sure to wear gloves when handling the jalapenos...  
Made this again this year.  Used my large roaster that I use during holidays...worked out well!  Yielded 27 pint jars...Be sure you have all things cut and ready so that you can keep the string going.  This year, I used seeds and core in half of the jalapenos...just a bit spicier/hotter...still not bad.  Very good flavor!  If you are a beginner, have all things prepared before cooking starts.  You can peel and core toms ahead of time and freeze if necessary....I gave jars away to daycare families for xmas with goody bags....they all raved about this!  Don't think I need to look for another recipe since everyone seems to love this one!

I loved this salsa!  My husband and I are huge salsa eaters, and this is the perfect recipe. I put the ingredients into my food processer before I simmer them for a less chunky texture.  We also can this recipe so we can enjoy the fresh taste all year long.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We loved this salsa, and will make again!  It does taste like the kind they serve in Mexican restaurants.  We did 1/3 of a batch with 8 lbs. tomatoes.  The other ingredient amounts we decreased accordingly, but used dried cilantro (about 1 T.) and white sugar.  We didn't have a food mill, and like our salsa a little chunky, so I just cooked the tomatoes all cut up together about 1 hour (liquid and pieces).  This worked fine.  We don't mind a few seeds.  Also... we only put the seeds of one of the jalapeÃ±os  (1 of 5) in, and were glad we did... it was just the right amount of spice.  YUM!!!  This won't last long around here!!!

The use of tomato paste in this salsa gave it a weird texture. In addition, the taste was just "blah". Nothing special.

This is just great,I made 18 qts so far. I changed the amounts of the peppers. I put 1 1/2 cups jalapeno and cut the bell to 2 cups. I make salsa every year, and wanted to try something new. I'll always use this from now on. Thanks Marie in Oklahoma

I scaled this down to 20 servings and while it was still good there was too much sugar.  Hubby said it almost tasted like a "dessert" salsa.  I also didn't peel the tomatoes because hubby doesn't mind the skins.  A great way to use up the garden seconds.  Will make again with less sugar.

This was super delicious.  We will probably add a few more jalapenos next time to kick it up because we are eating this stuff way too fast.  Thanks for the recipe!

Okay, maybe I need help, but mine did not turn out as wonderfully as everyone else's.  The flavor was okay, but after 30 minutes of boiling, the tomatoes all but deconstructed entirely, leaving me with a very soupy consistency. Next time I would saute the onions and green peppers first, then only heat the tomatoes through so they keep some of their shape.

My family and I LOVE this recipe! I have made it for the last five or six years and have been told many times that this is the "Best Salsa ever". I make it as listed but also add about 1/2 cup of diced fresh carrots for some added crunch and sweetness and some extra fresh cilantro. The only draw back of making this is that it does take ALL day. However, I pack it in hot canning jars and it keeps very well.

Nice because it wasn't as watery as other fresh salsas, but we like the chunky non-cooked versions better.

I enjoyed this a lot.  I scaled it WAYYY back to four servings because of what I had in the garden.  Also, I did not process it--I could have eaten the whole amount in just one sitting.  I did not find it to be too sweet, as other had mentioned.  The directions confused me a little.  Once I had everything in one pot, I just transferred it all into my food processor and gave it a few spins.  Great smooth-ish texture and wonderful, fresh flavor.  The only real changes I made we extra garlic and a squeeze of fresh lime.

I used this for my salsa this past summer and it is a hit!!!  I made 2 1/2 batches and adjusted the peppers each time to make different levels of hotness.  I had planted salsa peppers and they worked great for this recipe.

This is by far the best salsa I have ever tasted.  I go to Mexican restaurants and it doens't compare to this recipe.  It took a little bit longer than for us to make it, but I would double the batch next time because my family has already went through 5 jars in about 3 weeks.

I FOLLOWED THE recipe AND made some great tasting Salsa ,My question is ,when you make a large amount do you have to add any lemon juice I order to can it? I made a smaller batch with the reduction amounts in your program . I did three jars and did the water bath for 15 mins I had the salsa hot and did not cool it down .the jars sealed fine and I tasted one jar that I did not can and we ate the whole pint! let me know your thoughts as I want to do a full size recipe when all my tomatoes ripen,Thanks ,Dennis

I've been using this recipe for several years and it turns out well with a great flavor.  I usually omit the cornstarch and the majority of the tomato paste (and we don't miss either).
However, the last time I made a batch, I decided to make a full batch and can it.  If I do this again, I will DEFINITELY omit the sugar.  The longer this sits, the sweeter it gets. The last jar I opened was too sweet for my tastes.

This is nowhere near hot enough fro me. I did seed the jalapeno, so that might be part of it. I'm going to add some red pepper flakes to get the heat up.This salsa doesn't look as red as I would like it, with all the cilantro it just turned sort of brownish.

Ive tried a lot of salsa! But this one is my new favourite. I was afraid of dissapointment (since I have been quite a few times in the past) so I reduced the recipe quite a bit and now I'm dying to make more. Its perfectly balanced iny opinion unless your not a coriander and garlic person of course. I love both so I couldn't help adding more ;)

At a farmers market a while ago I got a PILE of tomatoes very cheap at the end of the season. I made this massive amount - froze more half in plastic freezer bags. My son loved it, and I used much of it in all kinds of Mexican recipes. I cut and pasted the recipe and put it under 'Food', one of my word files. When going through the 'freezer' somehow a bag of it was still around, and it was . . . five years old (embarrassing) because it was such a hit - out of curiosity I thawed it to see how it was . . . amazing, it was still pretty good. We are having our 25 anniversary in ten days I'll be making this again, but probably with canned tomatoes!

Absolute best!  If you are looking for salsa that tastes close to Carlos O'Kelly's, then this is it!
