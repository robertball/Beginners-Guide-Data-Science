I made these today as a treat for my nephews who are milk- and egg-allergic, so I went into it knowing that the results would be a little atypical.  Knowing that, I thought these dark, fudgey, not-too-sweet brownies were pretty tasty for what they were (and gave it a 4-stars based on that).  The kids liked them.  Their mother thinks they are worth adding to her recipe file.  That said, my husband took one, unsuspecting bite and said "These are gross."

These brownies were very bitter and cakey, I probably will never cook them again. That is just my opinion but I am sure that others may love them.

They were ok.  I added marshmallows and that made them a little better, but they weren't sweet enough for me.

I thought they came out very cake-like.  They were really yummy, just not wot I expected.

I like the texture of this brownie.  Very moist and chewey.  Not too sweet.  Use only 1/4 cup oil which is good for people who are watching their weight.  However, I had to bake for 35 minutes.

The brownie was very yummy. Moist and my guest was surprised to know that no eggs were used in this.

I Love these brownies! !! I would give them 10 stars But, I didn't have vanilla extract so I used leftover coffee instead and didn't add the water as written. Also used mint chocolate chunks for the semi sweet chips. I scooped batter into cupcake papers for individual servings.  The flavor of these babies is  CHOCOLATEY!!  The name says it ALL, HEAVEN! Thank You Ryan:):)

Best recipe ever it tastes better than a brownie with eggs I cooked this for 25 mins and it was perfectly flat it didnt break apart and perfect I will continue to use this my family thought I went to a bakery but no I cooked it I recommend this if you are allergic to eggs or dont have eggs with you. I left out vanilla extract i didn't replace it I just left it out and still the best but I made the brownies better with a chocolate butter cream recipe.  If I could rate it higher it would be 1 million stars.
