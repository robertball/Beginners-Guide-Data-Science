Excellent recipe.  I used  12 cups of figs, quartered and 6 cups of white sugar.  I have also used orange jello.  I simmered for thirty minutes before adding the jello and then proceeded as per recipe.  Delicious preserves

This was so easy and so yummy!!  I only had raspberry jello on hand and it turned out fantastic.  This recipe made four small jars for me which was just right for our family.  Next time I am going to try black cherry jello and I bet it will be just as tasty.

This recipe is great!  They taste just like the ones my grandmother made back in the 60's.  My granddaughter, who is a strawberry lover, had never tasted figs and she loved them, too.

Followed Paula's instructions to a T in the cooking process. And it didn't disappoint not one ounce! I didn't want to do a water bath after I tasted the hot batch and knew instantly, it was going to be a hit with my kids. I can say, I never would have thought to use flavored gelation in preserves and being this was only 3 ingredients in a flash to perfection! What made this totally ridiculously sinful was baking off some puff pastry cut into squares, opening up the cavity slathering a dollop of Cool Whip's frosting (something I have never used before until this), warm preserves and topped with the 2nd half of the pastry square and eating like it is...OMGosh! talk about heaven. This unusual recipe for me was quite easy, tasty and affordable! My whole family loved it! Thanks again. It will be something I do with other flavors of gelatin!

This was an easy, wonderful recipe.  I used peach jello the first time and it was very tasty.  I didn't bother with any boiling of the jars....I just put the preserves in "tupperware" and gave out to my family members and kept the rest in the fridge.  My husband loved it!  I made again with strawberry jello and we liked it just as much! I did use splenda instead of sugar...so I used a little less because of the extra sweetness of splenda.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I made this batch today. I doubled the recipe, and I added my own touch to it as well. It turned out amazing!! I used 8 cups of figs, but only 5 cups of sugar. Figs are naturally very sweet anyway, and I also added about 2 tlbs. of lemon juice just to give it a little tartness. I didn't measure my lemon juice though. I just added, and tasted!!  I also used a 6 oz. box of strawberry Jello. Will be having some on homemade biscuits in a couple of day's!! #delicious

I just made this and my husband loves it.  I am only giving the recipe 4 stars because it is too sweet.  Does anyone know if I could reduce the amount of sugar by 1 cup?  I love the fact that it is so easy to make!  I never made homemade preserves before. Next time I will cut up the figs into small pieces and then mash them a bit with a fork before cooking rather than trying to mash them later when the mixture is so hot.   -Debbie

I was given this recipe years ago, but mine called for 3 of the small boxes of Jello and I boiled the mixture for 15 min.  Also, I like my preserves more like jam, so I add 1.5oz (3 Tbsp) of liquid pectin with citric acid for a better jell.

I've been using this recipe for years (couldn't find it, so I googled it here, it is the same one) My entire family loves it...my collage grandson waits for figs to come in so he can have more to take to school. I would give it a 6 star if you had one.  thanks

I tripled the recipe, since I had a lot of figs. Ran the figs through the food processor, and proceeded with the recipe as is. Excellent results! Everyone loves them, even my picky, non-fruit eating son! Thanks for posting this recipe:)

I have made this for years and it is always  big hit! This year I tried it with the peach Jello. Yummy!! I also cut the sugar two to one  as mentioned in one other review and there was no discernable difference.  This time I pulsed it about 2 or 3 seconds in the blender in three batches instead of mashing. So easy and sooo good!

I've made this many times & everyone loves it. This is very similar to my grandma's recipe. If you're using whole figs I recommend using 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  I also add a little bit of lemon juice to mine.  You can pay around with different flavors of jello.  I usually use either strawberry or cherry. Great,  easy recipe :)

I've been using this recipe for over 50 years! This  is a great recipe and it never fails. Over the years I've used all different flavors of Jello. Cherry, black cherry, raspberry,  strawberry. They are all delicious! We have never found it to be too sweet but then my entire family are really big sweet eaters!  Always wanted to try peach, orange and even lemon. Maybe I'll try those flavors next year.

I didn't make any changes for the first batch and found it a bit sweet for my family's taste.  I gave some to my neighbor and she loved it. Thanks for the good idea in using up our abundance of fresh figs.

We get so many figs off our tree and I found this recipe 2 summers ago and everyone loves it so this is what I do with all my figs now. I end up making several double batches. I have tried cherry, raspberry, and peach in addition to strawberry but we all agree strawberry is best. I bought a handheld immersion blender to break up the chunks of fig because a potato masher like the recipe suggests wasn’t doing the trick. I gave a jar to my kids teachers last year for Christmas and one of them is asking to buy some from me this year because she loved it so much. Easy and yummy!

Great base recipe that you can change up by simply altering the flavor of jello you use. I used peach and the results were spectacular.
