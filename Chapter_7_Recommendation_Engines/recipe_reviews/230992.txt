My husband and two boys' favorite dip. I usually don't bother adding the additional jalapeno peppers. One full recipe will fit up to the top of my small Lil' Dipper crockpot. If I throw all the ingredients in as I'm cleaning up the breakfast dishes, it's usually ready by lunch.

For this last Super Bowl, I used a maple sausage to give it a sweet and spicy flavor.  It was amazing, I really recommend trying it.

This dip had really good flavor, but was kind of runny.  Very hard to dip with tortilla chips.  I kept the slow cooker on for a lot longer than 2 hours to try to thicken it up.  It did eventually but not according to the recipe.

Made this for super bowl.  Some of my guest would have given it  4 or 5 stars but I just thought it was ok.  In my experience, nothing special ever started with 2 lbs. of velveeta.   Had a processed aftertaste to it.

Like this a lot! I substituted processed cheese for better shredded cheese though. I hate process cheese...

This is very yummy, but next time I'll use ground beef instead of sausage. Don't be scared of the spicy ingredients. The 2 lbs. of Velveeta balance it out, and it really tastes great.

Try it with half cheddar and half Velveeta. That's the business. Also, use a can of spicy Rotel tomatoes instead of salsa. Yum!
