This recipe is a great beginning, but a few changes are necessary to make the cookies the type that everyone raves about:  1.Add a banana to the mush and a quarter-cup of oatmeal for more banana flavor, otherwise you barely get the taste . 2. Skip the cloves, add another teaspoon of cinnamon. 3. Add a 1/2-3/4 teaspoon of baking soda so that the cookies rise a bit, they don't in the original recipe.  4.  Switch half of the white flour w/ whole wheat flour, it tastes the same and is much healthier. 5.  Use white choc. chips!--huge difference, goes much better w/ banana taste. These changes make the cookies superb, and your friends won't stop asking for more!

This deserves five stars. (And I'm stingy with giving out five star ratings.) The cookies are soft, slightly spicy, and absolutely delicious. I didn't have cloves so I used a bit of pumpkin pie spice and the results were fantastic. The cookie sheet was ravaged by my husband and I before the cookies even had a chance to cool.  EDIT: January 29, 2009  I've been making these for a few years now and they are always awesome. I add a bit more banana and vanilla and some nutmeg and extra cinnamon- I like a lot of spice in my cookies. I have also used butter and margarine or a mix because of the whole trans fat thing. (No more margarine for me!) I have also added milk chocolate chips to half of the cookies for my hubby. Still a keeper after all these years! :)

This is a good cookie, it's just not a great cookie. Other than using butter rather than shortening I followed the recipe as written. This is not short on flavor, as the oatmeal, banana and nutty flavors are all prominent. It has a rustic, whole grain texture, not cakey at all, just that of a chewy oatmeal cookie. There is nothing wrong with the recipe, but it will never make a chocolate chip cookie move over.

Tired of banana bread, I chose this recipe as a way of using up ripe bananas.  I used four bananas (not one), margarine instead of shortening, extra cinnamon, no cloves and some chocolate chips but otherwise kept the quantities of the ingredients unchanged.  The result was a very moist and tasty cake-like cookie, which was particularly good fresh from the oven.  I was surprised at how many cookies it made.  I shall make these again when I have bought too many  bananas!

I didn't hae bananas for once, but had some banana cream pudding mix, used that instead.  After doing so, I realized I should have perhaps added more moisture to take the place of the wetness of the fruit, but actually, these turned out great.  I made them three ways 1)rolled in balls - they formed puffy domes all nice and soft 2)rolled in balls and flattened slightly - nice thick even cookies that were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside 3)spooned out and flattened pretty well - crisp crunchies.  My family loved the three kinds from just one batch.  Good stuff!

SOOO good, interesting as well.  I used butter instead of shortening, nutmeg instead of cloves, omitted the walnuts and added 3/4 c chocolate chunks (mostly due to what I had or did not have).  Like other reviewers, I also needed to bake them for 12 min.  Will make again!

These cookies were really yummy, especially after adding raisins and a handful of unsweetened shredded coconut. I made them plain and with the above additions and the raisin-coconut addition made them soooo much better. I like the plain ones too, but my boyfriend only likes the ones with the extras. (I didn't have walnuts so neither of the batches had them). I should mention that I tried to make these a bit healthier by using only 1/2 cup of shortening and adding extra banana to increase moistness...I used 1 cup banana and it worked great. Also, I didn't have cloves on hand so I used pumpkin pie spice like someone suggested and it worked well. In the end, these are a nice change from banana bread, but I think I still prefer to use my extra bananas for banana bread.

They are soft cookies but do not have the texture of cakes (which is good). The rolled oats give them a good texture. The taste is not bad but need some getting used to. I cut the shortening to 1/2 C, sugar to 3/4 C and used pumpkin pie spice instead of cloves. Also, instead of adding walnuts, I substitute with chocolate chips (1 C). In addition, I used 3 medium-sized bananas. Two thumbs up for the fact that they are healthy cookies :)

Yum!  I used a 1/2 cup real butter (I never use shortening) & doubled the banana for moisture, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup white flour and I did not have enough brown sugar, so I used 1/2 cup brown & 1/2 cup white.  I also only used about 1/8 tsp cloves as I did not want to over-power the banana flavor.  These turned out WAY better than I expected and I found it hard to stop eating the uncooked dough!  I will definately use this recipe again.

AWESOME! Use these changes for perfect cookies! replace 1cup whole wheat flour for the white, cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. add 1 beaten egg white with the egg. this while help the dough from getting dry and will help them rise. flatten cookie on cookie sheet(they will rise). bake 10 min. Rasins work as a good sub. for nuts.  suggestion: if you really want a banana tase sub 1/2 vanella extract for banana extract. ENJOY!

Yummy cookies that disappear super fast! These are a soft cookie - like pumpkin cookies. I didn't use any spices, as I wanted a banana tasting cookie. As recommended in other reviews I used three ripened bananas. Increased the walnuts from a 1/2 to 1 cup. Added crasins in one batch, and chocolate chips in the second batch. I used a 1/2 cup of ground oatmeal instead of a 1/2 cup of flour to accommodate for the moisture from the extra banana. Will make the spiced version next. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was a great recipe, and a good alternative to banana bread. Also was very forgiving, in that I was a little short on a couple things.  I left out the cloves, doubled cinnamon.  Used 1/2 butter instead of all shortening & added pecans instead of walnuts.  I would definitely make these again.

Tastes like banana bread in cookie form! I replaced the cloves with nutmeg, left out the nuts (only because I didn't have any) and used butter instead of shortening. I did have to flatten out my cookies before baking because they didn't spread but other than that I had no problems with this recipe. Infact, ill probably make these instead of banana bread when we have too many over-ripe bananas

I was hoping these would be chewy like an oatmeal raisin cookie but they were more like dry little muffin tops.  Tasted ok, but I was expecting them to be more like cookies.  I used butter instead of shortening.  Make sure you press these down with a fork before baking because they do not spread AT ALL and will be raw in the middle.

First off, let me say that I used banana yogurt in place of the shortening and that I only used 2cps quick oats instead of 3cps, along with omitting the walnuts due to not having any.
With that said, these came out great; despite the fact that my oven was at 400 degrees. I will most likely use this one again when I have some leftover bananas.

I was looking for something other than banana bread to bake with my ripe bananas and I really enjoyed these cookies...I used butter shortening, 1 cup chopped pecans (isntead of the walnuts) and I added 1 cup milk chocolate chips.  As suggested by others, I added one extra mashed banana and 1/2 cup oats; I doubled the baking soda, doubled the cinnamon, and deleted the cloves.  I flattened the cookie drops a bit, then baked for 12 minutes.  Delicious...everyone loved them!  Eating the cookies, I kept expecting to bite a raisin, so I may add raisins next time; maybe I'll try a version with white chocolate chips to see how that turns out!  Definitely will make again!

Very tasty. I modified it a bit to siut my needs, by adding only 1/4 cup unsalted butter and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesausce in place of the shortening. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 of a cup (we don't like super sweet cookies). I didn't have cloves so I left those out and added 1/2 baking powder as suggested by another reviewer. They taste just like the banana nut bread! Mine did not spread (probably due to the modifications I made with the shortening). But as long as you flatten them out a bit before or after you stick them in the oven they are fine and to me it's worth the calories saved. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

My whole family REALLY enjoyed this recipe.  The great thing is that I don't feel bad giving my children this cookie.  I doubled the amount of bananas and used half the amount of ground cloves.  Also, I used chocolate chips instead of walnuts.  Thanks for the recipe!!

For those of you who complain about the texture after changing the ingredients--using margarine or butter instead of the shortening the recipe calls for drastically changes the texture of the finished product.

The first time I ever tried baking cookies. I loved them, very healthy, substituted for the shortening with olive oil and apple sauce(home-made), walnuts with cranberries. I used 2 cups oats and 1and 1/2 cups whole wheat flour. The cookies came out soft, next time will try the exact recipe - I like the cookies being hard, so that I can soak them in milk and go all crunchy! But I am happy with the outcome...

Added chocolate chips and left out cloves don't really like cloves except lol, with ham.  The cookies were very bananaish my new word, chewy and soft not bad if you like banana.  Did have to add a bit more flour about 1/2 cup dough looked a bit too wet, after I flattened them.  Did not taste like a muffin top more like a banana flavored oatmeal cookie.  Don't know if I would make again but it was something different :)

Very yummy and moreish. I used olive oil spread (same consistency as soft butter) rather than shortening, plus used raw cashews instead of walnuts. They have a soft cakey sort of consistency rather than a hard crunchy cookie but still very nice. I found they needed about 12 minutes cooking time. They look quite under done when they first come out but firm out while they cool. Kids loved them too!

I decided to make this recipe after a long search trying to decided what to do with a few ripe bananas that I had. I thought maybe this would yield cookies that were not cake-like....but that's not the case. However, these cookies are really good! I kept mine in the refrigerator; they're delicious cold. I did use butter instead of shortening and subbed dried cranberries for the nuts. I'm glad I did because the cranberries were AWESOME. My last thought: a little peanut butter would be really good either mixed into the batter, or use peanut butter chips. That's what I'm trying next time! Thanks for the recipe!

Made this recipe as is and it came out fine.  They taste just like banana bread.  They just came out of the oven and seem very cake-like in texture.  I added 1/2 cup semi-sweet mini chips.  Will make this one again.

A nice change from banana bread and muffins when you have ripe bananas to use up.  I used whole wheat flour to make them even healthier.  They had a wonderful soft muffin like texture.  A double recipe was gone in no time at all in this home full of teens.

This is a very yummy cookie! I have to say they are addictive and you will eat the whole batch in a day! I made some changes to suit my needs. I used 1/2 c. splenda and 1/2c. brown sugar, two medium bananas instead of the recommended amount.I also added 1/2c. raisins that had been softened in a little warm water so they wouldn't be hard little rocks.I had to flatten the cookies prior to baking with a glass, as they did not spread. I also omitted the walnuts, but I think they would have been nice and will add to the next batch which I will be making soon!

These cookies are absolutely delicious! I flattened the dough balls slightly with a fork, and got crisp outside, soft inside, chewy cookies. My only change is the addition of extra banana because I like a LOT of banana flavor!

Really good!  The only change I made was to use butter instead of shortening, because I always feel shortening gives an "after-taste" in a cookie.

These are amazing! I didn't have any shortening so I used a 1/4 cup butter and two bananas. I also added 3/4 cup of raisins. They have great flavor and very soft. YUM!

fabulous..chewy, moist and great flavor.  I used about 4 bananas, added 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour.  A dash of pumpkin pie spice for the clove...also added a handful or two of chocolate chips in one batch...so yum..

I followed the directions exactly and these were not that great. I liked the flavor, but found the texture to be lumpy and dry. They definitely did not spread out like the picture shows. I decided to use the remaining half of the batter and make them into thicker bars by spreading it all into a 8x8 pan.

These cookies were really good, but I made many changes and they turned into more of oatmeal clusters.  I used applesauce and egg whites, no salt, doubled the banana and cut the sugar in half, so i wouldn't expect them to turn out exactly the same, but they tasted great anyway. Plus, they were a great, healthy snack!

Made these for my dad on Father's Day, he's a oatmeal cookie junkie. He liked them a lot, as did the rest of my family. I followed what the reviews said by adding 1 more whole banana to the recipe. I omitted the gloves and used a tad bit more cinnamon. Instead of walnuts I used almonds. Cookies came out tasty and chewy. WARNING, they don't expand at all so make sure you press the cookies down to the exact size you'd like them to end up as. I'm used to cookies expanding, so this was quite a shocker for me. They weren't very visually appealing I might add, not your typical-looking cookie. But what it lacked in looks it made up in flavor! Great recipe, will use again!

I thought that these cookies turned out good.  I liked the flavour, but not so much the texture.  Even making them very small and baking for up to 15min they still came out seeming undercooked: very wet (beyond moist) and a little mushy.  However, people at worked really liked them and said they didn't mind the texture. I used butter instead of shortening(maybe that affected the texture?), left out the cloves, added chocolate chips, and used roasted almonds instead of walnuts.

These are delicious oatmeal cookies.  As another reviewer suggested, I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup AP, added a tiny bit more soda, and omitted the cloves.  Oh yeah, I also used 1 stick of real butter and 1/4 cup Crisco.  Mine, I thought, were actually too puffy and didn't spread.  The second pan I flattened slightly before putting in the oven and they turned out fine.  Nice brown sugar, banana, nut flavor.

I'm always looking for a way to use up all the overripe bananas and we loved this recipe.  I did make a couple of changes though--I replaced the white flour with freshly ground whole wheat pastry flour and instead of using shortening, I used coconut oil.  Wonderful!! and healthy for my family, too!

A good cookie. I used 1 cup of butter instead of shortening. The recipe states to use 1/2 cup (1 banana), and that is a perfect amount to use.

This recipe was great in general but the one thing I would change is the shortening, you could really taste it in the cookies so  you might want to think about either cutting down on the amount used or just use butter instead for a better taste.

I LOVED these cookies.  Wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  Lois has taken my favorite cookie and added my favorite fruit.  I am sometimes leery of baking with bananas, especially cookies, because they can sometimes come out too soft or the banana flavor is too overwhelming.  Not these - these were perfect.  Just a hint of banana and just a hint of walnuts.  I will make these again!  Thanks, Lois!  (I needed a full 10 mins. to bake these and they did not spread at all.  I used a mini ice-cream scoop.

very good cookie.....I made them the way they were, and my 3 yr old loved them. They are a good change to the normal oatmeal cookie. I made them on parchment paper and cooked them for 12 minutes. Next time I might try the white choc. chips in them, as others have suggested. Will definitly make again.

Very good cookie.  I'm glad they don't flatten as others have said, it makes it taste more like banana bread.  I left out the cloves and added chocolate chips to half the batter for the chocolate lovers in our house.

These cookies were okay, but nothing spectacular. I guess after reading the reviews, I expected more. I don't know if I did something wrong, but these cookies were ugly and didn't spread out like i thought they would.

I always read the reviews before I select a recipe to try. I sometimes modify it based on the reviewers suggestions. I kept everything the same in this except the walnuts. I don’t like walnuts and didn’t have any other nuts in the house so used skor toffee pieces.   The reviewer that commented that they needed something to rise _ I disagree, mine were light and fluffy, maybe they stirred too much. I found I needed a bit more than 10 minutes to cook though. I thought three cups of oatmeal was a lot, but they are nice . I didn’t grease my cookie sheets, I used silicon baking mat on my cookie sheet.  I tried these since I only had two little bananas that were too ripe and most other recipes I found called for a whole cup. I didn’t measure out my banana, it might have been more than a half cup.  Will make these again

I didn't have shortening and wanted to add peanut butter, so I used a 1/2 cup salted butter and somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 cup (didn't measure) peanut butter. Removed the nuts and substituted cloves for ground ginger - so frickin' good! I will definitely be making this again.
The cookie is soft and fluffy, not like a muffin fluffy but a little fluffier than your average cookie. I loved that when eating it I couldn't pinpoint 1 flavor, if I hadn't made it myself I wouldn't know it had banana and I could barely taste the peanut butter, they all just mixed together into awesome deliciousness. 
these are great breakfast cookies, would be so delicious with dried grapes, cranberries and apricot. Made them for my husband to eat on his way to work since he never remembers to eat breakfast.
note: Had to bake it between 15 and 20 mins in my oven.

These are the best banana oatmeal cookie I have ever made and, at 63-years of age, I have made a lot of cookies. I did substitute coconut oil for the shortening (didn't have any) and added about a cup of raisins (soaked them in warm water for about 10 minutes and then drained off excess liquid). This recipe is on the top of my cookie recipe list. Thanks for sharing.

Made it exactly as written and they taste like banana bread.  Salvaged the batch by making waffles with the dough after the first batch...killer!

Though I tweeked this a litte bit these cookies came out like minibite size banana breads. I used butter instead of shortening, three ripe bananna and dates instead of nuts. Since my batter was a tad wet I baked at 375 for 10 mins. Yummy!

These are yummy!  I used a total of 3 bananas (recipe is about 2), 1/4 cup more oats and a bag of white chocolate chips.  A hit because they aren't cakey.

Quite good.  I had stacks of bananas on hand so made these plus a banana cake and banana choc dessert from this site as well to use them up.  They seem to freeze well which is what I was looking for.  I didn't have the cloves on hand so left them out.

I am not a big banana fan, but with that being said they were very good. I thought they were a bit too soft after 12 minutes in the oven, but they firmed up a bit by the second day so they were perfect cookie consistency. I will make these again for the banana lovers.

When you  take these out of the oven the are very soft, let them cool they will firm up. If you dont like cloves just omit. I like them but my family prefers them with out it. Very good.

Super Tasty!  I did make a few changes: subed oat flour, did not add cloves, used only 1/2cup butter and 1cup flaxmeal, only 3/4 cup sugar, I used 4 super ripe bananas and added 1 cup white chocolate chips.  They were baked last night as I was getting the kids ready for bed.  They were all gone this morning!  I have already bought more bananas today to make these again for xmas gifts.  Mine did not spread at all, possbily due to my changes.  Next time I think I will use only 1/2 cup sugar since the bananas are sweet alone and the chips add a lot of flavor too.

Yes, a bit cakey, but who cares! These were awesome! I just realized that I actually added a whole cup of bananas... Shortening weirds me out, so I used butter instead. I also put a cup of chocolate chips instead of the walnuts. I am mailing them, so I'm a little worried about how they'll hold up... fingers crossed!

I really had to tweak this recipe to get it to where I thought it would be good.  I used only 1/2C shortening (next time I'll use butter but I was out) and used a little extra mashed banana instead.  I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4C and used a 50/50 blend of w.w. flour and white. I substituted 1/2C of chocolate chips instead of walnuts.  I think using half rolled oats and 1/2 quick cooking oats would be a better texture as they are really chewy.  Finally, they need AT LEAST 10 minutes if not 12-13 minutes of cooking time.  Mine were a bit undone at 9 minutes.

These cookies are great! I used light butter instead of shortening and splenda instead of sugar. I did't have cloves and used nutmeg. I would use less butter next time. They do not spread.

These were ok...not the greatest, but they were very moist and soft.  My husband did not like them, but my toddler did.  I added chocolate chips to half the batch and they gave them a little more flavor.

THese taste so much like my Grandma's banana bread.  I used a little more banana and I omitted the cloves.  I also just pressed the batter into a jellyroll pan and cut them in squares just to save a little time.

Wow! These cookies are really great. It took mine 15 minutes to cook, because I used a tablespoon cookie-dough scooper to drop them. Overall, GREAT cookies! My family loved them.

Incredible!  My boyfriend is quite the critic when it comes to dessert, he wants eveything plain and simple. He's asking for the second batch! I only found a problem in the cooking time, it took the spoonful drops 13-15 minutes to cook.

added peanut butter instead of the walnuts and because of that needed to add some baking time, the result was a wonderful flavor!

The cookies have a lot of texture but that is the only distinguishing feature. I followed the recipe as written because I always try to give the original a fair try but they are a waste of product and time. One would think they would have flavor but they do not. None.

Very good cookies . I used 3 bananas because I don't know what a banana is in cups but figures 3 would be fine. Also 1 1/2 cup of flour and a tsp of baking soda cause it seemed wet. Made about 40 cookies by the tbsp full.

I wanted these to be more of a breakfast bar, so I made this with a few changes.  I used 3 bananas for moisture, and 2 1/2 c. of oatmeal.  I used half brown sugar and half splenda.  I used 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, a scant 1/2 c. of coconut flour and scant 1/2 c. of wheat germ, (all 3 for added protein), and I increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp, and included 1 tsp of nutmeg. The last time I made it I added 3/4 cup of blueberries. I lightly pressed batter into a 9 x 13" glass pan, and then pressed the blueberries into the top, baking it for 25 min @350 degrees. They kept well without being refrigerated, and were a hit.

great taste! i used butter though instead of shortening and left out cloves and milk choco chips instead of walnuts. So I technically butchered the recipe.  cookies turned out a bit crumbly probably due to my inability to follow precise directions lol. thank you!

I went off another review and took a couple things they did and the cookies were very good.  1) substituted 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat flour.  2) added a cup of banana instead of 1/2    3) added extra tsp of cinnamon   4) used just a dash of cloves  5) used 3/4 tsp of baking soda.  I think next time I might add raisins!

This cookie turned out great when I added 3 Tbs of PB2 and 1/2 cup of mini semi sweet chocolate chips. Reminded me of when I used to make peanut butter and banana sandwiches.  Great cookie with added protein and flavor! And I baked them 12 minutes to make them a little browner and firmer.

Had way too many ripe bananas and was looking for something other than banana bread. I liked this cookie recipe because the ingredients are simple and easily tweaked to make them pretty healthy.  I just now finished my first batch and they turned out perfectly.  The  changes I made were simple:: instead of shortening I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 coconut oil (solid), used two large, very ripe bananas, added 1 additional egg white , raisins, left out the walnuts and  the only spice i added was a sprinkling of cinnamon.  They tasted more like an oatmeal cookie with a hint of banana - exactly what I was hoping for!

With 4.5 stars, I thought this recipe would be a slam dunk. But it wasn't. The only changes I made were butter instead of shortening, and omitted the cloves. These were not sweet enough, and kind of overly oat-y. Too much roughage to chew. I think it would take more than a few tweaks to get this recipe to be 5-star worthy. :o(

I love love loved! These cookies... The only thing different I did was add 3/4 teaspoon of baking soda for a little "relies" and then I added an entire banana, other than!!! Superb! My son and hubby simply can't get enough of them...! Thanks for sharing!

These turned out really well, but I made a few tweaks.  I substituted the 3/4 c shortening for 3/4 c unsweetened applesauce, used two bananas (about 1 c), used whole wheat flour instead of white, and added pumpkin pie spice as recommended.  I omitted the walnuts and cloves since I didn't have any at hand.  I was a bit worried about how the changes would work, but it's actually very good.  They do not spread as much and are more rounded.  I probably could have pressed them out a bit.  Definitely worth trying again!

The cookies were alright, I took them into work for my co-workers to try and they all thought they were weird and didn't like them. I think I'll just stick to making banana bread or muffins and adding chocolate chips to them instead, I didn't really care for the oatmeal in these cookies otherwise I thought they were ok.

Made as directed. We liked the spiciness of the clove and cinnamon. Will try pumpkin spice next time just to see if it changes at all. Another favorite spice I like to use with banana breads/cookies is cardamom. If you want an extra kick add about 1/4 tsp. of cardamom and try brandy extract instead of vanilla. As for cookie texture--it didn't flatten out at all. We pulled the sheets at 10 minutes, flattened each cookie and baked an extra 2-3 minutes. They came out a bit soft, but they firmed up after 10 minutes of cooling. Good way to enjoy your oats!

Love them!  I went with butter instead of shortening, more cinnamon, and whole wheat flour.  Wonderful and healthy for a cookie.  Sure to be a favorite around here.

This is a pretty good base cookie.  I doubled the banana (and added some banana essence) and also added in an extra amount of oatmeal (probably another cup) to compensate for that addition.  I also added in coconut - just a personal preference.  I did make the cookies very small and really flattened them out to get the texture I wanted.  I didn't increase the nut amount, and now wish I had.  It's a good substitute for oatmeal 'on the go' if you're in a pinch for breakfast in the car.

Great new way to make oatmeal cookies!!!  I had 2 small banana's on hand and didn't want to waste them.  Used both and it gave a wonderful banana flavor! I followed the recipe as stated, but cooked them for about 2 minutes longer.   I'll definitely be making these again!

I made this for my preschool and toddler Moppets--hard to find healthier portable snacks for them!  I added 1/2 cup chopped dates and 1/2 cup butterscotch chips to the mix.  The kids really liked them (so did I!).

The thing I like about these cookies is that they aren't cakey and have a good crunch on the outside, while being moist inside.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didnt use the cloves, I used the pumpkin pie spice like someone else mentioned.  I also had no walnuts, so I used white choc chips.  Be sure to flatten these out a little if you dont like the round, puffy cookie.

These taste great, but they are very cake-like in texture and don't have the chewiness of a cookie.

As I have to watch my diet closely, this recipe needed some changes for me.  I used organic applesauce in place of shortening.  Per one of the reviews I omitted the clove, added 1/4 cup organic oatmeal and used 1/2 cup organic AP flour and 1/2 cup organic whole wheat (in place of the 1 cup flour), 1 teaspoon baking soda.  The cooking time was 15 minutes (Its Houston, sea-level, humidity, etc).  The cookies came out great.  Thank you for the recipe.

Good banana flavor.  Slight nut taste.  Can't really taste the cinnamon.  Good texture, even after being out of the oven for a few hours.

The cookies turned out really tasty and all of my friends raved about them when I brought them straight out of the oven to happy hour.  It was a great way to use up my overripe bananas.  I did make some of the slight changes suggested by one reviewer; 2 tspn of cinnamon instead of the ground cloves, 2 ripe bananas instead of 1/2 cup (1 banana) and I also sprinkled the tops of each cookie with sugar to sweeten them slightly.  Turned out great!

I doubled the recipe and used 3 bananas and margarine instead of crisco. I also added coconut and chocolate chips. I don't always measure but I would say maybe 1 cup of coconuts and 2/3 of a bag of chocolate chips. They came out super moist. My office is raving about them today and they are super moist. Definately going to be a new favorite.

We love these!!! Wow! I did follow the addtions as above. They were so moist. Because I have young children I replaced walnuts for raisins. I added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract for additional flavor and did use butter shortening  instead of regular. Will make these again!

My daughter loves bananas and asked me to try and find a banana cookie recipe to add to our Christmas tray. I used two whole bananas and added cinnamon chips to the dough. I'm glad I chose this recipe because they turned out even better than I had anticipated. Thanks Lois and Happy Holidays!

I was hoping for more of a banana taste to these cookies.  They were just ok for me, but everyone else thought they were great.  They had a very cakey texture and only took 10 mins to bake.  So take others advice and watch them.

This cookie is pretty good. Not my favorite, but the banana flavor was a nice change.  They are a little more cakey than I expected. I omitted the walnuts and instead of cinnamon and cloves I used pumpkin spice.

These did not spread, so I used a fork to push them down.  After they were cooled I sprinkled powdered sugar over the top.

I added 4 oz of mini chocolate chips and used margerine because I was out of shortening.  These were great cookies, held their shape, didn't spread out, chewy, subtle spicyness and bananay flavor.  Will make again, family liked them.  Another way to use up those ucky bananas!

My 3-in-September-2K daughter and I made this for Daddy.  But, we only had one banana. She wanted the other "squishy one" the night before.  We added about 1/2 C crunchy peanutbutter to make up the difference.  We think next time we'll try for the FULL amount of Banana and even more peanutbutter.  This recipe mixes VERY WELL with little fingers!!!
