This is the second time I have made this recipe.  I make it exactly as stated and it comes out great!!  I have 8 children ranging from 1-16 and they ALL love it!! Now that's an accomplishment!!  It is easy to cook and goes great with a simple potato or green bean casserole.  I trimmed my bacon just slightly this time to decrease some of the fat and couldn't tell a difference!

I was asked to bring a vegetable for Christmas dinner--Boring!  But when I brought this brightly colored, flavorful corn, everyone raved and asked for the recipe--Fun!

To prevent this from being so greasy, i cooked the bacon separately and crumbled and tossed together at end. All the ingredients came together nicely. Nice side dish.

My bacon was pretty 'fatty' so I drained quite a bit of the grease and was still too greasy for us.  Think I will try this again, drain all the grease, add a little butter to the grease 'coating' in the pan and I also think this could use some garlic.

I couldn't even imagine putting the corn into all of that bacon grease so I drained most of it off and was still left with a nicely bacon flavored side. Thanks Michele!

This was good if you like greasy corn. I did give it two stars because 1)It smelled good and 2)It looked really yummy...nice and colorfull.  It tasted like bland greasy corn though.  If I ever attempt to make this again, I will definatly drain the bacon grease and add some kind of spice.  It was blah

I've had numerous people ask for this recipe. It's unbelievably simple & so great. I used a center cut bacon to reduce the calories a bit & drained some of the fat. I have used green pepper as well as a mix of yellow/red/orange peppers, both are great!

I know I shouldn't rate 5 stars if I tweak it, but it was great. Didn't use but 6 slices of bacon, quarter cup of chopped peppers and no onion Added 1 T of flour and half a cup of milk, quarter cup of sugar and a couple of T of butter.

This was a great change for a side dish.  I used turkey bacon, which helped cut back on the grease.

This was a wonderful side dish to barbecued chicken. Easy to fix and very tasty too. I used precooked bacon and only 4 strips as it is all I had. I only had a quarter of a green pepper and a bit less than that of onion so that is what I used. I added a couple of tablespoons of butter to make up for the bacon I didn't have. A good pinch of kosher salt and some fresh ground black pepper and this was delicious enough to get a comment from my husband. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, I'll be using this again Michelle.

Made this for a birthday dinner at my house. I chopped up 1/2 package of raw bacon and fried it first. Squeezed the bacon bits in a paper towel and wiped out the frying pan since I'm not a big fan of bacon grease. Added a little butter and sauted the onion then added 1/2 red bell pepper. Used 12 oz of frozen and 1 canned corn, drained. Added a few shakes of garlic salt. It looked and smelled great, but the taste was a little bland, like it was missing something, but not sure what.

I made this exactly as written and it turned out Delicious!!!  The entire family liked it...It's high in fat/calories so I probably won't make it weekly but great for a cookout.  I also took the left overs and put it in my Chicken Tortilla Soup the next day.  YUMMY!

My mom had this recipe in her files since 1950!  We only make it on Halloween and Heaven forbid if I forget it!  Serve it with a maple corn bread for a really filling meal, no need for more meat but a salad may be nice.

Tasty, but a little heavy for my preference. I think  next time I'd try draining the bacon grease as others have suggested. Also didn't turn out as "fried" as I thought it would be.

Well, I actually didn't get to try any of it.  I made it for the family for Thanksgiving this year.  I have very picky kids (refuse to even look at veggies most of the time).  But...the kids like corn, and they devour bacon...so, why not?  I used 1-lb smoked bacon and 1 32-oz bag of frozen corn.  No other veggies added.  It all cooked together very nice, but was a bit oily.  Next time, I might drain off 1/4 or 1/2 of the bacon fat.  When the corn had cooked, I added a little bit of salt, a sprinkle of pepper, and to the table we go.  My son ate almost the entire pan himself!  I guess it was a hit!

Yum! I'll be taking this to the next family dinner. I've been looking for something different. Everybody gave it a thumbs up, but hubby did say it was odd to eat corn but not taste corn. I think next time I won't use as much bacon. It does overpower just a bit. The smells together while cooking were fantastic and definitely a change of pace. Thanks.

I followed the basic recipe but having read and considered the reviews regarding the grease, after I fried the bacon, I removed it from the skillet and let it drain on a paper towel.  I added the veggies to the (remaining) grease in the skillet and sauted them until they were soft; I subsequently removed them from the skillet to drain on a (separate) paper towel.  These options actually left very little grease in the hot skillet to which I added the frozen corn.  After it was heated through, I stirred in the onions, green peppers and bacon.  I happened to have pappadew peppers in the fridge, so I chopped about a 1/2 cup and stirred them in...Delicious!

I liked this, but with some changes. I took other suggestions. I removed the cooked bacon and drained and reserved the bacon fat. I cooked the green pepper and onion in 1 tbs of the fat. When the veggies were tender I add the corn and one more tbsp of bacon fat. I added salt and pepper and a small amount of red pepper flakes. The bacon was added back into pan at the very end. I brought this to a potluck dinner and everyone gobbled it up, including the kids.

Followed the recipe precisely except for using canned corn (drained) and I removed all but about a Tbsp of the remaining bacon grease. Turned out Delicious! Kids and the Hub loved it!

My boyfriend literally put down his fork and called his mama because he thought it was THAT good.  He is a good 'ol Southern boy, who has a staple diet of steak, potatoes and cornbread.  He has told me in no uncertain term that this recipe gets put into regular rotation!  I agree that there is way too much bacon grease.  My better-half doesn't want me to change a thing, but I may cut back on the grease a smidge.  (Seriously, I've never seen him so exited about a side dish.)

Cooked tis for tea tonight along with baked potatoes as suggested in previous reviews and it was just so yummy! Loved by kids and adults alike I used bacon lardons (streaky) and red/orange peppers as my kids don't like green and it was perfect! Not too greasy at all, but they may have been the bacon I used! Next time I will try mixing it into cooked pasta for an easy pasta dish! Thank you for a great dish that serves plenty at minimal cost!

Really yummy!  I made a few changes however to suit my family's taste buds:I used applewood smoked bacon insted & drained the fat.  I also used 1/2 green bell pepper & 1/2 red pepper & also added a pinch of crushed red pepper as well.  Absolutely added to the rotation!

This was really good. I never would've thought to 'fry' corn! There's only 2 of us so the recipe was cut in half and we still have leftovers. I did, however, drain off at least 1/2 of the grease. And, it was still tasty.

I enjoyed this!  I had some fresh corn that needed to be used. I steamed two ears of corn in the microwave and used about half (only one serving) for this recipe. For the bacon, I had some bacon grease in the fridge so I melted a small amount of that and added some frozen multi-colored peppers and onions, and after a few min, added the corn for another min or so. I actually cooked bacon yesterday and crumbled some of that into the mixture. Does need the salt/pepper.  I liked this different and delicious way to prepare corn. I cut a few corners, but it still came out very good! I had it with Easy Baked Fish with Lemon from this site. Thanks for the recipe, Michelle!

My friends held a potluck Thanksgiving and I was assigned corn as the dish to prepare and bring. As soon as I saw this recipe I knew this would be the one. Four years of friendsgiving in a row and everyone requests I make and bring this. Best corn dish ever!

I have made it twice,  the first time I followed the recipe and it turned out delicious,  the second time I  cut my onion and bell pepper into real small pieces so not to overwhelm the flavor and I decreased the amount,  my bacon I only used 3 slices and cut them into small pieces and I added some cajun seasoning.  This is now a family favorite.  Great recipe.

I love this.  My mom made a variation,  and I made it one time, and my wife went crazy.  She always asks, "are you making THE corn?" I didn't add bacon, but I would take the corn, red and green bell pepper, and fry it in butter, until the corn crisps a little.  Then, I'd sprinkle in chili powder and cumin to taste.

I love it. I meal prep my meals so I can use the other servings as my lunch or dinner the following days and to spice up yesterday I put the meal in a tortilla and made a burrito. A little messy with so much corn but I liked it. Planning to try and add more stuff to mix it up next go around.
As a slightly healthy alternative I used turkey bacon. If you choose to do this method too, I recommend cooking it an extra couple of minutes so that it is thoroughly cooked.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  It was nothing special.  I doubled the recipe because we had a big gathering.  Reading some of the reviews, I did first drain all the bacon fat before adding all the veggies in, then I added it back in as needed. Unfortunately it was not a big hit, I brought home most of it.  Good thing I like corn.

I do not think it is fair to change a recipe and then rate it, so this review is based on following the directions with no alterations. Some people say it tasted like grease, I disagree. Perhaps cheaper bacon was purchased, IDK. Great bacon flavor but it was a tad bit bland, the reason for 4 stars. I would have given 4.5 if possible.

I have been looking for a good Fried Corn recipe for some time, I tried this one and loved it. This was so nostalgic for me. It took me back to my dad's cooking which I miss so much. Thanks for putting this out there !

Super easy to make and delicious! I drained most of the grease and added a bit of butter because it would have been way too greasy if I had left all of it. I used red and green pepper as well and it makes it more colorful!

I love fresh corn anyway I can get it. This one I like better with sweet red peppers in place of green. I have also added a bit of leftover quinoa for variety. This can also be done with a spicy pepper. I like mild poblano so or a bit of jalopeno and a sprinkling of jack cheese.

Second time I have made this and it is fantastic! Easy to make and always a crowd pleaser. The only change I made was I used red bell peppers instead of green because I don't like green, and it came out great! The bacon flavor with the other ingredients is just so tasty! Will be making this again!

This was so easy to make.  The only think I did was to drain some of grease after cooking the bacon.  Everyone loved it.  Had no leftovers.

Big hit at family Easter dinner. It was pretty good as written, but I wanted a little more oomph and interest for today, so I added about a TBSP of sour cream, 4 TBSP salsa, few dashes tabasco, and dash of Apple Cider Vinegar. Really good.

This was very good!  However, I did drain off some of the bacon grease.  The combination of salty bacon and sweet corn is wonderful.  I used red bell pepper and also included some chopped zucchini because it was the only way to include a vegetable that I love and still have my husband eat it.  Will definitely make this repeatedly.

THIS MADE A NICE SIDE DISH! I DID USE FRESH CORN AND ONLY USED HALF THE BACON THE RECIPE CALLED FOR.
