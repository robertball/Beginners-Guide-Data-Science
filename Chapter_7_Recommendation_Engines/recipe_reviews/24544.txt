Very yummy! I did use a  full pound of extra thick bacon, and added a tablespoon or so of milk to the very thick dressing (light mayo worked great).  One note about the croutons - the amounts listed for salt and pepper were very heavy even though I doubled the bread - start at about 1/3 of the amount listed and go from there.  FYI, these are 4 VERY LARGE servings!! For typical side salad servings, it would be closer to 8-10.  Such a great salad & it does taste just like a BLT. It even kept well in the fridge overnight, to my delight!

I have always used this recipe for the dressing itself and don't find it necessary to change a thing. The bacon drippings provide a nice, rich flavor. Use a light hand when dressing your greens, and because this is a heavier dressing, it works perfectly with the Romaine lettuce called for.

Yummy! I didn't have any fresh basil on hand but still turned out well and my advice to future cooks is to let the bread cool before tossing in salad or else it all turns mushy and not so appealing.  Overall, very good and will make again!

OMG!  What an incredible salad!  The dressing was awesome and just about anything that contains bacon my husband is all over it.  This was no exception.  The only thing I added to take it over the top was some sliced avacado and swiss cheese - YUM!

Don't know about the reviewer who didn't like the Avocado - unless I read it wrong, Avocado isn't called for in this recipe.  Anyway, I taste tested the dressing before and after adding the basil.  Even though I'm a huge basil fan, I think I liked the dressing better without it.  Since basil is not a traditional BLT ingredient, I'll omit it next time.  Also, we usually don't have croutons on our salad, so I decided to add the salt, and pepper to the prepared dressing.  The whole tsp of pepper was great, but the tsp of salt was too much in combination with the bacon, which is already fairly salty - I added more mayo and some milk to compensate.  Next time I'll add the salt to taste.  Please note my rating of 4 stars was not because of the revisions I made to this recipe, but because I thought the dressing, prepared as directed, tasted better without the basil.

Great! But use fat-free plain yoghurt instead of mayo for a healthier salad.

Was the hit of a picnic.  I am in England and the English love BLTs and they thought the salad was a very clever picnic idea!  I just packed the croutons and dressing separately then mixed them all together once the picnic started.

This is a wonderful salad with something for everyone!  I took it to a pot-luck last night and it was a huge hit.  I used red and yellow tomato wedges, pepper bacon (oh yaaa), and added cubed avocado.
I prepared the dressing in the blender, using a whole package of basil, it was cool, creamy, and delicious.  Fabulous!

Good Salad, Kimber. However, the dressing was a little too pungent for us. Fortunately it was tasted before I dressed the salad. A teapoon of sugar and a little garlic powder helped out. Thanks for sharing!

My sister-in-law was making this and had no fresh basil, so instead used pesto.   I think it was such a hit with the improvisation, I will also make it that way. At a table of 7, the 5 star rating was unanimous.

Made this as directed with the exception of using the full amount of fresh basil-which I cut down. Used grape tomatoes and this turned out really well. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  The croutons take quite awhile to brown, but are well worth the wait....they make the salad.  Try cubing the bread with a pizza cutter to speed up preparation.
Thanks for sharing.  :)

This salad tasted really good...however, don't add the dressing until right before you eat it. Otherwise it becomes too soggy. I loved the salad dressing though...unlike anything I have ever tasted.

Delicious!  I used reduced calorie mayo and added a pinch of salt and pepper to the dressing to tone down the tanginess just a bit.  The dressing is a bit thick but if you toss it all together in a large bowl before serving it gets distributed fairly evenly.  Very refreshing and tasted just like a BLT!  Thanks Kimber!

I've made this numerous times per my family's request.  The first time I made it exactly as written and it was good.  To adjust for our tastes I double the dressing and instead of making "homemade" croutons, I just add a half a package of Texas Toast herb croutons.  Comes out wonderfully!  It seems strange to add the bacon drippings to the mayo but that is the key to the whole dressing.  I have also made with fresh basil as well as with dried.  This is #1 in my cold salad rotation!

This salad was definitely different.  I think next time I'll make the dressing a few hours ahead of time so it has time to incorporate the flavor of the basil.  I added finely chopped pieces to the salad so we could taste it more.  I also added avocados per other reviews and then also added sunflower seeds and shredded mozzarella cheese.  I will be making this again!

For the record my husband really didn't like this.  I thought it was great, although I will try with regular vinegar as I found the red wine vinegar to be overpowering.  Time saver tip:  While you are making the salad, bake the croutons in the oven at 350 toss in a bowl with oil and spices before baking, this will safe atleast 5-10 minutes.  I added chicken which was great.

A great salad and a real "keeper" recipe!  I didn't find that 15 minutes prep time seemed excessive.  The use of 2 skillets and a bowl didn't seem to make the kitchen messy enough for more than minimum clean-up time.

This salad was great without reserving bacon drippings for the dressing (I used pre-cooked slices to save time and mess).  Also, I have to say as a die-hard Miracle Whip fan, that nothing makes a salad like Miracle Whip...I figure that's why some of the 1-2 star reviews who used mayonnaise stated that the dressing was "too bland".  Not with Miracle Whip! (Just so everyone knows, I don't work for the company).

This salad really comes together with home-made croutons, so put it out of your mind that you're going to get the real BLT taste with store-bought.  Not at all.  Try this recipe and you'll agree that it tastes like an authentic BLT if you put an extra two minutes' effort into the croutons (I used regular texas bread because I didn't have the french stuff, by the way).

Other than the miracle whip and the pre-cooked bacon and the texas bread, the only substitution I made was balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  MMMMM.  Smooth, flavourful, tangy dressing, and my boyfriend agreed.  I will definately make this again...perhaps not for a crowd, because the romaine does wilt fast, but I'm sure I can impress a couple of my friends in the near future this BBQ season.

Go for it! It's easy! You won't be disappointed.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great Salad!  The fresh basil in the dressing gives the salad a great taste.  Someone commented that the dressing was too thick, so I thinned mine with about 2 tablespoons of buttermilk. It was very good, but next time I think I will leave as is.  Try topping salad with sliced grilled chicken and sprinkle with shredded parmesan cheese for a meal!!

The dressing is very good, but you can only eat one forkful, otherwise you will die from the mayo and bacon grease used for the dressing. Its a once a year recipe.

I made this recipe at a cooking party with a few friends.  We absolutely loved it.  We all agreed that it tasted like a real BLT sandwich.  I did add about 1 tbsp of sugar and 1 tsp of salt to the dressing as I thought it was a little too tangy.  I also agree with another reviewer that the lettuce does wilt very quickly.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Took this salad to a picnic... everyone raved about it!!  The only 2 things I modified were (1)balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar (the only thing on hand, but gave it a sweeter taste) and (2) fat free mayo for the regular mayo (tasted great and hey-- every little bit helps :)

I like this salad because it is very easy to prepare and is a light dinner.  The dressing needs work,I added milk and did not have basil and used pesto instead and it was great.  Also added pepper and a little garlic. I used much less bacon 4 strips and after tossing salad with dressing added hard boiled eggs.Kids loved it!

This was great. The temperature was 111 degrees yesterday, and the salad was dinner for 3 of us, and we could not eat it all. I will add avocado the next time, and possibly reduce the amount of bacon.

Terrific salad, exceptional dressing.  Go ahead and make the croutons--you won't be sorry.  Try this dressing on a BLT sandwich or tortilla roll-up--fantastic!

I made this for our Easter dinner, doubled the recipe except for the fresh basil, left it at the 1/4 cup and used garden fresh cherry tomatoes. I did add a couple teaspoons of sugar to the dressing after test tasting it, seemed a bit too tangy for me, also a few dashes of garlic powder. Our guest loved this salad and there were no leftovers. However I would caution to wait until right before serving to mix the dressing into the salad. I mixed it up a couple hours ahead and kept it in the refrigerator until serving and felt the romaine was soggy. It wasn't too hard to toss it up, so in the future I'll toss in the dressing right before serving.

I didn't have fresh basil so I used about a teaspoon and a half of dried. The bacon drippings in the dressing, MONEY. We fought over the leftovers. NOTE: I used olive oil mayonnaise and day old Dave's Killer Bread. I did not add but a pinch of salt.

Have have tried this recipes two times and it was excellent both times. I really like the homemade croutons!! The only change I made was I added 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt. I thought it was way too tangy with just the mayo and red wine vinegar. Otherwise---great recipe!!

This was very good...the dressing was FANTASTIC!  If you aren't a fresh basil lover, you'll definately want to lower the amount you put in.  I agree with others, the fresh croutons are a vital part of this salad.  My husband said this should be a "regular" menu item at our house!  Wonderful!

Everyone loved it...I used store bought croutons instead of making them as the recipe suggests- it is a somewhat time consuming recipe to make-but well worth it!  I would not put the croutons in until right before you're ready to serve--and this is one of those salads that cannot be "saved" for later or eaten later...the lettuce gets soggy along with the croutons.  All that said, the salad tastes GREAT and I would make it again!!

A good salad.  I served it as an entree with my homemade breadsticks and the sour cream apple pie listed on allrecipes top ten favorites.  The only change I made was to add some salt to the dressing.  Also, next time I will stick with my own crouton recipe.  Instead of first mixing the bread and spices and then pouring olive oil over it, I have found it is more effective to heat the olive oil in a pan until it starts smoking.  Quickly add the bread cubes and stir until they are covered evenly.  Then add salt, italian season, and pepper is desired.  Much more tasty!

Very yummy! I took this to a family reunion and everyone was impressed.  I thought the dressing needed to be toned down so I added more mayo and bacon drippings.  I also added milk to make the dressing thinner.

This was soooooo good!  Thank you, Kimber!  We will eat this a lot!  There is no way I would give this anything less because it was a "messy cleanup".  I agree the use of 2 skillets is not keeping me away from making this again and again.  We used thick sliced bacon from the butcher...The homemade croutons were a plus!  :)

I have brought this salad to picnics, pot lucks at work and barbecues at home and it is outrageously delish! I too, add more bacon, more like 2/3 of a pound and also use a bit more lettuce. So good, thanks for posting!

Delicious!!  Wonderful as a main dish or a side salad.  The basil mayo dressing topped it off great.  I did use Miracle Whip instead of mayo and it turned out fine.

Great recipe.  I added shredded mozzerella cheese and sliced avacado.  In the dressing, I also reduced the amount of vinegar by about half and added garlic powder and sugar as suggested in another rating.  I also used a spring mixture of lettuce...very pretty.

Ths was actually a pretty good salad, but it seemed like a lot of work for what you get out of it. The dressing was a bit bland -- i think it has potential, but I'd have to work on it.

Awesome Recipe... I didn't change a thing. If you have a magic bullet, it works great to make the dressing. Wanted to take leftovers for lunch the next day and it was as expected not as lively, so I thew it in a tortilla and it was amazing! Thanks!

the bread croutons in this recipe can be oven baked instead of frying with great results. Simply spray them with an olive oil spray(there are garic flavoured ones on the market)and bake in a moderate oven until golden brown. Otherwise a great recipe

the idea of this recipe is good, but I found the dressing to be disappointing. I would omit the bacon grease next time. Maybe add a little garlic.

I was actually looking for a way to spice up a regular BLT, so I just made the sauce to use as a spread on my sandwich.  It was fantastic!  I liked how tangy the red wine vinegar made the sauce.  The only change I made was that I didn't have fresh basil, so I put about 1 T dry, and it was perfect.

Using what you have on hand is great!  I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dry italian herbs.  I didn't use the oil either (tried to keep it lite/low fat).  I wish that I would have had buttermilk, but instead added about 2T of sour cream and maybe 4T of milk.  I also added about 2tsp of lemon juice, minced garlic, and some fresh ground black pepper.  WONDERFUL!  I would suggest using lean turkey bacon too.  Good recipe

Delicious!  I baked my croutons instead of frying them, added avocado to the salad and used just enough dressing to lightly coat the leaves (about 5-6 tablespoons). Thanks for a great recipe.

This salad is delicious! The taste is very close to a BLT. I think it would be great even without the basil if you don't have any around. My husband raved. The homemade croutons are crutial, although I think I'll use a little less salt and pepper next time.

Gave this one 4 stars because of the prep time and clean-up factor.  I say take the time to make the croutons.  Totally worth it.  The 'homemade' croutons and fresh basil makes the salad great!

YUM!  This got rave reviews at my house!  I have to admit I did not make the croutons, I am too lazy.  I almost doubled the bacon and I used chopped tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes.  I added avacado both times becouse I love it and someone else suggested it, it adds a yummy flavor.  I also added some garlic and lemon to the mayo and used white wine vinegar.  I have made this salad twice and both times it turned out great.  
**If you have more of the dressing left over, it makes an awesome replacement for regular mayo on a turkey, roastbeef, or chicken sandwich.  Add in some tomato, lettuce and avacado...delish!

Yummy!!  Both me and my husband had second helpings!  Very good if you like BLT's.  I did find it fairly time consuming to assemble and my kitchen was a mess afterwards! :)  However, I plan on making this again.

This is a delicious salad.  I made a few changes.  I added avocado, used a regular tomato cut in thin slices and quartered.  I also used turkey bacon and did not use the drippings in the dressing.  You don't need very much dressing so I used about 1/2 the may and upped the basil a bit.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This was great! Very easy and flavorful. Croutons were simple to make.  The scale of this recipe says serves 4 and I guess that could be true if you want it as a meal, but if you want a side dish, I'd scale it back.

I used low fat Mayo, and seeing I didn't have Basil, I used Pesto.  I also used 'veggie' bacon...WAY less fat!
I'll admit...I didn't make my own croutons, but even so it was SO yummy!!!!
I also added a bit of mozarella cheese!
This WILL be made a LOT at our house! It was our main meal, and totally filled me up! It makes lots of dressing though, so if there is only 2 of you, scale down!

I have made this twice as a side dish for formal dinner parties and everyone loved it! Several reviewers used store bought croutons, but my guests commented that the homemade croutons made the dish extra special, and they are very easy. You can save lots of time by buying bagged lettuce, and low-fat mayo works OK, too. This works much better tossed with the dressing before serving, rather than putting dressing on individual portions. Be sure to toss well, and you will have plenty of dressing.

This salad is THE BEST! I have made it twice now, the first time I added grilled chicken to make it a meal and the second time I made it just as the recipe said (except I did add 1 tsp. of sugar to the dressing) and took it to a barbeque.  Both times it went over BIG. In fact I'm making it again tonight for a family gathering.  This is the kind of salad that appeals to men as well as women, I have no hesitation recommending this recipe!

This recipe is awesome! I am on a low-carb diet so I didn't add the croutons. Although I will say that if I ever do add croutons, I will probably just buy some instead of making them myself. We added a little more bacon and cucumber slices that were quartered. At first it didn't look like enough dressing, but it was the perfect amount. I will probably make this recipe once a week.

I made this the other day for something different for my boyfriend and me (both salad lovers).

WOW! This is just soo amazingly good. The only thing I did different was I made my own mayo (as I always do for a dressing). And, yes, this is best eaten right after it is made because it does wilt fast. Am going to try adding some marinated grilled flank steak (thinly sliced) and eat it as a main course. I already know it's going to be good. Thank you for the great recipe!

I used vegetarian bacon and I loved it. There were no drippings for the dressing so I just chopped the non bacon up and add it in. 
Good and Easy.
My meat eating boyfriend loves this salad.

I enjoyed this recipe.  Although I probably won't make it for company(wilts fast) I will make it again for my family - especially on a hot summer day.  The croutons are something I will incorporate in more of my salads.

This was very easily quadrupled for a large family gathering. Everyone raved about it and were fighting to get seconds and thirds! I gave it a slight variation.... as my brother put it, "Good call on the grape tomatoes!"

This is my favorite salad recipe on this site! The homemade croutons are amazing. I don't mix them in the salad because they get a little too mushy for my taste. I just put them in a bowl next to the salad and let everyone add their croutons to the top. I also end up using more bacon because it's just so good!

This recipe is ALWAYS a hit when I make it...for friends, for family, for parties.  It is super easy, although it does take some time for a salad! Two hints:  1.) When making the croutons, use the excess drippings from the bacon (already in the pan) instead of canola oil.  2.)Use heirloom tomatoes or larger tomatoes (cut up in smaller sections) instead of cherry and add fresh mozzarella (cut into cubes).    It is simply heavenly! I think the next time I make it...I am going to add avocado! :)

liked the idea, and it may have turned out more to my liking if there were less pepper & salt in the recipe. next time i'll sub plain yogurt for sour cream, and lo-cal mayo for regular; it "feels" not very healthy to eat this salad.

My husband said give it a 10. Everyone loved this salad. I made dressing in food processor and added a clove of garlic and 1/8 cup basil and 1-2T milk to thin it out. Cooked bacon in oven on a cookie sheet, and crutons are a must in this salad. I may add all the basil next time. I was hesitant because of other reveiws but I loved the basil flavor.

Love, love, love this salad!  Instead of red wine vinegar, I used balsamic, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  The caloric/fat content is a bit scary for a salad... but definitely worth the splurge.  Thanks!

This salad was excellent!  The homemade croutons really are worth the effort.  And the dressing was outstanding - we will definitely be making this again!

As my name implies, I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I omitted the croutons,cooked less bacon,and added about 3 tbs of fresh basil pesto i'd made earlier instead of fresh basil, and some parmesan, but the resulting dressing was fantastic!  My husbands' only complaint was that it was a bit thick, but that could have been because I used pesto.  Yummy!  Better than the ceasar I would have made!

A Hit With The Family
I made this for the family on one of our late night summer meals and the kids really liked it.  Recipe turned out perfect.  My hubby even took some of what was leftover to work for his lunch.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

my husband raved about this!  even took the leftovers for work the next day, and he's not normally a salad type of guy for lunch.  The kids ate it too, and really enjoyed the crutons.  I thought the dressing was only OK, but everyone else seemed to really like it.

Yummy!  I liked it.  I wasn't sure about the croutons, but they turned out awesome!  My husband didn't like the dressing, so he ate it with balsamic vinagrette, but I thought the dressing made the salad.  Thanks!  This one is a keeper!

Was okay not the best salad.  I love BLT's and the taste did remind me of a BLT.  If you are not used to eating fresh herbs Basil was a little overpowering.....have no idea were some reviewers thought dressing was bland, maybe they skipped basil.  If made again I would scale back on fresh basil and also salt/pepper on croutons.

This salad was so good! It tasted just like the sandwich. The only thing I did differently was to use a frozen pre-made garlic bread, toasted and cut into cubes as the croutons. I put them on top of the salad after it was tossed so they wouldn't get soggy.

Absolutely AMAZING salad and dressing!  After I made the dressing, I tasted it on a piece of lettuce and thought the vinegar was a little too potent.  So I added a tsp. of salt and some garlic powder...definitely helped.  Thanks for a great homemade salad recipe! :)

For some reason, my croutons didn't come out right. They wouldn't cook without burning. So we ate a croutonless salad. But it was delicious.

Good recipe. I would recommend using more bacon and less french bread. The croutons seemed to dominate the salad, and there didn't seem to be enough bacon to compete with the other ingredients.

Very tasty, just like a BLT... only it sat a little heavy.  I tried 1 T of dried basil since I didn't have fresh on hand and was ok.  Does anyone know the correct conversion between fresh and dried herbs?

I swear it's like eating a BLT!  Delicious! I used half mayo and half miracle whip.  I also didn't add as much basil (my husband doesn't love basil as much as me).  I've made this recipe 4 times in 2 weeks.  It's great for get togethers, people were impressed!  Try it today.

Excellent recipe. I only made some very small changes; added a tiny bit of celery salt and lemon pepper to the dressing, which was just lovely. I also tossed some fresh shredded parm on top right before serving. Yummy!

I've made this wonderful salad many times, both with fresh basil and pesto. Everybody loves it, even those who aren't that fond of other salads.  I always use extra bacon.  Give it a try!!

I found that it smelled really tangy, and was a little skeptical about serving it without tasting it first, but it was great!! No changes here!

Loved this salad.  I will be using it often.  The homeade croutons really add something special.  I used BF reduced fat mayo to cut the fat some and it was great.  I highly recommend it.

Wow! This recipe is definitely a keeper. I served it for the first time last night with dinner with our friends. It was so good they had 3 or more salad bowls of it and wanted to skip dinner and just have the salad. It's that good! Don't miss this one. The recipe says it serves 4 but I'm sure it's a typo. 8 is more accurate. Thanks, Kimber

We loved this recipe and will be making it again and again.  The quick, creamy, tangy dressing and easy croutons made this recipe wonderful!  We used about 3/4 pound of bacon for added crunchiness.  Most of the recipe can be quickly made, but the bacon takes the longest.

I made this the first time for company.  Because of the high fat content, I won't make this on a regular basis.  But for company, a must!!  Everyone raved about it.  The whole salad disappeared before my eyes and I only got one small helping.  I used a whole pound of bacon and made extra croutons.

Everyone raved about this salad.  It was so easy to make.  I took it to a dinner at a friend's house.  It traveled great.  I waited until we were just about to eat before I added the crutons  and dressing.  I gave it a toss and set it on the table.  I made a double batch and there was only one serving left at the end of the meal (we were six adults for dinner).  Great salad!!!!!

I had little cherry tomatoes from Hubs’ garden, so I decided to try this recipe using those little gems!  I followed the recipe, but used my own homemade croutons.  I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the dressing is a bit too tangy from the red wine vinegar.  I thought it totally masked the basil flavor in the dressing.  Next time I may cut the vinegar back by about half and then add more to taste if I think it needs it.

This was a quick, easy and delicious recipe. I didn't have time to toast the bread so I used croutons instead -and just a half cup was fine.  I would make this again and again !

Made it just like the recipe and loved it. BLT's are one of my favorite sandwiches and this is superior in flavor and health, but only because there is less bread/starch. Will definitely make again!

I have now made this salad twice in the last week. First time was for a dinner party and it got rave reviews, second time for my kids and they said in a word "delicious!".  I did use a really good aged balsamic vinegar instead of wine vinegar and I added a 1/2 tsp. sugar and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder to the dressing. The homemade croutons make this salad, I found if the bread was a day old it made for easier cubing. I also sprinkled the bread with garlic powder in addition to the oil, salt and pepper.  I cut up the bacon prior to frying. Even with my few additions and changes I still believe this one deserves 5 stars!!

I tried this because BTL is a favorite. I did sub plain yogurt for the mayo and used dried basil. Skipped the bread, too. I really liked the dressing---it makes a basic salad with tomatoes and bacon really special. I've made this twice now. A keeper.

For the first time ever, I didn't change a thing as far as ingredients go, and the only instruction thing I did differently was that I toasted in the oven instead of over the stove (oh, and with olive oil instead of canole......I lied). Either way, this was FABULOUS!!! I'm not a big salad eater, especially as the main course, but my husband and I ate all of this in one sitting - literally. This is a do-over, and I'm guessing will be a hit a shower or luncheon.

Definitely needs more.  The dressing was just "okay" and the salad needed more ingredients...I would say to add cheese, hardboiled eggs, etc., but that pretty much makes it a regular salad and takes away the whole "BLT" part of it.

I love the use of Balsamic vinegar in the dressing. I did make a few changes, tho. I microwaved the bacon...just to get rid of excess fat and used Hellmann's Light mayonnaise. Instead of making up the croutons, I put the lettuce, tomatoes, bacon (and sliced dill pickles) into Pita bread and drizzled the dressing over the filling. I served them on a platter surrounded with melon (Cantelope, Honeydew  and Watermellon) slices. It was quite a hit with both the young and old.

This salad was tremendous!  I made it for Christmas and everyone loved it.  I didn't make the croutons because I ran out of time and used packaged ones, but the dressing makes it.  I will definately make this again!

I took this salad to a ladies luncheon and it was a hit! I did add 1 teaspoon sweet chili sauce for a little more spice to the dressing.

It did taste like a BLT, but it wasn't as light as I would have liked.  If I were to make it again I would add the basil leaves to the salad mix instead of shredding them and putting them in the dressing.

YUM! a new staple in our house. my BF LOVES this salad!

I did tweak it a bit. I used sourdough bread for the croutons and drizzled them with olive oil instead of canola. I stuck them in a 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes until browned.

I also used reduced-sodium bacon and low-fat mayo in an attempt to reduce the fat content. 

Otherwise - AWESOME!!!

If you closed your eyes while eating this recipe, you'd swear it was a great BLT sandwich. I didn't have mayo on hand, so I substituted Miracle Whip and it was OK, but next time I make this, I'll be sure to make sure I have mayo. Mayo is a little richer and would make it even better.

My husband and I did not like this at all. The vinegar in the dressing was way too strong. I tasted it before I put it on the salad and added sugar to it like others suggested but it still just wasn't good. The actual salad is good but I would definitely use a different dressing.

Pretty good salad...I especially liked the dressing recipe.  However, I made only half of the dressing and that was MORE than enough.  I used the amount suggested of cherry tomatoes, and Hubby thought that was alittle to many.  But overall...delicious,,,just not so much dressing!  left-overs get wilty fast, so eat what you make right away.

Not bad, but needs tweaking.  First of all, use the full amount of bacon drippings or else decrease the vinegar.  Otherwise the dressing is too sour.  Also, I thought it needed some additional things in it, so I added sugar snap peas, walnuts and avocado.  It would also have benefited from some cucumbers or something.  Very good idea though, and a great main-course salad!

This recipe turned out really well.  I didn't have red wine vinegar so used Seasoned Rice vinegar instead.  Also, I just used some leftover onion buns for the croutons.  I took it over to a potluck and got rave reviews.  I would definitely make this again!

This salad is very good.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I forgot to put the basil in.  I found that the red wine vinegar was to overpowering for the salad.  Next time I will make the dressing with rice vinegar.  Also,  I found that the croutons were very salty.  I would cut back the salt to ½ teaspoon as well as cutting back on the pepper.

This was pretty good.  If I make it again, I might try to use part plain yogurt as I don't totally love mayo.  I did use light mayo though, and not all of the bacon grease.

Tastes amazingly like a BLT.  The dressing is creamy and flavorful and would be delightful on most any green salad.  The croutons "make" the salad without the overpowering seasonings common to most purchased croutons.  For those worried about the high quantity of bacon, the salad could easily retain its identity when topped with only 6 ounces of bacon instead of 8 ounces.  I will prepare this recipe again and will find more uses for the dressing and croutons.

This is an amazing salad and the dressing is great i did not put bacon drippings in the dressing and it was still amazing (less fat).  The crutons are a must!! I will never buy store bought crutons again.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Delicious! I used romaine and spinach and toasted the bread in a toaster oven with no oil. I also added some cilantro to the dressing for that fresh taste. A great contrast for any spicy dish. Thanks for sharing.

Great salad.  I didn't make the croutons, just bought some at the store then forgot to even use them.  They were not missed.  The dressing really makes this salad.  I made it for a BBQ & my friend said it was nice to have a green salad that was a bit different from the ordinary.  I will definitely make it again.

Yay! Good salad. I cut down on the basil and forgot to add the vinegar (oops). One thing I did add to the dressing is milk to thin it, and cucumber for substance. I pureed everything in the food processer, and it made a wonderful dressing!

It was really good and very different.  My husband liked the real bacon and the dressing.  We will definately do this one again.

This was a big hit with all the family!  I thinned the dressing with a bit of fresh lemon juice and added more bacon. I also mixed iceburg lettuce with the romaine at the urging of my grandsons.  I gave the recipe to my daughters so they can make it themselves.  Note: For my vegetarians, I left the bacon out and gave them the option of using the soy bacon bits.

WOW, was this ever good! We've had this about once a month since I first reviewed it. I'll often add avocado and alfalfa sprouts and some of the fabulous smoked cheese my hubby makes.

A BLT never tasted so good!  I really like the basil in the dressing.  For a milder vinegar flavor rice vinegar would be a good substitute, or 1T vinegar and 1T water.  Next time I will make sure I use pre-sliced French bread for the croutons - they will be much easier that way & the pieces will be more uniform.  The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because there was no subtance to it.  Next time I make it I will add some tuna, or chicken as suggested by some reviewers.  This is a definite keeper, especially for the dressing.

I have made this recipe several times for company and it has always been very good and recieved alot of complements. One note, I use sour dough bread last time I made it and the croutons were on the doughy side, a drier type of bread would probably be better. Also sometimes it's hard to find fresh basil locally, so I used freeze dried basil and it was just as good.

Update- this is still THE BEST salad recipe I have ever found. Thanks so much for the recipe. Great recipe!  This salad is hearty enough to be a meal in itself.  The dressing is fabulous-- a keeper for sure.

Delicious.  Using fresh basil really makes a difference, but the salad is also delicious without the 'special' dressing.  We made it 3x in a week, always with great 'reviews' from the family/friends.  You can't make this recipe just once!

This was really good and simple and easy to make -even the croutons (which I added garlic and a good dosing of olive oil to)!  I enjoyed the dressing very much and will definately make this again.

This was tasty!  Next time I'll cut back on the bacon because it made the salad seem sort of greasy.  I think I'll try using store-bought croutons, too, because it was rather time consuming to make my own.

It's a good thing I tasted this dressing before tossing the salad with it.  Not very good at all.  My husband did not like it either so I know it was not just me.  It was bland, no flavor.  We ended up using regular ranch dressing.

I started making this recipe last summer and was so pleased to re-discover it in my recipe binder.  Of course, garden-fresh tomatoes are the best -- any variety or a mixture works well.  I'm allergic to grains so I leave out the croutons, but my family loves them.  To make a main-dish salad, I add cubed, cooked chicken.  Thanks so much for loved addition to our family's meals.

My husband doesn't eat salad--ever.  But he begs for this one at least once a week. Excellent stuff. I use bagged romaine lettuce and it works out great.

This dressing is really tasty!  I served this as a main course for my husband and self so I cooked cubed chicken breast with the bacon and added to the salad.  Next time I make this I will use European or Red Leaf Lettuce instead of Iceburg.  The homemade croutons are worth the little extra work.  It truly makes it taset like a BLT sandwich.

A delicious, fast and filling recipe for hot summer evenings when you don't feel like cooking. Making your own "croutons" makes the difference. I often use this recipe when I have a lot of basil that I need to use up. It's popular every time I make it.

I am a BEGINNER cook with a hubby that is excellent in the kitchen. I have made this salad my specialty. It is SO very easy and tastes great. I have shared the recipe with others at work and keep making it over and over again. It's easy, tasty and makes for a great dish. 
I substitute white wine vinegar for the red because we always have that in our pantry and it tastes great.

Gosh was this great!  I could not find fresh basil, so used dried instead.  The croutons are wonderful, the cubed bread really shrunk upon toasting in the pan.  I am glad because after cubing the bread it seemed like ALOT.  I will make this again.  We had it as a main dish!

I've made this twice and adjusted the recipe. Straight off this is a 3 star on base recipe. Mayo+bacon drippings can't go wrong! But it's a bit lackluster without additions.

To the salad I add cucumber, onion, and shredded cheddar. (I have also added chicken!) To the dressing I add garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, fresh lemon juice, a Splenda packet, and everything bagel seasoning (which I use for all my salads).

So, great recipe to start and build on.

Sooooo delicious! Only thing I changed was I fried my croutons in the drained bacon pan.  I counted three times both my husband and I said how tastey it was between our mouthfuls. 
Had lots of dressing left, I imagine it will be good to bake some chicken in this week

Made this without any modifications and it is delicious. Very simple with a big punch of flavour. Will be making this for my daughter's grad party in June. Thank you!

Followed the recipe and it was Yummy, and there was none left at the potluck.  I could have made half the dressing.  We like lightly dressed salads. Will add avocados next time, 'cause i love them.

Very tasty! Loved the basil mayo dressing; it was easy to make, too. When I do this again, I will add a little honey to the dressing mixture, and for those who feel that a BLT is all about the "B", I'd go ahead and cook up the whole pound of bacon for the salad, especially if you are making this your main meal. My husband likes onion on his, so I added just a few thinly-sliced green onions, and my girls had the idea that a handful of shredded sharp cheddar on top would be great. Awesome recipe!

Only added avocados. This was delicious for a warm spring day! The dressing has a wonderful basil flavor that doesn’t overwhelm the salad but start with 1/2 the dressing and add more to suit your taste. Delightful

MY FAVORITE SALAD, BUT I ALSO ADD 1/2 CUP SHREDDED CHEDDAR CHEESE TO BOOST THE PROTEIN.  IT IS A WONDERFUL SALAD TO MAKE AND SHARE.  WHO DOESN'T LIKE A B.L.T, AFTER ALL?   I WILL BE MAKING THIS FOR THE NEXT MOTHER-DAUGHTER BANQUET AT THE CHURCH.  LOVE IT.  AND THE BEAUTY OF IT IS THAT YOU CAN ADD ANY THING YOU WANT .  PERFECT SIMPLE SALAD.

Excellent. Sauce was very, very nice. Added avocado, red onion & Pecorino Romano. And used Texas Toast croutons. Cut mayo in half. Several of these alterations were offered by other reviewers. Delightful Labor Day salad with Chardonnay and US Open tennis.

Very good salad that was easy to make while preparing dinner. I only used about two thirds of the dressing and no one asked for more. Will definitely make again.

This salad lives up to its name as it really tastes like a BLT. I couldn't get fresh basil so I used dried. I opted for balsamic instead of red wine vinegar. I skipped one step as I had a bag of butter garlic croutons made from Texas toast and they were perfect. I will definitely make this again.

I also added some milk to thin out the dressing. I added a little celery seed, avocado, grated cheddar, and other veggies to make the salad a hardy main dish for dinner.
My husband gave it the thumbs up.

Love the dressing. Sometimes I use a bistro mix of greens instead of the romaine. Tastes great either way. It's a fantastic recipe...thanks for sharing.

I loved the whole concept start to finish, and it was a pretty tasty dish, but there are some things I'll do differently next time.

I'd never made croutons before, but I will definitely keep making them, so much better than store bought!

The concept of the salad is great, but next time I'll probably save myself some time and by bags of the salad already prepared, and bacon bits that I'll heat up.  

The dressing was OK.  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't spectacular either.  I think I would have been just as good with ranch dressing as I was with this.  Plus it will save on clean up too.

I added avocado and sliced green onions to the salad.  For the dressing, I added a couple of dashes of A-1 Steak Sauce.  Gives it a little kick.  The salad is a hit each time I serve it!

This salad was the bomb! I accidentally used the bacon drippings on the croutons and had to scrape the bacon pan to get some drippings in the dressing, but the croutons were amazing with the bacon grease on them. So, next time I will split the drippings between the dressing and croutons on purpose! I thought this was perfect as written, really tastes like a BLT and I LOVE BLTs! Nice job.

Wow - that is all I can say.  The homemade croutons put this over the top.  The dressing is simple but great.  An awesome bonus of the dressing is it doesn't have to be refrigerated or made need time to chill.  You can just make it and use it - very nice!   Cutting the basil took a long time but then again, I'm not so good at chopping basil.  I ended up adding some dry basil just to help out and it was still great.  Thanks for the amazing recipe!

OMG, this was so good! Made this for dinner tonight and even my salad hating lovely hubby ate the whole bowl almost by himself. I live in germany and I used instead of bacon german Schwarzwälder Schinken. It tastes the same but it's not so greasy as bacon plus you just cannot find a good american bacon in a german store. For the dressing I used half Miracle whip half mayonaise and added some milk to make it a little more thinner. It came out perfect and I will say it with lovely hubbys words: when salad tastes like this, I will eat it every night!

I've got to admit that I'm a big BLT fan.  This salad was delicious.  I loved every bit of it.  Not the healthiest salad out there, but it accomplishes what it sets out to do.  Good stuff!

Delicious! I made it to exact specifications the first time using pre-cooked bacon pieces and baking the croutons. I also used low-fat mayo. the 2nd time I used half low-fat mayo and 1/2 fat free sour cream and it was just as good. My husband also liked it which was a surprise! What a nice change for a salad and it really does taste like a BLT - the Basil is a lovely addition.

My family loved this and everyone said it tasted just like a BLT sandwich. Makes a lot more than 4 servings if it's not the main course. We found it din't keep well. Thanks for the great recipe!

My hubby and I LOVE this salad. It's a nice change from traditional salads. We don't have it very often, because it's not very healthy, but we do indulge a few times in the summer when fresh garden tomatoes and basil are in. Yummo!

My susband and I loved this salad.  I have fresh basil growing on my patio so used that.  Thought all that mayo sounded too creamy but it was delicious.  Didn't add dressing until we were ready to eat.

Made this for a picnic and it was gone before I knew it.  I did think the dressing  was a bit tangy so I added a little sugar.       Good way to get my husband to eat tomatoes.

Only 4 stars because I didn't really follow the recipe- I simply made a mixed lettuce salad, tossed crumbled bacon over it and used the recipe mostly for the basil dressing- WHICH IS THE BEST PART!  Def a keeper- will make this many more times!  Thanks!

This is probably my favorite salad ever. I have a lot of fresh basil in the garden, and this is a great way to use it. The croutons are to die for. I fry them in the bacon fat. Mmmmm...

This is a very flavorful salad and I can see other applications for the dressing alone!  I used red and green leaf lettuce, which was also good, but a bit softer.  I think next time I'll mix in some iceberg lettuce as well... just tired of romaine since we, if we eat salad at all, usually have a Caesar.  This was a nice change of pace!  DH is not a big salad eater, so I make a lot of fresh veggies in other ways than salad per se.  He didn't rave about it like he does Caesar, but I really didn't expect him to!  I served this at his birthday dinner and was asked for the recipe, so I know it's a keeper!  Thanks for the great alternative, Kimber!

Not great. Used lettuce and basil from the garden, expected more of a bacony taste. The vinegar was really strong in it, and I love vinegar.

I love this salad.  It does taste very much like a BLT sandwich.  I did run into problems with the croutons, but that was eror on my part.  I didn't have the right kind of bread and tried to substitute fresh sandwich bread.  You definately need a crustier bread, we'll leave it at that!  :)  Personally, I didn't think the avacado really went well with the salad, but that's just me.  Will definately make again.  Thank you for the recipe.

I JUST got done making this.  It's still sitting on the counter waiting for my entree to finish cooking :)  I haven't served it to my family but I tried it!  YUM!!  My kitchen smells SO good it brought my husband in from OUTSIDE!  Excellent!  Very easy!  ** I didn't have any french bread on hand so I substituted 6 pieces of potato bread that I had left.  I cut them into thirds and continued to with the recipe!  Browned beautifully!  YUM!!

My daughters' boyfriend Kyle will make a pouty face if I don't make him his favorite Caesar salad every Sunday night, however, I told him that we needed a change and I'm happy to say that the whole family loved this recipe. The basil gave the dressing a wonderful flavor. Thanks Kimber!

AWESOME!  The only thing I did was add some garlic chips (sliced garlic cloves) to the bacon as it was cooking, the homemade croutons make all the difference!

Made this salad for a BBQ and it got a great response.  Made the crutons per the recipe, but the BBQ got delayed until much later in the day and the crutons went chewy....popped them in the oven for a little while and it restored their crunchieness.  Will definitely make again.

This was very good!! The only drawback was I didn't have enough dressing. I also added more than 2T of the drippings to make it smoother. But there was still only enough to put a couple spoonfuls on each person's serving. But otherwise the salad is very crunchy and tasty and I love how the croutons came out! Instead of browning them in a skillet I spread them out on a pizza pan and stuck them a 400 degree oven for about 15 minutes...very good!

This was a terrific salad. I didn't make croutons because my family is on the Atkins diet. I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes. I topped the salad with grated Parmesean cheese for added flavor. I used Ranch Dressing 2 instead of the Basil Mayo Dressing. It is a fantastic dressing with lots of herb flavor. My husband especially loved this salad.
