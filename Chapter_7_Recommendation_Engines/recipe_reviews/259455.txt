Press Manual, set for 6 minutes. Do not press Timer as the instructions state.   If someone would rewrite this recipe and leave out the confusing high pressure for 10-15 minutes, that would be lovely. It’s 6 minutes at high pressure, which is what the Manual setting does by default. It will take 10-15 minutes for all this to happen. :-)

Made this 4 times already for various dinner parties. It's been a huge hit and makes for great leftovers! 

Set the instant pot to high pressure cook for 6 minutes and close the vent. It will take about 8 minutes to come to pressure. Then it will cook for the 6 minutes. Afterwards, let the pressure release naturally (with the vent still closed) for about 5-10 minutes. Then open the vent and do the last step of adding the parmesan.

I made a few minor adjustments to this recipe. First, I scaled this down to 2 servings, but kept the arborio rice at 1 cup (instead of 3/4 cup for 2 servings). I have made risotto in my Instant Pot many many times, and always do the 1 cup rice to 2 cups chicken broth ratio, and it comes out perfect! I also only added the olive oil in step 1, and saved the butter to stir in at the end, before adding the Parmigiano Reggiano, which makes for a creamier risotto. I also added the sprig or rosemary during the saute step, but removed it after the oil was flavored with the rosemary, before adding the white wine. This was due to personal preference, as we didn't want the rosemary to over power the risotto. My Italian husband commented that he could taste the rosemary, but ever so slightly, which was perfect in our opinion. I would definitely make this one again, exactly like I did this time.

This recipe is perfection,  creamy and full of flavor.  My husband has been to Italy many times and he said, "this is what true risotto should taste like".

Step 3 was confusing for some reviewers.  After you close the lid, press Manual and set the timer for 6 minutes, it will take 10 - 15 minutes for the Instant Pot to reach temperature and for the pressure to release.

I am making this now- and it's my first recipe in the Instant Pot. I'm confused by direction #3- it says "set to manual for 6 minutes. Set to high pressure for 10-15. " Do I do manual for 6 minutes and then high pressure for 12? My high pressure light is on already....

Thank you so much for this great recipe!  This was my 1st foray into risotto-land, and I will TOTALLY be making this again.  Will add roasted garlic next time -- it was great as-was, but I'd like that flavor in there as well.  (Also used pre-sliced mushrooms instead of chopped ones, and that was great).  Served it with roasted asparagus, which we ended up just stirring into the risotto.  Super-creamy and super-easy!  (Also, agreeing with some other reviewers, just turn on Pressure Cook -- High and set it for 6 minutes.  It will come up to pressure (think of as pre-heating) for 10-15 minutes AUTOMATICALLY (you need do nothing to achieve this), then when it beeps, which will be like 20-25 minutes later, just release the pressure entirely (this will take about 5 minutes) then continue with the stirring til creamy / Parmesan / salt / pepper.  :-D

SO. GOOD.  I sauteeed asparagus and red bell peppers with garlic and added it after the risotto was done. 
I agree that the initial instructions are a little confusing.  I set it for 6 minutes on high pressure and let the pressure come down naturally, which took about 20 minutes  (at which point I released the rest of the pressure and opened the lid). I also added some lemon zest and a squeeze of lemon juice (about a half a lemon) when I added the cheese.  Will definitely make this again!

I used dried mushrooms, rehydrated, and this turned out 5 star.   The rosemary was fantastic and perfumed everything perfectly.   I can be a traditional rositto snob but will make this anytime.   Made this with grilled rib eye and asparagus,  the grilling time matched the risotto time and the whole family loved it.

I'm a beginner on the Instant Pot and got a little confused by the timing of 6-min vs 15-min.  I finally read a review that said use the rice setting for 10-min.  That worked, but I'm not thrilled with the texture and it seemed lacking in spices.  I prefer my traditional stove-top method.

This was my first try at risotto and I used this recipe as a base. I used 1 cup arborio rice and reduced the recipe accordingly. I used 2 T butter and about 3 T olive oil and sautéed the onion and garlic for a few minutes in my pressure Cooker.  I then added my mushrooms and cooked for a few minutes then added my rice. I added only about 1/4 cup of wine and let simmer for a minute before adding the chicken broth. I sealed the pot and changed the setting to risotto/rice for 10 minutes. I finished it off with the Parmesan and it turned out perfectly. Thank you for a great base and good cooking directions. My husband and I loved this paired with a grilled pork chop and crisp green beans.

This was awesome! I changed a couple of things to veganize it and use the mushrooms I needed to use up before they spoiled and it was amazing. I had more than the called for amount of mushrooms. I also did not saute them in oil since mushrooms release so much liquid on their own. I started out with about 1/4 vegetable broth to saute and added the mushrooms. I had to add a little water to keep them from sticking and when they released their water I added the onions. I also replaced the chicken broth with store bought mushroom broth.Everything else followed the recipe until the end when I had to add more water and keep stirring to get the creamy texture. I did NOT add any vegan Parmesan or regular Parmesan and my family still has no idea! This is a keeper for sure!

My friend and I loved it! I made it in a pressure cooker and like someone else said, I used high pressure and cooked it for 6 minutes and did natural release.

I didn't have wine so I used all chicken broth.  I subbed out and used parsley and chopped 8oz of fresh mushrooms into pieces and used freeze-dried onions.

Will definitely make again.  I made this with the Garlic Chicken that was baked, brussel sprouts and again, Pull-Apart Garlic Bread

I sampled this recipe today in preparation for a dinner tomorrow so I halved everything but still cooked it for six minutes. I was a little scared when I opened the pot because it looked like there was a fair bit of liquid still but after stirring for a minute or so the risotto became creamy and once I added the cheese it was perfect.

This is a go-to recipe in my “brain-dead-but-need-an-idea” file.  I made it first for my fiancé, who prefers white sticky rice, and he loved it.  Since I am an old-school risotto cook, having learned from two Italian women and a good bottle of wine, it almost seemed sacrilegious to make risotto in an instant pot.  Oxymoron, right?  This is one time where the results are more satisfying than the process (and there’s nothing that says you can’t sip your wine while the pot does its thing...).  I made this exactly as the recipe presented it,  using good wine and good parmigiana-reggiano (Kirkland brand from Costco is my fav).  As all my chef friends remind me: use the best ingredients for the best results.  I don’t often give things five stars, but this recipe deserves it.

You can play it pretty fast and loose with what you put in this and it still turns out beautifully! Tonight we made it with chicken broth and beef broth and no wine. We also skipped the Rosemary. Still fantastic! We have to go 12 minutes in our pressure cooker.

What a nice risotto, and you don’t have to stir it! Mine came out perfect, I used a very light Pinot Grigio and the balance in the flavor was just fantastic! The rosemary sprig added a really nice flavor profile. My family went nuts over this. I even made my stock in the IP just for this. Awesome dish!

This was SO delicious and super easy to make. My families new favorite. I did change the type of broth I used the 2nd time I made it. My husband said it actually tasted creamier. I used Organic Vegan Protein broth.

I wanted to double the recipe but kinda panicked at the amount of liquid that would represent. Doubled all but the broth and then stirred in more broth with the cheese at the end. It was pretty good but would probably use more cheese next time. We have a microplane that tends to make the cheese very "fluffy" so I might not have had as much as the recipe specified. Hmm, my daughter might have a point about converting recipes to weight measurements.

This was a big hit ar our house. I slapped it together substuting mushroom broth for the chicken stock. I have a Fagor Versa multicooker which easily accomodates Instant Pot recipes,. I had cooked something similar on the stovetop and was looking for a multi-cooker version and this fit the bill perfrectly. Great flavor without all the stirring, I will be attempting other risotto recipes soon.

Basic recipe is great!  I typically use Carnoroli rice instead Arborio, so I do about a 3:1 for stock to rice, so 6 quarts stock to 2 cups rice.  Other than that, I cook the onions first so that they are softer and I add some thyme in addition to rosemary.  Finally, I like to add meat, either chopped grilled chicken breast or chopped grilled Italian sausages, or even both!

It was too watery. I would reduce the broth by 1/4,  thus 3 cups instead of 4. 

Moreover, the mushrooms are not present enough,  either in the plate or the taste.

I would add at least 1 extra cup of shrooms.

honestly this is the worst risotto i've ever had. it was wayyyy overcooked -- basically porridge -- and the flavor of the amazing, flavorful mushrooms we got at the farmers market was totally lost. it was aggressively under seasoned as is, we had to add copious amts of salt, lemon rind, and wayyyy more parmesan than called for to make it palatable. i ended up ordering a pizza instead.

I have to admit, I was skeptical reading the reviews saying that this pressure cooked version tasted as good as making risotto the old fashioned way  but honestly now I'm a believer! This was creamy, smooth and utterly delicious! I made the recipe exactly as written and we were all extremely pleased with it. Look forward to making this again.

Was as easy as promised and the results were delicious, though only used 2/3 the prescribed 24 oz chopped mushrooms.  The other 8 oz looked like overkill. Also grateful that unlike my one prior Instant Pot attempt at strogonoff, I had no steaming gravy geyser with a 2 foot cleanup radius.

This is a really delicious and easy recipe for risotto!  I used a little less butter and oil, and a little less chicken stock.  Followed the cooking instructions.  It turned out perfect!  Thanks for the  wonderful recipe.

I wanted to make this dish but didn’t have white wine on hand. Since my town doesn’t sell alcohol on Sundays, I was stuck trying to find a substitute. I ended up ruining the dish because I followed the guidance of a well-known cooking website that recommended using apple cider vinegar. I thought it sounded kind of strange, given the potency of apple cider vinegar but I thought I’d give it a try. It was a total disaster! It ruined the entire dish. Next time, I’ll wait until I have the wine handy. Don’t make the same mistake that I did.

That being said, the texture was good and I have no doubt it would have been delicious if not for that fatal blunder. I will remake this again without any substitutions.

 I didn’t want to leave a rating, since I made a major substitution that completely ruined this dish. However, I couldn’t leave a review for others to help them avoid the huge blunder that I made without a rating.

Great base recipe. I skipped the wine and swapped the mushrooms for 3 cups of squash. I also added a couple tablespoons of heavy cream with the cheese at the end. The squash disintegrates and creates a lovely creaminess. Also added 1/2 tsp of pepper.

As other reviewers have commented, this was a soggy bland mess. I have another risotto recipe for the instant pot that is always perfect--it calls for 1 less cup of liquid for the same amount of rice.

This was delicious! Yet I did get a burn notice while the IP was coming to pressure. I just opened the lid and stirred it a bit. I followed the recipe exactly. I'm wondering why the rice began to stick\burn. Something similar happened with another dish. Does anyone have suggestions to keep the burning from happening?  I'm wondering if the sauteing just makes the IP so hot already.  Thanks!

This recipe was my comfort food tonight as it is damp and cold outside.  I used baby bellas, white mushrooms and some porcini mushrooms.   Pretty much the rest is by the book. Yum, had a glass of wine from the bottle and it was lovely.

This was only the 2nd recipe I've made in my new instant pot.  I was a little worried about it turning out and was serving it to a large group, but it turned out just great.

I would definitely make this again.  I used a combination of (reconstituted) wild mushrooms (Costco sells a large plastic bottle of them) and it was really tasty.

This was excellent and quick.  I heated the chicken stock in the microwave while doing everything else to help it come to pressure quicker.  A true 30 minute meal. Served it with crusty bread and peas.

Made it exactly per recipe.  This was really good and my wife loved it.    Instant Pot made it so easy too!  I may try another recipe and see if I can lower the fat a bit as 645 cal per serving is pretty amazing.  Nonetheless, great recipe!

Delicious! 1/2 tsp pepper was the right amount for us. Vegan version is great too--just use veg broth add 1/4 cup nutritional yeast instead of cheese. Yum, yum, yum.

I live at 5,200ft altitude and needed to cook under high pressure for an additional 3 minutes.  I added 1 extra cup of mushrooms to ensure I had a mushroom in every bite, as well as added 1 can of green peas to include an extra veggie and a little color.  I served this dish topped with a small portion of sliced seared pork tenderloin, and it turned out great for my household!  I will 100% will be making this recipe again!

I had my doubts but this came out perfect. I wanted to make sure it came out good before trying on company but without a doubt I will. No more standing and stirring for perfect risotto.

Excellent flavor and consistency. I used sherry for the wine to compliment the portabella mushrooms. I also threw in some frozen peas for a little more protein.

The dish was awesome on the first try!!!!!!!!!  will make again. I did make some changes.

I used only 1 cup of the rice, i cut up some fresh garlic and sauteed it at the very beginning. I had to use Parmesan and Romano cheese for the cheese.

Loved this!  Will make it a zillion times again.  Stirred in some fresh arugula right before serving--amazing!  I followed the simplified cooking instructions from one reviewer (prepare as directed on InstantPot saute, put on the lid and set to high pressure for 6 minutes, natural release for about 12 mins).  I also used 4 cups of mushrooms because I wanted to use them all up (about 3/4 lb for shopping purposes)

I followed the recipe exactly and it was excellent!  But the yield was way more than 4 servings.... more like 8-12 depending on portion size.  I mention this for others  to help in planning.

This recipe makes a great texture rice and the flavor really gets infused into the dish.  I will definitely make this again but will likely reduce chicken stock by 1/4 of cup as it was a bit thin.  I also grated some lemon zest on top before serving - which I do whenever I make risotto.  It just gives it a nice brightness

Loved it! Used vegetable stock because that’s what I had on hand. Also used Parmesan as well as some beautiful gruyere. And of course added some fresh chopped garlic.  Also delicious leftover. But it makes a lot!

I made it mostly according to the recipe.  I added chopped garlic and I only left rosemary in during sauté stage and removed prior to pressurization.  There was a rosemary aroma so I think that was fine.  I believe the end product comes out more glutinous than traditional stovetop method and it required more Parmesan, salt and butter to make it very tasty.   Overall it was just okay to me, however, my family really liked it.  I do like the speed of the instant pot so I may go for this again.  I served with grilled chicken.

Excellent. I let it rest 5 minutes before releasing pressure, I was a bit confused as to that timing, so I split the difference.

I made this pretty much to the recipe- using a blend of Cremini and white mushrooms.  I did add about 1/3 of a small can of Urbani Black Truffles & mushrooms which really added a great truffle mushroom flavor to the dish!  I love that it's a "one & done" IP recipe!  Some IP recipes- you end up spending almost 2 hours from start to finish- which is frustrating.  LOVE this recipe!!

This is so delicious! I had never made risotto before but I figured if I could use my instant pot it’d be worth a shot. I pretty much followed the recipe, except I cooked it a little longer so I could throw some chicken breasts on top and cook them at the same time. It did no harm at all. I highly recommend!

Very, Very good. First time I've made risotto in an instant pot (made many times the old fashioned way)  but it works great! Much easier than standing over a stove for 45 minutes.

One revision/suggestion. We had mushroom risotto in a nice hotel. It was really good. When we asked what was unique, the chef said that instead of using parmesan cheese, he used smoked gouda cheese.  

This is a REALLY good change, as much as i love parmesan, i ALWAYS use smoke gouda in this recipe.

Btw: i have TWO instant pots. I made this in the 6 qt, but it would be fine in the 3 qt too.

Turned out great.  Fanatic consistency with very little work.  I think it needs more seasoning, but I think most Instant Pot recipes do.

This is amazing! Risotto is not easy to make and get the consistency right, and this was perfect. Everyone loved it and we will definitely be making this regularly.

I added asparagus, but would be best to add it at the end instead of before pressure cooking, it got overcooked

I made it tonight and it was delicious. I did rice setting at 10 minutes, seems like there is quite a lot of variation on times, I took a guess, crossed my fingers and winged it. I let it natural release for about 5 minutes and quick released. I added parm, salt and pepper, stirred and it was perfect. I used burgundy wine and beef stock because that is what I had on hand. Thank you for sharing this delicious keeper.

This was the first recipe I tried for my first time using the Instant Pot. I was not disappointed! It was easy to make and the flavor was impressive! I'll definitely be making this one again!

Just note that when you get to Step 3 of this recipe, it doesn't tell you to turn off the Saute mode and switch over to Manual mode (titled "Pressure Cook" mode on some models). Make sure you do that!

This recipe is foolproof and THE MOST DELICIOUS Risotto ever!
I have tried making risotto the regular way in the past and mine never looked as creamy as the picture on the recipe nor was it cooked perfectly.  The instant pot version by Shaun is Fabulous!  I have served it many times to guests and everyone loves it.
When I reheat leftovers I do add a little water and it is just as creamy the second time around.

This was my first attempt at making risotto of any kind.  I followed the directions and the times noted to the letter.  I changed nothing in the original recipe and it turned out perfectly.  I actually used my Apple Watch to time the steps noted in the recipe.  I’m on a restricted salt diet and so I used the low sodium chicken stock and didn’t add anymore salt.  It was excellent and even my husband, who isn’t on a low salt diet, said it was just fine and didn’t add anymore salt.

ok, when you open the pot don't be scared! I was cause I thought I saw a liquid disaster. However, I started storing and it thickened very nicely. My first time making risotto and it was a huge hit with the family. As long as you season correctly with salt and pepper at the end this will change life! Literally!

I lOVE this recipe. I never seem to have chicken stock on hand so I use 4 cups water and mix 4 tablespoons of chicken bouillon powder to replace the 1 quart of chicken stock; therefore, I usually do not add the parmesan cheese at the end because it makes it extremely salty (nothing some pepper doesn't help equalize). But this recipe is my go to at least once a week! I also have a different instant pot than the one talked about, so after the sauté step, I click "rice" and let it do its thing for about 12 minutes. Its amazing. thanks for sharing!

Made it just as directed. It was perfect. So good. I would definitely not put the spring of rosemary in next time without chopping it up first though and adding less. I didn’t love the whole leaves in there only b/c it overpowered the mushrooms.

Made it exactly as described and came out very runny  Sauteed for an extra to minutes to get rid of some liquid. Very tasty but needs 1 less cup liquid as the mushrooms release liquid when cooking.

The only changes I made were..  add 2 cloves of diced garlic after sautéing the onions. I also added some Italian seasoning to boost the flavor. I also sliced the mushrooms instead of dicing. 

Besides these minimal changes, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out amazing. I will definitely be making again.

Had tried a different Instant Pot risotto recipe a couple weeks ago and as a new IP user, I was disappointed with it.  Decided to try this one and so glad I did!  I followed the directions exactly, which I found to be very clear.  Absolutely delicious!  Creamy, flavorful, and simple.  Not a huge fan of rosemary but used a small sprig anyway though next time I will likely omit.  I think I’ll add a small clove of minced garlic instead.  Will certainly make this again!!  Loved it!

The commenter's directions about just setting at 6 minutes were spot on-follow them. 
This has hope to be a decent recipe but the flavor was sort of bland. Seemed to need a lot of salt or "something"-not sure what. Possibly using a variety of mushrooms. 
It was easy for anyone who hasn't done risotto before.

Very good, and simple to make. I used unsalted chicken broth, because I need to eat low sodium. I'm looking forward to switching up ingredients with this basic pattern now I know this works. I'll almost certainly add garlic and/or lemon next time. I used regular rice, because that's what I had, and while the texture wasn't authentic, it was still very good. I did 6 minutes on high pressure, wasn't sure about the release instructions, which are weirdly worded, so I settled for waiting five minutes before I quick-released the pressure.

This is a really excellent recipe!  Have made it a bunch of times now and it's super versatile, works well to swap out the mushrooms for whatever other kind of veggies you want to use.  Also, leftovers make awesome risotto cakes! Just form into golf ball sized balls, roll in seasoned panko or breadcrumbs, flatten slightly and pan fry until golden brown ;)   

Original instructions are written a little funny as is, you just need to set it to Pressure Cook for 6 minutes, that's it.  Quick or natural release after it's done is fine though rice will be a bit softer with a natural release.

This is amazing!  I've always wanted to try making mushroom risotto, but have always been turned off by the time commitment.  This was quick, easy and DELICIOUS. Will be making again soon!

Didn’t think it would be this easy and quick to make. The risotto turned out great and I followed the original recipe. Thank you for this great Instant Pot recipe!

I've made mushroom risotto in the instant pot before, and it was great. Must have been a different recipe, because this one is unbelievably bland. Cooked properly, but holy  it's inedible.

This was my first IP attempt and I was amazed as to how easy it was. I did need to add more Parmesan cheese,  salt &  pepper to enhance the taste. It turned out very creamy and my husband liked it. SCORE!

Lots of rave reviews! I used Trader Joe's 10- minute Farro Pasta (looks like barley but taste like rice - ancient grain. Use all of One package, less than $2.00). Same recipe, instant pot for 8 minutes then natural pressure release. Farro has a firmer texture which everyone has seemed to enjoy, but it absorbs less liquid and will require some last minute heating (sear) and stir to reduce liquid, adds to creaminess. Dab of butter at end not required, thyme or Tuscan seasoning and Parmesan cheese. Stays well for buffet and leftovers aren't sticky like arborio rice, plus health benefits, reasons for using Farro.

Came out really well and would make again. I used Chardonnay and a mixture of white and oyster mushrooms.  Just had to make sure to season with enough salt! Family loved it.

Very good- I cooked the onions for about 10 minutes first to soften, then added the mushrooms and a couple chopped cloves of garlic. I will make this again with suggestions others have given here.  Note - I allowed for a 15 minute natural release.

Made it as posted.  Not as good as I ate while stationed in Italy but dang good none the less.  My granddaughter said we will do this again and this was her first Risotto. 

Yes we will have again!!  Served with homemade bread from our bread machine...yum yum.

Made this tonight and it was wonderful! Didn't have white wine, so I used 1/4 cup of seasoned rice vinegar instead. I intended to make up the difference in liquid by adding more stock, but I forgot. And it turned out perfectly anyway - just enough liquid left to stir at all in after releasing pressure. Also didn't have the parmesan, and it was still absolutely delicious!

I followed this recipe closely (only substituting avocado oil for olive oil) and the results were truly delicious and so  easy.  We've saved it to be added into our dinner rotations, and in the future the only adjustment I would make (when I have it on-hand again) would be to use instapot created bone broth instead of store-bought chicken broth.

This is the ultimate comfort food. Soooo good and the wine gave it such a robust flavor. I didn't have as many mushrooms as it called for so next time I'll be sure to plan ahead. I also adjusted the recipe for six servings and there was more than enough. Will definitely make this again. And the recipe is perfect just the way it is.

Really like this recipe. I just did a few tweaks. Left out the onions and substituted an extra cup of mushroom and added 2 cloves of roasted garlic. Then I topped it with pan seared shrimp. Really delicious.

What a time saver over sitting and stirring, and stirring, and stirring! I did go with 7 minutes at high pressure as opposed to the 6 listed in recipe. Only thing I added was about a one inch piece of parmesan rind during cooking in addition to the amount stated to stir in at the end.  stirring at the end is an important step. Will definitely make again

I made this for a company retirement pot-luck.  People went bonkers for it!  I could barely get work done the rest of the day as my coworkers kept stopping by with Tupperware for leftovers and to get the recipe.  Try this recipe & it will be a staple in your repertoire that guests and friends will request again and again. 

Because I wanted it to be freshly made, I followed the recipe right up to the point of pressure cooking before work that morning, then about a half an hour before the party started I added the stock and followed the rest of the directions.  It was really good but if I had to do it all over again, I would have reduced the cook time by a minute or so to accommodate that the rice softened a bit while waiting for the final pressure cooking.  But having made this recipe once before, I know that the recipe as written is perfect as long as your cooking it all at once.

I love this risotto’s creamy texture, and especially the mostly hands-off cooking.  My chickens stock was homemade, so was made of some simmered chicken bones, half an onion, a small carrot, and a little thyme, and some celery leaves, but very little salt, so my risotto came out pretty bland.  Next time I make it, I’ll add 1/2 tsp salt per cup of rice (so 3/4 tsp for this recipe), and I’m confident my crew will love it.

Great recipe.  Proportions are spot on and this can be used to as a base for all kinds of different risottos.  The risotto sky's the limit from here.

This was a starting point for a mushroom and spicy sausage risotto.  The only thing I did 8 oz of sliced cremini mushrooms and a pound of spicy Italian sausage.  I sauteed the sausage and then added the mushrooms and sauteed the for a bit.  Everything else was the same.  It turned out great!

"Wow, did I really prep this amazing meal?" - me
"This is restaurant quality risotto" - my friend

This became my favourite meal. I add a bit more mushrooms and cheese and a bit less rice to reduce carb ratio, but overall this is quite an easy recipe. I usually make it a bit more and put the leftovers in the fridge. Almost as good the next day, or the day after, or the day after.

The only thing I would change is that I wouldn’t put the rosemary in until the end because it all fell off and left big pieces of rosemary all throughout the risotto. Otherwise, it was delicious!

I followed the recipe to a T and ended up with a soggy mess with little flavour. I managed to salvage it by continuing to cook it on the stove-top, but also had to add seasoning as it was rather bland. Will go back to a trusted stove-top recipe next time.

So good! Risotto came out perfectly. I used baby Bella mushrooms. I may add garlic next time for a bit more flavor.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit. I followed the directions exactly but for adding asparagus to the mix. Quick, easy and delicious. This one is a keeper.

Loved it - just wonderful.   

Note:  I tried a modification recommended by one reviewer:  cook 10 minutes (rather than 6 min), because I also prefer softer rice.  I also used a 10 minute natural release.  I think next time I will do one or the other (either 10 min OR 10 min natural release).  Regardless, flavor was wonderful.

Unreal how good this was.  I went a little crazy with the romano cheese but it was still one of the best things I've ever made in my pressure cooker.

I used shiitake mushrooms and traded the oregano for thyme.  Thyme is more subtle and gives it a sophisticated taste and aroma.  It was great!  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome! Using the Instant Pot takes all of the pain out of making risotto but none of the flavor or creaminess.  I used a combo of rehydrated porcini, chanterelle and crimini mushrooms, using the liquid from the porcini along with chicken broth.  Excellent!

So creamy and delicious, and SO easy!  I agree there must be an omission in the instructions for step 3.  I resolved it by setting it to manual for 6 minutes, and then adding 13 minutes to it when the time was up.  So 19 to 20 minutes all in one stretch should work just fine.  This is going to be my base recipe for risotto from now on.

This is one of the first recipes I tried in my instapot, and it turned out really delicious!  I used chicken stock instead of wine, and reduced the recipe to use one cup of rice.  I didn't have marjoram so I used oregano as suggested by another reviewer.  I used the rice setting on my pot and it was probably a little bit too long.  Overall it turned out great and I will definitely make it again.

First recipe in my Instant Pot - it was a little confusing with the "set to manual for 6 minutes.  Set to high pressure for 10-15"  in the directions.  I set it to Pressure Cook (high) for 6 minutes.  I think the 10-15 minute refers to the amount of time it takes the IP to get up to pressure?  The risotto turned out fabulous;  tasted delicious and certainly was quick .  I omitted the white wine and used additional chicken stock.  I used an 8 oz package of mushrooms.

I'm an Instant Pot newbie, but an old fan of risotto. This recipe gets a lot of kudos for being so darned easy. I hate the constant stirring most risotto requires. I haven't really gotten the hang of how the Instant Pot works, but it seems very forgiving. Once I got the pot sealed, which seemed to take about ten minutes, I programmed it for 10 minutes. (I'm not a fan of al dente rice.) Sure enough, it came out great. I used oregano instead of rosemary, but otherwise followed the directions to a T. It tastes like mushrooms, which I love, and the rice is nice and creamy. It's not a strong flavor, but I don't think it's meant to be. There's a lot of leftovers, but I'll just freeze them in serving sized portions and have lots for later. Thanks!

Great! I didn't have unsalted butter , and I used shallots for the onion.
Halfed the recipe and cooked for 5 minutes, let sit for 1 minute, and then did quick release.  Came out perfect.

This is so much easier than a traditional risotto. I cut the portions back to three and there was probably enough for six people as a side. I used my Instant pot and cooked it for five minutes on the high pressure feature, not rice. I'll probably make this again but leave out the rosemary.
