I didn't bother to grind this up.  I just put all the ingredients in a container and shook it up.  Then I used 1/3 cup of cereal mix to 1 cup of water.  My DD left her cinnamon flavored flax  with me, and that made if smell really good as it heated up!  Delicious!

Wonderful recipe!  I've been making changes to our diet as far as going organic and also as gluten free as possible.  This was a keeper and with the diet I'm on, this was perfect; healthy and filling.  I even served with fresh berries for a treat.  Thank you for sharing.

This is so good!  I didn't have any amaranth the first time I made it, so I just omitted it and it was good that way too.  It has become a staple in our house.  It's really good if you add a tablespoon or so of cocoa powder per cup of cereal--especially if you sweeten it with maple syrup.  Reminds me of Cocoa Wheats, only healthier.

The ingredients sounds very healthy. I will try it. I might add to it some cinnemon and butter for more flavor. Also, I wonder if it can be used as a substitute for flour to make pancake or cookies. You probably need to add baking powder since the ingredients are gluten free.

Awesome, I didn't have the rice or amaranth but I did add some Kamut flakes, Spelt kernels and sunflower seeds.  I didn't grind either, love the texture and chewiness of all the grains.  Husband LOVED it!!  You can mix this up and have many variations.  We sweeten with Stevia as it is a natural sweetener.  THANK YOU!!

Excellent recipe! However, I've noticed that some of these ingredients, like rice and the ones I buy in bulk, should probably be rinsed before cooking.  But they have to be dried before grinding.  In the future I will look for no-rinse-required ingredients; for now maybe rinse then dry in a warm oven.

Great recipe, and inspiration!  Make it your own with what you have on hand!  We used white rice (will use brown next time), 1/2 c quinoa, 1/4 c chia seeds, 1/4 c. raw walnuts, 1/4 c. raw sunflower seeds, 3/4 c spelt flakes, 1/4 c ground flax seed and 1/2 c steel cut oats, for example (we don't do corn or wheat in our house, but no matter!).  We blend all our grains in the blender, then carefully use the handle end of a wooden spoon to stir, always keeping the wood on the glass sides of the blender.  This way the nuts and grains keep moving, not gummed up in the bottom.  Add in the end:  cranberries, raisens, cranberry/orange relish from Christmas, creamed honey, cinnamon, banana, jam/preserves, options are endless! My two- and four-year-olds ate it up!  A super welcome change to oatmeal, according to them.  I think you could probably soak all in water with a teaspoon or so of vinegar and salt ~ 24 hours if you prefer that method of "cooking." Thank you!

This was really good.  I used teff instead of corn meal and I didn't add sesame seeds.  My kids said it tasted just like oatmeal.

Good gluten free cereal. I used a coffee grinder to grind up the flax seed too. The blend takes more time to fully cook than stated. When I remember, I make it the night before and reheat with soy milk in the morning. Add some brown suger and the kids love it!

This is a great recipe!  Made a few tweaks for my preferences: Kept all the grains whole as I like the chewier texture (though I did grind the flax), used half and half White Basmati and Sprouted Brown Rice for the rice, used a mix of red and white Quinoa and added an extra cup of GF Oats and a half cup each of Kaniwa and Red Lentils to the mix cause I had them on hand and figured why not.  Needed a bit longer cooking time due to the whole grains, 25-30 minutes and I use about 1/3 cup of mix to 1(ish) cup of water and/or milk to cook the grains up as I like it a bit thicker.  Really excellent mix and so versatile!

This is a great recipe. Read the other reviews before making it. I didn't grind anything and loved it that way. I also used a mix of brown and white teff flour instead of cornmeal. I exchanged fonio grains for the millet. I also used 1/2 cup of arborio rice (all I had on hand) and 1/2 cup of par-boiled red Thai rice instead of basmati. Use your imagination. Using tricoloured quinoa also adds to the colors. Once mixed, I used 1/2 cup of cereal with 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of almond milk. I added raisins and dried cranberries. It's a lovely, hearty breakfast. I also made a portion using vegetable broth and it made a wonderful lunch! Lastly, heed the advice of another reviewer and make it the night before to have a quickie breakfast the next morning. (especially if you don't grind the grains.) The possibilities are endless with this recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us.

This recipe was fabulous!  So much better than buying those boxed old rancid tasting hot gluten free cereals.  I didn't have sesame seeds or flax seeds, so I used pecans instead.  It was so delicious without sweetener.  Thanks for posting your recipe!

It's an interesting blend of grains, but oatmeal and grits have always been gluten-free.
