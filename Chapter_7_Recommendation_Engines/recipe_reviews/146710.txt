After tweaking this stew was very nice.  However, the following should be noted:  First, the recipe needs to be more precise about the potatoes used.  5 red potatoes is far different from 5 russet potatoes.  I used 1 medium russet and 1 small sweet potato. Second, more stock is needed, at least 1 more cup.  Otherwise it is too dry. Lastly, more herbs are needed.  I added a bay leaf and rosemary.  I also added some Tobasco to my personal portions.  With those tweaks the stew was very nice with a side salad and a sesame seed roll.

I usually hate it when people review a recipe, but then say they changed a bunch of stuff, but I'm beginning to see how it can be helpful to get ideas to make a good recipe better.

I didn't have potatoes, so I used sweet potatoes instead. I was surprised the recipe didn't call for any other spices, so I looked up what spices went well with mung beans and I added ginger and cumin.

The result was phenomenal! A sweet zingy stew.

I followed the recipe but ommitted the celery as I did not have any. My mung beans are small and green and do not look anything like the pictured stew but all the same, this recipe is very savory and delicious. Thank you for posting it. I had a bag of mung beans to use.

Really tasty.  I cooked it in a slow cooker.  The only change was I added some extra water and it was a nice consistency, not too thick.

This was a very good stew. I didn't have onions or celery and I added fresh green beans.  I skipped the pre-cooking of everything (except the beans, of course) and just rough chopped all the veggies and put it all in a casserole dish.  I cooked it in the oven for probably about an hour until the veggies were cooked to my liking (al dente).  It would probably do just as well on the stove top in a big pot.  I will definitly make again.

This was pretty good, but not much of a stew.  It didn't have enough broth to classify as a stew or a soup.  Perhaps it was more of a casserole?  It had ALOT of potatoes.  It was very much a comfort food type of dish.  Fairly plain and filling, but nice.

Five potatoes were going to be far too much so I cut it back to two, which I thought was still a little too much.  The flavor was very good but a little bland so I sprinkled just a little bit of red pepper flakes on it.  Overall very healthy and good.

This was good healthy comfort food.  I liked the instructions for cooking the mung beans.  They came good.  It actually would have made a great filling for a pot pie.

I used Tamarind soup base and added fish. Next time I will add fresh green beans and maybe chicken. I didn't put it in the oven just made it like I would a soup with lots of broth. Very good.

Nice, simple stew.  It had a breakfast feel to me, so I added scrambled eggs to it.

I totally changed this. I par boiled 1/2 cup mung beans, 1/4 cup lentils, 1/4 cup split peas with vegetable broth powder, about 20 min. I also par boiled 1 large red potato, celery, carrot, 1/4 onion, 1 garlic, cauliflower. Add 1 can diced tomatoes. Mixed together and let stew on low.

I doubled this recipe and used half sweet potatoes like some other members have done.  My spices were 1 bay leaf, 1/2 tsp Turmeric, and 1/2 tsp ground Cayenne Red Pepper.  I also added 1 small sliced zucchini to the mix.  It was an awesome soup...and so nutritious!!!

I tried this recipe with a little variation and it was delicious!  I did not use mushrooms but sliced two small sweet potatoes instead of the white potatoes and cooked like the recipe indicated.  I love onions and I just sliced them instead of chopped.  I added fresh grated ginger, turmeric and cumin to the mixture and baked in the oven.  I forgot to cover but it was great!  I will try other beans.  I think lentils, for sure would be good. In addition, it looked good too. Thanks.
