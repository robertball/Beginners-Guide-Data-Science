Love love loved these! I make a breakfast skillet for my family with sweet potatoes and chorizo, so I knew we'd love this. I was sneaking the sweet potatoes after I took them out of the oven and had to stop myself from eating them all. My kids requested I make "those new burritos" again this week. I brought one to work and people were asking what I was eating because it smelled so good. :) I once had something very similar at a local breakfast restaurant and still remember it to this day!

I made this as a change up for my husband from his usual breakfast taco to go. I'm not a big breakfast eater so I haven't tried it myself. but he likes chorizo and sweet potatoes, but he said that the two of them together was too strange of a taste for him.
