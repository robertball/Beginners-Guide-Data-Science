These brownies are outstanding!  The raspberry underneath the rich chocolate frosting (more solid than frosting, really) is really a nice brownie to break the "same ol' same ol'" mode.  I made a change to recipe that I liked and change I didn't like:    1.  I added more raspberry filling thinking "What could be better than *more* raspberry filling?" but too much of it makes it so the frosting kind of slides off teh brownie and it's hard to slice them that way.  So I'd go with the recipe and use 1/4 C next time.     2. I reduced the sugar to 1 2/3 cups and the brownies were perfectly sweet.  I suspect you could reduce the sugar even more; but I wasn't that brave on a first try.  I will absolutely make these again.  I think they would be equally awesome with sweetened orange marmalade or other flavors that go well with chocolate (Nutella anyone?).

These are amazing! I followed all ingredients and directions to a T (except my microwave must be higher powered because it only took one minute for each microwave step). These are so good, I love the thickness of them and the raspberry with the rich chocolate frosting is to die for!

These brownies were incredible.  I did modify the frosting because I didn't have semi-sweet baking squares or cream on hand.  Instead, I used half a bag of chocolate chips and sour cream, which provided a nice tanginess.  I took the brownies to two different parties for Memorial Day weekend, and everyone devoured them!  They are best if you leave them out of the fridge to warm up/soften before serving.

Unbelievably great.  Don't add more raspberry jam even though it seems like there's not much -- 1/4 cup is the perfect amount.

I made these for a birthday dinner for my mom. She thoroughly enjoyed them, which is all the validation I need for this recipe. They were very dense and rich. I used a good raspberry preserve to make sure the raspberry flavor was strong and pure. I also topped the chocolate frosting layer with fresh raspberries.

I made these for my husband's birthday party since he loves the raspberry-chocolate combination and everybody loved them! Many people proclaimed them to be the best brownies they'd ever had, others said they usually don't like frosted brownies, but these were fantastic. They're easy to make and don't take much time. I put in a little less sugar and they still tasted plenty sweet. Make sure not to overbake them. I will definitely make these again!

These brownies are so good!  Perfect if you love fudgy, chewy brownies!  I left out the raspberry because I'm not a big fan of fruit + brownies.  One thing I would suggest is to put a bit less of the "frosting".  It over powers the brownie a bit, since it is so thick.  Other than that... these perfect and easy to make brownies! Will make these again for sure!

These are excellent! I made them for Valentine's Day and they were a huge hit!  The combination of the unsweetened chocolate in the brownie and the semi-sweet chocolate in the frosting is a perfect combo, especially with the raspberry jam. I would definately make these again!

These were absolutely delicious. Our daughter in law loved them! They have a very rich chocolate flavor. Be sure to keep them out of the heat as they tend to be very messy if not kept in a cool place.

These are delicious brownies.  I made them exactly as the recipe and they turned out wonderfully.  My daughter has already asked for them for her birthday.  The little 'tang' from the raspberry is the perfect foil for the chocolate brownies.  It would be fun to top the ganache with a raspberry after it is cut.

Always a hit.  I am famous in my circle of friends and family for this recipe.  I tweak it just a little by decreasing the amount of sugar by at least 1/2 cup and I add a teaspoon or two of pure raspberry extract to the batter.

The actualy brownie was delicious. I didnt give this recipe 5 stars because I wasn't a fan of the cream/chocolate topping. I had three other people try them, and we all agreed that they would taste better without it. I am going to try to make the same brownie but with raspberry jam swirled through instead of on top, and will omit the cream topping. Otherwise a great brownie recipe!

Baked these for work, my family and neighbors! It didn't get one bad review!  This was my first time making brownies from "scratch" w/o a box and I couldn't believe how easy it was. I will never go back, and I will always use this recipe for any brownie I want to make!

These are awesome!  Follow the recipe exactly!  My husband doesn't like any desserts, especially chocolate, and he loved these!  I make them again and again!  We cut them into small squares, wrap individually in tin foil, and freeze in a ziploc bag. We all get into the fridge and pull them out whenever we have a craving... they freeze very well and stay chewy.  Very very good, thanks!

Quick, simple and delicious. The only change that I made to the recipe was to temper the eggs prior to adding them to the brownie mixture to avoid them cooking from the heat of the chocolate. My husband can eat a whole pan of these himself - YUM!

decadent AND delicious! As others did, i cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. Other than that, i followerd the recipe. Easy to cut into perfect squares using a knife dipped in hot water. I used parchment paper as i find it even easier than tin foil for super easy lift out and clean up. Will make again for sure.

I used about 1 1/2 cups of sugar, and that was about right. These were VERY rich, especially with the thick frosting on top, but a nice thing to have on the dessert table with all the light fluffy cakes and whatnot. I put these on a tray with raspberries scattered around the brownies and filled the middle section with raspberries, too.
