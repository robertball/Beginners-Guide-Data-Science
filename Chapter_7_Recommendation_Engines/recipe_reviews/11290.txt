I guess these were not what I was expecting.  Number one I couldn't get the "creamy" butter and sugar mixture and maybe that is why they went wrong from the start!  I found that they baked quickly and I had to turn my oven way down.

Outstanding! Chewy on the inside, crisp on the outside. Perfectly sweet and flavorful. The ONLY thing I would recomend doing differently is adding a bit more coconut. I would suggest making 1 3/4 - 2 inch inch balls and flattening them out a bit, then they do the rest of the work themselves! I used pecans and they turned out great. My family, friends, and I gobbled them up in 4 days. I would definetly recommend trying these!

These cookies tasted really good. They are a little difficult to roll into balls and they do not spread in the oven, so you must flatten them before baking, but all in all a pretty good recipe that I will probably make again.

These cookies ended up very cakey and fell apart.  The flavor is okay, but doesn't make up for the poor texture.

Very good.  I didn't mix everything in the right order b/c I didn't read ahead and it still turned out really well.  I was trying to duplicate some cookies from our work cafeteria.  I used Lindt white chocolate bars chopped up and they made it taste amazing.  Bigger pieces of macadamia nuts work well.  A little hard to form balls from the dough but very worth making.

These were good, but not great. The one reviewer was right they do not form easily, but they also do not spread at all in the oven. I added 1/4 cup water and 2 more tablespoons of flour because the mix was way too dry and was so crumbly I could form it at all, but after adding water and more flour it was easier. When rolling into a ball also flatted it in your hand to form a cookie because it you don't you will get a cooked cookie ball instead of a normal cookie.  The cookies were still a bit too dry for me even after adding water. This recipe definatley needs work and I really don't want to be the one to do it. I'll try another recipe next time. Oh well.

I have two sons away at college and they constantly ask me to send them these cookies.  They sell them for .75c apiece.  They love them.

My family and I really like these cookies.  They are very delicious and easy to make.  They don't roll into balls very well, at least mine didn't but, overall, they are very tasty. We love macadamia nuts and were trying to find a recipe that sounded good and this was the one I chose.  Thank you for sharing.

These are great.  I usually just make the chewy coconut cookie recipe from this site, but I had white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts on hand today so went searching for a recipe that called for all three.  The white chocolate compliments the chewy coconut and crunchy nuts so well.  This is definitely on of our new favorites.

Didn't want to wait an hour while it chilled, so I put it in the deep freeze for 15 minutes instead without a problem.

After reading mixed review, I was very hestitant to melt the sugar as I've never seen that done in cookies.  usually it's creamed, so I didn't since I was making them for a church event, and I didn't want to be talked about..lol  I just creamed the sugars as I would Chocolate chips cookies.  After I saw how dry it was, I put in another egg.  That made a big difference.  They came out great.  So if yours came out crumbly, add one more egg. And yes, roll them in a ball, pat 4 times to flatten it, and they came out perfect.  I tried one in the ball shape and it doesn't spread out that well.  2 eggs is what it needs.

These are good with a few modifications and additions. I used to use a recipe in my bakery in which I browned the butter first and it gives the cookies a great toasty flavor. So I browned the butter on low heat for about 10 minutes being careful not to burn the butter. Also, be careful to stir it every so often in the beginning as the butter may have a tendency to splatter. 
After the butter is browned, remove it from the heat and add the brown sugar and two ounces chopped white chocolate. Use a whisk and beat until the chocolate is melted. Refrigerate until the butter is semi-hard. Then continue with the recipe. Add the white sugar and beat until fluffy. Then the eggs, etc. Also... NO almond extract and NO coconut. It will take away from the butter taste. I used a cookie scoop and flattened them slightly. Bake them at 350 degrees for about 9-11 minutes. Be careful NOT to overcook these cookies. They are even better if they are a "little" under-cooked. Good Luck.

I made a few substitutions, but they turned out very well.  I followed the instructions and my family loved them.  I'm more of a savory cook and not a baker so my family was very surprised how well they turned out.  I'm a fan of this recipe. I just used chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, pecans and coconut.
