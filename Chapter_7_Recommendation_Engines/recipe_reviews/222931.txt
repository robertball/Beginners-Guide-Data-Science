This is a very good recipe--just like what you get in a restaurant!  I had some Persian cucumbers that needed to get used up, and I was lucky to find this recipe!  Thank you!

I reduced the servings to 2 and found it a little dry so I doubled up on the rice vinegar, sugar, and chile. Using the called for amount of sesame oil was too much, the flavor overpowering everything. Next time I'll just add a tsp. of that. Otherwise, this is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you! :o)

i like the recipe and make cucumber salads often. i changed it slightly. i used apple cider vinegar rather than the rice vinegar (i did have rice vinegar). i also put a little lime juice and sesame seeds on top. the chili paste is very tasty in this.

Excellent as written and one of our favorites as a salad or a snack.  I add a dimension by tossing the cucumber slices with about 1 Tablespoon of Kosher salt, making sure it is well mixed.  Allow to rest for 10 minutes, then rinse the cucumbers and drain well before adding them to the rice vinegar dressing.  The end result will be sweet, spicy, crunchy cucumbers.  You can also add length-wise sliced wedges of sweet onion to the vinaigrette.

This is so authentic and tasty!  The flavor of the sesame oil is incredible.  I used one large English cucumber and because I did not have chili paste, I used chili garlic sauce instead.  My young children loved it as a side and I mixed some of these cucumbers with romaine lettuce and shredded rotisserie chicken.  I then used the sauce as a dressing and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds.  Delicious! I will definitely be making this again.

I normally love sesame oil, but it doesn't work for me in this recipe. The rest of the family liked it though

What an excellent recipe. I made it with the ingredients as written but do not measure as a chef  I just eyeball them.
I did use a great chili garlic sauce by Schiriachia and it was outstanding
Thanks for a great idea

FANTASTIC. When I was really young, my best friends were Japanese, and my friends' mom would make this for us at lunch sometimes, along with a sliced octopus salad marinated in the same type of dressing/marinade. SO yummy!!! :D

Definitely serve this with a Japanese type main dish. It is very reminiscent of something I would have eaten at a Japanese restaurant like the title says. I believe it is the sesame oil, that gives it that very specific taste.

It's a delicious recipe! I did add Garlic be aside garlic makes everything that much more amazing. Discretion on how much you put in is up to you, I added a lot (1 TB of minced).   I also scooped out the seeds, and thinly sliced the cucumber.

This was SO amazing! Love the simplicity of the recipe. Often the fewer the ingredients, the better the result! My husband is Japanese & LOVES this salad. I julienned four cucumbers, doubled everything except the sesame oil & it was a 10!!
Thank you!! YUMMMMYYY

Very easy recipe to make, great for new cooks and those new to Japanese cuisine. I loved how the spices worked together to feature the flavor of the cucumber unlike salad dressing which tends to cover over the flavor.

9.12.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/222931/japanese-restaurant-cucumber-salad/ ... By the ingredients & the scent, I thought I'd love this; but it was just okay.  Using English cucs might help - less watering.  The longer it sat, the more the flavor diminished.  Oh, I didn't seed the cucs.  That didn't help the watery factor.  Oops.  I used Asian garlic chile sauce, not paste.  A good last minute Summer dish - since you have to fix it last minute.  :D  Ha.  If I come across two cucs again, I'll try it again - & follow directions better.  Much, much later:  Followed directions.  'Still "okay" A bit too sweet, but a quick, refreshing side.

Tasty even before the 30 minutes of marinading. I halved the recipe for 1/2 a large cucumber and that seemed right, so you may need to increase the dressing for 2 large cucumbers. Similar to what a Japanese friend made for me but she didn't use the chili garlic paste, which adds a nice kick, not too overpowering. thanks.
