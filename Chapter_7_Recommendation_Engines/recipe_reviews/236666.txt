Haven't bought a jar of marinara pasta sauce in MANY years, since I have my own favorite that's always stocked in the freezer.  What a pleasant surprise this recipe was...we loved the Barilla marinara sauce!  It's totally different from my homemade sauce, and I assure you that it now will be a staple in my pantry.  And WOW, did we like the addition of the arugula which added incredible flavor.  The arugula transforms what some may think is an ordinary plate of pasta and spaghetti sauce into something that is quite special.  And finally, it's easy to prepare.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

What can I say. I was skeptical of the store-bought marinara sauce since it never comes close to tasting like the fresh stuff.  I made this partly out of curiosity, and partly bc I needed to use up some arugula and was craving pasta. This recipe couldn't be easier and it comes out tasting fantastic! I followed it exactly as written.  The arugula adds a nice peppery kick to the sauce. Give this one a try! It's great for days when you don't want a lot of fuss at dinner time.

The recipe turned out rather well. My girls were more inclined to eating the arugula in the pasta dish but my hubby was pulling it out...he didn't give that part a chance. But this was a rather nice and could see us making the recipe again.

Spaghetti is one of my favorite dishes! This version includes spicy Baby Arugula lettuce. The Arugula gives the dish color and crunch. Very good!

An easy and delicious recipe perfect for a lazy Sunday. It took just a few minutes to prepare. The arugula gives this dish a really refreshing flavor as well as a nice kick. Barilla marinara sauce is so good that you can't notice is from a jar.I used freshly grated Parmigiano cheese which makes the whole difference. I will make this recipe again.

Super easy, weeknight meal.  Some of my arugula was further past usable than I thought so I added some pesto to round out the flavor and give it some "green."  Love this as a vegetarian main dish (I added some mushrooms, also) and it's quick and easy.  The thick spaghetti is great, too!

This was great.  I wasnt anticipating much since I always make my own sauce and do not like jarred sauce.  I loved it.  It was fabulous.  My family ate it up - I served with salad and garlic bread.  I served arugula on the side because half my family doesnt like it!

I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked this recipe! It was very easy to put together and would be perfect for a quick night meal by itself or as an accompaniment with grilled chicken.  The sauce had a nice depth of flavor and didn't taste like you would expect a jarred sauce to taste. The arugula was a flavorful addition to the dish. It did seem a little dry to me.

I loved this recipe as is. The second time I made it I added romano beans because I want more iron/protein in my diet due to being a vegetarian. It was very filling. The arugula is wonderful because you can just throw it in raw and it wilts perfectly while retaining its peppery flavour! This is a new go-to for me because I need more filling and healthy main courses that are easy/quick to make.
