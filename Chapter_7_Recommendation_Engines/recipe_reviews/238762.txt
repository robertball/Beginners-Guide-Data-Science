I thought this was fantastic. I made it in an iron skillet. Cooked the bacon, drained some of the grease, poured the batter in and cooked. Yummy.

Very good! I love the change in flavor. I would try it served with chili next time and not just a side.

Used a cast iron skillet, and beside the bacon threw  in some chopped peppers. (deseeded and cut off the membrane, just wanted the flavor).  Went well with Texas style chile (no beans).

Very good. For those who didn't like the taste, try using the bacon grease instead of melted butter. :D

My husband and I couldn't wait to make this, but we were a bit disappointed with the results. It was very dry and we might as well have left the bacon out, because the flavor just wasn't there. The second time my husband tried it, he used a full pound of bacon, a full stick of butter and made them into 12 muffins, instead of 9 squares. Perfect!

This recipe was very bland. It had very little cornbread taste and the bacon added nothing to it at all. I was very disappointed.
