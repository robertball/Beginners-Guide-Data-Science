Very good soup, but I just can't leave a recipe alone. I added one stock of sliced celery and 4 cloves of fresh garlic (instead of the powder)  with the onion. I also added a 8.75 oz. can of corn to round out the soup when the shrimp and spinach went in. Add red pepper flakes for a little heat. The original recipe was way too thin for my taste, so I bumped it up by using 3 times the flour called for and it was perfect.

Wonderful dish- we 3 loved it.  Grocery store was out of spinach so I sustituted a little kale and I used a smoked paprika.  I also snuck in a chopped up yellow squash- my 10 year old didn’t notice the extra vegatable. Will def. make again.  Thank you “Potato Goodness!”

Was a great recipe and easy to make, I used some cumin instead of powdered mustard and some Creole Seasoning to add a little zest to it.  I will definitely make it again easy to play around with some different options.

Really enjoyed it. I added bacon and celery too. Two of my kids don't like shrimp so I put that in after I scooped their's.

Enjoyed this recipe, though it needed a bit more "Cajun" flavor. I added a bit of heavy cream with the 2% milk to equal the 2 cups needed. Also garnished with smokey pepper bacon and added Louisiana Crawfish Company Cajun seasoning . A great start to a nice potato chowder. Will make again.

So good! The flavor reminded me of a shrimp version of Chicken & Dumplings. I will continue to make this for the Fall season!

10.9.16  Made exactly as written and thought the flavor was just a little weak for our tastes.  I did add a healthy shot of Sriracha®, a little shake of cayenne, and more of the seasonings that already were in the recipe.  We like chowder a bit thick, so I also whisked a bit more flour and chicken broth into the chowder.  After these few adjustments, we were really happy with the way this turned out.

This was excellent! I like my soup's on the thin side and this was perfect for me. If you want it more on the chowder side you might want to increase the flour to 3 tablespoons. If you like things spicy, add a couple dashes of Old Bay seasoning just for kicks. The leftovers hold up well in this and that is always an extra bonus for me. Hat's off from this soup lover Potatoes USA!
