Its important when using these reviews to determine how you will make this dish to understand that Balsamic Vinegar and Red Wine Vinegar ( which is what the recipe calls for) are two entirely different types of vinegar with very different levels of acidity, and flavor.  I would expect that Balsamic vinegar would not have worked well in this dish at all.

I always thought Greek lamb was made with lemon juice, not vinegar!
I Tried the vinegar..(balsemic) and agree with the others.
Try the juice of a lemon to each pound of lamb...with Greek oregano, as well.

Way too much vinegar, I used the whole cup and had to dilute it with beef stock.  I would use perhaps half a cup of the vinegar, and some stock or water.
