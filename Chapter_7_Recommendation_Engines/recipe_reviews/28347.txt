Since I'm not big on frying anything, I combined all the ingredients in a baking dish and baked in the oven at 350 for about 45 minutes.  Tasted great - everyone enjoyed it!

This was a great and easy recipe. After reading others reviews on how it was a little bland, I made a few of my own motifacations. First I added garlic powder to the chicken while it cooked, than used Brocoli cheese soup and mixed minced onion in that, pepper and served over brown rice. YUMMY!! Even my picky husband ate it up. Thanks this is a keeper

This was good, but I made a few changes. I cut the chicken up in cubes after browning and added an extra can of soup. I also keep a bag of Birds Eye broccoli florets in my freezer and chopped some of them up and added as well. I think next time instead of adding the cheese, I am just going to get cans of broccoli cheese soup instead of plain cream of broccoli soup. I served over rice.

I decided to bake mine, and it turned out wonderful, with a few extra additions.. I cubed up my chicken breast and added it to a casserole dish, along with about 1.5 cups of sliced mushrooms, a few diced red onion, and 1 clove of garlic minced. I seasoned with a little seasoning salt and pepper. I poured the broccoli soup mixture over the dish, and popped it in the oven for about 45 mins at 350. i sprinkled cheese on top at the end. Served with some roasted Broccoli. Flavors were great.

I thought this recipe was pretty tasty, but could use a little kick.  Nothing that a little sauteed onion, a few extra broccoli florets and maybe a little season salt couldn't fix.  I'll add that I really liked that there was enough of the broccoli-cheese sauce to smother the rice in.  I consider that an added bonus.

I added Garlic powder w/ parsley, sea salt and pepper to the chicken before I fried it.  I also took another reviewer's advice and added extra sharp cheddar cheese.  Delicious!  One of our favorite dishes yet; tastes like Broccoli and Cheese Soup with Chicken!

We love this! Very simple! Sometimes I cook 1 cup jasmine or white rice and add it under the chicken breasts while it cooks.

This is really good.  It was easy too.  I used broccoli and cheese soup and added a 16 oz bag of frozen cauliflower.  I thought it was broccoli.  I made this with Orzo with Parmesan and Basil from this site.  Yum! Yum!

Wonderful recipe! Even my extremely picky younger sister, who hates vegetables ate it! I only recommend that instead of stirring the cheese in the cream of broccoli soup, you put the cheese on top of the chicken itself!

YUM YUM YUMMY! Quick, easy, and delicious! It was a tad under salty, but not enough so that I think I would add any during cooking, just add to taste at the table. I serve mine over white rice and went back for seconds!

We made quite a few changes because of what was on hand.  I used cream of celery soup with milk and 3/4 cup of lowfat sour cream for the sauce. The chicken was thinly sliced, seasoned with salt and paprika,  then sautéed the broccoli. Both were combined with the sauce and placed in a 9x13 pan, and topped with cheddar cheese. I covered it and baked for 30 minutes at 350, while rice was made separately.

Since my husband is diabetic we omitted the rice. Couldn't find cream of broccoli soup so I substituted cheddar broccoli soup. I also added more broccoli to It. We don't fry anything so we baked It for about 30-40 minutes. It was a huge hit and the hubs suggested I make it again soon!

I modified it based on the comments and it turned out great. I used one can cream of broccoli and one can cheddar cheese soup and baked it for 40 minutes instead of frying. I also added fresh broccoli for some extra veggies. It was delicious!

I made a 2 serving size just for myself with a few changes. I mixed all the ingredients into an oven safe dish and baked at 350 for 45 minutes. I also added frozen broccoli and used mozzarella instead of chedder cheese. It tasted fantastic! Definitely will use again in the future!

I used cream of mushroom instead of broccoli and added broccoli florets in the noodles; prepared as directed (seasoned chicken with salt, pepper, garlic) and served over broccoli and noodles. Voila! Picky kids ate it up!

My husband is a very picky eater and he loved this! It was easy to make and didn't take a lot of time.  Next time I will add broccoli flowerets, as I thought it needed a bit more broccoli.  Definitely making this again!

I did not have cream of broccoli soup, so I used cream of mushroom and added velveta cheese rather than shredded cheese which melted nicely. I also added a bag of steamfresh broccoli florets and used the suggestion from another review and cut the chicken into smaller pieces when I cooked it. I also added minced onion and garlic to the chicken as it cooked. I have served it over saffron rice which added additional flavor and over penne pasta. Great recipe and easy to make and I love that most of the ingredients are typically stocked in our kitchen.

Had very little flavor. I  didn't like it enough to tweak it.

It was a easy to make dish but the soup needed some zip. I added some broccoli and the family loved it.

We can't get cream of broccoli soup so I used cream of celery soup and added salt, cracked black pepper and dried tarragon to make sure it was not bland - delicious

I made this using home made broccoli cheese soup, instead of the canned. (I'm not a fan of canned stuff) It was really yummy. Quite warm, and filling. I served it over egg noodles.

This dish was ok, just ok. I agree with the others when they say that it was bland. I even tried adding garlic to the chicken while it fried and it didn't help. i also thought that the soup made it taste a little "earthy", as if it was dirty. Sounds strange but true. I will not be cooking this dish again.

What a delicious change!! Sometimes these quick and easy dishes lack taste but this one has it all! I slow cooked the chicken for 3-3 1/2 hours (I did it this way so that the chicken would be tender) then transferred it to a skillet and continued with the recipe. I also opted to serve mine with mashed potatoes as suggested in another review. My husband (who is leary of "cream" dishes) even paid this recipe a compliment....he had seconds! This is bound to be a new favorite!!

I added one cup of velveeta and omitted the salt.  Very easy and tasty.
