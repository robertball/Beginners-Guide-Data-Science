My husband and I really loved these cookies.  However I added about 1/4 cup of flour after the first batch of cookies came out thin and flat.  The second batch came out thicker and held together better.  I also did not flatten them with a fork and I only put a tablespoon of dough for each cookie.

Yummy!  What a great recipe! The only thing I changed was substituting an entire individual serving cup of applesauce (unsweetened) for the margarine and decreasing the sugar to 2 cups (and i could have even decreased it even further without it hurting the cookie).  However, once i mixed the dough, i realized that i had used rolled oats instead of the quick cooking oats (they were the only ones i had) so i let the dough sit in the fridge for a while so that the oats could absorb some moisture and soften up.  I then baked them (using a smallish ice cream scoop) and they turned out so soft and delicious.  The first tray was undercooked a little, but they had such a lovely melt-in-your-mouth texture, that i wanted the underbake the second batch too, but that one happened to bake perfectly, darnit.  But it was still soft and delicious, just not as tender.  All in all, a great cookie.

I started making and eating these cookies 34 years ago when I was 14 years old!  It is great to see them on AllRecipes.com.  These cookies are great if made correctly (DO NOT ADD FLOUR to these. It will be a whole different final product)!  In 34 years I have never seen one of these as big as a dinner plate.  The best way to make these are to drop by heaping tablespoons(serving, not measuring) or from 1/4 cup measuring cup (packed).  Then only slightly press them down to NO LESS than 1/2 original heigth. Also for variety try M&M's (plain or peanut) instead of chocolate chips and/or chunky peanut butter instead of creamy.  The raisins are also a good idea.  You will LOVE them!!

These were exceptionally easy to make and were really quite tasty. However, they were a bit too chewy for my liking, so the next time I will grind half of the oats for a finer texture. I refrigerated the dough and shaped them into 2 dessertspoon sized rounds. I didn't bother flattening them and they didn't spread much at all.

4 out of 4 people in my house decided that these cookies just weren't that great. I quit after making only about dozen or so. The flavor of these was just off somehow - too much peanut butter maybe? I'm not sure, but being as how our family loves cookies, we know when a recipe isn't  to our liking. These weren't.

Fantastic cookies. For a less sweet flavour, I use butter instead of margarine and natural peanut butter.

Really yummy!  I reduced white and brown sugar to 1 1/4 cups and added 1/4 cup flour.  Just used my cookie scoop to put them on the cookie sheet and didn't flatten at all.  They turned out great!

I didn't think these cookies were going to turn out at first, i'll admit i subsituted one ingredient and that was the peanut butter for pea butter, since i'm alergic to peanuts, and  it's the same thing, but my batter was to dry to make into cookies so i put it in a cake pan with a bit of water and it's still a bit crumbly but good. :D

A wonderful mixture of chewiness and fluffiness. My family adores them. The spices add a great punch.

instead of mashing them thin (with the fork), make BALLS, this way they don't go flat.  they're GREAT cookies, very chewy, and VERY tasty.  everyone loved these.  one of the best batch of cookies i've ever made!

This recipie has been in my family for years but we call them "grandpa's favorite" cookies as my dad loved them!! We use more choc chips and make the cookies smaller. To flaten just dip the bottom of a cup into sugar and press down. Be careful not to overbake they will still appear soft when done.

Really good. I flatten with the bottom of my measuring cup and then put M&M's on top (in smiley face design) before they bake.  I skip the choc. chips.  My stand mixer can barely handle mixing these.

The cookies turned out very well, but they're not the best I've ever had.  A little bit too chewy for my tastes, but I'm not one to turn down a cookie :) Don't use 1/4 cup of dough per cookie unless you a looking to make a truly huge cookie. I used an ice cream scoop (about 2 tbsp) and they're perfect. Try raisins.

After reading some of the comments about the cookies being "thin and the size of a dinner plate", I decided to make a couple of alterations.  First instead of using 1/2 c. butter, I used 1/4 c. butter and 1/4 c.  butter flavored Crisco.  Then instead of dropping them by 1/4 cup size onto the cookie sheet, I used teaspoons so they'd be bite-size.  I know that defeats the purpose of calling them Colossal Cookies.  But they were just tasty!  Thanks for sharing this recipe with us. (In addition I also used M&M's instead of chocolate chips for a little color.)

"Drop 1/4 cupfuls of batter." I don't think so. I dropped BIG rounded tablespoons onto the cookie sheet. They are chewy and good. Nothing special. Mine came out very thin as well as another reviewer stated. Insted of smooshing them down with a fork, I left the last couple batches just as I had plopped them. Better. Why so thin?????

Probably should have read the reviews/recommendations first.  Loved the idea of chocolate chip/oats/peanut butter but mine came out flat and I struggled to get them off the cookie sheet.  We live in high altitude and I thought maybe this recipe wasn't adjusted for that.  I had no idea what to do, decided to add about 1/2 cup flour to the batter, make them smaller-maybe walnut sized, not flatten them and bake 8 3/4" minutes.  They're better.  I'm a soft cookie person so these adjustments seemed to help.  I also did spray my cookie sheet.

I made these to take to a local veterans' home, and they LOVED them!  Next time I will make them half-size though.  Also, I will probably try raisins instead of the chocolate chips.

These are essentially monster cookies, which I love. I agree with others, 1/4 cup levelled is enough, don't flatten them too much. I give it 4 stars because I made two changes: I substituted 1/2 cup mashed bananas for the margarine and used 2 cups packed brown and only 1/2 cup white sugar.I also threw in a tablespoon of ground flax. Wonderful! Also a silicone bakers liner makes removal so simple.

I just made these this weekend and boy were they ever good. The recipe made a huge batch. I mixed them with my stand mixer and the batter almost spilled over. I brought a bunch to work and they were gone in seconds. I didn't add chocolate chips because my dog has to be able to eat everything I make, otherwise I get the sad, puppy dog face. They were really good.

LOVED THESE! I sent them with my husband when he went to hang out with his friends, and they all went crazy for them! I used creamy PB, because that was all I had, and they were still good. Can't wait to make these again.

These are even better with M&M's instead of chocolate chips! LOVE THEM!

These were good but a bit overwhelming.  I used an ice cream scoop to make a smaller cookie and they were still huge.  They were overly sweet and salty because of the peanut butter.  If you like a cookie with a lot of flavor, then these are for you!

Wow!  This is such a great recipe.  My husband watched me make them and said, "Oh gross!  They have too much stuff.  They are going to be disgusting."  Well...we both LOVE them!  I wonder if some people did not look at the peanut butter close enough.  My jar was 18 oz.  I scooped some off the top and guessed about 16 oz.  If I had put the whole thing in, I think they would have spread all over.  I also stick the bowl in the fridge inbetween panfulls.  They are very good cookies.

I dont know what the people who rated this a 5 are used to eating but this is NOT A GOOD COOKIE! Let me explain, I made this for my kids as a thank you for all the hard work they had done this weekend. They asked me what they were being punished for? I said punished for? you called getting cookies a punishment? They said if that was a cookie they didn't want cookies no more! I had to try one to see what was wrong and I have to agree if these were laying around I would never break my diet! They went straight to the trash can and I will have to think twice about ever trying a recipe from here again as this was my first one ever!!!

Cookies are tasty!  Certainly worth making.  I agree that there is too much sugar in the recipe, however it is not the sweetness that bothers me, but the fact that you cannot cream the butter and sugar.  I will try adding an extra stick of butter next time. The dough does not stand alone, but relies on the oats and peanut butter to hold it together and is fairly gritty.  This would be a difficult recipe to play with for sure, but the cookies turn out VERY rich and chewy! Yumm...

Colossal is an understatement.  My first batch was the size of dinner plates.  I think I went a little overboard with the batter.  Everyone at work loved them still.

Really easy to make. I only made half a batch and got over 3 dozen. If I make them again, I’ll put less sugar. I found them really sweet. Plus I used natural pb. They were a big hit.

These were delicious.  The only change I made was leaving out the chocolate chips and using old fashion oats because that is what I have. All my friends raved about how good they were. I will definitely make them again. Except I am going to get some quick oats the next time.
I made small teaspoon sized cookies and they retained their shape. Baked for about 8 minutes.

I didn't make huge cookies- subbed butter for the margarine and used smooth peanut butter. I also added a tsp. of caramel extract-

One of the best peanut butter & oatmeal cookies I've ever had! They are moist, chewy, and delicious! I used another reviewers suggestion and cut the white and brown sugars to 1 1/4 cups each and I added 1/2 cup of flour. Then I added a mashed banana, 1 tsp salt, and increased chocolate chips to 1 2/3 cups. Instead of 1/4 cup sized balls, I dropped large tablespoon sized balls and cooked for 12 minutes. They turned out perfect. Because I was using a large container of extra chunky peanut butter (2 lb, 8 oz jar), instead of a 16 oz container, I put half the jar in the recipe. So I used about 20 oz of peanut butter and they were great. But I love recipes that are not really sweet and have more of a peanut butter taste. I will definitely continue using this recipe.

It needed salt, but other than that, it was delicious.  It was a great way to use up all my extra oatmeal, and since it made a lot, I didn't feel guilty making each cookie really BIG.  When I first made them, I was pregnant, and with the amount of eggs and peanut butter, it was a quick and tasty excuse to get protein and  satisfy the "I just want a really big cookie" craving.  Plus, (as a result of using so much peanut butter) it's one of the few cookie recipes I've found that doesn't way over-do the butter.

I honestly wouldn't even give this recipe one star...but that is the only option.  The cookies turned out awful.  Don't let the 5 star reviews fool you.  Gross.  That pretty much sums it up.  I regret eating the one bite I ate.

Easy to make and not bad tasting BUT there needs to be a warning that they come out of the oven the size of dinner plates!  Also, the batter spreads so thin that it's hard to remove the cookies from the cookie sheet without it falling apart.  Two recommendations: DON'T use 3/4 cup of batter for each cookie (halve it, at least) and drop them on cookie sheet covered with foil - that way they "peel off" when they've cooled.

These cookies stay chewy for days, and are a big hit for young and old alike.  They don't cook as well when using insulated cookie sheets, and the large size of the cookie also makes a difference.

Recipe went over very well with my coworkers and girlfriend.  It was easy to make, but did get somewhat messy so I would keep that in mind if you were going to have children make it.  Overall a very good cookie.

Oh my! These are the best cookies I have ever had! 
They are chewy and hearty and soooo tasty! 
I took these to work with me and they disappeared in a flash.
They have since been requested many, many times.
Try white chocolate chips, too.
-also-
There really is no flour in them, in case
you were afraid it was a misprint.
