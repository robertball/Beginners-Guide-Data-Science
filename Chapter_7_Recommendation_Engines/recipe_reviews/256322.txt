Yummy dish! Followed the receipe with couple additions. I added bamboo shoots,8oz can drained and one red pepper julienned. I had to use red curry paste.. used about 2 1/2 teaspoons. I kept adjusting to taste. We like things spicy so I wasa little heavy on the items that provide heat. I wish I would have sautéed mushrooms prior to adding tomatoes. I also used fresh l basil, chopped up about 8 leaves. Served over jasmine brown rice. Sprinkled a few green onions chopped on top of dish

Great recipe using things I had on hand.  I thought the broth could have used a bit of sugar, otherwise enjoyed the depth of flavors.  I didn’t have enough shrimp so I also added chicken and left the meat in while cooking the rest of the ingredients since I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh.  We ate it over Basmati rice.  Kids and hubby gave it a thumbs up!

I followed the recipe and had curry powder brought to me by a friend from Thailand but I was disappointed by the recipe.  Definitely need more vegetables and I expected more heat given the description.  Amp up the heat and I think I should have used a bit more curry powder.  I might also cut down a bit on the chicken broth, to watery.  Make sure you add the cilantro & lime.

The only changes I made were fresh tomatoes instead of canned and dried basil instead of fresh Thai basil. I served it over light brown rice. It was mildly spicy and delicious! I did not use cilantro because my husband hates it, but I would have liked it even better with cilantro... next time I will either garnish mine with cilantro or I will add some ground coriander, which tastes similar to cilantro leaves to me without tasting like soap to my husband.

This was absolutely delicious.  It also makes quite a generous amount of sauce so feel free to add extra shrimp and mushrooms.  Nice heat, really tasty.

Very good. Family liked it. Needed more curry favour for my liking. Next time I’ll add green Thai curry paste.

Fantastic flavor. I purchased cooked, deveined, shell removed shrimp. I added the cooked shrimp to the onion, garlic and ginger to warm them. The only other substitution I made was using Thai Red Curry paste, same measurement, as my store did not sell curry powder.  This will become a common quick dinner meal.

My family loved it!  We followed the recipe pretty  closely but added green onions and shredded carrots.  Also, if you like spicy you'll have to add a little more crushed red pepper.  We did 1/2 teaspoon instead of 1/8 and it still was just a kick!

Just the right amount of heat.  Next time, I will add more vegetables as there is lots of sauce.

This was yummy!  We added some red peppers and fresh tomato, and used curry powder that a friend brought us from India.  The Thai basil from the garden was the finishing touch!  This certainly has a "kick", but was very enjoyable.  This is now saved as a favorite!

Great recipe! You get a lot of flavor from this dish in a short amount of time. It's creamy, rich, hearty and customizably spicy. I substituted eggplant for the mushrooms (not a mushroom fan) but otherwise made as is. Okay, I might have raised the roof on the 'with a kick' ...just sayin'.

I made this last night and added my own twist on it, put in some colorful sweet peppers and asparagus. It turned out awesome, however I hate measuring and just dump stuff in, so mine turned out a little extra spicy and wish it had just a bit more coconut milk. That was only because I didn't measure and made a much bigger batch than this recipe called for. Can't wait to try it again, it was a hit!

This is really good, but I made a few modifications to suit what we had on hand. I sub'd chicken for the shrimp, added in red bell peppers, and didn't use any cayenne (we have little ones that can't do spicy). The end result was flavorful, but the sauce was really thin. Next time I'll add in some cornstarch to thicken up the sauce, because we will definitely be making this again.

Basically followed the recipe--used dried spices instead of fresh and used coconut cream to taste as I did not have coconut milk at the time.  Also added some diced bell pepper and steamed fresh green beans.This was very good. I will definitely make this in the future. I think you could add any vegetables you have around to make a healthy dish AND clean out the frig! We like spicy, but the amount of heat can be adjusted for your personal preference.

I just made this recipe for the first time. The flavor was good, and spicy enough for my son-in-law who likes things spicy. The only surprise to me was that the sauce is thinner than I expected. But now looking at the photo again, I see that my sauce did look like the picture.

We enjoyed this curry.  We added some extra veggies (carrots, red pepper & kale) and used a few less shrimp, but other than that followed the other ingredients.  Definitely a keeper.  Hunts diced tomatoes were one less thing to chop and delicious.

My husband and I LOVE Thai food. Kim's recipe did not disappoint! I did not deviate from the recipe by even a grain of salt! The spices are spot on and the Hunt's diced tomatoes were bright and fresh tasting, superior from store brands. While Thai curries tend to be more runny than let's say Indian curries, I would start with 1/4 cup of the chicken stock and then add more to taste and texture. I used my own stock which is full bodied and a nice compliment to the dish. Thank you, Kim, for a 'winner, winner, Thai dinner'!
