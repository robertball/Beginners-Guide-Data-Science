I used sugar free devils food chocolate cake mix and 3/4 cup melted butter with the strawberry pie filling.  Very good.  Will fix this again.

this came out better then i thought it would. I had to double the recipe because my slow cooker was to big. Gave my daughter some with ice cream and she loved it.

Super easy to make but for me, it was much too sweet.  If you have a sweet tooth maybe you'll rate it higher than i did.

This dessert was great. It is very sweet. I only made half of the recipe. The cake dough wasn't crumbly for me, but once it was done it was fine.
