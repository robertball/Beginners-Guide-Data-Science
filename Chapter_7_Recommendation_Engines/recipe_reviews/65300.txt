I posted a review of this recipe yesterday and want to add a couple notes. Since I make a large bowl of this for a crowd, I really don't measure...just do it to taste. But I do use a 4 oz container of the Feta. Also I use red onion sliced, for more color and to sweeten it just a little, add some honey to the Balsamic, to taste.I also slice the cucumbers instead of chopping. If this salad is made in advance, I put the olive oil in last after marinating all the other ingredients in the fridge

Fantanstic Recipe!!  I tripled the recipe to feed about 15 people.  The only change I made was to use purple onion in place of the green onions.  I think its prettier and the onions tend to be sweeter after marinading in the vinegar and oil.  I also made this one day before serving BUT did NOT add the feta until just prior to serving.  This allowed the salad to marinate and take on that wonderful balsamic taste!!  It was awesome and everyone loved it!!  Thank you.

Excellent!  Instead of romas, I used tomatoes from the garden, which I seeded, and I used blue cheese instead of feta.  Also used coarsely chopped red onion instead of green onions.  The substitutions I made, I'm sure, were incidental to the final yum of the salad.  It's the perfect combination of balsamic, olive oil and fresh basil that makes this an outstanding salad.

This could easily become a summertime habit! Roma tomatoes have been particularly red and ripe lately in our groceries, and with a plentiful supply of basil in my garden I could eat this healthy, light, flavorful salad every day. I didn't peel the cucumbers, but to prevent excess liquid as the salad sat I seeded both the cucumbers and the tomatoes.  I think with the extra green of the cucumber peel, and getting rid of that not particularly attractive "guts," that it made this salad especially pretty.  The green onion provided just the slightest bit of bite, but not as much as regular onion would, which I appreciated.  This really is a a more delicately flavored salad.  In keeping with that, I used fresh lemon juice rather than balsamic vinegar, which I prefer when I want a lighter dressing.  At the last minute I tossed in some chopped ripe avocado when I remembered I had one and it really added so much creamy contrast in texture.  I loved it.  And I loved this salad.

Delicious!  Very good and very refreshing!  I love the combination of tomato, basil and feta.  I used cherry tomatoes that I cut in half lenghtwise and replaced the green onions with red. I aso added a little bit of oregano for a little extra touch of herbs.

A  great way to use my garden veggies and herbs! I used sweet baby cherry tomatoes instead of romas. I also removed the seeds from the cucumber, sprinkled the two halves with salt and turned upside down to drain for a few minutes before slicing. A nice summer salad.

Greek salad with basil basically, as i used red onions instead of green. the basil over powers the taste though so i think i will stick with the "good for you greek salad" instead.

Our tomato and cucumber crops are booming, and this recipe jumped out at me.  I plucked some basil out of the garden and whipped this up, and it was very good.  I forgot the green onions, but it was fine without.  The recipe would be good tossed with salad greens, too.

This is a delicious and refreshing salad.  I prepared everything the day before serving and refrigerated.  Just before serving, I added the feta cheese.  The only changes I made were to add extra feta (about 1/3 cup), use beefsteak tomatoes (seeded) in place of roma, and purple onion in place of the scallions.  (I also didn't fully peel my cucumbers, but left some strips of green on them for the added color.)  I made these substitutions in order to use what I had on hand.  The fresh basil definitely adds the finishing touch to this salad.  I would recommend using white balsamic vinegar, if available, to keep the colors of the veggies bright.  This is a GREAT recipe and we'll be using it often!

This is the Queen of salads for me and my family for the summer when the tomatoes are ripe and sweet!
Basil is a must, we love the taste, we add some oregano also, preferably fresh, and some black olives.
It can be served without the feta cheese, if you are watching your diet. Purple onion is the best for this salad. Thank you for a great salad.

I made this when I had fresh basil and feta cheese in the fridge that had to be used up.  It was excellent.  I didn't have roma tomatoes on hand so I used regular tomatoes instead.  I served this with fresh homemade whole wheat bread for a light meal on a hot summer night.

We really enjoyed this salad tonight with our Chicken Cesar Wraps. I added lemon juice and onions, but forgot the pepper. :) I thought the splash of all the tastes went together super awesomely!

Very easy. Very good. I used grape tomatoes cut in 1/2 - also next time I will reduce the amount of oil. (I increased the amount of vinegar to get the flavour I wanted.)

Nice taste & a good way to use fresh garden tomatoes.  I served it a few hours after I made it, therefor there was alot of juice.  The next time I will make it right before we eat it.

This is a fabulous caprese style salad.  This salad will only be as good as the ingredients that you use.  I used high quality balsamic vinegar, olive oil and the veggies and basil were from my garden.  I especially liked it made in advanced and served after the flavors had a chance to meld. This is so delicious and healthy and perfect served with Italian bread.

Good salad and needs full quantity of feta. Like the contributor pointed out it is better to add the oil at the end. I use white balsamic vinegar and a touch of honey and also cut oil back about 1 tbsp.

FAB-u-lous! Used grape tomatoes along with red onions, cucumbers & fresh asparagus. No fresh basil on hand, so used dry and had to add a bit of honey (my balsamic vinegar wasn't the best) and marinated everything except feta cheese for about 5 hours b4 serving. LOVED it! Will make again & again this summer, using fresh basil!

Definitely a good side dish, but for me the amount of work-to-payoff ratio wasn't ideal, my expectations were a bit higher.

One of my favorite type of salads. I could eat this everyday! To save on calories I used a fat free balsamic vinaigrette, just a dash of olive oil, and fat free feta. Turned out excellent.

This was a great recipe.  I used regular tomatoes, red onion instead of green, and added black olives.  Next time I will have to double the recipe, because it disappeared so quickly.  Thanks VancGirl2!

If you follow the recipe as written, it's very light and refreshing and perfect for those hot summer nights.  I've made this several times and it's always delicious and just right when you're not in the mood to eat something heavy.  Unfortunately we ate it before I thought to take a photo.

It was okay but nothing I would make again ... served it to company and there was lots left so they obviously felt the same.

I LOVE this recipe! I would suggest only making as much as you expect to eat at one meal. I don't think it kept well.

Made this last night and my husband thought I had become an instant gourmet. He was so impressed and we polished it off in a heartbeat. Just made more and it is just as good! I prefer to not peel cucumbers, so I left mine peeled and I love it! Bring this to a dinner or someplace you want to impress people - you will be a superstar! And fresh basil makes all the difference. Just started an herb garden and the use of fresh herbs is like comparing a school cafeteria's turkey dinner to your mom's Thanksgiving:-)

Delicious!  A great simple, satisfying side dish. I will be making this weekly during the summer with my homegrown veggies and herbs. I think I will add more tomatoes as I used grape tomatoes.

DELICIOUS! The type of balsamic vinegar makes a HUGE difference - get the best quality vinegar you can afford because it makes a world of difference in the flavor!

this recipe was the best, I had plenty of grape tomato and basil in the garden and needed to something with it all. The only thing I did diffrent was to add some bell pepper (plenty in the garden as well) I also added the red oion that some one else mentioned, and added the feta at the very end, wounderfull!

This recipe was very good. I made double using 12 roma tomatoes and 2 med-large cucumbers the day before, and then added the feta the next day. Substituted 1 large red onion for the green onions. Might add sliced olives next time!

Just delicious. Fast to throw together, healthy and very pretty to look at too. I scale back a bit on the oil, but otherwise make as the recipe calls for. I also generally use a low fat or fat free feta as well.

Made this for a BBQ side dish.  Tastes almost like a salsa.  Really delicious.  We used heirloom tomatoes and purple onion.  I also increased the amount of feta.   Perfect dish for a "from the garden" recipe!

Fantastic!! The basil is amazing and I loved the scallions in it - gave it such a nice flavor. We added avocado for some extra creaminess. Yum!

This was pretty good, however I would omit the green onion next time.  It was way too strong and overpowered the dish.  I de-seeded the cucumber and tomatoes to make for a pretty presentation.  Overall, this is a great, refreshing salad and I will make it again.

Perfect as is. We don't change a thing unless we don't have an ingredient. Just the usual substitutions: cherry tomatoes, any kind of basil (in jar or dried). The cucumbers don't stay fresh very long, so I usually add them about 30 minutes before serving. One of our favorites.

This was pretty good - used red onion instead of scallions and upped the feta.  Did not use all of the dressing - too much especially when the moisture starts coming out of the cukes and tomatoes.  Quick and easy though and good for a summer side.

Very delicious! Great for hot summer days! I used a red onion in place of the green onions because it was what I had on hand. I liked the sweetness of the red onion anyway. I made this with the balsamic vinegar but think I will try it next time with some lemon juice for a lighter taste.

This was quick, easy and SO tasty! I had to substitute cider vinegar for balsamic, as I didn't have any but it was still really good. Will definitely make again WITH balsamic vinegar.  I also chopped up a few black olives and added them for a little something extra.

This was great! I used small grape tomatoes instead of chopped tomatoes. This is excellent for summertime BBQs.

Easy to prepare summer salad, I followed the recipe exactly other than adding a small amount of cold cooked Tulette pasta.  The overall taste was ok, but I just thought there was a little something missing

It was OK, I liked it but I like cukes and tomatoes...definitely very easy to make. The family was so-so about it.

I enjoyed this, it had good flavor.  I would make it when reday to serve, or at least wait to add the oil & vinegar as it got a bit mushy.

Delightful ... high fives all around.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except for using a pint of cherry tomatoes (halved) in place of Roma and a fairly large English cucumber (with seeds scraped out).  Next time, I will try white balsamic vinegar, as the dark really does discolor the cucumbers.  Thanks for this recipe, which we will make often!

I used crumbled goat cheese instead of feta, because of a sodium restriction,  I also added a couple of pinches of dill for flavor.  Really good and a nice change from a tossed salad.

A nice healthy recipe.  Easy to fix and tasty!  I did take one of the suggestions and added about a little honey to the oil and vinegar.  I am certain I will be making this again.

Excellent flavor!  I used a dried packet of garlic and herb dressing with vinegar and oil instead of the dressing.  We don't care for green onions, so I skipped them, but it was still delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

This was a great recipe. I had to do major improvising because i was working with what I had available. I used cherry and lemon boy tomatoes, Fresh basil, and peppers (in place of Onion). Since I used all the feta the other day I substituted Romano and also added Green Olives instead of salt. Tastes fresh and fabulous!

This recipe saved  my dinner!   We  needed a salad to go with our roast beef dinner.  I  had all the ingredients except cucumber, including fresh basil growing on my winter windowsill.  The only thing that could have made it better would have been tomatoes just picked from the garden.

Wonderful!!!  I also added black olives and red onion.  I didn't add the oil and vinegar until about 30 minute before serving.  Be sure to salt and pepper to taste.  I will be making this again and again.  I can't wait for the veggies from my garden:)

This is such a great recipe to use when there are bountiful seasonal vegetables.  I love foods with bursts of color, so I also added in chopped yellow and orange bell pepper, and chopped asparagus.  Also used red onion instead of green per others' suggestions.  And, per my own preference used kosher salt, then did the balsamic vinegar and oil to taste.  Wonderful!

We had our friends come in from Boston and I made this salad just as the recipe calls and everyone loved it.  Their daughter Urvi asked if she could have the rest as she just loved it.  Thank you for a great tasting, easy to make salad.

Very nice, refreshing flavor. Easy and quick to prepare. Will make again. Used regular homegrown tomatoes instead of Romas and followed the recipe exactly.

Fabulous!  I made it last minute just to add a salad to our dinner.  Even those who do not eat cucumber or tomato or feta had second helpings!  Only additional thing  added was fresh parsley.

very good. I used my heirloom garden tomatoes in various colors and a regular onion since that is what I had on hand. I didn't use as much basil based on other reviews.

Admittedly I changed this recipe, but came up with something that we really liked.  I just eyeballed the ingredients, using tomatoes, no cucumber, green onions, fresh basil, Italian salad dressing, feta and toasted almonds.  The second time I made it the same way, only subbing toasted pine nuts for the almonds.  I'm sure the olive oil and balsamic vinegar called for in the recipe would be wonderful as well and I may do that  next time.  I like this best when served at room temperature.  We'll be making this a lot this summer with fresh tomatoes from the garden.  UPDATE 7/12/15 -I made this again last night, but followed the recipe more closely than before.  This time I layered the tomatoes and cucumbers and then sprinkled them with green onions, basil and feta.  Just before serving, I drizzled it with the dressing indicated in the recipe.  I did use vegetable oil instead of olive oil, as I often think EVOO is too strong and predominant in a salad dressing.  This had great flavor and I will certainly do this one again.  Although I do love balsamic vinegar, in a recipe like this, the dark balsamic can make the appearance of your salad rather unappealing.  A possibility would be to try white balsamic vinegar.

Made this last night for a large group of people. I did quite a bit of tweaking, though. I omitted onions all together (because I don't like onions). I lessened the ratio of oil/vinegar to the salad portion, and I added diced orange and yellow peppers. Overall turned out pretty good, even for someone who doesn't like vinegar at all.

I made this last night w/o the recipe in front of me so it only had cucumber, heritage small tomatoes halved, feta (tiny cubes), fresh basil and fresh oregano. I poured Garlic Expressions over the top and added some good Balsamic vinegar. It was by far, the best salad imaginable!!! Without the onions and olives it became a brand new taste! Both my husband and I thought it was terrific! Thanks!!

Great recipe. Wonderful flavors. I slice and salt tomatoes then allow to drain on paper towels before chopping. Mix everything, let the flavors marinate in the fridge and add the feta just prior to serving.

Nice side dish to my grilled pork chop tonight!  3PP per serving using only 2 Tbls of EVOO instead of 3. I used 2 medium sized tomatoes and 1 large cucumber, because that's what I had on hand.  Will make again!  Thanks!

I forgot to add the basil and even without it this is delicious.  I made the dish the night before and that gave the flavors time to meld together.  I can't wait to make this again and add the basil because I am sure that will make it even more wonderful

Fantastic refreshing salad that is easy and quick to prepare.  We took this to our neighbor's house and the French wife and Dutch husband adored it and had thirds.  I made it without the cuke as mine had gone off and threw in an extra tomato.  I also only put in 2 T olive oil as I was worried about the dressing being too much without cuke.  I put in some white onion as I didn't have purple or green on hand.  I've gotta make this again!

The fresh basil was very strong, only used a little bit, and I thought the balsamic vinegar was much too strong for me.. I might use this without the basil and use red wine vinegar instead...I love all the other ingredients, vinegar was just too much :S

Excellent.  I dressed the tomatos with the vinegar first to let it soak before adding anything else.

I used baby tomatos and cut in half.

Very good. I added honey to the oil and vinegar as other reviewers mentioned and added some greens I purchased from the supermarket salad bar.  I served with whole wheat salad pockets and hummus and we all stuffed our own salad pockets.  I also had corn on the cob on the side and everyone (especially my husband) loved it.  It was a nice change from the normal dinners I make.  It was healthy, light and filling.  Thank you VANCGIRL2.  I will be making this again and again for sure.

This was a delicious and easy salad.  I made it exactly as the recipe said - only sprinkling a little more balsamic on it as I love balsamic vinegar.  Will make again this summer.  Yummy.

Terrific makeover salad.  I add any other veggies too except lettuce or spinach. I have also used Italian, Ceasar,  or Blue Cheese dressing on this. Any vegetable can  make this.  I always get requests for it for the pot lucks but...my family eats it by the bucket fulls during the summer...!

Great flavor! We aren't big fans of tomatoes, but the flavor this simple salad has even had us loving the tomatoes.  Delicious!

tried but could not find basil leaves...used spinach leaves instead and sprinkled basil on instead.  I also added a tad more balsamic vinegar! My Mom, Step Dad loved...was part of an impromptu pre-birthday lunch :)

This was alright, but not great. Although balsamic tastes great, it tends to spoil the look of salads, in my opinion. This salad would be improved by adding something like toasted pine nuts. Thanks!

I didn't have roma tomatoes so used cherry tomatoes instead. I let the salad sit in the fridge for a couple of hours then added the feta just before serving. We really liked the balsamic dressing. Thankyou Vancgirl 2

I thought the vinegar flavor in this was overpowering, much as I liked the idea and the ingredients. If I make it again, I will use half or less of the vinegar called for.

good, quick and easy.  I cut the tomatoes into thin wedges, and this salad takes all of 10  minutes (if that) to make before it's on the table.  I left out the onions bc we don't like them raw and otherwise kept it the same.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderful summer salad. Perfect to make while everything is ripening in the garden. I've had a mozzarella version of tomato & basil salad but really enjoy the feta. My 9yr old daughter liked this salad too.

My 6 year-old did all the chopping to make this (her favorite salad from the grocery store).  We didn't have onions on hand so just skipped it.  I didn't have fresh basil, only dried (I halved it) and it was still very good.  Great simple recipe.

This was delicious just like I knew it would be!! I used a little less oil, more vinegar (both red wine and balsamic) red onions instead of green and added a can of rinsed black beans so we could eat it as a low calorie but satisfying salad for lunch! Amazingly fresh and yummy, perfect for summer! I'll be making this one again and again and might add some minced garlic next time.

Excellent recipe- it always goes over well.  My SO doesn't like feta, so I substitute fresh mozzarella if she will be having any.  Another note- if I'm using feta, I generally do not add it until shortly before serving.

Excellent!  Happened to have a plethora of mixed cherry tomatoes on hand because of my garden so used a pint of those halved in place of 6 romas.  Delicious, simple flavor perfect for summer entertaining.  Thanks for sharing!  I will be making this again as long as we have this abundance of tasty summer vegetable ingredients.

My whole family loves this recipe.  Instead of Roma tomatoes, I used a variety of tomatoes from my garden: purple cherokees, lemon tomatoes, green striped, Early Girls, etc.  It made a beautiful salad with lots of great flavor!

I was looking for a recipe to use some of my garden veggies with. Absolutely loved this recipe and as another reviewer suggested I will triple it next time. I made it according to recipe and it turned out great, although I didn't salt it enough for fear of oversalting it. So I threw in a little McCormick Vegatable Supreme seasoning after realizing it and it gave it a nice flavor as well.

I made this when my son was coming over. I don’t measure. But my son says he only likes potato salad he’s not especially fond of cucumbers. When he ate it he said great potato salad mom. So I think that means it was good.

This was okay as cold summer side dish.  It wasn't spectacular, just okay.  And easy to put together so that gets it three stars.  Probably won't repeat.

I've made this salad so many times I can't even count. The only thing I'd change is instead of making the dressing, you can just go buy Kraft Greek Feta & Oregano Dressing and use that. I find that if you're not a balsamic vinegar fan then try this dressing out.

I used grape tomatoes, basil and cucumbers from our garden and the flavor just tasted like summer! So good! Instead of feta cheese (since my hubby is not a feta fan), I used fresh mozzarella pearls and drizzled olive oil and red wine vinegar...it was a big hit at a party last night! I will make this again and again!

I am giving this five stars because it most likely deserves it.  I did not make it as written, but only because I was browsing and looking for similar recipes for the ingredients that I had.  I love all of the ingredients  in the recipe and hope that you will enjoy and/or employ it  with other ingredients.

What a great marriage of flavors!  The feta cheese is wonderful in this salad, as is the fresh basil with the tomatoes.  Both hubby and I agreed this was well worth making again.  And again....

I made a small amount of this, but forgot the onions & Feta, and decided not to use olive oil. It was very good, but after I added Feta to the last few bites the  salad tasted better. Simple and satisfying with garden-fresh basil, tomatoes, and cucumbers!

I didn't care for this as much as I thought I would.  I think it was the balsamic that ruined it for me.  I love balsamic, but I didn't really think it went well in this.  I would try this again, but using lemon juice or white vinegar instead of the balsamic.

Only change was to use dried basil and oregano instead of fresh  basil - and only did that because the store didn't have fresh basil.  It was really good.  I'm sure it's excellent with fresh basil too.  Am excited to make this again.

EASY FAST GREAT.  I love this salad and eat it many to every lunch lately. I add  1/2 advocado when I can. Going to try the 
lemon juice tip  from Naples  today. I always have a 
pre-made hard boiled egg on side. ILoveIt.

Great fresh salad. I used cherry tomatoes cut in half and English cucumber because I like the taste better. I only used half the oil and vinegar and it was plenty.

Yum! Added some red onions. Was super yummy and filling. My fiance doesn't like feta cheese so I did not include that. Also just used balsamic vinaigrette instead of balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

This salad was excellent! The first time I try a recipe I try to follow it exactly but this time I used fresh basil because it is growing very well in my garden. The flavors melded very nicely. It's easy to make. My husband loved it also. It is a keeper.

Being in India it's hard to get Feta Cheese. I replaced it with sauteed Paneer. The result - Awesome!

Love this recipe. I use fresh Basil and  Green onion from my garden. The fresh  veggies make this a wonderful salad. The Basil is strong in this salad, but if you love the flavor of Basil you will enjoy this recipe as I did!

Since I've made this recipe about 6 times this summer with our garden tomatoes, cukes and basil, I have to give it 5 starts.  I've added orzo, I've added peppers, I've added kalamata olives.  All awesome.  I will say I use less olive oil and more cukes that it calls for.

Don't use too much feta or it will overpower the rest of the delish flavors.

I am in love with this salad.  We have an abundance of cherry and grape tomatoes this time of year and we're all a little tired of them.  I have made this salad at least five times in the last two weeks to use up our surpluss of tomatoes and it is absolutely delicious.  I left out the olives since I'm not a fan but stayed true to the rest of the recipe.  Definately a keeper!

Added more cucumbers and cut the oil.  My husband raved :-)  And I (who hate cucumbers) loved it too.

This was a great salad for using veggies from my garden. I used a cucumber I grew as well as basil, and two types of cherry tomatoes, a brandywine, and some orange tomatoes that gave the salad some color. I also used a walla walla onion and I only had Parmesan. I may need to go buy some feta just to remake this salad!

Very nice salad. I used a bit more feta than called for. Next time I may try zucchini in place of cucumber for a less watery salad. I take these to work, so they sit for a while :)

A great cool, crunchy salad for summer, and it went together very quickly. I served the dressing on the side to please everyone in my crowd, and the salad was okay without it. But, in my opinion the dressing gives it that extra zing so I wouldn't recommend skipping it!

This was good.  I need to make a few more times and play around with the amounts of oil and vinegar to get it at 5 stars, as is it was a little too much of both.

I thought this recipe was really plain so I used this recipe as a base to make my own spin off. I used tomato, cucumber and basil as the base. However, I also added jalapeños, olives, salad leafs, lemon juice, parsley, scallions as well as balsamic vinaigrette with EVOO

I loved this! It's like a caprese salad, only with way more flavor.  One of my new favorites!
