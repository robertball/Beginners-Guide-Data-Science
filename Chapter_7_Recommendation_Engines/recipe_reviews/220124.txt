This turned out great! Based on other reviews, we reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and only used about 2/3 of a package of rice noodles. We probably could have reduced the sugar a little bit more. I also added soy sauce to the sauce which I think it needed. We used chicken broth instead of beef broth. We didn't have green onions or cilantro to put on top like traditional pad Thai, but we did top it with crushed peanuts. This was amazing for our first attempt at pad Thai.

Super tasty.  But FAR far far too much sugar.  I read the reviews before I made this and followed the advice to reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup and fish sauce down to 5 tablespoons.  It was STILL far too sweet and salty for me. I'd use 1/4 cup of sugar and 3 tablespoons of fish sauce at first, THEN you can always taste it and add more if you need. It was a bit to 'soupy' for me too, so next time I will only use 1 cup of water in my chicken broth mix.

My husband said this "blew it out of the park." It was very yummy. I couldn't find bean sprouts so I put shredded carrots in. I only used half the heat and substituted chicken broth instead of beef. This was great.

This is the best pad thai recipe that I have found.  I did make a couple changes based on looking at other pad thai recipes and personal taste.  I used rice wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar because it is what I had in the pantry.  I also used a tablespoon of lime juice in place of one of the tablespoons of vinegar and added a little bit of soy sauce to cut the sweetness.  I think next time I will use honey or agave in place of half of the sugar.  I added quite a bit of red pepper flakes and some sriracha because we like it hot!  Otherwise, this is a wonderful recipe....a great basic pad thai recipe that you can amend to your taste.

I used oyster sauce instead of fish sauce and creole seasoning and red pepper flakes instead of cayenne and it was fantastic! Definitely would recommend doing this recipe! It's not too spicy and is similar to an African peanut chicken dish I love.

Everyone but one kid loves this however I still have not gotten the noodles done perfectly. This is not authentic, but as the title says a Fusion. I've tried other Pad Thai recipes and this is the one the rest of the family likes the most. I'll keep trying this and new ones.

This took a lot of prep. I followed the recipe with two exceptions - I used udon noodles in place of rice noodles and omitted the cayenne since I have kiddos. It was pretty good. One kid liked it and the other didn't. There also seemed to be a lot of sauce so if I make this again I may have to reduce the beef broth to only 1 cup.

4.5 stars from me -- I might reduce the sugar just a bit, and use 2T of soynut butter instead of one.  Then again, I made a *lot* of noodles.

Although probably not very authentic, it had a great flavor! Be careful not to overcook the rice noodles or they become mushy.
I also added cilantro, and sprinkled it with lime juice before serving. It would also benefit from some crushed peanuts on top and shrimp stirred through.

Have to admit, I was a little sceptical when I started preparing this dish . . . but LOVED the results!  Followed the recipe to a T - until the end and I added Peanuts along with the Green Onions.  A little Cilantro would also be nice.  Served with a squeeze of Lime - Delish!  Thanks for the recipe!  (Even my family liked it and they are not quite as adventurous as I.)

Made it according to the directions but didn't have any fish sauce so used oyster sauce.  It was all delicious.  Might cut down a bit on the cayenne next time only because my kids thought it was a bit spicy although I thought that it had a the perfect balance of spice.  Will make again.

Absolutely FANTASTIC!!! I made 3 changes-2 for health and 1 for personal preference-but I'd bet the original recipe is just as awesome. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and only 1/2 tsp cayanne pepper so it wouldn't be too hot for my kids (3 & 1). Again, it is FANTASTIC!!

A little on the sweet side for me but overall pretty tasty and quick to prepare. Great weeknight dinner. *reduced sugar to 1/2 cup and fish sauce to 5 tbsps.

I made this nearly as written, and we think it's a keeper.  I discovered I had no fish sauce (where did it go?), but even without it, my family and I really enjoyed the mix of flavors.  We will be using this recipe again.  Thank you, Joe!

This was very easy to make and delicious!! A bit spicy due to the cayenne so adjust accordingly if you are sensitive to heat. I only ended up using half of the noodles and an entire bag of bean sprouts, probably 1 1/2-2cups. It was enough for 5-6 people so I couldn't picture putting more noodles in there. I had a handful of spinach I wanted to get rid of so I threw it in there too at the end. I hated the smell of the fish sauce on its own but it worked great with the other ingredients. A keeper!

Didn't have all the ingredients, so I had to improvise. Also, used gluten free noodles. I sautéed the garlic, put canned chicken in (to save time), stirred in an egg, mixed in peanut butter, poured over cooked noodles, stirred in white vinegar, a bit of walnut oil, added chives, sugar, salt & pepper. Was really delicious. Didn't mean to change it, but it sounded so good, I had to make it!

Tasted good but takes longer than the recipe says. I found the noodles were a little too soft for my liking, but that may be because I had to cook it for more than 10 minutes with the broth to thicken it up enough to eat.

This was delicious. Since I didn’t have chicken on hand I used shrimp! Used half the cayenne to accommodate my little ones. Will definitely prepare again!  I will try less sugar next time to compare the taste just to try and cut back in calories. Thanks so much!

When  I made this as per the recipe my wife thought it had too many noodles.  Now  I use 11/2 lbs of chicken breast pieces and only 3/4 lb of noodles and 11/2 cups of beef broth.  Also,  instead of the bean sprouts I add 1 cup of frozen peas and 1 cup of peeled, diced carrots.  This makes it much richer tasting, meatier, and more colourful and appetizing.  It is a complete meal by itself.  Garlic dill pickles make a good accompaniment with it.

It has a lovely flavour.  I would add the sprouts as you put it on the plate.   A little more colour and some peanuts made it perfect

I did exactly everything the recipe said and it was edible, but my family and I weren't big fans of it.  Had a friend over and she liked it, so maybe it was just not a good recipe for my family.

I should have read the reviews prior and reduced the sugar, but it was good! Next time I make it I'll add a few different vegetables too add more color and variety because it looks a bit unappetising. I topped it with paprika for a bit of an earthy flavor too!

Since I found this recipe I use it as a base about once a week or so.  For meat and veggies I use whatever I have around but I come back to this recipe because we really like the flavor of the sauce to go with whatever else I put together.  I do cut down on the sugar and usually halve the red pepper.  Usually tastes even better the next day!

I made half as there's just two of us. I dropped the sugar to one tablespoon. Kept the cayenne though! 
Instead of crushed peanuts, I used a natural crunchy peanut butter. 
Next time, I'll add a wild mushroom mix.
This is a great recipe and really lends itself to experimentation.

Turned out well.  Pay attention to the timing of the rice noodles.  They are more sensitive.  Also doubled the peanut butter, loved that as well.

As we like 'it' hot, I added some sambal. Plus, since I was a bit short on fish sauce, I used tamarind paste. Excellent recipe!!

I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and used chicken broth instead of beef.  This is restaurant quality!

Excellent starting point for pad thai.  As many others, I reduced the sugar to 1/2c and only had chicken stock on hand so used that.  I also like things on the spicy side so added 1/2 of a minced habanero.  This recipe is one that I keep in constant rotation.

I loved the combination of flavour and I did a little change because I lacked tquethe chicken. Added celery, zuchini and carrots!

But the sugar was too much. The flavour was amazing but sometimes I thought it was more of a dessert... but it has to do with perceptions! 

Still delicious! I will try it again with less sugar!

Really, I'd give this 4.5 stars... almost perfect! I've been searching and searching for a pad thai recipe that tastes like restaurant pad thai.  This is the closest I've ever come.  I followed the directions exactly just cut the cayenne in half since I have young kids and used rice wine vinegar.  I liked the consistency and the flavor was good.  I sprinkled lime juice and crushed peanuts on top which I highly recommend.  Next time I think I'll put lime juice into the sauce as well. That might be the one flavor missing for me.  Oh, and this makes a large amount.  I couldn't fit it all in my skillet so when adding everything together at the end, I had to switch to a larger pot. Next time I'll know, and there will definitely be a next time that I make this!

Now one of my favorites.  Crushed unsalted peanuts and the green onions finish it nicely

I added 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper.
Next time, I'll double the peanut butter and bean sprouts.
Cilantro would have been a nice addition.
