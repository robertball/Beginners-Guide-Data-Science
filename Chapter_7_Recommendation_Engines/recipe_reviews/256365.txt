Excellent dish. Simple to make and great flavor. I add a touch more cilantro and extra avocado. I think the only change I'd make would be to masticate the avocado more to create a more creamy consistency. Fantastic the way it is!

After reading the other reviews I decided to cut the cabbage to 4 cups, since I only had one avocado. It was a little thick but very tasty.  think guacamole with a cabbage crunch.

Great optional slaw idea for those who don't like mayo! I did reduce the onion,  added a bit more avocado and cilantro and a pinch of sugar, just my preference, it was good as written, too.

This slaw is different and has great flavors. Next time I will double the avocado and cilantro. Lime juice would be equally good as a substitute for lemon juice.

I donâ€™t know why my result was different than others but this was so lemony I threw it out. We ate one serving but none of us want the leftovers. And I normally suffer through so as not to waste food.
