I have made this recipe twice now. Both times, I sliced the tofu then pressed it for 1/2 hour before continuing with the recipe. I find this makes for a firmer baked tofu. The first time I coated the tofu and baked it according to the directions. The second time, I coated the tofu then fried it in just a little oil on both sides just till golden, then I baked it. I found this made a pleasing crunchy coating. I used my bottled barbeque sauce as is rather than adding the additional ingredients. I like the coating and the addition of the bbq was good. I serve this with homemade coleslaw and corn on the cob for a summer bbq treat. I will make this again.

I changed this A LOT. I didn't have any cornmeal, so I used Italian-seasoned bread crumbs. I left out the chili powder but used all the other spices. As some other commenters suggested. I fried it up in a pan with just some spray oil, then baked it. It then occurred to me that with the Italian seasonings and bread crumbs, maybe pasta sauce would be a more appropriate topping than barbeque. So that's what I did, and it was FAB. My husband said it was just like eating lasagne. I felt like I was eating cubes of ricotta, and my subconscious starting telling me I would get fat! But no, it's just tofu. Delish!

I really enjoyed this dish. It really depends on how good the BBQ sauce is (I used the Big Al's KC BBQ sauce found on this site). Delicious! The only thing that would make this better is frying the tofu rather only baking it.

I sliced the tofu into strips as I was using it as more of an appy rather than a meal. I fried them first in a little oil before baking and added some toasted sesame seeds. My kids, who have claimed to dislike tofu (mostly due to texture) actually enjoyed this. Very good and thank you Leah!

This tofu turns out so amazingly flavorful. I love the cornmeal mixture the tofu is "breaded" in. Recipe was also very easy to make. Great for vegetarians.

I made this recipe exactly as written, but it was just really not good.  We tried to eat it, but after about four bites we just couldn't.  Sorry!

Instead of shaking in a bag, I gently coated them in a bowl.  Also it was really good fried first.

It was quite yummy!  I used a bar-b-que sauce with A1 in it and it was very tasty...I plan on trying different sauces to see what flavors I can come up with.  
Also, the coating was good but I think I'll saute it next time, I love a crunch on my tofu, this had it on the edges but not so much in the middle (I used extra firm tofu).

There aren't many things I eat with BBQ sauce anymore, and I had never made breaded tofu before. It was good! :)

This was great! It was a little spicy- which I loved. I was worried about it being really soggy, but baking it with the coating made it perfectly crunchy and wonderful.

This is a great baked tofu recipe! I coat each strip of tofu with avocado oil first (or I can't really get the coating to stick). After baking on each side for 6 minutes, I broil each side on low for 4 minutes. This makes the sticks crispy.

Pressed the tofu first to drain and fried the tofu slices in a half tbsp of oil first, also baked 5-10 mins longer on each side, and it came out fabulous. Even better as leftovers, believe it or not. Also great with sriracha dipping sauce on the side. My first time making tofu too, and it was a super success! Amazing BBQ sauce! Thanks! SN: I counted the calories and it only came out to 211 calories per serv. using low calorie BBQ sauce!

This is really good, but next time I think I will season the tofu and put it in the fridge for a little while before breading.  I used much less BBQ sauce than was called for (around 1 Tbsp per slice) to cut cals and sodium.  Also subbed panko for cornmeal and turned out well.
