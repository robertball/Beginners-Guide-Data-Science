I loved this recipe. I made it spicy and it was fantastic with a cool salad on the side and saffron rice for lack of jasmine rice. Nice presentation for a quick meal for company on the fly. I was worried about the sweetness using balsamic as the primary liquid and I thought spicy would be nice. I added crushed red chili peppers to the bell peppers..it was fantastic. I was crunched for time so I used skinless chicken thighs whole instead of the breasts. I think it really enhanced the flavor (slthought adding calories aargh!). I also added most of the balsamic all at once turning the chicken once but mainly keeping the bottoms down to prevent the chicken from darkening too much in the balsamic.Also I'd like to note to keep an eye on the heat when you are 'finishing' the chicken as you dont want the balsamic to reduce too much. Good job all in all..thanks so much for the recipe..it's a keeper.

We enjoyed this very much.  I made some modifications, however.  To save time I used a bag of Japanese stir fry veggies (carrots, peppers, broccoli, and water chestnuts).  I added a few shots of soy sauce to the mixture and seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and cajun seasoning.  It gave it a nice kick!  A simple meal that tastes great for leftovers, too!

I substituted all the colored peppers with just green (it's all that I had) and it turned out great.  All of the steps worked out well.  Pre cooking the veggies could have been less or cut completely since they have to saute with the chicken an additional 20 minutes.  the vinegar at the end adds a great kick!

This was pretty much perfect. We ate it over penne pasta and sprinkled a little parmesan on top. I used half regular balsamic, and half tomato-flavored balsamic and it was delicious. I know I will make this again.

This recipce is FANTASTIC! I didn't give it a 5, only because I like my food a little spicier, and also because I think the cooking times need to be adjusted. If you leave the peppers in as long as prescribed, you en up with very pretty mush. Instead, I add them towards the end.  Other than that, this is DELICIOUS, and oh-so-easy!

This was a very simple dish to put together and it was really good. I used a little more basil than called for and a little less balsamic. Served it over rice. A definite keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be very easy and very tasty. We enjoyed it for dinner over rice. It has a mild flavor, not overbearing at all. When browning the chicken I used plenty of S & P and I definately think this helped with the flavor. Also very good the next day as my son ate this for lunch. Its a keeper!

Very flavorful!  I used Greek Seasoning in place of basil, since I was out of it. Next time I will use this as a filler for tortillas.

excellent!! I used balasamic vingrette salad dressing since I didn't have any balsamic vinegar, but just 2 tbsp added to the veggies before putting the chicken back in for about 25 mins to simmer. should have reduced the olive oil in light of that, but will do so next time if I use the salad oil again. super easy recipe and great flavor!!

I took license with the recipe and what I ended up with, at least for Hubs and me anyway, was nothing short of manna from heaven.  I dredged the chicken in flour before sautéing it and, because I’m really not crazy about balsamic vinegar, I used white wine in its place.  The chicken is velvety smooth and fork tender.  A little lemon might be nice, but this was fine just as is.  Using just picked, mild and sweet bell peppers from my garden made this particularly delicious.  I served this with “Spaghetti and Bacon,” also from this site, and sliced garden fresh tomatoes from my garden.   In my mind it just doesn’t get any better than this.

It was okay.... but really it lacked a lot. It's nothing I would make again... and it's nothing I would even try to mold into something better... Next time I'll just look for a different recipe all together. Sad... because I LOVE Balsamic Vinegar!

This  was pretty good. I might add more spices next time. I used spray for the chicken and I only used I tbsp of oil for the veggies. 1/4 cup is excessive and not necessary.

I really like this. I only used green and red bellpeppers because thats what I had. I served it  over rice and the kids put their chicken in a fajita tortilla. Very Good. You need to love balsamic vinegar to enjoy.

This recipe was very easy to make , myself and a couple of friends really enjoyed it. I expected there to be a little more flavor , the recipe as a whole was a little bland , but the peppers were delicious! I will make this recipe again , but instead I will be marinating the chicken in advance , I think that will give it what it needs.

I like this method, flavors were good. Something different from the usual stir fry and used ingredients I had on hand. I may decrease amount of oil next time a little. Served over rice. (I had no dry basil so I used Tarragon and a little fresh basil and it was a fine substitute)

DELICIOUS! The 4 stars is only because the cooking time is a bit off. The veggies need minimal precooking since you're going to cook them with the chicken and vinegar for 20 minutes anyway. I ended up cooking the chicken full-through, setting aside, cooking the veggies to tenderness, adding all the rest of the ingredients and chicken to them and cooking about 10 minutes until the chicken was heated through. Next time, I'm going to try grilling the chicken and veggies in order to cut some calories. Overall, a wonderful dish that has given me reason to love vinegar!

'Didn't know what to do with a cute little basket of mini sweet peppers of different colors from Trader Joe's.  This was incredibly easy and both my husband and I loved it.  The balsalmic vinegar makes it taste slightly sweet.  If you cook the chicken well, it doesn't need the whole 20 minuts at the end if you're in a hurry.

I made this last night and it tastes great!  I made enough for my luch for the next four days.  I made some white rice that I cooked with diced tomatos, a little bit of olive oil, oregano, salt and peppers.   My spouse ate some of it, mostly the chicken, so I took the left overs bellpeppers, onions and rice and added some baked red beats.  A nice twist.

RECOMMENDED!!!

Easy to make and we really liked it. I did marinate the chicken overnight after reading many reviews talking about it being bland. I marinated in sesame oil, balsamic vinegar, and low sodium soy sauce. I also cooked the chicken whole. I will make this again.

i switched this recipe up a bit...more of a sweet and spicy texture. I added 3 tablespoons of brown sugar and added a little bit of red pepper flakes. Very tasty

I made this with frozen chicken breasts so added a few tablespoons of chicken broth to help them thaw/cook faster.  Very tasty served over couscous.  Will make again.

I found this a bit bland. I followed the directions and am not sure what I did wrong. It was still good, but my husband didn't like it as much as I did. I rated this in the middle of the scale.

What a great simple recipe.  Cut chicken breasts in half and pounded them a bit so they were uniformly thin.  Cooked in a cast iron skillet so it came together in no time (had to be careful not to overcook chicken).  Used fresh basil (about 1/4 c.) vs dry, and added freshly grated Parmesan Reggiano to finish.  Served with brown rice.  A great weeknight meal but is nice enough to serve to guests.  Bravo.

This dish was excellent!!  I never follow quantities so I just eyeballed everything but the basil (which I semi-measured) and it turned out wonderfully!  Many people said it needed salt but I did not think that was the case.  My peppers turned out tasting very sweet, and everything had a nice full flavor.  When we finished eating, we were left wanting more!

This was wonderful and so easy!  I did not stray from the recipe except for adding a splash of chicken stock at the end for a little extra moisture.  Be sure to follow the last step and cook all together for 20 minutes  - really makes a difference in taste, softening/ steaming all the great flavors together.  I served with a pot of rice and sliced Avocado - yum!

this was pretty good. i didn't have many peppers(1/2 for 1 chicken breast) but it was good anyway. i gave 4 stars 'cause i do think it needs some salt, or as other said they added soy sauce, but it needs a little salt kick either way.

This was not my favorite.  I guess I'm just not a big fan of Balsamic.. the flavor was a little overwhelming to me.  Chicken was a little bland too.  I'm not sure that I will make this again.

This recipe is great! I decided not to add the balsamic vinegar at the end, though. I thought that might overpower the tastes of the chicken and the peppers. I also served this over rice.

Seriously great.  Only had a green bell pepper on hand, so used that, and tossed in some pearl onions I had in the freezer.  So good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very simple,the only change I made was to add a little honey to take some of the bite out of the vinegar.  My family doesn't like things too tart.  We served ours over noodles.  There was plenty of sauce.

I use this exact recipe (almost) for fajitas! It is so delicious. The only thing I do different is I use soy sauce rather than balsamic vinegar....which I am going to try now thank you very much!  I warm a flour tortilla with a little cheese in the microwave for 15 seconds and then add this mixture and top with sour cream.....SO DELICIOUS!!! Great with beef too and even with no meat...on those meatless nights I use rice instead.

This was both delicious and easy to make. I am not a very experienced cook, but the directions were simple to follow. The recipe even got the time and # of people served estimates right! I and my parents loved it, particularly the effect that the balsamic vinegar added. I substituted an Herbs de Provence mixture for basil, and it worked quite well.

Good recipe -  I changed it a bit by briefly marinating the chicken in a mix of soy sauce, fish sauce and a bit of sesame oil first.  yum!

Love this completely! Even my two-year-old grandson devoured it. 

The combination of ingredients makes for a delightful savory delivery for one's pallet. I did add about 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (if not for my grandson joining us for dinner I would have added a tad more), but overall this was a great recipe.

This was certainly passable, but even with the addition of red pepper flakes and feta cheese, there was something missing! Just not as flavourful as you would think.

Great one-pan meal. Used Italian seasoning in lieu of basil, which was great. I would've given it 5 stars if it had some crunch for a textural change. A great basic recipe you can play around with.  Thanks for sharing!

Sorry but this recipe was very bland.  I did not get a kick from the balsamic vinegar.  Chicken & peppers always are a good combination.  I discarded the liquid and used the left-overs in tortillas for lunch..not bad.

I marinated the chicken in vinegar and soy sauce beforehand, didn't add the basil or onion but instead added some grated ginger and chili paste. I cut up the peppers like confetti and the last one I cut in rounds. Even my 3 yr old loved it! A great recipe to start with. The perfect summer sizzle with a little extra stuff for kick!

Despite what some others have said, this had plenty of flavors for me. I especially loved the way the flavor was brought out of the peppers. Still, I added some allspice to be sure I had enough flavors and it did. Absolutely delicious dinner. Went well with garlic bread and fried asparagus.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I used all fresh ingredients except for the basil and thought it was terribly bland.  We had to use soy sauce to give it flavor.  I had hoped for stronger flavors. Maybe I was expecting it to be more oriental.

Very tasty, will defiantly try it with some spicy peppers added next time. Have it on a bed of powered greens, works out well.

Made recipe as written, but for me lacked flavor.  Just needed more taste.  Am trying to figure out what to do with leftovers...thinking some lime and soy sauce and make fajitas.  Won't be making again as the peppers are rather expensive for the result.

The recipe was acceptable, but we prefer something with a little more seasoning.  I served it with a wild rice/white rice mixture and some added soy sauce.

I followed the instructions and it came out over cooked and chicken was dry. Next time I will use a smaller pan. It's too bad, I love balsamic vinegar

My first time cooking chicken and I decided to try this recipe.  I modified it a little because I wasn't sure what to do with the chicken and wasn't sure how it would turn out.  And I was feeling very adventurous.  So I marinated the chicken with beer, garlic, salt, pepper, lemon juice and cumin.  Then at the end, I added basil as well as parsley to get a bit of freshness, as well as some paprika to get a kick of heat.  The bell peppers did end up a bit over cooked so next time I'd probably add them towards the end.  But the balsamic vinegar made it so delicious!!!

This was an awesome recipe!  I loved it because I didn't have everything on hand that I needed, but I still worked it out!  I didn't have garlic or onion so I used powder forms of both.  Also, for flavor I used boneless skinless chicken thighs which was amazing!  I seasoned the meat with salt and pepper and garlic powder, threw in the peppers, cooked a while then added the balsamic vinegar.  Yummm!!  I served with bow tie pasta!  Will do again!

This is delicious! I marinated the chicken in balsamic vinegarette all day. It has such a nice flavor. My husband and I had just had rice the day before so I served it with couscous instead. Great dish!

This recipe was easy to make, tasty and pleasing to the eye.  I think I will take the reviewers advice and add some pepper flakes to give it a little kick.  I served it with brown rice.  Very nice.

This was excellent even though I only had one pepper and had to use some mushrooms to fill it out.  I also left the chicken breast whole by mistake, but found that it made for a prettier dish.  Also, I substituted the onions for Mrs. Dash because I didn't have an onion and it turned out excellent.

Very easy to make and fast!  Doesn't need to simmer as long as suggested.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I only used two chicken breasts and that worked very well.

Ok, simple and great!  Two of the best qualities needed when cooking.  I had to add a little salt (just because) and I used Kraft's Balsamic Vinaigrette instead (that's what I had and it added more flavor).  I will make this again and again.  Even my 9 year old enjoyed it and she hates veggies lol.  This is also a great side dish, minus the chicken of course. I love this dish and can't wait for lunch tomorrow...hmmm leftovers!!! =)

Very good, but I felt cooking for 20 minutes would be too long, so I browned on both sides and removed the chicken. I pre-cooked the onions and peppers and then threw all together, including fresh basil and warmed through.  The chicken was moist and succulent and definitely not undercooked.

Fabulous flavour! Chicken and balsamic are the perfect pairing. I cooked the peppers for less time than stated because I prefer them with a bit of "bite" - not mushy. Served it with a pesto pasta. Wonderful, quick, easy.

Overall the dish was tasty, easy to make, and the ingredients are all common. I left out the green peppers, because I don't really like them, and it still tasted pretty good.  Also through in some Tarragon. Though be careful that the chicken doesn't dry out. A nice bonus: while cooking the peppers, the whole apartment smelled awesome.

Yum.  This one goes in the rotation for sure.  The only modifications I made were to cut the oil way down and amp up the garlic.  It was so easy to make and the taste was wonderful!  Looks pretty, too.  :-)

We cooked this last night and it was a hit! I added some mushrooms and broccoli to just add to the flavor. The balsamic vinegar was a very very strong flavor so we're going to dilute it a little next time around!

My husband and I really enjoyed this chicken. The only change I made was to dump a box/can of crushed tomatoes and basil in right before I added the chicken back to skillet. I served it over whole wheat spaghetti.

We thought it was delicious, and very simple to put together. Since I also had some Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage, I used half sliced chicken breast and 3 links of the sausage. I sliced the sausage and browned it first, set it aside, browned the sliced chicken and followed the rest of the recipe. I served it with a harvest grain blend of cous cous, lentils, etc. from Trader Joes. Great easy mid-week dinner!

This was pretty good. My family really enjoyed this but I was expecting more flavor and I added crushed red pepper along with salt and black pepper. I guess I was hoping for a little more kick. Served with white rice. I would make it again and add more something. Not sure what though.

decidedly OK.  peppers do get mushy.  maybe throw them in later.  next time, i'll probably heed the advice of others who suggested a bit more seasoning .

This recipe did not have enough flavor.  I was hoping after all those lovely peppers and yummy vinegar it would be a hit but it wasn't.  It was super bland and we needed to add Italian dressing to finish it off.   Would not do this recipe again.

This was very good.  Also easy, quick and healthy.  The only thing I did differently was add some crushed red pepper.  I will definitely make again.

Fantastic. So easy to cook and tasted wonderful too. I added more basil and balsamic vinegar than was called for. Also added some soy sauce and a pinch of chilli powder at the end. Loved it.

Too much dried herbs gave it a clumpy, dry texture. Also had too much vinegar - needs to be sweetened up with honey or sugar and/or reduced in the pan.

I was very excited to try this recipe but was disappointed with the results. I followed the directions exactly but for using fresh basil rather than dried. It was very plain tasting despite its very strong ingredients. If I try it again, I may add some buttom mushrooms and maybe some teriyaki or soy sauce? I am not precisely sure what it needs.

It was tasty but a bit bland.  I will cook the veggies a little less next time and I also suggest drizzling with a balsamic glaze at the end.  Beyond that, not sure what it need to get it just that tiny bit better.

Was good!  I added thinly sliced carrots and a jalapeno as well.  Cooked the carrots first, then the peppers and onions.  Then, I cooked the chicken in the same pan together with the peppers.  Good flavor.  I drizzled balsamic glaze on top before serving.

I made this in my RV. Just happened to have one of those bags of small peppers, chicken and an onion, and this is what came up when I did a recipe search. I had leftover polenta which I made into cakes and fried in butter as a base. I used the vinegar as called for in the recipe, and to finish it I used a balsamic glaze I had on hand. Came out dandy. I think using polenta as a base is more complimentary to the strong flavors than rice. I also added some red pepper flakes based on the reviews of others.

This dish was excellent!  Even without mods it would be a very flavorful and easy dish to prepare.  Having made a similar dish before, I did add Italian seasoning and parsley with the basil, and I added the vinegar before simmering rather than mixing it in at the end so it could cook down and get a little thicker.  But these are minimal changes - my family raved about it and asked me to please make it again!

CHICKEN WAS DRY AF. WOULD NOT RECOMEND, TASTES LIKE GHANDIS FLIP FLOP/SAHARA DESERT.

onions, however, were lit ( even though i don't like onions lol i'm a mess )

tasted good tho

We loved this recipe - my husband had 3 helpings (though they were fairly small). I don't know if my chicken was the required amount - it weighed about 1 kg (2.2 pounds). I cut it into slices. I followed the suggestions of some reviewers and cooked the chicken first until done, then cooked the veggies separately, and added back the chicken for a few minutes at the end to heat it. I had only green peppers  (gift from neighbor's garden). I meant to add roasted red peppers at the end, but forgot - tomorrow I will throw some in for a little extra color. I added soy sauce, lemon pepper, & smoked paprika, which gave a nice flavor. I was surprised to see that many reviewers cut one star because it needed salt - the recipe clearly states "salt & pepper to taste" - to me this means that the cook is responsible, not the recipe. Next time I will use thighs - personal preference. Served w/ basmati rice.

It was great!!! I added a little more seasonings, paprika, lemon pepper, and a dash of cayenne pepper. But other than that it was absolutely amazing and easy to make! Also my husband was out of town and I was able to cut it back to one serving very easily.

Very enjoyable dish, looks enticing and colorful, and so simple to prepare. Red onion added a bit more color. Served with a simple salad. I substituted chicken thighs. Will definitely make again. Going into the "Keeper File."

This worked really well for me - onlt one small addition, I added a few tablespoons of white wine. Very simple and easy - great with either a green salad or rice.

Tried this tonight. Got great reviews from all!  Used chicken thighs instead of breasts and served it over rice.  Great for low-carb people (without the rice) :)

I was looking for a Chicken and Peppers recipe after having a delicious plate at a local Lebanese restaurant. This was a healthier alternative (I'm certain the restaurant dish had much more oil to taste so yummy). I substituted Italian seasoning and little Chicken Seasoning in place of the Basil, and part Red Wine and Balsamic in place of all Balsamic. This creates a more mild (but well seasoned) dish. Served over brown rice with a smear of goat cheese. Yum!

Well, first I cut the recipe in half, except for the onion.  After I browned the chicken I mixed in the vinegar, basil and garlic and then simmered for 15 minutes.  I added the peppers and onion and then turned up the heat to about medium until the peppers and onions were just tender.  I put it on a salad with fresh pineapple and other than the chicken was dry it was delicious.  I think next time I will just forgo the simmer time and hopefully it won't turn out dry.  Overall, a good recipe.

I personally loved this!  My husband would give 4 stars...but I'm giving 5 stars because he doesn't matter when it comes to rating these things.  I, also, put in red pepper flakes because we enjoy spicy things.  He put some soy sauce on his after it was all done and went on and on about how it made it perfect.  I didn't.  It was fabulous!!!  The red pepper flakes was the ONLY thing that I did different!

A very solid 4 star. This was just a visual delight, both in prep and finished product. It was easy enough, and the instructions were very clear. While the dish simmers for the last 20 minutes, there's time to throw together a salad, prepare  beverages, and dish out your choice of base for the chicken and peppers; we used rice, but I can see this being good over noodles, or as others have said in a tortilla or pita. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was very easy to put together. However, I will say that it was a little bland, but I added a bit more balsalmic than it called for towards the end and it added more flavor. Served in whole wheat tortillas and it really added a little more to the meal.  Enjoyed it.

This recipe was very easy and delicious!  The only thing that I did differently was add about (1) cup fresh mushrooms and once it was done cooking, I sprinkled some fresh parmesean cheese over the top.  I'll definately make this one again!

This was super easy.  I served it on a bed of lettuce with cold vegetables like a grilled chicken salad.  The warm peppers and chicken were so delish especially with parmesan cheese sprinkled on top!

Things I changed because I wanted to spice it up a bit: I used 4 peppers (red, yellow, orange and green), extra couple cloves garlic, a little extra onion, a small handful of FRESH basil and about a tablespoon of FRESH oregano along with ground black pepper and red pepper flakes.  I also made this VEGETARIAN by using Morningstar farms chicken strips cut up in 1 inch cubes.  I used a high quality balsamic also.  I served over linguini pasta. This was absolutely wonderful!  I will make again for sure!

I was looking for a new way to make tilapia, and remembered coming across this recipe earlier in the day -- so I followed the recipe using tilapia in place of the chicken, and it came out fantastic!

This recipe was just not that great. It was pretty easy but didn't really WOW me. The balsamic reduction was not very flavorful and the dish definitely didn;t look very pretty. I will not be making this again.

Super recipe !!!  This is my newest Favorite All Recipes recipe !!!
It was so simple to make and looked and tasted like a fancy restaraunt dish !!  whenever a recipe calls for "green peppers" I always substitue with Jalapenos because we like spicy !!!  I did so in this recipe and still added the other color peppers.  I did add all of the balsamic vinegar at once by mistake, so added just a bit more when it was finished cooking.  I am sure this would be just as good with some leftover chicken or turkey and just reduce the cooking time.  Whenever a recipe calls for sliced or diced chicken,  I always pre-cook my chiken breast just a little on top of the stove in a small amount of  salted water.  Makes the chicken much easier to cut up and adds a little flavor and moisture to it.  I served it over some oriental noodles instead of rice.  My husband took it for lunch the next day with no noodles and said it was even better tasting !!  

I can't wait to make this recipe again !!!

I had a hard time cooking the chicken right..it came out king of rubbery. But this is something I will try again with maybe already cooked chicken.  All the flavors were good and my dad loved it despite the chicken not being perfect and it was good for leftovers too.

The chicken stripes are simply too tough.
I'd rather marinade them with some salt and wine to soften them before putting them on fire.

Yum!  Very delicious!  We ate this as-is, not with rice or pasta.  It was great and the balsamic is the perfect compliment to the peppers and onion.

IMO, I did not care for this recipe. Very bland. I cook with balsamic vinegar a few times a month, but it just didn't add much flavor to this dish. Won't make again.  We ended up pouring teriyaki sauce over it for flavor...only then did it taste okay.

This is a good starting point but it needs more seasoning to give it flavor. I marinaded the chicken overnight in olive oil, balsamic vinegar and a little lemon pepper. I also used fresh basil, and seasoned the chicken/pepper mix with salt and pepper. It was still a little bit bland, but we enjoyed it. Thanks!

Wonderful!!  Have made it twice this month.  I served it with white and wild rice.
