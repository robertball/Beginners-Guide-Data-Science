After adding the soup mix to the veggies, I tasted it, and it was a tad bland for my taste. I added about 1/2 cup of Italian dressing to the mix for some zing. Fantastic!! I also used fresh veggies instead of the Bird's Eye mix and steamed them ahead of time (red bell pepper, green bell pepper, red onion, and celery).

We really enjoyed this recipe. I added a couple cloves of garlic and some mushrooms, then served it with rice. Very good and easy, too.

Really moist & delicious! I seared the bone-in chops w/onions, garlic & mushrooms. Set the chops aside, added mushroom soup & milk to onion mix then added cooked egg noodles. Served over pork chops, turned out great! A definite keeper!

The recipe was wonderful.   I put everything in a casserole dish and baked it at 350 deg for 1 hour.  Wonderful!

I enjoyed these. I used cream of celery soup. The chops were nice and tender and the flavor was good. I loved the ease with which this meal came together. I served it over noodles. Thank you Birds Eye!
