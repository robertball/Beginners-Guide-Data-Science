Understated, yet fabulous.  This last time I made it, I tossed on a layer of finely chopped fresh spinach right after pouring the butter on.  It steamed perfectly and added some beatiful color, flavor and nutrition (gotta get it into the toddler somehow!).  I also love this recipe because unlike plain rice, the leftovers don't dry out and you can enjoy it several days later.  Thank you for this go-to side dish that I can pull out on a moments notice and impress company.

Hold on while I unclog my arteries.  Ah-hem.    This is one of the best tasting rice dishes I've ever had.  It's simple to make, and the whole family scarfed it down.  I made the following changes:  One can of chicken broth, one can of vegetable broth (slightly less than 4 cups, but it turned out perfect).  I also added a  little garlic powder before boiling the rice.  I also made mine in my electric skillet which made clean-up a breeze (the butter I burned in a separate pan).  Imagine...burning your food on purpose!  Who cares, it works!  Thanks so much!

Its so easy and tasty.  I added some garlic to my rice when i cooked the butter and it gave a really nice flavor.  make sure you use the long grain as written, otherwise using japanese type rice will turn out a bit watery.  it didnt bother me that is was a bit watery, so I would say that I enjoyed it.

thanks leslie for submitting this recipe.

I really liked the flavor that the burnt butter gave the rice. It's very subtle and goes well with anything. However I followed the directions exactly and the rice was still crunchy after standing for 15 minutes. I had to take the lid off and add a bit more water and cook longer. Next time I would simmer for 20 minutes at the beginning instead of 15.

This rice was absolutely delicious - I can't wait to make it again! I cut the recipe in half and it turned out perfectly. I cooked the butter in a stainless steel skillet only until medium brown - there was still some foam on top.  The browned butter gave a wonderfully rich and nutty flavour to the rice, just excellent!!

I make recipes from All Recipes almost every week and this is the first one I've commented on.  This rice is amazing!  I added the suggestions of others - adding a little chopped spinach and garlic. I give it 10 stars!

I'm not really sure what I expected, but this tasted like rice covered in burnt butter.  Not so good.

SUPER delicious & simple.  I served this with Greek chicken and thought it was just so good.  I'm Ukrainian/German and we eat A LOT of things cooked with browned butter so this was right up my alley.  LOVED IT!!!

definitely an acquired taste.  my greek friends do this
>burn butter in pot
>add rice and broth to the burnt butter pot.
> bring to a soft boil
>simmer 15min (covered)
>remove from heat and keep covered for 5 more min
>fluff and enjoy.

Yum! This is a great way to make rice. I used brown rice and had to cook it longer, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The burnt butter really adds a lot of flavor. It is a little greasy but in a good way!

Cooked rice in broth in rice maker, stirred it when it was cooked, then added the burned butter and left it on warm setting while finishing everything else. My husband and kids LOVE this, it's a bit salty, so not to be served with salty meat or veggies, but the flavour is amazing when done correctly. TIP Keep whisking butter right up to the point of pouring so it doesn't blacken.

I had such high hopes for this dish. Only thing I can think of that went wrong was that I burnt the butter in a non stick pan. By the time it got to the beautiful chocolate color, evidently it charred the bottom of the pan, because when I poured it onto the rice, I had these horrible black flakes. The rice tasted greasy and plastic. I won't try it again, even with a different pan, since the greasy taste was also offensive.

This rice is really good.  It has a unique taste to it-the burnt butter of course.  Would definately recommend trying.  Fun recipe to learn about melting butter and how it seperates and then if you burn it-its OK-you actually want to!!!  I enjoyed, husband said OK.  I love butter-he doesn't really use.  You decide-give it a try!

My husband thought that this was a nice variation of traditional white rice.  I actually used instant rice, because that's all i had and it turned out just fine.  I tried substituting margarine, but i guess it doesn't burn like butter does.  It was still good--i love a little rice with my butter.  I would imagine this tastes like burned butter, so if that sounds gross, i wouldn't make it.

I actually had to do this twice because I burnt the first batch. I'm not the best rice cooking-type person, my husband can attest to that. Second time, I had it. This went really well with Fierro Chicken, as it didn't compete flavor-wise with an already strong main dish. NOTE: Next time, I might add a little garlic and onion.

I have made this several times using basmati rice and have always gotten compliments.  I threw it all into my rice cooker along with some fried garlic, fried onions and a dash of soy sauce.  I usually serve this with "Marinated Pork Tenderloin", another favorite of mine found on this site.  I'll continue to make this from time to time.  Thanks Leslie.

Very easy and a dish even my 2 and 4 year olds enjoyed.  I didn't cook the butter quite as long as instructed because I wasn't sure if the kids would like that as much.  I will try that next time.

I followed the receipe exactly, and this rice was bland.  Definitely not worth all the fat that comes from the butter.    I ended up putting some buillon on it for flavor.

Really good, but looks rather "iffy" while you're making it.  Not diet food for sure, but a real nice, easy side dish.

This definitely had a distinct favour to it and tasted quite good. Thanks for the recipe. Being a vegitarian, I just added a wee bit of curry powder instead of chicken boulion.

I made this last night. I was looking for a flavorful long grain rice recipe to go with our rock cod we were having. I actually didn't even use the burnt butter part, I seriously was just blown away by how simple and delicious the flavor of the rice was, I truly forgot! I added a small amount of finely chopped onions to the rice and also added garlic salt.
Since I usually just serve Japanese sushi rice with our fish dishes, the family was super impressed with this long grain option. This will be my go to long grain rice recipe because the flavor and ease is just what I needed! Maybe next time I'll include the burnt butter part! ;)

Absolutely delicious. I've been wanting to make my own 'Mediterranean' style rice since trying it in my favourite restaurant- a Turkish Mediterranean - and this doesn't disappoint. Followed recipe to the letter. Perfect. Now to try and replicate my favourite chicken shish!

This turned out to be mushy.  I considered not even serving it but since I went to the effort to make it I figured we could take a bite.  Literally one bite is all we took.  Since it's relatively simple to make with few ingredients I figured it must not be something I did.  Rather it must be and acquired taste and texture for that matter.

Although I'm glad I tried this, I won't make it again. The taste was interesting but not all that good. It is at least something different to make when your ingredients are scarce.

I made this last night with the honey walnut baked chicken from this site. It was a very easy side dish and the burnt butter gave the rice a really different taste. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I will definitely make this one again!

It was okay - nothing special.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was a little too much rice and not enough butter...I didn't think it was greasy at all.  I would probably make it again if I didn't have any other ideas for a side.

This was a very easy and tasty rice dish, except it is WAY TOO greasy.  I am going to cut the butter down to half the stated amount and I'm sure it will be better.  I added some oregano and garlic powder and it added some added punch!!!  My kids GOBBLED this stuff up!!!

This was just okay, and I had such high hopes :-(
I added some green onions for color, but the browned butter just didn't add much to it except calories and fat.  My mom always fried our rice in butter after she prepared it the usual way, and I prefer that way to this.

Excellent rice. I actually used brown rice which meant it needed to cook a little longer but it worked out great and the flavor was very good! The whole family loved it! Thanks for this recipe.

I consider myself a good cook, but for some reason I always have trouble with rice. This time was no exception...I followed the directions to a "t", but the rice wasn't cooked enough, and it was still a little watery at the end.

I served this to my children (ages 9-14) and they loved it. Then I served it to all of the inlaws and they loved it too. This includes my sister-in-law, who hates everything. Both times I made chicken souvlaki and a side greek salad.I highly recommend this - great for company. The mild flavour that goes great with spicier offerings. I used bouillon cubes both times.

I enjoyed but unfortunately I was the only one in my family who liked this recipe.  It was a rough start making.  To get the butter to burn properly, I had to turn the heat up high on the stove.  I ended up smoking up my house which then led the smoke detectors to go off.  Had to hurry and open up all the windows and turn the air off to let in the heat and fresh air.  (Of course it was in the 90s outside)  I would make again for myself by scaling the recipe down and next time I will make on the side burner on the grill.  A real comfort food.  Made with Marinated Pork Tenderloin from this site.

The first time I made this, according to directions, it was WAY too salty. So I tried it again with out the chicken stock, but that was bland. I finally tried it with low sodium stock and it was good, not great, but good! I like the flavour, but am only giving it 3 stars because I had to try 3 times finally get to taste good.

Not sure what I was expecting. It seemed similar to rice pudding or something. If I add some sugar and milk it would be ok. Did not care for it at all.

I thought it was rather blah as is...definitely needs something added to it. The browned butter wasnt as pronounced as I hope. Still, I may try it again down the road with a number of additions because of the simplicity of the dish.

Tip: Use good quality butter and never use margarine! I have made this for years but I brown the butter then add the uncooked rice to the butter and let it toast a bit then add the chicken stock. Toasting the rice gives it more flavor.

4.5 Stars for a surprising and versatile side.  We used jasmine rice, which smells and tastes (to us) like popcorn.  This recipe was like having buttered movie popcorn!

I will make this over and over.  Then only difference to original recipe is that I had to use long grain brown rice cause that was all I had.  Trust me it was great!  Can't wait to try it with the white rice next

Halved the recipe. Used unsalted butter, so I added a bit of salt while cooking. Good flavor, if a bit greasy.

What a great idea to use browned or burnt butter to give the rice a deep, rich flavor. I made two changes to the recipe: 1) I used half the butter called for; 2) I browned the butter until a caramel brown rather than a dark or chocolate brown. I will be making this dish again in the near future.
