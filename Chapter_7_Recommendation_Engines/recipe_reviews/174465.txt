Mmmmm!  I couldn't cut the bread fast enough to serve everyone.  It practically flew off the serving platter.  At first, the kids eyed the "green stuff" suspiously, but once one of them tasted a tiny morsel and demanded more, the rest of them followed suit.  Definitely a keeper!

I really like the pesto pita appetizer from this website but wanted something more substanstial to go with my soup. So I tried this recipe with my homemade pesto. Went really well with white bean soup.
