Delicious! I made my own filling, and used macadamia nuts, as I have different preference. But a very simple and tasty recipe :D

I searched for rainey day and this came up.  Seriously, the name is perfect.  Its simple to make, it makes the house smell amazing, and every bite is warm, sweet and crunchy.  
I followed the recipe exactly and it is perfect.  Who cares if its pouring and cold outside when you have this!
One warning, swat any hands that can not wait to dig in.  This stuff is lava hot when it first comes out.  My boyfriend will tell you as soon as his mouth heals.

Hubs was a much bigger fan of this than I was, but then I donâ€™t care for oats in my crumble toppings.  Still, he enjoyed it, albeit with lots of whipped cream.  For an easy dessert he enjoyed that took only a couple of minutes to throw together with not much more than a can of pie filling, four stars.

Great topping.  I used Sugar Twin for brown sugar and doubled the nuts.

Pretty good... While it might be more time consuming, I have to wonder how amazing it might be using fresh pitted cherries
