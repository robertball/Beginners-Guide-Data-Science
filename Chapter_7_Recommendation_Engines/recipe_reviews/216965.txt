Nearly identical to Kikkoman's "Classic Fried Rice," also from this site.  For the most part I followed the recipe as written (there are infinite variations you could try) except for cooking the egg separately, like a crepe, then rolling it up like a cigar and slicing it, chiffonade-style, for a more authentic presentation.  Just as it is used in "Classic Fried Rice," this could benefit from the addition of some fresh minced garlic.

This was a real hit, but I made changes: Added a few  more bacon strips and another egg;didn't have the green onions, so substituted with a regular onion and 1/2 green pepper; added chopped fresh mushrooms, and sprinkled with some Adobo seasoning at the end.   This was heavy on the grease, so after cooking each item (bacon, eggs, veggies) I drained the grease on paper towels.  This got raves, and fed a lot of people!

very tasty, family really enjoyed it. Love all the garlic, might add more (we like a lot of garlic). You can do a lot with this recipe (adding chicken, pork, vegetables) great way to use up left over rice..  My Husband went back for seconds and said make this again, (rarely ever said)

This was a flavorful side dish! In my opinion bacon adds nice flavor and compliments any dish well. Not only did the bacon smell awesome cooking up but this dish tasted great! I just tossed in a couple of garlic cloves, chopped, cold cooked rice, added the cooked bacon, green onions and seasoned the rice with a little soy sauce, Hawaiian sea salt and black pepper. Lastly, I added in some cooked eggs that I made into an omelet and sliced thinly. This made a pretty side dish, was easy to prepare and delicious! Thou there is ample room where you can add other veggies and ingredients this was great as is. I served this with, “Grilled Asian Chicken,” and “Easy Bok Choy,” also from this site.

Better than most take-out places!  I never thought I could make fried rice at home!  This is seriously good! This is good for a side dish OR add chicken/shrimp/steak and you've got a meal! Thanks! I think this is my FAVORITE recipe on this site!

GREAT! I had been wasting 99cents a pack for "fried rice" seasoning only to figure out it's dehydrated soy sauce! duh! wow.... We love fried rice and this was the BEST ever one i've ever made! The bacon made it "special"!!  I cooked the bacon, then cooked the chicken in the bacon grease then cooked the eggs in the remaining bacon grease.  YUM! i made a ton of it and just added seasoning (soy sauce) to taste.  it's so much easier than i ever realized! will make this recipe forever more!

I made this (with no changes) for my family and they absolutely loved it.  The bacon adds so much flavor especially if you don't drain the bacon fat.  

Next time, I think I'm going to try to add fresh mushrooms (sliced) to add more freshness and flavor.

I loved this recipe because it didn't taste like I made it from a box.  I used a pkg. of cooked bacon, and stir-fried the scallion pieces before the egg, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe and it was fantastic! :)

Good basic recipes. Added sauteed vidalia onion, orange pepper and garlic. Also added some chili garlic paste. Omitted the bacon ( didn't have any).

My boyfriend wanted some fried rice, so I tried this recipe.  It really was sooo good.  I added 2 extra eggs (just for extra protien because I made this as a main dish), other than that I made the recipe exactly.  I made this in less than 10 minutes.  I will make this again for sure.

For me this was just okay.  I didn't have bacon on hand so I used bacon grease and sliced ham. Also, didn't have green onions so I used yellow onions. My version I would only give 3 stars......I gave an extra star because it might be better without the substitutions.

Really tasty recipe.  I think next time I would either cut down the amount of soy sauce, since we found it a touch too salty, or perhaps use an equivalent amount of chicken.

I didn't add the egg because I realized after I cooked the bacon that we didn't have an egg.  This was super yummy.  Even better the next day.  It's missing something and none of us could put our finger on it but believe me I will be making this again and again

I found that it smelled deliciously while it was cooking, but it was lacking in flavor. I followed this recipe almost exactly (didn't have any bacon on hand) and added chicken. It needed something else; I'm not sure what could be added to make it better. But I will try a different fried rice recipe before I make this again.

Delicious! The bacon seems to be exactly the flavor that was missing from my other attempts at fried rice. This is perfect exactly as written. It’s also great with a can of diced mixed veggies drained and added with the rice.

My husband does not prefer white rice so I gave this one a try. Even though the flavor was better than plain white rice, we felt it just wasn't quite restaurant quality.  I made exactly as written but next time I will probably add bean sprouts.

This was a very good recipe. I made it as a side with teriyaki chicken and my son still ate 5 healthy helpings of this rice. The only thing I did different was to add frozen diced carrots and peas that I cooked before I added them into the rice. VERY YUMMY!

Yes! This is perfect restaurant-style fried rice! I only added an extra egg because I love eggs and also cooked this in my wok so that the egg would clump up nicely. Pairs well with the Eggplant with Garlic Sauce recipe found on this site.

Quick, easy, and tasty. I used prechopped garlic in a jar because it was what I had on hand. It turned out great but I know it would be even better with fresh garlic.

So good you'll wonder why more Chinese restaurants don't use bacon in their fried rice. Can even use cheap rice for a good result.

It's a great recipe, but woah-the grease!! I LOVE bacon grease! However, it does not add well to this recipe. As another reviewer noted, drain well after sauntering the onions.

This simple recipe was delicious!  Is it strange to have the bacon in there?  A little bit...but once you taste it you will not be able to stop eating it!  I just made sure to cut the bacon into pieces even smaller than the 1/2" that the recipe calls for.  That way it cooks up into nice crispy pieces instead of being too big.  Also, right at the end of cooking I mixed in a little bit of Sriracha Sauce for some zing...YUM!

I made this without the bacon and cut the rice to 2 cups. I also used carrots and green peas in addition to the original recipe. Very versatile and delicious!

My oh so picky 10 year old didn't come up for air then ate his oh so picky brother's portion. I stir fried some frozen peas and carrots before adding the rice. Omitted the green onion and added about a teaspoon of fresh ginger just because.

Loved it. The bacon adds a lot of salt, so I'd cut down on that in the future.

This was good, and my boyfriend really liked it, but I'm only giving it four stars because it seemed like something was missing. I think for sure the egg/rice ratio was off. Definitely a good recipe, but I think it could be better.

This is outstanding!!! I made it with two eggs and added some pepper, otherwise I followed the recipe. This has ruined me for all other fried rice. I cannot believe how good this was.

Great base recipe!! I made a few changes when I made a double batch of this for company. After cooking the bacon I removed it from the pan and drained all but about a tablespoon of the grease. I added a about 3 tablespoons of diced shallot along with 4 chopped green onions. I used 3 eggs, but next time would use 4 (for a double recipe, 2 for a single). I mixed the garlic in the low sodium soy sauce along with a teaspoon of seasoned salt. Everyone loved it and we will definitely be making it again!

I used ground pork instead of bacon and cooked along with diced yellow onion until onions were clear and meat fully cooked.  I also added mixed veggies and cooked the rice in half water, half chicken broth for extra flavor.  No reason to add extra seasoning with this method.

Great base!  If you can, use Jasmine Rice, it'll be like it came from your local Chinese restaurant.

I like to toss in ginger, green onions and peas.  The egg part is best if you will fry it then put on a plate to the side and cook the rest up.  A tablespoon of rice vinegar and lemon juice really adds a lot!!!

The bacon adding good flavor to this dish!  I had more than 4 cups of rice I wanted use so I added more of everything else (sorry, I didn't measure) and also added carrots because I needed to use them too. My family loved it with some asian marinaded chicken.  This will be a new go to dish in my home!

I just made this after a long time since last making it. I scrimped on green onions to my regret. It would be yummier with all 8 green onions.  I added an extra egg, and it was not too much. 

I remember being skeptical when first reading this, wondering about seasoning. But the soy sauce really does add the flavor.   The recipe makes a great veggie fried rice, but I think it would be adaptable to whatever people like best about fried rice. I added some frozen peas, without thawing and the skillet did the work.

I cook my bacon pieces, set them aside and cook the garlic in the bacon grease a few minutes. Add beaten eggs. I used 4 eggs. I like eggs. I then thrown in my onion and cook a minute or two. Add the rice and bacon and combine. I then slowly pour soy sauce over it until it looks right :) Such a simple recipe. I am always disappointed in restaurant fried rice. I learn to make this from my mom.

Used ham instead of bacon, onions, red and yellow peppers (since they were already diced) instead of green onions, Bragg liquid aminos as alternative to soy sauce. Lastly 2 eggs and brown rice..  Hubby enjoyed.

I used frozen chopped onion that I sauteed in a little olive oil in the opposite side of the pan from the bacon. The rice I had was basmati. I pushed the fried rice to the side of the pan and cooked the beaten egg in the space it left, then scrambled it all together. Delicious!

was great and simple.  I added a few veggies and drained most of the grease out of the bacon, leaving only enough to keep things from sticking.  I used an extra egg and did the eggs separately.

Super easy...added shrimp.  As a single mom I don't have a lot of free time and this is a hit.....whether you add pork, chicken, or shrimp it's an easy meal!  I added vegetables to mine...carrots, corn and broccoli to make it a more balanced meal.

I made this rice the other evening for a quick side with my chicken. I left out the garlic because I'm not a fan and it turned out amazing. Absolutely delicious and super quick to make. Will be making again often

This is very good fried rice and an easy recipe to follow.  I didn't have bacon - I used pork sausage in its place but I didn't penalize the recipe for my lack.  I deducted a star because the rice is pretty unappetizing-looking without some color so I added some chopped carrots, onions and gr peppers.  I might cut back a tsp or so on the Soy sauce next time.

I needed a really quick fried rice recipe for a coworker, and I stumbled upon this. All my bacon was frozen solid, so I broke up a thick slice of turkey from my freezer and thawed it in the oven while the egg scrambled. Since there was no bacon grease, I dissolved a cube of chicken bullion in a bit of water and added that with the turkey. When it was all together, I thought it could use some color, so I thawed half a cup of frozen peas under hot water and tossed those in. It was so delicious! I'm super thrilled to find a quick recipe to help me use up all the turkey in my freezer!

My guys LOVED this recipe!  The only slight change I made was more soy sauce, but that's a personal preference.  This was a very easy recipe to make and I will definitely make again.

Very good recipe for left over rice.  I used bacon bits instead of pork because I had them and did not have the pork.  I added a couple tablespoons of dried chives too.

Tastes great! Although I think that the next time I make it I'll use a little less soy sauce as 3 tablespoons is a lot.

Easy to make but tasted very plain. I tried reading through the other reviews to see if anyone had any suggestions. I went with adding more soy sauce and pepper.

Excellent recipe. I am trying to get to the level of the sushi place I go to. I found out that they use garlic butter and a certain kind of soy sauce. I will try these changes soon.

I took this recipe and tweaked it. I cooked chicken and mushrooms in a wok and used the broth to cook the rice in. Then I scrambled 3 eggs (bc I love eggs), added 2 Tbs garlic (bc garlic is AMAZING!), then added frozen peas and corn until cooked through. Finally, I added the rice, chicken and mushrooms. It was incredible!!!! Thanks for the basics!

What a wonderful way to use up extra rice. I used rice I had frozen!  It was easy and very tasty!  I will definitely make this again!  It also lends itself to adding other ingredients.

I  make this every time I have a lot of leftover plain rice. We sometime order kabobs from a Persian place by us and they come with tons of rice. The kids are more excited about the fried rice that will be made the next day, using the leftover rice , than with the kabobs themselves..
I have made this recipe , with beef bacon and with turkey bacon. The other good thing about this recipe, beside tasting good, is the use of only one pan. Easy cleaning after you're done making it.

Made this tonight to go with the Firecracker Salmon, also on this site.  It was amazing!  The only change was that I used 3 strips of bacon instead of 6 because it was all I had -- and it was plenty!  This was a company-worthy meal!

Thank you Kikkoman for posting a great fried rice recipe that graciously accepts any additional tidbits I add.  It's good on its own too.  :-)

I rarely keep meat in the house, so I used butter instead of bacon grease. My children devoured this! I baked my rice ahead the night before, so this was ready in minutes. I also served sauteed mushrooms over mine as my "meat".

Fast and easy fried rice.  I used 2 eggs beaten and omitted the bacon.  It was delicious!  My family couldn't get enough!

I added shredded/chopped carrots onions and celery. I also made the bacon bite sized. I also cooked it a little differently. First I cooked the bacon and set it in a bowl then did the same with the eggs. I then cooked the celery carrots and onion until browned. I added the eggs and bacon to the vegetable mix, simmered for five minutes than added the rice, soy sauce, and minced onion.

Good! Easy dish. Especially when you do not have fancy things like "fish oil" or other non traditional kitchen ingredients.

It's pretty good. However, if you add sesame oil it will make it taste closer to take out fried rice. Just add it to taste no exact measurements.

Made the Fried Rice along with the baked Teriaki Chicken and it was amazing.  I strongly suggest them both.

I was surprised at how good this recipe was and it was really easy. I added another egg as some reviews said, but other than that I followed the recipe as written. I put more soy sauce on my own serving but that's just my taste. My husband and teenaged daughter ate it as is and both had seconds. I think next time I will mix the onion in with the bacon and egg to sauté. Obviously the bacon and egg continue to cook when you move them to the side of the skillet so maybe move them before they're quite done.  It was really good with a sweet & sour chicken (Pinterest). Will definitely make this one again.

I give this a four only because I did change it a bit. I almost didn't review for this reason but after I changed it I felt I needed to share. To start I did two eggs instead of one and I think I will add another the next time. I add half a regular onion on top of the green onion, more what I am use to with fried rice. I added about two cups of peas and carrots I had microwaved for maybe three minutes first, I can't have fired rice without peas. The other big change I made was I made Japanese Shrimp Sauce from this site to go with the meal and when I added the soy sauce I also added about 3/4 a cup of the sauce. Made it taste very close to the rice you get at the Japanese Steak house. My hunny did complain that the bacon added a strange texture so I think next time I won't cook it so long before I start adding other things to the pan.

This was awesome. I fried the bacon and removed than the eggs and removed. Then I used regular onions and cooked them a little bit to soften before I put the rice in. No more take out for me, next time I may add shrimp or chicken, but its good as is.

We added fried spam, left over pork tenderloin and some corn.  No bacon.  We also added sesame oil and a little oyster sauce..  Loved this.

This was excellent and tasted as good, if not better than fried rice from our favorite take out Chinese restaurant. I would never have thought of using bacon, but it added so much flavor. I have made this 4 times already and there was never any leftovers!

This is the best fried rice recipe I've ever made.  The others just don't taste right.  I cut the rice down to 3 cups and the soy sauce down to 2 tbs.  I also used half a bag of bacon bits instead of bacon slices.

Tasty, and close enough to what we love at restaurants that we will be making it again. I did add more seasonings, and tossed in a defrosted package of frozen peas and carrots, but mostly did the recipe as written.

This was fantastic!!  I was nervous to try it (I'm not a great cook by any means!).  My son has been asking me to make fried rice, so I did and it turned out awesome!  Everyone loved it!!!  I threw in some frozen peas and carrots (gotta sneak the veggies in!) and they all loved it - a picky 12, 9, and 7 year old!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a really tasty dish.  I made it as directed and served as a side dish at a cook out with ribs.  Most had seconds (a true review) and several wanted the recipe.  No need to change anything it's good the way it is.  A keeper! Thanks!

Very good recipe.  The bacon is a great addition.  My first time ever making fried rice.  I'm sure the recipe is great just the way it is written but .I added some diced ham, shrimp, and chicken.  Kind of made it a house fried rice. EXCELLENT!!

Followed recipe exactly, but in the end I added 2 more eggs and more soy...it was just to dry.
Other than that...it was great.

This was a great, quick recipe.  I changed a couple things...used diced ham instead of bacon and the rice was hot as I didn't have time to cool it.  Nevertheless, it was great and everyone enjoyed it!

Delicious! The closest recipe to the rice that my friends from China used to make when I was a kid!  I added carrots as well.  :)
