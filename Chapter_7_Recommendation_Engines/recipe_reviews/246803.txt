I made this just now and it's delicious. Not too much like guacamole, great spread for toast, I had a whole wheat bagel to put mine on. My avocado was small so I halved the other ingredients.

Delicious! 
This was my first avocado toast experience, although I do eat them. I was only making for myself so changed the servings to 1. Decided to omit the oil, and used lime juice instead. I also didn't have fresh parsley so left that out. I really enjoyed this. Topped mine with an egg for a complete meal. Thanks!

I've been avoiding the avocado toast fad...until I ran out of things in the kitchen. I made this and fell in love! I smashed the avocados briefly after mixing all other ingredients to add more chunkiness to the presentation. I felt the quantity of spices were perfect. I double toasted the bread to make it crisp and to avoid soggy bread.

Made as written and added a fried egg as the recipe submitter mentioned. The one thing I think would have been better is to use cilantro instead of parsley. This was good and one I will make again.

Ok - don't let the word Vegan and avacado scare you off for breakfast.  Coming from an egg and scrapple guy (yea, I live near Philly), this is awesome.  Like others I put an egg on top for protein, and maybe a little more pepper - but this is very, very good.

I appreciated this for the simplicity! It was tasty and helped me use up my extra avocado before it went bad.  I may throw a fried egg on top for a protein boost next time.

I love this recipe. My wife would always order this at an overpriced brunch spot in our Brooklyn neighborhood, so now I'm thankful that I can make it at home. I like to top my avocado today with shaved radishes and a poached egg.

I followed the recipe and topped it with halved cherry tomatoes, crumbled feta cheese, and a fried egg .  It was extremely good and filling.   I was duplicating what we had at a restaurant and it was very close.

This was excellent! I made a few edits based on what I had at home: I used sourdough bread, cilantro instead of parsley, no onion powder, and added a dash of Tabasco sauce. I hadn't been able to get the oil/lemon juice ratio right before this recipe, and my avocado toast never felt as cohesive because I would add all ingredients on top of the mashed avocado & bread, rather than mixing it all beforehand. The ratios and pre-mixing made a big difference. Great recipe, thanks!

Loved it. My husband even liked it and he hates avocados. I will be making it again. I added vinegar and not lemon juice. My husband doesn't like lemons. This recipe is tangy and creamy. Works really well with eggs. I add extra pepper.

Delicious!  I plan to save some for later....that didn't happen.    I tried with toast, crackers and semi-toasted bread also.  It's best with well toasted bread.  The seasonings are balanced well and provides a very nice flavor.  Will be making this one again!

I had a small avocado that needed to be used, and this fit the bill. The amounts of the ingredients added were according to my own preference. I couldn't find my parsley so I added dried cilantro; lime juice would work here if you didn't have the lemon available. It was a nice light lunch on a hot day. I can see adding an egg for protein, as some reviewers mentioned. UPDATE 8/2/17:  Liked it better with lime juice,  all ingredients except no parsley or cilantro, and topped with a little crushed red pepper flakes. Simple & delicious.

I don't like onion, so i did it without. To my taste it was too sour. I'll cook it again, as it's a very hearty and fairly quick breakfast, but I'll add less lemon juice.

Fantastic! Instead of adding a fried egg, I added a hard-boiled egg and mashed it up with the rest of the mix.

I have made this at least 1/2 dozen times. It is absolutely delicious. On a trip to Cali we had avocado toast at a sidewalk resturant in Venice beach; I was hooked. When I got home looked on allrecipes, and this tastes even better than the Cali version!

Just made this and it’s delicious! Had only dried parsley so added 1tbsp (instead of 2 fresh) and omitted the oil. Not sure why that ingredient is even listed, it’s not needed! Added sliced tomato on top. Thanks! This was my first ‘avocado toast’ and definitely not my last.

This was a tasty, not fancy avocado toast recipe!! The only change I made was I omitted the olive oil and used a little plant butter on the toast before I spread on the avocado mixture. Very yummy! Great topped with some fresh tomato, too!

Great recipe - I loved it and so did my 2 year old. We skipped the parsley since we didn't have it available, and tried it on both white bread and gluten-free whole grain bread. Next time I'll try it with parsley and use less lemon, since it was a little too tart using 1/2 lemon.

I made it without parsley since I didn’t have any and I substituted calamansi for lemon cuz we have a tree that has fruit year round.  Probably would’ve been better with lemon or more ripe calamansi since mine were still green, making it more sour than sweet.  I made half the portion.  It’s too salty for me...  I’d say it better to just salt to taste.  Added chia seeds after spreading the avo.  Will try to make it again!

The seasonings gave it good flavor, but 1/2 tsp of salt was a bit much. I’ll decrease the salt & lemon next time. I sprinkled a little bit of cumin on top just because I like cumin!

This was my first and only experience making and eating avocado toast. I started with the mashing, but then just scraped all of the ingredients into the food processor. Much quicker. Also, I think sprouts would be a nice touch for next time.

I did not have parsley so used cilantro instead.   I added cherry tomatoes.  Used two slices of whole grain bread instead of four and added one egg.  Satisfying!

I’ve never been a fan of avocados but we’re trying to incorporate more healthy fat in our diet so I thought I’d give this a try!  When I made this I didn’t have any fresh parsley so I used the cilantro that I had on hand, and I only used half of the avocado so obviously, I halved the other ingredients as well. I tried it first without the egg and decided that I like it best with the fried egg on top of it. I’ll definitely be making this again. It tasted great!

Easy to make! I liked it much better once I skipped the lemon juice. (Although I did use lemon-flavored olive oil once since that’s what I had on hand, and that tasted good.) Like many others, I often add a fried egg on top. A splash of balsamic vinegar gives it a little zing.

I made this for my breakfast this morning so scaled it to serve just 1. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used fresh cilantro like one other reviewer I read and left out the garlic powder. I pretty much eyeballed the portions and it turned out very good. I used it on my favorite bakery bread. I'd never thought of using avocado for breakfast but will certainly make it again for breakfast or even a snack. Thanks Carolyn for the recipe.

Yum!  Fast. Easy. Delicious.  The crisper the toast the better.  Placed tomatoes on top to add some more veggies for it to be a small meal. Ate on gluten free Eban's bread. Will do it again.

This tasted great and was so easy to make. I made a couple of changes. I added a little bit of olive oil, and a very small amount of lemon juice.   I served it on gluten-free rice crackers and a slightly peppery hard cheese ..
It was amazing!

This is good, but I think it has too much of all the ingredients except the avocado. I just used a sprinkle of everthing and only 1/4 a lemon. We only got 2 servings. This is the first time I've tried avocado on toast, and this recipe made me like it.

Since I was doing 1 serving and in a hurry I used about 1/3 of an avocado, just added pepper, lemon juice and topped it with a fried egg all on a slice of toasted pumpernickel rye.  Excellent!

Only half the salt is enough.  Add more after tasting just in case.

It was very tasty. I added a few more seasonings. It was perfect on toasted whole grain bread.

It was pretty good although the garlic proportions are a bit off and I would recommend using less.

I didn't add in the pepper but other than that I followed the recipe, and it turned out just fine. It tastes much better than plain avocado toast.

This was very easy to make and turned out great.  I topped it with a slice of tomato.  I will make this again soon.

I never cared for avocado until I found this recipe. I'm trying to eat healthier foods so I was determined to find something. This is the recipe that won me over. I have it on toasted chia cracked rye from Izzio. Excellent bread as well.

Very good.  I used half lime juice and half lemon juice.  I cut the salt in half, and added dried diced jalapeño for extra flavor.  I didn’t have garlic powder so I used a more garlic paste. Then serves it on Ezekiel bread and sprinkled it with crumbled feta. Wish I had some chopped tomatoes

This was very good though my avocado was not as ripe as I hoped.  Since it was small, I adjusted the ingre. and enjoyed it very much.

It was OK, but it was too bitter for me with that quantity of lemon juice.

I *love* avocado toast! My Nana used to make almost this exact recipe for me when I was little. We would go out into the yard and pick an avocado, warmed by the sun, and bring it inside to make fresh avocado toast. The only thing she did different was use less salt and sometimes use a little dot of mayo instead of olive oil. YUM! Thank you for bringing back the taste of my childhood! =)

I followed the original recipe with one avocado and it was way too strong. Luckily I had a second on hand to "water it down." The recipe was great! Will make it again

I just made this for breakfast and I'd say it's very filling and more than anything very healthy. Although I don't measure just eyeball ingredients but followed the recipe.  I just added paprika in the mix and sprinkle on top with toasted almond slivered and toasted sesame seeds that I have on hand. Hubby said it was Delishhhhh!

This is delicious but I did make a few changes. I reduced the garlic and onion powder to 1/4 tsp and reduced the oil to a drizzle. After spreading it on my toast I topped it with a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and coarse ground salt. I was trying to mimic a favorite coffee houses Avocado Toast Smash and this fit the bill!
