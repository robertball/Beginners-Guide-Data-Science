This is such a fun idea!  I made these for April Fools this year, using Pillsbury Orangesicle frosting for the "cheese" and the Buttermilk Pound Cake II recipe from this site for the bread.  That bread is a bit crumbly for this application, but with some careful handling, it still made for a very fun presentation--plus the orangesicle complements plain pound cake perfectly!  Highly recommended project for your little ones--mine both loved it!

This was hilarious.  Too bad the "critic" of this recipe apparently has no sense of humor.  I bet they're fun at parties.  I know I will be though because I'm so making this again.

This is hilarious.  I stumbled across this recipe and it is June. I am not waiting until next April. We are having a family vacation in a few weeks and I cant wait to spring this on the grand-kids. Grandma's grilled cheese will never be the same again.

Loved this! I don't typically "grill" my grilled cheese sandwiches, I brown them in my skillet. So as not to give away the trick, I browned the slices in butter and they turned out great! Fooled my husband!

Sear marks are key. I used an old-school electric sandwich maker.

Rating it for the novelty. I served this with April fools meatloaf cupcakes from this site. My kids and hubby had no idea until they began eating. It was pretty cool. I did use marshmallow fluff instead of frosting, seemed a lesser of 2 evils. It worked though!! Thanks for setting me up for an awesome mom moment.
