I really, really wanted to like this based on 500+ reviews, but the recipe is written to loosely....  1 bunch of fresh cilantro is overpowering.  I had to experiment  to find a balance that didn't end up tasting like straight cilantro.  1/2 a small bunch would be a good estimate.  Otherwise, this was a good base to build on for personal taste.

Cream cheese,cilantro and spices. How can you go wrong? I had no idea what a "bunch" of cilantro was precisely though; so I used about 1/2 cup (loosely packed)of fresh chopped; probably 20 pieces) Cilantro is a very strong, distinctive flavor and I probably could of used less. But, I love cilantro and I love med spicy salsas, so this is a dip that I will make again and again.  I am just not sure if I like it best on "Southwestern Eggrolls" or for "Black Bean Pinwheels" best though... or maybe... on steak fajitas... or maybe on spicy-mesquite chicken tacos...   Truly a fresh tasting, delicious dip for MANY different things! Just make sure you like the flavor of cilantro. Oh, FYI;this will be slightly "lumpy" if you do not have your cream cheese at room temperature. And, it will be AS spicy HOT AS THE BRAND YOU USE  of tomatilla salsa (there are hundreds of different kinds;hot med, mild etc. just like any other salsa) Hope this helps you make it "5 star" for you... :)

Excellent recipe! We added 1 Tbsp. chopped jalapenos for some extra spice.  Great with everything-- as a dip, spread, filling, sauce, etc. BTW, "tomatillo salsa" is also known as "Salsa Verde"-- definitely use the whole 7 oz. can to get the creamy consistency and delicious "green" taste.

I love this dip!  I served it at our 4th of July party and everyone loved it.  I made it again today and used only 1/4 tsp of cumin but added more sour cream and cream cheese and it was much better.  Will be perfect on grilled chicken, fish and much more.

This sauce is great!  I catered an office party and had so many requests for this recipe.  Served with fresh vegetables & pita crisps as a dip.  It will also be fantastic as a sauce for fresh fish & chicken.

Oh my God, this is so good! I use it as a dip for lime tortilla chips and everyone loves it! The first time I made it, I couldn't find tomatillo salsa, so I used Pace Chipotle and it turned out great! Later, I did find the tomatillo salsa and it was just as great!

very good, but it makes too much, I think...my guests ate only about half...from the reviews i thought it would all be gone. will make again though, it's perfect with Southwest Eggrolls. I use salsa verde most of the time, because I've never been able to find tomatillo sauce.

This is great! It is even better if it sits for a day to let the flavors combine - but it usually doesn't last that long!

Easy to make and very delicious!  Versatile sauce - can be a bread dip or a taco or burger sauce!  I substituted garlic salt instead of powder - big mistake - too salty.  It might be good if you substituted basil & sun-dried tomatoes for the cilantro also.

Wonderful!  We are having a pool party as we speak and I just had to run in a drop a thank you line to Amykins!  Thank you!  I also used a food processor and did not have any trouble with it blending or not being creamy.  Thank you again Amykins for giving us this wonderful recipe!

FANTASTICO!  I softened my cream cheese in the microwave on "defrost/fish" for 1.5 minutes.  Also cut back on the cilantro this first time because I didn't want to be overwhelmed.  A jar of LaVictoria salsa verde (medium) fit the bill.  Make it a day in advance so the flavors can get happy together. Fresh, unique and so very tasty!!   I foresee many uses for this!

I made this to go with Southwestern Egg Rolls.  The bowl was scraped clean at the end of the night!  I could not find a can of tomatillo salsa so I used salsa verde instead.  I also olnly used 1/2 a bunch of cilantro as recommended from other reviewers.  This recipe makes allot so I would recommend cutting it in 1/2 unless you want left overs (you wont have a problem using it up!) This would taste great on a burger!

Amy, Amy, Amy ......... I am BEYOND picky about the recipes which I consider great on this website.  I don't do bland.  I don't do average.  I want my calories in food to be worth the pounds I might add to my frame.  I never just take a recipe and make it as is.  I read pages upon pages of ratings to make a determination about taste 'worthiness.'  Your wonderful, simple cream sauce is THE taste I've been trying to find for years.  I love doing southwestern style egg rolls, but have been trying to make the key dipping sauce for them without success (i.e., has to complement the egg roll, not overpower it). YOU, Amy, are THE woman!  Excellent flavor, consistancy, color as submitted.  I bow to you!

Made this as written and it was delicious when served with Southwestern Egg Rolls from this site.  Very likely will use again with fish or shrimp tacos.

I just got done making this for our family/come-one-come-all Christmas Eve tomorrow and if it gets any better after sitting a day I don't know if I can stand it!  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to add minced garlic from a jar instead of garlic powder.  I only did that because when I grabbed the bottle of powder I realized I only had about 1/2 tsp and I was making a double batch; so I had to do some quick math!  This is so very good and I'm thinking of all sorts of things it can go on.  It's limitless!  My only error was in doubling the batch because I just didn't think it would make very much. But I found that one batch made a full three cups.  No bother.  I like it so much I don't think it will be a problem!  Thank you Amy!

Made exactly as written.  We enjoyed this very much as a dip with the Southwestern Egg Rolls recipe from this website.  (Also, tomatilla salsa and salsa verde are one and the same product, if you're on a hunt at the grocery store as I was; the #1 ingredient on the ingredient list of salsa verde is tomatillas.) Thank you for sharing your recipe, Amykins!

Delicious!  My husband and I like our sauces just a bit spicier so I added two large jalapeno's.  Wonderful flavor combination.  Served this with melon/manchego cheese skewers for a party.  Very popular!  Way to go Amy!

i gotta give this 5 stars, because i HATE cilantro ( tastes like soap to me.) but i did some minor changes to the recipe...i used half the fresh cilantro called for. it tasted like a fancy ranch dressing to me. i do hate cilantro, but this, after a cilantro challenge was issued...yep it's dang good!

This is AWESOME!!!  It saved my dinner tonight.  I used it with fish, but it was tasty as a chip dip (frito scoops) as well.  I couldn't find any tomatillo sauce, so I once again turned to allrecipes and found "salsa de tomatillo" & used a very hot pepper, great sauce!  Thanks Amy!!

I used a verde (green) salsa because I couldn't find tomatillo salsa and served it warmed over lightly sauteed chicken breast tenders and it was a huge hit!  Can't wait to make it again; very easy.  THX Amykins!

This is great!  You really can't mess this one up.  I sometimes omit the cream cheese and add avocado.  I tossed a version of this recipe with slaw to put on shrimp tacos.  They were awesome!!

This was so awesome! I used this sauce to dip southwestern eggrolls in from this site.  It didn't look very good at first unti I blended it.  Very tasty dip :)

I couldn't find tomatillo sauce so I used El tapatio hotsauce and it still turned out soooo good.

Mine wasn't as green as Amy's but it was OUT.  OF.  THIS.  WORLD.  GOOD.  Oh, my goodness.  This was a big hit at a party I went to.  I took the suggestion of other users and didn't add a whole bunch of cilantro.  I used maybe half of a bunch (maybe a little more than half) and it was perfect.  I served this with tortilla chips and crackers and it was off the chain.  I will definitely make this again.

I made it as stated and had to double the cream cheese and put in half a cup of sour cream just to make it edible.  It was SO salty and so garlicy.  I do want to try it again with the cream cheese, tomitillo, sour creem, lime, and cilantro the same.  I'll use celery seed or celery leaves instead, omit the garlic, and lessen the cumin and pepper.  I think it'll be delightful then.

OUTSTANDING!!!  I've been using this recipe for almost a year (I know I'm late posting a review) and I always get great compliments.  Almost everyone asks for the recipe, and I direct them here.  My favorite thing to do with this sauce is to add olive (or veggie) oil to make it into a salad dressing. ** Think El Torito Caesar Salad dressing** this is pretty much a replica if you add the oil.  Thanks for sharing - My husband, kids, and I enjoy this often!

Excellent!  Do not wait to try it, or you will be missing out.  I am not the biggest fan of cilantro, so only put in about 1/2 a bunch and it was fine.  As someone else mentioned, it does thicken in the refrigeration.  When you first make it, it is pourable, more like a sauce, but after chilling, it is more "dip like."  Either way, very good.

This was a delicious sauce.  I served this with black bean pinwheels and the combination was great.  Was also a good veggie dip.  Obviously this is a green (think minty!)dip due to the cilantro.  This could be a turn off to some.  I put a sign on the dish with the name so people knew what it was.  You either love or hate cilantro - if you love cilantro this sauce is for you!

I used this as an enchilada sauce and it turned out great! I added it to cooked, shredded chicken inside the tortilla and then smothered the top of the tortillas/casserole with the rest of the sauce before baking. Yum!

This was just OK for me.  Not bad but not KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF either.  I couldn't find tomatillo salsa in my grocery store, so I used regular and I omitted the celery salt because I don't care for the taste.  It turned out to be a pretty dish and somewhat tasty.  It helps to microwave your limes or lemons for 10 seconds before you squeeze them.  You will get a TON more juice out of them.  I might experiment with this and add fresh garlic next time instead of the powder.  That might make this a 4 star recipe.  I will make again though.  Thanks for the recipe, Amykins!

Yum!  This was really good and very spicy.  I served it over grilled chicken.  I used a little more than 1/3 cup chopped cilantro and it was just a bit strong, but still quite good.  Next time, I will cut it back to 1/3 cup or slightly less. To save on sodium, I used 1/2 tsp. of celery salt and 1/2 tsp. of celery seed.  Also ate it with tortilla chips.  This is thick like a dip, not really a sauce.

This turned out WAY too hot for my family to eat.  I even added an extra block of cream cheese to try and cool it down but wound up throwing the whole thing away. I must have gotten some really spicy tomillia salsa.  I'll try this again with regular salsa.

Amykins, this is wonderful!  Thank you for sharing!  I used the food processor since the blender was being used for margaritas, and it blended just fine!  We used as a dip with tortilla chips, and I can hardly wait to try it on grilled fish.  Thanks again, Amy, for sharing this great recipe!

Fabulous recipe! I've made this about 5 times now, it's always a crowd pleaser. We use it as a dip for tortilla chips mostly, but today also served it as a sauce/dip for little beef empanadas. I recommend using the blender instead of the food processor, it mixes up better and smoother, and enhances the flavor.

Very easy to make too, just throw everything in the food processor and your done.  I used low fat cream cheese and it worked well too.

The sour cream, cream cheese, cilantro and lime where a perfect base to add what ever else you have on hand. Love the consistancy, I't can be used for so many different applications.

Ate it with chicken fajitas. And then as a dip. Very similar to some dip i have had at a mexican place close to here. I like it. Going to make southwest eggrolls tonight and use it for that too. Might even work as a salad dressing. Made 2 cups.

New. Favorite. 

2/6/11 - Added about a 1/4 cup of mayo to get a creamier texture. Family loved it for superbowl. I couldn't get enough.

I made this sauce today to serve with fish tacos.  Yum! It was great on the fish tacos and also with tortilla chips.  It was moderately spicy when I first made it but after refrigerating it for a few hours, it was not spicy to us.  Not sure why???

This was tasty. I added a little extra sour cream to make it more the consistency I was looking for.

Excellent. After tasting it as is, I did add just a 1/2 tsp. more cumin. We had this on enchiladas and it really took it over the top. My husband especially raved about this.

Made this with all fat free ingredients and used a blender.  It came out perfect and was amazing with grilled redfish and trout.

We love cilantro and we LOVE this dip!  It is great on chips, wraps and we love to put it on grilled out hamburgers (for a little kick).  It is sooooo good!  Thanks a bunch!

UPDATED REVIEW: I've made this several times as a dip, but made it recently with Salmon. I seared the Salmon in some Olive Oil and salt/pepper. Then, the last few minutes of cooking, I put the sauce on, just to get cooked through. EXCELLENT! Such a great combination! Thanks!!

This dip is good with anything, we tried it with pretzels and loved it.  Will be using it with everything.  The fresh taste of the cilantro and lime juice really stands out.  We all loved this one.

wow...wow...ummmm...WOW!  This recipie is phenomenal! What's even better than the taste is that it makes A LOT!  I made this to compliment a mexican dish and it was great.  However I had so much left over I devised a way to use the remainder later in the week.  I spread it over tilapia filets and pan fried in olive oil...oh my was it good!  The cilantro cut the fishy taste of the tilapia and the fish cut the strong cilantro taste for a perfect blending of flavors.  In my opinion this sauce was even better as a sauce for fish than its original use.  You just gotta try it!  Thank you so much Amy for such a wonderful and versatile recipie!

This sauce is awesome. As with most any recipe, one can adjust the ingredients to suit your own personal tastes, but we like it as is. Since cumin and cilantro can both be a tad overwhelming for some, those are the only 2 ingredients that I would suggest folks add slowly. This stuff is good alongside a good guacamole dip served with warm tortilla chips. Also good with pork-filled tortillas. YUM!

This was the most *awesome* recipe ever!  I made it to bring to a family get together, and everyone demanded that I send them the recipe.  Even though we had a reservation at an all-you-can-eat restaurant, we still gorged ourselves with tortilla chips and this dip/sauce!  Didn't have any tomatillo salsa, so I chopped up some marinated jalapenos, which gave it just the right "bite".  So fabulous...I can't wait to make it again and try it over some white fish fillets (ie orange roughy, tilapia) or with pita triangles.

Seriously - this is an excellent dip!  Very creative!  I used very chunky homemade salsa, and added half to blend with the other ingredients, then added the other half at the end.  The result was still chunky, and turned out perfect!  I am very impressed with this recipe - it will be great for a potluck, since it's inexpensive to make a large batch.  Thank you again!!

Oh my gosh how YUMMY.  I made this and omitted the salsa and had as a side sauce for halibut.  It was my first time cooking for my boyfriend.  He was very impressed.  Made me look good!  

Next morning I added salsa and ate with chips.  This recipe is the best.

Wow Amykins... you have come up with a great recipe.  I made some for about ten friends or so and they all loved it.  I also had some left for the next day and when I took the remaining portion to a family dinner they loved it as well.  Everyone has been asking me for the recipe.  Thanks a bunch, Michi in Miami

I've never taken the time to review a recipe before, but this one is fabulous.  I used it as a sauce on fish tacos, but I can see it used in so many other ways.  I did add the juice of the entire lime, rather than just a tablespoon.

I've made this a few times and it was a little spicy. This time I made it with LaVictoria medium Salsa Verde and my kids couldn't stop raving about it. We used it as a topping for empanadas one night and then for baked chicken and spanish rice the next night guacamole. It is also a great dip for appetizers. Thanks for the recipes!

Pretty good.. I was hoping it would taste similar to the cilantro ranch dressing served at Cafe Rio in Utah - but it didn't.

It was still good though, I used it to make chicken tacos and a black bean salad. I simply chopped the chicken and lettuce I wanted to use, put the dressing on the food in a container with a lid, and shook. 

Then placed the chicken, black beans, and salad (now covered in dressing) into a taco shell, added some diced tomatoes and some shredded cheese.

I didn't have cream cheese OR tomatillo salsa but I did have cilantro that was threatening to go bad on me and wanted to make this, so I made a simple white sauce (2tbs butter 2tbs flour 1C milk) and added some green enchilada sauce, cilantro, garlic salt and lime juice. It was very delicious w/a little kick of heat. I am sure once I try the cream cheese it will be 5 star! I know I changed it up some but sometimes you have to use what u have or have it go bad, so I hope this helps someone out there missing an ingredient to be brave & try it anyway!

Wow, thank you Amy for allowing me to top my sister's appetizers on Christmas Eve! This was great. I thought the celery salt was overpowering but it mellowed overnight so I wouldn't change it. But for my taste, definitely more lime!
Made it a second time and added a half a tub of sour cream to thin it out and used it for rice/bean bowls. Great sauce.

I made 5 different dips for veggies & salty snacks for holiday family gatherings and I could have just made this and saved myself some time! EVERYONE (on both sides of my family) loved this one and all wanted the recipe - it goes with just about everything and is a new staple. I used 1/2 bunch cilantro and tomatillo sauce is salsa verde.

I used low fat cream cheese and sour cream (so sauce is thinner) and cut the garlic in half since we don't like a heavy garlic taste.  Tasted the sauce at this point and found it to be kind of bland and not have a big cilantro taste.  Added another 3/4 bunch of cilantro (the bunches were very small) and a healthy pinch of cayenne pepper.  Tasted again and much better.   Great base recipe and will enjoy modifying this to my family's tastes.

I love this sauce. Tastes better with each passing day. Used this on everything:empanadas, fish, steak, chicken.  I used parsley instead of cilantro and used regular salt instead of celery salt because it was what I had on hand.  Halfed everything but the sour cream and green salsa.  Made plenty. Oh did I mention it was sooooo good.

My family loves this dip.  I also like to use it in place of sour cream on nearly any Mexican food.  The perfect recipe for us is to up the cumin by half, add 1/4 tsp cayanne pepper, and 1 seeded jalapeno.  We like it with a little more umph!  I generally like to let it set for a couple hours in the fridge to let the flavors meld.  Everytime I've made this for guests, they always want the recipe!

Delicious!  Lots of subtle flavors and pretty color.  My husband added a whole jalapeno while we were blending to spice it up.  It made the color even better and was still great.  I couldn't taste all the subtle ingredients with the jalapeno in it but it was still wonderful.  I could just eat this alone with a spoon.  Will make again and again.

This sauce is AMAZING! It's the perfect compliment to the recipe for the Southwest Eggrolls on this site. It's pretty quick and easy and can also be frozen and thawed and still tastes great!

Loved this with the Southwestern Egg Wraps. This dip had a touch of spicy with the added cool of the lime juice.

I've been looking for a good creamy green sauce for home and this is definitely a keeper! It's a perfect versatile sauce that I use for all my mexican food. I didn't have celery salt on hand so that is the only change I made to the recipe.

Very tasty and totally customizable with your favorite salsa in place of the 7 ounce tomatillo salsa.  I made it as written except I didn't have celery salt, but I didn't feel it was lacking in salt when I tasted it.  This sauce is excellent on Southwestern Egg Rolls and Fish Tacos!

Yum, yum, yum and YUM!!  Simple, delicious, authentic tasting.  Loved this!  We added just a touch of habanero for our heat preference.  Served this as a dip for southwest eggrolls........and wound up putting it on the jalapeno burgers........the rice....dipping the sliced peppers in it......if it held still....it got this sauce.  Slap your momma good stuff!!

This sauce is EXCELLENT! I used the Tomatillo Salsa Verde from this site to make it, rather than store-bought salsa. The only thing I did different was to use half the amount of cumin in each recipe (since I don't really like the overly taco-y flavor of cumin), used 2 Tbsp sour cream (light) instead of 1, and used onion salt instead of celery salt because I realized at the last minute that I was out of celery salt.  Anyway, the flavor of this sauce is spectacular. One of the best sauces I have found on this site, EASILY. Great Job Amykins! I made it with the Southwest Egg Rolls recipe from this site, and the combination was phenomenal. As others have said, the amount of cilantro to use is subjective, but I've learned that less is more with cilantro, so better to use too little than too much. Especially since I made my own salsa, which called for a chunk of fresh cilantro as well. Now I'm going to make fish tacos just to put this ambrosia on.

This was tasty on shredded pork (leftover from a baked pork tenderloin) tacos with lettuce and monterrey jack cheese.  I halved the recipe, but followed it exactly. Since it was January when I made it, the cilantro I bought at the grocery wasn't quite as 'powerful' as the cilantro we grow in our backyard in the summertime.  I'll try this again then!

I made this recipe and used in as the "dressing" for a seafood pasta salad. I combined this recipes with one  8 ounce package of imitation crab and  approximately 10 ounces ( weight before cooking) of rotini pasta. Chilled til time to serve

2nd try:  I did not have whipping cream so followed the recipe.  I would add 2 Tlb. sour cream  1/4 tsp cumin and 1 Tbs. garlic salt.  This will still let the cilantro come throughl.
This was fantastic.  I used whipping cream and a tad of cream cheese.  Fantastic.  I could have used it as a dip but used it over sliced grilled chicken.  The kids said "yeck" when they saw it but "oh my gosh" when they tasted it.  Needless to say there were no leftovers and my oldest made a burrito.  Will use again and again.

I was a bit leary because the tomatillo salsa I bought was a bit spicy, so I started just adding about half.  Ended up adding all of it and it turned out wonderful.

We tried this recipe tonight for the first time. I made it verbatim to the directions, except I discovered I was out of garlic powder and instead used onion powder. I still loved the way it came out. It definitely tastes like cilantro which we love here in our household. We grilled salmon fillets and topped it off with this cream sauce - it was perfect! I think the sauce would be great with crab cakes too. I think it's very complimentary to seafood and we will try it with chicken as well.

I made this yesterday to go with the Southwestern Egg Rolls. Both were excellent! Beautiful fresh flavors with just a hint of heat. I can't wait to try it on other things. The only thing I changed was to use 1 tsp celery seeds and 1/4 tsp salt because I didn't have celery salt. Kudos!

Followed the recipe to a T and the taste of the cream cheese awas over powering. I would try this again but use yogurt instead. I thought this was going to a thin sauce but instead came out thick.

I almost tripled this recipe for a BBQ and didn't change much besides adding a bit more cumin and garlic to taste and used an immersion blender as there was too much to fit in a food processor. It was fantastic served with seasoned pita chips and sliced veggies, but guests quickly adopted the idea of pouring it over the chicken and beef skewers that were coming off the grill. I've already shared the recipe with many of the guests and it's an immediate staple for myself.

7/28: New use! I poured some of the cilantro sauce over cooked, cubed chicken breast, 1/2 cup black beans, 1/2 cup corn, 1/2 cup sliced jicama, 1/4 cup roasted red peppers and 1/4 cup chopped olives. Serve chilled with mini pita pockets for a GREAT "southwest" style chicken salad filling.

This would probably be fantastic IF the cumin and garlic powder measurements were reversed.  I used a generous 1/2 tsp of cumin and 1 1/2 tsp of garlic powder (I had a hunch that 2 tsp was too much) - and despite cutting back on the garlic powder it was still too much (I had a garlic aftertaste for hours afterwards).  Also - if you're looking to cut back on fat - try neufchâtel (1/3 less fat cream cheese).  I did use sour cream as called for but you can easily substitute yogurt as well (healthier - but since only 1 T is required it doesn't make much of a difference).  I served the sauce on top of grilled Red Snapper (marinated in fresh lemon and lime juice, chopped cilantro, salt, pepper, and cumin).

Very tasty.  We had a bbq and couldn't get enough of the stuff.  I used cilantro fresh from the garden.  Yummy.  Instead of tomatillo salsa, I substituted my husband's fresh tomato salsa.  Maybe made it better?

I was never able to find green salsa before, so I used to make this with a jalapeno pepper instead. It was fantastic. Last night I made this with salsa verde and no jalapeno, but as a result it was more like a sauce and not at all like a dip, even after refrigeration. Actually, some of the liquid separated from the sauce. As-is, the recipe is good as sauce; I'd omit the salsa or somehow drain it (?) next time if I want to use it as a dip. Also, I always use at least 2 cups of chopped cilantro, because I love it.

I usually don't make a recipe for the first time without
tweaking it some, but I followed the directions for this
recipe to a tee, and it was perfect! Used it as a sauce
over a spinach enchilada dish, and guests raved about
it. I've made this a number of times and noticed that
"one bunch of chopped cilantro" never gives you the
same amount each time - it can vary as much as a
1/4 cup. For me, 1/3 cup of finely chopped cilantro is
just right. The sauce works best when the flavors are
allowed to meld 4 or 5 hours, or longer. Truly a 5 star
recipe that's highly recommended! Thank you Amy.

Very tasty, used a little extra garlic and cilantro and therew in avacado because it was going to spoil. I tossed it with linguine, crushed red pepper, grilled pulled chicken breast, some fresh avacado slices, tomato, and red bell pepper. Delicious!

Fabulous! I only made one change. I didn't have talmitillo salsa, so I used Wal-Mart's brand of black bean and corn salsa. This ended up tasting EXACTLY like the dressing used on the Santa Fe Chicken salad at Applebee's. I served it with the Southwestern Egg Rolls from this site, and it was a hit!

Made this to go with Southwestern Egg Rolls. Fantastic. I added some extra cilantro just because I love it. This is a great sauce...make it today...you won't be sorry!

This is the best cilantro sauce ever!  We put this on anything...it's delicious to just dip with chips or to put on grilled chicken.  The whole family gobbles this up.  I did not have the celery salt so I just left it out, and I didn't have a lime on hand, so I used lemon juice.  After making it for the first time, I decided to try and make it nonfat, so I used fat free cream cheese and sour cream.  I wasn't thrilled with the results, but my family loved it just the same.  Next time I'm going to try light instead of nonfat...if I don't like that, I'm stickin' with the original....YUMMY!!!!  10 stars!!

This is devine!  I realized while I was eating it that I could add more sour cream and this would make a terrific salad dressing.

I've been wanting to try this recipe for the longest time.  Finally made it yesterday and served it as a dip with tortilla chips.  It was so yummy and has the most wonderful flavor.  It's really hard to stop eating it.  It would definitely be amazing on chicken or fish or whatever.  Will definitely be making this again.  Unless you don't like cilantro, I highly recommend this.

WOW!!!  I've been dying to try this recipe and it is just easy and tasty as I hoped it would be. The flavor of the cilantro, lime and cumin blend together perfectly for a wonderful treat.  We have used it as a dip for chips, a salad dressing for taco salad and also as a topping with fish tacos.  You cannot miss using this!  For a slight variation sometimes we will add just a pinch of chipotle chili powder for a slightly smoky taste and a little extra heat.  Definately one of our favorite recipes!!!

This is a delicious recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly and used the Faraon Tomatillo sauce.  It wasn't too spicy and was perfect!  I don't even know what I'm going to serve it with yet, but I'm having a Mexican-themed dinner party this weekend and it's going to be the perfect addition to everything.  Yum!

Wonderful!  The only thing I changed was to substitute jarred picante salsa ('medium' flavor) for the tomatillo salsa.  Big hit at my party!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellente!- Great on Salads - I cut the cilantro to 1/4 the bunch and added a jalapeno to spice it up !  I also used La Costena Salsa Verda (As the Tomatillo Salsa) and Fat Free Sour Cream and Cream Cheese - Sooooo Good !!! Definitely a keeper- Thanks Amykins!

I wish I could give more than 5 stars. This was so delicious!!!! I made it for the first time tonight for a dinner party. I only used about half the cilantro because I was tired of chopping, but it turned out perfectly. Didn't change another thing. It's 4:30 a.m. and I just ate cold chicken to have an excuse to eat this dip! Tip: let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before serving. It gives the flavors a chance to mix, and the coolness grabs your attention. If not for shame, I would have eaten it with a spoon! Lol. My father in law put it on his salad and loved it. I put it on my chicken kabobs, marinated with the chicken and bacon kabobs sauce from this recipe. I used chicken, squash, onion and pineapple on the skewer. This.sauce.was.amazing. I normally don't review recipes, but this one took the cake!!!

Oh Amy, This is a Academy Award Winning sauce ! I so love it ! It's easy, quick & perfect consistency.  I use a measuring Tablespoon on top of my Taco's, Bianca's Green Chile Pork, & Taylor Farms Southwest Salad. It has a Cilantro Dressing enclosed in the bag of salad mix, and I was wanting to duplicate it, this Cilantro Sauce is perfect, I just need to thin it a little more, maybe with buttermilk. Thank You  for sharing !

As many other stated in their review be careful on what you consider a "bunch of cilantro" I love cilantro but this was just too much. I had to add buttermilk and ranch dressing mix to make this edible.

This recipe is SO delicious! I used it as a sauce for a rice/quinoa bowl with chopped veggies--just as good as something I'd get at a restaurant. It seriously made for the best lunch I've had in a long time. I did add a little chopped jalepeno just because the salsa I got wasn't all that spicy. Thanks for sharing!

We used this sauce with out beer battered fish tacos and it was delicious!!  I couldn't find canned tomatillo salsa so I used a jarred brand that included cilantro and seasoning so I did have to cut back on the seasoning and cilantro in the recipe..but I really think that made it easier to prepare :).. Great recipe thank you so much for sharing.

I can't believe I've never rated this!  It's been on hand so many times in our house over the years, and we love it.  It's excellent on beef or chicken tacos, with tortilla chips, and my husband likes to slather it on black beans, tossed salad, and anything else he deems to be worthy of it.  This sauce is delicious, and perfect as written.  Thanks to Amy!

Great, easy recipe.  I made this as a dip for Allrecipe's Steak on a Stick recipe and turned out great!  Also use as a salad dressing.  Didn't have the tomatillo salsa,so just used a mild, fresh salsa. Used fresh-squeezed lemon since I didn't have a lime. Still very good. (Used my Magic Bullet to blend, felt like I could be in the commercial!)

I made this exactly the way it specified and I don't know what was wrong . Maybe a bunch of cilantro is waaaay too much.  I will try this again with less and more cumin.

This recipe is awesome.  I use it on my southwestern egg rolls and then I use anything else in the vicinity to mop it up with.

Really liked, I do agree with other reviews on the cilantro, might start small and build to your taste. Now considering the source here, cilantro is not my favorite but it has it's place and Amy has done a great job with this one.

This is fantastic!!!  Definitely make this ahead and let it chill.  This would also be great used on tacos/fajitas or maybe even hamburgers.

I am most definately NOT a fan of cilantro, but when my sister gave me a plant of it, I decided I would give it another go. I was making the 'Southwestern Egg Rolls' and decided to use this as a dipping sauce...AWESOME! I do have to say that I was scared to use all cilantro, so I used 1/2 cilantro and 1/2 parsley, and that was perfect for me. If you told me that I would be rating a cilantro recipe 5 stars, I wouldn't have believed it, but this is that good! It makes a bunch, so I'm looking forward to seeing what else I'm gonna use it on, lol. I will definately make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Extraordinary flavor - we just loved this! I think I used less of the ciliantro - half bunch is perfect - plenty of fresh flavor. I didn't have sour cream so I used a few tablespoons of half & half to thin it. Ran it through my immersion blender to incorporate some airiness. Terrific with southwestern egg rolls.

This was amazing and so easy to make. I literally put all of the ingrediants into the blender and that was it. My boyfriend came home and sampled the dip and said "wow babe this is unbelievable!" it was a huge hit at our cook out. Thanks for the recipe!!!

really good with the southwestern egg rolls from this site.  Very strong cilantrol flavor IMO.  You could cut back on it a little and it would be fine.  I added some sour cream to try and dull the flavor a bit.  It wasn't nearly as noticeable when you actually ate it with the egg roll though.

I followed the recipe as is except for the suggestion of using 1/2 a bundle of cilantro. Im glad that I followed that suggestion. I used pita chips to dip in it and then we also ate it with Tilapia. It was a good multi purpose dip. It went over quite well with all the guests!

EXCELLENT SAUCE!!  I made this last night for "Pub Grub" food to watch the fights.  I served it with Southwestern Eggrolls and also with fried shrimp.  I didn't have fresh cilantro on hand so I used 2 tsp of dried.  It turned out beautifully.  When all the finger foods were gone we used the sauce that was left over to dip corn chips in.

A definite 5-star!  I would suggest making only 1/2 of the recipe, however, because it makes a ton.  I am going to see if I can freeze it in small containers to use as-needed.  I used 3/4 bunch cilantro and 1/2 of a really hot jalapeno and only 1/2 the garlic powder ... the flavor was great.  We had it with the Rubbed and Grilled Pork Loin (from this site) and I used leftovers days later on shrimp fajitas. Really, really good on fajitas, I think I'll have to have it every time now!  I think it would also be fantastic on fish tacos.

Instead of tomatillos salsa I used salsa verde (tomatillos and spices). It gives the dip the perfect kick.

What a refreshing burst of great flavor! I always have garlic on hand and used 2 cloves instead of garlic powder and substituted ground sea salt for celery salt (only because I didn't have any) and it was great! I spread it on a veggie pita but it would be a great dip as suggested by others

I love Cilantro so this was a big hit with me. My DH said there was too much Cilantro so I guess you can judge how to measure 1 bunch fresh cilantro proportionate to your love of cilantro. I made fresh Tomatillo Salsa Verde with the recipe of that exact name on this site. Shout out to Dale for the fresh Tomatillos from her garden. Other sub was lemon for lime. I ate this with chips, breaded chicken breasts and some pan fried potato slices when I ran out of anything else to eat it with. Yes it was that good.

This is amazing. I omitted the tomatillo sauce and the celery salt because I didn't have them at hand. Also, I used fresh grated garlic, and since I had no fresh cilantro I used "Cilantro minicubes". These you can find in the Hispanic food section at WalMart and come in a small blue box, they are made by Knorr.

So far I've used it as a dip with yellow corn tortilla chips and as a sauce for a barbecue pulled pork sandwich.  It is tasty and I always like the combination of cilantro and lime.  I can see why this is a versatile dip/sauce.  I think I prefer it as a condiment.

OMG!! This is an AMAZING sauce!! Made it to go with some grilled salmon and haven't stopped thinking about the other dishes I want to have with it! I did omit the celery salt and cumin, cut the salt a bit and the garlic powder in half. Also added a bit of grated lime zest and a seeded jalepeno pepper for a bit of heat. WOWZER!! Going to use the leftovers on soft tacos made with the slow cooker carnita recipe on this site. This one will be made again and again!!

I don't usually like sour cream or cream cheese, but I made it when requested, and must say I was surprised by the flavor.  It had a great, unique flavor, and the only reason it gets only 3 stars is because I still couldn't get past idea that the sour cream and cream cheese were in there.  I will try it again, and I'm sure it will grow on me

Really good recipe! I did add a little Tony's seasoning and a little more blk pepper than was specified, but it was very yummy! My husband put it on a chicken sandwich and said it was awesome and we dipped tortilla chips in it and liked that as well. My 2 1/2 yr old even loved it! Will definitely be making this again!

This was great however, I gave it a three because I left out mayo and used sour cream instead. Will use again.

Oh my Heavens! This stuff is FINE!!!! Made it exactly as directed (even dug my food processor out of the garage) and LOVED it! Put it on fish tacos. Now I'm trying to figure what all else it would be good on..... Crab cakes anyone?!?! Thank you, Amykin!

Made this per the recipe. What a wonderful flavor! Just love it and can't wait to take it to the tailgate party today to serve with the Southwest Egg Rolls recipe from this site!! I'll update this review after the party.*** Update*** The sauce sat in the fridge for about 6 hours before going to the potluck. It was a hit and everything was getting dipped into it! It was a big hit at the party. I'm going to leave it at 5 Stars because of the versatility of the sauce/did but next time I'm going to cut back some on the Cilantro as it was a little too strong after it sit for a while.

Yum, yum, yum.  That's all I have to say.  But you have to love the flavor of cilantro.  Whenever I buy cilantro, I hardly ever use more than a little bit, so this recipe is the PERFECT way to use up that leftover cilantro.  Thank you!!

I made this for an office party where all of the ladies are dieting.  I made it with fat free cream cheese and fat free sour cream and followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone loved it.  I served it with raw veggies.  Will make again.

Excellent sauce/dip.  I made this to accompany the Southwestern Egg Rolls on the recommendation of other members, and I wasn't disappointed.  I used the entire bunch of cilantro, and it almost wasn't enough - I love the flavor.  I also added a diced jalapeno to increase the heat, and a touch more cumin and lime juice than was called for.  It was both spicy and flavorful, and extremely tasty.  The recipe made a bit more than was needed for the egg rolls, so I used what was left over as a dip for tortilla chips.  My fiance and friends all loved it.  I may add some avocado next time, since that would compliment the flavors of the sauce well.

This is excellent! I halved the recipe & it was more than enough to serve w/"Southwestern Egg Rolls" from here. I used dried cilantro, to taste. UPDATE 10/12/09: I was out of tomatillo sauce & lime juice but HAD to make this so I used regular mild salsa & lemon juice-still FANTASTIC, bowl-licking good!! Thank you Amy!!

Made this for the first time, amazing!  The entire party was commenting on it.  I couldn't find tomatillo salsa so made my own with 2 cloves garlic, 2 tomatillos 1/2 jallapino pepper cooked briefly, then added in food processor with the rest.  I drained the juice from the salsa so the sauce was nice and thick.  I'm making it again tonight to top fish.

Very well received at a pot luck I took it to! Many of us had done a walking food tour of Greenwich Village/NYC and the cilantro based sauce served along with the cooked yucca at the restaurant Cuba tasted so fresh...Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce reminded all of us of that yummy sauce!

Easy to make, tasted fantastic, and I will absolutely make this again and again. I, like some other reviewers, wasn't exactly sure what a "bunch of cilantro" meant so I used about a third of the massive amount "bunched together" in the grocery store. I found the flavor was not too heavy and not too light.  I used this as a chip dip, but I'm looking forward to other applications for it.

This sauce is SOOO good, but I love cilantro so maybe that's why.  My boyfriend does not like cilantro but actually ate the sauce.  I made it exactly as the recipe states.  We put it on top of shrimp quesadillas that I whipped up with frozen shrimp, black beans, veggies, and spices.  I definitely recommend this sauce.  I think it would be good on any type of mexican dish, or most seafood dishes.

YUM!
Whoever first made the suggestion of pairing this with the Southwestern Egg Rolls gets tons of kudos from me! 

I made one minor change, but the recipe is perfect as is. Instead of garlic powder I minced up a garlic clove, then I put that in the food processor with the cilantro. 
After a few seconds in the food processor I added the cilantro/garlic mixture to the rest of the ingredients in the blender. 
The result was a creamy smooth sauce. It has a slight kick from the tomatillo salsa but it's more of a medium kind of heat. 
I can think of a lot of ways to use this sauce/dip and I'm sure that I'll be making it again and again.

This sauce was great, I did have to jazz it up a bit. I added canned jalapenos (what I had in stock). I added extra cumin (as I love it so), fresh onions (green and white) and a tad bit more sour cream. I decreased the cream cheese. I served this over grilled chicken w/ onions and topped with cheese. I also made tortilla chips to use the sauce as a dip. My husband said this was one of the best meals I have made.

Fantastic! Everyone at my party raved about it.  I used reduced-fat cream cheese and sour cream and did not miss the extra fat!  Next time, I am going to try making it with non-fat cream cheese and sour cream or yogurt.

I make a cilantro stuffed chicken breast and this sauce accents it wonderfully.  The first time I made it I didn't have cream cheese so I just used sour cream and it turned out great!

Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!  I used fresh garlic and a bit of powdered ancho chili pepper to spice it up and put it on carne asada wraps - will use this on all kinds of dishes!

Five stars does not give this justice.  I made this to go with Chicken Lime Tacos (another five star recipe) and found myself eating it with everything: chips, veggies, bread.  I left out the cumin (just don't care too much for it), but it didn't compromise the flavor at all.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe, I cannot say enough about it.  FYI: if your not a big cilantro fan (like my bf) just use half (or even a third) of what's called for...suit it to your taste, I'm sure you'll still love this.

I made double the recipe with one bunch of cilantro, and added 8 oz. of sour cream.  It was great with fresh vegetables, and it makes a good bit.  I also let it sit in the fridge for a day before we ate it.  A great recipe, but I think you have to like cilantro!

Delicious.  I think it was better the second day though.  Served with the Southwestern Egg Rolls.

Maybe the size of the "bunches" sold at my store are significantly bigger than Amy's? The cilantro flavor completely overwhelmed the sauce and I only used half a bunch (about 1 c. tops). I doubled and tripled the spices, even added a jalapeno and serrano pepper but all I could taste was cilantro. I like cilantro so gave it two stars instead of one.

Addictive, and good on everything! Great on fish tacos, yummy as a dip. I tossed it with shredded cabbage and carrots last night, and made an awesome spicy cilantro slaw.

I made this recipe exactly as the recipe states and while it was good, it wasn't a 5 star for me. It was lacking something - but I couldn't put my finger on what it was lacking. It also was a bit too creamy for me, next time I'd put more of the salsa in it. Unfortunately, it was the only dip that no one ate at my party - no one really liked it.

Mmmmm, Mmmmm, this is wonderful, like another reviewer my husband is putting on everything, in sandwiches, over his veggies,on crackers, I keep spying him at the fridge lately and every time it is because of the Cilantro Cream Sauce.
Thank you.

I had printed this recipe months ago, but hadn't decided what I would serve it with.  I was given a bag of guatamalan tamales to bring to work to share with my co workers, I now had my dish to make this for.  I wish I hadn't waited.  This is a wonderful sauce for anything.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I made tri tip last night for dinner, and we dipped it in the sauce again, will use the left over tri tip for tacos later this week and I can't wait to use the sauce for that also!!

This dip was absolutely great! Everyone love it! It's a nice festive green color for the xmas season too! The salsa I used was by Herdez (salsa verde)and also the light cream cheese/sour cream to cut the fat. I didn't have all the spices the recipe called for. So, I used the cumin, and 2 teaspoons of garlic pepper salt. It turned out perfect! It would be great on breakfast burritos, eggs, enchiladas...

This was fantastic.  It was better than the cilantro cream sauce at our favorite Mexican restaurant.  We served ours over chicken burritos, and we had plenty left over to freeze for next time.  I was a little hesitant about using a whole bunch of cilantro, but it tasted great.

I finally found the tomatillo salsa and made the dish.  I was not that impressed. I put it in the refrigerator and will try it again after it chills.  I love Cilantro but the tomatillo salsa seems to take over.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  Couldn't find tomatillo salsa and used a green salsa instead (which was made with jalapenos).  A bit spicy but excellent! I think any kind of salsa would work.  Only used half the amount of cilantro the recipe called for and it turned out great.  Served this dip with lime chips and used the left over dip next day on grilled chicken with spanish rice.  Yum.  Definitely a keeper.

I gave this a 4 rating only because I think the cilantro is overwhelming. I wonder if there is a difference in the size of a "bunch" in different produce sections. I really like cilantro but it was way too strong for most of our guests tastes. I will definitely work on adjusting the amount of cilantro because I can see that this is has the basic potential of excellence when adapted to individual preferrences.

This stuff rocks!!  I made it for a picnic with my husband and he loved it.  We used it as a dip for grilled chicken strips.  I've used it as a topping instead of sour cream too.  The only thing I changed was to use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  Can't wait to find more dishes to use this with!

An easy but very tasty recipe. I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  Didn't add the ground cumin.  Added about a 1/4 cup of green onions.  I let it rest in the fridge for a couple of hours.  So good with veggies and chips.

The best recipe. We use it on chicken, beef and seafood and cheese and corn tortilla taquitos. And with chips.

To make it thicker, use more sour cream. I use about 8oz. 

I use Verdez tomatillo sauce, about 8oz. It's a little spicy...just the way I like it. However, the longer it is in the fridge, the spicy flavor intensifies. I have made this about 20 times. My family expects me to bring this over whenever we get together. Thank you amy!

I made this to serve with the Black Bean Pinwheels. It was good but more runny than I had anticipated, however, my husband pointed out it is called a 'sauce'.  Next time I would follow MarcyAnn's suggestion to add half of the salsa in the blender and the other half after blended. I also followed the other suggestions to use less cilantro but next time would use more (1/2 to 3/4 bunch).

I really enjoyed this recipe, however I did tweak it (as I do with most of the recipes that I have gotten from this site).  I was making this for a baby shower as a dip to serve with tortilla chips and I work with a lot of women who don't like really spicy food (which I love!)so I added 1 1/2 limes, and 8 oz of sour cream to tone down the Mrs. Renfro's tomatillo salsa (excellent, but very hot).  It came out great, but still spicy for some.  Great recipe!

Great tasting dip for tortilla chips. Substitue 1/3 less fat cream cheese and light sour cream for a low-fat version and tastes just as great!

This dip is great!! It tastes great with chips and I even made beef enchiladas with the sauce. I would not use a bunch of cilantro although it is rather overpowering.  I used 1/4 bunch.

Delicious, better than restaurants. Probably because it is fresh. My son made it. Be sure to soften your cream cheese. Salsa choice makes much of the flavor and heat so pick one you like, as some tomatillo  sauces in the jar are not so great.  We love cilantro so used most of a moderate bunch. Subbed Greek fat free yogurt as we had no sour cream, used light cream cheese. I think  better, fresher tasting than the heavier ingredients, but still very rich.

This is one great sauce.  I didn't change a thing .  I put it on top of lamb stew, dipped pita chips, and just ate spoonfuls of it.  Going to try it on fish tacos and as a spread on sandwiches and burgers.   Delicious.

I have been making this sauce for years now, but I never got around to writing a review. I have made this countless times and everyone that tastes it raves about it! One of our family favorites thanks!

Oh my goodness....what a wonderful cream sauce which can be used with southwest rolls, vegetables, and even on  burgers.  Its very tasty.  I assumed a bunch of cilantro was the bunch as sold at the grocery store and it turned out wonderfully.  I plan to make this again.

I used this while making chicken stuffed poblano peppers! I didn't bother with all the spices and I didn't add salt or pepper and I added an entire bunch on cilantro cause I love it. It was fantastic! I'm making it again tonight

Fantastic, fantastic dip!  Deceptively light and fresh.  The cilantro here comes sold in a bunch and I used the whole thing, it could have even used a little more so dont be cheap on the cilantro.

Oh my sweet Jesus I made this last night for my southwestern egg rolls I'm making today, wanted it to get happy overnight. I tasted the spoon after I just spooned into my container, it was the best dip/sauce I have ever tasted JUST blended. I think this is the beginning to a wonderful relationship.

I have never taken the time to rate a recipe, but I had to with this.  My family is a huge fan of cilantro.  This recipe was sooo easy to make and absolutely delicious!  My kids were using it to dip vegetables, chips, taquitos, etc.  Nice change from guacamole (huge fans of avocado as well).  It will definitely be part of many meals to come!  Can't wait to try on fish.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe except didn't add cumin (simply because I don't like it) and only used about 1/2 bunch of cilantro.  Easy and sooo good.  I had made to put on chicken, but ended up just eating as a dip with chips and salsa.  I think it would be great on chicken or fish.  I definitely recommend!

Quick and simple sauce to make that is loaded with flavor.  I first made this to serve with 'Southwestern Egg Rolls' from AR, but found it is good on other foods.  We have used it with tortilla chips, on top of a baked potato, and dip for pretzels and chips.  The next time I make it, I'm going to add a jalapeño for additional spice.  As written, this is a fantastic dip.  Along with the egg rolls, 'Tasty Spicy Rice Pilaf' from AR was on our menu and the dip was nice added to the rice.

Made recipe as described except I also added a Jalapeno pepper for a little extra hotness.  Served over grilled chicken breasts and it was the perfect compliment.  This does a a lot, so I am freezing the balance.

Great sauce for tacos and I slowly added the cilantro based on some other reviews.  The taste was a little tart? I substituted the sour cream for yogurt so maybe that did it or I did use a fresh lime and maybe it was extra tart.  Either way, I enjoyed the sauce but my fiancee did not.  He likes spicy and opted for the chiptole mayo sauce.  I didn't find this sauce spicy at all.

I love this recipe. I make it exactly as written. I use the entire bunch of cilantro from the store (I pull off any parts that look yucky). Yes, it's a lot of cilantro but I'm a cilantro lover :)
I can't eat guacamole (avocados don't agree with my stomach) so I use this instead for tacos, nachos, etc.
I've made it for parties and had good reviews as well.

Sauce was very good.  Next time I will cut recipe in half.  It made way too much for the recipe of Southwest Egg Rolls and I ended up throwing a lot of it out which was a shame because it was very good.

What a great sauce with some zing!  I love cilantro but took the advice of other reviewers and cut back to 1/2 a bunch thinking I could always add more if needed. Turned out to be the perfect amount.  I served this over a rockfish filet and husband and I really enjoyed the flavors.  It did make a lot so I'll have to try serving this as a dip tonight and see how it goes over.

The base of this recipe, a bunch of cilantro, any kind of salsa, a brick of cream cheese, and a little more garlic are all staples in our house because of this recipe! We tweak it with what we have and there has never been a bad bath! Thanks for sharing it!

I really love this sauce; it's tasty and very easy to make.  DH's only complaint was that it's a bit heavy, so it isn't really something to serve as an appetizer.  But it's perfect for a party or something where you just have dips and finger food, *or* as the main sauce in an entree.  I serve it with Southwestern Egg Rolls (and again, those are supposed to be an appetizer, but they're kind of heavy, so I use them as an entree with this sauce).

This stuff is awesome! We initially made it as a veggie dip for the Superbowl and had a bunch left over so we used it as a sub for mayo. Made sandwiches awesome. We also put it in tacos...topped it on meat. You get the idea. A lot of people I know who don't like cilantro absolutely loved it. As far as the recipe being vague on how much cilantro to put it in, it's kind of up to you, like most recipes. I started out with probably a handful or two and tasted it...I personally wanted more so I added a bunch more until it was satisfying to me. Delish!!

Made this completely as is and thought it was really good!  Had it two different ways in one day too.  At a BBQ in the afternoon, served it with whole grain tostito chips and later on used it as sauce for grilled chicken.  Both delicious!

I made this exactly as is except I left out the celery salt.   It was creamy and tangy and we really liked it.  I served with carne asada, but, I think it would also be really good with chicken or fish tacos.

Very tasty, both as an appetizer and as a sauce for tacos...and many other things, I imagine! Next time I'll toss a jalapeno in the blender too, for some added heat. :)

I made this recipe last night and it got rave reviews at my dinner party. 
Modifications: 
2 fresh fresh garlic cloves instead of dried garlic.  
7 oz of Trader Joe's green salsa (from a jar).
I used about 1 and 1/2 bushels of cilantro.  The flavor can get lost in all the cream cheese otherwise!

This is amazing!!! The only thing I did differently is use one fresh garlic clove. The tomatillo salsa I used gave it a kick...with cilantro it was fantastic. I made it with southwestern egg rolls.

Was skeptical about the amount of cilantro because I was using it as a dip so I used about 1/2 bunch.  It was a great hit with everyone.  Think it would have been fine with the whole bunch and will try that next time.

I'm not even a fan of cilantro, or mexican food, but I can not stop eating this stuff! My family demands I make it often because they love it as well. Not sure why everyone has such issues with how much a "bunch" is. EVERY store I have ever been to sells greens (collard greens, parsley, cilantro, etc) in a clearly defined and sectioned off BUNCHES. Doesn't get much easier? I always let my cheese and cream to come to room temperature before mixing to avoid lumpiness. Works great with lime chips & fresh veggies

This is such a versatile sauce! I even use it as the dressing for my taco salads and it is fabulous as a dip for bacon wrapped grilled shrimp. It has become a staple for summer time grilling.

I served this with chicken that had been sprinkled with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and then pan fried in a little butter.  I know I am not a fan of too much pepper, so I added only a half teaspoon of it and that worked well for me.  I also was not sure how much a bunch of cilantro was intended to be, so I used half of a regular bunch you would buy at the store which I felt turned out perfect.  This had some heat to it, but was not overly spicy for us.

I only used about 1/8 the bunch of cilantro (not a big fan) and used 3 cloves of garlic. I also added about 4 Tbs of sour cream because I was worried the texture would be too thick and taste too much like cream cheese. I didn't have celery salt so didn't use that. It was wonderful!!

Made it tonight for empanadas and it was awesome.  We didn't have celery salt so we just used salt and the tomatilla salsa was home made.  Man was this a good find, recommend 100%.

This was super good. I would have given it 5 stars, but it took a little doctoring up to make it that way. I thought it tasted a bit bland after just making the initial recipe. I added more garlic powder, some onion powder, paprika and sea salt. I made this lighter by using neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese and fat free sour cream. Everyone thought it was delicious. Was very good with the southwestern egg rolls from this site.

Wish I had read the reviews more carefully, because I went on a wild goose chase looking for tomatillo salsa when I could've just bought salsa verde! Anyway, once I figured that out, the preparation was easy and the result is great :) Can't wait to share with friends tonight! I thought the spiciness was just perfect for me, I am someone who likes spicy foods, but not to the point of feeling like my mouth's on fire.

This was the perfect amount of heat for my husband.  He really can't take things too hot, and this just left a nice tingle in the back of the throat.  I can stand things much more hot, but I keep things tame for him.  He loved this, and it will definitely be made again!    I served this with the "Lime Cilantro Rice" from this site, and a piece of grilled chicken.  It was an excellent meal.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very yummy sauce. I used half a can of green chile's and lemon juice instead of lime juice since I didn't have either of those and it was still wonderful.

Oh my goodness, the reviews are all true... This is AMAZING!!!  I made it with low fat cream cheese and non fat greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  I didn't have celery salt so I substituted garlic salt.  We served it over spanish rice, black beans, corn, tomatoes, and chicken, and it was a hit.  Even better the second day!  It's also delicious as a dip for tortilla chips.  I'll be making this again very soon!

This was a big hit. We served it with the Southwestern eggrolls from this site (also delicious) and everyone loved it! Followed the recipe exactly and it was super easy to make. Great for cilantro lovers!

Very tangy. Nice creamy flavor and the cilantro didn't taste soapy this way either. I don't really like cilantro much but I did like this sauce. This was a huge hit here. I let mine sit overnight before serving it for the flavors to develop. Mine was really thick so maybe it needed a little more sour cream? I had one bunch of cilantro minus a quarter cups worth of chopped I had to share with another recipe, so I used a tad less than called for. I used Herdez brand salsa verde that I had in my refrigerator. This was great and my family really liked it. Thanks!

This was fabulous!  My friend that was over for dinner ran out of stuff to put it on and just put a spoonful of it on her plate and ate it by itself!  lol!  I didn't use the tomatillo sauce, added a habannero pepper, and added some half & half to thin it out and make it more of a "sauce".  We served it over the grilled habannero salmon (minus the butter) from this site.  Fantastic!

This was quite good on our salmon patties, however, in my opinion, I'm not sure I'd use it for much else.

Amazing sauce!  Goes perfectly with Southwestern Egg Rolls from this site.  I used low fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream.  Didn't have celery salt, so just sprinkled a little salt (really don't need much salt).  This is divine!

I went to a Mexican bar & grill and ordered the Chicken Cilantro plate and I fell in love. I came on here to find something similar and I found something better!!! This makes a delish dip AND a sauce to dress your grilled chicken breast.... I'd give more starts if I could... THANK YOU SO MUCH!

I LOVE each ingredient in this recipe, but it was far too intense - mainly the garlic powder and lime. The gasses from it blew the lid right off of the tupperware container after a couple of days. Had to dispose.

Loved this - just enough kick!  The funny thing is I didn't have cilantro and served it without it, and didn't realize that until today.  So...not sure I'll use any cilantro next time or not!  :)

This is reeaaalllly good. I use it with the Southwestern Egg Roll recipe as another reviewer suggested. I have never used a full 7 oz. of tomatillo salsa...the kind I got was super hot as it was so I ended up just using 3 tablespoons, maybe 4. I also add a little minced garlic in place of part of the garlic powder. Just 'cause I love a stronger garlic taste.

This is AWESOME! I used a can of salsa verde and added cilantro until it was just right for us. This can be used so many different ways.. the possibilities are endless! Personally, I could have just eaten it with a spoon by itself! Yes. That good :D

every time I make this it is a huge hit. The only change I make is I use 4-5 fresh tomatilo's instead of the salsa and process it all until fine.  I serve it with chicken, steak and my kids love it with chicken nuggets! this version is less hot than the original = group friendly!

Considering the ingredients, I thought this would be better.  I'd much rather have guacamole and that's much easier to make.

Loved it! I used "Salsa De Tomatillo" to make this recipe. Before adding the cilantro, I tasted the dip. It was really good. After adding the cilantro, the dip was ok but not as good as without the cilantro. 4 stars with cilantro. 5 stars without the cilantro.

SOOO delicious with the Southwestern Egg Rolls and Fajitas!  I never knew what a bunch of cilantro could do!  i followed the recipe as is with the exception of the celery salt - didn't have any on hand so I used 3/4 tsp celery seed (dried) and 1/4 tsp salt.  Worked well with light cream cheese and i used mild La Victoria salsa verde (aka tomatillo salsa).  As one reviewer mentioned before, the spiciness of the salsa verde you choose to use will determine how spicy the cilantro cream sauce will be! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I was expecting big things from this recipe, and I think it's just alright.  I love cilantro, I just feel like it's missing something. Maybe it's because I used fat free cream cheese.  We're eating it over falafel's tonight!

Delicious and easy to make - whir it up in the food processor for a quick sauce/dip with no lumps.  I didn't have sour cream so skipped it without problems.  Used 3 cloves fresh garlic in place of garlic powder and skipped the celery salt.  Added a little extra fresh lime juice.  Fantastic with Southwestern eggrolls and I'm looking forward to utilizing it in other ways as well.

This was absolutely delicious. I tried it topped on simply seasoned chicken breasts and brown rice. It will be a staple during the summer months when I have tons of cilantro from the garden.

Very good and easy.  I made this sauce this morning to go with a veggie tray tonight and I want to eat it all right now and leave none for tonight, it's that good.  I did use 1/2 tsp. celery salt and 1/2 tsp salt and a dash of cayenne pepper.  Can't say enough good things about this.

Friends hated it on my first try, but LOVED it second time around using: Low Fat Cream cheese, 2 Tb sour cream, 1-7oz 'La Costena' green sauce in the hispanic isle, 1/2 ts fresh ground black pepper, pinch of salt, 1/4 ts ground cumin, 1 1/2 garlic powder, juice of half a lime, 1 1/2 C french cilantro  ->bunches in CA are huge! perhaps my mistake the first time. Thanks for Posting =-)

Pretty  good. The only thing I changed was instead of celery salt I used garlic salt because I didn't have that on hand. I would definitely make this for my next work function, I think everyone will really enjoy it. It's great for a dipping sauce. Thanks for sharing!

The recipe is too vague.  "A Bunch of cilantro" can mean different things.  I used about 2 cups of cilantro leafs and added 2 more Tbs. sour cream.  It was thick.  Flavor was good.

Way too much celery salt!  It overpowered the whole sauce.  I'm sure this could be modified to be good.

This recipe is delicious and versatile.  I've used it as a topping for enchiladas and as a veggie or chip dip.  I really don't care for cilantro very much and even I really enjoy it.

I can see how with tweaking its great, but made EXACTLY by the recipe it is SALTY! Also I love cilantro more than the regular person, but one whole bunch, way too much. I think if I make it again I would try to use celery seed instead of celery salt and less cilantro. It's just hard to handle right now. I'm going to try to add some more sour cream to this one so I don't just waste everything I bought specifically for this. But it does have potential!

I discovered this sauce two weeks ago and I have already made it three times.  I made the recipe as directed, Loved It!  I made the recipe with half a jalapeno added, Loved It!  I made the recipe with greek yogurt instead of sour cream, Loved It! I prefer to eat this sauce as a dip with Tostitos Hint of Lime chips and fresh salsa.  I little bit of sauce w/ a little bit of salsa on a lime chip - heaven!!   Thanks Amy!

This is a very rare recipe. It is perfect. It needs no additions or subsitutions. Amazing! I used this with mini quiches (from this site). Would work well with bread or chips or veggies for dipping.  Great drizzled over some cajun salmon. Or dunking just about anything in! Heck, I`d use it as a salad dressing or instead of mayo on a burger. Or, on baked potatoes or potato skins instead of sour cream. This stuff literally could be ate by the spoon.  Yes, this pregnant woman was doing just that. Amazing considering I can hardly stomach anything these days!! THANKS AMY FOR SHARING!

I don't think this needs another 5 star rating. But it's getting one!! Very creamy and flavorfull. I couldn't find tomatilla sauce so I used salsa verde sauce instead. I didn't add the celery salt because I didn't have any. Next time I'am going to add some 'heat' or spice to it. We used it on carnita tacos. But you can use this yummy sauce on many things. I will definietly make again. Family loved it.

Holy-heaven-in-a-bowl!  This stuff is *amazing*.  This is the type of dip that you go looking for something to dip in it, doesn't matter what as long as you get some!  LOL  I followed the recipe exactly and YUM is all I can say.  We served it with some quesadilla rolls and tortilla chips and it will definitely be made again.  I will say it makes a ton of dip and to say it serves only 4 servings is being VERY generous with portion size.  LOVE it!

Great sauce/dip! My husband and I love this. We eat it with white corn tortilla chips. So tasty. I find myself craving this stuff & will literally go out just to buy the ingredients to make it! A bunch of cilantro is the equivalent of what you buy in the grocery. it's usually rubberbanded and ready to go. I use the entire bunch, since we love cilantro. I will definitely make this for future parties!

Perfect for a spicier food. . . I used less cilantro than a bunch. That seemed like it may over power the other flavors of the dip.

I would classify this as a dip recipe rather than a sauce b/c the consistency was more dip like.  Excellent though. Served with tortilla chips and also as a dip for jalapeno poppers.

I made the recipe without any changes.  I wasn't sure how much cilantro to use, but I love a lot, so I used a whole large bunch, probably about a cup after chopped.  We had this on sauteed grouper, and it was delicious!  I'm sure I will use this over and over on lots of things!

I love this recipe, I took it to several Holiday parties and did not leave with out 2 or 3 people asking me for the recipe.  I have toned down the pepper a little.

Fantastic on tortilla chips and as a topping on tilapia or other white fish.  Hubby requests it frequently.  The last time I made it, I used my own tomatillo sauce.  Boil shucked tomatillos until they start to fall apart, food process with cilantro, jalapeno, salt, and onion.  So simple and adds a better flavor than bottled.

This stuff is great, I didn't change a thing. I served it with quesadillas, and when they were gone, I used the rest as a dip for tortilla chips. PERFECT!!

This is now our favorite dip.  My husband LOVES cilantro, so an entire (large) bunch went into this recipe.  We use it on everything from breakfast eggs and hashbrowns to chicken to sandwiches to wraps (really good with cucumbers!!)  Hands down one of the easiest and best.  It does make a lot more than 4 servings, but it goes fast!

Creamy, spicy, and sinful! I served this sauce with the "Southwestern Egg Rolls" recipe from this site - the recipes really compliment each other.  This recipe is thick like a dip rather than a sauce.  Next time I might thin out the recipe into a sauce and use it as a taco topping or salad dressing.

You have to try this recipe!  My only alteration was adding 2 roasted garlic cloves but it would be just fine without it. I also didn't have celery salt so I used a dash of regular salt. I found a 16 oz jar of Salsa Verde by Pace in the international section of my grocery store which has jalapenos in it so it added a nice kick (I used about 1/2 the jar)!  I served it with carrots, celery and pita wedges.  Everyone loved this dip and couldn't stop eating it.  I can't wait to make it again!

Excellent!!! Rather than using canned or jarred verde sauce, I use a Peruvian jalapeño dipping sauce recipe so everything is fresh, fresh and refreshing. Fantastic recipe Amy!

Excellent, fresh tasting and delicious. Rave reviews and many asked for recipe at picnic we went too. I added a bit too much lime juice and will cut down on that next time (added more than recipe called for). Can't wait to try on shrimp on grill!

this recipe is very similar to the peruvian cilantro sauce i had in a restaurant. it would have been much better if i didnt add quite as much cilantro. i would suggest adding a little at a time and continue to taste. tasted great on soft tacos. im going to make some peruvian fried rice and eat it with that, hopefully it will battle the boldness of the cilantro

This makes a really great dip for crackers and even veggies, but I rated it 4 stars for the vagueness of the recipe...I wasn't sure what a "bunch" of cilantro was so I just chopped up about a 1/4 cup, added it, and then just kept adding a little at a time til it was right for me.  Cilantro has a very strong flavor though so I didn't want to overdo it.  Also, I found tomatillo salsa as Green Salsa here (I used the hot stuff).  Its a very refreshing, distinc flavor though which was really nice.

Whenever I see a recipe on this site with so many positive reviews it usually turns out to be incredible.  This didnt disappoint my expectations!  WOW!  I used this to dip the Southwestern Egg Rolls, but it's gonna be delicious with raw veggies.  What a wonderful, fresh dipping sauce!

This is great.  I've used it on everything from fish tacos to carne asada.  Basically - if I'm cooking any kind of Mexican or Tex-Mex - I make this sauce to serve as a side.  It has become as much of a staple as salsa.

This dip was awesome.  It did make a large amount (good for a party)--next time for our family I will cut it in half.  I did not make any changes to the recipe, but, next time I may try using fresh garlic in place of the garlic powder.  Used as a topping for the Lime Chicken Soft Tacos.  Hubby went bonkers--he loved the combination!

Being a huge cilantro fan, I had to try this when I saw it (didn't need to, just wanted to see how it tasted). It's absolutely amazing! Made it again with the southwestern egg rolls recipe listed elsewhere on this site for guests while watching football last weekend and had to make a second batch. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Just as another reviewer said: It's good on everything!  I used about half of a bundle of cilantro, which gave it a mild cilantro taste.

This was very good as is, but my husband took the extra sauce and added some avocado and proclaimed it the best guacamole he has ever had - and that's high praise coming from a man born in Mexico!

I've made this many times and no matter where I take it , it's a hit! I use it as a dip with tortilla chips, over fish, with tacos and grilled meats. I will also thin it down with some white wine and use it as a salad dressing. The salad will usually consist of romaine, pepitas, tomatoes, corn and some crumbled tortilla chips.

This is sooo good!  My boyfriend ate it on everything he could put it on! I followed the directions, except I added a bit more lime juice and a little more cilantro to get that bright bright green and I refridgerated it overnight and the whole next day until dinner ( highly recommend this!)  it was tangy and spicy and yummy!!!  I served it originally with the southwestern eggroll recipe which was also yummy!  Thank you for this excellent recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I added 1.5 jalepenos to give it some bite.  I also did 1/2 the celery salt and 1/2 the pepper.  I used neufchatel cheese (1/3 fat cream cheese) and fat free sour cream to make it healthier.  Simple, tasty, and addictive.  Thanks!

This is such a great change to dress up any mexican dish. I made it as a dip for veggies for a football party and it was super. Now I cant wait to try it on burritos. Very unique flavor.

If you like cilantro this is great, we put it on crackers and hamburgers.  Very strong flavors, a good change from spinach dip.

The only reason that I made this sauce was to use up some cilantro and and some left over tomatillo salsa. This was really good, it made our burritos taste very fresh and it packed alot of flavor. I will make again.

I liked this, my husband loved it. I really like that it uses a whole bunch of cilantro--I often buy cilantro just to use a little bit in a recipe, then am wondering what to do with the rest of it. It seemed a little salty to me, especially as I ate it with salted tortilla chips. I cut back the celery salt to half a teaspoon the second time I made it, and that was better--may cut back even more next time. I can see this sauce being good with many things (tacos, meat, veggies, etc.) as other reviewers have suggested. As far as a dip for tortilla chips, it's good, but it doesn't beat guacamole!

This is amazing!  Loved it...Made it for a family cookout this past weekend--Everyone wanted the recipe..I will make this and use it again and again..Thanks for a wonderful unusual recipe!  For those who cannot find tomatillo salsa--it is the green version of salsa.  I went to a bunch of grocery stores and no one knew what I was talking about when I asked them where it was located.  I found it myself.

This is my favorite recipe from this site.  I originally made it with the Southwest Eggrolls (also from this site) and it was a hit at a family party.  I have used it on quesadillas and also just with chips; the combinations are endless.  I did try something new today to see if I could cut down on calories/fat and still get the same results.  I think I came close.  I used non-fat plain yogurt instead of the cream cheese and let it sit and drain for about an hour in a strainer with a paper towel.  Then I proceeded as normal with the recipe.  It's not nearly as thick, but the flavor tastes almost identical.  I think I will try this new variation on a taco salad as a dressing.

I am addicted to this stuff!  It is so flavorful.  I have a hard time stop eating it.  I did omit the celery salt and cut down the garlic but it is still loaded with flavor.  Of course I put in a lot of extra cilantro because I love it so much.

This was good stuff..  I took it to a party & I don't think anyone but my husband and I even ate it..  SO, while this is not for everyone - it is a good recipe!  The only change I made was adding about 1 c of sour cream so that it could be dippable...

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was great! We not only enjoyed it as a dip with chips, we also served it as a sauce with "Chicken and Garlic" from this site (except we used chicken breast tenders instead of chunking it up). My husband even stirred it into pasta to eat with his leftover chicken. We really enjoyed this refreshing spicy sauce.

I thought I would really like this as a dip but was dissapointed.  I did use it as a spread in a tortilla wrap with turkey, and  loved the taste.  I may try it again as suggested for fish.  For this reason I gave it a 4.

This was delicious. I took it to a Bible study as an accompaniment to the Southwestern Egg Rolls. People were putting it on everything. It made me think of what Emeril says, "You could put this on the bumper of your car and it would still taste good"!

My only complaint is that I thought there was too much garlic but I realize that's a personal taste and I'm a little sensitive to garlic so I went ahead with five stars. The cilantro was the perfect amount. I started out with half a bunch and it definitely was not enough for my cilantro-loving tastebuds. I just smeared some on a soft taco and it was excellent!

I must say this was pretty yummy.  I used it to make a southwest pasta dish for a family of 5.  I used whole  wheat penne + zucchini, squash, drained/rinsed black beans, corn, chopped red & yel bell pepper, and tomato.  For the sauce, I used low-fat everything plus a little milk to make it sauce-ier. Everyone got seconds!

I really don't think 5 stars are enough for this recipe, I honestly could have just eaten it with a spoon it was sooooo good!!!!  I couldn't get tomatillo salsa so I had to use Sofrito sauce instead and add a jalapeno for a little kick.  It was AWESOME!!  I used it on the southwestern eggrolls but it would be great as a salad dressing as well.  YUMMMMMMY!!

This is great and refreshing.  I only used 1/2 bunch of cilantro, and it was good.  Probably still good with the whole bunch.  I used it on top of a cheese burger with avacado slices on top of that and it was good.  I also used it spread on top of my pizza too.  I am sure it would be good on pork, and chicken too.  Yum!

5+++++ I can't get enough of this recipe!!  We had this last night on salmon, and couldn't stop thinking of everything it would be good on.  It made way too much for just 2 people, but we will be eating it until it's gone, I'm sure.  I had it today for lunch with  some leftover chicken breasts and it was fabulous.  Will be having it on hamburgers this weekend.  I followed the recipe exactly.

SOOO GOOD! My sister made this for our Christmas get together. We ate it with a vegetable tray and tortilla chips. I loved it on the vegetables and the chips too if I added pico de gallo on top.  I inhaled it.  I made my own now (used regular salt not celery salt)I love the lime and the cumin in it. I used Herdez brand, salsa verde-- which by the way is the same thing as tomatillo salsa.  The salsa was mild and I wanted more kick so I added some jalapeno. I think it would make a good salad dressing too for a mexican style salad.

Easy to make and wonderful. Used with southwestern eggrolls and served leftover sauce over enchiladas the next day. Wonderful both ways.

Made this last night and it was Fantastick. We had it with taquitos. Have alot left over and am trying to figure out what to do with it besides a dip. I did use fresh garlic. For those that can't find tomatillo salsa the mexican food aisle has Salsa Verde in a can. Same thing. I'm thinking this might be good with an avacado thrown in Thank you

This is delicious.  Even though I used just ordinary salsa, didn't have the tomatillo.  I forgot the garlic powder then felt something was lacking so I put some in...then later discovered it had called for it all along!
Delicious.

YUM!  I used half light and half fat free cream cheese and light sour cream to lighten it up a bit, and I use the canned tom. salsa with jalapenos to give it a kick, but this is good stuff!  I needed a dip recipe to impress the in-laws and this was it!  ;-)  I have since used it as a sauce on fish and as a sauce for white chicken enchiladas.  Both were excellent.

YUMMY!  I highly recommend using homamde tomatillo salsa.  These are great on tacos, chips, crackers and spread on flour tortillas when making roll ups.

I served this with bowtie pasta and poached chicken breasts. It was very good with both. I chilled the leftovers and used it the next day as a dip for nacho chips, and it was superb! I couldn't find tomatillo salsa either, so I just used regular salsa. If I ever find tomatillo salsa I will be sure to try the recipe that way. Edited to add: my husband found tomatillo salsa for me and this recipe is superb using that.

Best recipe in the world. I would give this 10 stars if I could.  My family loves cilantro.  I made a couple of substitutes because I didn't have the salsa and celery salt on hand. I used the Pace Cilantro salsa and seasoning salt instead. For a Christmas party I made the Antojitos minis -submitted by Sara(just left out the salsa- mixed together veggies, topped with cheese and baked them then added cilatro sauce just before serving. They were a huge hit. You could use this sauce on anything. It would be great on tacos, fajitas, salmon. . . . I even used the leftovers to dip tositos in.  A must try!

This was awesome.  Couldn't find tomatilla so I used Mrs. Refinos green salsa. It is very spicy but when you eat it with whatever, chicken, cut up veggies, it cools it down.   The hubby flipped over it, as did I.   Yowza.  Thanks for the recipe Amy.

This is a superb tasting recipe although I made it with grouper and did not care for the combination at all.  In my opinion, it is better suited as a dip & will be excellent with chips, fajitas, burritos, southwestern egg rolls, etc. 
I loved the spiciness & will definitely make this again…  just not as a ‘sauce’ for fish, or chicken.

At first I loved this sauce,  but I think I put a little too much lime in it and a little too much on my chicken.  My husband did not like it at all.  Next time I will use less lime.  I think this would make a great salad dressing.

I eat this by the spoonfuls it is so good!  It thickens up after put in the fridge.  The flavor is the best and a bit spicy too!  I serve it with everything:  cheese crisps, fish tacos, celery, chicken breasts, etc.  It is a breeze to make and a definate keeper!  I hate to run out of it!

This really is addictive.  I did use only 4oz. of tomatillo salsa as my husband hates spicy things, and it was still delish.  I also used 1/2 bunch of cilantro (the ones I get are large) and removed all the bitter stems.

This was good.  I followed directions exactly except for adding about 1/4 cup of extra hot tomatillo sauce for more quick.  I served this with chips but it is too runny I think to use as a dip.  Next time I will use as a sauce for fish such as tilapia.

This sauce was OUTSTANDING! I really loved it! We did make some changes, substituting a homemade red salsa (using plum tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, and jalapeno) instead of the green salsa since I tried to make some green salsa but made a critical error.  It was wonderful though, we are definitely going to make this again! (using the red salsa from now on since it was so yummy!)

Delish!!  I have had the recipe for quite a long time and finally made it.  It is great!  I had to not use all the cilantro because one of my guests didnt like cilantro (can you believe that?).  Next time I will use a bunch.  I am using this with carne asada tacos that are pretty spicy so this is a perfect combination.  It is a pretty mild taste so with something spicy it is great!

OMG so awesome on our shrimp street tacos!  Can’t wait to try it in the talapia tacos next.  And dipping a piece of cold grilled chicken breast for a snack in this sauce was a yummy moment too!  I took the reviews to heart and used 1/2 a bunch of cilantro and that was plenty.   Definitely a repeat performance will be happening in my kitchen!

I made this sauce to add on Tilapia. It was delicious. My family wanted more of it.  I don't really like spicy taste so I left out the tomatillo and it was incredible still.

My family loved it.  I did substitute fresh roasted tomatillos for the tomatillo salsa, and I added a quarter cup of sour cream. The consistency was perfect spooned over chicken and white rice. I will definitely make again.

I just made this for a coworker/friend’s promotion, and OMG it’s good! Followed the directions exactly, but didn’t have a lime so used a splash of 7up and a squirt of lime juice. For the quickness, and simplicity it’s 10 star worthy. I’ll be serving this with some chips and store bought taquitos at work. I used a can of medium spicy green salsa and the spice is perfect! Use a handull of cilantro sprigs, and not the whole store-bought and you can’t go wrong!

Served this as a dip and it was a great success, everyone loved it. Guests said it had a fresh taste. Made as directed.  I did take suggestions from two other reviews and used 1/2 cup of cilantro slightly packed and served it with lime tostitos.  Really, really good!
This is a definite keeper Thanks Amy

This is my new favorite dip I will make at every get together.  I will put it on everything until I don’t have anything to dip and then  will just eat it straight out of the bowl!   I doubled the recipe really , except the cilantro...I felt one bunch was enough but that is just me.   I also threw in a couple of avocados along with a pinch of jalapeño salt and it was yummy delicious.  I made it for my bunco group and half the people used it as a salad dressing and half the people used it to sauce their chicken.   Everyone loved it!   Thank you Amy!.

We enjoyed this sauce. We used it on spicy chicken tacos. I followed the recipe exactly. (Technically I did use low fat cream cheese) I felt it was just a smidge too salty. When I make it again, i will cut back to 1/2 tsp of celery salt. I can imagine using this as a base for a creamy cilantro salad dressing as well.

This is good -  creamy and delish.  Followed the recipe to a T and it was easy and quick.  Guests loved it,  served right from the fridge as a topping for arepas with cheese,  chicken and avocado.  Perfect as a dip for tortilla.  Thinking about using as a drizzle on avocado and tomato salad. Endless possibilities! Thanks for a great recipe!

This goes great with a taco filling. I did have to add a little extra sour cream to get the sauce loose enough to work in the blender. I also used salsa verde like some other reviewers. Next time I will use my food processor and maybe add a few peppers.

This is a great recipe. I used Herdez mild salsa verde. I also added some fresh jalapeño, just because I had some leftover from the cilantro lime chicken I was making for dinner. This sauce was a great accompaniment  to  the chicken.

Absolutely delicious. I used about 1 cup of cilantro and a little extra sour cream.

I used a butt ton of cilantro -- just the cut the whole top of a large bunch...it was probably a cup and a half loosely chopped before I put it into the food processor. This is the best thing ever if you love cilantro.

So simple, but sooo delicious!  I made this to go over fish tacos.  Perfection.  My husband almost made a meal off of taco chips and this sauce.  Next I'll try it with taco chips, boiled shrimp, and a vegetable platter for a nice summer dinner.

You can put this on dog poop and it will taste like heaven!  Used this to pour over grilled Cod.  Big hit with all ages, so much that after dinner was down, someone grabbed a bag of Doritos and started using this as a dip.

Our Nepali daughter often made a sauce like this to accompany a rice and curry dish.  She simply used a little mayonnaise and milk instead of cream cheese.  It was runny, but very tasty and not so rich

I love it! The only change I made (didn't have all the ingredients at home) was instead of cream cheese I add ricotta cheese. It was delicious.

Omg this is amazing!!! Instead of tomatillo sauce I used Serrano peppers and added two. I also added about an ounce or two of water to my blender because the cream cheese is too thick to blend. I suggest to put the water in first so it sit on the bottom of the blender so it's easier to blend. I ate it on our fish tacos and substituted tortilla with lettuce! This cilantro cream salsa is a must try!

Great and different dip! I always add the entire bunch of cilantro and never add the sour cream unless I already have some. I don't like buying a whole container of sour cream to only use 1 tbls!

Had this at a friend's house and immediately needed the recipe.  Made it today and everyone (me and four little kids) loves it!  Awesome recipe, only change I made was a little heavier on the sour cream, like 3-4 Tbsp, for a thinner creaminess.  Love!

Very nice. Served with "Beef and Bean Chimichangas" from this site - excellent together! We dipped a few tortilla chips while waiting for the rest of our meal to bake - enjoyed it as a dip although I might caution to start with 1/2 tsp celery salt and adjust up to personal taste, especially if serving as a dip with something salty like chips. I like my food very well seasoned, but 1 tsp celery salt was borderline too much salt even for me. It was perfect to drizzle over the baked chimis and the lettuce/tomato/onion I served with them though! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was great! Used it with Southwestern egg rolls as a dipping sauce, and on the Texas hamburger as a spread. My only thought: the cilantro seemed a bit gritty. I suppose that could be my fault, as I'm still learning. Other than that, this was freak'n awesome.

This is so versatile!  I made this for a grilled pork loin and we ended up using if for the pork loin and all the grilled veggies too.  I only used 1/2 c. cilantro, I have no idea how you could use a whole bunch of cilantro.  I feel that would be very overwhelming.  I tasted the sauce before the cilantro went in and it would be good with out it, if you didn't like cilantro.  I also used 1/2 tsp. celery seed and 1 tsp. salt in place of celery salt, since that's what I had.  The cilantro flavor was much stronger the next day, almost too strong for my liking, so I would use it same day or add less cilantro if making it for next day.  You could really use this for anything, veggie dip, bread dip, sandwich spread, sauce for meat or chips.  It's really that good.  Everyone at my dinner LOVED it!

Wow!  Big hit with the whole family.  I only had 1/2 tablespoon of salsa so that's what I used.  I also doubled the cilantro.    I heated it up and put it over cooked potatoes and green beans and it was incredible!  I'm going to use this at holidays!

My new favorite sauce!  I made this for a party and followed the recipe with 2 exceptions.
I added a serrano pepper and used fresh garlic and it was fantastic!  Everyone loved it and I loved the leftover sauce on my leftover chicken.

This is really good, just be sure to add the cilantro a little at a time. Too much cilantro makes it inedible.

This stuff is AMAZING!  I have been dying to try this recipe for a while based on reviews and I am so glad I finally made it.  At first I thought 1tsp of pepper was too much, so I initially made it with half the pepper.  I tasted it and realized you need the full amount of pepper to balance out the celery salt.  This is one of the few recipes on this website where I reccomend you change nothing!  It is perfect as is.  I served this as a dip with homemade salsa and tortilla chips; but, it would also be a good veggie dip and I think it would be awesome on chicken, steak or fish.  It would be a great addition to a burrito or taco.

I did not add as much tomatillo salsa, just added until the right amount of hot, otherwise very good. I have been looking for a white mexican sauce that is close to a Poblano white sauce that I get at a favorite mexican restaurant on fish tacos.

I cut up 4 chicken breasts into cubes and browned them in a skillet. Once cooked through, I poured the sauce over and brought it just to a warm temp. Served it in soft flour tortillas. It's a bit peppery, I might back off on that a bit (but not much). I used 3 cloves of fresh garlic instead of powder, but that was the only change I made. So good!

awesome and easy! I used a 1/2 cup of cilantro instead would have been too overpowering for me to use a whole bunch. Will be making this again.

Per other reviewers, paired this with "Southwestern Egg Rolls" and sauce came out great. (Also worked well as dip for tortilla chips.) Used about 1/2 bunch of cilantro. Can't wait to pair this with chicken, burgers etc. Thanks to OP and other reviewers for sharing:)

I modified this recipe quite a bit, but I like the way it came out.  I used a cup of Greek yogurt instead of the cream cheese and I omitted the salsa.  I cut the amount of the dry spices in half, used the whole bunch of cilantro as recommended, and also used the juice of one whole lime.  My whole family enjoyed it and it was just so easy!!  Thanks.

Terrific with grilled shrimp and as a dip.  I used a mild salsa verde and it was the perfect Summer dip for the grilled shrimp. Fresh and light tasting.  Can't wait to try it on grouper.  Thank you for sharing.

First let me say that I'm not a big fan of cilantro but I made this because my husband does like cilantro. I was amazed at how much I liked it. I halved the recipe since there was just the two of us.  The store didn't have any fresh cilantro so I bought the stuff in the tube which I think is fresh chopped and packed in olive oil. I squirted in what looked like about a big tablespoon. I also used green chili salsa for the kick. It was Delish.

This is great! I made it exactly according to the recipe and tasted it - the flavors were great but I wanted it spicier so I added a chile pepper. So far I've eaten it with tortilla chips and on grilled chicken - tomorrow turkey burgers! Definitely a new fave!

This sauce is fantastic and a cinch to whip up. It has a delicious, cool refreshing taste, and I love that it doesn't have mayo as an ingredient, as so many sauces do! I really like cilantro so I used a full packed cup of the chopped cilantro and didn't find it too much at all. I served it with Southwestern Eggrolls, from this site, but it would be delicious on so many things. Will make often!

Great recipe.  I get rave reviews whenever I make it and bring it to a gathering.  It definitely depends on what salsa verde  brand you buy. Some are quite mild and some are spicy!  It will completely change the flavor of the dip.

I love cilantro and the cream cheese mixed with salsa verde is a delicious combo. I make to compliment mexican dishes, as well as a dip for raw vegetables. It's always a crowd pleaser.

Good stuff!  I added 1/2 a jalapeno and 2tsp of jarred garlic, personal taste preference.  Thanks for the great mix!  We used this with carrots and then on fish tacos.

Made for Christmas to go with kabobs.  I enjoy the Southwest flavor but think it would have been better as a dip for quesadillas or perhaps fajita/taco topping.

Used it for fish tacos, it was okay but too cilantro-y for our tastes. Next time we'll cut the cilantro by 1/3.

I sure this is just as awesome as written but I cannot have cream cheese so I change a few things.  I use tofutti sour cream (6oz), 2 tablespoons tofutti cream cheese, and a whole jar tomatillo salsa.  If I have fresh ginger I throw that in. I actually never measure any ingredigents but it's always yummy! We eat this on everything and is a must have with my homemade wontons.  The sauce is always a hit! Love this recipe! Thanks!!!

It turned out all right, but after reading other reviews I guess I was expecting something more amazing. I brought it to an office party and used the lime tortilla chips as dippers, and I think it was just too much lime. Not the best to make if people aren't a fan of sour cream as well. I felt like the quantities were unbalanced, maybe more tomatillo?

I used this recipe with Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style by S. Rogers. I have been looking for a recipe for cilantro salsa. This recipe was an excellent dipping sauce for the moist baked chicken I made. Thank you Amy for the recipe. I made the recipe as instructed and this recipe is a keeper.

Absolutely delicious!!!  Prepared this as a dipping sauce for blackened seared ahi tuna, and used it the next night as topping for grilled steak fajitas at a party.  Everybody loved it.  Also was great with chips.  My only addition to recipe was a tablespoon of fresh minced garlic (I like alot of garlic)...yum!

This was just average for us.  I'm not sure why, though.  I usually love cilantro, but this just didn't quite get it for me.  I used fat free cream cheese though, so maybe that had something to do with it.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was absolutely delicious. I used whipped cream cheese because I wanted to make this as soon as I picked up the ingredients. It's great with chips and I can't wait to try it on chicken and fish.  Thank you so much!

Yum. My suggestion would be to use a blender and add just 6oz of cream cheese and half the celery salt.  Blend it, refrigerate it and taste it again later to see if it needs the added cream cheese and celery salt. If so, you can just pop it back on the blender.  I thought it was too salty as written, especially served with salted tortilla chips.  Next time, I'll cut back on cream cheese and add a bit more sour cream.

Makes a lot, so be sure to use within a couple days, otherwise the fridge will smell like the sauce. Great on fish tacos, chicken verde enchiladas, and grilled quesadillas.

I was not able to to find my food processor so decided to make this on the skillet. I warmed 4 oz of cream cheese in 1 tbsp of olive oil, then added the rest of the ingredients. I used fresh minced garlic and left out the celery salt because I do not like my food overly salty. It came out as a wonderful creamy sauce that I used on top of fish fillets. I used 1/2 cup of cilantro, seemed like the right amount.

Hi everyone! I've had this recipe in my recipe box for quite some time and just FINALLY got around to making it today (hehe!)!!! Wow! I wish I hadn't waited so long (darn)!!!!! I made this to accompany Quick and Easy Fish Tacos (Chris). I halved this for my fiance and I, but only had a 3 oz. package of cream cheese available (I don't think Philly sells 4 oz. ones), and all was fine... (who misses 1 oz. worth anyways??!!??!!?).  And, for those of you wondering about tomatillo salsa, yes, it is the SAME as green sauce or salsa verde (La Preferedia Mexican brand sells it by both names, in case you are wondering...). Of course, you can just buy a large jar of salsa verde and use half for this recipe (the bonus is that you have leftovers for chips and salsa later on!). I also wanted to comment that I used half of a bunch of cilantro (i.e. half of the bunch I bought from the produce section). I made this sauce an hour or so before dinner, and, to my surprise, it thickened niceley (to a "creamy" dip-like consistency) and got SPICY, probably b/c I used HOT salsa!!!  Oh, and I used my mini food chopper (I've been in a trance all evening - I didn't even think about using my blender!!!), and pulsed until smooth with excellent results. Thanks for sharing AMYKINS! I can see why your hubby likes this so much. :-) I can't wait to try this with Southwest egg rolls (also in my recipe box, just begging for this dip!)!

Very tasty! I used fat free cream cheese, so it was fairly healthy. I used it as a dressing on a salad with chicken and with southwest egg rolls.

Very good dip. Went great with the Southwestern chicken egg rolls I made. I'm not sure if "a bunch" of cilantro is universal, but I agree with another review that 1/2 cup of cilantro was ample. Just enough to taste it but not over powering. I can't wait to try other things in this dip!

If you are a fan of cilantro, as I am, you should love this. It is such a versatile recipe. I've incorporated this into so many different recipes. I love to mix the sauce into pkg. coleslaw mix and serve it on top of fish tacos.

I followed this exactly and I found it to be way too salty and overbearing. MAybe I had bad spices. I don't know b/c nobody else mentioned having this problem. I added another 4 o of cream cheese and it's still too overbearing. I'm going to buy sour cream and once I add more I'm hoping it'll mellow out b/c it seems like such a great recipe. Next time I'll half the spices

Very nice to have something different! I did make a few changes because the dip seemed very thick and the cilantro was too strong for my taste. I added a small tub of sour cream and 1 packet of Hidden Valley fiesta seasoning. OMG WOW!!!!! Still has the cilantro taste, but just masked a little. Made with southwest egg rolls. YUM YUM. Thanks for the recipe!

Love it, love it, love it! I couldn't stop eating it as a dip with lime flavor tortilla chips.  On chicken breasts it's unbelievable!  You have to really like cilantro to enjoy this recipe.

I absolutely love this sauce. I serve it every time I make fish instead of tartar sauce. If you like it spicy, try adding 2 tablespoons of diced pickled jalepeno.

Awesome. After reading reviews I cut down on the cilantro. I did not have the tomatillo salsa so used regular.

Why why did I wait so long to make this? It's been in my recipe box forever and I finally took the plunge. I served this over grileld chicken breasts and it was divine! I used fat free ingredients and with all the seasonings, you cannot tell. YUM!

This dip is sooo good. Just made it about 5 minutes ago to go with our mexican inspired dinner tomarrow. I did change a few things based on what I had. I used about 9 stems of cilantro & could barely taste it, I used onion powder instead of celery salt, I used cumin seeds instead of powder, & lemon juice instead of lime. Over all I really liked it & will be making it again!!

Very good recipe. I used 3/4 cup cilantro and my own homemade tomatillo salsa. We used it as a dip and it was wonderful.

Great dip and very easy to make.  I wasn't sure how much cilantro to add so I just grabbed a handful.  I'll probably use the entire bunch next time.  You can make it a day or two ahead of time if you are serving for a party.  I paired with Southwestern egg rolls as others had suggested and it was a great combo.

I made this as a dip for fried onion rings. When we finished those, my guests started dipping vegetables and bread in it. They all LOVED it and everyone was asking "What IS this?!"   It will be my go-to dip whenever I need one, as it seems to go great with everything. A super success!

I didn't have the tomatilla salsa so substituted an equal amount of green chili enchilada sauce. It was a bit bland, so I added a roasted jalapeno to the mixture in the processor. That made it spicy enough for us and delicious on tacos and as a dip.

Awesome recipe.  I double the sour cream.  We have tried this with light and fat free cream cheese.  Light works better it makes the sauce less spicy.  I am sure that regular cream cheese would also work great!  My husband and I put this sauce over chicken, we have put it on tacos, and even use it for dip with tortilla chips.  I brought some over as dip to a friend's BBQ and everyone loved it!!  This is a great way to use our cilantro from our garden!

This is the best use for mega producing summer cilantro plants. I love it, love it, love it. Only suggestion is to add half the tomatillo salsa to see if the thickness works, then add more if you want it less thick.

Made this for the first time for a St. Paddys day party.  I had been searching for something green.  EVERYONE at the party wanted the recipe.  Made it again for 4th of July and once again everyone in the room was coming up to and asking for the recipe!  Big hit, thank you for this yummy recipe.

This sauce is absolutely fabulous!  I added 1/4 tsp. jalapeno powder for a little extra zip. It's best on bagel or pita chips!  But it's also great on red chile tortilla chips; not to mention fresh vegies.  I brought it to a Mother's Day party and everyone raved about it.  Thanks so much.

This sauce is amazing! I coated chicken with seasoned flour and cooked it in a pan and dipped it in the sauce and it was DELICIOUS! Can't wait to try the left overs with salmon for dinner!

When i made this....on Day 1 i used this as a sauce on my carne asada. The flavors are awesome! (It had the consistency of a thick dressing.) On Day 2 after being in the fridge all night...it was a wonderful chip dip. I loved it both ways.

Very good. Reminds me of one of my favorite restaurant salsas. My family and I used to go to one Mexican restaurant for that salsa, and I was so excited to find out that this tastes just like it. I cannot wait to share it with them since the restaurant recently closed.

Husband loved. But I thought it was heavy on the cumin. I served it over cod fillets with sliced red bells and lemon slices. A little goes a long way!

Absolutely delicious. Made it just as recipe called for and used it as a dip with tortilla chips. I got raves. If you like cilantro and a tangy taste, you'll love this. I will make it for grilled chicken next. Loved it!

I want to rename this to Dee's cilantro cream sauce because I'm certain I've eaten more of it than Amy!  Its so excellent and great to take to a party, great on tacos or fajitas and even with crackers!  I am not sure if you are supposed to use a bunch of cilantro from the store with or without the stems?  I tried both ways, both tasted great.

Fantastic! I could not keep my two college kids away from it, they used it as a dip. Now they want to learn how to cook! The next day I also put it on cooked chicken breasts, yummy.

This was very good!!  I didn't have tomatillo sauce, but I did have tomatillos.. I cut them up, microwaved them to soften them and threw them in.  I did as others suggested, cut the celery salt in half, cut the cumin in half.  I doubled the sour cream.  The office at the pot luck raved!  I served it on plain chicken breast.  The manager took the rest home to put on her fish dinner!  Thx!!

I found that the celery salt overpowered the other flavors. Next time I will cut the celery salt in half. Other than that, it was great. Not too spicy, but definitely not bland

This cream sauce is wonderful, but the recipe could be improved if a more specific quantity was given for the amount of cilantro to use. I used 3/4 of a big bunch - probably 1 1/2 cups loosely packed - and it might have been too much. Still delicious though!

I loved this sauce, had to use salsa verde instead of the tomatillo salsa because we couldn't find it at our grocery store but it was really good either way. Has a bit of a kick to it, but obviously wasn't too bad because I kept digging in for more. Drizzled this over pork tacos as well as used to dip our tortilla chips.

This is delicious!  I've also made it substituting what I had on hand - regular salsa (drained) and lemon juice instead of lime.  Still really good!

This sauce was awesome!  We used it when we made the Southwest Egg Rolls from this site.  I added in a few drops of tabasco.  I used about 1/3 a cup of cilantro leaves & then chopped them up - I wasn't sure how much a "bunch" was supposed to be.  It even tasted great just dipping into it with tortilla chips! Great recipe!!

My husband considers food a means to an end; he enjoys what I make, but almost never requests anything.  After he tried this cilantro cream sauce, he couldn't stop thinking about it!  He begged me to make it again.

I wasn't overly impressed. I love cilantro, but this just didn't really have the flavor of cilantro I was looking for. I may try it again and try to doctor it some more.

I made this with one large bunch of cilantro, and fresh tomatillos. I also threw in a couple of small jalapenos for some kick. The flavor is great but it is a little too thin/runny. I'm going to add another half block of cream cheese tomorrow. Thanks!

Whirrled the whole thing up in the food processor in a snap. I used fat free cream cheese (even though I don't like the stuff) and the flavor was still amazing. I didn't have celrey salt, so I threw a few leaves of celrey into the food processor with the cilantro. also I accidently left out the sour cream, but didn't miss it. I've made two batches in a week!

This is a good tasting, inexpensive, simple recipe. It has a fresh, less ordinary taste than some other common dips. Because my mother can't stand anything spicier than a saltine cracker, I left out the tomatillo salsa.  I also subbed lemon juice for the lime juice and left out the sour cream because I didn't have any.  I did add a little more water and lemon juice to make it easier for the blender to blend.  We ate it on tortilla chips but liked it best on bagel chips.

This was very tasty. Nice dip or salad dressing.  I didn't have enough cream cheese, so actually I more or less reversed the amounts of cream cheese and sour cream.  It was really good that way, and next time I'll try it as written. Thanks.

Good stuff- I halved the recipe and left out the celery salt.  The salsa verde I used was not at all spicy, so I threw in 1/4 of a large jalapeno to give it some kick.  Overall, it has a pretty strong cream cheese flavor which went very well with chips but not so well with my fish tacos.  Next time I'm going to do 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 sour cream with the tacos.

Awesome dip. Made it as-is. Has a little kick to it, super easy to make in my blender. I have no idea how to use it on fish; it wasn't impressive when I tried it on tilapia, but someone with more knowledge could probably do great things with it.

Everyone raved about this one - I used regular salsa since I did not have the tomatilla salsa.    Some nice uses for this sauce - as a dip, on turkey and brie sandwhiches, in a breakfast burrito, add a small amount with chopped avocados for a yummy tasting gaucamole

Wonderful!  Became an instant family favorite.  I followed the recipe exactly in order to rate it fairly.  I will leave it as is for a sauce but may add an additional cream cheese for a thicker dip.  We used it for a sauce on tacos and as a dip for our chips.

I made this dip for the superbowl party. My husband was not a huge fan, but it was a huge hit at the party. My neighbor, who I left the dip with when we left said she was eating it with a spoon! I did not have celery salt, so I left that out. I will definitely make this dip againe!

Wow, is this good or what!!! It is truly addictive and so refreshing. I made my husband very happy with this one as he is a big big fan of cilantro. What a wonderful blend of spices. Just perfect. Wouldn't change a thing. Used it with tortilla chips and as a sauce for our fish. I am sure there are a million other uses. Can't wait to show it off when summer comes for that BBQ. Thanks so much.

One of the best dips I've had- I would have happily licked the spoon and bowl clean, given the chance.

I love this recipe. I use it as a dip with tortilla chips. I also add about 1/8 cup of canned jalapenos chopped to add a little kick.

This recipe is delicious.  Even if you aren't a huge cilantro fan you will want to put this sauce on everything.  I have used it on sandwiches, burritos, steak and grilled salmon and it made them all taste better.

I think i put in too much cilantro (whole bundle) and had a bit of an oniony taste, but still was outstanding on the egg rolls...Next time i will cut the cilantro back to half a cup or something.  Also, putting this in the fridge so it hardens up a little bit also really helps make it better.

I love cilantro so I thought this would be the perfect recipe.  Somehow the flavors are too strong for me.  I'll continue to play with it to get just the right amount of each seasoning.

YUM!!  I too served this with the Southwest Egg Rolls and it was a perfect match.  There was a lot leftover though-I dipped everything I could find into it!  Chips, veggies, tortillas, etc.  The only slight complaint is that it was a bit too salty but that is easily rectified by cutting back on the salt next time.  Wonderful!

It was pretty good.  I thought it would be more like the sauce at a local resturant (Los Cucos) but it wasn't.  Next time I make it, I will use less lime juice, because it was overpowering to me.

This dipping sauce is wonderful! I have tried it several ways- with regular tomatillo salsa, with my favorite brand of tomato salsa, and with a Tequila Lime tomatillo salsa- all with great results! We make it primarily to go with the Southwestern Egg Rolls, and it's delicious!

Mmmm very yummy.  I too used these with the Southwestern egg rolls from this site.  It went perfectly together with the spicy of the egg rolls this cooled everything off.  I didn't have sour cream so I used mayonnaise and I forgot to put the lime juice in, still very yummy!

I had all the ingredients available, so I decided to try this dish.  It was soooo good!  It reminded me of the green sauces that I would get at Mexican restaurants in the area.  I also added serrano peppers and used a pretty spicy tomatillo sauce, and that gave the dip a great kick.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best sauce!!!! I love it. I would give it 10 stars if I could. I can't wait for my husband to get home and try it.  I had to omit the celery salt because I didn't have any but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It will be my new favorite thing to make.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Great recipe and VERY easy to make (use the food processor, NOT the blender!). I made this for a party and served with pita bread. I could only find Medium Salsa Verde, so the dip was a little too spicy for my personal taste but everyone else loved it! I used a little over half a cup of cilantro and didn't find it overpowering at all, as other reviewers had.  Will definitely make again!

This was a nice addition to my recipe box. As long as you like cilantro and a bit of heat this is a nice topper for a variety of meats or to use in wraps. I added a half can of the salsa then tasted it and gradually added more. I ended up using most of the 7 oz can but didn't want to make it too hot for guests.

This is a great dip or sauce for just about anything. I also make a similar sauce/dip subbing pickled jalapenos and using a packet of Ranch dressing mix for the seasonings. Use one whole bunch of cilantro even though it seems like a lot.

Makes great sour cream chicken enchiladas too!  Use half the cream cheese and 16 oz. of sour cream and pour over enchiladas.  You can also use a small can of diced green chiles to keep the spice level down.  I have given this enchilada sauce recipe to others to try and they all love it!

I've made this dip (I've never used it as a sauce) several times because everyone really loves it. There's nothing quite like it. The only change I make is the addition of cayenne.

Easy & delicious as written. I halved the recipe (plenty as a dip for a double batch of Southwestern Egg Rolls) - still have some left for something else. I used my Magic Bullet to whip it up (thought that it may go to the appliance graveyard, but it turns out to be fun)!

Amazing hit - made this for a dinner party and served it with beef fajitas. Wow! Not only did everyone have seconds, but the next day people were stealing the leftovers out of my fridge to top on whatever they could find: chips, sandwiches, other main dishes for extra flavor. This is a must try recipe. I've been cooking for a month...not lying...and it was extremely easy and even my non-spicy-loving boyfriend liked the kick it has. I wouldn't change a thing!

When I first made this the lime was too overwhelming, I couldn'taste anything else.  After it set for a few hours the flavor melded together and it was wonderful.  Thank you!

This sauce is amazing!! I found this recipe a while back and use it on chicken, fish and it is excellent to top off Mexican style soups. Give it a try, you won't be sorry.

Scrumptuous flavor, great presentation, and not much work. I left out celery salt because I didn't have any, and substituted about 3 tsp of cilantro-in-a-tube rather than the fresh variety (the store was out), and it was still awesome. I took others' advice and paired this with Southwestern Egg Rolls. Yum!

We doubled this and took it to a holiday party with Southwestern Egg Rolls from this site and it was delicious.  It was a pretty thick dip.  I recommend leaving it in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving to "blend" the ingredients more.

i don't like cilantro so this sauce wasn't appealing to me but my fiance would eat this stuff off the stem. he said it was amazing. so if you don't really like cilantro and you think this dip wont be that bad i wouldn't recommend this.

It tastes good, but it is odd as a dip it seems like it would be better as an enchilada sauce or something...and I definitely agree with the others that add jalapeno to give this dip more of a bite!

I followed the recipe exactly, but I didn't find this to be the incredible dip that others did. It was good, but not great. So only giving it 4 stars.

Men seem to love this. I made it as a dip to take as a side dish to a chili cook-off. The men raved about it over and over. I've never seen grown men get so interested in a recipe. Great dish for parties.

Very good. I used it as a dip for my grilled chicken breast.  I might try a little bit of chopped jalapeno pepper next time. I'm glad I didn't spread it over my chicken breast, I thought a little went a long way.  Will use this recipe again. :)

Love it. I followed the recipe exactly and I could eat this all day. I tried it with chips and then had the genius idea to make it the sauce for my enchiladas....well, it tasted good, but it certainly didn't look appetizing, I probably won't do that again. But that was just an experiment. This recipe is a keeper!

I double this recipe just so I'll have leftovers for dipping later in the week. So, so good. I use it on the southwestern egg rolls from this site (as others suggested) and it's a hit with company every time. People think I've whipped up a gourmet Mexican dinner when it's all so easy. I've made it several times and I'm not sick of it yet.

This is a great sauce!  I only made half a batch not expecting my picky family to like it.  They all loved it, even my 9 year old.  Thanks, Amy!  I made it to go with the Southwest Style Egg Rolls on this site, but I can't wait to try it on other things.

Absolutely fabulous!  You will all think I'm nuts, but I subbed 8 oz. of soft tofu for the cream cheese (but added a tablespoon or so of cream cheese for flavor) and it was still amazing.  My modified version renders this extraordinarily healthy (all that protein with so little fat!) and even though I like tofu, I hate the tofu-y taste of recipes like this where the tofu shines through.  Amazingly, this had no tofu taste at all - just great, great flavor.  Give it a go!

I tripled the recipe for a catered dinner for 35-served with cilantro-lime shrimp (dif site).  Guests loved it with the shrimp.  Really unique taste--heat from the salsa & garlic, cool from the cream cheese & cilantro.  Different than most traditional cream cheese dips served.

This is great! Yummy, garlicy, I used this to top homemade mexican pizzas and it was perfect.  I also added a seeded and chopped jalepeno. Next time I will try substituting 2 cloves of garlic for the powder.

I finnally made this sauce, for tortilla rollups and mini mexican quiches, it was great in both.  Everyone love it. We also had a tostada bar and it went on those, too!

This was a great dip.  I thought that it tasted a little better after a day or 2 of the flavors settling in together.

I absolutely LOVE cilantro, but this wasn't my favorite sauce as a dip.  However, it was great in a chicken wrap the next day.

This is soooo good. Be warned once you start eating with tortilla chips you will not be able to stop. Great as spread inside a tortilla with deli meat and lettuce for a quick tasty lunch too.

Awesome!  A welcome change from the usual dips.  I thought the cilantro would be over powering but it wasn't.  I also used this as a sauce for fish, as recommended, and it was great.

This was great, my husband continued to eat it even after I told him it had cream cheese in it (for some reason he won't eat anything with cream cheese). I wasn't too keen on the taste from the celery salt, so I won't add it next time.

Absolutely amazing.  I personally LOVE cilantro so this dip sounded great even before I read some of the reviews...and it was no disappointment.  I made it exactly as the recipe said and in one weekend had to make three batches to keep my guests happy.  Since then I've made it another 3 or 4 times and have had requests for the recipe every single time.  Absolutely WONDERFUL!!!

OMG, this is to die for!  Not overpoweringly cilantro flavored either.  I couldn't find tomatillo salsa so I used green taco sauce instead and it worked just great.

I used as a dip for southwestern egg rolls and it was fabulous. Later I ate it with tortilla chips. Very versatile. Also, I didn't use tomatillo salsa, just a regular kind and it was still good.

I didn't love this as much as I thought I would, after reading all the reviews.  It's good though - I served it on spinach enchiladas (trying to duplicate a restaurant dish I loved) and that was yummy.  I only used half a bunch of cilantro and it was still very strong, and I didn't like the celery salt - will use onion salt next time, and only about one loose packed cup of cilantro, but I will make it again!

YUM! I ate this with chips for a light dinner. I will be making this for chicken, shrimp, etc. in the future. I used fresh garlic, though. I think it might be a little for kicky that way.

Holy cow! This sure has a bite to it, but it was RAVED about at a recent party. In fact, when all the Southwestern Eggrolls I made were gone (in a flash, I might add) they were drizzling this sauce over everything else. One person paid another $20 just to ask around with the guests to find out who made it and where this recipe came from!

I thought this was good, but it was a little strong.  I am a cilantro aholoic, so that ingredient I love, but there was a little too much of something else, not sure if it was the celery salt or ground cumin.

This was outstanding!!  Everybody asked for the recipe at my party.  I couldn't find the tomatillo salsa (I live in FL), so I used salsa verde.  Turned out perfect.

This is soooo good.  I read the ingredients to my husband who promptly said, ew.  Of course when he tried it he really liked it.  I added a bit more lime juice - gave it an extra little bit of zing.  Really good.  It has a multitude of flavours!

I loved it!  But obviously you have to be a fan of cilantro to like this.  I made it to use as a dip (which was great) and look forward to using it as a sauce on chicken or fish in the future.  At first it was runny, but thickened up as it sat in the refrigerator overnight.

Didn't change a thing - so, so good. Took it to a Cinco de Mayo party and several people asked for the recipe.  Served with carrot sticks, celery and chips. Has a nice "zing" to it so be prepared.  Can't wait to try on fish or chicken.

I made this for a dinner party of 10 and EVERY one of them loved it - none was left.  I made it as a dip for chip, along with several others and also for pouring over the fish I BBQ'd.  Put it this way - there wasnt any LEFT to put over the fish because it went so quickly as a dip.

If you like cilantro, you'll LOVE this recipe. I use it as a dip for veggies or chips, and as a sauce and marinade for meats and fish. It's not only fantastic, but multi-functional!

It pays to be adventurous!! I absolutely HATE cilantro and opted to try this anyway
-just for something to do on a rainy day since I had all the ingredients...WOW-this is now my new favorite!!As per other reviews you do end up wanting to eat this with a spoon.Fantastic and you really could put it on just about everything.

This is the cilantro sauce I've been looking for.   It is very varsatile.  I've put it over cooked chicken breasts, pasta, and even used it for a dip for fresh veggies.  

Really good exactly the way the recipe is written.  Don't change a thing. Note: I have found that making this one day ahead of time makes the dip even better.  The flavors really come together if you let if sit in the fridge over night.

This recipe is good, but ultimatly I think something is missing from it. When I made it, I added a few more tablespoons of sour cream and a teaspoon of sugar to it to suit my family's tastes. I'll make it again, and tweak it a bit next time.

This sauce was sooo good!  I made shrimp and crawfish enchiladas last night and served this sauce on the side instead of sour cream.  It added a wonderful flavor to the enchiladas.  Everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.  I used about 1/4 cup of lite sour cream, used lite cream cheese, and used about 1/2 bunch of cilantro.  Great recipe...one I will make many times in the future.
