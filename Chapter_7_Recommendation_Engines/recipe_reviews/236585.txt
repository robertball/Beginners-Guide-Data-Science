I forgot the parmesan cheese so MY dish was really only 3 stars. I am giving it 4 stars because I imagine the cheese would have helped considerably! Also only had artichokes in water but it calls for marinated artichokes. That would have added flavor also. Scaled this back to 4 servings so had to estimate some of the seasonings. I used only 1/2 tsp pepper in ricotta mix. May try it again with correct ingredients! NOTE THAT IT TAKES APPROX 60 MINUTES to cook.

I never leave a comment usually! This was a good base for something I thought turned out awesome! Hammered out the chicken.. didn't make the oil because I forgot too. Made 2 chicken breasts. Used about a half a cup of cottage cheese one egg added the rest of the spices. Rolled up the chicken salt pepper drizzled olive oil and put the rest of the filling on top. Served with bow tie pasta. Was pretty good! Will make this again! Think next time I'll add some pesto though!

I used Panko Breadcrumbs after an egg wash on the chicken and I only stuffed it with thinly sliced mozzarella crushed bacon and diced mushrooms. Then I added salt and pepper to the top of the chicken and baked for 35 min on 350. Came out perfect which surprised me because the chicken breasts I used were really thick. Husband loved it! Made some mashed potatoes for a side came out well.

This recipe was good but there are definitely adjustments that need to be made. First I changed the number of portions to 4 which I was able to stuff 3 chicken breasts. I used smaller whole chicken breasts instead of the halves like the recipe called for. I was afraid that the chicken would be too dry if I used halves. The breasts worked better and were a bit more juicier than had I followed the recipe. The stuffing was ok. Too much pepper and no salt. The type of marinated artichokes I bought were not something I liked and will be using plain in the future. This way I can adjust the seasoning and add salt to be more to my liking. It also was a bit dry I will probably add some mozzarella to help balance out the moisture. The infused oil was good although I didn't read the recipe fully to see that it needed to sit a while. I left it out at room temperature to infuse. It can also be done on low heat. The warmth helps release the oils in the spices refrigeratoring it extends the infusion process. I gave the 3 rating because of the things mentioned above. If there were categories for the ratings the versatility of the recipe would be a 4-5. It is very easy to change up to individual tastes.
