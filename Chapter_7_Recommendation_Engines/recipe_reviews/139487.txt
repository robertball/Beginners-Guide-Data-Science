I love simple, but tasty.  If time permits, I add a smashed boiled egg to this.  I've learned over the years that most people I cook for prefer simple over spicey. Thanks for sharing!

This is the way I like tuna salad: nice and simple. I do like to add a little onion powder though; to me its more mellow and doesn't overpower the tuna like raw onion does. I also add 1/2 tsp brown mustard for a very slight tang, a pinch of salt, and fresh ground black pepper to taste. You could eat it right away, but it gets even better if you refrigerate overnight to let the flavors come together. I have bypassed many a tuna salad because it had raw onions and celery in it. And don't get me started on chopped hard boiled eggs...

This is a classic and no fail recipe. Sometimes I use half miracle whip and half real mayo, so its not so sweet. When I have a little more time to prepare it, I add chopped celery, and chopped hard boiled egg. My mom likes to add chopped apple.

Quick and easy lunch. I followed recipe as stated.  I tasted and then sprinkled in paparika, garlic and onion powder.  Tastes better after being chilled.  I have also made this using low-fat ranch dressing.  In the summer I will use this to stuff a garden fresh tomato!

Been making this recipe for years!  I converted to low fat, low carb by using fat free mayo and dill relish.  Serve on a low carb high fiber high protein whole grain wrap(carb down multgrain flatouts sold in the deli at walmart is my favorite) with some fresh spinich leaves for a healthy meal!!

This was my first time using relish in tuna salad and it wasn't bad.  I added a little garlic and onion powder along with some salt and cracked black pepper.  The relish definitely gave it a different taste.

Five stars for ease, five stars for taste.  I love that there isn't much needed to make a great tasting tuna sandwhich filling.  Can easily cater to your own favorite taste.  I added dashes of cayenne for spice and a small amount of tumeric for a richer flavor.  Good and easy!

Delish!  My pantry is bare... I was looking for a tuna salad recipe, but everything called for eggs, or more ingredients.  I was super happy to stumble across this, and even more happy b/c I actually had relish.  Very yummy!!!  I will definitely make this again.  I even had leftovers, which I plan on taking for lunch.

Southern Style: Keep the miracle whip & tuna but no relish - chop whole sweet pickles, just a rough dice, add diced boiled egg and a squirt or two of mustard.  Voila! Wonderful on bread or with crackers or lay some melted velveta over the top!  MMMMMMM

This is perfect - I always get something wrong when I do Tuna, these proportions are just right.  Do try 1/2 Tblsp Dijon, and 1 Tblsp diced onion, 1 egg, and any spices you like - enjoy!

I always go to Allrecipes to find the perfect starter base for any recipe that has to have a "certain taste".  This was perfect. Mylove said that he had a taste for the tuna salad from his childhood-the tuna salad his grandmother made for him when he was a little boy. I doubled the recipe and it was too "wet".  Mylove tasted it throughout as I added 2 pouches of Starkist tuna (no draining needed), 2 T each finely chopped celery, onion, 2 T. sweet relish (no juice), 1 T yellow mustard and 2 boiled eggs, finely chopped. After the final taste test, Mylove said, "Now THIS is the tuna salad my grandmother made for me when I was a little boy. Let's eat it now on kaiser rolls with lettuce and tomatoes tonight instead of waiting for tomorrow." It's great to be appreciated!

I'm not a big tuna fan but needed a recipe to use up a couple cans I had in my pantry. This is fast, easy, and easy to customize - I added a dash of chili pepper to mine and made a tuna melt with it!

Easy stand by recipe.  I added some rotini pasta to make mine a meal instead of a snack and it turned out great.  I also took another reviewers suggestion and added a little dijon mustard it was a nice little touch.  I also used fat free mayo and you could not tell the diffrence.

This is the easiest tuna salad to make. I added some dried minced onion at my son's request. This is a great base recipe. I sprinkled this with a little coarse ground black pepper.

Yes, excellent with just 2 important adds: 1 grated apple and 1/2 cup chopped celery.  Learned about including the apple from my Mother in Law, the world's greatest cook.

This was so easy and really tasty! Would never have thought to use relish.  I did mix miracle whip with reduced calorie mayo 50/50.

This recipe is just what I needed. Simple and quick, ready when the pregnancy hunger struck! I did use (and highly recommend using) low fat Greek strained yogurt (I use Fage) instead of Miracle Whip. Way more protein and much healthier option for me, baby inside and toddler son!

I LOVE the sweet pickle relish flavor with the tuna.  I tried dill pickle relish in the past and did not care for it but what a diferrence the sweet relish makes!  BTW - mayo (instead of Miracle Whip) also works well. I give this 5 stars for simplicity and good flavor.

Delivers nicely. It doesn't even matter if there's oil in the can (still drain though) if you use a light salad cream.

I used Ken's Steakhouse Creamy Caesar Dressing instead of Miracle Whip or Mayo and it was FANTASTIC!!  I also chopped up a couple sandwich style bread and butter pickles to put in instead of using relish.  I tell you, it was amazing! And my mom, who's never enjoyed Caesar dressing, she loved it!

Not much taste. I add some worchestershire, a touch of tabasco to give it more taste and some chopped celery to give it some crunch.

This is my standard tuna recipe.  If you want to cut back on the calories and fat--substitute plain yogurt for the miracle whip.  The relish gives it the zing and the yogurt makes it seem like the regular recipe.  A splash of mustard is a great addition also.

I just made this and in one bowl I mixed 'dill' relish and in another bowl I mixed 'sweet' relish, the dill relish with the sweeter Miracle Whip was so much better!!  Also, this girl only uses StarKist Solid White Albacore Tuna.  Any other kind besides solid white albacore is just mushy and to fishy.

Great base recipe. I double it, use lite mayo, add in a dash of garlic powder, onion powder, some  chopped celery, a dollop of brown mustard, and a diced hard boiled egg. I've made it with both dill and sweet relish - both work well. Always tastes better the next day!

The addition of pickle relish really made this tuna salad better than the norm. I love the tangy flavor the relish adds. I almost ate the whole can with crackers with my 3 yr old who also loves this recipe.

I don't know why, but I have never thought of or heard of putting relish in tuna salad. I usually just use tuna and miracle whip, maybe some onion or celery if I'm not being lazy. But this was excellent. I will be making it this was from now on. Actually, I didn't use sweet relish, I only had tangy dill relish, but I don't think it would make much of a difference. It was still good.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I also added a little pepper and a boiled egg just to give it a little more substance. Will make again!

I was skeptical, but made this for a sick friend who likes hers w/sweet relish and Miracle Whip.  Now I have a new favorite tuna recipe!  I don't like Miracle Whip in anything else, but this flavor combo is a winner.  Didn't need to add a thing.  Thanks!

This is the classic! My favorite of all time...  Try this mixed with cooked egg noddles for a quick "Tuna Salad Casserole" ;) You can add other ingredients, but I see nothing wrong with eating it just this way.

This is how I have made my tuna for years.  I usually add a little pepper or some Mrs. Dash blend.  When I am dieting, I use a little more of the water the tuna is packed in, and a little less salad dressing.

I could never find a way to make tuna salad taste great until I tried this recipe, it was great! I didn't have miracle whip so I used my Hellman's but I will use miracle whip for the next time and give it the extra zip!

Always delicious. However, I only use 2 tablespoons of mayo-esq stuff, because it tends to my stomach a little uneasy.  But, so yummy either way!

This is my go to recipe for tuna salad. It is really good! I add a dash of onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper. Not much, just a little. I also add a small shake of malt vinegar. Growing up with my grandpa, we use to sit and eat tuna (drained) will malt vinegar on it for a snack. Probably why I add a tad bit of vinegar to tuna salad. Simple, cheap quick, easy, and everyone loves it!

Simple and good, but I still added a few things to suit my taste. I did use regular mayo, celery and added a very small amount onion and garlic powder, salt, pepper and spicy brown mustard. I had it over romaine leaves with a few cherry tomatoes and lightly dressed with Italian dressing. After it stands, the other half will be good with crackers. Nice light and healthy lunch which I'll surely make again!

I Love it. Its simple and easy to make.
Sometimes I add an egg to it or just
use pickle relish, salad dressing and
mayo. I make it least three times a week,
and make  enough for two days to have
for leftovers.

I decided to make this last night as I wanted something that was light, simple, and quick.  It was a wonderful starting point for tuna salad.  I used more tuna than the recipe called for, which meant I had to adjust the other ingredients as necessary.  On the whole, it was great.  I added Old Bay seasoning, red onions, a pinch of garlic powder, and a little minced onion.  This is definitely a keeper in my weekly rotation.  I also anticipate that I'll be able to add pasta to it and make a nice tuna/pasta salad.  On the whole, I rate this 5 stars!

This is the exact tuna salad recipe that I've been using, but I've added shredded cheese to it since my toddler likes shredded cheese.  I definitely will try a little brown mustard and some onion powder since I'm not a huge fan of onions.

I usually make my tuna salad like this only I use Hellman's. I didn't add any onions this time but I like to also add a good tablespoon of chopped onion. A really nice light summertime dinner.
