This was wonderful! Didn't see the yogurt on the list of ingredients, so left it out, but tasted so good & creamy! (Also used 2 percent canned milk...out of fresh, so used a little extra.) My new favorite soup, quick, too!  Love that no flour or other thickener needs to be used to get this fabulous consistency.

It is true that this soup goes together quickly and easily.   As another reviewer indicated, though, this soup is sour; doesn't seem pumpkin-y at all.  Disappointed.

Awesome soup! I didn't add milk, cream or broth. Reduced the amount of yogurt - just added 4 tbsp, as the one I had on hand was sour. It tasted yummy in spite of the omissions!

So amazing!! I didn’t have cream, sour cream or onions but used onion powder, garlic, and ginger as well as a few favorite spices!! The only “creamy” thing in my fridge was egg nog (non-alcoholic)...so I added a cup & it was the perfect addition :D Love improvisation!!! LoL

This is a great base for a pumpkin soup that you can easily adjust to please your palate.  We prefer a bit more oomph, so doubled the curry and added a pinch of ginger. Also used heavy cream instead of the milk.  Delicious!

With 38 sugar pumpkins donated to the classroom I was looking for a good easy pumpkin soup recipe and some of my students found this one. We used up fresh roasted pumpkin puree. It was great, as we didn't have yougurt we subsituted sour cream and the flavor was amazing.  Thank you.
