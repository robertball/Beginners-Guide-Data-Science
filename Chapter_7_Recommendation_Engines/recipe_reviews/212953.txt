I made this tonight for dinner and we enjoyed it. I have used alot of recipes from this site and only make changes when I do not have what is called for as the case tonight. Along with the tomatoes I used 1 can of diced tomatoes(zesty chili) as I did not have enough fresh to double the recipe. Also I am not sure if the egg at the end is really needed, my family feels it would be fine without and just have more of a tomato style sauce. I served with pasta and salad. We will put this into one of our many favorites for the Lenten season.   Thank you for a wonderful dish that could also be made with chicken for those folks that do not care for fish.

I loved it! I am on a low carb diet, but I can imagine it would be even better over rice. I liked that it was so different from the dill or blacked recipes I get in a rut for salmon. It was very different!

Tasty sauce and so quick and easy! I had to use a can of diced tomatoes because good tomatoes are out of season right now. My sauce turned out slightly pink because of the egg....make sure you beat the egg real well and stir quickly as you add to the sauce. I didn't taste the egg but it thickened the sauce up quickly. It worked great with my Salmon burgers, served over whole wheat pasta.

Loved it. Full of flavor.  We left the salmon whole, so stirred in the eggs before putting the salmon back in.  So delicious and more hearty than most salmon dishes.

Lots of flavor. Served over brown rice, but not even sure it needed to be served over rice.  I'm doing a yeast-free cleanse and this recipe was perfect.  Will be making this again, and soon.  I had fresh spinach on hand, and tossed some in at the end just before I added the egg.  Only recommendation I would make is double the sauce because it is so good, you'll want more.

Loved this absolutely simple and hassle free recipe!  (I also used canned diced tomatoes).  I was hesitant about the egg at the end but I loved it. I found it killed a little of that tangy tomato taste that stays if you don't cook tomato sauce long enough. My husband also loved it and I will definitely be making this one often.  Thanks for posting!!

I ended up using filets of steelhead for this and it came out really good. Especially over a bed of steamed rice

Ma Sarap, Lola... The only thing I added was 1 tablespoon of fish sauce when cooking the tomato. Served it with Shiratake noodles. Will definitely be making this again.

This was very good (and second time I have made it)! The only adjustment I made was to use a can of drained diced tomatoes as I didn’t have fresh. I also broke up the salmon to make the sauté easier and for better mixing with the egg. I made once before and served over rice; this time I served with broccoli and crescent rolls on the side. It also did take about 40 minutes - I often find the time to make the recipes on this site take longer than stated, but this one was accurate. Very simple and very good. Has been added to our regular rotation at the request of my husband!
