This is very similar to the "On Wisconsin Brats" recipe posted years ago on this site. My review then, and now, for this recipe applies... GREAT RECIPE; GOOD STUFF FROM JOHNSONVILLE!  Johnsonville has "cornered the marketplace" when it comes to Brats, Italian Sausage and anything Wisconsin! Thank you!

"I'm from Wisconsin and have been tailgating for 40 years in Madison and Green Bay. I have to tell you that if you are going to have a Wisconsin Brat, you better grill them first and have your hot marinade ready to receive them off the grill. Once off the grill, allow them to set for at least an hour in the marinade before serving. I usually make brats for a "crowd" the day before and allow the brats to sit overnight in the marinade. An hour or so before the tail gate I simply take my "huge" Bucky Pot full of brats and marinade and place it right on the grill for the "re heat". The brats are flavorful and melt in you mouth... oh, don't forget, use a slotted spoon to take out the sliced onions and garlic from the marinade to put on the brats.. OUT OF THIS WORLD. This is a good recipe for rainy days but, I agree with another reviewer, the flavor of the brat is lost to some degree in this recipe. You must also use a "strong" full bodied dark beer. I would use Augsburger Bock beer if it were still made out of Monroe, Wisconsin... ahhhh those good old fall days with a blue sky, cool breeze, the scent of fall leaves and grills, a cold beer, the laughter of friends and a good old fash

Read all the reviews before trying this fun recipe. Didn't change any recipe ingredients or measurements but did marinate the sausages in half the beer before grilling them. Then popped them  in the beer, onion and butter bath that had been in the oven at 400 degrees. After 7 minutes cranked up the broil/grill element in the oven and grilled for 3 minutes... Quick, easy, yummy and disappeared in a jiffy! No time to take a photo of this dish. We all devoured it, raving about the delicious taste.   Will definitely make again!

Brings back fond memories of tail-gating at Lambeau Field! Brats cooked and served just like they do in my home state of Wisconsin. The only change I made was to cook the onions in the butter a bit, to bring out the sweetness of the onions before adding them to the hot tub. Great recipe!

The way we always do is to cook 1st in the beer/onions, then grill.  Any not eaten immediately go back in the beer to stay hot.  Also, you should poke some holes into the brats so the beer & onion favor goes into them.  Doing that would make it a 5 star rating.  Some of the grease leaks out so a bit healthier and the beer/onion favor makes up for any loss of juiciness.

I also 'use the opposite process and cook with onion and beer, then on the grill.' But... you MUST use a GOOD, HEAVY BEER! Typical, mainstream American beers (Bud, Miller, PBR, etc.) won't give your brats the flavor they deserve! If you cook them in ANY "Lite" beer, you may as well cook them in WATER!!!
Use a good, craft-domestic or a good import. You WILL taste the difference!

I have never cared for brats, but my family does.  Because of the reviews of this recipe, I decided to give it a try.  I did follow the recommendations of others.  I cooked the onions in butter and poked holes in the brats.  I then added the beer and cooked it in the oven for 45 minutes.   My husband then grilled them for about 15minutes.  I am now a convert.  These are fantastic!

having cooked hundreds of johnsonville brats while working at a golf course, i feel confident in making a couple suggestions.

1. grill the brats first. give them a little char before adding them to the beer, this adds good flavor. you don't need to cook them completely, they'll finish cooking in the beer (as long as your grill is at a high enough temperature).

2.  sautee your onions first. putting them in the beer first just gives you boiled onions, carmelizing them first brings out the natural sweetness (i suggest yellow or even vidalia onions rather than white).

This is now the only way we cook brats.  The only difference is that we cook in the hot tub and then brown on the grill and then back in the hot beer to be served.  We use Guinness Extra Stout and is so good!

I followed this recipe pretty much as written. I did follow the advice of others and marinaded the brats over nite in dark beer, butter & onion.  A couple hours before you plan to eat,  place the pan back on the grill on low to warm up.  These were so easy to make and so delicious.  I made them for our Labor Day bbq and everyone wanted the recipe.

There is something about the seasoning in Johnsonville Brats that I prefer over others.  However, following the direction of my neighbor from Wisconsin, use  the opposite process and cook with onion and beer, then m on the grill.

very good I think better than boiling first and then putting on grill I've done that too but these had great flavor!! Used Shiner Boc beer, added a few pepper flakes and garlic powder to it (came from another recipe ) but I don't think it really changed much. I hate reviews that don't use the original ingredients so sorry about the little addition.

I cannot count the number of times I've made this since trying it out this past summer, at least a dozen.  I've tried it without the butter but it adds something - a juiciness maybe.  Don't skip a thing, use any brats (we have) they all turn out amazing with this Brat Hot Tub!

These were not for me. I am not a beer drinker but the hubs liked them. I really liked the flavor of the Johnsonville Brats. I will make them again but just using the brats and onions.

These were awesome. 5 of us ate them and everyone enjoyed it. I would let the onions cook a little longer (personal preference) but the recipe is simple and delicious.

I made these using a Deschutes Black Butte Porter and they were knock-your-socks-off amazing. I did cheat a little and marinate them for 12 hours in the onions and beer first, but you really can't go wrong here.
