My husband really enjoyed these, said they were his new fave!! I'd say that is a pretty positive review. I forgot to pick up mascarpone (but will in the future), so I used sour cream. Because this is something I would like to have more often than holidays, I cut the butter by more than half and still thought it had a nice rich flavor. We both enjoyed the light fluffy texture and I enjoyed being able to make it earlier in the day. Thanks, Chef John.

Made these for Thanksgiving and they were so good and so easy!!  Used Yukon Gold potatoes (because had them already) and only used one stick of butter (instead of two) based on the other reviews. The dish far exceeded the effort and everyone loved it. I made this the night before, up until the point of cooking it - and just set it out about an hour before putting into the oven. I cooked it a total of 25 minutes (just because I got busy) and the extra time was fine. I used my convection oven and had planned to use the broiler to get the peaks to brown, but they browned on their own without the broiler.  I didn't have an extra 9x11 dish so I used a Pyrex oblong glass dish that is approx. 8x11x2.5 and it worked perfect. This will be a go-to side for many occasions and potlucks to come!

Great idea to add mascarpone but doing so makes it more rich i would definitely cut the butter by half at least.

I added a little more masrcapone and more salt. I think this recipe needs 2 sticks of butter. Spread out over 14 people it's a reasonable amount of butter.  
I read some reviews that said the potatoes were watery. No matter what recipe I follow I return the potatoes to the pot after draining and mash them there allowing them to dry off a bit. The steam they let off keeps them from being watery.

I made the mascarpone potatoes for a large Easter meal and they were wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly  but noted several problems with the recipe as posted: (1) it does not list specific amounts of salt & pepper. I added 1 tsp of each to the mascarpone/egg yolk/milk mixture, then salt to taste AFTER combining the mascarpone mixture with the potatoes and butter. The potatoes were perfectly seasoned as a result. (2) The recipe calls for seasonings (salt, pepper) twice - once when mixing the mascarpone/egg yolk/milk, and again when combining this mixture with the potatoes and butter. I wonder if the second addition of seasonings is a mistake - except for salt to taste. I accidentally used 8 oz. (1 cup) of mascarpone instead of 1/2 cup, and the potatoes turned out fine. I also used a hand mixer to whip the potatoes rather than whisking by hand (I'm not a fan of lumpy potatoes.) Be sure to view Chef John's video on making the potatoes and use 4-1/2 lb. of large russets as he suggests. Thanks for a great recipe! - it's easy to make and delicious.

Every T-Day I try a new mashed potatoes recipe and also make a bowl of regular boxed mashed potatoes as a backup (or for the boring unadventurous relatives, heehee). I've never tried or tasted marscapone and I don't normally use actual butter in stuff (the dreaded margarine, I know). My stores were out of the cheese so I made my own from an online recipe. Not knowing what I was aiming for was interesting but anywho. So I was able to make this recipe and I had to stop relatives from getting seconds before everyone else had made their plates. It was a success and the ol' backup bowl of the boxed stuff went mostly untouched. As always, thank you Chef John!!  You always come through.

As I was putting it together I knew I wanted more Mascarpone. As we were eating dinner, everybody agreed about more Mascarpone. So, I hope you'll get this tiny hint on some very good mashed potatoes.

The mascarpone is a genius addition.   I used more though than the recipe called for.  My potatoes came out decadent, creamy and delicious.

Mine came out pasty and a little runny, so I think I must have over-worked them.  Had tried a new handheld immersion blender and whisker. The potatoes looked fine initally but once put in the oven to bake, became pasty and runny.  The amount of liquid called for may also be too much.

Made this according to the recipe and it was very liquidy... Tried putting it back in the oven for longer and it didn't help. Next time I will use less milk and butter than the recipe calls for.

The recipe wasn't hard to understand but getting the right amount of potatoe was challenging. I did pick up 5lbs of potatoes and a quarter of the largest potato off. I forgot to get cows milk when getting the mascarpone so I used original almond milk that I had and no odd taste. The peaks browned a bit. They looked adorable.

Easy. Mine seemed a bit salty, but I suspect I did something wrong along the way. Still, it was the dish that did not stretch to the day after Thanksgiving, my guests ate it up!

Excellent!  A great way to include a traditional and expected food in a holiday meal, but makes the flavor more interesting and can be made ahead of time. Definitely a winner.

I made these, added chopped fresh rosemary, and they were the best potatoes I have ever had!  I made these the night before Christmas dinner, put them in the fridge, then set them on the counter one hour before baking.  So delicious!

These are the BEST potatoes ever!  My hubby said to make  only these whenever I make mashed potatoes.  I used yukon gold potatoes as there are my favorite potato to mash.  Next time I will reduce the butter to make a little healthier.

Was ok, but essentially tasted like normal mashed potatoes.  Liked the idea of browning the top (visually very appealing), but needed something else to punch the flavor up.

Really good. I used more marscapone and less better than the recipe called for, 3/4 cup each and was very pleased.I think as written would be good, too. These were very good without gravy. I think regular mashed potato probably makes a better gravy holder ;-) I would definitely make again.

Definitely will make these again.  Similar to other mashed potato casserole dishes with sour cream and/or cream cheese, but the mascarpone is heavenly and takes it to a whole new level. Hubby knew I did something different but couldn't tell what it was.  He (and I ) thought they were great!

Impossible to add too much butter.   [You deserve this on special occasions.]   So so easy to make.   Most difficult (and only) part was doing those little scoops/dips  on top to create that browning effect.

I followed the recipe as noted but I took a few reviews to heart and made a few minor changes.   

First I doubled the Mascarpone .   A few people mentioned the amount needed to be increased so I doubling it.   Pretty much emptied the container.   I also thought the recipe amount of Mascarpone was not enough for the 4. 5 potatoes.   

I also put in a second egg yolk for more creaminess.    

I dialed back the butter just a tad to 1 3/4 cups.   A few people reported it being too runny. 

The potatoes were off the charts.   Not runny at all. 

Thanks Chef John.

The best!!! The best!!!  Very smooth and creamy.  Great tasting too.  I will never make mashed potatoes any other way. I used half n half in lieu of milk (needed more fat..lol) and the dish is now a must for Christmas dinner..... Thanks Chef John

I made the casserole the day before and baked them just before serving.  Saved me so much time and energy.  I prepared them according to the recipe and they were just excellent.  Thank you so much.  This recipe is a keeper.

I cooked in vegetable oil then a tiny bit of olive oil, but that thyme really makes that butter! Overall: DELICIOUS. Fantastic recipe. Will DEFINITELY make again!

The Mascarpone cheese comes in a tub like a spreadable cheese...I wasn’t sure what I was looking for when I was shopping. It added a nice richness to the potatoes; and I was asked for the recipe from my guest, always a good sign!  I would definitely make these again!

I made this just before Thanksgiving as a trial run.  I used slightly less butter than the recipe asked for - but would put in the full amount.  It was delicious!  I loved how the casserole browned and slightly puffed up in the oven.  The mashed potatoes were light, fluffy and decadent!  It will be on my Thanksgiving menu!

Outstanding recipe!  My family is already asking that I make it again soon.  I couldn't find the Mascarpone cheese where I live so I substituted a recipe of cream cheese (16 oz), sour cream (1/3 cup) and heavy whipping cream (1/4 cup) which I found online. This recipe make about 1 1/2 cup - more than is needed for the recipe, but it is yummy and you will likely find other uses for it.

I liked this dish but was not crazy about it.  Made it as written but would probably not make again.

I made these exactly as described and I didn't find they had a different taste or texture than normal mashed potatoes. Family members didn't find them special either. It was a lot of extra work for nothing in my opinion.

I made this for my first Thanksgiving meal. It was a complete success! Everybody commented on how good it was. I will be making it again...probably tomorrow because there were no leftovers!

Made it exactly the way it is written.  It is OK, but failed to Wow me.  I watched the video of Chef John making it and did learn a little something new about how to boil the potatoes before mashing.  Peel and only cut them once down the middle as opposed to cubing them.  Thanks!

I made this recipe as written, except upped the butter and mascarpone, thinking that the amounts weren't much compared to the bulk of potatoes.  While the presentation was very pretty, I thought the taste was dull and the recipe not really worth the effort.  Sorry, I really wanted to love these.

The flavor of these mashed potatoes was good, but they did not turn out nearly as creamy as I had hoped.  I'm giving them a "meh."
