This made enough batter for a 13x9 and at least 12 cupcakes.  Baked the cupcakes for 22 minutes and the 13x9 for ~55 minutes.  I used only 2 cups of sugar and used 3/4 c. oil and 3/4 c. unsweetened applesauce.  It was delicious!

Very moist, zucchini is hardly detectable. The baking times is way off though. I used a 9x13x2 pan as recipe said but the cooking time was about 1 hr.. I believe if one used a jelly roll pan, then maybe it would bake in 30 min. Baking it longer made for a little bit of a cripsy crust which my husband really liked.

I used this recipe for cupcakes, without the swirl and just frosted it with cream cheese frosting. I brought it to a work party and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved it and a few of my coworkers even took some home for their kids and husbands because they loved them so much. Made TONS of cupcakes and they were super duper moist! I saved this recipe and will for sure be using it many more times in the future!

This cake is good as is and would also be fun to play with the ingredients. It was extremely moist. I cut the recipe down to 1/3 and it fit perfectly into an 8x8 pan. As other reviewers have noted, the baking time was very off. I cooked at 375 for 25 minutes then lowered the temperature to 350 and baked an additional 20 minutes. A minor change I made to the recipe was using half veggie oil and half applesauce instead of canola oil. I also used low-fat cream cheese. Neither change compromised the recipe whatsoever. It was good and I will probably be making this again with a bit of tweaking!

Nice, moist cake brownie.  Simple to do and it makes a big sheet, so it serves many.  Good picnic recipe.  Thanks!

Try using the macaroon (coconut) mixture from the Chocolate Macaroon Tunnel Cake elsewhere on this website, in place of the cream cheese in this recipe.  Drop by heaping teaspoonsful over the cake and swirl lightly through batter for a fabulous variation!

I made this for my son's 1st birthday party. Everyone loved it. Even those who normally hate zucchini gobbled it up-and then had seconds! I made a small cake for my son (to destroy) and if I hadn't, the 9x13" pan would probably have overflowed while baking. They also took about an hour to bake. The only other alteration I made was to replace the milk chocolate chips with white chocolate chips. I will definitely use this recipe again!

Definitely too much batter for one 9x13 pan.  I also would make a dozen cupcakes with part of the batter.  Baking time is closer to 45 to 50 minutes if you put all the batter in the cake pan.  Otherwise a very good recipe.  I topped it with white chocolate and semisweet chips, coconut and pecans and it was delicious.   Will definitely make again.

This recipe was very disappointing.  There was too much batter to fit in the 13X9 baking pan, so it overflowed while baking.  It took twice as long to cook than the recipe stated.  The taste was very oily.  A lot of ingredients and preparation  for a below average cake.

I had an excess of zucchini and didn't want to waste it so I found this recipe and decided to try it.  It was the moistest chocolate cake we ever had and didn't need icing.  I didn't even use the chocolate chips.  It was delicious and I'll make it again and again.

As written, this cake just did not work for me.  It took 55-60 minutes to bake, rising way up to the top of the pan.  And though I liked the idea of the cream cheese, the baking batter pushed all of the swirls toward the center of the pan, concentrating the cream cheese in the middle.  By the next day, the center was unpleasantly gobby and wet.  If I ever decide to try this again, I'll put the batter in a jellyroll pan, leave out the cream cheese and chocolate chips (which sank anyway), and frost it.  In the meantime, I'll stick with my usual chocolate zucchini cake recipe and batter that isn't so soupy.

I followed this recipe to a t. The pan is too small for this amount of batter. The amount of time is not long enough to bake it. By the time my cake was done there were no swirls in it. I usually read reviews before I make any recipes from this site. I wish I had read these first. I would have used a sheet cake pan instead of a 9x13. Cake is good but I am very disappointed after doing all that work to make it.

This makes a jelly-roll pan size - not 9 x 13!  Baking time is correct when you use the larger pan.  Wonderfully moist, zucchini is not detectable (other than you can see it).  My entire family LOVED this - including my kids who hate zucchini.  Will definitely make this again!

9.27.2017 - This cake turned out very moist. A great way to use up your garden’s bounty of zucchini. I was a little leary of using the full 3 cups of sugar called for in fear it would put us into a sugar coma. The full amount was fine as it did not leave the cake overly sweet. Definitely had to bake longer than the recipe called for. It took about 55 minutes in my oven. The taste of this reminded me of Texas sheet cake recipes made in the jelly roll pans. I’m thinking if this was baked in jelly roll pans the 30 minutes baking time would be sufficient. I considered adding frosting but this definitely does not need it. Updated 10.18.2017 - Many reviews state they had a problem using a 9 x 13 pan. I want to make mention that I did use a 9 x 13 x 2 cake pan without any issues.

This is a very delicious, chocolate dessert for any and all chocolate lovers.   The cream cheese batter swirl just sets it all off!!   Very good use of extra zucchini in the garden!!  I used only semi-sweet mini chips on the top since I am not a milk chocolate fan.  I also added a tsp of ground cinnamon for some extra flavor.    I agree with some of the other people who have rated this recipe---baking time is at least 1 hr total for the 9x15 pan.   I have made this a few times and found that by putting a loose foil cover on about 1/2 way through the baking process it keeps the edges from getting too dry.   Going to have a family get together in a few weeks and plan on making this again for that occasion.

this is for a sheet cake size pan.  prior reviews some used 13 x 9.  this will make a 13x9 and a loaf pan if you don't have a sheet cake pan. moist, delicious, one of the best cakes I have ever eaten.  I followed recipe exactly. my family and grandkids love it!

It is necessary to squeeze a good amount of moisture out of zucchini before adding it to the batter.  That should fix the soupiness and baking times.

Need to correct the instructions and the amounts of some of the ingredients. Difficult to get the middle cooked. Had to put in a larger pan and still had to make longer than 30 min.  Should have read the reviews before baking.

My mom made this recipe and it broke my heart that this recipe failed her.  But the recipe is the problem, not my mom's baking.  As so many others have commented, the bake time wasn't correct, and the pan size wasn't appropriate.  But my 2 main concerns about this cake is  WAY too much oil, and the zucchini should be squeezed before using.  Many bakers know this about using shredded veggies, but my mom follows recipes to a T, a perfect T, so she ends up with very wet cake that never completely baked in the middle, despite leaving it in the oven for way longer than instructed.  The edges taste good!  This recipe has all of components of an awesome cake, but if a baker is going to post a recipe online for everyone to see, they need to include ALL instructions!  Some recipes can handle unsqueezed zucchini, but NOT THIS ONE.  Not to mention this cake is literally shiny because it has so much oil in it.  Halve the oil, or even less than half.

OK, 3 Stars because the directions are Not clear/correct.  I wrote a very long review, but I deleted it.  I made a lot of changes.  I am not sure if anyone is interested.  It drives me nuts when a reviewer, reviews a recipe but has changed everything about it.

Note:  As other reviewers have stated...  there is way to much batter/mix.  I made "24 mini cupcakes" and a "9x13 pan" (they were over full).  I baked the 9x13 @ 350 for 50 mins. (used a dark pan) and the mini's @ 350 for 21 mins. (used a dark pan).

I followed the recipe except I used dark chocolate cocoa powder and all semi-sweet choc chips.  It seemed a huge amount of batter so I made the 9x17 and also a 5x9 cake.
 It is a nice moist cake with a wonderful chocolate flavor. I will make it again I am sure

I am at 6,000 ft altitude and mine took closer to an hour to bake

Added about 1/2 cup of extra flour as batter very runny.  Did make 6 cupcakes from it also ... or might have overflowed pan as it does rise a lot.   Does take longer to cook .   But pretty good.  I did substitute avocado oil for canola and used natural cane sugar instead of white sugar.

very bland in flavor and took FOREVER to bake. Per another readers comments after I made it trying to figure out what happened....break this recipe out into a cake + a minimum of 6 cupcakes if not up to 12.

Everybody in the house loved it. Have made it 3 times at this point.  I followed advice in other reviews and used 2 cups of sugar instead of 3 cups. 3 cups would definitely be too sweet. I also put some of the batter in a second square pan as suggested since it made a lot of batter. I used almond milk instead of buttermilk because I didn't have any. I added a little vanilla to the cream cheese mixture the second time, and it definitely adds to the taste. I replaced all of the oil with unsweetened apple sauce. It came out nice and moist. I used bittersweet chocolate chips (60% cacao). I cooked it for an hour after seeing other reviewers did this. It definitely needed an hour to bake.  Next time I'm going to try replacing the sugar with agave syrup and see how it turns out.

Very tasty but I would put it in a jelly roll pan next time.  It took almost an hour to bake in a 9x13.

Definitely a keeper! Read the other reviews and just baked it in a larger 15 X 10 pan. Amazingly moist & no one believed there was zucchini in it!!!

This cake turned out perfectly with a few changes to the directions.
After reading the reviews, I used a sheet cake pan plus an 8X8 square pan because I did not want the cake overflowing in my oven. I did substitute 1/2 C of applesauce for 1/2 C of the oil and decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup. Also I added 1 tsp of almond extract to the cream cheese mixture while beating it. It took about 40 minutes baking time in glass pans before both cakes were done. Next time I make this recipe I will try it with egg replacement since one family member is allergic to eggs.
