I'm late with this review. I used less than 1/2 c. powdered sugar and "Three Buck Chuck" White Zin.  Marinated 24+ hours.  I served over chunks of light Angel Food cake and topped with Cool Whip.  My guests were salivating!
THE FIRST TIME I MADE THIS, MY FRIEND, HUSBAND, AND I JUST TOOK SPOONS AND HUDDLED OVER THE BOWL!

Didn't measure the ingredients, just eyeballed. Loved the flavor that the wine emparts to the strawberries. Used a New Zealand sauvignon blanc. You don't want a chardonnay because this variental's characteristics would bite with the fruit.

This is a great little "dessert".  I suggest slicing the strawberries as thin as you can vertically, but not too thin.  Also, use confectioners sugar because it will dissolve easier.  I have them sitting in Moet and Chandon White Star Champagne.  It's not too sweet but it has the kick that soda gives you. GREAT!

Loved it used my cheap White Zin. Made it taste a lot better then it ever should. Ate them straight not on any cake or ice cream, thinking i will get some ice cream tommrow and eat the rest with that. I did let them soak for about 6 hours and expect the rest to taste better tommrow.

This is a good low cal recipe for those days you are craving sugar. I made with Chardonnay and let sit overnight. I would love to try this with a good champagne.

Good Recipe. I used wine that had sugar in it (arbor mist), and I think that helped a lot.  The strawberries were better the 3rd day of sitting then they were the 1st however.

This was great! I read the reviews first and used powdered sugar instead of white sugar and I marinated them in the morning and we ate them that night.  I served them in wine glasses with fresh whipped cream on top, they were a hit!

I still needed a little sugar, but that could have been because of the wine I used. Very good.

I tried it with the strawberry and wondered what it would be like with fresh pineapple. We only used about half the sugar. I definitely want to try it with other fruits, too.

Needed to use up over ripe strawberries so used a mini bottle of white wine that I used for a main dish.  I let this dish sit overnight because I made them late the night before.  I felt the wine definitely overpowered the berries.

Not bad.  Next time, I will use a sweeter wine (Peisporter maybe) than Chardonnay.  It made the strawberries somewhat bitter.  Also, I may try using powdered suger instead of granular.  The wine was delicous!

I've made this with both white and red wine and they are both equally good. A sweeter wine is better in my opinion.

This was awesome!  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 c and used a White Zin; I let it sit in the fridge over night.  I prepared it for Mini Cheesecakes I (recipe from this site)for a bbq and everyone loved it.  My husband and I also topped Angel Food cake with it.  Yum!

I marinated it overnight, which improved the flavor and cuts down on the wine-y aftertaste. It's very good served over angelfood cake! I served it after a rich dinner (alfredo), and it was a perfect dessert.

So simple and wonderful! I eye-balled the ingredients and served it for dinner on Valentine's Day poured over top of a homemade Powdered Sugar Pound Cake - my husband (who isn't a big cake fan) couldn't get enough.

This was a very refreshing dessert and very little prep required. As 1 reader suggested serving it over bisquick shortcakes, which is what I did, It was just perfect as the dry cake absorbed the juice. Yumm! Great for summer picnics too!

I enjoyed this recipe! I capped the strawberries and sliced them in half.  I cut back on the sugar a little because the strawberries that I had were very sweet. I used a Kabinnett wine which is on the sweeter side as well. I marinated these strawberries for two days in the fridge. Only because I forgot them the day that I made them. The last day I added fresh blueberries and let them marinate for about 1 hour. I used the bisquick recipe for individual shortcakes and spooned the strawberry/blueberry mixture and a few spoons of the wine mixture over the cakes which I cut in half. A huge hit! They turned out beautifully and tasted fabulous too! I didn't have any whipped cream, but I am sure that a spoon full would have been great on top!

This recipe was good, not great.  I've made it alone and served it on shortcake with whipped cream, which was particularly nice.  (For an easy dessert, try it with the recipe for shortcake on the back of a box of Bisquick.)

This was alright. A nice, light, fruity side dish maybe or light dessert. Didn't have a super amount of taste but that can be expected. Wine did complement the fruit nicely though.

Maybe I did something wrong ... like maybe a more distinct wine should have been used.  We didn't think it was that great.

This was so good!  Would be great over ice cream but I ate them right out the bowl.

It might be good with a different white wine, but vermouth was all I had on hand, and it added a slight bitter taste to the strawberries on top of the floral drama associated with vermouth.  Had it been a fresh bottle, it might have been better.  I'll try it again, but with a freshly opened bottle of chardonnay next time.

I loved these! I also used white zin but it was a little lackluster. I think next time (maybe tomorrow) I will try it in a  sauvignon blanc. I drizzed it over slices of vanilla iced pound cake as well as ate them alone. Yummy either way!

Oh is this nice. I'm glad I saved some strawberries for this recipe because the other one I made was a big disappointment. I did as one of the reviewers suggested and marinated it overnight. I used a blush wine. I was a little piggy and ate most of the strawberries myself! LOL!! They are so good. I added a lot of sugar becuase I love my strawberries super sweet. This is a definate keeper! Thanx for a great idea Shelly!

Yum! Needed to use up some flat old prosecco and this was a perfect way! I used about half the sugar and marinated overnight. Served the berries over a wine cake with a little whipped cream- delicious! Drank the  left over wine/juice! Will definitely make again.

This "Strawberries and Wine" is excellent!  I can hardly wait to make this again! The next time I make it I will mix my wine and sweetener at room temperature (instead of cold wine from the fridge) so they mix together better. Thank you Shelly for sharing your recipe.

Really good! Would definitely use a sweeter wine or champagne next time (I had an open bottle of chardonnay so I used that) Serve over ice cream, angel food cake, pound cake or just eat by itself. Delicious! This recipe is easily halved or quartered for less servings.
