To confused Punkin: wet refers to rinsed rice. Depends if you get whole long rice or cheaper version. Also big factor, many methods, times, ways to cook cabbage rolls. Stove top, shorter cook time needs longer time to soften rice. Ground pork (not Bob Evans type breakfast, spiced sausage) should be used. Don’t form very tight meatballs, to let rice expand. Paprika, 1 to 2 T. Mix in filling. Put bigger leaves on bottom of pot. No need at all to save cabbage water. If your V8 and tomatoes WITH juice don’t just cover rolls, add a little water to pot. Bring to just boil and then let simmer about two hours.

Good old fashioned recipe which we usually baked in the oven.  I was happily surprised how it came out in the crock pot. The only thing I did different was not use tomato juice.  I mixed some canned tomato sauce with a carton of chicken broth.  Next time, I will season it up a little more to suit our tastes, maybe use spicy italian sausage instead of mild, but as written, this is very good.  We liked it! To the reviewer named punkin...the rice is wet because it was rinsed...not cooked.  Also, I did not use the water from the cooked cabbage.  I personally don't think it would add any significant flavor  but if you need more liquid in the pot, it's right there.

I'm confused.  Can someone help??   The recipe ingredients call for uncooked rice but the instructions say 'stir in wet rice'.... What is the reserved water from the cabbage used for??  Is it to cook the rice partially??  I'm sure this will be delicious.....

Excellent recipe. My changes included skipping the rice, season meat with rosemary and thyme, salt, pepper and garlic. Put in slow cooker  or electric frypan,  put small red potatoes around rollups, cover with home canned stewed tomatoes or diced tomatoes. Add 1/2 jalapeño if you want a little heat. Your guests will be begging for more!

This is very good.  I always add a teaspoon full of Allspice to my sauce.  Its very subtle, and delicious.  People taste and say "What is the mystery flavor?  We love it!"

This is pretty much how we always made cabbage rolls and my family. The only addition would be, I put canned petite diced tomatoes in with the meat and rice mixture. And I always use Sacramento Tomato Juice  if you can find it. I pour it over the cabbage rolls before I bake them. It just adds a special flavor. Some brands of tomato juice and vegetable juice are too sweet for my taste. I really like the flavor you get from the Sacramento brand tomato juice. I make a big batch and freeze  the leftovers.

Even after adding some extra spices, it came out bland, and after 7 hours of cooking the rice was still crunchy.

I made these but stuffed half of them with venison burger/cudhigi mix. And I did bake them because we didn't have the time to slow cook them. It took an hour and 45 minutes. They were delicious.

With a little guidance from my mom and this recipe, it was good. It reminded of my Granny's meals at her home. I didn't use sausage in the meat and rice mixture, but did add Polska kielbasa because that's what my family did. I enjoyed this meal, and it was not that difficult to make. Thank you for the recipe.
