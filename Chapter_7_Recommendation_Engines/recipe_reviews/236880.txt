Simple and full of flavor. This was my first time attempting tongue and it came out wonderful. I too made tacos topped with onion, cilantro, and tomatillo sauce. So tender!

Excellent!!! It reminds me of the morning tacos de Barbacoa I used to eat during my weekends in Monterrey, Mexico. 
I cooked it on Hi for 1HR and the on Low for 6 hours. There was NO need to add the butter. It was amazing!! 
It freezes very well too in ziplock bags.

Good Luck!!

First time making lengua, I had no idea it would be so easy or I would have been making it ages ago. Next time I will make a little salsa verde. Super tender and delicious.

The only way to cook beef tongue.  always leave the skin on since it keeps the flavor and juices in.

I was very nervous about this, but pushed myself to try it.  It was surprisingly good, well seasoned.   I used olive oil instead of butter because I'm following the autoimmune paleo protocol.  Other than that I followed the instructions.

This was so easy! I was worried about the  last step, peeling off the skin, since my knife skills are not good, but I needn't have worried: it practically peeled itself. I only wish I had bought two! One calf's tongue fed two people two tacos de lengua each.

I made this tonight. First time cooking a tongue.  Served as a taco with green chile salsa, cilantro and tomatoes.  I did add some red chill flakes, cumin and cayenne to the meat while I browned it.  A definite make again.

This is surprisingly good for how simple it is. It is perfect for busy parents. My Central American husband ate about half of this recipe as tacos in one setting and said that it was the best he had ever had--even better than the taquerias he has been to. I am making this again tonight with a side of homemade salsa and I wish I had doubled the recipe.

Probably won't do that again. The recipes I saw for authentic Lengua tacos don't really call for much other flavors. The one I used had S&P, onion, garlic and bay leaf.  This recipe.  I added in lime and jalapeno and then it was pretty good.  Otherwise it was too bland for me.  The texture is a little weird and I really was kind of grossed out touching the gravely tongue when I peeled it. My SIL just about came out of his chair when I tried to get him to touch it. I ended up feeding that part to his dog. My daughter and I both loved the flavor of this after I got my extras in it. We had several. The rest of the crowd tended to avoid it, but maybe gave it a little taste to please me, but I think they were all weirded out by eating tongue. Also, I think that things would have been a little warmer last night if I had told my wife that she was eating tongue before she tried it. Still a little chilly today.   I'm having a hard time putting stars on this recipe, because I think if tongue is your thing, this is a really good, sound and easy recipe.   It's just not my thing.

Good recipe; my first attempt at lengua. I’d like to note that, after cooking and cooling, it’s important to remove ALL of the out later. I’m followed the directions precisely, and there seemed to actually be two layers of skin to remove from the top of the tongue. The smell of those layers was a bit off-putting, but after the meat was shredded and browning in the pan with butter , everything seemed all right. If I use this again, I’ll definitely double the recipe. One tongue barely fed one adult and two kids.
