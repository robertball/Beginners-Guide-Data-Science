This was soooo good!  Everyone at Christmas loved it and gobbled it up.  Made this as a last-resort after not having enough time to prepare our traditional stuffing... but now we may have a replacement!  Used chicken stock instead of sherry.

I absolutely loved it!  I normally skip the stuffing, but since I'm cooking this year, I thought I'd try a new kind.  I love tarragon seasoning so this was perfect.  I used chicken stock instead of sherry - it's what I had.  My boyfriend loved it too.  I'll make this every year.  Thank you so much!  I even took seconds of the stuffing this year!

OUTSTANDING!  I cooked it outside the bird in a covered casserole dish and used white wine instead of sherry.  Didn't have any sherry in the house. Really terrific.  This would be a great side dish for any poultry meal and its a breeze to make!

Very good!  I was leary of the tarragon... it gave it a very curious but good flavor that I didn't expect.  I used half regular onion cause I ran out of green, so I cooked them a bit in the butter to soften them up.  I also used Smart Balance spread, but would like to try the unsalted butter (didn't have any unsalted on hand).  I used sherry, but only 1 cup as it seemed moist enough.  (If I needed more, I think I'd fill in with chicken broth cause it had just a subtle sherry flavor and more would be too much.)  I cooked it in the oven for an hour, with a lid, and it didn't need any longer than that, but I did remove the lid and cook a hair longer to crispy the top a bit.  The only bad thing is I hate ripping up bread - might try getting the plain bagged croutons, and see if more liquid and cooking with the lid softens them up, cause I love the flavor.  And I didn't make it for any holiday - don't feel like I need one to be allowed to eat something. :-) So it was just a chicken meal.  (I do consider this is more like 8 servings, or 12 at most.  It's only 24 if everyone gets only a big spoonful.)

My family may have been too used to our traditional stuffing. I thought it was okay but there was a lot left over.

Too much sherry and I like sherry, next time I will do 1/2 broth and 1/2 sherry. I made my own bread crumbs from heals and bread I save in the freezer. I broke up the bread into extra small pieces as in a store bought stuffing size. I also use onion chives from my garden that are just about 6" up and fresh dried tarragon from my garden last year. I did not stuff a bird I cooked it in its own casserole dish on 350* for about 35 minutes.

This had a wonderful flavor, but I found it a little dry and added an egg and more stock.   I  am so used to making our "traditional" bread stuffing and this was a very good diversion.  I do not stuff the Bird, but make it on the side .  Maybe the reason it is dryer?  Will do it again.

I used three tablespoons of fresh tarragon instead of one tablespoon of dry, and I made the breadcrumbs out of whole wheat bread.  Tasters thought it was good, but that it had too much sherry.

Although I couldnâ€™t taste the tarragon, this stuffing was really good! I added celery to the recipe, so maybe this had something to do with it.  The stuffing was savory and my very picky husband loved it.

Very good. Easy for a first time stuffing maker. The part cooked in the pan turned out a little bit better then the part cooked in the bird. I added Fennel to give it a little earthier flavor. Even my plain meat and potatoes dad liked to the extra unusual flavor.

I did this in the oven, and it turned out amazing. Great flavor, great crunchy edges. My favorite part is the butter. It's super buttery. I will definitely make this again. 

Oh, I used chicken broth instead of sherry, because my hubs doesn't like sherry. Still great.

I'll admit, while I was cooking this I thought it was going to taste like onions and bread!! We started calling it onion stuffing, the smell of onions was quite overwhelming. But was very pleasantly surprised when it came out of the oven, this was so tasty!! And the taste wasn't too onions, it was a perfect balance. Even my incredibly picky brother in law, who doesn't like stuffing, thought this was pretty tasty!
