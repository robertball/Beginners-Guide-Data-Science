VERRRRY tasty! I had made a few diferent Tilapia recipies with my frozen bag of fillets from Sams, and this is my FAVORITE! :D I had never even broiled something before, if that helps show how easy it was as well. Most definitely making this again. I'll post my picture soon too!

Wow! This was delish - definitely restaurant quality! I made this with the Olive Oil Miracle Whip and skipped half the butter. This was super easy to make and will be on our menu rotation for quite a while. I served the Tilapia over brown rice and sauteed zucchini and yellow squash with garlic, olive oil and parmesan cheese. YUMMY!

Delicious flavor. The only thing I did different was bake it at 350 for about 15-20 minutes.

I did add panko crumbs for texture, and they are low fat so it doesn't take away from the healthy part. I used garlic powder and paprika in place of the celery salt....Delish!

WOW !! So Delicious ! If you are trying to get your kids to eat fish then this is the recipe you have to try. I usually cook Salmon on our fish nights just because of the benefits from all The Omega acids... However, after trying to branch out for some other fish , I bought Tilapia filets and have tried around 4-5 different recipes. This one by far is the best and easy too. The only thing I did before the initial broiling step was I did squeeze fresh lemon juice over the filets after a little salt and pepper. i kept the topping ingredients the same including fresh lemon juice. I don't know if it is just the right amount of ingredients blended together or what. To be honest, I didn't even measure the topping ingredients. I just estimated cause I'm old and have cooked since I was twelve.

We've been trying to eat healthier meals and include fish more often in our diet.  I made this tonight.  It was fabulous!  I used olive oil in place of the butter and used Old Bay in place of the onion salt/celery salt.  I also used fresh basil.  The family loved it!  Will definitely add it to my recipe box as a favorite.

This recipe was only ok for me. I wanted to try the healthier version of my favorite tilapia recipe but was disappointed with the outcome. The "sauce" was much more soupy compared to the original recipe so it didn't cover the fillets nicely, resulting in a less than desirable final result. I'll definitely stick to the full fat version in the future.

Have made it this way for years, but I use lemon/pepper and Old Bay is a must, no celery salt, and I add about a tsp dill. Eat it 1-2 times a week, for sure a keeper. Wonderful over a bed of spinach and rice pilaf.  YUM-guess this is dinner tomorrow, taste buds are kicking :-) Only 4* because of my changes.

Delicious & Easy!! Following the instructions exactly, it was wonderful. Second time around, I dropped the butter completely and added 1tsp dried oregano, spraying the tilapia on both sides with olive oil cooking spray. Yum!

Incredible. I made three changes to the ingredients- I did not have light mayonnaise and had to use regular.  I also substituted the 2 tablespoons (1/8 cup) butter for 1 1/2 tablespoons of Wildtree Roasted Garlic Grapeseed Oil.  AND I didn't have tilapia but I had Swai fillets which are also a mild fish and low calorie AND cheaper.  I MIXED the parmesan spread EARLY in the day and stuck it in the fridge until I was putting the fish in the oven.   My Swai fillets were just as thin as tilapia BUT I did increase the broil time.  I left my (electric)oven ajar and I used the HI broil option.  For TIME on BROIL I broiled top side for 5 minutes, flipped and cooked bottom side for 4 more minutes before adding the parmesan sauce to the top and broiling 2 1/2 more minutes until bubbly and BROWNing!  Incredible is a great word for this.  Someone else said "restaurant quality" and if you do this right it really is.  I baked a sweet potato and steamed some broccoli - My first bite from my plate was the fish but it was so good I knew I had to save it for last so I ate the potato and broccoli first.  It won't be long before this goes into the oven again!  A cookbook I am putting together for a wedding present will also definitely include this one! (with my alterations of course ;) )

This was delish!  Minor changes - I changed the serving to two (just my husband and I) and brushed the fish with olive oil before broiling.  Omitted the butter and added an extra tsp. of the lite mayo to the sauce mixture.  Sprinkled some panko bread crumbs on top and then finished it in the broiler.  Very yummy!  Thanks for sharing!

We loved it, and will certainly make it again soon. I used 1 T. Lite Mayo, and used coconut oil instead of butter. I made it in my toaster oven, and didn't flip the filets, I did add more seasonings; smoked paprika, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, and some Panko crumbs. It was so moist and yummy!

This was delicious!  I had not broiled fish before and was hesitant.  But this was soooo easy to make, quickly prepared and a simple clean up since I placed it on foil.  I kept the ingredients almost the same except for the butter which I substituted olive oil.  After reading the review that said the sauce was thin, I made mine thicker/less oil.  I was "ooing" and "ahing" all while I ate this.  I saved a piece for my lunch tomorrow and I can't wait to boast about it in front of the other cooks at work!

I add some Italian bread crumbs on top and it is simply delicious! Also, if you are looking for an even healthier version, change out the mayo for plain greek yogurt. You won't even notice you made the change!

This is the first tilapia that my husband really loved!  We were tired of baking it with canned tomatoes and herbs and wine, so this was a very welcome recipe find. Very moist and flavorful and not at all greasy.  I used about a tablespoon of a soft butter/olive oil blend instead of butter, a tablespoon of regular mayo,  1/4 C parmesan cheese, lemon juice, Old Bay, and dried basil, and it was way more than enough for almost a pound of fish. Rubbed a little olive oil on both sides of fish before broiling.  Followed broiling directions as given.  Perfect!

This recipe was very fast and easy which is what I was looking for. I substituted the light mayo with plain yogurt since I'm not a mayo fan. I made it in a small pan in my toaster oven with asparagus spears. Great idea without a lot of prep time!!!

I also followed the recipe directly as written.  I'm not a seafood person whatsoever, but the tilapia was mild and the recipe gave it incredible flavor. Kids loved it too. Will definitely make this one again. Thanks!

This recipe was good, but it tasted kind of average for me. It was a plus that it was so easy to make and cooked quickly. I substituted celery seed for celery salt and used a little salt to make up for the missing salt in the dish. I also tried this recipe on salmon and found that salmon was too tough. Tilapia is definitely the way to go with this recipe. In the future I will use less parmesan cheese. I felt that the parmesan cheese overpowered all of the ingredients. Overall a good dish, but you may need to alter it to your liking.

I thought this was great. I did add panko bread crumbs and baked it for about 20 minutes before finishing it off in the broiler. I like a little spice so I added some Old Bay to my fillet. I just might add some Sriracha to the mayo mix next time!

Nice flavor.  Will make again and cut back slightly on the proportions of the mixture as I felt it was a bit overpowering for the dish.  My broil time ended up being closer to 4-5 min on each side, but only two after I put it back in the oven with the mixture.  The reason could be that mine was a little further than a few inches from the heating element.

This was pretty good but as other reviews stated, the topping slid off the fish.  I think I'll keep looking for that perfect recipe.

I admit, I was skeptical because I don't love the taste of mayo. Even as I was smothering the cheese mixture on the fish, I was questioning whether this would be any good at all.  Boy was I surprised!  This is a must-try recipe for any fish lover. One of the best on the site.  My husband and my daughter gave it rave reviews, too.  I did not have celery salt and we did not miss it.

I do not like fish, but this is amazing! I don't measure exactly because I only make 2 fillets at a time and it turns out so good! I use fresh shredded parmesan, not the shaker kind. And I don't even have celery salt,I use garlic salt, onion powder, and basil. The perfect flavor combination. Just wow.

Absolutely delicious - the only thing we did different was to coat the fish lightly in olive oil and grill for about 7 minutes flipping once. Then we topped fish with parmesan mixture and broiled for two minutes. We also brushed blanched asparagus with the parmesan mixture and broiled with the fish - very delicious, yum!  Thanks so much for sharing - definitely a keeper!

This was so good.  I really could taste the hint of basil.  My 9 year-old loved it as well.  She's our picky eater.  I did have to bake it after the cheese browned because the fatter middle parts of the fish were not done all the way through.  Still cooked faster than other fish I have cooked.  A real easy meal.

So easy, so fast, and so good.  I substituted sour cream for mayo, simply because I was out of mayo, and it was so good I plan on making it that way from now on.

I love fish but never cook it well.  This recipe was quick and easy and most of all there were no leftovers.  When my husband asked I said it was a five star recipe and he said I AGREE, keep it around.

This is an amazing 5 star tilapia recipe that was super easy to make. My husband who dislikes fish really enjoyed this recipe and that says a lot. The topping was super flavorful and went wonderfully with the tilapia. I only added a little garlic powder and paprika as someone else suggested. Regular mayonnaise worked here just as well. This was marvelous and will be added to my recipes hall of fame. Thanks for sharing.

This was excellent. I halved the recipe since I only had 3 fillets, followed the recipe, except I sprinkled about 1/2 tablespoon of Panko crumbs on top of the mixture before putting it under the broiler which gave it some more crunch - oh and I also added a sprinkle of Old Bay Seasoning to the mixture also since we are in Maryland so basically everything gets Old Bay on it. :)
Delicious. This is our new go-to recipe for Tilapia!

I tried this recipe and its great.  I served mine with mixed veggies and saffron rice.  It's quick. Its easy and inexpensive.  I also used dried Italian seasoning instead of the basil, because I didn't have it on hand.  Definently will cook this again.

Omg! Just made this for lunch and loved it. Following other reviews, I added my favorite seasonings to the Parmesan mixture - lemon pepper, garlic powder and celery salt. Not bland at all, people. Just remember this is a mike white fish and the taste you ADD to it will be the taste you get. I used IQF tilapia filets from Costco and they were a little thin, so 2 min. on each side and then 2 min. for topping was PLENTY. Don't overcook and you'll love this super healthy and tasty dish.

I made a few changes, but it came out perfectly!! Talk about a restaurant quality talapia dish that doesn't need a tartar sauce and it's so tender, it melts in your mouth! I used a 1/4 cup light mayo, dried basil, salt and pepper to taste and about 1/3 cup Parmesan. I put the mayo mixture evenly on the raw filet (my filets were 1/4lb each) and also topped it with panko bread crumbs (mixed w melted butter). I broiled on low heat for 8 mins on the second highest rack and then let the fish finish cooking through in a 350 degree oven for an additional 3 mins. Absolutely my fave fish dish now. My husband also gave it rave reviews.

So I've made this 3 times within the last 3 weeks and have to say I loved this. I'm pregnant and need my fish!  The husband says it's his favorite fish that I make, hands down. So quick to put together, and it's nice and light. Melted the butter by mistake and it was fine. Didn't have any mayo in the house (horror of horrors), and used lite ranch instead.  Will try the mayo next time. Paired this with the Garlic Broccoli on this site wanted to serve this with Orzo and Rice but didn't have any orzo.  Works perfectly on the top rung of the toaster oven!

This was fabulous!  My husband said it was like a fancy restaurant dish. I didn't have celery salt so I added 1/2 spoon of Old Bay seasoning instead, a dash or garlic powder (since I didn't have onion powder) and it turned out perfect!  My young kids loved it too!  Will be making this again for sure.  Thank you for the recipe!

Yummy.  I've made both this version and the original one with all of that delicious fat.  By adding 1/4 of bread crumbs to the mixture it held together perfectly on top of the tilapia and is extremely comparable.  I'll definitely be making this version from now on instead of the other one.

Pulsed first the Parmesan cheese in the food processor, then added the remaining ingredients.  We substituted non-fat Greek yogurt for the mayonnaise.  Once that was all combined, added the bread crumbs to the processor and pulsed to combine.  

I spread a thin layer of olive oil over the aluminum foil before broiling the tilapia, to prevent sticking.  This was DELICIOUS.   Thank you so much for the recipe.

This recipe was amazing and delicious! I used about 2 tbsp of "I can't believe it's not butter" spray (just took off the spray cap and poured the liquid out) instead of the butter. I also used Hellman's light mayo. I will make this again and again! Love that it is healthy but tastes like it's something that should be bad for you ;)

I used light butter as well as the light mayo.  Very tasty.  I think I'd cut back a bit on the parm cheese next time but it certainly hit the spot.

I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time, I cut back a little on the butter and mayo.  This is a fantastic recipe!  The tilapia comes out very tender and not overdone.  My husband even complimented it (he is not a big fish eater) so I am definitely keeping this one!!

My husband, who loves cheese, and I, who wants a light coating only, both loved this recipe! I halved this recipe and didn't use the onion powder/celery salt because we were out. My 4 yr old likes plain fish (no sauce), so I always have to try to find a recipe that I can add sauce to individual pieces of fish but use the same cooking time. This was perfect for our needs. I used fresh fish from the store but will be using frozen fish next time, so hope it will taste as good as it did tonight!

Didn't expect this to be as good as it was.  Husband is the cook most days in our house so many of my reviews start this way....Husband cooked this and the same is true for this one.  We were both surprised at how much we liked it.

sauce is like a homemade ceasar dressing! (And that happens to be my favorite. YUM!) So good! I added a little extra basil and did not add the celery salt. Plus, I saved a little sauce for dipping and served over rice. Will make again! Thanks

I was only making this for one so I completely eyeballed the proportions. The end result was a bit more mayo and cheese...making it less healthy but still MUCHO delicious. The cooking instructions were perfect and I will do this again.

I made this for the first time tonight, for dinner.  I used Swai instead of the tilapia (only because it was a little less expensive).  My husband, who is not a fan of parmesan (or similar cheeses) LOVED this dish.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Delicious!  Made this in a grill pan on the gas grill because the weather was hot and I didn't want to heat up the kitchen.  I followed the recipe exactly except placed the grill pan on a high grill.  After adding the parmesan mix I left it in on the grill about 30 seconds so the parmesan didn't completely melt off.  The parmesan mix didn't brown but that was ok, still tasted great!

I love broiled Parmesan fish. This makes such a quick and easy weeknight meal for busy people. I didn't have tilapia and cod worked well. I used my counter top convection oven on the broil setting. Worked perfectly.

I made this recipe with fresh caught tilapia.  I wasn't sure at first, when mixing the ingredients together.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I served it over white rice with fresh green beans.  It turned out absolutely amazing!  After taking the fish from the pan there was some juice still left in the pan.  I poured it into a small sauce pan and added some heavy whipping cream, lemon juice and a bit of sea salt (small amounts of each).  I spooned the sauce over the fish and rice, and the result...  5 star restaurant quality meal!!!!!  It was absolutely amazing!  I'm glad I found this recipe!  Will be making this again, and often!  Thanks!!!!

This turned out great! I didn't have all the called for ingredients so I had to improvise a bit. Celery seed and salt, fine minced onion, 1/2 butter/1/2 coconut oil and regular mayo instead (I don't like the taste of low fat mayo, not do I care for the added sugar in it), but it turned out well and even my 4.5 year old liked it.

This made for a delicious and easily produced topping for tilapia. The flavors are just subtle enough not to overpower, but can be tasted in each forkful.

Given the amount of fish indicated, and the quantities of the other ingredients, I do think one could double up on the topping. I ran out when I was putting it on the fish, and it ended up being spread somewhat thinly. I'm thinking double, or even just 50% more, would have been perfect. However, I also got lazy; it would have taken me a whopping 7 minutes to whip up more topping on the spot and I decided to go with what I had. I'm not sure how much of this would be too much, given that tilapia filets are often quite thin and you wouldn't want each bite to be all topping, but I do think I could have erred more on the "too much" side instead of the "too little".

Bottom line: I heartily recommend this easy to make fish recipe.

Love this recipe. Quick, easy and delicious!  I have never served any fish to dinner guest, but it was Friday in Lent so thought this would work. The guest loved it. My hubby said he had never had any better tilapia in any restaurant.

Tried this recipe, had never used a broiler before. So had my doubts to the success. Well next time I make it I need to double the amount of fish. The kids loved so much we were fighting over how much we could put on our plates lol.

This was edible, but I just didn't like the flavor at all. It may be because I used Light Miracle Whip instead of Light Mayonnaise, but I don't think that change would even do it for me.

This recipe works well with any fish filets. I like the crusty topping. Haven't changed anything. Have made at least once a week this summer. Thanks for sharing.

My entire family- husband, teenage sons, and myself loved it!  I used dill instead of basil because I was out- it would have been fine either way.  Like on other reviewer mentioned, it was a little soft in the middle, but not enought to keep us from absolutely loving it!

I have made both broiled parmesan tilapia recipes off of All Recipes and this one is by far our favorite!!! I was a little worried because a lot of times "healthier" means less flavor but reducing the mayo and butter seemed to bring out the flavors of everything else so much more. It was fantastic that I had nothing but clean plates all around, which says something!!! The only change we did was not adding the celery salt, but that was just our flavor preference.

Absolutely my favorite tilapia recipe ever!!! I almost licked my plate afterwards. Have been this at least 10 times already. Tips: I followed the recipe exactly except I don't have celery salt but had celery seeds and salt and just used equal parts of both. Also when you put it back in, I put it back in on broil for 5 minutes, not 3, to get it nice and brown toasted. I also sometimes double the celery seed and onion because I love my for extra seasoned. Just finger-licking good!!! And great for those watching calories. Great protein and low cal. Winner!

Pretty tastyI  I haven't made the regular version of "Broiled Tilapia Parmesan" so I can't compare the two, but this topping held its own during the cooking process.  I decided to bake the fish at 375 degrees for 10 minutes without the topping and then another 8-9 after the topping was spread on the fillets.  I added Paul Prudhomme's "Seafood Magic" to the seasoning mix and probably upped the amounts of the other seasonings.  I always sprinkle lemon pepper on my fillets regardless of the recipe.  I used olive oil instead of the butter.

This tasted real good. I did make some tweaks. Instead of broiling it, I baked in the pan to save time.  I have issues with my broiler, though it didn't come out as white in the photo. And I didn't have any celery salt and used regular salt instead. I would make it again and broil it.

I loved it. However, I didn't have all the ingredients. Instead of the light mayo, I used homemade tartar sauce. And used real salted butter. I used the recommended Basil, and I added paprika, and garlic salt. I did not use  black pepper.  It was a tad salty so I would change the salted butter for Becel Buttery  Taste Margarine. Other than that, this is being added to my favorites. Awesome Recipe! Highly recommended.

This turned out so DELICIOUS! My family loved it and ate 2 pans of it for dinner, and there's only 4 of us!
I'm going to try it  with bread crumbs mixed in next time for a bit of a crunch.  I cooked it til it was dark golden brown and crispy around the edges. I also doubled the recipe for about 3 lbs of tilapia.
I think if i use olive oil instead of butter that I'll try adding honey and cut the oil in half or completely out. Talk about healthy! 
This has worked well with salmon.

I made this last night.  I needed something simple and quick.  This made the cut and it was delicious.  I did not have Parmesan cheese  and butter in the house.  Instead of butter I used coconut oil and used nothing for Parmesan substitute.  I actually used the mixture to marinade the fish for about 1 hour.

 It turned out fantastic.

Thank you.

Great flavor. Easy to make. I love the idea of fish recipes that are low in carbs, and yet tasteful.

Excellent recipe! I only had two large tilapia but didn't change the ingredient amounts and it worked out fine.  I didn't have celery salt (excluded the cheese) but did add Greek seasoning and just a sprinkling of bread crumbs. Mine was in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes. It has a light yet flavorful taste.

I absolutely love this recipe. I added pinko at the end for a little crunch, but the rest is the exact recipe. This will be a new staple in our household.

This was excellent!!! My husband loved it. I baked it and then broiled... and I used bread crumb as well. We love fish and I really love how easy it was... I had everything already on hand which was a plus!

this came out BEYOND delicious!  i subbed margarine for the butter and used regular mayo (we never carry the light stuff).. i added 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes as "Shannon :)" did in the original recipe.. i was tempted to add some almond meal (as others added bread crumbs) but the consistency of the topping was fine as is.. i'm a newbie when it comes to broiling, but this was a great experience.. i think next time i'll add some italian seasoning and see if it adds anything.. i'd love to experiment with chicken with this recipe.. ty for making those who think cheese and fish don't go together think twice!

This is my new standard way of boosting the flavour of those boring frozen fish portions.  A mixture of  mayo (low fat), Parmesan cheese, and lemon is good by itself, but the addition of butter and the other seasonings kicks it up a notch.

This was really good! My fish was nice and tender. The flavors married well together. I have put my family on a diet so I need something that wasn't bland with just using regular house seasoning. This was perfect! I will def be using this again in the near future.

I thought this was fantastic.  I used fresh basil instead of ground, I didn't measure but probably about 1/2 tablespoon.  I also added garlic powder.  Left out the celery salt because I thought it would be salty enough given the parmesan cheese.  Very easy to make.

Yummo!  I had to use extra-heavy mayo (bought a giant gallon container of it at Sam's Club as a joke for my gf and been stuck with it since), and had no basil on hand so I used tarragon instead, another fishy herb.  It was only the two of us so I made about 1 1/2 lb and cut the first 4 ingredients by 50 percent (kept the dry ingredients as-is for more potency).  It gave us a lot of varying contrast between topping flavor and fish flavor depending on the thickness of the fish.  She's going to make me make this again but I'd make it again anyway, good stuff!  Next time I'll follow the recipe exactly.

Great recipe.  Fish was delicate and moist. To make it a little healthier, I substituted Avocado oil for butter and used yogurt and cottage cheese instead of mayo.  Yummy!!!

Excellent. We loved it. I added a little dollop or two of sour cream and cajun seasoning to the mix. The two ingredients added a lot of flavor.

Not a healthy fish guy. I like mine fried. This is the first fish recipe that is healthy and I enjoy.   The family agrees.

My wife said it was good and she is not a seafood fan. I enjoyed it as well, but have had better. It is worth revisiting again.

i halved it for 3 people and it was a little short.  the topping is great, but it needs to cover the whole fish.  also add panic and old bay.

This was very tasty. I did add just a sprinkle of Tones Citrus Seasoning on top of the mixture and then broiled for the last two minutes. Very good!

I go back to this recipe again and again.  I sprinkle Old Bay seasoning on the filets before putting on the topping.  Instead of broiling you can bake the filets for approx 15 minutes (depending on size of filet).  Have also substituted other white fish (swai) for tilapia.  Yum.

I've been scouring the net looking for heart-healthy meals that my husband can enjoy, and ran across this one.  He's somewhat "meh" on fish, but when I used the sauce on our tilapia, he was over-the-moon excited to eat it.  I did make some changes to accommodate our lifestyle:

1.  Omit the parmesan cheese, and used a TBS of 'The Spice Hunter Fish Seasoning Blend'.
2.  Used Smart Balance butter.
3.  Used Fat Free, Sodium-free Kraft Mayo.

This is definitely one of our 'go-to' sauces for fish now.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is a wonderful recipe.. I tweaked if after the first go around.. I totally omitted the mayo and used plain non-fat Greek yogurt instead.  I had both grated and shredded parm so I threw some of that in, increased the lemon juice.. added some cayenne powder for a kick and I mixed in finely chopped pecans!  It was amazing!!

This is my go to tilapia recipe when I am in hurry. It is pretty good and literally ready in 10-12 minutes. I, sometimes, add other spices  for a change, like paprika, Old Bay or Cajun seasoning.

I followed the  recipe except for the celery salt (didn't have any) I figured the parmigiano would give it enough saltiness. The taste is fine, just not a wow dish.

I seasoned each piece with Old Bay, dried basil and a bit of sea salt, cooked the talapia stovetop in a bit of  olive oil until almost done...then mixed the parm,  2 Tbs. lite mayo and lemon juice (NO BUTTER) and spread it over each piece, sprinkled a bit of panko on top and then broiled until brown.   The topping stayed on and was wonderful.  RAVE REVIEWS FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY.  Definitely a new favorite!

Fantastic, I made it exactly to the recipe.  Paired with the healthy fried cabbage recipe and sautéed mushrooms.  Less than 250 cals but was very filling.  The flavor of the fish is outstanding

Oh My Gosh ~ This is so amazing.  I make this recipe at least once a month and it certainly is tasty.  One of my friends even commented once that it tastes like an entree in a local seafood restaurant that we love.  It really is that good.

Loved it! Definitely restaurant quality and doesn't taste light at all.  I used Walleye that my husband had caught and greek yogurt instead of mayo and it was amazing! My husband (who loves to catch fish but doesn't like eating fish?) said  this was delicious.  I think this will be my go-to whenever I have fish to cook!

I love this recipe! I was out of mayo and celery salt so I omitted the mayo and replaced the celery salt with garlic powder. It still came out moist and tastes wonderful.

I followed recipe for the most part but used Paul Prudhommes Seafood magic for seasoning and cooked it with the oven slightly ajar. Absolutely the best Talapia Dish ever.

My entire family loved this. Even my daughter that said she "wasn't going to eat any because she doesn't like fish" asked for a second helping! I did add some Old Bay seasoning as others have done. My husband was a little surprised at the "tanginess" so I may cut back on the lemon juice a bit next time.

I am a novice cook and I am looking for easy fish recipe. This was super easy and delish! I read in the comments and used Greek yogurt instead of mayo (didn't have any). You can't miss with this!

We loved the recipe! I baked my  frozen tilapia fillets at 400 for 10 minutes. I basted the filets with the mixture. Then baked until the filets were white, then added the rest of the mixture evenly over each filet. I then broiled them until golden brown.   AMAZING!! Thank you for this recipe.

My husband loved the fish done this way. Barely even shared any with our son. I didn't have onion powder or celery salt, so I used onion salt, and a few pinches of celery seed.

Loved this as did my husband & 2 boys - 9 & 12!  Subbed out equal amounts of salt & celery seed as I was out of celery salt.  Also I seasoned the filets w/Tony's creole seasoning to add some extra flavor.  Will definitely add this to our favorites as we eat a lot of fish!  Thanks for this ??

I made this for dinner last night. We loved it. I changed the mayo to miracle whip (because that's what I had) and instead of broiling, I baked for 12 min. at 400 degrees and broiled for 2 min. at the end.

I made this because I had everything on hand. I softened the butter in the microwave and then accidentally omitted it, but it was still very tasty! Everyone in my family enjoyed it and I'll definitely make it again.

I just have to say that this was INCREDIBLE. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS. This was my first time preparing fish of any sort, and it couldn't have been easier. I added 1/4 tsp of paprika and 1/4 of crushed red pepper, but followed the instructions exactly and it turned out perfectly. Making it again tonight and will definitely be making this whenever my man brings home fish! THANK YOU!!!!!

This was easy and yummy!  I slathered the sauce on thick because I was worried it was so healthy it might not have enough taste but does!  I really didn't need so much sauce on it!

Made this last night and it is truly delicious. As for the herbs, I used dried basil, garlic powder, fish seasoning, salt, and pepper. I took the advice of the allrecipes kitchen staff; broil 3 minutes, then 2 minutes, and finally 2 more minutes. I would definitely make this again.

I celery salt or onion powder.   I substituted with seasoning salt and added more basil.   We love basil.  Loved it from the first bite. We will definitely be making this again and again and again..

Very good!  I always add just a bit more lemon juice on any fish recipe, just as a preference.  Mixed grated parm (aka "shaky cheese") with fresh grated parm, and was still very good. My kids really loved it.

This was delicious. Broiling it leaves the tilapia very juicy. The lemon juice and butter combo is something I love to do with fish. Really gives it a nice flavor. This is a very quick and simple but delicious recipe. I will be making it again.

This recipe absolutely rocks and is so easy the first time I made it I made two filets for my husband and I. I made sure to use more parmesan than mayo but added all the other ingredients to taste and to the portions I was serving. It was fabulous. This recipe can't be messed up!

This was great! I used cod.  Broiled for 3mins each side then 2mins w/ the topping and that ended up being a little too long.

This recipe is quick, fresh and very tasty. Make it this way first to appreciate the complement of ingredients. Any changes to the ingredients - then it becomes a different recipe. Hubby said to keep this recipe in the weekly rotation.

AWESOME just AWESOME!! I sautéed onions and peppers and served over the Tilapia and it was just AWESOME. I served it to my family and a guest who is real picky. He said he didn't like fish but once he tried this fish he has changed his mind. This really is a very good recipe and my family asked me to make this regularly.

Used fat free mayo, margarine & added little more lemon juice. Didnt have celery salt so used Accent. We tasted sauce and was kind of iffy, but once cooked on fish, flavors came together beautifully and even hubby licked the plate. Recipe made enough for 4 large portions of fish. Sauce was nice with light flavor of fish- didn't overpower it. Will definitely make again.

Love this recipe just as it is written. We lightly seasoned the underside of the fish with salt and pepper our second time making this and it enhanced the flavor. Very tasty!

It was wonderful! I had to use lemon pepper instead of lemon juice and I didn't have any celery  salt so I had to use reg salt. But it still was a hit, I love the glamour the mayo have it, yummy. Will definite try again!

Fast, easy and delicious!  I used old bay seasoning in lieu of celery salt/onion powder.  I also seasoned the fish with lemon and old bay on both sides prior to broiling.  I'm glad I did b/c I think it would have been too bland otherwise.

All I can say is WOW! This fish is amazing! We have made this a few times now and have made a few changes to make the recipe have even fewer calories. We used 2 tbsp of light mayo instead of regular and left out the butter. Also, I used only 1/4 cup of freshly grated parm cheese instead of 1/2 cup. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe! :)

This was delicious! I was only making it for 2 so halved the recipe and stirred the extra topping into cooked broccoli. It was also very yummy! I would make this for guests, very quick and simple to prepare. Tastes like something you would get at a nice restaurant!

I loved it...my other half said..."gross" when I asked him to make the topping (mayo on fish?). And when he took his first bite, he said "Not bad" (that means it's a keeper). This recipe is delicious. I added a bit more fish type seasoning, but stuck to the recipe for the most part and can say that this is super yummy. You have to try this. Period.

I found this recipe on a Wednesday and by Monday I used it twice!  My cousin and I share only the best recipes, this is one I will be sharing with him!  I really enjoyed how quick it was to prepare and cook, and it tastes as great as it was.  I have joined this site.

This is fantastic!  I used fresh dill instead of basil and it was excellent.  I was the best tilapia I have ever had and every one else thought so too.

I made this for the first time tonight and my family loved it!  The parm-mayo topping was very flavorful without overpowering the fish.  We couldn't get enough of it and there were no left-overs.  This recipe will definitely be repeated.

Probably the best tasting Talapia that I have ever had. Usually it comes out quite bland and lacking flavor. I followed this recipe but switched the butter out for some coconut oil and since some English friends were visiting and they don't like mayonnaise I used some of their salad cream instead. This fish was packed full of flavor with the sauce on top and the Parmesan browned nicely making it look like cheese pizza on the top. Yumm Yummm!!

I'm always in search of healthy recipes.  I usually substitute plain, low-fat yogurt for mayo when I make tuna salad and wasn't quite sure how that substitution would work out under a broiler.  It worked great!!  And tasted so yummy!!!  I substituted plain, low-fat yogurt for the mayo and left out the butter completely and used a little more parm.  The tilapia loins were incredible and ready to eat in minutes.  I will be adding this to my weekly menu! :)

I was so excited to try it out, but wasn't excited about the outcome.  It was mushy and a bit bland.  Needs some more spice to give it a kick of flavor!

Tried it last night...my husband is not a huge fan of fish but I think he would pay me to make this again!  I baked it a little longer after the parmesan mix was applied until really bubbly and kind of toasty on the edges.  Super and super easy!

I didn't add the butter, onion powder or celery salt.  Definitely making it again. (I think not adding the butter made the top thicker and it stayed on the fish and the parmesan got crunchy).

Had this with roasted cauliflower. The fish topping was just as delicious on the cauliflower. I'll have to try it as a cauliflower topper in the future.

Awesome! This recipe is definitely a keeper.  It's very easy to prepare and comes out of the broiler looking like a restaurant entree. Now that I've tried it on my husband I know it's elegant enough to serve to company.

I followed the recipe to a T and my husband went crazy for this dish. The topping was just the right amount of cheesy deliciousness.  This will be one of my go-to recipes in the future. It is definitely a keeper.

Delicious! We followed the recipe exactly and it was great. Served it up with a side of rice and zucchini. Definitely adding this dish to our dinner rotation.

Tastes like something I would get from a seafood restaurant.  Tonight I am going to try this sauce on chicken.

I LOVE this recipe and I keep it in my regular rotation! The hubby loves it too! I usually let it broil until the toppings have plenty of golden brown spots though rather than just the 2-3 minutes. Perfect

Loved it! Just keep some of the sauce to the side for dipping (like tarter sauce). I hate fish with a passion and I loved it.

I love this! At first I though it was just ok. But then I added a spriinkle of salt and a squirt of lemon over it and bam! It was delicious. My favorite fish recipe I have ever made.
