So easy and very tasty. Did add a splash of vanilla in the dough and used confectionery sugar glaze instead of chocolate.

super easy and yummy. I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and they were loved by all. If you make these as directed, they are very small and i thought the cooking time was too long. I burned the first batch. I cooked the rest at 365 for 6 1/2 minutes for a perfect cookie.

YUMMY!  These are even better than traditional thumbprint cookies from scratch.  We also used strawberry jam instead of raspberry on some cookies, and they were just as good.

This was sooo easy, but looked elegant and homemade on a tray.  I made them for a cookie exchange, and my family demanded their own batch.  Definite repeat!

Yummy, I made a lemon version.  I added 1t lemon extract to the cookie batter and then I used lemon marmalade (curd would also work) for the filling and then drizzled with citrus glaze (1 cup sifted powdered sugar and a 4 teaspoons orange juice/or lemon juice).

I made these for a friend's wedding and they turned out wonderful.  so elegant yet so easy!  I didn't use the sugar on top, I thought they looked just as nice with just the melted chocolate.  I used raspberry preserves on half the batch, and apricot preserves on the other.  both were delicious!!

These cookies were amazing but I actually didn't do the drizzle as directed. I found a WONDERFUL almond drizzle from another recipe on this site - "Raspberry and Almond Shortbread Thumbprints". So I made the cookies from the cookies mix and covered them with that drizzle. I got so many compliments and loved them so much myself that I could hardly keep my hands off of them. By far the best turnout of all my xmas cookies this year.

This is a staple at my cookie exchange. I use both raspberry and apricot filling in my cookies.  The apricot is the most requested.

Not the amazing thumbprint cookie I was expecting, but it did the trick. I probably won't make this again because I have hopes that there is something better out there.

Good, but they melt huge.  Not your traditional thumbprint cookies.

These are wonderful!  I did not drizzle the white chocolate over the top or use the colored sugar, but everyone loved them and they were so EASY! I will definitely make these again!
